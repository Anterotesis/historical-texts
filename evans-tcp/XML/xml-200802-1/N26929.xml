<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MANY selections of excellent matter have lately been made for the benefit of young persons. Per∣formances of this kind are of so great utility, that fresh productions of them, and new attempts to improve the young mind, will scarcely be deemed superfluous, if the writer make his compilation instructive and in∣teresting, and sufficiently distinct from others.</P>
<P>THE present work, as the title expresses, aims at the attainment of three objects: to improve youth in the art of reading; to meliorate their language and sentiments; and to inculcate some of the most im∣portant principles of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>THE pieces selected, not only give exercise to a great variety of emotions, and the correspondent tones and variations of voice, but contain sentences and members of sentences, which are diversified, propor∣tioned, and pointed with accuracy. Exercises of this nature are, it is presumed, well calculated to teach youth to read with propriety and effect. A selection of sentences, in which variety and proportion, with exact punctuation, have been carefully, observed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all their parts as well as with respect to one another, will probably have a much greater effect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> properly teaching the art of reading, than is commonly imagined.
<PB N="iv" REF="035851_0005_1007AA452AA655C0"/>
In such constructions, every thing is accommodated to the understanding and the voice; and the common dif∣ficulties in learning to read well, are obviated. When the learner has acquired a habit of reading such sen∣tences, with justness and facility, he will readily ap∣ply that habit, and the improvements he has made, to sentences more complicated and irregular, and of a construction entirely different.</P>
<P>THE language of the pieces chosen for this collec∣tion, has been carefully regarded. Purity, propriety, perspicuity, and, in many instances, elegance of diction, distinguish them. They are extracted from the works of the most correct and elegant writers. From the sources whence the sentiments are drawn, the reader may expect to find them connected and regular, suffi∣ciently important and impressive, and divested of every thing that is either trite or eccentric. The frequent perusal of such composition, naturally tends to infuse a taste for this species of excellence; and to produce a habit of thinking, and of composing, with judgment and accuracy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Grammatical Student, in his progress through this work, will meet with numerous instances of composition, in strict conformity to the rules for promoting perspicuous and elegant writing, contain∣ed in the Appendix to the Author's English Grammar. By occa∣sionally examining this conformity, he will be confirmed in the utility of those rules; and be enabled to apply them with case and dexterity.</NOTE></P>
<P>THAT this collection may also serve the purpose of promoting piety and virtue, the Compiler has intro∣duced many extracts, which place religion in the most amiable light; and which recommend a great variety
<PB N="v" REF="035851_0006_1007AA47AD09C518"/>
of moral duties, by the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. These subjects are exhibited in a style and manner, which are calcu∣lated to arrest the attention of youth; and to make strong and durable impressions on their minds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some of the pieces, the Compiler has made a few alterations, chiefly verbal, to adapt them the better to the design of his work.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Compiler has been careful to avoid every ex∣pression and sentiment, that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, in the least degree, offend the eye or ear of innocence. This he conceives to be peculiarly incum∣bent on every person who writes for the benefit of youth. It would, indeed, be a great and happy im∣provement in education, if no writings were allowed to come under their notice, but such as are perfectly innocent; and if, on all proper occasions, they were encouraged to peruse those which tend to inspire a due reverence for virtue, and an abhorrence of vice, as well as to animate them with sentiments of piety and goodness. Such impressions deeply engraven on their minds, and connected with all their attainments, could scarcely fail of attending them through life; and of producing a solidity of principle and character, that would be able to resist the danger arising from future intercourse with the world.</P>
<P>THE Author has endeavoured to relieve the grave and serious parts of his collection, by the occasional admission of pieces which amuse as well as instruct. If, however, any of his readers should think it con∣tains too great a proportion of the former, it may be
<PB N="vi" REF="035851_0007_1007AA4C1B8C7998"/>
some apology, to observe that, in the existing publica∣tions designed for the perusal of young persons, the preponderance is greatly on the side of gay and amusing productions. Too much attention may be paid to this medium of improvement. When the imagination, of youth especially, is much entertained, the sober dic∣tates of the understanding are regarded with indif∣ference; and the influence of the good affections, is either feeble, or transient. A temperate use of such entertainment seems therefore requisite, to afford pro∣per scope for the operations of the understanding and the heart.</P>
<P>THE reader will perceive, that the Compiler has been solicitous to recommend to young persons, the perusal of the sacred Scriptures, by interspersing through his work, some of the most beautiful and interesting passages of those invaluable writings. To excite an early taste and veneration for this great rule of life, is a point of so high importance, as to warrant the at∣tempt to promote it on every proper occasion.</P>
<P>To improve the young mind, and to afford some as∣sistance to tutors, in the arduous and important work of education, were the motives which led to this pro∣duction. If the Author should be so successful as to ac∣complish these ends, even in a small degree, he will think his time and pains well employed, and himself amply rewarded.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD READING.</HEAD>
<P>TO read with propriety is a pleasing and important at∣tainment; productive of improvement both to the under∣standing and the heart. It is essential to a complete reader, that he minutely perceive the ideas, and enter into the feelings, of the author whose sentiments he professes to re∣peat; for how is it possible to represent clearly to others, what we have but faint or inaccurate conceptions of our∣selves? If there were no other benefits resulting from the art of reading well, than the necessity it lays us under, of precisely ascertaining the meaning of what we read; and the habit thence acquired, of doing this with fa∣cility, both when reading silently and aloud, they would constitute a sufficient compensation for all the labour we can bestow upon the subject. But the pleasure derived to ourselves and others, from a clear communication of ideas and feelings; and the strong and durable impressions made thereby on the minds of the reader and the audience, are considerations, which give additional importance to the study of this necessary and useful art. The perfect attainment
<NOTE PLACE="foot">For many of the observations contained in this preliminary tract, the Author is indebted to the writings of Dr. Blair, and to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.</NOTE>
<PB N="viii" REF="035851_0009_1007AA5291C1B338"/>
of it doubtless requires great attention and practice, joined to extraordinary natural powers: but as there are many degrees of excellence in the art, the student whose aims fall short of perfection, will find himself amply rewarded for every exer∣tion he may think proper to make.</P>
<P>To give rules for the management of the voice in reading, by which the necessary pauses, emphasis, and tones, may be discovered and put in practice, is not possible. After all the directions that can be offered on these points, much will remain to be taught by the living instructer: much will be attainable by no other means, than the force of example influencing the imitative powers of the learner. Some rules and principles on these heads will, however, be found use∣ful, to prevent erroneous and vicious modes of utterance; to give the young reader some taste of the subject; and to assist him in acquiring a just and accurate mode of delivery. The observations which we have to make, for these pur∣poses, may be comprised under the following heads: PROPER LOUDNESS OF VOICE; DISTINCTNESS; SLOWNESS; PRO∣PRIETY OF PRONUNCIATION; EMPHASIS; TONES; PAUSES; and MODE OF READING VERSE.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION 1. Proper Loudness of Voice.</HEAD>
<P>THE first attention of every person who reads to others, doubtless, must be, to make himself be heard by all those to whom he reads. He must endeavour to fill with his voice the space occupied by the company. This power of voice, it may be thought, is wholly a natural talent. It is, in a good measure, the gift of nature; but it may receive con∣siderable assistance from art. Much depends, for this pur∣pose, on the proper pitch and management of the voice.
<PB N="ix" REF="035851_0010_1007AA541BB48780"/>
Every person has three pitches in his voice; the HIGH, the MIDDLE, and the LOW one. The high, is that which he uses in calling aloud to some person at a distance. The low is, when he approaches to a whisper. The middle is, that which he employs in common conversation, and which he should generally use in reading to others. For it is a great mistake, to imagine that one must take the highest pitch of his voice, in order to be well heard in a large company. This is confounding two things which are different, loud∣ness or strength of sound, with the key or note on which we speak. There is a variety of sound within the compass of each key. A speaker may therefore render his voice louder, without altering the key: and we shall always be able to give most body, most persevering force of sound, to that pitch of voice, to which in conversation we are accus∣tomed. Whereas, by setting out on our highest pitch or key, we certainly allow ourselves less compass, and are likely to strain our voice before we have done. We shall fatigue ourselves, and read with pain; and whenever a per∣son speaks with pain to himself, he is always heard with pain by his audience. Let us therefore give the voice full strength and swell of sound; but always pitch it on our ordinary speaking key. It should be a constant rule, never to utter a greater quantity of voice, than we can afford without pain to ourselves, and without any extraordinary effort. As long as we keep within these bounds, the oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> organs of speech will be at liberty to discharge their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offices with ease; and we shall always have our voice under command. But whenever we transgress these bounds, we give up the reins, and have no longer any management of it. It is a useful rule too, in order to be well heard, to fix our eye on some of the most distant persons in the company, and to consider ourselves as reading to them. We naturally and mechanically utter our words with such a degree of
<PB N="x" REF="035851_0011_1007AA5880DCCF58"/>
strength, as to make ourselves be heard by the person whom we address, provided he is within the reach of our voice. As this is the case in conversation, it will hold also in reading to others. But let us remember, that in reading as well as in conversation, it is possible to offend by speak∣ing too loud. This extreme hurts the car, by making the voice come upon it in rumbling indistinct masses.</P>
<P>By the habit of reading, when young, in a loud and ve∣hement manner, the voice becomes fixed in a strained and unnatural key; and is rendered incapable of that variety of elevation and depression, which constitutes the true har∣mony of utterance, and affords case to the reader, and plea∣sure to the audience. This unnatural pitch of the voice, and disagreeable monotony, are most observable in persons who were taught to read in large rooms; who were accus∣tomed to stand at too great distance, when reading to their teachers; whose instructers were very imperfect in their hear∣ing; or who were taught by persons, that considered loud expression as the chief requisite in forming a good reader. These are circumstances which demand the serious atten∣tion of every one to whom the education of youth is committed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. Distinctness.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place, to being well heard and clearly under∣stood, distinctness of articulation contributes more than mere loudness of sound. The quantity of sound necessary to fill even a large space, is smaller than is commonly imagined: and, with distinct articulation, a person with a weak voice will make it reach farther, than the strongest voice can reach without it. To this, therefore, every reader ought to pay
<PB N="xi" REF="035851_0012_1007AA5B19FA5460"/>
great attention. He must give every sound which he utters, its due proportion; and make every syllable, and even every letter in the word which he pronounces, be heard distinctly; without slurring, whispering, or suppressing any of the proper sounds.</P>
<P>An accurate knowledge of the simple, elementary sounds of the language, and a facility in expressing them, are so necessary to distinctness of expression, that if the learner's attainments are, in this respect, imperfect, (and many there are in this situation,) it will be incumbent on his teacher, to carry him back to these primary articulations; and to sus∣pend his progress, till he become perfectly master of them. It will be in vain to press him forward, with the hope of forming a good reader, if he cannot completely articulate every elementary sound of the language.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. Due Degree of Slowness.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to express ourselves distinctly, moderation is re∣quisite with regard to the speed of pronouncing. Precipi∣tancy of speech confounds all articulation, and all mean∣ing. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that there may be also an extreme on the opposite side. It is obvious that a lifeless drawling manner of reading, which allows the minds of the hearers to be always outrunning the speaker, must render every such performance insipid and fatiguing. But the extreme of reading too fast is much more common; and requires the more to be guarded against, because, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it has grown up into a habit, few errors are more difficu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to be corrected. To pronounce with a proper degree of slowness, and with full and clear articulation, is necessary to be studied by all, who wish to become good readers;
<PB N="xii" REF="035851_0013_1007912817AD7E30"/>
and it cannot be too much recommended to them. Such a pronunciation gives weight and dignity to the subject. It is a great assistance to the voice, by the pauses and rests which it allows it more easily to make; and it enables the reader to swell all his sounds, both with more force and more harmony.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IV. Propriety of Pronunciation.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the fundamental attentions to the pitch and ma∣nagement of the voice, to distinct articulation, and to a pro∣per degree of slowness of speech, what the young reader must, in the next place, study, is propriety of pronuncia∣tion; or, giving to every word which he utters, that sound which the best usage of the language appropriates to it; in opposition to broad, vulgar, or provincial pronunciation. This is requisite both for reading intelligibly, and for reading with correctness and ease. Instructions concerning this ar∣ticle may best be given by the living teacher. But there is one observation, which it may not be improper here to make. In the English language, every word which consists of more syllables than one, has one accented syllable. The accent rests sometimes on the vowel, sometimes on the con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ant. The genius of the language, requires the voice to mark that syllable by a stronger percussion, and to pass more slightly over the rest. Now, after we have learned the pro∣per seats of these accents, it is an important rule, to give every word just the same accent in reading as in common discourse. Many persons err in this respect. When they read to others, and with solemnity, they pronounce the syllables in a different manner from what they do at other times. They dwell upon them, and protract them; they
<PB N="xiii" REF="035851_0014_1007AA5D74E69E28"/>
multiply accents on the same word; from a mistaken no∣tion, that it gives gravity and importance to their subject, and adds to the energy of their delivery. Whereas, this is one of the greatest faults that can be committed in pronun∣ciation: it makes what is called a pompous or mouthing manner; and gives an artificial affected air to reading, which detracts greatly both from its agreeableness, and its impression.</P>
<P>Sheridan and Walker have published dictionaries, for ascer∣taining the true and best pronunciation of the words of our lan∣guage. By attentively consulting them, particularly "Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary," the young reader will be much as∣sisted, in his endeavours to attain a correct pronunciation of the words belonging to the English language.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION V. Emphasis.</HEAD>
<P>BY Emphasis is meant a stronger and fuller sound of voice, by which we distinguish some word or words, on which we design to lay particular stress, and to show how they affect the rest of the sentence. Sometimes the em∣phatic words must be distinguished by a particular tone of voice, as well as by a particular stress. On the right ma∣nagement of the emphasis depends the life of pronunciation. If no emphasis be placed on any words, not only is dis∣course rendered heavy and lifeless, but the meaning left often ambiguous. If the emphasis be placed wrong, we pervert and confound the meaning wholly.</P>
<P>Emphasis may be divided into the SUPERIOR and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> INFERIOR emphasis. The superior emphasis determines the meaning of a sentence, with reference to something said be∣fore,
<PB N="xiv" REF="035851_0015_1007AA5F03B77A20"/>
presupposed by the author as general knowledge, or re∣moves an ambiguity, where a passage may have more senses than one. The inferior emphasis <HI>enforces, graces,</HI> and <HI>enlivens,</HI> but does not <HI>fix,</HI> the meaning of any passage. The words to which this latter emphasis is given, are, in general, such as seem the most important in the sentence, or, on other ac∣counts, to merit this distinction. The following passage will serve to exemplify the superior emphasis.</P>
<LG>
<L>" Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit</L>
<L>" Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste</L>
<L>" Brought death into the world, and all our wo," &amp;c.</L>
<L>" Sing, heav'nly Muse!"</L>
</LG>
<P>Supposing that originally other beings, besides men, had disobeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the circumstance were well known to us, there would fall an emphasis upon the word <HI>man's</HI> in the first line; and hence it would be read thus:
<Q><L>Of <HI>man's</HI> first disobedience, and the fruit, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>But if it were a notorious truth, that mankind had trans∣gressed in a peculiar manner more than once, the emphasis would fall on <HI>first;</HI> and the line be read,
<Q><L>Of man's <HI>first</HI> disobedience, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>Again, admitting death (as was really the case) to have been an unheard of and dreadful punishment, brought upon man in consequence of his transgression; on that supposition the third line would be read,
<Q><L>"Brought <HI>death</HI> into the world," &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>But if we were to suppose, that mankind knew there was such an evil as death in other regions, though the place they inhabited had been free from it till their transgression, the line would run thus:
<Q><L>"Brought death into the <HI>world,"</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="035851_0016_1007AA6163F1F338"/>
The superior emphasis finds place in the following short sentence, which admits of four distinct meanings, each of which is ascertained by the emphasis only.</P>
<P>"Do you ride to town to-day?"</P>
<P>The following examples illustrate the nature and use of the inferior emphasis.</P>
<P><Q>Many persons mistake the <HI>love,</HI> for the <HI>practice</HI> of vir∣tue.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Shall I reward his services with <HI>falsehood!</HI> Shall I for∣get <HI>him</HI> who cannot forget <HI>me!</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>If his principles are <HI>false,</HI> no apology from <HI>himself</HI> can make them <HI>right:</HI> if founded in <HI>truth,</HI> no censure from <HI>others</HI> can make them <HI>wrong.</HI></Q></P>
<LG>
<L>" Though <HI>deep,</HI> yet <HI>clear;</HI> though <HI>gentle,</HI> yet not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll;</HI></L>
<L>" <HI>Strong,</HI> without <HI>rage;</HI> without <HI>o'erflowing, full."</HI></L>
</LG>
<P><Q>A <HI>friend</HI> exaggerates a man's <HI>virtues;</HI> an <HI>enemy,</HI> his <HI>crimes.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>wise man</HI> is happy, when he gains his <HI>own</HI> appro∣bation; the <HI>fool,</HI> when he gains that of <HI>others.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The superior emphasis, in reading as in speaking, must be determined entirely by the <HI>sense</HI> of the passage, and al∣ways made <HI>alike:</HI> but as to the inferior emphasis, <HI>taste</HI> alone seems to have the right of fixing its situation and quantity.</P>
<P>Among a number of persons, who have had proper oppor∣tunities of learning to read, in the best manner it is now taught, very few could be selected, who, in a given in∣stance, would use the inferior emphasis alike, either as to place or quantity. Some persons, indeed, use scarcely any degree of it: and others do not scruple to carry it much beyond any thing to be found in common discourse; and even sometimes throw it upon words so very trifling in themselves, that it is evidently done with no other view,
<PB N="xvi" REF="035851_0017_1007AA64DD13CD48"/>
than to give variety to the modulation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By modulation is meant that pleasing variety of voice, which is perceived in uttering a sentence, and which, in its nature, is perfectly distinct from emphasis, and the tones of emotion and passion. The young reader should be careful to render his modulation correct and easy; and, for this purpose, should form it upon the model of the most judicious and accurate speakers.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this diversity of practice, there are certainly proper bounda∣ries, within which this emphasis must be restrained, in or∣der to make it meet the approbation of sound judgment and correct taste. It will doubtless have different degrees of exertion, according to the greater or less degree of im∣portance of the words upon which it operates; and there may be very properly some variety in the use of it; but its application is not arbitrary, depending on the caprice of readers.</P>
<P>As emphasis often falls on words in different parts of the same sentence, so it is frequently required to be continued, with a little variation, on two, and sometimes more words together. The following sentences exemplify both the parts of this position: <Q>If you seek to make one <HI>rich,</HI> study not to <HI>increase his stores,</HI> but to <HI>diminish, his desires.</HI></Q> <Q>The Mexican figures, or picture-writing, represent <HI>things,</HI> not <HI>words:</HI> they exhibit <HI>images to the eye,</HI> not <HI>ideas to the understanding.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Some sentences are so full and comprehensive, that almost every word is emphatical: as, "Ye hills and dales, ye rivers, "woods, and plains!" or, as that pathetic expostulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel, "Why will ye die!"</P>
<P>Emphasis, besides its other offices, is the great regulator of quantity. Though the quantity of our syllables is fixed, in words separately pronounced, yet it is mutable, when these words are ranged in sentences; the long being changed
<PB N="xvii" REF="035851_0018_1007AA6764901798"/>
into short, the short into long, according to the importance of the words with regard to meaning. Emphasis also, in particular cases, alters the seat of the accent. This is de∣monstrable from the following examples. <Q>He shall <HI>in</HI>crease, but I shall <HI>de</HI>crease.</Q> <Q>There is a difference between giving and <HI>for</HI>giving.</Q> <Q>In this species of composition, <HI>plausi</HI>bility is much more essential than <HI>prob</HI>ability.</Q> In these examples, the emphasis requires the accent to be placed on syllables, to which it does not commonly belong.</P>
<P>In order to acquire the proper management of the em∣phasis, the great rule to be given, is, that the reader study to attain a just conception of the force and spirit of the sentiments which he is to pronounce. For to lay the em∣phasis with exact propriety, is a constant exercise of good sense and attention. It is far from being an inconsiderable attainment. It is one of the most decisive trials of a true and just taste; and must arise from feeling delicately our∣selves, and from judging accurately of what is fittest to strike the feelings of others.</P>
<P>There is one error, against which it is particularly proper to caution the learner; namely, that of multiplying em∣phatical words too much, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the emphasis indis∣criminately. It is only by a prudent reserve and distinc∣tion in the use of them, that we can give them any weight. If they recur too often; if a reader attempts to render every thing he expresses of high importance, by a multi∣tude of strong emphasis, we soon learn to pay little regard to them. To crowd every sentence with emphatical words, is like crowding all the pages of a book with Italic charac∣ters; which, as to the effect, is just the same as to use no such distinctions at all.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<PB N="xviii" REF="035851_0019_1007AA68ED269418"/>
<HEAD>SECTION VI. Tones.</HEAD>
<P>TONES are different both from emphasis and pauses; consisting in the notes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> variations of sound which we em∣ploy, in the expression of our sentiments. Emphasis affects particular words and phrases, with a degree of tone or inflection of voice; but tones, peculiarly so called, affect sentences, paragraphs, and sometimes even the whole of a discourse</P>
<P>To show the use and necessity of tones, we need only observe, that the mind, in communicating its ideas, is in a constant state of activity, emotion, or agitation, from the different effects which those ideas produce in the speaker. Now the end of such communication being, not merely to lay open the ideas, but also the different feelings which they excite in him who utters them, there must be other signs than words, to manifest those feelings; as words ut∣tered in a monotonous manner, can represent only a similar state of mind, perfectly free from all activity or emotion. As the communication of these internal feelings, was of much more consequence in our social intercourse, than the mere conveyance of ideas, the Author of our being did not, as in that conveyance, leave the invention of the language of emotion, to man; but impressed it himself upon our na∣ture, in the same manner as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has done with regard to the rest of the animal world; all of which express their various feelings, by various tones. Ours, indeed, from the supe∣rior rank that we hold, are in a high degree more compre∣hensive; as there is not an act of the mind, an exertion of the fancy, or an emotion of the heart, which has not its
<PB N="xix" REF="035851_0020_1007AA6AC3C09A10"/>
peculiar tone, or note of the voice, by which it is to be ex∣pressed; and which is suited exactly to the degree of internal feeling. It is chiefly in the proper use of these tones, that the life, spirit, beauty, and harmony of delivery consist.</P>
<P>The limits of this introduction, do not admit of exam∣ples, to illustrate the variety of tones belonging to the dif∣ferent passions and emotions. We shall, however, select one, which is extracted from the beautiful lamentation of David over Saul and Jonathan, and which will, in some degree, elucidate what has been said on this subject. <Q>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath; publish it not in the streets of Askelon: lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice; lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away; the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oyl.</Q> The first of these divisions, expresses sorrow and lamentation; therefore the note is low. The next contains a spirited command, and should be pronounced much higher. The other sentence, in which he makes a pathetic address to the mountains where his friends had been slain, must be ex∣pressed in a note quite different from the two former; not so low as the first, nor so high as the second, in a manly, firm, and yet plaintive tone.</P>
<P>The correct and natural language of the emotions, is not so difficult to be attained, as most readers seem to ima∣gine. If we enter into the spirit of the author's sentiments, as well as into the meaning of his words, we shall not fail to deliver the words in properly varied tones. For there are few people, who speak English without a provincial
<PB N="xx" REF="035851_0021_1007AA6FEB96C870"/>
note, that have not an accurate use of tones, when they utter their sentiments in earnest discourse. And the reason that they have not the same use of them, in reading aloud the sentiments of others, may be traced to the very defec∣tive and erroneous method, in which the art of reading is taught; whereby all the various, natural, expressive tones of speech, are suppressed; and a few artificial, unmeaning reading notes, are substituted for them.</P>
<P>But when we recommend to readers, an attention to the tone and language of emotions, we must be understood to do it with proper limitation. Moderation is necessary in this point, as it is in other things. For when reading becomes strictly imitative, it assumes a theatrical manner, and must be highly improper, as well as give offence to the hearers; because it is inconsistent with that delicacy and modesty, which are indispensable on such occasions. The speaker who delivers his own emotions, must be supposed to be more vivid and animated, than would be proper in the person who relates them at second hand.</P>
<P>We shall conclude this section with the following rule, for the tones that indicate the passions and emotions. <Q>In read∣ing, let all your tones of expression be borrowed from those of common speech, but, in some degree, more faintly cha∣racterised. Let those tones which signify any disagreeable passion of the mind, be still more faint than those which indicate agreeable emotions▪ and, on all occasions, pre∣serve yourselves so far from being affected with the sub∣ject, as to be able to proceed through it, with that easy and masterly manner, which has its good effects in this, as well as in every other art.</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. Pauses.</HEAD>
<P>PAUSES or rests, in speaking or reading, are a total cessa∣tion of the voice, during a perceptible, and, in many cases, a measurable space of time. Pauses are equally necessary to the speaker, and the hearer. To the speaker, that he may take breath, without which he cannot proceed far in delivery; and that he may, by these temporary rests, re∣lieve the organs of speech, which otherwise would be soon tired by continued action: to the hearer, that the ear also may be relieved from the fatigue, which it would otherwise endure from a continuity of sound; and that the understanding may have sufficient time to mark the distinction of sentences, and their several members.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of pauses; first, emphatical pauses; and next, such as mark the distinctions of sense. An em∣phatical pause is generally made, <HI>after</HI> something has been said of peculiar moment, and on which we desire to fix the hearer's attention. Sometimes, <HI>before</HI> such a thing is said, we usher it in with a pause of this nature. Such pauses have the same effect as a strong emphasis; and are subject to the same rules: especially to the caution, of not repeating them too frequently. For as they excite uncommon attention, and of course raise expectation, if the importance of the matter be not fully answerable to such expectation, they occasion disappointment and disgust.</P>
<P>But the most frequent and the principal use of pauses, is, to mark the divisions of the sense, and at the same time to allow the reader to draw his breath; and the proper and delicate adjustment of such pauses, is one of the most nice
<PB N="xxii" REF="035851_0023_1007AA747077D258"/>
and difficult articles of delivery. In all reading, the manage∣ment of the br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h requires a good deal of care, so as not to oblige us to divide words from one another, which have so intimate a connexion, that they ought to be pronounced with the same breath, and without the least separation. Many a sentence is miserably mangled, and the force of the emphasis totally lost, by divisions being made in the wrong place. To avoid this, every one, while he is reading, should be very careful to provide a full supply of breath, for what he is to utter. It is a great mistake to imagine, that the breath must be drawn only at the end of a period, when the voice is allowed to fall. It may easily be gathered at the intervals of the period, when the voice is suspended only for a moment; and, by this management, one may always have a sufficient stock for carrying on the longest sentence, without improper interruptions.</P>
<P>Pauses in reading must generally be formed upon the man∣ner in which we utter ourselves in ordinary, sensible con∣versation; and not upon the stiff artificial manner, which is acquired from reading books according to the common punctuation. It will by no means be sufficient to attend to the points used in printing: for these are far from marking all the pauses, which ought to be made in reading. A me∣chanical attention to these resting places, has perhaps been one cause of monotony, by leading the reader to a similar tone at every stop, and a uniform cadence at every period. The primary use of points, is to assist the reader in discerning the grammatical construction; and it is only as a secondary object, that they regulate his pronunciation. On this head, the following direction may be of use: <Q>Though in reading great attention should be paid to the stops, yet a greater should be given to the sense; and their correspondent
<PB N="xxiii" REF="035851_0024_1007AA76D4833880"/>
times occasionally lengthened beyond what is usual in com∣mon speech.</Q></P>
<P>To render pauses pleasing and expressive, they must not only be made in the right place, but also accompanied with a proper tone of voice, by which the nature of these pauses is intimated; much more than by the length of them, which can seldom be exactly measured. Sometimes it is only a slight and simple suspension of voice that is proper; some∣times a degree of cadence in the voice is required; and some∣times that peculiar tone and cadence which denote the sentence to be finished. In all these cases, we are to regulate ourselves by attending to the manner in which nature teaches us to speak, when engaged in real and earnest discourse with others. The following sentence exemplifies the <HI>suspending</HI> and the <HI>closing</HI> pauses: "Hope, the balm of life, sooths us under "every misfortune." The first and second pauses are ac∣companied by an inflection of voice, that gives the hearer an expectation of something further to complete the sense: the inflection attending the third pause, signifies that the sense is completed.</P>
<P>The preceding example is an illustration of the suspend∣ing pause, in its simple state: the following instance exhibits that pause with a degree of cadence in the voice: <Q>If content cannot remove the disquietudes of mankind, it will at least alleviate them.</Q></P>
<P>The suspending pause is often, in the same sentence, at∣tended with both the rising and the falling inflection of voice; as will be seen in this example: <Q>Moderate exer∣cise, and habitual temperance, strengthen the constitu∣tion.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rising inflection is denoted by the acute, the falling by the grave accent.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="035851_0025_1007AA7A66B36CC8"/>
As the suspending pause may be thus attended with both the rising and the falling inflection, it is the same with re∣gard to the closing pause: it admits of both. The falling inflection generally accompanies it; but it is not unfrequently connected with the rising inflection. Interrogative sentences, for instance, are often terminated in this manner: as, "Am I ungrateful?" "Is he in earnest?"</P>
<P>But where a sentence is begun by an interrogative pro∣noun or adverb, it is commonly terminated by the falling inflection: as, "What has he gained by his folly?" "Who will assist him?" "Where is the messenger?" "When did he arrive?"</P>
<P>Where two questions are united in one sentence, and con∣nected by the conjunction <HI>or,</HI> the first takes the rising, the second the falling inflection: as, <Q>Does his conduct support discipline, or destroy it?</Q></P>
<P>The rising and falling inflections must not be confounded with emphasis. Though they may often coincide, they are, in their nature, perfectly distinct. Emphasis sometimes controls those inflections.</P>
<P>The regular application of the rising and falling inflections, confers so much beauty on expression, and is so necessary to be studied by the young reader, that we shall insert a few more examples, to induce him to pay greater attention to the subject. In these instances, all the inflections are not marked. Such only are distinguished as are most striking, and will best serve to show the reader their utility and importance.</P>
<P><Q>Manufactures, trade, and agriculture, naturally em∣ploy more than nineteen parts in twenty, of the human species.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He who resigns the world, has no temptation to envy, hatred, malice, anger; but is in constant possession of a
<PB N="xxv" REF="035851_0026_1007AA7CCB923820"/>
serene mind: he who follows the pleasures of it, which are in their very nature disappointing, is in constant search of care, solicitude, remorse, and confusion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To advise the ignorant, relieve the needy, comfort the afflicted, are duties that fall in our way almost every day of our lives.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Those evil spirits, who, by long custom, have contracted in the body habits of lust and sensuality; malice and revenge; an aversion to every thing that is good, just, and laudable, are naturally seasoned and prepared for pain and misery.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am perswaded, that neither death, nor life; nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers; nor things pre∣sent, nor things to come; nor height, nor depth; nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God.</Q></P>
<P>The reader who would wish to see a minute and ingenious investigation of the nature of these inflections, and the rules by which they are governed, may consult the first volume of Walker's Elements of Elocution.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. Manner of reading Verse.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we are reading verse, there is a peculiar difficulty in making the pauses justly. The difficulty arises from the melody of verse, which dictates to the ear pauses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rests of its own; and to adjust and compound these properly with the pauses of the sense, so as neither to hurt the ear, nor offend the understanding, is so very nice a matter, that it is no wonder we so seldom meet with good readers of
<PB N="xxvi" REF="035851_0027_1007AA7E53DED290"/>
poetry. There are two kinds of pauses that belong to the melody of verse: one is, the pause at the end of the line; and the other, the caesural pause in or near the middle of it. With regard to the pause at the end of the line, which marks that strain or verse to be finished, rhyme renders this always sensible; and in some measure compels us to observe it in our pronunciation. In respect to blank verse, we ought also to read it so as to make every line sensible to the ear: for, what is the use of melody, or for what end has the poet composed in verse, if in reading his lines, we suppress his numbers, by omitting the final pause; and degrade them, by our pronunciation, into mere prose? At the same time that we attend to this pause, every appearance of sing-song and tone must be carefully guarded against. The close of the line, where it makes no pause in the meaning, ought not to be marked by such a tone as is used in finishing a sentence; but, without either fall or elevation of the voice, it should be denoted only by such a slight suspension of sound, as may distinguish the passage from one line to ano∣ther, without injuring the meaning.</P>
<P>The other kind of melodious pause, is that which falls somewhere about the middle of the verse, and divides it into two hemistichs; a pause, not so great as that which be∣longs to the close of the line, but still sensible to an ordinary ear. This, which is called the caesural pause, may fall, in English Heroic verse, after the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th syllables in the line. Where the verse is so constructed, that this caesural pause coincides with the slightest pause or division in the sense, the line can be read easily; as in the two first verses of Pope's Messiah:
<Q><L>"Ye nymphs of Solyma"! begin the song;</L>
<L>"To heavenly themes", sublimer strains belong."</L></Q>
<PB N="xxvii" REF="035851_0028_1007AA80E8AA08C0"/>
But if it shall happen that words which have such a strict and intimate connexion, as not to bear even a momentary separation, are divided from one another by this caesural pause, we then feel a sort of struggle between the sense and the sound, which renders it difficult to read such lines har∣moniously. The rule of proper pronunciation in such cases, is to regard only the pause which the sense forms; and to read the line accordingly. The neglect of the caesural pause may make the line sound somewhat unharmoniously; but the effect would be much worse, if the sense were sacrificed to the sound. For instance, in the following line of Milton,
<Q><L>—"What in me is dark,</L>
<L>"Illumine; what is low, raise and support."</L></Q>
the sense clearly dictates the pause after <HI>illumine,</HI> at the end of the third syllable, which, in reading, ought to be made accordingly; though if the melody only were to be regarded, <HI>illumine</HI> should be connected with what follows, and the pause not made till the fourth or sixth syllable. So in the follow∣ing line of Pope's Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,
<Q><L>"I sit, with sad civility I read."</L></Q>
The ear plainly points out the caesural pause as falling af∣ter <HI>sad,</HI> the fourth syllable. But it would be very bad reading to make any pause there, so as to separate <HI>sad</HI> and <HI>civility.</HI> The sense admits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o other pause than after the second syllable <HI>sit,</HI> which therefore must be the only pause made in reading this part of the sentence.</P>
<P>There is another mode of dividing some verses, by intro∣ducing what may be called demi-caesuras, which require very slight pauses; and which the reader should manage with judgment, or he will be apt to fall into an affected sing-song mode of pronouncing verses of this kind. The following lines exemplify the demi-caesura.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="xxviii" REF="035851_0029_1007AA84807A6BD8"/>
<L>" Warms' in the sun", refreshes' in the breeze,</L>
<L>" Glows' in the stars", and blossoms' in the trees;</L>
<L>" Lives through all life", extends' through all extent,</L>
<L>" Spreads' undivided", operates' unspent."</L>
</LG>
<P>Before the conclusion of this introduction, the Compiler takes the liberty to recommend to those teachers, who may favour his compilation, to exercise their pupils in discover∣ing and explaining the emphatic words, and the proper tones and pauses of every portion assigned them to read, previously to their being called out to the performance. These preparatory lessons, in which they should be regularly examined, will improve their judgment and taste; prevent the practice of reading without attention to the subject; and establish a habit of readily discovering the meaning, force, and beauty, of every sentence they peruse.</P>

<P>DILIGENCE, industry, and proper improvement of time, are material duties of the young.</P>
<P>The acquisition of knowledge is one of the most honourable occupations of youth.</P>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>NOTE.</P><P>In the first chapter, the Compiler has exhibited sentences in a great variety of construction, and in all the diversity of Punctuation. If well practised upon, he presumes they will fully prepare the young reader for the various pauses, inflections, and modulations of voice, which the succeeding pieces require. The Author's "English Exercises," under the head of Punctuation, will afford the learner additional scope for improving himself in reading sentences and paragraphs variously con∣structed.</P></NOTE>

Whatever useful or engaging endowments we pos∣sess, virtue is a necessary requisite, in order to their shining with proper lustre.</P>
<P>Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accom∣plished and flourishing manhood.</P>
<P>Sincerity and truth form the basis of every vir∣tue.</P>
<P>Truth and error, virtue and vice, are things of im∣mutable nature</P>
<P>Change and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> form the very essence of the world.</P>
<P>True happiness is of a retired nature, and an enemy to pomp and noise.</P>
<P>In order to acquire a capacity for happiness, it must be our first study to rectify inward disorders.</P>
<P>Whatever purifies, fortifies also the heart.</P>
<P>From our eagerness to grasp, we strangle and de∣stroy pleasure.</P>
<P>A temperate spirit, and moderate expectations, are the best safeguard of the mind, in this uncertain and changing state.</P>
<P>There is nothing, except simplicity of intention, and purity of principle, that can stand the test of near approach and strict examination.</P>
<P>The value of any possession is to be chiefly estimated, by the relief which it can bring us in the time of our greatest need.</P>
<P>No person who has once yielded up the govern∣ment of his mind, and given loose rein to his desires and passions, can tell how far these may carry him.</P>
<P>Tranquillity of mind is always m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t likely to be attained, when the business of the world is tempered with thoughtful and serious retreat.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="035851_0040_1007AAA312532598"/>
He who would act like a wise man, and build his house on the rock, and not on the sand, should con∣template human life, not only in the sunshine, but in the shade.</P>
<P>Let usefulness and beneficence, not ostentation and vanity, direct the train of your pursuits.</P>
<P>To maintain a steady and unbroken mind, amidst all the shocks of the world, marks a great and noble spirit.</P>
<P>Patience, by preserving composure within, resists the impression which trouble makes from without.</P>
<P>Compassionate affections, even when they draw tears from our eyes for human misery, convey satisfaction to the heart.</P>
<P>They who have nothing to give, can often afford relief to others, by imparting what they feel.</P>
<P>Our ignorance of what is to come, and of what is really good or evil, should correct anxiety about world∣ly success.</P>
<P>The veil which covers from our sight the events of succeeding years, is a veil woven by the hand of mercy.</P>
<P>The best preparation for all the uncertainties of fu∣turity, consists in a well-ordered mind, a good con∣science, and a cheerful submission to the will of Hea∣ven.</P>

<P>THE chief misfortunes that befal us in life, can be traced to some vices or follies which we have com∣mitted.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035851_0041_1007AAA585834CF8"/>
Were we to survey the chambers of sickness and distress, we should often find them peopled with the victims of intemperance and sensuality, and with the children of vicious indolence and sloth.</P>
<P>To be wise in our own eyes, to be wise in the opi∣nion of the world, and to be wise in the sight of our Creator, are three things so very different, as rarely to coincide.</P>
<P>Man, in his highest earthly glory, is but a reed float∣ing on the stream of time, and forced to follow every new direction of the current.</P>
<P>The corrupted temper, and the guilty passions of the bad, frustrate the effect of every advantage which the world confers on them.</P>
<P>The external misfortunes of life, disappointments, poverty, and sickness, are nothing in comparison of those inward distresses of mind, occasioned by folly, by passion, and by guilt.</P>
<P>No station is so high, no power so great, no cha∣racter so unblemished, as to exempt men from being attacked by rashness, malice, or envy.</P>
<P>Moral and religious instruction derives its efficacy, not so much from what men are taught to know, as from what they are brought to feel.</P>
<P>He who pretends to great sensibility towards men, and yet has no feeling for the high objects of religion, no heart to admire and adore the great Father of the universe, has reason to distrust the truth and delicacy of his sensibility.</P>
<P>When, upon rational and sober inquiry, we have established our principles, let us not suffer them to be shaken by the scoffs of the licentions, or the cavils of the sceptical.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035851_0042_1007AAA807BB1870"/>
When we observe any tendency to treat religion or morals with disrespect and levity, let us hold it to be a sure indication of a perverted understanding, or a depraved heart.</P>
<P>Every degree of guilt incurred by yielding to temp∣tation, tends to debase the mind, and to weaken the generous and benevolent principles of human nature.</P>
<P>Luxury, pride, and vanity, have frequently as much influence in corrupting the sentiments of the great, as ignorance, bigotry, and prejudice, have in misleading the opinions of the multitude.</P>
<P>Mixed as the present state is, reason and religion pronounce, that generally, if not always, there is more happiness than misery, more pleasure than pain, in the condition of man.</P>
<P>Society, when formed, requires distinctions of pro∣perty, diversity of conditions, subordination of ranks, and a multiplicity of occupations, in order to advance the general good.</P>
<P>That the temper, the sentiments, the morality, and, in general, the whole conduct and character of men, are influenced by the example and disposition of the persons with whom they associate, is a reflection which has long since passed into a proverb, and been ranked among the standing maxims of human wisdom, in all ages of the world.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<P>THE desire of improvement discovers a liberal mind; and is connected with many accomplishments, and ma∣ny virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="035851_0043_1007AAA9910DDC28"/>
Innocence confers ease and freedom on the mind; and leaves it open to every pleasing sensation.</P>
<P>Moderate and simple pleasures relish high with the temperate: in the midst of his studied refinements, the voluptuary languishes.</P>
<P>Gentleness corrects whatever is offensive in our man∣ners; and, by a constant train of humane attentions, studies to alleviate the burden of common misery.</P>
<P>That gentleness which is the characteristic of a good man, has, like every other virtue, its seat in the heart: and, let me add, nothing except what flows from the heart, can render even external manners truly pleasing.</P>
<P>Virtue, to become either vigorous or useful, must be habitually active: not breaking forth occasionally with a transient lustre, like the blaze of the come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but re∣gular in its returns, like the light of day: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>not like the aromatic gale, which sometimes feasts the sense; but like the ordinary breeze, which purifies the air, and renders it healthful.</P>
<P>The happiness of every man depends more upon the state of his own mind, than upon any one external cir∣cumstance; nay, more than upon all external things put together.</P>
<P>In no station, in no period, let us think ourselves secure from the dangers which spring from our pas∣sions. Every age, and every station they beset; from youth to grey hairs, and from the peasant to the prince.</P>
<P>Riches and pleasures are the chief temptations to criminal deeds. Yet those riches, when obtained, may very possibly overwhelm us with unforeseen miseries. Those pleasures may cut short our health and life.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035851_0044_1007AAAB1B185EF0"/>
He who is accustomed to turn aside from the world, and commune with himself in retirement, will, some∣times at least, hear the truths which the multitude do not tell him. A more sound instructer will lift his voice, and awaken within the heart those latent sug∣gestions, which the world had overpowered and sup∣pressed.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more amiable than a constant de∣sire to please; and an unwillingness to offend or hurt.</P>
<P>He that waits for an opportunity to do much at once, may breathe out his life in idle wishes; and re∣gret, in the last hour, his useless intentions and barren zeal.</P>
<P>The spirit of true religion breathes mildness and af∣fability. It gives a native, unaffected ease to the be∣haviour. It is social, kind, and cheerful: far removed from that gloomy and illiberal superstition, which clouds the brow, sharpens the temper, dejects the spirit, and teaches men to fit themselves for another world, by neglecting the concerns of this.</P>
<P>Reveal none of the secrets of thy friend. Be faith∣ful to his interests. Forsake him not in danger. Ab∣hor the thought of acquiring any advantage by his pre∣judice.</P>
<P>Man, always prosperous, would be giddy and inso∣lent; always afflicted, would be sullen or despondent. Hopes and fears, joy and sorrow, are, therefore, so blended in his life, as both to give room for worldly pursuits, and to recal, from time to time, the admoni∣tions of conscience.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV.</HEAD>
<P>TIME once past never returns: the moment which is lost, is lost for ever.</P>
<P>There is nothing on earth so stable, as to assure us of undisturbed rest; nor so powerful, as to afford us con∣stant protection.</P>
<P>The house of feasting too often becomes an avenue to the house of mourning. Short, to the licentious, is the interval between them.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to us, to form a proper es∣timate of human life; without either loading it with imaginary evils, or expecting from it greater advanta∣ges than it is able to yield.</P>
<P>Among all our corrupt passions, there is a strong and intimate connexion. When any one of them is adopt∣ed into our family, it seldom quits us until it has father∣ed upon us all its kindred.</P>
<P>Charity, like the sun, brightens every object on which it shines: a censorious disposition casts every character into the darkest shade it will bear.</P>
<P>Many men mistake the love, for the practice of vir∣tue; and are not so much good men, as the friends of goodness.</P>
<P>Genuine virtue has a language that speaks to every heart throughout the world. It is a language which is understood by all. In every region, every clime, the homage paid to it is the same. In no one sentiment were ever mankind more generally agreed.</P>
<P>The appearances of our security are frequently de∣ceitful. When our sky seems most settled and serene, in some unobserved quarter gathers the little black
<PB N="9" REF="035851_0046_1007AAB22CCEA078"/>
cloud, in which the tempest ferments, and prepares to discharge itself on our head.</P>
<P>The man of true fortitude may be compared to the castle built on a rock, which defies the attacks of sur∣rounding waters: the man of a feeble and timorous spirit, to a hut placed on the shore, which every wind shakes, and every wave overflows.</P>
<P>Nothing is so inconsistent with self-possession as vio∣lent anger. It overpowers reason; confounds our ideas; distorts the appearance, and blackens the co∣lour, of every object. By the storm which it raises within, and by the mischiefs which it occasions with∣out, it generally brings on the passionate and revenge∣ful man, greater misery than he can bring on the object of his resentment.</P>
<P>The palace of virtue has, in all ages, been represent∣ed as placed on the summit of a hill; in the ascent of which, labour is requisite, and difficulties are to be sur∣mounted; and where a conductor is needed, to direct our way, and to aid our steps.</P>
<P>In judging of others, let us always think the best, and employ the spirit of charity and candour. But in judging of ourselves, we ought to be exact and severe.</P>
<P>Let him that desires to see others happy, make haste to give while his gift can be enjoyed; and remember, that every moment of delay, takes away something from the value of his benefaction. And let him who proposes his own happiness reflect, that while he forms his purpose, the day rolls on, and "the might cometh, when no man can work."</P>
<P>To sensual persons, hardly any thing is what it appears to be: and what flatters most, is always farth∣est from reality. There are voices which sing around
<PB N="10" REF="035851_0047_1007AAB3B94F5F18"/>
them; but whose strains allure to ruin. There is a banquet spread, where poison is in every dish. There is a couch which invites them to repose; but to slumber upon it, is death.</P>
<P>If we would judge whether a man is really happy, it is not solely to his houses and lands, to his equipage and his retinue, we are to look. Unless we could see farther, and discern what joy, or what bitterness, his heart feels, we can pronounce nothing concerning him.</P>
<P>The book is well written; and I have perused it with pleasure and profit. It shows, first, that true de∣votion is rational and well founded; next, that it is of the highest importance to every other part of religion and virtue; and, lastly, that it is most conducive to our happiness.</P>
<P>There is certainly no greater felicity, than to be able to look back on a life usefully and virtuously employed; to trace our own progress in existence, by such tokens as excite neither shame nor sorrow. It ought therefore to be the care of those who wish to pass the last hours with comfort, to lay up such a treasure of pleasing ideas, as shall support the expenses of that time, which is to depend wholly upon the fund already acquired.</P>

<P>WHAT avails the show of external liberty, to one who has lost the government of himself?</P>
<P>He that cannot live well to-day, (says Martial,) will be less qualified to live well to-morrow.</P>
<P>Can we esteem that man prosperous, who is raised
<PB N="11" REF="035851_0048_1007AAB6694AE088"/>
to a situation which flatters his passions, but which cor∣rupts his principles, disorders his temper, and, finally, oversets his virtue?</P>
<P>What misery does the vicious man secretly endure!—Adversity! how blunt are all the arrows of thy quiver, in comparison with those of guilt!</P>
<P>When we have no pleasure in goodness, we may with certainty conclude the reason to be, that our pleasure is all derived from an opposite quarter.</P>
<P>How strangely are the opinions of men altered, by a change in their condition!</P>
<P>How many have had reason to be thankful, for being disappointed in designs which they earnestly pursued, but which, if successfully accomplished, they have after∣wards seen, would have occasioned their ruin?</P>
<P>What are the actions which afford in the remem∣brance a rational satisfaction? Are they the pursuits of sensual pleasure, the riots of jollity, or the displays of show and vanity? No: I appeal to your hearts, my friends, if what you recollect with most pleasure are not the innocent, the virtuous, the honourable parts of your past life.</P>
<P>The present employment of time should frequently be an object of thought. About what are we now bu∣sied? What is the ultimate scope of our present pursuits and cares? Can we justify them to ourselves? Are they likely to produce any thing that will survive the mo∣ment, and bring forth some fruit for futurity?</P>
<P>Is it not strange, (says an ingenious writer,) that some persons should be so delicate as not to bear a dis∣agreeable picture in the house, and yet, by their beha∣viour, force every face they see about them, to wear the doom of uneasiness and discontent?</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035851_0049_1007AAB9FA2E5538"/>
If we are now in health, peace, and safety; without any particular or uncommon evils to afflict our condi∣tion; what more can we reasonably look for in this vain and uncertain world? How little can the greatest prosperity add to such a state? Will any future situation ever make us happy, if now, with so few causes of grief, we imagine ourselves miserable? The evil lies in the state of our mind, not in our condition of fortune; and by no alteration of circumstances is like∣ly to be remedied.</P>
<P>When the love of unwarrantable pleasures, and of vicious companions, is allowed to amuse young persons, to ingross their time, and to stir up their passions; the day of ruin,—let them take heed, and beware!—the day of irrecoverable ruin, begins to draw nigh. Fortune is squandered; health is broken; friends are offended, affronted, estranged; aged parents, perhaps, sent af∣flicted and mourning to the dust.</P>
<P>On whom does time hang so heavily, as on the sloth∣ful and lazy? To whom are the hours so lingering? Who are so often devoured with spleen, and obliged to fly to every expedient, which can help them to get rid of themselves? Instead of producing tranquillity, indo∣lence produces a fretful restlessness of mind; gives rise to cravings which are never satisfied; nourishes a sickly effeminate delicacy, which sours and corrupts every pleasure.</P>

<P>WE have seen the husbandman scattering his se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon the furrowed ground! It springs up, is gathered
<PB N="13" REF="035851_0050_1007AABD244AAA28"/>
into his barns, and crowns his labours with joy and plenty.—Thus the man who distributes his fortune with generosity and prudence, is amply repaid by the grati∣tude of those whom he obliges; by the approbation of his own mind; and by the favour of Heaven.</P>
<P>Temperance, by fortifying the mind and body, leads to happiness: intemperance, by enervating them, ends generally in misery.</P>
<P>Title and ancestry render a good man more illustri∣ous; but an ill one, more contemptible. Vice is infa∣mous, though in a prince; and virtue honourable, though in a peasant.</P>
<P>An elevated genius, employed in little things, ap∣pears (to use the simile of Longinus) like the sun in his evening declination: he remits his splendour, but retains his magnitude; and pleases more, though he dazzles less.</P>
<P>If envious people were to ask themselves, whether they would exchange their entire situations with the persons envied, (I mean their minds, passions, notions, as well as their persons, fortunes, and dignities)—I pre∣sume the self-love common to human nature, would generally make them prefer their own condition.</P>
<P>We have obliged some persons:—very well!—what would we have more? Is not the consciousness of do∣ing good, a sufficient reward?</P>
<P>Do not hurt yourselves or others, by the pursuit of pleasure. Consult your whole nature. Consider your∣selves not only as sensitive, but as rational beings; not only as rational, but social; not only as social, but immortal.</P>
<P>Art thou poor?—Show thyself active and industrious, peaceable and contented. Art thou wealthy?—Show
<PB N="14" REF="035851_0051_1007AABEACF58580"/>
thyself beneficent and charitable, condescending and humane.</P>
<P>Though religion removes not all the evils of life, though it promises no continuance of undisturbed pros∣perity, (which indeed it were not salutary for man al∣ways to enjoy,) yet, if it mitigates the evils which ne∣cessarily belong to our state, it may justly be said to give "rest to them who labour and are heavy laden."</P>
<P>What a smiling aspect does the love of parents and children, of brothers and sisters, of friends and rela∣tions, give to every surrounding object, and every re∣turning day! With what a lustre does it gild even the small habitation, where such placid intercourse dwells! where such scenes of heartfelt satisfaction succeed unin∣terruptedly to one another!</P>
<P>How many clear marks of benevolent intention ap∣pear every where around us! What a profusion of beau∣ty and ornament is poured forth on the face of nature! What a magnificent spectacle presented to the view of man! What supply contrived for his wants! What a variety of objects set before him, to gratify his senses, to employ his understanding, to entertain his imagina∣tion, to cheer and gladden his heart!</P>
<P>The hope of future happiness is a perpetual source of consolation to good men. Under trouble, it soothes their minds; amidst temptation, it supports their vir∣tue; and, in their dying moments, enables them to say, "O death! where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory?"</P>

<P>AGESILAUS, king of Sparta, being asked, "What things he thought most proper for boys to learn," an∣swered, "Those which they ought to practise when they come to be men." A wiser than Agesilaus has inculcated the same sentiment: "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."</P>
<P>An Italian philosopher expressed in his motto, that "time was his estate." An estate, indeed, which will produce nothing without cultivation; but which will always abundantly repay the labours of industry, and satisfy the most extensive desires, if no part of it be suffered to lie waste by negligence: to be over-run with noxious plants; or laid out for show, rather than use.</P>
<P>When Aristotle was asked, "What a man could gain by telling a falsehood," he replied, "Not to be cre∣dited when he speaks the truth."</P>
<P>L'Estrange, in his Fables, tells us, that a number of frolicksome boys were one day watching frogs, at the side of a pond; and that, as any of them put their beads above the water, they pelted them down again with stones. One of the frogs, appealing to the humanity of the boys, made this striking observation: "Chil∣dren, you do not consider, that though this may be sport to you, it is death to us."</P>
<P>Sully, the great statesman of France, always retained at his table, in his most prosperous days, the same fru∣gality to which he had been accustomed in early life. He was frequently reproached, by the courtiers, for this simplicity; but he used to reply to them, in the words
<PB N="16" REF="035851_0053_1007AAC5EB517E28"/>
of an ancient philosopher: "If the guests are men of sense, there is sufficient for them: if they are not, I can very well dispense with their company."</P>
<P>Socrates, though primarily attentive to the culture of his mind, was not negligent of his external appear∣ance. His cleanliness resulted from those ideas of or∣der and decency, which governed all his actions: and the care which he took of his health, from his desire to preserve his mind free and tranquil.</P>
<P>Eminently pleasing and honourable was the friend∣ship between David and Jonathan. "I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan," said the plaintive and surviving David; "very pleasant hast thou been to me: thy love for me was wonderful; passing the love of women."</P>
<P>Sir Philip Sidney, at the battle near Zutphen, was wounded by a musket-ball, which broke the bone of his thigh. He was carried about a mile and a half, to the camp; and being faint with the loss of blood, and probably parched with thirst, through the heat of the weather, he called for drink. It was immediately brought to him: but, as he was putting the vessel to his mouth, a poor wounded soldier, who happened at that instant to be carried by him, looked up to it with wishful eyes. The gallant and generous Sidney took the bottle from his mouth, and delivered it to the soldier, saying, "Thy necessity is yet greater than mine."</P>
<P>Alexander the Great demanded of a pirate whom he had taken, by what right he infested the seas? "By the same right," replied he, "that Alexander enslaves the world. But I am called a robber, because I have only one small vessel; and he is styled a conqueror, be∣cause
<PB N="17" REF="035851_0054_1007AAC8A1AF42B0"/>
he commands great fleets and armies." We too often judge of men by the splendour, and not by the merit of their actions.</P>
<P>Antoninus Pius, the Roman Emperour, was an ami∣able and good man. When any of his courtiers at∣tempted to inflame him with a passion for military glory, he used to answer: "That he more desired the preservation of one subject, than the destruction of a thousand enemies."</P>
<P>Men are too often ingenious in making themselves miserable, by aggravating to their own fancy, beyond bounds, all the evils which they endure. They com∣pare themselves with none but those whom they ima∣gine to be more happy; and complain, that upon them alone has fallen the whole load of human sorrows. Would they look with a more impartial eye on the world, they would see themselves surrounded with suf∣ferers; and find that they are only drinking out of that mixed cup which Providence has prepared for all.—"I will restore thy daughter again to life," said the eastern sage, to a prince who grieved immoderately for the loss of a beloved child, "provided thou art able to engrave on her tomb, the names of three persons who have never mourned." The prince made inquiry after such persons; but found the inquiry vain, and was silent.</P>

<P>THAT every day has its pains and sorrows, is univer∣sally experienced, and almost universally confessed.—But let us not attend only to mournful truths: if we look impartially about us, we shall find, that every day has likewise its pleasures and its joys.</P>
<P>We should cherish sentiments of charity towards all men. The Author of all good nourishes much piety and virtue in hearts that are unknown to us; and beholds repentance ready to spring up among many, whom we consider as reprobates.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="035851_0057_1007AAD0032367E0"/>
No one ought to consider himself as insignificant in the sight of his Creator. In our several stations, we are all sent forth to be labourers in the vineyard of our heavenly Father. Every man has his work allotted, his talent committed to him; by the due improvement of which he may, in one way or other, serve God, promote virtue, and be useful in the world.</P>
<P>The love of praise should be preserved under proper subordination to the principle of duty. In itself, it is a useful motive to action; but when allowed to extend its influence too far, it corrupts the whole character; and produces guilt, disgrace, and misery. To be en∣tirely destitute of it, is a defect. To be governed by it, is depravity. The proper adjustment of the several principles of action in human nature, is a matter that deserves our highest attention. For when any one of them becomes either too weak or too strong, it en∣dangers both our virtue and our happiness.</P>
<P>The desires and passions of a vicious man, having once obtained an unlimited sway, trample him under their feet. They make him feel that he is subject to various, contradictory, and imperious masters, who often pull him different ways. His soul is rendered the receptacle of many repugnant and jarring disposi∣tions; and resembles some barbarous country cantoned out into different principalities, which are continually waging war on one another.</P>
<P>Diseases, poverty, disappointment, and shame, are far from being, in every instance, the unavoidable doom of man. They are much more frequently the offspring of his own misguided choice. Intemperance en∣genders disease, sloth produces poverty, pride creates disappointments, and dishonesty exposes to shame.
<PB N="21" REF="035851_0058_1007AAD290272D78"/>
The ungoverned passions of men betray them into a thousand follies; their follies into crimes; and their crimes into misfortunes.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the many distresses which abound in human life; on the scanty proportion of happiness which any man is here allowed to enjoy; on the small difference which the diversity of fortune makes on that scanty proportion; it is surprising, that envy should ever have been a prevalent passion among men, much more that it should have prevailed among Christians. Where so much is suffered in common, little room is left for envy. There is more occasion for pity and sympathy, and inclination to assist each other.</P>
<P>At out first setting out in life, when yet unacquainted with the world and its snares, when every pleasure enchants with its smile, and every object shines with the gloss of novelty; let us beware of the seducing appearances which surround us; and recollect what others have suffered from the power of headstrong de∣sire. If we allow any passion, even though it be esteemed innocent, to acquire an absolute ascendant, our inward peace will be impaired. But if any which has the taint of guilt, take early possession of our mind, we may date, from that moment, the ruin of our tran∣quillity.</P>
<P>Every man has some darling passion, which generally affords the first introduction to vice. The irregular gratifications into which it occasionally seduces him, appear under the form of venial weaknesses; and are indulged, in the beginning, with scrupulousness and reserve. But, by longer practice, these restraints weaken, and the power of habit grows. One vice brings in another to its aid. By a sort of natural

<P>WHENCE arises the misery of this present world? It is not owing to our cloudy atmosphere, our changing seasons, and inclement skies. It is not owing to the debility of our bodies, or to the unequal distribution of the goods of fortune. Amidst all disadvantages of this kind, a pure, a stedfast, and enlightened mind, pos∣sessed of strong virtue, could enjoy itself in peace, and smile at the impotent assaults of fortune and the ele∣ments. It is within ourselves that misery has fixed its seat. Our disordered hearts, our guilty passions, our violent prejudices, and misplaced desires, are the in∣struments of the trouble which we endure. These sharpen the darts which adversity would otherwise point in vain against us.</P>
<P>While the vain and the licentious are revelling in the midst of extravagance and riot, how little do they think of those scenes of sore distress which are passing at that moment throughout the world: multitudes struggling for a poor subsistence, to support the wife and the chil∣dren whom they love, and who look up to them with eager eyes for that bread which they can hardly pro∣cure; multitudes groaning under sickness in desolate cottages, untended and unmourned; many, apparently in a better situation of life, pining away in secret with concealed griefs; families weeping over the beloved friends whom they have lost, or, in all the bitterness
<PB N="23" REF="035851_0060_1007AAD5AA465F58"/>
of anguish, bidding those who are just expiring the last adieu.</P>
<P>Never adventure on too near an approach to what is evil. Familiarise not yourselves with it, in the slightest instances, without fear. Listen with reve∣rence to every reprehension of conscience; and pre∣serve the most quick and accurate sensibility to right and wrong. If ever your moral impressions begin to decay, and your natural abhorrence of guilt to lessen, you have ground to dread that the ruin of virtue is fast approaching.</P>
<P>By disappointments and trials the violence of our passions is tamed, and our minds are formed to sobriety and reflection. In the varieties of life, occasioned by the vicissitudes of worldly fortune, we are inured to habits both of the active and the suffering virtues. How much soever we complain of the vanity of the world, facts plainly show, that if its vanity were less, it could not answer the purpose of salutary discipline. Unsa∣tisfactory as it is, its pleasures are still too apt to cor∣rupt our hearts. How fatal then must the consequen∣ces have been, had it yielded us more complete enjoy∣ment! If, with all its troubles, we are in danger of being too much attached to it, how entirely would it have seduced our affections, if no troubles had been mingled with its pleasures!</P>
<P>In seasons of distress or difficulty, to abandon our∣selves to dejection, carries no mark of a great or a wor∣thy mind. Instead of sinking under trouble, and de∣claring "that his soul is weary of life," it becomes a wise and a good man, in the evil day, with firmness to maintain his post; to bear up against the storm; to have recourse to those advantages which, in the worst
<PB N="24" REF="035851_0061_1007AADA9071B780"/>
of times, are always left to integrity and virtue; and never to give up the hope that better days may yet arise.</P>
<P>How many young persons have at first set out in the world with excellent dispositions of heart; generous, charitable and humane; kind to their friends, and amiable among all with whom they had intercourse! And yet, how often have we seen all those fair appear∣ances unhappily blasted in the progress of life, mere∣ly through the influence of loose and corrupting plea∣sures; and those very persons, who promised once to be blessings to the world, sunk down, in the end, to be the burden and nuisance of society!</P>
<P>The most common propensity of mankind, is, to store futurity with whatever is agreeable to them; especi∣ally in those periods of life, when imagination is lively, and hope is ardent. Looking forward to the year now beginning, they are ready to promise themselves much, from the foundations of prosperity which they have laid; from the friendships and connexions which they have secured; and from the plans of conduct which they have formed. Alas! how deceitful do all these dreams of happiness often prove! While many are saying in secret to their hearts, "To-morrow shall be as this day, and more abundantly," we are obliged in return to say to them; "Boast not yourselves of to∣morrow, for you know not what a day may bring forth!</P>

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. No Rank or Possessions can make the guilty Mind happy.</HEAD>
<P>DIONYSIUS, the tyrant of Sicily, was far from being happy, though he possessed great riches, and all the pleasures which wealth and power could procure. Damocles, one of his flatterers, deceived by these spe∣cious appearances of happiness, took occasion to com∣pliment him on the extent of his power, his treasures, and royal magnificence; and declared that no monarch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad ever been greater or happier than Dionysius.</P>
<P>Hast thou a mind, Damocles," says the King, "to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ste this happiness; and to know, by experience, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enjoyments are, of which thou hast so high an idea?" Damocles, with joy, accepted the offer. The King ordered that a royal banquet should be prepared, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gilded sofa, covered with rich embroidery, placed for his favourite. Side-boards, loaded with gold and silver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late of immense value, were arranged in the apart∣ment. Pages of extraordinary beauty were ordered to attend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> table, and to obey his commands with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tmost readiness, and the most profound submission. Fragrant ointments, chaplets of flowers, and rich per∣fumes, were added to the entertainment. The table was loaded with the most exquisite delicacies of every kind. Damocles, intoxicated with pleasure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="035851_0063_1007AADEB4D9A9C0"/>
himself amongst superior beings. But in the midst of all this happiness, as he lay indulging himself in state, he sees let down from the ceiling, exactly over his head, a glittering sword hung by a single hair. The sight of impending destruction put a speedy end to his joy and revelling. The pomp of his attendance, the glitter of the carved plate, and the delicacy of the viands, cease to afford him any pleasure. He dreads to stretch forth his hand to the table. He throws off the garland of roses. He hastens to remove from his dangerous situation; and earnestly entreats the king to restore him to his former humble condition, having no desire to enjoy any longer a happiness so terrible.</P>
<P>By this device, Dionysius intimated to Damocles, how miserable he was in the midst of all his treasures; and in possession of all the honours and enjoyments which royalty could bestow.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Change of external Condition often adverse to Virtue.</HEAD>
<P>IN the days of Joram, King of Israel, flourished the prophet Elisha. His character was so eminent, and his same so widely spread, that Benhadad the King of Syria, though an idolater, sent to consult him, concern∣ing the issue of a distemper which threatened his life. The messenger employed on this occasion was Hazael, who appears to have been one of the princes, or chief men of the Syrian court. Charged with rich gifts from the king, he presents himself before the prophet; and accosts him in terms of the highest respect. During the conference which they held together, Elisha fixed his eye
<PB N="27" REF="035851_0064_1007AAE042959B18"/>
stedfastly on the countenance of Hazael; and discerning, by a prophetic spirit, his future tyranny and cruelty, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not contain himself from bursting into a flood of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears. When Hazael, in surprise, inquired into the cause of this sudden emotion, the prophet plainly in∣forms him of the crimes and barbarities, which he fore∣saw that hereafter he would commit. The soul of Ha∣zael abhorred, at this time, the thoughts of cruelty. Uncorrupted, as yet, by ambition or greatness, his in∣dignation rose at being thought capable of such savage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions, as the prophet had mentioned; and, with much warmth, he replies; "But what? is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Elisha makes no return, but to point out a remarkable change, which was to take place in his condition; "The Lord hath known me that thou shalt be king over Syria." In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourse of time, all that had been predicted came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Hazael ascended the throne, and ambition took possession of his heart. "He smote the children of Is∣rael in all their coasts. He oppressed them during all the days of king Jehoahaz:" and, from what is left on record of his actions, he plainly appears to have proved what the prophet foresaw him to be, a man of vio∣lence, cruelty, and blood.</P>
<P>In this passage of history, an object is presented, which deserves our serious attention. We behold a man who, in one state of life, could not look upon certain crimes without surprise and horror; who knew so little of himself, as to believe it impossible for him ever to be concerned in committing them; that same man, by a change of condition, and an unguarded state of mind, transformed in all his sentiments; and as he rose in greatness rising also in guilt; till at last he com∣pleted

that whole character of iniquity, which he once detested.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Haman; or, The Misery of Pride.</HEAD>
<P>AHASUERUS, who is supposed to be the prince known among the Greek historians by the name of Artaxerxes, had advanced to the chief dignity in his kingdom, Haman, an Amalekite, who inherited all the ancient enmity of his race to the Jewish nation. He appears, from what is recorded of him, to have been a very wicked minister. Raised to greatness without merit, he employed his power solely for the gratification of his passions. As the honours which he possessed were next to royal, his pride was every day fed with that servile homage, which is peculiar to Asiatic courts; and all the servants of the king pro∣strated themselves before him. In the midst of this general adulation, one person only stooped not to Ha∣man. This was Mordecai the Jew; who, knowing this Amalekite to be an enemy to the people of God, and, with virtuous indignation, despising that inso∣lence of prosperity with which he saw him lifted up, "bowed not, nor did him reverence." On this ap∣pearance of disrespect from Mordecai, Haman "was full of wrath: but he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone." Personal revenge was not suffi∣cient to satisfy him. So violent and black were his pas∣sions, that he resolved to exterminate the whole nation to which Mordecai belonged. Abusing, for this cruel purpose, the favour of his credulous sovereign, he ob∣tained a decree to be sent forth, that, against a certain
<PB N="29" REF="035851_0066_1007AAE7DD056D98"/>
day, all the Jews throughout the Persian dominions should be put to the sword. Meanwhile, confident of success, and blind to approaching ruin, he continued exulting in his prosperity. Invited by Ahasuerus to a royal banquet, which Esther the queen had prepared, "he went forth that day joyful, and with a glad heart." But behold how slight an incident was sufficient to poi∣son his joy! As he went forth, he saw Mordecai in the king's gate; and observed, that he still refused to do him homage: "He stood not up, nor was moved for him;" although he well knew the formidable designs, which Haman was preparing to execute. One private man, who despised his greatness, and disdained sub∣mission, while a whole kingdom trembled before him; one spirit, which the utmost stretch of his power could neither subdue nor humble, blasted his triumphs. His whole soul was shaken with a storm of passion. Wrath, pride, and desire of revenge, rose into fury. With difficulty he restrained himself in public; but as soon as he came to his own house, he was forced to disclose the agony of his mind. He gathered together his friends and family, with Zeresh his wife. "He told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and of all the things wherein the king had promoted him; and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. He said, moreover, Yea, Esther the queen suffered no man to come in with the king, to the banquet that she had prepared, but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited to her with the king." After all this pre∣amble, what is the conclusion?—"Yet all this avail∣eth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="035851_0067_1007AAE965AD2058"/>
The sequel of Haman's history I shall not now pur∣sue. It might afford matter for much instruction, by the conspicuous justice of God in his fall and punish∣ment. But contemplating only the singular situation, in which the expressions just quoted present him, and the violent agitation of his mind which they display, the following reflections naturally arise: how miserable is vice, when one guilty passion creates so much tor∣ment! how unavailing is prosperity, when, in the height of it, a single disappointment can destroy the relish of all its pleasures! how weak is human nature, which, in the absence of real, is thus prone to form to itself imaginary woes!</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Ortogrul; or, The Vanity of Riches.</HEAD>
<P>As Ortogrul of Basra, was one day wandering along the streets of Bagdat, musing on the varieties of mer∣chandise, which the shops offered to his view; and ob∣serving the different occupations which busied the mul∣titudes on every side, he was awakened from the tran∣quillity of meditation, by a crowd that obstructed his passage. He raised his eyes, and saw the chief vizier, who, having returned from the divan, was entering his palace.</P>
<P>Ortogrul mingled with the attendants; and being sup∣posed to have some petition for the vizier, was permitted to enter. He surveyed the spaciousness of the apart∣ments, admired the walls hung with golden tapestry, and the floors covered with silken carpets; and de∣spised the simple neatness of his own little habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="035851_0068_1007AAEAF1974C18"/>
"Surely," said he to himself, "this palace is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat of happiness; where pleasure succeeds to pleasure, and discontent and sorrow can have no admission. Whatever nature has provided for the delight of sense, is here spread forth to be enjoyed. What can mortals hope or imagine, which the master of this palace has not obtained? The dishes of luxury cover his table; the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java, and sleeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges. He speaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he wishes, and his wish is gratified; all whom he sees obey him, and all whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hears flatter him. How different, Ortogrul, is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torments of unsatisfied desire; and who hast no amusement in thy power, that can withhold thee from thy own re∣flections! They tell thee that thou art wise; but what does wisdom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor; and the wise have very little power of flattering themselves. That man is surely the most wretched of the sons of wretchedness, who lives with his own faults and follies always before him; and who has none to reconcile him to himself by praise and veneration. I have long sought content, and have not found it; I will from this moment endeavour to be rich."</P>
<P>Full of his new resolution, he shut himself in his chamber for six months, to deliberate how he should grow rich. He sometimes purposed to offer himself as a counsellor to one of the kings of India; and some∣times resolved to dig for diamonds in the mines of Gol∣conda. One day, after some hours passed in violent fluctuation of opinion, sleep insensibly seized him in his chair. He dreamed that he was ranging a desert
<PB N="32" REF="035851_0069_1007AAEEE3A3EAA8"/>
country, in search of some one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he stood on the top of a hill, shaded with cypress, in doubt whither to direct his steps, his father appeared on a sudden standing before him. "Ortogrul," said the old man, "I know thy perplexity; listen to thy father; turn thine eye on the opposite mountain." Ortogrul looked, and saw a tor∣rent tumbling down the rocks, roaring with the noise of thunder, and scattering its foam on the impending woods. "Now," said his father, "behold the valley that lies between the hills." Ortogrul looked, and espied a little well, out of which issued a small rivulet. "Tell me now," said his father, "dost thou wish for sudden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent; or for a slow and gradual increase, resembling the rill gliding from the well?" "Let me be quickly rich," said Ortogrul; "let the golden stream be quick and violent." "Look round thee," said his father, "once again." Ortogrul looked, and per∣ceived the channel of the torrent dry and dusty; but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake, which the supply, slow and constant, kept always full. He awoke, and determined to grow rich by silent profit, and persevering industry.</P>
<P>Having sold his patrimony, he engaged in merchan∣dise; and in twenty years purchased lands, on which he raised a house, equal in sumptuousness to that of the vizier, to which he invited all the ministers of Plea∣sure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity which he had imagined riches able to afford. Leisure soon made him weary of himself, and he longed to be persuaded that he was great and happy. He was courteous and liberal; he gave all that approached him hopes of plea∣sing
<PB N="33" REF="035851_0070_1007AAF2C60CC078"/>
him, and all who should please him, hopes of be∣ing rewarded. Every art of praise was tried, and every source of adulatory fiction was exhausted. Ortogrul heard his flatterers without delight, because he found himself unable to believe them. His own heart told him its frailties; his own understanding reproached him with his faults. "How long," said he, with a deep sigh, "have I been labouring in vain to amass wealth, which at last is useless! Let no man hereafter wish to be rich, who is already too wise to be flattered!"</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Lady Jane Grey.</HEAD>
<P>THIS excellent personage was descended from the Royal Line of England by both her parents.</P>
<P>She was carefully educated in the principles of the Reformation; and her wisdom and virtue rendered her a shining example to her sex. But it was her lot to continue only a short period on this stage of being; for, in early life, she fell a sacrifice to the wild ambition of the Duke of Northumberland; who promoted a mar∣riage between her and his son, Lord Guilford Dudley; and raised her to the throne of England, in opposition to the rights of Mary and Elizabeth. At the time of their marriage, she was only about eighteen years of age, and her husband was also very young: a season of life very unequal to oppose the interested views of artful and aspiring men; who, instead of exposing them to danger, should have been the protectors of their inno∣cence and youth.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="035851_0071_1007AAF44F64DF48"/>
This extraordinary young person, besides the solid endowments of piety and virtue, possessed the most en∣gaging disposition, the most accomplished parts; and being of an equal age with King Edward VI, she had received all her education with him, and seemed even to possess a greater facility in acquiring every part of manly and classical literature. She had attained a knowledge of the Roman and Greek languages, as well as of several modern tongues; had passed most of her time in an application to learning; and expressed a great indifference for other occupations and amuse∣ments usual with her sex and station. Roger Ascham, tutor to the Lady Elizabeth, having at one time paid her a visit, found her employed in reading Plato, while the rest of the family were engaged in a party of hunt∣ing in the park; and upon his admiring the singularity of her choice, she told him, that she "received more pleasure from that author, than the others could reap from all their sport and gaiety."—Her heart, replete with this love of literature and serious studies, and with tenderness towards her husband, who was deserv∣ing of her affection, had never opened itself to the flattering allurements of ambition; and the informa∣tion of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advancement to the throne was by no means agreeable to her. She even refused to accept of the crown; pleaded the preferable right of the two prin∣cesses; expressed her dread of the consequences at∣tending an enterprise so dangerous, not to say so cri∣minal; and desired to remain in that private station in which she was born. Overcome at last with the entreaties, rather than reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of her father and father-in-law, and, above all, of her husband, she sub∣mitted to their will, and was prevailed on to relinquish
<PB N="35" REF="035851_0072_1007AAF6E50DFA28"/>
her own judgment. But this honour was of very short continuance. The nation declared for Queen Mary; and the Lady Jane, after wearing the vain pageantry of a crown during ten days, returned to a private life, with much more satisfaction than she felt when the royalty was tendered to her.</P>
<P>Queen Mary, who appears to have been incapable of generosity or clemency, determined to remove every person, from whom the least danger could be appre∣hended. Warning, was, therefore, given the Lady Jane to prepare for death; a doom which she had ex∣pected, and which the innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to which she had been exposed, render∣ed no unwelcome news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under colour of tender mercy to the prisoner's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul, induced her to send priests, who molested her with perpetual disputation; and even a reprieve of three days was granted her, in hopes that she would be persuaded, during that time, to pay, by a timely conversion to Popery, some regard to her eternal welfare. The Lady Jane had presence of mind, in those melancholy circumstances, not only to defend her religion by solid arguments, but also to write a letter to her sister, in the Greek language; in which, besides sending her a copy of the Scriptures in that tongue, she exhorted her to maintain, in every fortune, a like steady perseverance. On the day of her execution; her husband, Lord Guilford, desired permission to see her; but she refused her consent, and sent him word, that the tenderness of their parting would overcome the fortitude of both; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would too much unbend their minds from that constancy, which their approaching end required of them.—Their separation, she said,

<P>It had been intended to execute the Lady Jane and Lord Guilford together on the same scaffold, at Tower-hill; but the council, dreading the compassion of the people for their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble birth, changed their orders, and gave directions that she should be beheaded within the verge of the Tower. She saw her husband led to execution; and having given him from the window some token of her remembrance, she waited with tranquillity till her own appointed hour should bring her to a like fate. She even saw his headless body carried back in a cart; and found herself more confirmed by the reports, which she heard of the constancy of his end, than shaken by so tender and melancholy a spectacle. Sir John Gage, constable of the Tower, when he led her to execution, desired her to bestow on him some small present, which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of her. She gave him her table-book, in which she had just written three sentences, on seeing her husband's dead body; one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in English. The purport of them was, "that human justice was against his body, but the Divine Mercy would be favourable to his soul: and that if her fault deserved punishment, her youth, at least, and her imprudence, were worthy of excuse; and that God and posterity, she trusted, would show her father." On the scaffold, she made a speech to the bye-standers, in which the mildness of her disposition led her to take the blame
<PB N="37" REF="035851_0074_1007AAFDC0479FF0"/>
entirely on herself, without uttering one complaint against the severity with which she had been treated. She said, that her offence was, not having laid her hand upon the crown, but not rejecting it with suf∣ficient constancy: that she had less erred through am∣bition than through reverence to her parents, whom she had been taught to respect and obey: that she willingly received death, as the only satisfaction which she could now make to the injured state; and though her infringement of the laws had been constrained, she would show, by her voluntary submission to their sentence, that she was desirous to atone for that dis∣obedience, into which too much filial piety had be∣trayed her: that she had justly deserved this punishment for being made the instrument, though the unwilling instrument, of the ambition of others: and that the story of her life, she hoped, might at least be useful, by proving that innocence excuses not great misdeeds, if they tend any way to the destruction of the common∣wealth.—After uttering these words, she caused herself to be disrobed by her women, and with a steady, serene countenance submitted herself to the executioner.</P>

<P>IN that season of the year, when the serenity of the sky, the various fruits which cover the ground the discoloured foliage of the trees, and all the sweet, but fading graces of inspiring autumn, open the mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

benevolence, and dispose it for contemplation, I was wandering in a beautiful and romantic country, till curiosity began to give way to weariness; and I sat down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with moss; where the rustling of the falling leaves, the dashing of waters, and the hum of the distant city, soothed my mind into the most perfect tranquillity; and sleep in∣sensibly stole upon me, as I was indulging the agree∣able reveries, which the objects around me naturally inspired.</P>
<P>I immediately found myself in a vast extended plain, in the middle of which arose a mountain higher than I had before any conception of. It was covered with a multitude of people, chiefly youth; many of whom pressed forward with the liveliest expression of ardour in their countenance, though the way was in many places steep and difficult. I observed, that those who had but just begun to climb the hill, thought themselves not far from the top; but as they proceeded, new hills were continually rising to their view: and the summit of the highest they could before discern seemed but the foot of another, till the mountain at length appeared to lose itself in the clouds. As I was gazing on these things with astonishment, a friendly instructer suddenly appeared: "The mountain before thee," said he, "is the Hill of Science. On the top is the temple of Truth, whose head is above the clouds, and a veil of pure light covers her face. Observe the progress of her votaries; be silent and attentive."</P>
<P>After I had noticed a variety of objects, I turned my eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the steep ascent; and observed amongst them a youth of a lively look, a piercing eye, and something fiery and
<PB N="39" REF="035851_0076_1007AB01E991F3D8"/>
irregular in all his motions. His name was Genius. He darted like an eagle up the mountain; and left his companions gazing after him with envy and admira∣tion: but his progress was unequal, and interrupted by a thousand caprices. When Pleasure warbled in the valley, he mingled in her train. When Pride beckoned towards the precipice, he ventured to the tottering edge. He delighted in devious and untried paths; and made so many excursions from the road, that his feebler companions often outstripped him. I observed that the Muses beheld him with partiality; but Truth often frowned and turned aside her face. While Genius was thus wasting his strength in eccen∣tric flights, I saw a person of a very different appear∣ance, named Application. He crept along with a slow and unremitting pace, his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain, patiently removing every stone that ob∣structed his way, till he saw most of those below him, who had at first derided his slow and toilsome progress. Indeed, there were few who ascended the hill with equal, and uninterrupted steadiness; for, besides the difficulties of the way, they were continually solicited to turn aside, by a numerous crowd of Appetites, Passions, and Pleasures, whose importunity, when once complied with, they became less and less able to resist: and though they often returned to the path, the asperities of the road were more severely felt; the hill appeared more steep and rugged; the fruits which were wholesome and refreshing, seemed harsh and ill-tasted; their sight grew dim; and their feet tript at every little obstruction.</P>
<P>I saw, with some surprise, that the Muses, whose business was to cheer and encourage those who were
<PB N="40" REF="035851_0077_1007AB04D5549DF8"/>
toiling up the ascent, would often sing in the bowers of Pleasure, and accompany those who were enticed away at the call of the Passions. They accompanied them, however, but a little way; and always forsook them when they lost sight of the hill. The tyrants then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives; and led them away, without resistance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the mansions of Misery. Amongst the innumerable seducers, who were endeavouring to draw away the votaries of Truth from the path of Science, there was one, so little formidable in her ap∣pearance, and so gentle and languid in her attempts, that I should scarcely have taken notice of her, but for the numbers she had imperceptibly loaded with her chains. Indolence, (for so she was called,) far from proceeding to open hostilities, did not attempt to turn their feet out of the path, but contented herself with retarding their progress; and the purpose she could not force them to abandon, she persuaded them to delay. Her touch had a power like that of the torpedo, which withered the strength of those who came within its in∣fluence. Her unhappy captives still turned their faces towards the temple, and always hoped to arrive there; but the ground seemed to slide from beneath their feet, and they found themselves at the bottom, before they suspected they had changed their place. The placid serenity, which at first appeared in their countenance, changed by degrees into a melancholy languor, which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom, as they glided down the stream of Insignificance; a dark and sluggish water, which is curled by no breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead sea, where startled passengers are awakened by the shock, and the next moment buried in the gulph of Oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="035851_0078_1007AB090EDFF008"/>
Of all the unhappy deserters from the paths of Sci∣ence, none seemed less able to return than the follow∣ers of Indolence. The captives of Appetite and Pas∣sion, could often seize the moment when their tyrants were languid or asleep, to escape from their enchant∣ment; but the dominion of Indolence was constant and unremitted; and seldom resisted, till resistance was in vain.</P>
<P>After contemplating these things, I turned my eyes towards the top of the mountain, where the air was al∣ways pure and exhilarating, the path shaded with lau∣rels and other evergreens, and the effulgence which beamed from the face of Science, seemed to shed a glory round her votaries. Happy, said I, are they who are permitted to ascend the mountain!—but while I was pronouncing this exclamation, with uncommon ardour, I saw, standing beside me, a form of diviner features, and a more benign radiance. "Happier," said she, "are they whom Virtue conducts to the mansions of Content!" "What," said I, "does Virtue then reside in the vale?" "I am found," said she, "in the vale, and I illuminate the mountain. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and in∣spire the sage at his meditation. I mingle in the crowd of cities, and bless the hermit in his cell. I have a tem∣ple in every heart that owns my influence; and to him that wishes for me, I am already present. Science may raise thee to eminence, but I alone can guide thee to felicity!"—While Virtue was thus speaking, I stretched out my arms towards her, with a vehemence which broke my slumber. The chill dews were falling around me, and the shades of evening stretched over the land∣scape. I hastened homeward; and resigned the night to silence and meditation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. The Journey of a Day: a Picture of Human Life.</HEAD>
<P>OBIDAH, the son of Abensina, left the caravansera early in the morning, and pursued his journey through the plains of Indo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tan. He was fresh and vigorous with rest; he was animated with hope; he was incited by desire; he walked swiftly forward over the vallies, and saw the hills gradually rising before him. As he passed along, his ears were delighted with the morning song of the bird of paradise; he was fanned by the last flutters of the sinking breeze, and sprinkled with dew by groves of spices. He sometimes contemplated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose, eldest daughter of the spring: all his senses were gra∣tified, and all care was banished from his heart.</P>
<P>Thus he went on, till the sun approached his meri∣dian, and the increasing heat preyed upon his strength; he then looked round about him for some more com∣modious path. He saw, on his right hand, a grove that seemed to wave its shades as a sign of invitation; he entered it, and found the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant. He did not, however, forget whither he was travelling; but found a narrow way bordered with flowers which appeared to have the same direction with the main road; and was pleased, that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite pleasure with business, and to gain the rewards of diligence without suffering its fatigues. He, there∣fore, still continued to walk for a time, without the least remission of his ardour, except that he was some∣times
<PB N="43" REF="035851_0080_1007AB0DADF34E40"/>
tempted to stop by the music of the birds, which the heat had assembled in the shade; and sometimes amused himself with plucking the flowers that covered the banks on either side, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At last, the green path began to de∣cline from its first tendency, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with water-falls. Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to consider whether it were longer safe to for∣sake the known and common track; but remembering that the heat was now in its greatest violence, and that the plain was dusty and uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path, which he supposed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the varieties of the ground, and to end at last in the common road.</P>
<P>Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pace, though he suspected that he was not gaining ground. This uneasiness of mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every sensation that might sooth or divert him. He listened to every echo; he mounted every hill for a fresh pros∣pect; he turned aside to every cascade; and pleased himself with tracing the course of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and watered a large region with innumerable circumvolutions. In these amuse∣ments, the hours passed away unaccounted; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣viations had perplexed his memory, and he knew not towards what point to travel. He stood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sive and confused, afraid to go forward lest he should go wrong, yet conscious that the time of loitering was now past. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the sky was overspread with clouds; the day vanished from before him; and a sudden tempest gathered round <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="44" REF="035851_0081_1007AB11E1B6F370"/>
head. He was now roused by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he now saw how happiness is lost when ease is consulted; he la∣mented the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>manly impatience that prompted him to seek shelter in the grove; and despised the petty cu∣riosity that led him on from trifle to trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.</P>
<P>He now resolved to do what yet remained in his power, to tread back the ground which he had passed, and try to find some issue where the wood might open into the plain. He prostrated himself on the ground, and commended his life to the Lord of Nature. He rose with confidence and tranquillity, and pressed on with resolution. The beasts of the desert were in mo∣tion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and ravage and expiration. All the horrors of darkness and solitude surrounded him: the winds roared in the woods; and the torrents tumbled from the hills.</P>
<P>Thus forlorn and distressed, he wandered through the wild, without knowing whither he was going, or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to safety or to destruction. At length, not fear, but la∣bour began to overcome him; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled; and he was on the point of lying down in resignation to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light; and finding that it pro∣ceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admission. The old man set before him such provisions as he had collected for himself, on which Obidah fed with eagerness and gra∣titude.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="035851_0082_1007AB14A1906458"/>
When the repast was over, "Tell me," said the her∣mit, "by what chance thou hast been brought hither? I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wilderness, in which I never saw a man before."—Obidah then related the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or palliation.</P>
<P>"Son," said the hermit, "let the errors and follies, the dangers and escape of this day, sink deep into thy heart. Remember, my son, that human life is the journey of a day. We rise in the morning of youth, full of vigour and full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and hope, with gaiety and with diligence, and travel on a while in the direct road of piety to∣wards the mansions of rest. In a short time, we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find some mitigation of our duty, and some more easy means of obtaining the same end. We then relax our vigour, and resolve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a distance; but rely upon our own constancy, and venture to approach what we resolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ease, and repose in the shades of security. Here the heart softens, and vigilance subsides; we are then willing to inquire whether another advance can∣not be made, and whether we may not, at least, turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleasure. We approach them with scruple and hesitation; we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling; and always hope to pass through them without losing the road of virtue, which, for a while, we keep in our sight, and to which we purpose to return. But temptation succeeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for ano∣ther; we in time lose the happiness of innocence, and solace our disquiet with sensual gratifications. By de∣grees,
<PB N="46" REF="035851_0083_1007AB162B6763A0"/>
we let fall the remembrance of our original in∣tention, and quit the only adequate object of rational desire. We entangle ourselves in business, immerge ourselves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of inconstancy; till the darkness of old age begins to invade us, and disease and anxiety obstruct our way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with sorrow, with repentance; and wish, but too often vainly wish, that we had not forsaken the ways of vir∣tue. Happy are they, my son, who shall learn from thy example, not to despair; but shall remember, that, though the day is past, and their strength is wasted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that re∣formation is never hopeless, nor sincere endeavours ever unassisted; that the wanderer may at length re∣turn after all his errors; and that he who implores strength and courage from above, shall find danger and difficulty give way before him. Go now, my son, to thy repose; commit thyself to the care of Omnipo∣tence; and when the morning calls again to toil, begin, ane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy journey, and thy life:"</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. DIDACTIC PIECES.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. The Importance of a good Education.</HEAD>
<P>I CONSIDER a human soul, without education, like marble in the quarry; which shows none of its inherent beauties, until the skill of the polisher fetches out the colours, makes the surface shine, and discovers every ornamental cloud, spot, and vein that runs through the body of it. Education, after the same manner, when it works upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which, without such helps, are never able to make their appearance.</P>
<P>If my reader will give me leave to change the allusion so soon upon him, I shall make use of the same instance to illustrate the force of education, which Aristotle has brought to explain his doctrine of sub∣stantial forms, when he tells us, that a statue lies hid in a block of marble; and that the art of the statuary only clears away the superfluous matter, and removes the rubbish. The figure is in the stone, and the scul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r only finds it. What sculpture is to a block of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, education is to a human soul. The philosopher, the saint, or the hero, the wise, the good, or the great man, very often lies hid and concealed in a plebian, which a proper education might have disinterred, and have
<PB N="48" REF="035851_0085_1007AB1C4A03FED0"/>
brought to light. I am therefore much delighted with reading the accounts of savage nations; and with con∣templating those virtues which are wild and uncul∣tivated: to see courage exerting itself in fierceness, resolution in obstinacy, wisdom in cunning, patience in sullenness and despair.</P>
<P>Mens' passions operate variously, and appear in dif∣ferent kinds of actions, according as they are more or less rectified and swayed by reason. When one hears of negroes, who upon the death of their masters, or upon changing their service, hang themselves upon the next tree, as it sometimes happens in our American plantations, who can forbear admiring their fidelity, though it expresses itself in so dreadful a manner? What might not that savage greatness of soul, which appears in these poor wretches on many occasions, be raised to, were it rightly cultivated? And what colour of excuse can there be, for the contempt with which we treat this part of our species; that we should not put them upon the common foot of humanity; that we should only set an insignificant fine upon the man who murders them; nay, that we should as much as in us lies, cut them off from the prospects of happiness in another world, as well as in this; and deny them that which we look upon as the proper means for at∣taining it?</P>
<P>It is therefore an unspeakable blessing, to be born in those parts of the world where wisdom and knowledge flourish; though, it must be confessed, there are, even in these parts, several poor uninstructed persons, who are but little above the inhabitants of those nations of which I have been here speaking; as those who have had the advantages of a more liberal education, rise
<PB N="49" REF="035851_0086_1007AB1EEB7D25F0"/>
above one another by several different degrees of per∣fection. For, to return to our statue in the block of marble, we see it sometimes only begun to be chipped, sometimes rough-hewn, and but just sketched into a human figure; sometimes, we see the man appearing distinctly in all his limbs and features; sometimes, we find the figure wrought up to great elegancy; but seldom meet with any to which the hand of a Phidias or a Praxiteles could not give several nice touches and finishings.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. On Gratitude.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a more pleasing exercise of the mind, than gratitude. It is accompanied with such inward satisfaction, that the duty is sufficiently rewarded by the performance. It is not, like the practice of many other virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with so much pleasure, that were there no positive command which enjoined it, nor any recompense laid up for it hereafter, a generous mind would indulge in it, for the natural gratification which it affords.</P>
<P>If gratitude is due from man to man, how much more from man to his Maker?—The Supreme Being does not only confer upon us those bounties which pro∣ceed more immediately from his hand, but even those benefits which are conveyed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by others. Every blessing we enjoy, by what means soever it may be derived upon us, is the gift of Him who is the great Author of good, and the Father of mercies.</P>

of a grateful man, it exalts the soul into rapture, when it is employed on this great object of gratitude; on this beneficent Being, who has given us every thing we already possess, and from whom we expect every thing we yet hope for.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. On Forgiveness.</HEAD>
<P>THE most plain and natural sentiments of equity concur with divine authority, to enforce the duty of forgiveness. Let him who has never in his life done wrong, be allowed the privilege of remaining in∣exorable. But let such as are conscious of frailties and crimes, consider forgiveness as a debt which they owe to others. Common failings are the strongest lesson of mutual forbearance. Were this virtue unknown among men, order and comfort, peace and repose, would be strangers to human life. Injuries retaliated according to the exorbitant measure which passion prescribes, would excite resentment in return. The injured person would become the injurer; and thus wrongs, retaliations, and fresh injuries, would circulate in endless succession, till the world was rendered a field of blood. Of all the passions which invade the human breast, revenge is the most direful. When al∣lowed to reign with full dominion, it is more than sufficient to poison the few pleasures which remain to man in his present state. How much soever a person may suffer from injustice, he is always in hazard of suffering more from the prosecution of revenge. The violence of an enemy cannot inflict what is equal to the
<PB N="51" REF="035851_0088_1007AB22D3555358"/>
torment he creates to himself, by means of the fierce and desperate passions which he allows to rage in his soul.</P>
<P>Those evil spirits who inhabit the regions of misery, are represented as delighting in revenge and cruelty. But all that is great and good in the universe, is on the side of clemency and mercy. The almighty Ruler of the world, though for ages offended by the unrighte∣ousness, and insulted by the impiety of men, is "long-suffering and slow to anger." His Son, when he ap∣peared in our nature, exhibited, both in his life, and his death, the most illustrious example of forgiveness which the world ever beheld. If we look into the history of mankind, we shall find that in every age, they who have been respected as worthy, or admired as great, have been distinguished for this virtue. Revenge dwells in little minds. A noble and magnanimous spirit is always superior to it. It suffers not from the injuries of men those severe shocks which others feel. Collected within itself, it stands unmoved by their im∣potent assaults; and with generous pity, rather than with anger, looks down on their unworthy conduct.—It has been truly said, that the greatest man on earth can no sooner commit an injury, than a good man can make himself greater, by forgiving it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Motives to the Practice of Gentleness.</HEAD>
<P>To promote the virtue of gentleness, we ought to view our character with an impartial eye; and to learn, from our own failings, to give that indulgence
<PB N="52" REF="035851_0089_1007AB25A680EB18"/>
which in our turn we claim. It is pride which fills the world with so much harshness and severity. In the fulness of self-estimation, we forget what we are. We claim attentions, to which we are not entitled. We are rigorous to offences, as if we had never of∣fended; unfeeling to distress, as if we know not what it was to suffer. From those airy regions of pride and folly, let us descend to our proper level. Let us sur∣vey the natural equality on which Providence has placed man with man, and reflect on the infirmities common to all. If the reflection on natural equality and mutual offences, be insufficient to prompt humani∣ty, let us at least remember what we are in the sight of our Creator. Have we none of that forbearance to give one another, which we all so earnestly intreat from heaven? Can we look for clemency or gentleness from our Judge, when we are so backward to show it to our own brethren?</P>
<P>Let us also accustom ourselves, to reflect on the small moment of those things, which are the usual in∣centives to violence and contention. In the ruffled and angry hour, we view every appearance through a false medium. The most inconsiderable point of inte∣rest, or honour, swells into a momentous object; and the slightest attack seems to threaten immediate ruin. But after passion or pride has subsided, we look around in vain for the mighty mischiefs we dreaded. The fabric, which our disturbed imagination had reared, totally disappears. But though the cause of conten∣tion has dwindled away, its consequences remain. We have alienated a friend; we have embittered an enemy; we have sown the seeds of future suspicion, malevolence, or disgust.—Let us suspend our violence
<PB N="53" REF="035851_0090_1007AB2905495138"/>
for a moment, when causes of discord occur. Let us anticipate that period of coolness, which, of itself, will soon arrive. Let us reflect how little we have any prospect of gaining by fierce contention; but how much of the true happiness of life we are certain of throwing away. Easily, and from the smallest chink, the bitter waters of strife are let forth; but their course cannot be foreseen; and he seldom fails of suffering most from their poisonous effect, who first allowed them to flow.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. A suspicious Temper the Source of Misery to its Possessor.</HEAD>
<P>As a suspicious spirit is the source of many crimes and calamities in the world, so it is the spring of cer∣tain misery to the person who indulges it. His friends will be few; and small will be his comfort in those whom he possesses. Believing others to be his ene∣mies, he will of course make them such. Let his cau∣tion be ever so great, the asperity of his thoughts will often break out in his behaviour; and in return for sus∣pecting and hating, he will incur suspicion and hatred. Besides the external evils which he draws upon himself, arising from alienated friendship, broken confidence, and open enmity, the suspicious temper itself is one of the worst evils which any man can suffer. If "in all fear there is torment," how miserable must be his state who, by living in perpetual jealousy, lives in perpetual dread? Looking upon himself to be surrounded with spies, enemies, and designing men, he is a stranger to reliance and trust. He knows not to whom to open
<PB N="54" REF="035851_0091_1007AB2A8E1ABBA8"/>
himself. He dresses his countenance in forced smiles, while his heart throbs within from apprehensions of secret treachery. Hence fretfulness and ill-humour, disgust at the world, and all the painful sensations of an irritated and embittered mind.</P>
<P>So numerous and great are the evils arising from a suspicious disposition, that, of the two extremes, it is more eligible to expose ourselves to occasional disad∣vantage from thinking too well of others, than to suffer continual misery by thinking always ill of them. It is better to be sometimes imposed upon, than never to trust. Safety is purchased at too dear a rate, when, in order to secure it, we are obliged to be always clad in armour, and to live in perpetual hostility with our fellows. This is, for the sake of living, to deprive ourselves of the comfort of life. The man of candour enjoys his situation, whatever it is, with cheerfulness and peace. Prudence directs his intercourse with the world; but no black suspicions haunt his hours of rest. Accustomed to view the characters of his neighbours in the most favourable light, he is like one who dwells amidst those beautiful scenes of nature, on which the eye rests with pleasure. Whereas the suspicious man, having his imagination filled with all the shocking forms of human falsehood, deceit, and treachery, re∣sembles the traveller in the wilderness, who discerns no objects around him but such as are either dreary or terrible; caverns that open, serpents that hiss, and beasts of prey that howl.</P>

<P>THERE are many who have passed the age of youth and beauty; who have resigned the pleasures of that smiling season; who begin to decline into the vale of years, impaired in their health, depressed in their fortunes, stript of their friends, their children, and perhaps still more tender connexions. What resource can this world afford them? It presents a dark and dreary waste, through which there does not issue a single ray of comfort. Every delusive prospect of am∣bition is now at an end; long experience of mankind, an experience very different from what the open and generous soul of youth had fondly dreamt of, has ren∣dered the heart almost inaccessible to new friendships. The principal sources of activity are taken away, when those for whom we labour are cut off from us; those who animated, and those who sweetened all the toils of life. Where then can the soul find refuge, but in the bosom of Religion? There she is admitted to those prospects of Providence and futurity, which alone can warm and fill the heart. I speak here of such as retain the feelings of humanity; whom misfortunes have soft∣ened, and perhaps rendered more delicately sensible: not of such as possess that stupid insensibility, which some are pleased to dignify with the name of Philo∣sophy.</P>
<P>It might therefore be expected, that those philoso∣phers, who think they stand in no need themselves of the assistance of religion to support their virtue, and who never feel the want of its consolations, would yet
<PB N="56" REF="035851_0093_1007AB2F638D7C78"/>
have the humanity to consider the very different situa∣tion of the rest of mankind; and not endeavour to de∣prive them of what habit at least, if they will not al∣low it to be nature, has made necessary to their mo∣rals, and to their happiness. It might be expected, that humanity would prevent them from breaking into the last retreat of the unfortunate, who can no longer be objects of their envy or resentment; and tearing from them their only remaining comfort. The at∣tempt to ridicule religion may be agreeable to some, by relieving them from restraint upon their pleasures: and may render others very miserable, by making them doubt those truths, in which they were most deeply interested; but it can convey real good and happiness to no one individual.</P>

<P>We are some of us very fond of knowledge, and apt to value ourselves upon any proficiency in the sciences: one science, however, there is, worth more than all the rest, and that is, the science of living well; which shall remain, when "tongues shall cease," and "know∣ledge shall vanish away." As to new notions, and new doctrines, of which this age is very fruitful, the time will come, when we shall have no pleasure in them: nay, the time shall come when they shall be exploded, and would have been forgotten, if they had not been preserved in those excellent books, which contain a confutation of them; like infects preserved for ages in amber, which otherwise would soon have returned to the common mass of things. But a firm belief of Christianity, and a practice suitable to it, will support and invigorate the mind to the last; and most of all, at last, at that important hour, which must decide our hopes and apprehensions: and the wisdom, which, like our Saviour, cometh from above, will, through his me∣rits, bring us thither.

and are to render account at the last. That portion of it which he has allotted us, is intended partly for the concerns of this world, partly for those of the next. Let each of these occupy, in the distribution of our time, that space which properly belongs to it. Let not the hours of hospitality and pleasure interfere with the discharge of our necessary affairs; and let not what we call necessary affairs, encroach upon the time which is due to devotion. To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heaven. If we delay till to-morrow what ought to be done to-day, we overcharge the morrow with a burden which belongs not to it. We load the wheels of time, and prevent them from carrying us along smoothly. He who every morning plans the transactions of the day, and follows out that plan, carries on a thread which will guide him through the labyrinth of the most busy life. The orderly arrangement of his time is like a ray of light, which darts itself through all his affairs. But, where no plan is laid, where the disposal of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incidents, all things lie huddled together in one chaos, which admits neither of distribution nor review.</P>
<P>The first requisite for introducing order into the management of time, is to be impressed with a just sense of its value. Let us consider well how much de∣pends upon it, and how fast it flies away. The bulk of men are in nothing more capricious and inconsistent, than in their appreciation of time. When they think of it, as the measure of their continuance on earth, they highly prize it, and with the greatest anxiety seek to lengthen it out. But when they view it in separate parcels, they appear to hold it in contempt, and squan∣der
<PB N="59" REF="035851_0096_1007AB37B70A02F8"/>
it with inconsiderate profusion. While they com∣plain that life is short, they are often wishing its dif∣ferent periods at an end. Covetous of every other possession, of time only they are prodigal. They allow every idle man to be master of this property, and make every frivolous occupation welcome that can help them to consume it. Among those who are so careless of time, it is not to be expected that order should be observed in its distribution. But, by this fatal neglect, how many materials of severe and lasting regret are they laying up in store for themselves! The time which they suffer to pass away in the midst of confu∣sion, bitter repentance seeks afterwards in vain to re∣call. What was omitted to be done at its proper moment, arises to be the torment of some future sea∣son. Manhood is disgraced by the consequences of neglected youth. Old age, oppressed by cares that belonged to a former period, labours under a burden not its own. At the close of life, the dying man be∣holds with anguish that his days are finishing, when his preparation for eternity is hardly commenced. Such are the effects of a disorderly waste of time, through not attending to its value. Every thing in the life of such persons is misplaced. Nothing is performed aright, from not being performed in due season.</P>
<P>But he who is orderly in the distribution of his time, takes the proper method of escaping those manifold evils. He is justly said to redeem the time. By pro∣per management, he prolongs it. He lives much in little space; more in a few years than others do in many. He can live to God and his own soul, and at the same time attend to all the lawful interests of the present world. He looks back on the past, and pro∣vides

for the future. He catches and arrests the hours as they fly. They are marked down for useful pur∣poses, and their memory remains. Whereas those hours fleet by the man of confusion like a shadow. His days and years are either blanks of which he has no remembrance, or they are filled up with such a con∣fused and irregular succession of unfinished transactions, that though he remembers he has been busy, yet he can give no account of the business which has em∣ployed him.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. The Dignity of Virtue amidst corrupt Examples.</HEAD>
<P>THE most excellent and honourable character which can adorn a man and a Christian, is acquired by re∣sisting the torrent of vice, and adhering to the cause of God and virtue against a corrupted multitude. It will be found to hold in general, that all those, who, in any of the great lines of life, have distinguished themselves for thinking profoundly, and acting nobly, have de∣spised popular prejudices; and departed, in several things, from the common ways of the world. On no occasion is this more requisite for true honour, than where religion and morality are concerned. In times of prevailing licentiousness, to maintain unblemished virtue, and uncorrupted integrity; in a public or a private cause, to stand firm by what is fair and just, amidst discouragements and opposition; despising groundless censure and reproach; disdaining all com∣pliance with public manners, when they are vicious and unlawful; and never ashamed of the punctual
<PB N="61" REF="035851_0098_1007AB3DA9E03ED0"/>
discharge of every duty towards God and man;—this is what shows true greatness of spirit, and will force approbation even from the degenerate multitude them∣selves. "This is the man," (their conscience will oblige them to acknowledge,) "whom we are unable to bend to mean condescensions. We see it in vain either to flatter or to threaten him; he rests on a prin∣ciple within, which we cannot shake. To this man we may, on any occasion, safely commit our cause. He is incapable of betraying his trust, or deserting his friend, or denying his faith."</P>
<P>It is, accordingly, this steady inflexible virtue, this regard to principle, superior to all custom and opi∣nion, which peculiarly marked the characters of those in any age, who have shone with distinguished lustre; and has consecrated their memory to all posterity. It was this that obtained to ancient Enoch the most sin∣gular testimony of honour from heaven. He continued to "walk with God," when the world apostatised from him. He pleased God, and was beloved of him; so that living among sinners, he was translated to heaven without seeing death; "Yea, speedily was he taken away, lest wickedness should have altered his under∣standing, or deceit beguiled his soul." When Sodom could not furnish ten righteous men to save it, Lot re∣mained unspotted amidst the contagion. He lived like an angel among spirits of darkness; and the destroying flame was not permitted to go forth, till the good man was called away by a heavenly messenger from his devoted city. When "all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth," then lived Noah, a righteous man, and a preacher of righteousness. He stood alone, and was scoffed by the profane crew. But they by
<PB N="62" REF="035851_0099_1007AB4E8CD3A160"/>
the deluge were swept away; while on him, Provi∣dence conferred the immortal honour, of being the re∣storer of a better race, and the father of a new world. Such examples as these, and such honours conferred by God on them who withstood the multitude of evil doers, should often be present to our minds. Let us oppose them to the numbers of low and corrupt exam∣ples, which we behold around us; and when we are in hazard of being swayed by such, let us fortify our virtue, by thinking of those who, in former times, shone like stars in the midst of surrounding darkness, and are now shining in the kingdom of heaven, as the brightness of the firmament, for ever and ever.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X. The Mortifications of Vice greater than those of Virtue.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH no condition of human life is free from uneasiness, yet it must be allowed, that the uneasiness belonging to a sinful course, is far greater, than what attends a course of well-doing. If we are weary of the labours of virtue, we may be assured, that the world, whenever we try the exchange, will lay upon us a much heavier load. It is the outside, only, of a licentious life, which is gay and smiling. Within, it conceals toil, and trouble, and deadly sorrow. For vice poisons human happiness in the spring, by intro∣ducing disorder into the heart. Those passions which it seems to indulge, it only seeds with imperfect grati∣fications; and thereby strengthens them for preying, in the end, on their unhappy victims.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="035851_0100_1007923B79C805D0"/>
It is a great mistake to imagine, that the pain of self-denial is confined to virtue. He who follows the world, as much as he who follows Christ, must "take up his cross;" and to him assuredly, it will prove a more oppressive burden. Vice allows all our passions to range uncontrolled; and where each claims to be superior, it is impossible to gratify all. The pre∣dominant desire can only be indulged at the expense of its rival. No mortifications which virtue exacts, are more severe than those, which ambition imposes upon the love of ease, pride upon interest, and covet∣ousness upon vanity. Self-denial, therefore, belongs, in common, to vice and virtue; but with this remark∣ble difference, that the passions which virtue requires us to mortify, it tends to weaken; whereas, those which vice obliges us to deny, it, at the same time, strengthens. The one diminishes the pain of self-denial, by moderating the demand of passion; the other in∣creases it, by rendering those demands imperious and violent. What distresses, that occur in the calm life of virtue, can be compared to those tortures, which re∣morse of conscience inflicts on the wicked; to those severe humiliations, arising from guilt combined with misfortunes, which sink them to the dust; to those violent agitations of shame and disappointment, which sometimes drive them to the most fatal extremities, and make them abhor their existence? How often, in the midst of those disastrous situations, into which their crimes have brought them, have they execrated the seductions of vice; and, with bitter regret, looked back to the day on which they first forsook the path of innocence!</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI. On Contentment.</HEAD>
<P>CONTENTMENT produces, in some measure, all those effects which the alchymist usually ascribes to what he calls the philosopher's stone; and if it does not bring riches, it does the same thing by banishing the desire of them. If it cannot remove the disquietudes arising from a man's mind, body, or fortune, it makes him easy under them. It has indeed a kindly influence on the soul of man, in respect of every being to whom he stands related. It extinguishes all murmur, repining, and ingratitude, towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act in this world. It destroys all in∣ordinate ambition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is placed. It gives sweetness to his conversation, and a perpetual serenity to all his thoughts.</P>
<P>Among the many methods which might be made use of for acquiring this virtue, I shall mention only the two following. First of all, a man should always con∣sider how much he has more than he wants; and secondly, how much more unhappy he might be than he really is.</P>
<P>First, a man should always consider how much he has more than he wants. I am wonderfully pleased with the reply which Aristippus made to one, who con∣doled him upon the loss of a farm: "Why," said he, "I have three farms still, and you have but one; so that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for me." On the contrary, foolish men are more apt to consider what they have lost, than what they possess;
<PB N="65" REF="035851_0102_10079243688031D0"/>
and to fix their eyes upon those who are richer than themselves, rather than on those who are under greater difficulties. All the real pleasures and conveniences of life lie in a narrow compass; but it is the humour of mankind to be always looking forward; and straining after one who has got the start of them in wealth and honour. For this reason, as none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want, there are few rich men in any of the politer nations, but among the middle sort of people, who keep their wishes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than they know how to enjoy. Persons of a higher rank live in a kind of splendid poverty; and are per∣petually wanting, because, instead of acquiescing in the solid pleasures of life, they endeavour to outvie one another in shadows and appearances. Men of sense have at all times behold, with a great deal of mirth, this silly game that is playing over their heads; and, by contracting their desires, enjoy all that secret satisfaction which others are always in quest of. The truth is, this ridiculous chase after imaginary pleasures, cannot be sufficiently exposed, as it is the great source of those evils which generally undo a nation. Let a man's estate be what it may, he is a poor man, if he does not live within it; and naturally sets himself to sale to any one that can give him his price. When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had left him a good estate, was offered a great sum of money by the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindness; but told him, he had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In short, content is equivalent to wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a more agreeable turn, "Content is natural wealth,"
<PB N="66" REF="035851_0103_100792590BAFE1E0"/>
says Socrates; to which I shall add, Luxury is artificial poverty. I shall therefore recommend to the con∣sideration of those, who are always aiming at super∣fluous and imaginary enjoyments, and who will not be at the trouble of contracting their desires, an excellent saying of Bion the philosopher, namely, "That no man has so much care, as he who endeavours after the most happiness."</P>
<P>In the second place, every one ought to reflect how much more unhappy he might be, than he really is.—The former consideration took in all those, who are sufficiently provided with the means to make them∣selves easy; this regards such as actually lie under some pressure or misfortune. These may receive great alleviation, from such a comparison as the unhappy person may make between himself and others; or be∣tween the misfortune which he suffers, and greater misfortunes which might have befallen him.</P>
<P>I like the story of the honest Dutchman, who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-mast, told the standers-by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To which, since I am got into quotations, give me leave to add the saying of an old philosopher, who, after having invited some of his friends to dine with him, was ruffled by a person that came into the room in a passion, and threw down the table that stood be∣fore them: "Every one," says he, "has his calamity; and he is a happy man that has no greater than this." We find an instance to the same purpose, in the life of Doctor Hammond, written by Bishop Fell. As this good man was troubled with a complication of dis∣tempers, when he had the gout upon him, he used to thank God that it was not the stone; and when he had
<PB N="67" REF="035851_0104_1007925D5B55B610"/>
the stone, that he had not both these distempers on him at the same time.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this essay without observing, that there never was any system besides that of Christianity, which could effectually produce in the mind of man the virtue I have been hitherto speaking of. In order to make us contented with our condition, many of the present philosophers tell us, that our discontent only hurts ourselves, without being able to make any altera∣tion in our circumstances; others, that whatever evil befalls us is derived to us by a fatal necessity, to which superior beings themselves are subject; while others, very gravely, tell the man who is miserable, that it is necessary he should be so, to keep up the harmony of the universe; and that the scheme of Providence would be troubled and perverted, were he otherwise. These, and the like considerations, rather silence than satisfy a man. They may show him that his discontent is unreasonable, but they are by no means sufficient to relieve it. They rather give despair than consolation. In a word, a man might reply to one of these comforters, as Au∣gustus did to his friend, who advised him not to grieve for the death of a person whom he loved, because his grief could not fetch him again: "It is for that very reason," said the emperour, "that I gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>."</P>
<P>On the contrary, religion bears a more tender re∣gard to human nature. It prescribes to every miser∣able man the means of bettering his condition: nay, it shows him, that bearing his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them. It makes him easy here, because it can make him happy hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. Rank and Riches afford no Ground for Envy.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the grounds of envy among men, superiority in rank and fortune is the most general. Hence, the malignity which the poor commonly bear to the rich, as engrossing to themselves all the comforts of life. Hence, the evil eye with which persons of inferior sta∣tion scrutinise those who are above them in rank; and if they approach to that rank, their envy is generally strongest against such as are just one step higher than themselves.—Alas! my friends, all this envious disquie∣tude, which agitates the world, arises from a deceitful figure which imposes on the public view. False co∣lours are hung out; the real state of men is not what it seems to be. The order of society requires a distinc∣tion of ranks to take place; but in point of happiness, all men come much nearer to equality than is commonly imagined; and the circumstances, which form any ma∣terial difference of happiness among them, are not of that nature which renders them grounds of envy. The poor man possesses not, it is true, some of the conveni∣ences and pleasures of the rich; but, in return, he is free from many embarrassments to which they are subject. By the simplicity and uniformity of his life, he is deli∣vered from that variety of cares, which perplex those who have great affairs to manage, intricate plans to pursue, many enemies, perhaps, to encounter in the pursuit. In the tranquillity of his small habitation, and private family, he enjoys a peace which is often un∣known at courts. The gratifications of nature, which are always the most satisfactory, are possessed by him
<PB N="69" REF="035851_0106_10079263252F8800"/>
to their full extent; and if he be a stranger to the re∣fined pleasures of the wealthy, he is unacquainted also with the desire of them, and by consequence, feels no want. His plain meal satisfies his appetite, with a relish, probably, higher than that of the rich man, who sits down to his luxurious banquet. His sleep is more found; his health more firm; he knows not what spleen, languor, and liftlessness are. His accustomed employments or labours are not more oppressive to him, than the labour of attendance on courts and the great, the labours of dress, the fatigue of amusements, the very weight of idleness, frequently are to the rich. In the mean time, all the beauty of the face of nature, all the enjoyments of domestic society, all the gaiety and cheerfulness of an easy mind, are as open to him as to those of the highest rank. The splendour of re∣tinue, the found of titles, the appearances of high re∣spect, are indeed soothing, for a short time, to the great. But, become familiar, they are soon forgotten. Custom effaces their impression. They sink into the rank of those ordinary things, which daily recur, without rais∣ing any sensation of joy.—Let us cease, therefore, from looking up with discontent and envy to those, whom birth or fortune has placed above us. Let us adjust the balance of happiness fairly. When we think of the enjoyments we want, we should think also of the troubles from which we are free. If we allow their just value to the comforts we possess, we shall find rea∣son to rest satisfied, with a very moderate, though not an opulent and splendid, condition of fortune. Often, did we know the whole, we should be inclined to pity the state of those whom we now envy.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. Patience under Provocations our Interest as well as Duty.</HEAD>
<P>THE wide circle of human society is diversified by an endless variety of characters, dispositions, and pas∣sions. Uniformity is, in no respect, the genius of the world. Every man is marked by some peculiarity which distinguishes him from another: and no where can two individuals be found, who are exactly, and in all respects, alike. Where so much diversity obtains, it cannot but happen, that, in the intercourse which men are obliged to maintain, their tempers shall often be ill adjusted to that intercourse; shall jar, and inter∣fere with each other. Hence, in every station, the highest as well as the lowest, and in every condition of life, public, private, and domestic, occasions of irrita∣tion frequently arise. We are provoked, sometimes, by the folly and levity of those with whom we are connected; sometimes, by their indifference or neglect; by the incivility of a friend, the haughtiness of a supe∣rior, or the insolent behaviour of one in lower station. Hardly a day passes, without somewhat or other oc∣curring, which serves to ruffle the man of impatient spirit. Of course, such a man lives in a continual storm. He knows not what it is to enjoy a train of good humour. Servants, neighbours, friends, spouse, and children, all, through the unrestrained violence of his temper, become sources of disturbance and vexation to him. In vain is affluence; in vain are health and prosperity. The least trifle is sufficient to discompose his mind, and poison his pleasures. His very amuse∣ments are mixed with turbulence and passion.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="035851_0108_10079268E9AF18C8"/>
I would beseech this man to consider, of what small moment the provocations which he receives, or at least imagines himself to receive, are really in themselves; but of what great moment he makes them, by suffering them to deprive him of the possession of himself. I would beseech him, to consider, how many hours of happiness he throws away, which a little more pa∣tience would allow him to enjoy; and how much he puts it in the power of the most insignificant persons to render him miserable. "But who can expect," we hear him exclaim, "that he is to possess the insensibi∣lity of a stone? How is it possible for human nature to endure so many repeated provocations? or to bear calmly with such unreasonable behaviour?"—My bro∣ther! if thou canst bear with no instances of unreasona∣ble behaviour, withdraw thyself from the world. Thou art no longer fit to live in it. Leave the intercourse of men. Retreat to the mountain, and the desert; or shut thyself up in a cell. For here, in the midst of society, <HI>offences must come.</HI> We might as well expect, when we beheld a calm atmosphere, and a clear sky, that no clouds were ever to rise, and no winds to blow, as that our life was long to proceed, without receiving provocations from human frailty. The careless and the imprudent, the giddy and the fickle, the ungrate∣ful and the interested, every where meet us. They are the briers and thorns, with which the paths of hu∣man life are beset. He only, who can hold his course among them with patience and equanimity, he who is prepared to bear what he must expect to happen, is worthy of the name of a man.</P>
<P>If we preserved ourselves composed but for a mo∣ment, we should perceive the insignificancy of most of
<PB N="72" REF="035851_0109_1007926D1B96CA38"/>
those provocations which we magnify so highly. When a few suns more have rolled over our heads, the storm will, of itself, have subsided; the cause of our present impatience and disturbance will be utterly forgotten. Can we not then, anticipate this hour of calmness to ourselves; and begin to enjoy the peace which it will certainly bring? If others have behaved improperly, let us leave them to their own folly, without becoming the victim of their caprice, and punishing ourselves on their account.—Patience, in this exercise of it, cannot be too much studied by all who wish their life to flow in a smooth stream. It is the reason of a man, in op∣position to the passion of a child. It is the enjoyment of peace, in opposition to uproar and confusion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. Moderation in our Wishes recommended.</HEAD>
<P>THE active mind of man seldom or never rests satis∣fied with its present condition, how prosperous soever. Originally formed for a wider range of objects, for a higher sphere of enjoyments, it finds itself, in every situation of fortune, straitened and confined. Sensible of deficiency in its state, it is ever sending forth the fond desire, the aspiring wish, after something beyond what is enjoyed at present. Hence, that restlessness which prevails so generally among mankind. Hence, that disgust of pleasures which they have tried; that passion for novelty; that ambition of rising to some degree of eminence or felicity, of which they have formed to themselves an indistinct idea. All which
<PB N="73" REF="035851_0110_1007926EA11FF718"/>
may be considered as indications of a certain native, original greatness in the human soul, swelling beyond the limits of its present condition; and pointing at the higher objects for which it was made. Happy, if these latent remains of our primitive state, served to direct our wishes towards their proper destination, and to lead us into the path of true bliss!"</P>
<P>But in this dark and bewildered state, the aspiring tendency of our nature unfortunately takes an oppo∣site direction, and feeds a very misplaced ambition. The flattering appearances which here present them∣selves to sense; the distinctions which fortune confers; the advantages and pleasures which we imagine the world to be capable of bestowing, fill up the ultimate wish of most men. These are the objects which in∣gross their solitary musings, and stimulate their active labours; which warm the breasts of the young, animate the industry of the middle aged, and often keep alive the passions of the old, until the very close of life.</P>
<P>Assuredly, there is nothing unlawful in our wishing to be freed from whatever is disagreeable, and to ob∣tain a fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life. But when these wishes are not tempered by reason, they are in danger of precipitating us into much extrava∣gance and folly. Desires and wishes are the first springs of action. When they become exorbitant, the whole character is likely to be tainted. If we suffer our fancy to create to itself worlds of ideal happiness, we shall discompose the peace and order of our minds, and foment many hurtful passions. Here, then, let Moderation begin its reign; by bringing within rea∣sonable bounds the wishes that we form. As soon as they become extravagant, let us check them, by pro∣per

reflections on the fallacious nature of those objects, which the world hangs out to allure desire.</P>
<P>You have strayed, my friends, from the road which conducts to felicity; you have dishonoured the native dignity of your souls, in allowing your wishes to ter∣minate on nothing higher than worldly ideas of great∣ness or happiness. Your imagination roves in a land of shadows. Unreal forms deceive you. It is no more than a phantom, an illusion of happiness, which at∣tracts your fond admiration; nay, an illusion of happi∣ness, which often conceals much real misery.</P>
<P>Do you imagine, that all are happy, who have at∣tained to those summits of distinction, towards which your wishes aspire? Alas! how frequently has experi∣ence shown, that where roses were supposed to bloom, nothing but briers and thorns grew? Reputation, beauty, riches, grandeur, nay, royalty itself, would, many a time, have been gladly exchanged by the pos∣sessors, for that more quiet and humble station, with which you are now dissatisfied. With all that is splen∣did and shining in the world, it is decreed that there should mix many deep shades of woe. On the eleva∣ted situations of fortune, the great calamities of life chiefly fall. There, the storm spends its violence, and there, the thunder breaks; while, safe and unhurt, the inhabitant of the vale remains below.—Retreat, then, from those vain and pernicious excursions of extrava∣gant desire. Satisfy yourselves with what is rational and attainable. Train your minds to moderate views of human life, and human happiness. Remember, and admire, the wisdom of Agar's petition: "Remove far from me vanity and lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with food convenient for me:

<HEAD>SECTION XV. Omniscience and Omnipresence of the Deity, the Source of Consolation to good Men.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS yesterday, about sun-set, walking in the open fields, till the night insensibly fell upon me. I at first amused myself with all the richness and variety of co∣lours, which appeared in the western parts of heaven. In proportion as they faded away and went out, seve∣ral stars and planets appeared one after another, till the whole firmament was in a glow. The blueness of the ether was exceedingly heightened and enlivened, by the season of the year, and the rays of all those lu∣minaries that passed through it. The galaxy appeared in its most beautiful white. To complete the scene, the full moon rose, at length, in that clouded majesty, which Milton takes notice of; and opened to the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely shaded, and disposed among softer lights than that which the sun had before discovered to us.</P>
<P>As I was surveying the moon walking in her bright∣ness, and taking her progress among the constellations, a thought arose in me, which I believe very often per∣plexes and disturbs men of serious and contemplative natures. David himself fell into it in that reflection: "When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars which thou hast or∣dained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and
<PB N="76" REF="035851_0113_1007932C535B42E0"/>
the son of man that thou regardest him!" In the same manner, when I considered that infinite host of stars, or, to speak more philosophically, of suns, which were then shining upon me; with those innumerable sets of planets or worlds, which were moving round their re∣spective suns; when I still enlarged the idea, and sup∣posed another heaven of suns and worlds, rising still above this which we discovered; and these still en∣lightened by a superior firmament of luminaries, which are planted at so great a distance, that they may ap∣pear to the inhabitants of the former, as the stars do to us; in short, while I pursued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little insignificant figure, which I myself bore amidst the immensity of God's works.</P>
<P>Were the sun, which enlightens this part of the creation, with all the host of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly extinguished and annihilated, they would not be missed, more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore. The space they possess is so ex∣ceedingly little in comparison of the whole, it would scarcely make a blank in the creation. The chasm would be imperceptible to an eye, that could take in the whole compass of nature, and pass from one end of the creation to the other; as it is possible there may be such a sense in ourselves hereafter, or in creatures which are at present more exalted than ourselves. By the help of glasses, we see many stars, which we do not discover with our naked eyes; and the finer our telescopes are, the more still are our discoveries.—Huygenius carries this thought so far, that he does not think it impossible there may be stars, whose light has not yet travelled down to us, since their first creation. There is no question that the universe has certain
<PB N="77" REF="035851_0114_1007939FF00810F8"/>
bounds set to it; but when we consider that it is the work of infinite Power, prompted by infinite Good∣ness, with an infinite space to exert itself in, how can our imagination set any bounds to it?</P>
<P>To return, therefore, to my first thought, I could not but look upon myself with secret horror, as a being that was not worth the smallest regard of one who had so great a work under his care and superintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amidst the immensity of nature; and lost among that infinite variety of crea∣tures, which, in all probability, swarm through all these immeasurable regions of matter.</P>
<P>In order to recover myself from this mortifying thought, I considered that it took its rise from those narrow conceptions, which we are apt to entertain of the Divine nature. We ourselves cannot attend to ma∣ny different objects at the same time. If we are care∣ful to inspect some things, we must of course neglect others. This imperfection which we observe in our∣selves, is an imperfection that cleaves, in some degree, to creatures of the highest capacities, as they are creatures, that is, beings of finite and limited natures. The presence of every created being is confined to a certain measure of space; and consequently his obser∣vation is stinted to a certain number of objects. The sphere in which we move, and act, and understand, is of a wider circumference to one creature, than another, according as we rise one above another in the scale of existence. But the widest of these our spheres has its circumference. When, therefore, we reflect on the Divine nature, we are so used and accustomed to this imperfection in ourselves, that we cannot forbear, in some measure, ascribing it to HIM, in whom there is no
<PB N="78" REF="035851_0115_100793A2C970ABF8"/>
shadow of imperfection. Our reason indeed assures us, that his attributes are infinite; but the poorness of our conceptions is such, that it cannot forbear setting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our reason comes again to our succour, and throws down all those little prejudices, which rise in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.</P>
<P>We shall therefore utterly extinguish this melancholy thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker, in the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of those ob∣jects among which he seems to be incessantly employed, if we consider, in the first place, that he is omnipresent; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the second, that he is omniscient.</P>
<P>If we consider him in his omnipresence, his being passes through, actuates, and supports, the whole frame of nature. His creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is either so distant, so little, or so inconsiderable, which he does not essentially inhabit. His substance is within the substance of every being, whether material or imma∣terial, and as intimately present to it, as that being is to itself. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to move out of one place into another; or to withdraw himself from any thing he has created, or from any part of that space which he diffused and spread abroad to infinity. In short, to speak of him in the language of the old philosophers, he is a being whose centre is every where, and his circumference no where.</P>
<P>In the second place, he is omniscient as well as om∣nipresent. His omniscience indeed necessarily and na∣turally flows from his omnipresence. He cannot but be conscious of every motion that arises in the whole
<PB N="79" REF="035851_0116_100793A7BB128348"/>
material world, which he thus essentially pervades; and of every thought that is stirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united. Were the soul separate from the body, and with one glance of thought should start beyond the bounds of the creation; should it, for millions of years, continue its progress through infinite space, with the same activity, it would still find itself within the em∣brace of its Creator, and encompassed by the immensity of the Godhead.</P>
<P>In this consideration of the Almighty's omnipresence and omniscience, every uncomfortable thought va∣nishes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, especially such of his creatures who sear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this occasion: for, as it is impossible he should overlook any of his creatures, so we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, those who endeavour to recommend them∣selves to his notice; and, in unfeigned humility of heart, think themselves unworthy that he should be mindful of them.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Happiness is founded in Rectitude of Conduct.</HEAD>
<P>ALL men pursue good, and would be happy, if they knew how: not happy for minutes, and miserable for hours; but happy, if possible, through every part of their existence. Either, therefore, there is a good of this steady, durable kind, or there is not. If not, then all good must be transient and uncertain; and if so, an object of the lowest value, which can little deserve our attention or inquiry. But if there be a better good, such a good as we are seeking; like every other thing, it must be derived from some cause; and that cause must either be external, internal, or mixed; in as much as, except these three, there is no other possible. Now a steady, durable good, cannot be derived from an external cause; since all derived from externals must fluctuate as they fluctuate. By the same rule, it cannot be derived from a mixture of the two; because the part which is external, will proportionably destroy its essence. What then remains but the cause inter∣nal? the very cause which we have supposed, when we place the sovereign good in mind,—in rectitude of conduct.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Virtue Man's highest Interest.</HEAD>
<P>I FIND myself existing upon a little spot, surrounded every way by an immense unknown expansion.—Where am I? What sort of a place do I inhabit! Is it exactly accommodated in every instance to my con∣venience? Is there no excess of cold, none of heat, to offend me? Am I never annoyed by animals, either of my own, or a different kind? Is every thing subservient to me, as though I had ordered all myself? No—nothing like it—the farthest from it possible. The world appears not, then, originally made for the private convenience of the alone?—It does not. But is it not possible so to accommodate it, by my own particular industry? If to accommodate man and beast, heaven and earth, if this be beyond me, it is not possible. What consequence then follows; or can there be any other than this—If I seek an interest of my own detached from that of others, I seek an interest which is chimerical, and which can never have existence.</P>
<P>How then must I determine? Have I no interest at all? If I have not, I am stationed here to no purpose. But why no interest? Can I be contented with none but one separate and detached? Is a social interest, joined with others, such an absurdity as not to be ad∣mitted? The bee, the beaver, and the tribes of herding animals, are sufficient to convince me, that the thing is somewhere at least possible. How, then, am I assured that it is not equally true of man? Admit it; and what follows? If so, then honour and justice
<PB N="82" REF="035851_0119_100793B1A9322C50"/>
are my interest; then the whole train of moral virtues are my interest; without some portion of which, not even thieves can maintain society.</P>
<P>But, farther still—I stop not here—I pursue this social interest as far as I can trace my several relations. I pass from my own stock, my own neighbourhood, my own nation, to the whole race of mankind, as dispersed throughout the earth. Am I not related to them all, by the mutual aids of commerce, by the general in∣tercourse of arts and letters, by that common nature of which we all participate?</P>
<P>Again—I must have food and cloathing. Without a proper genial warmth, I instantly perish. Am I not related, in this view, to the very earth itself? to the distant sun, from whose beams I derive vigour? to that stupendous course and order of the infinite host of heaven, by which the times and seasons ever uniformly pass on? Were this order once confounded, I could not probably survive a moment; so absolutely do I depend on this common general welfare. What, then, have I to do, but to enlarge virtue into piety! Not only honour and justice, and what I owe to man, is my interest; but gratitude also, acquiescence, resignation, adoration, and all I owe to this great polity, and its great Governour our common Parent.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. The Injustice of an uncharitable Spirit.</HEAD>
<P>A SUSPICIOUS, uncharitable spirit is not only in∣consistent with all social virtue and happiness, but it is
<PB N="83" REF="035851_0120_100793B7370DCBB8"/>
also, in itself, unreasonable and unjust. In order to form sound opinions concerning characters and actions, two things are especially requisite, information and impartiality. But such as are most forward to decide unfavourably, are commonly destitute of both. Instead of possessing, or even requiring, full information, the grounds on which they proceed are frequently the most slight and frivolous. A tale, perhaps, which the idle have invented, the inquisitive have listened to, and the credulous have propagated; or a real incident which rumour, in carrying it along, has exaggerated and disguised, supplies them with materials of con∣fident assertion, and decisive judgment. From an action they presently look into the heart, and infer the motive. This supposed motive they conclude to be the ruling principle; and pronounce at once concern∣ing the whole character.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more contrary both to equity and to sound reason, than such precipitate judgments. Any man who attends to what passes within himself, may easily discern what a complicated system the human character is; and what a variety of circumstances must be taken into the account, in order to estimate it truly. No single instance of conduct whatever, is sufficient to determine it. As from one worthy action, it were credulity, not charity, to conclude a person to be free from all vice; so from one which is censurable, it is per∣fectly unjust to infer that the author of it is without conscience, and without merit. If we knew all the attending circumstances, it might appear in an excu∣sable light; nay, perhaps, under a commendable form. The motives of the actor may have been entirely diffe∣rent
<PB N="84" REF="035851_0121_100793B9EDD6F858"/>
from those which we ascribe to him; and where we suppose him impelled by bad design, he may have been prompted by conscience and mistaken principle. Ad∣mitting the action to have been in every view crimi∣nal, he may have been hurried into it through inad∣vertency and surprise. He may have sincerely repented; and the virtuous principle may have now regained its full vigour. Perhaps this was the corner of frailty; the quarter on which he lay open to the incursions of temptation; while the other avenues of his heart were firmly guarded by conscience.</P>
<P>It is therefore evident, that no part of the govern∣ment of temper deserves attention more, than to keep our minds pure from uncharitable prejudices, and open to candour and humanity in judging of others.—The worst consequences, both to ourselves and to society, follow from the opposite spirit.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The misfortunes of men mostly chargeable on themselves.</HEAD>
<P>WE find man placed in a world, where he has by no means the disposal of the events that happen. Ca∣lamities sometimes befall the worthiest and the best, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where nothing is left them, but to acknowledge and to sub∣mit to the high hand of Heaven. For such visitations of trial, many good and wise reasons can be assigned, which the present subject leads me not to discuss. But
<PB N="85" REF="035851_0122_100793BBA7D3F7F8"/>
though those unavoidable calamities make a part, yet they make not the chief part, of the vexations and sor∣rows that distress human life. A multitude of evils beset us, for the source of which we must look to ano∣ther quarter.—No sooner has any thing in the health, or in the circumstances of men, gone cross to their wish, than they begin to talk of the unequal distri∣bution of the good things of this life; they envy the condition of others; they repine at their own lot, and fret against the Ruler of the world.</P>
<P>Full of these sentiments, one man pines under a bro∣ken constitution. But let us ask him, whether he can, fairly and honestly, assign no cause for this but the un∣known decree of Heaven? Has he duly valued the blessing of health, and always observed the rules of virtue and sobriety? Has he been moderate in his life, and temperate in all his pleasures? If now he is only paying the price of his former, perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has he any title to complain, as if he were suffering unjustly? Were we to survey the chambers of sickness and distress, we should often find them peo∣pled with the victims of intemperance and sensuality, and with the children of vitious indolence and sloth. Among the thousands who languish there, we should find the proportion of innocent sufferers to be small. We should see faded youth, premature old age, and the prospect of an untimely grave, to be the portion of multitudes who, in one way or other, have brought those evils on themselves; while yet these martyrs of vice and folly have the assurance to arraign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he hard fate of man, and to "fret against the Lord.</P>
<P>But you, perhaps, complain of hardships of another kind; of the injustice of the world; of the poverty
<PB N="86" REF="035851_0123_100793BE825DFCD0"/>
which you suffer, and the discouragements under which you labour; of the crosses and disappointments of which your life has been doomed to be full.—Be∣fore you give too much scope to your discontent, let me desire you to reflect impartially upon your past train of life. Have not sloth, or pride, or ill temper, or sin∣ful passions, misled you often from the path of sound and wise conduct? Have you not been wanting to your∣selves in improving those opportunities which Provi∣dence offered you, for bettering and advancing your state? If you have chosen to indulge your humour, or your taste, in the gratifications of indolence or plea∣sure, can you complain because others, in preference to you, have obtained those advantages which natural∣ly belong to useful labours, and honourable pursuits? Have not the consequences of some false steps, into which your passions, or your pleasures, have betrayed you, pursued you through much of your life; tainted, perhaps, your characters, involved you in embarrass∣ments, or sunk you into neglect?—It is an old saying, that every man is the artificer of his own fortune in the world. It is certain, that the world seldom turns wholly against a man, unless through his own fault. "Reli∣gion is," in general, "profitable unto all things." Virtue, diligence, and industry, joined with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the surest road to pros∣perity; and where men fail of attaining it, their want of success is far oftener owing to their having deviated from that road, than to their having encountered insu∣perable bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in prudence. Others, by being sickle and changeable, are distrusted by all.—The case
<PB N="87" REF="035851_0124_100793C2CD3A1008"/>
commonly is, that men seek to ascribe their disappoint∣ments to any cause, rather than to their own miscon∣duct; and when they can devise no other cause, they lay them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices; their vices into misfortunes; and in their misfortunes they "murmur against Providence." They are doubly unjust towards their Creator. In their prosperity, they are apt to ascribe their success to their own diligence, rather than to his blessing; and in their adversity, they impute their distresses to his providence, not to their own misbehaviour. Whereas, the truth is the very reverse of this. "Every good and every perfect gift cometh from above;" and of evil and misery, man is the author to himself.</P>
<P>When from the condition of individuals, we look abroad to the public state of the world, we meet with more proofs of the truth of this assertion. We see great societies of men torn in pieces by intestine dissen∣tions, tumults, and civil commotions. We see mighty armies going forth, in formidable array, against each other, to cover the earth with blood, and to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils these are, to which this miserable world is exposed.—But are these evils, I beseech you, to be imputed to God? Was it he who sent forth slaughtering armies into the field, or who filled the peaceful city with massacres and blood? Are these miseries any other, than the bit∣ter fruit of men's violent and disorderly passions? Are they not clearly to be traced to the ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and to the tur∣bulence of the people?—Let us lay them entirely out of the account, in thinking of Providence; and let us think only of the "foolishness of man." Did man control
<PB N="88" REF="035851_0125_100793C45C5FA048"/>
his passions, and form his conduct according to the dic∣tates of wisdom, humanity, and virtue, the earth would no longer be desolated by cruelty; and human societies would live in order, harmony and peace. In those scenes of mischief and violence which fill the world, let man behold, with shame, the picture of his vices, his ignorance, and folly. Let him be humbled by the mortifying view of his own perverseness; but let not "his heart fret against the Lord."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. On disinterested Friendship.</HEAD>
<P>I AM informed that certain Greek writers (philoso∣phers, it seems, in the opinion of their countrymen) have advanced some very extraordinary positions re∣lating to friendship; as, indeed, what subject is there, which these subtle geniuses have not tortured with their sophistry?</P>
<P>The authors to whom I refer, dissuade their disciples from entering into any strong attachments, as unavoid∣ably creating supernumerary disquietudes to those who engage in them; and, as every man has more than suffi∣cient to call forth his solicitude, in the course of his own affairs, it is a weakness they contend, anxiously to in∣volve himself in the concerns of others. They recom∣mend it also, in all connexions of this kind, to hold the bands of union extremely loose; so as always to have it in one's power to straiten or relax them, as circumstances and situations shall render most expe∣dient. They add, as a capital article of their doctrine, that, "to live exempt from cares, is an essential in∣gredient
<PB N="89" REF="035851_0126_100793C716E1C9C0"/>
to constitute human happiness: but an ingre∣dient, however, which he, who voluntarily distresses himself with cares, in which he has no necessary and personal interest, must never hope to possess."</P>
<P>I have been told likewise, that there is another set of pretended philosophers, of the same country, whose tenets, concerning this subject, are of a still more illi∣beral and ungenerous cast.</P>
<P>The proposition they attempt to establish, is, that "friendship is an affair of self-interest entirely; and that the proper motive for engaging in it, is, not in order to gratify the kind and benevolent affections, but for the benefit of that assistance and support which is to be derived from the connexion." Accordingly they assert, that those persons are most disposed to have recourse to auxiliary alliances of this kind, who are least qualified by nature, or fortune, to depend upon their own strength and powers: the weaker sex, for instance, being generally more inclined to engage in friendships, than the male part of our species; and those who are depressed by indigence, or labouring under misfortunes, than the wealthy and the pros∣perous.</P>
<P>Excellent and obliging sages, these, undoubtedly! To strike out the friendly affections from the moral world, would be like extinguishing the sun in the na∣tural: each of them being the source of the best and most grateful satisfactions, that Heaven has conferred on the sons of men. But I should be glad to know, what the real value of this boasted exemption from care, which they promise their disciples, justly amounts to? an exemption flattering to self-love, I confess; but which upon many occurrences in human life, should
<PB N="90" REF="035851_0127_100793C9DDB020D0"/>
be rejected with the utmost disdain. For nothing, surely, can be more inconsistent with a well-poised and manly spirit, than to decline engaging in any laudable action, or to be discouraged from persevering in it, by an apprehension of the trouble and solicitude, with which it may probably be attended. Virtue herself, indeed, ought to be totally renounced, if it be right to avoid every possible means that may be productive of uneasiness: for who, that is actuated by her principles, can observe the conduct of an opposite character, with∣out being affected with some degree of secret dissatis∣faction? Are not the just, the brave, and the good, necessarily exposed to the disagreeable emotions of dislike and aversion, when they respectively meet with instances of fraud, of cowardice, or of villainy? It is an essential property of every well constituted mind, to be affected with pain, or pleasure, according to the nature of those moral appearances that present them∣selves to observation.</P>
<P>If sensibility, therefore, be not incompatible with true wisdom, (and it surely is not, unless we suppose that philosophy deadens every finer feeling of our na∣ture,) what just reason can be assigned, why the sym∣pathetic sufferings which may result from friendship, should be a sufficient inducement for banishing that ge∣nerous affection from the human breast? Extinguish all emotions of the heart, and what difference will remain, I do not say between man and brute, but between man and a mere inanimate clod? Away then with those austere philosophers, who represent virtue as harden∣ing the soul against all the softer impressions of huma∣nity! The fact, certainly, is much otherwise. A truly good man is, upon many occasions, extremely sus∣ceptible
<PB N="91" REF="035851_0128_100793CC91CD28D0"/>
of tender sentiments; and his heart expands with joy, or shrinks with sorrow, as good or ill fortune accompanies his friend. Upon the whole, then, it may fairly be concluded, that, as in the case of virtue, so in that of friendship, those painful sensations, which may sometimes be produced by the one, as well as by the other, are equally insufficient grounds for excluding either of them from taking possession of our bosoms.</P>
<P>They who insist that "utility is the first and prevail∣ing motive, which induces mankind to enter into par∣ticular friendships," appear to me to divest the associ∣ation of its most amiable and engaging principle. For, to a mind right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disposed, it is not so much the bene∣fits received, as the affectionate zeal from which they flow, that gives them their best and most valuable re∣commendation. It is so far indeed from being verified by fact, that a sense of our wants is the original cause of forming these amicable alliances; that, on the con∣trary, it is observable, that none have been more dis∣tinguished in their friendships than those, whose power and opulence, but, above all, whose superior virtue (a much firmer support) have raised them above every necessity of having recourse to the assistance of others.</P>
<P>The true distinction, then, in this question is, that "although friendship is certainly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ductive of utility, yet utility is not the primary motive of friendship." Those selfish sensualists, therefore, who, lulled in the lap of luxury, presume to maintain the reverse, have surely no claim to attention; as they are neither quali∣fied by reflection, nor experience, to be competent judges of the subject.</P>
<P>Is there a man upon the face of the earth, who would deliberately accept of all the wealth, and all the afflu∣ence
<PB N="92" REF="035851_0129_100793CF92872A00"/>
this world can bestow, if offered to him upon the severe terms of his being unconnected with a single mortal whom he could love, or by whom he should be beloved? This would be to lead the wretched life of a detested tyrant, who, amidst perpetual suspicions and alarms, passes his miserable days a stranger to every tender sentiment; and utterly precluded from the heart∣felt satisfactions of friendship.</P>

<P>But among these, and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the soul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progress of the soul to its perfection, without a possibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have seen opened and improved by others, who have written on this subject, though it seems to me to carry a very great weight with it. How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the soul, which is capable of such immense perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, shall fall away into nothing, almost as soon as it is created? Are such abilities made for no purpose? A brute arrives at a point of perfection, that he can never pass: in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of; and were he to live ten thousand more, would be the same thing he is at present. Were a hu∣man soul thus at a stand in her accomplishments; were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of farther enlargements; I could imagine she might fall away in∣sensibly, and drop at once into a state of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progress of improvements, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having just looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few discoveries of his infinite goodness, wisdom, and power, must perish at her first setting out, and in the very beginning of her inquiries?</P>
<P>A man, considered only in his present state, seems sent into the world merely to propagate his kind. He provides himself with a successor; and immediately quits
<PB N="94" REF="035851_0131_100793D538D721D8"/>
his post to make room for him. He does not seem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not surprising to consider in animals, which are formed for our use, and can finish their business in a short life. The silk-worm, after having spun her task, lays her eggs and dies. But a man cannot take in his full mea∣sure of knowledge, has not time to subdue his passions, establish his soul in virtue, and come up to the per∣fection of his nature, before he is hurried off the stage. Would an infinitely wise Being make such glorious creatures for so mean a purpose? Can he delight in the production of such abortive intelligences, such short-lived reasonable beings? Would he give us ta∣lents that are not to be exerted? capacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wisdom which shines through all his works, in the formation of man, without looking on this world as only a nursery for the next; and without believing that the several ge∣nerations of rational creatures, which rise up and disap∣pear in such quick successions, are only to receive their first rudiments of existence here, and afterwards to be transplanted into a more friendly climate, where they may spread and flourish to all eternity?</P>
<P>There is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion, than this of the perpetual progress, which the soul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever arriving at a pe∣riod in it. To look upon the soul as going on from strength to strength; to consider that she is to shine for ever with new accessions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that she will be still adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge; carries in it something wonderfully agreeable to that ambition, which is natural
<PB N="95" REF="035851_0132_100793D93B0494E0"/>
to the mind of man. Nay, it must be a prospect pleasing to God himself, to see his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes; and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of resemblance.</P>
<P>Methinks this single consideration, of the progress of a finite spirit to perfection, will be sufficient to ex∣tingush all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in superior. That cherub, which now appears as a god to a human soul, knows very well, that the period will come about in eternity, when the human soul shall be as perfect as he himself now is: nay, when she shall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as she now falls short of it. It is true, the higher nature still advances, and by that means preserves his distance and superiority in the scale of being; but he knows that how high soever the station is of which he stands possessed at present, the inferior nature will at length mount up to it; and shine forth in the same degree of glory.</P>
<P>With what astonishment and veneration, may we look into our own souls, where there are such hidden stores of virtue and knowledge, such inexhausted sources of perfection! We know not yet what we shall be; nor will it ever enter into the heart of man, to conceive the glory that will be always in reserve for him. The soul, considered with its Creator, is like one of those mathematical lines, that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a possibility of touching it: and can there be a thought so transport∣ing, as to consider ourselves in these perpetual ap∣proaches to HIM, who is the standard not only of per∣fection, but of happiness!</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. The Seasons.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the great blessings and wonders of the creation, may be classed the regularities of times and seasons. Immediately after the flood, the sacred pro∣mise was made to man, that seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, should continue to the very end of all things. Accor∣dingly, in obedience to that promise, the rotation is constantly presenting us with some useful and agree∣able alteration; and all the pleasing novelty of life arises from these natural changes: nor are we less in∣debted to them for many of its solid comforts. It has been frequently the task of the moralist and poet, to mark, in polished periods, the particular charms and conveniences of every change; and, indeed, such dis∣criminate observations upon natural variety, cannot be undelightful; since the blessing, which every month brings along with it, is a fresh instance of the wisdom and bounty of that Providence, which regulates the glories of the year. We glow as we contemplate; we feel a propensity to adore, whilst we enjoy. In the time of seed-sowing, it is the season of <HI>confidence:</HI> the grain which the husbandman trusts to the bosom of the
<PB N="97" REF="035851_0134_100793DE340BA778"/>
earth shall, haply, yield its seven-fold rewards. Spring presents us with a scene of lively <HI>expectation.</HI> That which was before sown begins now to discover signs of successful vegetation. The labourer observes the change, and anticipates the harvest: he watches the progress of nature, and smiles at her influence; while the man of contemplation walks forth with the even∣ing, amidst the fragrance of flowers, and promises of plenty; nor returns to his cottage till darkness closes the scene upon his eye. Then cometh the harvest, when the large wish is satisfied, and the granaries of nature are loaded with the means of life, even to a luxury of abundance. The powers of language are unequal to the description of this happy season. It is the carnival of nature: sun and shade, coolness and quietude, cheerfulness and melody, love and gratitude, unite to render every scene of summer delightful.—The division of light and darkness is one of the kindest efforts of Omnipotent Wisdom. Day and night yield us contrary blessings; and, at the same time, assist each other, by giving fresh lustre to the delights of both. Amidst the glare of day, and bustle of life, how could we sleep? Amidst the gloom of darkness, how could we labour?</P>
<P>How wise, how benignant, then, is the proper divi∣sion! The hours of light are adapted to activity; and those of darkness, to rest. Ere the day is passed, ex∣ercise and nature prepare us for the pillow; and by the time that the morning returns, we are again able to meet it with a smile. Thus, every season has a charm peculiar to itself; and every moment affords some interesting innovation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. The Cataract of Niagara in Canada, North America.</HEAD>
<P>THIS amazing fall of water is made by the River St. Lawrence, in its passage from lake Erie into the lake Ontario. The St. Lawrence is one of the largest rivers in the world; and yet the whole of its waters are here poured down, by a fall of a hundred and fifty feet perpendicular. It is not easy to bring the imagi∣nation to correspond to the greatness of the scene. A river extremely deep and rapid, and that serves to drain the waters of almost all North America into the Atlantic Ocean, is here poured precipitately down a ledge of rocks, that rises, like a wall, across the whole bed of its stream. The river, a little above, is near three quarters of a mile broad; and the rocks, where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over. Their direction is not straight across, but hollowing inwards like a horse-shoe: so that the cataract, which bends to the shape of the obstacle, rounding inwards, pre∣sents a kind of theatre the most tremendous in nature. Just in the middle of this circular wall of waters, a little island, that has braved the fury of the current, pre∣sents one of its points, and divides the stream at top into two parts; but they unite again long before they reach the bottom. The noise of the fall is heard at the dis∣tance of several leagues; and the fury of the waters, at the termination of their fall, is inconceivable. The dash∣ing produces a mist that rises to the very clouds; and which forms a most beautiful rainbow, when the sun shines. It will readily be supposed, that such a cata∣ract entirely destroys the navigation of the stream;

and yet some Indian canoes, as it is said, have ventured down it with safety.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. The Grotto of Antiparos.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the subterraneous caverns now known, the grotto of Antiparos is the most remarkable, as well for its extent, as for the beauty of its sparry incrusta∣tions. This celebrated cavern was first explored by one Magni, an Italian traveller, about a hundred years ago, at Antiparos, an inconsiderable island of the Ar∣chipelago. "Having been informed," says he, "by the natives of Paros, that in the little island of Anti∣paros, which lies about two miles from the former, of a gigantic statue that was to be seen at the mouth of a cavern in that place, it was resolved that we (the French Consul and himself) should pay it a visit. In pursuance of this resolution, after we had landed on the island, and walked about four miles through the midst of beautiful plains, and sloping woodlands, we at length came to a little hill, on the side of which yawned a most horrid cavern, that with its gloom at first struck us with terror, and almost repressed curio∣sity. Recovering the first surprise, however, we en∣tered boldly; and had not proceeded above twenty paces, when the supposed statue of the giant presented itself to our view. We quickly perceived, that what the ignorant natives had been terrified at as a giant, was nothing more than a sparry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the roof of the cave, and by -deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> hardening into a figure, which their fears had
<PB N="100" REF="035851_0137_100793E6B8715B28"/>
formed into a monster. Incited by this extraordinary appearance, we were induced to proceed still further, in quest of nev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ventures in this subterranean abode. As we proceeded, new wonders offered themselves; the spars, formed into trees and shruos, presented a kind of petrified grove; some white, some green; and all receding in due perspective. They struck us with the more amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of Nature, who, hitherto in solitude, had, in her playful moments, dressed the scene, as if for her own amusement."</P>
<P>"We had as yet seen but a few of the wonders of the place; and we were introduced only into the portico of this amazing temple. In one corner of this half illuminated recess, there appeared an opening of about three feet wide, which seemed to lead to a place to∣tally dark, and which one of the natives assured us contained nothing more than a reservoir of water. Upon this information, we made an experiment, by throwing down some stones, which rumbling along the sides of the descent for some time, the sound seemed at last quashed in a bed of water. In order, however, to be more certain, we sent in a Levantine mariner, who, by the promise of a good reward, with a flambeau in his land, ventured into this narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a quarter of an hour, he returned, bearing in his hand, some beautiful pieces of white spar, which art could neither imitate nor equal. Upon being informed by him that the place was full of these beautiful incrustations, I ventured in once more with him, about fifty paces, anxiously and cautiously descending by a steep and dangerous way. Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which led into
<PB N="101" REF="035851_0138_100793E9CD62F8B0"/>
a spacious amphitheatre, (if I may so call it,) still deeper than any other part, we returned, and being provided with a ladder, flambeau, and other things to expedite our descent, our whole company, man by man, ventured into the same opening; and descending one after another, we at last saw ourselves all together in the most magnificent part of the cavern."</P>

<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IV. The Grotto of Antiparos continued.</HEAD>
<P>"OUR candles being now all lighted up, and the whole place completely illuminated, never could the eye be presented with a more glittering, or a more magnificent scene. The whole roof hung with solid icicles, transparent as glass, yet solid as marble. The eye could scarcely reach the lofty and noble cieling; the sides were regularly formed with spars; and the whole presented the idea of a magnificent theatre, il∣luminated with an immense profusion of lights. The floor consisted of solid marble: and, in several places, magnificent columns, thrones, altars, and other objects, appeared, as if nature had designed to mock the cu∣riosities of art. Our voices, upon speaking or singing, were redoubled to an astonishing loudness; and upon the firing of a gun, the noise and reverberations were almost deafening. In the midst of this grand amphi∣theatre rose a concretion of about fifteen feet high, that, in some measure, resembled an altar; from which, taking the hint, we caused mass to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there. The beautiful columns that shot up round the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appeared like candlesticks; and many other natural
<PB N="102" REF="035851_0139_100793EDC81F8760"/>
objects represented the customary ornaments of this rite."</P>
<P>"Below even this spacious grotto there seemed another cavern; down which I ventured with my former mariner, and descended about fifty paces by means of a rope. I at last arrived at a small spot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that of the amphitheatre, being composed of soft clay, yielding to the pressure, and in which I thrust a stick to the depth of six feet. In this, however, as above, numbers of the most beautiful crystals were formed; one of which, particularly, resembled a table. Upon our egress from this amazing cavern, we per∣ceived a Greek inscription upon a rock at the mouth, but so obliterated by time, that we could not read it distinctly. It seemed to import that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come hither; but whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to inform us." This account of so beau∣tiful and striking a scene, may serve to give us some idea of the subterraneous wonders of nature.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Earthquake at Catanea.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the earthquakes most particularly described in history, is that which happened in the year 1693; the damages of which were chiefly felt in Sicily, but its motion was perceived in Germany, France, and England. It extended to a circumference of two thousand six hundred leagues; chiefly affecting the

sea-coasts, and great rivers; more perceivable also upon the mountains than in the valleys. Its motions were so rapid, that persons who lay at their length, were tossed from side to side, as upon a rolling bil∣low. The walls were dashed from their founda∣tions; and no fewer than fifty-four cities, with an incredible number of villages, were either destroyed or greatly damaged. The city of Catanea, in parti∣cular, was utterly overthrown. A traveller, who was on his way thither, perceived, at the distance of some miles, a black cloud, like night, hanging over the place. The sea, all of a sudden, began to roar; Mount AEtna to send forth great spires of flame; and soon after a shock ensued, with a noise, as if all the artillery in the world had been at once discharged. Our traveller, being obliged to alight instantly, felt himself raised a foot from the ground; and turning his eyes to the city, he with amazement saw nothing but a thick cloud of dust in the air. The birds flew about astonished; the sun was darkened, the beasts ran howling from the hills; and, although the shock did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thousand of the inhabitants of Sicily perished in the ruins. Catanea, to which city the describer was tra∣velling, seemed the principal scene of ruin; its place only was to be found; and not a footstep of its for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> magnificence was to be seen remaining.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. Creation.</HEAD>
<P>IN the progress of the Divine works and govern∣ment, there arrived a period, in which this earth was to be called into existence. When the signal moment, predestined from all eternity, was come, the Deity arose in his might; and with a word created the world.—What an illustrious moment was that, when, from non∣existence, there sprang at once into being, this mighty globe, on which so many millions of creatures now dwell?—No preparatory measures were required. No long circuit of means was employed. "He spake; and it was done: He commanded; and it stood fast. The earth was at first without form, and void; and dark∣ness was on the face of the deep." The Almighty sur∣veyed the dark abyss; and fixed bounds to the several divisions of nature. He said, "Let there be light; and there was light." Then appeared the sea, and the dry land. The mountains rose; and the rivers flowed. The sun and moon began their course in the skies. Herbs and plants clothed the ground. The air, the earth, and the waters, were stored with their respective inhabitants. At last, man was made after the image of God. He appeared, walking with coun∣tenance erect; and received his Creator's benediction, as the Lord of this new world. The Almighty beheld his work when it was finished; and pronounced it GOOD. Superior beings saw with wonder this new accession to existence. "The morning stars sang to∣gether; and all the sons of God shouted for joy."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. On Charity.</HEAD>
<P>CHARITY is the same with benevolence or love; and is the term uniformly employed, in the New Tes∣tament, to denote all the good affections which we ought to bear towards one another. It consists not in speculative ideas of general benevolence, floating in the head, and leaving the heart, as speculations too often do, untouched and cold. Neither is it confined to that indolent good nature, which makes us rest satisfied with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of service to any. True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a single virtue; but a disposition residing in the heart, as a fountain whence all the virtues of benignity, candour, forbearance, ge∣nerosity, compassion, and liberality, flow, as so many native streams. From general good-will to all, it ex∣tends its influence particularly to those with whom we stand in nearest connexion, and who are directly within the sphere of our good offices. From the country or community to which we belong, it de∣scends to the smaller associations of neighbourhood, re∣lations, and friends; and spreads itself over the whole circle of social and domestic life. I mean not that it imports a promiscuous undistinguishing affection, which gives every man an equal title to our love. Charity, if we should endeavour to carry it so far, would be ren∣dered an impracticable virtue; and would resolve it∣self into mere words, without affecting the heart. True charity attempts not to shut our eyes to the
<PB N="106" REF="035851_0143_100793F960DFB9C8"/>
distinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts equally to those who befriend, and those who injure us. It reserves our esteem for good men, and our complacency for our friends. Towards our enemies it inspires forgiveness, humanity, and a solici∣tude for their welfare. It breathes universal candour, and liberality of sentiment. It forms gentleness of temper, and dictates affability of manners. It prompts corresponding sympathies with them who rejoice, and them who weep. It teaches us to slight and despise no man. Charity is the comforter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppressed, the reconciler of dif∣ferences, the intercessor for offenders. It is faithful∣ness in the friend, public spirit in the magistrate, equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the sovereign, and loyalty in the subject. In parents, it is care and attention; in children, it is reverence and submission. In a word, it is the soul of social life. It is the sun that enlivens and cheers the abodes of men. It is "like the dew of Hermon," says the Psalmist, "and the dew that descendeth on the moun∣tains of Zion, where the Lord commanded the bless∣ing, even life for evermore."</P>

<P>Feeble are all pleasures in which the heart has no share. The selfish gratifications of the bad, are both narrow in their circle, and short in their duration. But prosperity is redoubled to a good man, by his ge∣nerous use of it. It is reflected back upon him from every one whom he makes happy. In the intercourse of domestic affection, in the attachment of friends, the gratitude of dependents, the esteem and good-will of all who know him, he sees blessings must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> round him, on every side. "When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: Because I delivered the poor that cried, the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The blessing of him that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing with joy.

He flourishes, not like a tree in some soli∣tary desert, which scatters its blossoms to the wind, and communicates neither fruit nor shade to any living thing: but like a tree in the midst of an inhabited country, which to some affords friendly shelter, to others, fruit; which is not only admired by all for its

<P>GREATNESS confers no exemption from the cares and sorrows of life: its share of them frequently bears a melancholy proportion to its exaltation. This the monarch of Israel experienced. He sought in piety, that peace which he could not find in empire; and al∣leviated the disquietudes of state, with the exercises of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. His invaluable Psalms convey those com∣forts to others, which they afforded to himself. Com∣posed upon particular occasions, yet designed for ge∣neral use; delivered out as services for Israelites under the Law, yet no less adapted to the circumstances of Christians under the Gospel; they present religion to us in the most engaging dress; communicating truths which philosophy could never investigate, in a style which poetry can never equal; while history is made the vehicle of prophecy, and creation lends all its charms to paint the glories of redemption. Calcu∣lated alike to profit and to please, they inform the un∣derstanding, elevate the affections, and entertain the imagination. Indited under the influence of HIM, to whom all hearts are known, and all events foreknown, they suit mankind in all situations; grateful as the manna which descended from above, and conformed itself to every palate.</P>
<P>The fairest productions of human wit, after a few

perusals, like gathered flowers, wither in our hands, and lose their fragrancy: but these unfading planet of paradise become, as we are accustomed to them, still more and more beautiful; their bloom appears to be daily heightened; fresh odours are emitted, and new sweets extracted from them. He who hath once tasted their excellencies, will desire to taste them again; and he who tastes them oftenest, will relish them best.</P>
<P>And now, could the Author flatter himself, that any one would take half the pleasure in reading his work, which he has taken in writing it, he would not fear the loss of his labour. The employment detached him from the bustle and hurry of life, the din of politics and the noise of folly. Vanity and vexation flew away for a season; care and disquietude came not near his dwelling. He arose, fresh as the morning, to his task; the silence of the night invited him to pursue it; and he can truly say, that food and rest were not preferred before it. Every psalm improved infinitely upon his acquaintance with it, and no one gave him uneasiness but the last; for then he grieved that his work was done. Happier hours than those which have been spent in these meditations on the songs of Sion, he ne∣ver expects to see in this world. Very pleasantly did they pass; they moved smoothly and swiftly along; for when thus engaged, he counted no time. They are gone, but they have left a relish and a fragrance upon the mind; and the remembrance of them is sweet.</P>

<P>THE merit of this prince, both in private and pub∣lic life, may, with advantage, be set in opposition to that of any monarch or citizen, which the annals of any age, or any nation, can present to us. He seems, indeed, to be the complete model of that perfect cha∣racter, which, under the denomination of a sage or wise man, the philosophers have been fond of deli∣neating, rather as a fiction of their imagination, than in hopes of ever seeing it reduced to practice: so hap∣pily were all his virtues tempered together; so justly were they blended; and so powerfully did each pre∣vent the other from exceeding its proper bounds.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI. Character of Queen Elizabeth.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few personages in history, who have been more exposed to the calumny of enemies, and the adulation of friends, than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there scarcely is any, whose reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous consent of po∣sterity. The unusual length of her administration, and the strong features of her character, were able to over∣come all prejudices; and, obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers some∣what of their panegyrics, have, at last, in spite of poli∣tical factions, and what is more, of religious animosities, produced a uniform judgment with regard to her con∣duct. Her vigour, her constancy, her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, and address, are allowed to me∣rit the highest praises; and appear not to have been surpassed by any person who ever filled a throne: a conduct less rigorous, less imperious, more sincere, more indulgent to her people, would have been requi∣site to form a perfect character. By the force of her mind, she controlled all her more active and stronger qualities; and prevented them from running into ex∣cess. Her heroism was exempted from all temerity; her frugality from avarice; her friendship from par∣tiality; her enterprise from turbulency and a vain am∣bition. She guarded not herself, with equal care, or
<PB N="112" REF="035851_0149_10079408E3DA92D8"/>
equal success, from less infirmities; the rivalship of beauty, the desire of admiration, the jealousy of love, and the sallies of anger.</P>
<P>Her singular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over herself, she soon obtained an uncontrolled ascendant over the people. Few sove∣reigns of England succeeded to the throne in more difficult circumstances; and none ever conducted the government with such uniform success and felicity.—Though unacquainted with the practice of toleration, the true secret for managing religious factions, she pro∣served her people by her superior prudence, from those confusions in which theological controversy had in∣volved all the neighbouring nations; and though her enemies were the most powerful princes of Europe, the most active, the most enterprising, the least scru∣pulous, she was able, by her vigour, to make deep im∣pressions on their state; her own greatness meanwhile remaining untouched and unimpaired.</P>
<P>The wise ministers and brave men who flourished during her reign, share the praise of her success; but, instead of lessening the applause due to her, they make great addition to it. They owed, all of them, their advancement to her choice; they were supported by her constancy; and, with all their ability, they were never able to acquire an undue ascendant over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, she remained equally mistress. The force of the tender passions was great over her, but the force of her mind was still su∣perior: and the combat which her victory visibly cost her, serves only to display the firmness of her resolu∣tion, and the loftiness of her ambitious sentiments.</P>

The same of this princess, though it has surmounted the prejudices both of faction and of bigotry, yet lies still exposed to another prejudice, which is more durable, because more natural; and which, according to the different views in which we survey her, is ca∣pable either of exalting beyond measure, or diminish∣ing, the lustre of her character. This prejudice is founded on the consideration of her sex. When we contemplate her as a woman, we are apt to be struck with the highest admiration of her qualities and ex∣tensive capacity; but we are also apt to require some more softness of disposition, some greater lenity of tem∣per, some of those amiable weaknesses by which her sex is distinguished. But the true method of estimating her merit, is, to lay aside all these considerations, and to consider her merely as a rational being, placed in authority, and intrusted with the government of man∣kind.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. On the Slavery of Vice.</HEAD>
<P>THE slavery produced by vice appears in the de∣pendence under which it brings the sinner, to circum∣stances of external fortune. One of the favourite cha∣racters of liberty, is the independence it bestows. He who is truly a freeman is above all servile compliances, and abject subjection. He is able to rest upon himself; and while he regards his superiors with proper defe∣rence, neither debases himself by cringing to them, nor is tempted to purchase their favour by dishonourable means. But the sinner has forfeited every privilege of
<PB N="114" REF="035851_0151_1007940F8138D5F0"/>
this nature. His passions and habits render him an abso∣lute dependent on the world, and the world's favour; on the uncertain goods of fortune, and the fickle humours of men. For it is by these he subsists, and among these his happiness is sought; according as his passions de∣termine him to pursue pleasures; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iches, or preferments. Having no fund within himself whence to draw enjoy∣ment, his only resource is in things without. His hopes and fears all hang upon the world. He partakes in all its vicissitudes; and is moved and shaken by every wind of fortune. This is to be in the strictest sense a slave to the world.</P>
<P>Religion and virtue, on the other hand, confer on the mind principles of noble independence. "The upright man is satisfied from himself." He despises not the advantages of fortune, but he centers not his happiness in them. With a moderate share of them he can be contented; and contentment is felicity. Happy in his own integrity, conscious of the esteem of good men, reposing firm trust in the providence, and the promises of God, he is exempted from servile depend∣ence on other things. He can wrap himself up in a good conscience, and look forward, without terror, to the change of the world. Let all things shift around him as they please, he believes that, by the Divine ordination, they shall be made to work together in the issue for his good: And therefore, having much to hope from God, and little to fear from the world, he can be easy in every state. One who possesses within himself such an establishment of mind, is truly free. But shall I call that man free, who has nothing that is his own, no property assured; whose very heart is not his own, but rendered the appendage of external things, and
<PB N="115" REF="035851_0152_100794120CF9CED0"/>
the sport of fortune? Is that man free, let his outward condition be ever so splendid, whom his imperious passions detain at their call, whom they send forth at their pleasure, to drudge and toil, and to beg his only enjoyment from the casualties of the world? Is he free, who must flatter and lie to compass his ends, who must bear with this man's caprice, and that man's scorn; must profess friendship where he hates, and respect where he contemns; who is not at liberty to appear in his own colours, nor to speak his own sen∣timents; who dares not be honest, lest he should be poor?—Believe it, no chains bind so hard, no fet∣ters are so heavy, as those which fasten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world; no dependence is more contemptible than that under which the volup∣tuous, the covetous, or the ambitious man, lies to the means of pleasure, gain, or power. Yet this is the boasted liberty, which vice promises, as the recom∣pense of setting us free from the salutary restraints of virtue.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. The Man of Integrity.</HEAD>
<P>IT will not take much time to delineate the charac∣ter of the man of integrity, as by its nature it is a plain one, and easily understood. He is one, who makes it his constant rule to follow the road of duty, according as the word of God, and the voice of his conscience, point it out to him. He is not guided merely by affections, which may sometimes give the
<PB N="116" REF="035851_0153_1007941399DFFA48"/>
colour of virtue to a loose and unstable character. The upright man is guided by a fixed principle of mind, which determines him to esteem nothing but what is honourable; and to abhor whatever is base and unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence we find him ever the same; at all times, the trusty friend, the af∣fectionate relation, the conscientious man of business, the pious worshipper, the public spirited citizen. He assumes no borrowed appearance. He seeks no mask to cover him; for he acts no studied part; but he is indeed what he appears to be, full of truth, candour, and humanity. In all his pursuits, he knows no path but the fair and direct one; aud would much rather fail of success, than attain it by reproachful means. He never shows us a smiling countenance, while he medi∣tates evil against us in his heart. He never praises us among our friends; and then joins in traducing us among our enemies. We shall never find one part of his character at variance with another. In his man∣ners, he is simple and unaffected; in all his proceed∣ings, open and consistent.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. On Gentleness.</HEAD>
<P>I begin with distinguishing true gentleness from passive tameness of spirit, and from unlimited com∣pliance with the manners of others. That passive tameness, which submits, without opposition, to every encroachment of the violent and assuming, forms no part of Christian duty; but, on the contrary, is de∣structive of general happiness and order. That unli∣mited
<PB N="117" REF="035851_0154_100794184E711138"/>
complaisance, which, on every occasion, falls in with the opinions and manners of others, is so far from being a virtue, that it is itself a vice, and the parent of many vices. It overthrows all steadiness of prin∣ciple; and produces that sinful conformity with the world, which taints the whole character. In the pre∣sent corrupted state of human manners, always to as∣sent and to comply, is the very worst maxim we can adopt. It is impossible to support the purity and dig∣nity of Christian morals, without opposing the world on various occasions, even though we should stand alone. That gentleness therefore which belongs to vir∣tue, is to be carefully distinguished from the mean spi∣rit of cowards, and the fawning assent of sycophants. It renounces no just right from fear. It gives up no important truth from flattery. It is indeed not only consistent with a firm mind, but it necessarily requires a manly spirit, and a fixed principle, in order to give it any real value. Upon this solid ground only, the polish of gentleness can with advantage be superin∣duced.</P>
<P>It stands opposed, not to the most determined regard for virtue and truth, but to harshness and severity, to pride and arrogance, to violence and oppression. It is properly, that part of the great virtue of charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain to any of our brethren. Compassion prompts us to relieve their wants. Forbearance prevents us from retaliating their injuries. Meekness restrains our angry passions; can∣dour, our severe judgments. Gentleness corrects what∣ever is offensive in our manners; and, by a constant train of humane attentions, studies to alleviate the burden of common misery. Its office, therefore, is
<PB N="118" REF="035851_0155_1007941B64387600"/>
extensive. It is not, like some other virtues, called forth only on peculiar emergencies; but it is conti∣nually in action, when we are engaged in intercourse with men. It ought to form our address, to regulate our speech, and to diffuse itself over our whole beha∣viour.</P>
<P>We must not, however, confound this gentle "wis∣dom which is from above," with that artificial courtesy, that studied smoothness of manners, which is learned in the school of the world. Such accomplishments, the most frivolous and empty may possess. Too often they are employed by the artful, as a snare; too often affected by the hard and unfeeling, as a cover to the baseness of their minds. We cannot, at the same time, avoid observing the homage, which, even in such in∣stances, the world is constrained to pay to virtue. In order to render society agreeable, it is found ne∣cessary to assume somewhat, that may at least carry its appearance. Virtue is the universal charm. Even its shadow is courted, when the substance is wanting. The imitation of its form has been reduced into an art; and in the commerce of life, the first study of all who would either gain the esteem, or win the hearts of others, is to learn the speech, and to adopt the man∣ners, of candour, gentleness, and humanity. But that gentleness which is the characteristic of a good man, has, like every other virtue, its seat in the heart: and let me add, nothing except what flows from the heart, can render even external manners truly pleasing. For no assumed behaviour can at all times hide the real character. In that unaffected civility which springs from a gentle mind, there is a charm infinitely more powerful, than in all the studied manners of the most finished courtier.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="035851_0156_1007941E4CABDDB0"/>
True gentleness is founded on a sense of what we owe to HIM who made us, and to the common nature of which we all share. It arises from reflection on our own failings and wants; and from just views of the condition, and the duty of man. It is native feeling, heightened and improved by principle. It is the heart which easily relents; which feels for every thing that is human; and is backward and slow to inflict the least wound. It is affable in its address, and mild in its demeanour; ever ready to oblige, and willing to be obliged by others; breathing habitual kindness towards friends, courtesy to strangers, long-suffering to enemies. It exercises authority with moderation; administers re∣proof with tenderness; confers favours with ease and modesty. It is unassuming in opinion, and temperate in zeal. It contends not eagerly about trifles; slow to contradict, and still slower to blame; but prompt to allay dissention, and to restore peace. It neither in∣termeddles unnecessarily with the affairs, nor pries in∣quisitively into the secrets of others. It delights above all things to alleviate distress; and, if it cannot dry up the falling tear, to sooth at least the grieving heart. Where it has not the power of being useful, it is ne∣ver burdensome. It seeks to please, rather than to shine and dazzle; and conceals with care, that superi∣ority, either of talents, or of rank, which is oppressive to those who are beneath it. In a word, it is that spi∣rit and that tenour of manners, which the gospel of Christ enjoins, when it commands us "to bear one another's burdens; to rejoice with those who rejoice, and to weep with those who weep; to please every one his neighbour for his good; to be kind and tender∣hearted; to be pitiful and courteous; to support the weak, and to be patient towards all men."</P>

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Trial and Execution of the Earl of Strafford, who fell a Sacrifice to the Violence of the Times, in the Reign of Charles the First.</HEAD>
<P>THE Earl of Strafford defended himself against the accusations of the house of Commons, with all the pre∣sence of mind, judgment, and sagacity, that could be expected from innocence and ability. His children were placed beside him, as he was thus defending his life, and the cause of his royal master. After he had, in a long and eloquent speech, delivered without pre∣meditation, confuted all the accusations of his enemies, he thus drew to a conclusion. "But, my Lords, I have troubled you too long: longer than I should have done, but for the sake of these dear pledges, which a saint in heaven has left me."—Upon this he paused; dropped a tear; looked upon his children; and pro∣ceeded.—"What I forfeit for myself is a trifle: that my indiscretions should reach my posterity, wounds me to the heart. Pardon my infirmity.—Something I should have added, but I am not able; and therefore I let it pass. And now, my Lords, for myself. I have long been taught, that the afflictions of this life are overpaid by that eternal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent. And so, my Lords, even so, with the
<PB N="121" REF="035851_0158_100794241AD21E90"/>
utmost tranquillity, I submit myself to your judgment, whether that judgment be life or death: not my will, but thine, O God, be done!"</P>
<P>His eloquence and innocence induced those judges to pity, who were the most zealous to condemn him. The King himself went to the House of Lords, and spoke for some time in his defence; but the spirit of vengeance, which had been chained for eleven years, was now roused; and nothing but his blood could give the people satisfaction. He was condemned by both Houses of Parliament; and nothing remained but for the King to give his consent to the bill of attainder. But in the present commotions, the consent of the King would very easily be dispensed with; and immi∣nent danger might attend his refusal. Charles, how∣ever, who loved Strafford tenderly, hesitated, and seemed reluctant; trying every expedient to put off so dreadful an office, as that of signing the warrant for his execution. While he continued in this agitation of mind, and state of suspense, his doubts were at last silenced by an act of great magnanimity in the con∣demned Lord. He received a letter from that unfor∣tunate nobleman, desiring that his life might be made a sacrifice to obtain reconciliation between the King and his people: adding, that he was prepared to die; and that to a willing mind there could be no injury. This instance of noble generosity was but ill repaid by his master, who complied with his request. He con∣sented to sign the fatal bill by commission; and Straf∣ford was beheaded on Tower-Hill; behaving with all that composed dignity of resolution, which was ex∣pected from his character.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. An eminent Instance of true Fortitude of Mind.</HEAD>
<P>ALL who have been distinguished as servants of God, or benefactors of men; all who, in perilous situ∣ations, have acted their part with such honour as to render their names illustrious through succeeding ages, have been eminent for fortitude of mind. Of this we have one conspicuous example in the Apostle Paul, whom it will be instructive for us to view in a remarkable occurrence of his life. After having long acted as the apostle of the Gentiles, his mission called him to go to Jerusalem, where he knew that he was to encounter the utmost violence of his enemies. Just before he set sail, he called together the elders of his favourite church at Ephesus; and, in a pathetic speech, which does great honour to his character, gave them his last farewell. Deeply affected by their knowledge of the certain dangers to which he was exposing him∣self, all the assembly were filled with distress, and melted into tears. The circumstances were such, as might have conveyed dejection even into a resolute mind; and would have totally overwhelmed the feeble. "They all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him; sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more."—What were then the sentiments, what was the lan∣guage, of this great and good man? Hear the words which spoke his firm and undaunted mind. "Behold, I go bound in the spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befal me there; save that the
<PB N="123" REF="035851_0160_1007942A33D5A740"/>
Holy Spirit witnesseth in every city, saying, that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me; neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the mi∣nistry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God." There was uttered the voice, there breathed the spirit, of a brave and a virtuous man. Such a man knows not what it is to shrink from danger, when conscience points out his path. In that path he is determined to walk; let the consequences be what they may.</P>
<P>This was the magnanimous behaviour of that great Apostle, when he had persecution and distress full in view. Attend now to the sentiments of the same ex∣cellent man, when the time of his last suffering ap∣proached; and remark the majesty, and the ease, with which he looked on death. "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness." How many years of life does such a dying moment overbalance? Who would not choose, in this manner, to go off the stage, with such a song of triumph in his mouth, rather than prolong his existence through a wretched old age, stained with sin and shame?</P>

<PB N="124" REF="035851_0161_1007942BC64E0F38"/>
to fall upon us with their heaviest pressure, it lightens the load by many consolations to which others are strangers. While bad men trace, in the calamities with which they are visited, the hand of an offended sovereign, Christians are taught to view them as the well-intended chastisements of a merciful Father. They hear amidst them, that still voice which a good conscience brings to their ear: "Fear not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God." They apply to themselves the comfortable promises with which the gospel abounds. They discover in these the happy issue decreed to their troubles; and wait with patience till Providence shall have ac∣complished its great and good designs. the mean time, Devotion opens to them its blessed and holy sanctuary: That sanctuary in which the wounded heart is healed, and the weary mind is at rest; where the cares of the world are forgotten, where its tumults are hushed, and its miseries disappear; where greater objects open to our view than any which the world presents; where a more serene sky shines, and a sweeter and calmer light beams on the afflicted heart. In those moments of devotion, a pious man, pouring out his wants and sorrows to an almighty Supporter, feels that he is not left solitary and forsaken in a vale of woe. God is with him; Christ and the Holy Spirit are with him; and, though he should be be∣reaved of every friend on earth, he can look up in heaven to a Friend that will never desert him.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The Close of Life.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we contemplate the close of life; the termi∣nation of man's designs and hopes; the silence that now reigns among those who, a little while ago, were so busy, or so gay; who can avoid being touched with sensations at once awful and tender? What heart but then warms with the glow of humanity? In whose eye does not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of passing and short-lived man?</P>
<P>Behold the poor man who lays down at last the burden of his wearisome life. No more shall he groan under the load of poverty and toil. No more shall he hear the insolent calls of the master, from whom he received his scanty wages. No more shall he be raised from needful slumber on his bed of straw, nor be hurried away from his homely meal, to undergo the repeated labours of the day. While his humble grave is preparing, and a few poor and decayed neighbours are carrying him thither, it is good for us to think, that this man too was our brother; that for him the aged and destitute wife, and the needy child∣ren, now weep; that, neglected as he was by the world, he possessed perhaps both a sound understand∣ing, and a worthy heart; and is now carried by angels to rest in Abraham's bosom.—At no great distance from him, the grave is opened to receive the rich and proud man. For, as it is said with emphasis in the parable, "the rich man also died, and was buried." He also died. His riches prevented not his sharing
<PB N="126" REF="035851_0163_10079432E7C65F80"/>
the same fate with the poor man; perhaps, through luxury, they accelerated his doom. Then, indeed, "the mourners go about the streets;" and while, in all the pomp and magnificence of woe, his funeral is prepared, his heirs, impatient to examine his will, are looking on one another with jealous eyes, and already beginning to dispute about the division of his substance.—One day, we see carried along the coffin of the smiling infant; the flower just nipped as it began to blossom in the parent's view: and the next day, we behold the young man, or young woman, of blooming form and promising hopes, laid in an un∣timely grave. While the funeral is attended by a numerous unconcerned company, who are discoursing to one another about the news of the day, or the ordi∣nary affairs of life, let our thoughts rather follow to the house of mourning, and represent to themselves what is passing there. There, we should see a dis∣consolate family, sitting in silent grief, thinking of the sad breach that is made in their little society; and, with tears in their eyes, looking to the chamber that is now left vacant, and to every memorial that pre∣sents itself of their departed friend. By such attention to the woes of others, the selfish hardness of our hearts will be gradually softened, and melted down into hu∣manity.</P>
<P>Another day, we follow to the grave, one who, in old age, and after a long career of life, has in full maturity sunk at last into rest. As we are going along to the mansion of the dead, it is natural for us to think, and to discourse, of all the changes which such a per∣son has seen during the course of his life. He has passed, it is likely, through varieties of fortune. He
<PB N="127" REF="035851_0164_10079435B7B5D358"/>
has experienced prosperity, and adversity. He has seen families and kindreds rise and fall. He has seen peace and war succeeding in their turns; the face of his country undergoing many alterations; and the very city in which he dwelt rising, in a manner, new around him. After all he has beheld, his eyes are now closed for ever. He was becoming a stranger in the midst of a new succession of men. A race who knew him not, had arisen to fill the earth. Thus passes the world away. Throughout all ranks and conditions, "one generation passeth, and another ge∣neration cometh;" and this great inn is by turns eva∣cuated, and replenished, by troops of succeeding pil∣grims.—O vain and inconstant world! O fleeting and transient life! When will the sons of men learn to think of thee as they ought! When will they learn humanity from the afflictions of their brethren; or moderation and wisdom from the sense of their own fugitive state.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Exalted Society, and the Renewal of virtuous Connexions, two sources of future Felicity.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES the felicity which springs from perfect love, there are two circumstances which particularly enhance the blessedness of that "multitude who stand before the throne;" these are, access to the most ex∣alted society, and renewal of the most tender con∣nexions. The former is pointed out in the Scripture, by "joining the innumerable company of angels, and the general assembly and church of the first-born; by

fitting down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;" a promise which opens the sublimest prospects to the human mind. It allows good men to entertain the hope, that separated from all the dregs of the human mass, from that mixed and polluted crowd in the midst of which they now dwell, they shall be permitted to mingle with prophets, patriarchs, and apostles, with all those great and illustrious spirits, who have shone in former ages as the servants of God, or the benefactors of men; whose deeds we are accus∣tomed to celebrate; whose steps we now follow at a distance; and whose names we pronounce with vene∣ration.</P>
<P>United to this high assembly, the blessed, at the same time, renew those ancient connexions with virtuous friends which had been dissolved by death. The pro∣spect of this awakens in the heart, the most pleasing and tender sentiment that perhaps can fill it, in this mortal state. For of all the sorrows which we are here doomed to endure, none is so bitter as that oc∣casioned by the fatal stroke which separates us, in ap∣pearance for ever, from those to whom either nature or friendship had intimately joined our hearts. Me∣mory, from time to time, renews the anguish; opens the wound which seemed once to have been closed; and, by recalling joys that are past and gone, touches every spring of painful sensibility. In these agonizing moments, how relieving the thought, that the separa∣tion is only temporary, not eternal; that there is a time to come of re-union with those with whom our happiest days were spent; whose joys and sorrows once were ours; whose piety and virtue cheered and encouraged us; and from whom, after we shall have

<HEAD>SECTION VI. The Clemency and amiable Character of the Patriarch Joseph.</HEAD>
<P>No human character exhibited in the records of Scripture, is more remarkable or instructive than that of the patriarch Joseph. He is one whom we behold tried in all the vicissitudes of fortune; from the condi∣tion of a slave, rising to be ruler of the land of Egypt; and in every station acquiring, by his virtue and wis∣dom, favour with God and man. When overseer of Potiphar's house, his fidelity was proved by strong temptations, which he honourably resisted. When thrown into prison by the artifice of a false woman, his integrity and prudence soon rendered him conspicu∣ous, even in that dark mansion. When called into the presence of Pharaoh, the wise and extensive plan which he formed for saving the kingdom from the miseries of impending famine, justly raised him to a high station, wherein his abilities were eminently displayed in the public service. But in his whole history, there is no circumstance so striking and interesting, as his beha∣viour to his brethren who had sold him into slavery. The moment in which he made himself known to them, was the most critical one of his life, and the most decisive of his character. It is such as rarely oc∣curs in the course of human events; and is calculated
<PB N="130" REF="035851_0167_1007943E5E3CE7E0"/>
to draw the highest attention of all who are endowed with any degree of sensibility of heart.</P>
<P>From the whole tenour of the narration it appears, that though Joseph, upon the arrival of his brethren in Egypt, made himself strange to them, yet from the be∣ginning he intended to discover himself; and studied so to conduct the discovery, as might render the surprise of joy complete. For this end, by affected severity, he took measures for bringing down into Egypt all his father's children. They were now arrived there; and Benja∣min among the rest, who was his younger brother by the same mother, and was particularly beloved by Joseph. Him he threatened to detain; and seemed willing to allow the rest to depart. This incident re∣newed their distress. They all knew their father's ex∣treme anxiety about the safety of Benjamin, and with what difficulty he had yielded to his undertaking this journey. Should he be prevented from returning, they dreaded that grief would overpower the old man's spirits, and prove fatal to his life. Judah, therefore, who had particularly urged the necessity of Benjamin's accompanying his brothers, and had solemnly pledged himself to their father for his safe return, craved, upon this occasion, an audience of the governour; and gave him a full account of the circumstances of Jacob's fa∣mily.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more interesting and pathetic than this discourse of Judah. Little knowing to whom he spoke, he paints in all the colours of simple and natural eloquence, the distressed situation of the aged patri∣arch, hastening to the close of life; long afflicted for the loss of a favourite son, whom he supposed to have been turn in pieces by a beast of prey; labouring now

under anxious concern about his youngest son, the child of his old age, who alone was left alive of his mother, and whom nothing but the calamities of se∣vere famine could have moved a tender father to send from home, and expose to the dangers of a foreign land. "If we bring him not back with us, we shall bring down the grey hairs of thy servant, our father, with sorrow to the grave. I pray thee therefore let thy servant abide, instead of the young man, a bond∣man to our lord. For how shall I go up to my fa∣ther, and Benjamin not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father."</P>
<P>Upon this relation, Joseph could no longer restrain himself. The tender ideas of his father and his father's house, of his ancient home, his country and his kin∣dred, of the distress of his family, and his own exalta∣tion, all rushed too strongly upon his mind to bear any farther concealment. "He cried, cause every man to go out from me; and he wept aloud." The tears which he shed were not the tears of grief. They were the burst of affection. They were the effusions of a heart overflowing with all the tender sensibilities of nature. Formerly he had been moved in the same manner, when he first saw his brethren before him. "His bowels yearned upon them; he sought for a place where to weep. He went into his chamber; and then washed his face and returned to them." At that period his generous plans were not completed. But now, when there was no farther occasion for con∣straining himself, he gave free vent to the strong emo∣tions of his heart. The first minister to the king of Egypt was not ashamed to show, that he felt as a man,
<PB N="132" REF="035851_0169_10079442D6A3DE30"/>
and a brother. "He wept aloud; and the Egyptians, and the house of Pharaoh heard him."</P>
<P>The first words which his swelling heart allowed him to pronounce, are the most suitable to such an af∣fecting situation that were ever uttered;—"I am Joseph; doth my father yet live?—What could he, what ought he, in that impassioned moment, to have said more? This is the voice of Nature herself, speak∣ing her own language; and it penetrates the heart: No pomp of expression; no parade of kindness; but strong affection hastening to utter what it strongly felt. "His brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence." Their silence is as expres∣sive of those emotions of repentance and shame, which, on this amazing discovery, filled their breasts, and stop∣ped their utterance, as the few words which Joseph speaks, are expressive of the generous agitations which struggled for vent within him. No painter could seize a more striking moment for displaying the character∣istical features of the human heart, than what is here presented. Never was there a situation of more ten∣der and virtuous joy, on the one hand; nor, on the other, of more overwhelming confusion and conscious guilt. In the simple narration of the sacred historian, it is set before us with greater energy and higher ef∣fect, than if it had been wrought up with all the co∣louring of the most admired modern eloquence.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. ALTAMONT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The following account of an affecting, mournful exit, is related by Dr. Toung, who was present at the melancholy scene.</HEAD>
<P>THE sad evening before the death of that noble youth, whose last hours suggested these thoughts, I was with him. No one was there, but his physician, and an intimate whom he loved, and whom he had ruined. At my coming in, he said,—"You and the physician are come too late.—I have neither life nor hope. You both aim at miracles. You would raise the dead!"</P>
<P>Heaven, I said, was merciful—"Or," exclaimed he,—"I could not have been thus guilty. What has it not done to bless, and to save me?—I have been too strong for Omnipotence! I have plucked down ruin."—I said, the blessed Redeemer,—"Hold! hold! you wound me!—That is the rock on which I split—I denied his name!"</P>
<P>Refusing to hear any thing from me, or take any thing from the physician, he lay silent, as far as sud∣den darts of pain would permit, till the clock struck: Then with vehemence;—"Oh! time! time! it is fit thou shouldst thus strike thy murderer to the heart!—How art thou fled for ever!—A month!—Oh, for a single week! I ask not for years; though an age were too little for the much I have to do."</P>
<P>On my saying, we could not do too much: that heaven was a blessed place—</P>
<P>"So much the worse.—'Tis lost! 'tis lost!—Heaven is to me the severest part of hell!"</P>
<P>Soon after I proposed prayer. "Pray you that can. I never prayed. I cannot pray:—Nor need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="134" REF="035851_0171_10079446E023F378"/>
not heaven on my side already? It closes with my conscience. Its severest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but second my own."</P>
<P>His friend being much touched, even to tears at this—(who could forbear? I could not)—with a most affectionate look, he said, "Keep those tears for thy∣self. I have undone thee.—Dost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep for me? that's cruel. What can pain me more?"</P>
<P>Here his friend, too much affected, would have left him.—"No, stay—thou still mayst hope;—there∣fore hear me. How madly have I talk'd! How madly hast thou listened, and believed! but look on my pre∣sent state, as a full answer to thee, and to myself. This body is all weakness and pain; but my soul, as if stung up by torment to greater strength and spirit, is full powerful to reason; full mighty to suffer. And that, which thus triumphs within the jaws of immor∣tality, is, doubtless, immortal—And as for a Deity, nothing less than an Almighty could inflict what I feel."</P>
<P>I was about to congratulate this passive, involuntary confessor, on his asserting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature, when he thus, very passionately:—"No, no! let me speak on. I have not long to speak.—My much injured friend! my soul, as my body, lies in ruins; in scattered frag∣ments of broken thought—Remorse for the past, throws my thought on the future. Worse dread of the future, strikes it back on the past. I turn, and turn, and find no ray. Didst thou feel half the moun∣tain that is on me, thou wouldst struggle with the martyr for his stake; and bless Heaven for the flames!—that is not an everlasting flame; that is not an un∣quenchable fire."</P>
<P>How were we struck! yet, soon after, still more. With what an eye of distraction, what a face of de∣spire!
<PB N="135" REF="035851_0172_10079449A91AA4E0"/>
he cried out:—"My principles have poisoned my friend; my extravagance has beggared my boy! my unkindness has murdered my wife!—And is there another hell?—Oh! thou blasphemed, yet indulgent LORD GOD! Hell itself is a refuge, if it hide me from thy frown!"</P>
<P>Soon after his understanding failed. His terrified imagination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or ever forgotten. And ere the sun (which, I hope, has seen few like him) arose, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, accomplished, and most wretched Altamont expired!</P>
<P>If this is a man of pleasure, what is a man of pain? How quick, how total, is their transit! In what a dismal gloom they set for ever! How short, alas! the day of their rejoicing!—For a moment they glitter—they dazzle. In a moment, where are they? Ob∣livion covers their memories. Ah! would it did! In∣famy snatches them from oblivion. In the long-living annals of infamy their triumphs are recorded. Thy sufferings still bleed in the bosom, poor Altamont! of the heart-stricken friend—for Altamont had a friend. He might have had many. His transient morning might have been the dawn of an immortal day. His name might have been gloriously enrolled in the re∣cords of eternity. His memory might have left a sweet fragrance behind it, grateful to the surviving friend, salutary to the succeeding generation. With <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> capacities was he endowed! with what ad∣vantages, for being greatly good! But with the talents of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gel, a man may be a fool. If he judges amiss in the supreme point, judging right in all else, but aggravates his folly; as it shows him wrong, though blessed with the best capacity of being right.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HERACLITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think thou art too little moved by it. Thy mirth and ridicule bespeak the buffoon, rather than the philosopher. Does it not excite thy compassion, to see mankind so frail, so blind, so far departed from the rules of virtue?</P>

<P>And yet, after all, they, who are the objects of thy ridicule, include, not only mankind in general, but the persons with whom thou livest, thy friends, thy family, nay even thyself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEMOCRITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I care very little for all the silly persons I meet with; and think I am justifiable in diverting myself with their folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HERACLITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they are weak and foolish, it marks neither wis∣dom nor humanity, to insult rather than pity them. But is it certain, that thou art not as extravagant as they are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEMOCRITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I presume that I am not; since, in every point, my sentiments are the very reverse of theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HERACLITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are follies of different kinds. By constantly amusing thyself with the errors and misconduct of others, thou mayst render thyself equally ridiculous and culpable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEMOCRITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art at liberty to indulge such sentiments; and to weep over me too, if thou hast any tears to spare. For my part, I cannot refrain from pleasing myself with the levities and ill-conduct of the world about me. Are not all men foolish or irregular in their lives?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="138" REF="035851_0175_10079452978B9A68"/>
<SPEAKER>HERACLITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! there is but too much reason to believe, they are so: and on this ground, I pity and deplore their condition. We agree in this point, that men do not conduct themselves according to reasonable and just principles: but I, who do not suffer myself to act as they do, must yet regard the dictates of my under∣standing and feelings, which compel me to love them; and that love fills me with compassion for their mis∣takes and irregularities. Canst thou condemn me for pitying my own species, my brethren, persons born in the same condition of life, and destined to the same hopes and privileges? If thou shouldst enter a hospi∣tal, where sick and wounded persons reside, would their wounds and distresses excite thy mirth? And yet, the evils of the body bear no comparison with those of the mind. Thou wouldst certainly blush at thy bar∣barity, if thou hadst been so unfeeling, as to laugh at or despise a poor miserable being who had lost one of his legs: and yet thou art so destitute of humanity, as to ridicule those who appear to be deprived of the noble powers of the understanding, by the little regard which they pay to its dictates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DEMOCRITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>He who has lost a leg is to be pitied, because the loss is not to be imputed to himself: but he who re∣jects the dictates of reason and conscience, voluntarily deprives himself of their aid. The loss originates in his own folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HERACLITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! so much the more is he to be pitied! A furious maniac, who should pluck out his own eyes, would de∣serve more compassion than an ordinary blind man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="139" REF="035851_0176_100794558A58BA38"/>
<SPEAKER>DEMOCRITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, let us accommodate the business. There is something to be said on each side of the question. There is every where reason for laughing, and reason for weeping. The world is ridiculous, and I laugh at it: it is deplorable, and thou lamentest over it. Every person views it in his own way, and according to his own temper. One point is unquestionable, that mankind are preposterous: to think right, and to act well, we must think and act differently from them. To submit to the authority, and follow the example of the greater part of men, would render us foolish and miserable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HERACLITUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is, indeed, true; but then, thou hast no real love or feeling for thy species. The calamities of man∣kind excite thy mirth: and this proves that thou hast no regard for men, nor any true respect for the virtues which they have unhappily abandoned.</P>

<P>Yes, it is Pythias. I left the place of my confine∣ment, with no other views, than to pay to Heaven the vows I had made; to settle my family concerns accord∣ing to the rules of justice; and to bid adieu to my children, that I might die tranquil and satisfied.</P>

<P>I return to suffer, though I have not deserved death. Every principle of honour and goodness, forbids me to allow my friend to die for me.</P>

<P>Dost thou, then, love him better than thyself?</P>

<SPEAKER>PYTHIAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I love him as myself. But I am persuaded that I ought to suffer death, rather than my friend; since it was me whom thou hadst decreed to die. It were not just that he should suffer, to deliver me from the death which was designed, not for him, but for me only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Dost thou then return hither, on the day appointed, with no other view, than to save the life of a friend; by losing thy own?</P>

<P>I was but too, well assured, that Pythias would punc∣tually return; and that he would be more solicitous to keep his promise, than to preserve his life.

<P>YES, we both were philosophers; but my philosophy was the deepest. You dogmatized: I doubted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOCKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you make doubting a proof of depth in philo∣sophy? It may be a good beginning of it; but it is a bad end.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAYLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No:—the more profound our searches are into the nature of things, the more uncertainty we shall find; and the most subtle minds see objections and difficul∣ties in every system, which are overlooked or undisco∣verable by ordinary understandings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOCKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be better than to be no philosopher, and to continue in the vulgar herd of mankind, that one may have the convenience of thinking that one knows something. I find that the eyes which nature has given me, see many things very clearly, though some are out of their reach, or discerned but dimly. What opinion ought I to have of a physician, who should offer me an eye-water, the use of which would at first so sharpen my sight, as to carry it farther than ordinary
<PB N="145" REF="035851_0182_10079465310D05A8"/>
vision; but would in the end put them out? Your philosophy is to the eyes of the mind, what I have sup∣posed the doctor's nostrum to be to those of the body. It actually brought your own excellent understanding, which was by nature quick-sighted, and rendered more so by art and a subtilty of logick peculiar to yourself—it brought, I say, your very acute understanding to see nothing clearly; and enveloped all the great truths of reason and religion in mists of doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAYLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it did;—but your comparison is not just. I did not see well, before I used my philosophic eye-water: I only supposed I saw well; but I was in an error, with all the rest of mankind. The blindness was real, the perceptions were imaginary. I cured myself first of those false imaginations, and then I laudably endeavoured to cure other men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOCKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great cure indeed! and don't you think that, in return for the service you did them, they ought to erect you a statue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAYLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; it is good for human nature to know its own weakness. When we arrogantly presume on a strength we have not, we are always in great danger of hurting ourselves, or at least of deserving ridicule and con∣tempt, by vain and idle efforts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOCKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you, that human nature should know its own weakness; but it should also feel its strength, and try to improve it. This was my employment as a philosopher. I endeavoured to discover the real pow∣ers of the mind, to see what it could do, and what it
<PB N="146" REF="035851_0183_100794681FF72E88"/>
could not; to restrain it from efforts beyond its ability; but to teach it how to advance as far as the faculties given to it by nature, with the utmost exertion and most proper culture of them, would allow it to go. In the vast ocean of philosophy, I had the line and the plummet always in my hands. Many of its depths I found myself unable to fathom; but, by caution in sounding, and the careful observations I made in the course of my voyage, I found out some truths of so much use to mankind, that they acknowledge me to have been their benefactor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAYLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their ignorance makes them think so. Some other philosopher will come hereafter, and shew those truths to be falsehoods. He will pretend to discover other truths of equal importance. A later sage, will arise, perhaps among men now barbarous and unlearned, whose sagacious discoveries will discredit the opinions of his admired predecessor. In philosophy, as in na∣ture, all changes its form, and one thing exists by the destruction of another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOCKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Opinions taken up without a patient investigation, depending on terms not accurately defined, and prin∣ciples begged without proof, like theories to explain the phaenomena of nature, built on suppositions instead of experiments, must perpetually change and destroy one another. But some opinions there are, even in matters not obvious to the common sense of mankind, which the mind has received on such rational grounds of assent, that they are as immoveable as the pillars of heaven; or (to speak philosophically) as the great laws of Nature, by which, under God, the universe is sus∣tained
<PB N="147" REF="035851_0184_1007946C98CA40A0"/>
Can you seriously think, that, because the hy∣pothesis of your countryman Descartes, which was no∣thing but an ingenious, well-imagined romance, has been lately exploded, the system of Newton, which is built on experiments and geometry, the two most cer∣tain methods of discovering truth, will ever fail; or that, because the whims of fanatics and the divinity of the schoolmen, cannot now be supported, the doc∣trines of that religion, which I, the declared enemy of all enthusiasm and false reasoning, firmly believed and maintained, will ever be shaken?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BAYLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had asked Descartes, while he was in the height of his vogue, whether his system would ever be confuted by any other philosophers, as that of Aristotle had been by his, what answer do you suppose he would have returned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOCKE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, you yourself know the difference be∣tween the foundations on which the credit of those systems, and that of Newton is placed. Your scepti∣cism is more affected than real. You found it a shorter way to a great reputation, (the only wish of your heart,) to object, than to defend; to pull down than to set up. And your talents were admirable for that kind of work. Then your huddling together in a Critical Dictionary, a pleasant tale, or obscene jest, and a grave argument against the Christian religion, a witty confutation of some absurd author, and an artful sophism to impeach some respectable truth, was particularly commodious to all our young smarts and smatterers in free-thinking. But what mischief have you not done to human society? You have endeavoured, and with some degree of suc∣cess,
<PB N="148" REF="035851_0185_1007946F7364CCA0"/>
to shake those foundations, on which the whole moral world, and the great fabric of social happiness, entirely rest. How could you, as a philosopher, in the sober hours of reflection, answer for this to your con∣science, even supposing you had doubts of the truth of a system, which gives to virtue its sweetest hopes, to impenitent vice its greatest fears, and to true peni∣tence its best consolations; which restrains even the least approaches to guilt, and yet makes those allow∣ances for the infirmities of our nature, which the Stoic pride denied to it, but which its real imperfection, and the goodness of its infinitely benevolent Creator, so evidently require?</P>

I have also heard that your character was irreproachably good. But, when, in the most laboured parts of your writings, you sap the surest foundations of all moral duties; what avails it that in others, or in the conduct of your life, you appeared to respect them? How many, who have stronger passions than you had, and are desirous to get rid of the curb that restrains them, will lay hold of your scepticism, to set themselves loose from all obligations of virtue! What a misfortune is it to have made such a use of such talents! It would have been better for you and for mankind, if you had been one of the dullest of Dutch theologians, or the most credulous monk in a Portuguese convent.

of superstition? Consider how much mischief these have done to the world!

This, in∣deed, is the great art of the most celebrated free∣thinkers. They recommend themselves to warm and ingenuous minds, by lively strokes of wit, and by ar∣guments really strong, against superstition, enthusiasm, and priestcraft. But, at the same time, they insi∣diously throw the colours of these upon the fair face of true Religion; and dress her out in their garb, with a malignant intention to render her odious or despicable, to those who have not penetration enough to discern the impious fraud. Some of them may have thus deceived themselves, as well as others. Yet it is certain, no book, that ever was written by the most acute of these gentlemen, is so repugnant to priestcraft, to spiritual tyranny, to all absurd superstitions, to all that can tend

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. PUBLIC SPEECHES.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Cicero against Verres.</HEAD>
<P>THE time is come, Fathers, when that which has long been wished for, towards allaying the envy your order has been subject to, and removing the impu∣tations against trials, is effectually put in our power. An opinion has long prevailed, not only here at home, but likewise in foreign countries, both dangerous to you, and pernicious to the state,—that, in prosecutions, men of wealth are always safe, however clearly con∣victed. There is now to be brought upon his trial before you, to the confusion, I hope, of the propa∣gators of this slanderous imputation, one whose life and actions condemn him in the opinion of all impar∣tial persons; but who, according to his own reckon∣ing and declared dependence upon his riches, is al∣ready acquitted; I mean Caius Verres. I demand justice of you, Fathers, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the public treasury, the oppressor of Asia Minor and Pamphylia, the invader of the rights and privileges of Romans, the scourge and curse of Sicily. If that sentence is passed upon him which his crimes deserve, your authority, Fathers, will be venerable and sacred in
<PB N="154" REF="035851_0191_1007AB476BD0F6F8"/>
the eyes of the public; but if his great riches should bias you in his favour, I shall still gain one point,—to make it apparent to all the world, that what was want∣ing in this case, was not a criminal nor a prosecutor, but justice and adequate punishment.</P>
<P>To pass over the shameful irregularities of his youth, what does his quaestorship, the first public employment he held, what does it exhibit, but one continued scene of villanies? Cneius Carbo plundered of the public money by his own treasurer, a consul stripped and be∣trayed, and army deserted and reduced to want, a pro∣vince robbed, the civil and religious rights of a people violated. The employment he held in Asia Minor and Pamphylia, what did it produce but the ruin of those countries? in which, houses, cities, and temples were robbed by him. What was his conduct in his praetor∣ship here at home? Let the plundered temples, and public works neglected, that he might embezzle the money intended for carrying them on, bear witness. How did he discharge the office of a judge? Let those who suffered by his injustice answer. But his praetor∣ship in Sicily crowns all his works of wickedness, and finishes a lasting monument to his infamy. The mis∣chiefs done by him in that unhappy country, during the three years of his iniquitous administration, are such, that many years, under the wisest and best of praetors, will not be sufficient to restore things to the condition in which he found them: for it is noto∣rious, that, during the time of his tyranny, the Si∣cilians neither enjoyed the protection of their own original laws; of the regulations made for their benefit by the Roman senate, upon their coming under the pro∣tection of the commonwealth; nor of the natural and
<PB N="155" REF="035851_0192_1007AB48F4BBC950"/>
unalienable rights of men. His nod has decided all causes in Sicily for these three years. And his de∣cisions have broken all law, all precedent, all right. The sums he has, by arbitrary taxes and unheard of impositions, extorted from the industrious poor, are not to be computed. The most faithful allies of the commonwealth have been treated as enemies. Roman citizens have, like slaves, been put to death with tor∣tures. The most atrocious criminals, for money, have been exempted from the deserved punishments; and men of the most unexceptionable characters, con∣demned and banished unheard. The harbours, though sufficiently fortified, and the gates of strong towns, have been opened to pirates and ravagers. The soldiery and sailors, belonging to a province under the pro∣tection of the commonwealth, have been starved to death. Whole fleets, to the great detriment of the province, suffered to perish. The ancient monuments of either Sicilian or Roman greatness, the statues of heroes and princes have been carried off; and the temples stripped of the images.—Having, by his ini∣quitous sentences, filled the prisons with the most in∣dustrious and deserving of the people, he then pro∣ceeded to order numbers of Roman citizens to be strangled in the gaols: so that the exclamation, "I am a citizen of Rome!" which has often, in the most distant regions, and among the most barbarous people, been a protection, was of no service to them; but, on the contrary, brought a speedier and more severe pu∣nishment upon them.</P>
<P>I ask now, Verres, what thou hast to advance against this charge? Wilt thou pretend to deny it? Wilt thou pretend, that any thing false, that even any thing
<PB N="156" REF="035851_0193_1007AB4B553CEB90"/>
aggravated, is alleged against thee? Had any prince, or any state, committed the same outrage against the privilege of Roman citizens, should we not think we had sufficient ground for demanding satisfaction? What punishment ought, then, to be inflicted upon a tyran∣nical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater distance than Sicily, within sight of the Italian coast, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion, that unfor∣tunate and innocent citizen, Publius Gavius Cosanus, only for his having asserted his privilege of citizen∣ship, and declared his intention of appealing to the justice of his country, against a cruel oppressor, who had unjustly confined him in prison at Syracuse, whence he had just made his escape? The unhappy man, arrested as he was going to embark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a countenance distorted with cruelty, he orders the helpless victim of his rage to be stripped, and rods to be brought; accusing him, but without the least shadow of evidence, or even of sus∣picion, of having come to Sicily, as a spy. It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Ro∣man citizen: I have served under Lucius Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tius, who is now at Panormus, and will attest my inno∣cence." The blood-thirsty praetor, deaf to all he could urge in his own defence, ordered the infamous punish∣ment to be inflicted. Thus, Fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen publicly mangled with scourging; whilst the only words he uttered, amidst his cruel suf∣ferings, were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With these he hoped to defend himself from violence and infamy. But of so little service was this privilege to him, that, while he was thus asserting his citizenship, the order
<PB N="157" REF="035851_0194_100792301B703738"/>
was given for his execution,—for his execution upon the cross!—</P>
<P>O liberty!—O sound once delightful to every Ro∣man ear!—O sacred privilege of Roman citizenship!—once sacred!—now trampled upon!—But what then? Is it come to this? Shall an inferior magistrate, a go∣vernour, who holds his whole power of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within sight of Italy, bind, scourge, torture with fire and red hot plates of iron, and at last put to the infamous death of the cross, a Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries of innocence expiring in agony, nor the tears of pitying spectators, nor the majesty of the Roman commonwealth, nor the fear of the justice of his country, restrain the licentious and wanton cruelty of a monster, who, in confidence of his riches, strikes at the root of liberty, and sets mankind at defiance?</P>
<P>I conclude with expressing my hopes, that your wisdom and justice, Fathers, will not, by suffering the atrocious and unexampled insolence of Caius Verres to escape due punishment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total subversion of authority, and the in∣troduction of general anarchy and confusion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Speech of Adherbal to the Roman Senate, imploring their protection against Jugurtha.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FATHERS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is known to you, that king Micipsa, my father, on his death-bed, left in charge to Jugurtha, his adopted son, conjunctly with my unfortunate brother Hiempsal
<PB N="158" REF="035851_0195_1007AB5110DC2980"/>
and myself, the children of his own body, the admini∣stration of the kingdom of Numidia, directing us to consider the senate and people of Rome as proprietors of it. He charged us to use our best endeavours to be serviceable to the Roman commonwealth; assuring us, that your protection would prove a defence against all enemies; and would be instead of armies, fortifications, and treasures.</P>
<P>While my brother and I were thinking of nothing but how to regulate ourselves according to the direc∣tions of our deceased father—Jugurtha—the most in∣famous of mankind!—breaking through all ties of gra∣titude and of common humanity, and trampling on the authority of the Roman commonwealth, procured the murder of my unfortunate brother; and has driven me from my throne and native country, though he knows I inherit, from my grandfather Massinissa, and my father Micipsa, the friendship and alliance of the Romans.</P>
<P>For a prince to be reduced, by villany, to my dis∣tressful circumstances, is calamity enough; but my misfortunes are heightened by the consideration—that I find myself obliged to solicit your assistance, Fathers, for the services done you by my ancestors, not for any I have been able to render you in my own person. Jugurtha has put it out of my power to deserve any thing at your hands; and has forced me to be burden∣some, before I could be useful to you. And yet, if I had no plea, but my undeserved misery—a once pow∣erful prince, the descendent of a race of illustrious mo∣narchs, now, without any fault of my own, destitute of every support, and reduced to the necessity of begging foreign assistance, against an enemy who has seized my throne and my kingdom—if my unequalled dis∣tresses
<PB N="159" REF="035851_0196_1007AB52992D1180"/>
were all I had to plead—it would become the greatness of the Roman commonwealth, to protect the injured, and to check the triumph of daring wickedness over helpless innocence. But, to provoke your resent∣ment to the utmost, Jugurtha has driven me from the very dominions, which the senate and people of Rome gave to my ancestors; and, from which, my grandfather, and my father, under your umbrage, expelled Syphax and the Carthaginians. Thus, Fathers, your kindness to our family is defeated; and Jugurtha, in injuring me, throws contempt upon you.</P>
<P>O wretched prince! Oh cruel reverse of fortune! Oh father Micipsa! is this the consequence of thy generosity; that he, whom thy goodness raised to an equality with thy own children, should be the murderer of thy children? Must, then, the royal house of Nu∣midia always be a scene of havoc and blood? While Carthage remained, we suffered, as was to be expected, all sorts of hardships from their hostile attacks; our enemy near; our only powerful ally, the Roman commonwealth, at a distance. When that scourge of Africa was no more, we congratulated ourselves on the prospect of established peace. But, instead of peace, behold the kingdom of Numidia drenched with royal blood! and the only surviving son of its late king, flying from an adopted murderer, and seeking that safety in foreign parts, which he cannot command in his own kingdom.</P>
<P>Whither—Oh! whither shall I fly? If I return to the royal palace of my ancestors, my father's throne is seized by the murderer of my brother. What can I there expect, but that Jugurtha should hasten to imbrue, in my blood, those hands which are now reeking with
<PB N="160" REF="035851_0197_1007AB55952A3680"/>
my brother's? If I were to fly for refuge, or for assistance, to any other court, from what prince can I hope for protection, if the Roman commonwealth give me up? From my own family or friends I have no expectations. My royal father is no more. He is beyond the reach of violence, and out of hearing of the complaints of his unhappy son. Were my brother alive, our mutual sympathy would be some alleviation. But he is hurried out of life, in his early youth, by the very hand which should have been the last to injure any of the royal family of Numidia. The bloody Jugurtha has butchered all whom he suspected to be in my in∣terest. Some have been destroyed by the lingering torment of the cross. Others have been given a prey to wild beasts; and their anguish made the sport of men more cruel than wild beasts. If there be any yet alive, they are shut up in dungeons, there to drag out a life more intolerable than death itself.</P>
<P>Look down, illustrious senators of Rome! from that height of power to which you are raised, on the un∣exampled distresses of a prince, who is, by the cruelty of a wicked intruder, become an outcast from all man∣kind. Let not the crafty insinuations of him who re∣turns murder for adoption, prejudice your judgment. Do not listen to the wretch who has butchered the son and relations of a king, who gave him power to sit on the same throne with his own sons.—I have been in∣formed; that he labours by his emissaries to prevent your determining any thing against him in his absence; pretending that I magnify my distress, and might, for him, have staid in peace in my own kingdom. But if ever the time comes, when the due vengeance from above shall overtake him, he will then dissemble as I do. Then he, who now, hardened in wickedness,
<PB N="161" REF="035851_0198_1007AB57F6BCE4C8"/>
triumphs over those whom his violence has laid low, will, in his turn, feel distress, and suffer for his impious ingratitude to my father, and his blood-thirsty cruelty to my brother.</P>
<P>Oh murdered, butchered brother! Oh dearest to my heart—now gone for ever from my sight!—but why should I lament his death? He is, indeed, deprived of the blessed light of heaven, of life, and kingdom, at once, by the very person who ought to have been the first to hazard his own life, in defence of any one of Micipsa's family. But, as things are, my brother is not so much deprived of these comforts, as delivered from terror, from flight, from exile, and the endless train of miseries which render life to me a burden. He lies full low, gored with wounds, and festering in his own blood. But he lies in peace. He feels none of the miseries which rend my soul with agony and distrac∣tion, while I am set up a spectacle to all mankind, of the uncertainty of human affairs. So far from having it in my power to punish his murderer, I am not mas∣ter of the means of securing my own life. So far from being in a condition to defend my kingdom from the violence of the usurper, I am obliged to apply for fo∣reign protection for my own person.</P>
<P>Fathers!

<HEAD>SECTION III. The Apostle Paul's noble defence before Festus and Agrippa.</HEAD>
<P>AGRIPPA said unto Paul, thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself.</P>
<P>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee, concerning all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews: especially, as I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</P>
<P>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; who knew me from the beginning, (if they would testify,) that after the straitest sect of our re∣ligion, I lived a Pharisee. And now I stand, and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers: to which promise, our twelve tribes con∣tinually serving God day and night, hope to come: and for this hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</P>
<P>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth: and this I did in Jerusalem. Many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I often punished them in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being ex∣ceedingly
<PB N="163" REF="035851_0200_1007ABBD93CAF4A0"/>
mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. But as I went to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief priests, at mid-day, O king! I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them who journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And I said, who art thou, Lord? And he replied, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister, and a witness both of these things, which thou hast seen, and of those things in which I will appear to thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee, to open their eyes; and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive for∣giveness of sins, and inheritance amongst them who are sanctified by faith that is in me.</P>
<P>Whereupon, O king Agrippa! I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision: but showed first to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and through all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for re∣pentance. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these causes, the Jews caught me in the temple; and went about to kill me. Having, however, obtained help from God, I continue, to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses de∣clared should come: that Christ should suffer; that he would be the first who should rise from the dead; and
<PB N="164" REF="035851_0201_1007ABBF1BECF8B8"/>
that he would show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.</P>
<P>And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said, with a loud voice, "Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning hath made thee mad." But he replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak the words of truth and soberness. For the king knoweth these things, before whom also I speak freely. I am per∣suaded that none of these things are hidden from him: for this thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. Then Agrippa said to Paul, "almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." And Paul re∣plied, "I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and alto∣gether such as I am, except these bonds."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How happy was this great Apostle, even in the most perilous cir∣cumstances! Though under bonds and oppression, his mind was free, and raised above every fear of man. With what dignity and composure does he defend himself, and the noble cause he had espoused; whilst he displays the most compassionate and generous feelings, for those who were strangers to the sublime religion by which he was animated!</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Lord Mansfield's Speech in the House of Lords, 1770, on the Bill for preventing the Delays of Justice, by claim∣ing the Privilege of Parliament.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I consider the importance of this bill to your Lordships, I am not surprised it has taken up so much of your consideration. It is a bill, indeed, of no com∣mon magnitude; it is no less than to take away from two thirds of the legislative body of this great king∣dom, certain privileges and immunities of which they have been long possessed. Perhaps there is no situa∣tion the human mind can be placed in, that is so diffi∣cult and so trying, as when it is made a judge in its own cause. There is something implanted in the breast of man so attached to self, so tenacious of privileges once obtained, that, in such a situation, either to dis∣cuss with impartiality, or decide with justice, has ever been held the summit of all human virtue. The bill now in question puts your Lordships in this very pre∣dicament; and I doubt not but the wisdom of your de∣cision will convince the world, that where self-interest and justice are in opposite scales, the latter will ever preponderate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Lordships.</P>
<P>Privileges have been granted to legislators in all ages, and in all countries. The practice is founded in wis∣dom; and indeed, it is peculiarly essential to the con∣stitution of this country, that the members of both Houses should be free in their persons, in cases of civil suits: for there may come a time when the safety and
<PB N="166" REF="035851_0203_1007ABC514989D10"/>
welfare of this whole empire, may depend upon their attendance in parliament. I am far from advising any measure that would in future endanger the state: but the bill before your Lordships has, I am confident, no such tendency; for it expressly secures the persons of members of either House in all civil suits. This being the case, I confess, when I see many noble lords, for whose judgment I have a very great respect, standing up to oppose a bill which is calculated merely to faci∣litate the recovery of just and legal debts, I am asto∣nished and amazed. They, I doubt not, oppose the bill upon public principles: I would not wish to in∣sinuate, that private interest had the least weight in their determination.</P>
<P>The bill has been frequently proposed, and as fre∣quently has miscarried: but it was always lost in the Lower House. Little did I think, when it had passed the Commons, that it possibly could have met with such op∣position here. Shall it be said, that you, my Lords, the grand council of the nation, the highest judicial and le∣gislative body of the realm, endeavour to evade, by privilege, those very laws which you enforce on your fellow-subjects? Forbid it Justice!—I am sure, were the noble Lords as well acquainted as I am, with but half the difficulties and delays occasioned in the courts of justice, under pretence of privilege, they would not, nay they could not, oppose this bill.</P>
<P>I have waited with patience to he what arguments might be urged against the bill; but I have waited in vain: the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh against it. The justice and expediency of the bill are such as render it self-evident. It is a proposition of that nature, that can neither be weak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned by argument,
<PB N="167" REF="035851_0204_1007ABC76ED67698"/>
nor entangled with sophistry. Much, indeed, has been said by some noble lords, on the wisdom of our ances∣tors, and how differently they thought from us. They not only decreed, that privilege should prevent all civil suits from proceeding during the sitting of parliament, but likewise granted protection to the very servants of members. I shall say nothing on the wisdom of our an∣cestors; it might perhaps appear invidious: that is not necessary in the present case. I shall only say, that the noble Lords who flatter themselves with the weight of that reflection, should remember, that as circumstances alter, things themselves should alter. Formerly, it was not so fashionable either for masters or servants to run in debt, as it is at present. Formerly, we were not that great commercial nation we are at present; nor for∣merly were merchants and manufacturers members of parliament, as at present. The case is now very dif∣ferent: both merchants and manufacturers are, with great propriety, elected members of the Lower House. Commerce having thus got into the legislative body of the kingdom, privilege must be done away. We all know, that the very soul and essence of trade are re∣gular payments; and sad experience teaches us, that there are men, who will not make their regular pay∣ments without the compulsive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all. Any exemption to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rticular men, or particular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial country, a solecism of the grossest nature.</P>
<P>But I will not trouble your Lordships with arguments for that, which is sufficiently evident without any. I shall only say a few words to some noble lords, who foresee much inconveniency, from the persons of their
<PB N="168" REF="035851_0205_1007ABC8F7221708"/>
servants being liable to be arrested. One noble lord observes, That the coachman of a peer may be ar∣rested, while he is driving his master to the House, and, that, consequently, he will not be able to attend his duty in parliament. If this were actually to happen, there are so many methods by which the member might still get to the House, that I can hardly think the noble lord is serious in his objection. Another noble peer said, That, by this bill, one might lose his most valuable and honest servants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms! for he can neither be a valuable servant, nor an honest man, who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till compelled by the law. If my servant, by unforeseen accidents, has got into debt, and I still wish to retain him, I certainly would pay the demand. But upon no principal of liberal legisla∣tion whatever, can my servant have a title to set his creditors at defiance, while for forty shillings only, the honest tradesman may be torn from his family, and locked up in a gaol. It is monstrous injustice! I flatter myself, however, the determination of this day will en∣tirely put an end to all such partial proceedings for the future, by passing into a law the bill now under your Lordships' consideration.</P>
<P>I come now to speak, upon what, indeed, I would have gladly avoided, had I not been particularly point∣ed at, for the part I have taken in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill. It has been said, by a noble lord on my left hand, that I likewise am running the race of popularity. If the noble Lord means by popularity, that applause bestowed by after∣ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been struggling in that race: to what purpose, all-trying Time can alone determine. But if the noble lord
<PB N="169" REF="035851_0206_1007ABCB567D9180"/>
means that mushroom popularity, which is raised with∣out merit, and lost without a crime, he is much mistaken in his opinion. I defy the noble Lord to point out a single action of my life, in which the popularity of the times ever had the smallest influence on my determina∣tions. I thank God I have a more permanent and steady rule for my conduct,—the dictates of my own breast. They who have foregone that pleasing adviser, and given up their mind to be the slave of every popu∣lar impulse, I sincerely pity: I pity them still more, if their vanity leads them to mistake the shouts of a mob, for the trumpet of Fame. Experience might inform them, that many, who have been saluted with the huzzas of a crowd one day, have received their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popularity of their times, have been held up as spotless patriots, have, ne∣vertheless, appeared upon the historian's page, when truth has triumphed over delusion, the assassins of li∣berty. Why then the noble lord can think I am am∣bitious of present popularity, that echo of folly, and shadow of renown, I am at a loss to determine. Be∣sides, I do not know that the bill now before your Lord∣ships will be popular: it depends much upon the caprice of the day. It may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that case, the present must be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular nei∣ther to take away any of the privileges of parliament; for I very well remember, and many of your Lordships may remember, that, not long ago, the popular cry was for the extension of privilege; and so far did they carry it at that time, that it was said, the privilege protected members even in criminal actions; nay, such was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="170" REF="035851_0207_1007ABCEE00386B0"/>
very decisions of some of the courts were tinctured with that doctrine. It was u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>doubtedly an abominable doctrine; I thought so then, and I think so still; but, nevertheless, it was a popular doctrine, and came immediately from those who are called the friends of liberty; how deservedly, time will show. True liber∣ty, in my opinion, can only exist when justice equally administered to all; to the king and to the beggar. Where is the justice then, or where is the law that protects a member of parliament more than any other man, from the punishment due to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place, nor any employment, to be a sanctuary for crimes; and where I have the honour to sit as judge, neither royal favour, nor popular applause, shall ever protect the guilty.</P>
<P>I have now only to beg pardon for having employed so much of your Lordships' time; and I am sorry a bill, fraught with so many good consequences, has not met with an abler advocate: but I doubt not your Lordships' determination will convince the world, that a bill, cal∣culated to contribute so much to the equal distribution of justice as the present, requires with your Lordships but very little support.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. An Address to young Persons.</HEAD>
<P>I INTEND, in this address, to show you the import∣ance of beginning early to give serious attention to your conduct. As soon as you are capable of re∣flection, you must perceive that there is a right and a wrong, in human actions. You see, that those who
<PB N="171" REF="035851_0208_1007ABD155B4A018"/>
are born with the same advantages of fortune, are not all equally prosperous in the course of life. While some of them, by wise and steady conduct, attain dis∣tinction in the world, and pass their days with comfort and honour; others, of the same rank, by mean and vicious behaviour, forfeit the advantages of their birth; involve themselves in much misery; and end in being a disgrace to their friends, and a burden on society. Early, then, may you learn, that it is not on the ex∣ternal condition in which you find yourselves placed, but on the part which you are to act, that your welfare or unhappiness, your honour or infamy, depends. Now, when beginning to act that part, what can be of greater moment, than to regulate your plan of con∣duct with the most serious attention, before you have yet committed any fatal or irretrievable errors? If, instead of exerting reflection for this valuable purpose, you deliver yourselves up, at so critical a time, to sloth and pleasure; if you refuse to listen to any counsellor but humour, or to attend to any pursuit except that of amusement; if you allow yourselves to float loose and careless on the tide of life, ready to receive any direc∣tion which the current of fashion may chance to give you; what can you expect to follow from such begin∣nings? While so many around you are undergoing the sad consequences of a like indiscretion, for what reason shall not those consequences extend to you? Shall you attain success without that preparation, and escape dangers without that precaution, which is re∣quired of others? Shall happiness grow up to you, of its own accord, and solicit your acceptance, when, to the rest of mankind, it is the fruit of long cultivation, and the acquisition of labour and care?—Deceive
<PB N="172" REF="035851_0209_1007ABD2DFB49B90"/>
not yourselves with such arrogant hopes. Whatever be your rank, Providence will not, for your sake, reverse its established order. The Author of your being hath enjoined you to "take heed to your ways; to ponder the paths of your feet; to remember your Creator in the days of your youth." He hath decreed, that they only "who seek after wisdom, shall find it; that fools shall be afflicted, because of their transgres∣sions; and that whoever refuseth instruction, shall de∣stroy his own soul." By listening to these admonitions, and tempering the vivacity of youth with a proper mix∣ture of serious thought, you may ensure cheerfulness for the rest of life; but by delivering yourselves up at present to giddiness and levity, you lay the foundation of lasting heaviness of heart.</P>
<P>When you look forward to those plans of life, which either your circumstances have suggested, or your friends have proposed, you will not hesitate to acknow∣ledge, that in order to pursue them with advantage, some previous discipline is requisite. Be assured, that whatever is to be your profession, no education is more necessary to your success, than the acquirement of virtuous dispositions and habits. This is the uni∣versal preparation for every character, and every station in life. Bad as the world is, respect is always paid to virtue. In the usual course of human affairs, it will be found, that a plain understanding, joined with acknowledged worth, contributes more to pro∣sperity, than the brightest parts without probity or honour. Whether science or business, or public life, be your aim, virtue still enter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a principal share, into all those great departments of society. It is con∣nected with eminence, in every liberal art; with re∣putation
<PB N="173" REF="035851_0210_100792484E2D3620"/>
in every branch of fair and useful business; with distinction, in every public station. The vigour which it gives the mind, and the weight which it adds to character; the generous sentiments which it breathes; the undaunted spirit which it inspires; the ardour of diligence which it quickens; the freedom which it pro∣cures from pernicious and dishonourable avocations; are the foundations of all that is highly honourable, or greatly successful among men.</P>
<P>Whatever ornamental or engaging endowments you now possess, virtue is a necessary requisite, in order to their shining with proper lustre. Feeble are the attractions of the fairest form, if it be suspected that nothing within corresponds to the pleasing appearance without. Short are the triumphs of wit, when it is supposed to be the vehicle of malice. By whatever means you may at first attract the attention, you can hold the esteem, and secure the hearts of others, only by amiable dispositions, and the accomplishments of the mind. These are the qualities whose influence will last, when the lustre of all that once sparkled and dazzled has passed away.</P>
<P>Let not then the season of youth be barren of im∣provements, so essential to your future felicity and honour. Now is the seed-time of life; and according to "what you sow, you shall reap." Your character is now, under Divine assistance, of your own form∣ing; your fate is, in some measure, put into your own hands. Your nature is as yet pliant and soft. Habits have not established their dominion. Prejudices have not pre-occupied your understanding. The world has not had time to contract and debase your affections. All your powers are more vigorous, disembarrassed,
<PB N="174" REF="035851_0211_1007ABD543E6CB68"/>
and free, than they will be at any future period. Whatever impulse you now give to your desires and passions, the direction is likely to continue. It will form the channel in which your life is to run; nay, it may determine its everlasting issue. Consider then the employment of this important period, as the highest trust which shall ever be committed to you; as in a great measure, decisive of your happiness, in time, and in eternity. As in the succession of the seasons, each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affects the productions of what is next in course; so, in human life, every period of our age, according as it is well or ill spent, influences the happiness of that which is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accomplished and flourishing manhood; and such man∣hood passes of itself, without uneasiness, into respect∣able and tranquil old age. But when nature is turned out of its regular course, disorder takes place in the moral, just as in the vegetable world. If the Spring put forth no blossoms, in Summer there will be no beauty, and in Autumn, no fruit. So, if youth be trifled away without improvement, manhood will pro∣bably be contemptible, and old age miserable. If the beginnings of life have been "vanity," its latter end can scarcely be any other than "vexation of spirit."</P>
<P>I shall finish this address, with calling your attention to that dependence on the blessing of Heaven, which, amidst all your endeavours after improvement, you ought continually to preserve. It is too common with the young, even when they resolve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to set out with presumptuous confidence in themselves. Trusting to their own abi∣lities for carrying them successfully through life, they
<PB N="175" REF="035851_0212_1007ABD890DAC220"/>
are careless of applying to God, or of deriving any assistance from what they are apt to reckon the gloomy discipline of religion. Alas! how little do they know the dangers which await them! Neither human wis∣dom, nor human virtue, unsupported by religion, is equal to the trying situations which often occur in life. By the shock of temptation, how frequently have the most virtuous intentions been overthrown! Under the pressure of disaster, how often has the great∣est constancy sunk! "Every good, and every perfect gift is from above." Wisdom and virtue, as well as "riches and honour, come from God." Destitute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his favour, you are in no better situation, with all your boasted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackless desert, without any guide to conduct them, or any shelter to cover them from the gathering storm. Correct, then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect not, that your happiness can be independent of him who made you. By faith and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, seek the protection of the God of heaven. I conclude with the solemn words, in which a great prince de∣livered his dying charge to his son; words, which every young person ought to consider as addressed to himself, and to engrave deeply on his heart: "Solo∣mon, my son, know thou the God of thy fathers; and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind. For the Lord searcheth all hearts, and under∣standeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for∣sake him, he will cast thee off for ever."</P>

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Earthquake at Calabria, in the Year 1638.</HEAD>
<P>AN account of this dreadful earthquake, is given by the celebrated Father Kircher. It happened whilst he was on his journey to visit Mount AEtna, and the rest of the wonders that lie towards the south of Italy. Kircher is considered by scholars, as one of the great∣est prodigies of learning.</P>
<P>"Having hired a boat, in company with four more, (two friars of the order of St. Francis, and two seculars,) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> launched, from the harbour of Messina, in Sicily; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd arrived, the same day, at the promontory of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣lorus. Our destination was for the city of Euphaemia, in Calabria; where we had some business to transact; and where we designed to tarry for some time. How∣ever, Providence seemed willing to cross our design; for we were obliged to continue three days at Pelorus, on account of the weather: and though we often put out to sea, yet we were as often driven back. At length, wearied with the delay, we resolved to prose∣cute our voyage; and, although the sea seemed more than usually agitated, we ventured forward. The gulph of Charybdis, which we approached, seemed
<PB N="177" REF="035851_0214_1007ABDC74452638"/>
whirled round in such a manner, as to form a vast hollow, verging to a point in the centre. Proceeding onward, and turning my eyes to AEtna, I saw it cast forth large volumes of smoke, of mountainous sizes, which entirely covered the island, and blotted out the very shores from my view. This, together with the dreadful noise, and the sulphurous stench which was strongly perceived, filled me with apprehensions, that some more dreadful calamity was impending. The sea itself seemed to wear a very unusual appearance: they who have seen a lake in a violent shower of rain, covered all over with bubbles, will conceive some idea of its agitations. My surprise was still increased, by the calmness and serenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud, which might be supposed to put all Na∣ture thus into motion. I therefore warned my com∣panions, that an earthquake was approaching; and, after some time, making for the shore with all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> diligence, we landed at Tropea, happy and thankf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for having escaped the threatening dangers of we sea."</P>
<P>"But our triumphs at land were of short duration; for we had scarcely arrived at the Jesuits' College, in that city, when our ears were stunned with a horrid sound, resembling that of an infinite number of cha∣riots, driven fiercely forward; the wheels rattling, and the thongs cracking. Soon after this, a most dreadful earthquake ensued; so that the whole tract upon which we stood, seemed to vibrate, as if we were in the scale of a balance, that continued wavering. This motion, however, soon grew more violent; and being no longer able to keep my legs, I was thrown prostrate upon the ground. In the mean time, the universal ruin round
<PB N="178" REF="035851_0215_1007ABDFB3280220"/>
me redoubled my amazement. The crash of falling houses, the tottering of towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to raise my terror and despair. On every side of me, I saw nothing but a scene of ruin; and danger threatening wherever I should fly. I commended myself to God, as my last great refuge. At that hour, O how vain was every sublunary happi∣ness! Wealth, honour, empire, wisdom, all mere use∣less sounds, and as empty as the bubbles in the deep! Just standing on the threshold of eternity, nothing but God was my pleasure; and the nearer I approached, I only loved him the more. After some time, how∣ever, finding that I remained unhurt, amidst the gene∣ral concussion, I resolved to venture for safety; and running as fast as I could, I reached the shore, but al∣most terrified out of my reason. I did not search long here, till I found the boat in which I had landed; and my companions also, whose terrors were even greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han mine. Our meeting was not of that kind, where (two) y one is desirous of telling his own happy escape: we was all silence, and a gloomy dread of impending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>terrors."</P>
<P>"Leaving this seat of desolation, we prosecuted our voyage along the coast; and the next day came to Rochetta, where we landed, although the earth still continued in violent agitations. But we were scarcely arrived at our inn, when we were once more obliged to return to the boat; and, in about half an hour, we saw the greater part of the town, and the inn at which we had set up, dashed to the ground, and burying the inhabitants beneath the ruins."</P>
<P>"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little vessel, finding no safety at land, and yet, from the
<PB N="179" REF="035851_0216_1007ABE24D4C4C00"/>
smallness of our boat, having but a very dangerous con∣tinuance at sea, we at length landed at Lopizium, a castle midway between Tropaea and Euphaemia, the city to which, as I said before, we were bound. Here, wherever I turned my eyes, nothing but scenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and castles levelled to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ground; Strombalo, though at sixty miles distance, belching forth flames in an unusual manner, and with a noise which I could distinctly hear. But my attention was quickly turned from more remote, to contiguous danger. The rumbling sound of an approaching earthquake, which we by this time were grown ac∣quainted with, alarmed us for the consequences; it every moment seemed to grow louder, and to ap∣proach nearer. The place on which we stood now began to shake most dreadfully; so that being unable to stand, my companions and I caught hold of what∣ever shrub grew next to us, and supported ourselves in that manner."</P>
<P>"After some time, this violent paroxysm ceasing, we again stood up, in order to prosecute our voyage to Euphaemia, which lay within sight. In the mean time, while we were preparing for this purpose, I turned my eyes towards the city, but could see only a fright∣ful dark cloud, that seemed to rest upon the place. This the more surprised us, as the weather was so very serene. We waited therefore, till the cloud had passed away; then turning to look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the city, it was to∣tally sunk. Wonderful to tell! nothing but a dismal and putrid lake was se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> where it stood. We looked about to find some one that could tell us of its sad catastrophe, but could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no person. All was become a melancholy solitude; a scene of hideous desolation.
<PB N="180" REF="035851_0217_1007ABE4A9B9EA50"/>
Thus proceeding pensively along, in quest of some human being that could give us a little information, we at length saw a boy sitting by the shore, and ap∣pearing stupified with terror. Of him, therefore, we inquired concerning the fate of the city; but he could not be prevailed on to give us an answer. We en∣treated him, with every expression of tenderness and pity, to tell us; but his senses were quite wrapt up in the contemplation of the danger he had escaped. We offered him some victuals, but he seemed to loath the sight. We still persisted in our offices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f kindness; but he only pointed to the place of the city, like one out of his senses; and then running up into the woods, was never heard of after. Such was the fate of the city of Euphaemia▪ and as we continued our melan∣choly course along the shore, the whole coast, for the space of two hundred miles, presented nothing but the remains of cities; and men scattered, without a habi∣tation, over the fields. Proceeding thus along, we at length ended our distressful voyage, by arriving at Naples, after having escaped a thousand dangers both at sea and land."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Letter from Pliny to Geminius.</HEAD>
<P>DO WE not sometimes observe a sort of people, who though they are themselves under the abject dominion of every vice, show a kind of malicious resentment against the errors of others; and are most severe upon those whom they most resemble? yet, surely a lenity of disposition, even in persons who have the least occa∣sion

for clemency themselves, is of all virtues the most becoming. The highest of all characters, in my estima∣tion, is his, who is as ready to pardon the errors of mankind, as if he were every day guilty of some him∣self; and, at the same time, as cautious of committing a fault, as if he never forgave one. It is a rule then which we should, upon all occasions, both private and public, most religiously observe; "to be inexorable to our own failings, while we treat those of the rest of the world with tenderness, not excepting even such as forgive none but themselves."</P>
<P>I shall, perhaps, be asked, who it is that has given occasion to these reflections. Know then that a cer∣tain person lately—but of that when we meet—though, upon second thoughts, not even then; lest, whilst I condemn and expose his conduct, I should act counter to that maxim I particularly recommend. Whoever therefore, and whatever he is, shall remain in silence: for though there may be some use, perhaps, in setting a mark upon the man, for the sake of example, there will be more, however, in sparing him, for the sake of humanity.

<HEAD>SECTION III. Letter from Pliny to Marcellinus, on the death of an amiable young woman.</HEAD>
<P>I WRITE this under the utmost oppression of sorrow: the youngest daughter of my friend Fundamus is dead! Never surely was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e a more agreeable, and more amiable young person; or one who better deserved to have enjoyed a long, I had almost said, an immortal
<PB N="182" REF="035851_0219_1007ABE983C19028"/>
life! She had all the wisdom of age, and discretion of a matron, joined with youthful sweetness and virgin modesty. With what an engaging fondness did she behave to her father! How kindly and respectfully re∣ceive his friends! How affectionately treat all those who, in their respective offices, had the care and edu∣cation of her! She employed much of her time in reading, in which she discovered great strength of judgment; she indulged herself in few diversions, and those with much caution. With what forbearance, with what patience, with what courage did she endure her last illness! She complied with all the directions of her physicians; she encouraged her sister, and her father; and, when all her strength of body was ex∣hausted, supported herself by the single vigour of her mind. That, indeed, continued, even to her last mo∣ments, unbroken by the pain of a long illness, or the terrors of approaching death; and it is a reflection which makes the loss of her so much the more to be lamented. A loss infinitely severe! and more severe by the particular conjuncture in which it happened! She was contracted to a most worthy youth; the wedding day was fixed, and we were all invited.—How sad a change from the highest joy, to the deepest sorrow! How shall I express the wound that pierced my heart, when I heard Fundamus himself, (as grief is ever finding out circumstances to aggravate its afflic∣tion,) ordering the money he had designed to lay out upon clothes and jewels for her marriage, to be em∣ployed in myrrh and spices for her funeral? He is a man of great learning and good sense, who has applied himself from his earliest youth, to the noblest and most elevated studies; but all the maxims of fortitude,
<PB N="183" REF="035851_0220_1007ABEC00E26508"/>
which he has received from books, or advanced him∣self, he now absolutely rejects; and every other virtue of his heart gives place to all a parent's tenderness. We shall excuse, we shall even approve his sorrow, when we consider what he has lost. He has lost a daughter who resembled him in his manners, as well as his person; and exactly copied out all her father. If his friend Marcellinus shall think proper to write to him, upon the subject of so reasonable a grief, let me remind him not to use the rougher arguments of con∣solation, and such as seem to carry a sort of reproof with them; but those of kind and sympathizing hu∣manity. Time will render him more open to the dic∣tates of reason: for as a fresh wound shrinks back from the hand of the surgeon, but by degrees submits to, and even requires the means of its cure; so a mind, under the first impressions of a misfortune, shuns and rejects all arguments of consolation; but at length, if applied with tenderness, calmly and willingly ac∣quiesces in them.

<HEAD>SECTION IV. On Discretion.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE often thought, if the minds of men were laid open, we should see but little difference between that of the wise man, and that of the fool.</P>
<P>There are infinite reveries, numberless extrava∣gances, and a succession of vanities, which pass through both. The great difference is, that the first knows how to pick and cull his thoughts for con∣versation,
<PB N="184" REF="035851_0221_1007ABEFE61F9CF0"/>
by suppressing some, and communicating others; whereas the other lets them all indifferently fly out in words. This sort of discretion, however, has no place in private conversation between intimate friends. On such occasions, the wisest men very often talk like the weakest; for indeed the talking with a friend is nothing else but <HI>thinking aloud.</HI></P>
<P>Tully has therefore very justly exposed a precept, delivered by some ancient writers, That a man should live with his enemy in such a manner, as might leave him room to become his friend; and with his friend, in such a manner, that, if he became his enemy, it should not be in his power to hurt him. The first part of this rule, which regards our behaviour towards an enemy, is indeed very reasonable, as well as very prudential; but the latter part of it, which regards our behaviour towards a friend, favours more of cun∣ning than of discretion; and would cut a man off from the greatest pleasures of life, which are the freedoms of conversation with a bosom friend. Besides that, when a friend is turned into an enemy, the world is just enough to accuse the perfidiousness of the friend, rather than the indiscretion of the person who con∣fided in him.</P>
<P>Discretion does not only show itself in words, but in all the circumstances of action; and is like an under-agent of Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary concerns of life.</P>
<P>There are many more shining qualities in the mind of man, but there is none so useful as discretion. It is this, indeed, which gives a value to all the rest; which sets them at work in their proper times and places; and turns them to the advantage of the person
<PB N="185" REF="035851_0222_1007ABF2637EC2F0"/>
who is possessed of them. Without it, learning is pedantry, and wit impertinence; virtue itself looks like weakness; the best parts only qualify a man to be more sprightly in errors, and active to his own pre∣judice.</P>
<P>Discretion does not only make a man the master of his own parts, but of other men's. The discreet man finds out the talents of those he converses with; and knows how to apply them to proper uses. Accord∣ingly, if we look into particular communities and divisions of men, we may observe, that it is the dis∣creet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the conversation, and gives mea∣sures to the society. A man with great talents, but void of discretion, is like Polyphemus in the fable, strong and blind; endued with an irresistible force, which, for want of sight, is of no use to him.</P>
<P>Though a man have all other perfections, and want discretion, he will be of no great consequence in the world; but if he have this single talent in perfection, and but a common share of others, he may do what he pleases in his particular station of life.</P>
<P>At the same time that I think discretion the most useful talent a man can be master of, I look upon cun∣ning to be the accomplishment of little, mean, unge∣nerous minds. Discretion points out the noblest ends to us; and pursues the most proper and laudable me∣thods of attaining them: cunning has only private selfish aims; and sticks at nothing which may make them succeed. Discretion has large and extended views; and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind of short-sightedness, that discovers the minutest objects which are near at
<PB N="186" REF="035851_0223_1007ABF5A0292B68"/>
hand, but is not able to discern things at a distance. Discretion, the more it is discovered, gives a greater authority to the person who possesses it; cunning, when it is once detected, loses its force, and makes a man incapable of bringing about even those events which he might have done, had he passed only for a plain man. Discretion is the perfection of reason; and a guide to us in all the duties of life; cunning is a kind of instinct, that only looks out after our immediate interest and welfare. Discretion is only found in men of strong sense and good understandings: cunning is often to be met with in brutes themselves; and in per∣sons who are but the fewest removes from them. In short, cunning is only the mimic of discretion; and it may pass upon weak men, in the same manner as vivacity is often mistaken for wit, and gravity, for wisdom.</P>
<P>The cast of mind which is natural to a discreet man, makes him look forward into futurity, and consider what will be his condition millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at present. He knows that the misery or happiness which is reserved for him in another world, loses nothing of its reality by being placed at so great a distance from him. The objects do not appear little to him because they are remote. He considers, that those pleasures and pains which lie hid in eternity, approach nearer to him every mo∣ment; and will be present with him in their full weight and measure, as much as those pains and plea∣sures which he feels at this very instant. For this reason, he is careful to secure to himself that which is the proper happiness of his nature, and the ultimate design of his being. He carries his thoughts to the
<PB N="187" REF="035851_0224_1007ABF802C6B950"/>
end of every action; and considers the most distant, as well as the most immediate effects of it. He super∣sedes every little prospect of gain and advantage which offers itself here, if he does not find it con∣sistent with his views of an hereafter. In a word, his hopes are full of immortality; his schemes are large and glorious; and his conduct suitable to one who knows his true interest, and how to pursue it by pro∣per methods.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. On the Government of our Thoughts.</HEAD>
<P>A MULTITUDE of cases occur, in which we are no less accountable for what we think, than for what we do.</P>
<P>As, first, when the introduction of any train of thought depends upon ourselves, and is our voluntary act; by turning our attention towards such objects, awakening such passions, or engaging in such employ∣ments, as we know must give a peculiar determination to our thoughts. Next, when thoughts, by whatever accident they may have been originally suggested, are indulged with deliberation and complacency. Though the mind has been passive in their reception, and, there∣fore, free from blame; yet, if it be active in their conti∣nuance, the guilt becomes its own. They may have in∣truded at first, like unbidden guests; but if, when enter∣ed, they are made welcome, and kindly entertained, the case <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>he same as if they had been invited from the be∣ginning. If we be thus accountable to God for thoughts either voluntarily introduced, or deliberately indulged,
<PB N="188" REF="035851_0225_1007ABF9B6F0D990"/>
we are no less so, in the last place, for those which find admittance into our hearts from supine negligence, from total relaxation of attention, from allowing our imagination to rove with entire licence, "like the eyes of the fool, towards the ends of the earth." Our minds are, in this case, thrown open to folly and vanity. They are prostituted to every evil thing which pleases to take possession. The consequences must all be charged to our account; and in vain we plead excuse from human infirmity. Hence it appears, that the great object at which we are to aim in governing our thoughts, is, to take the most effectual measures for preventing the introduction of such as are sinful, and for hastening their expulsion, if they shall have intro∣duced themselves without consent of the will.</P>
<P>But when we descend into our breasts, and examine how far we have studied to keep this object in view, who can tell, "how oft he hath offended?" In no article of religion or morals are men more culpably remiss, than in the unrestrained indulgence they give to fancy; and that too, for the most part without remorse. Since the time that Reason began to exert her powers, Thought, during our waking hours, has been active in every breast, without a moment's suspension or pause. The current of ideas has been always flowing. The wheels of the spiritual engine have circulated with perpetual motion. Let me ask, what has been the fruit of this incessant activity with the greater part of mankind? Of the innumerable hours that have been employed in thought, how few are marked with any permanent or useful effect? How many have either passed away in idle dreams; or have been abandoned to anxious discontented musings, to unsocial and ma∣lignant
<PB N="189" REF="035851_0226_1007ABFDC082A550"/>
passions, or to irregular and criminal desires! Had I power to lay open that storehouse of iniquity which the hearts of too many conceal; could I draw out and read to them a list of all the imaginations they have devised, and all the passions they have indulged in secret; what a picture of men should I present to themselves! What crimes would they appear to have perpetrated in secrecy, which to their most intimate companions they durst not reveal!</P>
<P>Even when men imagine their thoughts to be in∣nocently employed, they too commonly suffer them to run out into extravagant imaginations, and chimerical plans of what they would wish to attain, or choose to be, if they could frame the course of things according to their desire. Though such employments of fancy come under the same description with those which are plainly criminal, yet wholly unblamable they seldom are. Besides the waste of time which they occasion, and the misapplication <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich they indicate of those intellectual powers that were given to us for much nobler purposes, such romantic speculations lead us always into the neighbourhood of forbidden regions. They place us on dangerous ground. They are for the most part connected with some one bad passion; and they always nourish a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddy and frivolous turn of thought. They unfit the mind for applying with vigour to rational <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>suits, or for acquiescing in sober plans of conduct. From that ideal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in which it allows itself to dwell, it returns, to the commerce of men, unbent and relaxed, sickly and tainted, averse from discharging the duties, and sometimes disqualified even for relishing the pleasures, of ordinary life.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. On the Evils which flow from unrestrained Passions.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN man revolted from his Maker, his passions rebelled against himself; and, from being originally the ministers of reason, have become the tyrants of the soul. Hence, in treating of this subject, two things may be assumed as principles: first, that through the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>nt weakness of the understanding, our passions are often directed towards improper objects; and next, that even when their direction is just, and their ob∣jects are innocent, they perpetually tend to run into excess; they always hurry us towards their gratifica∣tion, with a blind and dangerous impetuosity. On these, two points then turns the whole government of our passions: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to ascertain the proper objects of their pursuit; and next, to restrain them in that pur∣suit, when they would carry us beyond the bounds of reason. If there be any passion which intrudes itself unseasonably into our mind, which darkens and trou∣bles our judgment, or habitually discomposes our tem∣per; which unfits us for properly discharging the du∣ties, or disqualifies us for cheerfully enjoying the com∣forts of life, we may certainly conclude it to have gained a dangerous ascendant. The great object which we ought to propose to ourselves, is, to acquire a firm and steadfast mind, which the infatuation of pas∣sion shall not seduce, nor its violence shake; which, resting on fixed principles, shall, in the midst of con∣tending emotions, remain free, and master of itself;
<PB N="191" REF="035851_0228_1007AC0298080DC8"/>
able to listen calmly to the voice of conscience, and prepared to obey its dictates without hesitation.</P>
<P>To obtain, if possible, such command of passion, is one of the highest attainments of the rational nature. Arguments to show its importance crowd upon us from every quarter. If there be any fertile source of mis∣chief to human life, it is, beyond doubt, the misrule of passion. It is this which poisons the enjoyment of individuals, overturns the order of society, and strews the path of life with so many miseries, as to render it indeed the vale of tears. All those great scenes of public calamity, which we behold with astonishment, and horror, have originated from the source of violent passions. These have overspread the earth with blood∣shed. These have pointed the assassin's dagger, and filled the poisoned bowl. These, in every age, have furnished too copious materials for the orator's pathetic declamation, and for the poet's tragical song.</P>
<P>When from public life we descend to private con∣duct, though passion operates not there in such a wide and destructive sphere, we shall find its influence to be no less baneful. I need not mention the black and fierce passions, such as envy, jealousy and revenge, whose effects are obviously noxious, and whose agita∣tions are immediate misery. But take any of the licen∣tious and sensual kind. Suppose it to have unlimited scope; trace it throughout its course; and we shall find that gradually, as it rises, it taints the soundness, and troubles the peace of his mind over whom it reigns; that, in its progress, it engages him in pursuits which are marked either with danger or with shame; that, in the end, it wastes his fortune, destroys his health, or debases his character; and aggravates all the miseries
<PB N="192" REF="035851_0229_1007AC0420739630"/>
in which it has involved him, with the concluding pangs of bitter remorse. Through all the stages of this fatal course, how many have heretofore run! What multi∣tudes do we daily behold pursuing it, with blind and headlong steps!</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. On the proper State of our Temper, with respect to one another.</HEAD>
<P>IT is evident, in the general, that if we consult ei∣ther public welfare or private happiness, Christian charity ought to regulate our disposition in mutual in∣tercourse. But as this great principle admits of several diversified appearances, let us consider some of the chief forms under which it ought to show itself in the usual tenour of life.</P>
<P>What, first, presents itself to be recommended, is a peaceable temper; a disposition averse to give offence, and desirous of cultivating harmony, and amicable in∣tercourse in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ciety. This supposes yielding and con∣descending manners, unwillingness to contend with others about trifles, and, in contests that are unavoid∣able, proper moderation of spirit. Such a temper is the first principle of self-enjoyment. It is the basis of all order and happiness among mankind. The positive and contentious, the rude and quarrelsome, are the bane of society. They seem destined to blast the small share of comfort which nature has here alloted to man. But they cannot disturb the peace of others, more than they break their own. The hurricane rages first in their own bosom, before it is let forth upon the
<PB N="193" REF="035851_0230_1007AC079C7CE090"/>
world. In the tempests which they raise, they are always tost; and frequently it is their lot to perish.</P>
<P>A peaceable temper must be supported by a candid one, or a disposition to view the conduct of others with fairness and impartiality. This stands opposed to a jealous and suspicious temper, which ascribes every action to the worst motive, and throws a black shade over every character. If we would be happy in ourselves, or in our connexions with others, let us guard against this malignant spirit. Let us study that charity "which thinketh no evil;" that temper which, without degenerating into credulity, will dispose us to be just; and which can allow us to observe an error, without imputing it as a crime. Thus we shall be kept free from that continual irritation, which imagi∣nary injuries raise in a suspicious breast; and shall walk among men as our brethren, not as our enemies.</P>
<P>But to be peaceable, and to be candid, is not all that is required of a good man. He must cultivate a kind, generous, and sympathizing temper, which feels for distress, wherever it is beheld; which enters into the concerns of his friends with ardour; and to all with whom he has intercourse, is gentle, obliging, and hu∣mane. How amiable appears such a disposition, when contrasted with a malicious or envious temper, which wraps itself up in its own narrow interest, looks with an evil eye on the success of others, and, with an un∣natural satisfaction, feeds on their disappointments or miseries! How little does he know of the true happi∣ness of life, who is a stranger to that intercourse of good offices and kind affections, which, by a pleasing charm, attaches men to one another, and circulates joy from heart to heart!</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="035851_0231_1007AC09F78CBFB8"/>
We are not to imagine, that a benevolent temper finds no exercise, unless when opportunities offer of performing actions of high generosity, or of extensive utility. These may seldom occur. The condition of the greater part of mankind, in a good measure, pre∣cludes them. But, in the ordinary round of human affairs, many occasions daily present themselves of miti∣gating the vexations which others suffer; of soothing their minds; of aiding their interest; of promoting their cheerfulness, or ease. Such occasions may relate to the smaller incidents of life. But let us remember, that of small incidents the system of human life is chiefly composed. The attentions which respect these, when suggested by real benignity of temper, are often more material to the happiness of those around us, than actions which carry the appearance of greater dig∣nity and splendour. No wise or good man ought to account any rules of behaviour as below his regard, which tend to cement the great brotherhood of man∣kind in comfortable union.</P>
<P>Particularly amidst that familiar intercourse which belongs to domestic life, all the virtues of temper find an ample range. It is very unfortunate, that within that circle, men too often think themselves at liberty, to give unrestrained vent to the caprice of passion and humour. Whereas there, on the contrary, more than any where, it concerns them to attend to the government of their heart; to check what is violent in their tem∣pers, and to soften what is harsh in their manners. For there the temper is formed. There, the real character displays itself. The forms of the world dis∣guise men when abroad. But within his own family, every man is known to be what he truly is.—In all
<PB N="195" REF="035851_0232_1007AC0C59C47368"/>
our intercourse then with others, particularly in that which is closest and most intimate, let us cultivate a peaceable, a candid, a gentle and friendly temper. This is the temper to which, by repeated injunctions, our holy religion seeks to form us. This was the tem∣per of Christ. This is the temper of Heaven.</P>

<P>IS IT bigotry to believe the sublime truths of the gospel, with full assurance of faith? I glory in such bigotry. I would not part with it for a thousand worlds. I congratulate the man who is possessed of it: for, amidst all the vicissitudes and calamities of the present state, that man enjoys an inexhaustible fund of consolation, of which it is not in the power of fortune to deprive him.</P>

<P>Poetry is sublime, when it awakens in the mind any great and good affection, as piety, or patriotism. This is one of the noblest effects of the heart. The Psalms are remarkable, beyond all other writings, for their power of inspiring devout emotions. But it is not in this respect only, that they are sublime. Of the Divine nature, they contain the most magnificent

The meek and the humble; the penitent and the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ful; the peaceful and the pure; those that hunger and thirst after righteousness; those that labour, but faint not, under persecution! Lord! how different are thy maxims from those of the children of this world! They call the proud happy; and admire the gay, the rich, the powerful, and the victorious. But let a vain world take its gaudy trifles, and dress up the foolish creatures that pursue them. May our souls share in that happiness which the Son of God came to recommend and to procure! May we obtain mercy of the Lord; may we be owned as his children; enjoy his presence; and inherit his king∣dom! With these enjoyments, and these hopes, we will cheerfully welcome the lowest, or the most pain∣ful circumstances.</P>
<P>Let us be animated to cultivate those amiable vir∣tues, which are here recommended to us; this humi∣lity and meekness; this penitent sense of sin; this ar∣dent desire after righteousness; this compassion and purity; this peacefulness and fortitude of soul; and, in a word, this universal goodness which becomes us, as we sustain the character of "the salt of the earth," and "the light of the world."</P>
<P>Is there not reason to lament, that we answer the character no better? Is there not reason to exclaim, with a good man in former times, "Blessed Lord! either these are not thy words, or we are not Christ∣ians!" Oh, season our hearts more effectually with thy grace!

<P>OMAR, the son of Hussan, had passed seventy-five years, in honour and prosperity. The favour of three successive califs had filled his house with gold and silver; and whenever he appeared, the benedictions of the people proclaimed his passage.</P>
<P>Terrestrial happiness is of short continuance. The brightness of the flame is wasting its fuel; the fragrant flower is passing away in its own odours. The vigour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Omar began to fail; the curls of beauty fell from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> head; strength departed from his hands; and agility from his feet. He gave back to the calif the keys of trust, and the seals of secrecy; and sought no other pleasure for the remains of life, than the con∣verse of the wise, and the gratitude of the good.</P>
<P>The powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His chamber was filled by visitants, eager to catch the dictates of experience, and officious to pay the tribute of admiration. Caled, the son of the viceroy of Egypt, entered every day early, and retired late. He was beautiful and eloquent: Omar admired his wit, and loved his docility. "Tell me," said Caled, "thou to whose voice nations have listened, and whose wisdom is known to the extremities of Asia, tell me how I may resemble Omar the prudent. The arts by which thou

hast gained power and preserved it, are to thee no longer necessary or useful: impart to me the secret of thy conduct, and teach me the plan upon which thy wisdom has built thy fortune."</P>
<P>"Young man," said Omar, "it is of little use to form plans of life. When I took my first survey of the world, in my twentieth year, having considered the various conditions of mankind, in the hour of solitude I said thus to myself, leaning against a cedar, which spread its branches over my head: 'Seventy years are allowed to man: I have yet fifty remaining. Ten years I will allot to the attainment of knowledge, and ten I will pass in foreign countries; I shall be learned, and therefore shall be honoured; every city will shout at my arrival, and every student will solicit my friendship.

I will not, however, deviate too far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the beaten track of life; but will try what can be found in female delicacy.

I will then retire to a rural dwelling; pass my days in obscurity and con∣templation; and lie silently down on the bed of death. Through my life it shall be my settled resolution, that I will never depend upon the smile of princes; that I will never stand exposed to the artifices of courts; I will never pant for public honours, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disturb my

quiet with the affairs of state.' Such was my scheme of life, which I impressed indelibly upon my me∣mory."</P>
<P>"The first part of my ensuing time was to be spent in search of knowledge, and I know not how I was diverted from my design. I had no visiole impedi∣ments without, nor any ungovernable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> within. I regarded knowledge as the highest honour, and the most engaging pleasure; yet day stole upon day, and month glided after month; till I found that seven years of the first ten had vanished, and left nothing behind them. I now postponed my purpose of travelling; for why should I go abroad, while so much remained to be learned at home? I immured myself for four years, and studied the laws of the empire. The fame of my skill reached the judges: I was found able to speak upon doubtful questions; and was commanded to stand at the footstool of the calif. I was heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith attention; I was consulted with confidence; and the love of praise fastened on my heart."</P>
<P>"I still wished to see distant countries; listened with rapture to the relations of travellers; and resolved some time to ask my dismission, that I might feast my soul with novelty: but my presence was always neces∣sary; and the stream of business hurried me along. Sometimes I was afraid lest I should be charged with ingratitude; but I still proposed to travel, and there∣fore would not confine myself by marriage."</P>
<P>"In my fiftieth year, I began to suspect that the time of travelling was past; and thought it best to lay hold on the felicity yet in my power, and indulge myself in domestic pleasures. But at fifty no man easily finds a woman beautiful as the Houries, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as Zobeide.

I inquired and rejected, consulted and deliberated, till the sixty-second year made me ashamed of wishing to marry. I had now nothing left but retirement; and for retirement I never found a time, till disease forced me from public employment."</P>
<P>"Such was my scheme, and such has been its con∣sequence. With an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I trifled away the years of improvement; with a restless desire of seeing different countries, I have always re∣sided in the same city; with the highest expectation of connubial felicity, I have lived unmarried; and with unalterable resolutions of contemplative retirement, I am going to die within the walls of Bagdat."</P>

If he is master of riches or influence, it affords him the means of increasing his own enjoyment, by re∣lieving the wants, or increasing the comforts of others. If he commands not these advantages, yet all the com∣forts, which he sees in the possession of the deserving, become in some sort his, by his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy. Even the face of nature yields a satisfaction to him, which the insensible can-never know. The profusion of goodness which he beholds poured forth on the universe, dilates his-heart with
<PB N="202" REF="035851_0239_1007AC2002B509F8"/>
the thought, that innumerable multitudes around him are blest and happy. When he sees the labours of men appearing to prosper, and views a country flourishing in wealth and industry; when he beholds the spring coming forth in its beauty, and reviving the decayed face of nature; or in autumn beholds the fields loaded with plenty, and the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts his affections with gratitude to the great Father of all, and rejoices in the general felicity and joy.</P>
<P>It may indeed be objected, that the same sensibility lays open the heart to be pierced with many wounds, from the distresses which abound in the world; ex∣poses us to frequent suffering from the participation which it communicates of the sorrows, as well as of the joys, of friendship. But let it be considered, that the tender melancholy of sympathy, is accompanied with a sensation, which they who feel it would not exchange for the gratifications of the selfish. When the heart is strongly moved by any of the kind affec∣tions, even when it pours itself forth in virtuous sor∣row, a secret attractive charm mingles with the pain∣ful emotion; there is a joy in the midst of grief. Let it be farther considered, that the griefs which sen∣sibility introduces, are counterbalanced by pleasures which flow from the same source. Sensibility height∣ens in general the human powers, and is connected with acuteness in all our feelings. If it makes us more alive to some painful sensations, in return, it renders the pleasing ones more vivid and animated. The selfish man languishes in his narrow circle of pleasures. They are confined to what affects his own interest. He is obliged to repeat the same gratifi∣cations,
<PB N="203" REF="035851_0240_1007AC22934FC960"/>
till they become insipid. But the man of virtuous sensibility moves in a wider sphere of felicity. His powers are much more frequently called forth into occupations of pleasing activity. Numberless oc∣casions open to him of indulging his favourite taste, by conveying satisfaction to others. Often it is in his power, in one way or other, to sooth the afflicted heart; to carry some consolation into the house of woe. In the scenes of ordinary life, in the domestic and social intercourses of men, the cordiality of his affections cheers and gladdens him. Every appear∣ance, every description of innocent happiness, is en∣joyed by him. Every native expression of kindness and affection among others, is felt by him, even though he be not the object of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying one another, he is as happy as the happiest. In a word, he lives in a different sort of world from what the selfish man inhabits. He possesses a new sense, that enables him to behold objects which the selfish cannot see. At the same time, his enjoyments are not of that kind which remain merely on the sur∣face of the mind. They penetrate the heart. They enlarge and elevate, they refine and ennoble it. To all the pleasing emotions of affection, they add the dignified consciousness of virtue.—Children of men! men formed by nature to live and to feel as brethren! how long will ye continue to estrange yourselves from one another by competitions and jealousies, when in cordial union ye might be so much more blest? How long will ye seek your happiness in selfish gratifi∣cations alone, neglecting those purer and better sources of joy, which flow from the affections and the heart?</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. On the true Honour of Man.</HEAD>
<P>THE proper honour of man arises not from some of those splendid actions and abilities, which excite high admiration. Courage and prowess, military re∣nown, signal victories and conquests, may render the name of a man famous, without rendering his cha∣racter truly honourable. To many brave men, to many heroes renowned in story, we look up with wonder. Their exploits are recorded. Their praises are sung. They stand as on an eminence above the rest of mankind. Their eminence, nevertheless, may not be of that sort, before which we bow with inward esteem and respect. Something more is wanted for that purpose, than the conquering arm, and the in∣trepid mind. The laurels of the warrior must at all times be dyed in blood, and bedewed with the tears of the widow and the orphan. But if they have been stained by rapine and inhumanity; if sordid avarice has marked his character; or low and gross sensuality has degraded his life; the great hero sinks into a little man. What at a distance, or on a superficial view, we admired, becomes mean, perhaps odious, when we examine it more closely. It is like the Colossal statue, whose immense size struck the spectator afar off with astonishment; but when nearly viewed, it appears disproportioned, unshapely, and rude.</P>
<P>Observations of the same kind may be applied to all the reputation derived from civil accomplishments; from the refined politics of the statesman; or the lite∣rary
<PB N="205" REF="035851_0242_1007AC26AD556860"/>
efforts of genius and erudition. These bestow, and, within certain bounds, ought to bestow, emi∣nence and distinction on men. They discover talents which in themselves are shining; and which become highly valuable, when employed in advancing the good of mankind. Hence, they frequently give rise to same. But a distinction is to be made between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame and true honour. The statesman, the orator, or the poet, may be famous; while yet the man him∣self is far from being honoured. We envy his abi∣lities. We wish to rival them. But we would not choose to be classed with him who possessed them. Instances of this sort are too often found in every re∣cord of ancient or modern history.</P>
<P>From all this it follows, that, in order to discern where man's true honour lies, we must look, not to any adventitious circumstance of fortune; not to any single sparkling quality; but to the whole of what forms a man; what entitles him, as such, to rank high among that class of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngs to which he belongs; in a word, we must look to the mind and the soul.—A mind superior to fear to selfish interest and corrup∣tion; a mind governed by the principles of uniform rectitude and integrity; the same in prosperity and adversity; which no bribe can seduce, nor terror over∣awe; neither by pleasure melted into effeminacy, now by dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss sunk into dejection: such is the mind which forms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> distinction and eminence of man.—One, who, in no situ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> of life, is either ashamed or afraid of discharging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> duty, and acting his proper part with firmness and constancy; tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the God whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he worships, and tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the faith in which he professes to believe; full of affection to his brethren of man∣kind;
<PB N="206" REF="035851_0243_100A2EDC752BC160"/>
faithful to his friends, generous to his enemies, warm with compassion to the unfortunate; self-deny∣ing to little private interests and pleasures, but zealous for public interest and happiness; magnanimous, with∣out being proud; humble, without being mean; just, without being harsh; simple in his manners, but manly in his feelings; on whose word we can entirely rely; whose countenance never deceives us; whose pro∣fessions of kindness are the effusions of his heart: one, in fine, whom, independent of any views of advan∣tage, we would choose for a superior, could trust in as a friend, and could love as a brother:—This is the man, whom in our heart, above all others, we do, we must, honour.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. The Influence of Devotion on the Happiness of Life.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER promotes and strengthens virtue, whatever calms and regulates the temper, is a source of happiness. Devotion produces those effects in a remarkable degree. It inspires composure of spirit, mildness, and benignity; weakens the painful, and cherishes the pleasing emotions; and, by these means, carries on the life of a pious man in a smooth and placid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Beside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exerting this habitual influence on the mind, devotion opens a field of enjoyments, to which the vicious are entire strangers; enjoyments the more valuable, as they peculiarly belong to retirement, when the world leaves us; and to adversity, when it
<PB N="207" REF="035851_0244_100935F8851FD420"/>
becomes our foe. These are the two seasons, for which every wise man would most wish to provide some hidden store of comfort. For let him be placed in the most favourable situation which the human state admits, the world can neither always amuse him, nor always shield him from distress. There will be many hours of vacuity, and many of dejection, in his life. If he be a stranger to God, and to devotion, how dreary will the gloom of solitude often prove! With what oppressive weight will sickness, disappointment, or old age, fall upon his spirits! But, for those pensive periods, the pious man has a relief prepared. From the tiresome repetition of the common vanities of life, or from the painful corrosion of its cares and sor∣rows, devotion transports him into a new region; and surrounds him there with such objects, as are the most fitted to cheer the dejection, to calm the tumults, and to heal the wounds of his heart. If the world has been empty and delusive, it gladdens him with the prospect of a higher and better order of things, about to arise. If men have been ungrateful and base, it displays before him the faithfulness of that Supreme Being, who, though every other friend fail, will never forsake him. Let us consult our experience, and we shall find, that the two greatest sources of inward joy, are, the exercise of love directed towards a de∣serving object, and the exercise of hope terminating on some high and assured happiness. Both these are supplied by devotion; and therefore we have no reason to be surprised, if, on some occasions, it fills the hearts of good men with a satisfaction not to be ex∣pressed.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="035851_0245_100935F703306BE8"/>
The refined pleasures of a pious mind are, in many respects, superior to the coarse gratifications of sense. They are pleasures which belong to the highest powers, and best affections of the soul; whereas the gratifications of sense reside in the lowest region of our nature. To the latter, the soul stoops below its na∣tive dignity. The former, raise it above itself. The latter, leave always a comfortless, often a mortifying, remembrance behind them. The former, are reviewed wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h applause and delight. The pleasures of sense resemble a foaming torrent, which, after a disorderly course, speedily runs out, and leaves an empty and offensive channel. But the pleasures of devotion re∣semble the equable current of a pure river, which enlivens the fields through which it passes, and dif∣fuses verdure and fertility along its banks. To thee, O Devotion! we owe the highest improvement of our nature, and much of the enjoyment of our life. Thou art the support of our virtue, and the rest of our souls, in this turbulent world. Thou composest the thoughts. Thou calmest the passions. Thou exaltest the heart. Thy communications, and thine only, are imparted to the low, no less than to the high; to the poor, as well as to the rich. In thy presence, worldly distinc∣tions cease; and under thy influence, worldly sorrows are forgotten. Thou art the balm of the wounded mind. Thy sanctuary is ever open to the miserable; inaccessible only to the unrighteous and impure. Thou beginnest on earth, the temper of heaven. In thee, the hosts of angels and blessed spirits eternally rejoice.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. The planetary and terrestrial Worlds comparatively considered.</HEAD>
<P>TO US, who dwell on its surface, the earth is by far the most extensive orb that our eyes can any where behold: It is also clothed with verdure, distinguished by trees, and adorned with a variety of beautiful de∣corations; whereas, to a spectator placed on one of the planets, it wears a uniform aspect; looks all lu∣minous; and no larger than a spot. To beings who dwell at still greater distances, it entirely disappears. That which we call alternately the morning and the evening star, as in one part of the orbit she rides foremost in the procession of night, in the other ushers in and anticipates the dawn, is a planetary world, which, with the four others that so wonderfully vary their mystic dance, are in themselves dark bodies, and shine only by reflection; have fields, and seas, and skies of their own; are furnished with all accommo∣dations for animal subsistence, and are supposed to be the abodes of intellectual life; all which, together with our earthly habitation, are dependent on that grand dispenser of Divine munificence, the sun; receive their light from the distribution of his rays, and derive their comfort from his benign agency.</P>
<P>The sun, which seems to perform its daily stages through the sky, is in this respect fixed and immovable: it is the great axle of heaven, about which the globe we inhabit, and other more spacious orbs, wheel their stated courses. The sun, though seemingly smaller
<PB N="210" REF="035851_0247_100935F091187AE8"/>
than the dial it illuminates, is abundantly larger than this whole earth, on which so many lofty mountains rise, and such vast oceans roll. A line extending from side to side through the centre of that resplendent orb, would measure more than eight hundred thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles: a girdle formed to go round its circumference, would require a length of millions. Were its solid con∣tents to be estimated, the account would overwhelm our understanding, and be almost beyond the power of language to express. Are we startled at these re∣ports of philosophy? Are we ready to cry out in a transport of surprise, "How mighty is the Being who kindled such a prodigious fire; and keeps alive, from age to age, such an enormous mass of flame!" let us attend our philosophic guides, and we shall be brought acquainted with speculations more enlarged and more inflaming.</P>
<P>This sun, with all its attendant planets, is but a very little part of the grand machine of the universe; every star, though in appearance no bigger than the diamond that glitters upon a lady's ring, is really a vast globe, like the sun in size and in glory; no less spacious, no less luminous, than the radiant source of day. So that every star, is not barely a world, but the centre of a magnificent system; has a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attractive influ∣ence, all which are lost to our sight in unmeasurable wilds of ether. That the stars appear like so many diminutive and scarcely distinguishable points, is owing to their immense and inconceivable distance. Immense and inconceivable indeed it is, since a ball, shot from the loaded cannon, and flying with unabated rapidity, must travel, at this impetuous rate, almost
<PB N="211" REF="035851_0248_100935F4344F8678"/>
seven hundred thousand years, before it could reach the nearest of these twinkling luminaries.</P>
<P>While, beholding this vast expanse, I learn my own extreme meanness, I would also discover the abject littleness of all terrestrial things. What is the earth, with all her ostentatious scenes, compared with this astonishing grand furniture of the skies? What, but a dim speck, hardly perceivable in the map of the universe? It is observed by a very judicious writer, that if the sun himself, which enlightens this part of the creation, were extinguished, and all the host of planetary worlds, which move about him, were anni∣hilated, they would not be missed by an eye that can take in the whole compass of nature, any more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore. The bulk of which they consist, and the space which they occupy, are so exceedingly little in comparison of the whole, that their loss would scarcely leave a blank in the immensity of God's works. If then, not our globe only, but this whole system, be so very diminutive, what is a king∣dom or a county? What are a few lordships, or the so much admired patrimonies of those who are styled wealthy? When I measure them with my own little pittance, they swell into proud and bloated dimen∣sions: but when I take the universe for my standard, how scanty is their size, how contemptible their figure! They shrink into pompous nothings.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XV. On the Power of Custom, and the Uses to which it may be applied.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a common saying, which has a better turn of sense in it, than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar, that 'Custom is a second nature.' It is indeed able to form the man anew; and give him inclinations and capacities altogether different from those he was born with. A person who is addicted to play or gaming, though he took but little delight in it at first, by degrees contracts so strong an inclination towards it, and gives himself up so entirely to it, that it seems the only end of his being. The love of a retired or busy life will grow upon a man insensibly, as he is conversant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified for relishing that to which he has been for some time disused. Nay, a man may smoke, or drink, or take snuff, till he is unable to pass away his time without it; not to mention how our delight in any particular study, art, or science, rises and improves, in proportion to the application which we bestow upon it. Thus, what was at first an exercise, becomes at length an entertainment. Our employments are changed into diversions. The mind grows fond of those actions it is accustomed to; and is drawn with reluctancy from those paths in which it has been used to walk.</P>
<P>If we attentively consider this property of human nature, it may instruct us in very fine moralities. In the first place, I would have no man discouraged with
<PB N="213" REF="035851_0250_1007AC38A16D57B0"/>
that kind of life, or series of action, in which the choice of others, or his own necessities, may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very disagreeable to him, at first; but use and application will certainly render it not only less painful, but pleasing and satisfactory.</P>
<P>In the second place, I would recommend to every one, the admirable precept, which Pythagoras is said to have given to his disciples, and which that philosopher must have drawn from the observation I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>larg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon: "Pitch upon that course of life which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most excellent, and custom will render it the most de∣lightful." Men, whose circumstances will permit them to choose their own way of life, are inexcusable if they do not pursue that which their judgment tells them is the most laudable. The voice of reason is more to be regarded, than the bent of any present inclination; since, by the rule above mentioned, in∣clination will at length come over to reason, though we can never force reason to comply with inclina∣tion.</P>
<P>In the third place, this observation may teach the most sensual and irreligious man, to overlook those hard∣ships and difficulties, which are apt to discourage him from the prosecution of a virtuous life. "The Gods," said Hesiod, "have placed labour before virtue; the way to her is at first rough and difficult, but grows more smooth and easy the farther we advance in it." The man who proceeds in it with steadiness and resolution, will in a little time, find that "her ways are ways of pleasantness, and that all her paths are peace."</P>
<P>To enforce this consideration, we may further ob∣serve, that the practice of religion will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only be
<PB N="214" REF="035851_0251_1007AC3B4FC840B0"/>
attended with that pleasure, which naturally accompa∣nies those actions to which we are habituated, but with those supernumerary joys of heart, that rise from the consciousness of such a pleasure; from the satisfaction of acting up to the dictates of reason; and from the prospect of a happy immortality.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, we may learn from this observa∣tion, which we have made on the mind of man, to take particular care, when we are once settled in a regular course of life, how we too frequently indulge ourselves in even the most innocent diversions and entertainments; since the mind may insensibly fall off from the relish of virtuous actions, and, by degrees, exchange that plea∣sure▪ which it takes in the performance of its duty for delights of a much inferior and an unprofitable nature.</P>
<P>The last use which I shall make of this remarkable property in human nature, of being delighted with those actions to which it is accustomed, is, to show how absolutely necessary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we would enjoy the pleasures of the next. The state of bliss, we call Heaven, will not be capable of affecting those minds which are not thus qualified for it: we must in this world, gain a relish of truth and virtue, if we would be able to taste that knowledge and perfection, which are to make us happy in the next. The seeds of those spiritual joys and raptures, which are to rise up and flourish in the soul to all eternity, must be planted in it during this its present state of probation. In short, heaven is not to be looked upon only as the reward, but as the na∣tural effect, of a religious life.</P>

<P>HAPPY that man, who, unembarrassed by vulgar cares, master of himself, his time, and fortune, spends his time in making himself wiser; and his fortune, in making others (and therefore himself) happier; who, as the will and understanding are the two ennobling faculties of the soul, thinks himself not compleat, till his understanding is beautified with the valuable fur∣niture of knowledge, as well as his will enriched with every virtue; who has furnished himself with all the advantages to relish solitude and enliven conversation; who when serious is not sullen; and when cheerful, not indiscreetly gay; whose ambition is, not to be ad∣mired for a false glare of greatness, but to be beloved for the gentle and sober lustre of his wisdom and good∣ness.

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. Description of Candour.</HEAD>
<P>TRUE candour is altogether different from that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arded, inoffensive language, and that studied open∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of behaviour, which we so frequently meet with among men of the world. Smiling, very often, is the aspect, and smooth are the words, of those who in∣wardly are the most ready to think evil of others. That candour which is a Christian virtue, consists, not in fairness of speech, but in fairness of heart. It may want the blandishment of external courtesy, but supplies its place with humane and generous li∣berality of sentiment. Its manners are unaffected, and its professions cordial. Exempt, on one hand, from the dark jealousy of a suspicious mind, it is no less removed, on the other, from that easy credulity which is im∣posed on by every specious pretence. It is perfectly consistent with extensive knowledge of the world, and with due attention to our own safety. In that various intercourse, which we are obliged to carry on with persons of every different character, suspicion, to a certain degree, is a necessary guard. It is only when it exceeds the bounds of prudent caution, that it de∣generates into vice. There is a proper mean between undistinguishing credulity, and universal jealousy, which a sound understanding discerns, and which the man of candour studies to preserve.</P>
<P>He makes allowance for the mixture of evil with good, which is to be found in every human character. He expects none to be faultless; and he is unwilling
<PB N="217" REF="035851_0254_1007AC446BBCB378"/>
to believe that there is any without some commendable quality. In the midst of many defects, he can discover a virtue. Under the influence of personal resentment, he can be just to the merit of an enemy. He never lends an open car to those defamatory reports and dark suggestions, which, among the tribes of the cen∣sorious, circulate with so much rapidity, and meet with such ready acceptance. He is not hasty to judge, and he requires full evidence before he will condemn. As long as an action can be ascribed to different mo∣tives, he holds it as no mark of sagacity to impute it always to the worst. Where there is just ground for doubt, he keeps his judgment undecided; and, dur∣ing the period of suspense, leans to the most charitable construction which an action can bear. When he must condemn, he condemns with regret; and without those aggravations which the severity of others adds to the crime. He listens calmly to the apology of the offend∣er, and readily admits every extenuating circumstance which equity can suggest. How much soever he may blame the principles of any sect or party, he never confounds, under one general censure, all who belong to that party or sect. He charges them not with such consequences of their tenets, as they refuse and dis∣avow. From one wrong opinion, he does not infer the subversion of all sound principles; nor from one bad action, conclude that all regard to conscience is over∣thrown. When he "beholds the mote in his brother's eye," he remembers "the beam in his own." He commiserates human frailty; and judges of others according to the principles, by which he would think it reasonable that they should judge of him. In a word, he views men and actions in the clear sunshine
<PB N="218" REF="035851_0255_1007AC3701DC2688"/>
of charity and good-nature; and not in that dark and sullen shade which jealousy and party-spirit throw over all characters.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVIII. On the Imperfection of that Happiness which rests solely on worldly Pleasures.</HEAD>
<P>THE vanity of human pleasures is a topic which might be embellished with the pomp of much descrip∣tion. But I shall studiously avoid exaggeration, and only point out a threefold vanity in human life, which every impartial observer cannot but admit; disap∣pointment in pursuit, dissatisfaction in enjoyment, un∣certainty in possession.</P>
<P>First, disappointment in pursuit. When we look around us on the world, we every where behold a busy multitude, intent on the prosecution of various designs, which their wants or desires have suggested. We behold them employing every method which in∣genuity can devise; some the patience of industry, some the boldness of enterprize, others the dexterity of stratagem, in order to compass their ends. Of this incessant stir and activity, what is the fruit? In com∣parison of the crowd who have toiled in vain, how small is the number of the successful? Or rather, where is the man who will declare, that in every point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has completed his plan, and attained his utmost wish? No extent of human abilities has been able to discover a path which, in any line of life, leads unerringly to success. "The race is not always to the swift, nor the
<PB N="219" REF="035851_0256_1007924FF38B9A38"/>
battle to the strong, nor riches to men of understand∣ing." We may form our plans with the most profound sagacity, and with the most vigilant caution may guard against dangers on every side. But some unforeseen occurrence comes across, which baffles our wisdom, and lays our labours in the dust.</P>
<P>Were such disappointments confined to those who aspire at engrossing the higher departments of life, the misfortune would be less. The humiliation of the mighty, and the fall of ambition from its towering height, little concern the bulk of mankind. These are objects on which, as on distant meteors, they gaze from afar, without drawing personal instruction from events so much above them. But, alas! when we descend into the regions of private life, we find disappointment and blasted hope equally prevalent there. Neither the moderation of our views, nor the justice of our pretensions, can ensure success. But "time and chance happen to all." Against the stream of events, both the worthy and the undeserving are obliged to struggle; and both are frequently overborne alike by the current.</P>
<P>Besides disappointment in pursuit, dissatisfaction in enjoyment is a farther vanity, to which the human state is subject. This is the severest of all mortifications, after having been successful in the pursuit, to be baffled in the enjoyment itself. Yet this is found to be an evil still more general than the former. Some may be so fortunate as to attain what they have pur∣sued; but none are rendered completely happy by what they have attained. Disappointed hope is mi∣sery; and yet successful hope is only imperfect bliss. Look through all the ranks of mankind. Examine the
<PB N="220" REF="035851_0257_100792544277BE90"/>
condition of those who appear most prosperous; and you will find that they are never just what they desire to be. If retired, they languish for action; if busy, they complain of fatigue. If in middle life, they are impatient for distinction; if in high stations, they sigh after freedom and ease. Something is still wanting to that plenitude of satisfaction, which they expected to acquire. Together with every wish that is gratified, a new demand arises. One void opens in the heart, as another is filled. On wishes, wishes grow; and to the end, it is rather the expectation of what they have not, than the enjoyment of what they have, which occupies and interests the most successful.</P>
<P>This dissatisfaction in the midst of human pleasure, springs partly from the nature of our enjoyments them∣selves, and partly from circumstances which corrupt them. No worldly enjoyments are adequate to the high desires and powers of an immortal spirit. Fancy paints them at a distance with splendid colours; but possession unveils the fallacy. The eagerness of pas∣sion bestows upon them, at first, a brisk and lively relish. But it is their fate always to pall by familiarity, and sometimes to pass from satiety into disgust. Happy would the poor man think himself, if he could enter on all the treasures of the rich; and happy for a short time he might be: but before he had long contem∣plated and admired his state, his possessions would seem to lessen, and his cares would grow.</P>
<P>Add to the unsatisfying nature of our pleasures, the attending circumstances which never fail to corrupt them. For, such as they are, they are at no time possessed unmixed. To human lips it is not given to taste the cup of pure joy. When external circum∣stances
<PB N="221" REF="035851_0258_10079255CC0F4BA8"/>
show fairest to the world, the envied man groans in private under his own burden. Some vexa∣tion disquiets, some passion corrodes him; some distress, either felt or feared, gnaws, like a worm, the root of his felicity. When there is nothing from without to disturb the prosperous, a secret poison operates within. For worldly happiness ever tends to destroy itself, by corrupting the heart. It fosters the loose and the violent passions. It engenders noxious habits; and taints the mind with false delicacy, which makes it feel a thousand unreal evils.</P>
<P>But put the case in the most favourable light. Lay aside from human pleasures both disappointment in pursuit, and deceitfulness in enjoyment; suppose them to be fully attainable, and completely satisfactory; still there remains to be considered the vanity of un∣certain possession and short duration. Were there in worldly things any fixed point of security which we could gain, the mind would then have some basis on which to rest. But our condition is such, that every thing wavers and totters around us. "Boast not thy∣self of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth." It is much if, during its course, thou hearest not of somewhat to disquiet or alarm thee. For life never proceeds long in a uniform train. It is continually varied by unexpected events. The seeds of alteration are every where sown; and the sunshine of prosperity commonly accelerates their growth. If our enjoyments be numerous, we lie more open on different sides to be wounded. If we have possessed them long, we have greater cause to dread an approaching change. By slow degrees pro∣sperity
<PB N="222" REF="035851_0259_1007AB5B27A3E360"/>
rises; but rapid is the progress of evil. It re∣quires no preparation to bring it forward. The edi∣fice which it cost much time and labour to erect, one inauspicious event, one sudden blow, can level with the dust. Even supposing the accidents of life to leave us untouched, human bliss must still be transi∣tory; for man changes of himself. No course of en∣joyment can delight us long. What amused our youth, loses its charm in maturer age. As years advance, our powers are blunted, and our pleasurable feelings decline. The silent lapse of time is ever carrying somewhat from us, till at length the period comes, when all must be swept away. The prospect of this termination of our labours and pursuits, is sufficient to mark our state with vanity. "Our days are a hand-breadth, and our age is as nothing." Within that little space is all our enterprise bounded. We crowd it with toils and cares, with contention and strife. We project great designs, entertain high hopes, and then leave our plans unfinished, and sink into ob∣livion.</P>
<P>This much let it suffice to have said concerning the vanity of the world. That too much has not been said, must appear to every one who considers how generally mankind lean to the opposite side; and how often, by undue attachment to the present state, they both feed the most sinful passions, and "pierce them∣selves through with many sorrows."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIX. What are the real and solid Enjoyments of Human Life.</HEAD>
<P>IT must be admitted, that unmixed and complete happiness is unknown on earth. No regulation of conduct can altogether prevent passions from disturb∣ing our peace, and misfortunes from wounding our heart. But after this concession is made, will it fol∣low, that there is no object on earth which deserves our pursuit, or that all enjoyment becomes contemptible which is not perfect? Let us survey our state with an impartial eye, and be just to the various gifts of Hea∣ven. How vain soever this life, considered in itself, may be, the comforts and hopes of religion are suf∣ficient to give solidity to the enjoyments of the righ∣teous. In the exercise of good affections, and the testimony of an approving conscience; in the sense of peace and reconciliation with God, through the great Redeemer of mankind; in the firm confidence of be∣ing conducted through all the trials of life, by infinite wisdom and goodness; and in the joyful prospect of arriving, in the end, at immortal felicity, they possess a happiness which, descending from a purer and more perfect region than this world, partakes not of its vanity.</P>
<P>Besides the enjoyments peculiar to religion, there are other pleasures of our present state, which, though of an inferior order, must not be overlooked in the estimate of human life. It is necessary to call atten∣tion to these, in order to check that repining and un∣thankful
<PB N="224" REF="035851_0261_1007AB6035362588"/>
spirit to which man is always too prone. Some degree of importance must be allowed to the comforts of health, to the innocent gratifications of sense, and to the entertainment afforded us by all the beautiful scenes of nature; some to the pursuits and harmless amusements of social life; and more to the internal enjoyments of thought and reflection, and to the pleasures of affectionate intercourse with those whom we love. These comforts are often held in too low estimation, merely because they are ordinary and common; although that is the circumstance which ought, in reason, to enhance their value. They lie open, in some degree, to all; extend through every rank of life, and fill up agreeably many of those spaces in our present existence, which are not occupied with higher objects, or with serious cares.</P>
<P>From this representation it appears that, notwith∣standing the vanity of the world, a considerable de∣gree of comfort is attainable in the present state. Let the recollection of this serve to reconcile us to our condition, and to repress the arrogance of com∣plaints and murmurs.—What art thou, O son of man! who having sprung but yesterday out of the dust, darest to lift up thy voice against thy Maker, and to arraign his providence, because all things are not or∣dered according to thy wish? What title hast thou to find fault with the order of the universe, whose lot is so much beyond what thy virtue or merit gave thee ground to claim? Is it nothing to thee to have been introduced into this magnificent world; to have been admitted as a spectator of the Divine wisdom and works; and to have had access to all the comforts which nature, with a bountiful hand, has poured
<PB N="225" REF="035851_0262_1007AB629465B5D0"/>
forth around thee? Are all the hours forgotten which thou hast passed in ease, in complacency, or joy? Is it a small favour in thy eyes, that the hand of Divine Mercy has been stretched forth to aid thee, and, if thou reject not its proffered assistance, is ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nduct thee into a happier state of existence? When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ou comparest thy condition with thy desert, blush, and be ashamed of thy complaints. Be silent, be grateful, and adore. Receive with thankfulness the blessings which are allowed thee. Revere that go∣vernment which at present refuses thee more. Rest in this conclusion, that though there are evils in the world, its Creator is wise and good, and has been bountiful to thee.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XX. Scale of Beings.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there is a great deal of pleasure in con∣templating the material world; by which I mean, that system of bodies, into which nature has so curiously wrought the mass of dead matter, with the several relations that those bodies bear to one another; there is still, methinks, something more wonderful and sur∣prising, in contemplations on the world of life; by which I understand, all those animals with which every part of the universe is furnished. The material world is only the shell of the universe: the world of life are its inhabitants.</P>
<P>If we consider those parts of the material world, which lie the nearest to us, and are therefore subject
<PB N="226" REF="035851_0263_1007AB65030ADAB8"/>
to our observations and inquiries, it is amazing to consider the infinity of animals with which it is stocked. Every part of matter is peopled: every green leaf swarms with inhabitants. There is scarcely a single humour in the body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our glasses do not discover myriads of living creatures. We find, even in the most solid bodies, as in marble itself, innumerable cells and ca∣vities, which are crowded with such imperceptible in∣habitants, as are too little for the naked eye to dis∣cover. On the other hand, if we look into the more bulky parts of nature, we see the seas, lakes, and rivers teeming with numberless kinds of living crea∣tures. We find every mountain and marsh, wilder∣ness and wood, plentifully stocked with birds and beasts; and every part of matter affording proper necessaries and conveniences, for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.</P>
<P>The author of "the Plurality of Worlds," draws a very good argument from this consideration, for the peopling of every planet; as indeed it seems very probable, from the analogy of reason, that if no part of matter, with which we are acquainted, lies waste and useless, those great bodies, which are at such a distance from us are not desert and unpeopled; but rather, that they are furnished with beings adapted to their respective situations.</P>
<P>Existence is a blessing to those beings only which are endowed with perception; and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any farther than as it is subservient to beings which are conscious of their existence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> under our observation, that matter is only
<PB N="227" REF="035851_0264_1007AB668A9A1C80"/>
made as the basis and support of animals; and that there is no more of the one than what is necessary for the existence of the other.</P>
<P>Infinite Goodness is of so communicative a nature, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems to delight in conferring existence upon every degree of perceptive being. As this is a spe∣culation, which I have often pursued with great plea∣sure to myself, I shall enlarge farther upon it, by con∣sidering that part of the scale of beings, which comes within our knowledge.</P>
<P>There are some living creatures, which are raised but just above dead matter. To mention only that species of shell-fish, which is formed in the fashion of a cone; that grows to the surface of several rocks; and immediately dies, on being severed from the place where it grew. There are many other crea∣tures but one remove from these, which have no other sense than that of feeling and taste. Others have still an additional one of hearing; others, of smell; and others of sight. It is wonderful to observe, by what a gradual progress the world of life advances, through a prodigious variety of species, before a creature is formed, that is complete in all its senses: and even among these, there is such a different degree of per∣fection, in the sense which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the sense in different animals is distinguished by the same com∣mon denomination, it seems almost of a different na∣ture. If, after this, we look into the several inward per∣fections, of cunning and sagacity, or what we generally call instinct, we find them rising, after the same man∣ner, imperceptibly one above another; and receiving additional improvements, according to the species in
<PB N="228" REF="035851_0265_1007AB68F25E0330"/>
which they are implanted. This progress in nature is so very gradual, that the most perfect of an inferior species, comes very near to the most imperfect of that which is immediately above it.</P>
<P>The exuberant and overflowing goodness of the Supreme Being, whose mercy extends to all his works, is plainly seen, as I have before hinted, in his having made so very little matter, at least what falls within our knowledge, that does not swarm with life. Nor is his goodness less seen in the diversity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he made but one species of animals, none of the rest would have en∣joyed the happiness of existence: he has therefore, <HI>specified,</HI> in his creation, every degree of life, every capacity of being. The whole chasm of nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diverse kinds of creatures, rising one after another, by such a gentle and easy ascent, that the little transitions and devi∣ations from one species to another, are almost insen∣sible. This intermediate space is so well husbanded and managed, that there is scarcely a degree of per∣ception, which does not appear in some one part of the world of life. Is the goodness, or the wisdom of the Divine Being, more manifested in this his pro∣ceeding?</P>
<P>There is a consequence, besides those I have already mentioned, which seems very naturally de∣ducible from the foregoing considerations. If the scale of being rises, by such a regular progress, so high as man, we may, by parity of reason, suppose, that it still proceeds gradually through those beings which are of a superior nature to him; since there is in∣finitely greater space and room for different degrees
<PB N="229" REF="035851_0266_1007AB6C825E79D0"/>
of perfection, between the Supreme Being and man, than between man and the most despicable infect.</P>
<P>In this great system of being, there is no creature so wonderful in its nature, and which so much de∣serves our particular attention, as man; who fills up the middle space between the animal and the intel∣lectual nature, the visible and the invisible world; and who is that link in the chain of beings, which forms the connection between both. So that he who, in one respect, is associated with angels and arch∣angels, and may look upon a being of infinite per∣fection as his father, and the highest order of spirits as his brethren, may in another respect, say, to "corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my sister."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXI. Trust in the care of Providence recommended.</HEAD>
<P>MAN, considered in himself, is a very helpless, and a very wretched being. He is subject every moment to the greatest calamities and misfortunes. He is beset with dangers on all sides; and may become unhappy by numberless casualties, which he could not foresee, nor have prevented had he foreseen them.</P>
<P>It is our comfort, while we are obnoxious to so many accidents, that we are under the care of ONE who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the management of every thing that is capable of annoying or offending us; who knows the assistance we stand in
<PB N="230" REF="035851_0267_1007AB6ED86A2EE0"/>
need of, and is always ready to bestow it on those who ask it of him.</P>
<P>The natural homage, which such a creature bears to so infinitely wise and good a Being, is a firm reliance on him for the blessings and conveniences of life; and an habitual trust in him, for deliverance out of all such dangers and difficulties as may befal us.</P>
<P>The man who always lives in this disposition of mind, has not the same dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who considers himself abstractedly from this relation to the Supreme Being. At the same time that he reflects upon his own weakness and imperfection, he comforts himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith the contem∣plation of those divine attributes, which are em∣ployed for his safety, and his welfare. He finds his want of foresight made up, by the omniscience of him who is his support. He is not sensible of his own want of strength, when he knows that his helper is almighty. In short, the person who has a firm trust on the Supreme Being, is powerful in his power, wise by his wisdom, happy by his happiness. He reaps the benefit of every divine attribute; and loses his own insufficiency in the fulness of infinite perfection.</P>
<P>To make our lives more easy to us, we are com∣manded to put our trust in him, who is thus able to relieve and succour us; the Divine goodness having made such a reliance a duty, notwithstanding we should have been miserable, had it been forbidden us.</P>
<P>Among several motives, which might be made use of to recommend this duty to us, I shall only take notice of those that follow.</P>
<P>The first and strongest is, that we are promised, He will not fail those who put their trust in him.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="035851_0268_1007AB7060DBB288"/>
But without considering the supernatural blessing, which accompanies this duty, we may observe, that it has a natural tendency to its own reward; or, in other words, that this firm trust and confidence in the great Disposer of all things, contributes very much to the getting clear of any affliction, or to the bearing of it manfully. A person who believes he has his succour at hand, and that he acts in the sight of his friend, often exerts himself beyond his abilities; and does wonders, that are not to be matched by one who is not animated with such a confidence of success. Trust in the assistance of an Almighty Being, naturally pro∣duces patience, hope, cheerfulness, and all other dis∣positions of mind, which alleviate those calamities that we are not able to remove.</P>
<P>The practice of this virtue administers great com∣fort to the mind of man, in times of poverty and affliction: but most of all, in the hour of death. When the soul is hovering, in the last moments of its separation; when it is just entering on another state of existence, to converse with scenes, and objects, and companions, that are altogether new; what can support her under such tremblings of thought, such fear, such anxiety, such apprehensions, but the casting of all her cares upon HIM, who first gave her being; who has conducted her through one stage of it; and who will be always present, to guide and com∣fort her in her progress through eternity?</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXII. Piety and Gratitude enliven Prosperity.</HEAD>
<P>PIETY, and gratitude to God, contribute, in a high degree, to enliven prosperity. Gratitude is a pleasing emotion. The sense of being distinguished by the kindness of another, gladdens the heart, warms it with reciprocal affection, and gives to any possession which is agreeable in itself, a double relish, from its being the gift of a friend. Favours conferred by men, I acknowledge may prove burdensome. For human virtue is never perfect; and sometimes unreasonable expectations on the one side, sometimes a mortifying sense of dependence on the other, corrode in secret the pleasure of benefits, and convert the obligations of friendship into grounds of jealousy. But nothing of this kind can affect the intercourse of gratitude with Heaven. Its favours are wholly disinterested; and with a gratitude the most cordial and unsuspici∣ous, a good man looks up to that Almighty Benefactor, who aims at no end but the happiness of those whom he blesses, and who desires no return from them, but a devout and thankful heart. While others can trace their prosperity to no higher source than a concurrence of worldly causes; and often, of mean or trifling in∣cidents, which occasionally favoured their designs; with what superior satisfaction does the servant of God remark the hand of that Gracious Power which hath raised him up; which hath happily conducted him through the various steps of life, and crowned
<PB N="233" REF="035851_0270_1007AB762E0FCF20"/>
him with the most favourable distinction beyond his equals!</P>
<P>Let us farther consider, that not only gratitude for the past, but a cheering sense of Divine favour at the present, enters into the pious emotion. They are only the virtuous, who in their prosperous days hear this voice addressed to them, "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a cheerful heart; for God now accepteth thy works." He who is the Author of their prosperity, gives them a title to enjoy, with complacency, his own gift. While bad men snatch the pleasures of the world as by stealth, without countenance from the Great Proprietor of the world; the righteous sit openly down to the feast of life, under the smile of approving Heaven. No guilty fears damp their joys. The blessing of God rests upon all that they possess; his protection▪ sur∣rounds them; and hence, "in the habitations of the righteous, is found the voice of rejoicing and salva∣tion." A lustre unknown to others, invests, in their sight, the whole face of nature. Their piety reflects a sunshine from heaven upon the prosperity of the world; unites in one point of view, the smiling aspect, both of the powers above, and of the objects below. Not only have they as full a relish as others, of the innocent pleasures of life, but, moreover, in these they hold communion with their Divine Benefactor. In all that is good or fair, they trace his hand. From the beauties of nature, from the improvements of art, from the enjoyments of social life, they raise their affection to the source of all the happiness which surrounds them; and thus widen the sphere of their pleasures, by adding intellectual, and spiritual, to earthly joys.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="035851_0271_1007AB77B58FFD88"/>
For illustration of what I have said on this head, remark that cheerful enjoyment of a prosperous state, which King David had when he wrote the twenty-third psalm; and compare the highest pleasures of the riotous sinner, with the happy and satisfied spirit which breathes throughout that psalm.—In the midst of the splendour of royalty, with what amiable sim∣plicity of gratitude does he look up to the Lord as "his Shepherd;" happier in ascribing all his success to Divine favour, than to the policy of his councils, or to the force of his arms! How many instances of Divine goodness arose before him in pleasing re∣membrance, when with such relish he speaks of the "green pastures and still waters, beside which God had led him; of his cup which he had made to over∣flow; and of the table which he had prepared for him in the presence of his enemies!" With what per∣fect tranquillity does he look forward to the time of his passing through "the valley of the shadow of death;" unappalled by that spectre, whose most distant appearance blasts the prosperity of sinners! He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ars no evil, as long as "the rod and the staff" of his Divine Shepherd are with him; and, through all the unknown periods of this and of future existence, com∣mits himself to his guidance with secure and triumph∣ant hope: "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever."—What a purified, sen∣timental enjoyment of prosperity is here exhibited! How different from that gross relish of worldly pleasures, which belongs to those who behold only the terrestrial side of things; who raise their views to no higher objects than the succession of human con∣tingencies,
<PB N="235" REF="035851_0272_1007AB7A1780FBA8"/>
and the weak efforts of human ability; who have no protector or patron in the heavens, to enliven their prosperity, or to warm their hearts with gratitude and trust!</P>

<P>THE city of Sidon having surrendered to Alex∣ander, he ordered Hephestion to bestow the crown on him whom the Sidonians should think most worthy of that honour. Hephestion being at that time re∣sident with two young men of distinction, offered them the kingdom; but they refused it, telling him that it was contrary to the laws of their country, to admit any one to that honour, who was not of the royal family. He then, having expressed his admi∣ration of their disinterested spirit, desired them to name one of the royal, race, who might remem∣ber that he received the crown through their hands. Overlooking many, who would have been ambitious of this high honour, they made choice of Abdolonymus, whose singular merit had rendered him conspicuous, even in the vale of obscurity. Though remotely related to the royal family, a series of misfortunes had reduced him to the necessity of cultivating a garden, for a small stipend, in the suburbs of the city.</P>
<P>While Abdolonymus was busily employed in weed∣ing his garden, the two friends of Hephestion, bear∣ing
<PB N="236" REF="035851_0273_1007AB7BD3727078"/>
in their hands the ensigns of royalty, approached him, and saluted him king. They informed him that Alexander had appointed him to that office; and re∣quired him immediately to exchange his rustic garb, and utensils of husbandry, for the regal robe and sceptre. At the same time, they admonished him, when he should be seated on the throne, and have a nation in his power, not to forget the humble con∣dition from which he had been raised.</P>
<P>All this, at the first, appeared to Abdolonymus as an illusion of the fancy, or an insult offered to his poverty. He requested them not to trouble him far∣ther with their impertinent jests; and to find some other way of amusing themselves, which might leave him in the peaceable enjoyment of his obscure habi∣tation.—At length, however, they convinced him, that they were serious in their proposal; and prevailed upon him to accept the regal office, and accompany them to the palace.</P>
<P>No sooner was he in possession of the government, than pride and envy created him enemies; who whis∣pered their murmurs in every place, till at last they reached the ear of Alexander. He commanded the new-elected prince to be sent for; and required of him, with what temper of mind he had borne his poverty. "Would to Heaven," replied Abdolony∣mus, "that I may be able to bear my crown with equal moderation: for when I possessed little, I wanted nothing: these hands supplied me with what∣ever I desired." From this answer, Alexander formed so high an idea of his wisdom, that he confirmed the choice which had been made; and annexed a neighbouring province to the government of Sidon.</P>

<P>WITH regard to my poverty, the king has, indeed, been justly informed. My whole estate consists in a house of but mean appearance, and a little spot of ground; from which, by my own labour, I draw my support. But if, by any means, thou hast been per∣suaded to think that this poverty renders me of less consequence in my own country, or in any degree unhappy, thou art greatly deceived. I have no rea∣son to complain of fortune: she supplies me with all that nature requires; and if I am without superfluities, I am also free from the desire of them. With these, I confess I should be more able to succour the neces∣sitous, the only advantage for which the wealthy are to be envied; but small as my possessions are, I can still contribute something to the support of the state, and the assistance of my friends. With respect to honours, my country places me, poor as I am, upon a level with the richest: for Rome knows no quali∣fications for great employments, but virtue and abi∣lity. She appoints me to officiate in the most august ceremonies of religion; she intrusts me with the com∣mand of her armies; she confides to my care the most important negociations. My poverty does not lessen the weight and influence of my counsels in the senate. The Roman people honour me for that very poverty

which King Pyrrhus considers as a disgrace. They know the many opportunities I have had to enrich myself, without censure; they are convinced of my disinterested zeal for their prosperity: and if I have any thing to complain of, in the return they make me, it is only the excess of their applause. What value, then, can I put upon thy gold and silver? What king can add any thing to my fortune? Always attentive to discharge the duties incumbent upon me, I have a mind free from self-reproach; and I have an honest same.</P>

<P>NO PRINCE, so little enterprising and so inoffensive, was ever so much exposed to the opposite extremes of calumny and flattery, of satire and panegyric. And the factions which began in his time, being still con∣tinued, have made his character be as much disputed to this day, as is commonly that of princes who are our contemporaries. Many virtues, however, it must be owned, he was possessed of; but not one of them pure, or free from the contagion of the neighbouring vices. His generosity bordered on profusion, his learn∣ing on pedantry, his pacific disposition on pusillani∣mity, his wisdom on cunning, his friendship on light fancy, and boyish fondness. While he imagined that he was only maintaining his own authority, he may perhaps be suspected in some of his actions, and still more of his pretensions, to have encroached on the
<PB N="239" REF="035851_0276_1007AB83DD137B40"/>
liberties of his people. While he endeavoured, by an exact neutrality, to acquire the good-will of all his neighbours, he was able to preserve fully the esteem and regard of none. His capacity was con∣siderable, but fitter to discourse on general maxims, than to conduct any intricate business.</P>
<P>His intentions were just, but more adapted to the conduct of private life, than to the government of kingdoms. Awkward in his person, and ungainly in his manners, he was ill qualified to command respect: partial and undiscerning in his affections, he was little fitted to acquire general love. Of a feeble temper, more than of a frugal judgment; exposed to our ridi∣cule from his vanity, but exempt from our hatred by his freedom from pride and arrogance. And, upon the whole, it may be pronounced of his character, that all his qualities were sullied with weakness, and embellished by humanity. Political courage he was certainly devoid of; and from thence chiefly is de∣rived the strong prejudice, which prevails against his personal bravery: an inference, however, which must be owned, from general experience, to be extremely fallacious.</P>

<P>THIS great Emperour, in the plenitude of his power, and in possession of all the honours which can flatter the heart of man, took the extraordinary resolution,
<PB N="240" REF="035851_0277_1007AB86376FDD30"/>
to resign his kingdoms; and to withdraw entirely from any concern in business or the affairs of this world, in order that he might spend the remainder of his days in retirement and solitude. Though it requires neither deep reflection, nor extraordinary discernment, to dis∣cover that the state of royalty is not exempt from cares and disappointments; though most of those who are exalted to a throne, find solicitude, and satiety, and disgust, to be their perpetual attendants, in that en∣vied pre-eminence; yet, to descend voluntarily from the supreme to a subordinate station, and to relinquish the possession of power in order to attain the enjoy∣ment of happiness, seems to be an effort too great for the human mind. Several instances, indeed, occur in history, of monarchs who have quitted a throne, and have ended their days in retirement. But they were either weak princes, who took this resolution rashly, and repented of it as soon as it was taken; or unfor∣tunate princes, from whose hands some strong rival had wrested their sceptre, and compelled them to descend with reluctance into a private station. Dio∣clesian is, perhaps, the only prince capable of hold∣ing the reins of government, who ever resigned them from deliberate choice; and who continued, during many years, to enjoy the tranquillity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> retirement, without fetching one penitent sigh, or casting back one look of desire, towards the power or dignity which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad abandoned.</P>
<P>No wonder, then, that Charles's resignation should fill all Europe with astonishment; and give rise, both among his contemporaries, and among the historians of that period, to various conjectures concerning the motives which determined a prince, whose ruling
<PB N="241" REF="035851_0278_1007AB88B5D12920"/>
passion had been uniformly the love of power, at the age of fifty-six, when objects of ambition operate with full force on the mind, and are pursued with the greatest ardour, to take a resolution so singular and unexpected.</P>
<P>The emperour, in pursuance of his determination, having assembled the states of the Low Countries at Brussels, seated himself for the last time, in the chair of state; on one side of which was placed his son, and on the other, his sister the queen of Hungary, regent of the Netherlands, with a splendid retinue of the grandees of Spain and princes of the empire standing behind him. The president of the council of Flan∣ders, by his command, explained, in a few words, his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the states. He then read the instrument of resigna∣tion, by which Charles surrendered to his son Philip all his territories, jurisdiction, and authority in the Low Countries; absolving his subjects there from their oath of allegiance to him, which he required them to transfer to Philip his lawful heir; and to serve him with the same loyalty and zeal that they had mani∣fested, during so long a course of years, in support of his government.</P>
<P>Charles then rose from his seat, and leaning on the shoulder of the Prince of Orange, because he was un∣able to stand without support, he addressed himself to the audience; and, from a paper which he held in his hand, in order to assist his memory, he recounted, with dignity, but without ostentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed, since the commencement of his administration. He obser∣ved, that from the seventeenth year of his age, he
<PB N="242" REF="035851_0279_1007AB8BEE037310"/>
had dedicated all his thoughts and attention to pub∣lic objects, reserving no portion of his time for the indulgence of his ease, and very little for the enjoy∣ment of private pleasure; that either in a pacific or hostile m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner, he had visited Germany nine times, Spain six times, France four times, Italy se∣ven times, the Low Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and had made eleven voyages by sea; that while his health permitted him to dis∣charge his duty, and the vigour of his constitution was equal in any degree to the arduous office of govern∣ing such extensive dominions, he had never shunned labour, nor repined under fatigue; that now, when his health was broken, and his vigour exhausted by the rage of an incurable distemper, his growing infirmi∣ties admonished him to retire; nor was he so fond of reigning, as to retain the sceptre in an impotent hand, which was no longer able to protect his subjects, or to render them happy; that instead of a sovereign worn out with diseases, and scarcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accustomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of youth all the attention and sagacity of maturer years; that if, dur∣ing the course of a long administration, he had com∣mitted any material error in government, or if, under the pressure of so many and great affairs, and amidst the attention which he had been obliged to give to them, he had either neglected or injured any of his subjects, he now implored their forgiveness; that, for his part, he should ever retain a grateful sense of their fidelity and attachment, and would carry the remem∣brance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his sweetest consolation, as well as the best reward
<PB N="243" REF="035851_0280_1007AB8D77F0A208"/>
for all his services; and, in his last prayers to Al∣mighty God, would pour forth his ardent wishes for their welfare.</P>
<P>Then turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and kissed his father's hand, "If," says he, "I had left you, by my death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made such large additions, some regard would have been justly due to my memory on that account; but now, when I voluntarily resign to you what I might have still retained, I may well expect the warmest expressions of thanks on your part. With these, however, I dispense; and shall consider your concern for the welfare of your subjects, and your love of them, as the best and most acceptable testi∣mony of your gratitude to me. It is in your power, by a wise and virtuous administration, to justify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my pa∣ternal affection, and to demonstrate that you are wor∣thy of the confidence which I repose in you. Pre∣serve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be sacred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and if the time shall ever come, when you shall wish to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a son en∣dowed with such qualities, that you can resign your sceptre to him, with as much satisfaction as I give up mine to you."</P>
<P>As soon as Charles had finished this long address to his subjects, and to their new sovereign, he sunk into the chair, exhausted and ready to faint with the fatigue of such an extraordinary effort. During his discourse, the whole audience melted into tears; some from
<PB N="244" REF="035851_0281_1007AB8FE1154CA0"/>
admiration of his magnanimity; others softened by the expressions of tenderness towards his son, and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepest sorrow, at losing a sovereign, who had distin∣guished the Netherlands, his native country, with par∣ticular marks of his regard and attachment.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVII. Continuation of the Emperour Charles V.</HEAD>
<P>A FEW weeks after the resignation of the Nether∣lands, Charles, in an assembly no less splendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous, resigned to his son the crowns of Spain, with all the territories de∣pending on them, both in the old and in the new world. Of all these vast possessions, he reserved no∣thing for himself, but an annual pension of an hundred thousand crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford him a small sum for acts of beneficence and charity.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained to detain him from that ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> for which he languished. Every thing having been prepared some time for his voyage, he set out for Zuitburg in Zealand, where the fleet had orders to rendevous. In his way thither, he passed through Ghent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and after stopping there a few days, to in∣dulge that tender and pleasant melancholy, which arises in the mind of every man in the decline of life, on visiting the place of his nativity, and viewing the scenes and objects familiar to him in his early youth, he pursued his journey, accompanied by his son Philip, his daughter the Arch-duchess, his sisters the Dowager Queens of France and Hungary, Maximilian his son-in-law,
<PB N="245" REF="035851_0282_1007AB935B582AF8"/>
and a numerous retinue of the Flemish nobility. Before he went on board, he dismissed them, with marks of his attention or regard; and taking leave of Philip with all the tenderness of a father who em∣braced his son for the last time, he set fail under con∣voy of a large fleet of Spanish, Flemish, and English ships.</P>
<P>His voyage was prosperous and agreeable; and he arrived at Laredo in Biscay, on the eleventh day after he left Zealand. As soon as he landed, he fell pro∣strate on the ground; and considering himself now as dead to the world, he kissed the earth, and said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of man∣kind." From Laredo he proceeded to Valladolid. There he took a last and tender leave of his two sis∣ters; whom he would not permit to accompany him to his solitude, though they entreated it with tears; not only that they might have the consolation of con∣tributing, by their attendance and care, to mitigate or to sooth his sufferings, but that they might reap instruction and benefit, by joining with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pious exercises, to which he had consecrated the re∣mainder of his days.</P>
<P>From Valladolid, he continued his journey to Pla∣zencia in Estremadura. He had passed through that city a great many years before; and having been struck at that time with the delightful situation of the monastery of St. Justus, belonging to the order of St. Jerome, not many miles distant from that place, he had then observed to some of his attendants, that this was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ot to which Dioclesian might have re∣tired with pleasure. The impression had remained so
<PB N="246" REF="035851_0283_1007AB95BA0A8928"/>
strong on his mind, that he pitched upon it as the place of his retreat. It was seated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a small brook, and sur∣rounded by rising grounds, covered with lofty trees: from the nature of the soil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was esteemed the most healthful and delicious situation in Spain. Some months before his resignation, he had sent an architect thither, to add a new apartment to the monastery, for his accommo∣dation; but he gave strict orders, that the style of the building should be such as suited his present station, rather than his former dignity. It consisted only of six rooms, four of them in the form of friars' cells, with naked walls; the other two, each twenty feet square, were hung with brown cloth, and furnished in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most simple manner. They were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one side into a garden, of which Charles himself had given the plan, and had filled it with various plants, which he proposed to cul∣tivate with his own hands. On the other side, they communicated with the chapel of the monastery, in wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> he was to perform his devotions. Into this humble retreat, hardly sufficient for the comfortable accommodation of a private gentleman, did Charles enter, with twelve domestics only. He buried there, in solitude and silence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all those vast projects, which during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Europe; filling every kingdom in it by turns, with the terrour of his arms, and the dread of being subjected to his power.</P>
<P>In this retirement Charles formed such a plan of life for himself, as would have suited the condition of
<PB N="247" REF="035851_0284_1007AB974615FBC0"/>
a private person of a moderate fortune. His table was neat but plain; his domestics few; his inter∣course with them familiar; all the cumbersome and ceremonious forms of attendance on his person were entirely abolished, as destructive of that social ease and tranquillity, which he courted, in order to sooth the remainder of his days. As the mildness of the climate, together with his deliverance from the bur∣dens and cares of government, procured him, at first, a considerable remission from the acute pains with which he had been long tormented, he enjoyed, per∣haps, more complete satisfaction in this humble so∣litude, than all his grandeur had ever yielded him. The ambitious thoughts and projects, which had so long engrossed and disquieted him, were quite effaced from his mind. Far from taking any part in the po∣litical transactions of the princes of Europe, he re∣strained his curiosity even from any inquiry concern∣ing them; and he seemed to view the busy scene which he had abandoned, with all the contempt and indifference arising from his thorough experience o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its vanity, as well as from the pleasing reflection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having disentangled, himself from its cares.</P>

<L>Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums,</L>
<L>That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth,</L>
<L>Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease.</L>

<L>With thee conversing I forget all time;</L>

<L>But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom</L>

<L>These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,</L>
<L>Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,</L>
<L>That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise:</L>
<L>Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth</L>
<L>Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep.</L>
<L>All these with ceaseless praise his works behold,</L>
<L>Both day and night. How often, from the steep</L>

<L>With heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds,</L>
<L>In full harmonic number join'd, their songs</L>
<L>Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heav'n."</L>
<L>Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd</L>
<L>On to their blissful bow'r.—</L>
<L>—There arrived, both stood,</L>
<L>Both turn'd; and under open sky ador'd</L>

<L>At least, their own; their future selves applauds;</L>
<L>How excellent that life they ne'er will lead!</L>
<L>Time lodg'd in their own hands is Folly's vail;</L>
<L>That lodg'd in Fate's, to Wisdom they consign;</L>
<L>The thing they can't but purpose, they postpone.</L>
<L>'Tis not in folly, not to scorn a fool;</L>

<L>By necessary laws their sure effects,</L>

<L>Might never reach me more. My ear is pain'd,</L>

<L>Of wrong and outrage with which earth is fill'd.</L>
<L>There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart;</L>
<L>It does not feel for man. The nat'ral bond</L>
<L>Of brotherhood is sever'd, as the flax</L>

<L>That sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd.</L>
<L>No: dear as freedom is, and in my heart's</L>

<L>We have no slaves at home—then why abroad?</L>

<L>Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs</L>
<L>Receive our air, that moment they are free;</L>
<L>They touch our country, and their shackles fall.</L>
<L>That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud</L>
<L>And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,</L>

<L>Impatient flouncing through the drifted heaps,</L>

<L>Rush on his nerves, and call their vigour forth</L>
<L>In many a vain attempt. How sinks his soul!</L>
<L>What black despair, what horror fill his heart!</L>
<L>When, for the dusky spot, which Fancy feign'd</L>
<L>His tufted cottage rising through the snow,</L>

<LG>
<L>REMOTE from cities liv'd a swain,</L>
<L>Unvex'd with all the cares of gain;</L>
<L>His head was silver'd o'er with age,</L>
<L>And long experience made him sage;</L>
<L>In summer's heat, and winter's cold,</L>

<LG>
<L>A deep philosopher (whose rules</L>

<LG>
<L>" Whence is thy learning? Hath thy toil</L>
<L>O'er books consum'd the midnight oil?</L>
<L>Hast thou old Greece and Rome survey'd,</L>
<L>And the vast sense of Plato weigh'd?</L>
<L>Hath Socrates thy soul refin'd,</L>
<L>And hast thou fathom'd Tully's mind?</L>

<L>By various fates, on realms unknown,</L>

Hast thou through many cities stray'd,</L>
<L>Their customs, laws, and manners weigh'd?"</L>

<L>" I ne'er the paths of learning try'd;</L>
<L>Nor have I roam'd in foreign parts,</L>
<L>To read mankind, their laws and arts;</L>
<L>For man is practis'd in disguise,</L>
<L>He cheats the most discerning eyes.</L>
<L>Who by that search shall wiser grow?</L>
<L>By that, ourselves we never know.</L>
<L>The little knowledge I have gain'd,</L>
<L>Was all from simple Nature drain'd;</L>
<L>Hence my life's maxims took their rise,</L>
<L>Hence grew my settled hate to vice.</L>

<L>In constancy and nuptial love,</L>

<L>The hen, who from the chilly air,</L>
<L>With pious wing, protects her care,</L>
<L>And ev'ry fowl that flies at large,</L>
<L>Instructs me in a parent's charge.</L>

Can grave and formal pass for wise,</L>
<L>When men the solemn owl despise?</L>
<L>My tongue within my lips I rein;</L>
<L>For who talks much must talk in vain.</L>
<L>We from the wordy torrent fly:</L>
<L>Who listens to the chatt'ring pye?</L>
<L>Nor would I, with felonious flight,</L>
<L>By stealth invade my neighbour's right:</L>
<L>Rapacious animals we hate;</L>
<L>Kites, hawks, and wolves, deserve their fate.</L>
<L>Do not we just abhorrence find</L>
<L>Against the toad and serpent kind?</L>
<L>But envy, calumny, and spite,</L>
<L>Bear stronger venom in their bite.</L>
<L>Thus ev'ry object of creation</L>
<L>Can furnish hints to contemplation;</L>
<L>And, from the most minute and mean,</L>
<L>A virtuous mind can morals glean."</L>

<L>A paradise below.</L>

<LG>
<L>Our babes shall richest comforts bring;</L>
<L>If tutor'd right they'll prove a spring</L>

One general song!—</L>
<L>Ye, chief, for whom the whole creation smiles,</L>
<L>At once the head, the heart, and tongue of all,</L>
<L>Crown the great hymn!</L>
<L>For me, when I forget the darling theme,</L>
<L>Whether the blossom blows; the summer ray</L>
<L>Russets the plain; inspiring Autumn gleams;</L>
<L>Or winter rises in the blackening east;</L>
<L>Be my tongue mute, may Fancy paint no more,</L>
<L>And dead to joy, forget my heart to beat!</L>

<L>Should fate command me to the farthest verge</L>
<L>Of the green earth, to distant barb'rous climes,</L>
<L>Rivers unknown to song; where first the sun</L>
<L>Gilds Indian mountains, or his setting beam</L>
<L>Flames on th' Atlantic isles; 'tis nought to me:</L>
<L>Since God is ever present, ever felt,</L>
<L>In the void waste as in the city full;</L>
<L>And where HE vital breathes there must be joy.</L>
<L>When ev'n at last the solemn hour shall come,</L>
<L>And wing my mystic flight to future worlds,</L>
<L>I cheerful will obey; there, with new pow'rs,</L>
<L>Will rising wonders sing: I cannot go</L>
<L>Where UNIVERSAL LOVE not smiles around,</L>
<L>Sustaining all yon orbs, and all their suns;</L>
<L>From seeming evil still educing good,</L>
<L>And better thence again, and better still,</L>
<L>In infinite progression. But I lose</L>
<L>Myself in HIM, in Light ineffable!</L>
<L>Come then, expressive Silence, muse His praise.</L>

<HEAD>English Reviewers' Character of the preceding Work.</HEAD>
<P>"The plan of this work is highly commendable, and the execution is good. We are particularly pleased with the Compiler's having avoided every sentiment that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, in the least degree, offend the eye or ear of Innocence." <HI>Gentleman's Magazine, February,</HI> 1799.</P>
<P>"There is very considerable merit in this compilation, the contents of which are pretty equally made up of the agreeable and the useful. After a careful inspection, we feel ourselves bound in justice to remark, that it comprises much more novel∣ty, than any compilation of the same size, that ever came into our hands. Three objects are proposed by Mr. Murray, in giving this volume to the world: first, to improve youth in the indispensable art of reading; secondly, to meliorate their lan∣guage and sentiments; and thirdly, to inculcate some of the most important principles of piety and virtue.—The articles selected for the first of these purposes, are peculiarly calculated for exercising the various pauses, inflexions, and modulations of the voice: they are judiciously diversified and proportioned and accurately punctuated.—In pursuance of his second object Mr. Murray has made his selections from the most correct and elegant writers; and purity, propriety, and perspicuity, of course, characterize them.—In his third department, we find extracts strongly tending to promote piety and virtue. They place religion in the most amiable light; and recommend the moral duties, by proving the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. In no part of the work do we meet with an expression that might gratify a corrupt, or vitiate a pure mind; nor a sentiment that can offend the ear of innocence. The Perusal of the Sacred Scriptures is powerful∣ly recommended, by the frequent insertion of the most sublime, beautiful, and interesting passages of these invaluable writings. But, though the general cast of the volume partakes more of the grave than the gay, yet it is not without a considerable portion of rational amusement; and as it is serious without enthusiasm or superstition, so it is cheerful without levity.—We do not fear discrediting our judgment, by recommending</P>

<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<P><HI>While Wars convulse foreign Countries, and fluctuating Politics agitate the public Mind; while we are extending our commercial Connec∣tions, forming Alliances, and drawing Intelli∣gence from every Quarter, it is hoped that this small Work may contribute a Mite to increase our Acquaintance with those, who are now con∣nected with us by Treaties, as well as a Simi∣larity of Laws and Customs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our former Intercourse has been chiefly by War; but Peace, Commerce, and Emigrations are extending our Connections, and awake a Solicitude for more particular Accounts, than any one has yet detailed.</HI></P>
