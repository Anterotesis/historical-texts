</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PErsons of highest improvement in the world, are subject to the Laws of GOD as well as others, and no less exposed, (in case of Sin) to the Wrath of the impartial Judge of the world, who <HI>accepts not the person of Princes, nor regards the Rich more than the poor.</HI> Men that are Exalted to the Higher Places of the Earth, are more out of the reach of Mans short Arm, but still, as much as ever within the reach of an Omnipotent Arm; Indeed no place can be found, that will hide from God's Eye, or secure from his Hand; for he is still above the highest Mountains, easily overturns them in his Wrath, &amp; makes the Pillars of the Earth to Tremble. The various Orders of Men in the World, that look at, either the outward, or inward good of a People, are of God's appointing; And the Lawful Power, Civil or Sacred, that any are Invested with, is from God, who is the Prime Seat, and
<PB N="2" REF="002017_0003_0FBA85B5C05DEEE0"/>
Original of all Power. The greatest in Im∣provement are but Servants in Gods Family, whom he Improves, as the Instruments of his Providence. It is he that Advances one to Rule, calls another near to Minister, and to Bless in his Name; It is he that puts the Sword of Justice into one Hand, and that of the Spirit into another; Charging those that receive such Power, with the most awful Authority, that they have a regard to his Ho∣nour and Glory while they Improve the same in a Discharge of the Duties of their places. And that they may not want Motive, to reach the main Springs of action in the Na∣ture of Man, they are forewarned, that God will deal with them in Proportion to their Carriage &amp; Deportment towards Him, as is expressed in the words Read; <HI>Them that Ho∣nour me I will Honour, &amp; they that Despise me shall be lightly Esteemed.</HI></P>
<P>That God who did Sanctify the whole Seed of <HI>Israel</HI> to be a Holy and Peculiar People to himself, did set apart <HI>Aaron &amp; his Sons</HI> to Minister in the Priests Office; And taught them, both by Precept and indeed, by Ter∣rible things in Righteousness, that <HI>he would be Sanctifyed in them that came nigh him, and had in Reverence of all about him;</HI> yet the most clear, and often repeated Precepts, the most forcea∣ble Motives, were not Sufficient to keep Alive
<PB N="3" REF="002017_0004_0FBA85B723764AF8"/>
in their Hearts, a sense of their Duty, &amp; a care to attend it. That People had not been long Possessed of the Holy Land, before they defil'd it; they quickly turn'd out of the way; And there was not only a grievous Corruption in the Body of the People, but the most Sa∣cred order of men were Defiled; the Cove∣nant of <HI>Levi</HI> was Corrupted; those that hand∣led the Law, and were by Office▪ Obliged to teach others the Knowlege of God, were themselves shamefully Ignorant of him; and they that Ministred before the Lord with Clean Garments did it with Filthy &amp; Impure Souls. It was little better than this, in <HI>Eli's</HI> time, when his Prophane Sons Ministred un∣der him in the Priests Office; as appears by the Character given of them. (1) As to the disposition and state of their Souls, they were <HI>Sons of Belial,</HI> they <HI>Knew not the Lord, Verse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> (2) As to their Conduct of themselves, they were Intemperate, Indulging themselves in unclean Lusts <HI>Verse</HI> 22. (3) And then, as to their doings in Holy things they were <HI>Pro∣fane and Sacrilegious. Verse</HI> 13, 14, 15. Not content with the bountiful Allowance of Hea∣ven: God had not been an hard Master to them, he did not require them to kindle a Fire on his Altar for nought; but had made them partakers with himself at the Altar; be∣sides the large Provisions other ways made for
<PB N="4" REF="002017_0005_0FBA85BA86A97990"/>
their Comfortable and Honourable Support, God had allowed them, certain Portions out of the Offerings made by Fire unto himself; they were not content therewith, but in a Sacrilegious manner, did Seise on Gods Part; And Snatch to themselves out of the best of it, to satisfy their lusting Appetite: Besides they liked not the Appointed way of its being prepared for Use; Neither would stay until God was Served; whereby Foul Indignities were offered unto God, and the Holy things of God were brought into Contempt; for on these accounts, Men Despised the Offerings of the Lord: These things were highly Pro∣voking to a Holy and Jealous God; he sends a Message to <HI>Eli</HI> rather than to his Sons, who was look'd on as a partaker with them in their Sins, in that he had not Interposed his Au∣thority, either as a Parent, or an High Priest, for their Reformation or at least Restraint. Indeed we find mention made of his Mani∣festing his Dislike of their doings, <HI>Verse</HI> 23.<HI>&amp;c,</HI> but its very Probable, he had Connived and kept Silence too long, till they were grown Shameless &amp; Obstinate, &amp; then was too mild in his Reproofs; the case called for other Measures; for although, Mildness &amp; Gentle∣ness be rather to be Chose, yet when the case calls for Severity, it may be a Sin rather than a Duty, and may be a reason of coming short
<PB N="5" REF="002017_0006_0FBA85BBACADED60"/>
of the end. Surely the case was such as did call for a Flaming Zeal, both in Respect of the Honour of God which Suffered, &amp; in Respect of their best Interest in greatest Hazard. By this Indifferency of Spirit and Sinful Indul∣gence, he forfeited the Character given of <HI>Levi</HI> long before; <HI>Deut.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.19. For according to that he should not in such a case have known his own Children: And herein he Honoured his Sons above God. God Resented these things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Threatens to Deal in a very Astonishing manner with his House; and a reason hereof is Rendered from Gods Stedfast Purpose &amp; the Unvarying Method of his Practice, <HI>Them that Honour me I will Honour, &amp;c.</HI> God is wont to Proportion his Dealings with Men, to their Carriage and Deportment to∣wards himself; such Measure as Men Mete, is Wisely and Justly Measured to them. He is truly a Bountiful Lord, who will abundantly Reward such as faithfully Serve Him; and is wont to suit the Rewards to the Work; but he is a Just &amp; a Jealous God, who is tender of his own Honour, &amp; will not put up the Af∣fronts and Indignities that are offered to him by Prophane and Haughty Sinners; but will Repay them to their Faces, by pouring Con∣tempt upon them, and staining the Pride of their Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002017_0007_0FBA85BD388256D0"/>
In the Words Read, we have an <HI>Honourable Work Propounded,</HI> and an <HI>Encouraging Reward Promised.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Let us consider the <HI>Work</HI> it self Propounded and Expected, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> To <HI>Honour</HI> GOD. <HI>Them that Honour Me,</HI> &amp;c. Honour is a Word that is often used and indeed taken in various senses; an Enumeration is needless, and would be tedious. It may suffice to observe the meaning must be determined by the Party or Object to whom it is to be Paid; Now the Object here mentioned, is GOD himself; A Being Exalted far above all Blessing &amp; Praise; &amp; therefore it cannot be by adding any Lustre or Glory to him, but by such actions as hold forth great thoughts of God, do become his Excellency &amp; tend to his Praise. We are to consider, that God is a Being of all Possible Perfection; we are Creatures that are full of Im∣perfections; and therefore we can add nothing to God; yet are we Creatures Capable of en∣tertaining some sense of the Perfection, Ex∣cellency &amp; Glory of God, &amp; of expressing the same in agreeable Actions, such Actions as are becoming his Excellency; and when we do so, God is pleased to account it an Honour done to Him. Which Work, is excellently suited to the Nature of Man, &amp; Propounded unto all; not restrained or limited to Persons of Publick Improvement, but a Work belonging
<PB N="7" REF="002017_0008_0FBA85BEC40C6468"/>
to all: Indeed such persons have greater Ad∣vantages in their hands for the Glorifying of God, &amp; God expects a greater tribute of Ho∣nour &amp; Glory from them: But it is a Work Propounded unto all, &amp; indeed fitted for every one; Not below the Highest, nor above the Meanest, but well suiting the Nature of Man, &amp; appointed to every one; indeed the very End of Mans Being, the Business of his Life, the Sum of his Duty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us consider the Glorious <HI>Reward</HI> secu∣red by Promise to such as attend and perform this Work; and this is <HI>Honour from</HI> GOD. <HI>Them that honour Me, I will Honour.</HI> The work it self is Honourable, &amp; Honour is promised in Reward thereof. The word Translated Honour, Signifys Weightiness, &amp; the Reward of Vertue hath Weight &amp; Worth in it. We add nothing to God when we Honour him; But when God Honours us there is a true Lustre added; The Creature is set on high, he is made truly Great &amp; Glorious. Now God will certainly Honour such as Honour Him: He is the Fountain of Honour, he is the God of Glory Riches &amp; Honour come of him, &amp; in his Hands it is to make great &amp; to set on high, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. 12. And he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tainly make good his Word. Tho' he make others Mean, &amp; expose them to Contempt, yet he will not neglect such as Honour him: <HI>The wise shall in∣herit Glory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002017_0009_0FBA85C0231C3478"/>
Hence the Words afford this Doctrine;</P>
<P>DOCT. GOD will bestow Honour on such as Honour Him.</P>
<P>Honour is one of those things the Mind of Man does Naturally desire &amp; reach after, &amp; not in Vain. The wise Author of Nature has universally fitted &amp; apportioned an Object to each natural Power. There is undoubtedly an Honour that is proportioned to a reasonable nature, &amp; often propounded unto Man as wor∣thy of his desire, &amp; to be reached after, as be∣longing to the Perfection &amp; Blessedness of his Nature. We read, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5. 44. Of an <HI>Honour that comes from God only,</HI> in opposition to the Honour that comes from Man, so that its a Good that is both Real, &amp; Great, giving true Advancement to the Creature: And therefore, there is an Ambition of Mind after it that is truly Laudable; but as it is aptly Expressed by one,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop <HI>Hall.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nature has dim Eyes &amp; they are misplaced, not thereby discerning where, or in what her Hap∣piness lies, or how to come at it.</HI> And hence it is, that the Attempts of Multitudes are Vain &amp; Fruitless. Men are mistaken in the Object: There are sundry things that are but the Picture, Appearance, or Shadow of true Ho∣nour;
<PB N="9" REF="002017_0010_0FBA85C3A04C47B0"/>
such as <HI>Great</HI> Titles, <HI>Humane</HI> Applause, Place of <HI>Power &amp; Command,</HI> Splendid <HI>Living,</HI> Honourable <HI>Attendance, &amp;c.</HI> Which are usual∣ly mistaken by Men, for the true Object; and in pursuit of these, men do oftentimes strain &amp; tire themselves to no purpose; and if at any time they are Gained, they Advance little, add but little of Lustre to the Enjoyers; after all, Persons having nothing but these to Advance or Adorn them, they are but as a worthless <HI>Ro∣mance</HI> under a <HI>Guilded Cover;</HI> or a very <HI>small Letter</HI> in the midst of a <HI>great Gay;</HI> the Man may notwithstanding all this be very mean &amp; contemptible in the account of true Wisdom. Now, Religion which designs the true Happi∣ness &amp; best Good of Man, makes Discovery of the true Object; tells what <HI>true Honour</HI> is, and wherein it consists; raises up, &amp; helps the Mind of man to Discern it, &amp; prescribes a sure way to Attain it; a way that has been oftentimes tryed &amp; found Effectual; &amp; this is by Vertu∣ous Actions; In short, by Honouring God. Religion does in its own Nature tend to raise up &amp; ennoble the Mind of man, &amp; Adorn it with a greater Lustre &amp; Glory than a Multitude of empty Titles can possibly do; but besides, hereby Persons are entitled to the free &amp; rich Promise of God, who has said, <HI>That he will Ho∣nour them that Honour him.</HI></P>
<P>In Handling of this point I must first of all,
<PB N="10" REF="002017_0011_0FBA85C56B789DC8"/>
Describe the <HI>Work,</HI> and then Discourse of the <HI>Reward.</HI></P>
<P>I. <HI>I shall Attempt to Describe the Work &amp; shew what it is for any to Honour God.</HI></P>
<P>Now in General, this Work consists in such Actions as proceed from, and testify the great thoughts are had of God, &amp; are intended and directed to his Praise.</P>
<P>Its a matter that consists mainly in Action; indeed Speech &amp; the instrument thereof were given to Praise God with, &amp; not to ly Silent; however, there is more in this than only some Verbal Praises; Christ himself has taught us thus, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15. 8 <HI>Herein is my Father Glorifyed that ye bear much Fruit.</HI> And it was by Action that he himself Glorifyed God. <HI>Joh.</HI> 17. 4. <HI>I have Glorifyed thee on earth, I have Finished the Work given me to do.</HI> But then,</P>
<P>Its by such Actions as proceed from, &amp; testi∣fy the great thoughts that are had of God, &amp; are intended, &amp; directed to his Praise. It is not enough to perform such Actions as relate to God, &amp; have been Commanded by him; but they must flow from this Principle, and be di∣rected to this end, otherwise whatever may be the end of the Work, this is not the end of the Workman; &amp; therefore an Act or Work that finds acceptance &amp; applause with Man, may be
<PB N="11" REF="002017_0012_0FBA85C6EB6A0B50"/>
Rejected by God; for tho' Men Honour God with their Lips (or any External Action) yet if their Heart be Removed from him, he ac∣counts himself but Dishonoured in the Ser∣vice, <HI>Isa.</HI> 29. 13.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly right thoughts of God do lay the Foundation of all suitable Carriage to∣wards him; hence that Advice, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 9. <HI>And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, &amp; serve him with a perfect Heart, &amp; a willing Mind.</HI></P>
<P>So long as the Mind is void of the true Knowlege of God, or leavened with unworthy &amp; unbecoming thoughts of him, the Carriage will never be respectful; but such as holds forth Contempt, Thence Sprang the Profane Car∣riage of the Sons of <HI>Eli, they were Sons of Belial, they knew not the Lord, 1 Sam.</HI> 2. 12. But it will be needful to reduce these Actions under some certain Heads, which are these that follow,
<LIST>

<PB N="12" REF="002017_0013_0FBA85CB1C1506A0"/>
such actions as do flow from, &amp; testify the great thoughts had of God, and do tend to his Praise.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Persons Honour God, by acting directly to∣wards him, in a manner becoming his Excellency.</HI> God is ultimately respected in every Holy, or Religious Action; even such Actions as do nextly respect our selves or our Neighbour, have an ultimate regard to God; hence <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 7 <HI>With good Will, doing Service as to the Lord &amp; not to Men:</HI> But there are some Actions that do more directly look towards him; and these are Acts of Worship, Natural or Instituted, where∣in the Soul being withdrawn from other Ob∣jects, turns its self towards the Author of its being; draws near to him &amp; acts towards him, according as its toucht with a Sense of those Various Perfections that shine in him. And then do we Exalt the Lord, when we raise up our Minds to think of him, to get Acquain∣tance with him, to partake of him, &amp; to be filled with him. When we come before him with an Holy awe on our Hearts, we give him the Glory of his Power, Justice, Holiness; <HI>Psal.</HI> 22. 23. When we Humble &amp; Abase our selves in his Presence we Exalt him; when we Confess &amp; Bewail our Sins before him we give Glory to him: <HI>Josh. 7. 19. Give Glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make Confession:</HI> Hence

<HI>Mal. 2. 2. If ye will not lay it to Heart, to give Glory to my Name, I will send a Curse upon you▪</HI> When we give him Thanks for the Mercies we Receive, we Magnify him: Hence <HI>Psal.</HI> 34. 3. <HI>O Magnifie the Lord with me, and let us Exalt his Name together.</HI> And <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. ult. <HI>Whoso offereth Praise, Glorifyeth me.</HI> When we place our Trust in him, &amp; call upon him for good things we want, we give him the Glory of his Alsufficiency, Kindness: Hence <HI>Psal.</HI> 62. 8 <HI>Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a Refuge for us.</HI> When our Hearts go out in Love to him, it declares we account him to be the most Amia∣ble Being, that there is none in the Heavens, or in the Earth that may be compared to him: <HI>Psal.</HI> 73. 25 <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, &amp;c.</HI> In a Word, we Honour God when we attend upon the various parts of instituted Worship in a manner becoming his Excellency, when our outward actions therein, proceed from, &amp; express a truly Religious Disposition of Soul; This is oftentimes called a Glorifying God; <HI>Psal.</HI> 86.9. <HI>All Nations whom thou hast made shall come &amp; Worship before thee, O Lord, &amp; shall Glo∣rify thy Name.</HI> So <HI>Psal.</HI> 96. 8, 9. <HI>Give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his Name: bring an of∣fering, and come into his Courts.

2. <HI>Persons Honour God, by acting suitably to∣wards such Objects as relate to him.</HI> Its a known, &amp; a received Rule, that, that for which, any thing is what it is, is its self much more so. Men usually account, that they themselves are Honoured, when any that relate or belong to them, are Honoured, and Respected for their sakes. Now, there are Objects that do more peculiarly relate to God; and when they are treated in a Respectful manner, for Gods sake, it argues the great thoughts that are had of God, &amp; God is pleased to take it as an Honour done to himself. There are persons that come under this relative consideration: And here it becomes us first of all to consider Him, who in all things has the Preeminence, and is both related to, &amp; one with God; even Jesus Christ; who is the Messenger of the Covenant, the Chief Apostle of our Profession; both the Head of the Church, &amp; the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: God expects that his Son should be Reverenced, yea that all men should <HI>Honour the Son, even as they Honour the Father, Joh.</HI> 5 23. And Christ is Honoured when he is Acknow∣leged &amp; Received as the Son of God, when his Testimony is Believed, his Religion is Em∣braced, his Mediation Relyed on, &amp; he is Be∣trusted with the Affairs of the Soul; And Ho∣nour is done to God the Father, when Christ is Honoured: Hence <HI>Joh.</HI> 12. 44. <HI>He that Be∣lieveth
<PB N="15" REF="002017_0016_0FBA85D024123CD8"/>
on me, Believeth no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n me, but on him that sent me.</HI> But then the Civil Magistrate comes under this Relative consideration; for he is the Deputy of the Supreme Ruler of the World, whom God has appointed to Repre∣sent him, &amp; Act for him here below; to which end, he has given him his own Name, put a Ray of his own Glory upon him. Imprinted some Characters of Divinity on him; <HI>Dan. 5. 18, 19. The most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy Father a Kingdom, &amp; Majesty, &amp; Glory, and Honour. And for the Majesty that he gave him, all People, Nations, and Languages Trembled and Feared before him.</HI> God expects they should be Honoured under this Notion; and hence the Duty we owe to our Soveraign in Heaven, and to his Deputy here on Earth are both Joyned together. 1 <HI>Pet. 2. 17. Fear God, Honour the King.</HI> God himself is Honoured, when these are duely Honoured; and he resents it as a Dishonour done to himself, when those that Represent him in the world are Despised; 1 <HI>Sam. 8. 7. They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign o∣ver them.</HI> And hence was it taken so ill in those that despised <HI>Saul,</HI> seeing God had ap∣pointed him to Rule over his People, 1 <HI>Sam. 10. ult.</HI> Again, There are those that Mi∣nister in Sacred things, that come under consideration; they are the Messengers of the
<PB N="16" REF="002017_0017_0FBA85D2B84716D8"/>
Lord of Hosts, Ambassadors that represent the great King; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 20. And it is required that they be respected on this account. 1 <HI>Cor. 4. 1. Let a man account of us, as of the Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the Mysteries of God.</HI> Honour or Dishonour done to them is taken as tho' it were done to him whom they Re∣present; <HI>Luk. 10.16. He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that despiseth you, despiseth me: and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.</HI></P>
<P>But this consideration extends it self yet further, not only to the true Church of God, but to every Pious Member thereof; &amp; there∣fore a due Respect yielded thereto under this notion, is an Honour done to God. He that Honours such as fear God, Honours God him∣self <HI>Psal.</HI> 15. 4. Hence that of Christ, <HI>Mat. 25.40▪ In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI></P>
<P>But then there are things as well as persons that relate to God; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> His <HI>Word,</HI> His <HI>Works,</HI> His <HI>Ordinances,</HI> His <HI>Day,</HI> His <HI>House:</HI> Now God is Honoured when there is a reverend regard to, &amp; a Holy use made of these. See in par∣ticular, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58. 13. Hence God complains of dishonour done to him by his Peoples profa∣ning his holy things, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 22. 26.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Persons Honour God, by acting in a full and perfect Subjection to him;</HI> which includes both, an Obedience to his Laws, &amp; a due Submissi∣on
<PB N="17" REF="002017_0018_0FBA85D3D1201FF0"/>
to his Corrective Dispensations. Man in his very Make and Constitution is fitted for a Moral Government: It can Appertain to none but the Author of his Being, to Exercise it over him: From Creation arises absolute Pro∣priety, and full right of Government, and God does really exercise the same: <HI>The most High does Rule among the Children of Men. Dan.</HI> 4. 17. He is the Governour among the Nations: He sits King for ever; and his Kingdom Rules over all. He that dispenses some portions of Power to others, holds the Governments of the World, (yea of both Worlds) in his own Hands. He actually gives Laws to his Crea∣tures to Live by; Laws that are most Righte∣ous &amp; most Extensive, that reach every per∣son, &amp; direct how to carry it towards every Object: <HI>Mic. 6. 8. He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, &amp;c.</HI> And he also upholds a Discipline in his Family: Indeed God does not willingly Afflict or Grieve the Children of Men, yet for Wise, &amp; Holy ends, He orders a variety of Evils to Men in a Corrective way: He does not only Chastize the Heathen, but he Chasteneth his own Covenant People; <HI>Deut. 8. 5.

The Law &amp; the Rod, were for a while together, in the Ark of the Covenant, and they will never be Separate in Gods Government of his Family; we read of Gods <HI>Fire in Zion,</HI> &amp; <HI>Furnace in Je∣rusalem. Isa</HI> 31. 9. Now God is Honoured both by an Obedience to the one, and a quiet Sub∣mission to the other. God is Honoured by an Obedience to his Laws; Sinners by break∣ing the Divine Law Dishonour God; <HI>Rom.</HI>2.23. By breaking of Gods Law Sinners cast a slight on him, they deny his Sovereignty, they under∣value his Favour, they slight &amp; contemn his Power; hence <HI>Psal. 10. 13. Wherefore doth tho Wicked contemn God?</HI> But by an Obedience to Gods Law, God is Honoured. Sacrificing to God is called an Honouring God, <HI>Isa. 43 23. Thou hast not Honoured me, with thy Sacrifices;</HI> But Obedience is much more so, 1 <HI>Sam. 15. 22. Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings &amp; sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? To obey is better then sacrifice; &amp; to hearken, than the fat of rams.</HI> Hence are we directed to Pray, <HI>Thy will be done; Mat. 6. 10.</HI> That Gods Name may be Hallowed, and his Kingdom come. And the Obedience by which, God is Ho∣noured, is a Universal Obedience; by such Obedience did <HI>Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David,</HI> &amp; others endeavour to Honour and Glorify
<PB N="19" REF="002017_0020_0FBA85DA83BE2910"/>
God, <HI>Act.</HI> 13. 22. Again God is Honoured by that Obedience which is both Sincere &amp; also Cheerful, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 9. This gives God the Glory of his Omnisciency, Truth, Bounty. Again a resolved Obedience Honours God; when Persons refuse to be allured, or affright∣ed from the way of Duty; instances of such Obedience might be taken notice of in <HI>Joseph,</HI> in the three Children, <HI>Dan.</HI> 3. 16, 17. and the Apostles, <HI>Act.</HI> 5. 29. But then a Submission to God's Hand and a Compliance with his Provi∣dence, gives Honour &amp; Glory to him. When the Evils God is pleased to order to any in the way of his Providence, are quietly &amp; pa∣tiently born, it gives God the Glory of his So∣vereignty, Wisdom, Justice, Goodness; thus did <HI>Aaron, David, Hezekiah,</HI> and above all, CHRIST himself glorify God: <HI>Luk. 22. 42. Not my will, but thine be done. Joh. 18. 11. The cup which my Father hath given me to drink, shall I not drink it?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Persons honour God by endeavouring to the utmost to Act like him.</HI> Imitation is usually a fruit of Esteem; and gives evidence thereof. The Nature of Man is very Prone to be led by Example, &amp; especially by the Example of Su∣periours that are Honoured &amp; Esteemed: When once a person has taken up an high Esteem of another, he is unaccountably carry∣ed away unto an Imitation of the person Ad∣mired:
<PB N="20" REF="002017_0021_0FBA85DBF288E7A8"/>
And the force hereof is sometimes so great as to carry away a person unto an Imi∣tation of him in such things as are the Defects &amp; blemishes of the person Admired, and the Irregularities of his Actions; and herein is Honour done to the person; such a Confor∣mity to another testifies that he is had in Ad∣miration. Now God is the Supreme &amp; Ever∣lasting <HI>Standard</HI> of Perfection: his Nature is a Pattern for ours, and his Actions which are known in the Earth are for our Example. It was Mans primitive Glory, that he was made like to God, and it must be his brightest Per∣fection &amp; Glory to be &amp; act like him The works &amp; actions of God are all done in Truth; He ever proceeds by the Rules of Wisdom, Justice, Goodness in all his doings Now such is the Nature of Man, that he is capable of some imitation of him, &amp; hereunto is obliged; <HI>Eph 5. 1. Be ye followers of God, as dear children.</HI> God is to be imitated in Purity and Holiness; <HI>Lev.</HI> 19. 2. He is to be imitated in hatred of Sin, in Justice, Truth, Faithfulness, Goodness, &amp; Kindness, in slowness to Anger, in readiness to Forgive, &amp; to be Reconciled, in readiness to Believe &amp; Help the Miserable. <HI>Mat.</HI>5. ult. <HI>Be ye Perfect.</HI> And when we endeavour to the utmost to conform our selves to the ex∣ample of God himself in our doings, it declares we have great thoughts of God; that our
<PB N="21" REF="002017_0022_0FBA85E0B9628188"/>
Hearts are truly touched with a Sense of his Perfections; It shows we Believe there is none in the Heavens or the Earth that may be likened unto him; nor any Works, like unto his Works, <HI>Psal.</HI> 86 8.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Persons Honour God, by a lively, and a vigourous acting for him in the World</HI> God does not require man to spend all his time in acts of Devotion; nor allow him to spend the rest of his time in Idleness; much less, in fol∣lowing the Desires and Devices of his own Heart, which lead from God &amp; true Happiness, &amp; into Confusion &amp; Misery: But God having made Man for himself, and capable of acting for an end, has appointed him work, &amp; di∣rected him what to have ever in his View, which lies in each ones faithful serving of his Generation, by doing all the good he can in the World▪ for we are to consider, not only the needy miserable &amp; hazardous State of each man, but his Relation to a world of Crea∣tures, in the like ill case, oppressed with Mi∣series, corrupted with ill Manners, set very far off from the End of their being Man is born a Member of some <HI>Society, Family, City, &amp;c</HI> and there are a multitude of Offices of love and kindness to be done for our fellow Creatures, both for their Souls, and also for their Out∣ward welfare, which being done with rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to God's Command, &amp; with a design to glo∣rify

Him, God is pleased to take as done for him; for such is the bounty of God that he does not only acknowledge those actions to be a serving of him, which look nextly at his Glory, but those also, which look this way but remotely, or in consequence. There are a multitude of Necessities that attend man∣kind, for which, the Provision made is by the Ministry of men and therefore is God pleased to bestow on men a very great va∣riety of Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts &amp; Talents, that they may be the better enabled to be useful in the World, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.7 Such as <HI>Knowledge, Wisdom, Skill, Authority, Wealth, Valour, &amp;c.</HI> Now when Persons in their several Stations improve their Talents in a faithful discharge of the Duties of their respective Places, God is honoured: 1 <HI>Pet. 4 11. If any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ.</HI> And now</P>
<P>II. It follows <HI>to Discourse of the Reward pro∣mised to them that Honour God:</HI> which is HONOUR: <HI>Them that honour Me, I will Honour.</HI> A Reward that is very great and no less sure. The Promise of God secures it to all such; which Promise we find many times made; <HI>Psal. 1 12.9. His horn shall be exalted with honour. Prov. 4. 8. Exalt her, and she shall pro∣mote thee; she shall being thee to honour, when thou

dost embrace her. Rom. 2. 10. Glory, honour, &amp; peace to every one that worketh good.</HI> And Christ himself has brought us his Father's Promise, <HI>Joh 12 26. If any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</HI> And what greater Security can be had or desired, than the Promise of God? For <HI>the Strength of Israel will not lie.</HI> And God's own Practice has ever been agreable hereunto; Should we look over the whole History of God's dealings, we might observe a very remarkable Agreement with this Pro∣mise, in a multitude of instances, both before, and after this Promise was made▪ especially we might take notice of it in <HI>Joseph, Moses, David, Mordecai, Daniel,</HI> who in a way of ho∣nouring God by Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuous Actions were raised up to an Excellency of dignity and honour.</P>
<P>And indeed no instance can be brought to the contrary; we may challenge all Ages to being an instance of any one who eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> try'd this wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and yet miss'd of this e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d?

<PB N="24" REF="002017_0025_0FBA85E5A2DAD618"/>
they were hated and despised of men, they were dear to God; and while they were out∣wardly-Vile, by hateful aspersions they were still inwardly glorious, having the Spirit of God &amp; of Glory resting on them. And tho' they had not their full Reward given while at work, it follows not but that they have it now, and shall be for ever the more bright &amp; glo∣rious, in proportion to the shame and disgrace endured in the world; for indeed these Evils do work for Persons a far more exceeding &amp; eternal weight of Glory, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 17. So that the Reward is not only great, but most sure</P>
<P>Quest <HI>But what Honour shall be done to these Persons, and when shall it be bestowed?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I shall give answer to both in one.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Such as honour God shall have Honour bestowed on them here in this World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Such as honour God shall have Honour bestowed on them after this Life is ended.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Those that honour God shall have Honour be∣stowed on them here in this Life.</HI> An Object appears greater, or less as its nearer to, or fur∣ther distant from the Eye: And so is it with a good propounded to the Mind; tho' the good propounded, be very great, yet if at a vast distance, it appears but small, &amp; affects but little; whereas, if it be near, it appears the greater &amp; moves the more forcibly. It is a speedy and undelayed enjoyment of a good▪
<PB N="25" REF="002017_0026_0FBA85E988C8F278"/>
Prized, that men would have, &amp; the hope here∣of excites much▪ Men that are enquiring after Honour, would gladly become glorious with∣out delay; and are disposed to listen after a speedy way of becoming so: Now the way of vertue propounded tends to Honour here; God is wont to bestow Honour on such, even here in this Life. Indeed, it is oftentimes made good in a very Remarkable manner.</P>
<P>(1) <HI>Sometimes God Honours such as Honour him by Defending, or Delivering them from the foul Aspersions cast on them in the World.</HI> It is not the purest Innocency, nor the greatest worth, nor most extensive usefulness that will always secure men from Contumelies and Reproaches. Envy as a dark shadow, attends the Body of Honour, hatred, Goodness, &amp; ill Requitals, the most kind &amp; beneficial Services. It is not rare that persons who have deserved best of their fellow Creatures do meet with the worst treat∣ment from them. There is in the Mouth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Wicked a Rod of Pride, which he uses In∣dustriously to Scourge and Defile Men of the rightest Merit. Now God does sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efend his faithful Servants from their Mouth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Hand of the mighty. <HI>Job 5. 13. The Services of the Crafty are disappointed, &amp; the counsel the Froward is turned headlong.</HI> The en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enom'd Arrows that fly in the Dark, make Wounds: their Names are so Oyl'd that
<PB N="26" REF="002017_0027_0FBA85EE0415EDD0"/>
the filth that is spit at them does not stick. But suppose, Enemies are suffered to prevail by Iniquity, so that their Brightness is Ob∣scured, &amp; their Horn is defiled in the dust, God does sometimes appear very Wonderfully in pleading their cause, in rolling off Reproach from them, and cloathing their Enemies with Shame. He brings forth their Judgment as the light, &amp; their Righteousness as the noon day; He turns the shadow of Death unto them, into the Morning. Thus God dealt with <HI>Jo∣seph, David, Daniel,</HI> and others; And it agrees with what he has said, <HI>Psal.91 15. I will deliver him &amp; honour him.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) <HI>God Honours them that Honour him, by giv∣ing them Favour and Respect in the Eyes of Men.</HI> Favour &amp; Respect amongst Men is prized and hunted after by many as the greatest good in the World. <HI>Saul</HI> was very fond to have Honour before the Elders of the People: 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15. 30. And Christ speaks of some, that loved the praise of men more than the praise of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 12. 43. However tho' it be over∣valued by the most, it is not to be undervalued by any. A wise mans greatest care is to be wor∣thy of account &amp; esteem; &amp; had much rather be so, than only be so accounted of. A wise man values his own stock of sufficiency &amp; real worth, beyound the highest Applauses in the World: Yet notwithstanding a just esteem
<PB N="27" REF="002017_0028_0FBA85EF64CD0540"/>
when yielded, is not to be slighted: Its Pro∣mised by God, as an encouragement unto Ver∣tue, &amp; bestowed as a reward thereof: <HI>Prov.3.4. So shalt thou find favour.</HI> And the wise man has observed, that he that seeks good pro∣cures favour, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11. 27. God has the hearts of all men in his hands, and he inclines and turns them as he pleases; and many times▪ do's cause his faithful Servants to find Respect.</P>
<P>And that,</P>
<P>Both with Superiors and Inferiors. A Princes Favour is a thing highly valued; many will intreat it; and indeed it is as the Dew, <HI>Prov.</HI> 19. 12. And its very observable, how oftentimes holy and righteous Persons▪ have in a way of Serving and Honouring God been advanced unto it: Their Heavenly wisdom, &amp; God-like goodness has made their faces to shine, and brought them into the Pre∣sence of great men. So was it with <HI>Joseph, Mordecai, Daniel,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>And this procures Reverence &amp; Esteem in the minds of Inferiors; and that not only of the good and vertuous, but the evil. As for the Righteous, among them Piety &amp; Holiness is in account: <HI>Prov.</HI> 14. 9. Their very temper disposes them to honour such as fear God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 15. 4. And altho' there may be some others that are Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> that despise, Yet of such as these they will be had in Honour, 2. <HI>Sam</HI> 6. 22
<PB N="28" REF="002017_0029_0FBA85F0E4F25020"/>
But besides this, there is sometimes a Testi∣mony enforc'd from the Consciences of the worst men, in the Commendation of the Ver∣tuous; which is (as one says well) Equiva∣lent to an Universal good Report.</P>
<P>(3) <HI>God Honours such as honour him with his own Favour.</HI> It is a very great Honour to be a Favourite of God. The favour of an earth∣ly Prince is accounted a great Honour. Men usually Value themselves by it; and its the measure &amp; rule of Valuation &amp; Esteem to o∣thers He that is high in the favour of his Prince may hope for defence and protection from his Enemies; he has an advantage in his hand to procure good things for himself and others; indeed in the light of the Kings Coun∣tenance is Life, and his favour is as the latter rain, <HI>Prov</HI> 16. 15. But the Favour of the KING of Kings is by far a greater honour to any one. When the Beams of the Sun are darted directly on an Object, it makes it ap∣pear bright; and the favour of God and the light of his Countenance towards any one, does add a true lustre; it argues a real worth, it affords a true refreshment to the Soul; it recommends any one to the respect of the World, it sets on high, and makes a mans mountain to stand strong. Now <HI>this honour have all his Saints.</HI> It was not only the privi∣ledge of <HI>Joseph, David, Daniel, &amp;c.</HI> that they
<PB N="29" REF="002017_0030_0FBA85F2A9429388"/>
were favourites of Heaven, but the Counte∣nance of the King of Kings is towards every wise Servant. All his Saints are in his hand, he loveth the Righteous, &amp; his Countenance doth behold the Upright, <HI>Psal.</HI> 11 7. And their being dear to God and precious in his sight, makes them Honourable, <HI>Isa</HI> 43. 4. In his favour is their horn Exalted, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89. 17.</P>
<P>(4) <HI>God honours those that Honour him with his own gracious Presence.</HI> Indeed God is not very far from any of his Creatures. <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 27 God is every where Present by his All-com∣prehending Essence, He fills Heaven and Earth with his Presence: He is every where present by his Power, Upholding, Guiding &amp; Gover∣ning all his Creatures. He is present in holy Places, by his Grace &amp; Blessing, He is present in the Consciences of good and bad, by way of Testimony &amp; Judgment. But he is especially Present with the Vertuous by Manifestation &amp; peculiar Influence. God is nigh unto all them that call upon him in truth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 145. 18 Persons of greatest Eminency and richest Ac∣complishments have usually low and mean thoughts of themselves; and ready to plead unfitness &amp; insufficiency, when it pleases God to call them forth to improvement; They have a sense of the greatness of the Work, the difficulty and opposition, that attends it, and their own inability to grapple therewith, un∣less
<PB N="30" REF="002017_0031_0FBA85F6B75A1EC8"/>
they were furnished with a greater stock of Wisdom, Courage, Strength, than they find themselves to have; and hence, are wont to raise Pleas from those Heads that they may be excused: As may be seen in <HI>Moses,</HI> and in <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> Now to silence and remove these Objections, and free the heart from Discou∣ragement, GOD is Pleased to make the Pro∣mise of his own Gracious Presence with his Servants in the Work he Calls them to. So did he to <HI>Moses, Joshua, David, &amp;c.</HI> And indeed not to them only, but to Us in them: For what God said to <HI>Joshua,</HI> He says to every true and faithful Servant of his, <HI>Deut. 31. 8. Heb 13.5. I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</HI> Which Promise, as it contains in it all the good we want in the way of Duty, so it is cer∣tainly made good; His Promise doth not ever fail. GOD was present with <HI>Moses, Joshua, Da∣vid,</HI> &amp; others, as he Promised; &amp; so He ever is, and will be Present with his faithful Servants to the end of the World. And this is an Honour, &amp; indeed such an honour as Earthly Princes cannot possibly bestow upon all their faithful Servants, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19. 6. <HI>Zec.</HI> 8. 23.</P>
<P>(5) Lastly, <HI>God Honours those that honour him by making them Instruments of great good in the world.</HI> Usefulness in the world is a mans great Glory; &amp; is wont to procure for a man Repute &amp; Esteem: 2 <HI>King.</HI> 5. 1. <HI>He was an Ho∣nourable
<PB N="31" REF="002017_0032_0FBA85F9E08A23A0"/>
man, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria.</HI> It argues a mean, base, unworthy Spirit, in a man, to have a regard only to his own Private Interest, to make himself the Centre of his own actions; and to be careless about the good of others. He de∣serves to be neglected, that lives and does no good in the world: Such an one wasts and squanders away all the Talents given him to improve. He lives besides the End of his Be∣ing; is sunk below the Nature of Man; and does but only fill up the number of things in the World. But usefulness makes a man Ho∣nourable: It makes a man like to Christ, who was ever Employ'd in doing good, <HI>Act. 10. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8</HI> On this account was <HI>Jehoiada</HI> so greatly respected, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24. 16.—<HI>Because he had done good in Israel, both towards God, &amp; towards his House.</HI> And it was this that Procured such Esteem &amp; Reverence to <HI>Job,</HI> which was very great, both from old &amp; young, the greatest &amp; most honourable, as well as others. He gives this account of it, <HI>when the ear heard me then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me it gave wit∣ness to me: Because I delivered the poor that cried, &amp; the fatherless, and him that had no helper. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame: I was a father to the poor; and the cause I knew not I searched, Job 29. 11,</HI>—He endeavoured by his Wisdom, Wealth, Authority, to do all
<PB N="32" REF="002017_0033_0FBA85FAB099F0B8"/>
the good he could. Now it is of GOD, that any are such Blessings, and Instruments of so much good in the world. It is He that be∣stows on men gifts of Wisdom, Knowledge, Wealth, Valour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is He that gives that Divine temper of Soul that disposes men to lay out themselves, in Endeavours to do good: And it is He, that gives unto men Opportu∣nity, and by his Blessing renders Endeavours successful; For except the Lord build the City, they labour in vain that build it, <HI>Psal.</HI> 127. 1 And in this way does God many times Honour such as honour him: So he did <HI>Joseph, Joshua, Nehemiah, Jehoiada,</HI> &amp;c. On the ac∣count of which, after Generations will call them blessed. But</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such as honour God here, shall have Honour be∣stowed on them after this Life is ended.</HI> Persons of greatest Eminency &amp; Usefulness, must yield to Death as well as others.

of death,—Which brings men down from their Places of Dignity and Employment, breaks off their Purposes: In that very day their thoughts perish. Yet Death does not put an end to the Honour of the Vertuous. Indeed the Pomp and Glory of sinful Men, which they have gotten without Goodness, &amp; endeavoured to maintain without Vertue, usually comes to an end at Death; Their glo∣rious Beauty becomes like a fading Flower; it, passes away as a Dream: Their Mountain falling cometh to nought. But the Honour of the Vertuous reaches beyond Death &amp; the Grave.</P>
<P>And here I might take notice of the Ho∣nour that shall be done to their Spirits, Names, Bodies, whole Persons,—</P>
<P>(1) <HI>Honour shall be done to the Spirits of the Vertuous after Death:</HI> For when the close Uni∣on between Soul &amp; Body is dissolved, the Spirit which is yielded up to the care of its mighty &amp; faithful Redeemer, is safely Conveyed and Conducted to a place of rest, &amp; united to that Heavenly Assembly, of the Spirits of Just Men made Perfect. It is said of the Wicked; <HI>Joh 27. 19. He shall ly down, but he shall not be ga∣thered;</HI> Which is but rarely true of his Body's not being gathered into the Grave by Burial, but ever true of his Soul, which is not gather∣ed to a place of Peace. But the Soul of the
<PB N="34" REF="002017_0035_0FBA85FDEB55D770"/>
Vertuous man is at Death gather'd to a state &amp; place of Peace &amp; Refreshment We find frequent mention made, of good mens being gathered to their Fathers at Death, so is it said of <HI>A∣braham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Jo∣siah, &amp;c</HI> And it is thought, the Phrase intends, their Spirits being gathered to a place of rest &amp; refreshment, and their being united to the great Assembly of Happy Souls in their Sepa∣rate state However that be, we have a very clear Text for it; <HI>Luk.</HI> 16 22. Where we are told, that <HI>when the Beggar Dyed, he was Carryed by Angels into Abrahams Bosom.</HI> Which points out to us the safe and comfortable state he was put into, &amp; the honourable Company he was United with. And indeed, it will be a very great Honour to be of that number, to be admitted a Member of that bright Assem∣bly of Holy Prophets &amp; Apostles, to sit down with <HI>Abraham, Isaac &amp; Jacob</HI> in the Kingdom of God, a place perfectly free from all Sin &amp; Sorrow: a place that has no need of the Sun, nor the Moon to shine upon it, for the Glory of God does lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</P>
<P>(2) <HI>Honour shall be done to the Names of the Vertuous:</HI> Which lies not in some bitter La∣mentations at their Death, or in many Tears dropt over their Graves; tho' indeed, these are Evidences of Love &amp; Esteem, and an Ho∣nour

done to the Dead. So were the La∣mentations of <HI>David,</HI> at the Death of <HI>Saul</HI> &amp; <HI>Jonathan.</HI> It certainly intended shame &amp; dis∣grace to <HI>Jeh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iakim,</HI> when God Threatned him that he should Dy Unlamented. <HI>Jer.</HI> 22. 28. <HI>They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah Lord, or ah his Glory.</HI> His Death should be but like the breaking of a worthless Vessel, wherein was no Pleasure. And it is certainly spoken of, as an Honour done to others, that they dyed much Lamented: 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 35. 24. <HI>And all Judah &amp; Je∣rusalem mourned for Josiah, &amp;c.</HI> But besides Ho∣nour of this nature done them at their Death, their names shall be Perpetuated.

<P>Hence, 1. <HI>This Truth serves to teach us, that God has a Perfect Knowledge; yea, that he takes an Exact Notice of all the Doings of the Children of men.</HI> Surely if so, He is a God of Knowlege, &amp; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Him Actions are weighed, 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 3.

<PB N="38" REF="002017_0039_0FBA8608CA261560"/>
impossible the eye of an Earthly Ruler should be on all the Servants of his numerous Family, appointed to several wayes and about differ∣ing employments: much less can he discern clearly, the particular Views of every one. But all things are naked, &amp; open before that God, with whom we have to do. He know∣eth the secrets of the Hearts, sees clearly the most hidden springs of action, &amp; unto what end they are directed, and intended. His Just proportioning of his dealings to mens carriage declares that he Searches the Heart and tryes the Reins, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 23. And the maintaining of a lively and constant sense hereof would be of very great use through the whole course of a mans life. And hence do we find this consideration used as an ar∣gument to engage the heart in being sincere &amp; cheerful in the service of God. 1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 9. <HI>For the Lord searcheth all Hearts, &amp; un∣derstandeth all the Imaginations of the thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>Hence. 2. <HI>This wonderful bounty of God does hold out great encouragement unto men to endea∣vour to the utmost, to honour and glorify God.</HI> It is indeed wonderful bounty in God to re∣ward those that honour him in such a man∣ner▪ It is a very great honour to be Em∣ployed for God and very strange it should be recompensed with so ample a Reward. Its by Gifts, Talents, and a right temper of
<PB N="39" REF="002017_0040_0FBA860A0730F140"/>
Soul received from God, that any are ena∣bled to Honour Him; and it argues strange Bounty in God, thus to Honour his own Gifts. The Services done by any, bear no proportion with the Reward. Our best Ser∣vices are weak, and very imperfect; but the reward is great and weighty. Our Services are very short; but the Crown of glory given in reward, is everlasting, and never fading, 1. <HI>Pet.</HI>5. 4. So that it's an act of Royal Bounty. And we have much greater reason than he had, to Express ourselves as he did, 2 <HI>Sam. 19. 36—And why should the King recompence it with such a reward?</HI> Surely its not after the man∣ner of man. And it holds, out abundant en∣couragement to any to serve God, &amp; to lay out themselves to the utmost in endeavours to honour him. Here is enough to make a∣mends for all the difficulties any have to en∣counter in the way of their duty. Here is enough to bear up the Heart, in the midst of any sufferings that befal them, and for the longest time spent in the service of God; or greatest good done by any Services. Surely <HI>Moses</HI> thought so, <HI>Heb. 11. 26.—For he had a respect to the recompence of reward.</HI> And was not Christ himself moved by the Joy that was set before him? <HI>Heb.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 2.</P>
<P>Hence, 3. <HI>This Truth is of use to guide in the Choice of Persons to Places of Publick Improvement.</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="002017_0041_0FBA860B413887D0"/>
Persons of Publick Improvement, have great advantages in their Hands to Honour God: Indeed there is no person but may do some∣what this way, let his Station be never so low, his Talents few, his Abilities small, he may notwithstanding Contribute somewhat. He that could not bring Gold, or Silver, or Preci∣ous Stones, towards Building of the Tabernacle, might bring Goats Hair, Badger Skins of Shit∣tim Wood, and find a ready Acceptance: So here. However persons that stand in places of Publick Trust may do more; they have more Talents, and better Opportunities to Honour God than others: And indeed, God expects more from them. Now the Choice of Men to such Publick Places does (among us) lie with the People; and its a Priviledge. It may be not Universally accounted so: A Priviledge we are not enough Thankful for: A Priviledge that is horribly abused by too many among us. And yet, do we show a lothness to part with it, when we are under Threatnings of being Deprived. Now this truth teaches us how to improve this Priviledge, so as that we may feel the Benefit thereof: and this is in looking out for, &amp; in the choice of, such men for Improvement as are likely to Honour God. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Religious Spirit; Men of a Divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Soul.

reached; and the best Interests of a People are like to be Secured and Advanced. Honour is not seemly for a Fool; Nay its a sore Evil that Folly is at any time set in great Dignity. Tho' persons have various other needful Qua∣lifications, yet if they are void of Piety and of the true Fear of God, they are miserably unfit. Tho' persons are Honourably Descended, have had a Liberal Education, are persons of Know∣ledge, Wealth, Courage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet if they are persons of vicious Lives, of selfish Spirits, of unsanctified Hearts, the true ends of their Ad∣vancement are not likely to be reach'd. What can be look'd for when Vile men are Exalted? &amp; such as work Wickedness are set up? Surely then God's Honour will be neglected, if not the betraying of His Interest into the hands of its Enemies. Religion must needs be in a very unsafe State when those that are not its Friends have the Care of it Therefore should those be looked for that are men fear∣ing God, <HI>&amp;c.

<P>Hence, 4. <HI>This Truth serves to teach us how God will deal with them that Neglect &amp; Dishonour Him:</HI> Nay it is expressed in the very next words, <HI>They shall be lightly Esteemed.</HI> If Ho∣nour be the reward of Vertue; then Shame &amp; Disgrace shall be the punishment of Vice &amp;

Is it the Spirit of GOD? or the Spirit that is in the World? Are we herein Zealous for the Lord of Hosts, or have we not some Private Views? Do not our Contentions proceed from the common Causes of Strife,&amp; argue that we are Carnal?</P>
<P>Is it not sad, there should be Contentions among Us, who are the Messengers&amp;Preachers of Peace,&amp;should above all men, be the keepers and practisers thereof? How shall we be able to Preach against Strife&amp;Contention in others, while we our selves practice it? <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 1.</P>

<P><HI>Let us Honour God by Improving our Talents, &amp; by a Faithful Discharge of the Duties of our respective Places. 1 Pet. 4. 11. That God in all things may be Glorified.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let us Honour God, by giving due Honour to those whom God has raised on high, and himself put Honour upon. Rom.</HI> 13. 7. Let us consider their Relation unto God, and entertain a high and reverend Esteem of them on that account.
