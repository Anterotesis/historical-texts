<BIBL>PSALM xxxiv. 1st. Verse.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I will bless the</HI> LORD <HI>at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE present state is a mixed state. This is so as to individuals, and also to communities. In the course of God's providence, prosperity and adversity suc∣ceed eath other; and there is oftentimes a quick transition from one to the other. It is in this case as it is in the course of nature: When all is bright, serene and chear∣ful, a storm suddenly arises, and rages with great impetuo∣sity and violence, and in some situations great is the dis∣tress and misery occasioned thereby. After which all be∣comes calm and bright again. Neither individuals nor communities "in their prosperity may say, they shall never be moved." When they imagine their "mountain stands strong," it is easy with God to shake it even to its centre; to throw them down from the pinnacle of ease, grandeur, wealth and affluence—and it is easy for him
<PB N="6" REF="014830_0004_0F9789FB9A209D28"/>
again to exalt them.—To be raised from a low, de∣pressed state, is agreeable to nature. Mankind naturally desire prosperity, and deprecate adversity. Adversity, es∣pecially in remarkable instances of it, spreads a gloom over them, and they are ready to despond and give up all for lost. They view the dark side of things, and dwell upon them in their mournful contemplations, not consi∣dering that the great Governor of the world can cause light to spring up out of darkness, reverse the scene, and bring good out of evil. They are apt to forget past mer∣cies, and to overlook those which God intermixes with their adversities, and so are unapt and indisposed to make their proper acknowledgments to him.</P>
<P>THERE are two grand and important duties, which, both reason and the word of God call men to, consider∣ing him as the great orderer and disposer of all events both good and evil—<HI>Prayer,</HI> for the bestowment of needed good—and <HI>praise</HI> for the receipt of it. Considering ourselves as needy creatures, the duty of prayer is of continual obli∣gation. And considering ourselves as the daily subjects of the mercies of God, the duty of praise is also of conti∣nual obligation. It was from an impresive sense of this, that the pious Psalmist utters himself, as in the words of our text. "I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall be <HI>continually</HI> in my mouth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>THRO all the changing scenes of life,</L>
<L>in trouble and in joy,</L>
<L>The praises of my God shall still</L>
<L>my heart and tongue employ.</L>
</LG>
<BIBL>TATE and BRADY'S version of the text.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014830_0005_0F9789FCDCD69180"/>
THE words plainly import this—That God's crea∣tures, at all times, and under all circumstances and con∣ditions of life, have occasion to praise and bless him.</P>
<P>NONE surely will call it in question, that they have such occasion in times of prosperity; when the aspects of divine providence are agreeable and pleasant. Men must be lost to all sense of God, and of their obligations to him, not to acknowledge that praise is a just tribute due to him on account of his favours and benefits. There are few indeed that will carry matters to such a length as this, speculatively, whatever they may do practically. That they do so practically, is the case in a multitude of in∣stances. Though they are the subjects of many and great favours at the hands of God, yet they have no grateful sense of them, and are grossly negligent in making their acknowledgements to him. Their own reason, if they only appeal to that, must utterly condemn them for such unworthy treatment of their Maker and bounteous Bene∣factor.</P>
<P>It may be made evident, that in times of evil and ca∣lamity, men have <HI>even</HI> then occasion to praise God. Surely then they have so, when it is clear, bright sun∣shine with them. "I will bless the Lord at all times, says David, his praise shall be continually in my mouth."</P>
<P>EVILS and calamities, it is true, in themselves, whether personal or publick, "are not joyous, but grievous." Thus it is as to bodily sickness and pain. Thus also is
<PB N="8" REF="014830_0006_0F9789FD34E35E20"/>
it, when droughts and pestilences are sent into a land, and when their peace and tranquility is interrupted by the sword of war.—Such calamities as these, undoubtedly call for deep humiliation before God, as hereby he testifies his anger and displeasure against a land for the many and heinous iniquities that abound in it. These most cer∣tainly, are the procuring cause of them. If piety and vir∣tue universally prevailed, no evils or judgments would be sent upon a land. The moral state of a people, we may well suppose, influences the moral Governor of the world in his conduct towards them, either in a way of favour or calamity.</P>
<P>BUT although judgments, such as we just mentioned, are to be considered as tokens of God's anger against pre∣vailing iniquities, and in this view call for deep humilia∣tion before a holy and offended Sovereign, yet consistent with this, occasion is then offered for praise.—For "God, who does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men," who delights not in their distresses and miseries, has merciful designs towards them in his judi∣cial dispensations. He designs to humble them and pu∣rify them; to bring them to true repentance, to reform all their vices and immoralities, to reduce them to the love and practice of universal piety, godliness and righte∣ousuess, and in this way to prepare them for his smiles and blessings in all regards. For "righteousness" has a moral as well as natural tendency to "exalt a nation" or people. If now, such are the merciful designs of the
<PB N="9" REF="014830_0007_0F978A001FD788F8"/>
great Governor of the world, when he sends evils and calamities upon a land, then occasion is hereby ministred for praise to his great name.</P>
<P>THE design of Heaven in calamitous dispensations, may be to bring people to that, which his kind and merciful ones have been ineffectual to. For although the merciful dispensations of GOD, especially a long series of them, and in great and most important respects, ought in all reason to engage men's unfeigned gratitude, and put them upon manifesting it in a life of true godliness and virtue, yet frequently they have not such a desireable effect as this.—Their case is often, much as it is said of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that they "wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fat and kick." While they talk of a long season in the sun-shine of the divine favours, they are unmindful of their great benefactor, riot in his bounties and make them the fewel of their lusts. Thus evilly do they requite the Lord who has done so many good things for them.—The holy GOD who is hereby greatly dishonored, sees fit to alter the scene, to take his rod in his hand and to chastise them, and sometimes very sorely; that hereby they may be reduced to such an obediential conduct as his manifold mercies were ineffectual to bring them to. And so by his altering his hand, he designs upon the whole, their benefit and advantage. For if they are brought to that humilia∣tion, godliness and virtue, which GOD expects of them, great is the advantage and benefit resulting to them from his judicial dispensations, however sore and distressing.—They are then prepared for the removal of them, and for the return of GOD'S favours and blessings in all desirable instances of them, so that on the whole here, there is occasion to praise GOD in times of evil and calamity; not for evils and calamities in them∣selves
<PB N="10" REF="014830_0008_0F978A0118C82D60"/>
considered, but for the good ends GOD has in bring∣ing them on.</P>
<P>BUT then it may be further observed—That sometimes, yea, for the most part, there are many positive mercies en∣joyed in times of evil.</P>
<P>INDIVIDUALS for the most part find it so. It is not often that their state, though greatly afflicted, is yet quite forlorn and desperate. If they are in pain and sickness of body, yet they may have comfortable houses, lodging, medicines, food and fewel, and the tender care and help of near and affectionate friends, all which serve in some measure to sweeten bitter cups, to lighten heavy burdens, and to keep them from sinking under the pressure of their troubles.—So also, persons sometimes meet with sorrowful bereavements. Those that were near and dear to them are taken away, up∣on whom they were wont to place their hopes, and from whom they expected to have much comfort. But then others are spared to them, and sometimes when they have been in the like dangerous circumstances as those that have been taken away, sickness has been removed from their families, and the voice of health and salvation again heard in them.</P>
<P>IN these and other instances that might be mentioned, there is mercy intermixed with afflictions. And at the same time that they are called to humiliation and mourning, they have yet abundant occasion for thankfulness and praise to GOD. In short, there is no condition that persons may be in, but upon a view of all circumstances, they may find mat∣ter for praise to GOD. And considering their deserts at his hands, their utter unworthiness before him, by reason of their vileness, ingratitude, disobedience and rebellion towards his sacred majesty, they may with the strictest justice take up that
<PB N="11" REF="014830_0009_0F978A019F1B64E8"/>
language, "it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not con∣sumed, because his compassions fail not."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LAMENT. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE same observation with respect to individuals, holds true with respect to communities. Sometimes after a long Sun-shine, GOD "creates darkness." After a long calm, he raises a storm, and causes it to beat fiercely upon them. The state of their affairs wear a different aspect from what they did not long before. A very gloomy prospect opens before them, and it may seem as if utter ruin and destruction awaited them.</P>
<P>THOSE terrible calamities of war, pestilence and drought come in the room of peace, health and plenty. These bless∣ings they may have long been in the enjoyment of, but did not sufficiently prize them; but in having the scene so; changed and altered, they are brought to know the worth of what they once enjoyed.—But now, upon a view of all circumstances, much of the goodness of GOD is to be seen amidst all these evils, and they have occasion for praise as well as humiliation.</P>
<P>THIS that I have now said, holds true with respect to us in this land.</P>
<P>For a long course of years, there has been a very general and remarkable state of health throughout the land. No contagious mortal sickness has GOD sent into it, as was for∣merly the case. I need not mention instances here.—And by this means we have greatly increased and multiplied, been enabled to extend our settlements, and many of them, though young, have greatly flourished and prospered, and have bid fair to do so more and more under the common
<PB N="12" REF="014830_0010_0F978A02561949A0"/>
smiles of Heaven. But in the summer past GOD was pleas∣ed to send a most grievous pestilence into the land, and great has been the mortality in one place and in another, and in some not far from us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The disease above alluded to was the Dysentry, or as it is commonly called, the Camp Distemper. A great mortality hereby, there was in the towns of SUTTON, MARLBOROUGH, GROTON, DEDHAM, as well as in divers other towns in this, as well as in the neighbouring governments.</NOTE> In this matter, GOD has dealt as favorably with us in this place, perhaps as with any in the land.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">But one single person in this large, populous town, died of the above disease, many families were visited, though not severely. The family to which this person belonged was the most so. A large family, almost all visited, but all recovered except this one.</NOTE> What special cause for praise and thankfulness have we for his great goodness in such a time of calamity and distress? Is it, brethren! for our distinguishing goodness, righteousness and virtue, that we have been thus favorably dealt with! This is a matter worthy our consideration. And if upon a serious and impartial consideration, it shall appear that we have been as obnoxious as others who have been visited, the sparing mercy and goodness of GOD de∣mands our unfeigned gratitude.—But then, with respect to the land in general, the fatal malady is greatly abated if not wholly subsided. And the voice of health is again heard in our land. And this also, as members of the body demands our gratitude and praise to the great preserver of men.</P>
<P>IT may be added—that peace is a blessing which for many years past has been enjoyed in our land. No wars nor ru∣mours of wars, no military campaigns and battels—"No confused noise of warriors nor garments rolled in blood."
<PB N="13" REF="014830_0011_0F978A030FF3D4F0"/>
No people on the earth have in this respect been happier, or it may be, so happy as we have been. Public peace and tranquility is a great and inestimable blessing. Men feel and enjoy themselves in such a state, agreable to the rank they hold in the creation. Hereby scope is given to popu∣lation and increase—to the flourishing of the liberal and mechanic arts—to the increasing in their trade, commerce, navigation, &amp;c. and under the smiles of divine providence to their becoming great and opulent, and respectable both at home and abroad. When they dwell in peace, unmolest∣ed by enemies, they then bid fair to be in the agreable situa∣tion, that Moses in GOD'S name encourages the people of Israel with upon their obedience. "Thou shall lend unto many nations, and thou shall not borrow. And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shall be above only, and thou shall not be beneath."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DEUT. xxviii. 12, 13.</NOTE> Plenty, wealth, dignity, liberty, all seem to be comprised here.</P>
<P>When such is the state of a land, we may very properly adopt the language of David; having recounted some sig∣nal instances of GOD'S kindness, which he might apply to his own people, or however leave for general application. "Happy is that people that is in such a case."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PSALM cxliv. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE> Among the instances of happiness that he mentions, is that of being free from the molestations of enemies, and so of course, en∣joying internal peace and tranquility, besides enjoying di∣vers other kinds of happiness in connection with this, as noticed in the preceeding verses. And I cannot but add with the Psalmist, "yea," or rather, "happy is that people whose God is the Lord," whose he is in a special peculiar
<PB N="14" REF="014830_0012_0F978A03D1E43B10"/>
sense, a GOD in covenant, through JESUS CHRIST, the blessed mediator. And now, notwithstanding, as it has been ob∣served, that vice, luxury, and all kinds of immoralities are wont to increase in proportion, as countries grow great and opulent, yet this cannot be the natural, unavoidable ten∣dency of things; but must be owing to a strange infatua∣tion in mankind, to a most wretched perversion of the de∣signs of a good providence. The design of GOD in all the instances of his goodness; public prosperity and happiness among the rest, is to engage men to universal gratitude and obedience towards him. And being in such a happy, pros∣perous state, as we have mentioned, as they are under great obligations; so, they are under great advantages for im∣provement in religion: To attend upon the public duties and offices thereof, which are wisely designed and well a∣dapted, and with a concurring divine blessing, have often been succeeded to the effecting the purposes of real, vital piety and Godliness; which should it generally prevail in a land, would be its greatest glory, dignity, excellency, safety and defence. If it was said of the renowned <HI>Elijah</HI> upon his translation, that he was "the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." What shall be said of a land, what of its greatness, dignity and safety, when there are great num∣bers of his excellent spirit and character? "Righteousness exalteth a nation" more than any thing else, for it is the most excellent thing, above gold, yea above fine gold. It is this that renders it peculiarly, yea most eminently re∣spectable. One observes upon the case of <HI>Elijah,</HI> "that he was to that people, by his counsels, reproofs and pray∣ers, better than the strongest force of chariots and horses, and kept off the judgments of GOD. His departure was like the routing of an army, an irreparable loss. Better have
<PB N="15" REF="014830_0013_0F978A055F15AC10"/>
lost all their men of war, than this man of GOD," How great now must be the glory and safety of a people, when there are many, many <HI>Elijahs</HI> among them? And I would observe, that the outward peace, prosperity and the flourish∣ing of a people, affords special opportunities and advantages for the forming men in general to the excellent character we have mentioned.</P>
<P>So that peace and tranquility in a land must be consid∣ered as an inestimable blessing to it. Happy would it be was it to prevail amongst all mankind of every tongue, tribe and nation. But this cannot be expected so long as the lusts of men, their pride, avarice, revenge, &amp;c. remain. Happy would it be were these destroyed, and the kingdom of the prince of peace universally established in the earth.</P>
<P>WE may now go on to observe, that war is a very great and distressing calamity, and it is proportionally so, accord∣ing as the seat of it is near or far off. It is when it is sent into a land, greatly impoverishing to it, drains it of its sub∣stance and occasions many sorrowful breaches in towns and families. Things are put out of course, men's trade and commerce and various occupations greatly obstructed, their subsistance, deriving from their industry and diligence, greatly failing, and sometimes quite cut off, and they be∣come reduced to great straits and difficulties. Thus it is in a great many instances. We have sufficient proof of this at the present day.—At best a variety of difficulties and hardships must necessarily be undergone by a people, at a time when the sword of war is drawn upon them, and they are exposed to the devastations of it. This is a calamity that has been very common in the earth from age to age.
<PB N="16" REF="014830_0014_0F978A0613BD2960"/>
"Nation has lift up sword against nation." And what depopulation of countries, what slaughters and desolations have been made in the earth? We may see the full proof of all this, if we only look into the antient scripture-history. There has been the like proof of it in latter times, in our own, as well as in the times of our fathers.</P>
<P>As to internal peace and tranquility in our land, as I said before, no people on earth have been happier than we have, of a long season. Notwithstanding frequent incur∣sions in former years of the savages of the wilderness upon our exposed frontiers, yet no invasion of foreign powers up∣on our sea-coasts. Whatever, attempts there have some∣times been of this sort, yet through the good hand of our GOD towards us, they have proved abortive. We have been called to "stand still and see the salvation of GOD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was remarkably the case in the year 1746, in the defeat of the powerful French Squadron, under the command of the Duke D'Anville. Most fearful devastation would undoubtedly have been the consequence, had he succeeded, especially upon our sea-coasts. But GOD "persecuted them with his tempest, and made them afraid with his storm." "He sent out his arrows and scattered them, and shot out lightnings and discomfited them. This defeat through the good hand and providence of GOD, is very curiously set forth in a Thanksgiving Sermon preached at Boston, upon that memor∣able occasion, by the late Reverend and learned Mr. Prince.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>BUT the time is come, when the sword of war is drawn upon us; not by foreign powers, but by our fellow-sub∣jects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with whom, we long maintained a friendly, brotherly correspondence, equally to their advan∣tage as ours. And this would doubtless have continued
<PB N="17" REF="014830_0015_0F978A06DDD684F0"/>
without interruption, but for the evil councils, the dark po∣licies and base intrigues of some in power and high dignity at home, aided and assisted, as is but too evident by some among ourselves. I would be far from trespassing upon the rules of charity, but there is notwithstanding clear light and evidence.</P>
<P>AND matters are now come to be very serious indeed.—The contest it seems, is not to be decided but at the point of the sword. This for several months has been drawn up∣on us, and we have been pierced and wounded and greatly distressed by it. Our capital town has been taken possession of by British troops—from its being the grand resort of the country, the seat of plenty, affluence and administration of civil justice—remarkable for its observation of the public duties and offices of religion, and particularly on the chris∣tian-sabbath, as I am thoroughly knowing to.—This, which has also been the city of our solemnities, whither our tribes both of the civil and sacred order annually assembled to con∣sult and promote the good both of church and state. This stately, elegant city is converted into a garrison. One of its sacred temples turned into a nursury for dragooning.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The old South Meeting-House.</NOTE> Though we do not superstitiously with the papists, maintain the doctrine of the <HI>real</HI> holiness of places set apart for the worship of GOD, yet methinks such a treatment of a place of publick worship, indicates a most shameful, horrible im∣piety, and a public mockery of the established religion of the country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It may with propriety be so spoken of, if it be ONLY considered that the laws respecting it, have received the royal sanction.</NOTE>. When I consider what a grave and respectable assem∣bly were wont to worship in that house, now so shamefully de∣secrated and polluted; when I reflect upon the memories of the venerable WILLARD, PEMBERTON, SEWALL, PRINCE, and
<PB N="18" REF="014830_0016_0F978A078EA2B828"/>
divers excellent young ministers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two of which, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Rev. ALEXANDER CUMMING, and the Rev. JOHN HUNT, have deceased in the midst of their days and usefulness.—Two others, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Rev. SAMUEL BLAIR, and the Rev. JOHN BACON, of respectable characters, received a dismission at their own request.</NOTE> since them, who have burnt and shone in that golden candlestick; of the pure, spiritual worship all along therein maintained. I cannot but feel an inward grief, as well as just indignation, at such a horrible sacrilegious treatment of it—not by Roman-Ca∣tholicks, but by those that profess the Protestant, reformed religion.</P>
<P>IT may be further said with regard to that devoted City, that its harbour is crowded with powerful ships of war.—Its trade, navigation and fishery wholly cut off. Military law established in it. Its Churches broken up. Its inhabitants even the most rich and opulent among them mostly gone off, leaving all their rich and valuable effects behind them, with but very little prospect of ever recovering them. Its poor that were publicly supported, turned adrift into the wide world. And many that were comfortable to live, through their honest industry in their several occupations, now obliged to the public charity. And those that remain, for the most part, reduced to the greatest strait and wants, cut off from all those supplies that were wont to flow in to them, and out of the reach of their friends and brethren in the country, who have very sensibly felt for them, and would gladly have ministered to their necessities, had it been at all practicable. But all communication being wholly stopt, they are in danger of perishing the ensuing winter, by hunger and cold.</P>
<P>THIS is a true picture of that once distinguishedly happy town. Nor am I sensible of having at all heightned the co∣lours
<PB N="19" REF="014830_0017_0F978A0850F76A10"/>
of it. Much of our blood has been spilt in battles and skirmishes. There have been divers captures of our vessels, with their valuable cargoes. And two of our large, flour∣ishing and wealthy towns,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CHARLESTOWN and FALMOUTH, in Casco-Bay. The inhabitants of the former, had for sometime before deserted it, and removed their most va∣luable effects; and so were in no capacity at all of annoying the regular troops. Had they been in any danger from this quarter, especially after they become masters of Bunker-hill, they might have had some plausible pretence to lay it waste.—As to the latter, it is at a great distance from the seat of action, and being without any fortification was not capable of mak∣ing any defence. Nor was that place specially obnoxious. Some may call this true heorism and generalship; but all sober, impartial persons, must look upon the destruction of both, as the effect of wantonness, not to say, cruelty and barbarity.</NOTE> wantonly laid in ashes. And a settled plan to reduce all our sea-ports, they can have ac∣cess to, to the same condition. And if possible to penetrate into the interior parts of the country, and to spread desola∣tion and ruin far and wide, without any distinction of per∣sons; and then to bring the miserable, enfeebled inhabi∣tants that remain, into a state of the most abject servitude.</P>
<P>BUT I would now go to observe—That notwithstanding such a dismal state of things has taken place among us, yet we have abundant cause for praise and thankfulness to GOD that he has intermixed so many mercies with this calamity, so that our case is not as yet come quite forlorn and desperate, whatever it may be in time to come; yea, that we may en∣tertain some hope, at least, of being ere long delivered from this calamity, and of being again restored to peace and tranquility.</P>
<P>I have mentioned various favourable circumstances with respect to other calamities we have been visited with, the pes∣tilence
<PB N="20" REF="014830_0018_0F978A090F668910"/>
and drought. And many favourable ones have there been with respect to the war, in which we are unhappily involved.</P>
<P>THUS when they first commenced it upon us at Lexing∣ton and Concord, they found our people, contrary to expec∣tation, brave and resolute; and though few in number, in compare with them, yet they were repulsed with great loss, and disappointed of performing their enterprise. Their having thus waged war upon us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If giving the first fire determines the point of commencing war, abun∣dant evidence has been exhibited both from the living and the dead, that they (near a 1000 in number) commenced it upon our little handful at Lexington. However, it has been justly obseved—that "he that arms himself, to com∣mit a robbery, and demands the traveller's purse, by the terror of instant death, is the first aggressor, though the other should take the advantage of dis∣charging his pistol first and killing the robber."—Rev. President Langdon's Sermon before the Provincial Congress, May 31, 1775.</NOTE> at once roused not only this but all the colonies far and near: And they immedi∣ately and readily poured in from all quarters to check and restrain them from further onsets and violences. In conse∣quence of which, they were soon surrounded and hemmed in on every side, so that they have been in a besieged state to this very day, and extremely drove, officers, from the highest to the lowest, as well as privates, not only with respect to the delicacies, but even the necessaries of life. Had they not been thus repulsed and restrained in the beginning, in all pro∣bability great would have been the distress very soon in the country towns. And this very town, it is with good reason supposed, was one object in view in the excursion they made. But "the snare was broken, and we have escaped. Blessed be the Lord, who gave us not a prey to their teeth."</P>
<P>THE affair of Charlestown, though they took from us, small in number in compare with them (notwithstanding a

contrary representation sent home) though, I say, they took from us the ground and the works of a single night, yet it was with amazing loss on their part, not only of privates, but of an uncommon proportion of officers, and some of them of principal rank.</P>
<P>OUR Lines and impregnable fortresses, are now extended all around our capital, which they have got possession of, and every preparation made to repel them in case of an attack. Had an attack been practicable, no doubt it would have been made before now. For it must be very humiliating to <HI>Bri∣tons</HI> who have been so universally (and I will add, in times past, particular in the last war, among the nations in Europe, so justly) celebrated for their gallantry, to be under any restraint from raw, undisciplined <HI>Americans,</HI> of whose abili∣ties they have been wont to entertain the most contemptible idea, and upon whom they have been wont to bestow the most opprobious names.</P>
<P>IT may be added,—That GOD has raised up able and experienced Generals, who have brought our army under a good regulation, and time has been given for their acquir∣ing and becoming very expert in the military art; nor are they wanting in strength and agility of body, nor in manly courage and fortitude. A remarkable state of health has prevailed in it. Notwithstanding multitudes being visited with the <HI>Dysentry,</HI> yet few comparatively have been the in∣stances of mortality, not more perhaps, than if they had all tarried at home. A remarkable union and harmony has ran throughout the whole. An abundant supply of the necessary supports and comforts of life, has all along been flowing in to them. Many of their vessels, with their rich freights, designed for our annoyance, and their support and

comfort have fallen into our hands.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not only many vessels of theirs, laden with the richest wines, meat, grain and vegetables, have from time to time fallen into our hands, and which they could but poorly spare; but one, fraught with vast military stores, not easily to be collected by us in our own land; a particular account of which has been published, and most perhaps have seen.</NOTE> And by our various operations, they have been greatly distressed. And the ne∣cessity of the case has obliged us to distress them in all ways in our power.</P>
<P>To enfeeble, dispirit and distress an enemy, from whom nothing could be expected but desolation and ruin, without submitting to abjectness of condition, must be justified upon the plainest principles of reason.</P>
<P>A remarkable and unexpected union has taken place, throughout all the colonies; and their several Delegates met in General Congress, who have had the direction of our military affairs, have discovered a wonderful penetration, sagacity, wisdom and sore-cast in all matters at this critical juncture, big with the fate of America, and have rendered themselves worthy of the public respect and gratitude.</P>
<P>I may add here as a favorable event in divine providence; that part of our forces have been led to penetrate the coun∣try of Canada; that they have been put into possession of several of their strong and important fortresses, and that there is so promising a prospect of their becoming masters of the whole country.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, they soon became masters of with but little opposition. The Forts of Chamblee and St. John's, after a short siege surrendered. And presently, Montreal. They have very lately met with a repulse at Quebec. Herein they have met with but the fortune of war, but they still hope to carry their point there.</NOTE> An important affair this—as part of the
<PB N="23" REF="014830_0021_0F978A0DAC8D3660"/>
plan for subduing us, it appears probable from various cir∣cumstances, was to let loose the <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> to act over upon our new settlements, and so gradually along from one stage to another, the same bloody tragedy that they were wont formerly to do: So placing us, as it were between two fires, from the one or the other of which rendering our destruction unavoidable. But this plan, by our operations in the country of <HI>Canada,</HI> bids fair, according to human pro∣spect to be defeated, and especially as the inhabitants thereof very generally manifest a friendly disposition towards our people, and are ready to afford them all necessary supplies.</P>
<P>So that from the various favorable events in the course of GOD'S providence in this day of war and great calamity, we are furnished with abundant matter of praise and thankful∣ness to his great name. It appears that though he is chas∣tising and correcting us, yet that he hath not wholly cast off his people, neither hath forsaken his inheritance. And we may even now adopt the grateful language of the redeemed Captives from BABYLON. "The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PSALM cxxvi. 3.</NOTE> Upon a survey of his goodness in the many important instances of it, "his praise should be <HI>continually</HI> in our mouths."</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though GOD has manifested his goodness towards us in this day of evil, in the manner that has been said, yet we may not "boast as though we had put off the harness." This we have but just "girded on." We may not expect any thing properly miraculous in the course of GOD'S providence towards us, but must look to the stated course of it. In his governing providence, he is wont to make use of means and instruments, which are adapted to such and such ends. Such and such causes are wont to produce their
<PB N="24" REF="014830_0022_0F978A0F47E80470"/>
correspondent effects: Though it is true, that he can, if in his wisdom he sees fit, suspend the influence of natural causes. But we may in no case of a certainty, depend upon it, that he will do so.</P>
<P>IT appears, that on the other side the water, no concilia∣tory measures have been adopted, nor like to be so. Indeed GOD has the hearts of all men in his hands, even of Kings and the great ones of the earth, and it is easy with him to turn their hearts towards us. But what lengths it may please him the holy and righteous governor of the world, to permit them to go, and how far he may see fit further to chastise and punish us through their instrumentality, we cannot tell. Con∣sidering our multiplied and aggravated iniquities against him as a people, who have been so highly favoured and distin∣guished by him, lifted up to heaven in regard of privileges, civil and sacred—Considering our baseness and ingratitude, for his abundant goodness and loving-kindness, may not our flesh tremble for fear of him, and we be afraid, of his judg∣ments, such as shall be totally ruining and destroying, which we must acknowledge we have justly exposed ourselves to? GOD has many ways in which he can destroy a people. In∣deed whenever he sees fit, he can do so, by an immediate act of his almighty power. But he is wont to make use of in∣struments, and sometimes that of the sword. This, as we have before observed, he has permitted our brethren in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to draw upon us. It is vastly unhappy, it cannot be too much lamented, that we are thus at odds, with a peo∣ple and nation, that we have been so nearly connected with, who have been above all other nations dear to us, being "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh."—Her glory has been great and we have greatly rejoiced in it. Her moral state indeed has been very sad. It is no unjust reflec∣tion upon her to say this. May not the holy GOD complain
<PB N="25" REF="014830_0023_0F978A10A5A43EE8"/>
over her, as he did over his antient professing people, "Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil∣doers, children that are corrupters"?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah i. 4.</NOTE> What a prevalence of Deism and infidelity, prophaneness and immorality, dissipa∣tion, luxury, venality and corruption? This wretched, cor∣rupt state has long been complained of, with respect to that highly distinguished nation, which has hereby justly exposed itself to exterminating judgments. Did that "righteousness by which a nation, is exalted," generally prevail in it, such a contest with the colonies, and the calamities consequent up∣on it, it is probable, would not have taken place. And the unnatural, hostile, bloody treatment of them at this day, may be looked upon, not as one of the least of the heinous abominations she stands chargeable with in the sight of Heaven.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the agency of GOD in calamitous events, such particularly, as he has brought upon us, and the great and important ends he may have in view, yet the in∣struments employed by him (intelligent, voluntary ones I mean) may be actuated from very bad motives and princi∣ples, and may have it in their view to answer very bad ends. And thererefore, they are highly culpable in the sight of GOD. Thus it was as to Joseph's brethren in their unnatural treat∣ment of him, of which we read in the book of Genesis.—They meant what they did unto him "for evil," and they were thoroughly convinced of this in process of time, and led in the anguish and bitterness of their hearts to acknowledge it. "GOD meant all for good," as the event abundantly made evident. But this was no excuse for their base conduct towards their own natural brother.</P>
<P>THE unnatural treatment we have met with from our bre∣thren of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is unjustifiable in them and very
<PB N="26" REF="014830_0024_0F978A1156CA6960"/>
culpable, whatever may be said of the superintending provi∣dence of GOD, and the great and wise ends he proposes to answer upon the whole. May a gracious GOD reform all her national errors and vices, and make her "a holy nation, a peculiar people" to himself; and mercifully prepare the way for an happy, lasting and honourable accommodation to take place between them and us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">War, it has been observed in this discourse is a fore calamity. No one acting upon the principles of christianity, which, like its author, breathes nothing but peace and good will to men; or even upon the principles of common humanity, can "delight in it." Lucrative commissions, high dig∣nities and honours will weigh nothing against these principles duly exercised. Thus far we may freely say, as to the Americans, that they do not engage in the present war of choice and with delight. They regret the shedding a drop of British blood.—They are not disposed to lavish away their OWN blood and treasure, merely for the sake of doing so. They are not chargeable with such wretched absurdity as this. Nothing but the great law of self-preser∣vation, which is paramount to all the laws of civil establishments, puts them upon drawing the sword. They would have rejoiced to have continued in harmony with the parent state and they earnestly wish the restoration of that harmony. The very idea of rebellion against their sovereign is abhorrent to them.—When a rebellion actually existed in North-Britain, in 1746, level∣led directly against the crown and dignity of his late Majesty George II. of glorious memory, by attempting to introduce the pretender to the throne, his loyal subjects in America, were universally fired with a just indignation at the daring attempt. They stood ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes in support of their sovereign. They rejoiced when that unnatural rebellion was suppressed under the victorious arms of his royal Highness WILLIAM, Duke of Cumberland. They kept days of public Thanksgiving to ac∣knowledge the great goodness of GOD in interposing in that affair. And they ever remained his dutiful and loyal Subjects afterwards. At his decease, they testified their lamentations in every public way,—and then heartily transferred their fealty and allegiance to their new Sovereign, his royal Suc∣cessor George the Third. All joined to hail his accession to the throne of his royal ancestors, and to say "Let the King live for ever." And as they have never been disposed to strike at his crown and dignity, but agreable to the inspired direction, to "<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>" him, so they cannot but be deeply affected that they lie under his frowns. They desire nothing more, than to enjoy fully and unimpairedly the benefits of that excellent civil constitution, at which he is placed at the head by the providence of the great sovereign of the world, and that in order to its full support and establishment, and that they enjoy inviolate, those charter-rights and privileges, which were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to them by the royal faith of the illustrious William and Mary. They have been happy, and rejoiced in their happiness, in being connected with Great-Britain. They do not desire to be unconnected with or independent on her, but only to enjoy, what they think they have an unalienable right to; their constitutional and charter rights and privileges. In this view of the case they desire to leave their cause with that GOD, who judgeth righteously They therefore cannot with any justice to themselves, yield to the charge of rebellion, and look upon themselves as greatly injured in being treated as though they were actually engaged in one.</NOTE> However, I would
<PB N="27" REF="014830_0025_0F978A12112D9928"/>
observe, our case is not as yet desperate. We may hope in GOD, that the event of all will be comfortable and happy to us. Hitherto, many have been the favorable events of GOD'S providence, as we have particularly mentioned them at this time. So that without being over anxious as to futurity, we have great cause for thankfulness and praise to GOD. We have in all times past had occasion to praise him, to do so "continually" as in our text. And such we have at present, notwithstanding all gloomy circumstances that have and do attend us.—And we are met together this day in this public manner to celebrate the praises of a kind and merciful GOD towards us as a community.—Upon a survey of the goodness of GOD in the various instances of it, notwithstand∣ing all our unworthiness, let us see to it, that our hearts are warmed with love and gratitude to Him. And let it not con∣tent us merely to speak his praises—let not any merely out∣ward professions of gratitude satisfy us; but in addition here∣to, let us live the praises of the Most High; putting away e∣very evil and transgression, so provoking to GOD, and procur∣ing
<PB N="28" REF="014830_0026_0F978A12D62D7998"/>
his judgments; devoting ourselves to his service and glo∣ry; looking to him, that for the sake of his son Jesus, all past disobedience may be forgiven, and that he would vouchsafe the vital influences of his blessed spirit to enable us to a hearty return to him, and to the love and practice of all that duty and service which he requires and expects from us.—This would be to praise GOD in the most genuine, substantial manner; and this would be an acceptable sacrifice to him through Jesus Christ: And if we and this whole people could be brought to this, we might then safely leave ourselves with GOD, commit our cause to him, nothing doubting but that he would plead and maintain it. If we are on GOD'S side, we may then depend upon it, that he will be on ours, and then more is with us and for us, than can be against us. We need not then fear, but that he would be with us, as he was with our fathers, (and he was with them many a time, in their greatest straits and exigencies, such was their faith and prayer and en∣gagedness in his service) and never leave us nor forsake us. And we might then take the comfort of that word with which I close the discourse,—Psalm 50, last verse, <HI>Whose offereth praise, glorifieth me, and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of GOD.</HI></P>
