<HEAD>JOY and GLADNESS: A THANKSGIVING DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL><HI>ESTHER</HI> viii. 15.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>—And the city of</HI> Shushan <HI>rejoiced and was glad.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT we may rightly understand the occasion of the joy and gladness ex∣pressed in our text, it must be noticed, that a certain favorite minister with the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> called <HI>Haman</HI> the <HI>Agagite,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> enemy, who, it seems, by his being thus called the <HI>Agagite</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> enemy, was a reputed branch of the royal feed of <HI>Amalek.</HI> This favorite, by art and base in∣sinuation, imposed upon his master, King <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> to such a degree, that he obtained a most cruel de∣cree, to take away the lives and properties of the <HI>Jews</HI> in one day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A warning to Princes, not to trust their favorites too far.</HI></NOTE> The request and decree are as followeth: <HI>If it please the King, let it be written that they may be destroyed.—And the letters were sent by posts into all the King's provinces, to destroy, to kill,
<PB N="4" REF="010612_0004_0F80EEC158B9B258"/>
and to cause to perish all</HI> Jews, <HI>both young and old, little children and women, in one day—and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</HI> Now when this bloody <HI>edict</HI> was published, there was (as well there might be) great distress among the <HI>Jews. In every province whithersoever the King's commandment, and his decree came, there was great, mourning among them, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</HI> In this critical hour, Queen <HI>Esther,</HI> informed by her uncle <HI>Mordecai,</HI> of her own and nation's danger, (although uncalled) to the ha∣zard of her life, she approaches the presence of the King <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> and finds favor in his sight. Thus the finger of GOD began to appear, in answer to the cries of the distressed <HI>Jews,</HI> which shone still more by the signal bringing of <HI>Mordecai</HI>'s long neglected service to the mind and notice of <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> in the most seasonable hour, to pave the way for the dis∣grace and destruction of proud <HI>Haman,</HI> and sure advancement of worthy <HI>Mordecai,</HI> to dignity and honor. These things being done, at Queen <HI>Esther</HI>'s second approach and request, for herself and her people, before the King, the <HI>Jews</HI> obtain liberty to defend their lives and properties. This was the singular occasion that gave rise to the joy and glad∣ness of the city of <HI>Shushan,</HI> the royal palace of the Kings of <HI>Persia,</HI> as expressed in our text.</P>
<P>LIKE to this, is the deliverance of <HI>America</HI> at this time, by the REPEAL of the <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> in several regards.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE lives, liberties and properties of the <HI>Jews</HI> were exposed to destruction—And so were the lives, liberties, and properties of the <HI>Americans,</HI> if this dreadful act, or decree, had not been repealed.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT bloody <HI>decree</HI> given at <HI>Shushan</HI> the pa∣lace, was obtained by a favorite—So 'tis thought that this odious act was procured by a favorite.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="5" REF="010612_0005_0F80EEC20AC22298"/>
3. THERE was mourning and fasting with the <HI>Jews,</HI> in their distress—So there has also been with many sober persons in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IT was most evident, that GOD gave the <HI>Jews</HI> deliverance—In like manner it is evident, that GOD has given us our great deliverance, who turns all hearts, even as the <HI>King's, whither soever</HI> HE <HI>will.</HI></P>
<P>THUS by accommodating our text to our present times, we shall,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. MENTION some things, that should excite us in <HI>America</HI> to joy and gladness, at this season; not confining our discourse merely to our late <HI>deliverances.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. POINT out how we should rejoice and be glad on this occasion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. NOTICE some fruits that should attend our joy and gladness.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> Mention some things, that should excite us in <HI>America</HI> to joy and gladness, at this season: not confining our discourse merely to our late <HI>deliverances.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we have presented in one view, heathen <HI>Shushan</HI> half buried in slavery; flowing with joy and gladness, to find the doomed <HI>Jews,</HI> by the unhappy <HI>Persian</HI> constitution, only indulged and encouraged to arm themselves for the defence of their lives and properties. And shall not <HI>we</HI> christians and <HI>English-men,</HI> feel an ardent flame of joy and gladness inspire our hearts, when we see the <HI>fetters</HI> removed from our feet, and <HI>swords</HI> from our throats; and every thing dear to us, secured on its former basis, by the <HI>repeal</HI> of the odious Stamp-Act? Thus to behold <HI>America,</HI> emerging from this dark cloud, that threatened to pour forth upon her an irresistable torrent of miseries, to the latest ages, is a view that most naturally does, and should fill every true-born <HI>American,</HI> with joy and gladness, whilst he discerns <HI>the snare broken, and his soul escaped.</HI> As no language can paint out what
<PB N="6" REF="010612_0006_0F80EEC426F8CE80"/>
true sons of <HI>America</HI> felt, and what they expected, in this night of tribulation, when their Sun of Liberty underwent such an amazing eclipse; so is it im∣possible, by words, to describe the joy and gladness that does, on this occasion, dilate the souls of this people; reaching the most remote corners, and with a strange rapidity seize every rank of reasonable beings, that either desire or taste freedom.</P>
<P>AGAIN;—when we of this congregation remember the gloomy horror which covered our faces, and the anguish that filled our hearts, in the year past, under our then approaching dangers; and call to mind, that those surrounding walls bear witness for us, that there we sought the LORD in our distress, and lifted up our hands, with our hearts to GOD in the heavens for deliverance, as knowing that GOD ruleth among the inhabitants of the earth, as well as armies in heaven; this reflection cannot fail of swelling the tide of joy and gladness in our hearts, when now we behold ourselves here assembled to praise GOD, and rejoice before him with thanksgiving, for the very deliverance we sought at his hand. And this na∣turally leads us to say with the Psalmist, <HI>I will praise thee, for thou hast heard me, and art become my sal∣vation.</HI> And with <HI>Solomon, He shall not much re∣member the days of his life; because</HI> GOD <HI>answereth him in the joy of his heart.</HI> This spring of joy should not be easily forgotten.</P>
<P>A FARTHER consideration to excite and increase our joy and thankfulness to GOD, at this season, arises from his kind care, as the great Governor in Providence, and bountiful Author of every blessing, who foresaw all the miseries and embarrassments of poor and distressed <HI>America;</HI> under the decay and stop of her commerce, shutting up of the courts of justice, with a train of other evils, which strangely stagnated all business.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010612_0007_0F80EEC4E79D6B20"/>
IN this period, GOD has shewed his pity and mercy, in giving so general health, and such a plenty of the necessary fruits of the earth, by which, in the year past, our misery and distresses have been much abated, and without which, in our other cir∣cumstances, we had nigh been overwhelmed with misery. These are the tender mercies of our GOD, that call for joy and gratitude from every heart among us.</P>
<P>STILL to aid our joy and gladness, at this season, we recollect, that this is the happy day, in which the <HI>liberty,</HI> allowed by <HI>royal charter,</HI> of electing the mem∣bers of his Majesty's council for this province, is to be exercised. This demonstrates, that we yet are a free people, and have occasion to rejoice in that privilege mentioned by the prophet—<HI>Their nobles shall be of themselves.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to crown all our joy and gladness on this oc∣casion, and excite it to the highest pitch, we must ever remember, that in the name of the divine Saviour, there is published to the world, a <HI>REPEAL</HI> of the most amazing doom pronounced against sinners. This is indeed worthy to be called <HI>glorious news,</HI> and the most sweet and heart-refreshing, that ever entertained mortal ears. Lo! such messages echo from the Book of GOD, <HI>Thou shalt call his name</HI> JESUS; <HI>for he shall save his people from their sins. And behold the Lamb of</HI> GOD, <HI>which taketh away the sins of the world.</HI> Still the soft sound attracts our ears, GOD <HI>sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</HI> And CHRIST <HI>hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. And the Angel said unto them, Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people: for unto
<PB N="8" REF="010612_0008_0F80EEC50E3E06D0"/>
you is born this day, in the city of</HI> David, <HI>a Saviour, which is</HI> CHRIST <HI>the</HI> LORD. These are messages worthy of a seraph sent from GOD! For what will it avail us, my brethren, to rejoice in the <HI>birth-rights</HI> of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and account ourselves happy in a de∣liverance from a late grievous <HI>burden,</HI> laid on our necks; whilst in the next or present moment, we reflect and view ourselves, servants to sin, bond slaves to Satan, lying under the infinite burden of GOD'S wrath and curse, and heavy yoke of a condemning law, hasting into the prison of hell, and dark abodes of the damned, there to be reserved in <HI>chains of ever∣lasting darkness, to the judgment of the great day.</HI> Hence, the news of an eternal redemption by JESUS CHRIST, sounding in the ears of fallen men, ap∣pears to be, indeed, the most noble and highest matter of joy and gladness, not only to <HI>America,</HI> but to the world; and infinitely exceeds all tempo∣ral deliverances or civil freedoms. 'Tis the saying of the Redeemer of men, <HI>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</HI> Let us then, inspired with the hopes and lively expectations of living and reigning with CHRIST, and enjoying <HI>the glorious liberties of the sons of</HI> GOD, indulge an holy freedom of soul, pouring forth our joy and gladness, in a sort joining the heavenly high, saying, <HI>Glory to</HI> GOD <HI>in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men</HI>—Longing for our arrival to those peaceful abodes, where no bounds will confine, nor sorrows diminish our joy and gladness, in perfect freedom, for ever and ever. But to proceed:</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We were to point out, how we should rejoice and be glad, on this occasion.</P>
<P>IT is GOD, (<HI>who created all things, and upholds all things, by the word of his power,</HI> who alone is the supreme Governor of the world, and fountain of
<PB N="9" REF="010612_0009_0F80EEC5CD42BAC8"/>
being and perfection) in whom all intelligent crea∣tures should rejoice and be glad, and not in them∣selves. It is indisputable, that the joy and gladness of holy angels, is peculiarly in GOD, as the force of all perfection and glory; and is excited by every discovery of these divine perfections and glories, in his works of creation, grace or providence, towards the universe of beings. It is therefore in GOD, through JESUS CHRIST, the divine <HI>mediator,</HI> that we, fallen men, should rejoice and be glad, seeing 'tis only in him we are able to behold the divine glory, agreeable to that of the apostle, <HI>For</HI> GOD <HI>who com∣manded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of</HI> GOD, <HI>in the face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. Hence we learn from inspiration, to rejoice in GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST supremely. And thus speaketh the prophet, <HI>I will greatly rejoice in the</HI> LORD, <HI>my soul shall be joyful in my</HI> GOD, <HI>for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation.</HI> Again, another prophet, in a dark season, saith, <HI>Yet I will rejoice in the</HI> LORD, <HI>and joy in the</HI> GOD <HI>of my sal∣vation.</HI> In like part <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh, <HI>But we also joy in</HI> GOD, <HI>through our</HI> Lord JESUS CHRIST. It behoves us, on this occasion, therefore, to rejoice in GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST, by whom every deliverance or mercy flows down to us; <HI>for salvation is of the</HI> LORD. Whenever mercy, good∣ness or kindness appears, there we should notice the finger of GOD, which justly leads us this day to rejoice in GOD supremely, as the alone giver of <HI>every good and perfect gift.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN:—If we would know how to rejoice with gladness acceptable before GOD, at this season, it must spring from a divine faith, wrought in our hearts by the grace of GOD, which <HI>is the substance of
<PB N="10" REF="010612_0010_0F80EEC6F1D84100"/>
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,</HI> and agrees to that divine sentence, <HI>Believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory.</HI> Without the divine faith in the being, perfections and faithfulness of GOD, in the record he has given of his Son, all our joy and gladness is heathenish and abominable, as an empty noise displeasing before GOD; for <HI>without faith, it is impossible to please</HI> HIM. Let us then <HI>take heed, brethren, left there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living</HI> GOD, in this the day of our joy and gladness.</P>
<P>BUT still to point out, how we should rejoice this day before GOD, we ought to keep in mind, how variable human scenes are, not imagining that our mountain stands so strong as never to be moved. Surely we have not so soon forgot the dark day, when the Sun of our <HI>Liberty</HI> set in a gloomy cloud, which, for a season, boded perpetual night. Then our faces gathered paleness, whilst we saw <HI>fair Liberty</HI> so suddenly fled from her former delightful abodes.</P>
<P>THIS unexpected <HI>eclipse</HI> of our darling Sun of Liberty, should for ever impress our hearts with a feeling sense, that all human things are uncertain. Here we may learn, to salute and embrace fair Liberty in her return, with a trembling hand, and jealous heart, left we provoke her to withdraw from these happy climes; for she is so delicate and modest, as not to fit long in the proud <HI>lap of presumption and security.</HI> Therefore we should at this season, accept that word of inspiration, <HI>Serve the</HI> LORD <HI>with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</HI> And in the midst of our joy and gladness, imitate <HI>Jacob,</HI> in his return from exile; <HI>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant.</HI> In this humble, zealous and trembling manner, in∣terwoven
<PB N="11" REF="010612_0011_0F80EEC75196B750"/>
with joy and gladness, may we now wel∣come Liberty in her auspicious return to these her pleasant seats; and in such arms may we retain her to the latest ages, as the offspring of GOD, sent to bless this new world.</P>
<P>To add farther, how we should rojoice before GOD acceptably, on this occasion; it naturally occurs, that we remember the poor, and make them glad and rejoice with us, by kind portions, after the ancient custom of GOD's people on occasions of singular joy. This will be <HI>an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Now that we may close this head of directions, how we should rejoice and be glad before GOD, on this extraordinary occasion, which, on many ac∣counts, far exceeds all that have gone before in <HI>British America;</HI> as the distress and awful appre∣hensions of danger and misery had risen, in general, much higher than ever was known in this land before, under her sharpest trials, and most singular distresses, which have been many and great from the very beginning; so never did the hearts of all swell with grief, or expand with joy and gladness, as on this occasion,—Therefore in the fulness of our hearts, we should pour forth devout raptures of praise and thanksgiving to GOD on high, that go∣verneth over the kingdoms of men, who proclaimeth himself <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> He only <HI>is worthy to be praised, who doth great things, un∣searchable and past finding out.</HI> 'Tis the LORD our GOD who hath given <HI>us this great deliverance,</HI> in which we rejoice and are glad.—Therefore, with holy <HI>David,</HI> let our hearts and lips join, when he saith, <HI>I will praise the name of</HI> GOD <HI>with a song, and will magnify</HI> HIM <HI>with thanksgiving.</HI> In this sort may our affections ascend to GOD, in the chaunt of
<PB N="12" REF="010612_0012_0F80EEC817D40960"/>
praise this day, which <HI>shall please the</HI> LORD <HI>better than an ox or bullock, that hath horns and hoofs;</HI> yea, better than all the fire-works in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>III. We were to notice some fruits that should attend our joy and gladness, on this special oc∣casion.</P>
<P>The supreme love of GOD, stands in the front of these fruits, which should wait on, and flow from our joy at this season. May we not justly imagine, that GOD is saying of <HI>America,</HI> on this occasion, as he did of his <HI>Israel</HI> by the prophets: <HI>Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour. In all their affliction, he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them.</HI> And shall not such thoughts, raise in our hearts, the most ar∣dent wish for the heavenly dove, to descend with balmy wings, and shed abroad in our hearts a sera∣phick flame of love to GOD; that we may give GOD our whole hearts in this the day of our glad∣ness. And so shall we prove that we are children that will not lie, and manifest, that our hearts are right with GOD. When our souls breathe forth this language of <HI>David, I will love thee, O</HI> LORD, <HI>my strength.—The</HI> LORD <HI>is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer.</HI> The LORD, in very deed, has been our strength, rock, fortress, and deliverer in our late distresses, and in all our distresses. Hitherto we may say the LORD hath helped us.—And can we think of making any less return to him, than the highest affections of our souls? GOD forbid such a thought.</P>
<P>AGAIN:—The giving glory and honour to GOD, as the author of all, and particularly our late sal∣vation, is a fruit necessarily connected with our joy this day. We have a divine injunction, <HI>Call</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="010612_0013_0F80EEC8ED437A88"/><HI>upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</HI> We of this congrega∣tion have the comfort to recollect, that here we called upon GOD in our day of trouble, and he hath delivered us: Let us not then be wanting in glorifying HIM. But my brethren, whilst I am urging you to give glory and honour to GOD, the supreme benefactor, from whom every blessing descends, I abhor the most distant thought, of diminishing our esteem and veneration for our gra∣cious King, and noble Patriots, whom GOD long preserve as extensive blessings, not only to our na∣tion and land, but to the world, and late receive them to eternal glory. Yet I think too much has formerly been said, in our national successes and deliverances, about ministerial wisdom, accomplished generals, and intrepid soldiers; even to the neglect of that honour and glory, which is due to GOD only, who furnishes those brave instruments with their shining talents, and raises them to power, and succeeds them in their noble enterprises for the good of men—As we seem to have fallen into this error formerly, we may easily discern like danger at this time, of robbing GOD of his glory, by ascribing too much to men, who are but in∣struments, how excellent soever they may be. An inspired King exhorts the grandees of the world in this language, <HI>Give unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>O ye mighty, give unto the</HI> LORD <HI>glory and strength.—Give unto the</HI> LORD <HI>the glory due unto his name!</HI> To this ex∣hortation may I not ardently wish, the mighty in our nation, land, and world, would do themselves the honour carefully to attend. Then will they esteem themselves most honoured by those, who honour GOD for them, and account it their highest glory to be instruments of glorifying HIM by whom
<PB N="14" REF="010612_0014_0F80EEC991F73288"/>
<HI>kings reign, and princes decree justice.</HI> Thus we shall be safe in paying all just honour to the instruments of our deliverance, whilst we glorify GOD on their behalf. This fruit of honouring GOD, I hope will attend our joy and gladness on this season.</P>
<P>THE next fruit that presents itself in view, as what should naturally attend our joy and glad∣ness, for the present deliverance from slavery, is a serving GOD with freedom and delight of soul, running the way of his commands with enlarged hearts, who has delivered us from bondage and dis∣tress. Does not GOD speak to us of <HI>America</HI> in his providence, as once to <HI>Israel</HI> by his prophet? <HI>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love, and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws.</HI> Has not GOD done this latterly for us? And shall not we esteem his service our greatest freedom; accounting his <HI>yoke easy, and his burden light? Being delivered out of the hands of our ene∣mies,</HI> let us <HI>serve</HI> GOD <HI>without fear, in holiness and righteousness, before him all the days of our life.</HI> For us now to live in the service of our own lusts, and slavery to Satan, or in any disobedience to the just and lawful authority over us under GOD, when we are rejoicing in our <HI>English</HI> freedom and late deliverance.—This is absurd to the last degree, and well does merit, and justly might provoke an holy GOD, for such baseness and ingratitude, to doom us to eternal <HI>chains</HI> in hell, as delighting in slavery.</P>
<P>THE last fruit we shall notice, that should attend our joy and gladness on this occasion, is a fitting and retaining on our spirits, a deep and grateful sense of GOD'S, unmerited, mercy and goodness to∣wards us in our deliverance, so that we may not lose the influence of it on our hearts and lives all our
<PB N="15" REF="010612_0015_0F80EECAAC4E6840"/>
days;—left the weight of that charge fall upon us, as on <HI>Israel of old—They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy</HI>—Or that rebuke, <HI>they sang his praise, they soon forgat his works.</HI> GOD forbid such baseness and trifling, ever to be found with us. But may a grateful sense of our salvation abide in our hearts, and influence our lives whilst we remember that we are reasonable beings.</P>
<P>Now we close all with a few reflections. Here 'tis natural to view the opening scenes of joy, with a kind of divine pleasure expanding our hearts into an extasy, like that of the psalmist, <HI>When the</HI> LORD <HI>turned again the captivity of</HI> Zion, <HI>we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they, the</HI> LORD <HI>hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</HI> Thus the most surprising and marvelous pros∣pect, breaks in upon our eyes at this time; when but a few months past, a prospect of blood and slavery both to ourselves and posterity, presented itself in all its horrid deformity. The face of things are now changed, and the happy vision of safety and <HI>Liberty</HI> entertains our eyes, and employs our thoughts, with inexpressible delight in the thoughts of living and dying free men, and leaving this freedom, as our best patrimony, to the ages yet unborn. What must be the satisfaction of such reflections, when they receive the additional sweetness which springs from the re∣demption of JESUS CHRIST, <HI>into the glorious liberty of the sons of</HI> GOD! This far exceeds all language, and swallows up all our thoughts as in a boundless ocean of goodness.</P>
<P>ANOTHER reflection at this season, may very well turn our case in a special manner, to give GOD the glory of our freedom, and not man: <HI>Not unto us,
<PB N="16" REF="010612_0016_0F80EECB3A854320"/>
O</HI> LORD, <HI>not unto us, but unto thy name give glory.</HI> This is becoming language, even for the most ex∣alted monarchs on earth. Yet we find a strange aptness in men, when admiring the noble instruments of their preservation, to rob GOD of the glory due unto his name, and wickedly say, '<HI>tis the voice of a</HI> GOD, <HI>and not of a man.</HI> Although <HI>Herod</HI>'s worms demonstrate the falshood of such a shout, and leave a warning for the most exalted princes, or shining orators, to give GOD <HI>the glory.</HI> From this sin of robbing GOD of his glory, in this transport of joy that fills our land, may divine <HI>grace</HI> preserve both us and our happy deliverers under GOD.</P>
<P>TO add farther, GOD'S delivering us at this time, should inspire us with holy courage and confidence, in HIM, in all our dangers, and teach the ages yet to come, to <HI>fix their hope in</HI> GOD. Shall we not say, on this occasion, GOD <HI>is our refuge and strength, a very potent help in trouble: therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be car∣ried into the midst of the sea?</HI> Let <HI>America</HI> never despair; but trust in and cry to GOD, as her refuge and present help in trouble.</P>
<P>BUT still our reflections should lead us to re∣member, we are this day before the LORD our GOD, in our joy and gladness. Therefore our joy should be such as becometh men and christians; not the joy of beasts and heathens—left if we close this day with vain mirth, we should provoke the eyes of GOD'S holiness to send more wrath upon us, by which we may be utterly consumed. Here, surely, while we are solacing our hearts with the pleasure of deliverance, from perpetual slavery to men, it becomes us to feel a kind of holy indig∣nation swell in our breasts, at the thought of living in a most abject slavery to our own lusts, and
<PB N="17" REF="010612_0017_0F80EECBF9F73FA8"/>
being the willing captives of Satan. And does it not become <HI>Americans</HI> in general, and each of us in particular, to petition, with a greater union and importunity, the <HI>Majesty of Heaven,</HI> for deli∣verance from such a spiritual slavery, than ever it did to petition his Majesty on earth, from the de∣liverance from the most detestable <HI>Stamp-Act?</HI> Or can any thing less than a resolution, never to be forgotten, burn in our hearts on this occasion, de∣termining our souls, that by the grace of GOD, we will not jest or give over the suit, until we know the happiness of being CHRIST's <HI>free-men?</HI> This will afford a pleasure infinitely more exalted and ravishing, than what now fills <HI>America</HI> with joy and gladness.</P>
<P>Now let our reflections close with an ardent wish, that <HI>America</HI> may be <HI>as a field which the</HI> LORD <HI>hath blessed,</HI> on which he will cause his heavenly dew perpetually to descend, where heaven-born Liberty shall for ever smile—All whose inhabitants, like their kindred spirit on high, may be inspired with supreme love to GOD, and his Son JESUS CHRIST. Animated with this offspring of GOD, love divine, may unceasingly give him the honour due unto his name—Aiming at the most universal obedi∣ence, shall <HI>honour all men, love the brotherhood, fear</HI> GOD, <HI>honour the King</HI>—And continually re∣taining the most grateful sense of GOD'S mercy and loving-kindness towards them, by which they are indulged to dwell in tents of freedom on earth; and live in sure hopes (by JESUS CHRIST) of shining in glorious mansions of perfect freedom with GOD in heaven for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
