<P>Then said I unto them, Ye see the Distress that we are in, how Jerusa∣lem lieth waste, and the Gates thereof are burnt with Fire: Come, and let us build up the Wall of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that we be no more a Reproach. Then I told them of the Hand of my <HI>GOD</HI> which was good upon me; and they said, let us rise up and build.

Will ye rebel against the King?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>FTER much perplexity, and in the midst of great anxiety, resulting from the unhappy situation of our national and American affairs, we once more see the return of an anniversary election.</P>
<P>On this occasion, in which our political fathers attended with crouds of loyal subjects, and free-born citizens, are come up to the house of GOD, to recognize his goodness, spread our distressed case before him, and devoutly seek his gracious patronage, I know of no words more suitable to address you in, than those now read.</P>
<P>They are the words of good <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in that truly animated speech, in which he addressed himself to his suffering brethren, at <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> when he came <HI>with the good hand of his</HI> GOD <HI>upon him</HI>; and a
<PB N="6" REF="014383_0005_0F92626D14CDDDE0"/>
royal mandate from the <HI>Persian Monarch,</HI> to redress their grievances and repair the wastes of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>They contain every thing suited to our case in this dark and trou∣blesome day.</P>
<P>We have here in the first place,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Our own condition exactly expressed, "Ye see the distress that we are in, how</HI> Jerusalem <HI>lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire,</HI>"</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>What spirit we ought to shew in our distressed Circumstances, "They said, let us rise up and build, so they strengthened their hands for that good work.</HI>"</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The opposition to be expected, and embarrassments which frequently attend benevolent endeavours to retrieve a sinking nation and distressed peo∣ple, arising from an evil designing faction. "When</HI> Sanballat, <HI>&amp;c. heard it, they laughed us to scorn, dispised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the King?</HI>"</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>A good resolution persisted in, fixed on a pious basis, ensuring the great∣est confidence of success, "The</HI> GOD <HI>of Heaven he will prosper us, therefore we his servants will go on and build:</HI>" And a proper treatment of such as are unfriendly to due exertions for the public safety, "<HI>You have no portion, right, or memorial in</HI> Jerusalem."</P>
<P>The patience and candor of this numerous and respectable audi∣ence, will bear with me, while I touch on these respective branches, in the subsequent discourse, apparently tending to influence to suita∣ble reflections on this solemn occasion.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We have then our own condition expressed, "Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</HI>"</P>
<P>Jerusalem was the capital of Judea, and "the center of unity of the Jewish people, both in religious and civil affairs;" the temple there erected, was an emblem of their religious and civil polity. For "thither the tribes went up to give thanks unto the name of the Lord, and there was the seat of judgment, even the seat of the house of <HI>David." Ps.</HI> cxxii. <HI>v.</HI> 5. The Jewish personage, therefore, in de∣scribing the afflicted condition of the people, by <HI>the wastes of Jerusalem,</HI> and her <HI>gates burnt with fire,</HI> signifies the distressed and ruined state of the people, relative to their religious and civil affairs, and the conse∣quent miseries they felt, as well the demolition of their literal tem∣ple by the ravages and flames of war.</P>
<P>In all these respects, they were in a miserable condition indeed. A parallel between their situation and ours, in every instance, I pretend not; but a resemblance in some particulars, and in regard of the de∣gree of distress, will be sufficiently apparant from a concise view of our real state at this day.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014383_0006_0F92626DCE0589E0"/>In general the ground of our complaints, is such things as these. A determined <HI>plan</HI> already pushed on, to the astonishment of all true Englishmen, calculated in its natural tendency to subvert the British constitution, which for ages has stood the guardian of the means of her subject's happiness, the envy of foreign nations, and the admi∣ration of the whole world, and to substitute in the room thereof, <HI>ab∣solute despotism,</HI> and as the certain consequence, <HI>cruel tyranny,</HI> and the <HI>total slavery</HI> of all America.</P>
<P>IN pursuit of <HI>this,</HI> many cruel resolves, and unconstitutional acts of late parliaments, which wore a most threatning aspect to the whole continent—If we would see their genuine operations and proper ef∣fects, we need only advert to a neighbouring province—there we shall find, they have made an actual seizure of their charter, ravish∣ed its most valuable and essential rights, without giving the people an opportunity to receive conviction of having made a forfeiture, or vindicating their innocency, from the vile slander and wicked mis∣representations of designing men.</P>
<P>In consequence the distress and confusion of that devoted province —their capital filled with the King's troops, their harbour with his ships, on purpose to compel the people into submission; their port blockaded up, their trade and business at an end, the inhabitants, by thousands, instantly turned to want and beggary, having no method of subsistence but on the charitable contributions of their sympathiz∣ing brethren, in their own and neighbouring colonies.</P>
<P>In this state have they endured with great patience and fortitude, till at length we are assured, by good intelligence, open hostility is commenced by the King's soldiers. In the late battle at <HI>Concord</HI> and <HI>Lexington, inglorious to the British arms!</HI> they have imbrued their hands in the innocent blood of their fellow subjects with a relentless cruelty and inhuman barbarity, too much like that which we have experi∣enced from the merciless savages of the wilderness.</P>
<P>The metropolis of that unhappy province is now become a <HI>garrison town,</HI> the inhabitants, by thousands, confined within its walls, in the greatest consternation, from fearful apprehensions of being put to the sword, or of perishing by famine.</P>
<P>The whole continent, justly alarmed at these appearances, filled with the deepest concern for themselves, their posterity, yea the whole British empire.</P>
<P>And further, the embarrassments laid on regular and necessary procedures, in the several governments, in managing their own af∣fairs,
<PB N="8" REF="014383_0007_0F92626E8F2C00B0"/>
insomuch that the wisest statesman scarcely knows what way to turn himself, any more than what will be the final issue of the present convulsion. The non-importation agreement, in prudence and ne∣cessity extorted, in our own defence, the alienation of his Majesty's affections from his loyal American subjects, who ever have been, and still are, ambitious to assert and maintain their loyalty and obstinate attachment to his <HI>royal person, family</HI> and <HI>government,</HI> on principles that at first introduced the illustrious house of <HI>Hanover</HI> to the throne, and which alone can support their rights to it, consistant with the British constitution. The interruption of that mutual confidence and affection that have for so long a time subsisted, between the pa∣rent state and the colonies, to the great satisfaction and mutual ad∣vantage of both. The apparant danger of a total alienation between both countries, to the great injury of each, to say the best, and final∣ly from the present growing appearances, the eminent danger of be∣ing universally plunged into the horrors and distresses of a civil war.</P>
<P>Nor is this machination less inimical to religious liberty—our reli∣gious privileges and civil liberties are inseperably connected and mu∣tually dependant on each other; if therefore the one fails the other cannot subsist long, and the former is in a great degree the barrier of the latter, "in such a manner as nothing else can be." Of all our blessings then, we should esteem our religion the most valuable, and nothing should so much alarm us, as any attempts to rob or abridge us of freedom, in a full and peaceable enjoyment of it. But the sa∣cred rights of conscience, and the most precious privileges of the gospel, are no less aimed at than every thing else dear to us. Two years since, in a great assembly, on such an occasion as this, it was justly complained of,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TURNER's Election Sermon.</NOTE> "how dormant the laws of <HI>England</HI> against Popery were known" then "to remain"—and as a specimen mention was made of "a Roman Catholic Bishop, at <HI>Canada,</HI> and a Popish Priest at <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> publicly supported." But now such has been the rapid progress of the wicked contrivance we are speaking of, as that, in respect of the whole country of <HI>Canada</HI> (an extent of above 2000 miles) Popery is the established religion, and Protestanism is suffered to subsist, only by toleration, and that in such circumstances, as in all human view, the latter will soon be extirpated by the for∣mer, and effectual provision, for all this, is secured by an act of a late parliament, commonly known among us by the name of the
<PB N="9" REF="014383_0008_0F92626F34711450"/>
<HI>Quebec Bill.</HI> What a shocking figure must this make in the <HI>English</HI> annals? And what a stigma of disgrace and inconsistency must it fix on a professedly Protestant parliament, for having enacted it: When once this source of national and colony woe shall have run its length, where are we? To what a wretched state of oppression and slavery shall we be reduced? That fair inheritance which our fathers, the first settlers of this country, purchased for us, at the expence of their treasure and blood, left us possessed of by a clear title, confirm∣ed by royal charters, in a most solemn manner, is extorted from us. The best religion in the world, we must exchange for all the barba∣rity, trumpery and superstitions of Popery; or burn at the stake, or submit to the tortures of the inquisition. In these circumstances, who would desire to live? Yea, who would not "choose strangling and death rather than life?" This is a just and moderate account of the state of things Whence a plan, that has already produced such great and universal misfortune, and if pursued, must and will, in all human view, produce greater beyond all imagination, should o∣riginate, I know but little, and shall say less; yet were we to judge from its natural tendency, complexion and effects, we must conclude it first sprang from that original <HI>wicked politician,</HI> who "works in the hearts of the children of disobedience," and has his habitation in the regions of darkness and cruelty.</P>
<P>To the above we may add, as what encreases the gloom, and what, with great humility and deep penitence, we should reflect on, the awful declining state of religion and virtue, and the fearful preva∣lence of almost every species of immorality.</P>
<P>From these alarming prospects we cannot but see "the distress we are in," through the nation, and these colonies in particular. For relief much depends under GOD, on our taking and pursuing the course dictated in the passage under consideration. This brings me therefore to consider in the next place,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The spirit we ought to shew in our distressed circumstances. "They said, let us rise up and build, so they strengthened their hands to this good work."</HI></P>
<P>Here is every thing our case requires, in point of human prudence, in order to remove present distress, and avert impending ruin: <HI>Particularly,</HI> a firm resolution and vigorous efforts, in opposition to a sinking despondency, which enervates action and is often the offspring of distress.</P>
<P>Union, in every proper method, is a thing of absolute importance without which any plan, be it ever so well conceived, will prove abortive.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014383_0009_0F92627013087B78"/>The conduct of affairs, at such a critical juncture, with confi∣dence, placed in the hands of such men, of whose character we have a lively picture, in that of <HI>Nehemiah</HI>; and the people supporting, to the utmost of their power, their leaders in the common cause.</P>
<P>It was a very abject condition this ruler found his brethren in when he came to them: They were in bondage to the <HI>Persian</HI> empire, stript of their invaluable priviledges, their temple thrown into heaps of ruin, cruelly oppressed and insulted by the King's servants set o∣ver them; some were destitute of the means of bare subsistence, o∣thers had "mortgaged their lands;" "some had borrowed money for the King's tribute upon their lands and vineyards," "others ob∣liged to sell their sons and daughters, to be servants, neither was it in their power to redeem them." Had they given way to these dis∣couragements, in all probability they never would have emerged from their low and depressed condition; but being roused to vigor∣ous exertions, by this spirited address, displayed a noble fortitude, and were succeeded.</P>
<P>True indeed, we may in vain expect <HI>salvation from the hills, and the multitude of the mountains</HI>; nor ought our confidence to be placed mere∣ly in the best of men or means; yet it is as true, that Heaven works by proper means and instruments, in the use of which only, we can rationally expect his interposition.—And when he designs salvation, he excites a proper spirit, directs and influences to suitable measures, as in the case of the Jews, in this <HI>great and good work</HI> they had set their hearts upon.—And has he not in many instances remarkably ap∣peared in our case, and given tokens of good, so far at least, as to raise our hopes, and inspire the most unshaken resolution? With a forti∣tude like that displayed in the passage before us, we must <HI>arise and build,</HI> tho' we hold the sword in one hand, our lives and liberties in the other. Our very distress dictates the most undaunted resolution in all lawful measures:—What of this spirit has appeared, should there∣fore be tenderly nursed. And has there not appeared a becoming re∣solution? has it not spread surprisingly thro' all America? has it not in a proper manner manifested itself in the resolves of Assemblies, in the appointment and <HI>production</HI> of the <HI>Continental Congress,</HI> who have performed not only to the approbation, but to the admirati∣on of their constituents.— Of the last importance is the strictest union in every town, and between the towns in every colony, and between the colonies through the whole continent —</P>
<P>It is not <HI>comparatively</HI> of so much importance what method we pro∣ceed
<PB N="11" REF="014383_0010_0F926270AEAE5140"/>
in (if just in the sight of Heaven) provided as general and as strict a union as can be expected, be inviolately maintained.—There is no∣thing in human view can give us such a hopeful prospect as that u∣nion which has obtained—its parallel is not to be found in all histo∣ric existence—great pains has undoubtedly been taken on one hand to effect it—great pains on the other to prevent it. To establish and increase it, will be the great object of attention on one side,—to dissolve it on the other.—But after all <HI>the hand of our God is good upon us</HI> in this thing.—Our enemies must confess it to be a token of good. They did not expect it,—<HI>laughed</HI> a pretence of it <HI>to scorn,</HI> when they saw it were not a little chafed, and confounded; and even our very friends were in doubt about it.—Heaven be thanked, it has been accomplished to so great a degree; to the joy of true patrons of liber∣ty, and to the embarassment of tyrants, may Heaven increase and establish it!—</P>
<P>This is the great hinge, under God, our ALL is like to turn upon,— If this is kept sacred, it is certain, Great-Britain can never carry into execution the present despotic plan of colony administration, without the ruin of the whole British empire.—And unless the kingdom is ripe for destruction, and destined to be its own executi∣oner, we may reasonably presume she will never be so infatuated in the present controversy, as to attempt it by fire and sword.—</P>
<P>Should America be urged to the last extremity by coercive mea∣sures, it is to be hoped we shall be found not to have lost, entirely, the BRAVE SPIRIT which rested on our Fathers, and that things unex∣pected will in providence turn up in our favour.—</P>
<P>It was well said, near twenty years since, by a writer whose general sentiments are sufficiently in favour of prerogative measures, <HI>We have a thousand instances wherein, the driving people to the last streights, and put∣ting them under the tuition of such a master as absolute necessity, has taught them inventions, and excited them to industry, which have compassed things, as much regretted at last, as they were unforeseen at first,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An account of European settlements in America, vol. 2. page 179.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let every true friend then, in the righteous cause, promote union, and conscienciously avoid every thing that may tend to subvert it.— It is very apparent, every artifice is practised to divide the colonies among themselves, as a means necessary to compleat our ruin.—</P>
<P>If we crumble into parties among ourselves, we can't expect to stand, agreeable to those unfailing maxims of our Saviour, <HI>a house di∣vided against itself cannot stand, a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="014383_0011_0F9262717052E150"/>Subjoin we may, the importance of having men in the Administration, whose characters are exemplified in that of the noble personage in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext.—The people had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>idence in this ruler, and wisely submit∣ted their affairs to his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gement.—</P>
<P>It is absolutely necessary, especially, in times of perplexity &amp; danger, to have the best men to conduct in public matters.—If the people are not very careful in this instance, all attempts will be likely to issue in tumult and confusion; the cause meant to be promoted will rather be injured. It is not safe for individuals ordinarily to assume the management of public affairs. By collecting into promiscuous multi∣tudes, they make themselves important out of place, and misplacing their resentments, may make those to become important, who, had they been on the right side of the question, could have done no good, and on the wrong, never could have done much hurt.—</P>
<P>True indeed, it is a <HI>good thing to be zealously affected in a good cause</HI>— but then, if zeal be not tempered with prudence, and proportioned to its object, it will become the most extravagant thing in the world, and it may be expected its effect will be of its own complexion.</P>
<P>I am far from supposing insurrections never do any good, or that they are not <HI>sometimes</HI> even necessary, and as far from condemning in the gross, every thing that has happened of that sort, in late trouble∣some times, and much farther yet from thinking there has not been manifested a truly patriotic spirit, however, it is no reflection to sup∣pose, in some instances there may have been a mistake—matters may have been carried too far, the innocent may have been abused—and no wonder, for if <HI>oppression will make a wise man mad,</HI> it may be expect∣ed it will make the inconsiderate and less judicious, absolutely fran∣tic.—However it may have been in regard of these things, we are all agreed, that it is of the highest importance, that we have at the head of affairs, men of the best abilities—and of such we have an exam∣ple of him speaking in our text.</P>
<P>Here is the portraiture of the good man, patriot, and hero.</P>
<P>In his character and conduct we may see displayed the qualificati∣ons of those rulers calculated to stand at helm in the most stormy seasons.—At such times, especially, are to be sought out men of good <HI>natural endowments</HI> and <HI>extensive knowledge,</HI> men of <HI>prudence</HI> and <HI>delibe∣ration, fortitude</HI> and <HI>resolution,</HI> men of <HI>benevolence</HI> and a <HI>public spirit,</HI> of <HI>integrity, sincere piety,</HI> and <HI>untainted virtue.</HI>—</P>
<P>The affairs of state are deep, intricate, and often perplexed; and therefore require men of proportioned abilities, to adjust and dis∣pose
<PB N="13" REF="014383_0012_0F926272389B5540"/>
of them into a subserviency of the public good—a native strength of genius, lays a good foundation and gives a hopeful prospect of an able ruler.—[Where nature has been sparing of her gifts, it can't be expected a man will make any considerable figure in a public sta∣tion, or be able to conduct affairs to advantage—a distinguishing judgment, a quick apprehension, and a deep penetration into men and things, and especially, matters of state policy, are necessary to form the character of one with whom the safety of the public is to be trusted in special exigencies.]</P>
<P>Nor is it sufficient, that a man has a good natural genius, his intel∣lectuals must be improved and cultivated, by application to study and meditation.—</P>
<P>As the most interesting concerns of a community are devolved on Rulers, it is necessary that intellectual improvement be proportioned thereto. As reason and understanding give the human race superi∣ority to the brutal creation, and constitute in part, that resemblance to the Deity, in which man was created; so eminent degrees of refined reason and improved knowledge, not only raise a man above the common level, but cause him, in public station, to shine in a bright resemblance of the supreme ruler of Heaven and Earth, and enable him, in some measure, to act up to that character with which the Al∣mighty hath honoured him: <HI>Ye are Gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High.</HI>—[The more extensive and improved the Statesman is in knowledge and understanding, the greater blessing he is like to be, if he improve his knowledge to its proper end.—Rulers, by their of∣fice, are the guardians of the people's interests and happiness. It is their business to spy out dangers, to ward off mischiefs, and apply remedies according as the exigencies of the state require.] The ends of Government can't be served where knowledge is wanting—and in∣deed, a defect here, is often, no doubt, the occasion of great distress. Agreeable to what the wise man observes, <HI>the prince that wanteth un∣derstanding, is also a great oppressor.</HI> They should also be men of <HI>pru∣dence</HI> and <HI>deliberation</HI>; hasty procedures, rash conclusions, in pub∣lic measures, often throw a community into the utmost con∣fusion, and distress.</P>
<P>Things are ever to be treated with coolness and deliberation, according to the difficulty and the importance that attend them. Inconsideration and imprudence are the usual source of mischief, in common life;—when men act before they think, as they know not what they do, so they often have occasion to regret what they have done, when it is too late to retrieve the mistake. —By nothing perhaps does a community more frequently suffer,
<PB N="14" REF="014383_0013_0F926272EE6A00F8"/>
than by the inconsiderate and imprudent conduct of rulers.— Every step in administration should be calmly deliberated, and at∣tentively viewed in all its connections, and, as far as possible in all its consequences; and when the leaders of a people are endowed with this disposition, and exercise it, things will be like to go well, or if difficulties and perplexities happen, they will be the soonest re∣dressed—and, at this day, especially, it is of the highest importance that we have men of this complexion to conduct matters—nor will this obstruct, but rather promote resolution and fortitude; which our condition eminently calls for.—</P>
<P>The faithful Ruler may expect in common to meet with that op∣position and perplexity, that will furnish out matter sufficient to try his firmness; and especially when breakers are at hand: Then, if he is not a man of uncommon firmness, he may, thro' sordid cowardice, sculk from the helm, and leave the ship to dash against the rocks. Far from such a spirit was <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> Many difficulties attended his <HI>enter∣prize,</HI> but such was the noble spirit he was of, that they animated his resolutions, and inspired him with a fortitude superior to them.</P>
<P><HI>Benevolence, integrity,</HI> and a <HI>public spirit,</HI> are great ornaments to a pub∣lic station, and of absolute necessity to denominate any one a good Ruler.—These eminently appeared in the pattern before us.—This Jewish Ruler had a pungent sense of the distresses of his countrymen, for when he received intelligence from <HI>Hanani,</HI> of the <HI>great affliction</HI> they were in, he <HI>sat down and wept, and mourned, and fasted certain days,</HI> and so visible were the effects of his benevolent feelings, that, from the sadness of his countenance, the King read the deep sorrow of his heart. Rulers being thus impressed with a sense of public distress, what exertions may not be expected, even to the straining of every nerve?</P>
<P><HI>Sincere Piety,</HI> and unsullied <HI>virtue,</HI> in conjunction with the before mentioned instances, compleat the character of such men as we wish to see in place, at this important crisis.—</P>
<P>Religion is a greater ornament to a public station, than all ensigns of royalty, or marks of external dignity; and gives the greatest secu∣rity of persevering integrity.—This will shed a lusture upon all o∣ther endowments, and command a respect and reverence. This was to JOB, <HI>a robe and a diadem</HI>; there are no principles which can give the people such confidence of a good administration, as principles of real piety;—other principles, such as <HI>honor, public spirit, natural bene∣volence,</HI> and <HI>ambition,</HI> it is true, in some instances have influenced men to do many worthy deeds for the happiness of the community they
<PB N="15" REF="014383_0014_0F926275063AD940"/>
stood related to—many among the Greeks and Romans, from these principles, displayed noble instances of patriotism.—But such are not so sure, nor do they bind in the same way, nor to the same degree, as principles of religious virtue.—The good man has his mind impress∣ed with a sense of future invisible objects—he lives and acts under a sense of the omniscient eye of God, remembers the solemn account he must give, and the reward he shall receive for his conduct: This will be of such powerful influence with him, as to bear down all temp∣tations to violate whatever trust is committed to him, and will be a most powerful constraint to the greatest diligence, constancy, and fi∣delity; (influenced by these sublime principles, what a distinguished figure as rulers, do <HI>Moses, Joshua, Jehosaphat, David, Solomon, Heze∣kiah, Josiah,</HI> and may others make, in the sacred history? What zeal for God's glory? what indefatigable industry for the public good, did they display?) And besides, where the fear of God is prevalent with Rulers, it will lead them to exhibit such examples of moral conduct, as will be like to have a happy influence on those below them.—Those that move in exalted spheres, are under special advantages to do good to all around them—for, as their conduct is more carefully observed than that of others, so there ever has appeared among mankind a disposition to imitate their superiors; hence it is so generally found, that under the administration of vitious and abandoned men, all kinds of debauchery, profaneness, and immorality are apt to ride triumphant.—But on the other hand, when men of public character, in civil life, maintain a veneration for religion, are careful in their lives to conform to the rules and precepts of it, virtue will flourish, <HI>things excellent will be approved</HI> in general:—What a rich and extensive blessing, then, on this account, may godly men be to those over whom they rule?—In the highest reason, then, was that good advice to Mo∣ses founded, not only to <HI>take wise men, and understanding, and make them rulers, but also, to provide, out of all the people, such men as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness:</HI>—For the same reason, it is the will of the great Sovereign of the Universe, that they who rule, should be <HI>just, ruling in the fear of God.</HI>—Of such a character should those ever be, with whom the concerns of the public are entrusted, and especially at the present day, when we are not only in great trouble from abroad, but have embarassments arising from designing men among ourselves.</P>
<P>This reminds us in the third place,</P>
<P N="3">IIId, Of the faction mentioned in the passage under consideration. "When <HI>Sanballat, Tobiah,</HI> &amp;c. saw it, they laughed us to scorn, &amp;c." <HI>These were the leaders of a wicked combination, in opposition to the great and
<PB N="16" REF="014383_0015_0F926276DD8E7F70"/>
good work on foot among the suffering Jews.</HI>—From selfish, ambitious, biggotted principles, they practised every artifice, to perplex, defeat, and overthrow the design the people were engaged in.—By their in∣fluence they excited foreign powers to alarm and distress the Jews,— revived the old Samaritan resentments—by false accounts, and de∣signed misrepresentations, by groundless accusations and unmanly in∣sults, they prevailed to raise fears, jealousies and trouble in many re∣spects—in a secret manner they sought the life of <HI>Nehemiah</HI>—howe∣ver, such was his resolution and firmness, that all their attempts did not in the least dishearten him.—But leaving a farther pursuit of this matter, I come to what is of more importance to our case, and finishes that part of antient story under consideration.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>A good resolution to persist, placed on a sure and pious basis, tending to inspire the greatest confidence of success. "The</HI> GOD <HI>of Heaven he will pros∣per us, we, his servants will arise and build;" &amp; a proper treatment of those in the opposition;" "you shall have no portion, right or memorial in</HI> Jeru∣salem."</P>
<P>This was a manly reply to the opposing faction. It breathes the same excellent spirit the three worthies expressed when the haughty monarch thought to have awed them into compliance with his adoli∣trous edict, by his angry menaces—"O <HI>Nebuchadnezzer!</HI> We are not careful to answer thee in this matter, our GOD whom we serve HE is able to deliver us, and HE <HI>will</HI> deliver us out of thine hand O King"! In the like spirit and with the same humble confidence should we espouse, and persist in maintaining, the liberties and pri∣vileges of our country. Our cause is a good one, it is the cause of <HI>religion,</HI> of <HI>liberty,</HI> of our country, and consequently the cause of GOD! If we place a humble and a penitent trust in the Almighty, we need not fear, <HI>though the seas roar and the waves toss themselves,</HI> for with HIM are infinite power, wisdom, goodness, justice, and faith∣fulness. He hath said, and he will make it good, <HI>If ye be with me. I will be with you,</HI> and, <HI>If</HI> GOD <HI>be for us who can be against us?</HI> The Al∣mighty "is the hope," and the help "of his people in all genera∣tions." Such are the perfections of his nature, as that he ever has a full acquaintance with the circumstances of his suffering people, ability, and disposition to relieve them, whenever they properly ap∣ply to him. Our cause then we should piously refer to him, and quietly wait the event, in the use of proper means.</P>
<P>With respect to the treatment of those whom we know to be inimi∣cal to the common cause, the passage before us gives us instruction.</P>
<P>This ruler does not, it is observable, threaten to attack their per∣sons
<PB N="17" REF="014383_0016_0F926277EDC69508"/>
or property; nor, does he use them with indecent language, but treats them with deserved contempt, and total neglect. This is so proper in itself, and so agreeable to what is recommended by the wisest among us, we hope and wish the same may be duly attended to, in our own case, <HI>so far as may consist with</HI> absolute safety.</P>
<P>Before I come to the concluding part of this discourse, I would enter one or two remarks. The first is, that however the day is co∣vered with clouds of thick darkness, many with fearful expectation may be "looking out after what may seem to be hastening on our nation and land," yet we ought not to <HI>despond.</HI></P>
<P>On the one hand, to make light of our threatning dangers, would argue stupidity; to sink and faint would argue criminal timidity on the other, enervate every spring of action, invite and hasten on the very <HI>death</HI> we fear. There are many things, after all, that wear an encouraging aspect, for besides that we have no reason to doubt of the righteousness of our cause, we have many worthy patrons beyond the Atlantic, who have generously espoused, and nobly plead, and no doubt will perseveringly exert their abilities in our cause.</P>
<P>Among ourselves, a surprising union, and that firm resolution which breathes the same spirit that rested on our fathers, influenced them to encounter and vanquish the greatest deaths and dangers, in this, then, an inhospitable wilderness, in order to purchase, and leave secured to us, a most invaluable inheritance, too precious in itself, too dearly bought to be given up on any terms whatsoever, much less not to be exchanged for the vilest slavery. In these things <HI>the hand of our</HI> GOD <HI>has been good upon us.</HI> So far should any threat∣ning appearances be from disheartening of us, as that they should rouse to vigorous exertions, in proportion as they seem to encrease. This (Heaven be thanked) has hitherto been the case, and in him we hope will be, though we should be called to spill our blood in our own defence, should there be need. Then, let <HI>The hands that hang down be lifted up, and the feeble knees strengthened.</HI>—But our main sup∣port and confidence is in him <HI>who looketh down from Heaven, and behold∣eth all the sons of men,</HI> is able and ready to vindicate the cause of suf∣fering innocency, <HI>disappoint the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise, and the council of the froward he carrieth headlong.</HI> Let us not be dismayed, but come and take shelter under the <HI>wings of the Almighty, cast our cares on him,</HI> for <HI>He careth foru.</HI> Mmany a time has he appeared in the mount of difficulty, rescued our nati∣on, and this land especially, from the very brink of ruin. Time
<PB N="18" REF="014383_0017_0F926279C86AA1F0"/>
would fail me to mention the instances of this which our fathers have told us, and which we have seen with our eyes: Let us <HI>Stand firm in the liberty wherewith we have been made free, while we wait for thy sal∣vation,</HI> O GOD! <HI>as they that watch for the morning! For the mercy of the Lord hath been upon us according as we have hoped in him.</HI></P>
<P>And in order to increase and establish us in such a humble trust in GOD, as may afford a well-grounded assurance of success, it becomes us to search and try our hearts and ways, which have not been right in the sight of the Lord, and with true penitency to turn to him. Which is the other remark I would make—Have we not by our uni∣versal declensions, manifold offences, abuse of divine blessings, pro∣voked GOD into this severe controversy?</P>
<P>This was the cause of the people's distress, mentioned in the text: this they frankly acknowledge, in their public confessions, prayers and humiliation; and for us not to own it in ours, would argue a dan∣gerous and criminal stupidity: By the best accounts, we are assured, that in <HI>England,</HI> at this day, prevails a most awful prostration of all public, social virtue, and the peculiar graces of christianity, and a fearful prevalence of all kinds of immorality, neglect of GOD, con∣tempt of sacred things, and the vilest abuse of divine mercy and pa∣tience;—a growing debauchery, dissipation and venality. Very af∣fecting are the accounts we have, concerning the declining state of religion, in <HI>England,</HI> and the awful prevalence of all kinds of wick∣edness; and it were to be wished, a heavy charge did not lie against this country: But, with blushing, we must confess the contrary. As it concerns the continent in general, to consider, and be greatly affected in this matter; so it becomes us, in this highly favoured colony, to enquire for ourselves. We have been distinguished in religious and civil advantages:—The Christian institution, the last, and best ex∣hibition of the covenant of grace, we enjoy in its purity and sim∣plicity, and may truly say, we have the best religion in the world, free from superstition in its appointments in the holy Sabbaths, sa∣craments and ministry, and as free from ecclesiastical tyranny and persecution. We have also a civil constitution, in the hands of good men, the best calculated to secure our civil liberties: We make our own laws, choose our own rulers, and manage our own political mat∣ters among ourselves. Such indeed has been our happy situation, that GOD may justly say concerning us, <HI>What more could I have done for my vineyard that I have not done in it?</HI> And it were to be wished, we had not given him just occasion to challenge upon us, <HI>Wherefore, when
<PB N="19" REF="014383_0018_0F92627A6D703B90"/>
I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</HI></P>
<P>Let us ask, then, what our temper and treatment has been toward GOD, our <HI>rulers,</HI> our <HI>ministers,</HI> and one another in private life? Have we not <HI>forsaken the</HI> GOD <HI>of our fathers, and lightly esteemed the rock of our salvation?</HI> abused his patience, despised his threatnings, contem∣ned his authority, and trampled his laws into the mire? Have we not profaned his Sabbaths, trifled with his ordinances and holy sa∣craments, and said, <HI>practically, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</HI></P>
<P>How have we treated our rulers? Have no groundless jealousies been indulged, unreasonable clamours raised and propagated, at real or supposed mistakes, dishonest intrigues practised, to the injury, per∣haps, of as wise and good men as ever served our <HI>republic</HI>?</P>
<P>Have we highly esteemed the <HI>Messengers of the Lord of Hosts, for their work's sake,</HI> and <HI>obeyed the voice of our teachers</HI>?</P>
<P>With respect to one another, as individuals, have things <HI>honest, virtuous, just, benevolent, and of good report,</HI> been approved and prac∣tised? How it is, and has been, with us, in these respects, perhaps it is better each one should enquire than I should say—so far as we are, or have been culpable in those regards, we are to consider our∣selves, as having procured the tokens of the divine displeasure we feel and fear. If we are not careful, therefore, by deep penitency, and universal amendment, to put away whatever is amiss among us, we can never have a well-grounded confidence in GOD, for his decla∣rations are, <HI>Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place,</HI> otherwise, <HI>I will do unto the place which I gave unto you, and unto your fathers, as I have done to</HI> Shiloh—<HI>I will cast you out of my sight.</HI> Jer. viii.3, 14, 15.</P>
<P>I shall now put an end to this discourse in the addresses usual on such occasions.</P>
<P><HI>May it please your Honor, and the other Gentlemen of the General Court.</HI></P>
<P>You see the distress we are in, the thickest cloud we ever saw now impends our nation, and wears the most threatning aspect on these American colonies. You are raised to places of public trust, at a most important crisis. The most vigorous exertion of your best abilities, in the defence of the liberties and privileges of your country, against lawless power, and tyrannical encroachments, are called for.</P>
<P>We doubt not you have a pungent sense of the common misfor∣tunes of the day, and in a view of them are ready to break forth in that patriotic language, <HI>O</HI> suffering and oppressed <HI>Jerusalem! We
<PB N="20" REF="014383_0019_0F92627F585990F8"/>
prefer thee above our chief joy, all they shall prosper that love thee, for our brethren and companions sake, we will say, peace be within thy walls, and plenteousness within thy palaces:</HI> At such a critical juncture, <HI>We will not forget thee; O! pray for the peace of</HI> Jerusalem!</P>
<P>In confidence of your unshaken attachment to the religion and li∣berties of your country, the eyes of all this people wait on you as the guardians, under GOD, of their injured and endangered rights. While you lead in our public affairs, the people, we trust, will fol∣low and support you, in every wise method you shall concert for the public safety, at the risk of their lives and fortunes; for they have <HI>Strengthened their hands to this good work</HI>; and the spirit they are of is properly expressed in the language of the text, <HI>Come, let us build and be no more a reproach</HI>: You will then encourage your hearts, and the hearts of the people, with a spirit like that of this Jewish ruler, in the text. You will rise superior to every danger and temptation, and dis∣play a noble fortitude in so righteous a cause, and so <HI>good a work</HI>; no doubt every valuable accomplishment you are possessed of, as men, christians and rulers, will be sufficiently put to trial, especially your <HI>wisdom, prudence</HI> and <HI>firmness.</HI> Stimulated from a regard to the glory of GOD, a prospect of being instrumental of delivering your country, securing to yourselves, your people, and future posterity, the most va∣luable possessions that are struck at, you will exhibit specimens of zeal, constancy, integrity, and persevering resolution: Hereby, at least, you will secure the pleasures of self-approbation, the testimony of your constituents, and the final plaudit of your Supreme Judge.</P>
<P>[The example from whence we have specified the qualifications of men much needed in public stations at this season will have its proper influence with you.]</P>
<P>The people rest entirely satisfied in the measures that have already been taken, for the common security, in the late dangerous times, and I presume I may, in the name of the public, return thanks to the Assembly, in particular, for their care to put the militia into a pro∣per condition, and to revive a martial spirit. If this be pursued, we shall, no doubt, in a little time, be able to make a very respectable figure that way. An approved author, years ago, speaking of <HI>New-England,</HI> said, "and certainly if those men were somewhat regularly trained, it would be impossible to find, in any country, or at any time, antient or modern, an army better constituted than that which <HI>New-England</HI> can afford."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 643 of <HI>Guthrie</HI> continued.</NOTE> What would the same writer have said on a view of our present numbers, and surprising improvement, in the military art?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="014383_0020_0F926283DDA11D10"/>What future measures are to be taken in point of political pru∣dence, are entirely submitted to your <HI>wisdom</HI>; your tim<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, no doubt, will be principally taken up in the common cause; yet the particu∣lar interests of this Colony will have as much of your attention as can be spared—what gievances there are among us that need redress, your Honors much better understand than I.—</P>
<P>Religion and public virtue, in every view, are objects of the high∣est importance; they will therefore command your first and greatest attention: Your power, and the influence of your example, will be employed to encourage religion, and every social virtue; to sup∣press vice and immorality, in whatever form they may appear.—We ask your influence for the support and encouragement of a pious and learned Ministry.—The College in this colony we also recommend to your patronage.—That seminary has flourished of late, notwith∣standing, I am told, its funds are low, and on that account suffers.— Could supplies be handed in, for the repairs of its buildings, and the better support of its instructors, it would be rendered a greater bless∣ing to Church and State.—The public are under obligations grate∣fully to acknowlege the goodness of the General Assembly, in past favours for the encouragement of inferior schools, the good effects, of which are pretty generally felt; could any thing farther be done at present, it would be a public benefit.—</P>
<P>You live in a changeable world. Whatever distinctions there are among men in this world, they will soon be laid aside.—They that are the greatest here, must be brought down to the grave, and mingle with plebian dust. <HI>I said, ye are Gods, but ye shall die like men.</HI>" Rulers are notified of this in the course of providence, as well as in God's word. Every year brings recent instances.—Here I must not forget to bear a due testimony to the memory of the <HI>Honorable Thomas Fitch,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who, for several years, served this colony in the chair, for his uncommon abilities, and many faithful services to this community, and the very respectable character he sustained: in every view, he de∣serves to be had in everlasting remembrance.—The removal, by death, of so great and good a man, tho' he came to his grave in a good old age, should be noticed by all, and, especially, by those in public sta∣tions; the improvement you will make of it will be, to excite your∣selves to greater diligence and fidelity, as <HI>Rulers</HI> and <HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>We wish you all that light and divine communication from the father of lights, and fountain of divine consolation, you need in this
<PB N="22" REF="014383_0021_0F926285B59B8E78"/>
distressing day; and that when these robes of honour that you now wear, shall be laid aside, you may receive a distinguished crown, which shall never fade away.—</P>
<P>In the next place, this address is directed to, My <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> in the Ministry.</P>
<P>Such are the alarming aspects of Divine Providence, at this day, as in all reason should rouse us to a most painful application in the great and arduous trust committed to us.—As members of commu∣nity, our interests are at stake as well as others—whatever, therefore, is proper for us to do in our places, should be diligently attended to; we should encourage our people, and animate them to stand firm in the liberties wherewith GOD, NATURE, and CHRISTIANITY have made them FREE, and never thro' fear of suffering loss, or any temptation, basely give up the rights of Men and Christians; for, as on the one hand, he that in this way, <HI>shall seek to save his life, shall lose it</HI>; so on the other, <HI>he that shall lose his life,</HI> in religiously supporting so good a cause, <HI>shall find it,</HI> and in the end <HI>shall receive an hundred fold.</HI></P>
<P>A zeal, tempered with prudence, under the direction of suitable men at the head of affairs, in opposition to rash attempts, and spi∣rited tumults, should be inculcated—and above all, we should urge a speedy and a universal repentance, as absolutely necessary in or∣der to a well grounded hope of success, in the all wise and gracious providence of God.—It is very affecting, that under such awful re∣bukes of Heaven, there should be prevalent a spirit of carnal secu∣rity.—We should then <HI>blow the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in God's holy mountain</HI>—tell his people it is now high time <HI>to awake out of sleep, and lay hold on God their Maker.</HI>—Let us then, by our prayers, our teachings, examples, and political exhortations, do what God and our people have a right to expect of us—and if God should smile upon our faithful endeavours, we may be instrumental of saving our country from impending ruin, and the souls of our charges from e∣ternal destruction; or should our labours be in vain in regard of these ends, we should at least <HI>save our own souls, and be found glorious in the eyes of the Lord.</HI>—A word to this great Assembly of people, and I have done.</P>
<P>BRETHREN, and FELLOW-CITIZENS,</P>
<P>We rejoice to see the return of this anniversary, tho' it is with trem∣bling. Whether this colony will ever be favoured with another, or if it should, what distresses this year may bring to view, Heaven only knows! and indeed, it is not our business to pry into futurity, or
<PB N="23" REF="014383_0022_0F92628677DB06C8"/>
disquiet ourselves about what may be. <HI>That eagerness of looking farther than we can see, (so natural to us) hath a powerful tendency to mislead us unhappily.—Dangers which we think we discern at a distance, may have no reality, or if they have, may never draw near; dangers that are near, may never reach us: And evils that have reached us, may vanish on a sudden.— These,</HI> says one, <HI>are no reasons against prudent forecast, but they are strong reasons against extracting wretchedness out of speculations on futurity, instead of following quietly and chearfully the proper business of the present day, since</HI> we know not what another may bring forth.—Putting away such anxiety, it is of the highest importance that the people be stea∣dy, firm and resolute; and especially, that they be united in every wise method, at this critical turn of affairs.—We are not to be afraid to espouse and maintain our just rights.—Government is founded in mutual compact;—what induced mankind originally to form such compacts was, the better security of the means of their happiness:— When this end is kept in view, and only pursued, obedience is due to the civil magistrate; but when this end is counteracted, Rulers pervert their authority, to plunder and rob the public; the commu∣nity on all the principles of self-preservation, and divine revelation, have right not only to complain, but arise in opposition to the op∣pressor, and recover their state.—If these principles cannot be sup∣ported, neither can the glorious revolution be justified, nor tyranny ever opposed. We are then not to give up our essential rights to any arbitrary claims whatever.—And while we are determined nobly to contend for our precious privileges, we must be careful we don't run into riots, and crumble into parties among ourselves, or under a pre∣tence of zeal for our country, revenge private injuries, and seek personal preferments.—</P>
<P>Finally, Let us speedily <HI>break off our sins by righteousness, and our iniquities by turning unto the Lord</HI>;—place our entire confidence in his almighty arm, and seek his divine patronage, for <HI>his is the glory and the kingdom, and the victory, and the majesty,</HI> to whom be glory forever, AMEN.</P>
