<P><HI>THE author of the following sermon, for the sake of preserving the memory of some ancient facts, more particularly relative to the town of Springfield, upon application made to him there∣for in the time of his last sickness, consented to the publication of it: But at such a period of his illness that he was unable to pay the least attention to the revising and preparing of it for the press: which, had it been otherwise, no doubt would have appeared to much greater advantage.</HI></P>

<BIBL>JOSHUA IV, 4—7.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man. And Joshua said unto them, pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, what mean you by these stones? Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, when it passed over Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off; and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a great truth, and highly important, that the same GOD who created the universe go∣verns it. We have the fullest evidence that di∣vine providence superintends all human affairs: and that, as GOD is the author of all the good which is enjoyed or seen in this world, so there is no evil in the world and the LORD hath not done it. <HI>He forms the light and creates darkness, he
<PB N="6" REF="018381_0005_0FA703FB37087C58"/>
makes peace and creates evil; the LORD does all these things.</HI> Nothing comes to pass in the world, but by the ordering or permission of divine pro∣vidence. It would be well if we could always maintain a sense of this great truth. But it is lamentably true, that we are very apt to look only at means and instruments, both in mercies and judgments, and take no notice of the hand that steers and conducts all things. I remember to have read a history of a voyage round the world, in which they who made it went through many and great perils and dangers, and were many times most marvellously delivered, and yet, which was a most unpardonable omission, not the least no∣tice taken of GOD or providence. It is certainly our duty and wisdom to be careful observers of the works of divine providence. The psalmist, after mentioning some of the works of providence, says, <HI>Whoso is wise and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the LORD.</HI> Psal. 107, 43.</P>
<P>IT is profitable, not only to observe the occur∣rences of our own day, but to read history, and examine the records of past ages; to take notice of the dealings of divine providence toward for∣mer generations. And while we are reading, we should not forget what the Apostle says when he had been speaking of GOD's dealings towards the ancient Jews. All these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10. 10.</P>
<P>GOD'S dealings with the Jews are one continu∣ed
<PB N="7" REF="018381_0006_0FA703FC0E722E60"/>
series of wonders: and great care was taken in the sacred history, to transmit the knowledge of them to posterity. They are not only registered in the sacred records, but God directed that there should be some visible signs, and lasting monu∣ments erected, to perpetuate the memory of some of his mighty acts. Thus he instituted the passover, to be a memorial of the deliverance of his people out of their Egyptian bondage: and the LORD'S supper, to be an everlasting memori∣al of the death of CHRIST, whereby we are deli∣vered from a bondage infinitely worse than that of Egypt. And when he divided Jordan for his people to go over and take possession of the pro∣mised land, he directed that a monument of stone should be erected, to be a memorial of this mi∣raculous event, and to transmit the knowledge of it down to latest posterity, as we learn from our text.</P>
<P>PRESENT things so engage our attention that we are apt to forget the past; we therefore need some signs, some visible signs, to be remembrancers to us. And it is well that they should be durable signs; otherwise the knowledge of them will die, if not with the present, yet before many generati∣ons are past. The children of Israel therefore were directed to erect a monument of stone, me∣terials which decay not with time, so that if their children in after ages should ask their fathers, what mean you by these stones, they might answer them, that the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, when it passed over Jordan: and these stones were designed to
<PB N="8" REF="018381_0007_0FA703FCB52A32F0"/>
be a memorial of this event. The dividing of Jordan was a very notable miracle, and worthy to be kept in remembrance.</P>
<P>But not only the miraculous works of GOD, but many other works of divine providence, both mer∣ciful and corrective, are worthy to be had in everlasting remembrance. There are no people but what, at one time or mother, are the subjects of remarkable providence; some of remarkable judgments, others of signal mercies and deliver∣ances: these ought to be carefully noticed in the time of them, and faithful annals kept of them, that so children may know what GOD did, for or against their fathers in their day. And it would be well that not only the facts themselves should be registered, but the moral causes both of mer∣cies, and judgments traced out, as far as we are capable of understanding them.</P>
<P>And here lies the peculiar excellency of the sa∣cred history. Many profane historians give us a true and faithful account of the events which hap∣pened in the times of which they wrote; and per∣haps they point out truly the way and manner in, and means by which these events were brought on: but the sacred history, in addition to these, opens and explains to us the moral reasons, why the great governor of the world conferred this public blessing, or granted this signal deliverance, or visited his people with this sore judgment. It is evident to every one who reads his bible, that GOD'S public dealing with the Jews was suited to their moral state. If virtue generally prevailed among them, they flourished and were happy; if
<PB N="9" REF="018381_0008_0FA70401E0EEB5B8"/>
vice and wickedness gained ground among them, they were visited with judgments of one kind or another: and if one judgment was not sufficient to reform them, GOD sent more and heavier, and as he threatened, Levit. 26. punished them seven times more for their sins. When they reformed he lightened his hand; and when they proved fi∣nally incorrigible, he gave them up to utter ruin. And GOD has, I doubt not, dealt much in the same way with other nations of the world, though their historians have been two negligent of mak∣ing observations. They have given a faithful narration of the notable events which have hap∣pened, of the signal mercies and deliverance re∣ceived, and of the calamities suffered, and of the immediate instruments by which they were brought about; but, which I think to have been a very great neglect, the moral causes have not been at∣tended to or noticed by them.</P>
<P>IF the moral state of past ages had been careful∣ly noticed, and the consequent dealings of GOD with them faithfully transmitted down to posteri∣ty, it would have been highly useful to us, and have had, by the blessing of GOD, happy in∣fluence upon our own moral conduct. When we observed that in a course of virtue, our fathers flourished and were happy, it must afford a pow∣erful motive to their children to immitate them in their virtues and tread in their steps. When we saw their failings and their sufferings on that account, it would naturally tend to put us upon our guard, and make us watchful not to split upon the same rock. When we saw how quick the
<PB N="10" REF="018381_0009_0FA7040504DCD3C8"/>
bright morning of prosperity was sometimes suc∣ceeded by a dark night of adversity, and that hours of rejoicing were followed with days, yea months of mourning and weeping, one would sup∣pose that we could not, in a time of prosperity, flatter ourselves that our mountain stands strong, and that we shall never be moved; that to mor∣row shall be as this day and much more abun∣dant: but that we should live constantly depen∣dant upon GOD; and that although we should re∣joice in a day of prosperity, yet we should rejoice as though we rejoiced not. When we took no∣tice of any signal appearances of heaven for our fathers, in consequence of their application to GOD and return to him, it would afford a mighty encouragement to us, to secure an interest in his special love and favour; to cry to him in our straits; and to make our peace with him by a sin∣cere repentance, and thorough reformation. When we read the accounts of the straits, difficul∣ties and dangers which our fathers underwent, and took notice how they were preserved and car∣ried through them, and delivered from them, it would afford the best security against sinking and dispondency in the day of trouble; it would tend to inspire us with courage and fortitude in a time of difficulty and danger. And when we took no∣tice how, when they were ready to faint, GOD supported them, and when they were in perplexi∣ties and knew not what to do, and had their eyes unto him he appeared, and perhaps in ways un∣expected, unthought of, brought deliverance to them, and surprized them with it, so that they
<PB N="11" REF="018381_0010_0FA70406AAD145F0"/>
were like men that dreamed; if any thing will, I should think this would beget a firm unshaken trust in GOD, under the greatest trials and dan∣gers; and excite us to make GOD our refuge at all times, and repair to him, who is a present help in time of trouble: saying as in Hab. 3. 17, 18. 19. <HI>Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vine, though the labour of the olive shall fail; and the field shall yield no meat, and the flock shall be cut of from the field, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the GOD of my salvation. The LORD GOD is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.</HI></P>
<P>THE study of history is very pleasant. There are very few, who have not some curiosity to look back into past time, and make themselves acquaint∣ed with what was done before they were born. And people in general are peculiarly entertained with the history of their own country; they are fond of knowing their own origin, and pleased to be informed of every little incident which befell their own progenitors. We view ourselves as parti∣cularly concerned in the events which befell our par∣ents; &amp; though others may take no share in them, yet children feel themselves deeply interested in them.</P>
<P>I HAVE often heard it lamented, that no more care was taken in the first settlement of this coun∣try, to preserve the memory of the early transac∣tions of our forefathers, of the many hardships and difficulties they endured in this wilderness, of the perils and dangers they endured, of the sig∣nal
<PB N="12" REF="018381_0011_0FA70407384BDD80"/>
deliverances granted to them, and of the dis∣tinguishing blessings conferred upon them, both of a spiritual and temporal nature. It cannot be expected that the history of a new and infant set∣tlement would be filled with the accounts of such armies, battles and revolutions as are to be found in the annals of ancient states and great king∣doms. But however unentertaining a minute, particular history of New-England might be to strangers and foreigners, yet it <HI>would</HI> be read with pleasure by us, and it <HI>might</HI> be read with profit and advantage to us. And perhaps no country of the same age has afforded more remarkables than New-England has to speak of.</P>
<P>IT is now not quite one hundred and fifty six years since our fathers first began to form a settle∣ment at Plymouth. The first settlers were puri∣tans, dissatisfied with the ecclesiastical govern∣ment of the church of England, and scrupulous of conforming to the ceremonies which were in∣joined in their worship. For their non-conformi∣ty they were persecuted in their Ecclesiastical Courts. To escape persecution, they first fled to Holland, and continued some years at Leyden. Disliking their situation there, they concluded to remove to America. In the summer of 1620 they set out on their voyage; and on the ninth of November discovered the land of Cape Cod. They had designed to form a settlement further to the southward; but being brought hither, and the winter near at hand, they concluded to set down here. After beating about upon the coast for divers weeks, and finding no place which
<PB N="13" REF="018381_0012_0FA70407F899E610"/>
suited them to make a settlement in, they at length pitched upon Plymouth; and in the latter end of December they went to work to prepare shelter for themselves, their families and goods.</P>
<P>IT is observed, as a smile of heaven upon them, that contrary to their own intentions they were brought hither; had they gone further southward, as they intended, to Hudson's River, the country was full of savages: but here, GOD had before prepared room for them, by a sweeping pestilence which had depopulated the country.</P>
<P>THERE were no more than one hundred and one souls, who arrived in the harbour of Cape Cod. Winter was now set in, and they were ut∣terly unprovided with every accommodation: and no other English settlement on the continent, than a small poor colony at Virginia; they six or se∣ven hundred miles distant, and not able to afford them any help or relief. Under these circum∣stances, they must have a most dismal prospect: Wherever they turned their eyes nothing but dis∣tress surrounded. However liberty of conscience was, with them, the grand object: they could not enjoy it in England; and if they might only en∣joy it here, it would make amends for all; they therefore engaged with cheerfulness, in the new settlement, and underwent incredible hardships, with fortitude; soon were reduced to great straits, and within five months, one half their number were dead.</P>
<P>BESIDES the natural increase, there were from time to time, some additions made to them, by the arrival of some of their friends from England.
<PB N="14" REF="018381_0013_0FA70408C7F80A00"/>
But although the increase was but small yet it is observable, that whereas divers other attempts had been before made, from purely secular views, to make settlements within what was then called North Virginia, they had failed; this small colo∣ny, who were influenced by religious motives, stood their ground, and were slowly increasing; though greatly distressed; at sometimes threaten∣ed to be cut off by the Natives, at other times greatly straitened for want of bread; if I mistake not, never receiving any supplies from Europe from the very begining.</P>
<P>THUS things went till the year 1628; when the consul for New-England, having obtained a pa∣tent of the lands in the Massachusetts-Bay, sent Mr. Endicott, with his wife and a small company, to begin a settlement at Salem. The next year, they sent three ships full of passengers, amounting to between two and three hundred; and among them four ministers: these safely arrived, and took up their habitation chiefly at Salem; though some of them soon removed to Charlestown, and with them one of the ministers.</P>
<P>IN the spring of the Year 1639, there sailed from England 10 or 11 ships, some of them very large, filled with passengers of every useful occu∣pation, with many live cattle. In this fleet, which safely arrived early in the summer, were many people of substance; among whom were Gover∣nor Winthrop, Deputy Governor Dudley, and many of the patentees of the colony: and I find that William Pynchon Esq. who was Treasurer of the Colony, and father of this town of Spring∣field,
<PB N="15" REF="018381_0014_0FA704097677E8A0"/>
was one among them. Mr. Hubbard, in his history, says, that about this time there was such increase made, by the occasion of many hun∣dreds who every year flocked after them, that in five or six years there were twenty considerable towns built and peopled; and many of the towns first planted became so filled with inhabitants, that like bees they were ready to swarm into new plantations.</P>
<P>ONE of the swarms of which Mr. Hubbard speaks, pitched in this town. It is strange that any, in the then present state of the country, should be willing to be separated so far from their breth∣ren: but so early as May 1635, some of the in∣habitants of Roxbury, Dorchester, New-Town and Watertown prayed the General Court, (then sitting at New-Town, now called Cambridge) that they might have liberty to remove to Con∣necticut River. This was granted to them, pro∣vided they would continue under their jurisdicti∣on. The grant is dated May 6th 1635. In con∣sequence of this grant, the petitioners made their way, with their wives and children, into this wil∣derness, and laid the foundation of the towns of Weathersfield, Hartford, Windsor and Spring∣field.</P>
<P>THEY that planted themselves down in this town came from Roxbury. It seems there were only eight men who came at first, one of which was the before-mentioned William Pynchon Esq. a pattentee of the colony. They were here early in the year 1636. They entered into covenant with each other, which covenant is now upon your
<PB N="16" REF="018381_0015_0FA7040EADA80CA0"/>
public records; it is dated May 14th and signed by William Pynchon and seven others, who pro∣bably did not long continue here, as there is not, nor has been for many years, any of either of the names remaining among us. The first article in the covenant was, that they would, as soon as might be, provide a minister to carry on the work of GOD among them. Though they were thus few in number, in the midst of the savages, not an English inhabitant within twenty miles, and they now beginning a settlement, yet they resolv∣ed not to live without the Gospel; an evidence of a true christian zeal, which does honour to them, and is worthy of the attention and imita∣tion of others.</P>
<P>THEY began well, and GOD blessed their be∣ginnings. Some of their friends soon followed them from Roxbury; and many of the progeni∣tors of the present inhabitants were early here: in∣somuch that, although at their first sitting down, they did not think of having more than forty, or at farthest fifty families, yet I find by your public records, that in February 1664, there were no less than seventy three male inhabitants in the town. And according to their covenant, they did early supply themselves with a worthy minister, the Rev. Mr. George Moxon, who had, before he came to America, received, ordination in the church of England.</P>
<P>AT what time a church was first gathered in the town, I cannot ascertain; but it appears, by your records, that Mr. Moxon was in the town in the year 1637, and continued here with his fami∣ly
<PB N="17" REF="018381_0016_0FA70411D9DB9930"/>
fifteen years, till in the year 1652; when Mr. Pynchon, the father of the town, having received some ill treatment from the province on account of his religious principles, he with Capt. Smith his son in law, went to England, and with them went the minister of the town, the Rev. Mr. Moxon, never to return. This was a day of dark∣ness with this town; I remember to have former∣ly heard some of the aged people, who had it from their forefathers say, that it went near to break up the settlement. But Mr. Pynchon left behind him a son, who was afterward a great bless∣ing and very useful, not only here, but in the province. He lived to an advanced age, was had in the highest veneration by your fathers, and remembered by some who are now living.</P>
<P>AFTER Mr. Moxon's departure, this town was destitute of a settled minister nine years. Mr. Hooker (probably he who afterwards settled at Farmington) for some time preached to the peo∣ple. One Mr. Thompson also preached among them, some part of the time; so that they were not for this space destitute of the gospel. At length Mr. Peletiah Glover a native of Dorches∣ter, came among them. I find by a note of Col. John Pynchon, that the first sermon he preached in the town was on July 3d 1659 from Jer. 4, 14. He continued officiating here till 1661, when he was ordained to the ministry of the town. Mr. Hubbard gives this character of Mr. Glover, that he was a great student, and much given to books. He lived in great harmony with your fathers, and highly esteemed, till March 29, 1692, when he
<PB N="18" REF="018381_0017_0FA70413749DECC8"/>
gave up his charge, and the ghost, and went to rest.</P>
<P>IN his time that great calamity befel the town, which is the special occasion of our assembling this day. From the beginning of the country, our fathers had much trouble from the natives. They were often threatening them, frequently commencing hostilities against them, and many were killed in one place and another; and indeed it is marvelous that they were not all destroyed. If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may New-England say, If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when the Indians rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up, when their wrath was kindled, against us.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it is to be observed, that the peo∣ple on Connecticut River lived in great harmony and peace with their Indian neighbours, till about the year 1675: When Philip's Indians, (this Philip was a great warrior, and a bitter enemy to the English; his place of residence was at Mount Hope, now Bristol) and those called Nipnets, be∣ing driven from the lower parts of the province, came westward; and after destroying Brookfield, mixed themselves with the Indians of this river, and soon disaffected them to the English. The people of this town, and the towns above were a∣larmed, and began to fortify and prepare for their own defence. There were now settlements form∣ed at Westfield, Hadley, Northampton, Hatfield, Deerfield and Northfield: though all weak▪ and especially the two latter.</P>
<P>THE Hadley Indians first of all, deserted their sort and habitations, and joined the enemy. The
<PB N="19" REF="018381_0018_0FA704140BBD7670"/>
English who were under Captains Lothrop, and Bears were so insensed that they pursued them, and had a fight with them, at a place which was then, and is now called Sugar Loaf, opposite to the town of Sunderland; wherein nine or ten of the English were slain, and about twenty six In∣dians. About seven days after on the first of Sept. 1675 they beset the town of Deerfield, killed one man, and laid most of the houses in ashes. Two or three days after, they made an attack upon Northfield, and killed nine or ten of the people; and the rest hardly escaped into the garrisoned house. The next day, Capt. Bears with thirty six men was going to Northfield to secure the garri∣son there, when, about three miles on this side the town, he was waylaid by the enemy, and himself and about twenty of his men were killed, the rest flying back to Hadly. On the eighteenth of the same month, as Capt. Lathrop, with about eighty men, was guarding several carts, laden with corn and other goods, from Deerfield to Hadley, they were suddenly attacked, and almost all cut off, not above seven or eight escaping. On the spot where they were buried, at a place called Muddy-Brook, was erected a monument of stone, which now re∣mains.</P>
<P>THESE things gave some alarm to the inhabi∣tants of Springfield: though they were loath to distrust their own Indians, with whom they had lived in great peace and amity for the space of near forty years. However they were not whol∣ly unprovided: they had some garrisons, though I believe, not more than three in the town. The
<PB N="20" REF="018381_0019_0FA70414C0F842B0"/>
inhabitants treated with the Indians, and received from them, the firmest assurance of their friend∣ship: and the Indians gave some hostages as a security for their peaceable behaviour; which hos∣tages were sent to Hartford, there to remain. These hostages made their escape; and three hun∣dred of Philip's Men were secretly received into the Indian fort upon Long-Hill. Their designs against the town were revealed by a Windsor In∣dian whose name was Toto; tidings of which, were in all haste sent to Springfield in the night: otherwise the inhabitants of the town probably had been cut off, as well as their substance dis∣troyed. The town was thrown into great con∣sternation, by the alarming advice from Windsor, and fled to their garrisons for safety. But two men, more unbelieveing than the rest, (on the morning of the 5th of October 1675, according to old stile, now the 16th, this day one hundred years since) resolved to go to the Indian fort, and see whether these things were so. They set out; but had not come to Mill-River, before the Indians fired upon them, killed one on the spot, and mor∣tally wounded the other: However he got back to a fort at the lower end of the street, and soon died. The Indians immediately set fire to the ungarrisoned houses, and to the barns; and on that day laid almost the whole town in ashes.</P>
<P>DEACON Burt, who was an eye witness, in a note made in the book of records, to purpetuate the memory of this melancholy event, says there were 29 dwelling houses burnt; the number of barns he does not ascertain. Major, afterwards
<PB N="21" REF="018381_0020_0FA7041578EAA9D8"/>
Col. John Pynchon, who a few days before went to Hadley with a few soldiers to take care of the people in those parts, in a letter which he wrote 15 days after the distruction of the town, to his son Joseph then in England, gives a most melan∣choly account of their state; he says there were about 30 or 32 dwelling houses burnt, and 25 barns full of corn and hay; and that although his own dwelling house was spared, his mills and barns and out houses were all consumed, with all his corn and hay; so that he had nothing left for food for man or beast. This letter I have in my hands; and it breathes such a quiet, submissive, patient, excellent spirit, that were there time, I would read the whole of it to you. Doctor Mather says, there were above 30 dwelling houses, and above 20 out houses burnt. Mr. Hubbard says 32 houses were consumed. Whether any build∣ings in this part of the town, except the fortified houses, were saved, I am uncertain. Major Treat soon came from Westfield for their assistance, but for want of boats, could not pass the river. Major Pynchon with some forces from Hadley was with them as quick as possible, but too late to save the town.</P>
<P>BESIDES the two already mentioned, there was one woman killed, and several men wounded, one of which died soon after. There were some few inhabitants at Long-Meadow and I suppose some on the west side of the river; both these escaped.</P>
<P>IT is easy to see that this was a dismal day with the forefathers of this town; that they were re∣duced to great distress. It came upon them at a
<PB N="22" REF="018381_0021_0FA704165AB95AB8"/>
season when all the fruits of the earth were gather∣ed in; so that there year's stock of provision was consumed, and they had little or nothing left for man or beast; and none near them had any thing to spare to them. However, they did not faint: by the good providence of GOD they were carried through the winter. It was said by the ancient peo∣ple, that the following winter was remarkably fa∣vorable; insomuch that they plowed their lands in the midst of winter. The town was soon rebuilt, and returned to its former state; and has never since, suffered greatly by the Indians.</P>
<P>THERE was afterward a <HI>Leonard</HI> killed on the west side of the river; I suppose it was the father of those of that name who now reside there. At Pecowsick were six killed, the spring following the destruction of the town, three outright; two women with their children, who were captivated, were overtaken, and one woman with the chil∣dren killed; the other woman wounded, but re∣covered, and lived to an advanced age. And within the memory of some of you, (July 26 1708) three persons were killed in one house, at Skip∣mug; and a fourth that was captivated was soon after killed, and a lad, Benjamin Wright. Besides these, I do not know that the Indians have done any other mischief, except wounding one or two persons, and captivating a few.</P>
<P>THERE was, in the winter or spring following the destruction of the town, a youth of the name of Edward Stebbins, (the grandfather of some here present) taken captive by the Indians at Long-Meadow; which, because it was attended with
<PB N="23" REF="018381_0022_0FA70416F4E08B78"/>
some important consequences, I particularly men∣tion. He was carried to the Indian head-quar∣ters, which were then at the falls in this river a few miles above Deerfield. This youth with a∣nother whose name was Gilbert, found means to make their escape, and gave notice of the Indians place of rendezvous, and of the security in which they lived. Whereupon Capt. Turner, who, I take it, had the command of the soldiers in the garrisons, and Capt. Holyoke of this town, col∣lecting about 150 men, partly out of the garrisons and partly from among the inhabitants, went a∣gainst them: and a little before break of day on the 19th of May 1676, fell upon the Indians un∣discovered, fired into their wigwams, and killed many on the place, many others in their fright plunged into the river, were carried headlong down the falls, and perished in the waters; and many who took shelter under the bank of the ri∣ver were killed with the swords of our men. Mr. Hubbard says, that Capt. Holyoke killed five here with his own hand. We lost 38 men in this fight: and some of their prisoners afterward own∣ed, that they lost more than 300, some of them principal men, Sachems, and some of their best warriors. It is observed, that they never reco∣vered this defeat, but their ruin immediately fol∣lowed. In reward of this signal service, a town∣ship of land where the fight was, now called Bar∣nardston, was granted to their posterity.</P>
<P>I cannot find that more than ten or twelve per∣sons have been killed by the Indians, within the limits of this town: save that Mr. Hubbard says,
<PB N="24" REF="018381_0023_0FA7041A966C0D20"/>
six or seven of our people, after our mills were burnt, going to mill at Westfield, and going with out arms, three of them were killed by the ene∣my. I have not been able to get any account who they were, nor any further account of this matter.</P>
<P>BUT the town has laboured under other, and grievous calamities at divers times. It is a grie∣vous and mortal sickness which is now among us, and has put many parents into mourning. In the year 1760 and 1761, we were visited with a sore fever, which took of many useful and valuable men, in the midst of their usefulness, and greatly weak∣ened our strength. But the most destressing time the town ever saw by reason of sickness, was in the year 1683, eight years after the town was burnt, (which by the ancient people of the town, was called the sickly winter) when a violent fe∣ver raged in the town, to that degree that there were scarcely enough well to tend the sick; the public worship was for some time suspended, and twenty grown persons died. In the year 1711, there was also a mortal sickness which in the win∣ter season raged here, greatly distressed the people, and carried off a number of the principal men. It was a distressing time with you in the year 1733, when your worthy Pastor, and my Rev. Father &amp; immediate predecessor, Mr. Brown, after having served you in the work of the ministry forty years, died, and with him a number of worthy men. Mr. Brewer was ordained your minister May 16, 1693, and continued with you till Nov. 5th, 1733, when he departed this life.</P>

To him through the providence of GOD, I though unworthy succeeded. The first sermon I preached was on the 26th of May 1734. I re∣ceived ordination January 27th 1735, 6: And though exercised with much weakness and many infirmities, yet having obtained help from GOD, I continue until this time. I suppose, I have liv∣ed with you longer than either of my predecessors; and longer than any minister in any part of the town, except the Rev. Dr. Williams, who is here present in the 83d year of his age, and has nearly compleated the 59th year of his ministry; in a comfortable state of health, and full possession of his intellectual powers, he promises to be useful for years yet to come.</P>
<P>SINCE my entrance into the ministry here 476 have died, 1034 have received baptism, 298 have been admitted to full communion; there are only four, who are now living and continue with us, that were communicants at the time of my ordina∣tion. My work is near to an end: may I ask your prayers, that I may be useful while I live, faithful to death, and then receive the crown of life.</P>
<P>THIS town is now 131 years old. The first settlers expected that the town would contain only 50 families at the most: but I presume there may be, at this day, 600 within the ancient limits of Springfield.</P>
<P>THE town was early divided into two parishes. In June 1698, a church was gathered in the 2d parish, and Mr. John Woodbridge ordained their Pastor. He continued 20 years in the ministry, &amp; died in June 1718. To him succeeded the Rev. Samuel Hopkins, who was ordained pastor June

On the 25th day of the following August, the Rev. Joseph Lathrop was ordained, pastor of that church: he still lives, and has entered upon the 20th year of his ministry.</P>
<P>ON Feb. 17, 1713 Long-Meadow was made a parish: on the 16th of October <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a church was gathered there, and the Rev. Stephen Williams was ordained their pastor.</P>
<P>ON June 24th 1741, a church was gathered in the fourth parish in Springfield; and the Rev. Noah Merick was ordained their pastor. He is still living. This parish was made a town in the year 1763</P>
<P>ON Sept. 27, 1752, a church was gathered in a fifth parish in the town; and the Rev. John Mc. Kinstry was ordained their pastor.</P>
<P>ON Nov. 10, 1762 a church was gathered in a sixth parish in Springfield; and on the 17th the Rev. Silvanus Griswold was ordained their pastor.</P>
<P>ABOUT two years since, another district was made in the town, by the name of Ludlow, which remains destitute of a settled minister. So that there are now, within the ancient limits of this town, seven wor∣shiping assemblies, besides one who profess them∣selves Baptists.</P>
<P>HOW greatly are we increased beyond the ex∣pectation of our forefathers? The first settlers of the town, were they now upon earth, might with propriety adopt the language of Jacob and say, with our staves passed with through this wilderness, and now we are become, not two, but seven bands.</P>
<P>MAY we be suitably affected with all the deal∣ings of divine providence towards our fathers and
<PB N="27" REF="018381_0026_0FA7041C3794C280"/>
us, both merciful and corrective. We have mer∣cies to speak of as well as judgments: we have enjoyed the gospel from the beginning; have had as much health as most towns; and perhaps no town has enjoyed more internal peace, with fewer interruptions, than the ancient town of Springfield. Though we have been divided into several parishes, for many years, and have had distinct interests; yet from my earliest acquaintance with the town, your fathers looked upon one another as brethern, and regard to the public interest was the govern∣ing principle. I have ever thought it a very hap∣py circumstance, that the leading men of this town have, from time to time, been not only men of ability, but really friendly, both to your civil and religious interests.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I have ever esteemed it a smile of Providence, that my lot was early cast in the town of Springfield; and hope I may never have occasion to change my sentiments. I came here in my youth, not 21 years of age; and shall ever retain a grateful remembrance of the candor with which your fathers treated me, and many kind offices which they did me. But few of that generation remain. They are in the grave: and I cannot forbear droping a tear at the remem∣brance of them. They were a worthy set of peo∣ple: but they are gone; and this place which has known them, shall know them no more. And the children are risen up in the stead of their fa∣thers: may you, my dear people, prove yourselves worthy of such ancestors.</P>
<P>How short is human life? How quick does one generation succeed another? there are now
<PB N="28" REF="018381_0027_0FA7041D60F7CDD8"/>
upon the stage, some of the eighth generation of the family of the Pynchons in 139 years. My brethern, former generations are passed away, and this present generation must soon follow them, and make way for others. Within a few years, every single person in this assembly will be in the grave. It is extreme folly in us, to set our hearts upon a world we must so soon leave; and it is our highest wisdom to lay up treasure in heaven; and prepare for that eternal state, which succeeds this short life.</P>
<P>HOWEVER though we should not be careful of the many things of this world, to the neglect of the one thing needful, yet our present prosperity and happiness is not to be wholly overlooked. And we ought to carry our views beyond the time of our own continuance here, and confess the good and happiness of those who shall succeed us on the stage of life. If we regard the happiness of posterity, let us take care to give our children a religious education, and fit them to act their part well upon the theatre of the world, after we are retired to rest and sleep with our fathers.</P>
<P>NEW-ENGLAND has seen days of prosperity, they have al∣so had their seasons of adversity. In their troubles, they trusted in GOD, and he has repeatedly granted them signal deliver∣ances. Our fathers greatest troubles were from the Natives, who, by the instigation of the French were often inserting our frontier settlements. And multitudes have died by their barbarous hands.</P>
<P>When, by the blessing of GOD upon our arms, in the last war with France, Canady was subjected to the obedience of the Crown of Great-Britain, we were ready to flatter ourselves that our troubles were at an end; and that now we should en∣joy continual sunshine and peace: but the clouds are soon ga∣thered again. It is now a day of darkness, not only with New-England, but the cloud has overspread all America: though <HI>we</HI> may expect to bear the weight of the storm. Let us fol∣low the good example of our pious progenitors: wait upon the LORD, and see to it that our ways please him, and we may hope that he will cause the enemies of America to be at peace with us.</P>
