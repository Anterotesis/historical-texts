<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE ensuing Discourse, as it was pre∣par'd and delivered at the more <HI>im∣mediate Instance</HI> of some of you, — so now it sees the Light by the Press, upon the <HI>urgent Desire</HI> of many more; and it is hoped may prove of real Ad∣vantage to <HI>you,</HI> and to <HI>your Children,</HI> not only for your <HI>Information</HI> in <HI>some</HI> Things worthy to be remembred, but also, and more es∣pecially, <HI>in quick'ning</HI> a <HI>holy Emulation</HI> and <HI>commen∣dable Zeal</HI> in following the Example of our <HI>VENERA∣BLE FORE FATHERS</HI> in every Thing that was <HI>Virtuous, Praise worthy,</HI> and of <HI>good Report</HI> in them.</P>
<P>Some (tho' not many) <HI>Alterations</HI> have been made in transcribing for the Press, and a few <HI>short Additions,</HI> which I hope, will by no Means, balk your <HI>Expectations,</HI> but minister to your <HI>Edification.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E are Now, thro' the Sparing, Up∣holding, and Supplying Mercy of our God, arriv'd to the Expiration of <HI>our</HI> FIRST CENTURY, since, the <HI>glori∣ous Head</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> has had a <HI>Church</HI> in this Place.</P>
<P>And seeing that our <HI>Anniversary Solemnity</HI> of THANKSGIVING, hap∣pens near upon the Conclusion of such a Period; I hope that it may prove both <HI>acceptable</HI> and <HI>profitable,</HI> to essay some religious Improvement of both in a Discourse from the Words now read.</P>
<P>You may not expect a large and particular Account of our <HI>Foundation, Rise,</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI>; for to do this, would be to give you a History, more proper for your Entertainment at other Times, than such as are con∣secrated to God's solemn Worship, and for other Places than from the Pulpit.</P>
<P>Neither will my Acquaintance either by <HI>private Records,</HI> or <HI>particular traditional Accounts,</HI> with the special Circumstances of the <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Progress</HI> of this TOWN and CHURCH, furnish me with Matter for such an Undertaking</P>
<P>Nothing further therefore than some brief Hints shall be attempted; by all which I Desire and Hope, that GOD may have the Glory of His <HI>Wisdom, Power, Goodness,</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> in what He has done for Us; in raising from small Beginnings such Enlarge∣ments as at this Day: In appearing for us in our

Mount of Difficulty; <HI>In</HI> supplying us so bountifully all along from the rich Treasures of his Goodness: <HI>And in</HI> bestowing so many valuable and munificent Favours upon us, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and our Fathers have experienced in so long a Course.</P>
<P>And more especially for his renewed Mercies in the <HI>last Year</HI>; upon which Account, to <HI>celebrate God's Praises,</HI> we are in a more particular Manner, call'd to∣gether <HI>this Day.</HI></P>
<P>I would also have this special View in the whole, to <HI>inform</HI> and <HI>instruct</HI> our Children, <HI>the Generation of our Hopes</HI>; and to raise in their Minds, s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ble <HI>Dispositions</HI> of Piety, and <HI>Resolutions</HI> of Godliness, to honour the God of their Fathers, and to cleave to him with full Purpose of Heart, who did such great Things for our <HI>Fore-Fathers,</HI> and therein also, for <HI>us</HI> and <HI>them</HI>; that with Souls full of Love and Zeal and Gratitude, they may say and resolve, <HI>He is our God, and we will praise him; he was our Fathers God, and we will exalt him: This God shall be our God for ever and ever; we will set our Hope in him, and not forget his Works, but keep his Commandments</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Foundation</HI> of our Discourse in the several Verses, now read, is so large and copious that the Time will little more than allow me <HI>to divide</HI> the Text into it's several obvious Branches; <HI>to collect</HI> the plain and evi∣dent Doctrines therein contain'd, <HI>and to draw</HI> the na∣tural and necessary Uses to be made therefrom; which I shall attempt (by divine Help) in as familiar and concise a Method, as I can: And therefore in the Words we may <HI>observe,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>A general and pathetical Call given to the People of God, to hearken to his Law, his Will and his Word.</HI> And</P>

<P N="1">I. <HI>A general and pathetical Call given to the People of God, to hearken to his Law, his Will and his

Word.</HI> Give Ear O my People to my Law, incline your Ears to the Words of my Mouth.</P>
<P><HI>This Psalm</HI> of which our Text is a Part, is <HI>Histori∣cal,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE> it is a Narrative of the <HI>great Mercies</HI> which God had <HI>bestowed</HI> upon <HI>Israel; the great Sins</HI> with which they had <HI>provok'd</HI> him, and the <HI>many Tokens</HI> of divine Displeasure which they <HI>had been under</HI> therefor.</P>
<P>In the foregoing Psalm, the holy Prophet had been relating <HI>God's Wonders of old,</HI> for his own <HI>Encourage∣ment</HI> in a difficult Time. <HI>In this</HI> he resumes the Sub∣ject for the <HI>Edification</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> and enlargeth much upon it; shewing not only <HI>how good</HI> God had been to them, which was an Earnest of further finish∣ing Mercy; <HI>but</HI> how <HI>basely</HI> they had <HI>carried</HI> themselves to God, which <HI>justified</HI> him in <HI>correcting them,</HI> as he did at this Time, and <HI>forbad</HI> all their Complaints.</P>
<P>Our Text is a <HI>Preface</HI> to this Piece of <HI>Church Histo∣ry,</HI> commanding the Attention of the then <HI>present Age,</HI> and recommending it to the Study of <HI>the Generations to come.</HI></P>
<P>And in the <HI>Front</HI> of this <HI>Preface,</HI> the holy Psalmist <HI>demands Attention</HI> to what he was about to deliver. The People of God are call'd upon to hearken to God's Law, his Will and Word: <HI>Give Ear, O my People, to my Law.</HI> Some make these the Psalmist's Words; <HI>Da∣vid</HI> as a King, or <HI>Asaph</HI> in his Name, as his <HI>Secratary</HI> of State, or <HI>Scribe</HI> to the sweet Singer of Israel, here calls upon the People as his People, committed to his Charge, <HI>to give Ear to his Law</HI>: He calls his Instruc∣tions <HI>his Law</HI> or <HI>Edict.</HI> Such was their commanding Force in themselves; every good Truth receiv'd in the Light and Love of it, will have the Power of a Law upon the Conscience.</P>
<P><HI>From this Example</HI> of the royal Psalmist we may note; <HI>That those that are in civil Authority, would do well, as far as is consistent with that Liberty in which Christ hath made us free, to interpose their Power for
<PB N="5" REF="004236_0009_100428007084C6C0"/>
the Edification of the People of God.</HI> Or the Psalmist being a Prophet speaks as God's Mouth, and so calls them his People, and demands Subjection to what was said, as to a Law. <HI>Let him that hath an Ear, thus hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hence</HI> we may <HI>observe</HI> this Note of DOCTRINE, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q>That the Ministers of Christ ought in his Name to call upon the People of God, committed to their Charge, to hearken to his Law, his Will and his Word.</Q>
<P>God's <HI>Law</HI> is his <HI>Will,</HI> reveal'd in his <HI>Word</HI>; to this God's People ought to hearken; that is, to <HI>submit</HI> to the Power and Authority of it, and <HI>to yield</HI> a chearful Obedience to it. <HI>And to this Exercise of Godliness,</HI> the Ministers of Christ ought to quicken and stir up the People of God under their Care and Watch: <HI>To this we are directed</HI> by the Example in our Text; for what was written afore Time was written for our Instruction and Admonition: The Writings of the Old and New Testament were given by Inspiration of God, &amp; that for our Learning; <HI>For they are profitable for Doctrine, for Re∣proof, for Correction, and Instruction in Righteousness; that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnish'd unto every good Work.</HI> And agreeably says the Apos∣tle <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>James</HI> 5.10.</NOTE> <HI>Take my Brethren, the Prophets who have spoken in the Name of the Lord, for an Example:</HI> And this we should do, not only in their <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and in their <HI>Patience,</HI> but also in their <HI>holy Living,</HI> their <HI>examplary Conversation,</HI> and <HI>imitable Services</HI> to the People of God, in the <HI>fulfilment</HI> of <HI>their Commission.</HI> We should be Followers of them, wherein they have been Exam∣ples of the Things which are <HI>Virtuous</HI> and <HI>Praise worthy</HI> and of <HI>good Report</HI>; of <HI>Holiness</HI> of Life, of <HI>Purity</HI> of Doctrine <HI>Zeal</HI> for God, and <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in fulfilling the Ministry committed to them, and in Discharge of their Office as <HI>Watchmen</HI> upon the Wall.</P>
<P>And as <HI>the Minister's Duty</HI> is herein declar'd with
<PB N="6" REF="004236_0010_1004280632BE2490"/>
respect to those under his Watch; <HI>viz.</HI> To <HI>admonish</HI> and <HI>quicken</HI> them to <HI>receive</HI> the <HI>Instructions</HI> of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and to <HI>hearken diligently</HI> to the <HI>Words of God's Mouth; so is the Peoples Duty also herein,</HI> very plainly and fully intimated to them, namely their <HI>Subjection</HI> and <HI>Obedience.</HI> If <HI>we</HI> are in Christ's Name to call upon God's People <HI>to hearken to the Words of his Mouth,</HI> the Ob∣ligation is as strong on <HI>you</HI> to attend, <HI>to give earnest heed to those Things that are spoken lost at any Time you let them slip,</HI> and to submit to the Force &amp; Power of that Authority, who enjoins our Observation of his Will, for he is our <HI>God,</HI> our <HI>Maker,</HI> our <HI>Preserver,</HI> our <HI>Law-giver,</HI> and our <HI>Judge</HI>; he has an undoubted Propriety in us, and an indisputable Right to dispose of us, and his Will ought to be our Rule.</P>
<P>Hence then by Way of <HI>Application,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>We see the necessary and incumbent Duty both of Ministers and People. Ministers</HI> are to call upon those under their Care and Charge, <HI>to give Ear to God's Law, and to incline their Ears to the Words of his Mouth</HI>; to know and to do that which is right, and that which the Lord their God requires of them. <HI>And the People</HI> are not at their Liberty <HI>whether they will hear, or whe∣ther they will forbear:</HI> Their absolute Duty lying upon them to receive Instruction, and to hearken to the Counsels of God. Hence.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Those Ministers are chargeable with Unfaithfulness, who neglect thus to address their People; and those un∣der their Care who refuse to hearken when thus address'd, are guilty of a shameful Disregard of God, his Will and Law.</HI> Ministers are to do more than entertain their People with Speculations, and preach to them the doctrinal Articles of Faith; there is the <HI>Rule of Duty,</HI> the <HI>Precepts of Holiness,</HI> which they are to urge and press with all Seriousness and Cogency, and they cannot be faithful without so doing; they a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to reprove, re∣buke, and exhort with all Long suffering, and Doc¦trine: And if their People refuse to hear and obey, the Word of God thus delivered to them in his Name, and according to his Direction; they disregard God
<PB N="7" REF="004236_0011_10042807BB0E02F0"/>
himself, his Authority, and Will; for they that receive Christ's Messengers, receive Him, and they that receive their Messages which are agreable to the Analogy of Faith, and the Doctrines of Godliness, receive his; and they that reject them, reject him, <HI>they dispise not Men, but God</HI>; and if they reject Christ and receive not his Words, <HI>they have one that will judge them, the Word that he hath spoken, the same shall judge them in the last Day</HI> Wherefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us now, in God's Name and Fear, apply our∣selves to that which the Lord our God requires of us, in our respective Characters.</HI> And now; may the <HI>glo∣rious Head of the Church,</HI> abundantly <HI>furnish</HI> me with his <HI>Word,</HI> from Time to Time, <HI>agreable</HI> to your more <HI>special Circumstances,</HI> a Word of <HI>Instruction, Reproof, Exhortation,</HI> and <HI>Counsel</HI>: and having <HI>God's Word</HI> may I be enabled to speak <HI>his Word</HI> in the <HI>Demonstration</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and with <HI>Power,</HI> agreable to the <HI>lively Ora∣cles,</HI> with <HI>Seriousness, Gravity,</HI> and <HI>Solemnity,</HI> and with special and pertinent <HI>Application</HI> to the <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Condition</HI> of <HI>your Souls,</HI> seeking your Good, your <HI>spiri∣tual Profit</HI> and <HI>Advantage,</HI> your <HI>Edification</HI> and <HI>Salva∣tion,</HI> and not any <HI>vain Glory</HI> or <HI>Applause</HI> of Men; <HI>you</HI> also being my <HI>Helpers,</HI> by your <HI>fervent Addresses</HI> to God for me, that I may <HI>obtain Grace</HI> to be <HI>faithful,</HI> and <HI>find Mercy</HI> of the Lord to be <HI>successful.</HI> Thus to serve you and your's (by the Help of God) is my <HI>earnest Desire,</HI> in what may be attempted, in the <HI>following Articles</HI> of <HI>Discourse,</HI> upon this <HI>Occasion,</HI> that God's Name may be glorified, and our Souls nourish'd by the sincere Milk of the Word.</P>
<P>Wherefore to proceed — Let me <HI>observe,</HI></P>
<P N="2">II <HI>The Reasons given by the holy Prophet in our Text, to urge the Peoples Duty upon them, in at∣tending to the Instructions and Admonitions he was about to deliver to them in God's Name.</HI></P>
<P>And these were <HI>Three,</HI> viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Things to be discours'd of were weighty.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>That they were Things of an ancient Date.</HI> And</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That they were Things in which Posterity were
<PB N="8" REF="004236_0012_1004280CD20C1630"/>
concern'd.</HI> All which render them worthy of Regard and Attention.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first Reason given in our Text, by the in∣spir'd Messenger of God, to urge the Peoples Duty upon them, in attending to the <HI>Instructions,</HI> and <HI>Admo∣nitions</HI> which he was about to give them in God's Name, is, <HI>that the Things to be discours'd of were weighty, and therefore deserve Consideration</HI> I will open my Mouth in a Parable, in that which is <HI>sublime</HI> and <HI>un∣common</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE> but very <HI>excellent</HI> and <HI>well worthy your At∣tention:</HI> I will utter dark Sayings, which <HI>challenge</HI> your most <HI>serious Regards.</HI> These are call'd dark Say∣ings, not because they are hard to be understood, but because they are greatly to be admir'd, and carefully to be look'd into: This is said to be fulfil'd in the Parables which our Saviour put forth, <HI>Matt.</HI> 13 35. which were (as this) Representations of the State of the Kingdom of God among Men. <HI>The Passages of this subsequent Narrative,</HI> which the Psalmist would utter with all Freedom and Plainness are styl'd <HI>Parables</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Pool.</NOTE> and <HI>dark Sayings,</HI> not from their <HI>Unintelligibleness,</HI> but by Reason of their <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Weight,</HI> and being of <HI>great Moment</HI> for the Peoples <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Advan∣tage</HI>; and because the Things contain'd in them, con∣cerning God's <HI>transcendent Goodness</HI> to an unworthy People; and their <HI>unparrallel'd Ingratitude</HI> for, and Abuse of, such eminent Favours, and their <HI>stupid Igno∣rance</HI> and <HI>Insensibleness,</HI> under such excellent and con∣stant Teachings of God's Word and Works, are indeed <HI>prodigious</HI> and <HI>hard to be believ'd.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we may observe this Note of <HI>Doctrine, viz.</HI></P>
<Q>That God's Word and Providences, the Ordinances, Com∣mandments, and Laws of his Kingdom, both of Na∣ture and Grace, are Things of infinite Moment and Concern to us.</Q>
<P>Herein is contained the Whole of Man, respecting his <HI>present useful Being,</HI> and his <HI>future Comfort and Hap∣piness.
<PB N="9" REF="004236_0013_100403BAC592C5E8"/>
God's Word</HI> contains all Things necessary for him to know, believe, and practice, in order to his Fruition of the best Good, which will never end, after a Period is put to his short Abode in this World. <HI>God's Providences</HI> are Discoveries of his Wisdom and Power, and of his Kindness and Favour in <HI>upholding all Things,</HI> and in their <HI>universal Government,</HI> wherein he many Times shews himself strong, on the Behalf of them that fear him; and sometimes for their Instruction and Ad∣monition; and to vindicate the Honour of his own Holiness and Justice, he displays his Indignation in the Executions of his Wrath upon bold and incorrigible Sinners.</P>
<P>And in all this, wherein the <HI>Ordinances, Command∣ments,</HI> and <HI>Laws,</HI> of the Kingdom of Nature and Grace are exhibited and displayed to us, there are Things of <HI>infinite Moment</HI> and <HI>Concern</HI> to us; Things great and weighty and worthy of our <HI>Consideration</HI> and <HI>utmost di∣ligent Attention:</HI> For what can concern us more, than to know <HI>God</HI> and <HI>ourselves,</HI> our <HI>Duty</HI> and our <HI>Happi∣ness.</HI> More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God's Word and Providences are weighty Things, and will appear to be of infinite Moment and Concern to us, if we consider their glorious Author,</HI> THE ETERNAL GOD.</P>
<P>He rules in the Kingdom of Providence and Grace: He utters his Voice, and lo! a <HI>mighty Voice,</HI> and a <HI>gracious Voice,</HI> in his <HI>providential Dispensations,</HI> and in <HI>his holy Word.</HI></P>
<P>The Instructions, Precepts, Promises, and Threat∣nings of the Word of God, are all a Copy of his adore∣able Perfections, who is infinite in <HI>Wisdom, Holiness, Justice, Goodness,</HI> and <HI>Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>God's Works</HI> of Creation, Providence, and Grace, they are holy, tho' wonderful, and to be sought into, tho' unsearchable, and his Ways righteous, tho' mysterious, and past finding out.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore</HI> we should consider with whom it is we have to do, and remember that <HI>we cannot by Searching find out God, that we cannot find out the Almighty unto
<PB N="10" REF="004236_0014_1004280E86F71C90"/>
Perfection. Secret Thing belong to God; but those that are reveal'd, to us and to our Children, that we may do all the Words of his Law.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God's Word and Providences are weighty Things, and will appear to be of infinite Moment and Concern to us, <HI>if we consider their important Design, to instruct and direct, rule and govern us, according to his holy and sovereign Will.</HI></P>
<P>All that the <HI>glorious God</HI> says and does in his Word and in his Works, is agreable to the Perfection of his Nature: And so far forth as they refer to us, they are for our <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Direction, Rule</HI> and <HI>Government</HI>; that we may know God and our Duty, and be kept from the abominable Things which his Soul hates, and be preserved in his Love and Favour; which must needs render these Things of infinite Moment to us. <HI>But in a Word, for I can but just mention what might be enlarg'd upon,</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. These Things are of the last Concern to us, and will appear to be so, if we consider <HI>their End; the Glory of God, our Comfort here, and our Eternal Happi∣ness hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>This is the <HI>grand End,</HI> which the <HI>great God propo∣ses</HI> in all the <HI>Exertments</HI> of himself, viz. <HI>his own Glory,</HI> He made all Things, he upholds all Things, he or∣ders and disposes of all Things as he pleases, and all for the Advancement of his own Honour; and the Re∣velation which he hath made of himself in his written Word, is in the first Place for the same glorious Pur∣pose, for God can have no higher End than himself, who is the first and the last, the beginning and the End. <HI>And subordinately</HI> he <HI>proposes</HI> the <HI>Good</HI> of <HI>his Creatures,</HI> and will make every Thing to work toge∣ther for the Good of his Chosen. They shall conspire for their Advancement in Grace, and to prepare them for the Life of Glory, which he will bestow upon all such, <HI>who by patient Continuance in Ways of Well-doing, seek for Glory, Honour and Immortality.</HI> God's Word and his providential Dispensations have all a Tenden∣cy to this, with respect to those who make a right
<PB N="11" REF="004236_0015_1004281418EF58B8"/>
Improvement of them; wherefore they must needs be of infinite Moment and Concern to us, and upon that Account demand our most careful and diligent Atten∣tion: <HI>These Things</HI> are <HI>Weighty,</HI> and <HI>deserve our Consi∣deration</HI> God<HI>'s Word</HI> is so, his <HI>Works</HI> are so, and <HI>di∣ligently to be sought out of all them that take Pleasure in them</HI></P>
<P>Hence we <HI>Infer,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How reasonable it is, that we yield Obedience to the Demands of God, in giving the most earnest Heed to the Instructions and Admonitions, given us from his Word and Works.</HI></P>
<P>This is consistent with the highest Reason, and we can have nothing to object against it. We are depen∣dent Creatures, and accountable Creatures, and our chiefest Interests are much concerned in our yielding such Obedience. Wherefore it is highly reasonable that we should so do.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Hence how pleasant and delightful should it be to us to give such Attention to the Instructions and Admonitions of God's Word and Works</HI></P>
<P>We should do it with all Chearfulness and readiness of Mind. Our Submission to the glorious God in such an important Article, should be the Joy and Rejoyc∣ing of our Hearts, for in nothing can we take wiser Measures, nor more directly consult our own present Comfort and future Peace</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence how profitable such an Attention to the Word and Works of God would be to us.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Way to engage the favourable Presence of God with us, in which alone our Safety, Comfort, and Success is comprehended; and this is the Way to be receiv'd to the Rewards of Grace, in which is the Life of our Souls, and the Happiness of Eternity: See the Reasonableness, Pleasure, and Profit of Obedi∣ence.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Hence also the Folly and Absurdity of disregarding the Calls of God from his Word and Works.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Folly</HI> is bound up in the Hearts of such as do so they take the most direct Steps to their own Ruin. <HI>Mad∣ness
<PB N="12" REF="004236_0016_10042819B514A368"/>
is in their Hearts while they live, and after that they go to the Dead,</HI> and to the Damned.</P>
<P>In a Word.</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>How just is the Ruin, and how dreadful will the Destruction be of such as refuse Attention to the Calls of God, from his Word and Works, in which are contain'd Things of such Weight, and of the last Moment and Im∣portance to them.</HI></P>
<P>Such cast the Counsel of God behind their Backs; and such may justly expect, that because they regard not the Works of the Lord, and the Operations of his Hands; He will destroy them, and not build them up; and that because they refuse to hearken to his Calls, that he will laugh at their Calamity, when Snares, Fire and Brimstone, shall be made the Portion of their Cup; for on such Wicked, God will rain a most horrible Tempest <HI>And concerning such his Enemies, he will say, bring them hither and slay them before me.</HI> And Oh! who can stand before his Indignation, who can abide the Fierceness of his Anger. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen his Fury shall be poured out like Fire.</P>
<P>Pase we to</P>
<P N="2">2 Another Reason given in our Text to urge the Peoples Duty upon them, in attending to the <HI>In∣structions</HI> and <HI>Admonitions</HI> which were to be given to them in God's Name, <HI>viz That the Things which were to be discours'd of, were of ancient Date.</HI></P>
<P>They were the Monuments of Antiquity, dark Say∣ings of old, <HI>which we have heard and known, and which our Fathers have told us</HI> They are Things of undoubt∣ed certainty, <HI>We have heard them and known them</HI>; and there is no Room left to question the Truth of them.</P>
<P>The Gospel of Luke is call'd a <HI>Declaration of the Things which are most surely believ'd among us,</HI> Luk. 1.1, so were the Things which the Psalmist was about to relate.</P>
<P>The Honour we owe to our <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Ancestors,</HI> obligeth us to attend to that which our Fathers have told us, and as far as it appears to be true and good, to receive it with so much the more Reverence and Regard.
<PB N="13" REF="004236_0017_100403BCC0648660"/>
There is both <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Pleasure</HI> in being inform'd of Things of ancient Date, that are of <HI>undoubted Verity,</HI> and of <HI>Moment</HI> and <HI>Importance.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we may observe this Note of <HI>Doctrine, viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That it is a very agreable and useful entertainment to refresh our Minds with the Remembrance of what God has done for us in our Day, and with his Dealings to∣wards our Ancestors, which were perform'd in the Days of old; in the Times of ancient Generations.</HI></P>
<P>It is exceeding pleasant to ingenious and inquisitive Minds to reflect upon the <HI>Observables of divine Pro∣vidence,</HI> within the Compass of their <HI>own Knowledge</HI>; and also to be entertain'd with those of <HI>ancient Date,</HI> which were remark'd in the <HI>Days</HI> of their <HI>Fore Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not say any Thing to demonstrate the Pleasure that there is herein, the bare repeating the Text car∣ries its own Evidence along with it to all such whose Minds are of this Stamp; and <HI>Herculean</HI> Labour would be but Labour lost, to endeavour to form a relishing Idea thereof in the Minds of such as are of another Mould.</P>
<P>Wherefore I pass to say, that it may be a very use∣ful and profitable Entertainment to relish our Minds with what God has done for us in our Day, and with his Dealings towards our Ancestors, which were per∣form'd in the Days of old; and to show that in several Ways, and for several Ends and Purposes it may be so.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To fix in our Minds a just Remembrance of the great and good Things, God hath done for us, and for our Progenitors.</HI></P>
<P>Thus says the inspir'd Penman in our Text, ver 4. <HI>Shewing to the Generation to come, the Praises of the Lord, and his Strength, and the wonderful Works that he hath done.</HI> We should not presently forget the merciful Appearances of God for us, or ours, it is an Argument of Ingratitude if we do; neither should we soon let slip the awful Tokens of God's Displeasure in any Instance, <HI>by Means of which our Flesh has been made to tremble</HI>; but we should lay up the remarkable
<PB N="14" REF="004236_0018_1004281C8ED151D8"/>
Occurrences of divine Providence for future Improve∣ment; and frequently to renew the Idea of them in our Minds, can't but have a Tendency to fix them in the <HI>Thoughts of the Imagination of our Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Again</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>To stir up in us a holy Fear of God and a Dread of his Wrath</HI></P>
<P>Among the Purposes of Heaven in the Discoveries of the divine Displeasure, in the Executions of Ven∣geance, this is one, <HI>that others may hear and fear,</HI> may thereby be admonish'd and take Warning. We ought to fear that holy and dreadful Name, the LORD OUR GOD. We should have such an Aw of the Majesty of Heaven▪ and such a Dread of his Wrath, as to make us very cautious of doing any Thing to provoke him to come forth against us in Anger Now a <HI>serious Reflection</HI> upon what God has done, either in our own Day, or in ancienter Times, to punish his People for their Rebellions against him, may have, and surely it ought to have this <HI>Influence</HI> and <HI>Effect</HI> upon us, thro' a holy Fear of God, to <HI>avoid</HI> those <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Practi∣ces</HI> which were so provoking to the God of Heaven, that for the Honour of his great Name, he hath visited his People with sore Judgments and Calamities. This is particularly intimated to us in our Text, ver. 8. — <HI>and might not be as their Fathers, a stubborn and rebellious Generation, a Generation that set not their Heart aright, and whose Spirit was not stedfast with God.</HI> Further,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This may be of Use and Service to excite our Love, and increase our Gratitude to the ever blessed God</HI></P>
<P>The many kind Things that Heaven has done for us and for our Fathers, should influence us to love our most gracious and bountiful Benefactor, and should enlarge our Hearts in Gratitude to him <HI>Every Day is a Witness for God that he is good, and does good</HI>; and calls for our constant and persevering Returns of Love and Gratitude. But there are some remarkable Inter∣positions of Favour and Goodness which demand our most special and peculiar Notice; <HI>eminent</HI> and <HI>signed
<PB N="15" REF="004236_0019_1004281FA1E75A10"/>
Appearances</HI> of divine Favour, call for more <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>enlarged Returns</HI>: And many such there have been, if we did but duly attend to them in our own <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and in the Days of our Fathers, which are very loud Calls to us, to love the Lord our Preserver and Benefactor, and to render to him, our grateful Ac∣knowledgments, according to the Benefits done unto us And a <HI>due Reflection</HI> upon these Things may have a <HI>special Tendency</HI> to stir us up to our Duty herein, and thereby greatly turn to our Advantage. Ver. 4 <HI>We will not bide them from their Children shewing to the Generation to come the Praises of the Lord, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>To encourage us to put our Trust in God, and to make him our Hope and Confidence at all Times.</HI></P>
<P>He that has deliver'd can deliver, and if our Ways please him he will yet deliver He has been, and is, the <HI>Hope of his Israel, and their Saviour in Times of Trouble</HI>; great and marvellous have been his Works of Salvation; and the Lord Jehovah is still an inex∣haustible Fountain of Goodness, and in him there is everlasting Strength. And this is one End of such a Re∣flection, particularly pointed at in our Text, ver. 7. <HI>That we might set our Hope in God.</HI> If we make God's Commandments our Rule, we may make his Covenant our Stay, for he is never unmindful thereof.</P>
<P>Further,</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>Such a Reflection may be of great Use and Service, to awaken in us a suitable Care, to conform our Tempers and Manners to the holy Will and Law of God, that we may engage his gracious Presence with us, and obtain his Blessing upon us.</HI></P>
<P>This has been God's Manner, he will be with his People in a Way of Mercy and Blessing, while they adhere to him in a Way of Duty and Obedience. This we are assur'd of, from the Declarations of God's Word, and from the History and Method of his provi∣dential Dispensations: thus we read, 2 Chron. 15 1, 2. <HI>And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the Son of Obed, and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him,
<PB N="16" REF="004236_0020_1004282565AA3E10"/>
Hear ye Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you while you be with him, and if you seek him, he will be found of you.</HI> Wherefore if we regard the Favour of Heaven, and in that our own Interest, such a serious Reflection will have a Tendency to engage our Regards to the Will and Law of God, a∣greable to which are those Passages in our Text, v. 5.6. and 7. <HI>For he established a Testimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Israel, which he commanded our Fa∣thers, that they should make them known to their Chil∣dren. That the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which should be born: Who should a∣rise and declare them to their Children. That they might set their Hope in God, and not forget the Works of God; but keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>A suitable Review of the great and good Things which the ever blessed God hath done in our Day, and in the Days of our Fathers, may be of Use and Benefit to our Posterity, that they may inform'd of the Works of God, and call'd upon, not to forget the Hope of their Fa∣thers, nor be unmindful of his Law</HI>; which for Encou∣ragement duly to observe, he has so signally appear'd in Ways of Mercy; and for the Breach of which, he hath come forth in Anger, and marched thro' the midst of his People in Indignation.</P>
<P>But this Advantage of a due Notice of the Remark∣ables of Providence, is to be the Subject of a distinct Head, and therefore may be more particularly consi∣der'd by and by.</P>
<P>I shall therefore only add here, upon the whole of what has been offer'd under this Note of Doctrine, That for such sacred Purposes as the <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Ad∣monition</HI> of the <HI>present</HI> and <HI>succeeding Generations,</HI> in the Fear, and Love of God, and Obedience to his Law; we have many Instances in our Bibles, of Re∣hearsing the wonderful Works of God both present and former.</P>
<P>If I should pretend to give you the Narratives at large, they would stretch my Discourse beyond due
<PB N="17" REF="004236_0021_100403BE48781B28"/>
Bounds: I shall therefore, only direct you to the Passages, and desire that you would read and peruse them at your Leisure.</P>
<P>To this Purpose is <HI>Moses</HI>'s divine Song, <HI>Exod.</HI> 15. when Israel triumph'd over their Enemies who were drowned in the Red Sea. And a great Part of the Book of Duteronomy is taken up with such Accounts, and with solemn Calls and Exhortations there from to Obedience, particularly the 3d, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 29th Chapters, and to the same End is the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> in the 32 Chap. which setteth forth God's Mer∣cy and Vengeance, and concludes with this Exhortati∣on, <HI>Set your Hearts unto all the Words which I testify among you this Day, which ye shall command your Chil∣dren to observe and do, all the Words of this Law: For it is not a vain Thing for you because it is your Life, and thro' this Thing ye shall prolong your Days in the Land whether ye go over Jordan to possess it.</HI> With the same pious Design, <HI>Joshua</HI> the Captain and Leader of Israel, exhorting the People of God before his Death, and gave them a Narrative of God's Dealings with them. See <HI>Josh.</HI> 23 and 24 Chap This also is the Run and this the Intention of the Testimony of <HI>Samuel</HI> the Lord's Prophet, against Israel, after they had ask'd a King. See 1 Sam. 12▪ Chap. And many other Instances of the like Nature we have in the Book of Psalms: Thus the Psalm of which our Text is a Part, and to which Piece of Church History it is a solemn Preface: And so <HI>Psal.</HI> 105. in which we are directed to praise God for his special Favours to his Church, an Enumeration of which is therein given; and to the same Purpose is Psal. 136.</P>
<P>In the New Testament also such useful Narratives are not wanting; you remember Stephen the Proto-Martyr's Defence, when accus'd of Blasphemy, <HI>Acts</HI> 7. And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in the 11 Chap▪ to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> relates the Wonders of Faith which the ancient Fa∣thers and People of God were Instances of, and as a Consequence there from, begins his 12 Chapter with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> seeing we also are compossed a∣bout

with so great a Cloud of Witnesses, let us lay aside e∣very Weight, and the Sin that doth so easily beset us, and let us run with Patience, the Race that is set before us.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have endeavour'd doctrinally to show you the <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Advantage</HI> of a <HI>serious Reflection</HI> on the great and good <HI>Things</HI> which the <HI>glorious God</HI> hath <HI>done,</HI> in the <HI>Course</HI> of his <HI>Providence,</HI> whether <HI>formerly</HI> or <HI>more lately.</HI></P>
<P>And now by Way of <HI>Application,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We hence see both the Necessity and Expediency of a serious Reflection and Meditation upon God's Provi∣dential Dispensations, whether of later or ancienter Date.</HI></P>
<P>If there be so much Profit and Advantage in it, sure∣ly then it's both necessary and expedient. It is <HI>neces∣sary,</HI> for it is our Duty with <HI>Regard to God,</HI> that we may give him the Glory that is due to his Name. And <HI>with Regard to ourselves,</HI> that we may behave and con∣duct ourselves in a becoming Manner, agreable to our Character as the People of God, who own their De∣pendance upon him and acknowledge his Propriety in them, and their Obligations to him, who have their Hope in him, and their Expectations from him. <HI>And it is expedient,</HI> for the Pleasure and the Advantage of it, renders it highly so. If we consult our own Interest, we shall thus regard the Works of the Lord and consider the Operations of his Hands.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>According</HI> to our <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>agreable</HI> to the <HI>Examples</HI> of such a <HI>Practice,</HI> which have been pro∣duc'd; and with a <HI>sincere View</HI> to the same <HI>good Pur∣poses. Let us look back and consider the Works of the Lord, and the Wonders which he hath done in our Day and in the Days of our Fathers.</HI> But it must be in a few general brief Hints, for a large Volume would not more than suffice to contain the Particulars.</P>
<P>And here allow me,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To give you some short Account of our Foundation, Rise, and Growth, with some Remarkable of Providence, worthy to be taken Notice of, in such a Relation.</HI></P>
<P>And then,</P>

<P>In the first Place,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>I am to give you some short Account of our Founda∣tion, Rise and Growth, with some Remarkables of Pro∣vidence, worthy to be taken Notice of in such a Relation.</HI></P>

<P>"To encourage and strengthen them to submit to the many <HI>Toils, Hazards</HI> and <HI>vast Expence</HI> in subduing and planting a <HI>Wilderness,</HI> they were favour'd with the <HI>Royal Grant</HI> of a CHARTER by which they were vested with several <HI>Powers, Liberties,</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> for their <HI>good Order</HI> and <HI>Government.</HI></P>
<P>"Under the <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>Royal Charter</HI> in which they entirely confided, for the Security of the <HI>Liberties</HI> therein granted, they were animated chear∣fully to undergo <HI>unknown Perils and Hardships,</HI> which were unavoidable in their first Plantations, by which a <HI>valuable Accession</HI> has been made to the <HI>British Do∣minions,</HI> and the <HI>Commerce</HI> of GREAT BRITAIN en∣larg'd, without any <HI>Charge</HI> to the <HI>Crown.</HI></P>

<P>"After the <HI>happy Revolution,</HI> those <HI>glorious Princes</HI> King WILLIAM and Queen MARY, of <HI>immortal Me∣mory,</HI> were pleas'd in their <HI>Princely Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> by their <HI>Royal Charter</HI> to <HI>unite</HI> and <HI>erect</HI> into <HI>one Pro∣vince,</HI> the <HI>Colonies</HI> of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay, New Ply∣mouth</HI> &amp;c by the Name of the <HI>Province</HI> of the MASSA∣CHUSETTS BAY in NEW-ENGLAND, which was to be <HI>govern'd</HI> by a <HI>Governour, Council</HI> and <HI>Assembly.</HI></P>

<P>But I leave these Things of a general Purport, and pass to consider some Things more immediately refer∣ring to ourselves.</P>
<P>According to the Account which I have receiv'd, The Town of DEDHAM was the 16th or 18th Settle∣ment from the first Beginning of the Country.</P>
<P>It was petition'd for as a Township in 1636, and desir'd that it might be call'd CONTENTMENT, which Name I doubt not was ask'd for <HI>some special Reason,</HI> and likely enough to denote the <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Disposi∣tion</HI> of the then Inhabitants. <HI>However</HI> when the Grant was made, it was call'd by its present Name.</P>
<P>Our Church Records say, "The Township of <HI>Dedham</HI> consisting of about 30 Families, residing there 1637, be∣ing come together by divine Providence from several
<PB N="24" REF="004236_0028_1004283D95B5C510"/>
Parts of <HI>England</HI>; few of them known to one another before."</P>
<P>And being thus incorporated into a <HI>civil Society,</HI> and invested with the same Privileges that others enjoyed, they soon bethought themselves about a <HI>Church State,</HI> for it was that, that their Hearts were principally upon.</P>
<P>Agreably it is added in our ancient Records.</P>
<P>"It was thought meet and agreed upon, that all the Inhabitants that affected Church Communion, or pleas∣ed to come, should meet every 5th Day of the Week at several Houses, in order lovingly to <HI>discourse</HI> and <HI>consult</HI> together of such Questions as might further tend to stablish a peaceable and comfortable civil So∣ciety; and prepare for spiritual Communion in a Church State. <HI>Partly</HI> that we might be further acquainted with the <HI>Tempers,</HI> Spirits and Gifts of one another; and <HI>partly</HI> that we might gain further Light in the Ways of Christ's Kingdom, and the Government of his Church." &amp;c.</P>
<P>And in the Pursuit of this Method, they prepar'd for, and at length came into a Church State in a very se∣rious and solemn Manner.</P>
<P>A particular Account of the Measures taken and of the Manner of their Combination is preserv'd to us by the Care and Pains of that Rev. and venerable Genleman Mr. JOHN ALLIN, your first Pastor: And whoever reads it, must allow, that there is in it a full Discovery of a sincere Regard to the <HI>Glory</HI> of God, and to their own <HI>spiritual Edification</HI> in the Ways of God, (according to a Judgment of Charity) a strict Regard to <HI>Holiness</HI> of Life, and a great Care to maintain the <HI>Unity of the Spi∣rit</HI> in the Bond of Peace. That there was much of the <HI>Presence of God</HI> with them, and that having their Hearts enlarg'd with the <HI>Consolations</HI> of God, they ran in the Ways of his <HI>Commandments</HI> with <HI>Chearfulness</HI> and <HI>Constancy,</HI> and held fast their <HI>Integrity.</HI></P>

And</HI> let this shame us out of our <HI>Regardlessness</HI> to that which is better than <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Farms.</HI></P>
<P>Is not the Disesteem of Learning too evident in a prevailing Temper (was it not for the Law of the Pro∣vince) to be wholly without a <HI>Grammar School</HI>? Don't we see too much of this, in the <HI>Negligence</HI> of Parents and Masters, in <HI>sending</HI> their Children, and those under
<PB N="33" REF="004236_0037_1004285DAA4F3128"/>
their Care and Charge to <HI>School,</HI> when we have One.</P>
<P><HI>My Brethren,</HI> What will the next, or succeeding Generations be, in our <HI>Country Towns,</HI> unless a Love to, a Value for, and Esteem of Learning, revive? Must not we send abroad for Men to do our publick Busi∣ness for us? I think it is beyond all Dispute, a rare Thing to find among us, Men of a common Character, that can use their Pens as many, many, of our Fathers could.</P>
<P>I entreat you to bear with my Plainness and Free∣dom of Speech; and <HI>suffer</HI> me to add, <HI>O let us endea∣vour</HI> to <HI>recover</HI> that Spirit of <HI>Family Government</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> which our Fathers had: They <HI>rul'd</HI> their <HI>Houses well,</HI> and <HI>had</HI> their <HI>Housholds</HI> in good <HI>Subjection; Children and Servants</HI> knew their <HI>Places,</HI> and kept their <HI>Distances</HI>: But how is it now? Verily in <HI>Fa∣mily Government</HI> is the <HI>Foundation laid</HI> for <HI>good Order, Peace,</HI> and a <HI>regular Conduct,</HI> in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State. O let us command our Children and Housholds,</HI> that they fear God, and honour the King; that they reverence their Superiours, and behave with all suitable Deco∣rum towards every one. <HI>And I hope,</HI> without Offence, I may subjoin, for I have no particular References, How much is it to be wished, that our <HI>School Masters</HI> would shew all good Fidelity in that Betrustment, and let their <HI>little Nurseries</HI> be the <HI>Schools</HI> neither of <HI>Tyrannus</HI> nor of <HI>Gallio,</HI> but that they use their best Endeavours to <HI>instill</HI> good <HI>Knowledge, Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> into the Minds and Hearts of Children, that they may give a good Account of their <HI>Stewardship.</HI></P>
<P>And O let us every one in our <HI>respective Spheres</HI> and <HI>Characters,</HI> endeavour to shine in the <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> with which our <HI>Forefathers</HI> were <HI>endow'd</HI> and <HI>brightned.</HI></P>
<P>And as I have taken up the <HI>Mantles,</HI> so, O that thro' Grace, I might inherit a <HI>double Portion</HI> of that <HI>excellent Spirit,</HI> which rested upon my <HI>ascended Fathers,</HI> who ministred at the Lord's Altar in this Place. I don't pretend to have attained, but I desire to <HI>follow on</HI>; LORD quicken my Pace, and encrease the Fruits of thy Spirit in my weak and feeble Essays, for the Glory of

thy Name, and the Good of precious Souls; and O that we might be so happy as to be the Crowns of each other's Joy in the Day of Christ's appearing.</P>
<P>And (<HI>my dear Charge</HI>) I beseech you to <HI>imitate</HI> the <HI>Zeal,</HI> the <HI>Love,</HI> the <HI>Faith,</HI> the <HI>Purity,</HI> the <HI>Holiness,</HI> the <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Liberality</HI> of your pious Ancestors; And let this Day, or this Season of the Year, witness for you, that you are Followers, as well as Descendants from them, who thro' Faith and Patience are inheriting the Promises, in your liberal Communications to those that stand in need; such you have with you, and you will always have with you; don't forget them. The <HI>blessed God</HI> hath given bountifully into your Hands this Year, and they that reap bountifully should sow bountifully, and that is the Way for another good Crop, and a further plentiful Harvest. Of <HI>this, some</HI> of you are not <HI>unmindful: God's Poor</HI>; and his unworthy Ser∣vant speaking, most <HI>commend</HI> your Acts of <HI>Kindness.</HI> The Lord reward your Bounty in the Gifts of his Providence, and in the Fruits of his Grace, to you and to your Children forever.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From what we have heard, let us be excited to re∣joice in the Goodness of God, and to make the Joy of the Lord our Strength</HI>; and let us raise those Notes of Triumph, Psal 105 begin <HI>O give Thanks unto the Lord, call upon his Name, make known his Deeds among the People; sing unto him▪ sing Psalms unto him talk of all his wondrous Works; Glory ye in his holy Name; let the Heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord</HI> See also Psal. 106 begin. <HI>Praise ye the Lord, O give Thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his Mercy endureth forever. Who can utter the mighty Acts of the Lord? Who can shew forth all his Praise? Blessed are they that keep Judgment, and he that doth Righteousness at all Times. Remember me, O Lord, with the Favour that thou bearest unto thy People; O visit me with thy Salvation, that I may see the Good of thy Chosen, that I may rejoice in the Gladness of thy Nation, that I may glory with thine In∣heritance.</HI> And in the 107th Psal. begin. <HI>O give Thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his Mercy endureth for∣ever;
<PB N="35" REF="004236_0039_10042862B46D66E8"/>
let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the Hand of the Enemy, and gathered them out of the Lands, from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South. They wandred in the Wilderness, in a solitary Way, they found no City to dwell in, hungry and thirsty, their Soul fainted in them; then they cried to the Lord in their Trouble, and he deli∣vered them out of their Distresses, and he led them forth by the right Way, that they might go to a City of Habi∣bitation. O that Men would praise the Lord for his Good∣nest, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>What we have heard should encourage us to trust in God, to hope in his Mercy, and to pray for his special Presence, and peculiar Blessings, particularly the out∣pourings of his Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The ever blessed God hath done great and good Things for us, and he is the only <HI>adequate Object</HI> of our <HI>Trust and Hope</HI>; and he that has done can still do: To <HI>him</HI> therefore let us, with Humility, and in Faith, with Fervency, commit our Cause, <HI>who is God perfor∣ming all Things for us</HI>; and in a particular Manner, let us cry mightily, that the Spirit may be poured down from on high upon us, that the Hearts of the Fathers may be turn'd to the Children, and the Disobedient to the Wisdom of the Just, that we may become a holy People; that God would pardon our Iniquities, heal our Backslidings, receive us graciously and love us freely, and make us a peculiar People to himself, zea∣lous of good Works.</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>From what we have heard, let us be quickened to bless and magnify the glorious God, for the former and later Manifestations of his Goodness and Grace, Bounty and Kindness.</HI></P>
<P>We should abundantly utter the Memory of God's great Goodness, and sing of his Loving kindness. We should mention the Loving kindness of the Lord, and the Praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us; and his great Goodness toward the House of his New English Israel, which he hath
<PB N="36" REF="004236_0040_100428691A038BC0"/>
bestowed on them according to his Mercies, and ac∣cording to the Multitude of his Loving kindnesses.</P>
<P>But in a Word,</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>The great Goodness of God towards our Fathers and towards us should animate us to use our utmost Endea∣vours, that our Children may be suitably affected with these Things.</HI></P>
<P>But this brings me</P>
<P N="3">3 To <HI>consider</HI> the third and last Reason given in our Text, to urge the People's Duty upon them in attending to the Instructions, and Admonitions that were to be given to them in God's Name, viz. <HI>That they were Things in which Posterity was concern'd.</HI></P>
<P>Verse 4th and on of our Text, <HI>We will not hide them from their Children, shewing to the Generation to come, the Praises of the Lord, and his Strength, and his wonderful Works that he hath done; for he establish∣ed a Testimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Israel, which he commanded our Fathers, that they should make them known to their Children, that the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their Children, that they might set their Hope in God, &amp; not forget the Works of God, but keep his Commandments, and not be as their Fathers, a stubborn and rebellious Generation, a Generation that set not their Heart aright, and whose Spirit was not stedfast with God.</HI></P>
<P>The Things which the Prophet was about to Dis∣course of, as they were Things <HI>weighty,</HI> and the <HI>Mo∣numents</HI> of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> so they were to be <HI>transmitted</HI> to <HI>Posterity</HI>; <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> and it lies as a Charge upon us, carefully to hand them down. <HI>Because our Fathers told them us,</HI> we will not hide them from their Children: Our Chil∣dren are called <HI>their's,</HI> for they were in Care for their <HI>Seed's Seed,</HI> and look'd upon them as their's. And in teaching our Children the Knowledge of God, we re∣pay to our Parents some of that Debt owe to them
<PB N="37" REF="004236_0041_1004286A9FB55328"/>
for teaching us. Nay if we have no Children of <HI>our own,</HI> we must declare the Things of God to their Chil∣dren, the Children of others; our Care must be for Posterity in general, and not only for <HI>our own</HI> Posteri∣ty. And for the <HI>Generation to come</HI> hereafter, the Chil∣dren <HI>that shall be born,</HI> as well as the Generation that is next rising up, and the Children that <HI>are born.</HI> That which we are to transmit to our Children, is not only the Knowledge of Languages, Arts, and Sciences, their Liberty and Property; but especially <HI>the Praises of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>his Strength</HI> appearing <HI>in the wonder∣ful Works that he has done.</HI> Our great Care must be to lodge our Religion, that great <HI>Depositum,</HI> pure and entire in the Hands of those that succeed us.</P>
<P>Hence we may observe this <HI>Note</HI> of DOCTRINE, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That we ought to do all that is in our Power, to have the Souls of our Children impress'd with suitable Appre∣hensions of God, his Will and Law, and their Duty; to effect which, the Rehearsal of, and acquainting them with, God's memorable providential Dispensations, whe∣ther of ancienter or later Date, may have an agreable Tendency.</HI></P>
<P>Here let it be said,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We should use our utmost Endeavour, that our Children may be suitably affected with the Law of God, his Will, and their Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He established a Testimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Israel, which he commanded our Fathers, that they should make them known to their Children,</HI> v. 5. <HI>The Law of God</HI> was given to his People, with a par∣ticular Charge, that it should be taught diligently to their Children. <HI>He established a Testimony</HI> or Covenant, and erected a Law in <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI>; gave them Precepts and Promises, which he <HI>commanded them to make known to their Children.</HI> See Deut. 6.7. <HI>And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine House, and when thou walkest by the Way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</HI> See also Verse 20, and on. <HI>And when thy Son asketh thee in Time to come, saying, What
<PB N="38" REF="004236_0042_1004286FBB583708"/>
mean the Testimonies, and the Statutes, and the Judg∣ments which the Lord our God hath commanded you; then shalt thou say unto thy Son, We were Pharaoh's Bonamen in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty Hand, and the Lord shewed Signs and Wonders, great and sore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his Houshold, before our Eyes; and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the Land which he sware unto our Fathers. And the Lord commanded us to do all these Statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our Good always, that he might pre∣serve us alive, as it is at this Day; and it shall be our Righteousness, if we observe to do all these Commandments, before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of God, as the Historian saith of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Common-wealth, was not to be <HI>Res unius aetatis,</HI> a Business of one Age, but was to be kept up, from one Generation to another. And therefore, as God provided for a Succession of Ministers in the <HI>Tribe of Levi,</HI> and the <HI>House of Aaron,</HI> so he appointed that Parents should train up their Children in the Know∣ledge of his Law; and when they are grown up, they must <HI>arise and declare them to their Children</HI>; that as one Generation of God's Servants and Worshippers passeth away, another Generation may come, and <HI>the Church,</HI> as <HI>the Earth,</HI> may <HI>abide forever.</HI> And thus GOD's Name among Men may be as the <HI>Days of Heaven.</HI> And then,</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The Rehearsal of God's memorable providential Dispensations to our Children, and suitably acquainting them therewithal, may have a happy Tendency thus to impress the Law of God upon them.</HI> His Providences both of Mercy and Judgment.</P>
<P>It is requisite that <HI>God's Works</HI> should be <HI>made known</HI> to Posterity, together with his <HI>Laws</HI>; the fulfilling of his Promises made to the Obedient, and his Threat∣nings denounced against the Disobedient: Let these be told to our Children, and to our Children's Chil∣dren.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="004236_0043_10042872891A4E98"/>And hence they may <HI>take Encouragement,</HI> to con∣form themselves to the <HI>Will of God,</HI> that not <HI>forgetting the Works of God</HI> wrought in former Days, or later Times, they may <HI>set their Hope in God,</HI> and <HI>keep his Commandments,</HI> may make his Command their Rule, and his Covenant their Stay. And those only may with Confidence <HI>hope for God's Salvation,</HI> that make Con∣science of <HI>doing his Commandments.</HI> The <HI>Works of God,</HI> duly considered, will very much strengthen our Reso∣lution, both to <HI>set our Hope in him,</HI> and to <HI>keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>And then, hence may Children <HI>take Warning,</HI> to conform to those <HI>Examples of their Fathers</HI> which have not been good, and for which God hath visited them with his sore Rebukes, <HI>that they might not be as their Fathers, a stubborn and rebellious Generation.</HI></P>
<P>When the Character of Fathers is, that they are <HI>stubborn and rebellious,</HI> that they walk contrary unto God, who tho' they profess Relation to him, yet do not set their Hearts aright; are not cordial in their Engagements to God, nor inward with him in their Worship of him, and therefore their <HI>Spirits are not sted∣fast with him,</HI> but upon every Occasion fly from him: Children should <HI>take Warning</HI> not to follow <HI>their Ex∣amples.</HI></P>
<P>And verily those that are descended from wicked and ungodly Ancestors, if they will but consider the Word and Works of God, will see Reason enough not to tread in their Steps: 'Twill be no Excuse for <HI>a vain Conversation,</HI> that it was <HI>receiv'd by Tradition</HI> from our Fathers, for what we know of them that was ill, and the Punishments that they receiv'd therefor, should be an Admonition to us, that we dread that which was so pernicious to them.</P>
<P>In fine. Such an Acquaintance with the Dealings of Heaven, may have a Tendency <HI>to fill</HI> our <HI>Children</HI> with an <HI>holy Awe</HI> and <HI>Reverence</HI> of the <HI>divine Majesty</HI>; with a <HI>chearful Hope</HI> and <HI>Confidence</HI> in him; with <HI>earnest Desires</HI> and a <HI>steady Care</HI> to please him. by obeying his Will; with <HI>awful Fears</HI> of offending
<PB N="40" REF="004236_0044_10042875C3BC5838"/>
him, by any Instances of Disobedience; <HI>and in a Word,</HI> this may instruct and quicken them <HI>to fear, love, serve,</HI> and <HI>worship</HI> that God who was <HI>their Father's God,</HI> and is <HI>their God,</HI> and who they desire may be <HI>the God</HI> of their's after them.</P>
<P>Hence by Way of <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We learn the Duty of Parents to instruct their Children in the knowledge of God's Word and Works; of His Law and Providence.</HI></P>
<P>We should teach them diligently to our Children: We should talk of them when we sit in the House, when we walk by the Way, when we lye down and when we rise up. We should acquaint our Children with what God hath done for his People, for his Churches, for our Families, for ourselves, and for them. What Sense they should have of divine Mer∣cies, and how they should resent the Tokens of divine Displeasure. What Improvement they should make of such Things to stir them up to Holiness of Life, and to direct their Hearts into the Love of God, and a pa∣tient Waiting for the Mercy of God, thro' our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence we learn the Duty of Children to hearken to and receive Inctructions; to regard God's Works and obey his Will.</HI> And to lay up such Things as a sacred Depositum to be transmitted down to their Posterity; and to have their own Hearts suitably impress'd, and their Lives influenc'd to an agreeable Conversation by the Examples of God's Mercies, and Judgments. His <HI>Smiles</HI> upon <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> and his <HI>Frowns</HI> upon <HI>Impiety</HI> and <HI>Dishonesty.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let what has been offer'd upon this Subject, have this Influence and Effect upon us; to quicken us to regard the Works of the Lord, and to consider the Operation of his Hands in the Methods of his Providence towards us, and towards our Venerable and Renowned Forefa∣thers</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="004236_0045_100428775FEC93B0"/>
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">For I am humbly of Opinion, that the Principles from which sprang their Remove into these uncultivated Regions; the Views and Aims, they had therein, the Perils and Fatigues they underwent and endur'd, and the Magnanimity, Pa∣tience, and Self-denial with which they bore the same: And his Sake, his Honour and Glory, for whom they suffer'd all, justly entitle them to the Regards of Hero's, Martyrs, Confessors, &amp;c. in our Esteem, and in the Annals of Time.</NOTE>—<HI>That our Hope may be set in God, and that we may not forget his Works, but keep his Commandments.</HI> Let the Thought of their being weighty Things, ancient Things, and Things in which Posterity is concern'd, prove a Motive to us hereunto.</P>
<P>But it is Time to draw to a Close. Wherefore upon the whole, and to conclude: So <HI>copious</HI> is our <HI>present Theme,</HI> and so many <HI>incidental Articles</HI> which require our Notice, and so <HI>narrow</HI> the <HI>Limits</HI> of Time to men∣tion them all; that renders it exceeding difficult to keep proper Measures, and to preserve a natural, clear and unconfused Method.

<P>Wherefore I shall conclude with a few brief Hints of <HI>Exhortation</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Upon such a Reflection as we have now made, let us be filled with humble and holy Admiration.</HI></P>
<P>LORD! What is Man that thou art thus mindful of him, and the Children of Men that thou shouldest thus visit them? Who are we, or what are our Houses, that thou hast brought us hitherto? Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us utter the Memory of God's great Goodness, and of his wonderful Works, with sincere Views that his Name may be thereby glorified.</HI></P>
<P>Let us with our whole Souls, bless God for <HI>preser∣ving</HI> our Fathers from the <HI>Perils of the Sea,</HI> in crossing the great Ocean to settle themselves in this Land. And <HI>for protecting</HI> them from the <HI>Dangers</HI> that they were in

<P>In a Word, We should bless God for the Bounties and Benignities of the Year past in particular, and be above every Thing solicitous <HI>what we shall render for the Benefits done unto us.</HI> Bless the Lord, O our Souls, and all that is within us, bless his holy Name.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us fear and reverence that great and dreadful Name,</HI> THE LORD OUR GOD.</P>

<P>"Let us be sollicitous to do all we can to secure the Continuance of the gracious Presence of God among us.

That's the Call of Christ to his People here, Rev 3 2, 3. <HI>Be watchful, and strengthen the Things which remain that are ready to dye, for I have not found thy Works perfect before God, remember there∣fore how thou hast received, and heard, and hold fast, and repent.</HI> And as in Verse 11. <HI>Behold I come quickly, hold that fast which thou hast, that no Man take thy Crown.</HI> He that hath an Ear, let him hear, what the Spirit saith unto the Churches."</P>

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>IT is thought proper, not so much for the <HI>Grati∣fication</HI> of the <HI>Curious,</HI> as for the <HI>Quickning</HI> of the <HI>Serious,</HI> and <HI>Admonition</HI> of the <HI>Unthoughtful,</HI> That the Covenant of <HI>Association,</HI> which the first Set∣tlers of this Town entred into in their Infant State; and upon the Signing of which they admitted others to Incorporate with them, should be publish'd, by Way of <HI>Appendix.</HI></P>
<P>And also the <HI>solemn Covenant</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which our Fa∣thers entred into when they gave themselves up to the <HI>glorious Jesus,</HI> to be his <HI>People</HI> in <HI>Church Communion.</HI></P>
<P>Here follows,</P>
<P N="1">I. The SOCIETY COVENANT in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We whose Names are hereunto subscribed, do in the Fear and Reverence of our Almighty God, mutu∣ally and severally promise amongst ourselves and each to other, to profess and practice one Faith, according to that most perfect Rule, the Foundation whereof is everlasting Love.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we shall by all Means labour to keep off from us, all such as are contrary Minded; and receive only such unto us, as be such, as may be propably of one Heart with us; as that we either know, or may well and truly be inform'd to walk in a peaceable Conversation with all Meekness of Spirit, for the Edi∣fication of each other in the Knowledge and Faith of the Lord Jesus; and the mutual Encouragement un∣to all temporal Comforts in all Things; seeking the Good of each other, out of all which may be derived true Peace.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="46" REF="004236_0050_1004288C139532E8"/>3. That if at any Time Difference shall arise be∣tween Parties of our said Town, that then such Party and Parties, shall presently refer all such Difference unto some one two, or three others of our said Society, to be fully accorded and determined, without any further Delay, if it possibly may be.</P>
<P N="4">4 That every Man that now, or any Time here∣after, shall have Lotts in our said Town, shall pay his Share in all such Rates of Money and Charges as shall be imposed upon him rateably in Proportion with other Men, as also become freely subject unto all such Or∣ders and Constitutions, as shall be necessarily had or made, now or at any Time hereafter from this Day forward, as well for loving and comfortable Society in our said Town, as also for the prosperous and thriving Condition of our said Fellowship, especially respecting the Fear of God, in which we desire to begin and con∣tinue, whatsoever we shall by his loving Favour take in Hand.</P>
<P N="5">5 And for the better Manifestation of our true Re∣solution herein, every Man so received, to subscribe hereunto his Name, thereby obliging both himself, and his Successors after him for ever as we have done.</P>
<P>This Covenant is subscrib'd by 126.</P>
<P>This Association Compact, plainly shows, that the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Ways of God, mutual Assistance</HI> and <HI>brother∣ly Love</HI> were Things much <HI>regarded</HI> by the <HI>first Setlers</HI> of this <HI>Town</HI>; and sure I am, that <HI>they</HI> are <HI>worthy</HI> of the <HI>Notice</HI> of <HI>their Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>Now follows</P>
<P N="2">II. THE CHURCH COVENANT, in these Terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"We whose Names are subscribed, having found by woful Experience, the Unstedfastness of our Hearts with God, and Proneness to go astray from his Ways, (for which we desire to abase and humble ourselves in his Presence) and desiring to be joined forever to the Lord, and to cleave together in spiritual Love and Communion, according to his holy Institutions, that we might enjoy in his Name such holy Helps as the
<PB N="47" REF="004236_0051_1004288D9D2B73F8"/>
Lord Jesus in Wisdom and Compassion hath ordained in his Gospel for his People, thereby to let out him∣self unto them, and to build them up in Faith and Ho∣liness, 'till he have prepared them for everlasting Communion with himself.</P>
<P>We do therefore, in the Name and Presence of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, and before his People here assembled, solemnly enter into Covenant with the Lord our God professing and acknowledging the Lord Jesus, our blessed Redeemer, to be the only Priest, Pro∣phet, and King of his Church, and (thro' the Help of his Grace) his only Merit we rest upon for our Par∣don and Peace with the Father, his only Teaching and righteous Government, with all the blessed Ordi∣nances of his Kingdom. We do embrace and submit unto in all Things, as the only Rule of our Lives; renouncing all our own Righteousness, with all the Doctrines, Devices, and Commandments of Men, not agreeing with his holy Word; especially all the superstitious and tyrannous Commands of Antichrist, and his Adherents, wherein we have in any kind been entangled; professing &amp; promising (thro' the Help of his rich &amp; free Grace) henceforth not to live unto ourselves, but unto the Lord Jesus, who hath bought us with his Blood, avoiding carefully all such Things as be of∣fensive to his Majesty, and dishonourable to our Pro∣fession of his Name, with all such dangerous Tempta∣tions as our sinful Hearts are wont to be drawn aside withal, in special, the inordinate Cares of, and Entan∣glements in, the Affairs of this Life: Promising and professing also, thro' the Help of the Lord, to live together in this our holy Fellowship, according to the Rule of Love, in all holy Watchfulness over each o∣ther, and faithful mutual Helpfulness in the Ways of God, for the spiritual and temporal Comfort and Good of one another in the Lord; and all to the setting forth of the Praise of his rich Grace in Christ▪ who hath called us, in his abundant Mercy, to this holy Fellowship with his Majesty, and one with another."</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 8. 1638.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="004236_0052_100403D13356F1C0"/><HI>N. B.</HI> In the Time of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> upon the 23d Day of <HI>May</HI> 1683, the Church solemnly re∣newed their Covenant, and in the doing of it, they made some very necessary and weighty Additions to the former.</P>
<P>The <HI>Renewal</HI> of <HI>Covenant</HI> is thus <HI>Prefac'd.</HI></P>
<P>"We who thro' the exceeding Riches of the Grace and Patience of God, do yet continue Members of this Church, being now assembled in the holy Pre∣sence, and in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, after humble Confession of our manifold Breaches of Cove∣nant before the Lord our God, and earnest Supplica∣tion for pardoning Mercy, thro' the Blood of Christ, and due Acknowledgment of our great Unworthiness to be own'd as the Lord's Covenant People, also ac∣knowledging our Inability to keep Covenant with God, or to perform any spiritual Duty, unless the Lord Jesus do enable us thereunto, by his Spirit dwelling in us. And being awfully sensible that it is a dread∣ful Thing for sinful Dust and Ashes personally to transact with the infinitely glorious Majesty of Heaven and Earth; We do in humble Confidence of his gra∣cious Assistance and Acceptance thro' Christ, each one of us, for ourselves, and jointly as a Church of the living God, explicitly renew our Covenant with God, and one with another, in Manner and Form follow∣ing."</P>
<P>Then follows the <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Covenant</HI> before writ∣ten; to which is added the following Para∣graphs, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"And whereas there are many Evils that are grown too common in this Land; so far as we or any of us have been guilty of any of them, we desire from our Hearts to bewail it before the Lord, and humbly to entreat for pardoning Mercy, for the sake of the Blood of the everlasting Covenant. And as an expedient unto Reformation, of whatever Evils have provoked the Eyes of God's Glory among us, We do subjoin unto our Church Covenant, a further Engagement, whereby we do in the Presence of God promise"—</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="004236_0053_1004289534B78B60"/>"That we will (by the Help of Christ) endeavour every one of us to reform his own Heart and Life, by seeking to mortify all our Sins, and endeavouring to walk closely with God, to uphold the Power of God∣liness, to keep holy the Lord's Day, and reverently and carefully to attend upon the Dispensation of the Word and Ordinances of Christ, and all Parts of his Worship (whether publick or private) according as in the Word of God it is required of us to do."</P>
<P>"We promise also (by the Help of Christ) to walk before God in our Houses with an upright Heart, taking Care that God be constantly call'd upon by Prayer, and that the Scriptures be frequently read in them, and that we will endeavour to perform all Duties required of us towards our Children, for their spiritual Good, both by our Example, Instruction, and Government, and Prayers for them."</P>
<P>"We do further engage (the Lord helping of us) to endeavour that we may be pure from the Sins of the Times, such as neglect or Profanation of the Worship and Institutions of Christ, Sabbath-brea∣king, vain and sinful Company-keeping, mispending of Time, excessive Drinking, wanton and loose Behavi∣our, failing in Truth, uncharitable and unrighteous Censuring, sinful Tale-bearing, corrupt Communicati∣on, Pride, Covetousness, and the like; and in our Places to endeavour the suppression of them. And that we will make Conscience to walk so, as that we may not give Occasion to others to Sin, or to speak evil of our holy Profession.</P>
<P>"Now that we may observe and keep this sacred Covenant, and all the Branches of it inviolable for ever, we desire to deny ourselves, and to depend wholly upon the eternal Spirit of Grace, and upon the free Mercy of GOD, and the Merit of JESUS CHRIST, and when we shall fail, there to wait upon the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> for Pardon and for Acceptance, and for Healing, for his Name Sake."</P>
<P><HI>It is added,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="004236_0054_100403D468E27DE0"/>"This Form of Covenant being made openly in the Congregation after Sermon and Prayers in the Forenoon, the Brethren of the Church testified their Consent thereto by lifting up the Hands, and the Sisters by ari∣sing up from their Seats."</P>
<P>And now (my dearly beloved Brethren) <HI>Let us re∣member the Vows of God that are upon us:</HI> Let us often read over, and seriously reflect upon our Covenant En∣gagements: Let us humbly lament before God all that Breach of Covenant, which we are chargeable withal, and cry mightily for pardoning Mercy thro' the Blood of the everlasting Covenant. And that the holy God, would not avenge upon us the Quarrel of his broken Covenant. And, O that for the Time to come we might have a more constant and steady Regard to our Covenant-Engagements, and walk worthy of the Lord unto all well pleasing. Unto which let this Covenant (now in our Hands, and O that it was writ∣ten on our Hearts) be a <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>continual</HI> MONITOR.</P>
<P>Let not the LORD our GOD abhor us to destroy us, but remember the <HI>Covenant</HI> of our <HI>Ancestors</HI> — Hav∣ing entred into a Covenant to seek the Lord God of our Fathers, with all our Heart, and with all our Soul; let us in the most solemn Manner renew the Bonds with which we have bound our Souls, and like the Men of Judah, rejoice at the Oath: Having sworn with all our Heart, let us seek God with our whole Desire.</P>
<P>And let us be careful to bring our <HI>Children</HI> under the <HI>Wing</HI> of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> and the <HI>Bonds</HI> of the <HI>Cove∣nant,</HI> that we may plead <HI>Covenant Mercy</HI> for <HI>them,</HI> and have a <HI>Covenant-Hope</HI> for our <HI>Offspring.</HI></P>
<P>And for our Encouragement, let us remember, <HI>that all the Paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth unto such as keep his Covenant, and his Testimonies — The Mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his Righteousness unto Chil∣dren's Children; to such as keep his Covenant, and to those that remember his Commandments to do them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="004236_0055_1004289AA9156CF0"/><HI>Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; he is their Help and their Shield. The Lord hath been mindful of us, he will bless us, he will bless the House of Israel, he will bless the House of Aaron, he will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great. —The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your Children—You are the blessed of the Lord that made Heaven and Earth; the Heaven, even the Heavens are the Lord's, but the Earth hath he given to the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We will bless the Lord from this Time forth and for ever more.</HI> AMEN.</P>
