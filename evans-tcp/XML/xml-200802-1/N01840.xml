<BIBL>ROMANS XIII.3.</BIBL>
<Q>For Rulers are not a terror to Good Works, but to the Evil.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT this Epistle was writ∣ten to a Number of Christi∣ans in <HI>Rome</HI> is unquestiona∣ble. Whither it was writ∣ten to a Church there seems not evident.</P>
<P>THE former part of the Epistle is Doctrinal; and it treats of the most important Doctrines of the Gospel; as GOD'S eternal Purpose, Fore-knowledge, Predestina∣tion, Vocation of Sinners into a State of Grace, their Justification there-upon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Doctrine of Justification is here very particu∣larly and clearly handled, by the Apostle.</P>
<P>THE latter part of the Epistle is Practi∣cal, Instructive of us as to variety of Duties to be done by us. Within this part falls this Chapter, and particularly this Text; <HI>For
<PB N="2" REF="002180_0005_10030BB48F5B6968"/>
Rulers are not a terror to good works; but to the Evil.</HI></P>
<P>IN v. 1. We have a Divine Command gi∣ven by the Mouth of an Apostle, <HI>viz. Let every Soul be subject unto the higher Powers. The Soul</HI> is here put for the Person, as frequently other-where in Scripture. <HI>Every Soul,</HI> in∣cludes Persons of all Ranks and Distinctions. <HI>Powers,</HI> are here intended of Civil Rulers; for the Apostle is not here treating of Church∣government.</P>
<P>OBEDIENCE to this Precept is here urged by weighty Reasons. GOD made Man a Rational Being; and as such He deals with him. He expects he should be swayed by Reason; and accordingly he is hereby pressed to his Duty.</P>
<P>AND He tells us,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT the Powers are of GOD.</HI> They are Ordained by Him, are Constituted by His Authority. And this should certainly be of weight with Rational Beings, with every Man that owns a GOD, and himself to be His Creature, sustained by Him every Moment, and deriving from Him every thing, every good thing that is injoyed by him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT whosoever resists the Power, resists the Ordinance of GOD.</HI> He does not ultimately
<PB N="3" REF="002180_0006_1003015DE7428598"/>
resist a Creature, but GOD Himself, while he resists, or opposes himself against His Ordi∣nance. He wages War with GOD Himself. And what daring Madness is this in the Crea∣ture! Who is, as we read, in Jer. 18.6. <HI>In GOD'S Hand as the clay is in the Potters hand.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THAT they that resist, shall receive to themselves Damnation.</HI> A dreadful doom in∣deed! A strong Motive it is to be subject to Government. Its the same word both in the Translation and Original, which we read, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 29. respecting Persons Unworthi∣ly receiving the Lords Supper. And tho' it be true that the word might be translated, <HI>Judgment</HI>; its also true, That either of these Sins, with all others that Men are guilty of, or any particular Sin whatsoever; without Repentance, will issue in Damnation.</P>
<P N="4">4.(WHICH brings me to my Text) he tells us, <HI>That Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. q. d.</HI> Obey them, Chear∣fully submit to their Authority and Rule; for tho' they be Men armed with the Sword of Civil Justice; they are only evil workers, vicious Persons, to whom they are a terror. They will not hurt the good: No, their Power is, as is the Law, in 1 Tim. 1.9. <HI>Not against a Righteous Man, but against the Lawless, Disobedient, Ungodly, Unholy, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002180_0007_10030BB72EC9EBA8"/>IN the Words of the Text we have,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE subject spoken of,</HI> viz. Rulers; Such to whom the Civil Government is by GOD committed; they are Rulers, Ruling in the Fear of GOD; Rulers in Scripture deno∣minated gods. Psal. 82.1. <HI>GOD judgeth among the gods</HI>: they are gods, as being cloa∣thed with His Authority; gods, as bearing the lively Image of His own Impartiality, E∣quity, Justice, &amp;c. mixed with Lenity and Mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WHAT is Predicated or Affirmed of them.</HI> They are a <HI>Terror.</HI> Their Countenances, De∣portments, and Administrations carry a terror in them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>TO whom they are thus, or the objects of this Terror of theirs.</HI> And they are thus, (1) Negatively, Not to good works. Here works are put for Persons working. Rulers are no terror to them that be honest and good; that do good &amp; work righteousness. (2) Positive∣ly, They are a terror to evil works. <HI>i. e.</HI> To evil workers. Evil workers, Vicious Per∣sons, are they to whom they are a terror. Against these it is that the Point, of their Sword of Civil Justice is set. Immoral Men, Men of evil Practices, of wicked Lives, are the objects of their terror. Thus are <HI>Rulers a terror not to good works, but to the evil,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002180_0008_100301608C2A5D58"/>
<LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
THEY are Evil Workers, Vicious Persons, to whom Rulers are a Terror.</P>
<P>TO these and only these, according to their Character in my Text, they are so. They are Evil Workers against whom their faces are set, and the edge of their Authority turned. They will not hurt the good: No, Rom. 13.3. <HI>Do good, and thou shalt have praise of them.</HI> They will not discoutenance, but incourage the doing of Good. This you may expect; for we read in Rom. 13.4. <HI>The Civil Ruler is the Minister of GOD unto thee for good.</HI></P>
<P>FOR further Illustration of this Truth, I shall first lay down the following Positions; then Answer the Inquiry, <HI>viz.</HI> How, or in what way are Rulers a terror to Evil Workers, to Vicious Livers?</P>
<P>POSITIONS.</P>
<P>Position, 1. <HI>That RULE Originally belongs to GOD Only.</HI> The right of Rule is Primari∣ly alone in the Hand of the High and Lofty ONE, who inhabiteth Eternity. Even a proud and lofty spirited Heathen seems to
<PB N="6" REF="002180_0009_10030BB8DF76D710"/>
have been convinced of this, in Dan. 4.34—<HI>I praised and honoured Him that liveth for ever, whose Dominion is an everlasting Do∣minion, and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation.</HI> And it will come to that again, that all Rule shall be intirely in the Hand of the Great JEHOVAH. We read, in 1 Cor. 15.24. That the Great Mediator <HI>shall put down all Rule, Authority, and Power</HI>; and then <HI>shall deliver up the Kingdom to GOD.</HI> And v. 28. <HI>When all things shall be subdued unto the Son; the Son Himself shall be subject to Him that put all things under Him; that GOD may be all in all.</HI></P>
<P>Position, 2. <HI>RULE being a Communicable Property of GOD, it may be derived unto His Creatures.</HI> Creatures may by participa∣tion be invested with Rule and Government, which be Originally in GOD alone. As Ho∣liness, Justice, Goodness, &amp;c. are commu∣nicable Properties of GOD: so is Dominion also.</P>
<P>Position, 3. <HI>IT was accordingly communica∣ted to</HI> Adam <HI>in Innocency.</HI> To him was gi∣ven Dominion over every Sublunary Being. GOD cloathed him in a degree with His own Authority. Gen. 1.28. — <HI>Have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, the Fowl of the Air, and over every living thing that moveth on the
<PB N="7" REF="002180_0010_10030163D6732970"/>
Earth.</HI> And in this Dominion seems the Image of GOD on <HI>Adam,</HI> in part to have con∣sisted. It was indeed Righteousness and Ho∣liness in which it principally did consist; but not exclusive of Rule and Government, with which he was betrusted.</P>
<P>Position, 4. <HI>A forfeiture was made by the fall of this as well as of all other good.</HI> Man by this Apostacy forfeited all his favours. He retained no title to any good at all; no right to any thing either profitable, pleasu∣rable, or honourable. To that deadly com∣plicated death only, now he had a title: Gen. 2.17. —<HI>Thou shalt surely die.</HI> He was now not only stript of his right to Rule, as well as other benefits: but his condition was much worse than that of cursed <HI>Canaan,</HI> Gen. 9.25. <HI>A Servant of Servants shall he be unto his Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Position, 5. <HI>GOD by common favour, on the Revelation of the Gospel, restored Rule in some degree to fallen Man.</HI> This is undeni∣ably evident from Scripture. Not only Rule, but Rule by Divine appointment, now belongs to fallen Man; to some in one kind, to others in another; to some in one degree, to others in another. And this is among GODS com∣mon favours: it belongs to bad as well as good Men. Its no distinguishing Character
<PB N="8" REF="002180_0011_10030BBF29032928"/>
of gracious Persons from others of Mankind. No, Dominion is not founded in Grace. Even wicked <HI>Saul</HI> was the LORD'S Anointed: He had right to Rule in Israel, tho' he was totally, devoid of any saving good.</P>
<P>Position, 6. <HI>RULE is either common to Mankind in general; or appropriated more par∣ticularly unto Some of them.</HI> Common Rule belongs to Men as Men respited from present Ruine, and allowed to continue for a time in the World; to an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r the Ends that Infinite Wisdom has de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, with respect to them. This every Man is in some degree a sharer in. The restoration of this to Apostate Man, we have the account of, in Gen, 9.2. <HI>And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth, &amp;c. Into your hand are they delivered.</HI> That Rule which is more Special, is either, (1) <HI>Natural,</HI> as that of Pa∣rents respecting Children. They have a Na∣tural, tho' a limitted right of dominion over them; and Children are accordingly under a Natural tie to yield Obedience. (2) <HI>Civil Rule,</HI> including in it that which is Military also. (3) <HI>Ecclesiastical,</HI> which is setled in and over the visible Church by CHRIST, as the King and Head of it. Ecclesiastical Rulers before the Mosaick Law, were the First-born of the Families. Under the Law the Stated Rulers of the Church were the Priests and
<PB N="9" REF="002180_0012_1003016C60474288"/>
Levites Since the Law, they are Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers.</P>
<P>BUT the Civil Rulers are they of whom my Text speaks, and concerning whom it is affirmed; <HI>They are a Terror, not to good works,</HI> &amp;c. They are evil workers, vicious persons, to be a terror unto whom these are constitu∣ted by GOD. This by Divine appointment is their Office: And on this very thing they are to attend, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.6.</P>
<P><LABEL>QUESTION.</LABEL>
BUT how, or whereby do Rulers become a Terror to Evil Workers, to Persons of Vicious Lives, and Practices?</P>
<P><LABEL>ANSWER.</LABEL>
THEY are and appear to be a Terror to evil workers.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BY their very Countenances and Grave deportments.</HI> Persons of ill Manners and base Practices may read in the very Countenances of Rulers, their ill-resentment of them. Even therein may be read their hatred of them that work iniquity. We read, in Prov. 25.23. <HI>The North wind driveth away rain, so does an angry countenance, a backbiting Tongue.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002180_0013_10030BC601CE76A0"/>
Backbiting Tongues, and other base Practices, have the countenances of Rulers set against them. Nor are their Grave deportments, in their daily Conversation, without use and service this way.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>BY their manifest Aversion from Persons of ill fame, and dissolute Lives.</HI> They loath the practices of Vicious Persons. As the Ru∣ler in Israel: Psal. 26.5. <HI>They hate the Con∣gregation of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked.</HI> They loath the works of them that turn aside to Vicious Courses. <HI>They are the faithful of the Land on whom they set their eyes</HI>; towards whom they manifest their counte∣nances favourable. Psal. 101.3, 6. <HI>Nor will they know,</HI> with approbation, <HI>any wicked Person.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>BY Enacting Laws suited to the Suppression of Immorality and Vice, and the incouragement of Equity and Virtue.</HI> The Laws of the Land shall be adapted by them to the great ends of incouraging them that do well, and the suppression of evil Men, and evil Manners.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>BY looking diligently to the Execution of them.</HI> Rulers will carefully see to it that the Laws answer their proper end; that they be not wrested by evil men, to serve base designs, nor the use of them frustrated by such as Study how to evade their force.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="11" REF="002180_0014_10030BC78DFAACA0"/>5. <HI>BY Rejecting with abhorrence, those Men that would obtain, with Money, Places of Honour and Trust.</HI> They will without any further inquiry determine such Men unfit for any Publick Place or Station. Rulers know that its not <HI>Bribery</HI> but <HI>Virtue</HI> that makes Men sit to represent, as Rulers do, the Person of the Son of GOD. Accordingly they will carefully avoid preferring Men to Publick Places, of base, fordid, selfish Spirits.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>BY throwing out of Place Officers that be evidently Unfaithful to their Trust.</HI> They will hear their testimony against Immorality, by displacing Unfaithful Officers. The Publick shall know that they are not Abetters of any such Men. In this way they will make it known that their Practice is agreeable to their Character in my Text. Immoral Per∣sons shall be divested of their Offices, and dismissed from their Places of Publick Trust.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>BY appointing Persons to keep Publick Houses, who are themselves a terror to sensu∣al, sloathful, vile and base Men.</HI> They will pick our Men in Towns for that Place, that be Men of Honesty and Courage; Men that hate gain by the Sins of other Men; Men that will carefully observe the Laws respect∣ing Taverns; that will discountenance Town∣dwellers,
<PB N="12" REF="002180_0015_10030BCAEF7788F8"/>
and reserve their Publick Houses for such for whom they are by Law designed, Men that regard the Interest of Religion, and prefer the Publick Weal above their Private Interest, shall be the Men for these betrust∣ments. Indeed there are few Men in the Pro∣vince, that have greater advantages, either to prevent, or promote the Ruine of this People, than Tavern-keepers have.</P>
<P N="8">8. Lastly, <HI>BY giving proper Incouragement, and suitable Support to the Gospel-Ministry.</HI> The direct end of that is not only to terrifie Evil-workers; but to eradicate Original Sin it self, from whence all evil works proceed. Its direct tendency is to beat down the Devils Kingdom, and rase the very root of Actual Sin. Accordingly we read, as in Act. 26.18.—<HI>I send thee to open mens eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to GOD.</HI> Thus runs the Commission given to the Gospel Ministry. So in 2 Cor. 10.4. <HI>The weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' GOD, for the pulling down of strong holds.</HI> These strong holds are the obstinate Wills of deeply depraved Men: and for the breaking down of these, to a sub∣mission to GOD's righteousness, is the Gos∣pel Ministry appointed.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002180_0016_10030BD26A0B7938"/>THE great end of Civil Government is, to restrain Mens Corruptions, to prevent Sin from breaking out to that degree to deluge the World; to damm up its Streams, that they may not as a mighty Torrent, carry all before them. This is the great end of Civil Laws, Penalties annexed to them, Punish∣ments inflicted on Malefactors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These things are appointed of GOD as means to restrain Mens exorbitant Lusts.</P>
<P>BUT the tendency of the Gospel-Ministry is, to kill the very root of Sin; to heal the depraved Natures of Men that be tainted and poisoned with it. It tends indeed to curb their Lusts, and keep them from being so Vicious and Prophane, as otherwise they would; but its also appointed as a Means to heal their wretched Natures, and cure them of their Heart-plagues.</P>
<P>RULERS will accordingly see to the In∣couragement and Support of the Gospel-Mi∣nistry. This surely they will do, as knowing that in this way they are a Terror to evil workers.</P>
<P>AND they will do it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BY promoting Learning in the Tongues and Arts.</HI> They know that such Learning is
<PB N="14" REF="002180_0017_10030BD440DC5E10"/>
highly needful to qualifie Persons for the Ministry; and that our Fathers that setled this Country, even in the Infancy and Poverty of it, were accordingly at charge to erect a College for Education, beyond what was to be had in Grammar Schools.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY discountenancing the folly of People in Choosing Ministers according to their vain Fancies, without regard either to the Civil Law, or Scripture-qualifications.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>BY taking care that Ministers be not Necessitated to leave their Studies, to prevent the Starving of their Families.</HI> And on this I may presume, as concluding it well known to our Rulers. (1) <HI>That the Gospel Ministry ought to be Maintained, and that honourably by the People. The Lord has ordained that they that Preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.14. He wills, that while People par∣take of their Spiritual Things, they should partake of their Carnal things, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.11. And declares it reasonable from the very light of Nature, and usage of Nations, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7. (2) <HI>Consequently, that People ordinarily, are able to Maintain the Ministry among them.</HI> Being commanded so to do, they have ability there-unto. Were it not thus, certainly such a Precept had never been given them of GOD. It is true, that respecting some Spiritual
<PB N="15" REF="002180_0018_10030174CA91BBF8"/>
duties required of Men, we can't argue from the Command, an ability to obey: but respecting any external acts of Obedience, the argument seems to be strong, from GOD's Precept, to argue ability in People to yield Obedience. Accordingly, People ordinarily are able to Maintain and that decently and honourably, the Gospel-Ministry among them. (3) <HI>That People do not ordinarily thus Main∣tain it.</HI> I speak not this to reflect on any Place or People: but I take it to be evident to Judicious Rulers, that thus it is. (4) <HI>That GOD has authorized them to see that Justice be herein done to the Ministry.</HI> And, (5) <HI>That it will be for the Interest of People themselves, that their Ministers have just dealing in this regard from them.</HI> Rulers know that this will tend not to their Poverty, but their Prosperity. Sure I am that the Scripture thus affirms. Prov. 3.9, 10. <HI>Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thy increase. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,</HI> &amp;c. Mal. 3.10. <HI>Bring ye all the tithes in to the Store-house, that there may be Meat in mine house; and prove me now here∣with, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a blessing,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I pass now to the Improvement of the Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002180_0019_10030BDADDA06190"/>USE, I. Is by way of Caution.</P>
<P><HI>THAT absolute perfection be not expected from any Order of Men whatsoever.</HI> We are not in the State of Innocency, with <HI>Adam</HI> be∣fore the fall. Nor do we live among the Stars, where the proper Orbs are kept, and all the Motions regular. We live in a Cursed, and a Wicked World. Sin and Cor∣ruption, darkness and error have infested every Society of Men. Rulers, whither Civil or Ecclesiastical; People, whither in the State or Church, labour under the deadly fruits of the first Apostacy. There is not a Person among us, but often wanders out of his way. Jam. 3.2. <HI>In many things we all offend.</HI> Ab∣solute Perfection then, is not to be expected among us. Nor ought it to be a stumbling-block to any, that it is not found.</P>
<P>THERE was not unmixed Equity in the Civil State, no, not in <HI>Solomons</HI> time. Eccl. 3.16. <HI>I saw under the Sun the place of Judg∣ment, that wickedness was there, and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</HI> Nor are all things right in the Ecclesiastick Polity in any Age; whither among Pastors, or Peo∣ple; Rulers, or Ruled. Nor may it be ex∣pected while the word holds good, in Jer. 17.9. <HI>The heart of man is deceitful above all
<PB N="17" REF="002180_0020_10030BE288F25FF0"/>
things, and desperately wicked.</HI> Indeed that word, if duely thought of, will stain the Pride of all humane glory; and lay every Man, from the King on the Throne, to the Beggar in the Street, in the dust, before GOD.</P>
<P>AGAIN, People, through Ignorance and want of Judgment, may think that amiss in Rulers, which indeed is not so. Acts of Rulers may be sometimes ill resented, for want of knowing the true ground and reason of them.</P>
<P>AND again, Errors in Government may oft proceed from the Iniquities of People, as the moral cause thereof. If that be some∣times true, <HI>Delirant Reges, plectuntur Ach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i</HI>; that is infallibly true, in Prov. 28.2. <HI>For the transgression of a Land, many are the Princes thereof.</HI> And so as to other afflictive evils relating to Government.</P>
<P>USE, II. Is of Instruction &amp; Exhortation.</P>
<P>ARE Rulers a Terror to evil Workers: Then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHAT will GOD Himself, the Gover∣nour of the World be? He is the Judge of all the Earth,</HI> Gen. 18.25. <HI>Justice and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne.</HI> And what will
<PB N="18" REF="002180_0021_10030BE44C17B018"/>
become of wicked-workers then, when they fall into His Hand? That will be found a solemn Truth, in Heb. 10.31. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD.</HI> It were much better for wicked men never to have been born, than thus to fall into the Hands of this GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>RULERS then are a great blessing to a wretched World.</HI> Were not evil-workers terrified by Rulers, the World would soon be Uninhabitable. Men would not be able to live one among another. They would be in an higher degree than now they are, as described in Hab. 1.14. <HI>As the Fishes of the Sea, devouring one another.</HI> Tyranny its self is less bad than Anarchy. But Rulers ruling in the fear of GOD, are indeed great bles∣sings. Unto their Rule, under GOD, is the Peace and Tranquillity of a People very much owing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>OUR Rulers then, will mind their Cha∣racter, given in my Text.</HI> Its the inspired Apostle that saith, <HI>Rulers are a Terror to evil works.</HI> A great part of this Assembly are Rulers. Will each One ever bear in Mind, ever make proper and beneficial re∣flections on this their Character; <HI>Rulers are a Terror, not to good, but to evil works.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="19" REF="002180_0022_10030BE940D057F0"/>4. <HI>THANK we GOD for Rulers.</HI> Let them be accounted among the rich, tho' but common blessings of a Land. Rulers ruling in the fear of G0D; doing Justice &amp; Judg∣ment; seeking the wealth of their People, are a great and a rich blessing. <HI>These are the Shields of the Earth,</HI> Psal. 47.9. <HI>They bear up the Pillars of a Land,</HI> as in Psal. 75.3. What a Chaos of confusion, and field of blood would the World presently be, were it not for Go∣vernment. Let Rulers then be acknowledged as great blessings to our Land.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>LET all Pray for them, that they may ever be a Terror to evil-workers.</HI> This is the Preceptive Will of GOD, in 1 Tim. 2.2. <HI>Let Prayer be made for Kings, and for all that be in Authority.</HI> Hitherto few if any People in the World have been favoured by GOD, in respect of Government, as <HI>New-England</HI> has been. Let GOD be sought, for the continu∣ance of this Favour. And let none contri∣bute by their ingratitude, to the forfeiture of it.</P>
<P>I conclude only with two words, which have evidently much of awe and solemnity in them. And they are directed to the two constituent parts of this great Assembly, <HI>viz.</HI> Rulers, and Ruled, And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="20" REF="002180_0023_1003017ADA804188"/>1. WILL <HI>our Rulers think how they repre∣sent the very Person of the Incarnate SON of GOD.</HI> That Sacred Person is verily repre∣sented by You. Its His Authority you are invested with; for He is not only the Head of the Church, <HI>but the head over all things to the Church,</HI> Eph. 1.22. All Power is given to Him as Mediator. And with His Kingly Power, by Participation, Civil Rulers are in∣vested. On this account they are called <HI>gods,</HI> in <HI>Psal.</HI> 82.6.</P>
<P>ITS true, it is so, and more than barely so, respecting Ecclesiastical Rulers: They also represent His very Person, and that not in one only, but in all His Offices, Propheti∣cal, Priestly, and Kingly. I do not say, That they represent His person in all Parts of all His Offices, but in all His Offices. His Pro∣phetical Office, they represent, in Speaking from GOD unto the People; His Priestly Office, in Praying for them; and His Kingly, in Ruling of them. Accordingly we read, as in Joh.20. 21. —<HI>As my Father hath sent me, so send I you.</HI> Heb. 13.17. <HI>Obey them that have the rule ever you.</HI> Mat. 28.19. <HI>Go and teach all Nations.</HI> James 5. 14. <HI>Let the Elders of the Church Pray for him.</HI> Thus do they represent the Person of CHRIST. Nor are their Commissions less Authentick, but less
<PB N="21" REF="002180_0024_10030BEEB6E567E0"/>
Mediate from Soveraign Power, than those of Them in Civil Government. And it may accordingly seem strange, that any that be acquainted with the Bible, should either in their Prints, or Practice, assign them their Place at the Peoples feet.</P>
<P>But when Rulers, whither Civil or Ec∣clesiastick, think, whose glorious Person is represented by them, How solemn will be the thought! What awful impressions will it make on their Spirits! What manner of Persons will they think themselves obliged to be in an holy unblamable Conversation! None in the World are under such solemn and strong ties, as these, to regard &amp; obey that Precept, in Eph. 5.15. <HI>See then that ye walk circumspectly.</HI> Beware of so much as a wry Step, left the infinite Person represented by you, be thereby reflected on, and disho∣noured; least His Great Name be blasphe∣med by your means.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>LET People, who make the other consti∣tuent Part of this Assembly, regard you, Civil Rulers, as being of this Character.</HI> Know, that they represent the Person, and are cloathed with the Authority of GOD the SON. They are on this account termed, as in Psai. 82.6. <HI>The Children of the Most High.</HI> Thus then regard them, and deport your selves accordingly toward them. And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="22" REF="002180_0025_1003017F98F30A08"/>1. <HI>DO not conclude their acts in Govern∣ment to be necessarily amiss, because you can't presently see the ground and reason of them.</HI> Things done may be reasonable, just and e∣qual, tho' every eye can't presently discern the reasonableness, equality, and justice of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WITH-hold not the respect and honour from them, which is their due, in regard of their Character.</HI> Honour them, as representing the Person, and cloathed with the Authority a∣bove mentioned. Honour is their due, and accordingly they should have it, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>CHEARFULLY Pay them their Tri∣bute what is owing to them, on the account of the continual Service they do for you.</HI> Unto this Justice it self obliges you: and the ground to enforce to the doing Justly in this regard the Apostle has given us, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.6. having said that Tribute was paid to Civil Rulers, he gives the ground of it, <HI>viz. For they are God's Ministers, attending continually on this very thing.</HI></P>
