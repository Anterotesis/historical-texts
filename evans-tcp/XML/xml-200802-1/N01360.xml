<P>IF he that has this brief ESSAY now in his hand, be indeed the READER of it, he will find himself <HI>there</HI> suffici∣ently informed of the occasion. The Book∣seller having his Family wounded, by a sudden Death upon his nearest Relative, the Evening before the SERMON was Preached, he was willing, as to <HI>Get Good</HI> himself, so to <HI>Do Good</HI> unto others, on the Occasion, by publishing what he thought suitable, not only unto himself, but also unto all that can cast an Eye upon it. It was a very short Sermon, delivered when the Preacher was Confined unto such an One by a very Cold Season; But if the Blessing of God accompany this <HI>Exhortati∣on of a Few Words,</HI> and very Right Ones, he knows, the Publication will not be Re∣pented of▪</P>

<P>ONE who <HI>Lives</HI> in the midst of <HI>Deaths,</HI> may find cause to <HI>say so.</HI> One who feels <HI>with∣in</HI> him, that which bids him reckon his own among the many <HI>Deaths</HI> without him, can't but <HI>say so.</HI> One who has in less than <HI>Two Weeks,</HI> had <HI>Five Deaths</HI> in his Family, would be very senseless, if he should not <HI>say so.</HI> May
<PB N="2" REF="001617_0004_0FB3E72579A93718"/>
it now be <HI>said</HI> by every One of us, in so Significant and so Religious a manner, as it ought to be.</P>
<P>Our Apostle speaks it, because he was <HI>Daily</HI> Exposed to <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>Daily</HI> Ex∣pecting of it. His <HI>Dying Daily,</HI> was his being <HI>Daily</HI> willing to Dy, and his <HI>Daily</HI> Laying himself open in the Cause of Christ, unto the utmost Hazards of <HI>Death.</HI> God Enkindled and Preserved this <HI>Piety</HI> in him, and his Fellow-Souldiers, with the perswasion of a <HI>Resurrection from the Dead.</HI> A <HI>perswasion</HI> productive of so much <HI>Piety</HI>; and having a Tendency to such an <HI>Holy Life,</HI> and such a Triumph over the <HI>Fear of Death,</HI> is doubtless of GOD. Such a <HI>per∣swasion</HI> doubtless is no <HI>Delusion.</HI> We may therefore go on perswaded of a <HI>Resurrecti∣on from the Dead</HI>; We shall not be Decei∣ved in it. Our Apostle is proving the <HI>Resurrection</HI> with it. Q. E. D. This is what our Apostle upon the <HI>Demonstration</HI> of.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which I will present you withal, shall be this;
<Q>There is a Dying Daily, which true Christians Live in the practice of.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001617_0005_0FB3E7270610AC60"/><HI>Dying Daily,</HI> will be, as the <HI>Condition</HI> of every Christian, so, the <HI>Exercise</HI> of every <HI>Lively</HI> Christian. <HI>Dying Daily</HI> is a Mystery of <HI>Practical Christianity,</HI> which we ought all to <HI>Live</HI> in the Study of.</P>
<P>Tis not so much that which is our <HI>Con∣dition,</HI> as that which is to be our <HI>Endeavour,</HI> that I shall insist upon.</P>
<P>The Case to be insisted on, is this;
<Q>What is the DYING DAILY, which a Chri∣stian is to Live in the practice of?</Q></P>
<P N="1">I. A <HI>Lively Sense</HI> of our <HI>Daily Progress</HI> to our <HI>Death,</HI> yea, a <HI>Daily Sense</HI> of it, revived on all occasions, this will be in our <HI>Dying Daily.</HI> We must never Lay aside, a Sense of our <HI>Mortality.</HI> To Lay that aside, is <HI>Folly</HI> in its Exaltation, <HI>Madness</HI> in its Ex∣tremity. Tis most certain, That we are <HI>Dying:</HI> It is the Thing <HI>appointed</HI> for us; It is unavoidable. The Whole World of Mankind Unites in the Accomplishment of that word; Psal. LXXXIX. 49. <HI>Who is that man that shall live and shall not see Death</HI>? To Go to the <HI>Grave,</HI> is to go in the <HI>way of all the Earth.</HI> The <HI>Grave,</HI> O man, Tis <HI>Whi∣ther
<PB N="4" REF="001617_0006_0FB3E72889AF10A0"/>
thou art Going.</HI> There is no man a∣live, whom this Advice may not be ad∣dress'd unto▪ Oh! Let this Apprehension be continually kept <HI>alive</HI> in our minds: Job XXX. 23. <HI>I know that thou wilt bring me to Death, and to the House assigned for all the Living.</HI> Every Time the <HI>Sun</HI> sets, we should be sensible, we are one Day nearer to our <HI>Death,</HI> than we were when it rose. And every Time the <HI>Clock</HI> strikes, we may be sensible, we are one Hour nearer to our <HI>Death,</HI> than we were sixty minutes ago. Yea, 'Tis a <HI>Quick progress</HI> that we are ma∣king to our <HI>Death.</HI> We shall <HI>Quickly</HI> ar∣rive unto it. Our <HI>Life</HI> is a <HI>Race</HI> very Quickly run. We are upon the Wing un∣to the Grave. Tis very <HI>Livelily</HI> set forth unto us; Job IX. 25, 26. <HI>Swifter than a Post, yea, as the Ships of Dispatch,</HI> yea, <HI>as the Eagle which flies after the Prey.</HI> With what <HI>Haste,</HI> Oh! What <HI>Haste</HI> are we Dispatch∣ing the <HI>Course</HI> of our Life! The Psalmist said unto the Lord, <HI>Remember how short my Time</HI> is! The Lord says unto the Christi∣an, <HI>Do thou Remember how short thy Time</HI> is. If our Dayes are but as an <HI>Hands-breadth</HI>; And if the progress of our Dayes be that

of a <HI>Weavers Shuttle</HI>; Then say, O <HI>Dying Man</HI>; How near thou art unto thy <HI>Death.</HI> Truly, The <HI>Day is near, it is near, and it hasteth greatly!</HI> To Dy Daily, is to do that wise Thing; the thing so ardently wish'd for; Psal. XC. 12. <HI>So to Number our Dayes, as to apply our Hearts unto Wisdom.</HI> Now, in <HI>Dying Daily,</HI> it is requisite, <HI>First,</HI> That we have some <HI>Daily Meditation</HI> on our <HI>Death</HI>; yea, that in our Meditation, we look on our <HI>Death,</HI> as both <HI>Certain</HI> and <HI>Speedy</HI> too. Oh! Don't put <HI>far away the Day</HI>! This will render it an <HI>Evil Day!</HI> Not one Day should pass us without some▪ Thoughts of this Importance,
<Q>I am a Dy∣ing man, and it cannot be Long before I am Dead!</Q>
Yea, 'tis requisite, <HI>Secondly</HI>; That the <HI>Occasions</HI> which Daily occur to Blow up this <HI>Meditation,</HI> should not pass unob∣served with us. <HI>Every Day</HI> brings to us fresh <HI>Monitors,</HI> to put us in mind of this, <HI>That we are to Dy in a very little while.</HI> We should not be Deaf to the Admonitions: On our <HI>Tables,</HI> we are fed by the <HI>Dead.</HI> We should infer, '<HI>This Food will not keep me 'always from Death.</HI> In our <HI>Habits</HI> we are cloath'd from the <HI>Dead.</HI> We should in∣fer,
<PB N="6" REF="001617_0008_0FB3E72B77C55418"/>
<HI>I am covered with the Shadow of Death.</HI> We attend upon <HI>Funerals,</HI> and follow the <HI>Dead.</HI> It should be with such Thoughts as these; <HI>I am shortly to follow, my Turn is coming; It won't be long before I am carried unto my Long Home.</HI> Every <HI>Bell</HI> tolled for the <HI>Dead,</HI> should ring such a peal as this in our Ears. When the <HI>Night</HI> comes, we should often think; <HI>My Night is coming!</HI> When we put off our <HI>Garments,</HI> we should often think; <HI>I am shortly to put off this Earthly Tabernacle!</HI> When we Ly down in our <HI>Bed,</HI> we should often think; <HI>My Grave will shortly be my Bed!</HI> We <HI>Dy Daily,</HI> when we keep up such a <HI>Daily Sense</HI> of this, That we are to <HI>Die Quickly!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. In our <HI>Dying Daily,</HI> we are <HI>Every Day</HI> to keep Alive a prudent, perpetual, reaso∣nable <HI>Suspicion,</HI> That <HI>this</HI> may prove our <HI>Dying Day.</HI> There is a Maxim of Wis∣dom, which we ought to Live under the <HI>Daily</HI> power of; Prov. XXVII. 7. <HI>Thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> It is very sure, we must see our <HI>Last Day.</HI> And we are sure of <HI>no Day</HI> that comes, That it will not be our <HI>Last.</HI> We should
<PB N="7" REF="001617_0009_0FB3E72D1231DE10"/>
often think in a <HI>Morning,</HI> 'For ought I 'know, I may Dy before the Evening. We should often think in an Evening, 'For ought I know, I may Dy before the 'Morning. When we take our <HI>Leave</HI> of a Friend, we should often think,
<Q>For ought I know, we may never see one another again.</Q>
When we hear a <HI>Sermon,</HI> we should often think,
<Q>For ought I know this is the Last Sermon I shall hear among the Peo∣ple of God.</Q>
When we make a Prayer, we should often think,
<Q>For ought I know, this is the last Prayer I shall make before my Breath be stopt!</Q>
Such <HI>Dying Tho'ts</HI> as these, are extreamly countenanced, by our Circumstances in the World. Our Circumstances are tho; Jam. IV. 14. <HI>What is your Life? Tis a vapour that appears a little while, and vanishes away.</HI> Those, Eccl. IX. 12. <HI>Man knoweth not his Time. All A∣ges</HI> are Liable to the Stroke of Death! They that are under <HI>Six,</HI> are as Likely to Dy, as they that are beyond <HI>Sixty:</HI> And more Dy so. At this very Time, there Lies Dead in our Neighbourhood, An A∣ged, Pious, Useful Servant of God, an <HI>El∣der</HI>

of a Church, near Fourscore; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Elder</HI> John Copp.</NOTE> And an <HI>Infant</HI> that was yet in the Cradle. The Stroke of <HI>Death,</HI> is also given sometimes very <HI>Suddenly.</HI> Persons are well one day, Dead the next. Last Night, an affecting Instance of it. A Young Woman <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mrs.</HI> Mary Boone.</NOTE> well one hour, tending her Sick <HI>Son</HI>; the next hour Dead, and Leaving her Tender Husband in Tears. A <HI>Last Day</HI> must come; And there comes <HI>no Day,</HI> but, for ought we know, may be our <HI>Last.</HI> For us, to be moderately, and rationally, <HI>Suspicious,</HI> of <HI>Every Day! This may be my Last!</HI> Verily, There is an in∣comparable <HI>Discretion</HI> in it. For us, to make <HI>provision</HI> accordingly, would be very <HI>discreetly</HI> done. Such Thoughts, how much would they Mortifie our <HI>Vanities,</HI> Animate our <HI>Devotions,</HI> Regulate all our <HI>Behaviours,</HI> if they had a due Efficacy upon us! We <HI>Dy Daily,</HI> in such Thoughts as these; And we take a Course to <HI>Live unto God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Dying Daily</HI> will imply, that we should <HI>every Day</HI> be <HI>Ready</HI> and <HI>Willing</HI> to
<PB N="9" REF="001617_0011_0FB3E7329A4D8D10"/>
<HI>Dy.</HI> Our Apostle having said, <HI>We stand in jeopardy every Hour</HI>; then adds, <HI>I Dy Daily.</HI> A man <HI>Dies Daily,</HI> when his Life is in <HI>daily Jeopardy,</HI> for the Cause of Christ, and of His People. A man that ventures his <HI>Life,</HI> that he may Serve a Good Inte∣rest, is One who <HI>Dies Daily.</HI> We should be always <HI>Ready</HI> and <HI>Willing</HI> to <HI>Die,</HI> when∣ever the Great <HI>Lord of our Life</HI> shall call us to it; and say, Psal. CXIX. 109. <HI>My Soul is continually in my Hand.</HI> Q. D. My <HI>Soul,</HI> and my <HI>Life,</HI> I stand Ready and Wil∣ling, to make an <HI>Offering</HI> of it. The <HI>Spi∣rit of Martyrdom,</HI> is ONE thing that be∣longs to <HI>Dying Daily.</HI> We ought to sup∣pose, that we may be call'd unto, the Death of a <HI>Martyr,</HI> in bearing a Testimony to the Truths of God: That we may not <HI>Love our Lives unto the Death,</HI> nor hold them till they may terminate in a <HI>Natural Death.</HI> Supposing that we may be put upon <HI>Dying</HI> by the <HI>Fist of Wickedness,</HI> for our Disposition to <HI>Live Godlily,</HI> we must have a mind that shall be <HI>daily Resolved</HI> for it. To <HI>Die Daily,</HI> is to be in a <HI>Daily</HI> and fixed Resolution, to undergo whate¦ver <HI>Sufferings,</HI> our Fidelity to the King¦dom
<PB N="10" REF="001617_0012_0FB3E733CAF49C78"/>
of our Saviour may bring upon us. We must be Daily of that mind, Act. XX. 24. <HI>None of these things move me, neither is my Life precious to me, so that I may but fi∣nish my Course with Joy.</HI> But then, If the <HI>Lord of our Life</HI> put us upon <HI>Dying</HI> only in the way of His <HI>Common Providence,</HI> and in the manner and method of Nature in its Decays; This is <HI>Daily</HI>; and Readily, and Willingly to be submitted to. We ought every Day, to keep in a <HI>Dying Frame</HI>; Ready and Willing to Entertain our <HI>Death</HI> with all possible <HI>Resignation,</HI> if <HI>this</HI> be the Day, which the Lord of our Life has ordered for it. Our <HI>Daily Frame</HI> should be this;
<Q>Lord, <HI>My Life</HI> is entire∣ly at thy Dispose; And if thou wilt have <HI>this Day,</HI> to be the <HI>Day of my Death,</HI> I will not Rebel against thy <HI>Order. Thy Will be done!</HI></Q>
A man <HI>does,</HI> what he <HI>Con∣sents</HI> to do. He who <HI>Consents</HI> every Day to <HI>Dy,</HI> if God shall please to say, <HI>I will have this to be the Day!</HI> Such an one <HI>dies Daily.</HI> To <HI>Die Daily,</HI> is every Day to say with him; Luke II. 29. <HI>Lord, Now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace.</HI> The Lan∣guage of a Souldier in his weary Station,
<PB N="11" REF="001617_0013_0FB3E73542201910"/>
ready to Draw off, whenever His Great <HI>Commander</HI> shall give the word for it.</P>
<P N="4">IV. To Die Daily, is to <HI>Do Daily</HI> those Things, which must be done, by every one that would Hope to <HI>Die Safely. Dying Daily,</HI> is Living in a <HI>Daily preparation for Death.</HI> It is demanded of us; Mat. XXIV. 44. <HI>Be ye Ready.</HI> We <HI>prepare for Death,</HI> and so for the Coming of our Saviour to Raise us from the Dead, by Doing those Things, of which the Divine Ora∣cle tells us, <HI>They are the things that accom¦pany Salvation.</HI> To <HI>Do</HI> such Things <HI>Dai∣ly,</HI> that so our <HI>Death</HI> whenever it comes may find us <HI>prepared</HI> for it, this is to <HI>Die Daily.</HI> My Hearers, I now demand of you, the greatest Attention, that ever you gave to any thing in the World▪ <HI>Oh! Hearken to me, that God may hearken to you another Day.</HI></P>
<P>There must be first, an <HI>Habitual pre¦paration</HI> for Death. And one who <HI>Die Daily,</HI> is one who is <HI>Daily doing</HI> of some∣thing towards <HI>this</HI> preparation: <HI>Daily</HI> gi¦ving some Good Strokes at the Work which must be done, by all that would
<PB N="12" REF="001617_0014_0FB3E736DA507EF8"/>
propose to <HI>Die</HI> in Good Terms with Hea∣ven. You shall have it set before you. One Thing is this. He that would be <HI>prepared</HI> for Death, must be <HI>Righteous.</HI> We read, Prov. XIV. 32. It is the <HI>Righteous</HI> who has <HI>Hope in his Death.</HI> At our <HI>Death,</HI> we are in an <HI>Hopeless,</HI> Undone, Forlorn plight, if we are not furnished with a perfect and spotless <HI>Righteousness,</HI> wherein we may stand before the Judgment Seat of God. We cannot obtain such a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> but by Accepting of, and Relying on, that <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which our Saviour has in His <HI>Obedience</HI> as our <HI>Surety</HI> unto God, pro∣vided for us. Well then; We must by <HI>faith</HI> make our <HI>Daily Flight</HI> unto the <HI>Righ∣teousness of God.</HI> It must be our <HI>Daily</HI> course, Thankfully, Joyfully, Heartily to <HI>Receive the Righteousness</HI> of the Blessed Je∣sus, as the <HI>Free Gift</HI> of God, that we may lead it as our Title to Everlasting Hap∣piness. It must be our <HI>Daily</HI> care that we do not continue under the <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin, &amp; the <HI>Cause</HI> of God, but present before God, the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of our Blessed Jesus, for our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Thus it is to <HI>Dy Daily.</HI> A∣nother Thing is this. He that wou'd be
<PB N="13" REF="001617_0015_0FB3E738443364C8"/>
<HI>prepared</HI> for Death, must be <HI>Holy.</HI> We read, Heb, XII 14. <HI>Without Holiness, no man shall see the Lord. Holiness,</HI> will be the <HI>Mark</HI> by which all that at their <HI>Death,</HI> en∣ter into the <HI>Strait Gate,</HI> will be distinguish∣ed. <HI>Holiness,</HI> which Lies in a mind Re∣newed with a principle of <HI>Grace</HI> infused into it: <HI>Holiness,</HI> which Lies in an Heart principled with the predominant <HI>Love</HI> of God: <HI>Wo</HI> to us, if we are Strangers to this! Well then; It must be our <HI>Daily</HI> Study to get our <HI>Enmity</HI> to God all sub∣dued. We must be <HI>Daily</HI> Learning to Fear <HI>God,</HI> &amp; Prize <HI>Christ,</HI> &amp; Hate <HI>Sin,</HI> and perfect <HI>Holiness in the Fear of God.</HI> We must be <HI>Daily</HI> Labouring to get the <HI>Image</HI> of Satan melted out of our Souls, and the <HI>Image</HI> of our Saviour gaining and growing in us. This is to <HI>Die Daily.</HI> A Third Thing is this. He that would be prepa∣red for Death, must be able to give up a <HI>Good Account</HI> unto God, in the Judgment that comes after Death. We read, Rom▪ XIV. 12. <HI>Every one of us. shall give an Ac∣count of himself unto God.</HI> There is a <HI>Work</HI> which our Lord has assigned us to do in the World. Our <HI>Work</HI> is, To render &amp; pro¦cure
<PB N="14" REF="001617_0016_0FB3E73A8A139318"/>
<HI>Acknowledgments</HI> unto God. We shall after <HI>Death,</HI> be called to an <HI>Account</HI> con∣cerning our <HI>Work.</HI> It must then be our <HI>Daily</HI> Concern, by <HI>Repentance</HI> to get the pardon of all our Miscarriages about the <HI>Work</HI> of God; and by <HI>Diligence</HI> in this <HI>Work,</HI> to be capable of <HI>Giving up our Ac∣count with Joy, and not with Grief.</HI> This 'tis to <HI>Die Daily.</HI> We have a Term of <HI>Time</HI> allow'd unto us up on Earth; A <HI>Time,</HI> which Flies away like the <HI>Shadow</HI> of a <HI>Bird</HI> upon the Wing; which is the Chaldee Paraprase, for, <HI>Our Dayes are as the Shadow.</HI> We shall after <HI>Death,</HI> be called to an Account how we have spent our <HI>Time.</HI> It must then be our <HI>Daily</HI> Concern, to Lay out our <HI>Time</HI> in such Purposes, and Actions, that we may not be thunder struck from our Judge, with, O <HI>Slothful, and Wicked Servant!</HI> This is to <HI>Die Daily.</HI> We are betrusted with <HI>Talents</HI> from our Lord. We are <HI>Talented</HI> with various <HI>Blessings</HI>; with Opportunities to <HI>Do Good.</HI> After <HI>Death,</HI> our <HI>Talents</HI> must be Accounted for; how much, how well, we have improved them. It must be our <HI>Daily</HI> Concern, To Glorify God with all our Talents; To project, and pursue all
<PB N="15" REF="001617_0017_0FB3E73B48942EA8"/>
imaginable wayes for the Glorifying of Him. This 'tis to <HI>Die Daily.</HI></P>
<P>But then, there must be likewise an <HI>Actual preparation</HI> for Death, And one who <HI>Dies Daily,</HI> is one who is <HI>Daily doing</HI> of something towards this preparation also. To be <HI>Actually prepared</HI> for Death, is to be <HI>Daily</HI> imployed in such points of a <HI>Godly Life</HI> as are pleasing to God. It is in a <HI>Daily Exercise</HI> to <HI>keep a Conscience void of offence.</HI> It is in a <HI>Daily</HI> compliance with the Famous Direction, <HI>Be thou in the Fear of the Lord all the Day long.</HI> We read in Luke XII. 43. <HI>Blessed is that Servant, whom his Lord when He cometh, shall find so Doing.</HI> To be <HI>Actually prepared</HI> for Death, is to be <HI>Daily doing</HI> of that, which if our <HI>Death</HI> should come <HI>this Day</HI> unto us, it would be no Damage unto us, to be found <HI>so doing.</HI> My Fellow Travellers; Keep your <HI>Assu∣rance</HI> for Heaven so fair and clear, that the Approach of <HI>Death</HI> may not make you <HI>a∣fraid with any amazement.</HI> Keep your Souls in such an <HI>Heavenly Frame,</HI> that the Ad∣vance of <HI>Death</HI> may not find you indispo∣sed for a <HI>Translation</HI> to a Better World. Be <HI>Daily</HI> Engaged in such <HI>Services,</HI> that it
<PB N="16" REF="001617_0018_0FB3E73E1AE4F2E0"/>
may be no Disadvantage for you, to be found so Engaged. This 'tis to <HI>Die Dai∣ly.</HI> One thing more: <HI>Every Night</HI> a man who <HI>Dies daily,</HI> will bestow some Thoughts on that Question, <HI>If I Die this Night, is all well with me? If I Die this Night, am I sure of a Better Life!</HI>
<Q>Do I fall Asleep this <HI>Night</HI> in the Arms of a Faithful Savi∣our.</Q>
<HI>Non prius in dulcem declinent Lumi∣na Somnum.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. We are to <HI>Die Daily,</HI> by <HI>Dying to the World every Day,</HI> and becoming <HI>Dead</HI> in respect of our Worldly Inclinations. To <HI>Die Daily,</HI> is to proceed <HI>every Day</HI> in the Work of <HI>Mortification</HI> to the <HI>World: Every Day</HI> to be at that Work; Gal. VI. 14. <HI>I am crucified unto the World.</HI> A man who <HI>Dies Daily,</HI> is one who has in him such Sen∣timents of this World, as <HI>Dying Men</HI> use to have. Come to a <HI>Dying Man,</HI> and ask him, <HI>How this World appears to him?</HI> His Answer will be;
<Q>Tis a <HI>Vain</HI> World, a <HI>False</HI> World; It is a miserable Thing to be put off with a <HI>portion in this World:</HI> He is a very foolish and wretched man, who makes it his main Business to Lay up
<PB N="17" REF="001617_0019_0FB3E73EF4048B28"/>
a <HI>portion in this World.</HI> The Favour of <HI>God,</HI> and an Interest in a Great <HI>Saviour,</HI> is a thousand times more valuable than <HI>all this World</HI>; is worth <HI>ten thousand Worlds.</HI></Q>
To <HI>Die Daily,</HI> is to Live un∣der the Force of such Sentiments; To <HI>Think</HI> of <HI>this World,</HI> as <HI>Dying Men</HI> do, and <HI>Live</HI> in this World as <HI>Dying Men</HI> wish to have done. But then, there is this in it: A <HI>Death</HI> upon our Dis∣positions for <HI>this World.</HI> It is true, And, Oh! When shall we have the <HI>Skill</HI> to place things in their due <HI>Subordination! O thou glorious and liberal Giver of Wis∣dom, Do thou give this Wisdom unto us!</HI>— I would say, it is true, So far as the Enjoyments of <HI>this world,</HI> may be <HI>Subor∣dinate</HI> unto God, we are to Love them, and Seek them: So far as the <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> of God will direct us to do so, we are to Love and Seek the En∣joyments of <HI>this world.</HI> There is the <HI>Love of God</HI> in it, when we mind <HI>this world</HI> but in a Subordination unto GOD. But any further than we may <HI>Obey GOD,</HI> and <HI>Honour GOD,</HI> and be <HI>Led unto GOD,</HI> by <HI>this world,</HI> we must be <HI>Dead</HI> unto it.

This <HI>Dying to the World,</HI> is the same with the <HI>Dying to Sin,</HI> which is required of us: For our Sin lies in Departing from <HI>God,</HI> both to and for the <HI>World.</HI> A <HI>Death,</HI> A <HI>Death,</HI> upon our Dispositions, for <HI>this world</HI>; This is a Thing to be <HI>Daily</HI> maintained, a thing to be <HI>Daily</HI> studied; And therein, we are to <HI>Die Daily.</HI> The <HI>Dead,</HI> how are they Disposed for <HI>this world</HI>? We read Eccl. IX. 6. <HI>Their Love, and their Hatred and their Envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</HI> Such a <HI>Death</HI> we should have on, and give to, our <HI>Pas∣sions</HI> for <HI>this world</HI>; An Holy <HI>Indifferency</HI> or all the Enjoyments of this World. There should be a <HI>Death</HI> upon our <HI>Esteem</HI> for this world. We are to look upon this World, as a <HI>Despicable</HI> Thing; the <HI>Plea∣sures</HI> of it, as Polluting Things; the <HI>Riches</HI> of it, as Deceitful Things; the <HI>Honours</HI> of it, as Empty Nothings. There should be a <HI>Death</HI> upon our <HI>Desire</HI> for this world. We are no more to be so <HI>Hungry</HI> &amp; <HI>Thirsty</HI> after this World, as carnal minds use to be: Our <HI>Appetite</HI> for it, this must be pall'd, and lost, and gone: We must see

no charming <HI>Beauty</HI> in it. There should be a <HI>Death</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our <HI>Delight</HI> in this World. This World should not be any part of our <HI>Glory:</HI> The Things of it, we should reck∣on as <HI>Toyes</HI> only for Children to be pleased withal; not for <HI>Strong men in Christ:</HI> Such <HI>Toyes,</HI> too low, too mean, to be our <HI>Joyes,</HI> while our <HI>Spirit may rejoice in God our Savi∣our.</HI> There should be a <HI>Death</HI> upon our <HI>Expectation</HI> from this World. We should not promise to our selves, a <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in and from a World, which is but a Lump of meer <HI>Vanity. Dream</HI> not, that it will prove any other than a <HI>Dream,</HI> any better than a <HI>Shadow.</HI> Despair of ever finding a∣ny <HI>Content</HI> in any Creature. Lay aside the <HI>Hopes</HI> of any Happiness from such a world▪ Finally. Our <HI>Irascible Affections</HI> for this World, must also have a <HI>Death</HI> upon them. We must not be very much <HI>Displeased</HI> at those men, and those things, that hinder us from getting the <HI>Great Things</HI> of this Little World: Be not sensible of any mighty Harm done unto us, when we are <HI>Clogg'd</HI> in our Attempts to <HI>grow Great</HI> in this World. Swell not with <HI>Malice</HI> and <HI>Envy</HI> at them who stand in the way of our

Advancement. Baulk no <HI>Duty</HI> to get this World; Let no <HI>Snares</HI> be run into, be∣cause <HI>we will be Rich</HI>; Break not our Hearts with <HI>Worldly Sorrow,</HI> when we Lose this World; <HI>Bear Losses,</HI> Easily, Patiently, Suitably. Whatever <HI>Grievous Things</HI> befal us in this World, we must be but mode∣rately <HI>Grieved</HI> for them. The Temper prescribed unto us, is that, 1 Cor. VII. 30, 31. <HI>They that weep, should be as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as tho' they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as tho' they possessed not.</HI> This it is to <HI>Die Daily.</HI> Such <HI>Dead men,</HI> are in reality, the only <HI>Living</HI> Ones. These <HI>Dead,</HI> O Lord, <HI>What Won∣ders wilt thou shew unto them</HI>!</P>
<P N="6">VI. We are to <HI>Die Daily,</HI> by <HI>Daily meeting</HI> with <HI>Afflictions,</HI> and by <HI>Daily Bea∣ring</HI> of them. To <HI>Die Daily,</HI> is the same that our Saviour speaks of, when He says; Luk. IX. 13. <HI>Let a man take up his Cross Daily.</HI> Our <HI>Afflictions</HI> belong to the <HI>Death,</HI> which is come upon us, by and for our Sin. We <HI>Die Daily,</HI> in those Afflicti∣ons, which are, as I may call them, The <HI>Van-Couriers</HI> of our <HI>Death</HI>; the <HI>Fore-run∣ners</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="001617_0023_0FB3E7450F27D648"/>
of our Death. A man who <HI>Dies Dai∣ly,</HI> is one who <HI>Daily</HI> Encounters with <HI>Af∣flictions</HI>; and may say with him, Ps. LXXIII 14. <HI>I am scourged all the Day long, &amp; chastened every morning.</HI> In <HI>Dying Daily,</HI> we are <HI>Daily</HI> to look for <HI>Troubles:</HI> and have so much pru∣dence, that when our Troubles come, we shall be able to say, <HI>These were not altogether unlook'd for! Every Day</HI> we should arm our selves, for <HI>Ʋnknown Troubles</HI>; as knowing that we daily Ly open to many and heavy Troubles: When the Light of the Day first salutes us, think; <HI>Who can tell the Troubles, which I may see, and into how much Darkness I may be brought, before this Day be done!</HI> We must get an Heart <HI>Established,</HI> Confirmed, Strengthened, against any Troubles, which we may be called unto an Encounter withal. So the Good man, Ps. CXII. 7, 8. <HI>He is not afraid of Evil Tidings; His Heart is established.</HI> And, when we Encounter with our <HI>Daily Troubles,</HI> it should be, how patiently, how quietly, with what a lovely <HI>Resignation!</HI> We <HI>Die Daily,</HI> in making <HI>Daily Sacrifices</HI>; in <HI>Daily</HI> submit∣ting to the <HI>Death</HI> of those Comforts which we are most fond of, and which are the
<PB N="22" REF="001617_0024_0FB3E746B85B98D8"/>
<HI>Desire of our Eyes.</HI> Then does a man <HI>die</HI> in∣deed, when his <HI>Will</HI> is <HI>Dead.</HI> We <HI>Die Daily,</HI> when we Entertain our <HI>Daily Trou∣bles,</HI> with a <HI>Will</HI> entirely swallow'd up into the <HI>Will of God.</HI> We <HI>Die Daily,</HI> when our <HI>Daily Troubles</HI> find us <HI>willing</HI> to Drink <HI>what∣ever Cup our Father shall give us to drink of.</HI> We <HI>Die Daily,</HI> when we bear our Troubles, with a sweet <HI>Submission</HI> to our Saviour; be∣lieving that His Intention is entirely to make us <HI>partakers of that Holiness</HI> which we have besought Him to Enrich us withal; and to make us more meet for our Hea∣venly Inheritance. After this manner we are to <HI>Receive</HI> our Troubles;
<Q>O my dear Saviour, I will <HI>submit</HI> with thy Help, un∣to whatever <HI>Cross</HI> thou shalt order for me.</Q></P>
<P>I know, thou wilt not appoint any <HI>Cross</HI>
<Q>for me, but what shall make me <HI>Wiser</HI> and <HI>Better,</HI> and bring me the more to Glorifie God. I will <HI>acquiesce</HI> in all thy Dispensa∣tions.</Q>
<HI>Return to thy Rest, O my Soul; for the Lord will deal favourably with thee!</HI> You see how much goes to <HI>Dying Daily</HI>: And yet one thing more.</P>
<P N="7">VII. To <HI>Die Daily,</HI> and to Good pur∣pose,
<PB N="23" REF="001617_0025_0FB3E74996CFB4D8"/>
is to <HI>Look Daily,</HI> upon what is to come <HI>After Death.</HI> When we <HI>Dy,</HI> we pass into <HI>Another World.</HI> The Testimonies and Recognitions of this, which our God mul∣tiplies unto us, methinks, they should have some Regard paid unto them. Yea, <HI>Out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings God has Ordained them.</HI> I am to morrow to attend the Funeral of a Child <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Little</HI> JERƲSHA MATHER.</NOTE> which was Two years and seven months old; A Child of uncommon Ripeness, and for which, I confess, I had too Engaged a Fondness;— having lain Speechless, under the Arrest of Death, for a Day or Two, her Speech returned a few moments before she died &amp; the very minute that she died, she said <HI>She would go to JESƲS CHRIST.</HI> And wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Older People now be insensible, that when they are <HI>Dying,</HI> they are Going to JESUS CHRIST, or where,—Oh! how can we do any other than Tremble to Think upon it If we <HI>Dy Daily,</HI> we <HI>Daily</HI> Converse with <HI>A¦nother World.</HI> It is a Thing that should have a <HI>Daily</HI> Impression upon us; That
<PB N="24" REF="001617_0026_0FB3E74B13C53BC8"/>
<HI>God</HI> has not done with us, when we have done with <HI>this World.</HI> We shall Exist, &amp; our longest Existence will be in <HI>another world.</HI> In <HI>Dying Daily,</HI> we shall do that thing; 2 Cor. IV. 18. <HI>Look not unto the things which are seen, and are Temporal, but unto the things which are not seen, and are E∣ternal.</HI> But let us a little <HI>Enquire</HI>; For the Glorious Redeemer, who is the <HI>True Witness, and the Deliverer of Souls,</HI> has En∣abled us to answer the Enquiry; <HI>What will there be after Death?</HI> We are informed; Heb. IX. 27. <HI>After Death, the Judgment.</HI> And now I will tell you, What it is to <HI>Die Daily?</HI> it is to have <HI>Daily,</HI> and Serious, and Solemn Thoughts on the <HI>Judgment</HI> which is to come <HI>After Death. Every Day</HI> to think suitably on the <HI>Day of Judg∣ment,</HI> is, to <HI>Die Daily.</HI> It should be a Dai∣ly Consideration with us; 'Am I Ready to appear before the <HI>Judgment-Seat of the Glorious Lord!</HI> What I am now adoing, will it be <HI>Approved,</HI> or will it be <HI>Condem∣ned</HI> from the <HI>Judgment-Seat</HI> of the Glori∣ous God? <HI>What shall I do, when God rises up, and when He visits, what shall I answer Him?</HI> We should be awakened <HI>Every
<PB N="25" REF="001617_0027_0FB3E74C98C6AE90"/>
Day</HI> to <HI>Fear God, and keep His Command∣ments,</HI> from this Consideration; <HI>God will bring every work into Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Well; but what follows upon the <HI>Judgment?</HI> We are informed; Matth. XXV. 46. Either <HI>Everlasting Punishment,</HI> or, <HI>Life Eternal.</HI> And now I will again tell you, What it is to <HI>Die Daily,</HI> It is <HI>Every Day</HI> to Look <HI>Downward</HI> into the <HI>Hell,</HI> which the <HI>Wicked, and all they that forget God</HI> shall be turned into: To be driven by that horrible Spectacle, unto the JESUS, who <HI>delivers from the Wrath to come</HI>; To Consider, Oh! <HI>Who can dwell in a Consuming Fire and in Ever∣lasting Burnings?</HI> And, <HI>What a Fearful thing it is, to fall into the Hands of the Living God!</HI> It is <HI>Every Day</HI> to Look <HI>Ʋpward,</HI> unto the <HI>Heaven,</HI> where JESUS <HI>Sits at the Right Hand of God:</HI> To be Quickened from the View of the <HI>Recom∣pence</HI> there set before us, in <HI>Runing the Race</HI> which is here set before us: To Consider, <HI>Oh! the Glory, and Honour, and Immortality of the Eternal Life,</HI> which by <HI>patient continuance in well-doing,</HI> I shall
<PB N="26" REF="001617_0028_0FB3E74DF213F240"/>
reach unto! To <HI>Live</HI> in such Contem∣plations, is, To <HI>Die Daily.</HI></P>
<P>And, my Brethren, let me assure you, Thus to <HI>Die Daily,</HI> will take a∣way the <HI>Bitterness of Death.</HI> We shall not <HI>Live</HI> the less while, for so <HI>Dying Daily.</HI> It will not <HI>Hasten</HI> our <HI>Death:</HI> But it will <HI>Sweeten</HI> it. Thus to <HI>Dy Daily,</HI> is the way to <HI>Live Wisely</HI>; To Live Piously, Watchfully, Fruitfully. Yea, Tis the Way to <HI>Live Eternally.</HI></P>
