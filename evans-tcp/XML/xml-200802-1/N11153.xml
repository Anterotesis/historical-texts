<BIBL>NEHEMIAH, vi. 8, 9.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NEHEMIAH, whose name this book bears, and who was now advanced to the government of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> was a very religious and most excellent man, and remarkably raised up by God, and peculiarly qualified for that eminent sta∣tion. The temper and conduct of a disinterested pa∣triot, a true lover of his country, and of a wise, vigi∣lant and upright ruler and magistrate, appears conspi∣cuous in his example, and through all parts of his public administration.</P>
<P>HE was sent to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> out of his captivity by <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> the King, (to whom he had been cup-bearer) in the twentieth year of his reign. The office of cup-bearer was a place of great honor and advantage in the Persian court, because of the privilege it gave him of being so much in the King's presence, and the oppor∣tunity he had thereby of gaining his favor, for the obtaining any petition which he should make to him, and the promoting his own interest. The <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> here mentioned is but another name for <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="014124_0003_0F930200370A31D8"/>
who married <HI>Esther</HI> a Jewish captive, and made her his queen, after repudiating <HI>Vashti.</HI> And probably it was by the favour of queen <HI>Esther,</HI> as being of the same na∣tion and people with her, that he obtained so honoura∣ble and advantageous a preferment in that court.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, neither the honor and advantage of the place, nor the long settlement of his family out of his country, could make him forget his love for it, or lay aside that zeal which he had for the religion of his forefathers who had formerly dwelt in it. For though he had been born and bred in a strange land; yet he had a great love for <HI>Zion,</HI> and was heartily engaged to exert himself for the prosperity of it, and was in all things a very religious observer of the law of God. And therefore, when some came from <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and told him of the ill state of that city, how the wall of it was broken down, and the gates of it in the same de∣molished state as when burnt with fire by the <HI>Babyloni∣ans;</HI> and that by reason hereof the remnant of the captivity that dwelt there lay open, not only to the incursions and insults of their enemies, but also to the reproach and contempt of their neighbours, as a weak and despicable people; and that they were in both these respects in great affliction and grief of heart; the good man being suitably moved with this representa∣tion, applied himself in fasting and prayer unto the Lord his God, and earnestly made supplication to him for Israel his people, and for the place which he had chosen for his worship among them. And having thus implored the divine mercy against this evil, he resolv∣ed next to make his application to the King for the redressing of it, trusting in God for the inclining of his heart thereto: and therefore when his turn came next to wait in his office, the King observing his countenance to be sad, which had not been so before in his presence, says to him, "<HI>Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart." "Then</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="014124_0004_0F930200DF6BF200"/>
(says Nehemiah) <HI>I was sore afraid, and said unto the King, Let the King live forever. Why should not my coun∣tenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers sepul∣chres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</HI>" He took this opportunity to lay before him the distressed state of his country; and owning this to be a cause of great grief and sadness to him, he prayed the King to send him thither to remedy it: and by the favour of Queen <HI>Esther</HI> (it seems) he had his petition granted him; for it being particularly remarked in the sacred text, that the Queen was sitting by the King when <HI>Nehemiah</HI> obtained the grant, it sufficiently inti∣mates that her favour was assisting to him herein. And accordingly a royal decree was issued out for rebuilding the walls and gates of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was sent thither with it, as governor of the province of <HI>Judea,</HI> to put it in execution. And for his greater honor and security, the King sent a guard of horse, under the command of some of the captains of his army, to escort him to his government. And he wrote letters to all the governors on this side the river <HI>Euphrates,</HI> to further him in the work on which he was sent; and also gave or∣der to <HI>Asaph</HI> the keeper of his forests in those parts, to al∣low him so much timber out of them, as should be need∣ed for the finishing of it. However, the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> the <HI>Moabites</HI> and the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> and other neighbouring nations round, did all they could to obstruct his design and defeat his enterprise. And to this they were ex∣cited, not only by the antient and bitter enmity which those people bore to the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> nation, because of the different manners and different religions they were of; but most especially at this time, because of their lands and property: for during the time that the <HI>Jews</HI> were in captivity, these nations having seized their lands and the interest they had left in the coun∣try, would be forced to restore and refund them, upon the re-establishment and prosperity of the <HI>Jews</HI> there.
<PB N="6" REF="014124_0005_0F930201B9F21370"/>
For which reason they did all they could to oppose their re-settlement: hoping that if they could be kept low, or quite depressed, they might retain the prey they were in danger of loosing, and regain any which they had already lost.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was not at all discouraged hereat, but put his trust in heaven, and made his prayer to the God of his Salvation. And having on his arrival at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> made known to the people the commission with which he was sent, he took a view of the ruins of the old walls, and immediately began to repair them. And the work was carried on with amazing rapidity and success, notwithstanding all manner of opposition was made against him both from within, and from with∣out. For from within several false prophets and other treacherous persons, under the influence of a wicked heart, set agoing by the force of bribery and corrupti∣on, endeavoured to create him obstructions; and, from without, <HI>Sanballat,</HI> the <HI>Horonite, Tobiah</HI> the <HI>Ammorite, Geshem</HI> the <HI>Arabian,</HI> and others, gave him all the dis∣turbance they were able, not only by underhand deal∣ings and treacherous tricks and contrivances, but also by open force; so that while part of the people labour∣ed in carrying on the building, the other part stood to their arms to defend them against the assaults of such as had designs against them. And all had their arms at hand even while they worked, to be ready at a sig∣nal given, to draw together at any part where the ene∣my should be discovered coming upon them. And by this means, through the divine blessing, they secur∣ed themselves against all the attempts and designs of their enemies, till the work was nearly brought to a conclusion, to their own great joy, and the extreme mortification of their adversaries. Then <HI>Sanballat, Tobiah</HI> and <HI>Geshem,</HI> sent to <HI>Nehemiah</HI> to come along with them into the field, (as it seems under a pretence) that there they might enter into an alliance together, and
<PB N="7" REF="014124_0006_0F930202C8931950"/>
swear inviolable friendship to each other: but <HI>Nehemiah</HI> perceived that this was only a stratagem to surprize him, and do him some violence. He therefore sent word that he was engaged in a great work which re∣quired his constant attendance, and which he could not intermit upon any account. They sent him the same invitation four times over, and he as often returned the same answer. At last <HI>Sanballat</HI> wrote to him in terms of the following purport, <Q>There is a report spread among the people, and <HI>Gashmu</HI> (which is the same with <HI>Geshem,</HI> only differently spelt) confidently af∣firms it, that you and the Jews intend a revolt—that your design in rebuilding the walls of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> is to declare yourself King of the <HI>Jews</HI>—that with this view have suborned prophets to suggest to the peo∣ple that you ought to be the King of the whole coun∣try. Now as all these things are to be represented to the King, it will be convenient for you to give us a meeting, that we may confer together about them.</Q> But instead of going to them himself, he sends this short and cutting answer to all his insidious insinuations and lying slanders, "<HI>There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart,</HI>" they are all of your own invention, and have nothing of truth in them. And while he repre∣sents their enemies as endeavouring to intimidate them, and plotting obstructions to the work, he piously be∣takes himself to God, in prayer, for persevering and increasing fortitude;—while their enemies endeavour to weaken their hands from the work, he dutifully looks to God to strengthen them. "<HI>For</HI> (says he) <HI>they all made us afraid,</HI> (i. e. did all they could to intimidate us) <HI>saying their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done. Now, therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</HI></P>
<P>THE words thus introduced and explained in their connection with the context, afford these two doctrinal observations, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<ITEM>I. THAT wicked and intriguing men sometimes make use of the fictions and falshoods of their own hearts to hinder the lawful and laudable enter∣prizes of a people, and obstruct their prosperity. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT it is the duty of a people who are thus falsly and wickedly dealt with by their enemies, for their intimidation and hurt, to look to God by prayer to strengthen their hands—to grant them the fortitude and wisdom they need to coun∣teract and baffle the insidious and malicious de∣signs of their enemies. We observe then,</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. THAT wicked and intriguing men sometimes make use of the fictions and falshoods of their own hearts to hinder the lawful and laudable enterprizes of a people, and obstruct their prosperity.</P>
<P>THE corrupt hearts of fallen mankind, when not restrained or sanctified by the grace of God, are capable of being influenced to any measures or means, however wicked and guilty, and how much soever they finally tend to the real infamy and wretchedness of themselves, or the hurt and injury of others. Pride is naturally a predominant sinful lust in them, and therefore pre∣eminence and superiority a very ruling passion: and to gratify their guilty pride and ambition, they stick at no measures, lawful or unlawful in themselves; but rush through, right or wrong, and make use of truth or falshood, just as their vain minds imagine will make most for their purposes. To these sinful lusts and pro∣pensities are owing all the wars and fightings that have ever been known among mankind, and all the blood unjustly shed from the death of righteous <HI>Abel,</HI> to the last sufferer, murdered by the hand of cruelty and vio∣lence. To oppress others and exalt themselves, to ac∣complish the designs of <HI>despotic</HI> sway, all their inventi∣on is put to the stretch, all their efforts used to frame and execute plans and schemes of deceit, plots of slavish
<PB N="9" REF="014124_0008_0F930203E0B89258"/>
subjection to their caprice; and all the arts of lying in∣trigue, and force of lawless power are called to their aid, and every scene of violence, rapine, and murder is acted over.</P>
<P>SANBALLAT the chief or governor of the <HI>Hittites</HI> or <HI>Samaritans</HI> was always a great enemy to the <HI>Jews.</HI> He was a native of <HI>Horon,</HI> or <HI>Horonius,</HI> a city beyond <HI>Jordon,</HI> in the country of the <HI>Moabites</HI> When <HI>Nehemiah</HI> first came and began to build the walls of Jerusalem, <HI>San∣ballat, Tobiah,</HI> and <HI>Geshem</HI> made themselves sport with him, and affected to treat the matter with ridicule and contempt, and sent to him and the <HI>Jews</HI> who were with him to know upon what authority he undertook this enterprize, and whether this was not a revolt or rebellion against the King. But <HI>Nehemiah</HI> answered "<HI>it is the God of Heaven that assists us, we are his servants, but ye have no portion, nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem.</HI>" And such was their envy and malice, that notwith∣standing all their pretended ridicule and scorn! The sacred history informs us "<HI>it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</HI>" But as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> proceeded with vigor in his undertaking, and as <HI>Sanballat</HI> heard (says the sacred historian) "<HI>that we builded the wall, he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews. And he spake before his brethren and the army of Smaria, and said, what do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned? Now Tobiah the Amonite was by him, and he said, even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</HI>" But this method of scorn∣ful treatment and reproach not answering the design in discouraging the <HI>Jews,</HI> and they proceeding with engagedness and perseverance in their undertaking, and having nearly compleated the work, "<HI>it came to pass that when Samballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians,
<PB N="10" REF="014124_0009_0F930204AC3C8620"/>
Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Je∣rusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth, and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hin∣der it.</HI>" But their attempts to injure and oppress the people, and put an end to their enterprize, by open violence and force, proving abortive, they then recur to the most wicked, deceitful, and malicious fictions and stratagems, to accomplish their designs.</P>
<P>IN the first place they endeavour to decoy <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> into their power, under feigned pretensions of real con∣cern and friendship for him; and for this end repeat their invitation to him four times, thinking to do him mischief; but he being apprized of their mischevious plot as often excused himself from meeting them, on account of the greatness and importance of the work he was engaged in.</P>
<P>THEN <HI>Sanballat</HI> sent his servant to him the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; the letter was sent open, doubtless on purpose to let any see or hear it, discretionarily, whom it might probably influence into their evil measures; or in order to unhinge and terrify the minds of the people, and, by tampering with them, weaken the hands of <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> The purport of the letter was that he and the people designed to rebel, and make <HI>him</HI> king; and that to pave the way for this, he had appointed prophets to preach of himself at <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> saying, there is a king in <HI>Judah;</HI> and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore let us take council toge∣ther! He intended, and no doubt expected that this letter, if it had no other effect, yet should bring on an interview between them, in which he might do him a mischief. The notice which <HI>Nehemiah</HI> took and the improvement he made of it we have in the text. "<HI>Then I sent unto him, saying, there are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart
<PB N="11" REF="014124_0010_0F9302055B87B2F0"/>
For they all made us afraid, saying, their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. New there∣fore, O God, strengthen my hands.</HI>" He was next attack∣ed by a certain false prophet named <HI>Shemaiah,</HI> whom <HI>Sanballat</HI> and <HI>Tobiah</HI> had gained over to their interest and hired for the purpose, and who would have intimi∣dated him, advising him to shut himself up in the tem∣ple, to prevent any attempt upon his life; but <HI>Nehe∣miah</HI> by his great prudence avoided falling into the snare; and in his treatment of this insidious false pro∣phet he discovers the most delicate sense of true honor, and gives the most signal proof of true courage and bravery. Hear his own account of the matter. "<HI>Af∣terward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mahetabell who was shut up; and he said let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. And I said should such a man as I flee? And who is there that be∣ing as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. And lo I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me; for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. My</HI> GOD <HI>think thou of Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very common, as in the account now read, for wicked and intriguing men, out of pure malice and fiction to charge those crimes and faults upon others, which they themselves only are guilty of. Thus these same men who had accused <HI>Nehemiah</HI> of suborning pro∣phets to preach him up for a king, without foundation, had themselves roundly bribed others to prophecy false∣ly against him and use all their influence to intimidate him and hinder the good work in which he was engag∣ed.
<PB N="12" REF="014124_0011_0F9302061A8ADC60"/>
But the work was of <HI>God,</HI> and was therefore soon completed notwithstanding all their malicious opposi∣tion. "<HI>And it came to pass</HI> (says the sacred historian) <HI>that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes! for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</HI>" And thus always shall the ene∣mies of God and his people sooner or later find all their wicked and hurtful schemes and efforts against them defeated to their own intire shame and debase∣ment.</P>
<P>ONE method of intriguing against and opposing the rebuilding <HI>Jerusalem</HI> under the administration of <HI>Nehe∣miah,</HI> and keeping the body of the <HI>Jews</HI> in a state of slavish subjection and oppression is yet to be mentioned according to the account we have of it in the end of the chapter containing the text; and that is, <HI>abusive and injurious letter-writing.</HI> The sacred historian men∣tions it in the following words: "<HI>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in law of Sheckaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had tak∣en the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berekiah. Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</HI>" This <HI>Tobiah</HI> was an <HI>Ammonite,</HI> and an inveterate enemy to the <HI>Jews;</HI> and was of great consideration in the law of the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> of which he was governor with <HI>Sanbal∣lat.</HI> He married the daughter of <HI>Shechaniah</HI> one of the principal <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and by his own and his son's marriage and family connections there, had a powerful party in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> itself, which were opposite to that of <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and to the true interest of the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation. But this prudent governor by his wis∣dom, moderation and perseverance, defeated all their machinations, though they carried on a most crafty
<PB N="13" REF="014124_0012_0F930206D8E65808"/>
and intriguing correspondence by letters, with their own party, in which the good deeds of <HI>Tobiah</HI> were ex∣tolled and reported to <HI>Nehemiah;</HI> and by the same par∣ty the words of <HI>Nehemiah</HI> were sent back to him, and all in order to gain him over to the interest of their party; and <HI>Tobiah</HI> himself wrote letters directly to him to put him in fear, and intimidate him into their mea∣sures; but to his immortal honor he was proof against all their practices of intrigue and corruption, and his name remains forever embalmed in the providence of <HI>God,</HI> as a most renowned patriot, and deliverer of his country.</P>
<P>A COPY of a letter wrote to the king by the crafty intriguing enemies of the <HI>Jews</HI> we have at large in the fourth chapter of <HI>Ezra</HI> beginning at the eleventh verse. <HI>This</HI> is <HI>the copy of the letter that they sent unto him,</HI> even <HI>un∣to Artaxerxes the king, Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time. Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us, are come unto Je∣rusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls</HI> there of, <HI>and joined the foundations. Be it known now unto the king, that if this city be builded, and the walls set up</HI> again, then <HI>will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and</HI> so <HI>thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. Now because we have maintenance from</HI> the kings <HI>palace, and it was not meet for us to see the kings dishonour: therefore have we sent and certified the king, That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, &amp; that they have moved sedition within the fame of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. We certifie the king, that if this city be builded</HI> again, <HI>and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.</HI> This letter contains the genuine spirit of self interested placemen and designing courtiers, and is full of servile adulation and flattery to the king, and pre∣tended
<PB N="14" REF="014124_0013_0F930207A349D040"/>
zeal for the honour, interest, and pre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> of the crown; and of vile insinuations, aspersions <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> accusations respecting the <HI>Jews,</HI> and some truth <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mingled with falsehood as they thought would best an∣swer the end.</P>
<P>AND it had such an effect, through the permission of divine providence, as to induce the king to send his express command that the purpose of the letter should be carried into execution: and the letter-writers them∣selves and their companions had orders to see this done, which doubtless they undertook with a malicious kind of pleasure: and the sacred text says, "<HI>they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. Then ceased the work of the house of</HI> GOD <HI>which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of Darius king of Persia.</HI>" They were permitted to put a stop to the <HI>Jews</HI> for a season; but it was only for a season: for the work was of God, and after a short time it was revived, and under the administra∣tion of <HI>Nehemiah</HI> completed. The work the <HI>Jews</HI> were engaged in was a lawful and laudable work, for the religious and civil interest of their nation and country; and those who opposed them were guilty of great wick∣edness; and though God's professing people of Israel highly deserved, on account of their own sins, much more than they met with, as coming from the hand of a righteous God, yet they deserved not such treatment from their fellowmen. Neither are the ill deserts of the <HI>Jews</HI> at the hand of God, any justification of their enemies in their evil designs against them, nor do they make them e'er the less guilty in the sight of heaven.</P>
<P>THE infinitely wise and good God, makes use of wicked men as he pleases, to answer his divine pur∣poses, and often taketh the wise ones of this world in their own craftiness; and over rules all their designs and conduct for his own glory, and the good of his people <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="15" REF="014124_0014_0F930208636A2980"/>
upon all the impenitents, for all the designs and efforts of their malice and wickedness, whether carried on in a more <HI>secret, confidential,</HI> and underhand intriguing man∣ner, or managed by more open force and violence.</P>
<P>AND thus there have been and still are wicked and intriguing men in the world, that make use of the fictions and falshoods of their own hearts to hinder the lawful and laudable enterprises of a people, and ob∣struct their prosperity.</P>
<P>And we go on to observe,</P>
<P>II. THAT it is the duty of a people who are thus falsely and wickedly dealt with by their enemies, for their intimidation and hurt, to look to God by prayers to strengthen their hands, to grant them the fortitude and wisdom they need to counteract and baffle the in∣sidious and malicious designs of their enemies.</P>
<P>To this duty good <HI>Nehemiah</HI> the people under his government, when thus attacked by their perfidi∣ous enemies: "<HI>Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</HI>" Every good and perfect gift cometh from God; strength of body and soundness of mind, the pos∣session of one's own soul, courage, bravery, and forti∣tude, all manly and useful efforts and enterprises, all exertions and all success intirely depend upon, and are derived from him in whom we live and move and have our being. His favour is life, and his loving kindness is better than life; and blessed and happy is that peo∣ple whose God is the Lord." And it is the peculiar privilege of the visible covenant and professing people of God, when their enemies rise up against them and plot and seek their hurt, in any way whatever, that they have such direction and encouragement, humbly to look to God by prayer for all the help and salvation they need, for deliverance from, or victory over their enemies. And he who is infinite in wisdom, and hath <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="16" REF="014124_0015_0F9302095F7F9170"/>
designs of their enemies against them, when they duti∣fully acknowledge their dependance upon him, and by repentance and prayer seek his face and favour. Their enemies are often very crafty and powerful, their in∣trigues secret, their plots deep laid and full of serpen∣tine subtlety, and such (as far as creatures are concern∣ed) as promise and insure success: but Almighty God with infinite ease can turn all their counsels into fool∣ishness, cause all their devices to issue in their own con∣fusion, and the evil they meant against others to recoil upon their own heads. They may use all the arts of intimidation, but all shall be in vain, if God encou∣rages the hearts and strengthens the hands of his peo∣ple; and it is equally the duty and security of his peo∣ple to look to him and depend upon him to encourage their hearts and strengthen their hands. At his sove∣reign pleasure, "five shall chace an hundred, and an hundred put ten thousand to flight." The hearts of all men are in his hand, and he inspires them with for∣titude and courage; or fills them with terror or dis∣may; and succeeds or blasts their designs as he pleases; and he can "save with few as well as with many." And a people who seek to him, and put their trust and confidence in him, are always safe and secure under his Almighty protection, and shall have their hearts encouraged and their hands strengthened, and their e∣nemies shall be made to flee or fall before them. And these are the directions of the word of God, <HI>Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most High; and call upon me in the day of trouble. I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." "Wait on the Lord: be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say on the Lord.</HI>" And such were the many remarkable interpositions of divine providence in favour of his an∣cient people, and such their safety under the Almighty protection, that <HI>Moses</HI> but a little before his death thus <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<HI>who rideth upon the heavens in thy help, and in his excellen∣cy on the sky. The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. Happy art thou, O Israel! Who is like unto thee, O people, saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency!</HI> And the psalmist in his day piously observes in behalf of his people, <HI>If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say, if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: then the waters had over whelmed us, the stream had gone ever our soul: then the proud waters had gone over our soul. Bles∣sed be the Lord who hath not given us a prey to their teeth. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>WE proceed now to apply and improve our subject. The sacred passage which is the theme of our present discourse, and the history connected with it, contains something very applicable to our state as a people, and affords matter for our very serious and profitable im∣provement.</P>
<P>THAT designs to enslave and oppress us, and bring us into absolute subjection to arbitrary power, with our lives and properties entirely at the will and mercy of despotism, have been formed, and the most unjustifi∣able methods, of secret intrigue and open violence, ta∣ken to carry them into execution, is at length a truth <HI>so notorious,</HI> that nothing but weakness and stupidity can help observing, and nothing but downright villainy and wickedness can help acknowledging.</P>
<P>WE see, for a course of years, a long series of plans and schemes of subtle statesmen, and parliamentary debates, and acts, and resolutions, under ministerial in∣stance, all evidently calculated to subjugate this
<PB N="18" REF="014124_0017_0F93020D0AFA70A8"/>
country. And if there hath been a change of minis∣ters yet there hath been no essential change of measures; the conduct of administration hath continually tended to this point. And it is a task not easily performed, even to mention all the wicked arts and measures that have been employed to accomplish it. The <HI>British</HI> constitution, heretofore, so much the glory and happi∣ness of our own nation, and the envy and terror of fo∣reigners, has from time to time been undermined, till at length, under the hands of bribery and corruption, it seems <HI>rotten</HI> to the very core. Royal chatters, and the most valuable and essential rights of Englishmen, have been unjustly and cruelly wrested away, or most wantonly violated or sported with.</P>
<P>WHAT have not crafty, ambitious and designing men done to ensnare us, decertfully to cajole and intrigue us; or sencibly to intimidate us into measures, to an∣swer their own aspiring purposes, by meanly subjecting ourselves and posterity to their service, and consenting to hold our lives and properties at their arbitrary plea∣sure? to this end what letters have not been written on both sides of the water, <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>confidential,</HI> or what∣ever <HI>peculiar</HI> title they best deserve, full of the vilest as∣persions, and designed to effect measures destructive of the liberties and privileges of the people; and written avowedly, some of them, at least upon principles of <HI>Machiavillian</HI> or diabolical policy, principles that have no regard to justice or integrity, or the best good of the people, but avowedly calculated to support the designs of the governing party, by any means whatever? What pains have been taken to hinder truth from coming to light, or to prevent loyal and dutiful petitions for re∣dress of grievances from reaching the throne, or to shut the King's ear and harden his heart against them? Is it not known, is it not acknowledged, (nay so barefa∣ced and impudent is the iniquity, that themselves take no pains to conceal it) that a venal corrupt majority in
<PB N="19" REF="014124_0018_0F93020E224CD688"/>
the <HI>British</HI> parliament, voting altogether at the nod of the minister, govern all the public acts and conduct of that body, once so upright, respectable and august, and heretofore as remarkable for defending the liberties of the nation, and humbling <HI>tyrants,</HI> and opposing <HI>popery,</HI> as it is now for being complaisant and yieldable to all the contrary purposes. And is not this corrupt and venal body, sometimes with equal pomp and impiety held up to our view by themselves and others, as <HI>omni∣potent?</HI> Do they not affect too much to act as being such, not fearing God above, nor regarding man be∣low, as the duties of their station require? And is not every rational and just and necessary method of point∣ing out their errors, and opposing their hurtful and <HI>tyrannical</HI> measures, discouraged and frowned upon? Is not that opposition to the most enormous and un∣warrantable strides of arbitrary power, which after ve∣ry remarkable long suffering and patience, was at length arous'd to vigorous exertions by absolute ne∣cessity, and which is warranted and called forth by the clearest sense of duty, and all the tenderest ties and ob∣ligations of life and godliness;—Is not this manly and laudable opposition stiled rebellion? Are not pa∣triots of distinction, friends of their country and pa∣trons of liberty, proscribed for slaughter, and whole fleets and armies, the <HI>ultima ratio,</HI> instead of sound reason, and the principles of the <HI>British</HI> constitution, and of right and religion, made use of to convert us as a people, to a state of the most abject slavery to the crown, court-parasites, minions and placemen of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> And how language is tortured, reason abused, and our holy religion impiously forced into the service of our, and the nations enemies, appears in many things, particularly in a late proclamation set forth by <HI>him</HI> who has the infamy of being the chief <HI>ministerial tool</HI> of ven∣geance in this distressed country. To please adminis∣tration, and be what those who are seeking our hurt
<PB N="20" REF="014124_0019_0F9302100C6F74D8"/>
affect to stile <HI>friends of government,</HI> neither our reason, or religion, our voices or hands must ever be used, but in perfect conformity to the pernicious popish doctrines of implicit faith, passive obedience and non-resistance. Any thing may be said, or written, or done, in their favour, and praises; and pensions, and promotions, be the reward of their <HI>sycophants</HI> and <HI>tools;</HI> while any thing to the contrary, however supported by reason and the christian religion, is misrepresented, falsified and pu∣nished by every means in their power. And while the <HI>Dignitaries</HI> of the <HI>English Church</HI> in their places as members of parliament, are known, with one or two exceptions only, to be under the influence of a corrupt administration, and particularly to have passed the <HI>Quebec Bill,</HI> and been in all the secret acts against the colonies; and while those who conform to them on this, or the other side of the water, and affect, contrary to the simplicity of the gospel of Christ, to stile them their superiors, exert themselves to support every tyrannical and arbitrary measure, they are caressed as <HI>friends of go∣vernment;</HI> while clergymen of different principles &amp; con∣duct, of whatever church or particular christian profession they be, who converse upon and preach up as occasion requires, the duties, the privileges, and liberty of the gospel, and the friendly aspect it has upon the civil rights and happiness of mankind, and dare not attempt to press the religion taught by the PRINCE OF PEACE AND MOST BENEVOLENT SAVIOUR OF MEN, into the service of <HI>tyranny</HI> and <HI>oppression,</HI> and who shew to the people the privileges and rights which they enjoy by divine revelation; and how they ought to improve them, so as to answer their duty and find their happi∣ness, are called <HI>fanatical courting preachers, incendiaries, independents, enemies to government and order,</HI> and what not, and are marked out as objects deserving the severest chastisement. This temper and conduct is not new. It is as old as the time of <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> It was very appa∣rent
<PB N="21" REF="014124_0020_0F930210AAE9A050"/>
and operative then, and those that pretended to be <HI>friends of government,</HI> and to support the prerogatives of the crown, were guilty of the vilest aspersions towards the patriots of their country and friends of the people, and hired and bribed some priests and prophets to preach and prophecy in support of their measures, and against the true interest of the people, and were them∣selves grosly guilty of the like crimes which they wil∣fully and wickedly charged against <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and of which he was altogether innocent. He exhorted and encouraged and commanded his priests to do their du∣ty faithfully according to the law of God, and thus doing is offence enough against tyrannical and wicked men. Shall a whole bench of <HI>protestant bishops,</HI> by pro∣fession and oath, peculiarly bound to support and de∣fend the <HI>protestant</HI> religion, and guard against the en∣croachments of popery, usher into the world a <HI>bantling</HI> under their patronage and authority, which so strongly bears the features of the <HI>scarlet whore and mother of har∣lots?</HI> And are we not pardonable, nay are we not in duty bound, to hold up the <HI>mis shapen brat</HI> to view, and warn the people against such advances towards <HI>popery,</HI> that superstitious and bloody religion and yoke of sla∣very which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear; and against which their <HI>own order and predecessors,</HI> being some of them the brightest ornaments and lumi∣naries of the christian church, have heretofore born a noble testimony, and made a most memorable stand, and resisted even unto death, not counting their own lives dear, if they might but be found faithful unto death, and finish their course with joy!</P>
<P>WE envy them not their worldly dignities and emo∣luments. We claim nothing at their hands but the free and peaceable enjoyment of the rights and privi∣leges which the providence of God hath mercifully fa∣voured us with, and which have been guaranteed and secured to us, and left us unmolested by former <HI>British</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="014124_0021_0F93021178D45318"/>
kings and parliaments; and which, in this country, were first purchased, and have since been maintained, at the hazard and expence of the best blood and trea∣sure of our <HI>ancestors</HI> the first settlers, and their <HI>posterity</HI> after them.</P>
<P>IT is now a day of peculiar trial, and every good man and lover of his country, under the present as∣pects of divine providence, and the political and mar∣tial movements that have taken place, must feel a very sensible degree of affecting apprehension and concern, and the man ought to be pitied for his <HI>weakness,</HI> or shunned for his <HI>wickedness,</HI> at the present day, "<HI>whose bosom beats not in his country's cause.</HI>"</P>
<P>WE have no other new world on earth to explore, or flee to, for an <HI>asylum,</HI> from the hand of tyranny and op∣pression. Here we must stand or fall. Matters have grown to the most alarming crisis. We have no other <HI>alternative</HI> left us, but to submit without conditions, to all the demands of unjustly usurped and exorbitant power; or passively be knocked on the head and sacri∣ficed in death; or make a noble, united and vigorous and virtuous opposition. That the <HI>last</HI> is so universal∣ly the resolution of the country, is matter of joy and thankfulness and an omen for good. How willingly do men offer themselves in the service, and what bra∣very and engagedness have our countrymen shewn in the good cause? And though the desolations of a civil war have commenced, and the blood of the slain, once and again, ran in our streets; and fire and sword been permitted to make their ravages and devastations; yet is not the providence of God most thankfully to be ac∣knowledged, that so little destruction hath been made amongst the proper inhabitants of the land, and noble defenders of the country, in comparison to what our enemies have suffered?</P>
<P>A HUMAN and christian mind will be inclined to drop a tear over our slaughtered enemies, especially the
<PB N="23" REF="014124_0022_0F93021219E67E40"/>
poor soldiery, forced on by superior command to the infamous and bloody work, in which success would be equally disgraceful to them as a defeat. For officers, considered as men of sense and reading, acquainted with the <HI>British</HI> history, and constitution, though they are deservedly the objects of pity, yet their conduct ad∣mits of no shadow of excuse. While our brave coun∣trymen in all their dutiful exertions and lawful enter∣prizes for the salvation of their country, while they live, will live honored, and when they die, die la∣mented, their graves watered with their country's tears! and their names be had in everlasting remem∣brance; <HI>but the memory of the wicked shall rot.</HI> O! that as a people from the highest to the lowest amongst us, we might have the humble heart, joined with the spi∣rit of prayer, confidence and fortitude, which <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and we trust others, in his day had; and that we might unite through this wide extended <HI>continent</HI> in this cri∣tical and alarming day, when every art is used to inti∣midate, oppress and break us to servile purposes; and under a due sense of our dependence upon God, and the need we have of <HI>his</HI> favour and blessing, have our hearts and language thoroughly conformed to the prayer in the text, <HI>Now, therefore, O God, strengthen our hands.</HI> And we shall do well to attend to the di∣rection he gave the people then, as very applicable to ourselves now, <HI>Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.</HI></P>
<P>GOD in his merciful providence is waiting to be gracious to us. HE hath already many a time, <HI>done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</HI> He is infinite∣ly ready, and able to save us out of all our troubles, and nothing prevents needed salvation but our sins and iniquities;—these alone seperate between us and our God and hide his face from us. It becomes us deeply to humble ourselves under <HI>his</HI> mighty hand,
<PB N="24" REF="014124_0023_0F930212E14C3738"/>
and ascribe righteousness to our Maker. He is infinitely just and holy, and there is a wonderful mixture of goodness and mercy in all his judgments which are up∣on us. He punishes us far less than we deserve, and many tokens for good are very observable in his provi∣dential dealings and dispensations towards us. Oh! that we might be enabled suitably to regard the opera∣tion of his hand, and repent and reform, and learn the things of our peace before they are hid from our eyes. And while we endeavour to take the best human measures to oppose the unjustifiable and cruel designs of our enemies against us, let us be careful to maintain a constant caution against a spirit of self-sufficiency and self-confidence, and be guarded against trusting to an arm of flesh: and let us be exhorted to have our prayer continually unto the God of our life, and the Author of all our salvation. Let us forsake every wicked and false way, and fear and serve HIM: and if we are pos∣sessed of, and governed by the true fear of the omnipo∣tent Jehovah, we shall have no reason to fear what a pretended <HI>omnipotent parliament,</HI> or any man or body of men can do against us. HE whose throne is in the heavens, and whose kingdom ruleth over all, hath in∣finite wisdom and power to extricate us out of all our difficulties, and if we wait upon him in a way of duty in due time we shall see his salvation. May the cries of his people throughout this whole <HI>continent,</HI> be sincere, fervent and persevering—may we all deeply lament our national degeneracy and corruption, and our land-defiling abominations and sinful departures from the God of our fathers—may we sincerely repent of our personal sins, and <HI>obtain the like precious faith of God's elect</HI>—may God Almighty change the hearts and mea∣sures of men which are inimical to the true interest of his people—Heaven interpose and save the nation from impending ruin!—and may we in this land be ever <HI>the saved of the Lord;</HI> and may he enable us to please

him in ways of holy obedience, and make all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>enemies to be at peace with us!</HI> And may we all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> day of distress, unite and say from the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pious psalmist, <HI>Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name, and deliver us and purge away our sins for thy name's sake.</HI> Let us with deep repentance join∣ed with humble hope and confidence <HI>prostrate</HI> ourselves at the feet of sovereign mercy, and almighty power and goodness; and then we need never fear being brought, by the hand of violence and arbitrary power, to lye <HI>prostrate</HI> at the feet of any <HI>British</HI> minister or <HI>British</HI> par∣liament. Let us in ways of well-doing <HI>commit our cause to him that judgeth righteously, and the Lord do what seem∣eth him good.</HI> And while as a people we are using all the wisdom and power God hath given us, for our de∣liverance and protection, and under every omen for good, and all instances of success, and kind interpositi∣ons of providence in our favour, let the divine hand be dutifully acknowledged, and the glory of all be thank∣fully ascribed to the God of all our salvation. And let me repeat the caution to guard against a self-suffi∣cient and self-confident spirit; and against trusting to our own goodness, strength or power. And Oh! that we might be enabled, like God's antient people, under the conduct of good <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> to keep this <HI>Fast,</HI> and like them obtain favour of God. Let us attend to, and improve their humble and devout language in the day of their distress and fasting, which appears very applicable to our state at the present day, and which is recorded in the ninth chapter of this book, and with some part of which I now conclude. <HI>Stand up and bless the Lord your God forever and ever; and blessed be thy glori∣ous name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. Thou, even thou art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their hast, the earth and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all, and the host of heaven worshippeth

thee. Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, who keepest covenant and mercy, for thou art a gracious and merciful God, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us.
