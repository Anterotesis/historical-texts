<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of this publication is to disseminate the TRUTH of the EVERLASTING GOSPEL, in its rich variety of doctrine, pre∣cept, experience and history, both by prose and verse, in a manner calculated to gratify the more sublime taste, and to instruct the plainest capacity. In a day of dissipation, infidelity and error, like the present, when, by precept and example, our youth, of every description, are industriously prejudiced against the vo∣lume of REVELATION; and while many pro∣fessors of religion start aside into <HI>new paths,</HI> too many efforts, in every agreeable form, cannot be made to defend the truths of PRI∣MITIVE CHRISTIANITY, and to lead the seri∣ous enquirer to taste its sacred streams which
<PB N="iv" REF="031228_0004_0FEB733345BF5BF8"/>
lead him to God, refine his soul, regulate his life, support him under sufferings, and ani∣mate his hope in prospect of a blissful immor∣tality!</P>
<P>How far the efforts of the EDITOR of the <HI>Christian's Pocket Library</HI> may have answered these purposes, he leaves with God, and the public. It is, however, with greatful plea∣sure he reviews the long list of respectable SUBSCRIBERS to this WORK, and from thence presumes his labours have not been unac∣ceptable, nor in vain. Thus prompted, he ventures, under the smiles of IMMANUEL, and the farther encouragement of his pious READ∣ERS, upon the publication of another volume.</P>

<HEAD>Explanation of the <HI>VIGNETTE</HI> upon the Title Page.</HEAD>
<P>IN the centre is a figure of JESUS CHRIST, our ADORABLE SAVIOUR, accompanied by MERCY and JUSTICE.</P>
<P>JUSTICE, in her left hand, poises a pair of scales: one of which contains the two tables of the MORAL LAW;—the other a BUBBLE, emblematical of man in his fallen state. The latter, being weighed in the balance, is <HI>found wanting.</HI> JUSTICE re∣ceives from CHRIST a Cross, representing his own SACRIFICE. This she accepts, and by her inverted SWORD, pronounces satisfactory.</P>
<P>MERCY, on the right hand of our SAVIOUR, re∣ceives from him an <HI>Olive-branch,</HI> the well known emblem of PEACE, and a sure pledge of his love to sinners, to be published among all nations.</P>

Maker put in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssession of the infinite variety of terrestrial good; whence this foul mistake, and man enveloped in scenes of complicated woe? SIN contaminated the heart;—by sin the delightful vi∣sion of God in Nature was lost;—man became alienated from the life of God, and exposed to all the miseries incurred by reiterated transgression. Reduced to such a mass of depravity and guilt, no wonder that man mistake the true nature, object, and means of happiness! As by the carnal prin∣ciple of the heart objects are selected and embrac∣ed, which promise that sort of felicity which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongenial with its own nature, it is to be expected that such in the pursuit will meet with disappoint∣ment, shame and grief. Not to enumerate the variety of means which men pursue after happiness, it is sufficient to say, it constitutes the grand busi∣ness of all orders and ranks of men; and this is the very spring which keeps the whole <HI>world</HI> in motion.</P>
<P>As these reflections on human nature are too true to admit of controversy, it may not be im∣proper to ask, "What, in man's present state, can restore to him that happiness which the capa∣cious powers of his soul are capable of enjoying?" As a <HI>sinner,</HI> he must have a full pardon from his JUDGE; as a depraved subject, his mind must be
<PB N="3" REF="031228_0008_0FEB733E693CAFB8"/>
illuminated, and his passions refined; as a traveller through the thorny path of life, he needs some thing adequate to support him, and bring his mind into acquiescence with his lot; as a creature im∣mortal, and hastening to a future state, he must have assurance that after death he shall be transmit∣ted to the bosom of JEHOVAH, where alone, sin∣less, undisturbed happiness reigns. Where then can these blessings be obtained? Go, search the volumes of Nature,—alas! not a line in her ex∣tensive page can assure a sinner there are pardons with his JUDGE. Go, pass through all the scenes of dissipation, honor, wealth, with all the world calls good and great, and see if a balm can be procured adequate to heal the guilty conscience, or meliorate the heart. Here Nature herself becomes dumb, and the seats of royalty are found the very regions of anxiety, disappointment and pain. Turn then to the volume of REVELATION; there learn that to restore human happiness God freely gave his BELOVED SON to sustain that weight of <HI>misery</HI> we incurred by our sin; that <HI>he who knew no sin, was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</HI> 2 Cor. v.21. <HI>Though he was rich, for our sake he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.</HI> 2 Cor. viii.9. By the merit of his holy life, vi∣carious
<PB N="4" REF="031228_0009_0FEB734193BA2FA8"/>
death, and triumphant resurrection, de∣rived from his union with the DEITY, he did not make our happiness possible, but <HI>actually</HI> obtain∣ed it. Heb. ix.11, 12. In Jesus is deposited all that grace which our depraved nature can demand, to restore its felicity. Through HIM the sublime pleasures of communion with God, as a COVE∣NANT EVERLASTING FATHER, is enjoyed, a sense of whose adopting love diffuses in our breast the most inexpressible delight! From Jesus, by his SPIRIT's aid, we may daily receive light, peace, joy, love, strength, with every other virtue to adorn our minds, support us under suffering, and ani∣mate us in obedience. All the vicissitudes of Pro∣vidence, whether prosperous or adverse, we learn, are in the hand of HIM who bought us with his blood; and these, however contrary to human ap∣prehension, <HI>shall work together for the good of those who love him.</HI> And the same adored IMMA∣NUEL, by his conquest over <HI>death, hath brought life and immortality to light,</HI> and unfolds to us the brightest scenes of unutterable bliss! 2 Tim. i.10. Here then is happiness restored! Here the immor∣tal mind may find its centre, and be forever blessed. <HI>Happy is that people that is in such a case: hap∣py is that people whose God is the Lord.</HI> Psa. cxlv.15.

<HEAD>MEMORIAL Of the Lord's Visitation to the <HI>CITY OF NEW-YORK,</HI> by a malignant <HI>Fever,</HI> which swept away, by death, seven hundred and forty-six Inhabitants, from the <HI>26</HI>th of July till the <HI>5</HI>th of November, <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE judgment we deplore is one of the swiftest and most tremendous calamities that can fall upon a people: It evidently is "<HI>The Lord's voice to the city,</HI>" and demands our solemn attention. Surely there was a cause—"<HI>God doth not willingly afflict the children of men.</HI>" This city was growing in opulence, and indulged with every privilege, civil and religious, which could constitute our happiness. Let us then ask if our gratitude has been propor∣tionate to our obligation? It is with extreme re∣gret we review the too many instances of pride, luxury, discontent, avarice, and dissipation, which have increased with our years. Who but must drop a tear on recollecting the astonishing growth of infidelity, and the many attempts to traduce the person and gospel of the Son of God, by whom alone we can be saved! and it is with still greater sensibility we behold the extreme indifference paid
<PB N="7" REF="031228_0012_0FEB734D00520FD0"/>
by professors to the life, power and prosperity of the pure primitive truth and worship of christianity! Thus, <HI>Because iniquity abounds the love of many waxeth cold.</HI> Matt. xxiv.13. That this hath long been the unhappy state of our city, many, many of the more serious of different religious denomi∣nations have acknowledged with grief. God could not behold us without some tokens of his displeasure. On the 20th of September, 1793, our inhabitants fled to the sanctuary to implore the Divine protec∣tion from a severe judgment which then pervaded a neighbouring city, and threatened our borders;— then did every heart tremble, and every eye flow with tears: <HI>but the Lord was intreated for the land, the plague was stayed,</HI> and we were pre∣served. 2 Sam. xxiv.25. That the sight of this chastising rod did not produce its desired effect, is evident by our Lord's laying upon us his severer hand. He commissioned not a foe against us which could have been driven from our borders by force of arms, but
<Q><L>"—A victor, whose unbounded force</L>
<L>"O'er bulwarks breaks with unresisted course;</L>
<L>"A thousand ways the swift <HI>contagion</HI> takes,</L>
<L>"Flows with the stream, or stagnates with the lakes.</L>
<L>"The winds, infected with the deadly breath,</L>
<L>"Bear on their sooty wings the scent of death."</L></Q>
<PB N="8" REF="031228_0013_0FEB734E8C1765E0"/>
Many, with swift precipitation, fled from their ha∣bitations, while the horrors of death sat on the brow of those who were left behind. Slow, yet steady to his purpose, the foe advanced; and, oh! who is competent to describe his awful spoils? Blooming youths, once the joy of their parents, and the hope of their country, cut down and lodged in the re∣cesses of corruption! How many persons of the most brilliant parts were arrested by the polluting hand of Pestilence, and the public forever deprived of their useful virtues! The parent, how shall I speak it! the tender parent, not only called to mourn over his departed babe, but compelled, by the law of self-preservation, to fly from the putrid corpse of <HI>her</HI> who once lay in his bosom with delight!— Dictated by humanity in relieving others by every kind office in their power, how many
<Q><L>"—Caught their friend's departing breath,</L>
<L>"Join'd in the dark society of Death?</L>
<L>"They took one melancholy last embrace,</L>
<L>"Then slept together in the arms of Peace."</L></Q></P>
<P>O Lord, surely thou art known by the judg∣ments which thou executeth. May it never be said of us, "This people turneth not to him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts." Isa. ix.13. Although our affliction has been great,
<PB N="9" REF="031228_0014_0FEB7354DF54B4C8"/>
and never to be forgotten, yet, neither so great as we justly merited, nor as Philadelphia experienc∣ed. Let us remember if this visitation leaves us without salutary effects, God hath still more ar∣rows in his quiver, more keenly pointed, and more swift in flight. In the year 79 three cities were destroyed by an earthquake in <HI>Cyprus.</HI> In 1456, by the same messenger of justice, 40,000 people were lost in <HI>Naples.</HI> And, in 1665, there died of the plague, in <HI>London,</HI> 68,600 inhabitants. Isaiah, when <HI>Jerusalem</HI> were insensible of the judgments of God upon them, declared, <HI>Thou shalt be visit∣ed of the Lord of Hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise; with storm and tem∣pest, and the flame of devouring fire.</HI> Isa. xxix.6. Who will not fear before this great and terrible JEHOVAH! Let us, therefore, incessantly pray, that this severe judgment may be succeeded by co∣pious showers of the richest grace! that magistrates may rule in the fear of the Almighty; ministers preach with additional zeal; our congregations walk more sensibly in the light of the Lord, and multi∣tudes be converted unto our God! Amen.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Written by a Minister for the Improvement of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on his Voyage to the East-Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Captain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to open the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Sea.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOW, my dear Sir, you may be far from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediate embraces of your friends, but the arm, of your omnipotent Immanuel surround you. The liquid <HI>horizon</HI> attracts your eye, and gives you the most striking emblem of the IMMENS<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> SUP<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>EM<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>! When you trod his hollowed courts, his glory shone upon your soul; and here the watery worlds pro∣claim the gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eur of your Lord. Safe in his hand, and happy in his breast, may you remain, and plow the briny deep. Soon may you return, and speak the praise of HIM who, through calms, and tempests, brings his people to their desired haven. Psa. cvii.23—31.</P>
<P>You're sad, my friend; come take a chair and let's converse. Who so happy as the man that, while sailing o'er Life's tempestuous ocean, hath God to be his guide? Retirement is an aid to true de∣votion; it drops a kind of curtain, and in a measure hides the busy scenes of time, while we converse with God. Certainly you have an advantage on the <HI>seas,</HI> unfelt, if not unknown, to us on land;
<PB N="11" REF="031228_0016_0FEB73583A38D0D0"/>
you are immediately, and more sensibly dependent on him whom winds and seas obey. Ever uncer∣tain, you cast your <HI>anchor</HI> in your Father's breast. The winds, you learn, are a part of his treasure, and in awful majesty he rideth upon their wings: Raging storms and bellowing tempests are but the voice of God. Now he speaks with terrible ma∣jesty, and casts the foaming deep to mountains hight—anon, his milder voice is heard; the gentle <HI>gale</HI> springs up and fills the <HI>pendant sheets,</HI> and peace sits smiling on the humble <HI>wave.</HI> This, how charming! how welcome to the mind, which, from the storm without, felt greater storms within! But this God is your's, your Father and your Friend. Though <HI>storm</HI> and <HI>tempest</HI> rage, and all the sea be <HI>foam,</HI> may you be perfect <HI>calm,</HI> and leave yourself, your friends, your all with him.</P>
<P>Captain, let's take a walk on <HI>deck,</HI> 'tis near sun-rise. How s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ene the morning! the filthy fog hath retired to give us leave to see the sun;—see, his beams appear and gladden every wave. He seems to tinge the sea with golden hue, and pour his rays through all the sky—What earthly mo∣narch ever rose so bright? Yet sol is but a faint resemblance of Israel's King; that King whose wide domain shall reach to yonder eastern clime. Soon may he send his heralds there to sound his pre∣cious
<PB N="12" REF="031228_0017_0FEB735B6528E4C8"/>
name; soon may he hear that east unites with north and south and west, and all the globe pro∣claim the Saviour's love! Who can tell, Captain; you see the sun arise and strike his rays around; perhaps the Saviour too may now arise with heal∣ing in his beams, and save the heathen race! Go, go speed your way, and bring the happy news.</P>
<P>Heave the <HI>log</HI>—let's see the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook</HI> —adjust the <HI>points,</HI> and know our course. So far advanced, yet, ah! how much <HI>lee-way.</HI> So is our life. How swift we move, but seldom keep ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> course. Amazing! so much lee-way and waste time is gone. I look back but see the <HI>wake</HI> is closed; my minutes, days and years are mingled with the <HI>flood.</HI> O thou Heavenly Pilot! <HI>so teach me to number my fleet∣ing days, that I may apply my heart unto wisdom.</HI> Psa. xc.12.</P>
<P>Boy, bring coffee! Still our floating habitation affords us pleasing food. Heaven bless the poor on land, and kindly feed the souls that famish on the seas! Take away, boy;—hand the <HI>chart, compass</HI> and <HI>scale</HI>;—thanks to the Artist for his skill in pointing out the pathless sea. Let us now survey our <HI>course,</HI> prove our <HI>log,</HI> and see what <HI>rocks</HI> and <HI>shoals</HI> are nigh. So let us take the precious Book of God, that CHART DIVINE; my FAITH a <HI>compass,</HI> and my HEART a <HI>scale</HI>; with these let
<PB N="13" REF="031228_0018_0FEB7361B95546D0"/>
me find the way that leads to perfect bliss. How many heedless mortals, like the <HI>lazy seaman,</HI> never view their tract till, running on the rocks or shoals of vice, they are plunged into woe! See, Captain, depicted on your chart your destined <HI>port!</HI> how minutely it is laid down! yet, not more certain than is the <HI>harbour</HI> of eternal rest in God's most sacred page. O let me have my heaven in view, my days shall then be bliss, nor cares shall rob my heart! Come thou celestial winds, fill my <HI>sails,</HI> and I shall speed my way to yonder happy shore, and see my God, my Father, and my Friend!</P>
<P>'Tis almost twelve o'clock:— boy, hand up my <HI>quadrant!</HI> How fine the <HI>horizon</HI>—how clear the sun! What wisdom God hath given to man to form an <HI>instrument</HI> like this—so simple in itself— so useful on the seas! By this we prove our <HI>log</HI> and ascertain our <HI>course.</HI> May you, dear Sir, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, behold the exalted sun of righteousness—by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im confirm your hope, and regulate your life.</P>
<P>Take the <HI>quadrant,</HI> boy, and bring on deck the cherry-rum, the biscuit and the cheese! Every creature of the Lord is good when not abused. Come, <HI>mates,</HI> let's take a cheering glass;—the vessel seems to <HI>heel</HI> to disappoint our lips—well, 'tis sailors' fare! See how yonder <HI>shark</HI> heaves his fins to make us sport. The <HI>dolphin</HI> too, see,
<PB N="14" REF="031228_0019_0FEAF85D5AC3E5F0"/>
he cuts the wave, and darts to catch his <HI>flying</HI> prey. How pleasant is the scene! No verdan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fields, nor shady groves, are here—those we leave for friends at home. Hark! what horrid <HI>oaths</HI> belch from yonder <HI>Jack-tar's</HI> mouth—little does he think on what a slender thread he hangs over Hell's yawning deep. 'Tis habit, sure;—go, Cap∣tain go give him kind reproof—a sailor's heart may feel. Wear ship!—stand to the halyards— all ready—about she goes!—make fast, my lads!</P>
<P>Captain, hear the <HI>boy</HI>—"It is one o'clock and dinner waits."—How fine and mellow is this <HI>beef</HI>; —excellent <HI>cyder</HI>;—how profusely is our table spread! <HI>Boy,</HI> hand some glasses! One glass to our owners, and one to all our absent friends. 'Tis fine <HI>Madeira,</HI> it warms and refreshes as it goes. A few nuts to crack and pick, and then we'll walk again on <HI>deck.</HI> Alas! no news to-day. Po Jose Wetmore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The news-carrier.</NOTE> goes round in vain for us.</P>
<P>The night draws on—the sun begins to fall; <HI>clear</HI> he bids us all farewell! O may I, when spent my days, set like the sun, nor cloud possess! The moon appears, and o'er the deep her silver mande throws. Thanks to that ALMIGHTY LORD who formed the sun to rule the day, and moon to give us light by night. The stars now

But, ah! how faint are these roll∣ing flames when once compared to the righteous throng above! Redeemed from sin and death by Jesus' precious blood, they stand before the throne of God, and celebrate his praise. Great King of heaven, and earth, and seas, O bring my soul to that delightful place where I shall sing thy bound∣less praise, when suns shall rise and set no more!</P>
<P>Call the watch! Put out your lights below! Well, dear Captain, thanks for my entertainment to-day. If you wish to have an hour's chat to∣morrow, let your <HI>cabbin-boy</HI> hand you this paper. Good night, Captain—good voyage—farewell!</P>

there w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Right Honorable George Charles Dyke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, Baron, Lieutenant-General of the Saxon troops, in the service of the King of France. He was born of an ancient and noble family, in Silesia, April 10, 1710, so that it was just on his birth-day that he received his wound. He was of equal abi∣lities as a minister in the closet, and a general in the field: In his younger years he had gone through a regular course of study in the university, and made a great proficiency in philosophy, especially in ma∣thematics; afterwards he studied polemic divinity, till he reasoned himself into an infidel.</P>
<P>During his illness, he shewed not the least desire for pious company, or serious discourse, till the sur∣geon let his valet-de-chambre know that he could not live long. The man then asked his master whe∣ther he did not chuse to be visited by a clergyman? He answered with warmth, I shall not trouble those gentlemen; I know well myself what to be∣lieve and do. His man, not discouraged, continu∣ed thus, My lord, have you ever found me want∣ing in my duty, all the time I have been in your service? He answered, No. Then, replied he, I will not be wanting now; the surgeons count you past recovery, but every one is afraid to tell you so; you stand on the brink of eternity; pray, Sir, order a clergyman to be called. He paused a little,
<PB N="17" REF="031228_0022_0FEB736B6F8A2698"/>
but soon gave his hand to the servant, thanked him for his honesty, and ordered him to send for me.</P>
<P>When I came, the man plainly told me the ge∣neral was a professed infidel. I went in, and, after a short compliment, said, I am told, my lord, your life is near an end, therefore I presume, without any more ceremony, to ask you one plain question: Is the state of your soul such, that you can enter∣tain a solid hope of salvation? He answered, Yes. On what do you ground this hope? He replied, I never committed any wilful sin; I have been liable to frailties; but I trust in God's mercy, and the merits of his Son, that he will have mercy upon me. These words he uttered very slowly, especi∣ally the merits of his Son. I made the following reply: I am apt to believe you are not tainted with the grossest vices, but I fear you a little too pre∣sumptuously boast of never having committed wil∣ful sin; if you would be saved, you must acknow∣ledge your being utterly corrupted by sin, and con∣sequently deserving the curse of God, and eternal damnation. As to your hoping for God's mercy through the merits of his Son, I beg leave to ask you, Do you believe God has a Son—that his Son assumed our nature, in order to be our Saviour— that in the execution of his office he has given am∣ple satisfaction for us, and recovered our title to
<PB N="18" REF="031228_0023_0FEB736CF89029E0"/>
heaven? He answered, I cannot now forbear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more minute description of the state of my soul; let me tell you. Doctor, I have some knowledge of philosophy, by which I have chosen for myself a way of salvation: I have always endeavored to live a sober life, to the uttermost of my power, not doubting but the Being of all beings would then graciously accept me. In this way I stood in need of Christ, and therefore did not believe on him; but if I take the scripture to be a divine revelation, this way of mine I perceive is not the right one; I must believe on Christ, and through him come to God. I replied, You say, <HI>if</HI> you believe the scriptures to be a divine revelation. He fetched a deep sigh, and said, O God! thou wilt make me say, <HI>because</HI> I take the scripture to be thy word. I said, There are grounds and reasons enough to determine the di∣vine origin o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hristianity, as I could shew from its most essential principles, were not the period of your life so short; but we do not now need that diffusive method; faith being the gift of God, a poor sinner tottering on the brink of eternity, has not time to inquire about grounds and reasons: ra∣ther betake yourself to earnest prayer for faith, which, if you do, I doubt not but God will give it you. I had no sooner spoken these words, but, putting off his cap, and lifting up his hands and
<PB N="19" REF="031228_0024_0FEB7373B33C5D10"/>
eyes, he cried out, O almighty God! I am a poor cursed sinner, worthy of damnation; but, Lord Jesus, eternal Son of God, thou diedst for my sins also, it is through thee alone I can be saved. O give me faith, and strengthen that faith! Being extremely weak, he was obliged to stop here. A little after he asked, Is faith enough for salvation? Yes, Sir, said I, if it be living faith. Methinks, said he, it is so already; I perceive it will be more so by and by; let us pray for it.</P>
<P>Perceiving he was very weak, and to give him some rest, I retired into the next room; but he soon sent to call me. I found him praying, and <HI>Jesus</HI> was all he prayed for. I reminded him of some scriptures treating of faith in Christ, and he was much delighted with them; indeed he was quite swallowed up by the grace of Jesus, and would hear of nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified. He cried out, I do not know how it is with me; I never in my life felt such a change; I have power to love Jesus, and to believe in him, whom I so long rejected. O my Jesus, how merciful art thou to me!</P>
<P>About noon I stept home; but he sent for me directly; so that I could scarce eat my dinner. We were both filled with joy, as the partakers of the same grace which is in Jesus; and that in such a
<PB N="20" REF="031228_0025_0FEB73757B5B7EE0"/>
manner, as if we had been acquainted together for many years.</P>
<P>Many officers of the army came to see him con∣tinually, to all of whom he talked freely of Jesus, of the grace of the Father in him, and of the power of the Holy Ghost through him; wondering with∣out ceasing at his having found Jesus, and at the happy change, by which all things on this side eter∣nity were become indifferent to him.</P>
<P>In the afternoon he desired to partake of the Lord's supper; which he received with a melting, praising, and rejoicing heart. All the rest of the day he continued in the same state of soul. Towards the evening he desired, that if his end should ap∣proach I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld come to him, which I promised; but he did not send for me till next morning.</P>
<P>I was told by his valet, that he slept well for some hours, and then waking, prayed for a consi∣derable time, continually mentioning the name of our Lord, and his most precious blood; and that he had desired several of the officers to make his conversion known to his court, (that of the king of Poland.) After some discourse I asked, Has your view of Christ, and his redemption, been nei∣the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> altered nor obscured since yesterday? He an∣swered, Neither altered nor obscured; I have no doubt—not even a remote one: it is just the same
<PB N="21" REF="031228_0026_0FEB737BD1A41530"/>
with me as if I had always believed, and never doubted; so gracious is the Lord Jesus to me a sinner.</P>
<P>The second day he was unwearied in prayer and exercises of faith. Towards evening he sent for me in haste. When I came, I found him dying, and in a kind of delirium; so I could do no more than give him now and then a word of comfort. I pray∣ed afterward for him, and those that were present; some of whom were of high birth and rank. I then, by imposition of hands, as usual, gave him a blessing; which being done, he expired immedi∣ately.</P>
<P>A royal prince who was there (prince Xavier of Saxony) could not forbear weeping; the rest of the officers bewailed the death of their general, yet praised God for having shewn such mercy to him.</P>
<P>I wrote an account of it without delay to his mo∣ther, and had an immediate answer. She was a lady of seventy-two, of exemplary piety. She praised God for his mercy, adding, that he had now answered her prayers, which she had never ceased to offer on his behalf for eleven years.</P>

<HEAD>THE EAGLE.</HEAD>
<P>This creature is so highly enriched by Nature, and so majestic in appearance, that the ancients called it <HI>the bird of Heaven</HI>; but moderns have pronounced it <HI>the king of birds.</HI> According to Linnaeus, he is a species of the second genus called Falco, belonging to the first order accipetes, or ra∣pacious. The eagle is of different sorts, probably only denominated from their colour, and the place of their retreat. That called the golden eagle is most esteemed, being larger and of a more noble appearance than others. His beak is very strong, crooked and sharp; his head and neck are clothed with narrow sharp pointed feathers of a deep brown colour, but those on the head, in old age, turn grey. The whole body is of a dark brown, and
<PB N="24" REF="031228_0029_0FEB7383F7FFFBB8"/>
the feathers of the back are beautifully clouded with a deeper shade. The wings, when clothed, reach to the tail, which is of a deep brown, irregularly bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and blotted with an obscure ash colour. Every year he moults, and becomes almost naked and bald, and then renews its youth by producing a set of new feathers. His legs are yellow, short, and very strong, covered with feathers of a dark grey; his toes are coated with scales, and armed with the most formidable claws. The body may weigh a dozen pounds. From the point of the bill to the tail it measures four feet; and between the points of each wing, when extended, near six feet. He is a bird of great strength, exceeding bold, and very voracious in seizing its prey, which are ge∣nerally geese, cranes, hares, rabbits, lambs, kids, fawns, and serpents; but when impelled by hun∣ger will seize on much larger animals; and Sir Robert Sibbald assures us, that children, when un∣attended, have been devoured by them. They ge∣nerally quench their thirst with the blood of their prey; and, after feeding on the flesh, break the bones to extract the marrow. It is, however, to be observed, that this bird, unless pressed with fa∣mine, will not stoop to carrion, and never devours but what he has earned by his own pursuits. The sight of the eagle is quick, strong, and piercing,
<PB N="25" REF="031228_0030_0FEB7385870BD928"/>
not only discovering their prey at an amazing dis∣tance, but penetrating the rays of the meridian sun. Angelus, the jesuit, informs us that the reason why the eagle, the fibres of whose optic nerves are not stronger than those of other animals, is able to face the sun, and endure its rays, is, that it has two sets of eye-lids; the one thick and close, and the other thiner and finer, which last it draws over the eyes when it looks at any luminous body, and thus breaks the force of its rays. Of all birds the eagle flies the highest, even to a proverb. Prov. xxiii.5. It frequents the highest mountains, and the most in∣accessible clifts of the rock; there they generally make their nest, deposit their eggs, which are sel∣dom more than two. They foster their young with peculiar affection and care. In a time of fa∣mine they are said to feed their young with their own blood, sooner than suffer them to perish. When danger surrounds them, the eagle flutters over the nest to defend the brood from their enemies, or takes them on its wings and bears them away to a more safe retreat. But this bird is most remark∣able for its longevity, and its faculty for sustaining a long abstinence from food. Keysler relates, that an eagle died at Vienna, after a confinement of an hundred and four years.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Thou great Supreme! who hath created every winged fowl after its kind, that they might fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven, at thy command the eagle mounts and maketh her nest on high; she dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place; from thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off; her young ones also suck her blood, and where the slain are there is she. Gen. i.20, 21. Job xxxix.27—30. While the beast of the field, and fowls of the air, praise the name of their adored Creator, may I ever em∣ploy my breath in praising the name of the Lord, for his name alone is excellent, and his glory is above the earth and heaven!</P>
<P>The eagle, with its wings extended, was reli∣giously consecrated by the Persians, and afterwards by the Romans, who, in the second year of the consulate of C. Marius, was fixed upon as the device on their standard, made in relievo of silver or gold, borne on the tops of pikes. This bird, according to the opinion of Martinius, was select∣ed as a deity from the derivation of the <HI>Greek</HI> name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to breath (from which verb says
<PB N="27" REF="031228_0032_0FEB738DD4826590"/>
he, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the air is derived) because it is sacred to <HI>Ju∣piter,</HI> who is allegorically the air.</P>
<P>The most high adorable Jehovah, who hath provided a full, free, and an everlasting salvation for his guilty people, hath graciously condescended to reveal himself and his mercy in every age, by images and emblems, that by objects of sense our faith in him might be established. The Ark and Cherubims, with their apparatus, ordained by God, first for the Tabernacle of Moses, then for the Temple of Solomon, were an exhibition of what had been transacted in heaven, and was yet to be completed for man. The mercy-seat, to be sprin∣kled with atoning blood, was made of pure gold; and of the same piece was beaten out two figures, each possessing four faces, bearing the likeness of an ox, a lion, an eagle, and a man, called the Cherubims of Glory; each of them had wings ex∣tended, embracing each other; and between these Jehovah dwelt, and, by the office of the High Priest, communicated his will, and blessed the tribes of Israel. Some very learned and evangelical writers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Park<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urst, Hut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, &amp;c.</NOTE> have considered these golden hieroglyphics as em∣blems of the Great Ones, the Three Covenantees in the person of the man Christ Jesus, and establish their sentiments on the nature and symbolical uses
<PB N="28" REF="031228_0033_0FEB738F6057B190"/>
of the four creatures. The ox, <HI>fire</HI>—the lion, <HI>light</HI> —the eagle, <HI>spirit,</HI> or <HI>air</HI>; the first expressive of the Father, the second of the Son, and the third of the Spirit; these being in union with the fourth, the likeness of the human nature, assumed by the Son, exhibiting to us the eternal Jehovah engaged in three co-equal persons in the redemption of man. Into these names, as the portion of the church, all who believe, whether Jew or Gentile, under the gospel, are baptised. Matt. xxviii.19.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, as the mercy-seat of pure gold, sprinkled with blood, was a type of Christ, whom God hath set forth a propitiation for sin; and as the cherubs were made out of the very same mass of gold with the mercy-seat, they may not impro∣perly be considered representatives of the personal glories of the same Immanuel. The extraordinary eye of the eagle, capable of penetrating the rays of the sun, and to discover its object at so remote a distance, and his power by flight to ascend up on high, are no inexpressible emblems of the omnisci∣ence and omnipresence peculiar to the Son of God. The <HI>ox</HI> equally expresses the labor of Jesus in our redemption, and the <HI>lion</HI> his boldness and magnani∣mity in the execution of his work. These, united with the features of a <HI>man,</HI> not only denote his wond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ul incarnation, but his eternal love and be∣nevolence
<PB N="29" REF="031228_0034_0FEB73928DD89DE0"/>
to mankind: Of this we are certain, that as an eagle stireth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings—so Jesus, as the Redeemer of his people, beareth their persons, their guilt, their punishment, and their necessities; defendeth them from their foes, elevates them to the highest abodes of heaven, and actually feedeth them with his own most precious blood. Deut. xxxii.11.</P>
<P>As Christ and his people are <HI>one,</HI> it is not un∣common for the Spirit of inspiration to express them by the same emblem. As the eagle changeth his feathers, and reneweth his youth, so many of the children of the Lord, like David, molts, if I may so say, and loose the vigor of health, the enjoy∣ments of life, and the very comforts of their souls; but, through the bounties of Providence, and the riches of all-glorious grace, GOD forgiveth their iniquities, healeth their infirmities, and satisfieth their mouth with good things, so that their youth is renewed like the eagle's. Psa. ciii. By the so∣vereign aid of his Spirit, they again ascend up on high, and, by faith, contemplate the splendor of the Sun of Righteousness, and bask beneath the bright beams of his love. Isa. xl.31. At the day of resurrection, clothed anew with salvation and
<PB N="30" REF="031228_0035_0FEB7398DF164C38"/>
glory, the body likewise shall arise from the earth, and fly away as an eagle towards heaven, and take its eternal rest in the mansions of never-fading bliss!</P>

<P>The period at which you have now ar∣rived, most certainly demands your devout acknow∣ledgment to the Author of your being.

How bountiful has the Almighty been in the bestowment of mental accomplishments upon you, and from which, as your parent, I an∣ticipate your future usefulness in the world! yet, my child, those who have arrived at the meridian of life know that your stage is the most critical, important, and dangerous. The latent evils of your heart will now begin to issue forth as bitter waters from a corrupted spring: the world will unfold to you her delusive charms, and ten thousand objects will advance to tempt your feet from the path of honor.—Wipe away that tear which stands trem∣bling in your eye; be assured, my son, had I rea∣son to believe you would thus depart from virtue, I should be the most wretched of fathers.

<P>I am glad you begin to feel yourself— this is one step towards a cure.

Take that book, my son, with a design to trace the source, the nature, and the con∣sequences of that evil your heart so bitterly laments. That these pages exhibit to me my true likeness, as a sinner, is an evidence of their divine original, which my unbelieving heart, nor all the powers of infidelity, can destroy.

<P>A Society of gentlemen, most of them possessed of a liberal education and polished manners, but who, unhappily, had been seduced from a belief of the scriptures, used to assemble alternately in each other's houses, on the bank of the Tweed, for the purpose of ridiculing Revelation, and harden∣ing each other in their infidelity. At last they unanimously formed a resolution solemnly to burn the Bible, and so to be troubled no more with a book which was so hostile to their principles, and disquieting to their consciences. The day fixed upon came—a large fire was prepared—a Bible was laid upon the table, and a flowing bowl stood ready to drink its dirge. For the execution of their plan, they fixed upon a young gentleman of high birth, brilliant vivacity, and elegance of manners. He undertook the task, and, after a few enliven∣ing glasses, amidst the applauses of his jovial com∣panions, he approached the table, took up the Bible, and was walking resolutely forward to put it in the fire; but, happening to give it a look, all at once he was seized with trembling; paleness over∣spread his countenance, and his whole frame seem∣ed convulsed.

<HEAD>OBITUARY.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 26th of September, 1795, died, in the 32d year of his age, of the malignant fever which then prevailed in New-York, the Rev. JACOB BRUSH, one of the Elders of the Methodist Epis∣copal Church. Mr. Brush attended Mr. Court∣ney, at whose house he boarded, and who died of the fever; and on the next Lord's-day he preached a sermon on the occasion, from Matt. xxv.23. in the new church. Mr. Brush, immediately on his return home, was taken ill, languished five days and died, and on the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr. Kingston preached a sermon, from Rev. xiv.13. in the same pulpit, on the death of Mr. Brush.
<PB N="47" REF="031228_0052_0FEB73CD836648F8"/>
Shall not this event make a solemn impression upon surviving Ministers, that they may so faithfully dis∣charge their office as to be ready to go from the pulpit to the tribunal of Jehovah? What is yet remarkable, Mr. Brush, in a few days, was to have been married to Miss E. M.—How soon may our most pleasing prospects be over-cast, and we torn from the embraces of our friends, and lodged in the chambers of corruption!</P>
<P>Mr. Brush, at an early period of life, became seriously affected with divine things. After deep distress for sin, he obtained faith in Christ as his Saviour. He then thought it his duty to preach the Gospel of that Christ who had done so much for his soul, and in 1785 he was admitted as proba∣tioner into the Conferrence of Methodist Minis∣ters. In 1788 he was ordained a <HI>Deacon,</HI> and in 1790 he entered the <HI>Eldership.</HI> As a minister, he was zealous, wise, bold and successful; as a chris∣tian, devout and circumspect; and as a friend, sympathetic, kind and constant. In his last sick∣ness he appeared solemnly happy; and, a few hours before his death, he was asked "Whether he felt happy in God, and had an assurance of the divine favour?" To which (by signs) he answered in the affirmative. The last Lord's-day that he preached he appeared to be so resigned to the will
<PB N="48" REF="031228_0053_0FEB73CF103A2CC0"/>
of God, that some of the hearers observed, "they never heard him preach with so much power before, and that he seemed to preach as though it were his last."</P>
<P>Thus was cut off, in the prime of life, a pro∣mising and useful Minister of Christ, and as highly beloved among the people of his connection.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>In thee, my <HI>Brush,</HI> the Lord did sweetly join</L>
<L>The Friend, the Christian, and Divine;</L>
<L>Thy message was, "go preach the sacred word,"</L>
<L>Nor didst thou fear to draw the preacher's sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Supported thus thy race through life is run,</L>
<L>Thy battle fought, and crown of glory won:</L>
<L>Thy Master smiles and bids thee to retire,</L>
<L>With "Well done servant, now receive thy hire!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Escap'd from earth, thou'st gain'd the happy plain,</L>
<L>Where tempting is no more, nor racking pain;</L>
<L>There Jesus views his flock with sweet delight;</L>
<L>He looks benign, and says they are his right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My <HI>Brush,</HI> my <HI>friend,</HI> and <HI>brother,</HI> ever dear!</L>
<L>Thy memory from my eye extorts a tear,</L>
<L>Of friendship, while thy worth I view▪</L>
<L>By few excell'd among the pious few.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O God of love! our hearts do thou inspire</L>
<L>To live, to preach, like <HI>Brush,</HI> and never tire;</L>
<L>So shall we meet in realms of bliss above,</L>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON JUSTIFICATION.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>[By the Rev. William Rogers, D. D. Professor of Eng∣lish and Belles Letters in the University of Penn∣sylvania.]</BYLINE>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</P>
<BIBL><HI>ISAIAH.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JUSTIFICATION is one of the most import∣ant articles of our holy religion, and demands our most solemn attention. Brevity and perspicuity be∣ing our aim in preparing this paper, we shall—ex∣plain
<PB N="50" REF="031228_0055_0FEB73D6F1671C28"/>
the <HI>term</HI>—consider the <HI>author</HI>—the <HI>objects</HI> interested—the <HI>blessings</HI> resulting.</P>
<P>We are, I. To explain the term. Justification, spiritually or evangelically considered, is a complete acquittal from imputed and contracted guilt; a de∣liverance from the condemning power of sin; an act of free grace flowing from Jehovah's sovereign good will and pleasure. By many eminent divines this leading doctrine is considered as twofold — ETERNAL and DECLARATIVE. By the <HI>former,</HI> we understand that which existed in the divine mind from everlasting, respecting the chosen seed, united with Christ their head, "who hath saved us, ac∣cording to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began." 2 Tim. i.9. By the <HI>latter,</HI> viz. declarative justi∣fication, is designed <HI>that</HI> which, in time, takes place in or on the conscience of a believer, commonly stiled <HI>justification by or through faith.</HI> It is upon <HI>this</HI> we now address you. To be <HI>thus</HI> fully absolved from all sin and guilt, by virtue of Christ's plenary satisfaction, and pronounced "heirs of eternal life," oh, how enlivening the thought! how animating the reflection! "Bless the Lord, O our souls, and all that is within us, bless his holy name."</P>
<P>We come, II. to consider the author of our justi∣fication. "It is God who justifieth." Rom. viii.33.
<PB N="51" REF="031228_0056_0FEB73DA5A3D9338"/>
A Triune God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost. A truth this, when viewed in all its parts, calculated to excite not only within <HI>us,</HI> but amid the angelic choir the highest wonder, "which things the angels desire to look into." 1 Pet. i.12. "Whom GOD hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remis∣sion of sins that are past, through the Forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteous∣ness; that <HI>he</HI> might be just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus. Rom. x.25, 26. "Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgive∣ness of sins; and by HIM all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses." Acts xiii.38, 39. "And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the SPIRIT of our God." 1 Cor. vi.11. Many other pertinent texts might be quo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ed; but permit us, previous to our dismission of this head, to mention, with all due conciseness, a few of the causes of our being thus <HI>justified</HI> or pronounced RIGHTEOUS. "The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them who have pleasure <HI>therein,</HI>" is of equal force now as when penned by Israel's king. Thus supported, we will not be backward in asserting—</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="52" REF="031228_0057_0FEB73DC0327B570"/>1st. That <HI>from</HI> this main pillar, this Sublime Characteristic of gospel truth, <HI>man's obedience to a law of works</HI> is to be utterly excluded. Paul peremptorily says, "By the deeds of the law no flesh shall be justified in his sight." Rom. iii.20. This <HI>single</HI> declaration, confirmed by repeated equal tes∣timony, condemns at once every idea of justification by virtue of our own doings. Those who harbour a sentiment so opposed to Jehovah's revealed will, vainly imagine, consistent with themselves, to bring the supreme governor of universal nature under obligation to do <HI>them</HI> good. But, beloved, <HI>we</HI> have not so learned Christ, <HI>we</HI> do not wish to rob the blessed Redeemer of the brightest jewel in his me∣diatorial crown, <HI>we</HI> do not intend thus basely to detract from that glory which peculiarly belongs to the sacred <HI>Three-One.</HI> "For there is not a just man upon earth who doeth good and sinneth not." Ecc. vii.20. "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Isa. lxiv.6.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. What is by too many denominated <HI>com∣pliance with gospel terms,</HI> we do not admit as hav∣ing any claim. The gospel of our salvation is un∣conditional; it knows no <HI>terms</HI> on our part as lead∣ing to a justifying righteousness. <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>repent∣ance</HI> are graces bestowed by the Spirit of God; they are blessings flowing from that covenant which
<PB N="53" REF="031228_0058_0FEB73E261DEAF50"/>
is ordered in all things, and sure. In fine, regene∣ration of soul, sanctification of heart, sincerity of disposition, holiness of life, persevering fidelity, un∣deviating acquiescence in Jehovah's government, steady zeal for Immanuel's interest, all our own pious frames of mind, comfortable feelings and ap∣proving testimonies of conscience are, with respect to this all-essential doctrine, to be kept <HI>totally</HI> out of view. To what, then, is our justification to be ascribed?</P>
<P>We reply, 1st. To the mere grace or favour of God as the <HI>moving</HI> cause, "being justified freely by his grace." Rom. iii.24. "But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared; not by works of righteousness, which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us." Titus iii.4, 5. <HI>That,</HI> which never could have been found out by men or angels, the wisdom of Jehovah contrived, and his love hath made known. <HI>This</HI> is the original source. Here is the fountain from whence all springs.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. To the life and passion of Jesus as the <HI>pro∣curing</HI> cause. "But God commendeth his love to∣wards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then being now <HI>justified by his blood,</HI> we shall be saved from wrath through him." Rom. v.8, 9. He fulfilled every precept,
<PB REF="031228_0059_0FEB73E3EDA64F50"/>
he bore the whole penalty of the law in the room and stead of his people: thus was the law magnified and rendered honourable, an end made of sin and everlasting righteousness brought in; "and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." Jeremiah xxiii.6. Oh glorious name! predicted long before his in∣carnation—Unto whom should we go but unto our once bleeding but now risen Saviour for acceptance? —For us he drank the bitter cup—Let us not substitute any thing in the place of his noble sacri∣fice—It is <HI>now</HI> a righteous thing with God, freely to <HI>justify</HI> and abundantly to <HI>pardon.</HI> "In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory." Isaiah xlv.25. The robe of Christ's righteousness is a garment down to the foot, where∣with every member of the mystical body is amply covered; "for he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God, in him." 2 Cor. v.21. "Such an high priest became us who is holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners." Heb. vii.26. Should any put the question—How doth Christ's righteousness, thus consisting of the holi∣ness of his nature, his active and passive obedience, become our's in such wise that we also are neces∣sarily deemed RIGHTEOUS?</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="031228_0060_0FEB73E5CCF542C0"/>We readily answer—By IMPUTATION; by making it over unto us; reckoning it our's, or placing it to our account, being wrought out by our elder brother on behalf of the whole ransom∣ed flock. "David describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God <HI>imputeth</HI> righteousness with∣out "works." Rom. iv.6.—Pursuant, therefore, to the unalterable purpose of heaven, agreeable to the oeconomy of man's redemption, this righteous∣ness of the precious Jesus, whereof so many glo∣rious things are spoken, is as much our's as though wrought out by ourselves in our own proper per∣sons. Rom. v.18, 19. Phil. iii.8, 9. Thus clothed upon with raiment of needle-work—Thus united with the HEAD, how can the members be viewed by God the judge of all but as perfectly and com∣pletely justified? "And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power." Col. ii.10.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Our justification is by some ascribed to <HI>faith</HI> as an <HI>instrumental</HI> cause. Strictly speaking, we apprehend <HI>saith</HI> as no cause at all in this mo∣mentuous procedure, but rather as an effect. It is true, the scriptures frequently mention a <HI>justifi∣cation by faith</HI>—By such expressions it is evident the <HI>object,</HI> and not the <HI>act</HI> of faith, is designed: the object of faith is Christ and his righteousness: this
<PB N="56" REF="031228_0061_0FEB73E8F3C860D0"/>
the believing soul holds fast. Faith is the eye which discovers, the hand which receives; espying a Sa∣viour's worth, charmed with his merit, the believer is so enraptured as to cast away all his heavy burden, falls at Messiah's feet, confides in the promise, and pleads atoning blood, "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness." Rom. x.10. It is beautifully observed by one of our very first and most orthodox writers: "The reason why any are justified is not because they have faith—But the reason why they have faith is because they are justified." If justified by faith as a work performed by us, or as a grace wrought without us, where would have been the necessity of the death and resurrection of Jesus? Faith is that precious grace by which we do, in a certain manner, put on the righteousness of the Lord's anointed, and receive the greatest of all bles∣sings from the God of our salvation. "It is a grace (saith one) which quarrels much with human pride, and makes its only boast of Sharon's rose; and ne∣ver was meant to be our justifying righteousness in the sight of God, else it would learn to <HI>boast</HI>— Faith says, 'In the Lord have I righteousness,' and tells a sinner, 'I cannot save thee,' thou art saved by grace <HI>through</HI> faith." The grace of Jesus, and that alone, brings salvation; and the sinner, <HI>through faith,</HI> as an instrument put in his hand, is enabled
<PB N="57" REF="031228_0062_0FEB73EF58462450"/>
to reach the rich donation; just as a begger, by his <HI>empty</HI> cap stretched forth, receives an alms. We proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. To describe the objects interested. In the Examination of this particular, what abundant rea∣son have we to adopt the prophetic language, "to the law and to the testimony? If they speak not ac∣cording to this word, it is because there is no light in them." Isaiah viii.20. The persons justified through rich and sovereign grace are in the living oracles declared to be "ungodly," Rom. iv.5. also "sinners." Gal. ii.17. Was it not for declara∣tions like these, where would be our comfort? We are all <HI>sinners,</HI> we are all <HI>ungodly</HI>; does it from hence follow, that <HI>all</HI> who are sinners, <HI>all</HI> who are ungodly, are without exception justified? By no means! the whole canon of scripture combine with the dictates of sound experience to render every such idea inadmissible. It is true, we read, "that by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life." Rom. v.18. By a careful revision of what goes before and follows after, we shall find the apostle did not mean <HI>all men</HI> absolutely, but <HI>all the chosen, all believers</HI>; his epistle was directed to "all that be in Rome, be∣loved of God, called to be saints." Moreover, the <HI>justified</HI> are represented as a <HI>peculiar</HI> people, and
<PB N="58" REF="031228_0063_0FEB73F0E361D0C8"/>
have such characters ascribed to them as cannot, without the greatest inconsistency and abuse of lan∣guage, be ascribed to all the progeny of fallen Adam. They are spoken of as those who are predestinated, redeemed, pardoned, effectually called, sanctified, regenerated, &amp;c. That these things are not <HI>true,</HI> with respect to <HI>all</HI> the lapsed family, every <HI>unpreju∣diced</HI> mind must acknowledge. Upon the whole, those who are <HI>unworthy</HI> and <HI>guilty</HI> in themselves, but in the everlasting covenant <HI>elected</HI> and <HI>beloved,</HI> have that righteousness whereon their justification is founded, not only exhibited to them by the gos∣pel, but brought nigh by the Holy Ghost, these are the "purchased possession," this is the "bride," the lamb's wife; between whom and the Lord Je∣ses, an union not only now exists, but hath exist∣ed, ancient as eternity itself, "I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore, with loving kindness have I drawn thee," Jer. xxxi.3. a mul∣titude which no man can number. The</P>
<P N="4">IV. And last thing proposed for investigation, is the blessings resulting from justification.</P>
<P>Where shall we begin, and how shall we end? blessings great indeed croud in upon us! blessings beyond compare are consequential on our being thus freely justified! a doctrine pregnant with com∣fort inexpressible! a foundation is hereby laid not
<PB N="59" REF="031228_0064_0FEB73F2B7485BE8"/>
simply for fluctuating hope, but for the full assur∣ance of present and future bliss. By virtue hereof, we experience—1. A freedom or deliverance from sin and condemnation. From <HI>all</HI> sin, as to its guilt, from its reigning power and dominion, and by and by from its in-being "the blood of Jesus Christ his son, cleanseth us from all sin." 1 John i.7. Heb. x.12—14. Our sins are covered and hid from the all-penetrating eye of divine justice, and when sought for hereafter shall not be found; "there is, therefore, now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus." Rom. viii.1. Gal. iii.13. When seriously reflecting on our happy rescue from the hands of satan, our accusing foe; also from death and the grave, as penal evils; but more especially from the pains of hell and the wrath to come; and all as the effect of love divine, what heart among us can remain cold and lifeless? what tongue can cease to praise?—2. As justified we enjoy peace with God. "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Rom. v.1. Connected herewith is real peace of mind. Oh happy souls! brought fully to behold a crucified Redeemer making peace by the blood of his cross, "the chastisement of our peace was upon him." Isaiah liii.5. Knowing this to be the case, well may we, "on the Dove-like
<PB N="60" REF="031228_0065_0FEB73F5ECE197F0"/>
wings of faith, fly, far away from the storms and tempests of an opposing conscience, and find in the <HI>rock of ages</HI> a quiet sanctuary and safe retreat." —3. The acceptance of our persons and services is another blessing resulting herefrom. The Father is well pleased with <HI>both</HI> for the alone sake of Christ his Son, "to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved." Eph. i.6. Christ's garments smell of myrrh, aloes and cassia, wherewith his people being clad, the Lord smells a sweet savor in <HI>them</HI> also. A view of this emboldens us to draw near to the King of kings. Heb. x.19—22. The person, the blood, the righ∣teousness, the mediation of Jesus, are the only foun∣dation of <HI>all</HI> our <HI>pleas</HI> at the celestial throne.—4. As justified we are blessed through life, shall be so at death, and through eternity. While on earth, we are expressly assured that "all things work to∣gether for our good:" when summoned to die, we need not fear the grim messenger. The property of temporal death, with respect to God's people, is greatly changed; it puts an end to all their sorrows, hath its sting taken away, and will prove to be our very great gain. In honour and triumph are such conveyed to the mansions above; and oh, with what joy are the everlasting doors expanded wide for their reception! Our bodies, though moulder∣ing
<PB N="61" REF="031228_0066_0FEB73FC4A12FAC0"/>
to dust, will nevertheless enjoy a glorious re∣surrection—our persons at the last day shall have an honourable distinction, and gracious approbation from the judge supreme. Never-ceasing felicity, con∣summate happiness, and perpetual glory will be our portion. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them who love him." 1 Cor. ii.9. We shall then, O joyful period! live and reign with Christ for ever and ever, and our song will uninterruptedly be, "unto him who loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood; and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever."</P>

<P>True, my son, the beauties and the law of nature unite and condemn the sin of man, and leave him without excuse.—<HI>William,</HI> your <HI>nag</HI> has caught the fragrance of the morn, and seems almost too sprightly for its rider.</P>

<P>My son, cheerfulness has been your constant companion, why now dejected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart is conscious of its guilt before the Lord. I little thought my offences were so great. The Bible not only informs me that my open sins are cognizable by the Almighty, but that the very words of my lips, and the secret thoughts of my

heart, are exposed to his displeasure. All I can hope for is, that God will give me grace that I may exert my best endeavours to live more holy in my future life. I should be glad, Sir, it, at your lei∣sure, you would write me a few rules by which I may walk more circumspectly, and, by that means, recommend myself to the Divine clemency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>That your future life should be attended with the practice of the most brilliant virtues, and your soul enjoy the approving smiles of God, are the ardent wishes of your father's heart; but, my son, what think you will become of the guilt of those offences you have now confessed? Will fu∣ture obedience compensate for past transgressions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What else can man return?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>If injured <HI>Justice</HI> would accept such return, has man therewith to offer? <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might,</HI> Deut. vi.5. is the requirement of God's most holy law, and to which a penalty is annexed. <HI>The soul</HI> that sinneth shall die. Now, if you can love the Lord without the shadow of variation, and abstain from the least appearance of evil, you might be somewhat more excuseable for your conjecture of an ability to make return for your offences. Such is the state of my heart, even in its best frame, that I cannot pray
<PB N="64" REF="031228_0069_0FEB7402E5EEE830"/>
without a wandering thought, nor attempt to love the Lord without lamenting extreme alloy; like Paul, <HI>when I would do good, evil is present with me.</HI> Suppose a holy life could be produced, will Justice accept it for past transgressions? You lately accompanied me to the <HI>supreme court,</HI> and heard the trial of a man criminated for a capital offence; you heard his protestations; but did the law accept his plea, or reverse the sentence? No, the judges told him they were the servants of the people, and the guardians of the law, which he had offended, and instantly pronounced upon him the solemn sen∣tence of death. If such be the inflexibility of hu∣man law, can we suppose the holy, just, and good law of God capable of variation? As many as are under this law, and found sinners, are under its curse; for cursed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>My son, my tears mingle with your own. What a mercy is it that MERCY, the spee∣diest messenger of God, hath found its way to man! Jesus, the Son of God, hath engaged for sinners. That Law and Justice should unite in pronouncing pardon, Jesus assumed our <HI>nature,</HI> was charged with our <HI>guilt,</HI> obeyed the law, and magnified it in his life, and by shedding of his blood and bowing in death on the cross, he made the violated law honour∣able, and God became just in pardoning sinners. Here, my child, is your relief, and here is my con∣solation—A free, full, glorious salvation in the Son of God, who says by Isaiah, look unto me all ye ends of the earth, for I am God, and besides me there is no Saviour. It is the same Jesus that be∣stows this blood-bought pardon, that must give you eyes of faith to behold his glory, and an heart to enjoy his grace. Be not overwhelmed with grief; sinners Jesus came to save, and he hath said, <HI>he that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Plead with him by prayer, depressed as you may be, and remember that he hath promised his Spirit to them that ask him,—who will help their infirmities,— testify of Christ,—apply the virtues of Christ,—

and give you boldness to call God your father in him.</P>

<P>True. Perhaps a little while ago, they were surrounded with storm and tempest; the heavens appeared to cast their awful frowns, while the trembling sailors beheld Death riding upon every wave.

<HEAD>The Life of the late Reverend and learned <HI>AU∣GUSTUS MONTAGUE TOPLADY,</HI> M. A. Vicar of Broad Hembury, in Devonshire, Great-Britain.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent servant of Christ was born at Farnham, in Surrey, Nov. 4, 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a captain in the army, died at the siege of <HI>Carthagena</HI> soon after the birth of his son. Augustus received the first part of his education at Westminster school; but it becoming necessary for his mother to make a journey to Ire∣land, to pursue some claims to an estate in that king∣dom, he accompanied her thither, and was entered at <HI>Trinity College</HI> in Dublin, where he took his degree of <HI>Bachelor in arts.</HI> In August. 1756, being in his 16th year, the Lord visited his soul with salvation under the ministry of Mr. Morris, while preaching from Eph. ii.13. "Strange, says Mr. Toplady, that I, who had so long sat under the means of grace in England, should be brought nigh to God, in an obscure part of Ireland, amidst an handful of God's people met together in a barn and under the ministry of one who could hardly spell his own name! Surely, it was the Lord's doing, and is marvellous! The excellency of such power
<PB N="68" REF="031228_0073_0FEB740FA633B190"/>
must be of God, and cannot be of man. The re∣generating spirit breathes not only <HI>on whom,</HI> but likewise <HI>when, where,</HI> and <HI>as</HI> HE listeth."</P>
<P>Mr. Toplady enjoying the comforts of religion in his soul, God gave him a most ardent desire for the ministry of the gospel; and, as he abhorred the Popish tenet, that "Ignorance was the mother of devotion," so his wish, as well as his duty, was, to be <HI>thoroughly furnished</HI>; and to avoid the presump∣tion of teaching the <HI>ignorant and those that are out of the way,</HI> without having the knowledge, as well as the grace, indispensibly necessary for that purpose, he pursued his studies with redoubled ar∣dour, and directed them entirely for the honour of his Lord and the good of men. On June the 6th, 1762, Mr. Toplady received <HI>episcopal ordination,</HI> and some time after was inducted to the living of <HI>Broad Hembury,</HI> where he laboured in the gospel with success, and composed most of those writings which will render service to the church, and do ho∣nour to his memory, while truth and learning shall be esteemed valuable among men. He had no pre∣ferment in the church besides the vicarage of Broad Hembury, which, as his mind could never brook the idea of living ill with his parish on account of tythes, did not amount to 80l. a year. His own account of his engaging in the pastoral office, in his <HI>Historie

Proof,</HI> is too excellent to be omitted here. "I bles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God," says he, "for enabling me to esteem the re∣proach of Christ greater treasure than all the ap∣plause of men, and all the preferments of the church. When I received Orders, <HI>I obtained mercy to be faithful,</HI> and from that moment gave up what is called the <HI>world,</HI> so far as I conceived it to interfere with faith and a good conscience.—I can never be sufficiently thankful, that my religious principles were all fixed long before I entered into orders. Through the good hand of my God upon me, I sat out in the ministry with clear gospel-light from the first; a blessing not vouchsafed to every one. Many an evangelical minister has found himself obliged to retract, and unsay what he had taught before in the days of his ignorance. Lord, how is it that I have been so signally favoured of Thee! O keep me to the end stedfast in thy truth! Let me but go on <HI>ex∣perimentally</HI> to know Thee, and then it will be ab∣solutely impossible for me to depart from the precious doctrines of grace; my early insight into which I look upon as one of the distinguished blessings of my life."—"For my own part," says he in a letter to a friend, "I wish to live and die with the sword of the spirit in my hand, and, as Dr. Young expresses it, <HI>never to put off my armour till I put on my shroud.</HI>"—Nor did he fail of his wish; he had, as it
<PB N="70" REF="031228_0075_0FEB74179D20AA40"/>
were, taken me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sure for his shroud be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re he lay down his pen▪ in defence of the pure doctrines of God's everlasting love, and his discriminating, all-glorious grace to men.</P>
<P>In September, 1773, on the introduction of the Rev. John Ryland, sen. of Northampton, Great-Britain, the college in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> conferred on Mr. Toplady the degree of MASTER IN THE ARTS. In 1775, finding his bodily constitution much impaired by the moist atmosphere of Devon∣shire, with which it never agreed, he removed to London. Here, by the solicitation of his numer∣ous friends, and from a desire to promote the wel∣fare of Zion, he engaged the chapel belonging to the French Reformed, near Leicester Fields, where he continued in the exercise of his ministry as fre∣quent as his health permitted, God crowning his la∣bours with the most pleasing success. By a slow consumption he, however, gradually drew to the period of his life. As his outward man wasted, his inward man was refreshed and renewed, day by day. Still, while life and breath remained, he must be either preaching or writing, to vindicate the honour of his Master, and propagate the glory of evangelic truth, for the comfort of the souls of men. To a friend, who expressed some concern for his own ease in his debilitated state, on his close
<PB N="71" REF="031228_0076_0FEB741928E82330"/>
applications, he thus replied, "God give us to sink deeper and deeper into his love, and to raise higher and higher into the image of his holiness! and thoroughly persuaded I am, that the more we are enabled to love and resemble Him, the more active we shall be to promote his glory, and to extend his cause with our lips, our pens, our lives, our all. Be this our business, and our bliss, on earth! In heaven we shall have nothing to do, but to <HI>see him as he is,</HI> to participate his glory, and to sing his praise, in delightful, in never-ending concert with angels, with saints who are got home before us, and with those of the elect, whom we knew and loved here below." The nearer he drew to the grave, the more abundantly did the consolation of God abound in him. He looked not only with composure, but delight on the tomb, and groaned earnestly to enter the mansions of the blessed. Dr. Young's beautiful expression, <HI>one eye on death, and one full fixed on heaven,</HI>" was never more evident than in Mr. Toplady. While on his dying bed, he discovered a remarkable jealousy, for fear of receiving any part of that honour which is due to Christ alone. He desired to be nothing, and that Jesus might be all, and in all.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding Mr. Toplady was so highly fa∣voured with the smiles of the Saviour, he had a
<PB N="72" REF="031228_0077_0FEB741C555F7F20"/>
proportionate sensibility of his wretchedness as a sinner. "Oh!" said he, "that ever such a wretch as I should be tempted to think highly of himself! I that am, of myself, nothing but sin and weak∣ness; I, in whose flesh naturally dwells no good thing; I who deserve damnation for the best work I ever performed! Lord Jesus, humble me to the dust, yea, to the very center of abasement, in <HI>thy</HI> presence. Root out and tear up this most poison∣ous, this most accursed weed, from the unworthiest heart that ever was! Keep me sensible of my <HI>sin∣nership.</HI> Sink me down, deeper and deeper, into penitence and self-abhorrence! Break the dagon of pride in pieces before the ark of thy merits! Demolish, by the breath of thy Spirit, the walls, the bables of self-righteousness and self-opinion;— level them with the trodden soil, grind them to powder, annihilate them for ever and ever!— Grace! grace! be all my experience, and all my cry."</P>

</FIGURE> THE ELEPHANT.</HEAD>
<P>THE elephant is supposed to be the <HI>largest</HI> of any quadruped in the known world; and seems to be the <HI>wisest</HI> also. The observation is Cicero's: whose words (<HI>De Nat. Deor.</HI> i.) are, "Ele∣phanto belluarum nualla providentior. At figurâ quae vastior?" All the <HI>amiable,</HI> and all the <HI>furious</HI> passions, are to be found in this animal: and its <HI>docility</HI> is wonderful; for, when properly tamed, he is capable of being instructed and disciplined into a vast variety of entertaining and useful qualifica∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="031228_0079_0FEB7424343714A8"/>Do him a material injury, and he'll act as if he had been tutor'd by the late Lord Chesterfield; i. e. if it be in his power, he will <HI>immediately</HI> revenge the affront; but it restrained for the present, either by motives of prudence, or by inability to wreak his resentment, he will <HI>retain</HI> the offence in his memory for years together, and take care to repay it with interest, the first favourable opportunity. I have heard or read of a boy, who wantonly struck the proboscis, or trunk, of an elephant; and then courageously secured himself by running away. Seven years afterwards, the lad was playing near the side of a river; and had, probably, forgot his past misdemeanor. But the elephant had a better memory; and, making up to the young delinquent, grasped him with his trunk, and very sedately car∣ried the sprawling captive to the water; where he ducked him once or twice over head and ears, and then quietly setting him down again on terra firma, permitted him to walk off without further hurt.</P>
<P>It is said, that in those countries where elephants abound, such of them as are tame, go about the streets, like any other domestic animal; and, it is common for people to give them fruit as they pass. In time they commence absolute <HI>beggars,</HI> and will put in the extremity of their trunks at doors and windows, in hope of receiving the little benevo∣lences
<PB N="75" REF="031228_0080_0FEB74275B18C098"/>
which custom has inured them to expect. After waiting a short while, if nothing is given them, they withdraw their trunks, and pass on to the next accessible house. It is related, that some taylors were at work, on a board, withinside of a window whose casement stood open. A passing elephant stopt, and put in his trunk. One of the men, instead of conferring a douceur, gave the animal's trunk a <HI>scratch</HI> with his needle. The injur'd party took no present notice of the provoca∣tion, but patiently walked away. He repaired to a neighbouring stream; and, having filled his ca∣pacious trunk with a large quantity of water, re∣turned to the window, where he coolly avenged himself, by spouting the fluid artillery on the ag∣gressor and his comrades, for their late breach of hospitality.—If we do not <HI>relieve</HI> the indigent, they at least have a right not to be <HI>insulted.</HI> And, very frequently, the meanest are able, sooner or later, to <HI>retaliate,</HI> with usury, the contempt they undeservedly receive.</P>
<P>Every beggar is not <HI>honest.</HI> Nor are all ele∣phants actuated by a strict sense of moral delicacy. Their smell is very acute: and if a person has any fruit or cakes about him, they shew, by the quick and judicious application of their trunks to the proper part of his dress, that they are adepts in
<PB N="76" REF="031228_0081_0FEB742903E17C08"/>
the art of <HI>picking pockets,</HI> with excellent dexte∣rity.</P>
<P>Elephants, like men, have (if I may be allowed the expression) their <HI>virtues</HI> and their <HI>vices:</HI> though, to the honour of the former be it observed, the vices of an elephant bear but small proportion to his virtues. There have been instances of these creatures, who, in the first hurry of rage for ill-treatment, have killed their keepers. But their subsequent <HI>remorse</HI> has been so insupportably keen, that they have refused to take any sustenance, and literally starved themselves to death. A lesson to persons of <HI>violent passions,</HI> who, if hurried away by the impetuous torrent, either of excessive and unguarded <HI>anger,</HI> or of head-strong and irregular <HI>desire,</HI> are liable to the commission of irreparable evil, and may, in a single moment, lay the foun∣da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of irremediable ruin. <HI>He that</HI> HASTETH <HI>with his feet, sinneth.</HI> O believer, if thou art by nature <HI>hasty, vehement,</HI> and easily <HI>inflamma∣ble,</HI> call in superior aid. He who, in the days of his flesh, rebuked the raging of the winds, and still'd the tossings of the sea, can, by the sweet compescing influence of his gracious SPIRIT, re∣strain thee within the bounds of holiness, and speak the storm into a perfect calm. I have read of an Heathen, who, when he found himself unduly fer∣mented
<PB N="77" REF="031228_0082_0FEB742F53B0B1F8"/>
by the kindlings of inward wrath, would never utter a single word, till he had first delibe∣rately run over in his mind all the letters of the al∣phabet. I have read of a Christian, who, when endangered by similar temptation, would not suffer himself to speak a syllable, till he had silently re∣peated the Lord's Prayer. Go, and do thou like∣wise. Repeat that prayer to God, in the spirit of supplication: and thy victory over passion will be more than probable.</P>
<P>Elephants are singularly <HI>grateful,</HI> and have a very deep sense of <HI>friendship.</HI> They have been known to lay the death of a <HI>brother elephant,</HI> or of a <HI>kind keeper,</HI> so much to heart, as to pine away from that time forward. Even virtue, if strained beyond a certain pitch, degenerates into a fault. Nor is it right for us to love, with <HI>too much ardour,</HI> any perishable good. Dr. Owen some∣where remarks, that "strong affections make strong afflictions." Confine, therefore, your <HI>ab∣solue</HI> regards to FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT; the Three glorious Friends, who never die, and whose loving-kindness is immortal as themselves!</P>
<P>In some countries, we are told, <HI>elephants</HI> supply the place of <HI>executioners.</HI> They are trained, at a given signal, to lay hold on the criminal with their trunks, by a strong suction, and either <HI>dash</HI> him
<PB N="78" REF="031228_0083_0FEB7430DCA684B8"/>
violently against the ground, or <HI>toss</HI> him aloft in the air, till repeated contusions put a period to his life.—Mankind are very prone to value themselves on their supposed civilization; and yet, by artfully practising on the ferocity of inferior animals, they sometimes teach brutes themselves to be still more brutal.</P>
<P>Clumsey as elephants are, they may be taught to <HI>dance,</HI> both singly and in companies; and they move, on these occasions, with singular exactness and order. They are not insensible to the harmony of <HI>music</HI>; and, if properly inured, <HI>keep time</HI> with their feet, in a manner which discovers great powers of judgment. If I rightly remember, Bishop Bur∣net informs us, in his travels, that he saw an ele∣phant <HI>play at ball,</HI> with all the ease and expertness of a man. But PLUTARCH, in his life of Pyrrhus, mentions a much nobler instance of elephantin <HI>un∣derstanding</HI> and <HI>adroitness</HI>; accompanied by such magnanimous <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>fidelity,</HI> as would have redounded to the honour of a Sertorius, or of an Alexander. When Pyrrhus stormed the town of Argos, a number of accoutered elephants (accord∣ing to the custom of those times) formed a part of his military apparatus. One of these creatures, perceiving that his rider was fallen, invited him, by every effort in his power, to re-mount. But find∣ing,
<PB N="79" REF="031228_0084_0FEB7432B6F36200"/>
soon after, that he [viz. the rider] was dead of the wounds he had received, the animal, in a transport of grief and rage, rushed furiously on friends and foes, without distinction; and, taking up the body with his trunk, made good his retreat, and rescued the remains of his breathless master from further violation, by faithfully and heroically conveying them from the scene of action.</P>
<P>With all his magnitude and strength, an elephant (if not sour'd by unkind usage) may be rendered so passive and gentle, as to be led and governed by a child. Just representation of that amiable <HI>meekness</HI> and <HI>humility,</HI> wherewith christians of <HI>exalted rank</HI> condescend to men of <HI>low</HI> estate; and persons emi∣nent for <HI>superior grace,</HI> or for <HI>distinguished learn∣ing,</HI> bear with the infirmities, and are courteous to the ignorance of the weak. It was in this spirit that the excellent Doctor WATTS descended from the regions of philosophy, and stooped from the heights of more elevated poetry, to compose his admirable <HI>hymns for children,</HI> and teach infant warblers to lisp the praises of the great THREE-ONE.</P>
<P>The method by which wild elephants are <HI>taken,</HI> deserves to be noticed. A narrow inclosure is made; one end of which is left open, for entrance; and, at the extremity of the other, several tame fe∣male
<PB N="80" REF="031228_0085_0FEB7435F0B65E10"/>
elephants are placed. Between both (i. e. be∣tween the entrance and the extremity where the females are fixed) a large pit is dug, whose surface is lined with a slight bridge-work, so neatly turfed, that it has all the appearance of firm ground. Al∣lured by the females, the male elephants make to∣wards the place, but are suddenly intercepted by the unsuspected snare. Proper persons, who are stationed to watch the event, start from their con∣cealments; and, with exulting shouts, mock the indignant distress of their unwieldy prisoners.— Striking picture of the <HI>deceitfulness of sin</HI>; the unthinking folly of <HI>heedless minds</HI>; and the <HI>ter∣rible effects</HI> of successful temptation.</P>
<P>Elephants are tamed chiefly by <HI>hunger</HI> and by <HI>blows.</HI>—Providence hides pride from man, and bends his stubbornness to obedience, by graciously afflictive dispensations.</P>
<P>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ephants are said to be extremely <HI>fond of pomp,</HI> and to receive very pleasurable ideas from the ex∣hibitions of splendour. Hence the natives of East-India, who hold the doctrine of Transmigration, imagine that these animals are animated by the souls of departed princes. For this reason they are treated (especially in the kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI>) with distin∣guished respect; and some of the handsomest are decorated with rich ornaments, and even dignified
<PB N="81" REF="031228_0086_0FEB743C4B8835A0"/>
with titles of honour. An elephant of quality is known by the rings of gold, silver, or copper with which his tusks are adorned.—There is something very humiliating in the pride of human reason, in conduct so extravagantly absurd as this. Absolute good-nature is absolute folly. And yet, the fanci∣ful surmise of the transmigration of souls from one body into another, is attended with peculiar feli∣cities to the poor beasts who live in countries where that doctrine obtains. It is our duty to adopt the humanity of those heathens without its absurdities; and to be scrupulously tender of the life and hap∣piness of every inferior animal entrusted to our care: knowing that the sovereign Providence, which has made them subservient to our wants, has given us no charter for the exercise of unnecessary cruelty or wonton tyranny.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="account of dream">
<HEAD>A REMARKABLE DREAM OF THE LATE DR. DODDRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctor and Dr. Clarke had been conversing together one evening upon the nature of the separate state, and the probability that the scenes on the which the soul would enter upon its leaving the body, would bear some resemblance to those with
<PB N="82" REF="031228_0087_0FEB743DD6046DC8"/>
which it had been conversant while on ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, that it might by degrees be prepared for the more sublime happiness of the heavenly world. This and other conversation of the same kind probably occasioned the following dream:—</P>
<P>The doctor imagined himself dangerously ill at a friend's house in London; and after laying in this state for some time, he thought his soul left the body, and took its flight in some kind of fine vehi∣cle, which (though very different from the body it had just quitted) was still material. He pursued his course till he was at some distance from the city, when turning back, and reviewing the town, he could not forbear saying to himself, How trifling and how vain do these affairs, in which the inha∣bitants of this place are so eagerly employed, ap∣pear to me a separate spirit. At length, as he was continuing his progress, and though without any certain director, yet easy and happy in the thoughts of the universal providence and government of God, which extends alike to all states and worlds, he was met by one, who told him he was sent to conduct him to the place appointed for his abode; from whence he concluded that it could be no other than an angel, though, as I remember, he appear∣ed under the form of an elderly man. They went accordingly on together, till they came within sight
<PB N="83" REF="031228_0088_0FEB743FA7ABE240"/>
of a spacious building, which had the air of a palace. Upon inquiring what it was, his guide told him it was the place assigned for his residence at present; upon which the doctor observed, that he remembered to have read, while on earth, that "eye had not seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart conceived, what God had laid up for his servants;" whereas he could easily have conceived an idea of such a building from others he had seen, though he acknowledged they were greatly inferior to this in elegance. The answer his guide made him was plainly suggested by the conversation of the evening: it was, that the scene first presented was contrived on purpose to bear a near resemblance to those he had been accustomed to on earth, that his mind might be more easily and gradually prepared for those glories that would open upon him hereafter, and which would at first have quite dazzled and over∣powered him.</P>
<P>By this time they were come up to the palace; and his guide led him through a kind of saloon into an inner parlour. The first thing that struck him was a large golden cup that stood upon the table, on which was embossed the figure of a vine and clusters of grapes. He asked his guide the meaning of this; who told him, it was the cup in which his Saviour drank new wine with his disciples in his
<PB N="84" REF="031228_0089_0FEB7442EE86CFF8"/>
kingdom; and that the figures cared on it were in∣tended to signify the union between Christ and his people, implying, that as the grapes derive all their beauty and flavour from the vine, so the saints, even in a state of glory, were indebted for the establish∣ment and happiness of their union with their Head, in whom they are all complete. While they were thus conversing, he heard a tap at the door, and was informed by the angel, that it was the signal of his Lord's approach, and was intended to prepare him for the interview. Accordingly, in a short time, he thought our Saviour entered the room; and, upon his casting himself at his feet, he gra∣ciously raised him up, and with a look of inexpres∣sible complacency, assured him of his favour, and his kind acceptance of his faithful services: and, as a token of his peculiar regard, and the intimate friendship he intended to honour him with, he took the cup, and, after drinking of it himself, gave it into his hands. The doctor would have declined it at first, as too great an honour; but his Lord re∣plied, (as to Peter, in relation to washing his feet) "If thou drink not with me, thou hast no part in me." This scene, he observed, filled him with such a transport of gratitude, love, and admiration, that he was ready to sink under it. His Master seemed sensible of it, and told him he must leave
<PB N="85" REF="031228_0090_0FEB74494A4EAC00"/>
him for the present, but it would not be long be∣fore he repeated his visit; and, in the mean time, he would find enough to employ his thoughts in re∣flecting on what had passed, and in contemplating the objects around him. As soon as his Lord was retired, and his mind a little composed, he observed the room was hung round with pictures; and, upon examining them more attentively, he discovered, to his great surprize, that they contained the history of his own life. The most remarkable scenes he had passed through being thus represented in the most lively manner, it may easily be imagined how much this would strike and affect his mind. The many temptations and trials he had been exposed to, and the signal instances of the divine goodness towards him in the different periods of his life, which by this means were all presented at once to his view, excit∣ed the strongest emotions of gratitude; especially when he reflected, that he was now out of the reach of any future distress, and that all the purposes of divine love and mercy towards him were at length happily accomplished. The ecstacy of joy and thankfulness into which these reflections threw him, were so great, that they awoke him. But for some considerable time after he arose, the impression con∣tinued so lively, that tears of joy flowed down his cheeks; and he said, that he never on any occasion
<PB N="86" REF="031228_0091_0FEB744AD5004438"/>
remembers to have felt sentiments of devotion, love, and gratitude, equally strong.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="anecdote">
<HEAD>RESIGNATION.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the most remarkable instances of human resignation I ever remember to have met with, is to be found in the conduct of <HI>Archbishop Fenelon.</HI> When his illustrious and hopeful pupil, the <HI>Duke of Burgundy,</HI> lay dead in his coffin, and the nobles of his court, in all the pomp of silent sadness, stood weeping around, the <HI>Archbishop</HI> came into the apartment, and having fixed his eyes for some time on the <HI>corpse,</HI> uttered the sensibility of his soul to this effect:—"There lies my beloved prince, for whom my affections were equal to the tenderest re∣gard of the tenderest parent. Nor were my af∣fections lost; he loved me in return with all the ar∣dor of a son. There he lies, and all my worldly happiness lies dead with him! But if the turning of a <HI>straw</HI> would call him back to life, I would not, for ten thousand worlds, be the turner of that straw, in opposition to the WILL of God." Bles∣sed are they who, under such painful, bereaving providences, possess that charming, submissive grace; are still, and know that the Lord is God alone! Psalm xlvi.10.</P>

<P>ON the 5th of March, 1796, departed this life, Miss REBECCA MOULDER, of this city, in the 26th year of her age. Her remains were interred in the Baptist burying ground, attended by a re∣spectable

<P>Easy in her manners, she rendered herself agree∣able to all.—Her conversation uniformly turned upon subjects calculated to impart benefit; though of so modest a demeanour, her view was—to re∣ceive it.</P>
<P>Possessed of a benevolent heart, she always felt for, and, agreeable to her ability, afforded relief un∣to the poor and distressed.—And as a "christian is the <HI>highest</HI> stile" of any human being—she was one in an eminent degree!</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the Influence of Grace upon the Soul of Man.</HEAD>
<P>AS, when a river is turned into a new channel, the stream forsakes its ancient bed, and pursues a course unknown till then; so the soul of man, when its native captivity to sin and death, is <HI>turned as the rivers in the South,</HI> flows back to God, from whom it ran before; nor ceases to flow, till it has gained the ocean of infinite good.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="031228_0103_0FEB7467C7F4AEA0"/>This is the inseparable effect of union and com∣munion with Christ. The glorious liberty of the children of God, is a liberty from the darkness of unbelief, and from the bondage of moral corrup∣tion, into the light of faith, the fire of love, and law of righteousness. That question in the pro∣phet, <HI>Can the Ethiopean change his skin, or the leopard his spots?</HI> admits of a favourable solution. The converting SPIRIT of God does that for us which we could never do for ourselves. He makes the Ethiopean, in a moral sense, fair as the driven snow; and renders the spotted leopard spotless, in comparison of what he was. The vassals of ini∣quity became vessels of glory; and the soul that once cleaved to the dust of sensuality, and lay dead in trespasses and sins, is quicken'd from above, and made to sit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. When the citadel of the human heart is taken by grace, the enemy's colours are displaced; Satan's usurped authority is superseded; the standard of the Cross is erected on the walls; and the spiritual rebel takes the vow of willing allegiance to Christ, his rightful sovereign. The strong holds to sin on one hand, and of self-righteousness on the other, are batter'd down; and the soul, from that blessed moment, made free indeed, crys out, <HI>Other lords have had dominion over me; but the darkness is
<PB N="99" REF="031228_0104_0FEB74695D5AF808"/>
past, and the true light now shines: the snare is broken, and I am deliver'd.</HI></P>
<P>From this experience of the divine power in our own hearts, we cannot but adopt the celestial anthem, <HI>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men!</HI> Our Conversion becomes known to all; and some of the practical effects, produced by, and connected with, that great display of grace, are these that follow:—</P>
<P>Where <HI>Lust,</HI> that fiery serpent, was wont to crawl, divine LOVE kindles her hallow'd flame, and raises the affections, as on eagles' wings, to heaven.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Unbelief,</HI> blind and sullen as the mole, lay wrapt in malicious gloom, loving darkness ra∣ther than light, and seeking to undetermine what she had not eyes to see, FAITH diffuses the bright∣ness of celestial day, and leads the willing soul to Him who bought her with his blood.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Insensibility,</HI> thoughtless as the bird that hastens to the snare, and gay as a victim crowned for the slaughter, sported on the precipice of de∣struction, and danced on the verge of death, se∣rious CONVICTION fixes her keen, but salutary weapon; and filial FEAR keeps the avenues of the converted person's heart, and the actions of his life, in powerful, but sweet, restraint.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="031228_0105_0FEB746FAE932050"/>Where <HI>Envy</HI> pined, where <HI>Malice</HI> hissed, where <HI>Slander</HI> sharpened her tongue, and <HI>Pride,</HI> that bloated snake, lifted her swelling crest; universal CHARITY throws wide her arms; HUMILITY stoops to the tenderest offices of beneficence; and dove-like MEEKNESS smiles with benignity in her heart, and the law of candour upon her lips.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Intemperance</HI> mixed the intoxicating bowl, and lawless riot pushed the superfluous glass, seeking to drown every thought of eternity, and to sink the poor remains of human dignity, in the poisonous draught; there, religious MODERATION marks out the limits; mindful of that more than golden rule, <HI>Whether ye eat, or drink, or what∣soever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</HI></P>
<P>Where <HI>Prophaneness,</HI> assuming the mask of wit, spawned the irreligious jest, and solicited the hellish laugh, prostituting, perhaps, even the lan∣guage of Scripture to the purposes of licentious mirth, and playing on the very words of the Holy Ghost; trifling with sacred subjects, at which an∣gels tremble, and lightly mentioning that adorable Name, at which angels bow; there, from the mo∣ment of conversion, grace introduces a total change. The renewed sinner abhors himself, as in dust and ashes, for all that he has done; and can never suf∣ficiently adore, admire, and revere, that infinite
<PB N="101" REF="031228_0106_0FEB74713737B248"/>
goodness, which, instead of turning him into hell, has turned him to God, and made him a living mo∣nument, not of deserved vengeance, but of un∣merited mercy. His heart, which, till then, was a sink of impurity and prophanation, is transform∣ed into an house of prayer; and his mouth, once the seat of blasphemy, is consecrated into an altar of praise.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Avarice</HI> sat brooding, tenacious as death, and insatiate as the grave; unfeeling as marble, and deaf to the cries of distress, as the adder that stops her ear: discreet LIBERALITY unlocks the heart, and well-directed Beneficence extends her hand to bestow. The language of the soul is simi∣lar to that of Zacchëus: <HI>Behold, Lord, the half of my goods, I give to the poor; and, if I have taken any thing from any man, by false accusa∣tion, I restore him fourfold.</HI> The true believer, like his adorable Saviour, <HI>goes about, doing good,</HI> and seeking whom he may relieve.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Discontent,</HI> like a wild bull in a net, raged and struggled, turning the rod of affliction into a serpent, and charging Providence with folly; reclining PATIENCE kisses the hand that smites, and, knowing that Infinite Wisdom and Goodness have mingled the draught, not only receives, but even relishes, the cup: while celestial HOPE casts
<PB N="102" REF="031228_0107_0FEB7472C70F28D0"/>
her anchor on the inestimable promise of Him who says, <HI>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee</HI>; and who has immutably declared, that <HI>All things</HI> without exception, <HI>work together for good, to them that love God, to them that are the called accord∣ing to his purpose.</HI> Thus does the follower of Christ, in the communicated strength of the Holy One, take up his cross; content to bear it as long, and to carry it as far▪ as God's unerring will shall please:
<Q><L>"Nor thinks its chance, nor murmurs at the load;</L>
<L>"But knows, what man calls fortune, is from God."</L></Q></P>
<P>Where <HI>sacrilegious Impiety</HI> once robb'd Jeho∣vah of his own Day, and prophaned the SAB∣BATH, either by rioting and excess, or by travel∣ling, or by the transaction of worldly business, or by making it an opportunity of recreation and idle amusement; thus rendering the best of days subservient to the worst purposes, either of atrocious guilt, or of criminal insignificance; either basely selling, or unprofitably squandering, those precious, those irretrievable hours, which should be appro∣priated to the glory of God, and to the spiritual improvement of the soul;—There, religious regard to divine appointment, and love to the gracious
<PB N="103" REF="031228_0108_0FEB747655D0AFB0"/>
Appointer, constrain the Christian to keep the Lord's Day holy to the Lord, and to cultivate an habitual, increasing fitness for the enjoyment of that Sabbatism, that everlasting rest, which remain∣eth for the people of God.</P>
<P>In a word, where <HI>Impenitency,</HI> armed with ten∣fold brass, stiffened her neck, and withdrew her shoulder from the yoke of obedience;—the once obdurate sinner, being made willing in the day of God's power, crys out, with vanquish'd Paul, <HI>Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do?</HI> Tears of contrition flow, like water from the smitten rock; REPENTANCE strikes her conscious breast; and DEVOTION darts her aspiring eyes to heaven.</P>
<P>May those, who have, hitherto, been uncon∣cerned about the great work of conversion, beg of God to shew them the things belonging to their peace, e'er death makes them wise indeed; wise, perhaps, too late!</P>
<P>And may such of us, as are influenced, by grace, to the experimental knowledge, love, and imitation of Christ; be led, farther, and deeper, into acquaint∣ance with God, and communion with his blessed Spirit: gaining, day by day, brighter evidences of our Election to eternal life, and more substantial marks of our interest in the Covenant of Grace. Pray for the full assurance of faith, for the feel∣ing

<HEAD>A PRESERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>SIR James Thornhill was the person who paint∣ed the inside of the famous <HI>cupola</HI> of St. Paul's, London. After having finished one of the com∣partments, he stepped back, gradually, to see how it would look at a distance. He receded so far (still keeping his eye intently fixed on the painting) that he was got almost to the very edge of the scaf∣folding, without perceiving it: had he continued to retreat half a minute more, he must have fallen to the pavement beneath, and completed his destruc∣tion. A person present, who saw the danger the great artist was in, had the happy presence of mind to snatch up one of the brushes, and daubed it over the painting. Sir James, transported with rage, sprung forward to save the remainder of the piece. But his rage was soon turned into thanks, when the person addressed him—"Sir, by spoiling the paint∣ing I have saved the life of the painter. You had advanced to the extremity of the scaffold, without
<PB N="105" REF="031228_0110_0FEB747FE0D17570"/>
knowing it. Had I called to you, to apprize you of your danger, you would naturally have turned to look behind you; and the surprise of finding yourself in such a dreadful situation, would have hastened your fall. I had, therefore, no other me∣thod of retrieving you but by acting as I did."</P>
<P>Not altogether dissimilar to this is God's conduct to his people. It is the vain employ of sinful man, by the imperfect duties of his life, to draw his own portrait, in such delusive colours, as to esteem him∣self worthy the attention of the Almighty; and, after the performance is executed, to view himself in every favourable light to gratify the vanity of his self-righteous heart, although every step he takes in the review, hastens his unwary feet to a fall which must complete his destruction. But, it is the determination of the God of Grace, <HI>to stain the pride of all human glory</HI>; and, as the by-stander daubed the painting of Sir James Thorn∣hill, purposely to save his life from death, so the LORD the SPIRIT mars our legal performances, shews us the guilt that attends them, and their in∣efficiency to justify us before the tribunal of JEHO∣VAH; then directs our attention to JESUS, the Son of God, <HI>the Lord our Righteousness; who, being the brightness of his</HI> FATHER<HI>'s glory, and the express image of his</HI> PERSON, <HI>having purged
<PB N="106" REF="031228_0111_0FEB74819F84D900"/>
our sins,</HI> becomes our only salvation. Then, in∣stead of our hearts arising in resentment against the conduct of the Almighty, in destroying the works of our hands, we thankfully adore his grace, and triumph in his love!</P>

<HEAD>The Life of the late Reverend and learned <HI>AU∣GUSTUS MONTAGUE TOPLADY,</HI> M. A. Vicar of Broad Hembury, in Devonshire, Great-Britain. (Continued from page <HI>72,</HI> and concluded.)</HEAD>
<P>ON a friend's suggesting to Mr. Toplady the loss which the Church of Christ would sustain by his death, the utmost discomposure was visible in his countenance, and with extreme sensibility he exclaimed, "What, by my death? No! By my death? No! Jesus Christ is able, and will, by pro∣per instruments, defend his own truths. And with regard to what little I have been enabled to do in this way, not to me, but to his name, and to that only, be the glory." A short time preceding his death, his friend and physician, on his own earnest request, informing him that his heart and arteries evidently beat, every day, weaker and weaker; he
<PB N="107" REF="031228_0112_0FEB74832CB079B8"/>
replied immediately with a smile,—"<HI>Why, that's a good sign, that my death is fast approaching; and blessed be God, I can add, that my heart beats every day stronger and stronger for glory.</HI>"</P>
<P>Another friend took the liberty to ask him, if in his present situation he had any <HI>doubt</HI> remaining upon his mind respecting the <HI>truth</HI> of those prin∣ciples he had so warmly propagated in his ministry. He replied,—"<HI>Doubt, Sir, doubt! Pray use not that word when speaking of me. I cannot endure the term; at least while God continues to shine upon my soul, in the gracious manner he now does. Not,</HI>" added he, "<HI>but that I am sensible, that while in the body, if left of him, I am capable, through the power of temptation, of calling into question every truth of the gospel; but that is so far from being the case, that the manifestation and comforts of his love are so abundant as to ren∣der my state the most desirable in the world. I would not exchange my condition with any one upon earth. And with respect to my principles, those blessed truths which I have been enabled in my poor measure to maintain, appear to me more than ever, most gloriously indubitable. My own existence is not, to my apprehension, a greater cer∣tainty. To me sickness is no affliction; pain no curse; death itself no dissolution.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="031228_0113_0FEB74865E1AAE28"/>A few days before his death, he said to a friend, with his hands clasped, and his eyes lifted up, flow∣ing with tears of evident joy, "<HI>O, my dear Sir, I cannot tell you the comforts I feel in my soul: they are past expression! The consolations of God to such an unworthy wretch are so abundant, he leaves me nothing to pray for, but a continu∣ance of them. I enjoy an heaven already in my soul. My prayers are all converted into praise. Nevertheless, I do not forget that I am still in the body, and liable to all those distressing fears which are incident to human nature when under temptations, and without any sensible divine sup∣port. But so long as the presence of God conti∣nues with me in the degree I now enjoy it, I can∣not but think that such a desponding frame is im∣possible.</HI>" The nearer he drew to his decease, the more happy and heavenly he appeared in his spirit and conversation. Founded upon the rock Christ Jesus, and influenced with the Father's ever∣lasting love, he stands against the shock of mortal∣ity. The truth he preached to others, being the food and nourishment of his own soul, he now finds their sweetness to counterpoise the sorrows of the grave. Happy, unspeakably happy is that man, and especially that minister, who is thus di∣vinely taught and enriched by a God of all grace!
<PB N="109" REF="031228_0114_0FEB748CAEDD7B78"/>
The truth of Christ shall make them free from every fear, and safe conduct their feet through the shades of death; while the unhappy formalist, and self-taught professor, will tremble and sink beneath the prospect of immortality.</P>
<P>Not long before his exit Mr. Toplady exclaimed, "<HI>O how this soul of mine longs to be gone! like a bird imprisoned in a cage, it longs to take its flight. O that I had wings like a dove! then would I flee away to the realms of bliss, and be at rest forever!</HI>" Being asked by a friend, if he al∣ways enjoyed such comforts, he answered, "<HI>I can∣not say there are no intermissions; for if there were not, my consolations would be more and greater than I could possibly bear; but, when they abate, they leave such an abiding sense of God's goodness, and of the certainty of my being fixed upon the eternal rock of Christ Jesus, that my soul is still filled with peace and joy.</HI>" A little before his departure, he blessed God for continuing to him his understanding in clearness; but added, with a rapture,—"<HI>Most of all, his abiding presence, and the shining of his love upon my soul. The sky is clear; there is no cloud; come Lord Jesus, come quickly!</HI>" Soon after this he closed his eyes, the 11th of August, 1778, and found, as Milton ex∣presses it
<Q><PB N="110" REF="031228_0115_0FEB748E385B8168"/>
<L>— a death like sleep,</L>
<L>A gentle wafting to immortal life.</L></Q></P>
<P>The corpse of Mr. Toplady, agreeably to his own desire, was interred in <HI>Tottenham Court Cha∣pel,</HI> in a remarkably deep grave, in presence of a concourse of people. And, notwithstanding Mr. Toplady had frequently expressed his disapprobation of any funeral sermon being delivered on his death, yet the REVEREND ROWLAND HILL could not forbear ascending the pulpit at the interment, and made a very solemn and affectionate address to the thronged church.</P>

<HEAD>MORNING's INTERVIEW Between Deacon Ridly and Colonel Sharpless, New-Jersey.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO, so, Colonel, good morning; when did you return from York?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Last night, and had I not been so desperately jaded, I should have called upon you right away for a grain of comfort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what in the world is the matter with you, you look mighty poorly; come, sit down
<PB N="111" REF="031228_0116_0FEB74904521B880"/>
Colonel. Are markets low that make you feel so ugly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deacon, as old a man as you are you never heard the like in all your days; there is that great man Thomas Paine been writing against the <HI>bible,</HI> and a great many <HI>Yorkers</HI> take side with him, and if something is not done, they will all turn deists. Here, Deacon Ridly, is the book; do look at it; I bought it at Swords's, in Pearl-street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I will look at this mighty book. Molly, hand me your grand-mother's spec∣tacles. Perhaps, Colonel, you are more afraid than hurt. I guess you are mistaken about the folks in York; I have long thought many of them did not like the <HI>bible</HI> mighty well, and only wanted Tom Paine's fine French cloak to walk in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, Deacon, not quite so hard;—Paine reasons desperately indeed;—let me shew you this place. Ah! there it is, he strikes home at the root. (P. 13)—"Revelation, when applied to religion, means something communicated <HI>immediately</HI> from God to man. No one will deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communi∣cation if he pleases. But admitting for the sake of a case, that something has been revealed to a cer∣tain person, and not revealed to any other person, it is revelation to that person only. When he tells
<PB N="112" REF="031228_0117_0FEB7496CC4747B0"/>
it to a second person, a second to a third, and a third to a fourth, and so on, it ceases to be a reve∣lation to all those persons. It is a revelation to the first person only, and <HI>heresay</HI> to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it." Now Deacon, how am I to know whether the bible be a revelation of God or not—Is it <HI>heresay</HI> to me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so, let me see if I can't take this <HI>Tom Fox</HI> by the tail, and take off his firebrand. Do Colonel hand me that book on the shelf; 'tis <HI>Paine's Common Sense.</HI>—See here,— (p. 7.) On monarchy and hereditary succession, he quotes the scriptures, and says, <HI>it is worth attending to,</HI> and shews the origin, and succession of the kings of Israel; <HI>these portions of scripture,</HI> says he, <HI>are di∣rect and positive; they admit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to equivocal con∣struction</HI>; and then brings in the attestation of the Almighty in this case. Here Colonel, you see, to point his pen against KINGS, he gives full credit to the bible, as much as any <HI>parson</HI> in America; but when he got into France, he lost his "<HI>Common Sense,</HI>" and calls the bible a <HI>heresay.</HI> Thus you see Paine is either a <HI>believer</HI> or an <HI>unbeliever,</HI> as suits his own purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Deacon, I never saw you so merry in all my born days; I thought to be sure, you
<PB N="113" REF="031228_0118_0FEB749856A1BF38"/>
would have burst your eyes in tears! But look a little farther and you will see,—aye, there it is, (p. 50) how he talks about the Saviour having <HI>no learning,</HI> and that he could not <HI>write.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, so he does. Take the bible Colonel, and turn to John viii.6. and you will there see, <HI>Jesus stooped down and with his finger</HI> WROTE <HI>on the ground,</HI> when the accusers of the adultress were before him. But, see here Colonel, in the very same page, Paine says, "Jesus Christ called men to the practice of moral virtues, and the belief of one God," therefore, Jesus must have had the best sort of learning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Deacon. There is another place where he calls St. Paul a <HI>manufacturer of quibbles,</HI> (p. 54)—the book of Revelations is a <HI>riddle,</HI> (p. 32) and says <HI>the metaphor of a dishclout</HI> might have been introduced as a <HI>type,</HI> (p. 146.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paul was consistent in his writings, and not like Paine, in his Common Sense approving the Scripture, and in his Age of Reason denying it; therefore was no quibbler.—The Revelation may appear a riddle to Paine, simply because he had no eyes to read it, nor inclination to compare it with the successive events of time; and, as to the metaphor of a <HI>dishclout,</HI> if he had looked sharp, he would have found it already in Jeremiah. <HI>All our righte∣ousnesses
<PB N="114" REF="031228_0119_0FEB749A08434F88"/>
are as filthy rags,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lxiv.6.</NOTE> and if poor Tom had known his own heart, he would have found it in God's sight more filthy than the dirtiest dishclout ever handled by a scullion in his kitchen. However, Colonel, as Dr. Linn says, in his Sermon on the <HI>Times,</HI> "That book, which hath for so many ages stood the roaring of the lion, may well stand the braying of an ass."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paine also says that the Christian Church sprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology; and, Deacon, there are many things in scripture that look a little that way. (p. 17 and 97.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess, Colonel, this rather comes from Paine's <HI>head</HI> than the heathen's tail. Now, Colo∣nel, I wonder our <HI>dominies</HI> do not more explain these things to their people; but let that be as it may, if you compare the heathen mythology with the scripture, you will find that the heathen mythology is a corruption from the scripture; you know on man's expulsion from Paradise, God placed <HI>che∣rubims</HI> to guard the tree of life; and, no doubt, Cain being familiar therewith, he and his posterity, on their settlement, not fearing the true God, made gods of their own from that figure. The same cherubims were appointed in the Tabernacle of Moses; in the Temple of Solomon; and, mightily spoken of by
<PB N="115" REF="031228_0120_0FEB749D54674058"/>
Ezekiel: now, these cherubims, in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> answer to the <HI>elements of Nature</HI>; and when the tribes revolted under Jereboam, they carried the idea of these hieroglyphics among the heathen, and thus, in my opinion, <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and all the other heathen gods, were established and worshipped, as they all answer in their names and natures to the four faces of the cherubims, as you may see explained by the learned Mr. Parkhurst, in his Hebrew Lexicon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Deacon, you don't believe what Paine says?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think I am so foolish in my old age as to <HI>believe</HI> an <HI>unbeliever?</HI> No, no, let unbelievers credit one another if they please; were I to believe such, my reason and common sense might laugh in my face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What think you could induce that man to write such a book?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, Colonel; you know Paine was then in the clutches of the French Convention, many of whom were deists greater than himself; and, to recommend himself to their favour, and save his neck from Louis's cutting-knife, the <HI>gul∣lotine,</HI> I guess he wrote against the bible. Another reason why he wrote against the christian religion is, because he had none in himself; if he had known himself a sinner, he would have seen the necessity

The time, I believe, is not far distant, when truth and righteousness shall flourish among that people, and the pure doctrines of Christ shall arise upon the ruins of infidelity.

<HEAD>THE SLOTHFUL WORSHIPER ADMONISHED.</HEAD>
<P>FOR a professed christian to enter a place of pub∣lic worship when service is half performed, is attend∣ed with extreme disadvantages to himself, and many inconveniences to others; consequently merits friendly admonition.</P>
<P>Such a person, however, may reply, "better late than never;" but, on serious reflection, he must find his tardy steps expose him to severe reflection. Does he not give others leave to imagine he has indulged a bed of sloth, especially when on every other morning in the week he is known to be first at market, and the earliest at his business? Who can suppose he has had time for either family or closet Devotion; or if performed at all, it must have been in a bustle to get to Church before sermon. May not many steady worshippers imagine, that this slothful christian, however he may talk of loving sermons, can have little idea of the true worship of the great God, when he enters the door after pray∣er? Should he be equally late in his attendance in the afternoon, who but may imagine he has too freely eat at his table; or has taken a few glasses too many? This, however, is certain, no one has
<PB N="118" REF="031228_0123_0FEB74A6C8240F88"/>
reason to suppose his mind in a lively frame for re∣ligion; that he loves the habitation of the Almighty; feels a warm attachment to God's saints; or is a lover of prayer and praise.</P>
<P>This evil does not rest alone upon or with himself. What a bad example does he set his family, and others in the congregation, especially young persons, who need every stimulus to duty! What an interrup∣tion to public worship is it for a person to bounce in, and almost out of breath, to take his seat, while service is performed? And, what a discouragement is it to the minister to see so little fruit of his labour, and perhaps to be interrupted in his work by this negligent attendant, who catches the eye of every body in the church?</P>
<P>It is granted, that lawful, unavoidable obstruc∣tions may occur to prevent a person's timely atten∣dance on worship; where this is the real case, it will create the pain of disappointment in that breast which glows with ardour for Communion with God in his sanctuary; but it is to be feared, many, very many habitually neglect a due attendance on the house of the Lord, and need admonition to quicken their steps, which, if effected hereby, will answer the desired end of this paper.</P>

<HEAD>THE REFLECTION.</HEAD>
<P>AM I a sinner?—The conviction of my consci¦ence, the events of my life, and the law of my creation, confirm the solemn truth. Sin has pro∣duced in my breast unhallowed desires, deranged by mental powers, and debased my softer passions; it prepareth for my steps a thorny path, and creates a stubborn will, averse to all that's good. In vain I pass the busy scenes of life, or seek to drown my conscious sensibility among the sons of mirth: these enhance my pain in reflecting hours, and arm my pillow with thorns, more piercing than the poisoned arrow. I am amenable to HIM who made me. This, a conscience something, resi∣dent within, announces. And this I learn from the various scenes of life, and the passage of my fellow mortals, though against their will, to a state from which they never, never will return. Ah! my soul, every fleeting moment brings thee nearer to the fatal crisis, when thou, and all that's mortal, shalt bid adieu, and then to stand before thy Ma∣ker's august throne. But O!—this God is good, and mercy dwells with him. Yet, say my soul, this God is righteous too; nor can his goodness, nor his mercy, reach thee as a sinner, at expence
<PB N="120" REF="031228_0125_0FEB74AD20B42D58"/>
so dear as forfeiture of justice. If there be a God, immutable must be his attributes; nor one impeach or cross another. How then, as a sinner, canst thou hope to meet his smiles?—Sayest thou, revolve, repent; yet alas! who will pay the old arrear! Will repenting tears obliterate the awful debt I owe? But, should I say I will repent, can re∣pentance flow from a heart so hard and vile as mine? The terrors of my God forbid repentance; inflexi∣ble is his law, and exorable is his justice;—my guilty breast feels encrusted; my tears refuse to flow; nor can I find repentance, though by repen∣tance I should be saved. Whither then wouldst thou fly? Survey the stores of nature, if a victim can be found to satisfy thy God;—see, if among her choicest sweets, a balm so full of virtue can be found to make the whole. All, all is vain! "Shall I come before the Lord with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" These, alas! have no merit for human of∣fence; and the very offering of them would betray my folly and accumulate my guilt. What said Abraham to his son?—"God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering." Gen. xxii.8. The
<PB N="121" REF="031228_0126_0FEB74B3706B62C0"/>
gospel points me to that Lamb; God's co-equal, co-eternal Son—that Lamb, who was lead to the slaughter; bled beneath the stroke of justice; and whose atoning sacrifice is accepted by that God against whom my sins arise. Here then will I rest. On this rock of salvation will I cast my soul with all its guilt and cares. O thou bleeding, suffering dying Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world; wash me in thy precious blood, clothe me in thy justifying righteousness, and, by thy so∣vereign, efficacious grace, restore my heart, my life, my soul, to thy holy image! and when flesh and heart shall fail, be thou the strength of my life and my portion for ever.</P>

<HEAD>THE DOCTOR's MISTAKE.</HEAD>
<P>DR. D—'s besetting sin seems to have been an excess and laxness of complaisance. Being to preach one Sunday at a country town, where were two different churches, the one Calvinistic, the other Armenian, the Doctor provided himself with two sermons, as opposite in their plan as were the congregations to which he was to preach. When arrived at the place, he mounted the Calvinist pulpit in the morning. He gave out his text, and began
<PB N="122" REF="031228_0127_0FEB74B55B9998F8"/>
his discourse; but had not got far before he per∣ceived he had pulled out the wrong sermon. He could not, however, recede; but went through with it with much uneasiness to himself, and to the great dissatisfaction of his auditory. Having but two sermons with him, and knowing that many of his morning hearers would follow him to the other church in the afternoon, he was under the necessity of preaching his Calvinistic discourse to the Arme∣nian congregation, where he gave as much discon∣tent as he had done to the other before. The Doctor lamenting his mistake shortly after to an intimate friend, received this mortifying answer: "Never mind it, Sir, you only happened to put your hand in the wrong pocket."</P>

<P>After our conversation while riding on the Island, I sought a retired moment for prayer; but while bending my knees, a gloom overspread my mind;—my mouth was stopped;—I had no view of God, although my heart was filled with his ter∣rors. Arising from my knees, I was about to leave my chamber, and while my hat was in my hand, these words sensibly occurred to my thoughts, <HI>All thy children shall be taught of God, and great shall be the peace of thy children.</HI> Isa. liv.13. I immediately returned to prayer, and begged the Lord to teach me the knowledge of himself;—my mind expanded;—I saw, <HI>God was a just God, and yet a Saviour</HI>;—that Jesus had died for sinners,— for his very enemies. The love of Christ engaged my heart;—I wept;—I prayed. The voice of Jesus, saying, <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,</HI> Matt. xi.28. reached my heart;—I felt a willing∣ness to lay at his feet with my guilt and folly. I was persuaded that his blood could cleanse from all sin. When I arose from prayer, it seemed all my distress was gone. I wished the Lord would take charge of me, and that my body and soul might be

<HEAD>ON THE LOVE OF CHRIST. In a Letter to the Right Hon. Lady Frances Shirley, by the late Rev. James Hervey.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LADY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Saturday in the afternoon, I promised myself a singular pleasure, the pleasure of writing to your Ladyship; but was hindered from enjoying it, by company which could not be left, and my business which could not be postponed.</P>
<P>I think, my Lady, you have a note under my hand, for a few thoughts on <HI>The Love of</HI> CHRIST. How glad am I to pay, as far as my ability will reach, all my obligations to your Ladyship! espe∣cially when they are of a nature so peculiarly pleas∣ing. Shall we then consider</P>
<P>The <HI>original</HI> of his love? It is free; perfectly free; without any desert, or the least amiableness in us. We love our kind friends, and generous benefactors: those that are accomplished in them∣selves, or serviceable to our interests. But CHRIST loved us when we were <HI>sinners</HI>; when we were <HI>forgetful</HI> of him; nay, enemies to him, by evil tempers, and wicked works. He loved us, (O sovereign, most unmerited kindness!) when we de∣served
<PB N="132" REF="031228_0137_0FEB74D71E7E5DB0"/>
<HI>nothing,</HI> but utter abhorrence, and eternal vengeance.</P>
<P>The <HI>commencement</HI> of his love. His love is not of yesterday. His love, like his outgoings, is from everlasting. <HI>I have loved thee,</HI> says he to his church, <HI>with an everlasting love.</HI> We value the affection that is of long standing; has taken deep root; and still continues unshaken. <HI>How ex∣cellent, then, is thy loving kindness,</HI> O blessed JESUS! which, <HI>before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made,</HI> was fixed upon sinful dust! O! that we, my Lady, should be in the thoughts, be upon the very heart, of GOD's adorable Son, even from the ages of eternity?</P>
<P>The <HI>duration</HI> of his love. It is invariable and eternal. <HI>Having loved his own, he loveth them even unto the end.</HI> It neither began with time, neither will it end with time. As no worthiness in us caused it, so neither will our failings extinguish it; no, nor our infirmities damp it. We change frequently; our holy frames fail; but our adored Redeemer is the <HI>same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.</HI> Fear not then, my honoured Lady, <HI>neither life nor death, nor things present, nor things to come, nor any other creature, shall be able to se∣parate us from the</HI> ever tender, the ever constant, the ever triumphant <HI>love of</HI> GOD our Saviour!</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="031228_0138_0FEB74D8A8D13BE8"/>The <HI>effects</HI> of his love. It brought him from the heaven of heavens, to dwell in clay, and be lodged in a manger. It brought him from those happy mansions, where is the <HI>fulness of joy,</HI> and where <HI>are pleasures for evermore</HI>; to be <HI>destitute, afflicted, tormented</HI> in this vale of tears. O my Lady! it made him, who is heir of all things, not to have where to lay his head; till he was stretch∣ed on the Cross, and laid it in the gloom of the grave. Unparalleled and stupendous! <HI>Who can declare the noble acts of the</HI> Redeemer's love, <HI>or shew forth its praise?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>fruits</HI> of this love. To this is owing all the good we possess or expect; every spiritual and heavenly blessing. If our eyes are enlightened, in any degree, to see the things that belong to our peace: if our desires are awakened, to seek the <HI>inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away:</HI> for this we are indebted to the love and grace of CHRIST. If we are sanctified in part, and desirous to grow in true godliness: if we are perfectly justified before GOD, and adopt∣ed to be his sons and daughters: these also are streams, which issue from that inexhaustible foun∣tain, THE LOVE OF CHRIST. As it was stron∣ger than death, in its actings and sufferings; it is richer than all worlds in its precious, precious fruits.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="031228_0139_0FEB74DA5AFF3970"/>Justly, therefore, does the scripture make use of all the endearing relations, that subsist among mankind, to represent the love of CHRIST. Great is the love of a friend; greater the love of a brother; greater still the love of a parent; greatest of all the love of a bridegroom: but infinitely greater than any, than all, is the love of the ever blessed IMMANUEL to his people. When all has been said, all has been imagined; it transcends every comparison; it exceeds all thought; or, as St. Paul speaks, <HI>it passes knowledge.</HI>—May your Ladyship have more and more exalted apprehensions of it; and live under a delightful sense of its rich∣ness and perpetuity!—May it be your sweet incite∣ment to every duty, and your sovereign cordial under all tribulation!—And when eternity, the vast eternity opens, it shall be, in a sense that no heart can conceive, your crown of rejoicing; your exceeding great reward.—And, I hope, you will sometimes pray, that it may be the present comfort, and eternal joy of, my Lady, your Ladyship's much obliged, and most dutiful humble servant,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE late excellent and reverend Mr. James Hervey, Rector of Weston Flavel, being one day on a journey, a lady who happened to be in the same carriage with him, was expatiating in a very particular manner on the amusements of the stage, as being, in her esteem, superior to any other plea∣sures. Among other things she said, "There was the pleasure of thinking on the play before she went, the pleasure she enjoyed when there, and the pleasure of ruminating upon it when on her bed at night." Mr. Hervey, (who sat and heard her discourse without interrupting her) when she had concluded, said to her, that there was one pleasure more besides what she had mentioned that she had forgot. "What can that be?" said she, "for sure I have included every pleasure, when I have con∣sidered the enjoyment before hand—at the time— and afterwards. Pray, Sir, what is it?" To which Mr. Hervey, with a grave look, and in a manner peculiarly amiable to himself, answered, "Madam, the pleasure that it will give you on your DEATH-BED."
<PB N="136" REF="031228_0141_0FEB74E3E0A68928"/>
A clap of thunder, or a flash of lightning could not have struck her with more surprize. The stroke went to her very heart, and she had not one word to say, but seemed quite occupied in thinking upon it. In short, the consequence of that well-timed word was, that she never went any more to the play-house, but became a pious woman, and a follower of those pleasures which would afford her true satisfaction on her death-bed.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LOVE to God is the essence of personal reli∣gion; without it the most splendid profession is un∣satisfying and vain. It will be our attempt in this essay to explain the principles on which God has
<PB N="146" REF="031228_0151_0FEB7502B01956D8"/>
a right to demand our affections, and the felicity of that man who loves the Lord with all his heart.</P>
<P N="1">I. From the natural relation which subsists be∣tween God and the creature, he has a right to de∣mand our affections. When the Almighty form∣ed man, he enriched his soul with a propensity to love; and upon the exercise of this passion the basis of human happiness was formed. Love is the most sensible, operative, visible passion of the human soul, and leads every other in its train; in the exercise of this our first parents, in their primeval state, grasped the vision of JEHOVAH, as the God of universal Nature, and thereby experienced the most inconceivable delight. This claim is consist∣ent with the honour of God, and the interest of his creature, and is supported by an holy and an inflexible <HI>law</HI>; the tenor of which is, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.</HI> Deut. vi.4, 5. Adam, in Paradise, did thus love the Lord his God; but, on the entrance of sin, the know∣ledge of God was turned into darkness, the affec∣tions were contaminated, enmity reared its baneful head, and man fled with precipitation from the voice of his Maker. Nor was this change in Adam's heart peculiar to him alone—by his <HI>disobedience many were made sinners.</HI> Rom. v.19. <HI>The carnal
<PB N="147" REF="031228_0152_0FEB7504434D2760"/>
mind is enmity against God; it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> Rom. viii.7. Jesus said unto the Jews, <HI>I know ye that ye have not the love of God in you.</HI> John v.42. Thus, although man be under a natural and moral obligation to love God, and the divine right to the creature's affections still abides, the fact is too stubborn to be denied, that mankind, universally so by nature, <HI>are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.</HI> 2 Tim. iii.4. Let the reader apply this to his own heart, and ask, "Have I loved the Lord with all my heart, with all my soul, and with all my strength?" Surely he has not. This view of human nature calls for deep humiliation. Not to love God is to be destitute of a pure fountain of happiness, and to be exposed to the awful pe∣nalty of death, annexed to the law of our Sove∣reign. Glory be to God, that GRACE has restor∣ed what NATURE lost! Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. God claims the affections of his people from the principle of their ADOPTION to HIMSELF in CHRIST JESUS flowing from the good pleasure of his will. Eph. i.5. This, though unintelligible to nature, is the grand theme of revelation, and is the only way in which the depraved sinner can be brought to love the Lord with delight. It was the act of the FATHER to adopt; JESUS engaged to
<PB N="148" REF="031228_0153_0FEB750768D677C0"/>
assume our nature, bear our sins, magnify the law of love which we had violated, atone for sin by the shedding of his blood, and prove our adoption in HIMSELF worthy the attributes of JEHOVAH. The SPIRIT of ADOPTION, in the fulness of time, is sent into the conscience of a redeemed sin∣ner, shews him his condemnation for sin, testifies of Christ as a complete Saviour, sheds abroad the love of God in his heart, and enables him to ap∣proach and enjoy God as his father. Gal. iv. 4—6. Rom. v. 5. How different is the state and sensi∣bility of such a man to what they were! The en∣mity of his heart is slain; he feels the force of re∣conciliation to God, and enjoys peace in his con∣science; he neither boasts of loving God upon the principles of nature, nor cavils at adopting grace, but exults in the everlasting, distinguishing love of FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT to him; by which he is brought to know and feel the sweets of loving God. He that enjoys but the smallest degree of love to God, though he may not to be able to re∣cite any remarkable circumstances in his conver∣sion, is able to tell you that there was a time when he did not know nor love God; and what little he now enjoys is the fruit of great grace. Thus, <HI>we love</HI> GOD <HI>because he first loved us,</HI> sent his SON to die for us, and then gave us his SPIRIT, to
<PB N="149" REF="031228_0154_0FEB750DC1D14948"/>
unite our hearts in love to himself, bearing testi∣mony that unless God had thus loved us we never should have been restored to enjoy the sweets of love to him. To this we add,</P>
<P N="3">III. GOD, as the REDEEMER of his people, has a right to their affections, from their personal surrender of themselves to him, as the fruit of his own grace. That heart which reviews its own native wretchedness by transgression, contemplates the boundless love of God in his salvation, and is brought nigh, by the blood of CHRIST, to enjoy the smiles of the EVERLASTING FATHER, re∣members that <HI>he is not his own, but bought with a price.</HI> He approaches the Lord by faith and prayer, and adopts the language of David: <HI>Into thine hand I commit my spirit, for thou hast re∣deemed me, O Lord God of truth.</HI> Ps. xxxi.5. In the retired chamber, at the water of baptism, at the gates of Zion, and at the table of the Lord, the Christian, in lively emotions of heart, resigns himself to be the Lord's for ever: No part of re∣vealed truth but he receives in the love of it; no command which dropped from his Saviour's lips, whether for private or public obedience, but is em∣braced with affection; no cross, no suffering, but what he cheerfully welcomes; knowing that the many waters of affliction cannot quench the flame
<PB N="150" REF="031228_0155_0FEB750FA2C79C38"/>
of his love to God, neither can the floods of temp∣tation drown it. Sol. Song viii. 7. For the truth of these observations I appeal to the scriptures, and to the experience of the Christian reader. You have not repented giving your hand and heart to HIM who bought you with his blood. From the principle of your surrender to God he addresses you, <HI>My son, give me thine heart.</HI> Prov. xxiii.26. This claim is founded upon your <HI>sonship,</HI> and is supported by God's endearing relation to you as your <HI>father</HI> in <HI>Christ.</HI> Frequently, in duty and in trial, in pro∣vidence and in conscience, Christ addresses you in his language to Peter, <HI>Lovest thou me more than these?</HI> John xxi. 15—17. As the High Priest un∣der the law bore the names of the Hebrew tribes upon his breast-plate, so Jesus, the great HIGH PRIEST of our profession, bears his people upon his heart; and by the methods of his grace he makes them to enjoy the comfort of that privilege, and then claims their hearts for himself.</P>
<P>Let us now take these three parts of our subject, and view them as containing the principles of <HI>na∣tural</HI> and <HI>revealed</HI> religion. On the principles of <HI>adopting grace,</HI> the obligation of <HI>nature's law</HI> is not annihilated, but established. <HI>Grace</HI> restores what <HI>nature</HI> lost by sin. Though the honours of nature are restored by the obedience of Christ, and
<PB N="151" REF="031228_0156_0FEB7511332AE850"/>
our affections claimed by the Lord, remember it is by the display of adopting grace alone. You be∣hold God not as Creator only, but in the new, eternal relation of your Father in Christ. You never can be too well established in this important truth. Not viewing the believer's love, as flowing from his <HI>adoption,</HI> is the principal cause of blend∣ing law and gospel, nature and grace, obligation and privilege, together; and, from this almost every other error proceeds. By the gospel your obedi∣ence is directed into a new channel, and flows from the precious love of Christ: you are actuated by new motives, have new sources opened for your perseverance in holy obedience, and a sure and cer∣tain prospect of <HI>receiving the end of your faith, in the final salvation of your soul.</HI> 1 Pet. i.9.</P>
<P><HI>Let them,</HI> said Deborah, <HI>that love the Lord, be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.</HI> Judges v.31. How pleasing the emblem to de∣scribe the happiness of that man who loves the Lord with all his heart! like the SUN in the fir∣mament, he stands a monument of JEHOVAH's wisdom and almighty power! As at the brightness of the <HI>sun</HI> the <HI>stars</HI> withdraw their light, so the redeemed of the Lord, washed in the blood of the Lamb, cloathed with the immaculate righteousness of the God-man Christ Jesus, and replenished with
<PB N="152" REF="031228_0157_0FEB75145EE5F150"/>
his everlasting love, outvies the formal moralist in pure obedience, and eventually he shall outshine the angels in the height of glory above!—As the SUN pursues his course, and <HI>rejoices as a strong man to run a race,</HI> though storm and tempest fill the sky; so the man that loves the Lord shall per∣severe through the raging tempests produced by earth and hell; and the black clouds of affliction which surround him, shall only tend to make him shine the brighter!—Not as an idle spectator the SUN is placed in the centre of the mundane system, but governing the surrounding <HI>planets,</HI> while his bright beams pierce through all the skies; like the man who loves the Lord, placed in society, diffu∣ses his knowledge, candour, truth, benevolence, and zeal, for the happiness of all around!—In one instance, however, the emblem fails. The period will arrive when that great source of light and heat shall set to rise no more, and be lost amidst the wreck of nature: But <HI>the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father, for ever and ever.</HI> Mat. xiii.43.</P>

<HEAD>THE FIGHTING PRELATE.</HEAD>
<P>KING Richard I. in one of his battles with the French, took Philip de Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais, prisoner. The Pope interceded for his liberty, in a letter, wherein he stiled the fighting Bishop <HI>his dearly beloved son.</HI> The King, by way of answer, sent the Bishop's suit of armour, stained with blood and covered with dust, to the Pope, and asked him, <HI>whether he knew his son's coat or no?</HI> The Pope was ashamed at the fight, and left the Bishop to <HI>Richard's</HI> mercy.—A lesson this to POLITICAL CLERGY, to turn their attention wholly to their Master's kingdom, which is not of this world, and to be persuaded, that God can govern the nations of the earth without their aid.</P>

<HEAD>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REGENERA∣TION AND CONVERSION.</HEAD>
<P>REGENERATION is the ACT of God, as <HI>the God of all grace,</HI> turning to the sinner, who, by nature, is <HI>dead in trespasses and sins—quick∣ening</HI> the conscience—forming a principle of spiri∣tual
<PB N="154" REF="031228_0159_0FEB751C7AFEEF90"/>
life, with all its habits, separate, and as distinct from <HI>the old body of sin,</HI> as the soul itself is from the animal body. Titus iii.5. Eph. ii.1. John iii.6. 1 John iii.9. The <HI>Image</HI> of God is formed upon this <HI>new creature,</HI> in embryo, as much as the hu∣man foetus possesses all the habits, parts, and passions of man. Eph. iv.24. Col. iii.10. Rom. viii.29. Power, unfelt before, is now experienced—a con∣flict commences in the conscience, between this <HI>new life</HI> and the <HI>body of sin</HI>—a desire is produced, accompanied with an ability to turn unto God as the fountain of mercy, and to enjoy the light, the exercise, and the pleasures, connected with a spiri∣tual state of existence. Ps. cxvi.4. Acts ix.6.</P>
<P>CONVERSION is the spiritual deliverance of a soul from a state of regeneration, and is therefore called a birth. John iii.3—5. It is the motion of the living soul turning to God; and the exertion of spiritual life embracing God, as he is revealed in the scriptures, as the believer's happy portion in Christ Jesus, as much as by natural instinct the new-born infant applies for sustenance to its mother's breast. Jer. xxxi.18. Sam. iii.24. Now, the Image of God is displayed in obedience; and life becomes sensibly evident in the exercise of all its faculties. Gal. v.22. Therefore, he that is <HI>regenerated</HI> shall, in due time, be <HI>converted</HI> to a life of happiness in

<HEAD>ANECDOTE OF THE LATE KING OF SWEDEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE late King of Sweden was, it seems, un∣der great impressions of spiritual religion for some time before his death. A peasant being once, on a
<PB N="156" REF="031228_0161_0FEB75246F917998"/>
particular occasion, admitted to his presence; the King knowing him to be a person of singular piety, asked him "What he took to be the true nature of <HI>faith?</HI>" The peasant entered deeply into the subject, and much to the King's comfort and satis∣faction. The King at last, lying on his death-bed, had a return of his doubts and fears, as to the safety of his soul; and still the same question was perpe∣tually in his mouth to those about him, "What is real <HI>faith?</HI>" His attendants advised him to send for the Archbishop of <HI>Upsall</HI>; who, coming to the King's bed-side, began, in a learned, logical manner, to enter into the scholastic Definition of Faith—The Prelate's Disquisition lasted an hour. When he had done, the King said, with much ener∣gy, "All this is ingenious but not comfortable; 'tis not what I want—Nothing, after all, but the Far∣mer's Faith will do for <HI>me.</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>QUESTIONS NECESSARY FOR MINISTERS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. ARE my motives for the Gospel Ministry of a sinister nature, either seeking the support, or en∣riching myself or family? for it is recorded, some <HI>take the oversight of the flock for filthy luere

sake</HI>; and others cry, <HI>Put me into the Priest's office, I pray thee, that I may eat a piece of bread.</HI> 1 Pet. v.2. 1 Sam. ii.36.</P>
<P N="2">II. Am I assured that God hath called me by his grace—changed my naturally depraved heart, and, by his word and Spirit, introduced me to the privileges of his believing family? Unless I am called as a Christian, I have no warrant to believe that I am called as a Minister of God. Gal. i.15, 16. 2 Cor. iv.5—7.</P>
<P N="3">III. When first I entered the ministry, were I deeply impressed with a sense of human misery, the virtues of the cross of Christ, and an anxious desire for the conversion of sinners? And have these important truths increased in my estimation, and been operative on my heart to the present mo∣ment? 2 Cor. v.11, 12, 20.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Am I conscious that it is only by the influ∣ence of the Holy Spirit that my labours can be made effica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous to men? That, although the ministry be my <HI>duty,</HI> the holy <HI>work</HI> on souls is God's? And in consequence of which, do I ha∣bitually feel myself as clay in the hand of the pot∣ter, and as a pen in the hand of a ready writer, that God alone may be exalted in his own service? 2 Tim. iv.17. Phil. iv.13.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="158" REF="031228_0163_0FEB7527AC7DE480"/>V. Am I conscious that I am not as those who corrupt the word of God, handle it deceitfully, and walk in craftiness; but renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, and, by manifestation of the truth, commend myself to every man's conscience in the sight of God? And, in my duty, as a minister, do I persevere, regardless either of the smiles or the frowns of men, and study to approve myself unto Christ, my sovereign Lord and only Master? 2 Cor. ii.17.iv.1, 2. 2 Tim. ii.14. Acts xx.14.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Is it my daily delight to maintain commu∣nion with God as the center of my mercy, my joy, and my home? And is it there that I receive my message for the flock, and beg that the truth I con∣vey to others may distil as the dew upon my own soul; thus feeding the people with that sacred food of which I myself have handled, felt, tasted, eaten, and digested in my own soul? Jonah iii.2. 1 John i.1, 2.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Do I with confidence look forward to that solemn day when I must give an account of my stewardship, meet the souls who were committed to my care, and expect an admission to the eternal mansions of glory? 2 Cor. v.10. Heb. xiii.17. Acts xx.24.</P>

<HEAD>A SINGULAR INSTANCE OF CONVERSION.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Mary Gurnee, now of New-York, was a person, like too many others, who lived a life of disobedience, without the knowledge of God, or hope in Christ. Immediately on the delivery of her fourth child, it was seized with violent fits; and as it lay at its mother's side, with its eyes darted upward and its hands clenched, the mother, while beholding the child's agony, said, <HI>Can it be pray∣ing?</HI> No, thought she, it has no sin of its own to pray for. Instantly a thought darted to her mind, swift as the lightning from the east,—<HI>The child is praying for its ungodly mother, that never yet prayed for herself!</HI> In a few hours the child died. The conviction of disobedience and guilt, however, lived within the mother's breast, and pro∣duced a visible reformation of life. Some time after she obtained a sense of pardon in the blood of the Lamb, and for several years since has walked worthy of her christian profession.</P>
<P>How wonderful are the ways of the Almighty! and how rich his grace to sinners! Mrs. G. could not read:—The child must be born, however short, to live long enough to be the silent bearer of a so∣lemn

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the past experience of my life, I have found, my child, that the choice of books were as cautiously to be selected as our compa∣nions; and, that they have an equal tendency, either to vitiate the mind, or mend the heart. However new or alluring the publication, I have always found in those novels a golden bait, suited to the youthful breast, and which diffuses the baneful poison of dissipation; and, as those volumes are
<PB N="162" REF="031228_0167_0FEB753632AEAF88"/>
generally formed from fiction, there are books of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>refinement,</HI> more worthy of your peru∣sal; a list of which I will write you at my leisure. But, Eliza, you perfectly misunderstood me, when I recommended to you the study of domestic life. I know your competency in needle-work; but, should you live, and be favoured with a virtuous husband, he will certainly expect something more from you than simply making him a shirt. With such a qualification only I do not think a woman worth a prudent man's acceptance; nor would such an one cut a very good figure in a family. It is not only necessary for a mother to set at her table, and partake of an agreeable repast with her chil∣dren, or her friends, but she should know the pre∣paration of every dish that may be placed upon it.</P>

<P>To make and receive visits are highly necessary for young persons, when properly select∣ed and virtuously conducted: nor do I wish, my daughter, that, on your return from the boarding-school, you should find a prison in your father's house. Mrs. Gay's mode of introducing her daughters into life may make them fine ladies, but cannot make them good wives or valuable mothers; nor can such a domestic education, if such it may be called, promise any real benefits to society.— Your expectations, like the young ladies you just named, may be placed upon the gift of a fortune by your father: but, my child, Providence, by va∣rious viciffitudes, may deprive your parent of an ability to gratify you. In such a case, it will be my ambition, that you be mistress of that know∣ledge, prudence, and industry, that may recom∣mend you to public attention.

<P>By leave of the Almighty arise at six in the morning in summer, and at seven in winter: in∣stantly on being dressed read a psalm, and as God may help you, acknowledge, by prayer, the pro∣tection of his hand through the night, and beseech his smiles through the day. Now, adjust your chamber, nor suffer one article, from the <HI>bed</HI> to the <HI>floor,</HI> to escape your attention; then, if you chuse, as the weather may permit, take a turn in the gar∣den, employ your needle, or read a few passages in a profitable volume.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock, as usual, you will wait on your father for family prayer;—eat your breakfast with cheerfulness and gratitude, and then you shall receive from my hand a <HI>bill of fare</HI> for dinner. With this—</P>
<P>You will enter the kitchen; address the servants, not as beneath your notice, nor as your equals; but with that pleasing affability which may at once gain you their attention and esteem. Carefully

observe the necessary preparations, mark every procedure, examine the nature and qualities of every article for the table—the manner and the time of dressing;—nor stand as spectator only; ac∣cording to your ability put your hand to the paste, the jellies, or the soups, that on any neglect or change of servants, you may gratify your father's table with a supply.—Should any tradesmen enter the kitchen, while you are present, conduct towards them with all courtesy, least they should imagine pride to have been your acquisition at the boarding-school. To assist you in the kitchen, you shall receive from me an excellent volume on the art of cookery.</P>
<P>Now, you may retire to your chamber, ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge your apparel, and be ready for the table.</P>
<P>After dinner, there are so many innocent, useful, pleasing ways for improving your time, I can scarce give you a full enumeration;—reading, mu∣sic, drawing, writing, needle-work, walking, visit∣ing. Among the many pleasing employments, however new, I must recommend you one, taught me by my pious, honoured father. We are, my child, surrounded with many honest, industrious poor; these, on every slight indisposition of their families, are unable to employ a physician's aid. Although I do not expect you to study, or be a
<PB N="166" REF="031228_0171_0FEB75432880C258"/>
proficient in <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> I wish you to study the nature and utility of those common, simple me∣dicines, suited to the ordinary complaints of human nature; nor need I mention those more incident to your own sex. I will offer you my assistance in this undertaking, and give you leave to prepare for your closet an assortment of such jellies as the poor are unable to provide; and in the distribution of these, you will be productive of more advantage to others, and create more sublime satisfaction, than in reading Tom Jones, the Arabian Night's Enter∣tainment, or passing the rounds of dissipation.</P>
<P>As I wish you to commence my <HI>house-keeper,</HI> I shall, on a Monday, give you such a portion of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey as may answer the tradesmen's demand the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g week; the expenditures of which you will accurately enter every evening, and make a final settlement with me on the Saturday. This will have a tendency to lead you into the knowledge of the markets, and preserve you in the habit of writ∣ing and arithmetic; while it will afford me a desir∣able opportunity to present you with such <HI>tokens</HI> of my approbation, as your attention and my af∣fection may dictate.</P>
<P>The employments of your evenings will be va∣rious: your father and myself will be often de∣lighted
<PB N="167" REF="031228_0172_0FEB7544CDC9C518"/>
by your conversation, reading, and practice of music.</P>
<P>After your father has discharged the duties of the evening, and by prayer committed his family to the protection of the Almighty, you can retire to your chamber, where, after adjusting your apparel with neatness and care, you will, I hope, commit your∣self, by prayer, into the hand of that God who alone must prove the guide of your youth and the strength of your growing years.</P>

<P>ANOTHER week unfolds its busy scenes! Yet, in wisdom are its events concealed; nor dare I once presume to search the secret will of God. Enough, my God is wise—he cannot err.

Let me then resolve, resolve with patience, to run the race now set be∣fore me, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith. O! let the recollection of that rich plenitude of goodness, hitherto attendant on my path, prompt me to advance; for as my day, my strength shall be. How animated in this resolve, from the pleasures yesterday derived from the Lord on Zion's holy hill! There God was known as a sure re∣fuge; and there I beheld the beauties of my Sa∣viour, and triumphed in his love! Preserved through the dangers of the night, to behold another rising sun, what gratitude is due to my almighty Lord! O! let them deeply impress my heart, and prompt my soul afresh to walk with God. Come, blessed Saviour; whatever may now await my steps, do thou afford thy friendly aid, and grant thy sweetest smiles! Trusting to myself, I shall surely err, wander from thy embraces, and deeply wound my heart. Ten thousand snares await without, while ten thousand greater evils lurk within my breast, to tempt my feet in paths of guilt. O thou Keeper of Israel! into thine arms I commit my soul.

</FIGURE> THE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fox, in Greek <HI>Alopex,</HI> in Hebrew <HI>Shual,</HI> is an animal of the dog kind, much resembling the common dog in form, and of the size of the spa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iel. It differs, however, from the common dog in the length, dense disposition, and softness of the hairs, especially those about its tail, which is bushy, and much admired by the animal itself, and in cold weather wrapped round his nose; and in its smell, which is peculiarly rank and offensive. It is said,
<PB N="174" REF="031228_0179_0FEB755D0AB0CD18"/>
that the fox makes use of its urine, which is re∣markably foeted, to force the cleanly badger from its habitation, and takes possession of it for him∣self. Its usual colour is a reddish tawny, though it is sometimes found white, and sometimes black. Its manner of digging itself a hole in the earth is also a custom wholly different from all the dog kind; and it is far from the tameness of that ani∣mal, being with difficulty made to lose its fierceness. Of all animals the fox has the most significant <HI>eye,</HI> by which it expresses every passion of love, fear, hatred, &amp;c. The fox is a crafty, lively, libidinous animal; it breeds only once a year, unless some ac∣cident befals its first litter, and brings four or five young, which, like puppies, are born blind. They are distinguished by different names: the <HI>greyhound fox</HI> is the largest, tallest, and boldest, and will attack a grown sheep or wether: the <HI>mastiff fox</HI> is less, but more strongly built: the <HI>cur fox</HI> is the least, lurks about hedges and out-houses, and is the most pernicious to the feathered tribe. The first of these has a white tip to the tail; the last a black. The skin of this animal is furnished with a soft and warm fur, which is frequently used to make muffs, &amp;c. The fox in the first year is called a <HI>cub</HI>; in the second a <HI>fox</HI>; and afterwards an <HI>old fox.</HI> It is a beast of chace, usually very prejudicial to the hus∣bandman,
<PB N="175" REF="031228_0180_0FEB755E9582CE30"/>
by taking away and destroying his lambs, geese, and poultry; but in vineyards he commits the greatest devastation, by eating the grapes and destroying the vines. His sagacity and genius for stratagem is peculiarly observable in his plunders. He is fond of honey; and as the wasps and bees fasten on his skin, he either drowns them in water, or crushes them to death by rolling on the ground, till they are forced to leave him in unmolested pos∣session of their cells. The very fretful porcupine, in the expansion of its prickles, he wearies out, by his artful and teazing tricks, and then kills and eats him. When pinched with hunger, he indiscrimi∣nately feeds on quadrupeds, fowls, fishes, and veget∣ables; nothing comes amiss to him. The common way to catch him is by gins, which being baited, and a train made by drawing raw flesh across his usual paths or haunts to the gin, it proves an in∣ducement to lure him to the place of destruction. He is sometimes taken by hunting, of which sport the dogs are extremely fond, though it often proves very offensive to the nose of the huntsman. This creature, on being pursued, shews astonishing powers of running, turning, winding, fighting, and eluding the hounds, often urining upon his tale, to strike his pursuers in the face; and when he finds himself without farther resource, he boldly faces

<P>HOW remarkable is it, that such a creature as the fox, so fly, even to a proverb, so filthy in his na∣ture, and so destructive in his life, should be favour∣ed with such peculiar instinct, as to provide him∣self with so commodious and secure an habitation! Yet, infinitely more remarkable, and which claims our highest astonishment, JESUS, the SON OF GOD, whose heart was replete with love, and whose hands were filled with beneficence to perishing men, that the ADORABLE LORD, PROPRIETOR of heaven and earth, so emptied himself, and submitted to so deep a state of poverty, as to compel him to say to the enquiring scribe, <HI>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man hath no where to lay his head.</HI> Matt. viii.20 — Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Jesus left the habitation of his glory, to rescue me from the den of the damned: he denied himself an habitation on earth, that he might grant me a mansion in heaven!</P>
<P>JESUS, the true judge of human nature, com∣pared <HI>Herod,</HI> who sought his life, to a <HI>fox,</HI> [Luke xiii. 32.] cruel, crafty, bold in rapine. Such are all those who wickedly hate the sheep of Christ's
<PB N="177" REF="031228_0182_0FEB756824E8DA40"/>
flock; whose crooked, irregular paths of disobe∣dience expose them to the curse of God's law; whose filthy nature, by sin, is not changed by grace to serve the Lord in pleasurable obedience.—A man may have the splendour of a <HI>Herod,</HI> but if not changed by grace, he is but a filthy fox still.</P>
<P>The <HI>foxes,</HI> and the <HI>little foxes,</HI> who spoil the vines with tender grapes, recorded in 2 Sol. Song. xv. may intend those false <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Professors</HI> who creep under the fence of God's vineyard, the Church, to disturb and destroy the ungodly. How fly, malignant, voracious, deceitful, and abominably filthy are these! Ezek. xiii. 4. Prov. 30. 12. They walk in craftiness, use good words and fair speeches, whereby they deceive the hearts of the simple. These foxes should be <HI>taken</HI>—detected in their first efforts—drove from the vineyard; not burned with <HI>fire and faggot,</HI> but <HI>taken</HI> by prayer to that God who can change the <HI>fox</HI> into a <HI>lamb.</HI> Wherever, and as long as God hath a vine of grace in the vineyard of his church, a <HI>cub fox,</HI> a <HI>grown fox,</HI> or an <HI>old fox</HI> will long for the grapes.</P>

<HEAD>OBITUARY.</HEAD>
<P>APRIL 15, 1796, departed this life Mrs. ELI∣ZABETH HARRIOT HAMILTON, an ACTRESS on the STAGE in New-York.—<HI>Presuming the circumstances attending this lady's death may be interesting to the reader, and as the</HI> EDITOR <HI>carefully preserved minutes of the conversation he had with her, they are now made public.</HI></P>
<P>On invitation, I visited Mrs. Hamilton, with whom I had an acquaintance for several years: entering her chamber she thus addressed me:—<HI>Sir, never was I more happy to see any one than your∣self. This with me is a period of distress. I sink fast into mortality. O what a dark gulph appears before me! My soul hath no hope; no, not one ray of light to cheer my passage to eternity. The physician tells me he can do no more.</HI> Then, said I, you need something to bear you above all that's mortal. <HI>O!</HI> replied she, <HI>I do, I do, indeed! O that I could with Barnwell say,</HI> 'I FIND A POWER WITHIN, THAT BEARS MY SOUL ABOVE THE FEARS OF DEATH, AND, SPITE OF CONSCIOUS SHAME AND GUILT, GIVES ME A
<PB N="186" REF="031228_0191_0FEB7583D2632F10"/>
TASTE OF PLEASURES MORE THAN MORTAL.' G. Barnwell, Act 5. <HI>How many times has that play been recited, while the heart was a stranger to the subject! But, I feel my need of mercy to bear my guilty soul through death, and fit me for the skies!</HI> After reciting to her the fulness of Christ, his ability to save, and the consolations with which, even now, he could bless her, I prayed with her, and was about to take my leave, when she grasped my hand, and with flowing tears urged me to repeat my visit:—<HI>O Sir, who knows—God may make you an instrument to save my guilty soul!</HI> Assuring her that salvation was alone to be found in Christ, and that it was the office of his Spirit to reveal it to her heart, I left her chamber.</P>
<P>On my second visit, interrogating her on the state of her mind, she replied, <HI>My mind</HI> 'IS ILL AT EASE.' <HI>O that I had one glimpse of hope! Darkness covers my mind, and I feel more than adamantine hardness within my guilty heart. What a dreadful thing is it to be on the precipice of eternity, to know the gospel, and not to feel it! The religious education I received from my pa∣rents, who were attendants at the late Dr. Ma∣son's church in this city, now reproves my soul, and covers me with shame. Were I restored to perfect health, and possessed the wealth of ten
<PB N="187" REF="031228_0192_0FEB758572D52B18"/>
thousand globes, with one smile from God I would wish to depart from this scene of woe. Although,</HI> continued she, <HI>my companions who tread the stage are not, perhaps, more wicked than others, yet our employ is a path of temptation that precludes almost a thought for immortality. Many excel∣lent morals are set us in the compositions we per∣form, but they are diverted from our hearts. We seldom enjoy the sabbath. On a Saturday we often play; fatigued on the sabbath, we have no ability for devotion, and are frequently obliged to learn for future play. Thus absorbed, my soul has been most grossly neglected. Should I be raised again from this bed, having one smile from God, I would sooner beg my bread than tread the stage again—Yes, the most menial employ shall rather fill my days, than I pursue a path so big with sor∣row at the end! —I cannot but wish, if I should be raised to health, as life from the dead, that my future days may be employed in adoration of my deliverer. Yet, for life am I not anxious. Not as I will, but as thou wilt, O blessed Sa∣viour! Only grant me one smile from Thee, I am content to live or die. Could this heart arise to God—could this soul enjoy liberty with heaven, I should not fear to die.</HI> Disclosing this sensibility of mind, I more fully explained to her the fulness
<PB N="188" REF="031228_0193_0FEAF869D73498F8"/>
and freeness of salvation, in the person, blood, and righteousness of the Son of God; to be known and enjoyed only by the teaching of the Holy Spirit;— that sinners, like herself, the vilest sinners, sensible of their need of mercy, are encouraged, by the promises of God, to hope for that invaluable bles∣sing. This salvation is worthy a God to provide, and necessary for a sinner to receive for everlasting happiness.—To this she listened with that solemn, eager attention, that it may be said, "her soul was in her eyes." <HI>Ah!</HI> said she, <HI>this suits my case, and encourages my hope.</HI></P>
<P>On my next visit she addressed me, <HI>Sir, my mind is as the ocean, after agitated by tempest, and cast into rooling billows, now begins to settle into a calm—I feel much composed—Numberless pas∣sages of scripture occur to my thoughts; yes, Sir, to my guilt and shame I speak it, many promises now occur, which have not passed my mind for many years, and seem to draw my discomposed heart into a calm.</HI>—"What a mercy is it," said I, "that God should reveal to us such promises in his word! How ungenerous those who, by ridicule, would deprive us of that sacred volume! But, my friend, what passages have afforded you relief?"— <HI>True, Sir, replied she, were the Bible untrue, or removed from me, what could encourage my
<PB N="189" REF="031228_0194_0FEB758D624479E8"/>
guilty soul that I should meet with a pardon from my Judge! nothing but deep despair would hover before my eyes. That passage in Lam.</HI> iii. 21, 22. <HI>much encourages me.</HI> THIS I RECALL TO MIND, THEREFORE HAVE I HOPE. IT IS OF THE LORD'S MERCIES THAT WE ARE NOT CON∣SUMED, BECAUSE HIS COMPASSION FAIL NOT. <HI>But particularly Isa.</HI> i.18. COME NOW AND LET US REASON TOGETHER, SAITH THE LORD; THOUGH YOUR SINS BE AS SCARLET, THEY SHALL BE AS WHITE AS SNOW; THOUGH THEY BE RED LIKE CRIMSON, THEY SHALL BE AS WOOL. <HI>These scriptures suit my state, and give me some prospect of mercy. The relief they have afforded me these forty-eight last hours, is indescribable. O that Jesus would grant me one smile, however faint; it would be worth more to me than millions of worlds! By thinking upon the parable of the unjust judge, who heard the widow's cry, and our Lord's improvement upon it, I am encouraged that he will hear me also. You know, Sir, there is a</HI> DOOR, TO HIM THAT KNOCKETH IT SHALL BE OPENED, AND WHOSOEVER SEEKETH, SHALL FIND.</P>
<P>On my next visit I found her mind much dis∣composed; the cause of which was the recollection of the following circumstance:—While in the
<PB N="190" REF="031228_0195_0FEB7590DF060C10"/>
West-Indies, she was persuaded, by an Episcopal clergyman, to receive the Lord's Supper, which, said she, was <HI>without knowledge and faith in Christ, or real love to Him</HI>; and which, she concluded, ranked her among those who were guilty of the body and blood of Christ. I informed her, that in my early days, through ignorance and persua∣sion, I had done so myself: when I was brought to the knowledge of the Lord, it deeply impressed my spirits; but, by an application of this scripture, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST CLEANSETH FROM ALL SIN, I enjoyed relief. To this she paused, lifted up her eyes to heaven, and then pro∣ceeded:—<HI>Could I attain one ray of solid hope, enlivened by faith in Christ, I would quit the world without a sigh. At times, I feel my heart expand to Jesus—I feel I love him in my heart— nay, my soul seems full of love; but, at other times I feel so full of guilt and fear, it bears me down with grief.</HI></P>
<P>On my last visit I found her attended by a Phila∣delphian friend, who intimated to Mrs. Hamilton the propriety of her withdrawing, with the nurse, while she-conversed with me; to whom she replied, <HI>No, you need not go out; I have nothing to say that I need be ashamed of; I have only to tell my need of a Saviour, and there is no shame in that▪</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="031228_0196_0FEB759280B57520"/>
She was sensible that her end was approaching. At intervals, she said, <HI>her heart felt a secret hope in God, and a warm love to Christ; but was fre∣quently so much absorbed by temptation and pain, that none but Christ could support her.</HI> Still her earnest cry was for the sensible smiles of the Sa∣viour, with which, she said, <HI>she could instantly resign her breath.</HI> I told her, neither she, nor I, deserved a smile from God; it was a rich mercy if he made us sensible of our guilt, and led us, by faith for salvation, to the bleeding cross of his Son: if this be our case, the smiles shall come by and by. <HI>O!</HI> replied she, <HI>it is at the cross I rest, and I must wait and knock until the Lord shall answer.</HI> I prayed with her, and took my final leave.</P>
<P>Death now made a rapid advance; yet Mrs. Hamilton seemed incessant in prayer. Her friend informed me, that on asking her of the state of her mind a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le before her departure, she replied, <HI>I am still seeking—still knocking!</HI> Then lifting up her eyes to heaven, and clasping her hands, in solemn, powerful accents she exclaimed, <HI>My God! my God! am I forsaken? Then I will rap yet the harder!</HI> Agonizing under dissolving nature, she continued in silent prayer, until she closed her eyes in death, aged fifty-two years, twenty-six of which
<PB N="192" REF="031228_0197_0FEB7595D182BE08"/>
she had spent, to her manifest grief, on the delusive vanities of the stage.</P>
<P>Though Mrs. Hamilton was never chargeable, so far as I have ever heard, with a profligate life, nor did she ever intimate this in my conversation with her, yet it was evident, that her entrance and continuance on the stage gave her the most pungent distress. The occupation of an <HI>actress</HI> she consi∣dered as dangerous, exposing to numerous tempta∣tions, and inconsistent with a christian profession. —Charity leads us to believe, that she found that <HI>repentance,</HI> carefully sought with tears, and expe∣rienced the virtue of the blood of Christ, which <HI>cleanseth from all sin.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>This is the scene of combat, not of rest;</L>

<L>On this side death his dangers never cease—</L>
<L>His joys are joys of conquest, not of peace.</L></Q>

<P>EXPERIENCE is knowledge and advantage arising fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m practice: evangelically, as applied to christians, it is the knowledge and enjoyment of God, arising from the conflict in the soul between
<PB N="194" REF="031228_0199_0FEB769FB0F76A68"/>
nature and grace; flesh and spirit; the old man and the new. Although the experience of the heart admits of different degrees of combat and sensibility, light and darkness, pleasure and pain, yet there can be no christian, as such, without some measure of experience; it is absolutely inseparable from his ex∣istence as a believer, either as a babe, a young man, or a father, in Christ. A subject, therefore, of this magnitude is worthy a place in this publication, and demands the most serious attention of our nu∣merous readers.</P>
<P>The AUTHOR of christian experience is the Spirit of God. This sentiment our Lord taught in his discourse to the Jews: <HI>He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters. This spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive.</HI> John vii.38, 39. To the woman of Samaria he explained the same truth: <HI>Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</HI> John iv.14. This <HI>well</HI> is dug in the sinner's <HI>Regeneration</HI>; the sacred <HI>water</HI> springs in <HI>Conversion,</HI> flows through every channel of <HI>Obedience,</HI> replenishes the heart under the se∣verest sufferings, and creates those sublime pleasures which bear the soul above the fears of death, in
<PB N="195" REF="031228_0200_0FEAF876EE0BD398"/>
prospect of immortal joys. Nor can we omit citing the great channel of experience which our Lord hath given us under the expressive emblem of the <HI>vine and the branches,</HI> the vital sap of which, the power of the Blessed Spirit, produces the buds of desire, the leaves of profession, the fragrant flowers of comfort, and the richest fruit of love to God and man. The experience of God's grace and love, the essence of religion, can no more be enjoyed in the breast of a sinner without the Spirit of God, than the branch can bear fruit without a living union with the vine. John xv. 1 — 5. As it was the office and work of CHRIST to make atonement for sin, by the shedding of his blood; so it is the office and work of the SPIRIT to bring sinners into the know∣ledge and experience of that great salvation. For a man to profess his faith in the person and work of Christ, without being able to give a testimony of the work of the Spirit upon his heart, is the most awful delusion—<HI>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his,</HI> let his profession be as brilliant as it may. Rom. viii.9.</P>
<P>The STANDARD of experience is the gospel of Christ. As the Holy Ghost dictated the authors of the bible, so the gospel, in all its variety, fulness and glory, is applied to a believing soul <HI>in the de∣monstration of the</HI> same <HI>Spirit, and of power.</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="031228_0201_0FEAF878A158E938"/>
1 Thess. i.5.ii.13. <HI>To the law, and to the tes∣timony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</HI> Isaiah viii.20. It is in the volume of revelation alone that we know how God pardons sin—how it is our guilty conscience can have peace with God—how we may walk happily with him—what are the enemies we have to fight against—and by what means we are made more than conquerors. It is here alone that we learn the great, the glorious act of JEHOVAH, in adopting his children in Christ— what are their features, trials, mercies, duties, pri∣vileges, and security. A considerable part of this sacred book exhibits, in the most lively colours, the EXPERIENCES of God's children, for many thou∣sand years; and it is most certain, that there is no man who has been made a partaker of God's grace, but has found, in the lives of bible saints, an exact copy of his own frames, feelings, fears, hopes, and joys. Let the men of grace be of whatever lan∣guage, nation, or particular visible denomination, they may, the pure language of experience which God promised to turn to the people of his love, is the same, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, and serve him with one consent. God's truth can alone be the criterion of God's work. That experience which flows from Christ, and rests upon
<PB N="197" REF="031228_0202_0FEB759E05963CA0"/>
his word, will satisfy, and abide; while that which is derived from outward means only, and exists in mere frames, fits and passions, shall vanish as the smoke, or prove as the morning cloud and as the early dew which passeth away. Hosea vi.4. There were some in the church at Corinth, and such will be found in every church, who neglected the stand∣ard of the gospel, and estimated their state by the feelings, gifts, and experiences of each other. <HI>We dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some, that commend themselves: but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves amongst themselves, are not wise.</HI> 2 Cor. x.12. If he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool, equally so must he be that trusts in another. Let us derive pleasure from reciting our experiences to each other; but, let the word of the Lord be the light unto our feet, and a lamp unto our path, to ascertain the perfection of our expe∣rience, and the safety of our state.</P>
<P>The PROGRESS of experience is, in scripture, called, <HI>growing in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</HI>; 2 Pet. iii.18. and, <HI>a growing up into Christ in all things.</HI> Eph. iv.15. It is analogous to he advance of ve∣getable nature; <HI>first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</HI> Mark iv.28. And,
<PB N="198" REF="031228_0203_0FEB759F9A3D50D0"/>
to the advance of humanity—<HI>babe, youth, man∣hood, old age</HI>; with all the passions, activity, du∣ties, virtues, and advantages of each stage. 1 John ii.13, 14. These productions of nature, like the growth of the soul in grace, are gradual and im∣perceptible, and only to be ascertained by their pe∣riods, light, strength, and virtue. The first efforts of grace are described as <HI>seeing men as trees walk∣ing,</HI> Mark viii.24. its advance and completion <HI>to the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</HI> Eph. iv.16. The prophet Ezekiel gives us a most delightful view of this subject, in his description of the flowing of the water that issued out from under the threshold of the house of the Lord; the depths of which were, to <HI>the ancles—the knees— the loins—and waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.</HI> Ezekiel xlvii.1—5. In the advance of experience, we cannot but perceive that faith, hope, love, repentance, meekness, long-suffering, and truth, as derived from Christ, oppose the baneful powers of unbelief, despair, hatred, pride, malice, and every other evil that arises from the old body of sin that lodges within the soul. By this conflict the christian is led more deeply to know and to loath the vileness of sin, pants after greater
<PB N="199" REF="031228_0204_0FEB75A2EC266DE0"/>
conformity to Christ, and cleaves unto the Lord with full purpose of heart. The more powerfully the snares of the world and satan surround him, the more ardently he breathes for communion with God. The more sensibly he feels his own imper∣fections, the more he cries for the enjoyment of the fulness of Jesus, and rejoices in him as the great High Priest, who hath made atonement, and bears the iniquities of our most holy things. This con∣flict Paul felt, and hath left us a copy of his ex∣perience in the seventh chapter of the Romans. He that is a partaker of the same grace, can, more or less, adopt his language in the fifth chapter— <HI>Therefore, being justified, by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in tribu∣lation also, knowing that tribulation worketh pa∣tience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.</HI></P>
<P>The MEANS by which experience is advanced are necessary to be understood. As vegetable nature prospers by the rays of the sun, and the rains from above, so the christian is indebted to the beams
<PB N="200" REF="031228_0205_0FEB75A475044BD0"/>
of Christ, the glorious Son of Righteousness, and to the constant influences of the Blessed Spirit.— As the body depends upon the air in which we breathe for the comforts, use, and exertions of ani∣mal life, so the soul is incessantly dependant on the Spirit of God for all the support, consolation, and activity, connected with a life of faith on Christ. As the advance of animal nature is promoted by activity and industry, so the christian finds an in∣finite variety of duties, personal and relative, in the world, in the closet, in the family, and in the church; the performance of which is connected with his hope in God, and his love to his Saviour. But, perhaps, experience is more rapidly advanced, and more strongly rooted, in the furnace of afflic∣tion. It was in this furnace that the faith of the primitive christians was found to be more precious than gold that perisheth. 1 Pet. i.7. Never did a believer pass through suffering, but, either in it or after it, he was convinced that he could not have done without it. The Lord made Joseph fruitful in the land of his affliction. Genesis xli.52. And in all the Lord's dispensations to his people, he promotes their humility, increases their faith, and gives them the greater enjoyment of his presence. It is very observable, that the annual season that ripens the corn in the ear, is most attended with
<PB N="201" REF="031228_0206_0FEB75A7C02F4590"/>
thunder, lightning, storm, and tempest; and, many excellent christians have found, that the nearer they advanced to the close of life, temptations and af∣flictions increased upon them: and thus, as an oar of wheat ripe for the sickle, he bows his head in humility, self-denial, and obedience; while the lan∣guage of his heart is, Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly!</P>
<P>To conclude this essay: let the professor of re∣ligion be persuaded to try his experience by the tes∣timony of the gospel. Psm. cxxxix.23, 24.—Let not the weak in faith be discouraged: although a <HI>babe</HI> in grace, be thankful for what you enjoy, and remember, God giveth more grace. James iv.6.— Let those who have good experience of pardon, peace and love in God, be ready to give a reason of the hope that is in him with meekness and fear; proving the genuineness of his profession by the holiness of his life. Matt. v.16.—And, let those who advance to the last stage of life know, that God will not forsake the work of his own hand; but that you shall come to the grave in a full age, like a shock of corn cometh in in its season. Job v.27.</P>

<HEAD>THE RELIEF.</HEAD>
<P>A CLERGYMAN of the state of New-York, not many years since, through a misapprehension of a leading member, was precipitately deprived of his pulpit, which involved a large family in ne∣cessity. At supper, the good man had the pain of beholding the last morsel of bread placed upon the table, without the least means or prospect of a supply for his children's breakfast. His wife, full of grief, with her children, retired to her bed. The minister chose to set up and employ his dark hours in prayer, and in reading the promises of God. Some secret hope of supply pervaded his breast; but when, how, what, whence, or by whom, he knew not. He retired to rest, and in the morning appeared with his family, and performed the duty of prayer. It being the depth of winter, and a little fire upon the hearth, probably to keep the poor children's expectations alive, that breakfast should soon be enjoyed, he desired his wife to hang on the kettle, and spread the cloth upon the table.—The kettle boiled—the children cried for bread: the af∣flicted father, standing before the fire, felt those emotions of heart unknown to those whose tables are replenished with affluence. While in this
<PB N="203" REF="031228_0208_0FEB75AE854E6600"/>
painful state, some one knocked at the door— en∣tered—passed the compliments of the morning, and was about to leave the room, when he stepped back and delivered a letter into the minister's hand. When the gentleman was gone the letter was opened, and, to the minister's astonishment, it contained a FOUR POUNDS BANK BILL, with a desire of acceptance. So manifest an interposition of Divine goodness could not but be received with gratitude and joy; and, should be a lesson to others to trust in that Saviour who hath said, <HI>Verily thou shalt be fed.</HI> Psm. xxxvii.3. <HI>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> Heb. xiii.5.</P>
<P>This remarkable occurrence being communi∣cated to the EDITOR, who, having an intimacy with the gentleman said to be the hand that offered the seasonable relief, was determined, the next time he made him a visit, to introduce the subject, and, if possible, to know the reason that induced the generous action. The story was told—the gen∣tleman discovered a modest blush, which evinced the tenderness of his heart. On interrogation, he said "He had frequently heard that minister: on a certain morning he was disposed for a walk; thought, in the severity of the winter season a trifle might be of service, as fuel was high; felt a kind of necessity to inclose the money in a letter; went
<PB N="204" REF="031228_0209_0FEB75B6702BECA8"/>
to the house; found the family adjusted as was de∣scribed; delivered the paper and retired; but knew not of the extreme necessity of the minister and his family until this moment."</P>
<P>The address made by the gentleman's amiable sister, present in the parlour, shall serve as an im∣provement of this narrative. "Brother, learn from this never to withhold your hand from re∣lieving another, when you feel a dictate in your own breast; as this instance must convince you, it was from God, and greater benefit conveyed than ever you intended to bestow."</P>

No man can wisely boast of to∣morrow; we know not what a day may bring forth; no, nor even a moment, or the twinkling of the eye;—such short transitions of time are big with the most important events.</P>

Did such fore-knowledge pervade
<PB N="206" REF="031228_0211_0FEB75B9F0C4C590"/>
the mind of man, childhood and youth would bear the sorrows of old age; the powers of genius would fail; art be unimproved; and nature herself unex∣plored. How little does the busy worldling reflect on his obligation to infinite goodness, for his ability to perform the duties of his station, and that the uncertainty of future events demands his constant dependence upon the pleasure of the Almighty! Those whose minds are directed to the Supreme, know, that the providence of God is a mystery to man in all ages. It is as the bud which gradually and imperceptibly arises into flower, and then emits its richest fragrance. It is a second bible; every day, and every moment, like the several leaves of the sacred volume, presenting something new and astonishing to the intelligent observer.</P>
<P>If the observations now made, as they relate to men in common life, be pronounced just, I may venture to add, that the wisdom and goodness of God, in withholding the knowledge of future events, is more highly esteemed by the real Chris∣tian than by those whose habit of dissipation de∣prives them of an ability to observe the dispensa∣tions of the Almighty. If God, in the early part of the Christian's life, had uncovered the great deep of the heart; exposed the secret evils that lodge within it; or had given the good man a view of
<PB N="207" REF="031228_0212_0FEB75BD29B327D8"/>
the imperfections, disappointments, temptations, crosses, and sorrows that awaited him, how would his soul have trembled at the awful prospect, and bowed himself to the very dust of the earth! The Christian sometimes ascends the mount of con∣templation; surveys the <HI>map</HI> of his past <HI>experi∣ence</HI>; remembers the way which the Lord his God hath led him; and in the review his soul is filled with profound astonishment! So many winding, thorny paths,—seas of tribulation,—dreary deserts, —mountains of difficulty,—valleys of humiliation! <HI>My God!</HI> says he, and drops the silent tear, <HI>can I have passed through such ways as these? Is it possible! Surely had I known the path, my feet had never made the choice. It was thou, my God, my Saviour, and my Guide, that safely brought me through; nor can I now distrust thy future care. Secure beneath thy sacred wings I shall pass my fleeting days; finish my course with joy; walk through the shades of death, and mount to Zion's hill above, to celebrate thy praise!</HI></P>
<P>Before I quit this paper, it may not be unnecessary to inquire, why God thus conceals from man the knowledge of future events, when, as transgressors against him, they merit every exhibition of present and eternal sorrow, as the fruit of their own trans∣gressions? We reply, JESUS HATH DELIVER∣ED

<P>HOW infinite, how truly grand the works of the ALMIGHTY! On this lower globe, what in∣numerable productions strike the eye of contem∣plation,
<PB N="211" REF="031228_0216_0FEB75C9DC52B3B0"/>
and lead the soul with profoundest rever∣ence to adore the infinite, the wise, the glorious Supreme! But, of all these, how is our sight gra∣tified, and our senses regaled, while passing through the FLOWERY NATIONS? Here nature wears her bright attire, pours forth her wonders, and de∣mands our highest praise. From this rich, inex∣haustible profusion of Nature's garden, let us at least select the ROSE of SHARON, survey its beau∣ties, and collect its sweets.</P>
<P>The ROSE, <HI>rosa,</HI> is acknowledged a genus of the polygamia order, belonging to the icosandria class of plants. The sorts of roses are very nume∣rous. Turnefort reckons no less than fifty-three, and botanists find it very difficult to determine with accuracy, which are species, and which are varie∣ties, as well as which are varieties of the respec∣tive species. On this account, Linnaeus, and some other eminent authors, are inclined to think, that there is only one real species of rose, which is the <HI>rosa canina,</HI> or dog-rose of the hedge, and that all the other sorts are accidental varieties of it. How∣ever, according to the present Linnaean arrangement they stand divided into fourteen supposed species, each comprehending some varieties, which in some sorts are but few, others numerous.</P>
<P>The rose we admire is <HI>the rose of Sharon,</HI> the
<PB N="212" REF="031228_0217_0FEB75D04ABD92A0"/>
most delightful in its colours, and the richest in its fragrance. This invites our choice, because it is an emblem of Immanuel's glory, and endears our hearts to him. Sol. Songs ii.1.</P>
<P N="1">1. The beauty of its colours, <HI>red</HI> and <HI>white,</HI> expressive these of the glory of the God-head, and the sorrows of the humanity of Christ. <HI>My be∣loved,</HI> said the church, <HI>is white and ruddy.</HI> Sol. Songs v.10. WHITE is properly no colour at all, but a composition of all colours; the light of the sun, therefore, said Sir Isaac Newton, is only white, because consisting of all colours: neither is BLACK, its opposite, a colour, but a deprivation of all colours, therefore the proper emblem of wretchedness and death. Apply these observa∣tions to the scripture testimony of Jehovah: <HI>God is light, and in him is no darkness at all,</HI> 1 John i.5. demonstrative this of that underived, self-ex∣istent purity, happiness, truth, love, and glory, which, without the shadow of variation, disorder, and imperfection, is essential to Deity. That this excellence, peculiar to Jehovah, is ascribed to Je∣sus, the current of scripture evinces. Aaron, the High Priest, was to wear a pure linen garment un∣der the ephod, to represent the invisible divinity under the humanity. Daniel saw the Messiah, <HI>the Ancient of days,</HI> with a <HI>garment white as snow.</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="031228_0218_0FEB75D230749E08"/>
Dan. vii.9. When Jesus was transfigured upon mount Tabor, <HI>his raiment was white as the light; more than any fuller on earth could make them.</HI> Mark ix.3. Thus, Jesus Christ, <HI>the bles∣ed and only</HI> POTENTATE, <HI>the</HI> KING <HI>of</HI> KINGS, <HI>and</HI> LORD <HI>of</HI> LORDS; <HI>who not only hath immor∣tality dwelling in the</HI> LIGHT, <HI>which no man can approach unto; whom,</HI> in his divinity, <HI>no man hath seen, nor can see, is worthy of honour and power everlasting.</HI> 1 Tim. vi.15, 16. Let us now contemplate the other colour that forms this beau∣tiful rose. This is to exhibit the quality of the human body, generally acknowledged to be formed by the Almighty, from a sort of red earth. Nor does it less intimate those sorrows which mankind experience as the fruit of disobedience. But, as applied to Christ, denotes the greatness of his suf∣ferings, and his bloody death, as the redeemer of sinners. Isaiah beheld Messiah, <HI>red in his appa∣rel, and whose garment was like him that tread∣eth in the wine-fat.</HI> lxiii.2. In the days of his flesh, sufferings attended his path, and, in Gathsa∣mane, his sorrows were such that produced strong cries and tears, while sweat and blood issued from every vein, and fell down to the ground. His death exhibited the most affecting scene; so great the ago∣nies of his body by crucifixion; so extreme the sor∣rows
<PB N="214" REF="031228_0219_0FEB75D3C68C7F98"/>
of his soul pressed with the weight of divine judgment for our sins, that nature herself, by a su∣pernatural darkness, drew a veil over the distressed sufferer! In his exalted state, he is seen by the glorified throng, as <HI>a Lamb that had been slain.</HI> John beheld this adored Lord, wearing <HI>a name written that no man knew but himself; and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood.</HI> Rev. xix.12, 13. Can we read these scriptures with∣out a conviction of the eternal power and God∣head of Christ? Can we turn the sacred page without being deeply affected with the life and death of Jesus, as a man of sorrows, and acquaint∣ed with griefs? Impossible! Cast then your eyes upon THE ROSE OF SHARON, produced, may I say, on purpose to exhibit by its colour the same truth which revelation teaches. Let us look still closer, and while the white and the red, pure in themselves, exhibit the perfection of Nature's pen∣cil; observe how delicately fine the union between the two; this to teach us the <HI>great mystery of god∣liness, God manifest in the flesh.</HI> A union this that constitutes the character of Christ as MEDI∣ATOR; lays the foundation of our pardon, and is the strong basis of our communion with God, perseverence through life, support in death, and hope of a glorious immortality!</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="215" REF="031228_0220_0FEB75D6EB3C6F88"/>2. The odoriferous <HI>scent</HI> of the Rose of Sharon assists us to contemplate the precious virtues of the Lord of glory. How richly does this sweet rose pour forth its fragrance to gratify the sense! yet more richly does Jesus display the glories of his name; opens the unbounded love of his heart; ap∣plies a full pardon bought with his most precious blood; proclaims, by his gospel, the inconceivable fulness of his grace as an all-sufficient supply for our support, comfort, perseverance, sanctification, and everlasting felicity. Jesus, the Rose of Sha∣ron, is ever precious to them that believe; yet there are special seasons when his delights are more sen∣sibly enjoyed. David exclaimed, <HI>Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me.</HI> Psm. cxxxviii.7. And thousands in every age have enjoy∣ed more sensible comforts in Christ, at a period of affliction, than ever they experienced in a time of ease and affluence. <HI>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also a∣boundeth by Christ.</HI> When the church attends the supper of the Lord, how often does the Redeem∣er gladden their hearts with the light of his counte∣nance, while communion, with bread and wine, yields the richest delight! But, however precious and delightful the Rose of Sharon may be to us in our passage through life, in the article of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, far
<PB N="216" REF="031228_0221_0FEB75DD434C48B8"/>
superior enjoyments are conferred. <HI>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.</HI> When flesh and heart fail; when the sweets of hu∣man friendship are no longer to be enjoyed; when the richest cordials and the most delicious produc∣tions of nature cease to gratify the taste, and pol∣lute upon the lips, then for the soul to be regaled with the smiles of Jesus, the delightful Rose of Sha∣ron, how great is the blessing! Sheltered beneath Immanuel's wings, and sweetly solaced with his love, how many thousands have launched into eter∣nity with a smile, and hailed the promised crown of life!</P>
<P N="3">3. The medicinal virtues of the rose affords us further aid to explore the excellence of the Lord Christ. There is not a more rich perfume than the essence of roses. The rose distilled with wa∣ter yields a small portion of a butyraceous oil, whose flavour exactly resembles that of the rose itself. This oil, and the distilled water, are very useful and agreeable cordials. A conserve of ro∣ses is of various uses, particularly in relieving im∣perfections attending the eye, and of meliorating and removing complaints, unnecessary now to be mentioned.</P>
<P>But whence these medicinal virtues of the rose? Do they flow while blooming in the field? No:
<PB N="217" REF="031228_0222_0FEB75DECD0F5688"/>
this delightful flower must be cut down, cast into a Still, and undergo the severity of fire, before its essence can be enjoyed. Solemn thought this, when applied to Christ, the Rose of Sharon! He appeared in all the perfection of humanity, and displayed the glory of divinity thirty-three years; then was cut down by death, the instrument of jus∣tice, cast into the grave, sustained the fire of divine anger against sin, and thus, as the Redeemer of his people, yielded the virtues of his sacrifice, for their pardon, peace, and happiness in God. There is no virtue in the rose to regale the fainting spirits, re∣store the wasted frame, heal the obstructed sight, or cure the burning fever, but what there are infi∣nitely greater virtues in a crucified Jesus, to cure similar, nay, every disorder possible incident to the soul of man. Thousands in every age, under the most complicated mental evils, have received with joy the virtues of the Rose of Sharon; and thou∣sands still, and thousands more, shall enjoy its sa∣cred sweets and triumph in its praise!</P>
<P N="4">4. SHARON, (that is, <HI>a plain or field</HI>) the native soil of the lovely rose, will help us to conceive a few more thoughts of the adored Redeemer. This plain of Sharon was a delightful, fertile place, where David f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his numerous flock, and may de∣note the open, free publication of Christ in the
<PB N="218" REF="031228_0223_0FEB75E05D268E10"/>
world by his gospel; or his church, where he dwells, conducts his sheep, displays his glory, heals the sick, and comforts the sorrowful. By the pre∣sence of the Lord, this wilderness, solitary place of our earthly pilgrimage, dreary as the desert, is made to blossom as the rose. Isaiah xxxv.1, 2. Wher∣ever his love is experienced, there is that sacred joy which can only be exceeded by drinking at the fountain head in glory!</P>
<P>As the Rose grew upon Sharon's plain, free for all who had eyes to see, sense to smell, or hands to embrace, so Jesus is freely and fully published in his gospel. <HI>Whosoever will, let him come, and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> But, those who have neither eyes to see, nor sense to smell, pass by the Rose of Sharon, treat it with disdain, and attempt to crush it under foot.</P>
<P N="5">5. No Rose without its Thorn; no, not even the Rose of Sharon! Who takes Christ must take the cross too. <HI>If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</HI> If any man will live godly in Christ Jesus, he must suffer persecution.

<HEAD>THE AFFLICTED MOTHER.</HEAD>
<P>A PIOUS gentleman and his wife, possessed of an agreeable fortune, were favoured with a son and two daughters. The mother fixed her atten∣tion inordinately upon her children, and gradually declined in the warmth of her affections to God▪ so hard is it for us to possess the natural enjoyments of life, and yet to reserve the heart for God! God, however, is a jealous God to them who are the ob∣jects of his love; and, according to his own pro∣mise, he visits their iniquities with a rod. Psm. lxxxix.32. God said to Hosea, <HI>Ephraim is joined
<PB N="220" REF="031228_0225_0FEB75E9E7AFAB00"/>
unto idols, let him alone.</HI> Hosea iv.17. This woman idolized her children, and God convinced her of her folly. Her youngest child was seized with a fever, lay a few days, and died. This be∣reaving providence, instead of impressing her mind with a sense of the uncertainty of human enjoy∣ments, and, that God alone was the centre of hap∣piness, she called his judgments in question, and murmured at his hand. A few months after this, her other daughter, after affording her mother great pleasure by her prattle in the parlour, entered the garden, walked on the edge of a fine fish-pond, slipped in, and was drowned, before relief could be obtained. The unfortunate mother was now fil∣led with distraction; sullen grief succeeded; at length, by temptation, she highly reflected on the conduct of the Almighty, and gradually declined in her attendance on the public duties of religion. Her son, now her only child, a remarkably pro∣mising youth, had just finished his education, and returned from the boarding-school—went out one morning with his gun for sport, in company with a neighbouring gentleman; arriving at a fence, rested their guns; the youth, while in conversation, placed his hand, and reclined his head upon the mouth of the barrel; accidentally, by the motion of his foot, he touched the trigger, and instantly the
<PB N="221" REF="031228_0226_0FEB75EBD701C158"/>
contents of the piece was discharged through his brain. In this affecting state he was conveyed to his parents; but what pen is able to recite the dreadful emotion of their hearts on the melancholy sight! What submission might possess the father's breast, is uncertain; but the unhappy mother, while surrounded with weeping friends, in the midst of her agonies unguardedly exclaimed, <HI>God has taken away my children, and what can he now do more?</HI> God soon convinced her that he could do more. Her husband caught a violent cold, a consumption ensued, and death received him to his gloomy shades. When the information of his death was given to his wife, she fainted. On her recovery, she fell upon her knees, the tears gushed from her eyes, and with accents indescribable, she exclaim∣ed, "Lord, thou hast at length bowed my rebel∣lious heart! Thou hast stripped me of my chil∣dren, and my husband is no more; here, Lord, take my heart—never more suffer a creature, however dear, to remove it from thyself. I own thy judg∣ments just, and ask the comforts of thy love!</P>
<P>This woman survived several years, and lived an example of real piety. Let this narrative teach others, that strong affections produce strong afflic∣tions; and that thus is the creature best enjoyed when held in subordination to the pleasure of the Lord.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT a person who, through grace, has enjoy∣ed the rich manifestations of a Saviour's smiles, and hath been numbered with Christ's visible flock, may be liable to fall into temptation, lose the bloom of his profession, and the comforts of his soul, for a season, is a truth so evident in the scriptures, and so convicting in the conscience, as at once demands our assent and our tears. Although it be abso∣lutely impossible to describe every sensation of a backsliding heart, and the many erring paths to which such are exposed, I shall, in this paper, draw the general outline of such an unhappy case, and add my fervent prayer, that God may make it a mean to alarm the careless, humble the disobedi∣ent, and reclaim the wanderer.</P>
<P>True religion begins with Christ; he is our par∣don, peace, hope, and everlasting salvation. To
<PB N="223" REF="031228_0228_0FEB75F3E25857D8"/>
sit under his shadow, and by faith experience the fruit of his passion, sweet to our taste, constitutes the sublime happiness of our souls: It is therefore evident, that the first step to our departure from God, and our errors in life, begins at the cross. John vi.68. The eye is allured from beholding the person of Jesus and the heart partially ceases; to have sensible enjoyment of his grace and his love. Perhaps this observation may meet with conviction in the reader's breast;—the time is re∣membered, that when impressed with guilt, and loaded with distress, he rested at the cross, beheld the bleeding Lamb, and felt peace and pleasure with God. Then, how incessant was the panting of the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> communion with the Saviour! the least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and the smallest evil, keenly wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soul, and made the eyes flow with tears. But now, though the name of Christ be ap∣proved, it is not preciously enjoyed. The soul and Christ seldom meets in love, and feels the sweets of pardon in his blood. A shyness has taken place, and the perfidious conduct of the Christian deeply convinces his conscience, and leaves him without excuse. Perhaps the Saviour's charge may reach the reader's ears, and pierce his guilty breast:—"<HI>Know, therefore, and see, that it is an
<PB N="224" REF="031228_0229_0FEB75F56B515B00"/>
evil, and a bitter thing, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God.</HI> Jer. ii.19.</P>
<P>As by the cross of Christ we are brought nigh to God, and enjoy the sweets of fellowship with him as our Father; so, a neglect of the virtues of the cross imperceptibly obstructs us in the enjoy∣ment of that high privilege. Our communion with God is carried on by faith, meditation, and prayer; the essence of which is, the secret motion of the soul in peace, adoration, hope, love, and joy; pro∣ducing that solid satisfaction and sublime pleasure, which none but he that feels it knows. This ex∣perience constitutes our heaven upon earth. We thus walk with God, and never feel ourselves un∣happy but when interrupted in this holy path. Whatever affliction may attend us, it is in commu∣nion with God that our tears are wiped away, learn the design of every adverse providence, and receive grace to help in time of need. Perhaps the reader may bring to recollection the time when he enjoyed this privilege with sweet delight, drew near the Lord by prayer, could tell him all your grief, and receive the satisfaction which gave you bold∣ness to pursue the path of life with joy; but, you are conscious it is not so now. You pray; but it is not in prayer: your meditations are attended with darkness; your faith is surrounded with such amaz∣ing
<PB N="225" REF="031228_0230_0FEB75F727968968"/>
unbelief, that often induces you to question if ever you believed at all; and the motion of your heart to God is in great coldness and heaviness. Thus, when you would do good, evil is ever pre∣sent with you; and a consciousness of guilt hur∣ries you away from prayer, and increases the dis∣tance of your soul from God. Standing thus as on the threshold of the closet, you are ripe to em∣brace any temptation which satan may propose. Thousands of most excellent Christians have mark∣ed this fatal spot, where apostacy more visibly be∣gan. If David could say, <HI>It is good for me to draw near to God,</HI> O how extremely bitter and dangerous the consequence of living at a sensible distance from God! Christian, where art thou? <HI>Take heed lest there be in you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God</HI>; for, be assured, <HI>the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways.</HI> Prov. xiv.14. And, if you feel it not now, it will be more severe at a future period. You know not whither you may be led by sin, therefore return unto the Lord, from whom you have deeply revolted.</P>
<P>The loss of sensible communion with God soon discovers itself in the disposition of the mind, and in the actions of the life. The Word of the Lord was precious in those days when the Christian lived
<PB N="226" REF="031228_0231_0FEB75FA84B24540"/>
near to God: now it is read with indifference, without faith, without prayer, without a desire to find Christ, and a determination to follow his pre∣cepts or embrace his promises. In the discharge of domestic duties, the temper is altered; morning and evening prayer becomes formal; and the imperfec∣tions of servants and children are passed over with∣out reproof, because the conscience is an accuser of its own sin. Religious conversation, if held at all, is not upon the beauties of Christ, the riches of grace, or the experience of the heart; but, on speculative points, the gifts of ministers, the mis∣fortunate miscarriages of others, or (what is pretty fashionable among professors of this day) the de∣cline of religion, without producing one effort to revive it in themselves or others. The Lord's day now comes rather of course, than from pleasing anticipation. Public prayer is little enjoyed; and the preaching of the gospel is not nourishing, for want of faith in him that hears it. Heb. iv.2.— Either the minister is charged with barrenness, or the hearer thinks himself sufficiently wise without fresh instruction: nor is it uncommon to find such a person going from one minister to another, in search of <HI>something new</HI>; yet nothing really satis∣fies the heart, because, the man is dissatisfied with himself, and at a distance from the Lord. This
<PB N="227" REF="031228_0232_0FEB75FDD34B7400"/>
spiritual decline of heart paves the way for a more general neglect of the means of grace—lives above them, and concludes, he is as well at home, or walking in the fields, as he would be at church. Thus, no wonder that the man who has lost the comforts of grace in his soul should misimprove, or totally neglect the means of grace also.</P>
<P>Lut us now take one step farther with the re∣volting Christian, and mark the change which takes place in his conduct in the more busy scenes of life. That sweet restraint which a sense of the love of God once created upon his soul, and directed his cautious steps in forming his connections, manag∣ing his trade, and answering his obligations, gra∣dually wears away, and his heart takes a more speedy flight after all which the world calls good and great. He may now pass for a <HI>polite Christi∣an</HI>; having the name, but destitute of the spirit of a lively believer, and of course tries pretty hard to make his profession and his worldly pursuits com∣port with each other. The men of business can∣not, however, but perceive that this man has con∣siderably lost the fine bloom of his religious pro∣fession, and triumphantly exclaim—<HI>See, the man hath become like one of us!</HI> It is now that he stands in the way of indulging those maxims, and committing those evils which before his soul abhor∣red,
<PB N="228" REF="031228_0233_0FEB75FF60417240"/>
and which he severely reproved in others. Sa∣tan meets him upon his own ground, suits his bates to the frame of his heart, and, by every method in his infernal power, blinds his mind, hardens his heart, and pollutes his passions. Here, at least, let us stop—No man's pea, or tongue, can ascertain how far, and to what wretched lengths a man in such a state may go;—rather than attempt such a pursuit, it is the wish of the writer of this paper to ask the reader, <HI>Is this case your own?</HI> Happy for you, if it is not. Testify your gratitude to God; live upon Christ; plead his Spirit; keep his statutes; watch the motion of your heart, and you are happy indeed! But, if this description of a back∣slider, in either, or in all its stages, shews your own likeness, and your conscience says, <HI>Thou art the man,</HI> let me solemnly intreat you to reflect upon your case. Each stage has an easy transitition to another; he that is not watchful of the first, will soon find himself in the next, and, like a rolling stone, will find the way to the botton.</P>
<P>Remember, the sin of your departure from God has been committed with your eyes open. What ingratitude is this to God for his love—to Christ for his salvation—and to the Blessed Spirit for his instruction and consolation!—Did you not solemnly devote yourself to be the Lord's at your conver∣sion;
<PB N="229" REF="031228_0234_0FEB7605DC5192A0"/>
and have you not frequently renewed this sur∣render in private, at your baptism, and at the Lord's Supper?—What evil has the Lord done unto you? and wherein has he wearied you? Were not his paths pleasant, his promises sweet, and his smiles charming? In how many scenes of distress has he delivered you? And in the bounty of his providence, and the riches of his grace, how often has he ex∣ceeded your highest expectations? What griefs does your present coldness of heart and disobedience of life create in the breast of those who are the friends of Christ, and who knew you when a hum∣ble, lively, happy christian?—Neither forget the discouragements which you give to the lambs of the flock who are seeking the paths of the Lord; and the advantage you offer the enemies of the gos∣pel to impeach its virtues.—Surely you cannot be insensible what injury you do your own souls. Are you as happy now as when you delighted beneath the Shepherd's care, and fed in the rich pasture of his grace? O! no. Think, for a moment, were temptations now to assail you, how awfully you might fall, and sink deeper into sin and misery?— If death was now to advance, where is your certain hope of future bliss? Can you shut your eyes, harden your heart, pursue in sin, and abandon the Lord of life? God forbid! There is a certain
<PB N="230" REF="031228_0235_0FEB7607D19EAA78"/>
something within your breast that fills you with shame, produces a tear, and makes you cry, <HI>O that it wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with me as in months past! Lord turn unto me, have mercy upon me, heal my backslidings, let me once more find the way to thine arms, and enjoy that peace I felt when first I knew thy love.</HI></P>
<P>Presuming this may be the desire of your heart, I shall, in the next number, show you some of those methods by which Christ the good Shepherd restores his wandering sheep, and the sensibility such have of their merciful restoration.</P>

<P>It is with inexpressible grief I inform you of the death of my dear and much loved sister Charlotte. This was a sudden stroke to us. She was arrested by a violent fever that baffled the skill of our ablest physicians. In her illness, she earnestly desired to see you; but such was the rapid progress of mor∣tality, we were unable to inform you in time. Her spirit was much discomposed; she talked to us all in a manner she never did before, praying that we might all think of our latter end.

<P>A very serious event indeed—I wish it may be productive of real advantage to all con∣cerned. Ah, poor child! what distress must lodge within her breast, when the pangs of death seized her spirit!—Not to know whither she was going! —perhaps she had neglected her bible, and preferred

Vanity resides in the breast, and vanity is uttered by the tongue. She wished to live, to make her peace with God: Ah! how few dissipated, whether young or old, when lain upon their dying pillow, but what feel the power of guilt, and a need of pardon and peace with God!—Thus death makes serious the young, the gay, the aged! I wish, my daughter, you had been with Charlotte in her departing moments; perhaps her last words would have deeply penetrated your breast; and, by God's blessing, received lasting benefit.

<P>Young persons are apt to trifle with the thoughts of death, and imagine an horrid gloom to attend the practice of piety; and that it necessarily excludes the christian from social pleasures; but such conclusions are made by those only who love to gratify those depraved passions which the law of God condemns, and who never yet tasted happiness in God. These, my daughter, you must pronounce improper judges in the case. Persons of true piety know that religion refines the grosser passions, creates a better relish for social pleasures, and in∣stead of introducing them to gloomy shades, it is the only path by which they can escape that dreadful darkness which rested upon the mind of your de∣parted friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, madam, we are too apt to be misled, and to suppress thoughts of mortality; but I hope, from Charlotte's death, to be more soli∣citous for my future life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this your own happiness and the comfort of your parents very much depend. Be∣fore you quit my chamber, let me urge you to the duties of <HI>prayer,</HI> and reading the scriptures. Prayer is the opening of the heart to God—confessing our guilt, and imploring his mercy. This is the great
<PB N="234" REF="031228_0239_0FEB7614B4656FD8"/>
duty which enlivens every other, and fills the soul with the highest satisfaction; but it is a duty to which, by sin, we are naturally averse. Beg the Lord to give you an heart to pray. Never suffer yourself to be ashamed of this duty, however others may despise it. If it be an honour to converse with a king upon his throne, it is infinitely greater to have audience with the LORD OF GLORY, and delight beneath his heavenly smiles!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know this is a very great duty, nor do I wholly neglect it; but I have so many unruly thoughts, and I know so little of God, that it seems almost useless for me to attempt to pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>This then, my child, will convince you of the importance of the other duty I recom∣mended you,—the reading of the Scriptures. This gives us just thoughts of the moral attributes of God,—shews us how, in Christ, sinners are par∣doned, and can have fellowship with God, by the aid of his Holy Spirit. The mind being established in this, ten thousand other precious subjects will unfold to your view, and give you the highest sa∣tisfaction possible. In the language of an excellent writer I may tell you, GO, READ THE BIBLE TO BE GAY. No pleasures are so refined as those which flow from the love of God upon the heart; no supports are equal to those which the promises
<PB N="235" REF="031228_0240_0FEB76164A427ED0"/>
inspire;—no prospects of futurity are so rational and divine, as revelation opens to the believing mind. Although this duty might be performed at any time, yet I recommend you to attend to it in the morning, when the heart is free for contemplation. Begin with the Psalms and the Evangelists, and read a chapter in each; and after you have done, fail not to propose such questions as these—What do I in these chapters learn of God?—Which verse leads me to discover the beauties of a Saviour, and convinces me of my need of Him? Which Pro∣mise is most suited to encourage my mind, and which Precept appears necessary for me to obey? Persons in general read a chapter, close the book, and it is over;—but if such interrogations as I have proposed be made, they will never fail to impress the Scriptures more forcibly on your mind, inlarge your views of God and his grace, and consequently give you the highest encouragement to perform the duty of prayer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for this advice, and hope it will be of real service. If you chuse, ma∣dam, as the servant waits, I will retire and pre∣pare a few lines of condolence to Maria Gay.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE VIRTUES OF FAITH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Oh! that I could but once by <HI>FAITH</HI></L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITHOUT <HI>faith it is impossible to please God,</HI> either in our thoughts, words, or actions. Heb. xi.6. <HI>Faith</HI> is simply taking God at his word, as <HI>unbelief</HI> is giving God the lie. The
<PB N="242" REF="031228_0247_0FEB762FB84457B8"/>
scripture testimony concerning mankind is, <HI>they are children in whom is no faith.</HI> Deut. xxxii.20. and <HI>God hath concluded all in unbelief.</HI> Rom. xi.32. We need not trace the black circle of <HI>athe∣ists, deists,</HI> and modern <HI>free-thinkers,</HI> and listen to their awful expressions against the being, ma∣jesty, providence, law and gospel of God, to dis∣cover the baneful fruit of unbelief; but, enter into our own breasts, where we are sensibly convinced that from this bitter root spring those thoughts and evil passions which are unworthy the true dignity of our nature, and bring us under the pain of damnation. Mark xvi.16. In this state mankind would have lived and died; and, in a future state of existence, been compelled to <HI>believe</HI> the justice of God, and the evil of sin, in their own punish∣ment, had not God, in the glory of his grace, pro∣vided a way by which guilty men should be brought back again to him—a new principle of faith creat∣ed in their unbelieving soul, and thus their moral and eternal happiness secured.</P>
<P>The gospel informs us, that <HI>faith is the gift of God</HI>; Eph. ii.8. that it is obtained through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, 2 Pet. i.1. and produced in the heart by the opera∣tions of the Holy Spirit. Gal. v.22. Col. ii.12. It is a constituent part of that new life which Christ
<PB N="243" REF="031228_0248_0FEB763146FE5C08"/>
communicates to all his people, distinguishing them in their state, sensibility, obedience, pleasures, and prospects, from other men; and those who have it are daily taught practically to believe that the growth, strength, comfort, and lively exertion of their faith, wholly depend upon Jesus, who is <HI>the author and finisher of our faith.</HI> Heb. xii.2. As faith is of such infinite consequence to our present peace and future happiness, I shall, in this essay, form a short collection of its virtues, and wish that they may be more highly experienced in every rea∣der's breast.</P>
<P N="1">1. It scatters the clouds of <HI>self-desception,</HI> which naturally cover the depraved heart of man; shews his true character as a sinner, and reveals his stand∣ing in Christ for eternity. Thus, he that believeth hath the witness in himself. 1 John v.10. God's word is the ground of faith: in this, as in a pure mirror, the enlightened sinner sees his own likeness, and is filled with self-abasement. His heart gradu∣ally opens; its treachery, power, and vileness, in∣duce him, were it possible, to fly from himself. The immortality of the soul, the consequence of transgression, his obligation to the <HI>law,</HI> the certain∣ty of death, the solemnity of judgment, and the ne∣cessity of forgiveness; these, and many other im∣portant truths which before he either denied or neg∣lected,
<PB N="244" REF="031228_0249_0FEB763475302E30"/>
are now conveyed to his conscience, with the fullest demonstration from the Almighty. He had often heard his character described by others; he had frequently felt the convictions of his own conscience; he knew his heart was not altogether right with God; but now, by <HI>faith</HI> of the opera∣tion of God, he knows his case to be desperate, and to live and die in such a state fills him with grief. All things within him, and around him, wear their true colours, and impress his soul with that solemn weight he never felt before. Proud nature, aided by satan, may devise ten thousand ways to recover itself; but such is the virtue of that <HI>faith</HI> by which the work was begun, that the sin∣ner finds a perfect inability to amend his conscience and obtain peace with God, and firmly <HI>believes,</HI> if ever he is saved, it must be by grace alone. The ear which once turned from the charming voice of the gospel, now listens with attention. The per∣son of the God-man Christ Jesus, the perfection of his righteousness, the fulness of his atonement, the riches of his grace, the freeness of his love to sin∣ners, the chief of sinners, his most inveterate ene∣mies, engage the awakened mind, and create a longing for a share in so great a salvation. The word preached profits, being mixed with faith in him that hears it. He begins to understand the
<PB N="245" REF="031228_0250_0FEB76393864D420"/>
truth, which before he despised, that, <HI>by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in the sight of God,</HI> because they are imperfect and vile, which the law condemns and not accepts;—<HI>but now the righteousness of God, without the law, is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets: even the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference.</HI> Rom. iii.21—23. This discovers the gospel to be worthy of its AUTHOR, and to contain a suitable salvation for the sinner. There can be no greater ground for faith in Christ than that the GOD against whom we have sinned, hath set HIM forth in the gospel, a <HI>propitiation through faith in his blood, to de∣clare his righteousness in the remission of sins that are past, that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</HI> Rom. iii.25, 26. Here rests our faith: cut off from this we perish. The belief of it engages the heart and soul most earnestly to pray for it. The same blessed Saviour who said, <HI>All things whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive,</HI> Matt. xxi.22. in due time returns a gracious answer, by manifest∣ing himself to the trembling heart, saying, <HI>Fear not, I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.</HI> Isa. xliii.1. This is
<PB N="246" REF="031228_0251_0FEB763B12882400"/>
enough; faith credits the report, and brings the comfort of the promise. Christ dwells in the heart by faith. Eph. iii.12. My beloved is mine, and I am his. Sol. Song ii.16. The conscience feels peace with God, being satisfied with, and reconcil∣ed by the blood of Christ. What joy and peace in believing! The soul casts itself into the bleeding bosom of the Saviour, and finds rest, pardon, com∣fort, hope and happiness indiscribable. From what Christ is in himself, what he hath done for sinners, what he hath done for me, and my entering into the love of his heart, by faith; these are evidences to me of my interest in him, and I rest assured he will love me to the end. This experience of the heart is called <HI>the work of faith,</HI> 2 Thess. i.11. because such are its soul reclaiming, saving virtues, which never could have been produced by nature, the powers of reason, the circle of the arts, nor all the objects of sense; and brings the highest honour to Jehovah.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the cross of Christ leads to communion with the Father, we will now examine the virtues of <HI>faith,</HI> in enabling us to walk humbly and hap∣pily with him. This is the substance of religion. <HI>We walk by faith, not by sight.</HI> 2 Cor. v.7. By faith we see him who is invisible to the eye of sense; enjoy the comforts of a covenant relation in God
<PB N="247" REF="031228_0252_0FEB763E38155490"/>
as our Father; exult in the glories of his attributes in our redemption, and walk in the light of his countenance. We know nothing of such a rela∣tion of grace but as it is revealed in the Bible; and it is the virtue of faith to receive the truth as it is in Christ, and enjoy the comfort of it. It is the object of unbelief to raise a cloud between the christian and his God, to interrupt the pleasures of communion; but faith, nourished by the Spirit of Christ, is stronger than unbelief fed by satan, and therefore the darkness soon vanishes, and the light of faith cheers the heart.—All our communion with God is maintained by faith in the blood of Christ. <HI>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us—let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith.</HI> Heb. x.19—22. It is the person and blood of Jesus, the great High Priest, that render our persons, prayers, and praises, ac∣ceptable to God; and this is the way alone in which God will meet and commune with us; nor can we enjoy any sensible, lively communion with the Fa∣ther, unless by faith we rest upon the precious blood of the Lamb; guilt will stop our mouth, fears will arise in our breast, and our spirits will stand at a sorrowful distance from God.—As God hath given
<PB N="248" REF="031228_0253_0FEB76448C49FB18"/>
us exceeding great and precious promises, on which we may rest our prayer, enjoy communion with him, and wait for the good things promised; so it is by <HI>faith</HI> that we embrace the promises, view them in Christ, who possesses the grace and glory promised, and who is engaged to make them good to all that believe. 2 Cor. i.20. It is not possible for us to enjoy communion with the Father, sepa∣rate from the Redeemer. <HI>Truly, our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</HI> To them that believe, Jesus is increasingly precious in all the sacred relations and offices he sustains; and it is the virtue of faith to lead the christian, under all his necessities, to <HI>employ</HI> Christ as his Priest, Prophet, King, and Shepherd; and thus, as he re∣ceived Christ Jesus the Lord, so he walks <HI>in</HI> him, and has the most solid peace of conscience, and hap∣piness of soul in walking <HI>with</HI> the Father—Nor is it possible that <HI>faith</HI> should be unconcerned about the influence of the Spirit of God, who implanted it in the heart. As by believing we know we have nothing, nor can we do any thing to raise our hearts to communion with God; so the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iever rests upon the Spirit to help his infirmities, testify of Christ, dictate his prayer, seal his conscience, and shed abro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the love of God in his heart. Lest we ex∣ceed the bounds allotted for this essay, we will,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="249" REF="031228_0254_0FEB764616247CD0"/>3. Proceed to enquire into the virtues of <HI>faith,</HI> in producing obedience. The scripture speaks of faith that purifieth the heart, and worketh by love, Acts xv.9. Gal. v.6. and that the gospel was preached among all nations for the <HI>obedience of faith.</HI> Rom. xvi.26. Faith creates new princi∣ples, affords the sublimest motives, and proposes the most glorious ends, on which an immortal soul can act before God and man. God is our most gracious, everlasting Father, and we obey his will, not as slaves, but as his adopted children. Christ hath bought us with his precious blood, and we yield ourselves to him as our Sovereign, Lord, and King. Introduced by grace into his spiritual king∣dom, we receive from his hand THE LAW OF FAITH, Rom. iii.27. the <HI>gospel,</HI> sanctioned by his divine authority, and inforced by his redeeming love. In this law is contained every precept essen∣tial to our walk with God, the worship due to his name, the government of ourselves, our conduct in the world, our conflict with our enemies, and our fellowship with the saints. So far from the possession of faith leading men into neglect and licentiousness, it is the spring to every good word and work; for, as it hath been often said, "He that hath St. Paul's <HI>faith</HI> will never fail to prac∣tise St. James's <HI>works.</HI>" The christian firmly be∣lieves
<PB N="250" REF="031228_0255_0FEB7647AF7FC658"/>
that there can be no precept which the wis∣dom of his Saviour enjoins in the law of faith, that can be trivial and unnecessary; therefore his obe∣dience is universal, and, with David, <HI>he has re∣spect unto all God's testimonies.</HI> The virtues of faith produce the highest pleasures and cheerfulness in obedience—It is my Father's command—my Sa∣viour's love constrains—it is connected with my character—it may promote the happiness of another, and display the honour of my Lord; therefore, with an enlarged heart I will run the way of his commands, and think myself happy to obey. <HI>Let us then hold fast the profession of our faith with∣out wavering, for he is faithful that promised: and let us consider one another unto love and good works; for herein is our Father glorified, that we bear much fruit.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. As the Lord's are a poor and an afflicted people, they need a <HI>Faith,</HI> whose virtues shall bear them above their deepest sorrows. The believer has trials in common with other men; and he has afflictions peculiar to himself, the chief of which are found within his own breast. As a disciple of Christ, he believes his Lord and Master has wisely allotted a <HI>cross,</HI> for the exercise of his faith, the trial of his patience, and the proof of his sincerity, and therefore it is with cheerfulness he takes it up.
<PB N="251" REF="031228_0256_0FEB76498CE83300"/>
The word of God contains many salutary cordials for suffering christians, and shews them, that, how∣ever severe, they spring from a Father's love, and are designed to promote their real interest. <HI>Belov∣ed, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing had happened unto you; but rejoice, in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</HI> 1 Pet. iv.12.13. <HI>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.</HI> Rom. viii.28. Afflictions brighten, manifest, and improve the virtues of faith; and faith makes afflictions fruitful of real good, al∣ways to the soul, and frequently to the body. It is as an anchor to the soul, keeping it quiet in the bosom of the Father's love, that, however long and severe, the storm shall produce a brighter sky, and make him more humble, patient, watchful, obedi∣ent, and happy. He believes there is no rod held in his Father's hand without honey at the end—no cross without a crown—nor crown without a cross. The darker the providence, the more intricate the path; and the more violent the opposition, the greater is the opportunity for faith to discover its intrinsic virtue. It will hang upon Christ in the midst of a wreck—it will trust him when he seems to have
<PB N="252" REF="031228_0257_0FEB7651CC92DB58"/>
forsaken—it will always shine the brightest when there is the least objects of sense to surround it— it will draw consolation from the ancient transac∣tions of God in eternity, and look forward with transport to futurity. It is impossible to enumerate or to estimate the virtues of faith! It however shines brightest in the furnace: there can be no sight so honourable to God, so gratifying to the be∣holder, and so convicting to the eye of infidelity, as to see a christian stripped of the creature, yet full of love to the Creator; surrounded with thick darkness, yet light in the Lord; walking on the borders of despair, yet believing in hope against hope, that every event shall terminate to the honour of God and the real happiness of himself!</P>
<P N="5">5. If such are the virtues of <HI>faith</HI> to a christian in life, they must be superior in the article of death. Of the long list of ancient worthies contained in the 11th of Hebrews, it is said, <HI>these all died in faith!</HI> To profess faith is easy; to possess faith is a blessing which none but God can give; to die in faith, is to enjoy more peace, and more happiness than ten thousand worlds can bestow; and which can only be exceeded by the full possession of the glories of immortality! If by faith all things were discovered in their true colours, and felt in their due weight of influence upon the mind in life, much
<PB N="253" REF="031228_0258_0FEB765395357568"/>
more so the nature, appendages, and end of death become visible, and all things around now become truly solemn! By faith the dying christian takes a view of Death, clad in all his native horrors, lead∣ing mankind to an awful state of punishment due to their transgressions; feels the sentence within him∣self, and drops the silent tear—Then looks on Christ, who has conquered Death, and perfumed the grave with his own blessed body, and from a lively faith of interest in him cries, "This God is my God, and he shall be my guide even through death!—Though flesh and heart fail, the Lord shall be the strength of my life and my portion forever! —I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to se∣parate me from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus my Lord!" Nor does faith yield its virtues only in the immediate article of dying: No—
<Q><L>"<HI>Faith</HI> builds a bridge across the gulph of Death,</L>
<L>To break the shock blind Nature connot shun,</L>
<L>And leads Thought smoothly on the farther shore.</L>
<L>Death's terror is the mountain <HI>Faith</HI> removes;</L>
<L>That mountain barrier between man and peace.</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Faith</HI> disarms Destruction, and absolves</L>
<L>From ev'ry clam'rous charge, the guiltless tomb.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="031228_0259_0FEB76552F0483A8"/>It brings to view the glories of immortality, and assures the conscience of after bliss. <HI>He that be∣lieveth on the Son hath everlasting life.</HI>—He knows it is secured in Christ; that Christ hath pro∣mised it; thousands have died in anticipation of it, and he rests in hope the blessing shall be his. <HI>He dies in faith</HI>; leaves a testimony of faith behind him for the comfort and establishment of others: but O! who can describe the virtues of faith in bearing the soul above the pangs of mortality?—Who can paint the prospect which faith affords beyond the vale?— He drops his clay, and mounts on high, <HI>to be forever with the Lord.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my child, you may think so, and I am happy you have such thoughts; but, myself and others, who have got mid-way the ocean of life, have found the advantage of a guide for our youth, and a staff for our years. So extremely short are many of the vicissitudes of life, one needs something more than mortal to prepare us for them, and preserve us in a virtuous path. How often does the mariner sit with ease at his helm, the gentle gale fills the sheets, and his cheerful heart hails his port in view!—but, the wind shifts, the tide turns, the clouds lower, and, in a little while, his bark is dash∣ed with the storm, and nought but death appears! Such, such are the changes of our lives, from health to sickness, pleasure to pain—prosperity to adversity;
<PB N="258" REF="031228_0263_0FEB7662495A4598"/>
these frequently alternate, till, at last, arrives the great change from life to death! O happy those who have stood the storm and tempest, at last, by faith in Christ, arrive at the port of everlasting bliss! But these re∣flections have somewhat diverted one from a parti∣cular piece of instruction, necessary to your present stage of life.</P>
<P>In social life, next to be esteemed to the blessings of grace, is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onourable connection in marriage. Entering into such a relation, either hazards, or promotes our happiness in passing over the ocean of time, and generally has a very considerable influ∣ence upon our morals. To marry only for beauty, is to purchase a house for the nose-gay in its win∣dow, which must soon fade, and probably prove ob∣noxious to its possessor. To marry only for riches, is to deceive our own passions, and eventually makes us poor indeed. Our own affections too often de∣ceive us in common things; and therefore, in such an important connection as this, the utmost delibera∣tion and care are absolutely necessary, infinitely more so than that yonder mariner, who ploughs the ocean, should first have ascertained the stability of his vessel, before he put to sea. The safest way is to seek direction from that adored Saviour, who vouchsafed his presence at a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and we may be certain, that marriage
<PB N="259" REF="031228_0264_0FEB76656DAE36C0"/>
promises little moral felicity, where Jesus is not invited as a guest; as pious bishop Hall says, "Those that marry IN Christ, cannot marry WITHOUT him." This was the basis on which my connection was formed with your honoured father, and has often been to me a source of pleas∣ing reflection;—it has supported us both under ma∣ny severe domestic trials, and still affords us the highest gratification. And you, my child—Ah! here comes your brother James—I must therefore say no more upon this delicate subject.—Well, James, are you come to share with us in survey∣ing the beauties of the ocean?</P>

The Strep∣siceros, or Creton sheep, has strait carinated horns, twisted in a spiral manner. It is a native of Mount Iola. The sheep is the most harmless, and yet most exposed to danger of all other animals. It may be esteemed one of Nature's great gifts to man∣kind; its flesh is excellent food, and its fleece high∣ly, beneficial for cloathing. The property of the ancients principally consisted of sheep and other animals! Job, after his affliction, had no less than fourteen thousand sheep.</P>
<P>SHEEP, from their obedience to their shepherd, their patience under suffering, their proneness to wander, their exposure to enemies, and their profit∣ableness to mankind, are used in the sacred scrip∣tures to disignate those happy souls who were bought with the blood, and called by the voice of Jesus Christ our CHIEF SHEPHERD, and placed by him in the fold of his church to feed in the pas∣tures of his unsearchable grace.—LAMBS, the young of the sheep, from their tenderness, activi∣ty, meekness, innocence, and defencelessness, are
<PB N="263" REF="031228_0268_0FEB767285C0D2F8"/>
equally descriptive of those young converts whom Peter was commanded to <HI>feed</HI>; and whom, accord∣ing to prophecy, Christ, the good Shepherd, <HI>gathers with his arm, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rries in his bosom.</HI></P>
<P>It is our intention, in this piece of Natural His¦tory, to contemplate the <HI>Lamb</HI> which the volum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of revelation exhibits as a lively emblem of Jesu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ, the LAMB OF GOD, <HI>who taketh away the sin of the world</HI>; John. i.29.—The <HI>Lamb</HI> which Abraham told Isaac, his son, <HI>God would provide himself for a burnt offering.</HI> Gen. xxii.7, 8.— Under this emblem Messiah has been known in all ages. He was <HI>the Lamb slain from the foun∣dation of the world</HI>; decreed so to be, and per∣petually exhibited as such through successive pe∣riods, until he shed his blood for men. Rev. xiii.8. This, probably, therefore, was the creature slain, the skin of which <HI>the Lord God made coats and clothed</HI> our first disobedient parents, to teach them the necessity of a sacrifice; and, that righteousness, procured by HIM, who was <HI>to bruise the serpent's head,</HI> that they might be justified with God.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the <HI>Lamb,</HI> selected by the ex∣press command of the Almighty, to be the victim sacrificed, to secure the Hebrews when the destroy∣ing angel was commissioned to smite the first born of Egypt, and to form the supper for those who
<PB N="264" REF="031228_0269_0FEB7677483B3168"/>
were to pass over the Red Sea, did, in a very cir∣cumstantial manner, typify the blessed Jesus, and the rich benefits of his grace. An expositor, who cannot be mistaken, has given us this interpreta∣tion of that remarkable ceremony: <HI>Christ, our Passover, is sacrificed for us.</HI> 1 Cor. v.7. De∣claring, hereby, that Christ is a <HI>real</HI> sacrifice; that he was <HI>prefigured</HI> in this capacity, by the Paschal Lamb; that the circumstances which distinguished it met in him; and the <HI>advantages</HI> which result∣ed from it flowed through him.</P>
<P>The name of this celebrated feast <HI>Pascha,</HI> Pass∣over, because the angel of the Lord <HI>passed over</HI> the doors of the Israelites, on seeing the posts thereof sprinkled with the blood of the Lamb; evangelically it points to the great feast of the gospel. God, passing over the offences of his people, through the complete satisfaction by the blood of Jesus Chirst.—The Lamb was <HI>to be taken from the sheep, or from the goats</HI>; Jesus <HI>was made a partaker of flesh and blood,</HI> and, <HI>in all things like unto his brethren</HI>; yet, <HI>sepa∣rated</HI> from them in his designation to the office of a Mediator, in the miraculousness of his Incarnation, and in his performing the great work of redemption alone.—The Paschal Lamb was <HI>without blemish:</HI> such was the Lamb of God, free from all taint of original sin, and from every spot of actual transgres∣sion;
<PB N="265" REF="031228_0270_0FEB767A6C8FDA28"/>
he was <HI>holy, harmless, undefiled</HI>; and, <HI>through the eternal Spirit, he offered himself without spot to God.—A Lamb of the first year,</HI> in all the sprightliness and beauty of youth; Christ also laid down his life, not when worn out with age, or de∣bilitated with sickness, but in the very prime of his days, amidst all the bloom of health, and all the vi∣gour of manhood, that this tender, precious Lamb may prove the sweetest food for the believing soul; and to testify that his sacrifice is of perpetual effi∣cacy.—Nor is it without meaning that the Lamb was, for the space of <HI>four days,</HI> separated from the fold; for thus also it was with Christ, if we reckon prophetic days for years. Ezek. iv.6. At his <HI>thirti∣eth</HI> year he left his mother's house, as a fold, where he was born and brought up, and was crucified the <HI>fourth</HI> after. But it likewise deserves observation, that Christ came to Jerusalem to the feast, and to his last passover, on that very day on which God had commanded the Lamb to be kept up in Egypt, the tenth of the month Nisan. For six days before the passover, he came to Bethany, John xii.1. that is, on the ninth of the month Nisan: the day after he went to Jerusalem, ver. 11. to present himself to be offered to God.— The Lamb was to be slain in such a manner as might occasion the most copious effusion of blood;
<PB N="266" REF="031228_0271_0FEB767BF76B58F0"/>
and was not this very exactly fulfilled in our suffer∣ing Saviour? On sight of that CUP of indignation he came to drink, blood issued from every vein, and fell in vast drops upon <HI>Gathsamane's</HI> ground! the rending lashes of the <HI>scourge</HI>; the lacerating points of <HI>thorns</HI>; the rugged <HI>nails</HI> which pierced his hands and his feet; the deadly <HI>spear</HI> which ripped his side, and made way to his heart; these, these were the ways through which his most precious blood flow∣ed, to wash away our stains.—Though the blood was to be so copiously shed, <HI>a bone</HI> of the Lamb <HI>was not to be broken</HI>; a circumstance this which a wonderful, interposing Providence directed. The soldiers had received their commission to <HI>break the legs</HI> of the three crucified persons. When they had actually broken the legs of each malefactor which hung on the right side of our Lord and on his left, their minds were over-ruled to spare the blessed Je∣sus, and to leave his bones untouched.—The Lamb was to be killed <HI>before the whole assembly</HI>; and did not the whole multitude of the Jews conspire against our Redeemer to put him to death? Did they not all, with one voice, cry, <HI>Crucify him, crucify him?</HI> Was he not put to death at one of their grand festi∣vals, and in the sight of the whole assembled nation? The <HI>blood</HI> was not to be poured heedlessly upon the ground, but received carefully into a bason,
<PB N="267" REF="031228_0272_0FEB767D8DA79EE8"/>
and <HI>sprinkled</HI> with the utmost punctuality <HI>upon the door posts.</HI> In like manner the blood of this pre∣cious Lamb was to be realized in heaven, and to be received by an humble faith, and applied to our consciences.—The sprinkling of the blood of that Lamb secured every Israelite from the destroying angel's sword; and the blood of Jesus Christ <HI>cleans∣eth from all sin,</HI> and saves us from the pains of eternal death.—The Lamb was to be <HI>roasted with fire,</HI> and the soul of Christ suffered the fire of divine anger against sin; so that, according to David, <HI>his heart was like wax, melted in the midst of his bow∣els!</HI>—As the blood of the Paschal Lamb was the peace and preservation of the Hebrews, so they were to <HI>eat the whole flesh, and</HI> none <HI>of it was to remain until the morning:</HI> thus the Lord Christ hath not only made peace by the blood of his cross, but hath given <HI>his flesh for the life of the world; his flesh is meat indeed</HI>—more nourishing to our souls than the delicious flesh of the tender lamb is to our bodies; and, <HI>whosoever eateth thereof hath everlasting life.</HI> Not a part only, but the whole of this precious Lamb of God is embraced by faith: his person, obedience, life, death, grace, and offices, form the delightful food of his ransomed people, so that, emphatically, he is said to be <HI>all, and in all.</HI> It must not be forgotten, that those who celebrated
<PB N="268" REF="031228_0273_0FEB76858ADE70B0"/>
the Paschal Supper, eat the Lamb with <HI>unleaven∣ed bread, and with bitter herbs; their loins were girt, their feet shod, their staff in their hands, and to eat in haste</HI>; equally those who, by faith, feed upon Christ, the slaughtered Lamb, <HI>keep the feast with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth</HI>; the bitter herbs of affliction are of real ad∣vantage to enliven and preserve the appetite of their soul, that they may feed more deliciously upon the Saviour; <HI>for, if we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him</HI>; their <HI>loins are girt about with truth</HI>; their <HI>feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace</HI>; the staff of divine <HI>Promise</HI> is held in the hand of <HI>Faith</HI>; and in their general deportment they testify that <HI>here they have no abid∣ing city, but seek one to come.</HI> The whole of this very remarkable institution was from the Lord, without the solicitation, or the merit of the He∣brew captives, to produce their temporal deliver∣ance; infinitely more so the gift of Christ, the Lamb of God, was the sole fruit of the Father's unmerited, everlasting love; to procure our liber∣ty from sin, the power of satan, the sting of death, the curse of the law, to bring us the enjoyment of God in time, and to lead us over the red sea of death to the mansions of glory in eternity.</P>
<P>We cannot omit citing that evangelic view
<PB N="269" REF="031228_0274_0FEB76877A49B508"/>
which the prophet Isaiah had of Messiah, the Lamb of God, who was to <HI>bear the sin of many. He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb. so he openeth not his mouth.</HI> liii.7. How just, how pathetic the description! Had the pro∣phet lived in Jerusalem at the very period Jesus was betrayed, by a perfidious disciple, for <HI>thirty pieces of silver,</HI> and taken to the bar of Pilate; had he stood by in the prison while the Saviour submitted to be <HI>scourged and spit upon</HI>; had he actually crowded among the murdering Jews, and followed in the mouring train to <HI>Calvary,</HI> he could not in colours more strongly have marked the solemn scene, nor described the patience, humility, and sub∣mission of the blessed Jesus under his crucifiers. But if innocence mark this distinguished Lamb, why these extreme sufferings? Let the evangelic prophet himself reply. <HI>The Lord hath lain upon him the iniquity of us all, and he bears the sin of many; thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin; therefore, it pleased the Lord to bruise him, and to put him to grief. He was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised for our ini∣quities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.</HI> PHI∣LIP,
<PB N="270" REF="031228_0275_0FEB768918D6E300"/>
a preacher of the gospel, well understood this prophecy; therefore, when the Eunuch asked him, <HI>Of whom speak the prophet this?</HI> of <HI>himself, or of some other man?</HI> Philip began at the same scripture, and preached <HI>unto him Jesus,</HI> with the most pleasurable success. Acts viii. JOHN, too, when he saw Jesus, equally understood whom he was, when he exhorted his two companions to <HI>be∣hold the Lamb of God!</HI> John i.29. All that was designed by the Paschal Lamb, and the bleeding lambs used in the daily sacrifice;—all that the pro∣phets prophesied of Messiah, centre in this lamb, emphatically called the LAMB OF GOD;—of his own nature, of his own providing, of his own sa∣crificing, and of his own accepting! O for the light of faith, to behold this adored Lamb in all the excellence of his nature, and to enjoy him in all the virtues of his sacrifice! O for an heart to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, in the vicissitudes of his providence, the institutions of his grace, and the delightful precepts of his lips!</P>
<P>If the contemplation of the Lamb at the <HI>slaughter</HI> creates such solemn sensations; let us, by aid of the scriptures, behold him glorified upon his throne. JOHN was favoured with this august sight, and he informs us—<HI>In the midst of the throne, and of the four beings, and in the midst of the elders,
<PB N="271" REF="031228_0276_0FEB768AA6593320"/>
stood a lamb as it had been slain.</HI> Rev. v.6. He that was slaughtered on Mount Calvary, for sin, is now enthroned on Mount Zion, to reign in glo∣ry! O happy subjects of his celestial dominion!— They behold him <HI>worthy to open the seals of the book of life,</HI> and of divine decrees. v.2.—They stand before the throne in spotless purity, having <HI>washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; and serve him day and night in his temple; they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</HI> vii.17. &amp;c. They no longer see through a glass darkly, but face to face. No stormy cloud to fill their sky; nor do they dwell in temples made with hands, but exult in that glorious state <HI>where no temple exists; for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the tem∣ple of it; the glory of God enlightens it, and the Lamb is the light of it.</HI> xxi.22, 23. From such high enjoyments, no wonder they are filled with rapture, crying, <HI>Hallelujah, for the Lord God Almighty reigneth! Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wis∣dom,
<PB N="272" REF="031228_0277_0FEB7692932DCA40"/>
and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing, for ever and ever!</HI></P>

<P>HAVING attempted, in No. V. page 222, to describe the several stages of a revolting christian, and the aggravations of his conduct; agreeably to my promise I shall, in this paper, enumerate some of those means by which the GOOD SHEPHERD restores his wandering sheep, and the sensibility which such experience on their return.</P>
<P>It is an unspeakable mercy to us, that God hath said, <HI>I will set mine eyes upon them for good;— I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be my people, and I will
<PB N="274" REF="031228_0279_0FEB7696394358F8"/>
be their God; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.</HI> Jer. xxiv.6, 7. Those eyes pervade our path, and penetrate the inmost recesses of our hearts; not to pursue us with deserved judg∣ment, but to overcome us with his unbounded mercy! That adored Saviour who hath purchas∣ed his people with his most precious blood, <HI>deviseth means that his banished people be not expelled from him.</HI> 2 Sam. xiv.14. These means are wisely adapted to the end, and never fail to bring the wanderer home with tears.</P>
<P>The ministers of the gospel are commanded to go, and proclaim these words—<HI>Return, thou back∣sliding Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you, for I am mer∣ciful, saith the Lord; and I will not keep anger for ever. Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God, and have not obeyed my voice, saith the Lord. Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord, for I am married unto you.</HI> Jer. iii.12, 13, 14. The soul of disobedient David was brought to a sensibility of its shameful guilt, and awful departure from the Lord, by a message sent by Nathan the prophet—<HI>Thou art the man.</HI> 2 Sam. xii.7. Mi∣nisters are faithfully to declare unto revolting pro∣fessors, that <HI>their own wickedness shall correct
<PB N="275" REF="031228_0280_0FEB769B021F0F70"/>
them, and their own backslidings shall reprove them</HI>;—that such should deeply <HI>know, and see, that it is an evil thing, and a bitter, that they have forsaken the Lord their God, and that his fear is not in them, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</HI> Jer. ii.19. By so doing God often conveys an arrow of conviction to the heart, opens its guilt, produces repentance, and restores the backslider to the sensi∣ble enjoyment of his smiles.</P>
<P>Affliction is another mean by which the wan∣derer is frequently restored. <HI>If his children for∣sake my law, and walk not in my judgment; if they break my statutes, and keep not my command∣ments, then will I visit their transgressions with the rod, and their iniquities with stripes. Ne∣vertheless, my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</HI> Psa. lxxxix.3. God hath many rods; and al∣though they be held in a Father's hands, and honey be at the end of every twig, yet they are calculated to make the disobedient feel. According to the complexion of the mind, the wanderings of the heart, and the errors of the life, will be the se∣verity of the chastisement; <HI>the fruit of all is to take away sin.</HI> Isa. xxvii.9. God's dealing with Israel, recorded in the second and thirteenth chap∣ters of Hosea, should be solemn warnings to a re∣volting
<PB N="276" REF="031228_0281_0FEB769C8ADD6328"/>
christian. Although in the midst of pros∣perity, and reclining upon the lap of ease, God can, by a variety of providences, and by unexpected means, <HI>hedge up your way with thorns,</HI> and <HI>make a wall,</HI> that you should not <HI>find your path. God's furnace is in Zion, and his fire in Jerusalem.</HI> Isa. xxxi.9. purposely to try and refine his own people from their dross. Remember, it is not any <HI>fire,</HI> any <HI>furnace,</HI> nor any <HI>affliction,</HI> that will an∣swer the purpose of reclaiming a backslider; but it is God's fire, which he kindles in faithfulness, love, and mercy; and which will, sooner or later, humble the proud heart, and bring the transgressor to the Lord. Afflictions in themselves do but irri∣tate, harden, and produce rebellion; but God's chastisement shall heal as well as wound; for, saith the Lord concerning the revolting christian, <HI>I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him, and to his mourners.</HI> Isa. lviii.18. For this very purpose Christ <HI>sits as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.</HI> Mal. iii.3. Remember he sits to watch the gold in the furnace, and to regulate the heat. In proportion to the state of the mind shall be the severity of the fire of af∣fliction;
<PB N="277" REF="031228_0282_0FEAF870C01B3CA8"/>
and Christ frequently employs satan, wick∣ed men, and hypocrites, skillful to afflict, to bring <HI>fuel</HI> to the furnace. Ah, Christian! sooner than your heart shall remain in a cold, stupid, prayerless, disobedient state, the furnace shall be made seven times hotter than it was wont to be made. Your being a subject of redeeming grace does not screen you from suffering, nor gives you indulgence in sin∣ful sloth; but, on the contrary, God will not suffer you long to remain in this state: for, whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth; and those who are practically acquainted with a life of faith, know, that as sure as they revolt from God in the frame of their hearts, and in the duties of the gospel, an affliction of some sort awaits them, to convince them of their folly.— The Prodigal left his father with apparent satisfac∣tion; but a famine was produced, and brought him back again, weeping, to his father's arms.</P>
<P>Sometimes the very object, means, or temptation by which a person was induced to revolt from God, is, by an over-ruling providence, made the means of restoration. The very idols which may have engrossed your affections and decoyed your feet astray, shall either be dashed in pieces before your eyes, or they shall be suffered to remain as thorns in your sides, and spears in your heart, to convince you
<PB N="278" REF="031228_0283_0FEB76A1552F0110"/>
of your folly in departing from the Lord. Spiritual idolatry is one of the grossest sins, and never fails to lead the mind into ten thousand evils, before we are aware. God is a jealous God over the people loves; he will not suffer a rival to remain long in their hearts; and he will cast them out, and make us mourn with bitterness for our folly. David loved Absolam inordinately, therefore Absolam shall usurp his father's throne, and prove an arrow in his father's heart. Solomon knew, by his own bitter experi∣ence, that, <HI>the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways.</HI> Prov. xiv.14. God can sufficiently punish his own disobedient children with∣out sending them to hell; for he can send an <HI>hell</HI> into them;—he can open the great deep of their own hard hearts; bring them to a recollection of their conduct; shew them the aggravations of their sin, and make them loath themselves for their abo∣minations against him. They are thus filled with remorse; they arise in indignation against themselves; their wounds gape wide; and they feel the need of a physician's balm. Repentance flows from a broken heart, and faith again ventures upon the promise. <HI>He will turn again: He will have compassion upon us. Thou wilt subdue our iniquities, and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</HI> Mic. vii.19. From this persuasion the soul
<PB N="279" REF="031228_0284_0FEB76A7BA6F3A80"/>
returns again by prayer; finds God faithful to his promise, and receives the pledges of redeeming love.</P>
<P>It is not unusual with God to restore his wan∣dering people, by the secret communication of HIM∣SELF, without the use of any visible means. <HI>The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.</HI> Luke xxii.61. It was enough; his heart dissolved; he remembered his sin;—ashamed and confounded, he retired, and wept. When the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS arises upon the wanderer's mind, those sins which were committed with little conviction, now keenly im∣press the heart.—He feels the darkness of his mind; regrets his extreme distance from the sensible pre∣sence of the Lord, and adopts the language of David —<HI>Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy</HI> HOLY SPIRIT <HI>from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free spirit.</HI> Ps. li.11, 12. God secretly ex∣postulates with the soul,—<HI>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me?</HI> Mic. vi.3. All the tender feelings of the soul are awakened; he ap∣proaches the Lord, who secretly whispers peace, sheds abroad his love within the heart, and fixes its standing more secure than it was before it fell.</P>
<P>The sensibility of a reclaimed Christian is ex∣tremely great. His soul abhors the sins, and shud∣ders
<PB N="280" REF="031228_0285_0FEB76AAE8A13EC0"/>
at the path which led his feet astray;—he deep∣ly laments his distance from God, and the spiritual decay which such perfidious conduct has produced in his soul. He no longer triumphs over the im∣perfections and miscarriages of others, but culti∣vates towards them the most tender compassion. He now proves the sovereignty of grace, and the preciousness of God's love, that preserved his soul from hell, and brought him back with joy. He no longer trusts the attainments of his mind, nor the feelings of his heart; but puts his trust alone in the protection of the Almighty. His views of Christ are more brilliant; his faith in him is more firm; and his love towards him is more ardent. It is impossible fully to describe the fine feelings of such a man's soul. Sufficient to say, it is the work of God, and worthy its Almighty Author. We learn from it, that God hates sin e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en in his own people; and in their restoration, he makes them feel its bitterness before he gladdens their hearts with his smiles. Let none, therefore, presume; let none despair. Happy, unspeakably happy are they who can sing of restoring mercy—live in sweet∣est union with a God of love; and, by faith, anti∣cipate the bright prospect of eternity, where they shall be admitted to the immediate presence of God and the Lamb; never, never more to wander fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beneath his shadow, but resound his praise for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<L>Man leap'd the scale. It mounted. "<HI>On my word,</HI>"</L>
<L><HI>(Said Justice,)</HI> "less than nothing!—where's my sword?"</L>
<L>VIRTUE was there, and her small weight would try.</L>
<L>The scale, unsunk, still kick'd the beam on high.</L>
<L>MERCY, the whitest dove that ever flew,</L>
<L>From CALV'RY fetch'd a twig of crimson hue:</L>
<L>Aloft it sent the scale on t'other side.</L>
<L>MAN smil'd: and JUSTICE own'd,—"<HI>I'm satisfied.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL>EUXENE.</BIBL>
