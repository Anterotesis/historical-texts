<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I sat down to collect the particulars of the fol∣lowing work, the uncommon success of which stimulates me to a continu∣ation, which will be ready for my numerous readers in a short time, I examined every character introduced with the equitable eye of justice. When I exhibited them to the in∣spection of those powerful members of society, Genius and Friendship, I was led to think the colouring beau∣tiful, and the execution every way characteristically just. Since then it
<PB N="iv" REF="017808_0003_0FA319CAC3C4E3B8"/>
has found its way to the public tri∣bunal, where the former illustrious character will pay no attention to the magic eloquence of the latter.— I have been told my strictures on Mr. Garrick are beneath the pen that ex∣ecuted the foregoing part of the work: to this it would be idle to pay any attention, while my assertions are founded in truth. — If those elevated admirers of Mr. G. who will not think him any other than the paragon of perfection, while his great pow∣ers ennobled the dramatic muse, will take the trouble of scrutinizing his conduct, as Manager and Dramatic Reviewer, and leave husband, bro∣ther, friend, out of the question, they will not think me divested of feeling, nor brand me as the distur∣ber
<PB N="v" REF="017808_0004_0FA319CB85C4FD60"/>
of his renowned manes. Mr. Garrick's dramatic fame I bow down to with as much reverence, as the warmest idolater at his shrine; but detest with the majority of mankind, his parsimonious principles; nor will I think the gift of two guineas to the best pastoral poet of this age, nor the bequest of a rotten building to his veteran brothers of the sock and bus∣kin, monuments of benevolence, and of a soul of extraordinary feeling.— I looked for the best information in the delineation of every character, and the general voice told me I found it.</P>
<P>I assure the candid reader, a de∣generacy of soul I have been ever a stranger to; and though I do not
<PB N="vi" REF="017808_0005_0FA319CC458FC460"/>
expect to die worth a hundred thou∣sand pounds, I am not hopeless that my grave will not be honoured with the tear of friendship, as warm and sincerely flowing, as if I had died the first favourite of Plutus.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The TWO LADIES.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THIS is the most fashionable Coach on the stand,</Q> says a pretty young lady, stepping into me, with all the hilarity of soul that distin∣guishes the cheerful children of pros∣perity; after whom followed an elder∣ly lady her mother. <Q>This Coach,</Q> says the old lady, <Q>from its neat ap∣pearance, was never intended for a Hack, I am positive: No doubt it was,
<PB N="2" REF="017808_0011_0FA319D0C7D47C70"/>
in its primitive state the vehicle of pride and presumption; but finding
<Q>Their faint means would not grant continuance.</Q>
were obliged to dispose of it for half the money it cost them, before they had soiled the pannels.</Q> <Q>'Tis very like, Mamma; there are such a num∣ber of coach-going gentry in this ca∣pital now a-days, that people of dis∣tinction are puzzled to discover the Baronet of Grosvenor-square from the aspiring cheesemonger of Fish-street∣hill. 'Tis surprising some of those li∣terary beings do not give us <HI>The Ad∣ventures of a Hackney Coach</HI>; I am sure there is an extensive field for a fertile genius, and no contemptible one: We have <HI>The Adventures of a Guinea,</HI> a most entertaining work; and similar adventures, full of fancy and instruction. It is one hour the seat of pleasure; the next, of anxiety: In∣cidents

innumerable it is daily a wit∣ness of:—Disappointment often steps into it from a great man's levee with a heart full of anguish; pleasure takes a juant to Vauxhall with the syren of his ruin: The nuptial pair to be mar∣ried; the disconsolate maid to her lo∣ver's funeral. In short, I don't know adventures, if naturally related, would prove a higher source of pleasure to the generality of readers.</Q></P>
<P>Thy wishes my fair companion, shall be from this day, which is the first of my setting out, complied with; I have no doubt from my present ele∣gant appearance, of being speedily acquainted with the various characters of life; and of putting into thy hands in a few years, a repository of enter∣tainment and instruction, as full as the <HI>Bath Machine</HI> that has just passed me.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="017808_0013_0FA319D245A192F8"/>
Before I introduce any of the cha∣racters I mean to exhibit to my rea∣der, I must beg leave to introduce my</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ORIGIN.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS made by a distinguished Coach-maker, of Great Queen∣street, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, for Mr. M—, a very worthy merchant in Thread-needle-street, who acquired a considerable property, by an early and intense application to commercial bu∣siness. He had as great a soresight of future events as most speculative men; could decypher a man of small capital and great appearance, whom he ge∣nerally called a cracker; shook hands with the first merchants on the Royal Exchange, and was ever foremost in all their cabinet councils. As he had
<PB N="5" REF="017808_0014_0FA319D3057D1EF0"/>
a rising family he was circumspect even in trifles; studied little else than how to acquire a provision to shield them from the winter of adversity. Notwithstanding all this sagacity, he trusted as much to appearances, where riches centered, as his unthinking neighbours; and by the failure of that plunderer F—e, this laborious son of industry, and his darling family, were bereft of the honest harvest of many toiling years. At the time of this national calamity, I was at his little villa at Clapham Common, with his wife and children, who mostly resided there.</P>
<P>When Rumour, the harbinger of these dreadful tidings arrived, the ge∣nius of misery only could express the horror that ran through the family; which was scarcely felt, before the
<PB N="6" REF="017808_0015_0FA319D3C3C8F2C8"/>
unfortunate wreck himself arrived with the confirmation.</P>
<P>He entered the back part of his garden and retired to an arbour, where he and his little family used often to assemble—to hide the bitter∣ness of his affliction.</P>
<P>He did not remain long in this si∣tuation, when his wife and children came to pour the balm of consolation into his bleeding bosom. His eldest daughter, with surprising fortitude suppressed her anguish, while she be∣gan to chase from his tortured ima∣gination, the approaching spirit of despair.</P>
<P><Q>You know my dear Papa,</Q> says she, with the endearing tenderness of youthful affection, <Q>when Lady No∣table did us the honor of a visit last, how very much she admired my em∣broidery, placed it in as flattering a
<PB N="7" REF="017808_0016_0FA319D483AFAE08"/>
point of view as the ingenious and un∣rivalled Mrs. Wright's. My brother Billy's minatures are much admired likewise: I have now a very good likeness, neatly executed of the Du∣chess of —; Lady Notable shewed it to her, and she admires it highly: She is a good creature,—I will make her a present of it; she will be a friend to us, my dear Papa, and will recommend me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is no fear, between my brother and I, but we will realize something to begin the world anew.—</Q></P>
<P><Q>This little villa belongs to my uncle, who often told me we should reside here, if we wanted his assistance; he too will be generous; for you know he calls my Mamma his darling sister.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We will retrench all our super∣fluities, and live like our primitive pa∣rents, when there were no F—s</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017808_0017_0FA319D544D47EF8"/>He pressed the little charmer to his bosom; and desired her brothers and sisters to do the same; after which he rose, with his wife in one hand, and she in the other, and walked into the house.</P>
<P>A few days after I was driven to the coachmakers, where I was made but two months before; who told my master he would settle with him next morning; when he generously re∣turned the original price.</P>
<P>I did not remain long in this situ∣ation, when I was purchased by a Hackney-man, of Oxford-street; who had me numbered and sent to his stand next day in Piccadilly.</P>
<P>I remained but a few minutes here, when I took up</P>

<HEAD>AN OLD OFFICER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a Character, of all o∣thers, I have the highest re∣spect for; but more so, since I heard the story of Captain Shandy and Le Fevre, which was read by a sensible gentleman, a companion of my old master's at Clapham, who often de∣lighted him with his excellent compa∣ny, with a good book, his constant companion. We have made many little excursions round London; in all of which he has amused him highly with the best literary works, and his own sensible observations.</P>
<P>This venerable veteran was accom∣panied by his wife, the patient and loving partner of his life, in many a hostile clime: Old as they were, their
<PB N="10" REF="017808_0019_0FA319D6C3DE2490"/>
satiety did not cease from military pleasures, for they desired they might be taken to</P>

<HEAD>THE REVIEW IN HYDE-PARK.</HEAD>
<P>PHOEBUS was in his utmost splendor and pleasure diffused the happy tidings to all her children within the vicinity of London. The Park was uncommonly crouded— The KING and his amiable CONSORT had just arrived and were receiving the royal salute as we got up to the lines. Harmony took her seat in the soul and all was charmed attention for some minutes.—</P>
<P><Q>Well EMILY,</Q> says the veteran, <Q>how do you like the troops?</Q> <Q>They make a very noble appearance,</Q>says she, worthy the admiration of their Royal Master and the warriors in his
<PB N="11" REF="017808_0020_0FA319D7F1A8FF58"/>
train: It brings to my recollection some pretty lines I once met in a poem but little known, written in compli∣ment to General WOLFE, on the con∣quest of Quebec; and may very pro∣perly be introduced here:
<Q><L>To the shrill numbers of the martial fife</L>
<L>They move harmonious.—O! 'tis fine to see</L>
<L>Firm virtue and united vigour;— he</L>
<L>Darts his experienc'd eye along the files,</L>
<L>Observes their warm alacrity and smiles.</L></Q></P>
<P><Q>Very happily observed,</Q> says he, the KING is fond of his soldiers and waits for a glorious opportunity to shew our perfidious enemies and his admiring countrymen, the spirit and intrepidity of his renowned grandfa∣ther and the immortal WOLFE.</P>
<P>"Observe that Hero on the right hand of his Sovereign, the valiant and successful Amherst; what perils has he
<PB N="12" REF="017808_0021_0FA319D846A4A730"/>
not encounter'd for his thankful coun∣try, near half an age in her service with unsullied honor! highly beloved and gratefully rewarded.—On his left, behold the happy heir of eternal honor, the offspring of the glorious Granby! Methinks I see thee, blissful Spirit! with a branch from thy palm of victory binding his youthful brows! hear thee tell him, when his country calls to remember thy unshaken loy∣alty and victorious fame; the soldiers view him with paternal fondness tra∣cing delighted in his youthful coun∣tenance the lines of valor and huma∣nity! Happy youth! mayst thou sink to the grave with the same weeping honors on thy hearse, thy father's spirit found on his.</P>
<P>"Beside him stands that brave offi∣cer Townsend, with all the soldier in his appearance! he is just returned from
<PB N="13" REF="017808_0022_0FA319D9068D0850"/>
the government of that kingdom that knew not how to prize his liberality till it lost him: He fought with the spirit of Hannibal, when his brave counryman dropped at Quebec! and highly deserves every honour his ge∣nerous Prince bestowed on him.</P>
<P>"The greatest military monarch in the world, immortal Prussia is not surrounded by braver heroes.</P>
<P>"Let us retire; the KING is lea∣ving the field." I left this happy cou∣ple at their habitation, wishing them that serene repose attendant on felicity,</P>
<P>A few days after I attended</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AN OFFICER's FUNERAL.</HEAD>
<P>IT was one of those cheerless morn∣ings, when the sun withdrew his enlivening beams from the heavy at∣mosphere
<PB N="14" REF="017808_0023_0FA319D9C5DDA1F8"/>
of London, that I was or∣dered out very early to attend the fu∣neral of an officer belonging to a re∣giment in America; who died at his father's in Westminster.</P>
<P>My company consisted of some of his most affectionate companions, who were assembled to pay the last sad tri∣bute to their departed friend. This testimony of friendship to survivors is a pleasing momento of indubitable sincerity, notwithstanding what the children of disappointment may as∣sert to the contrary.</P>
<P>Their discourse chiefly turned on the many virtues of the deceased: His convivial disposition; amiable fidelity; and above all, the affection he bore his faithful nurse; whose husband was one of the unfortunate soldiers that fell at the battle of Bunkers-Hill; his al∣lowing her six-pence a-day out of his
<PB N="15" REF="017808_0024_0FA319DA83CBF838"/>
pay from that hour and taking her child into his protection.</P>
<P>"But see," says one of my com∣panions, "the disconsolate Theodora at her window; she has been watching the sad procession, though early;— amiable woman! how much art thou to be pitied!" She was drest in deep mourning, with her window open.— she raised her swimming eyes to hea∣ven; and as she closed them the passing breeze bore from their heavy lids a tear—and drop't it on the coffin.</P>
<P>During the momentary intervals from grief, she rested her eyes on the hearse, till it was out of sight; then sat down in the window seat and wept bitterly.</P>
<P>"This lovely woman's connection with Charles," continued he, "may not be so well known as it should be; and as I had the happiness of a closer
<PB N="16" REF="017808_0025_0FA319DB459B7C60"/>
intimacy with them both, than most others, I shall relate it.</P>
<P>"This excellent young Lady is the daughter of a Baronet in the West of England, who died some few months ago, leaving her, at her own disposal a fortune of ten thousand pounds. In a village near her residence Charles was brought up, under the inspection of his grandfather, an officer on half pay, who retired to his rural asylum after many hardships, and little else to solace old age, than a heart of in∣tegrity.</P>
<P>"Charles was the favourite of this veteran; he infused in him the virtues of the soldier and the man. The fa∣ther of the youth, observing the won∣derful progress he was making, was resolved, though dear his company was to him, to let him remain with his excellent preceptor, till he was every thing he could wish.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="017808_0026_0FA319DC04235B50"/>"In this retirement he lived till he was eighteen years old, the delight of every companion and the lover of the beauteous Theodora! The war-worn Hero was a constant visitor at the Ba∣ronet's, always accompanied by his pupil.</P>
<P>"Theodora and her maid used fre∣quently to meet them in a pathway that led from her house to the village; and by that means had an opportunity of indulging herself with the conversation of her favourite Charles.</P>
<P>"They generally let the old Gran∣by go up the avenue, while they walk∣ed through that part of the demesne that led to the back part of the house. Every one of these excursions was con∣sidered by them both as the height of human felicity; how delicious was her winning converse to the happy
<PB N="18" REF="017808_0027_0FA319DCC3D016E8"/>
Charles! every interview, their smiling genius revelled on a bed of roses.</P>
<P><Q><L>And the soft language of the soul,</L>
<L>Flowed from her never silent eye.</L></Q></P>
<P>"Charles, ere his blisses were tasted by some fortunate rival, was deter∣mined in one of those walks to unbo∣som himself to Theodora. She listened to him with the attention his virtues merited; told him to wait till next morning, and he should have her answer.</P>
<P>"Ere he was yet risen from his fan∣ciful embraces of Theodora, her maid and confidante was dispatched with the following short letter to him:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I do not doubt the sincerity of your love: I should as soon doubt my own feelings in your favor: I will break the subject to my father to
<PB N="19" REF="017808_0028_0FA319DD85A34490"/>
day; If he consents I shall be happy; if he disapproves I shall be miserable; yet, though he should, be satisfied I will be thine only, while living.</P>
<CLOSER>THEODORA".</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>"This terminated as poor Charles's fears foreboded; the connection was broke between them; the old officer ceased to visit the Baronet, and Charles had only a few mutual glances at church every Sunday to comfort him; and an ardent letter now and then, which was left in a box-tree for him by the hapless Theodora.</P>
<P>"In the last he found there, was enclosed her picture, neatly folded in a paper, with the following words: <Q>The painter's genius, however su∣blime, would convey to my fancy a faint image of my Charles, compared with that already engraved on my heart, which no time can obliterate;
<PB N="20" REF="017808_0029_0FA319DEB33DB8B8"/>
so that I desire no shadow in return for this trif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</Q>?</P>
<P>"In this vicissitude of hope and anxiety, he continued for a year after the separation; when his father drew a part of his mother's fortune from the funds, and purchased an ensigncy for him, in a regiment ordered for America shortly after. You are ac∣quainted with the rest of the story.</P>
<P>"Three years have elapsed since he left the last passionate kiss upon Theo∣dora's lips; he was every thing in the field his brave preceptor was anxious for, valiant and enterprizing. But who can turn aside the shaft of adverse fortune? he was wounded at the head of a scouting party, but not mortally.</P>
<P>"His mourning mother, when she heard the melancholy tidings, begged he would return to her arms; he was too affectionate to disobey the voice of
<PB N="21" REF="017808_0030_0FA319DF03F5AC00"/>
parental love and arrived about three months since.</P>
<P>"Theodora, whose father has been dead these nine months on hearing the state of her lover hurried up to town, to participate in his affliction; she took lodgings in the same street, that she might be near him, visited him every day, morning and evening.</P>
<P>"When he had a respite from his anguish, so as to be able to sit up, she would read by him, or tell some soothing tale. But alas! the dreadful herald of her grief arrived and de∣stroyed the prospect of her future fe∣licity; his wound turned to a morti∣fication, which deprived him of his life; and left his family inconsolable, and his lover in a state of phrenzy."</P>
<P>By this time we arrived at the Church-yard, where they left me
<PB N="22" REF="017808_0031_0FA319DFC66D33E0"/>
to join the melancholy train: Poor Charles was consigned to his clay-cold mansion; and I returned with his af∣fectionate friends to where I took them up.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE WEDDING.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS engaged a few days after to go to Westham in Essex, by an af∣fectionate couple who were desirous of tasting the joys inseparable from wed∣ded love. The bride was one of those captivating vestals that win upon the affections rather than enchant the eye; possessing that agreeable something, to be seen beautifully drest in that ad∣mired actress, Miss Brown, of Covent-garden theatre; but not in Mrs. Hart∣ley, who is a Venus de Medicis.</P>
<P>She was accompanied by two agree∣able females in neat habiliments; the bridegroom had one attendant and the
<PB N="23" REF="017808_0032_0FA319E085B9DDB8"/>
bride's father, who was a widower, was the last who took a seat with this happy assemblage.</P>
<P>Our journey was very pleasant; the young folks of the village, who had timely information of this event, were prepared with the sweets of the season made up in various forms. When the bride was handed out, she was pre∣sented with a handsome bouquet, by a comely youth; while the bride∣groom received the like favour from a sprightly lass with the countenance of Hygaeia.</P>
<P>Six feemale villagers instantly step∣ped from the throng, strewing the way with flowers till they were in the church.</P>
<P>As they returned from the altar, they were presented with a chaplet of flowers, which they were requested to preserve, while it remained together,
<PB N="24" REF="017808_0033_0FA319E1439B6A88"/>
as a testimony of the felicity they wished them.</P>
<P>The bridegroom was not behind hand in acknowledging the honor they did him, he gave them five guineas, which made them as happy as their wishes.</P>

<HEAD>THE SUICIDE.</HEAD>
<P>RETURNING from the Royal-Exchange this morning, I was stopped at the Somerset-house Coffee-house, in the Strand; where a gentle∣man, with an inimitable wildness of countenance, took a seat in me.</P>
<P>There was something so expressive of the baleful purpose he was engaged in, that I shuddered to meet the heavy lightning that shot from his frantic soul, through his tearless eye.</P>
<P>He desired he might be taken to Kentish Town. He spoke this with a manly firmness, and an emphasis of the utmost harmony at heart.</P>
<P>Wretched mortal! thought I; could nothing lure thee from the frightful verge of misery;—the freezing gulf of
<PB N="60" REF="017808_0069_0FA319FC454A9958"/>
eternity! —how many sad examples fill the tearful volume of affliction!— untune the genial heart!— and rend the bosom of serene philosophy!— Poor Werter!—thy cureless woes were too poignant for thy fortitude;—Me∣lancholy reposed her heavy head early on thy breast, and led thee her unso∣cial round, with sighs and tears thy constant companions, till the sable portal of the grave enclosed thy crim∣son corse, and sealed the eye of ge∣nius and thy hapless love with thy Charlotte's flowing sorrows.</P>
<P>My companion fixed his eyes on a croud that was approaching; there were two poor youths going to be ex∣ecuted:— he looked wistfully at them with weeping compassion.—"Thy si∣tuation, poor fellows, I cannot help feeling for!" says he, "though my own is attended with a lesser ray of hope,
<PB N="61" REF="017808_0070_0FA319FD04BE6AA0"/>
in the state I am rushing into: I shud∣der on the dreadful precipice,—but misery could not wear a more hide∣ous aspect when she feasted on the af∣flictions of wretched Ugolino, and his little victims of unparalleled cruelty, than she wears in my presence this mi∣nute!—begone, thou horrible fiend! thy bitter luxury in my cup of misery here, is just exhausted; seek some other residence, and let me enjoy one placid moment in this sad hour of calamity
<Q><L>"Oh death! thou pleasing end of human woe,</L>
<L>Tbou cure for life!—thou greatest good below!</L>
<L>Still mayst thou fly the coward and the slave,</L>
<L>And thy soft slumbers only bless the brave."</L></Q></P>
<P>"My dear,—my hapless Maria!— may the inflexible heart of thy cruel father melt with compassion o'er my untimely bier:—may he choose, from the fortunate of mankind, an object
<PB N="62" REF="017808_0071_0FA319FDC37EBEB0"/>
worthy of that amiable treasure, thy affections, when thy Frederick's suf∣ferings rest in oblivion.—Thus I fi∣nish the terrific behest of madness and affliction!"</P>
<P>The report of the pistol alarmed my driver, and some labourers who were in an adjacent field, who ran to his assistance; one of them was a te∣nant of his, and felt his loss in a sen∣sible manner.</P>
<P>We drove to his habitation, where the face of harmony was changed to a scene of tears, and audible sorrow. His faithful domestics, trembling with the shock of anguish, bore him in. The best of masters!— the most excel∣lent of friends!— was the tenor of their lamentations. Anthony's afflic∣tion over the bleeding body of his be∣loved Caesar, could only be expressive of the faintest picture here of sorrow.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="017808_0072_0FA319FF078BFDD8"/>On my return, I discovered the following paper, which dropped from his pocket in the confusion.</P>
<LETTER>
<Q><P>I sit down, for the last time, to trouble my amiable Maria with the weeping thoughts of a soul she has long been acquainted with; whose dearest happiness fled from her hal∣cyon seat, when thy unpitying father withdrew thy society, the only one she with bliss rejoiced in. Angel of felicity! whose refined adornments of mind and person have proved the bane of my tranquility, receive this parting attestation, this violent pledge of my sincerity! —Could I raise thee to a diadem, how great would be my glory! but that is be∣yond my reach: An easy compe∣tence, sufficient for the blissful asy∣lum of content, is all my portion: This, I remember, you with exul∣tation
<PB N="64" REF="017808_0073_0FA319FF6EAEB2E8"/>
called a treasure, while your Frederick partook of it. Oh, Ma∣ria! your tedious and secret remo∣val weighs my poor spirit to the shades of death: I cannot linger here: This world presents nothing but a comfortless waste! — the light-hearted this hour, are my compa∣nions the next; and all I think and feel, melancholy expression would but faintly convey to you.</P>
<P>This morning I shall seal my doom— perhaps this hour — the shi∣vering fit has oft come o'er me, which I baffled with the lenitives of philosophy. But, alas! I cannot do it longer— the rage of unspeakable phrenzy seizes on my senses, and in a few minutes I shall rest on the pil∣low of the greatly unfortunate.</P>
<P>In whatever region thou art con∣veyed to, dear spirit of excellence
<PB N="65" REF="017808_0074_0FA31A00057FE9C8"/>
pour thy benediction to the throne of mercy, for thy bleeding sacri∣fice!</P></Q>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>—thy unfortunate
FREDERICK.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter was returned to his fa∣mily in the evening.</P>
<P>My reflections continued for some days, on the lamentable exit of this poor being; whose philosophy was a shadow; and whose feelings, had they been less refined, would have done honor to humanity.</P>
<P>Does the fault lie in nature, or the clime? My reader will, probably, say the first; in which opinion I will rea∣dily coincide: It cannot be confined to any clime in particular; for every region has this lunacy upon record. I have heard it asserted, by scientific re∣searchers, that the British clime is full
<PB N="66" REF="017808_0075_0FA31A00C519B1D0"/>
of this vapor of phrenzy; but I will not, by any means, give my consent to it: I am very well persuaded every enlightened country in the terraque∣ous globe can produce yearly instances of the like nature. We pay more at∣tention to what happens at home, than we do to any other quarter; and from this alone arises that universal received opinion, that Britain is more culp∣able in this respect.</P>
<P>May the hand of Heaven interfere, and destroy this plague of the mind —this fell ravager of peace and hap∣piness.</P>

<HEAD>THE MILLINER's PRENTICE.</HEAD>
<P>"YOU seem greatly fatigued, my dear," says a gentleman to her; "will you permit me to carry your band-box, or do me the pleasure of your company in this coach? I will be happy in conducting you to where∣ever you are going." "Indeed Sir," says she, very modestly, "I am very faint, for I have not rested since I breakfasted: My situation in life is more than I can patiently bear." "I sincerely believe it," says he, "the hardships of this life crowd upon us before we can gather strength to sup∣port them, let that fortitude be thy companion through life, that propt through a series of afflictions thy re∣nowned and virtuous country wo∣man, the memorable Elizabeth.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="017808_0077_0FA31A02437A6568"/>"Anguish oft slumbers on the pil∣low of regal virtue, as well as thine; your parents should have been more watchful of your soul's ease."</P>
<P>"There, Sir," says she, "you pre∣sent to my imagination a picture I would willingly avoid looking at; I lost my felicity when I buried my a∣miable father; my happiness died with him; and left me with a mourn∣ing mother, to bemoan his loss in a comfortless situation.</P>
<P>"He was a captain in a regiment stationed in Ireland, where he died; my mother, fond of living within the bosom of her little family, free from the inquisitive and prying eyes of bu∣sy, medling neighbours, who cannot be happy if they are not acquainted with every domestic secret around them, was obliged, after this heavy af∣fliction, to quit that kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="017808_0078_0FA31A0303685468"/>"She had ever a predilection for the village where I was born in War∣wickshire, where she settled about three years ago, and lives at present, with my brother and sister. A friend∣ly lady in the neighbourhood shewed me many marks of her esteem; and requested I might be put prentice to her milliner in Cornhill.</P>
<P>"I am sensible of the sincerity of her friendship, for the day I was bound, she put into my master's hands a two hundred pound bank note, to be delivered to me at the expiration of my time.</P>
<P>"This she did, lest any unforeseen accident should deprive her of the means on which I was to build my fu∣ture independence. She little knows the slavery of a milliner's younger prentice, and the vices they are ex∣posed

to." She shall speedily be ac∣quainted with them," says her com∣panion, "for I will, with your per∣mission, solicit her countenance and your mother's to our immediate union."</P>
<P>This was one of the unexpected sallies of violent love, and she blushed exceedingly, without a reply to it, for some minutes.</P>
<P>To read a countenance on this oc∣casion requires some sensible delibe∣ration; she did not think herself suf∣ficiently an adept in this point, so re∣ferred him to her master, for the most material part of the reply she would wish to give him.</P>
<P>He begged an interview with her that evening in the Temple Gardens; when he would give such proofs to her

<P>WE'LL take a pleasurable jaunt to the Spaniards on Hamp∣stead hill, George," says a smart wo∣man to a handsome young fellow.

"'Tis very well," says she.—I could not help admiring the exterior of this youth: He had all that refined elegance in his person and manner my reader would expect from the finest mould of nature, and the tuition of the Graces: —And can this man be a pickpocket, thought I. — "You look very well to-day, George," says his companion; "the K — would as soon be suspected of your intention this morning." "'Tis a cursed life," says he, "but I must feed my ambi∣tion."— I waited till they returned with the spoil, and then we drove ra∣pidly off to Hampstead.</P>
<P>"Thy advice has been very pro∣phetic to-day, and I have profited largely by it," says she; "how did you come off?"— "Nabob like," says he, "my plunder is a little brilliant! I

tipt the sextoness half a crown, and she placed me in one of the best seats in the church, among a set of weighty dowagers:— This neat repeater, set round with diamonds is no trifle; Varnish, the watchmaker, of Bartho∣lomew's Close, shall baptize it with a new name, and away it goes to the East-Indies.</P>
<P>"This massy snuff box is of the true antique; my friend Solomon, of St. Mary-Axe, will soon dispose of this: He won't scruple saying it was the companion of Edward Worthly Montague in his travels to the written mountains; and off it goes to a virtu∣oso, at as great a price as the Monk's horn-box— if Yorick's heirs would dispose of it.</P>
<P>"The rest are trifles, a gold etwee, a smelling bottle, a purse with two

<P>"Here's the beauteous assemblage that will tell no tales," producing a purse of guineas, — "and this beauti∣ful topaz ring, five guineas, and a bank note for ten pounds in another:—I have got a watch too—but fire me, it is Cockspur-Street sterling, that Jew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Pinchbeck.</HI></NOTE> has often bit me in this manner.</P>
<P>"Yonder goes Harriet, as I live let us post after her, and take a view of her new flash-man, I am told he is very handsome, and has seen better days."</P>
<P>"He has," says her companion,— "I understood at the billiard table,

the other day, that he was an officer in America, lost considerably at ha∣zard, and was necessitated to sell his commission to discharge some press∣ing debts.</P>
<P>"He has been in London some months, and constantly attends our nocturnal meetings in Russel-Court; —he won twenty pieces last night from Ned Nimblewrist, and seems af∣fectionately fond of Harriet; she ne∣ver suffers him to decide her disputes like most women in her situation, but rather wishes to screen him from pub∣lic attention. I found him at the Cocoa Tree the other day very me∣lancholy, which convinces me how very disagreeable his situation is to him. He is very accomplished, but what can he do in London, where no∣thing but the means will signify a rush? Without that, a man cuts as ridiculous

<P>I was very happy in getting rid of such sharpers, and returned to town with a hope that I might one day have the pleasure of conducting them on board some lighter, for Mr. Camp∣bell's Marine academy at Woolwich: —I won't say to Tyburn.</P>

<HEAD>THE COUNTRY GIRL.</HEAD>
<P>"LARD love you, Sir, an you be so koind to direct me to Chandos-Street Common Garden," says a rosy country girl, with a little parcel under her arm, addressing her∣self to an old gentleman with a com∣placent countenance.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="017808_0086_0FA31A091FA2F7F0"/>"'Tis a dangerous road, child,— and as thou seem'st a stranger, we will step into this coach, and I will be your safeguard through it." "Ah! dear a me," says the simpleton; "I should be waundidly afread to trust myself, for I heard as how they be voil folks in London." "Fear not, sweet inno∣cence," says the courteous stranger, "I am the parent of such as thee, and will protect thee with as much attention."</P>
<P>"GOD Almighty bless you for your koindness."</P>
<P>On the way he asked her what bu∣siness could bring her to London, a∣lone, or could tempt her to leave the inn without a guide? She said her sweetheart had listed for a soldier, and had gone to America; that she could not bear the country after him, for he used every evening, as duly as the sun went down, to meet her in the mea∣dow

For the last month I did nothing but weep, but more so when I went to the meadow,—we were as merry as the lark once,"—here she wept bitterly.</P>
<P>"I was advised," says she, "to come to a sister of mine that lives in Chandos Street, and she would get me a place:—I had but little money when I took my place in the waggon; and when I got to the inn, I had but a shilling left; which I kept, lest I should not find my sister. There were several in the inn-yard offered their sarvices to shew me the way, par∣ticularly an old lady, with a patch on her face, drest very genteelish; but I was afread, and pretended to know

<HEAD>A DISCONSOLATE WOMAN.</HEAD>
<P>HER husband had been just hur∣ried from her embraces by two of those vultures of inhumanity, she∣riff's officers; she was in a violent a∣gitation of mind, —she trembled ex∣ceedingly, as she was stepping in, and instantly burst into tears. "No: — says she, (let what will betide) he shall not be from my arms to-night, —my af∣fectionate husband!— unfeeling cre∣ditor that my children could not stop thy rigor for a few days; but thy heart will ache for it yet.</P>
<P>When she arrived at her house, a little boy came running to the door. "Well, my dear Mamma, —did you find him?"— "No, child, but I won't

<P>She did not keep me long, when she returned with a few valuable arti∣cles, which she took to a pawnbro∣kers, and deposited for as much as would procure his enlargement; from whence she hurried to Southampton Buildings, Holborn; and returned— with her soul's felicity!— and a coun∣tenance of inexpressible delight.</P>
<P>"He is disappointed," says she; "he thought to injure you in the ten∣derest point, by confining you, and this for a trifling quarrel: —Shame on the villain,— have no farther inter∣course with him, and a little time,

<P>He desired he might be taken to Suffolk-Street, Middlesex Hospital. On my way I could not help recon∣noitering this man's facetious counte∣nance; there was something very in∣teresting in it; — it contained more expression than any I had seen for a long time,— there was all that vivaci∣ty of soul sparkling in his eyes, that Reynolds would give to the comic muse!— He drew a manuscript from his pocket — looked over it in a cur∣sory manner. — "I shall never endure to get it by heart," says he; "this fel∣low's

<P>He beckoned to a gentleman on the opposite side of the way, who ran to meet him,— shook him by the hand very cordially,— inquired after his health, — "pretty well, pretty well," says he, "I shall kill the king of grief yet. But tell me what success the last campaign, any thing of the vis comica in it?" "Yes, faith, a great deal," says the other: "Some silly youths left their solid pudding in London, for the empty praise of a barn; mad to put the buskin'd muse out of counte∣nance; we had a whining Romeo — a ranting Richard— a very dolorific Hamlet, and a Lear of sixteen years old.— Bob gave the rustics the cries of

<P>We had got to the top of Berner's-Street, when he pulled out the check string,— there was a poor wretch, with an anguish-worn countenance, sitting beside a watchman's box:— She was almost naked, with an infant folded in her shiv'ring arms.— A peeress stopt her carriage and sent her a shilling, —three fourths of her body was bent over her infant, so that the donation was not seen by her, till a little boy told it was dropt into her lap.

Saying which, he returned to me with his eyes swim∣ming in tears.

<P>AN uncommon demand for coaches this evening, by the enthusiastic admirers of dramatic ex∣cellence, who were hurrying to Dru∣ry-lane theatre to see that great lu∣minary of theatric genius, Mr. Gar∣rick, take his farewel of an admiring and polished audience, who for thir∣ty years shewed him the highest marks of their favor, drew me to the house of a distinguished gentleman in the republic of letters; he was accom∣panied by his wife and daughter.</P>

<P>By the time I arrived at the door, they were kicking up a dust with the people of the house; one of them who personated Alexander the Great, was so elated with the sublimity of his elo∣quence, that he broke a pier glass with his truncheon, as he swung his Her∣culean arm backwards.—The landlord insisted on immediate payment for

Here a general engagement took place; the heroes took fire at the in∣dignity offered their Garrick, and all was uproar in an instant:— the land∣lady ran for a constable.— Alexander made his escape; and poor Hamlet, who had given the landlord a black eye, was secured.

<HEAD>DR. DODD's EXECUTION.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK he had many virtues, and deserved a better fate." "'Tis a merciful opinion, and will do thee more honour than a thousand ill-na∣tured reflections," says an elderly gentleman, to a young man, who had both taken a seat in me.</P>
<P>"I will acknowledge the justice of his sentence," continued the first; but I think the many essential services he has done the public,—the streaming tears of the Magdalen, the benedic∣tion of the captive and his wretched family, just freed from the dreary tomb of relentless oppression,—should extenuate the rigid behest of justice,— should grant him the poor privilege of lingering out a miserable existence in

the obscurity his sorrowing soul de∣sires.—From the gloomy confines of self reproach, and never ceasing an∣guish, to cast a retrospective look at his former elevated situation in life,— his boundless popularity!—admired genius and powerful influence! will be punishment enough Heaven knows! to a mind formed like his."</P>
<P>By this time we arrived in Oxford-street. What a crowd!—it was as much as we could do to get along:— the melancholly procession had not yet arrived.— "We will have an op∣portunity," continued he, if we stop here, to hear the various opinions of the multitude assembled on this so∣lemn occasion; they will speak their minds freely,—'tis the privilege of Englishmen;—and what their honest natures cannot conceal."</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="017808_0147_0FA3198A45159708"/>"Poor soul!" says a tattered wretch, he relieved me in my last ly∣ing-in." Thou art a grateful creature for the acknowledgement at this hour," says an old gentleman, giving her a shilling.—"He was a vile hy∣pocrite," says a fine gentleman, riding by, who paid more attention to the one offence, than to the numberless good actions of the criminal.</P>
<P>"Thou art a merciless monster," says a clergyman, "and deserve a worse fate for thy cruel assertion." Hundreds wished for an opportunity to appease their rage, by executing a certain lord high in office in the criminal's stead.</P>
<P>His cruel decree in the privy coun∣cil,—the weight of his thoughts with the most merciful of kings, who was pressed by pity and clemency to as∣cend their throne, but could not van∣quish the voice of obduracy.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="017808_0148_0FA3198B05AC4928"/>"A thousand guineas, says a young fellow, "was offered the turnkey last night for his enlargement." "Split my top-sails, Jack," says a sailor to his com∣panion, I wish I had been in his place, the poor parson should be free from the sharks this morning." "If he was a popish parson and in my country," says the other, dash me on the needles! he'd never swing in the sheriff's pic∣ture frame; no, no, they're too fond of their admirals of the Brest fleet there.</P>
<P>By this time the wretched criminal appeared, with general commiseration around him;—the voice of pity e∣choed to his ear the universal con∣cern.—Captivity," says my young companion, "has robbed thee of thy lively countenance;—thy features con∣fess the tyrant hand of affliction,—sere∣nity has fled thy bosom; thy tears have formed a channel in thy cheeks;—and
<PB N="140" REF="017808_0149_0FA3198BC4C1FCB0"/>
now they flow abundant.—Merciful Heaven! to be five months shut from the cheerful habitation of friendship!— the happy embraces of connubial fe∣licity!— and yet thy cup of misery is not the bitterest; parental anguish does not wring thy soul—thou hast taken leave of no weeping children, none but an affectionate wife, and a few faithful friends—it is enough!"</P>
<P>As there was a report prevailed that some means would be used to prevent his execution, my passengers were anxious to see the issue.—We drove as close to Tyburn as the mul∣titude would suffer us.—A gentle∣man gave a guinea for a front seat in one of the galleries: it might have been applied to a nobler purpose.</P>
<P>As the criminal kept the hind leaf of his hat very low upon his face, it was impossible to discover his coun∣tenance

at a distance; he had not re∣mained long in this situation when a sudden gust of wind blew his hat off; — then at once, his fears of death were evident,— his disordered features blushed for concealment, which were instantly hid. Shortly after he embraced his worthy friend Dr. *****, who attended him; spoke for a few minutes to the unhappy youth, his companion, and then his afflictions ceased in this world.</P>
<P>We waited till he was delivered to his friends, which happened some minutes before his fellow sufferer; which the spectators took particular notice of, together with the execu∣tioner's manner of cutting him down; he put his left hand down his collar in such a manner, that he seemed dis∣engaging one thing from another; and with a knife in the other hand, he cut
<PB N="142" REF="017808_0151_0FA3198D45BE94C0"/>
the cord.—I am thus particular as it was firmly believed by every one, but the inhuman, that he was alive at the time.</P>

<P>Behold the illustrious patriots, Cam∣den and Rockingham! the afflictions of their country give way to a nobler sorrow, the flowing tears of eternal friendship.—See the dishevelled youth, his loving son;—disconsolation has taken early possession of his youthful bosom, and he walks in her tearful path with ceaseless sorrow.—

<P>A VIOLENT outcry of a genteel woman-pickpocket being de∣tected, and then at the Gun-Tavern, Westminster bridge, curiosity urged my companions to see the thief.— They had a fellow feeling on the oc∣casion.</P>
<P>By the time we got near the door, they were hurrying her to prison. My reader will not be surprised when I tell him it was the distinguished Bet West, already introduced to him in a former page, that was the criminal. She had, on that solemn morning, as∣sumed the name of Mary Groves; but no deception could be of any use to her, her face was too conspicuous in
<PB N="146" REF="017808_0155_0FA3199045074EC8"/>
Akerman's court beauties, to escape making a lasting impression.</P>
<P>It seems she had pilfered a watch, which she instantly conjured with the dexterity of Breslaw, into *** ****. Some female novices searched her from head to foot,—the poor crea∣ture was guiltless,—she had no such thing.—An adept in the magic art, who had retired to Woolwich to hide the blushes of her iniquity in her de∣cline, started from the throng, in∣spired by the animating amazonian spirit of London, a few glasses of right Hollands, and instantly pulled from the curious repository the shin∣ing treasure!—those that were gather∣ed round to see the sight, stood mute when they beheld it, but could not long govern their roaring throats, nor grumble pity.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="017808_0156_0FA3199103D59528"/>The discovery was instantly ru∣moured, and she was conducted to prison amidst the applause of some hundreds of honest people, and the regret of a number of her relations of the diving generation, Jews and Gentiles.</P>
