<L N="100">That fans the ever undulating sky;</L>
<L>A kindly sky! whose fost'ring power regales</L>

<L>BUT now the hours and seasons when to toil,</L>

<L>Some labour fasting, or but slightly fed,</L>
<L>To lull the grinding stomach's hungry rage:</L>
<L N="340">Where nature feeds too corpulent a frame,</L>
<L>'Tis wisely done. For while the thirsty veins,</L>
<L>Impatient of lean penury, devour</L>
<L>The treasur'd oil, then is the happiest time</L>
<L>To shake the lazy balsam from its cells.</L>
<L N="345">Now while the stomach from the full repast</L>
<L>Subsides, but ere returning hunger gnaws,</L>
<L>Ye leaner habits give an hour to toil:</L>
<L>And ye whom no luxuriancy of growth</L>
<L>Oppresses yet, or threatens to oppress.</L>
<L N="350">But from the recent meal no labours please,</L>
<L>Of limbs or mind. For now the cordial powers</L>
<L>Claim all the wandering spirits to a work</L>
<L>Of strong and subtle toil, and great event;</L>
<L>A work of time: and you may rue the day</L>
<L N="355">You hurried, with ill-seasoned exercise,</L>
<L>A half concocted chyle into the blood.</L>
<L>The body overcharg'd with unctuous phlegm</L>
<L>Much toil demands: the lean elastic less.</L>

While winter chills the blood, and binds the veins,</L>
<L N="360">No labours are too hard: by those you 'scape</L>
<L>The slow diseases of the torpid year;</L>
<L>Endless to name; to one of which alone,</L>
<L>To that which tears the nerves, the toil of slaves</L>
<L>Is pleasure: oh! from such inhuman pains</L>
<L N="365">May all be free who merit not the wheel!</L>
<L>But from the burning Lion when the sun</L>
<L>Pours down his sultry wrath; now while the blood</L>
<L>Too much already maddens in the veins,</L>
<L>And all the finer fluids thro' the skin</L>
<L N="370">Explore their flight; me, near the cool cascade</L>
<L>Reclin'd, or sauntring in the lofty grove,</L>
<L>No needless slight occasion should engage</L>
<L>To pant and sweat beneath the fiery noon.</L>
<L>Now the fresh morn alone and mellow eve</L>

<L>Melts all the night in strains of amorous woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE shades descend, and midnight o'er the world</L>

A pleasing lassitude: he not in vain</L>

<L>His powers the most voluptuously dissolve</L>
<L N="390">In soft repose: on him the balmy dews</L>
<L>Of sleep with double nutriment descend.</L>
<L>But would you sweetly waste the blank of night</L>
<L>In deep oblivion; or on fancy's wings</L>
<L>Visit the paradise of happy dreams,</L>
<L N="395">And waken chearful as the lively morn;</L>
<L>Oppress not nature sinking down to rest</L>
<L>With feasts too late, too solid, or too full.</L>
<L>But be the first concoction half-matur'd,</L>
<L>Ere you to mighty indolence resign</L>
<L N="400">Your passive faculties. He from the toils</L>

<L>Not all a monarch's luxury the woes</L>

<L>Whose nights are shaken with the frantic fits</L>
<L>Of wild Orestes; whose delirious brain,</L>
<L N="410">Stung by the furies, works with poisoned thought:</L>
<L>While pale and monstrous painting shocks the soul;</L>
<L>And mangled consciousness bemoans itself</L>
<L>For ever torn; and chaos floating round.</L>

<L>THE choice of aliment, the choice of air,</L>
<L>The use of toil, and all external things,</L>

<L>What good what evil from ourselves proceeds:</L>
<L N="5">And how the subtle principle within</L>
<L>Inspires with health, or mines with strange decay</L>

That animates and moulds the grosser frame;</L>

<L>Mean while this heavenly particle pervades</L>

<L>BY its own toil the gross corporeal frame</L>
<L>Fatigues, extenuates, or destroys itself:</L>

<L N="430">Reverberates each vibration of the Soul;</L>
<L>As is the Passion, such is still the Pain</L>
<L>The Body feels; or chronic, or acute.</L>
<L>And oft a sudden storm at once o'erpowers</L>
<L>The Life, or gives your Reason to the winds.</L>
<L N="435">Such fates attend the rash alarm of Fear,</L>
<L>And sudden Grief, and Rage, and sudden Joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THERE are, mean time, to whom the boist'rous fit</L>
<L>Is health, and only fills the sails of life.</L>
<L>For where the Mind a torpid winter leads,</L>
<L N="440"><PB N="86" REF="005532_0080_101913A1D3FDDFC8"/>
Wrapt in a body corpulent and cold,</L>
<L>And each clogg'd function lazily moves on;</L>
<L>A generous sally spurns th' incumbent load,</L>
<L>Unlocks the breast, and gives a cordial glow.</L>
<L>But if your wrathful blood is apt to boil,</L>
<L N="445">Or are you nerves too irritably strung;</L>
<L>Wave all Dispute; be cautious if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> joke;</L>
<L>Keep Lent for ever; and forswear the bowl.</L>
<L>For one rash <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sends you to the shades,</L>
<L>Or shatters every hopeful scheme of life,</L>
<L N="450">And gives to horror all your days to come.</L>
<L>Fate, arm'd with thunder, fire, and every plague</L>
<L>That ruins, tortures, or distracts mankind,</L>
<L>And makes the happy wretched in an hour,</L>
<L>O'erwhelms you not with woes so horrible</L>
<L N="455">As your own wrath, nor gives more sudden blows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILE choler works, good friend, you may be wrong;</L>
<L>Distrust yourself, and sleep before you fight.</L>
<L>'Tis not too late to morrow to be brave;</L>
<L>If Honour bids, to morrow kill or die.</L>
<L N="460">But calm advice against a raging fit</L>
<L>Avails too little; and it tries the power</L>
<L>Of all that ever taught in Prose or Song,</L>
<L>To tame the Fiend that steeps a gentle Lamb,</L>
<L>And wakes a Lion. Unprovok'd and calm,</L>
<L N="465">You reason well, see as you ought to see▪</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="005532_0081_10191387457C6370"/>
And wonder at the madness of mankind:</L>
<L>Seiz'd with the common rage, you soon forget</L>
<L>The speculations of your wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hours.</L>
<L>Beset with Furies of all deadly shapes,</L>
<L N="470">Fierce and insidious, violent and slow;</L>
<L>With all that urge or lure us on to Fate;</L>
<L>What refuge shall we seek? what arms prepare?</L>
<L>Where Reason proves too w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k or void of wiles,</L>
<L>To cope with subtle or im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="7 letters" DISP="〈7 letters〉"/> Powers,</L>
<L N="475">I would invoke new Passions to your aid:</L>
<L>With indignation would extinguish Fear,</L>
<L>With Fear or generous Pity vanquish Rage,</L>
<L>And Love with Pride; and force to force oppose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THERE is a Charm: a Power that sways the breast;</L>
<L N="480">Bids every Passion revel or be still;</L>
<L>Inspires with Rage, or all your Cares dissolves;</L>
<L>Can sooth Distraction, and almost Despair.</L>
<L>That Power is Music: far beyond the stretch</L>
<L>Of those unmeaning warblers on our stage;</L>
<L N="485">Those clumsy Heroes, those sat-headed Gods.</L>
<L>Who move no Passion justly but Contempt:</L>
<L>Who, like our Dancers (light indeed and strong!)</L>
<L>Do wond'rous feats, but never heard of grace.</L>
<L>The fault is ours; we bear those monstrous arts.</L>
<L N="490">Good Heaven we praise them: we, with loudest peals,</L>
<L>Applaud the fool that highest lifts his heels;</L>
<L>And with insipid shew of rapture, die</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="005532_0082_101913A5CC1C3840"/>
Of ideot notes, impertinently long.</L>
<L>But he the Muse's laurel justly shares,</L>
<L N="495">A Poet he, and touch'd with Heaven's own fire;</L>
<L>Who, with bold rage or solemn pomp of sounds,</L>
<L>Inflames, exalts, and ravishes the soul▪</L>
<L>Now tender, plaintive, sweet almost to pain,</L>
<L>In Love dissolves you; now in sprightly strains</L>
<L N="500">Breathes a gay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ure thro' your thrilling breast;</L>
<L>Or melts th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with airs divinely sad,</L>
<L>Or wakes to horror the tremendous strings.</L>
<L>Such was the bard, whose heavenly strains of old</L>
<L>Appeas'd the Fiend of melancholy Saul.</L>
<L N="505">Such was, if old and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athen fame say true.</L>
<L>The man who bade the Theban domes ascend,</L>
<L>And tam'd the savage nations with his song;</L>
<L>And such the Thracian, whose harmonious lyre,</L>
<L>Tun'd to soft woe, made all the mountains weep:</L>
<L N="510">Sooth'd even th' inexorable powers of Hell.</L>
<L>And half redeem'd his lost Eurydice.</L>
<L>Music exalts each Joy, allays each Grief,</L>
<L>Expels Diseases, softens every Pain,</L>
<L>Subdues the rage of Poison, and the Plague;</L>
<L N="515">And hence the wise of ancient days ador'd</L>
<L>One Power of Physic, Melody, and Song.</L>
