<P>I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee O Lord will I sing.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AUTHORISED by a divine precept, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exodus 34.22.</NOTE> and excited by the feelings of gratitude, the inhabitants of these northern provinces, have made it their constant practice, to meet in their religious assemblies, at the close of the year, and devoutly offer unto the LORD, their sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving.</P>
<P>WHEN the fruits of the earth are gathered in, and we are furnished with provisions for an expen∣sive winter season, nothing can be more proper, than for a people professing godliness, to unite in paying their thankful acknowledgments to the father of the universe, for the expressions of his goodness.—And we rejoice, that the representa¦tives of this Province, who, in the present dis∣tracted state of our public affairs, have been con∣sulting the most proper ways to <HI>recover</HI> and <HI>secure</HI> our invaded liberties, were not unmindful of the
<PB N="6" REF="013370_0004_0F90571AC8F793F8"/>
blessings we receive from GOD almighty; but have invited us to observe <HI>this</HI> as a day of general thanksgiving.</P>
<P>BUT although we have much reason to bless the Lord, for the many expressions of his goodness, through the course of the last year, it is proper, e∣ven on this day of festivity,
<Q>to humble ourselves before GOD, on account of those sins, for which he hath suffered our present calamities to come upon us, and implore the divine blessing, that by the assistances of his grace, we may be ena∣bled to reform whatever is amiss, that so GOD may be pleased to continue to us the blessings we enjoy, and remove the tokens of his displea∣sure.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the recommendation from the Provential Congress, for a day of thanksgiving.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE exercises of this day, will therefore be different from what have been usual; and I could think of no passage of scripture, more suitable to place at the head of a discourse, in which we are to have respect, both to the blessings of divine pro∣vidence, and the public calamities which have be∣fallen us, than the words of David, which have now been read.</P>
<P>A celebrated commentator on the text, has the following observations:—
<Q>When GOD in his providence exerciseth us with a mixture of Mercy and Judgment, it is our duty to sing, and sing unto him both of the one and the other: We must be suitably affected with both, and make suitable acknowledgments of both.</Q>
<PB N="7" REF="013370_0005_0F90571B497F84C0"/>
Agreeable to the Chaldee paraphrase,—
<Q>If thou bestowest mercy upon me, or if thou bringest any judgment upon me, before thee, O Lord, will I sing my hymns for all.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HENRY o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE></P>
<P>LET me then ask your attention, while I men∣tion some of the blessings which GOD is pleased to bestow upon us; and take notice of the prin∣cipal calamities, which, in righteous Judgment, he has suffered to befal us.</P>
<P>YOU will be sensible, the time allowed the prea∣cher on a day of thanksgiving, will not admit of an exact enumeration, either of the Blessings be∣stowed upon us, or the calamities under which we suffer; we must therefore confine our attention to those which are confessedly of the most impor∣tance: But should I a little exceed the limits com∣monly observed on these Occasions, the nature of the subject, I hope, will be an apology for me.</P>
<P>ALL who profess their belief of the holy Scrip∣tures, will be free to acknowledge, the mercy of God revealed in the gospel, demands our first, our principle attention.</P>
<P>SUCH is the darkness of the human mind, that had not the children of men, been favoured with the light of divine truth, they would never have found the way to glory. But the father of the universe, in compassion to the human race, expo∣sed to misery, in consequence of the spread of mo∣ral evil through the World, was pleased to give his Son, that whosoever believeth on him should
<PB N="8" REF="013370_0006_0F90571CA36A92F8"/>
not perish, but might have eternal life.— <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.16.</NOTE> The day-spring from on high hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the sha∣dow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.— <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke 1.78, 79.</NOTE> We have reason to join with the angels, and multitude of the heavenly host, ascribing glo∣ry to GOD in the highest, that on earth there is peace, and good will towards men. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke 2.14.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE mercy of GOD revealed to a guilty World, in the gift of his Son Jesus Christ, will claim an e∣verlasting tribute of Praise.—How deplorable would our condition have been, had the author of our existence, seen fit to leave us to the power of those lusts, which war against the Soul.— <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Iames 4.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Satan, the enemy of all good, was able to seduce our once innocent parents from their loyalty, and render them obnoxious to the wrath of their creator.— And had not Jesus Christ who is stronger than the strong man armed, and is able to subdue all things to himself, <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Phillip. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.21.</NOTE> undertaken the work of redemption, none of our guilty race, could have entertained a hope of future happiness, or even of life from the dead.</P>
<P>BUT by the gospel of the grace of GOD, life and immortality are brought to light.—By the gospel we are made certain of a future state; and the author of our Salvation, has not only suffered for our offences, and rose again for our justification, but clearly pointed out the path to heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013370_0007_0F90F412AF7A3C60"/>WE have reason to be thankful, that notwith∣standing, all our unworthiness, the gospel is con∣tinued among us, and we have liberty to worship our creator, according to the dictates of consci∣ence, without disturbance or molestation.</P>
<P>MANY have endured the greatest afflictions, and suffered the most cruel death, not only under pa∣gon Monarchs, and the influence of romish inqui∣sitions, but under the arbitrary government of ty∣rants, who in ages past, disgraced the throne of Britain.</P>
<P>NOT to mention persecutions in foreign coun∣tries, or look back to the ages of darkness and gross ignorance, in our own nation, and in the short time which past between the restoration of Charles the IId, and the glorious revolution, be∣sides many that were inhumanely murdered, five thousand <HI>Protestants</HI> died in prisons, on account of their religion. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the History of England during the Reigns of the Stuarts.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT while multitudes have suffered, because they did not choose to submit to unscriptural usages, or attend to modes and forms of hu∣man invention, we have enjoyed full liberty of conscience: In no part of the world has the right of private judgment, in matters of religion, been more sacredly maintained, than in America.</P>
<P>IN some provinces, all sects and denominati∣ons, professing christianity, Roman Catholics not excepted, are freely tolerated.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="013370_0008_0F90567D9D806610"/>IN those provinces where the church of En∣gland is established by law, <HI>dissenters</HI> are allowed their own forms of worship; but required in∣deed, as in most parts of the world, where a form of worship is established by authority, to pay their proportion towards the support of the established clergy.</P>
<P>AND in these northern provinces, where the order and discipline, which have generally been observed in the <HI>congregational</HI> or <HI>presbyterian</HI> chur∣ches, are favoured with an establishment, <HI>dissen∣ters</HI> from our worship and discipline, are not on∣ly <HI>tolerated,</HI> but upon their professing to be of other denominations, they are excused from bear∣ing any part of the expence, attending the sup∣port of the ministry, and form of worship esta∣blished by law. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extract from an Act "passed by the Great and General Court" of this Province,
<Q>to exempt the People called Quakers, and Antipedobaptists, from paying Taxes for the support of Ministers settled by the Laws of this Province, and for the building and repairing Meeting-Houses or places of public Worship,</Q> may serve to evince what was said above with respect to religious liberty, and the tenderness which is exercised towards such as <HI>dissent</HI> from the mode of worship and discipline established by law.</P>

<P>AS the blessings of the gospel, and the privi∣leges of a religious nature which we enjoy, are ex∣ceeding precious, we ought to remember them with gratitude, and render to the LORD the warm∣est affections of our heart for the continuance of them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013370_0010_0F905681DDBD57A0"/>WE have reason to be thankful

of the Heavens, which were necessary to perfect the fruits of the earth. Our markets are filled with a variety of provisions; and not∣withstanding the multitude of strangers among us, we cannot complain that the necessaries of life are sold us at an extravagant price. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following Regiments are now Stationed at BOSTON, and at CASTLE-WILLIAM.—FOURTH BATTALION of the Royal <HI>Regiment</HI> of ARTILLERY.—FOURTH (or King's own) REGIMENT.—FIFTH REGIMENT.—TENTH RE∣GIMENT.—EIGHTEENTH (or royal Irish) REGIMENT.

BOYNE, of 64: Besides a number of smaller Ships and other armed Vessels; together with the Transports which have been employed to bring Troops to this unhappy Metropolis.—</NOTE></P>
<P>WE have been visited with no uncommon sickness in this Town, or through the land. The pestilence has not walked in darkness, nor has the destruction wasted at noon day.—Such in∣deed is human frailty, that every year we must expect to bury some of our friends and valu∣able acquaintance: But we have reason to be thankful, when mortal diseases have not been general.</P>
<P>"AND in particular", we have reason to be thankful,
<Q>from a consideration of the union which so remarkably prevails, not only in this Province, but through the continent, at this alarming crisis.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="013370_0012_0F905682240CD608"/>IT must be acknowledged, America never saw a day so alarming as the present·—The unhap∣py controversy which now subsists between Great-Britain and these Colonies, is more pain∣ful than any of the distressing wars we have formerly been engaged in.—When the Savages annoyed our infant settlements, or those who we used to consider as <HI>natural Enemies</HI> threatened to invade us, duty and interest pointed us to the means of safety.—Our young men offered them∣selves freely to engage in the defence of their country; and being succeeded by Heaven, vic∣tory from time to time, crowned their endea∣vours.—</P>
<P>BUT when the parent State is contending with us, nothing but the <HI>last</HI> extremity,—nothing but the preservation of <HI>life,</HI> or that which is of more importance LIBERTY, can ever prevail with us to make resistance.</P>
<P>WE Glory in our attachment to the House of Hanover.—We consider Britain as our native land.—We shall therefore bear much, we shall suffer many hardships, before we can entertain a single wish to the disadvantage of our brethren on the other side the Atlantic.—We <HI>never</HI> will rebel against the Sovereign of the British domini∣ons.—However provoked,—however oppressed,— however threatened with Slavery and wretched∣ness, we will never be excited to any other resist∣ance, than what the impartial world shall Judge <HI>absolutely</HI> necessary to our own defence.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013370_0013_0F90F3CABA0EA008"/>BRITONS and Americans, subjects of the same Crown, connected by the ties of nature, by in∣terest and by religion, maintained the most per∣fect harmony, and felt the purest joy in each others happiness for more than a hundred years: AND would to GOD, that harmony had never been disturbed!</P>
<P>BUT by reason of false, and injurious repre∣sentations which were made by some, from whom indeed we might have expected better things, a system of government, not long since, was for∣med for the colonies in America, too degrading and oppressive for British Subjects, quietly to bear.</P>
<P>THE Parliament of Great-Britain, some years ago, passed an Act, declaring
<Q><HI>That his Majesty in Parliament,</HI> OF RIGHT, <HI>had power to bind the people of these Colonies by statues</HI> IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER.</Q>
—
<Q>The import of the words above quoted, needs no discant: For the wit of man, cannot possibly form, a more clear, concise, and comprehensive definition and sen∣tence of slavery, than these expressions con∣tain.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Instructions to their Representatives.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN this light was the declaratory Act viewed by Americans in general.—And by several Acts which have passed <HI>since,</HI> the inhabitants of these colo∣nies have been confirmed in their apprehensi∣ons, that the Government at home, had deter∣mined to treat them, not as obedient children, but rather as Servants; and let them know that
<PB N="16" REF="013370_0014_0F90F3CB70BDC0B0"/>
they held life, and property, and whatever is dear to them, at the pleasure of masters three thousand miles distant; on whose ambition they can have no check, on whose power they have no controul.</P>
<P>ALARMED it may well be supposed the Ame∣ricans were, and not doubting but their graci∣ous King would hear their Petitions, and deli∣ver them from their troubles, they addressed the throne in the most humble and dutiful manner; but their Petitions were rejected, and treated with contempt. Arbitrary measures were ta∣ken to prevent the complaints of the injured and distressed from reaching the Royal ear.—
<Q>Assemblies have been frequently dissolved, con∣trary to the rights of the people, when they attempted to deliberate on grievances.</Q>

<P>"THE attacks on our rights were incessant": Not satisfied with taking away our money, in such quantities, and for such purposes as they pleased, the Parliament proceeded, in direct me∣thods, to invade our Charters, and threaten us with transportation to Great-Britain, in order to be tried, on supposition any resistance should be made, to what the Americans might consider as intolerable oppression.</P>
<P><Q>HARD is our fate, when, to escape the cha∣racter of rebels, we must be degraded into that of slaves: As if there was no medium, be∣tween the two extremes of anarchy and des∣potism,

where innocence and freedom could find repose and safety.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on the constitutional Power of Great-Britain over the Colonies in America.</NOTE></P>
<P>SUCH were our sufferings, particularly in this Province,—such our fears, and such the appre∣hensions of all America, that it was judged ex∣pedient a Continental Congress should be conve∣ned as soon as possible to take our public grie∣vances under consideration, and point out the most proper means of redress.</P>
<P>DEPUTIES were accordingly chosen by the se∣veral colonies from New-Hampshire to South-Ca∣rolina.—They entered upon the important busi∣ness to which they were appointed, as it become men professing the religion of Christ.—They made their humble addresses to the Lord of the universe for the influences of his Spirit, to lead them in a safe path, succeed their endeavours to extricate an injured people from their present difficulties, and lay a foundation for lasting tran∣quility, both in Great-Britain and America.— Many prayers were made for them in our respec∣tive churches, and by serious people in their pri∣vate retirements.</P>
<P>THE members who met in that illustrious As∣sembly, were men of the first character in the se∣veral provinces: Men who best understood the rights of America, and were best able to judge what measures would be most proper for the in∣habitants in general to adopt, in order to recover and secure them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="013370_0016_0F905686E91A9D10"/>AFTER Solemn deliberation on the important sub∣jects which lay before them, they came to a result, which has been made known to the World, and with which you are all acquainted.—We have much reason for thankfulness that the members of the Congress were so remarkably united.— Those among us who wished the late oppressive acts of parliament to be carried into execution; were free to declare, the Colonies would never unite, and endeavoured to make us believe, the Gentlemen who were chosen to represent the se∣veral Provinces, were of sentiments extremely different from each other. Had the Congress dissolved without forming any general plans, or had the members been greatly divided in their opinions, it would have discouraged the friends of Liberty, and perhaps given a fatal turn to our public affairs: But their <HI>Union</HI> has not only ex∣pressed the <HI>Union</HI> of their constituents, but had an happy influence to establish many in their friendship to the American cause, who were be∣fore, wavering —Their doings <HI>will,</HI> as they most certainly <HI>ought to,</HI> have <HI>the force of laws.</HI>—The man that ventures to rise in opposition to them, opposes both the wisdom and strength of this amazing continent; and certainly no man in his senses will act so foolish, so desperate a part.</P>
<P>THE penalty to be inflicted on such, if any such there should be, as in contempt of the <HI>Ame∣rican Association,</HI> determine to pursue their own private emoluments, regardless of the public good, is not immediate death, but it must be con∣fessed, it is very little short of it.—You will al∣low me to repeat some parts of the <HI>resolves</HI> which
<PB N="19" REF="013370_0017_0F90F3CCF60E1AB0"/>
declare it.—Whenever it shall appear to the Com∣mittees which are, or may be chosen in every county, city, and town, for executing the plans of the continental Congress, that any person with∣in their respective limits, has violated the Associ∣ation, the truth of the case is to be published,—
<Q>To the end, that all such foes to the rights of British America, may be publickly known, and universally contemned as the enemies of American Liberty; and thenceforth we res∣pectively will break off all dealing with him or her —And we do further agree and resolve that we will have no trade, commerce, deal∣ings or intercourse whatsoever, with any Co∣lony or Province in North-America, which shall not accede to, or which shall hereafter violate this Association, but will hold them as unworthy of the rights of freemen, and as inimical to the liberties of their Country.</Q></P>
<P>WHO would not dread such a punishment, as much as any temporal evil that can be mention∣ed?—To be cut off from the privileges of human society and lie exposed to universal contempt, is next, if not equal to being cut off from among the living.—People may affect to sport with po∣pular resentment as much as they please, when they have a few companions to flatter and encou∣rage them; but when that punishment, which they may ridicule at a distance, or think little of in its beginnings, falls upon them in earnest, they must have fortitude more than human, to support long under it.—A man of any tender feelings will be unhappy, when he knows a few of his ac∣quaintance are offended with him; how wretched
<PB N="20" REF="013370_0018_0F90F3CDD4C1FED0"/>
must <HI>he</HI> then be, who is assured the resentments of al∣most this whole continent, are raised against him, and that there is no town or village that he can visit, on business, or for amusement, without be∣ing exposed to the indignation of the inhabitants!</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this particular, because it appears to me of singular importance.— The union which remarkably prevails through the Continent, at this <HI>alarming crisis</HI> affords great encouragement, and requires our thankful ac∣knowledgments to almighty GOD.</P>
<P>IT is our duty, as we love righteousness,—as we love peace,—as we love our Country,—as we love the parent state,—ourselves and millions of unborn posterity, it is our duty, to do all in our power, to strengthen and perpetuate, <HI>this union.</HI>— And was I not sure, you are ready even of your∣selves, I would urge you my friends and fellow citizens, by arguments which influence my own mind,
<Q>To abide by and strictly adhere to the <HI>Resolutions</HI> of the continental Congress, as the most peaceable and probable method of pre∣venting confusion and bloodshed, and of resto∣ring that harmony between Great-Britain and these colonies, in which we wish might be esta∣blished not only the rights and liberties of Ame∣rica, but the opulence and lasting happiness of the whole British Empire.</Q>

<P>IF Great-Britain is jealous of the increasing in∣terest of the colonies, no doubt she will exert her power to cheek their growth, or her policy to draw off their riches as fast as they acquire them. And from the measures which have been pursued, with unremitting zeal for several years past, the Americans are made to believe, that Great-Bri∣tain does not wish the Colonies to make further advances towards "<HI>powerful States</HI>".—The busi∣ness then is to embarrass new settlements,—to lay such burdens on the colonies now planted as to prevent emigrations to them from the crowded parts of Europe, and establish such laws as shall render, not only the money, but the <HI>persons</HI> of Americans, the property of the British Parlia∣ment, or of the crown. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The authority of Parliament, has, within these few years, been a question much agitated; and great difficulty, we un∣derstand, has occurred, in tracing the line between the rights of the mother country, and those of the colonies.

<P>THE execution of this business has given rise to the calamities, we are this day called to lament.— The time would not allow us to go into a very particular consideration of the calamities we now feel, together with those which we fear may be permitted to fall upon us: Let it suffice to men∣tion those which most sensibly affect us.</P>
<P>SEVERAL laws, have of late been enacted by the Parliament of Great-Britain, for the express purpose of raising a revenue in America. Had those laws been executed according to their origi∣nal design, the natural operation of them, would have constantly weakened the interest of the people in general, by giving their wealth to the servants of the crown.—Had those laws been regularly executed the servants of the crown, would have had it in their power, either to riot on the spoils taken from the honest and indus∣trious, or accumulate to themselves great riches. The body of the people, being oppressed, would in time be obliged to sell their lands, and other estates, and content themselves, if contentment be possible in such a state, to be the slaves of imperious lords, on whom, hard necessity had taught them to depend, for their bread.—And should they, remembering their former happy circumstances, grow uneasy and factious, a stan∣ding

<P>THAT such laws have been enacted, and that any of them are now in force, we consider as a calamity, and lament that GOD has in judgment, suffered it to befal the American colonies.—The laws now referred to, have already done unspea∣kable damage. The struggles which have been made by administration to inforce them, and by the Americans in opposition to them, have not
<PB N="28" REF="013370_0026_0F90F3D24C35AFC8"/>
only kept the whole continent in a ferment, but created such an alienation of affections, and un∣happy jealousies between the two countries, as we have reason to fear, will never be wholly re∣moved.</P>
<P>IT is a calamity that the parliament have resol∣ved,
<Q>That colonists may be transported to En∣gland, and tried there upon accusations for treason,—or concealments of treasons commit∣ted in the colonies.</Q>
—Should any unhappy Americans be accused of treason, and prosecuted according to this act, a severe punishment would necessarily be inflicted on them, before it could be determined whether they were guilty or not.</P>
<P>IT is a calamity that the roman catholic reli∣gion is established through the vast province of Quebec, when, as a writer observes,
<Q>The abject of the bill, is to cut off all the liberties of the rest of the colonies.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The Canada Act has met with some <HI>small</HI> advocates in these parts, who pretend the roman catholic religion is <HI>not</HI> establi∣shed by it; and that nothing more is designed by that part of it which has respect to religion, than a confirmation of what was stipulated by the treaty of peace.—But what say the GRAND AMERICAN CONGRESS to this matter?—
<Q>In the session of Parliament last mentioned, an Act was passed, for changing the government of Quebec, by which Act the Roman Catholic religion, instead of being to∣lerated, as stipulated by the treaty of peace, is established.</Q></P>
<P>THE EARL OF CHATHAM has declared, that by the <HI>Ca∣nada</HI> Act, popery is <HI>established</HI>: And LORD LYTTLETON, in his Letter to the abovementioned EARL, does not deny that the Roman catholic religion is <HI>established</HI> in the Pro∣vince of Quebec, but endeavours to defend the whole Act, without exception.—After having said,
<Q>The Canadians are above one hundred thousand, the English not more than two thousand men, women, and children.</Q>
And that
<Q>the legislature was therefore to consider whether the law and government ought to be adapted to the <HI>many</HI> or the <HI>few,</HI></Q>
he goes on, to consider that part of the bill which has respect to religion; and says,—
<Q>The best distinction I know between <HI>establishment</HI> and <HI>toleration</HI> is, that the greater number has a right to the <HI>one,</HI> and the lesser to the <HI>other.</HI> The public maintenance of a clergy is inherent to <HI>establishment</HI>; at the reformation, therefore, as much of the church estates as were thought necessary for its sup∣port were transferred to the protestant church, as by law established. Surely then when the free exercise of the national religion was given to the Canadian nation, it could never be understood that they were to be deprived of their clergy▪ and if not, a national provision for that clergy followes of course.</Q>
—What we have here quo∣ted from his LORDSHIP's Letter, is sufficient to shew, that he not only considered the Canada Act as establishing the Roman catholic religion in that country, but that he supposed the British Legislature, acted a wise and equita∣ble part in so doing.—But his LORDSHIP's reasoning does not carry with it the <HI>fullest</HI> conviction.— Suppose, by a strange <HI>jesuitical</HI> influence, in some future period, more than one half the inhabitants of Great-Bri∣tain should be converted to the Roman catholic religion, would the legislature be bound in duty to <HI>establish</HI> that religion, and only <HI>tolerate</HI> Protestants?—It must be so, it seems, if the best distinction between <HI>establishment</HI> and <HI>to∣leration</HI> is, that the greater number has a <HI>right</HI> to the one, and the lesser to the other.</P>
<P>Wise legislative bodies, will examine the nature and doctrines of a religion, before they favour it with an <HI>establishment</HI>; If they find the doctrines of any religion are contrary to the holy Scriptures, and are persuaded that it is, in its na∣ture, unfriendly to the safety and happiness of the com∣munity, certainly they will not <HI>establish</HI> it, although, <HI>the greater number,</HI> (of the community) may, at present, be fond of it.—</P>
<P>Let us hear what the learned and pious BISHOP BURNET has said of roman catholics, and their religion.—
<Q>It is certain, that as all Papists must, at all times, be <HI>ill</HI> sub∣jects to a protestant Prince, so that is much more to be apprehended, when there is a pretended Popish <HI>heir</HI> in the case.</Q>
—
<Q>Learn to view popery in a true light, as a conspiracy to exalt the power of the clergy, even by subjecting the most sacred truths of religion to contri∣vances for raising their authority, and by offering to the world <HI>another method of being saved, besides that prescribed in the gospel.</HI>— Popery is a mass of impostures, suppor∣ted by men, who manage them with great <HI>advantages,</HI> and impose them with inexpressible <HI>severities,</HI> on those who dare call any thing in question that they dictate to them.</Q></P>
<BIBL>BISHOP BURNET's <HI>History of his own times.</HI></BIBL>
<P>If the roman catholic religion is what the good Bishop has here declared, is it not astonishing, that any <HI>Protestant</HI> can plead for its <HI>establishment!</HI> For a British legislature to <HI>tolerate</HI> such a religion, is as much, one would think, as they could do consistent with their duty to GOD, and to that constitution of civil government, which they are bound to maintain.—</P>
<P>It may be said a religion is established, where there are laws for the support of it.—Thus is the church of England esta∣blished in a great part of the British dominions.—Thus are the congregational order and discipline established in this Province, and thus is the roman catholic religion esta∣blished in Canada.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>WE view it as a calamity, that our most gracious King was pleased to give his royal assent to the Canada Act, by which he has <HI>grie∣ved</HI> the greatest part of his faithful subjects.— But I forbear.—That unfortunate Prince, who was obliged to fly from Great-Britain, to make way for the <HI>Hanoverian</HI> succession, was charged among other things, <HI>with promoting the Roman catholic Religion</HI>—May the reign of our present rightful Sovereign be long and happy.—May he ever enjoy the full confidence, and affection of <HI>all,</HI> and <HI>especially</HI> of his protestant subjects.</P>
<P>WE view it as a calamity, that the Parlia∣ment have passed an act to alter our ancient method of appointing Juries.—With a Gover∣nor and Council intirely dependent on the crown: With Judges and Sheriffs dependent on the Go∣vernor, and all intirely independent on the peo∣ple, we cannot suppose there is provision for the impartial administration of justice: But we have the greatest reason to fear, should any Ame∣ricans be so unhappy, as to be brought into a dispute with crown officers, or any, who on account of their <HI>good disposition</HI> towards some late acts of Parliament respecting the Colonies, are called <HI>friends of Government,</HI> a jury returned by such sheriffs, would be under an influence, ex∣tremely threatning to the lives and liberties, of
<PB N="33" REF="013370_0031_0F90F3D6CDAD6378"/>
such unfortunate subjects.</P>
<P>THE noble Lords who entered their dissent, have given a reason, which has respect to this part of the Act for regulating the government, sufficient to convince every mind capable of fee∣ling the force of argument, and is worthy to be writ in letters of gold.—They dissent,—
<Q>Be∣cause the Governor and Council have the means of returning such a Jury, in each par∣ticular cause, as may best suit with the gra∣tification of their passions and interests. The lives, liberties and properties of the subject are put into their hands without controul, and the invaluable right of trial by jury is turned into A SNARE FOR THE PEOPLE, who have hitherto looked upon it as their main security against the licentiousness of power.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Much to our purpose is the following extract from Doctor PETTINGAL's celebrated Enquiry into the use and practice of Juries among the Greeks and Romans.</P>
<P><Q>The privilege that every Englishman enjoys of having his person and property so far secured, that no injury, under pretence of law can be done to one or the other, but by the consent and approbation of twelve men of his own rank, is the greatest happiness that can belong to a sub∣ject, and the most valuable blessing that can attend society; for by this means the poor stands in no fear of oppressi∣on from his governor or powerful neighbour; and the hands of the great are tied up from disturbing the public by making inroads upon the ease and property of indi∣viduals below them.—So that the powers of each, in their respective stations, are hereby happily directed to carry on one and the same end, the peace, order, and good go∣vernment of the whole.</Q></P>
<P>In another place the same great Man writes,—
<Q>The trial by Jury was founded on liberty, and contrived both in the Grecian and Roman polity, as a guard and protection of the lower people, against the <HI>power</HI> and arbitrary judg∣ments of their superiors.</Q>
—And again,
<Q>Civil liberty, being thus, both in Grece and Rome, founded in <HI>equali∣ty,</HI> that is, a joint power and participation of enacting and executing laws, we hence see the reason why the <HI>trial by our equals,</HI> the <HI>legale judicium parium sucrum,</HI> makes so great a figure in the character of English liberties; for while we are bound by no laws but those <HI>we consent to,</HI> and suffer no judgment under those laws but by the approbation of honest men of our own rank and conditi∣on, who have no interest in injustice, but an expectation of the same candor and integrity in us upon some other occasions, where perhaps we may be a jury on them or their affairs, there is no danger of being ruined and un∣done by arbitrary laws, or oppressed by the partial deter∣mination of a corrupt Judge. This was the liberty and happiness that arose from the <HI>equality</HI> which was the foun∣dation of the Greek and Roman constitution, and is <HI>the very spirit and life of our own.</HI></Q> —p. 8. in Preface, 1.25, &amp; 26. in the <HI>Enquiry.</HI>.—</P></NOTE></P>

<P>ATTEMPTS to execute this act have already slung the Province into great disorder.—The in∣habitants consider their charter, granted on the faith of Kings, as sacred, and they cannot be prevailed with, either by flattery or threats, to give it up.—Those Gentlemen who have accepted the place of Counsellors on the new plan, are viewed as unfriendly to our constitu∣tional liberties:—Our Courts of Justice are shut

<P>"TO change the government of a people", says the BISHOP of St. ASAPH, who is an honour to the <HI>sacred order,</HI> and an ornament to human nature,—
<Q>to change the government of a peo∣ple without their consent, is the highest and most arbitrary act of sovereignty that one na∣tion can exercise over another. The Romans hardly ever proceeded to this extremity, even over a conquered nation, 'till its frequent re∣volts and insurrections, had made them deem it incorrigible.—The very idea of it implies a most total and abject, slavish depen∣dence in the inferior state.</Q></P>

<P>THE noble Lords, who opposed the bill for regulating the government of this Province, entered their dissent,—
<Q>Because, say they, we think the appointment of all the members of the Council, which by this bill is vested in the crown, is not a proper provision for pre∣serving the equilibrium of the colony consti∣tution.

<P>IT is supposed by the rigorous manner in which the port act is executed, poverty, distress and calamity, are brought on 30,000 souls. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The damages arising from the execution of the Port Act are immense: Supposing 30000 people suffer the loss of 1<HI>s</HI> sterling pr day, one with another; which I believe will be judged far short of what is <HI>real,</HI> considering the destruction of Trade,— the multitudes flung into idleness,—the useless condition of shipping, Wharfs, Stores, Ware-Houses &amp;c. And the da∣mages the last Six months will be 270000 <HI>pounds Sterling.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>OTHER calamities might have been mentioned, and those we have taken notice of enlarged upon, did the time admit.—You will just allow me to say, should the British administration deter∣mine fully to execute the laws, of which we com∣plain: Or in other words,—should the prime mi∣nister determine to LAY THE AMERICANS AT HIS FEET; and should the new parliament grant supplies for that purpose, we have yet to fear the calamities of a <HI>long</HI> civil war: For, from the spirit now raised through this continent, and the <HI>firm union</HI> which subsists, it may be presumed the struggle would be obstinate.</P>
<P>AMERICANS, who have been used to war from their infancy, would spill their best blood, rather than
<Q><PB N="39" REF="013370_0037_0F9056875B999128"/>submit to be hewers of wood, or drawers of water, for any ministry or nation in the world.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the address of the American Congress to the People of Great-Britain.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT we hope in GOD, and it shall be our daily prayer, that matters may never come to this.—We hope some wise and equitable plan of accommo∣dation may take place.—For the salvation of the parent state, as well as of these provinces, we sin∣cerely hope the measures, with respect to Ameri∣ca, adopted by the <HI>last</HI> parliament, and pursued with vigour by the ministry, may be essentially altered by <HI>this.</HI></P>
<P>WE hope the rights and liberties of the colonies may be established on a solid and immoveable ba∣sis: And that this Town may emerge from its present distressed and most calamitous state, and be a more prosperous, more rich and happy place than ever yet it has been.</P>
<P>LET us then humble ourselves before God on account of our sins: Let us reform whatever is amiss,—
<Q>That so God may be pleased to continue to us the blessings we enjoy, and remove the tokens of his displeasure, by cau∣sing harmony and union to be restored be∣tween Great-Britain and these Colonies, that we may again rejoice in the smiles of our sovereign, and the possession of those privileges which have been transmitted to us, and have the hopeful prospect that they shall be han∣ded down intire to posterity, under the pro∣testant succession, in the illustrious House of HANOVER.</Q>
