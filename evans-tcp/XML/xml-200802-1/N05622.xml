<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>LTHOUGH I am persuaded that nothing hath a greater Tendency to strengthen the Hands of Infidels, than the too frequent Altercations between the Professors of Christianity; yet there are certain Occasions wherein the necessary Defence of the Principles of our holy Religion, as well as the Practice of it, renders public Remon∣strances of the greatest Use and Importance. The sacred Pages afford us many Examples of this Nature. When <HI>Aaron</HI> was prevailed on by the <HI>Israelites</HI> to make a golden Calf, and offer Sacrifice to it, what a holy Indignation did <HI>Moses</HI> express both against him and them! — When <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were carried away with the Dissimulation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> how openly did the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> with∣stand them to the Face▪ and reprove them be∣fore all, because they were to be blamed▪ and

<P>Pardon me therefore, <HI>my Lord,</HI> if at length, though with great Regret, as the Searcher of Hearts knows, I am constrained to inform <HI>your Lordship,</HI> that you, together with some of your <HI>leading</HI> Brethren, have been unhap∣pily instrum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntal in misguiding many real, simple, honest-hearted Christians; of distres∣sing, if not totally ruining numerous Families, and introducing a whole <HI>Farrago</HI> of supersti∣tious, not to say idolatrou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fopperies into the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> Nation.</P>

Sure I am that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e can find no Traces of many of her present Practices in the yet more ancient, I mean the primitive Churches, and which, we all know, were really under an immediate and truly apostolical In∣spection.</P>
<P>Will <HI>your Lordship</HI> be pleased to give me Leave to descend to a few Particulars? Pray, <HI>my Lord,</HI> what Instances have we of the first Christians walking round the Graves of their deceased Friends on <HI>Easter-day,</HI> attended with Hautboys, Trumpets, French horns, Violin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and other Kinds of musical Instruments? Or where have we the least Mention made of Pictures of particular Persons being brought into the first Christian Assemblies, and of Candles being placed behind them, in order to give a transparent View of these Figures?—— Where was it ever known that the Picture of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> representing him handing a Gentleman and Lady up to the Side of

JESUS CHRIST, was ever introduced into the primitive Love-feasts? Or do we ever hear, <HI>my Lord,</HI> of Incense, or something like it, being burnt for him, in order to perfume the Room before he made his Entrance among the Brethren? Or can it be supposed that he, who, together with <HI>Barnabas,</HI> so eagerly re∣pelled the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aonians,</HI> when they brought Oxen and Garlands, in order to sacrifice unto them, would ever have suffered such Things to be done for him, without expressing his Ab∣horrence and Detestation of them? And yet <HI>your Lordship</HI> knows both these have been done for you, and suffered by you, without your having shewn, as far as I can hear, the least Dislike of them at all <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I might here take Notice of the married Women's being ordered to we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Blue Knots</HI>: the single Women <HI>Pink</HI>; and those that are just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rrigeable, <HI>Pink</HI> and <HI>White</HI>; the Widows that are pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Child beating, <HI>White</HI>; and those that are not so, <HI>Blue</HI> and <HI>White:</HI> And also of the Episcopal Knot of Mrs. <HI>Hannah Nitschman,</HI> (who is, I am informed, the present General Eldress of the Congre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation) which is sometimes of a <HI>Purple,</HI> and some∣times of a <HI>Ros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Colour.

The Room was illuminated with Wax-tapers, and Musicians placed in an adjacent Apartment, while the Company performed their Devotions, and regaled themselves with Sweetmeats, Coffee, Tea, and Wine. After this the Labourers departed, and the single Brethren were ad∣mitted in.

<P>But this is not all; I have another Question to propose to <HI>your Lordship.</HI> Pray, <HI>my Lord,</HI> did any of the Apostles or Leaders of the pri∣mitive Churches ever usurp an Authority not only over People's Consciences but Properties also, or draw in the Members of their respec∣tive Congregations to dispose of whole Patri∣monies at once, or to be bound for Thousands more than they knew in their own Consciences they were worth?

And how piti∣able, <HI>my Lord,</HI> must the present Circumstances of young Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">The Case of Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> is very singular: He was of a mean Birth and Occupation, but, upon the unexpected falling of many Lives, became suddenly possessed of an Estate of above Four Hundred Pounds a Year; and, to serve the Brethren, after many Importunities, he was induced to dispose of it. Mr. <HI>Lee,</HI> the Banker, purchased it, and Mess. <HI>Freeman</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> received Six Thousand Pounds of the Money towards what was due to them. Besides this, Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> was bound for many Thousands more. This made him very uneasy, and fearing the Consequence, he one Afternoon, about ten Weeks ago, stole an Interview with two single Brethren, and beseeched them for Christ's sake to let him have Twenty-five Pounds, for the Payment of which he left them his Watch, Bureau, Horse and Saddle. He then took his Leave, saying, in all Probability he should never see them any more; and having nothing to sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re to leave behind for his poor Mother, (who is since dead) was content to send her a few parting Lines. Since he has been gone, the Horse, Watch, Bureau, and Saddle, were sold for Twenty-seven Pounds and Three Shillings; so that the young Man has the Balance in Bank. GOD grant that this may prove the last Person that may be imposed on in this Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>!</NOTE> be, who, to stop a

little of the above-mentioned Gap, was pre∣vailed on, <HI>your Lordship</HI> knows by whom, about Eighteen Months ago, to sell his Estate of above Four Hundred Pounds a Year, and went, or was sent off very lately, as I am as∣sured, to <HI>France,</HI> (leaving a destitute Mother behind him) only with Twenty-five Pounds; for the Payment of which he left his Watch, Bureau, Horse and Saddle.</P>
<P>These are but a few Instances, <HI>my Lord,</HI> amongst many, indeed, too, too many, that might be given. The Brethren's Agents, and those concerned with them, can best tell what horrid Equivocations, Untruths, and low Ar∣tifices, have been made use of to procure Mo∣ney, at high Interests, wherever it was to be had, in order to keep up the Brethren's Cre∣dit in that poor, lame Manner it has been kept up for a considerable Time. Was the whole Scene to be opened, I believe every one would be of Opinion that such an eccle∣siastical Project never was heard of before in any Part of his Majesty's Dominions.</P>
<P>This, <HI>my Lord,</HI> the Royal Exchange has long since rung of; and if the same Part has been acted abroad <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">It appears too plain from Mr. <HI>Rimius,</HI> that this has been the Case. And no Wonder, since he quotes this Assertion of the Counts from his own Writings, <Q>The <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mists</HI> of the Society, may say to a young rich Man, Either give us all thou hast, or get the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gone."</Q></NOTE>, how many Families must have been ruined there, how many more
<PB N="14" REF="007136_0014_102AFD282EEA5C58"/>
be yet ruined, in order to fill up the present <HI>English</HI> Chasm; and consequently what Loads of Guilt must needs lie at the Door of some∣body!</P>
<P>Surely, the LORD of Lords, whose Eyes are like a Flame of Fire, and who re∣quires Truth in the inward Parts, will one Day or other visit for these Things, by bring∣ing to Light the hidden Things of Darkness, and thereby making manifest the Counsels of the Hearts.</P>
<P>I need not inform <HI>your Lordship</HI> that <HI>Babels</HI> are generally suffered to be built pretty high, before GOD comes down to confound the Language of the Builders. If Knaves are employed, (as commonly they are) GOD's Honour is concerned to discover them; and if any of his own Children are undesignedly drawn in, (which is frequently the Case) He who hath promised not to suffer them to be tempted above what they are able to bear, will in Mercy, some Way or other, rebuke the Tempter, and make a Way for them to escape. It is true, this, in public Concerns, may sometimes expose them to a little worldly Contempt, and, for a While, they may seem∣ingly be crushed under the Rubbish of the fal∣len Fabric; but even this shall work together for their Good; and happy will it be for them, if, after all, they at length learn this important Lesson, viz. <HI>That it is dangerous, upon any Pretence whatsoever, to go from the
<PB N="15" REF="007136_0015_102AFD2A8417DA00"/>
written Word, or give up their Consciences to the Guidance of my Man, or Body of Men under Heaven.</HI> This, <HI>your Lordship</HI> well knows, is what weak and unstable Souls are too apt to do, and artful and designing Men, who are fond of Power, especially if naturally they are of an am∣bitious Turn of Mind, easily catch at the pleasing Bait. But Honesty, <HI>my Lord,</HI> will be found to be the best Policy after all: And therefore God forbid that any who call themselves the Followers of the Lamb should glory in any thing save the Cross of CHRIST.</P>
<P>At present I shall add no more, but earnest∣ly saying <HI>Amen</HI> to that Part of the Brethren's <HI>Litany,</HI> however exceptionable in other Re∣spects, <HI>From untimely Projects, and from un∣happily becoming great, keep us our good Lord and God</HI>; and as heartily praying, that the glorious JESUS may prosper all that is Right, and give Grace to correct and amend all that is Wrong among all his People of all Denominations; I subscribe myself,</P>
