<P>With all the Christian Charities most affectionately beloved! Give ear, I beseech you, to the wise counsel of the Eldest of Apostles, who hath directed our attention to the more sure word of prophecy, whereunto we do well, that we take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star arise in our hearts: And this word, which came not in old time by the will of Man, but was spoken by Holy Men of God, who spake as they were moved of the Holy Spirit, hath testified before hand, on this wise, in the 31st Chapter of JEREMIAH and the 6th Verse.</P>
<Q>—THERE SHALL BE A DAY, THAT THE WATCHMEN UPON THE MOUNT EPHRAIM, SHALL CRY, ARISE YE, LET US GO UP TO ZION UNTO THE LORD OUR GOD.</Q>
<BIBL>31st JEREMIAH, 6th Verse.</BIBL>
<P>AND was there a day, when the Watchmen of Ephraim which is Israel, did cry, and in the language of antecedent prophecy, say, arise ye, let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God? Yes, verily, there was; and of this day, emphatically, it may be said, as David spake in ancient time, behold, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which the Lord hath made, let us rejoice therein, and be glad with exceeding great joy.—Indeed, it is the day of days, anointed with the oil of glad∣ness above its fellows, and infinitely more glo∣rious than the day of creation, when the morn∣ing
<PB N="6" REF="029410_0005_0FE17241A634AF78"/>
stars sang together, and all the first born sons of immortality shouted loud for joy. To this day, the day that we are now assembled to ce∣lebrate, the day of the advent of Shiloh, Im∣manuel, God manifest in the flesh, our general progenitors looked forward through an eye of faith, and worshipping the Bruizer of the Ser∣pent's head, as they leaned on the Staff of Hope, a better and a more enduring Paradise, than that of Eden presented to view.—This, also, was the day which Abraham and his fel∣low heirs of the same promise, beheld afar off, as in the visions of the Almighty, and rejoiced in spirit to see, although at two thousand years distance; for the solemnity of an oath and the immutability of Jehovah had not only promised, but on this day, more abundantly confirmed, all spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ Jesus, the Saviour of the World, to all the Na∣tions of the Earth.—Nor did the Patriarchs, who by faith have obtained a good report, alone bear testimony to the dawn of the day spring from on high. —The Law which came by Moses, as the appointed shadow of good things to come, was reflected from the body of Jesus,
<PB N="7" REF="029410_0006_0FE172439FD36660"/>
full of grace and of truth; and all that was made according to the pattern shewed on Mount Sinai, exhibited in lively figures, the eternal purpose purposed in Christ, of whom the whole family in Heaven and in Earth is named.—A∣nother, and a far greater cloud of witnesses en∣compass us around: They are raised up from their beds where they lie in glory, and being dead, they yet speak in the name of the Lord: These are the Prophets, who diligently enquir∣ed concerning so great Salvation, and prophe∣sied of the exceeding abundance of the riches of Grace, which from before the World began, was hid with Christ in God. The spirit of all prophecy is the testimony of Jesus, the Won∣derful, the Counsellor, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace; and the pens of these ready writers have noted in the Scriptures of truth, the birth, the life, the sufferings and the consequent glory of Messiah. How beautiful, ye Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, encompassing the walls of Jerusalem, were your footsteps in every intermediate age! Yours, in truth, were the feet of them, who brought good tidings of good, glad tidings of great joy, being shod with
<PB N="8" REF="029410_0007_0FE17245270DA670"/>
the preparation of the glorious Gospel of the Blessed; whilst your tongues, in the language of eloquent oratory, publishing Peace and pro∣claiming Salvation, said, unto Zion, God even thy God reigneth, and cried, unto the ends of Earth, Behold, the Desire of all Nations com∣eth.</P>
<P>Amid this illustrious Assembly of glorified El∣ders, there appeareth One, divinely exalted above his fellow servants. Lo, he descendeth on the outstretched pinions of love: His gar∣ments are light, reflecting light caelestial: It is Gabriel, who standeth in the presence of God: Welcome, thrice welcome, all hail, thou Angel of the Lord: Thou comest as a ministering Spirit, ministering unto Salvation's heirs: We know thee, who thou art, the highly favored of the most Highest: It was thine, to administer those consolations which are neither small nor few, to the Man greatly beloved in ancient days: It was thine to gladden the heart of Zacharias, as worshipping on the right side of the Altar of incense: It was thine to announce the rising of the Sun of Righteousness, to the virgin daughter of the humblest tribe amid
<PB N="9" REF="029410_0008_0FE17248D01566B0"/>
Judaea's thousands: It was thine, to rejoice the spirits of adoring Shepherds by the blessed tidings of a Saviour, who is Christ, the Lord: It was thine, to lead forth thy fellow watch∣men, thrones, dominions, principalities and powers, when every golden harp was tuned to notes of love, and tongues of Cherubim and Seraphim in concert sang, Glory unto God in the heights of the highest, and on earth, peace, good will towards men.</P>
<P>And did the four Spirits of the living God, who rest not day nor night, from praise, keep jubilee on this auspicious morn? Did the El∣ders, seated round the rainbow encircled throne, cast down their crowns, fall prostrate and adore? Did the fulness of the hosts of heaven, ten thousand times ten thousand and thousand of thousands worship the First Begot∣ten when brought into the world? And shall man, for whom this Child was born, shall man, to whom the Son is freely given, refuse the homage of Caelestial Potentates? Nor to the Lamb made known, ascribe all honor, blessing, might, dominion, majesty and strength, whilst from his inmost soul, the ransomed of Heaven,
<PB N="10" REF="029410_0009_0FE1724A5D680F98"/>
redeemed from above, he breathes amen, amen. Forbid it, gratitude for mercy un∣deserved! Forbit it love, for love unmerit∣ed! Come, let us then arise, and going up to Bethlehem Ephratah, see the place where the Lord is laid, and search out the habitation of the Holy One of Israel.—It is the voice of the Watchmen of Ephraim which crieth, arise, shine, for your light is come: His companions in bliss, to their fellows cry, the glory of the Lord is revealed: And trumpet-tongued Her∣alds respond, that all flesh shall see salvation to∣gether.</P>
<P>Men, Brethren and Fathers, wherewith shall we come before the King, the Lord of Hosts on this morning, or bow ourselves in the presence of the most High God? What thanks shall we render unto Him for his excellent loving kind∣ness? how shall we praise Him worthily for his unspeakable gift? The Spirit and the Bride hath said, come, and let him that heareth say, come, and let whosoever will, come up hither, and worship. May our hearts be deeply impressed, with a solemnized sense of the gracious invita∣tion, and every tongue adopting the language
<PB N="11" REF="029410_0010_0FE1724C4E7ED0C0"/>
of the Prodigal, answer aloud, I will arise and go up to my Father's house. At a moment like this, the world and its fashion which are pas∣sing away should have no charms. At an hour like the present, the lust of ambition, the love of Mammon, and the zest for pleasures falsely so called, ought to be extinguished, and the whole man, in body, in spirit and in soul, alive only unto God. For this is the fulness of time, which Angels from everlasting girded up the loins of their minds, with sobriety, stedfastly to gaze upon: And the bringing in of the First Begotten into the world, shall henceforth be ce∣lebrated in the many mansions of eternity, by the spirits of the just already perfected, and the general assembly delivered from great tribu∣lation. Arise, therefore, ye that dwell in dust and sing. Awake thou, that sleepest! leave the cares of life, the deceitfulness of riches, the piercing sorrows of pleasure, in the vally of Achor beneath; and towering on the wings of faith, ascend Mount Zion's sacred top, for there hath the Almighty set his own Anointed, the first born of his strength, the man, my Fellow, saith the Lord, and worship him, all ye Gods, is the high command.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="029410_0011_0FE1724DD528A810"/>My Fathers, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof! My Brethren, in the three fold cord of Adam, Solomon and Jesus Christ! My Sisters, accounted as the glory of the man! indulge me, to persuade with all gentleness; suffer me, to entreat as a Brother; permit, that I fervently beseech your undivided attention, in the fellowship of the Spirit and the bond of Charity, whilst the dignity of the brightness of the glory of God; the wonderful works of the express image of his person; the beauty of the example set forth in his most holy pattern, and the excellence of the commandment whereunto we are delivered, shall energetical∣ly enforce the cry of the Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, who lift up their voices tegether and say, arise ye, and let us go up to Zion, unto the Lord our God, the God of Angels, and the God of men.</P>
<P>Who is the Saviour born this day in David's city? What babe is that within the manger laid? Whose are these swaddling clothes? Hath the burning Seraphim put off the body full of light? Has Gabriel come down to dwell in thick darkness? Does Abraham the friend of
<PB N="13" REF="029410_0012_0FE17252A71E2130"/>
God tabernacle with men? Is one of the old Prophets born again? No, verily, no.—Jesus, the Saviour born to day, Christ the Lord with∣in the manger laid, the second Adam wrapped in swaddling clothes, is exalted above all these names, is higher than every name that is named in heaven, or in earth.—Unto which of the Angels hath it been said, at any time, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? Who is the Patriarch, of whom it is written, I will be to him a Father and he shall be to me a Son? To which of the Prophets, is it spoken, sit thou on the right hand of the Majesty on high? God at sundry times and in diverse manners, spake in time past, unto our fathers, by them. The vision of the ancients hath failed. The pro∣phesies of the Prophets are sealed. The minis∣try of flames of fire is done away. He now is come, who hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name, even the appointed Heir of all things, by whom also the worlds were made, and unto whom it is said, by Him, who giveth not his glory to another, thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; and, thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth; and the heavens are the work of
<PB N="14" REF="029410_0013_0FE172542F0D1310"/>
thine hands: They shall perish: But thou re∣mainest: As a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. It is the Lord your Creator, the Creator of all things, whether visible or invisible, without whom no∣thing was made, that is made, who is found in fashion as an infant: It is He who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, and in whom the fulness of the God∣head dwelleth bodily, who hath put on▪ the similitude of a babe: It is He, whose gracious providence extends from the rising of the sun, to the chambers of the west; whose domin∣ion ruleth over all, from the Ministring Spirit of the inner court, to the little sparrow nestling on his altar, who hath assumed the likeness of a child. —The glorified with glory before all worlds were, saw there was no man: The Alpha, the Omega wondered there was no in∣tercessor: The beginning, the ending, the Al∣mighty looked, there was none to help: The Lord, who was, who is, and who is to come, beheld, and there was none to uphold: He therefore took upon himself the seed of Abra∣ham; and in as much, as the children were par∣takers
<PB N="15" REF="029410_0014_0FE17255B64FAFC0"/>
of flesh and blood, he also took part of the same: On his bosom is the breast plate of Righteousness: Upon his head, is the helmet of Salvation: Faithfulness and truth are the gir∣dle of his reins: He is encompassed with the garments of vengeance: He is clad with zeal as with a mantle: His right hand, most migh∣ty, bears the sword of the spirit: In his left hand, is the shield of the unchangeable promi∣ses, yea and amen: And clothed upon with the whole armor of God, He is divinely prepared, for the combat against principalities and pow∣ers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high pla∣ces. No marvel indeed, that Israel's sweet Psalmist exclaimed, Lord, what is Man that thou art so mindful of him, or the son of man that he is visited thus? No wonder in truth, that the Apostle of the Gentiles copied the words of the Royal Writer, when Jesus appear∣ed a little lower than the Angels of his power, and being made perfect in the sufferings of death, worked out the far more exceeding and eternal weight of Salvation.</P>
<P>Respected as Fathers, beloved as Brethren,
<PB N="16" REF="029410_0015_0FE1725802056CF0"/>
esteemed as Sisters, arise ye and go up unto Zion with your fellow servants of the house∣hold of heaven. Let not the Watchmen of Mount Ephraim plead in vain. The goodly company of Patriarchs and Prophets, the holy fellowship of Apostles and Martyrs, the glo∣rious Host of the High Ones, on high, await your arrival: There is more joy in their pre∣sence, over one, who cometh up from the wil∣derness, leaning on the Beloved, than over nine∣ty and nine of the church of the First Born, already assembled in the city of everlasting solemnities, the beautiful for situation, and the praise of the whole earth. Verily, verily, the dignity of the brightness of the glory of God, the all fulness of the Eternal, mysteriously veil∣ed in the express image of His person, is infi∣nitely worthy of your most fervent adoration, and highly meriteth the boundless hosanna of praise: For eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, of all the glories of the divinity concentred in the adorable nature of the great Redeemer, where, righteousness and truth have met together; where, mercy and peace have embraced each other. Alass! O
<PB N="17" REF="029410_0016_0FE1725A92B34EC8"/>
wretched men that we are! The strongest powers of mortal vision, beholding through a glass darkly, are inadequate to these Pisgah heights of sublimest contemplations: The most enlarged faculties of the mind, obscured by a body of sin and death, are incapable of fully comprehending the great mystery of Godli∣ness, God manifest in the flesh, seen of Angels, believed on in the world and received up into glory. Such knowledge is too wonderful for us, in our present state of infancy. The complete assurance of understanding is reserved, to en∣hance that joy which is unspeakable, when these vile bodies shall be changed, by the migh∣ty energies of the Resurrection Morn, and fashioned like unto the Glorious Body, shewn on Mount Tabor. The deep things of God, which reason cannot by searching find out, Revela∣tion hath made known in a measure of perfec∣tion. Take ye, therefore, the volume of the book, as it is written, for your unerring guide. To the law and the testimony, for the com∣plex character of Immanuel, God with man. Search ye the scriptures, these are they that testify of Jesus, most blessed forever: And if
<PB N="18" REF="029410_0017_0FE1725C81BE26D8"/>
every member of the one body of the Lord, doth not see eye unto eye, nevertheless, each one hath abundant cause of gratitude and thanksgiving, in as much as Divine Benignity, unparalled in condescension, hath graciously delineated the Angel of the great Counsel, the Mighty God and the Father of every age, as the Son of Man, born of a woman, made under the law, and in all things like unto his bre∣thren, sin only excepted.</P>
<P>Mine Elders, with whom are the ancient of human days, my brethren kindly affectioned in love, my sisters, hoping for the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ unto life everlasting! At the footstool of the throne of Deity, high and lifted up, let us worship and bow down and kneel together, giving thanks unto the Lord our Maker, Preserver, and Redeemer, calling upon his name, and making known his deeds among the people; for He being gracious, full of compassion, and great in mercy, hath hol∣den his servant Israel, as he spake unto their fathers, and shewed light unto the Gentiles, who sat in darkness and the shadow of death:
<PB N="19" REF="029410_0018_0FE1725E68F96528"/>
Having visited and redeemed the heathen his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth his possession: Raising up an horn of sal∣vation in the house of David, as witnessed by the mouth of his holy Prophets which have been since the world began: And performing the promised mercy, even the oath, which he sware unto Abraham, that he would deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and give the knowledge of salvation, by the remission of sins. These beautiful outlines of grace, mercy and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, form only a part of the exceeding great and precious promises, which receiv∣ed their accomplishment, as yea and Amen, in the man of God's right hand, the man made strong for himself; those which remain are more than can be numbered; the one half cannot be reckoned up in order. Here, there∣fore, we make a solemn pause, calling upon our ransomed souls, and all that is immortal within us, seriously to consider the fulfilment of the word of truth, that went before the dawn of the day spring from on high: And being built on the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles,
<PB N="20" REF="029410_0019_0FE1726052659840"/>
laying none other corner stone, than that which is laid in Zion, may our eyes be blessed in beholding those things, which many kings and righteous men desired to see and saw them not, and our spirits rejoice with joy unspeaka∣ble in God our Saviour, whilst all the goodness, as all the glory of Jehovah passes onwards be∣fore us, in the wonderful works of the arm of the Lord made bare, when the heavens were bowed beneath the feet of Jesus, and the fairer than the sons of men, the chiefest among ten thousands, was manifest in fashion as a man, re∣joicing in the habitable parts of the earth, hav∣ing his delights with the children of Adam, uttering the speech of benevolence from day unto day, shewing forth the handy work of benefi∣cence from night unto night, and preferring the eternal redemption of a guilty, rebel and apostate race, above the adoration of Angels, the morning songs of the church first born, the noon tide shouting of the spirits of the just, or the evening hallelujahs of the general as∣sembly.</P>

from Nazareth, towards the waters of Jordan, and is baptized of John, the messenger of the Lord, sent to prepare the way, to make his paths straight, and proclaim the coming of the mightier than himself, the latchet of whose shoes, he was not worthy to stoop down and unloose. Immediately the heavens were open∣ed, the Holy Spirit descended like a dove, and there came a voice from the most excellent glory, saying, this is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased. From this moment, the public ministry of the minister of the true ta∣bernacle commenced. From this hour, the once anoin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, covering Cherub, whose dwel∣ling in elder days was on the holy mountain, prepared himself for the combat. Did the Captain of Salvation hesitate to go up from the swellings of Jordan? Was Ariel dismayed as he entered on the habitation of the strong man armed? No. Verily, No. Satan essayed his utmost powers. Thrice he turned the battle to the gate: Thrice he was foiled in the dar∣ing attack. The Lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed. The conqueror of Adam was con∣quered. Do we ask, why the Son of God en∣tered
<PB N="22" REF="029410_0021_0FE17265353F0310"/>
on the wilderness, abode with wild beasts, and was tempted of the Tempter for forty days? Reason herself must respond, that this could not be, to encircle the brow of the Ce∣lestial Warrior with the diadem of personal victory; and Revelation answereth aloud; on every page it is inscribed in capitals.</P>
<Q><L>For man, the combat was begun!</L>
<L>The battle fought, the victory, won!</L></Q>
<P>Again, the Adversary cometh on like a flood: He had only departed for a season: In the hour and the power of darkness, all his strength is collected, and the garden of Gethsemane ex∣hibits the most awful contest, which had ever been witnessed from the foundations of earth. The man of sorrows, and the acquainted with grief, is exceeding sorrowful in soul, even unto death; but the Prince of this world obtaineth not a momentary triumph: There is nothing in the holy, the harmless and the undefiled, of which he can take hold. The foreordained bruizer of the serpent's head, is more than con∣queror: Even death the last enemy, who hunted for the precious life, on the top of Mount Calvary, returns back his sword empty from the slain: Himself is abolished: He that
<PB N="23" REF="029410_0022_0FE17267212B7C50"/>
had death's power is destroyed. The prey is taken from the mighty: The captives of the terrible are delivered: Spoiled principalities made a shew of openly, on the morn of the re∣surrection: And the true Abinoam leading cap∣tivity captive ascendeth victorious to our Fa∣ther and to our God.—Lift up your heads Oye gates, and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in, is the Mandate of the Eternal, the Immortal, the In∣visible. Who is this King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle, is the solemn response.—The gates of eternity lift up their heads.— The everlasting doors of the heavenly mansions are lifted up.— The King of Glory, the Lord of Hosts, the King of Glory enters: And the ransomed of Jehovah, returning to Zion, with joy and glad∣ness and everlasting songs of praise, ascribe sal∣vation unto the Lamb, and to Him that sitteth upon the throne, forever and ever.</P>
<P>Men, Brethren and Fathers, with all the christian charities most affectionately belov∣ed! O sing unto the Lord a new song, for he
<PB N="24" REF="029410_0023_0FE172690CCF76F8"/>
hath done marvellous things; His right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory over sin: He hath broken the staff of death, and the sceptre of the Ruler in darkness. A∣pollyon, who smote the people in wrath, Abad∣don who ruled the nations in anger is perse∣cuted▪ Lucifer, the son of the morning hath fallen from heaven: The man that made the earth to tremble is cut down to the ground. The prisoners of hope are delivered from the pit in the which there is no water: The cap∣tive exiles are loosed from the chains of death: They shall break forth into singing, clap their hands together, and adoring, exclaim, thou, O God, hast rescued from the jaw teeth of the Lion: Thou hast redeemed from the low dun∣geon of the Destroyer. The sighing of the prisoner, the groaning of the appointed to die came before Thee: According to the strength of thy power, thou didst break in pieces the gates of brass, and dissolve asunder the bars of iron. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, be the glory: Thou alone art worthy of everlast∣ing praise, and thine is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the majesty of vic∣tory.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="029410_0024_0FE1726CDF380508"/>Again, the watchmen of Mount Ephraim lift up the voice, and earnestly entreat, that ye arise, and go up unto Zion to the Lord your God. The Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been of old, from the womb of the morn of e∣ternity, is gone up before you to Bethlehem Ephratah; he hath returned in the power of the spirit from the wilderness; and every moment of his life adds another seal to his all glorious character; testifying that he is come, of whom Moses in the law, and of whom the Prophets did write, even Jesus of Nazareth, the true Messias; Neither have we any reason to look for another, who can do more miracles than he hath done, or give higher evidence, than his works have given, that indeed, he is the Christ of God. As eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, speech to the dumb, feet to the lame, healing to the diseased, strength to the weak, cleansing to the leper, bread to the hun∣gry, drink to the thirsty, life to the dead, and the gospel to the poor, his morning travel, noon∣tide journey and evening progress bear indubi∣table witness, that he is graciously touched with the feeling of every human infirmity, prompt to relieve the extremest misery, and able to
<PB N="26" REF="029410_0025_0FE1726E99969920"/>
save even unto the very uttermost. Behold, the man who had been bound with fetters and chains, whose dwelling was among the tombs, and so exceeding fierce that none could tame him; possessed with a legion of those infernal spi∣rits, who had entered by violence on the ruin∣ed temple of the Holy Ghost, he is delivered in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, from their cruel, vindictive and malignant power: He is clothed of Jesus, sits down calmly at his feet, and restored from outrageous phrenzy, to a right mind, he is given back to his astonished friends, and tells how great things the Lord had done for him. The unhappy lu∣natick, sore vexed, oft times falling in the fire, and oft times in the water, is healed by the great Physician of inestimable value. The withered arm feels a renovating energy dart along its shrunken sinews, and is stretched forth strong as the other. The wretched sub∣ject of the shaking palsy, borne on his bed by four attendants, rises up in the presence of multitudes, and walks home unsupported. The born blind, who never saw the human form di∣vine, shut out from all the rich variety of na∣ture's
<PB N="27" REF="029410_0026_0FE1727084D26000"/>
works, beholds the Father's face In Jesus Christ. The dumb, whose tongue was never loosed, whose tongue if loosed by human art, im∣pediment had barred from speech, now glorifies the Lord by offering praise. The deaf, is blessed with salvation's welcome sound, the sweetest accent ever heard on earth. The impotent, for thirty-eight long years, whom no kind friend baptized in the troubled pool, is cured by the word of power. The maimed, wanting limbs, receive new members for the body, from the Head of every man. The leper dwelling in a several house abides no more alone; no longer cries unclean, unclean: His skin is fresher than a child's: His flesh is fairer than the babe's. The woman sore diseased, her living spent, her plague increased, needs but to touch the garment's hem: Virtue goes forth and makes her straightway whole. The crooked, bowed down for eighteen years, by Satan bound, is loosed on the Sabbath-day. The dropsy quits the secret reservoirs of life: Its overwhelming waters know their bounds: Thus far they come, and here, the rising wave is stayed.

victim riseth from the bed and ministers to Jesus. The stormy wind, descending tempest, and the rolling billow hear the Sovereign Man∣date, peace, be still. The sinking Peter, con∣fident in strength, is saved by his Master's out∣stretched hand. The sinner listens to the sooth∣ing voice of pardoning grace: Be of good cheer, the Saviour saith, thy sins are all forgiv∣en. A word, restores the servant sick at Ca∣pernaum. I will, and be thou clean, completes all cleansing. The hungry multitudes, at evening's solitary hour, amid the wilderness, the desert waste, are feasted at the table of the Lord: His liberal soul deviseth liberal things: Thousands and tens of thousands feed upon the bounties of their God: Men, women, children all are filled: Not even one is deemed unwor∣thy to partake. The Ruler's daughter is re∣called to life: Death renders up his prey to the Omnipotent Talitha Cumi. The weeping widow, mourning for an only son, receives him from the dead: Almighty goodness, unimplo∣red, restores him to his mother's arms. Laza∣rus, though four days buried, wakeneth at

the joyous sound, Come forth: The Spirit breathes upon the lifeless clay: He lives to wonder, worship and adore: Loose him and let him go, is the divine command. The mi∣racle of miracles remains as yet unnoticed: The most stupendous work of Jesus' ministry, hath not been told: It is the mystery from ages, and from generations hid: The everlast∣ing gospel freely preached to the poor: The blessed tidings of salvation for the chief of sinners: The gracious pardon of a reconciled God, proclaimed to a guilty world. Here resteth the hope of Israel, the consolation of the Gentiles, and the confidence of the ends of the earth. In the fellowship of the mystery of the good pleasure of Jehovah, prospering in the hand of Immanuel, is, the joy of Patriarchs, the theme of Prophets, the rejoicing of Apostles, the vic∣tory of Martyrs, and the praise of Angels.

<P>Men, Brethren and Fathers, well beloved, highly esteemed, greatly respected! Think not, I beseech you, that the sum of those things, whereof we have already spoken, containeth the perfect character of the Redeeming God. These, are only a part of his ways. Not the pen of the ready writer, not the tongue of the eloquent orator, can faithfully delineate, or fully make known, the glory that remaineth and excelleth. Come, let us arise, and go up unto Zion to the Lord our God, the great High
<PB N="31" REF="029410_0030_0FE17278E6764488"/>
Priest of our profession, the High Priest merci∣ful and faithful, who in the days of his flesh, offered up himself through the Eternal Spirit, a living sacrifice for sin, holy and acceptable. It was of necessity, saith the Apostle, that the true Melchizedek should have somewhat to offer. Sacrifice and burnt offering, as offered by the law, with thousands of rivers of oil, or tens of thousands of rams, could not make Aaron who did the service, perfect, as pertaining to the conscience. The blood of bulls, and of goats, and the sprinkling of the ashes of an heifer, nei∣ther finished sin, made an end of transgression, nor brought in everlasting righteousness. These rites, ceremonies and cleansings, purified the pat∣tern of the heavenly things: But not the hea∣venly things themselves, which required a bet∣ter sacrifice. Then, said Jesus, lo, I come, in the volume of the book, it is written of me, to do thy will, O God: The Lamb without blemish and without spot, bearing away the sin of the world, hath accomplished this will, by the which will, he hath forever perfected them that are sanctified: The iniquities of us all being caused to meet upon him, his soul was
<PB N="32" REF="029410_0031_0FE1727AD06B8978"/>
made an offering for sin; and he who knew no sin, became sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to day, and forever, with∣out variableness of turning, or shadow of change hath obtained Eternal Redemption: As the Great Shepherd and Bishop of souls he hath en∣tered into the Holiest of Holies; and seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, he ever liveth to make intercession, being the Advocate if any man sin, and the mercy seat for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for the sins of the whole world: Hence the Apostle beareth wit∣ness, that he hath reconciled all things unto himself, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven, and argueth therefrom, in well grounded assurance of hope, not making ashamed, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, they shall be gathered together in one Christ, the Head of the church, the Saviour of the body, and the Ransom given for all, who hath blotted out the bill of book debt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Harwood on Coloss.

peace on this day, the stones of the temple would have cried out, arise, and go up to Zion, unto the Lord your God. Come, my bre∣thren and my sisters, let us arise and say with the venerable Patriarch, we will go up yonder and worship. The ministry of Jesus in death, was glorious: It engraved as with the graving of a signet, on the palms of his hands, the love wherewith God so loved the world: But the ministration of the Spirit, in the power of the resurrection shall be infinitely more glorious, and that love which hath its abiding, when faith is swallowed up of vision, and hope lost in joy unspeakable, will forever surpass the height, the depth of finite understanding, and wrap even Angel hosts, and Heaven's high courts, in solemn silence.</P>
<P>Christ hath suffered all things that were writ∣ten: The scriptures are accomplished which spake of his humiliation: He is about to enter into his glory, and to see of the travail of his soul: He is loosed from the cords of death: It is impossible that he could be holden of them. The Lord is risen indeed, in the spirit and the
<PB N="35" REF="029410_0034_0FE1728201166588"/>
power of an endless life: He hath said unto death, O death, I will be thy plagues: He hath witnessed to the grave, O grave, I will be thy destruction. The Conqueror over both hath gone up with a shout: The keys of death and of hell are in his hand. Lo, Jesus ascendeth on high: Far exalted above all principality and power: Angels, authorities and the world to come being in subjection, he setteth on the throne of his holiness; and reigneth as a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and remission of sins: The nations of the saved are the diadem of his beauty; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of his kingdom: His throne is uphol∣den by mercy and truth: In the multitude of people is the honor of the king: All kings, when they hear the words of his mouth shall submit themselves. To him is the gathering and obedience of nations: He shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth: It is a light thing that he should reign over the house of Jacob forever; of the increase of his kingdom and of his peace, there shall be no end. From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, prayer shall be
<PB N="36" REF="029410_0035_0FE1728388BDB778"/>
made continually unto him; a pure offering of incense offered in every place; and men shall call him blessed, because they are blessed in him, from henceforth and forever, world with∣out end.</P>
<P>Are the Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, silent? Do they cease to cry aloud, arise ye, and go up to Zion unto the Lord your God? The Saviour born to day, Christ Jesus, the Lord, is not only the King of saints, King of nations, and King of the whole earth, he also is the Great Prophet, to whom the Spirit was not given by measure. The spirit of wis∣dom and of knowledge; of counsel and of might, resteth in all its fulness, on the Man Di∣vine. We, therefore, do err exceedingly, not knowing the scriptures, when our views of the prophetical character of Christ are bounded by those predictions, which he delivered, whilst tabernacling below. The lamp of ancient pro∣phecy was light at the altar of heaven. The Baptizer with the Holy Ghost in fire, as the Lord, the Spirit kindled the living coal. All those glorious things, that are spoken of the latter days, ought to be considered, as the faith∣ful
<PB N="37" REF="029410_0036_0FE172869F552610"/>
and the true sayings of the faithful Witness on high; and every iota should be received by us, upon whom the ends of the world are come, as if pronounced by an audible voice from above. The good word of our God shall never fall to the ground: The hills may depart, the moun∣tains remove, and all these elements dissolve: But his promise shall not return unto him void; it shall prosper whereunto it is sent, and accom∣plish all the pleasure of Jehovah. Amid an in∣finite variety of sublime passages, replete with the consolations of the Comforter, the Times of Refreshing from the presence of the Lord, and the day of the Restitution of all things claim a distinguished place. The finishing of the mystery, as declared by all God's holy Pro∣phets, is reserved for the sounding of the se∣venth trumpet, when the rainbow crowned Angel, shall proclaim, that the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdom of God and his Christ. Then, cometh the end, and the morning without a cloud, will reveal the Just, whose body the heavens must receive until that period, in all his goodness, as all his glory: Sorrow and sighing, and sickness and pain shall
<PB N="38" REF="029410_0037_0FE172888E5EC988"/>
vanish as a dream, before the lifting up of the light of his countenance: The vail that is spread over all nations, the covering that is cast over all people, shall be destroyed: And death, the last enemy, being perfectly swallowed up of victory, all tears shall be wiped away, from off all faces, for the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it. Indulge me to close this faint description, of the exceeding abun∣dance of the riches of grace, as yet to be shew∣ed in the ages to come, by adopting the beau∣tiful language of the devout Cowper, whose harp of sacred poesy, is never hung upon the willows, when he sings the song of Moses and the Lamb.</P>

<P>Men, Brethren, Fathers and Sisters! The Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, beseech, that ye arise and go up to Zion unto the Lord your God, for he hath given you an Example that ye should walk in his footsteps: He hath set before you a pattern, that ye should do in all things unto others, as he hath done unto you. Art thou a father, a husband or a son, a mas∣ter, servant, ruler or subject? Remember, I in∣treat thee, that a frequent recurrence to the example of thy Lord, a constant imitation of his most holy pattern, is the best preservative from error, the surest safe-guard from vice, and keep∣eth in safety from the great transgression, when the pulses beat quick, the passions sound an a∣larm, and temptations press; whilst ambition flatters, mammon spreads the gilded bait, and pleasure points her serpent-sting.</P>
<P>Ye Watchmen, on the watch towers of Beth∣lehem Ephratah, what remaineth to be added?
<PB N="40" REF="029410_0039_0FE1728C01235608"/>
See, that ye refuse not him who speaketh from heaven, is their united answer. A voice from the Most Excellent Glory hath declared, this is my beloved Son, hear him. Christ Jesus hath graciously summed up the Law and the Prophets in four comprehensive words, love God, love Man: These two commandments are not griev∣ous: They connect duty with interest, and in∣terest with happiness. To love our Creator, Preserver, Redeemer and Saviour, is the re∣quirement of a reasonable service. To love our brethren, is inscribed upon the tablet of every heart, as with the pen of a diamond: But the christian ought not to bound his af∣fections in the house of his friends. Our ene∣mies are to be loved with all fervor of charity. The love of Christ constraineth us thus to judge; and his precept hath enjoined it as a duty, which is founded on his own example. Give ye therefore all diligence to add unto your faith, virtue, and to virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance, and to temperance, godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, love, even the love of friends and of enemies, which is the fulfilling of the Royal Law, and the bond of perfectness in heaven above and in earth beneath.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="029410_0040_0FE172902A296D30"/>It is time, that we attempt to improve the subject before us, by a few pertinent reflexions, adapted to mutual edification.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Apostle, writing unto the Hebrews, having set forth the dignity of the Just God and the Saviour, hath exhorted, that we give the more earnest heed unto the things which we have heard, lest at any time we let them slip. The neglecting of so great salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord in Paradise, and hath been confirmed unto us, by the united testimony of Patriarchs, Pro∣phets, and Evangelists, with the trump of the Archangel, and the voice of the whole Host of Heaven, will assuredly meet with a due recom∣pence of reward, for if he, who despised Moses' law was put to death, by the mouth of two or three witnesses, of how much sorer punishment, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, crucified him afresh, and put him to an open shame. The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmities, but a wounded spirit who can bear? Believe ye, therefore, in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established;
<PB N="42" REF="029410_0041_0FE17291B2AC7150"/>
believe in his Prophets, so shall ye prosper. Without faith it is impossible to please God. The fellow pilgrims, and sojourners in this vale of tears, who were gathered unto their fathers, before Christ came in the flesh, went on their way, rejoicing in the hope that was set before them, beholding the fulfilment of the promises afar off, and being persuaded that He who had promised was also faithful to perform, their faith was accounted unto them for righteous∣ness. God hath graciously provided some better thing for us. We have heard with our ears, we have seen with our eyes, we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life. Those, upon whom the ends of the world, are come, must be, of all men most in∣excusable, if they close their eyes against the clear shining of the true light, turn a deaf ear to the Charmer ever charming wisely, and op∣pose a heart of adamant against the Lord Christ. Let us, therefore, earnestly pray, that we may be delivered from the sin of unbelief, which doth so easily beset, and run with pa∣tience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author, and the finisher of faith,
<PB N="43" REF="029410_0042_0FE16F0623FFE588"/>
and thus cast anchor within the vail, whither the Forerunner hath for us entered.</P>
<P N="2">II. At all times and in all places, it would be our wisdom, to remember the years of the right hand of the Most High; his wonderful works from the days of old: The heavens which declare his glory, and the firmament shewing forth his handy work, are witnesses on behalf of the Almighty, in every land, and their silent language is worthy of being heard among all nations; for, the invisible things of God are hereby clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God Head: But nei∣ther Creation, in all its multiplied wonders, nor Providence, which is arrayed in greater glo∣ries than Creation, so fully reveal the nature of the Divine Being, or so clearly demonstrate his attributes, as the eternal purpose of grace in Christ Jesus from before the world began: On this, the noblest work of God, the corner stone of time was laid; and the top stone brought forth in eternity with shouting, shall cry grace, grace unto it. In truth, this first,
<PB N="44" REF="029410_0043_0FE17295F0CAB518"/>
last, finished work, hath a claim to our constant remembrance. It deserveth to be had in me∣morial, when we lie down, what time we arise, whether we wake, or sleep, or live, or die: For, for this cause, Christ Jesus both died and rose, and revived again, that henceforth we should not live unto ourselves, but live unto him, who so loved us, that he gave himself for our sins, that we might be delivered from this present evil world, and translated from the kingdom of darkness, to an inheritance incor∣ruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not away.</P>
<P N="3">III. Christ Jesus, our Lord, is not only worthy of being had in reverence, because of his wonderful works in Creation, Provi∣dence, Redemption and Salvation: But the beauty of his all perfect example ought to be devoutly contemplated at evening, at morning and at noon. As the Father Everlasting, who of one blood hath made all nations, who dwell together upon the face of the whole earth, how richly hath he provided for the food, the habi∣tation and the cloathing of his offspring! In the character of a Son, what strength of filial
<PB N="45" REF="029410_0044_0FE17297F6FACC70"/>
affection, gratitude, obedience and love! The blessed among women, was tenderly thought of in the last moments of life: His address on her behalf, to the beloved Disciple, when treading the winepress alone, and tasting the bitterness of death, is so exquisitely affecting, that even to read it without tears, would argue the ex∣tremest insensibility. In brief, amid all the en∣dearing, the much loved relations of life, as a Parent, a Brother, a Friend, Jesus standeth greatly preheminent; and the word of the Sa∣viour, energetically heard in his example, is, Go thou and do likewise.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The new commandment whereunto we are delivered, ought to be adopted as the rule of life. All its ways are pleasantness. The path of obedience is peace. Permit me, therefore, to conclude in the language of an eminent, and a faithful servant of the Lamb. Finally, Men, Brethren and Fathers, with all the christian charities most affectionately belo∣ved, whatsover things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, or, if there be any other
<PB N="46" REF="029410_0045_0FE17299E1FEF8F0"/>
virtue, or, ought else deserving praise, as learn∣ed and received from the Lord Jesus, or as prac∣tised by the Apostles and Primitive Churches, think ye continually on these things; and let your consequent good works, the evidence of faith in Christ, as the adorning of the doctrine of the Saviour God, furnish an answer unto every man, of the reason of the hope that is within you. It is yet a very little while, and the Watchmen of Mount Ephraim shall cry, arise ye from earth and ascend to heaven. At this all important, heart affecting, soul inter∣esting moment, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fel∣lowship of the Spirit, enable us to answer, we come unto Thee; for thou art the Lord our God, the God of Salvation, our guide unto death and beyond it, forever and for ever, Amen and Amen.</P>
