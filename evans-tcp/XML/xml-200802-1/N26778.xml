<P>THE LIFE OF MRS. SARAH OSBORN.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I. Containing an Account of the first thirty years of her Life, written by herself; with a brief In∣troduction.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. SARAH OSBORN, was born in London, on February 22, 1714. Her father was Mr. Benjamin Haggar. Her mother was Mrs. Susanna Haggar, whose maiden name was Guyse. She was sister to the Reverend Doctor John Guyse of London. Mrs. Osborn came to America, with her mother, in the year 1722, in the ninth year of her age, her father having been here for some time before. They lived in Boston a short time, and then moved to Freetown, on the east side of Taunton river, near fifty miles south of Boston, and above twenty miles from Newport. In the year 1729, they moved to Newport on Rhodeisland, where she lived till her decease.</P>
<P>The following is a more particular account of the first thirty years of her life, written by herself.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="035636_0004_100613DDDFEE1E38"/>HAVING been for some years strongly in∣clined to write something of what I can re∣member of the dealings of God with my soul from a child, I now, being about thirty years old, attempt to do it; hoping it may consist with the glory of God, at which I trust, through grace, I sincerely aim: And the good of my own soul, as a mean to stir up gratitude in the most ungrate∣ful of all hearts, even mine, to a glorious and compassionate Savior, for all his benefits towards so vile a monster in sin as I am: And for the encouragement of any who may providentially light on these lines after my decease, to trust in the Lord, and never despair of mercy, since one so stubborn and rebellious as I have been, has obtained it, through the sovereign riches of free grace. But Oh, let all tremble at the thought of abusing a Savior so, lest God should say, "Let them alone, they shall never enter into my rest."</P>
<P>Lord, humble me for my base ingratitude; and help me, by affording me the influences and assistance of thy blessed Spirit, that I may be im∣partial in this work, declaring the truth, and nothing but the truth; and in all that, have a single eye to thy glory. O, for Jesus' sake, suffer me not to do any thing that will tend to puff up self. O, remove all spiritual pride, and keep me low at the feet of Jesus. Fill me with adoring and admiring thoughts of thee, O God the Fa∣ther, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, who has so wonderfully contrived and wrought out my redemption; and though thou hast, through infinite wisdom, hid these things from the wise and prudent, yet hast revealed them unto babes; and even to me, the most ignorant and
<PB N="7" REF="035636_0004_100613DDDFEE1E38"/>
vile of all creatures: Whose deep rooted enmity against thee and thy laws broke out into action, as soon as I was capable of any. The first that I can remember of actual sins, of which I was guilty, was <HI>telling a lie.</HI> And then that text of scripture often rang in my ears, "All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."</P>
<P>I was frequently under the strivings of the Spirit of God, pressing me to forsake sin, and re∣pent and perform duties: But sometimes found them very burden some to me; such as praying and saying many good things, which I was fre∣quently taught. Blessed be God for such instruc∣tions. Sometimes I loved them, and was much affected with them: But my corruptions prevail∣ed dreadfully, an angry temper stiring in me; especially when corrected by my mother. But I acknowledge, to the glory of God, that he pre∣served such a tenderness of conscience in me, that if at any time my mother convinced me that she did it because it was her duty, and for my sin against God, I could bear it patiently, and willingly, yea thankfully.</P>
<P>Thus I continued till I was about seven or eight years old; when, my father being in New England, my mother put me to a boarding school, about three miles from London, where every thing was delightful to me. I was con∣stantly taught things that were religious, and they all became sweet to me, so that I verily thought I lived a heaven upon earth. O, how sweet were Sabbaths! And for secret praye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have omitted it for all the world; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> omitting it appeared so monstrous, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="035636_0005_100613DF66EA8258"/>
dreadful thing, that I dare not lie down without it: In this I was doubtless governed by a legal spirit. I was frequently much enlarged in that duty, and used to weep much when confessing my sins, and pleading for the pardon of them, and for an interest in Christ. The name of Christ was sweet to me, and sin appeared more hateful. I often used to reprove others, when guilty of it. But once in particular, I remember, when I was at Hartford, where my grandmother lived, and my brother with her, a little time before we came to New England, my brother did something which I thought was wicked, and I reproved him sharply for it; but was much perplexed, after I had done it, with these words of scripture, "Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye." This frighted me exceedingly. I thought I was a vile hypocrite, and should never dare to reprove any body again. And, I suppose, a hypocrite I was. But at last I told my grandmother of it, who encouraged me to go on, telling me i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was my duty so to do; and if I was faithful, God would bless me, and love me.</P>
<P>So I continued for a while, as I thought, to delight in the ways of holiness. But alas! alas! how soon was it over! My goodness was like the morning cloud and the early dew, which soon passeth away; for when I was in my ninth year my father sent for my mother and me to come to New England to him. And on board the ship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost my good impressions, and grew vile, so that I could then play upon the Sabbath. But was convinced of that sin by an accident which
<PB N="9" REF="035636_0005_100613DF66EA8258"/>
befel me; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was ordered by infinite wisdom for that end. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as I was busy in boil∣ing something for my amusement, I fell into the fire with my right hand, and burnt it all over; which I presently thought came justly upon me for playing on the Sabbath day: And I was ashamed and sorry I had done so.</P>
<P>But after this I do not remember any partic∣ular conviction for some years; but was change∣able and inconstant, sometimes quite careless, and then more diligent in the performance of prayer. I had always, as I thought, a great love for those who I believed were good people, es∣pecially ministers. My very heart would leap with joy, when I could see, or come near enough to touch them. I mention this as a childish no∣tion, that I took such pleasure in touching them. I used to go secretly behind them for that pur∣pose. I thought I could do any thing in my power to serve them.</P>
<P>About two years and an half after we came to Boston, my parents moved to Freetown, and I with them. And when I was about thirteen years old, my mother went from thence to New∣port on Rhodeisland, and went to visit Mr. Clap, who gave her a little book of spiritual songs for me, and desired her to give it to me, and tell me that it came from one who was a hearty well wisher to my soul. These words immediately seized me, and filled me with shame to think that one whom I never knew should take such care of my precious soul, while I was so careless myself. And from that minute I thought I had a grateful love for Mr. Clap <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="035636_0006_100613E1CE89B1E8"/>
longed to sit under his ministry. I was then for some time under strong convictions. Had such a sense of the hardness of my heart, that I often thought it was impossible for me to be suf∣ficiently awakened by any ordinary means; and prayed that God would do any thing with me, though ever so terrible, so that I might be driv∣en from my evil courses, and turned to God. Some change I thought must be wrought in me, or I should never get to heaven; but after what manner, I knew not. However, I resolved to persist in the way of duty, as I called it, and to forsake my sins, and lead a new life. But, fool that I was, I made resolutions in my own strength, and built upon my own works; and so soon fell again. O, amazing grace, that God should spare such a wretch as me, such an a∣buser of mercy!</P>
<P>After this I found myself dead, and to have no heart, as I thought, to pray, nor any sweet∣ness in it, when I did. Then, O how I longed for the return of the spirit of God, imagining he was withdrawn from me. Sometimes I did ago∣nize in prayer, and plead with God that he would return to me by his Spirit once more. But was often answered by these words, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man." Then I would beg, and promise that if God would try me <HI>this once,</HI> I would never grieve or resist his Spirit a∣gain. O, wretch that I was! thus to lie to the glorious God, who was then striving with me, to bring me to his Son; for I did, <HI>I did</HI> quench his motions, and soon forgot my promises. O, deceitful and dreadfully wicked heart! who can
<PB N="11" REF="035636_0006_100613E1CE89B1E8"/>
know it? Lord, I am amazed at thy patience that I am out of hell.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, contrary to my parents' commands, I got into a canoe to paddle about in the river,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their house stood by Taunton river, which was navigable.</NOTE> and could not get on shore again. It being in the night, though the moon shined bright, I expected no other but to be drowned. Once I thought to get out, and pull the canoe to the shore; but tried first if I could reach the bottom with my paddle: And finding I could not, durst not venture. Then I could see no probability of escaping death. So I kneeled down and prayed, and all my former convictions revived: And the sin of disobedience to my pa∣rents especially appeared odious. I thought it was just that God should bring me into this distress for this sin; and with great vehemence and self abhorrence confessed my sins, with their aggra∣vations before God, pleading for an interest in the blood of Christ, and for pardon for his sake, for that, and all my other sins. And while I was praying, I felt a secret joy, verily believing that I was forgiven, and that Christ had loved me with an everlasting love, and that I should be happy with him, and longed for the time. I was im∣mediately resigned, as I thought, to the will of God, quite willing to die, and willing to live; begging that God would dispose of me as most consisted with his glory. And after I had thus re∣signed myself, as I thought, soul and body into the hands of God, to do with me as seemed good to him, I was as calm and serene in the temper of my mind, as ever in my life.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035636_0007_100613E355E09600"/>But at length I bethought myself, that self preservation was a great duty, and therefore I ought to try to get on shore. So I hollowed as loud as I could to the neighbors, who with much difficulty were made to hear, and came to me, some hours after. There was not another canoe within two or three miles; for I had been driven by the tide some miles, first up and then down the river.</P>
<P>How it would have been with my soul, if God had taken me out of the world at that time, he only knows. Some christians have thought, a saving change was then wrought, and that I should have been happy.</P>
<P>After this, I was more diligent in pursuing, as I thought, the ways of holiness in the way God had appointed; and more watchful against sin. My life was pleasant and sweet. I had great en∣largements in duties. But at length grew cold again. O ungrateful soul! to forget such a re∣markable deliverance from death.</P>
<P>The next winter I was as wonderfully pre∣served. The weather being exceeding cold, the river was frozen, so that people, horses and teams went over on the ice. But while it was hard and slippery, I durst not venture on it, for fear of falling. But after a great thaw, so that the ice looked quite black, I, contrary to my parents' orders again, they being from home, went quite over to the other side, which was a mile. But the tide was rising, so I could not get on shore: And when I looked round me, I could see nothing but great holes, as large as hous∣es, or larger, some of them. There was no way for me, but to go straight back again;
<PB N="13" REF="035636_0007_100613E355E09600"/>
which I did. But the water was almost over shoes all the way; and the ice, it seemed to me, bent every step I took. And when I got back, the water was so risen, that I was much beset to get on shore: And it was in the dusk of the evening. But at last, with much diffi∣culty, I found a strip of ice, as narrow as a bridge, which reached the shore, by which I got to land. But when I had got off, and saw the imminent danger to which I had exposed myself, by my folly and presumption, it made me tremble exceedingly. I presently thought again, how just God would have been, if I had been drowned for my disobedience to my pa∣rents; and wondered at his patience in sparing me: But do not remember, that I felt any a∣biding impressions; so great was my woful stu∣pidity: Though I think I kept on praying, &amp;c. As to the river, the wind rose presently, and blew very hard from the south, so that it, with the tide, broke it up, that before bed time there was not a piece of ice of any bigness within sight of our house, which stood close by the river. I am amazed, when I consider how wonderful∣ly God preserved me, a poor finful worm, so unworthy of the least mercy.</P>
<P>The next March, we removed to Dighton,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A town on the other side of Taunton river▪</NOTE> where we lived one year. I remember but one awakening in that time; and that was by hearing of the death of one of my former asso∣ciates in Freetown, a young girl, about my age.</P>
<P>Then I was again astonished at the patience of God, in sparing me alive and out of hell.
<PB N="14" REF="035636_0008_100613E4E01B8B20"/>
Then I renewed my resolutions to lead a new life. But instead of that, in the spring we moved to Rhodeisland, where I soon got into company, and was full of vanity. But my con∣science would not let me be easy.</P>
<P>After some sore trials and temptations, I was more comfortable, and had a great desire, I thought, to forsake <HI>all sin,</HI> and to comply with every commanded duty. I longed to join to the church; but thought I was unworthy. I thought I thirsted for communion with God in the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, and used to think, if I came to <HI>that,</HI> it would certainly be a restraint upon me, so that I should not dare to sin as others did. And when I stayed to see the ordinance administered, I used to think I could give all this world, I were fit to attend it. My spirit would even sink within me for the longings I had. Some times I should weep so that I could not conceal it. One Sabbath, I went to hear Mr. Clap preach at his own house, where I inclined to go constantly; but my pa∣rents went to the other meeting, and were not pleased I should go from them: So I went but seldom. But at this time there was a girl of a∣bout fourteen years old baptised, which so af∣fected me that I could hardly refrain from cry∣ing out in the meeting, when I thought how I had broken the covenant engagements, which my parents had made with God, in my behalf, in my infancy, and so long abused so great a privilege, as being a child of the covenant: And she, who had not had so much done for her, should now come to desire it herself! I
<PB N="15" REF="035636_0008_100613E4E01B8B20"/>
saw, as I thought, such a beauty in her, that I loved her entirely, and wished to be as good as I thought she was. I made new resolutions to live answerable to the mercies I had received: But being made in my own strength I soon fell again. I thought I trusted in God; and used frequently, in times of trial, to go and pour out my complaints to him, thinking he was my only support. But I dare not now be positive, or really conclude, that I knew what it was to put my trust in God; for my conduct after this seems so inconsistent with grace, that I dare not say I had one spark of it then; but rather think I was only under a common work of the Spirit: Though some times I think I had true grace, though very weak. God only know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how it was. O that he would enable me now to give diligence to make my calling and election sure, that I may not be deceived in a matter of so great importance. But to go on. After this (O that with deep humility of soul, with sorrow and shame, I could speak of it) I relapsed again, and was full of vanity. I kept company with a young man, something against my parents will. But that was owing to false reports raised of him; for at first they liked him. I made resolutions, that, after I was married, I would lead a new life, flattering myself that then I should not have the hinderances which I now had. I used bitterly to reflect upon myself, when I had given myself liberty to be merry; for though I ap∣peared outwardly so, I had no real pleasure: But still put off repentance, or an entire breaking off from vanity, till a more convenient season; and
<PB N="16" REF="035636_0009_100613E66C43F860"/>
so resisted the Spirit of God. O Lord, how just hadst thou been, if thou hadst left me entirely to myself! And if thou hadst, nothing would have been too bad for such a vile wretch as I to have committed. But blessed be God, who withheld me from such sins as would have brought me to open justice, and exposed my∣self and family to shame and disgrace.</P>
<P>In process of time, I was married to Mr. Sam∣uel Wheaten, being in my eighteenth year, Oc∣tober 21, 1731, and went with my husband, the next winter, to see his friends in the country; where I stayed almost five months; and was almost all the time under strong convictions. Oh, how I did sweat and tremble for fear my convictions should wear off again, and plead with God to set home strong convictions, and never, <HI>never</HI> suffer them to cease, till they end∣ed in a sound and saving conversion; till I knew and was sure that I had a saving interest in Jesus Christ, and was freely forgiven for his sake! And this was the substance of my frequent prayers ever after, when I could pray at all with earnestness; that I might never rest more, till I was sure my peace was made with God.</P>
<P>From this time I had a hope again, at times, that Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was mine. But it was some years af∣ter before it pleased God to answer it fully, by giving me an assurance of it. But then I longed again for the ordinance of the Lord's supper, though some times shocked by that awful text, "He who eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself." But
<PB N="17" REF="035636_0009_100613E66C43F860"/>
resolved at last, if I lived to get home, I would venture, <HI>in obedience to the commandment of Christ</HI>; and throw myself into the arms of mer∣cy. I longed to commemorate the death and sufferings of a crucified Jesus. I thought noth∣ing should tempt me to delay any longer. But, oh my sinful soul, must I yet add to the number of thy backslidings! Could not the time past suffice, that thou hadst provoked a compassion∣ate God! Was it not enough, and more than enough, that thou hadst rebelled so long against a glorious Christ, and grieved his blessed Spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But must I go on again, after such awakenings as these, which one would have thought impossi∣ble! But, oh deceitful heart, thou didst, <HI>thou didst!</HI> Lord, I blush and am ashamed, when I remem∣ber my notorious ingratitude. O break this heart of flint, dearest Lord, that it may melt in∣to tears of contrition: And never suffer me to forgive myself, because thou hast forgiven me.</P>
<P>After I came home, I met with much afflic∣tion in many respects. It seemed to me that the whole world were in arms against me. I thought I was the most despised creature living upon earth. I used to pray to God in secret to relieve me; but did not, as I ought, see his hand in permitting it so to be, as a just pun∣ishment for my vile sins: And therefore was not humbled under it as I ought; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et na∣ture rise, and acted very imprudently, in many respects. I was then with child, and often la∣mented that I was like to bring a child into such a world of sorrow: But some times found a disposition to dedicate my babe to God, while in
<PB N="18" REF="035636_0010_100613E92902B7E0"/>
the womb; and did so, at all seasons of secret prayer. And, after it was born, my husband being at sea, I could not rest till I had solemn∣ly given it up to God in baptism. And I thought that I did indeed give up both myself and it to God.</P>
<P>I met with many trials in my lying in, it be∣ing an extreme cold season. My child was born on Oct. 27, 1732. The next spring, my husband returned home; but went to sea again, and died abroad in November, 1733. I was then in my twentieth year. The news of my husband's death came to me on the first of the next April. And I was prepared the evening before to receive it, by being uncommonly ex∣ercised in my mind about spiritual things: And that text in Hebrews was continually in my thoughts, "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?" This put me upon plead∣ing with God, that I might not be found among the neglecters of it. I went to bed in a house all alone, my child being at my father's. And about eleven or twelve o'clock at night was a∣waked to hear the heavy tidings. But God ap∣peared wonderfully for my support. I saw his hand, and was enabled to submit with patience to his will. I daily looked round me, to see how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch heavier the hand of God was laid on some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, than it was on me, where they were left with a large number of children, and much involved in debt. And I had but one to main∣tain; and, though poor, yet not involved. Oth∣ers, I saw, as well as myself, had their friends snatched from them by sudden accidents. The
<PB N="19" REF="035636_0010_100613E92902B7E0"/>
consideration of these things, together with this thoughts of what I deserved, stilled me so, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> though the loss of my companion, whom I dear∣ly loved, was great; yet the veins of mercy, which I saw running through all my a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictions, were so great likewise, that, with Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I could say, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath tak∣en away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." I had then the promises of the widow's God to plead, and seemed to cast myself more immedi∣ately upon his care, verily believing, as I thought, he would provide for me, with my fatherless babe; for whom I often pleaded for covenant blessings, since he had been cast upon God from the womb.</P>
<P>O, how much comfort do those parents lose, who never gave their children up to God in baptism in their infancy! And how sad for chil∣dren themselves to be deprived of the privilege of pleading with God for covenant blessings! My being dedicated to God in my infancy al∣ways put an argument into my mouth, to beg of God that I might not cut myself off, since I was a child of the covenant, and from a child given to him in baptism. But, to return:</P>
<P>As before this affliction every one seemed to be enemies to me, so from that time, all became friends. My parents treated me very ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and God inclined every one who saw m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kind to me. My brother was come into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England: And being a single man, we went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o housekeeping together. But in three months after he married, and I soon found it would not do to live as before; and began to be thought∣ful
<PB N="20" REF="035636_0011_100613EBC879F3D0"/>
how I should do. I could see no way in which I could get a living. All doors seemed to be shut. But I verily believed that God would point out a way for me. And accord∣ingly, the very day I came to a resolution to move as soon as I could, a stranger to my case, who kept a school a little way off, came to me, and told me that she only waited for a fair wind to go to Carolina; and, if it would suit me, I should have her chamber and schollars; which I joyfully accepted. Thus the widow's God remarkably provided for me. This was on Nov. 19, 1734. I was then placed in a family, who discovered a great deal of affection for me; and in all respects used me as tenderly as if I had been a near relation.</P>
<P>It pleased God the next May to lay his af∣flicting hand on me, by a sharp humour, which broke out in my hands, so that, for three months, every finger I had was wrapped up in plasters; and I could help myself but very lit∣tle, and was under the doctor's hands. In the fall I was taken with violent fits, and was quite deprived of sense by them five days. I was blistered almost all over by the doctor; and my hands and arms were all raw, from my fin∣gers' ends, up above my elbows, attended with a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fever. But all my friends were exceed∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to me, and those in the house took care of me, and of my children too; so that my school was not broken up, till I was able to take care of it myself again. But the sharp humour continued very violent, at times, for some years: And still continues at some sea∣sons.
<PB N="21" REF="035636_0011_100613EBC879F3D0"/>
But, in all this time of illness, God won∣derfully provided for me. I wanted for none of the comforts of life: Neither was I cast down; for his mercy held me up.</P>
<P>The instances of the remarkable hand of God in his providence, in ordering my temporal af∣fairs, are innumerable. But, oh vile wretch! after all this I grew flack again, and got into a cold, lifeless frame. As I grew better in bodily health, my soul grew sick. I daily laid up a stock for repentance. But, through rich grace, I was again convinced of my stupidity, and be∣gan to be more diligent in attending on the means of grace. But I found I could not prof∣it by the word preached: Nothing reached my heart; all seemed but skin deep: And the more I went to meeting, the more I found it so. Then I began to think I must take some other course.</P>
<P>Not long after I went to hear Mr. Clap; who told me the very secrets of my heart in his ser∣mon, as plain as I could have told them to him, and indeed more so. His sermon was very ter∣rible to me. My sins, from my cradle, were ranked in order before my eyes, and they ap∣peared dreadful. I saw the depravity of my na∣ture; and how I was exposed to the infinite justice of an angry God. All my former convi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions were brought to my remembrance. I saw how I had stifled the motions of the blessed Spirit of God, and resisted all the kind invita∣tions of a compassionate Saviour. I was heart sick of all my works. And as it had been of∣ten suggested to me, I believe from Satan, that it
<PB N="22" REF="035636_0012_100613EED629A520"/>
was time enough for me to repent hereafter, it was now strongly impressed on my mind, that it was <HI>now</HI> too late for me to find mercy. Once I might have had a Christ; but now my day was past. And it was suggested that I had com∣mitted the unpardonable sin; because I had sinned against light and knowledge, even against the convictions of my own conscience. This I knew I had done; and therefore believed I had committed that sin which could never be forgiven.</P>
<P>In this distress, I went to my Bible; but could find nothing but terror there. My whole attention was turned to such passages as the fol∣lowing. "After thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up wrath to thyself against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will reader to every man according to his deeds. All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. Depart from me, ye cursed, in∣to everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. Consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. He that being often reproved, harden∣eth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. Ye have set at nought my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings!" All these, and many more such terrible passages of scripture, I found, whenever I opened the Bible. My eyes were open to nothing else, and not one
<PB N="23" REF="035636_0012_100613EED629A520"/>
word of comfort could I find. And if I thought of complying with any commanded duty, I seemed to be frowned away by these words, What hast thou to do to take my covenant into thy mouth? Oh, the distress and anguish of soul I then felt, neither my tongue nor pen can ex∣press, when I was brought to believe there was no mercy for such a monster in sin as I was, and expected every moment that hell would open its mouth and swallow me up, amazed that God had kept me out so long!</P>
<P>When Satan, and my wicked heart, had pre∣vailed so far as to make me despair of the mercy of God, and verily to believe hell would be my portion, I was tempted to try to get the easiest room there; and, to that end, to keep myself as ignorant as I could; it being suggested to my mind, that the servant who knew not his Lord's will would be beaten with few stripes; while he who knew it, and did it not, would be beaten with many stripes: And as my time was over for doing his will, I had better leave off reading, praying or hearing the word preached any more; for I should fare better, if I did. And oh, vile wretch as I was, I yielded in some measure to the subtil adversary of my soul and salvation. O, astonishing grace, that God did not strike me down into hell the very moment I thought to do so! God had been just if he had done so, though I must have weltered under the scald∣ing drops of his wrath forever and ever.</P>
<P>But, O! what shall I say, or how, with grat∣itude enough, express the wonderful goodness of that God, who preserved me, even when I
<PB N="24" REF="035636_0013_100613F146713B20"/>
was, in my own apprehension, upon the very brink of hell, weltering in my blood; when no eye pitied me, and no created arm could save me: Even then did he spread his skirt over me, and said to me, Live. After I had been near a week in this distress, my very soul racked with fear of what I must undergo to all eternity, those words, "<HI>Depart from me,</HI>" sounding in my ears, and I uttering the language of hell, "There is no hope! There is no help! The door of mercy is shut against me forever!" all at once, I was alarmed with these thoughts, which seemed to be conveyed to my mind in the following words. "Who has told you, that your day of grace is over? Are not the doors of the meeting house open? Cannot you hear the offers of salvation? Have you not your Bible to read? And you may pray: Therefore, you see your external day of grace is not over. And how do you know but you may yet obtain mercy? It is the devil who has suggested all this to you; and he is a liar from the beginning." I was then con∣vinced, that it was the devil who had been tempting me to despair of the mercy of God, which I did not perceive before, but verily thought what he suggested to me was true, viz. That there was no hope for me.</P>
<P>During the time of this distress, which was from Saturday night to the next Saturday night, I slept no more than just to keep me alive. And when I did sleep, it was filled with terrors. It was the same with my necessary food; I thought my∣self so unworthy of the least mercy, that I know not how to eat. I found that expression of
<PB N="25" REF="035636_0013_100613F146713B20"/>
Solomon to be true, "The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?" For sure I am that no affliction or pain of body whatever, is to be compared with what I then underwent. Oh how terrible must it be for those poor souls who are on a death bed, to have such hard work to do! I have often thought if I had not been in bodily health, I could not have lived through it. But, blessed be God, it was when I was as well in body, as I have been for many years; which has been a comfort to me on all accounts; and particular∣ly because sick bed repentance too frequently wears off. But to proceed:</P>
<P>After I saw that I was tempted by Satan to des∣pair, and knowing that he was a liar, I began, for a few minutes, to have some glimmering of hope that it might possibly be, that Christ would receive me, because he had spared me hitherto, on this side the grave, and out of hell. Who knows, thought I, but I may yet be a child of God. Immediately upon these thoughts, I was furi∣ously assaulted with new temptations by Satan, I believe, not to flatter myself with the thought that I should be a child of God; for I was not elected, and therefore could not be saved. Be∣sides, God did not leave his children to be tempted by him, as I had been. I might be sure, if I was one of God's chosen, he would not have suffered me to be tempted so; but I belonged to Satan, and he was sure of me. And I, like a fool, yielded to these suggestions, and at once cast off my hope again, verily believing it was impossible that I could ever be a child of
<PB N="26" REF="035636_0014_100613F301A007E8"/>
God. Now I was brought to the greatest e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tremity, and plunged into as deep an agony as ever. I saw myself utterly lost without a Christ. I thought I could have suffered all the torments in the world for an interest in Christ. If I could have purchased him by doing any thing, though ever so hard, I should then have thought it nothing. But oh, base, proud, unbelieving heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I could not take him freely, upon his own terms; because, though I had no doubt that he was able to save me; yet I could not see him wil∣ling to receive so vile a wretch. In this dread∣ful agony, I opened my Bible, and the first words I cast my eye upon were these: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. x.13. "There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man: But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will, with the tempt∣ation, also make a way for your escape, that ye may be able to bear it." These words were accompanied with those powerful influences of the spirit of God, which excited in me a sense of the excellence, glory and truth of God, and I had a pleasing confidence and rest in the divine faithful∣ness, and embraced the promises in these words. As it is not possible for me to express the great∣ness of the distress, in which I was before; so it is as much impossible for me to make any one sensible of the joy, with which I was instantly filled by this gracious promise; except those who experimentally know what it is; for God was pleased, at that moment, to give me faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o lay hold on it. O, how did it fill my heart and mouth with praises, and my eyes with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oods of
<PB N="27" REF="035636_0014_100613F301A007E8"/>
tears! I was humbled to the dust, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as I paraphrased upon every branch of the text. It surprised, and comforted me too, to find that there had no temptation taken me, but such as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> common to man, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but a few minutes before I had been thinking that none had ever been tempted as I was. But as I perused the other part, viz. That God was faithful, and would not suffer me to be tempted abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble; but would, with the temptation, make a way for me to escape, that I might be able to bear it; my transpor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: of joy was so great, that it was more than my poor feeble frame was able to sustain; for my nature even fainted with excessive joy. Then I saw Christ not only able, but willing to receive me; and could freely trust my soul in his hands.</P>
<P>O, how was that scripture verified, which says, "By grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." Sure I am, I can never boast; for it was as much impossible for me of myself to believe, as it was to create a new world, owing to the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣inal blindness and obstinacy of my heart, which could not be subdued by any thing short of in∣finite power. Neither could any power, less than that which raised Jesus from the dead, cause me to venture upon Christ, and accept him up∣on his own terms.</P>
<P>Now my Bible appeared quite different from what it did but just before. I could find cor∣dials in great numbers of texts of scripture; and all, as well as that just mentioned, looked to me as if I had never read them before. I think I
<PB N="28" REF="035636_0015_100613F4B7B19D38"/>
did not sleep any that night; but continued praising God. The next day I went to meet∣ing: And, it being sacrament day, I stayed to see the ordinance administered. But O, what a condition I was in, when I viewed the dear children of God sitting with the Redeemer at his table! By faith I saw a crucified Savior pouring out his precious blood to redeem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s people <HI>from their sins.</HI> And believing that I, through grace, was one of them, O, how did my heart melt, and my eyes slow with tears, when I thought I saw my dearest Lord in his bitter agony in the garden: And then crowned with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣setted and beaten; and at last nailed to an accu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣ed tree: And all to free me from the torments I had so lately dreaded! It caused me bitterly to reflect upon myself, and cry out, "My sins, my sins, O Lord, have been the procuring cause of thy bitter sufferings!" Oh, how odious did my sins appear then! And especially the mon∣strous sins of ingratitude and unbelief, which I had been guilty of, in abusing so long the kind invitations of a bleeding, expiring Jesus. Oh! when I considered how often and how long he had stood knocking; but could have no en∣trance into my hardened heart, I was astonished at myself, that I could possibly be so cruel; and astonished at free grace and redeeming love, that I was spared to see that happy day. O then I begged that the everlasting doors of my soul might be lifted up, that the King of glory might enter in and take full possession. O, how glad∣ly did I embrace a Saviour upon his own terms, as my Prophet, Priest and King! He appeared

lovely, the chief among ten thousands, and was∣ten thousand times welcome to me. And I was enabled, through grace to own the cove∣nant, and give up myself in an everlasting cove∣nant, never to be forgotten, resolving, God's grace assisting me, to comply with every com∣mand of my dear Saviour. And these words loudly sounding in my ears, "<HI>This do in re∣membrance of me,</HI>" adoring my dear Redeemer for his infinite goodness in appointing such a glorious ordinance for the nourishment of his dear children, in which they might have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mate communion with him, I promised, God enabling to keep it, that I never would omit that duty. (And I never did.)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The critical reader will probably observe a defect in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is relation, and that it is expressed in language, which appears too sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mrs. Osborn was sensible of this defect when she reviewed it, and wrote in the margin a note to the following purpose.

<P>Thus, through rich unlimited grace, was I brought to lay down my arms of rebellion, which I saw I had held as long as I could.

<P>The next day I went to see Mr. Clap, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an intent to acquaint him with my desire to join the church, these words, <HI>This do in remem∣brance of me,</HI> still sounding in my ears. But I appeared so vile in my own eyes, that I knew not how to ask the privilege of him. But when I came, after some usual questions concerning my welfare, he asked me when I had been to see him before. I answered, I had not for a long time. Then he asked me the reason of it. I dare not now make any formal excuses as usual; but burst out into tears, and told him, I had been too wicked. He no sooner perceived what my condition was, but like a tender father to a little child, bid me not grieve, if that was the reason; I was wel∣come to him <HI>now:</HI> And he would do all he could to help me forward. And after some more conversation, contrary to my expectation, he asked me if I did not desire to join to the church? I said, that was indeed part of my bu∣siness.
<PB N="31" REF="035636_0016_100613F6419CDF50"/>
I had met with many hinderances, and particularly that awful text of scripture, "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself," had made me afraid to approach the Lord's table. But <HI>now</HI> resolving, through grace, to rely upon Christ alone for assistance and acceptance, re∣nouncing all my own righteousness, believing it to be a positive commanded duty, I dare not omit it once more, if I might be received. Up∣on this he told me he should inquire into my character. This I told him I expected; but could tell him more of myself, than any could say of me, having been, through restraining grace, kept from open and scandalous sins. Then he said I had great cause to be thankful. He bid me come to him, as often as I had a desire, if it was morning, noon or night, and I should be always welcome. And he lent me a book, en∣titled, "But they seek a better country, even an heavenly." I was so delighted with it, that I sat up all night to read it two or three times over.</P>
<P>I visited Mr. Clap very often; and he as often expressed his willingness to do me good. And once in particular, after he had done so, he lift∣ed up his hands, giving me his blessing, and said, "You see I am willing to do you all the good I can; and if such a poor, sinful creature as I am, is willing to do so, think with yourself, how much more willing your glorious Lord is to receive you."</P>
<P>These words having so much reason in them, filled me with joy unspeakable. I hardly knew how to get home. I saw Christ willing, and I,
<PB N="32" REF="035636_0017_100613F9C8C7AA58"/>
through grace, made willing. I could utter no other language but, "Come in, Lord Jesus, take full possession; I will come to thee, thou art mine, and I am thine. Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight." I immediately retir∣ed when I got home, to give vent to my feel∣ings. But O, what a rapture was I in, when I renewed my solemn engagements to be the Lord's! Enabled, I trust, by grace, sincerely to take the Lord Jehovah for my covenant God; the Lord Jesus to be my Prophet, Priest and King; the Holy Ghost for my comforter, guide and sanctifier; the scriptures for my rule to walk by: Giving up myself, soul and body, all my faculties and members, as instruments of righteousness. O, how I could sing of redeem∣ing love and free grace! Surely my heart reach∣ed forth in burning desires after the blessed Je∣sus. O, how was I ravished with his love! And when examining myself, thrice putting the ques∣tion to my soul, which Christ put to Peter, Tell me, O my soul, lovest thou the Lord Jesus? How did my heart melt, and my eyes slow with tears, in appealing to him! Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee. And when inquiring into the cause of this love which I felt, and from whence it flowed, it still over∣came me more, because I knew I was brought to love him, by the powerful grace of Christ, who was before an enemy to him. This caused me to loath myself, and cry out Lord, what a traitor have I been, and yet thou hast freely lov∣ed me! O, why me, Lord! Why am I not in hell! Why among the living to praise the Lord!
<PB N="33" REF="035636_0017_100613F9C8C7AA58"/>
There can be no other reason, but this; where my sins have abounded, thy grace has much more abounded. O, amazing grace! Hast thou snatched me as a brand out of the burning! O, hast thou ransomed my soul from destruction, and delivered me from my own lusts, and out of the clutches of a cruel tyrant, who had so long enslaved me, and tyrannised over me in misery! O, then how sweet was a Saviour! I could heartily subscribe to those words of scripture, "Unto you who believe he is precious. The chief among ten thousand, altogether lovely."</P>
<P>Thus I continued from day to day, in such ecstacies of joy, thirsting for full sanctification, and more intimate communion with God; daily asking what I should render to him for all his benefits to such an hell deserving sinner; earnestly begging that God would find out some way for me, that I might be made instrumental in advancing his kingdom and interest in the world. O, how I dreaded being an unprofitable ser∣vant: The employment I still followed seemed to encourage me to hope God intended to make use of me for the instruction of little ones; which caused me often to bless God for placing me in that calling. And though I know that it every thing I offend, and in all come short of God's glory; so that every performance has need of washing in the blood of Christ; yet it is a comfort to me, to this day, that I was ena∣bled by grace to labour with the little souls, then committed to my charge; but desire to be humbled that I did no more. O, that I had been more faithful I Surely I longed that all the

And indeed all the trials I met with, which were various had, through the abounding goodness of God this effect, <HI>to quicken me yet more.</HI></P>
<P>But Satan had still a desire to sift me as whea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He assaulted me daily; but those words of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blessed Jesus were frequently applied for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> support, "I have prayed for thee, that thy fait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fail not."

my eyes, telling me it was impossible, not with∣standing my great hopes, for me ever to be sav∣ed. He was still sure of me, and would not let me go. I should surely turn back again, and be worse than ever. It is impossible to relate the tenth part of the fiery darts he slung at me. But I was composed, not in the least daunted; but could prove him a liar in every thing he suggest∣ed, by scripture, which flowed into my mind, as though I had learned it all by heart. Never had I such a variety of scripture texts at my command in all my life, either before, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> since. There was nothing he could allege against me, but if I knew it was true, I immediately sub∣scribed to it; and then flew to the particular properties of the blood of Christ, which I found sufficient for me. Thus I overcame him by the blood of the Lamb; and was left, in the issue, filled with the consolations of the blessed Spirit; triumphing over Satan; blessing and praising God for delivering me out of the hand of this cruel tyrant; adoring the lovely Jesus. And thus I spent the remainder of that night. O, how sweet was it to me! I longed for more strength to praise and love; and even to be dis∣solved, and to be with Christ.</P>
<P>Thus I continued for some time, rejoicing and resolving, by assisting grace, to press forward, and by all means to make my calling and elec∣tion sure. Then I wrote my experience to be communicated to the church; and I was admit∣ted, February 6, 1737, to partake of that holy ordinance of the Lord's Supper. But it is impos∣sible for me to express the ecstacy of joy I was
<PB N="36" REF="035636_0019_100613FD38852590"/>
in, when I saw myself there, who was by nature a child of wrath, an heir of hell, and by practice a rebel against God, a resister of his grace, a piercer of the lovely Jesus, unworthy of the crumbs that fall; yet, through free grace, com∣pelled to come in, and partake of children's bread. It was indeed sweet to me to feed by faith on the broken body of my dearest Lord. Surely it did humble me to the dust, and filled me with self abhorrence, as I meditated on his sufferings and death, and knew my sins to be the procuring cause. But when I came to take the cup, and by faith to apply the precious proper∣ties of the blood of Christ to my soul, the veil of unbelief seemed to drop off, and I was forc∣ed to cry out, "My Lord, and my God," when I beheld the hole in his side, and the prints of the nails. And I could not but, in the words of Peter, appeal to him, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee." O then I was admitted, with the beloved disciple, to lean on his breast! O, astonishing grace, and unspeakable joy, to see God reconciled to me, in and through him; and he bidding me welcome to his table! The Holy Spirit, by his powerful influences applied all this for my strong conso∣lation. O, what a feast is this, when intimate communion with the glorious God is thus ob∣tained! When strong covenant engagements with him are renewed; I being assured that he was my God, and giving myself, body and soul, to him forever, and rejoicing in him as my only portion forevermore. Surely, I thought, I could never enough adore the
<PB N="37" REF="035636_0019_100613FD38852590"/>
lovely Jesus for appointing such an ordinance as this.</P>
<P>But I cease to say any more of this; for it is impossible for me to describe the thousandth part of what I then felt. O, that I could always live as one who had thus been on the mount with God! The next morning I was as much refreshed by meditating on the 32d Psalm, from the first verse, to the end of the 5th. This caus∣ed me yet more to adore distinguishing grace, and even to be swallowed up with love to the immaculate Lamb; and resolve more and more, with full purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord. The frequent language of my soul was this, "Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee."</P>
<P>I daily renewed my covenant engagements with God: But that they might be more invio∣lably kept, I resolved to write them. And ac∣cordingly began to do it; and went on comfort∣ably, till I came to write these words, "That I would leave, lose, and deny all that was dear to me, when it stood in competition with God, even life itself, if he should please to call for it, rath∣er than to forsake him and his ways." Then Sa∣tan beset me, and furiously assaulted me. He suggested to me that I was now lying to God: For I had nothing in me, that would stand by me, when an hour of trial should come; but, with the stony ground hearers, would fall away. This gave me a dreadful shock at first, and caused me to stop a while, to plead with God for a discovery of my state: That he would search me and try me, and see if there were any
<PB N="38" REF="035636_0020_1005EDF780809210"/>
wicked way in me: And grant me real and persevering grace. And in answer to my pe∣titions, the following portion of God's word was powerfully set home to my heart, "My grace is sufficient for thee." And then my heart was filled with joy and praises, firmly believing he was faithful who had promised, and therefore would perform it. So I proceeded to write with more fixed resolution than before.</P>
<P>But again Satan with great fury assaulted me, and told me, my hope would surely perish; and I should turn back, and be worse than ever, and brought to shame; and ranked in order my sins of youth. But I immediately opened my Bible, being dreadfully shocked with fear lest it should be so. And the first lines I cast my eyes upon were in Isaiah liv. 4, &amp;c. "Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: Neither be thou con∣founded, for thou shalt not be put to shame: For thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. For thy Maker is thine husband, the Lord of hosts is his name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall he be called. For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and griev∣ed in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with ever∣lasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. For this is as the wa∣ters of Noah unto me. For as I have sworn
<PB N="39" REF="035636_0020_1005EDF780809210"/>
that the waters of Noah should n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be remov∣ed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be re∣moved, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee." These gracious promises were so adapted to ev∣ery particular of my circumstances, and applied by the Spirit of God, with such great power, that they strengthened me exceedingly.</P>
<P>But O, when I had finished writing my cov∣enant, which was on the 26th of March, 1737, and came to spread it before God, and with prayers and tears to deliver it to him as my own act and deed, it verily seemed to me that all the heavens rang with acclamations of joy, that such a prodigal as I was returned to my God and Father. And my joy was so great, that my bodily strength failed, and I was, for some time, as one whose soul was ready to break loose, and wing away into the bosom of my God. O, how welcome a messenger would death then have been to me! But my great petition was, that I might with patience wait my appointed time, and glorify God upon earth.</P>
<P>After I had so solemnly delivered my solemn covenant engagements to God, under hand and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal, I went on my way rejoicing; this being the language of my soul, "Who shall separate me from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or dis∣tress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? No. I am persuaded, that neither life, nor death, nor angels, nor princi∣palities,
<PB N="40" REF="035636_0021_10061400A6D50A40"/>
nor powers, nor things present, nor thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus my Lord." And I am astonished, when I remember the a∣mazing condescension of my God! He granted me near access to the throne of his grace contin∣ually: And in almost every thing for which I earnestly prayed, I was remarkably answered; and so surprisingly, at some times, that I was afraid to think it was so.</P>
<P>Once in particular, in that same month of March, as I was asleep in the bed, early in the morning, I was awaked with the most terrible wind that I ever knew. It immediately tore off both my windows, and carried them into the street. I rose directly, and looked out. I think I never saw the heavens and the water look so dreadfully before: And the wind blew exceed∣ing hard, so that it appeared that all the vessels in the harbor would soon be broken to pieces. I thought of those poor souls who were exposed to the fury of the storm; and my heart was fil∣led with tender pity and compassion for them. I retired, for secrecy, into the garret. After I got there, I expected every moment that the roof would be ripped off and blown away. But I was very earnest with God to abate the vio∣lence of the storm, and to have compassion on the poor souls in distress. And while I continued pleading with God, I had an affecting view and sense of the sufficiency of one word of Christ to do it. It was only for him to say, "Peace, be still," and the winds and sea would immediately obey him.
<PB N="41" REF="035636_0021_10061400A6D50A40"/>
And after I had some time thus wrestled with God in prayer, I went down. I had been so earnestly engaged, that I had not perceived any abate∣ment of the storm; but looking again out of the window in my chamber, I was surprised a∣bove measure. The sea looked as calm and pleasant to me, as if there had been no storm. I immediately retired again, and returned thanks for it, as a remarkable answer of prayer. But have often heard since, that it was a piece of pride and presumption for me to think it so. However, this I know, God is both the hearer and answerer of prayer, for Jesus' sake.</P>
<P>I could not avoid, when there was opportu∣nity for it, expressing my love and thankfulness to God, for snatching me as a brand out of the burning: And when I did this once to my mother, with tears of joy running down my cheeks, she said to me, "Ah, child, you will not always find your love thus flaming to the bles∣sed Jesus. After a while you will be more cool again." But I hastily answered, too much like Peter, It was impossible I could be such a mon∣ster for ingratitude. But she told me, she did not mean that I should in reality love him less, but compared the first espousals of a soul to Christ, with that of a husband and wife, which was generally attended with more fondness and joy, than afterwards, though the love might be the same, or stronger.</P>
<P>I continued to go on my way rejoicing for some time, without knowing what is was to be deserted one hour together, or entirely to lose sensible communion with God in any duty or
<PB N="42" REF="035636_0022_100614051EE26710"/>
special ordinance, or ever to lie down without God; or to awake without some sweet and refresh∣ing portion of the word of God in my thoughts. My very sleep was filled with pleasant thoughts of divine things. Surely I enjoyed some foretaste of heaven at this season.</P>
<P>These were happy days.—But now how shall I speak! Oh that I may do it with a heart truly broken for my sins! After all this, I began to grow more conformed to the world. Things which, when I was thus lively, appeared insipid, and indeed odious to me, began to grow more tolerable, and by degrees in a measure pleasant. And depraved nature and Satan together plead∣ed for them thus, "That there was a time for all things; and singing and dancing now and then, with a particular friend, was an innocent di∣version. Who did I see, besides myself, so pre∣cise and strict? Other christians allowed them∣selves in such things, who, I had reason to think, were far superior to me in grace; especially one with whom I was very intimate. Sure, if it was sin, she would not allow herself in it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was for extraordinary christians, such as minis∣ters, and others who were eminent for piety, to avoid the practice of such things, and not for <HI>me.</HI> Who did I think I was, that I should pretend to outdo other christians? They could talk of worldly things. What ailed me?" Thus the devil and carnal reasoning argued me out of a great part of my resolutions for strict godliness; and, in short, made me, in a sort, believe that it was only pride and hypocrisy, and to be seen of men, that had ever made me pretend to it.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="035636_0022_100614051EE26710"/>Thus I sunk by degrees lower and lower, till I had at last almost lost all sense of my former experiences. I had only the bare remembrance of them, and they seemed like dreams or delu∣sion, at some times. At others again, I had some revivals. I still constantly attended the means of grace, and Sabbaths were sometimes very sweet to me. At times I had access to the throne of grace, and obtained some communion with God, and resolved to be more circumspect, and renewed my covenant engagements with God. But I knew I was a dreadful backslider, and had dealt treacherously with God, and sometimes dare not, with any boldness, look up to him; guilt would stop my mouth. At other times gracious invitations to backsliders to return, would revive me. Thus I continued, for a great while, some times revived, and sometimes sunk, and dejected.</P>
<P>In Sept. 1740, God in mercy sent his dear servant Whitefield here, which in some measure stirred me up. But when Mr. Tennent came soon after, it pleased God to bless his preaching so to me, that it roused me. But I was all the winter after exercised with dreadful doubts and fears about my state. I questioned the truth of all I had experienced, and feared I had never yet passed through the pangs of the new birth, or ever had one spark of grace. And what confirmed this to me, my dear aged pastor, Mr. Clap, frequently preached, that they who had <HI>real grace,</HI> had <HI>growing grace.</HI> This used to make me tremble, because I could not perceive any growth; but thought I rather went back,
<PB N="44" REF="035636_0023_10061409A5D75CD8"/>
and grew worse. Thus I was covered over with thick clouds for months together. Oh, the dreadful fruits of backsliding! At last, I applied to Mr. Clap, and begged of him, that if he knew of any thing which I had left undone, by what I had told him, or wrote for my admission into the church, he would let me know it, that the mistake might be rectified before it was too late. I was indeed possessed with the thought, that he saw so clearly into my state, that he knew I was a hypocrite, though I did not till then. I told him of this. But he said, he never thought so; and put me upon renewing covenant en∣gagements with God, and giving myself up to him <HI>then</HI>; and perhaps I should find I had done so before. This I endeavored to do, and did get some relief; but was not yet satisfied. The tokens of a woful backslider were upon me. I had forsaken my first love, and God justly de∣serted me. Sometimes that text would refresh me, "Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings." My heart would answer, "Behold I come unto thee; for thou art the Lord my God." And sometimes that pas∣sage, "I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins: Return unto me; for I have redeemed thee." But ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all this time I could not get clear of doubts; but thought such dreadful formality and hypoc∣risy, as I perceived to be in my heart, could not consist with grace. I labored along thus all the winter, unresolved how the case stood be∣tween God and my soul: And an uncomforta∣ble, dreadful life it was. At some times I was
<PB N="45" REF="035636_0023_10061409A5D75CD8"/>
so covered with darkness, that I seemed to be sure I had not one spark of grace: At other times afraid of ingratitude, afraid to deny what God had done for my soul. Oh, these were the dreadful fruits of backsliding, and losing my first love! The Lord in mercy preserve me, that I may never do so any more!</P>
<P>I continued thus till March, 1741. And then it pleased God to return Mr. Tennent to us again, and he preached twenty one sermons here. But while he was here, I was more than ever distressed. I had lost the sensible manifesta∣tions of Christ's love. I had no more but a bare remembrance of some things, which I had experienced; and yet I was afraid to draw up a conclusion, one way or the other. I applied to Mr. Tennent, and he discoursed very suitably with me. But still I was not quiet, but exceed∣ingly distressed.</P>
<P>I had some light and refreshment under his preaching the next day; but my darkness return∣ed again, and I sunk very low. I was so afraid of presumption, that I dare not conclude my state was good. And he struck directly at those things, for which I had so foolishly and wickedly pleaded christian example, such as singing songs, dancing, and foolish jesting, which is not convenient. He said, he would not say there was no such thing as a dancing christian, but he had a very mean opinion of such as could bear to spend their time so, when it is so short, and the work for eternity so great. Then, and not till then, was I fully convinced what prod∣igal wasters of precious time such things were.
<PB N="46" REF="035636_0024_1006140B318E1C88"/>
And, through grace, I have abhorred them all ever since. And to the glory of God be it spoken; for it is only from his sovereign won∣derful goodness to me.</P>
<P>I am indeed now astonished when I think how I myself, or any other christian, who has once tasted one moment's sweet communion with God, can have any relish for such vanities as singing and dancing, &amp;c. O, how much great∣er is the pleasure which is to be enjoyed in the exer∣cise of religious duties, than any such thing can afford! Not only so; but I am amazed to think how I could possibly want such things to pass away time: For I now find the precious moments fly so fast, and my work so great, that I am often hard beset to know how to spend my time as God requires, between the immediate exercises of religion, public, private and secret, and the calling, in which God has placed me. I know the same God, who has bid me hear, and pray, and search the scriptures, has bid me work; and both in their place is my duty. And I find it very difficult to yield a uniform obedience; to give to God, what he requires for himself, and to the world, what is required as a duty, and no more. Besides all this, my heart is so perverse, that I have enough to do to watch against pride, sloth, wanderings, formality, hypocrisy, and the temptations of Satan, who is always ready to disquiet me. All these, I find, are employment enough to take up all my time, without those former recreations. If I am cheerful, a song of Zion is more sweet and refreshing to me, that all the vain songs in the world ever were, or can
<PB N="47" REF="035636_0024_1006140B318E1C88"/>
be. And sure I am, whatever any may plead, that there is a time for all things, God never yet allowed time for sin.</P>
<P>O Lord, humble me for the bad example I have set, since I called myself a Christian; and forbid that any should ever again be able to plead my example for vanity. And oh, that all who name the name of Christ, may be ena∣bled to depart from iniquity, and abstain from all appearance of evil! And if we pretend to be in Christ, oh that we may walk even as he walked! For I am persuaded, that the careless walk of professing christians, lulls more con∣sciences asleep, when the devil, and flesh and blood set in to plead their example, than the vices of all the world besides, who make no profession. And oh, what a dreadful thing for christians to be the means of ruining precious and immortal souls, and diminishing that king∣dom and interest, which they should be forever engaged to promote; and promote his kingdom and interest, against which they should always proclaim open war! Oh dreadful indeed! that Christ should be so wounded in the house of his friends! Lord, make me yet more circum∣spect, for Jesus' sake.—But to proceed—</P>
<P>I still continued in very dark and melancho∣ly circumstances, between hope and fear, afraid to conclude one way or the other. And having no opportunity to speak with Mr. Tennent again, I wrote to him as well as I could, briefly relat∣ing what I had experienced, and begged of him to try it by scripture rules, and judge of it accordingly, and give me his opinion; that I
<PB N="48" REF="035636_0025_1006140CCD9FDE88"/>
might not sin by denying the grace of God, if I had it; nor speak peace to my soul, if God did not. To which he returned the following answer.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>"MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I LIKE your experiences well. They seem to me to be scriptural and encouraging; and I think you may humbly take comfort from them, and give God the glory of his pure grace. They who have been so humbled and distressed for sin, as to be divorced from the governing love and practice of it; and have been by the Spirit of God made willing to embrace the Redeemer deliberately, unreservedly, and resolutely, upon his own terms, have a sure interest in the great salvation. John i.12. To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. And whatever involuntary defects they are guilty of, they shall not break the everlasting covenant between God and their souls. Though they have played the harlot with many lovers; yet they may return to their first husband. Though God may hide his face for a little mo∣ment, yet with everlasting loving kindness will he return. Though they be sometimes easily beset with sin; yet he, who was the author, will be the finisher of their faith. I add no more but love, and remain, your real friend,</P>

<SIGNED>G. T."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I have transcribed this letter, that, if Provi∣dence should ever cast these lines into the hands of any in like circumstances, it may, if the Lord will, have the same happy effect on them, as, by
<PB N="49" REF="035636_0025_1006140CCD9FDE88"/>
the blessing of God, it had on me; which was this—The letter itself was exceeding sweet and refreshing; but the precious texts of scripture, which were quoted, were so powerfully set home on my mind, that they scattered all my clouds im∣mediately, and I was as one restored from the grave. Then with life and courage I again re∣newed my written covenant engagements with God, and became more lively and zealous for God than ever. O the amazing goodness of God to me! I have heard of some christians who never recover such backslidings all their days. But I have not since lost my evidences of grace. Though I have been sometimes un∣der desertion, yet I could frequently say, "Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the light of my countenance, and my God."</P>
<P>After I was thus revived, my longings to be made useful in the world returned, and I earn∣estly pleaded with God that he would not suffer me to live any longer an unprofitable servant; but would point out some way, in which I might be useful: And that I might now be as exem∣plary for piety, as I had been for folly. And it pleased God so to order it, that I had room to hope my petitions were both heard, and in a measure answered. For soon after this a num∣ber of young women, who were awakened to a concern for their souls, came to me, and desired my advice and assistance, and proposed to join in a society, provided I would take the care of them. To which, I trust with a sense of my
<PB N="50" REF="035636_0026_1006140E57DF1198"/>
own unworthiness, I joyfully consented. And much sweetness we enjoyed in these meetings. (And blessed be God, they are yet kept up.)</P>
<P>About this time it pleased God to lay his af∣flicting hand upon me by the removal of my on∣ly brother by death. As to the loss of his person, I found I could quietly submit, and say, "The Lord gave, and he has taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." But I had a sinful curiosity to know how it was with his precious soul: And being filled with fear about it, I was very much dejected. But I knew my cu∣riosity was sinful. And I pleaded earnestly with God, that he would not suffer me to attempt to pry into the secrets of his will; but give me a quiet submission. I continued wrestling with God for resignation to his will, till about two o'clock in the morning, and then I went to bed, still begging that I might never spend another day unresigned. And just about break of day I awaked with the following words strongly im∣pressed on my mind, "Secret things belong un∣to God, but those which are revealed belong unto us. The will of God is done, <HI>the will of God is done.</HI>" These words quieted me, so that I arose as cheerful, composed and thankful, as if I had met with no affliction at all, and I think more so; and never did from that hour, nor could mourn as I had done. This I consid∣ered as a remarkable answer to prayer.</P>
<P>After this my business failed, and I found I could not keep my room where I lived; and which way to turn, I knew not. But was per∣suaded God would point out some way for me.
<PB N="51" REF="035636_0026_1006140E57DF1198"/>
I had several offers to go into the country to keep school in credible families, where I had a prospect of wanting for nothing of the necessa∣ries of this life. But I could not bear the thought of going from the means of grace, and other precious privileges, which I then enjoy∣ed. And the society of young women often entreated me not to leave them. I had double ties every way, and knew not what to do. But I was not distressed, believing God would pro∣vide for me. Accordingly he did so; though by an afflictive dispensation. It pleased him to remove a dear friend by death, with whom I was very intimate. Her husband was a very sober good sort of a man, and wanted me to keep his shop for my board, and wash for my∣self. This offer suited me very well; for here∣by I was not likely to be deprived of any of my religious privileges. So on the first day of July, I went there to live, and indeed had much comfort. Dear Mr. Clap met with the society at his house twice every week, which I constantly attended; and religion seemed to be the chief business of my life. Had much com∣fort in all the duties of religion, public, private, and secret: And had as much time to spend in them as I could desire.</P>
<P>About this time I had the offer of a second marriage, with one who appeared to be a real christian (and I could not think of being une∣qually yoked with one who was not such.) I took the matter into serious consideration. I foresaw there were difficulties which I must un∣avoidably encounter; and many duties would
<PB N="52" REF="035636_0027_100614122ABB0E70"/>
be incumbent on me, to which I had been a stranger: Particularly, in my being a mother in law to three sons, which my proposed husband had by a first wife. But after weighing all cir∣cumstances, as well as I could, in my mind, and earnest prayer▪ which God enabled me to con∣tinue in for some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. I concluded it was the will of God, that I should accept of the offer, and accordingly was married to Mr. Henry Osborn, on the fifth day of May, 1742.</P>
<P>The next July after I was married, I went with an intimate friend, to Little Compton, on purpose to join in a fast which was appointed there to implore the outpouring of the Spirit of God on that place; which was attended with much solemnity. The next day, which was the 29th day of the month, my friend and I were riding to a private religious meeting, and my horse stumbled and threw me over his head. My stomach came first to the ground; and yet was comparatively but little hurt; and close by the spot where my head came was a large rock, which must, in all probability, have ended my days, if I had fallen upon it. This gave me a sense of the goodness of God in pre∣serving me. I got safe to the house to which I proposed to go. And in the evening Mr. Ty∣lar preached a sermon, which greatly affected the people, who were under concern before: But they with much difficulty kept silence, till the sermon and prayer were ended; and then cried out in vehement agonies, lamenting their lost condition without a Savior, and pleading with God to have mercy on them, and give
<PB N="53" REF="035636_0027_100614122ABB0E70"/>
them an interest in Christ. At this time I had an awful sense of the state of the damned, who were crying out under their torments; but past remedy.</P>
<P>Then a number of young women with my∣self withdrew into a chamber, in order to form a religious society. Where we spent some time in praying, reading, conversing and singing. At the same time a company of young men were engaged in another room in the same ex∣ercises. We happened to sing in both rooms at the same time. The melody was very sweet, and gave me lively apprehensions of the glori∣ous employment, and blessed enjoyment of the saints in the New Jerusalem; and filled my soul with adoring thoughts of God.</P>
<P>But in my return to the place where I lodg∣ed, it being late in the night, we were over∣taken in the most awful storm of thunder and lightning that I ever heard or saw. During the terrible claps of thunder my horse stood trem∣bling; and as soon as they ceased, ran with full speed. I was then filled with a greater sense of the awfulness and majesty of a God, than I had ever experienced before; and more realizing thoughts of the solemnity of the last day. I did not imagine that was the time; but thought it a great resemblance of it. And I expected every moment to be called to appear before my Judge, either by the thunder and lightning, or a fall from my horse. This put me upon examining myself, to see where the foundation of my hope was laid; and whether I had real grace, and a sure interest in Christ;
<PB N="54" REF="035636_0028_10061416488D21F8"/>
that he might then be my advocate. I earnestly pleaded that this might be my very case. Upon strict search, I found such evidences as kept me from all fears of hell. Though I did not then feel the manifestations of the love of God, as at some other times; yet I found Christ was my only refuge. But just after the last hard clap of thunder, my horse turning suddenly round a corner, threw me off backward. My right temple came first to the ground. As I fell, I committed my spirit into the hands of my Savior, expecting death: But was wonder∣fully preserved; so that I was but little hurt. Thus God shewed me, in this day and night of large experience, what he could do <HI>with me,</HI> in a way of judgment; and what <HI>for me,</HI> in a way of mercy, in preserving me, when in imminent danger of death. Lord, for thine own name's sake, write a law of gratitude in my heart for this, with all my other mercies. O Lord, what am I, the chief of sinners, that thou art thus mindful of me!</P>
<P>Soon after this, we fell into disagreeable and difficult worldly circumstances, with respect to living and paying the debts we owed. My greatest concern was with respect to the latter, lest we should not be able to do justice, and so wrong our creditors, and bring dishonor on God, and our profession. Under this pressure and distress, I was relieved and supported by the following words of Scripture, "Let your conversation be without covetousness; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e content with such things as ye have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake
<PB N="55" REF="035636_0028_10061416488D21F8"/>
thee." I lived cheerfully, upon this promise, for a considerable time. And God ordered things so that our creditors were paid to their satisfaction.</P>
<P>I have often thought God has so ordered it throughout my days hitherto, that I should be in an afflicted, low condition, as to worldly circumstances, and inclined the hearts of oth∣ers to relieve me in all my distresses, on pur∣pose to suppress that pride of my nature, which doubtless would have been acted out greatly to his dishonor, had I enjoyed hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, and had prosperity, so as to live independent of others. I will therefore think it best for me; for the tenderness of my friends to me, has always had a tendency to humble me greatly, and cause me to admire the goodness of God to me, that while others were daily complaining, that the rich have many friends; but the poor is des∣pised by his neighbor, I could never say I had not as much love and respect shewed me, as if I possessed great riches, and that by the rich, as well as the poor. So that, on the account of my poverty, I never was despised.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs Osborn appears to have possessed from her youth, a high taste for a genteel independent way of living: And consequently a proportionable aversion to that poverty and dependence which would reduce her to the lower walks of life. God was pleased to order things so in his providence respecting her, as most effectually to cross and mortify this strong propensity; which was the occasion of much pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, hard str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggles and sore conflicts, until she was brought to a set∣tled and abiding submission, and constant acquiescence in the will of God, in ordering and fixing her outward circumstances; in consequence of which she enjoyed great and constant calmness and serenity of mind the last twenty years of her life, when she was brought to such poverty as to have nothing of her own on which she could live, and was wholly dependent on others for daily support; and yet wanted nothing, in a happy contentment with her lot, and such things as she had; giving thanks to God for his constant and wonderful goodness to her; and really, in the highest and best sense, possessing all things.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035636_0029_10061418C480CD30"/>AND now I have, according to my desire, committed some of the many thousands of my experiences to writing. And I will give my rea∣sons for doing it. The first motive, as I men∣tioned in the introduction, was, that I might be excited to praise and glorify that God who has wrought such wonders for me. And through the influence of his blessed Spirit, moving me thereto, it has had this effect, in some measure, throughout the time of my writing it. The Lord grant I may continue so all my days; and then my first great end will be answered. Sec∣ondly,</P>
<P>I have always reaped much benefit myself, by reading the lives and experiences of others. Sometimes they have been blessed to convince me of sin—Sometimes, to scatter doubts—And sometimes to raise my affections into a flame. When expressions have been warm, they have put me upon imitating them as well as I could, by breathing out my soul in like manner. And though I fall ever so short of the excellencies with which others have been endowed; yet I know all things are possible with God. He can bless a word from the weakest, meanest, and un∣worthiest of all creatures, even <HI>me.</HI> If a word in these lines ever prove useful to one soul, after my decease, it will be ten thousand times more than I deserve from the hands of a bountiful God: To him alone be all the glory. It is his glory, I trust, through rich grace, at which I sincerely
<PB N="57" REF="035636_0029_10061418C480CD30"/>
aim. And if it does not consist with that, to have these lines seen by any, either before or af∣ter my decease, I heartily desire, so far as I can possibly fathom that unfathomable deep, my own deceitful heart, and know it, that they may be all buried in oblivion. Surely, I had rather my name, and all belonging to me, should be forgotten among men, than remembered to the dishonor of my God. I am an ignorant short-fighted creature: But God knows what will be for the best. To him I commit it, praying that, in his all wise providence, it may be disposed of as he sees meet.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. Containing a <HI>GENERAL ACCOUNT</HI> of her <HI>LIFE</HI>▪</HEAD>
<P>THE parents of Mrs. Osborn were never in affluent worldly circumstances; and had lit∣tle or nothing to give to her when she mar∣ried: And perhaps did not give her all the as∣sistance which they were able to do, as they were not pleased with her marrying to the per∣son whom she chose. He was young, and used the sea, and had nothing beforehand, and died in the second voyage after he was married, and she was left a poor widow with one young child before she was twenty years old. She contin∣ued a widow more than eight years. In which time she did no more than just support herself and son, by her industry, in keeping a small school part of the time; which business she was, at length, obliged to relinquish, by sickness, in which she needed and had the assistance of some of her kind friends. Thus she continued a poor widow, till she married the seccond time, in the twenty ninth year of her age.</P>
<P>Her second husband was in some trade and business when she married him; but soon ap∣peared to owe to his creditors more than he was able to pay. They gave up all they had and their creditors were paid, so that they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="59" REF="035636_0030_1006141A4C4BACB0"/>
all made easy, and gave them a discharge. From that time he did but little or no business, by reason of bodily disorders, and other infirm∣ities. At the same time he had children who were poor, and wanted assistance. In these cir∣cumstances, Mrs. Osborn began to keep school again in May, 1744. In which business she continued about thirty years, till her eyesight and bodily strength failed, so that she was o∣bliged to give it up. She was, during this whole time, attended with bodily weakness, pains and infirmities; her constitution being greatly in∣jured by taking mercury in an improper man∣ner and degree, which was prescribed by her physician when afflicted with the distressing dis∣order, which she mentions in the account she has given of her life, the weakening and painful effects of which attended her to the day of her death. Under these disorders, which were at times very distressing, she persevered in her bu∣siness, which in her circumstances required a diligence, circumspection and resolution, which have been equalled by few or none, until she lost her sight and strength, to such a degree as obliged her to desist.</P>
<P>For this space of about thirty years she pre∣sided in a school, which was most of the time so large that she was obliged to employ assistants. The whole number of children in her school a∣mounted sometimes to seventy or more, some of whom, at times eight or ten, she boarded.</P>
<P>But, having a considerable family of her own to maintain, and other dependents which she thought it her duty to help, and the price for
<PB N="60" REF="035636_0031_1006141BD33BC078"/>
schooling and boarding being low, she, through this whole time, was not able to lay up any thing; but was reduced to great straits and dif∣ficulties; and at the end of the year she fre∣quently found herself in the rear, rather than to have gained any overplus or stock for the next; this kept her in a constant state of peculiar trial, and temptation to worldly solicitude and anxie∣ty, which required an uncommon degree of faith and piety to surmount. And sometimes, under the darkest appearances, her faith would so far fail that she would sink into gloom and dejection, especially in the former part of this time. But she evidently made advances in her faith and cheerful resignation to the divine will, and happy contentment with the allotments of Divine Providence, while her trials and worldly straits, continued as great as ever: So that she appeared, at length, to have got the victory over the world to an uncommon degree, and to have enjoyed a calm, sweet resignation and content∣ment in her worldly circumstances, which was the source of high religious enjoyment, in the constant and strong exercise of that piety, by which she enjoyed God as her only and eternal portion. This appears from her diary; and was especially manifest to her intimate friends, after she was obliged to give up all business, and was wholly dependent on her friends for sup∣port; of which a more particular account may be given, before these memoirs are finished.</P>
<P>Mrs. Osborn began to keep school the sec∣ond time, as has been observed, in the month of May, 1744, in the thirty first year of her age.
<PB N="61" REF="035636_0031_1006141BD33BC078"/>
With respect to which some things are noted in her diary, which may be properly transcribed here.</P>
<P>"<HI>Saturday April</HI> 28, 1744.—This day I am determined, if the Lord will, to enter again into the calling of keeping school. Will the Lord in mercy bless my endeavors, and prosper the work of my hands, and overrule this for his own glory, by making me instrumental in promoting the good of souls. O Lord, if thou wilt again employ me, and make me faithful, my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. Oh, pre∣serve me from making dependence on any thing I can do, either for soul or body: But if it may consist with thy will, O bless me in this lawful undertaking. But above all, O Lord, go on to resign me to thy will. Not mine, but thine be done. Lord, I desire to leave it with thee. O undertake for me, and deal graciously with me, for thine own sake, as thou usest to do to those who love thy name. Help me to eye thee in all thy dispensations of providence, and be thankful to thee for every temporal mercy. Dear Lord, order it so that thine own honor may be secured, and thou mayest be glorified in me, and it is enough. Once more, I beg to be resigned, and to take all things well at thy dear hand. Whether thou smile or frown, let me bless and love; for this is my duty, and what thou justly expectest of me. Lord, thou art worthy of infinitely more love and praise than I am capable of giving: But oh, accept my at∣tempts to love and praise, for Jesus' sake alone.
<PB N="62" REF="035636_0032_1006141F35EE1760"/>
In his name I come to thee for all blessings, spir∣itual and temporal.</P>
<P>"<HI>Friday morning, May</HI> 4.—At this time much straitened in myself to know if it is my duty to pray evening and morning in my school, if the Lord bless me with one. I am a∣fraid of ostentation, afraid of doing any thing to be seen of men. I am afraid of neglecting it, on account of what others will say or think, lest that should be being ashamed of Christ and his ways, in this wicked generation; and yet, I am afraid of bringing religion into contempt. O Lord, direct me to do, in this case, as will most consist with thy glory. For I beseech thee, dear Lord, that thou wilt not suffer me to enter into this calling, except thou wilt be with me, and bless me in it. Oh, make me instrumental of the good of their souls committed to my charge, as well as faithful to their parents in in∣structing them. And if it be thy will that I pray with them, as well as for them, oh strength∣en me and encourage my heart. Lord, pour out on me a spirit of prayer and supplication, that I may ask for things agreeable to thy blessed will. O Lord, I leave this case with thee. I beg thou wilt direct me, and suffer nothing but pure aims at thy glory, and the good of souls, to be the governing principle in me. Lord, I am afraid of the reasonings of my own deceitful heart. It easily imposes upon, and deceives me. But, blessed be thy name, it cannot de∣ceive thee. O, do thou search it and try it, and discover to me more of its vileness, that I may never be a fool, trusting to it. Lord, it is
<PB N="63" REF="035636_0032_1006141F35EE1760"/>
thine: Oh mould it into thine own likeness, fill it with thy grace, and possess it forever.</P>
<P>"<HI>Thursday May</HI> 10.—I desire to record it with thankfulness, that God in his providence gave me an opportunity last evening to advise with my dear aged pastor (Mr. Clap) about praying with my scholars. He rejoiced much in the proposal; and advised me, by all means to proceed, and let nothing discourage me, and fear no scoffs; for it was God's cause, and he who put it into my heart to do it, would take care of his own glory. He likewise reminded me how highly Christ resented it, when his own disciples would have deprived little children of privileges. He advised me to be brief and plain, and often to mention those words in Matth. vi. "Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be open∣ed unto you." And those in Prov. "I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me." And to make confession of sin, and plead for pardon for Christ's sake.—En∣deavor to follow him in plainness, so that the little ones might understand what I meant, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"As I think I never saw him more joyful, and pleased with me, so I know not when I have come away more comforted: For my scruples all vanished. And now, by assisting grace, I determine to proceed, as God shall en∣able me. Blessed be God, that I enjoy so great a privilege as my dear pastor, who has thus en∣couraged my faith, obedience and joy; and helped me in my strait. And now, O my God, I am convinced it is my duty to pray with my dear
<PB N="64" REF="035636_0033_1006142296447080"/>
children, I fly to thee again for assisting grace. Lord, without that it will be only a piece of formality, and will never prove serviceable to any. I beseech thee, O Lord, pour out on me a spirit of prayer, and fill me with bowels of compassion to poor little ones."</P>
<P>Mrs. Osborn not only prayed daily with the children in her school; but was constant and careful to instruct them in the principles of re∣ligion, and in their duty to God and man; and at certain times, and on particular occasions, se∣riously addressed them on the concerns of their souls, urging their attention to the Bible, to Je∣sus Christ, and the way of salvation by him; and to give themselves up to him, to fear and serve him, &amp;c. Her discourses with them on these subjects frequently appeared to make im∣pressions on their minds, and greatly to affect them: And most of the many hundreds who were instructed in her school, retained a love and esteem for her in the future part of their life, and numbers of them, how many cannot be now known, have never lost the serious impres∣sions, which they received by her instruction and admonitions; but they have issued in their saving conversion to God. And we may rea∣sonably consider some of them now in heaven with her, as her glory, and joining with her in mutual joy.</P>
<P>She composed and committed to writing a number of particular directions and rules for the children in her school, pointing out the decent and proper manner of their behavior towards her, and each other in school, and when going
<PB N="65" REF="035636_0033_1006142296447080"/>
away and returning; at home and abroad; when in the house and by the way; and their manner of speech and behavior towards all with whom they had any connection and concern; which rules were to be often read in school. These rules discovered her good judgment and taste, respecting the propriety and decency of conduct of children in all situations, and towards superi∣ors, equals and inferiors, in age and other cir∣cumstances. They might be very useful to teachers of schools and to their pupils, were they transcribed; and were they not too lengthy to be inserted here.</P>
<P>A FEW months after Mrs. Osborn began to keep school the second time, her only son, Sam∣uel Wheaten, died, being near twelve years old, who was an apprentice in the country above twenty miles from Newport, and was a promis∣ing youth. She has recorded some of her ex∣ercises under this trial, part of which will be here inserted.</P>
<P>"<HI>Friday morning, September</HI> 22, 1744.—On Thursday afternoon, the sixth day of this month, I had the sorrowful news that my only son was sick unto death. God in his providence pro∣vided presently for me—My dear Susa Antho∣ny to keep my house—A horse for my husband and myself to ride, and all other things com∣fortable. And on my way God gave me such
<PB N="66" REF="035636_0034_10061424359A4E28"/>
a sense of his goodness to me in a thousand in∣stances, that instead of sinking under my sorrow, my mind was employed in attention to, and blessing God for my mercies. Sometimes, that he was not snatched from me in a moment, by some awful accident—That he was not at so great a distance, but I might be allowed to go to him, with hopes of finding him yet alive▪ And those precious promises which in the morn∣ing had supported me, still continued as a re∣freshing cordial; even these. "Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will hear thee. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him; and saved him out of all his troubles."</P>
<P>"On Friday morning we got to Rehoboth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where I found my son much swelled with a dropsy, and pined to a mere skeleton with the jaundice, scurvy and consumption, all combin∣ing. He rattled in his throat, like a dying per∣son, laboring for every breath. He was given over by the doctors and all friends, who lament∣ed him, and did the best for him in their pow∣er, as to the body. But alas! my great con∣cern was for that precious jewel, his immortal soul. I endeavored to improve every opportu∣nity to discourse with him, and read to him such portions of scripture as I thought suitable, with passages out of Mr. Allen's Alarm, &amp;c. And I was enabled to pray all the day, by e∣jaculatory breathings, and sometimes to plead and wrestle with God on his behalf: Though a∣las! God was pleased to hide his dealings with him altogether. For I could discern no evi∣dence of a work of grace wrought on his soul▪
<PB N="67" REF="035636_0034_10061424359A4E28"/>
for which I did plead from day to day. I did not so much as once, in all his sickness, pray for his life; but for some evidence that his soul might live. And for want of this, I sometimes seemed to be crushed down, having a sense of his doleful case, if not reconciled to God. On Thursday, Sept. 13, the day before he died, I was just ready to give up, and sit down discour∣aged. My heart even almost died with fear of what would become of him. But just in this juncture, God in his providence ordered it so that I received a letter from my dear S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa, which was a cordial to my drooping spirits.</P>
<P>"In his dying moments I had an awful sense of his deplorable condition, if his naked soul should launch into a boundless eternity, without a God to go to. I had also a view and sense of his and my utter inability to help ourselves, and ut∣ter unworthiness that God should help us. And with the woman of Canaan, I cried out, Truth Lord, I am as unworthy as a dog! But I pleaded for the crumbs that fell, one of which would be sufficient for me and mine. I had a clear discovery of the fulness and sufficiency of Christ to make satisfaction. I pleaded that he would have mercy, as on the theif on the cross, then at the eleventh hour; apply but one drop of his precious blood, and it was enough. Thus I was enabled to fill my mouth with arguments, and in bitter agony of soul I wrestled with God for mercy for him. Surely the pangs I then endured for his foul far exceeded those that brought him into the world. But as soon as the soul had taken its flight, I was eased of my
<PB N="68" REF="035636_0035_10061425ED2E2D68"/>
burden. I immediately cast myself, and my burden too, on God. I adored him as a sove∣reign God, and blessed his name; for he had given, and it was he who had taken. Surely he was better to me than ten sons.</P>
<P>"I then arose from my dead child, and was quieted, for the will of God was done, and my work was done, as it respected my child. And God was pleased to give such evidence of his love, that my mouth was filled with praises. But when I looked on the young people who stood round lamenting him, I felt bowels of compas∣sion for them, and besought them to take warn∣ing, and make their speedy flight to the blessed Jesus, before sickness and death overtook them.</P>
<P>"While friends were putting on his grave clothes, I went out into the field and walked, where, with more secrecy and freedom, I could breathe out my soul to God. And the sweet∣ness of that season I cannot express. God dis∣covered himself to be my God, my covenant God, my Father, my Friend, my only portion and happiness, my sovereign, my all in all, my infinite fountain of all fulness. And these were some of the breathings of my soul after him. "Lord, I adore thee as my all. I rejoice in thee as my only portion. Lord, if I have thee, I have enough. Though all the streams were cut off; yet the fountain remains; I cannot be poor. Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none on earth I desire besides thee. Though my flesh and my heart fail; yet God is the strength of my heart and my portion for∣ever. Blessed God, though death separate from
<PB N="69" REF="035636_0035_10061425ED2E2D68"/>
all things here below, it cannot separate be∣tween thee and me." O, here I rejoiced a∣gain, chose my God again, and again renewed the dedication of myself to him, my whole soul and body, with all I have, am, or can do. O, his word comforted, his <HI>rod</HI> comforted me. I saw no frown in it: No, but the kind chastise∣ment of my indulgent Father. This portion of scripture was very sweet, "If ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth." Therefore I cried out, "I know, O Lord, thy judgments are right, and in very faithfulness thou hast af∣flicted me."</P>
<P>"But I must cease.—For such blessed sea∣sons are better felt than expressed. I contin∣ued so composed and comfortable, that I feared those who knew not the cause would think me void of natural affection; till my tak∣ing my last farewell at his funeral. And then I found the bonds of natural affection very strong; and I wept much. But as I followed to the grave, I pleaded thus with God, "Lord, I adore thee still as my sovereign. I do not repine at thy hand. But, dear Lord, pity me, and suffer me to weep under the smart of thy rod; it is my <HI>only son.</HI>" Then I thought on Psalm ciii. "As a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him." This comforted me. But as I inquired again, if my tears were not sinful, and the effect of an un∣resigned will, which I dreaded most of all, I was comforted again by reflecting, that when
<PB N="70" REF="035636_0036_100614277B28AB28"/>
Martha and Mary wept for their brother Laza∣rus, the blessed Jesus was not angry, but wept with them. O, then I again adored a sympa∣thising Savior, a glorious high priest, who was sensibly touched with the feeling of my infirmi∣ties. These and such like were the exercises of my mind, while following and laying my dust into the grave. And ever since I have been kept composed and cheerful.</P>
<P>"The Lord in mercy grant that I may more and more glorify him in this affliction. O that my sins may be more mortified. Lord, grant I may come out of this furnace as gold puri∣fied and fitted for my master's use. If I have behaved in any measure as becomes a child of God, and any resignation has appeared in me, Lord, it is all owing to the riches of thy glori∣ous and special grace: For hadst not thou by that compelled me to act otherwise, I should have flew in thy face, murmured, fretted and repined at thee; cast away all my other com∣forts and mercies, and said I had none left, be∣cause thou hadst taken <HI>one</HI> from me. Lord, these, and more than these, would have been the effects of my perverse nature. Therefore, not unto me, not unto <HI>me</HI>; but to thy glori∣ous name be all the glory forever and ever. Amen."</P>
<P>IN the year 1741, a religious, female soci∣ety was formed under the care of Mrs. Osborn,
<PB N="71" REF="035636_0036_100614277B28AB28"/>
they having chosen her to be their head. Of which she makes mention in her account of her own life, which has been transcribed, page 49. This society met for some time twice ev∣ery week, viz. on Tuesday and Friday even∣ings. Afterwards they agreed to meet but once a week, on the afternoon of Wednesday or Thursday. Mrs. Osborn was continued and considered the head of this society from that time to her decease, which was above fifty years; and it still subsists, and there are above thirty members of it who are now living. It has consisted of a much greater number of members. About thirty years ago, above sixty persons were members of it. But the war, and other evils which have since that time taken place, have diminished it.</P>
<P>This society have met constantly once every week, during this whole time of above half a century, excepting a few interruptions, by some extraordinary occurrences. They also have observed four whole quarterly days in every year, as days of fasting and prayer, confessing their sins, and seeking God for spiritual bless∣ings on themselves, on the church of Christ, and on all nations. They also have been wont to spend the afternoon of every first Thursday of each month in prayer together; and the afternoon of every Saturday before the monthly administration of the Lord's Supper. They have a box, which stands in the room where they meet, into which money is put by each one, as she is able and inclined. And at the end of the year, or any other time, when they
<PB N="72" REF="035636_0037_1006142B1A593188"/>
think proper, the box is by their consent open∣ed, and the money contained in it counted, and generally given for the support of the gospel.</P>
<P>They did agree upon a number of articles and rules, which were committed to writing, to be observed by the society and by each indi∣vidual, and to be signed by every member, and by every one who should afterwards be admit∣ted. The substance of these is as follows:</P>
<P>At the weekly meeting of the society, when the appointed hour arrives, and a number are convened, the exercise shall begin by reading in some profitable book, till all have come in who are expected. Then a prayer shall be made by one of the members; and after that, a chapter in the Bible shall be read, and relig∣ious conversation be attended to, as time shall allow. The meeting to be concluded by an∣other prayer. Four quarterly days in the year, in January, April, July and October, be∣ginning on the first day of every January, to be observed as days of solemn fasting and prayer. We promise not to ridicule or divulge the sup∣posed or apparent infirmities, of any fellow member; but to keep secret all things relating to the society, the discovery of which might tend to do hurt to the society or any individu∣al. We resolve to be charitably watchful over each other, to advise, caution and admonish, where we judge there is occasion, and that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be useful. And we promise not to resent; but kindly and thankfully receive such friendly advice or reproof from any one of our mem∣bers. We will endeavor that our discourse
<PB N="73" REF="035636_0037_1006142B1A593188"/>
while together shall be on the serious and im∣portant subjects of religion: And when sepa∣rate, that our speech and behavior shall be such as become christians, that we may be holy in all conversation.</P>
<P>If any member commit any scandalous sin, or walk unruly, and after proper reproof con∣tinue manifestly impenitent, she shall be ex∣cluded from us, until she give evidence of her repentance. Each one shall pay her propor∣tion to defray the necessary expenses for wood, or any thing else, unless excused by the soci∣ety.</P>
<P>When any person shall manifest to any one of us a desire to join the society, it shall be mentioned in one of our meetings, that all may have opportunity, who desire it, to satisfy them∣selves, respecting the character and conversa∣tion of the person offering to join. And if at the meeting on the next week, there be no ob∣jection to her being admitted, she may apply to the head of the society, who will read our arti∣cles to her, and if she is willing, and do sign them, she shall be considered as a member of the society, regularly admitted.</P>
<P>As to any other matters, which we shall here∣after find conducive to the benefit and good regulation of our society, we engage to leave to the discretion and decision of a major part of us, to whose determination we promise quietly to agree and submit.</P>
<P>This society has evidently been of great ad∣vantage to many if not all the members of it, to the church and congregation to which most
<PB N="74" REF="035636_0038_1006142DA8F89DF0"/>
of the members have belonged, and to the in∣terest of religion in general, especially in New∣port, by their prayers, and apparent sincerity and engagedness in religion, and exemplary conduct.</P>
<P>Mrs. Osborn was by unanimous consent the head of this society above fifty years, as has been observed, even from the first institution of it, to the day of her death; and a great part of the time their meetings were attended at her house. And she was distinguished in her use∣fulness in this station and capacity, by her prayers, her conversation, advice, judgment, prudence and example; by which she was a principal medium of the long and happy ex∣istence and union of the society. Her influ∣ence apparently reached to every member, and her steady, prudent zeal and activity, and her amiable character, were very much the means of their continuance and edification. The so∣ciety continued to meet in the room in which she lived, till her bodily infirmities were so in∣creased that she was no longer able to sustain their company, and the exercises of the meet∣ing. They then withdrew into another room in her house, where she was tenderly remem∣bered in their prayers; and she was present in spirit with them, and partook largely with them in their exercises and enjoyments.</P>
<P>MRS. OSBORN was esteemed as an emi∣nently pious, exemplary christian, by all who
<PB N="75" REF="035636_0038_1006142DA8F89DF0"/>
knew her. And even the irreligious and pro∣fane had a degree of veneration for her, as a re∣markably good woman. Few or none have ob∣tained this character more universally than she did, among all sorts of people, who knew her or heard of her: And not many women had a more numerous acquaintance, or more exten∣sive fame. Many educated in her school were afterwards settled in distant parts, and spake in favor of her character and school to their friends and acquaintance. And as she had a great respect for the ministers of the gospel, she corresponded with some of them; and many others visited her, agreeable to her incli∣nation and desire, when they came to Newport, as did many other religious persons. By this, as well as what has been before mentioned, her name and character was spread abroad, as few or none who visited her, went away unimpress∣ed in her favor, as amiable in her conversation and behavior, and eminently pious and benev∣olent. In conversation she appeared remarkab∣ly mild, pleasant and cheerful, and discovered a modest, meek, humble, tender and benevo∣lent mind, impressed with the serious, impor∣tant and pleasing truths and duties of Christian∣ity. The law of kindness was in her tongue to an uncommon degree. She had a strong, habitual aversion to any thing like aspersing the character of others, being careful to speak evil of none; and when occasion offered, was dis∣posed to say all that could be said with truth in favor of the worst. She was often greatly grieved and rendered very uncomfortable, in
<PB N="76" REF="035636_0039_10061430A36518A0"/>
companies where slander and detraction took place, and would endeavor, when there was opportunity, to divert the conversation from topics so disagreeable to her. This part of her character, of which the above is an imperfect sketch, rendered her agreeable, and recom∣mended her to the esteem and affection of all religious persons who were acquainted with her, or heard a true report of her. And this pro∣cured to her the general approbation of all, of every denomination and character, as an emi∣nently good woman.</P>
<P>IN the years 1766, 1767, there was an un∣common attention to religion, which turned the thoughts of many to Mrs. Osborn. They re∣paired to her as a known pious, benevolent christian, to whom they could have easy access, that they might enjoy her counsel and prayers. This was the occasion of numbers resorting to her house. When she saw this, and that the number increased, she was at a great loss what to do. She trembled with fear that if she en∣couraged their meeting at her house, it would be going beyond her sphere, offend some of her christian friends, and give occasion to some not friendly to religion, to speak evil of her and of religion, and so do much more hurt than good. On the other hand, she was afraid to discour∣age them, and refuse to let them come to her and meet at her house, when under apparent concern about their souls, lest, by this, their at∣tention
<PB N="77" REF="035636_0039_10061430A36518A0"/>
and concern should abate and cease. She advised with her christian friends, and some ministers; and upon their advising her to en∣courage them and attend to them, she granted them liberty to come, and appointed particular times for their coming. The poor Blacks ap∣peared more generally concerned and engaged, than others. They agreed to meet at Mrs. Os∣born's on the evening of the Sabbath. She ad∣mitted them, on condition that they should be∣have orderly in coming and retiring, and al∣ways break up seasonably, and that those who were not free should not come without the consent of their masters, and that they should not make any acknowledgment to her by at∣tempting any compensation by presents, or any other way; declaring that she would not re∣ceive any thing of this kind from them. On these conditions they convened in great num∣bers, commonly to the amount of sixty or eighty, and some times more. Mrs. Osborn, finding their attention was so much to her, was greatly cautious, fearing to go beyond her line, as a woman, in endeavoring to promote their instruction and religious impressions for the good of their souls. She used to select passa∣ges of scripture, which she thought would be most useful to them, and from other religious books, and read them to them: And when she had opportunity, she would invite some christ∣ian man to pray with them. She took opportu∣nity to converse with individuals, and some times would give a word of advice to them all.
<PB N="78" REF="035636_0040_100614324E754370"/>
And where she could, she obtained some min∣ister to preach to them, and converse with them; the pastor of the church, to which she belonged, not being able to attend.</P>
<P>These meetings continued a year or more, and were the means of the apparent reformation of many, and of the hopeful conversion of a num∣ber.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among whom were two in particular, who were slaves, but some years after joined to buy a ticket in a lottery, and drew a prize, by which they both obtained their liberty. Their names were BRISTOL YAMMA, and JOHN QUAMINE. As they were men of good natural a∣bilities, and appeared truly pious, and retained the knowledge of the language of the nation from whence they were taken on the gold coast, it was thought proper to attempt to fit them to be missionaries, to en∣deavor to spread the gospel among the heathen Africans, their breth∣ren, for which they appeared greatly desirous. To promote this design a considerable collection of money was made in New England. And the Society in Scotland for propagating christian knowledge, sent mo∣ney over, which was laid out on them to fit them for the proposed mis∣sion. But when they were judged to be fit to enter on the mission, the war between Great Britain and America came on, which put a stop to the design. And before the war was over the latter died; and the former not long after fell into an ill state of health, and died also. John Quamine was brought from Africa when he was a boy. He said his father was one of the chief men at Anamabo, and that he sent him by the captain of a Guineaman to America, to be put to school and instructed in the learning of this country; which the captain engaged to do: But, contrary to his promises, he sold him a slave for life. Af∣ter his freedom was obtained, and he was preparing to go to Africa, a letter was written to a black missionary at Cape Coast Castle, informing him of the proposal of sending him with his companion missionaries to Africa: And relating the substance of the story which John Quamine told of his father, and the reason of his being sent to America; and de∣siring him to make inquity respecting the fact, and inform what he should learn concerning it. The following is an extract of his answer.</P>

<DATE>AUGUST 30, 1773.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>—"It is with great pleasure and satisfaction I acquaint you, that my inquiries after the friends and relations of that gentleman have not been fruitless. The minute account which he has given you of his family and kindred is just: For by inquiring, have found his father's name to be the same as mentioned in your letter; who has been dead many years. His mother's name answers your description; who is still alive; and whom I have had the pleasure of seeing. But the bow∣els of maternal affection, in truth do I declare, appear to yearn and greatly agitate her, with tears of joy, like that of Jacob's, when he heard that his beloved son Joseph was yet alive. The joy it kindled on the occasion, the expectation of seeing once more the fruit of her loins, before she, with her grey hairs go to the grave, fills her with ec∣stasies resembling Jacob's, who in raptures breaks forth, and says, it is enough! My son is yet alive! I hope, through God's blessing to see him before I die. His uncle's name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the same which you me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion. In short, every circumstance agrees with the description given me in your letter. His uncle, or some great personage of his family, who now possesses his father's estate, desires with importunity that I would ear∣nestly petition you, for his returning to his nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e country as soon as possible; and promises that nothing shall be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing conducive to make him, and all about him happy, and live satisfactorily among his own kindred. The family unanimously desire me to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>press to you all the thanks they are able to return for your paternal care and affection ex∣pressed towards him."</P>
<P>It may here be added, that the way to this proposed mission yet lies open, and the importance of it, and the encouragement to it, are as great as ever. All that is wanted is money, exertion, and missionaries to undertake it. There are religious blacks to be found who under∣stand the language of the nations in those parts, who might be im∣proved, if properly encouraged. And if they were brought to em∣brace Christianity, and to be civilized, it would put a stop to the slave trade and render them happy. And it would open a door for a trade which would be for the temporal interest of both Americans and Afri∣cans. As attention to sending the gospel to the heathen appears to be now spreading and increasing in America, it is hoped that the eyes of many will be opened, to see the peculiar obligations they are under to attempt to send the gospel to the Africans, whom we have injured and abused so greatly, even more than any other people under heaven; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the best and the only compensation we can make.</P>

<P>"<HI>Lord's Day evening, Nov.</HI> 23, 1766.—About eighty six below, and fourteen above; an hun∣dred, in all, here this night: The Lord com∣mand a blessing for Christ's sake. O for divine influence! O thou dove of heaven, descend. I am waiting for influence from heaven. Lord, except thou dost take the work into thine own hand, all will come to nothing; the poor impo∣tents will either grow weary of the means, and turn away from them: Or, if they still lie by

the pool, they will grow worse and worse. None can help them in; nor can any one, of himself, obtain healing. O, dear Redeemer, come and make them whole, for thine own honor and glo∣ry's sake; not for mine. If they should all turn back and I should be reproached, What is my name, to thy glory, and their salvation? I would have no self in pleading that thou wilt crown my poor labors with success; but a sin∣gle eye to thy glory. O that thou wilt order every step I take, and guide me by thine eye, and employ me just as thou wilt, only glorify thyself, and still serve thyself of me. Here am I, Lord. Use me as thou wilt; only preserve thine own honor, and it is enough."</P>
<P>"<HI>Monday morning, January</HI> 26, 1767.—It snowed yesterday, and I was not well; yet in the evening I was more strong and lively; and I trust God did help me to converse to the ed∣ification of the poor, dear souls. O Lord, seal instruction. Own thy worthless nothing, and the glory shall be, it <HI>will be,</HI> thine forever. The house was full, no weather stops them. The Lord bless them! Lord, teach me what thou wilt have me to do. Let me be influenced by divine teaching alone, and not by Satan, or in∣dwelling corruption. I want none of their in∣fluence or teaching. Make me quick to dis∣cern what is from thee, and what is not. And O God, I pray thee, make the path of duty straight and plain in this matter: And either spirit me to the work, and enable me to do it judi∣ciously, in such a manner as will stand the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or else to lay it aside, and do nothing at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>Not only Blacks; but numbers of other peo∣ple met at Mrs. Osborn's in this time. A num∣ber of young men used to meet on the same e∣vening with the blacks in a different apart∣ment; for prayer, reading and religious con∣versation. And on Monday evening a number of young women from nine to twenty years old, often above forty or fifty, met together at her house, to enjoy her prayers and instructions. Mrs. Osborn at first was in doubt about the propriety and expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iency of praying with them. But after maturely considering the matter, and seeking direction, she concluded it was her du∣ty, and accordingly practised it, and read to them, and gave them that instruction and ad∣vice, which she thought proper and important. And they appeared so attentive, and at times some of them were so impressed and affected, that she was encouraged to proceed. On Tuesday evening a large number of boys met in her room for a considerable time to receive her instruction and blessing. Wednesday even∣ing was devoted to the stated weekly meeting of the society of women. On Thursday or Saturday, or both, she catechized the children of her school, when a number of children who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id not belong to her school often attended to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceive instruction from her and hear her

prayers. On Friday evening a number of heads of families used to meet at her house for prayer and religious conversation; so that ev∣ery week some hundreds of persons met at her house for religious purposes. This gave con∣stant employ to Mrs. Osborn, and called up her attention, and strong and constant exercises of mind, while she at the same time presided in a large school of children. Some of her ex∣ercises respecting her house being thus crowded with people for religious purposes, were as fol∣lows, taken from her diary:</P>
<P>"<HI>Tuesday morning, January</HI> 27, 1767.—O my Lord and my God, appear for my help now, as thou hast appeared for my help here∣tofore. Fain would I raise a tribute of hum∣ble praise and thanksgiving for thy condescen∣sion and grace to me in the year past; for the Lord himself has vouchsafed to be my protec∣tion from errors and confusions, amidst the throng he has gathered round me. To thee be all the glory forever. In July last the number had amounted to three hundred souls. And now the Lord has increased it to five hundred and twenty five, who have statedly resorted here. And yet no evil has followed, though my fears have often been alarmed, with respect to Lord's day evenings; yet all is quiet, and every company more seriously composed and settled in steadily pursuing after knowledge. Blessed be God, who indulges me with frequent tidings of Blacks and little ones being more concerned, and getting alone to pray. O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord, in his infinite wisdom, will carry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

his own glorious work, in his own gradual way which he has chosen; and confound all the wisdom of the wise. We have been lotting upon great and extraordinary impressions upon souls here, and by great and extraordinary means; but God will take his own way, and use what clay and spittle he pleases to open blind eyes, and cause the walls to fall, by what rams' horns he pleases. Amen. Let the most despicable worm upon earth be employed for God, that the glory may evidently be his own."</P>
<P>"<HI>Tuesday, June</HI> 2, 1767.—Blessed be God, who gave me opportunity to converse with forty two young girls last evening. The Lord seal what was said and read for instruction; and hear my poor cries for converting grace. O have mercy on these souls! Lord, secure them for thine own: O take the prey from the mighty. Snatch them as brands out of the burning, I pray thee. Thanks be to God for the solemnity, assistance and refreshments of the last evening. O help me still to hope in thy mercy, under all discouragements, thou faith∣ful, merciful God."</P>
<P>From the year 1770, to the time of the British taking possession of Newport, the church, both male and female, used to hold their monthly meetings at her house; as this was pe∣culiarly agreeable to her, and she lived in a convenient room.

<P>YESTERDAY very much overcome in God's house, at the solemn ordination of the Rev. Mr. Helyer. My heart was then filled with joy and praises; and God excited and enabled me to breathe out my soul in vehe∣ment cries to him for all needful grace, for his servant, and for his church. Rejoiced much to think I was once more to enjoy the glorious feast, instituted by my dear Redeemer. I longed to render a tribute of praise, and even to be swallowed up with praises all my life long, because God had so graciously given me the desire of my heart. But, alas! how short liv∣ed are my praises. All this day, with bodily indisposition and my own declining heart, I have been as water heated, returning to my former coldness again.

overcome with a sense of the amazing goodness of God to me, in giving me such a dear Pastor, and attempted to adore and praise him with all my powers engaged. This was a sweet sea∣son, for my heart was warmed. I went to the house of God, but was too cool there. In the in∣termission season I trust I was serious, but not lively. But this afternoon, blessed be God, I was filled with joy, grief, love, prayer and praises, God's word being powerfully set home. I was enlarged, in pleading for grace and strength to be bestowed on my dear young Pastor; that, though of himself he is insufficient for his great and difficult work; yet, his suffi∣ciency being of God, he might be made suc∣cessful.</P>

<P><HI>Sabbath noon, July</HI> 15.—Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. I have been to the table of the Lord, and he brought me into his banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. I sat under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. My soul said, It is good for me to be here. I was enabled, with all my powers engaged, to renew my dedication of myself to God, and rejoice in my choice of him. I was, in a measure, brought to behold his glory in the perfections of his nature. I was enabled to wrestle with him for victory over my sins, and to be made more holy. These seemed to be my chief errands; and as I was pleading that promise, "They that have clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger," this promise seemed to be whispered, I will strengthen thee,
<PB N="86" REF="035636_0044_1006143CE70A4B10"/>
I will uphold thee by the right hand of my righteousness; and sin shall not have dominion over thee.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Mrs. Osborn's manner of expression here, and in a number of other places, some may suspect that she thought promises were made to her by some particular, immediate revelation, or divine im∣pulse, by which she was assured that they were then applied to her, which would be a high degree of enthusiasm. The truth appears to be this: She had a fixed belief and confidence, that she was a believer in Jesus Christ, and consequently interested in all the promises con∣tained in the covenant of grace, and in the whole word of God, whether made to the church collectively, or to individuals, as the ser∣vants of God, or christians. Therefore, when her mind was quickened and turned to some promise, or any number of promises in the word of God; and influenced to a strong belief and affecting sense of the good things contained in them, and of the truth, reality, and excel∣lence of them, she considered them as made or belonging to her: And could not THEN doubt of it, as the evidence that she was a real christ∣ian would be clear and irresistible to her own mind, in proportion to her lively view and sense of Christ, and the good things contained in the promises. In this way she considered the promises to be applied to her by the Spirit of God, as he was the author of that spiritual sense and discerning, by which the promises were brought into her view, and she was led with strong faith and affection to embrace them. And this every christian has a warrant to do. See Heb. xiii.5. compared with Josh. i.5.</NOTE></P>
<P>In time of partaking of the element of bread, my heart seemed to be most broken for sin: When feeding upon his broken body, I was filled with astonishment, and made to cry out, "Lord, why me! Why hast thou given thyself for me!" His blood was sweet to me, as it was shed for the remission of sins. At last I broke out in a rapture, "I found the pearl of great∣est price, my heart doth sing for joy." I longed to get still nearer, while I seemed to be resting and leaning on my beloved. Surely I did find him whom my soul loveth. O astonishing, all conquering grace! O happy earnest of more near and intimate communion! O what a feast is this!

Look me into constant and universal obedience to all thy just, holy, good commands. A look will do all this.

Only look, and every grace shall at once, be up and doing, all upon the wing to execute thy commands, and to em∣brace thee.—O my soul, what mean these trembling fears at one time and another, that one or other of thy lusts will prove thy ruin, when only a look of Christ can conquer them all. O look unto him by faith, for all supplies of grace and strength: He will look upon thee and help thee.</P>

<P><HI>Wednesday evening, October</HI> 3.—Blessed be God, I have been kept, for the most part of this week, in a cheerful lively frame, depending on God for every thing needful for soul and body. Yesterday morning, in an especial manner, I had access to the throne of grace, had my mouth filled with arguments, and did, I trust, in the arms of faith and prayer, carry my children to Jesus for spiritual blessings:—Rejoiced in him as a glorious conqueror, as able to subdue the stubbornness of their wills, as a Levi's and mine. O Lord, in mercy overcome them by thy sove∣reign grace. Lord, pity them, and work by whom thou wilt work; send by whom thou wilt send. I will not dare to limit the Holy One of Israel, though I should rejoice if thou wouldest make poor worthless me, an instrument to do them good. But if thou deny me success in conversation, yet, for Jesus' sake, forbid me not to pray, neither let me be straitened in prayer for them; but help me, O my God, to pray earnestly for those who will not yet be persuad∣ed to pray for themselves. O Lord; awaken them, that they may pray also, and do thou hear, not for our sake, but for thine own sake, that the riches of thine own grace may be glo∣rified, admired, and adored, to all eternity.</P>

O my God, my only portion, I protest I renew my choice of thee, and rejoice in it more than in all this world, ten thousand times over. O my God, now for Jesus' sake I be∣seech thee hear the voice of my supplication. Lord, pardon the iniquities of the year past: Forgive me, dear Lord, for all my worldly mindedness, coldness in religious duties, unprof∣itableness under the means of grace, want of love to thee and thy children, want of faith, holy zeal and courage in thy cause, omission of duties, secret, or relative. O Lord, my sins are past finding out; I cannot reckon them up in order unto thee. Lord, pardon mine iniqui∣ties, for they are very great. O, blessed be thy name, there is forgiveness with thee for sins of a crimson die, and she, to whom thou forgav∣est much, loved much. Therefore, O my God, that I may assuredly know that my sins which are many, are forgiven, make me love much. O Lord, blow upon the spark of love in my soul, and make it flame so vehemently, that many waters cannot quench it, neither the floods drown it. Lord, if I love much, I shall obey much, for they who love thee keep thy commandments. O let this grace be in lively exercise all the ensuing year, if I live to see it, and bestow on me all the other graces of thy blessed Spirit, for Jesus' sake. Amen.</P>

for him, Lord, I beseech thee teach me for what and how I ought to pray. O Lord, in the arms of my faith and prayer I would bring this thy dear sick servant to thee, even him whom thou lovest, and beg thou wilt make his bed now. Lord, ease his pain, by darting the beams of thine everlasting love into his soul: Now, now, Lord, let him begin to reap the fruit of all his labors of love: Now let him taste and feel that the Lord is gracious. O now, thou blessed Je∣sus, kiss him with the kisses of thy mouth. O, if it be thy will, let him triumph over the king of terrors. Lord, let his will be swallowed up in thine, and grant that he may bear a testimony for God in his last breaths. Lord, I bless thee, that thou hast scattered his clouds, and that he is panting after thee. O suffer not Satan any more to darken his evidences. Abba, Father, with thee all things are possible.

Now, Lord, thou hast laid thy hand heavily upon me: Thou hast touched me in a tender part: Thou hast cut off a stream, from which much comfort has flowed to my poor soul: Now, my God, appear for me, and refresh my soul with streams more immediately from the fountain. Lord, sanctify thine hand to me, to his dear consort and all relations, to my dear aged Pastor, to the whole Church. O let this awful, dispensation of thy providence awaken secure souls, and quicken the awaken∣ed. O let the fruit of all be to take away sin. Lord, I confess thou might justly deprive me of all precious means: But pity me, dear Lord, and still afford us the means of grace. O give us a Pastor after thine own heart.

Lord help us to bless thee, that thou hast indulged us so long with so em∣inent a man of God, and O, for thy mercy's sake, pardon our iniquities, and go on still to be gracious to us, and give us another Pastor, after thine own heart. Lord, direct thy people in choosing such an one as thou wilt delight to bless, and incline the heart of thy servant to accept the invitation. O keep out all conten∣tion, thou God of peace and love. Unite thy church in peace and concord. O blessed Je∣sus, thou great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, suffer us not to be scattered as sheep without a shepherd. O preserve us from wolves in sheep's clothing. O King Jesus, thou great head of the church, we trust we are a vine of thine own right hand's planting.

forgive me that I have improved his precious counsels and solemn warnings no better. Lord, humble me for this, and at the same time ac∣cept of praises, that thou didst make him so dear and helpful to me. Thou, Lord, knowest how oft thou hast set home thy word, dispensed by him, with power irresistible upon my poor soul, sometimes to arouse, convince and awaken me, sometimes to strengthen and establish my faith, sometimes to encourage me in the way of duty, sometimes to remove doubts and fears. Lord, thou knowest, also, how sweet it was to me to have recourse to him in all times of diffi∣culty and trial, and how ready he was to af∣ford me his counsels. For all these favors, Lord, I would humbly bless and adore thee, thou blessed author and bestower of them: And since thou, in thine all wise providence, hast deprived me of all these former privileges, and I can never more in this world have recourse to thy servant for any solemn counsels, I be∣seech thee, dear Lord, I beseech thee, that I may have more free recourse to thy blessed self.

<P>Mr. Nathaniel Clap was born at Dorchester, near Boston, A. D. 1667. He had his public education <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Harvard College in Cam∣bridge. Began to preach at Newport (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cisland) A. D. 1695, and continued a preacher of the gospel there to A. D. 1720, when he was ordained pastor of the first congregational church in Newport. He died October 30, 1745, in the 78th year of his age. He left no family, having never been married.</P>
<P>He was the father of the congregational interest in Newport. When he first began to preach there, he had but a small number of heare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who had no house for public worship. His congregation soon in∣creased in number and respectability. But he continued there twenty five years before a sufficient number appeared qualified and disposed to unite in forming into a christian church. Yet he lived to see two respectable congregations, which rose from this small beginning, who built two decent houses for public worship, which continue, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> improved to this day.</P>
<P>Mr. Clap was universally respected, as a man of eminent play. Mr. Callender, who preached his funeral sermon, says, "The man stroke in his character, was his EMINENT SANCTITY and PI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TY, and AN ARDENT DESIRE to promote the knowledge and practice of true godliness in others." He was remarkable for taking great pains to get the attention of children and servants; and to instruct them in those things which were suited to promote their salvation.</P>

She tells me, that every approach of death is welcome. There is nothing that she has the least desire to stay to see accomplished, except the settlement of the church, and that she can cheerfully leave with its great Head. She thus addressed herself to me: Dear Mrs. Osborn, as you love me, I entreat you, nay, I charge you, not to be earnest with God for my life. Ask it on no other terms than if it is most consistent with his glory, and his having something for me to do. O pray with submission. O, I long for one christian friend, to unite with me in plead∣ing with God, to take me to himself, that I may be freed from the body of sin and death. And now, my God, I desire to commit the case of this thy dear child to thee. O deal with her as may most consist with thy glory. If thou hast any thing for her to do, that she may still glorify thee on earth, O spare her to a mis∣erable world and to me, that we may still get good by her.

No: God there enlarged my desires af∣ter Christ, and grace. I longed to be made holy, yea, completely so, and for the utter de∣struction of every sin. I dreaded returning to the practice of it, but knew I should if left to myself. I was enabled to fly to that promise which truth itself has made, that he will put his fear into his people's hearts, and they shall not depart from him.

<P><HI>Saturday, August</HI> 31.—I have, through the goodness of my God, this week been kept for the most part, in a thoughtful frame, and at sometimes, I trust, in the lively exercise of grace. At lecture, the Rev. Mr. Vinal treated on the ascension of my glorious Redeemer: And O, if I am indeed risen with him, let me now in good earnest "set my affections on things above, where Christ is." Lord, art thou
<PB N="108" REF="035636_0055_10061456748FC3C8"/>
ascended on high, far above all heavens, exalted at thy Father's right hand, possessed of all the glory and majesty of an infinite God, and dost thou, notwithstanding, condescend to visit so vile and despicable a worm as me, by the in∣fluences of thy blessed Spirit here; and more than this, art thou gone to prepare a place for me, that I may ere long be with thee to behold thy glory? Amazing grace. Infinite stoop! Well, since infinite power is engaged, that same Savior, who, by the virtue and energy of his own Godhead, raised himself from the dead, and ascended up into heaven by his power, to take possession for me, will surely accomplish what is lacking in me, and by the same power carry on the glorious work he has begun in my soul. Amen. So come, Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>I now solemnly renew my choice of thee, in all thy offices, with all thy benefits: Yea I would, by faith, adopt Three glorious Persons, in one eternal Godhead, for mine everlasting portion. O happy portion! Lord, I solemnly declare, I am and will be thine for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Blessed be God, amidst all my dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensions and failings, as to the performance of duties, I have never yet revoked the bargain I made, when I covenanted with God for him to be mine, and I to be his forever. No, no: In this I will rejoice. O may this covenant stand rat∣ified and confirmed in heaven. Lord, by thy grace assisting, I will be for thee, and none other.</P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, September</HI> 3.—I was permitted to go to God's house and table, and there was re∣freshed, first, in hearing the marks and evidences of love to God, as choosing God, in himself, be∣cause of his perfections, for our only portion, above all others: Acquiescing in his adorable sovereignty, in the way of salvation: Loving Christ, as he is the express image of his Father's person, full of grace and truth: Hating sin, as sin, because contrary to God: Love of holi∣ness for itself: Love of the image of God, wherever seen, though in those of other denom∣inations. To every one of these, I think, by the assistance of God's Spirit, I was enabled to an∣swer in the affirmative, having, at the same time, discoveries of the excellency and beauties there are in God, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and renewedly choosing him for my everlast∣ing portion.—At the sacrament, my thirst for higher degrees of grace were increased. O when shall these hungerings be satisfied? I trust ere long they shall, through the intercession of a glorious Mediator.</P>

cause to keep the day in thanksgiving. Blush, my soul, at the backwardness to this duty thou hast experienced! Has God preserv∣ed us in health almost all the year past, so that I never perhaps enjoyed a year of more con∣firmed health in my life, or for twenty years past, and shall I not be thankful for this great mer∣cy? Again, has not God in his Providence pro∣vided for us a comfortable house, while hun∣dreds have been destitute, and knew not where to go? Have we not had a sufficiency of fuel to keep us warm, while many are filled with distressing fears of a hard winter, and can get no wood to burn? Have we not also had, all the year past, a sufficiency of wholesome food to satisfy our craving appetites, while many as good, or better than we, have been pinched with hunger? Have we not also had raiment to put on, that is decent and comfortable, while many others have been clothed with rags, and suffered with cold? How many have been called to part with near and dear relatives, while death has not been permitted to bereave us of any one? And as I have great cause to sing of mercy as to temporals, much more have I as to spirituals. Has not God indulged me with almost constant oppor∣tunities to wait on him in his house, and, blessed be his name, oft met me there, and at his holy table, and many gracious visits condescended to make me, which I had a thousand times forfeited into the hands of his justice? And, notwithstanding a thousand unbelieving fears and distrusts of his grace, he has preserved me from falling into any scandalous sins, to the dishonor of his dear

name. And though I have cause to lament, that I have walked no closer with him, yet have I not abundant reason to be thankful for the precious moments I have enjoyed, for the evi∣dences of grace at sometimes clear, for the hopes of glory, for the dear Mediator's sake, that dear and precious gift? O my soul, be thankful, and again I say, be thankful. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits; who crowneth thee with loving kind∣ness and tender mercies; who healeth thy dis∣eases, who forgiveth thine iniquities, who heal∣eth thy backslidings, and is still thy covenant, faithful God. O inscribe mercy, truth, and faithfulness, on all his dealings with thee, and be forever for him, and none other. Lord, help me, and I will, for I am absolutely thine.</P>

<P><HI>Tuesday evening, December</HI> 31, 1751.—Now, my God, thou hast brought me to the close of another year, I beseech thee freely pardon all the sins of the year past, with all the transgres∣sions of my whole life. Lord, they are more than the hairs of my head in number, and can∣not be reckoned up. They are greatly aggra∣vated. I cannot answer for one of a thousand, no, nor for any one of them. Shouldest thou be strict to mark iniquity, Lord, who could stand I fly to the blood of Jesus: O let that be ap∣plied for my cleansing, and accept me for his sake alone.

And, O gracious God, forbid I should so grieve thy blessed Spirit therein, as in the year past. O let me not backslide from thee; but keep me near; and grant I may indeed sensibly grow in grace, and in the knowledge of my Lord and Savior Je∣sus Christ. Whatever thou deniest me, give me this, and all shall be well.</P>
<P>And O let me be in an actual preparation for death, which may come long before the re∣turn of another year: If so, O let it be a safe and happy messenger.

<P>Lord, I am afraid of this worldly mindedness. I know not where it will end. Oh, I pray thee, subdue it by thy grace, or all my strivings a∣gainst it will be ineffectual. Oh, do I begin to lay up a treasure <HI>here!</HI> then I fear my heart will be here also. Lord, I dread being glued down to the things of time and sense.

How thou art discovering thy∣self, and once more enabling me to draw near, and by faith take a view of thy adorable per∣fections! How beautiful is thy adorable sove∣reignty! How majestic is thy infinite power, that is all sufficient to break down all the walls that Satan and unbelief can raise to separate between thee and me! O how sweet appealing to thy omniscience for my sincerity, notwith∣standing, at the same time, a humbling sense of my own vileness! O how precious a season is this! How lovely, my God, art thou, in thy justice, truth and faithfulness! The same yes∣terday, today, and forever. The God who re∣members the day of my espousals.

<P><HI>November</HI> 16, 1752.—A day of public thanksgiving. O my soul, adore the matchless grace, and adorable sovereignty of God, since thou hast a hope, through grace, that he has en∣abled thee to comply with the terms of salva∣tion. And now reflect, and say if thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast not cause to be thankful for the mercies of the year past. God has preserved thee from falling into any open, scandalous sin, to the dishonor of his dear name. He has also revived thee again, and again, from low, groveling frames; given thee blessed views of his adorable perfec∣tions; especially of his faithfulness in keeping covenant, and ordering all things so, as should tend most to his own glory, and thy best good here: And also comfortable prospects of ap∣proaching death and eternity! O, how often has he met with thee in his sanctuary; and at

his table spoke peace and pardon! O what a God is this! Thus to do, after so many base declensions and aggravated provocations!— Blush, my soul, at thy monstrous ingratitude, and adore him as a God of infinite mercy and faithfulness, who will never, never forsake the soul once espoused to Jesus Christ by faith! Lord, increase my faith.</P>
<P>Again, bless the Lord, O my soul; for he has given thee a good degree of health, the greatest temporal mercy: And likewise pros∣pered the work of our hands, so that we have a comfortable supply of the necessaries of life; and also something to spare, to relieve the af∣flicted. The Lord make me thankful for this, and when at any time things have looked dark, in any respect, O how hath he enabled me to stay myself on him, and rely on his tender care! Surely this is the Lord's doing: May he have all the praise; while I, worthless I, reap the comfort of such a frame. He has not suffered any real afflictions to come near me. Satan has been restrained, and not permitted to dis∣tress and hurry with violent temptations. No deaths of those relatives who are exceeding dear.</P>
<P>O what shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits! O Lord, thou art a liberal giver. Thou upbraidest not. Now, for thy Son's sake, add to all those mercies a spirit of prayer; more sanctifying grace, that I may run the way of thy commands with delight; yield universal obedience. I will rejoice and praise thee: And all the glory shall be thy own.</P>

<P>I DESIRE to record, for God's glory, and for my future encouragement, that God has carried me through the difficulties of my call∣ing the last week, with a considerable degree of composure; and kept my thoughts more fixed on his adorable perfections, than usual: Given access to his throne of grace several times, and filled my mouth with arguments.</P>
<P>This day I have not been able to wait on God in his house: But God has greatly refresh∣ed my soul by discoveries of himself; causing me to rejoice; to admire and adore him, be∣cause he is a Being of such spotless purity and holiness. Yea, because he is just such an one, as he is, altogether excellent, amiable and de∣sirable, for himself; and is his own infinite de∣light, and the delight of angels and saints; and all his laws are holy, just and good.</P>
<P>This discovery made me loathe and abhor myself, because of the shocking contrariety which still remains in my depraved, perverse nature, to the holy law of God; and caused me to justify God, though he should forever withhold that grace he is no way bound to give: But, at the same time encouraged to plead earnestly for it for the dear Redeemer's sake: And to cast myself at the foot of a sove∣reign God, to be disposed of, as shall most con∣sist with his glory, in life and death: That, if I live, I may live to the Lord; and if I die, I may die to the Lord; that whether I live or

And now the treachery of my own heart, and the subtilty of Satan perplex me with fears that I shall abuse the privilege, by misim∣proving it. And sure I am, if God leave me to myself, I shall do so! The Lord enable me strictly to watch over, and be jealous of myself, lest I should deceive myself and others.—But, Lord, I beseech thee, let me not again fall to distrusting thy grace. Truth, Lord, with∣out thee I can do nothing. I am not, of my∣self, sufficient for a good thought. But, through Christ strengthening me, I can do all things. And hast not thou, my covenant God, gra∣ciously promised, that thou wilt not turn away from doing me good?

For any would do, if I only offer up lifeless sacrifices; no matter for such great secrecy.

<P>Now, Lord, may the set time be come, wherein thou wilt favor thy poor, sinful creature with the quickening influences of thy blessed Spirit, and pour out on me a spirit of prayer and supplication, for Jesus' sake, in whose name I ask for all my mercies.

And shall I alone be silent, while the angelic hosts and saints adore! O let me, even me also bear my part.

<P>Lord, forbid I should ever rest satisfied with the bare external performance of duty. No. It is the God of ordinances I want to find.

<P>Lord, this were indeed too great a mercy for such a worthless worm to ask, hadst not thou, for the sake of a glorious Mediator, en∣couraged, yea, commanded me to ask: And hast told me, by his own mouth, "How much more thou wilt give thy Holy Spirit to them who ask him." Yea, this Spirit Christ hath died to purchase. This is the Comforter. This is he who is come to guide his people into all necessary truth; to reduce them, when they wander; to quicken them, when they are dull; to help their infirmities, when they know not what to pray for as they ought: Yea, to make intercession in them, with groanings which can∣not be uttered; and to fill them with all grace and joy in believing.

<P>And O, why am I thus rejoicing in hope of the glory of God, to be revealed to me, in the face of Jesus Christ!

For I utterly disclaim all worth or worthiness in me; yea, I am altogether unworthy of all the mercy and truth thou hast already shown to thine handmaid. It is only because thou wilt have mercy on whom thou wilt have mercy, that, by thy grace, I am what I am.</P>

For thou hast said, For these things thou wilt be in∣quired of, to do them for me.

<P><HI>Tuesday morning, May</HI> 15.—On Saturday evening, Sabbath morning and evening, and yesterday morning, I have been much refresh∣ed in writing on death and judgment. I find, by examination, still good ground to hope, through riches of grace, that the great Judge of quick and dead is, in very deed, my ever∣lasting friend; and therefore never will disown me; never will say, I know you not, depart from me: But, on the contrary, will say, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you before the foundation of the world: For I have paid the ransom for you; I have redeemed you with the price of my precious blood. I effectually called you in time, and enabled you by faith to embrace me, on my own terms. I made you sincere, from the day I called you, though you were then very imperfect.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> was then sanctified but in part. You groaned under a body of sin and death, which caused you to wander from me, wound your own soul, and grieve my blessed Spirit. But I kept thee by the bonds of the everlasting cov∣enant, and by my mighty power, through faith unto salvation. And, for my sake all thy poor imperfect performances, and sincere endeavors to serve me were accepted. I pitied and suc∣cored thee then. I had a feeling of thy infirmi∣ties. I remembered thy frame, that thou
<PB N="124" REF="035636_0063_1006146B78965400"/>
wast but dust. I heard all thy groanings, be∣cause of thy spiritual enemies, thy inbred lusts and corruptions, as well as Satan and the world, which held thee at a distance from me, when thou wast in that vale of tears. I beheld all thy thirstings and longings after me and my grace, universal obedience and perfection in holiness. It was I that excited and strengthened them. I encouraged and strengthened thy faith, when thou didst cleave to me, and would not let me go. I caused thee to delight in me, a∣bove all other objects. I discovered some∣thing of my excellencies to thee then, which caused thee to be enamored with my beauty; but thou sawest only through a glass darkly.</P>
<P>But now, behold, the vail is rent from top to bottom. I will never any more hide my face from thee. Come, all thy desires are fulfilled; all thy imperfections are done away; and, ac∣cording to thy wish, thou art made perfect in holiness. Thou shalt never find any more weariness in my service. And thou mayest now with open face behold me, constantly look on my perfections, see my glory, and the lustre of it shall not confound thee. Come, here is the open vision, the full fruition thou didst long for. Come, drink in as much of God now, as thy finite capacity can hold; and I will still enlarge thy capacity: Thou shalt pass from glo∣ry to glory; and be more and more transform∣ed into the same image. Come, drink and swim, and drink again of those rivers of plea∣sure, which flow from the right hand of God forevermore. Here is the boundless ocean, in
<PB N="125" REF="035636_0063_1006146B78965400"/>
which thou mayest dive throughout the end∣less ages of eternity, and thy delights shall be forever new.</P>
<P>Come, search into the wonders of redeeming love and grace, which has brought so many of the apostate sons and daughters of Adam to glory: And now, in this everlasting <HI>now,</HI> give to God the glory of his sovereign grace. Come, tune thy harp, and sound upon the highest string. Shout aloud for joy; for he has given grace and glory too. Here is no danger of ostentation or spiritual pride; or of grieving any of the inhabitants of this upper world. No, they will all join with thee, and each for him∣self, and on thy behalf, give glory to God, in the highest strains. Didst thou long to be thus employed? Well, go on forever to praise and adore the glorious Three One. Didst thou delight to commune with me in providences, as well as in ordinances? Well, thou mayest now learn the mysteries of them: They shall be unfold∣ed. Unbelief shall no more molest thee. Now thou shalt see how by the watchful eye of my prov∣idence, I preserved thee from every danger. How I swayed the sceptre in righteousness, and caused all things to work together for thy good; even when thou saidst, All these things are against me! I never took my eye from thee; nor turned away from doing thee good. Now, thou mayest adore forever, on this account al∣so; and see what thou didst, when thou didst commit all thy concerns to me, for time and eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="035636_0064_1006146E32F82050"/>Didst thou delight in the company and com∣munion of my ambassadors, and dear children? Did they appear the most lovely and agreeable of all the inhabitants of the lower world? Es∣pecially, when thou didst discern, through their imperfections, as the sun through a cloud, my image, drawn in an eminent degree upon their souls. Didst thou love them for my sake, where∣ever thou sawest them? Were they, in thy es∣teem, indeed the excellent of the earth? Well, here thou shalt forever enjoy the communion of saints: These shall be thy companions for∣ever. All their imperfections, as well as thine, are done away. They are now perfect, and shall never ensnare thee, as even <HI>they</HI> were wont to do. They shall never turn off thy eyes from me. No, not the brightest seraph in all the heavenly regions, shall ever be able to do it: Nor all the glittering robes of glorified saints and angels. But thou shalt enjoy me in all these. I will forever feast thy soul with communications from myself. And if I, who am God allsufficient, can make thee happy, thou shalt be so; for I will be thy portion to eternity.</P>
<P>And didst thou in time, by faith, commit the keeping of thy soul and body into my merciful and faithful hands, against this great day? I ex∣cited and enabled thee to do it: And now thou seest the effect. Thy expectations from me, shall never be disappointed; neither shalt thou ever be ashamed of thy hope. I kept thee by my power, while on earth. I kept thee in the hour of death, when Satan would gladly have
<PB N="127" REF="035636_0064_1006146E32F82050"/>
hurled thy soul into the infernal regions; but he could not pluck thee out of my hands. I sent thy guardian angels to conduct thy pre∣cious soul to Abraham's bosom. And I still took care of thy mouldering dust, while in the grave; not an atom of it is lost. And now, be∣hold! I have raised it a glorious body, fashion∣ed like my own. And now the union between soul and body shall never be dissolved; but the dear partner shall forever reap together, as they sowed together. Behold, according to thy faith and hope, I now present them spotless and blameless before the throne of God. I have redeemed them by my blood. By my obedience and death I have satisfied justice, and have purchased reconciliation with God. Mercy and truth have met together; righteous∣ness and peace have kissed each other. I have washed away all thy pollutions. And now, I give thee joy; and all the host of heaven give thee joy; therefore enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. I gave thee joy in the day of thy espousals, and in frequent after manifestations, as an earnest of this. Thou hast had a taste of the same in kind, when I revealed myself to thee on earth; but the degree shall now be greater than thou couldest then ask or think.</P>

<P><HI>Sabbath evening, May</HI> 20.—In the week past I have had my thoughts much employed in meditating on death, judgment and eternity. Sometimes I have seemed so swallowed up in them, that I hardly knew how to descend to earth again.—Well, my soul, thou hast had a rich feast now! Perhaps, a taste to strengthen
<PB N="128" REF="035636_0065_1006146FECF46C40"/>
thy faith to thy journey's end. Be exceeding thankful for such views of unseen and eternal things. Keep the eye of faith still fixed upon them, and run with patience the race set before thee; looking and longing for the glorious ap∣pearance of the great God, even our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And now, in a special manner, watch and pray, lest thou enter into temptation. And remember, it is by grace thou standest. O, be not high minded, but fear before a holy and sin hating God; for the glorious things thou hast seen, by an eye of faith, are not yet accomplished. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God, and stedfastly believe that in his own time, all these things will be revealed; and therefore march forward in his strength towards the joyful period.</P>
<P>But take heed of boasting, as though thou hadst already put off the harness; for perhaps thou mayest be but girding it on. Thou art yet in thy enemies' country. Snares await thee on every side. Thou art not out of the reach of spiritual pride, or vain glory: Nor out of the reach of unbelief, which may yet raise many black clouds, before thou reach the blissful re∣gions. Nor hast thou yet got clear of sloth and carnal security. Nay, all the lusts of the flesh, which now seem to be in some good degree conquered, may yet rise up against thee. There may yet be sore conflicts in this field of battle: And though they shall not finally overcome, they may sadly wound thee, and dishonor God. Again, my soul, thou art not yet out of the reach of Satan, who has often desired to have
<PB N="129" REF="035636_0065_1006146FECF46C40"/>
thee, that he might sift thee as wheat. Many a fiery dart may he yet throw at thee, many griev∣ous injections: For though the house is built upon the rock Christ Jesus; and therefore shall not fall: Yet the rain may descend, the floods come, the winds blow, and beat upon it; and thou hast no reason to expect any other.</P>
<P>Therefore, I say again, watch and pray, lest thou enter into temptation. And beware lest self confidence should betray thee; or any of the troubles or amusements of a vain world. O take heed of hewing out any more broken cisterns; for they can hold no water. Not all the creatures upon earth, nor all created things, can ever yield thee, my soul, that satisfaction thou hast already found in God, that spring and fountain of all felicity. Therefore turn not to the creature; but maintain thy resolution to remain comfortless, except he comfort thee with communications from himself. Let nothing less satisfy thee. Thou wast made to glorify and enjoy him even here. Thou art not obliged to wait till death has done its work: No, even now thou mayest anticipate that joy, if thou art not wanting to thyself.</P>
<P>And I charge thee, my soul, harbor no dis∣trusts of his grace. Remember this has been thy prevailing infirmity. Therefore watch a∣gainst this thy own iniquity. It is said of Christ; that he did not many mighty works, in his own country, <HI>because of their unbelief.</HI> Let this therefore be laid aside; and let faith be daily upon the scout, sending it forth continually to Christ for fresh supplies of grace and strength,
<PB N="130" REF="035636_0066_100614718C563018"/>
and all shall be well. For he is the head of all gracious influences. He has an immense stock to give out, an inexhaustible fulness for his poor, needy creatures. And who can tell but he may have yet far greater degrees of grace to bestow on thee? Even strengthening, quickening and sanctifying grace; for he is thy sanctification as well as redemption. Who can tell but I shall be much more conformed to his blessed image, even here? Though perfection in holiness is not to be obtained in this life; yet grace is absolutely free and sovereign. Some have been made eminent patterns of pie∣ty, though in themselves unworthy, as well as I. Some lights have so shined, that others seeing their good works, have glorified their Father who is in heaven. O my God, unworthy wretch as I am, yet glorify thyself in me also. O, fashion me after my great pattern: Make me holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.</P>

Must he be forgotten; faith's mouth be stopped; and all because nothing more has befallen thee, than what thou hast had all thy days?

And how many thousand times hath he leaped over these mountains of thy sins and infirmities, and come to thee and embraced thee. These did not keep him out at first. No, he was gracious, because he would be gracious then. He freely loved thee; and whom he loves, he loves to the end. Is God deceived in me? Is he a man, that he should lie; or the son of man, that he should repent? Did he not know, even from eternity, just what I should be in time? Surely he did. And yet determined to be gracious to me.

<P><HI>September</HI> 15, <HI>Sabbath morning.</HI>— As I awoke today I was refreshed by these words, "This is the day the Lord hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it." And these, "O that I knew where I might find him! That I might

come even to his seat! I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments." —In reading Rom. vii. also, the Spirit of God bore witness with my spirit, that it is my daily experience that I do delight in the law of God, after the inward man. Notwithstanding the law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</P>
<P>Grace was for a few minutes drawn forth into sensible, lively exercise; and I appeared to myself as a vessel which had been wind bound, and could by no means get forward, while wind and tide were against it. But, now, as there seemed to be a favorable gale, determined to weigh anchor, hoist sail, ply my work, and make all speed towards the desired haven.—</P>
<P>But, alas! ere I could get to my closet, to pour out my soul to God there, I seemed be∣calmed again. May I improve every breeze of the Spirit, since, as the wind he bloweth when and where he listeth. The Lord make me thankful, that I have not been all the days of my life left destitute of his operations.</P>
<P>This evening refreshed and strengthened by the dear Mediator's prayer, John xvii. whom the Father heareth always; Yea, and he will fulfil his request, though I cannot pray as I ought. O my soul, believe and be comforted; for he will keep thee from the evil. He will sanctify thee through the truth. He will main∣tain the union between his blessed self, and thee. He will ere long take thee to himself, to

behold his glory. Amen, blessed Jesus; for I am thine own forever.</P>

<P><HI>December</HI> 25.—Very stormy this morning. Thunder, lightning, wind, rain, and hail. O blessed be God for Jesus Christ, that sure refuge from every storm. O may every one, who this day pretends to celebrate his birth, with praise, make their flight to him by faith, and find shelter under the shadow of his wings, that they may be secured, not only from temporal troub∣les, but from the storm of vengeance, which hangs over a guilty world.

O let not this place be as Chorazin and Bethsaida, but Lord have mercy on us, and turn us to thyself. Turn us from the error of our ways, from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. Lord, pity us a sinful people, laden with sins. Truly our iniquities cry aloud for vengeance; but O pour out thy Spirit, and not thy fury. Lord, what profit is there in our blood? O magnify the riches of thy sovereign grace, by turning this people to thyself. O, wilt thou not get to thyself a great name? Surely thou wilt. The glory will be all thine own. This people is noted for vileness. O may thy power ap∣pear. True, O Lord, thou standest in no need of us, nor can our conversion add to thine es∣sential glory; but to thy declarative glory it will.

<P>O BLESSED be God who has brought me to see the close of the last, and the beginning of this new year in peace. O my soul, how great has the mercy of thy God been to thee, the year past. How has he fed, clothed, and comforted thee with his bounty, given thee a good degree of health and strength, and caused every thing, in his providence, to work for thine advantage. Surely, truth and faithfulness have been written on all his dealings with thee. He has blessed thee also in spiritual regards; has granted thee more frequent access to his throne, than in years past, and has proved himself a God hearing prayer. He has quickened, and

encouraged, and strengthened thee in his way; and though thou hast yet reason to be humbled before a holy God, because thou art no more conformed to his lovely image, yet thou ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t reason to rejoice that he is daily carrying on his own glorious work in thee, in opposition to all thine inbred lusts and corruptions, the world and the Devil; and he will perfect the same, for he is a faithful, omnipotent God. O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y soul, stand amazed at the goodness that has re∣covered thee from backslidings. O, wherefore is it, that the backslider is not filled with her own ways? Why has not God long ago said, Let her alone? Why am I not, from a backslider in religion, now become an apostate? O, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is it that my God has again condescended to return to me, and admit me to draw near to him? yea even took me into his arms, and laid me in his bosom, there to rest my weary head! O my soul, if there be the least spark of grati∣tude in thee, now be faithful to thy God, who has thus remembered the day of thine espousals, and would not let thee go, notwithstanding all thy provocations, thine unfaithful dealings with him. O lie in the dust, and adore the faithful∣ness of a covenant keeping God, who has said, he will never leave thee nor forsake thee. O amazing grace! Astonishing love! O Lord, who am I, that thou art still mindful of me, and that thou hast brought me hitherto? O let my soul be strengthened. Since Omnipotence and Faithfulness have taken me into his hands he will not let me go. O my God, bind me ten thousand times faster to thyself than ever.

From this day forward, let me be for thee and none else. O why should any other object have any part of my time, strength, talents, or thoughts, since all are thine? yea, the whole heart is thine. Lord, in the presence of thy holy Angels I solemnly renew the dedication of it to thee. O possessit more than ever. It is thine own. And let me possess my own God more than ever. Lord, whom have I in heaven but thee? And thou, who knowest all things, know∣est that there is nothing on earth I desire in comparison, or competition with thee. O, therefore, whether I live or die this year, let me enjoy thee, and all is well. Lord, I ask nothing else: This is all my salvation, and will be all my joy. If I may but possess and glorify thee, all shall be well. Keep me upon earth, or take me to Heaven: Do with me as seemeth thee good: Only glorify thyself, and let me have my chosen portion.

Lord, restrain Satan, or he will be as a roaring lion. Help me to overcome the world, or that will be too hard for me. O my Savior, thou hast bid me be of good cheer, since thou hast overcome the world. Lord, stand by and strengthen me, and then I will be of good cheer; for I know with thee all things are possible. Though I am weakness, thou art strength. O let me daily see thee, by an eye of faith, and clasp thee in the arms of faith, and all shall be well: I will not fear either earth, or hell. O manifest thy∣self to me, as thou dost not to the world. O let me enjoy thee, my life, my light, my love▪ Let me lie on thy breast, or lie at thy feet con∣tinually.

What though my sins are of a scarlet and crimson die, what though they have ten thousand ag∣gravations, is not the blood of Christ sufficient? Surely it is. O apply it, for thy name's sake, not only to free me from the guilt and punish∣ment of sin, but from its pollution also. O blessed Jesus thou didst die to save thy people <HI>from</HI> their sins, not <HI>in</HI> them. O save me, even me, unworthy as I am, from mine.

These words, also, of Esther, "I and my maids will fast also, and so will I go in to the King." And blessed be God, he has supported and strengthened me almost to the close of the day, and I humbly hope has enabled me to keep such a fast as he has chosen. Surely God has assisted me in confession of sins, both mine own, and those of our nation, and in my cries for pardon and strength, to mortify, and finally overcome, both in his house, and in secret, and in renewing my cries for holiness, even an entire conformity to his image. God has assisted me, also, in the work of self examination, and shone in on the evidences of grace in my soul, assisted me in reading, in renewing solemn covenant engage∣ments. The Lord, He is God. The Lord Jehovah is my God, and I am his forever.

Rejoiced that God had enabled me to yield active obe∣dience before, saw that I was then called to passive obedience, and when God might give case hoped to return to active again. And blessed be God, he has enabled me so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o do with vigor. A precious refreshing season at the throne of grace today: A sweet calm ever since. The business of the day pleasant. Have enjoyed God in all. O my soul, be thankful, and press forward. Let nothing discourage thee, for thou hast to do with a compassionate, faithful God, who will secure his own honor, and order all things well for thee, who art his forever, for Jesus' sake.</P>

and his churches, that his own glory might be advanced. Enabled to leave all e∣vents with him, and determined to acquiesce in his will, whatever it might be, by the assist∣ance of his Spirit and grace. The wisdom of God appeared lovely, which orders all things well; yea, and it is infinite. O may I ever submit to it, and to adorable sovereignty. Lord take from me every degree of resistance, all stubbornness, sourness, all pride and opinion of mine own knowledge. Let me have no choice in any event or affair but what is first thine. O that my will were wholly subject, that it might forever harmonize with the divine will. O that there might never be another jarring note, no discord, but that God might be forever glo∣rified in and by me, as by the angels in heaven. Father, thy will be done. Amen: Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</P>

<P><HI>May</HI> 1.—A golden season at the throne of grace, after I wrote yesterday. The Lord make me thankful. A view by faith of the in∣finite wisdom, mighty power, absolute sovereign∣ty, and astonishing condescension of the glori∣ous and faithful Jehovah. Had some sweet thoughts on the nature of true friendship: Pleaded that with Abraham of old I might ap∣prove myself his faithful friend, by universally obeying his will; espousing his cause against all that oppose it; adorning the profession I have made by an holy life. Here faith fixed on the power of God, to subdue every rebel in me, and rejoicing because he can with infinite ease speak me into holiness. It is but to say, I

will; be thou cleansed: I will; be thou holy: I will; be thou strong, and very courageous, and it shall be. I shall hold on my way, renew my strength, and mount up towards heaven, for Christ will keep the precious soul committed to his charge, the purchase of his precious blood. Here with joy I again committed it into his faithful hands, and triumphed in him as my strong refuge, my rock, my high tower and sure defence, and have ever since had sweet peace. Those words have been lovely to me, "Great peace have they, who love thy law, and nothing shall offend them." And these, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee."</P>
<P>Enlarged also in request for ministers and christians, that God may be glorified in them: And I trust God will grant my requests, for he brought me into his banqueting house, and I trust did hold out the golden sceptre, and ena∣ble me to draw nigh, and touch the top: His banner over me was love, and he will grant me all that consists with his glory, and I want no more.

<P><HI>Monday, May</HI> 5.—When I wrote last evening, I seemed only rationally convinced that things were well with me, but did not find the lively exercise of holy joy till I came to pray. Then I had a precious season, a distinct view of my ignorance of God, his perfections, and of all divine things: I appeared as a beast before him. A precious view of Christ, in his pro∣phetic office, renewed my choice of him: In
<PB N="162" REF="035636_0082_1006149865F479F8"/>
this pleaded my great need of divine teaching; believed he would teach me by his blessed Spirit, and lead me into all necessary truth. Rejoiced in him, as the great and only teacher come from heaven. Had also an humbling sense of the universal depravity of my nature. The direct contrariety to a holy God, and the stub∣bornness of my perverse will, my unbelief, pride, sloth, hypocrisy of my heart, how awfully guilty, how deeply polluted. This I bewailed, and that I have been a transgressor from the womb; an ungrateful abuser of divine mercy. But Christ Jesus appeared so glorious and lovely in his priestly office, that my soul was transported with joy: His obedience and his blood; his glorious resurrection and session at his Father's right hand; his being touched with the feeling of my infirmities. My soul flew to him, and embraced him, as my great High Priest, my great Advocate in the court of heaven: Plead∣ed for justification, a free and full pardon, for his sake alone. A view still of the great power and tyranny of sin, Satan and the world, to draw off my heart from God. Renewed my choice of Christ, as my absolute sovereign, my Prince, as well as Savior: Committed my precious soul again into his merciful and faithful hands. Yea, and he will keep, by his mighty power, what I have committed to him, for he is a glo∣rious King, and he is my God and King, and I will, by his grace, be his loyal subject forever.</P>

of choice and surrenders of soul. The Lord make me thankful.</P>
<P>Yesterday morning more confused, and so have been ever since, by a serious caution given by a christian friend, by which I was convinced I had been betrayed into too rash a censure of another's failings. O will God forgive me, and forbid I should ever indulge a censorious spir∣it. Lord, let me not be unmerciful to the failings of others, while I have the feeds of ev∣ery abomination in me, and it is owing to sove∣reign grace alone, that I have not fallen into every thing that is dreadful. O my soul, be humble. Who hath made thee to differ, or what hast thou, which thou hast not received? —O that God would humble me, and conquer this pride and arrogance in me. O hateful sin. I abhor myself for it. O wash it away in the precious blood of my dear Redeemer.</P>
<P>Blessed be God, after I wrote this morning he poured on me the humbling influences of his blessed Spirit in prayer, for the pride of my heart. I was ashamed to look up, because so unholy, so unlike my great Pattern. I loathed and abhored myself, and have ever since car∣ried self abhorrence about me. Blessed be God, for the reproof given by his servant, and applied by his blessed Spirit. The Lord bless his servant, and make him more and more faithful. O enrich his precious soul daily, with more of the graces of thy Blessed Spirit, that thou mayest be glorified in him here and to all eternity.</P>

<P>O my God, I have lately seen what the ago∣nies of death mean. A shocking sight, indeed, while the poor unprepared soul shrinks back and would lodge in its crazy cottage! But go it must, and appear before God. I had a deep sense of things, while with my dying neighbor, and God enabled me to send up strong cries to him for the poor soul.

Whether in weal, or woe, God knows: I determine not. But this I know, that the will of a just and sovereign God is done, and he is glorified, yea and will be glorified: And may his will be forever done, whatever becomes of his enemies. In their misery, strictly speaking, I do not rejoice; but in God's being glorified I do, and will rejoice.

O grace! O Truth and Faithfulness! Surely there is no god like my God, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin; yea, crimson and scarlet sins, big with the greatest ingratitude. O blush and be astonished ye heavens over my head, thou earth under my feet: For I have sinned against that light and endearing love, that many thousands now in hell never did: And yet O how does that precious blood plead for me! O how does it cleanse, pardon and sanctify. How does it overflow and cover the huge rocks and mountains sin has raised in my soul, and tri∣umphs over all, and will speak peace and par∣don: Will bring home the guilty runaway to her God and Father, and cause him to be rec∣onciled and smile again.

He knows I choose any or all the afflictions in this world, rather than be at a distance from him, or suffered to sin against him. He knows I want to serve

God knows that, for his glory, I want as high degrees of grace as can consist with a mortal state: And he knows also, that all my desires are of his exciting, for I am not sufficient for one of myself. And why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance and my God. If, for a small moments, he hide his face, he will return. O my soul, submint. Do not murmur, but trust in God; for he is the faithful and unchangeable Jehovah: And he will have compassion on thee still, because he will have compassion.

Come, thou art mighty strong and courageous when embarrassments are at a distance. Now, where is thy faith? Now God, in a gentle manner, puts thee upon trial, do not draw back or fear, but cast all thy care on him, for he careth for thee. Thou art of more worth than many sparrows, art better than the ravens, yea the very hairs of thy head are all numbered. God as always appeared, and he will appear for thee.

<P><HI>November</HI> 18.—The night past, God has ful∣filled my desire, that if in my day there should be an earthquake, I might be sensible of it.— Being awaked this night, among other thoughts, part of an hymn came into my mind with de∣light.</P>
<Q><L>Wake now, my soul, and humbly hear,</L>

<P>See how his sweet and tender care complies with our weak minds! Presently I heard a noise and felt a shaking, which I soon perceived to be an earthquake. My soul darted up to God, in ejaculation, that he would sanctify this shock, for the awakening and quickening of his people, and also for preservation. In the height of the shaking, God graciously, by his Spirit, gave me this cordial from his word, "For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be remov∣ed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be re∣moved, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note, page 86.</NOTE> Lord, what a pledge was this!

Why, Lord, why was I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trembling and dismayed, before thee, because of my great, my heinous sins, my aggravated, God provoking sins, sins of a crimson die, sins of which even devils were never guilty!</P>

Lord Jesus, in thee I stand complete God can be just, and yet the justifier of her who believes in Jesus. Lord, let me renew my strength. Now sanctify me throughout, in soul, in spirit, in body.

<P><HI>February</HI> 6.—I have been perplexed in my mind, and vexed with myself on account of a strong expression in conversation with a partic∣ular friend. We were both speaking of what we experienced of the goodness of God to us, I trust with a view to his glory: He said he had a refreshing season that morning, &amp;c. I an∣swered, so had I, and added, I had a large draught at the fountain. He modestly replied, I dare not say so, I had a sip, a taste, &amp;c. The Lord in mercy grant me prudence, and teach me how to speak with proper strength of expression, that I may neither withhold the truth to his dishonor, nor offend the ears of any friend, by expressing myself in too high terms. But now, let me see, my soul, on what did I ground this ex∣pression? What did I experience that morn∣ing?
<PB N="181" REF="035636_0091_100614AD2008F168"/>
Truly it is not easy to tell what, but this I know, God by his Spirit sweetly applied that gracious invitation, "If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink," then my thoughts im∣mediately turned upon the object, I was in∣vited to, and that was Christ; next, what was the drink I should partake of; here the foun∣tain opened! I should drink of his communi∣cable perfections, he is a fountain of all grace, I might drink in faith, drink in holiness, drink in love, drink in humility, patience, yea every grace; drink in conformity to his image in ev∣ery part, knowledge, courage, prudence, wis∣dom, joy, delight, yea strong consolation.</P>
<P>My thirst increased, and grew more vehe∣ment. God did open my mouth wide, and <HI>he</HI> did fill it. My soul was held up by the power of God, as the needle by the loadstone, and I did by faith, with joy draw water out of these wells of salvation. I drank and was satisfied from the fulness of my unchangeable God, who has loved me with an everlasting love, and with loving kindness has drawn me. I hated sin bit∣terly, and myself for it. I renewedly chose my dear invaluable portion, my pearl of great price; my soul exulted, gloried, triumphed in her choice, and determined never to let him go, whom my soul loved! I gave up my all again, and again, into his merciful and faithful hands, and I am his own; he will keep what I committed to him, and I will cling to him and rejoice in him, for he is truth, and faithfulness in the abstract, yea, he is altogether lovely!</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="035636_0092_100614AED91FC340"/>And, although I had but a sip, in compari∣son with what he is in himself, and with my wants, yet, I had such a draught, as crowns and kingdoms could neither purchase for, nor from me.</P>
<Q><L>Had I the world at my command,</L>
<L>And the more boundless sea,</L>
<L>For one blest hour at thy right hand,</L>
<L>I'd give them both away!</L></Q>
<P>Surely the consolations of God, at this sea∣son, were neither small nor few. My soul was filled as with marrow and fatness, and such a peace lasted all the day, as the world can nei∣ther give, nor take away.</P>
<P>O how good, how gracious is God to me, an unworthy wretch! O, when shall I awake in his likeness, then I shall be eternally satisfied, then shall I shout forth the riches of redeeming love and grace, without fear of this hateful pride! Till then, may God guide me by his unerring Spirit, and prudent counsel, and or∣dain to himself praise, out of the mouth of such a babe, for Jesus' sake.</P>

And since my soul is redeemed by precious blood, it is a precious soul.

Though I was unworthy of the least spark of grace, yet I pleaded, for Christ's sake, I might have large draughts from the full, overflowing fountain; clear evidences of my union to him. I had strong consolation from gracious promises. Matthew v.vi. Isaiah liv. and others. Likewise from God's eternal de∣crees. For whom he did foreknow, he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son. As many as were ordained to eter∣nal life believed. These were chosen before the foundation of the world, through sanctifica∣tion of the Spirit and belief of the truth. This is the will of God, even your sanctification.
<PB N="193" REF="035636_0097_100614BB003B4F98"/>
Also the mediatorial prayer of Christ: Sanctify them through thy truth. From the purchase, Redeemer's blood: He died to purchase to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. That hereby God would be glorified, if I bear much fruit. O, what shall hinder? All power is in his hands! Had an affecting sense of these things all the former part of the day.</P>
<P>But this afternoon in a restless frame. Could not converse, or fix on any thing, though with dear christian friends. Discontented and gloomy. Surely, this is the body. O, blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e God, that Christ Jesus is the same, as at the beginning! With him there is no variableness, nor shadow of turning. Though my frames vary, He is the same, yesterday, today, and for∣ever, and will accomplish the thing which he pleaseth. He will conduct me through all these vicissitudes, and bring me at last to behold his glory, for I am his own forever.</P>

<P>My bodily disorders have followed me more violently since Thursday, than before. Was very ill all Friday night, yesterday and last night; but blessed be God, not comfortless; no, adored be his name, very far from that, especially last night, when I began to cherish a hope, that this sickness would be unto death. O joyful prospect of eter∣nity, while well assured that I have reposed my trust in a glorious all sufficient savior. I know on whom I have believed, and can gladly venture through the dark valley of the shadow of death, and fear no evil, for God is with me, Christ with me. I have fled to him for refuge, and he will keep me.</P>
<P>My affections are very strong toward my dear consort, my honored aged mother, my dear christian friends, from whom, under God, I have received so much comfort. My heart was raised in thankfulness to God for all the comfort, and refreshment he hath bestowed, on his poor, weary, unworthy worm, in her tire∣some pilgrimage, and for all the dear privileges, with which he hath indulged me; for ministers, especially my dear pastor; for his written word, precious promises, sabbaths, sacraments, and all sanctuary enjoyments; these were all dear, all precious; but I could gladly resign them all, for full enjoyment of my precious Christ; can cheerfully commit my dear consort, mother, and dear friends, into the merciful and faithful hands of God, relying on his care and gra∣cious

<P>Having taken my farewell of things dear be∣low, I seemed to be looking and longing for the joyful period. But, O, if it be the sove∣reign pleasure of my gracious God, to say, Re∣turn, I submit. His will be done on earth, as it is in heaven! It is meet such a worm should, with patience, wait his time, if he hath any thing for me to do, or suffer. If he will give me grace, if he will sanctify me more, give me more holiness, that I may glorify him upon earth, all is well. But I cannot think of re∣maining here, so unlike to God. Lord, sanctify me more, for Jesus' sake alone.</P>

<P><HI>Sabbath evening, November</HI> 14.—Blessed, for∣ever blessed be my gracious God, for he is good, and his mercy endureth forever. Yes∣terday, and Friday evening also, God took me near to himself in meditation, prayer, and ex∣amination; this morning also; and adored be his name, he keeps me in his fear, all the day long, habitually so. Blessed be his infinite wis∣dom, love and faithfulness, for all the dispensa∣tions of his providence; that he by his mercies hath led me to repentance; not only so, but hath used the rod, to reduce my wandering soul; breaking off my dependence on crea∣tures, weaning my affections from things below, that they may be more steadily fixed on himself, and on his Christ, his spirit and grace, that these may be all in all to my soul. What wise and blessed steps hath he taken, though once afflic∣tive. When in my young and tender years, my heart was much set on the husband of my youth, he rent him from me, and likewise be∣reaved me of almost all that was dear to me according to the flesh, whereby he broke off my dependence on those streams for comfort, and led me to the fountain. O, "happy rod, that brought me nearer to my God." He hath abundantly made up to me, in himself, and in his Christ, the loss of all these. But, alas, still the world, its pleasures, profits and cares, threatened to engross and entangle my affec∣tions.
<PB N="197" REF="035636_0099_100614C03AF2A320"/>
Infinite wisdom saw this, and therefore d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed all my schemes, disappointed all my hopes and expectations, from friends and means, though, blessed be his name, he did not leave me wholly destitute. By this, through his grace, he brought me to cast my care on himself, and rely more immediately on his providence, to provide for me, and mine, ever since. And here I have lived secure and at rest, amidst many ups and downs, frowns and flatteries from creatures. The less Reason hath had to work upon, the more freely Faith hath cast itself upon the faithfulness of God; and here my expectations have never been disappointed. God hath comforted me, when creatures failed, and proved vanity and vexation of spirit.</P>
<P>But still my foolish heart must needs seek something below; to go out freely after, and hath been exceedingly attached to Christian friends. And here, because I hoped I loved for Jesus' sake, I have indulged excess; here have my affections twined; these have been as the apple of my eye, or even as my own soul! In these have I rejoiced; from these, my expectations of future comforts have been raised. I was ready to say, Surely <HI>these</HI> will not fail; but rather than my dependence should be placed on these, and they prove rivals in my heart, God will embitter them, every one, at some time or other, even to the breaking of my very heart; I shall find a sore thorn under every one of these sweetest roses upon earth.</P>
<P>And now, blessed be God, I am more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver convinced, that all things under the sun,
<PB N="198" REF="035636_0100_100614C218272E88"/>
are vanity, and nothing but God alone a sub∣stantial good. Adored be thy name, O my God, for every twig of thy rod. Help me now to cease from man, whose breath is in his nos∣trils. Now let me be effectually weaned from all the world, and all my hopes, expectations, desires, love, delight and joys, terminate in thee. Yea, let me forever be for thee, and for none other! Lord, thou hast won my heart, take it to thyself, fill it with thy grace, and possess it to eternity. Go on, I beseech thee, to rend away every rival. I stand divested of all the world; give it to whom thou pleasest; give me my chosen portion, thyself, thy spirit, and thy grace, and I have enough. Here I am, do with me what seemeth thee good.</P>

Lord, I lament all the ungrateful returns I have made thee. O wash away all my sins, in the precious blood of Christ; and although I am an unprofitable servant, still look upon me with complacency, behold me not in my sins, but accept of me for Christ's sake. I fly to his righteousness—I have none of my own—this will stand the scrutiny of impartial justice; it is without a spot, without a flaw.

I was much affected with the natural hardness of the heart, and love of worldly things: That when Christ had wrought so great a miracle as to cast out a legion of devils, from the possessed man, a whole city should go out and desire him to de∣part out of their coasts, because they had lost their filthy swine. I was enabled to give the blessed Jesus, a solemn and hearty invitation in∣to my soul, protesting, in his presence, that if he will come and take up his abode with me, I will gladly give up all this world for this enjoy∣ment. I will be content, and rejoice in him, though he strip me of every thing dear to me, here below. I saw my absolute need of him, in all his offices; pleaded that he would exe∣cute them all, and subdue me to himself. Casting my care on him, willing to wait his time, by prayer, I made known my request to him; asked for a temporal mercy in subordina∣tion to his glory; believed he would grant it, which he did in less than two hours after! So quick did God answer faith and prayer, for Christ's sake. Had sweet peace in believing, and am thine, sweet Jesus, forever!</P>

<P><HI>Wednesday morning, May</HI> 25.—O, truth and faithfulness, that doth never, never fail me! Let me adore, and, with joy and gratitude, look over the mercies which now surround me; for God hath dispersed every cloud that hung over me; he has provided a horse and money, and every thing necessary, at the moment they are wanted to prepare for our journey. By extreme weakness of body, the path of duty is made quite plain about going, since I am not able to attend to my business. All is well. God will be with us in our journey, guide and protect us, and, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is most for his glory, return us in safety.

If this be his will, a hearty farewell to my dear Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hel, my minister, my Susa, my other christ∣ian friends.

Lord, I am thine, wholly thine; it is enough. Hold me in life, or take me to thyself; do with me what thou pleasest, only glorify thyself, and keep me from the evil.

<P><HI>Saturday morning, June</HI> 11.—O Lord, how many, and how great are my defects in every duty. How short do I fall in every prayer I ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, of the fervor and enlargement that wants require; especially for sinners, for saints in general, for ministers, for magistrates, for our fleets and armies, for those who are suffering under the rage and power of antichrist. Other christians join in concerts for prayer, for the outpouring of the spirit; but I lay still, as if I had neither part or lot in the matter▪ O, will God keep me, if I live to see the time, to join with thy dear ministers and people, to plead that the Spirit may be poured out from on high, and let us all, with our prayers, be ac∣cepted in the beloved. And, O let me every day be mindful of these things, when I come before thee, to ask mercy for myself. O, let me not forget dear friends, my mother, com∣panion, and those committed to my charge. Let me not forget the poor and needy, the fatherless and widow, the afflicted and tempt∣ed soul. Lord, grant me bowels of compas∣sion, let me consider myself, only as a mem∣ber of the glorious body of which my precious Christ is head, and let me seek the prosperity of the whole. O, let thy kingdom come, and thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Teach me to pray for rains, and sunshines, that the earth may yield her increase. Thou hast bidden me be careful for nothing; yet thou hast added, in every thing, by prayer and sup∣plication, with thanksgiving, let your re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uests be made known unto God. O, let me not be

Enter not into judgment with me, for the sins of holy things. I fly to the perfect obedience, and precious blood of my dear Redeemer. He obeyed, till justice can ask no more; yet, let me yield a uniform obedience, that thou mayest be glorified.</P>

by a greedy wolf, eager to tear in pieces, and swallow up quick: A bear, bereaved of her whelps, espies and pursues the same prey, and resolves, if possible, to possess and destroy it. A roaring lion, also, no less greedy, seeks to devour. They all pursue: And what can the poor creature do! It is helpless. Any one of these, should they overtake, would destroy in a moment. Would even a silly sheep go to meet these enemies, or stand still? No, its fears would almost give it wings. How swift would it run to some shelter, to its shepherd! And would its shepherd stand and look on, see it in this distress, and not screen it? Would he give it up to those devourers, when it is his particu∣lar business to guard it from them; it is com∣mitted to his care, he is called its keeper? No, no.</P>
<P>Neither will my glorious Shepherd give me up to sin, which like a ravenous wolf, is ever seeking to tear my soul in pieces. Nor shall the world, greedy as a bear, swallow me up.

<P><HI>Tuesday evening, March</HI> 4.—The last day of my forty sixth year is now run out, a little more than twenty three of which I have openly pro∣fessed Christ. But oh! how little have I lived to his glory. I would be humbled that I have made no greater proficiency in the school of Christ in twenty three years; and also that the half of my life was, as it were, without God in the world. I would also lament before God all my backslidings from him; and that to this day there are such bitter remains of contrariety to him: So much of pride, passion, unbelief, sloth, worldly mindedness, and what not!</P>
<P>But, O my soul, let not thy lamentations end in ingratitude; but bless God for all recoveries from declensions; for all the victories thy glo∣rious King has given thee over the world, the flesh and the devil. That amidst such an ocean of corruptions, such a flood of temptations, the spark of grace is yet alive. That God has, not∣withstanding all my fears, preserved me from all open violations of his law, which would have been to the dishonor of his dear name. God knows my fears and dread of this. Adored be his name, that for his own sake he has hitherto delivered me from all my fears. Where is the fury of the oppressor, who has often appeared as if ready to destroy? But hitherto the Lord has helped me. And I will rejoice and bless him, that by his grace I am what I am; though
<PB N="245" REF="035636_0123_100614F394338DF8"/>
I am not what I long to be; yet I will hope in his mercy, that his grace shall be sufficient for me; and he will complete his begun work in my soul. He will not leave it unfinished: Nei∣ther earth, sin, nor hell shall prevail against me. My jewel, my all, is in safe hands, even in the faithful hands of a glorious Christ. And though my sins of heart, and all my sins, are against him; yet his precious blood cleanses from all sin. To that I fly this night for pardon and cleansing.</P>
<P>Lord, my days are now far advanced. For∣ty six years passed and gone, never to be re∣called. O let the remaining be devoted to thee. Blessed be thy name, it cannot be long before I reach my eternal home. O, help me to work while the day lasts, to fulfil as an hire∣ling my day. All thy works praise thee, and thy saints bless thee. Let me also, who am the work of thy hands, bear my part in this lower world. Thy saints may profit by it. O, let me not be an idle spectator, but an active doer of thy will: And cheerfully suffer and submit to all thy will; and cleave to thee, and speak honorably of thee to all around me, un∣der every dispensation of thy providence, whether merciful or afflictive. I would renew my thanks to God this night, for the mercies of the year past, spiritual and temporal. Thou hast by thy almighty power bowed my will, and brought me to cast my care on thee for daily bread: And thou hast provided it con∣tinually; I have lacked nothing. Lord, still help me to trust in thee, and confide in thy faithfulness for all supplies of grace as well as of
<PB N="246" REF="035636_0124_100614F73965D518"/>
food; for thou wilt not give me a stone in this respect, any more than in the other. Thou knowest I have cried more for grace, than for daily bread; and thou wilt answer, because I am Christ's, and Christ is thine, and I am thine forever.</P>

O no! thou knowest thou hast espoused me to thyself. Thou hast ingrafted me into thyself, by regeneration and adoption. O then, let me not be a fruitless branch; nor suffer me to bring forth sour, bitter, or tasteless fruit. O, if the tree has been made good, let the fruit be good also.

O ye glorious angels, and perfected spirits, who can glorify your God without any of these sinful mixtures; if possible, exert your∣selves yet more.

Lord, help, and lay no more on me, than thou wilt enable me with grace and patience to bear, to thy glory. O grant me so much business— so much sickness—so much health—so much poverty, and so much prosperity, as will bring me nearest to thyself, and most advance thy declarative glory; and no more of either; Lord, no more of any thing, than thou wilt sanctify, I beg for Jesus' sake: For, except thou sanctify, business will hurry, fatigue, fret, and carry off my heart from God.—Sickness will clog, and utterly unfit for duty, secret and so∣cial;
<PB N="249" REF="035636_0125_100614F8CCD5FED8"/>
and nothing will be attended to but an impatient complaining of aches, and weakness; an impatient, Jonah like spirit, wishing rather to die than live.—Health will be wantonly spent in the delights of sense: I shall sacrileg∣iously waste that precious enjoyment, and rove from God among the creatures. Ah woful de∣pravity! Ah bitter remains of enmity and con∣trariety to God, that will abuse every mercy! —Poverty, unsanctified, will make me mur∣mur and complain, and care, and cark, and quarrel with the dispensations of thy allwise providence. Oh, cutting thought! Thou know∣est I shall murmur in my tent, and distrust thee in every thing, and impudently charge God foolishly; and hang down my hands, and unbe∣lievingly cry, It will never be better than now! I shall bury all my mercies. They will be all lost in vile ingratitude; and I shall dis∣honor God all the day long. Oh, can I bear it! Lord, canst thou, wilt thou bear it! For Jesus' sake forbid.—Prosperity will puff me up. Pride will rear up its venomous head; and I shall be glued to this world, and take up contentment in it, instead of laying up all my good in God.</P>
<P>But, Lord, sanctify, and all these shall work together for good, and bring me nearer thyself. For business, I will rejoice and bless thee; dil∣igently attend, and rely on thee for a blessing, strength and success.—In sickness, I will sub∣mit, and kiss the dear hand which strikes the blow. I will lie down and adore and praise, and cry, Thy will be done, when I cannot

I can do all things, Christ strengthen∣ing me.—In poverty, I will trust thee, and cling to thee, and rejoice in thee as my only portion. Yea, though thou slay me, I will trust in thee. I will acknowledge the least morsel of good to be more than I deserve.—And in prosperity, my heart shall be lifted up in the way of the Lord.</P>
<P>Therefore, O my covenant God, sanctify all to me, and do with me what pleaseth thee. I have no choice to make but that by which thou wilt be most glorified. Lord, any thing, only possess my whole soul, suffer no rivals, and it is enough. O keep me from the evil; for I am thine, forever thine.

O glori∣ous, incomprehensible Trinity, glorify thyself in me, for thy own name's sake; because the world believes thou art my God; and therefore expects I will behave accordingly. O help me

<P>And let all thy dear children share with me in this happy, this glorious privilege of glorify∣ing God. O let us join heart and hand. O unite us in the sacred work. Let a sacred glow of love and gratitude to God and each other ever inspire our breasts. Let the world know the difference between those who have been with Jesus, and those who have not, by our love and delight in each other, as well as love and delight in God. O let Zion prosper. Let the Redeemer's kingdom thrive and flour∣ish through all the world. My heart shall re∣joice, even mine. Amen. Halelujah; it shall in those latter days. Truth has said it. The crown shall flourish on his royal head, and his saints shall shout aloud for joy. Amen.</P>

<P>O LORD, who can stand before thy cold! O pity the poor and needy: Provide for them out of thine infinite stores. Spirit those on whom thou hast bestowed this world's good to relieve their wants; as thou dost spirit such to relieve the wants of thy poor, unworthy crea∣ture; for which I bless thee; and pray thee to reward my benefactors. I trust they do indeed give for Jesus' sake. O let them not lose a re∣ward of grace. Of thy free, rich grace, Lord, reward them. And as it is thy sovereign pleas∣ure, that my circumstances call me rather to

receive than give, I would cheerfully submit, and believe it is best of all. Lord, any thing, any circumstance in life thou seest best; so thou wilt but make me strong in faith, lead me to, and hold me near thyself, and all is well. If my hands may not relieve the poor, pour out on me a Spirit of prayer for them. O per∣mit me to bring them to thee in the arms of faith and prayer, to thy full stores, day by day, that <HI>these</HI> their wants may be supplied.</P>
<P>And yet, as opportunities offer, and God gives leave, let me cheerfully cast in my mites for their support. O never let me be unmind∣ful of the poor, the sick and languishing, the prisoner and captive, the aged, and the tempted soul. O my God, since thou hast done so great things for me, I pray thee, fill me with bowels of compassion, and let the widow and fatherless still be the objects of my tender concern and care. And may my zeal for the support of thy gospel never die. Let me still cheerfully do all I can: And when I can do no more, Lord, help me to pray continually that thy gospel may be supported, and for the prosperity of Zion; and, O God, hear and answer for Jesus' sake.</P>
<P>Let God glorify himself; and let him do as seemeth good to him. I have no other choice to make this new year, but that God may be glorified in me and mine, and all affairs and things. And yet, while I am thus anxiously careful for nothing, I would daily, in every thing, by prayer and thanksgiving make known my requests to God. I would pray more than ever, from the exalted views, and earnest long∣ings

that God may be glorified. O, are not these motives as strong to make me thirst and long and wrestle, as anxious, distressing cares? O God, let me not be freed from them in vain; but now may I get up and run with more vigor and cheerfulness than ever the ways of thy commandments, rejoicing in God, and in all the great and glorious events of his providence.</P>

<P><HI>Saturday morning, January</HI> 17.—Forever blessed be God, for all that sweet content and acquiescence in the divine disposals which I feel from day to day. This is the Lord's do∣ing. I am sure it is. It is God who has heard prayer for Jesus' sake, and has commanded de∣liverance from the tormenting sins of unbelief, distrusts, anxious cares, and murmurings. O, for this, glory shall redound to Father, Son and Holy Ghost; for I could no more attain this frame, than I could get a kingdom by my own strength. Blessed be God, I had rather have the victory over my inbred lusts, and be wholly subdued to the royal sceptre and will of King Jesus, than possess crowns and kingdoms.</P>

<P><HI>Friday morning, February</HI> 13.—I was called by providence yesterday to see this sick man, who in all probability is at the point of death, and in most terrible agonies, bemoaning his past life, and crying for mercy. I, said he, was conceived in sin, and brought forth in iniquity. I have been inclined to sin from a child. I have feared neither God, nor man, nor any thing else.—I, who have been brought up in a christian land, am ignorant of the way of salva∣tion.— I have had Eternity, Eternity, Eter∣nity, sounded in my ears; but I put far away the evil day. And now I am launching into a boundless Eternity, and know not where I am going! Mercy, Mercy, Lord.—Oh, this would make the stoutest heart to shudder, said he. Oh, could I but have seen all this before, as I have just now had a glimpse of my eter∣nal damnation! Wringing his hands, he cried, Oh, how shall I appear before a holy, sin hating
<PB N="267" REF="035636_0134_1006150EB33F7220"/>
God, who will search me to the quick, even all the secrets of my soul!—One speaking to him of Jesus. O Jesus! said he, how sweet is that word Jesus! But my sins are of a scarlet die. Mercy, Lord; mercy in and through Jesus Christ. I have not one word to plead in my own behalf; but Mercy, Lord! A rela∣tion coming in, he said to him, O—I am gasp∣ing for breath, can but just catch it. O, do not let sinners laugh you out of your religion. If you do, you will repent of it, when it is too late, &amp;c. He earnestly asked the prayers of all around him, and thanked all for any advice, or pains they had taken with him.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="entry">
<P><HI>Saturday morning, February</HI> 14.—I went again, as soon as I was up yesterday morning, wanting still to know more of the dealings of God with the precious soul of this sick, distress∣ed man. After some conversation with him, he said to me, I think I do loath sin. I do abhor it, because contrary to a holy God. I said—And do you not then see a beauty in holiness, and love it for its own sake? Ah! said he, That I have to look for yet; I cannot answer you there. He was much weaker, and could talk but very little all the day and evening.</P>

<P><HI>Thursday morning, February</HI> 19.—Yesterday I was comfortable some part of the day, and came through the whole as well as usual.—In the evening serious and engaged when telling my friends of the society, when met, of the dealings of God with the soul of Mr. —. And when I came to pray for him, my whole soul was engaged! He appeared to me, as in∣deed
<PB N="268" REF="035636_0135_100615104140E858"/>
he was, hovering just on the brink of E∣ternity, and ready to launch into it in a mo∣ment. And God gave me a deep sense of the worth of his precious soul; of his utter inability to help himself.—Of his utter unworthiness to receive mercy, and mine, or ours, earnestly to apply to the throne of grace in his behalf: But pleaded encouragements from our being jointly engaged for mercy for him, and I trust we really were so throughout the room. I bless God, who gave such a number of us op∣portunity to unite, and implore mercy for him, and commit him into the hands of a glorious Christ, to be clothed with the all glorious and spotless robe of his righteousness; in which he might lift up his head before strict and impar∣tial justice, before the bar of a holy God. I could heartily plead the glory of God in the salvation of this soul; and had a lively view of the joy in heaven in the presence of the blessed angels over this sinner repenting and arriving there. And I humbly trust my sensible view both of the worth of his soul—his undone state without Christ—his unworthiness to re∣ceive, or mine to implore mercy—the ful∣ness and sufficiency of Christ for him, as well as for Jerusalem sinners who had imbrued their hands in his own precious blood—and the glory that would redound to God, both in heaven and on earth, in the salvation of this soul—was from God; that those discoveries were from him, and the desires were excited by his own Spirit. It was he who emboldened me, who am but dust and ashes, thus to draw near,
<PB N="269" REF="035636_0135_100615104140E858"/>
and plead with a righteous God. And I will hope he has answered the desires of his own ex∣citing.</P>
<P>It was between seven and eight o'clock when we were thus united at the throne of grace, more than ten in number. And a little before nine dear Susa (Miss Anthony) was our mouth, and spread his case again before God with earnestness and importunity.—And before we broke up we heard the bell toll for his death. And I believe it was Satan who suggested to me, that my desires were not excited by the Spirit of God; for he was not then the subject of prayer; and therefore my prayer was lost; for God never assisted any to pray for the dead.—It gave my spirits a considerable damp: For I verily thought that God by his Spirit had held me up to wrestle with him, and given me such boldness and freedom of access; and even strong confidence that God would hear and an∣swer for Christ's sake. And if he was dead at that very time, I knew not what to make of it! Still I could not help thinking God was with me of a truth in that prayer. I therefore went down to the house, and inquired, at what time he died? And his sister told me, Just at nine. —And God did help me: And he shall have all the glory, while I rejoice in hope that he is glorified in heaven, for the salvation of that soul.—And now, my God, lay me in the dust. —And comfort the near and dear relations, and all to whom he was dear. And sanctify it to all this town, and to all who may hear of it.</P>

<P><HI>Friday morning, April</HI> 17.—Eleven of our society spent the afternoon here yesterday. I, made a short attempt to pray. And for a few minutes had freedom, while breathing after perfection of holiness, and a freedom from every clog and interruption to my communion with, and enjoyment of my God. Some long∣ings that the body might be laid to rest, and sleep it out in the grave, while I, free from all sin, sickness or weariness, shall worship, enjoy and adore, as glorified saints and angels do. However, here I submitted to the divine will, and turned my plea for greater degrees of grace and strength for us all, that God might be glorified by us. These desires, I trust, were excited by God's own Spirit, and shall be heard and answered, though I was not able to persist. "Think not that ye shall be heard for your much speaking," said my dearest Lord. O, let me not limit God, and confine the blessing to long prayers; nor yet form excuses for short formal prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="035636_0136_10061511DC8842A0"/>Thanks be to God who did assist — to plead and wrestle with importunity. She, as the im∣portunate widow, followed God with plea upon plea, in the Mediator's name. She asked in faith and hope. Her petitions and confessions and pleadings, as well as thanksgivings, were, I trust, all excited by the blessed Spirit. And God will delight to answer. I often think of what I heard Mr. Byram say of Mr. Brainerd, when he was telling of his wrestling in prayer in the wilderness for the conversion of the In∣dians. "I verily thought," said he, "that the dear man would have died upon the spot."— So it often seems as if she would breathe out her soul in prayer. The Lord be praised! O, assist her still more and more. Would to God all his children were such wrestling Jacobs.— And now, my God, into thy merciful and faith∣ful hands I commit my soul, my body and all my concerns this day. Pardon my sin, and as∣sist me for Jesus' sake; for I am thy own forever.</P>

<P><HI>Monday morning, October</HI> 12.— Lord, make me truly thankful. Yesterday was a good day. God did solemnize my spirit when in public worship, in prayer and in preaching, and sing∣ing too. An excellent sermon was delivered from Matthew xxviii. 18. "And Jesus came and spake unto them saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." Blessed Je∣sus, what a sweet discovery was this to thy poor disciples, when they were worshipping thee; but some doubting; a discovery of thy glorious power to forgive all manner of sin and blasphe∣mies;
<PB N="272" REF="035636_0137_1006151362F5EBB0"/>
to vanquish Satan; subdue our lusts, though ever so numerous and strong; to strengthen the believer though ever so weak; to enable to overcome the world, in all its cares, pleasures, vanities and frowns; to resist Satan in all his wiles and stratagems; yea, and overcome him too; yea, to overcome every e∣vil that can beset us in our way. O Lord Je∣sus, then fear flees before us, however weak in ourselves, and of ourselves can do nothing, yet then are we strong.—O for greater discoveries of this glorious attribute to both saints and sin∣ners. Saints shall stand up and rejoice, grow strong and adore, because greater is he who is for them, than all who are against them; and none can pluck them out of his hand, or over∣throw his work in their souls. O discover more and more of thy glorious power, blessed Jesus, to me. And let every dear child of thine share with me. O, rejoice the whole body of thy militant church, since thy power is not limited. No; all power is given unto thee, in heaven and in earth. O let our souls ex∣ult and triumph in our almighty Redeemer; and in all our future straits, let the eye of our faith be unto thee. When we know not what to do, nor how to go forth against this great multitude. O then discover to us that all power is given unto thee both in heaven, and in earth.</P>
<P>O reviving truth! Christ will accomplish all that concerns us, since all power is in his hands. O what a dear Redeemer is this! How mighty to save! Who is this! who comes trav∣elling

in the greatness of his strength! Who is this! who for a little time was made lower than the angels for us; but is now exalted far above all principalities and powers. O let christians rejoice in, and sinners tremble before, this ex∣alted Redeemer, this King of glory; and all bow to the sceptre of his grace; and not pro∣voke him to crush with his iron rod. Lord, take hold of sinner's hearts. Now show forth, and make thy power known, now they are grown stark mad in sin. Now, Lord, speak with the power of a God, and stop them in their mad career. Thou shalt have all the glory. Thy name shall be magnified and adored. An∣gels shall rejoice; yes, there shall be joy in heaven, if thou wilt take to thyself thy great power and reign.</P>

O my God, suffer me not to cut any duties short, through inclina∣tion to, or delight in the things of this world, rather than in closet duties. Neither suffer me for a pretence to make long prayers, or think I shall be heard for much speaking, when the ne∣cessities of my family, and affairs for its support call me for the present to attend.

<P><HI>Sabbath morning, October</HI> 18.—Several christ∣ian friends visited me yesterday afternoon. And I was engaged in talking about the vices of the times, and the need there is of wise virgins awaking, trimming their lamps, girding up their loins, now it is midnight, and preparing to meet our glorious Lord. And in hopes of refreshing my friends, I read some of my own writings.— But I am since perplexed. O my everlasting safeguard, I fly to thee for pardon of every de∣gree of self love, pride, vain glory, ostentation, or self seeking. O my glorious God, thou knowest how secretly these sins will twist and wind in, when I most desire to glorify thee. Lord, save me! I hate these sins. O let them not prevail against me, now I would be all for thee, and none other. O for humility now. Glorious Lord, give me such a sight of my own vileness, as shall keep me low in my own eyes. O let me not become all a censurer abroad; crying out, of the vices of the times; calling to all to see my zeal for the Lord of hosts: And neglect that corrupt, that bitter fountain that is within

me, which is perpetually turning me aside. O humility, Lord; humility, for Christ's sake. Not only a crying out against sin; but an inward, utter abhorrence and loathing of it, and myself for it.—But oh, not discouragement. Lord, guard me here. This will weaken my hands. There is forgiveness with thee; that thou mayest be feared. Dear Jesus, since all power is given to thee, in heaven and in earth, keep me in the strait path. Let me not turn to the right hand, or left. Keep me by thy almighty power, through faith unto salvation. And let me not grieve thy holy Spirit. My soul is committed to thy care: Lord, keep it from the evil. I cannot, O, <HI>I cannot.</HI> Sin will be too hard for me. If I turn not after Absalom, I shall after Adonijah, except thy grace prevent: It is by that alone I shall stand; let me not be high minded, but fear. Lord, I fly to thee. Behold thy babe, thy weakling, and defend me from all the assaults of sin and Satan; and glo∣rify thyself in me. Dear Lord, do use me in thy own way; in my proper station, in the place where God has set me, let me glorify thee. Let me never move above my sphere, nor yet slothfully hide my Lord's talent in a napkin; but occupy till thou come. O let me gain more, be faithful in a little.

<P>Now let me frequently appear among the Lord's people. Now others are crowding to∣gether, running all risques to attend the devil's entertainments, let love to Jesus Christ and each other, excite us to meet and visit each other. Let us who fear the Lord, speak often one to another; and in all humility give him the glory of his sovereign graces; declare what he has done and is doing for our souls. Let us show forth his faithfulness, and encourage each other to put our trust in him; for he is a faithful God, and none ever trusted in him, and was put to shame. O may the whole of our conversation be to speak honorably of God, exalt God and Christ, and the operations of his blessed Spirit, and grace; and lay self in the dust. O let self be debased.

O let us build upon the dear, the sure foundation, Christ Jesus, all the good works we can do. Let the words of Christ, "In as much as ye did it unto them, ye did it unto me," be as oil to our wheels, to make them run swiftly.</P>
<P>O may God reward every kind benefactor he has raised to me in every time of distress. May they never lose their reward, though they did it to one of the least of thine. Let them hear thee say, dear Lord, to their precious souls, even here, "Inasmuch as ye did it, ye did it unto me." O reward them a thousand fold into their own bosoms. And may gratitude ever glow in my breast to God and to them. And as I have freely received, in times of my dis∣tress, so let me freely give, as God enables, and occasion offers. Lord, ever open my hand and heart to the sick, poor and needy; and make me a blessing in my day. O, make me extensively useful, in my family, in my school, in the dear, dear society, and to all around me. O, let the Lord God Almighty delight to own me, to use me, to set me apart for himself, in secret, in private, and in every way my proper

O Lord, determine me, as will be most for thy glory. If I draw, for Christ's sake, direct the arrows, cause them so to stick, that the wounds may never be skinned over till they are cleansed and healed by the application of the precious blood of Jesus Christ. O let me never be influenced by pride to do what does not become me. But enable me to take the advantage of all the favor thou hast given me, in the eyes of the great ones here. How know I but it was for this very end thou hast done it? Perhaps it was for such a day as this; and can I altogether hold my peace, and be guiltless! O God, direct and succeed my at∣tempts to glorify thee, and do good to precious souls. For thine own honor's sake appear for me; be on my side, while I am attempting to shew myself on thy side.

<P><HI>Thursday, December</HI> 3.—<HI>Thanksgiving day.</HI>— I have been reviewing the particular difficul∣ties I recorded last year in the Fall, which seemed then to lie before me: And now would record, with a heart glowing with gratitude, that God has brought me cheerfully through them all.—Perhaps I never knew a year of fewer straits, or carking cares. Is not God, a God hearing prayer? He is: I am sure <HI>he is.</HI> Is he not a God of infinite faithfulness, love, tender compassion, truth, kindness, benevolence, and absolute sovereignty? <HI>He is.</HI> Have I de∣served any of this kindness at his gracious and holy hands? No, I have not. I am sure I have not. He is self moved, and his kindness does not depart from me. And in spite of all my foes, he is spreading my table, and carry∣ing on his own work in my soul. O, let my soul triumph in my glorious Redeemer today, for his redeeming love to me, and all his; for his covenant faithfulness, in all the dispensa∣tions

<P>Lord, fill the hearts of all thy children with humble praise this day; and smell a sweet savor for Christ's sake. And let us gather strength today to glorify thee all our days. O, let us begin the work of heaven this day; and be made more like the inhabitants there.</P>

<P><HI>Thursday morning, December</HI> 31.—Now God has graciously brought me to the last day of the year. And how great has been his mercy to me this year! I am still, through his grace, a living monument of his mercy, and a witness of his truth and faithfulness. He by his grace enabled me in the beginning of this year to commit all my affairs into his wise and faithful hands. And he has, blessed be his name, kept me almost throughout the year cheerfully leaving my affairs with him. I have lived securely on the wisdom and care of my heavenly Father. And he has done all things well. He has fed me and mine to the full; and comfortably cloth∣ed us too. I have not known either pinch∣ing wants, or carking cares. I have been en∣abled to make satisfactory payments to those with whom I have had dealings; and to do something towards the support of the gospel, and relief of the necessitous: And in this God has given me the desires of my heart. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.</P>
<P>O my God, accept my thanksgivings for Jesus' sake: And for his sake alone freely par∣don

all my sins, whereby I have abused all these mercies. O send not leanness into my soul, I beseech thee; nor suffer unbelief to a∣rise, and suspect thee. Draw forth faith into exercise, Lord, and help me to believe now for grace to walk uprightly, as well as for tempo∣rals. O, may my firm trust and confidence be fixed on God the ensuing year; yea, all of it, if I may live to see it. O God, let my will be swallowed up in thine all my remaining days. Thou good and gracious God, thou kind ben∣efactor, thou dear Savior, and thou blessed comforter, let the time past suffice that I have grieved thee: Yea, more than suffice; let it break my very heart, that I have done so. Oh, I would bewail it before God, with deep hu∣mility and tears of contrition. And now, O Lord, sanctify me throughout. Now conform me to thine image. Now let me be for thee, and none other, all my remaining days.</P>
<P>And may I, in the diligent use of all ap∣pointed means, in the path of universal obedi∣ence to all thy dear commands, confidently re∣ly, wholly and alone, on my dear, dear Re∣deemer's perfect righteousness for all accept∣ance with God. O, in this let me rejoice, having no confidence in the flesh: In this let me lift up my head. And do thou, my God, smile upon me; yea, delight in base, vile, un∣worthy, ungrateful me. And I will run the ways of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart; for I am thine forever.</P>

<HEAD><HI>New Year's day.</HI>—<DATE><HI>January</HI> 1, 1762.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE first duty I seem to be called to this year, is resignation to the divine will; for the pain and confusion of my head is such, that I seem altogether unfit for active obedience. Well, it is the Lord; let him do with me, what seemeth him good. I am sure I had better submit, and take all well from his hands, than to struggle. He stands in no need of me: And when active obedience is most pleasing to him, he will spirit me to yield it. I would humbly beg for myself, this new year's day, a stronger faith and a resigned will; that I may acquiesce in all the will of God, without exception in the ensuing year. Methinks I have no choice of circumstances to make, let them be what they will, merciful, or afflictive; only that God will glorify himself in all, resign me to his will in all. Lord, it is not a careless insensibility I am asking; but real strong faith and a childlike submission, and rejoicing in the will of my heavenly Father. Nor would I choose even this (though the most delightful, happy frame on this side heaven) merely from selfish views; but that God may be glorified hereby. I would not ask it, if inconsistent with the glory of God. But O my God, will not this be for thy glory? Then for Christ's sake grant it, this new year's day. Give me this new year's gift, that shall last all the year, if I live; even a strong faith, working by love, and influencing to universal obedience, and entire submission to all the will of God. Let it be what it will, I would object
<PB N="284" REF="035636_0143_10061522A7CED390"/>
against nothing at all, neither life, nor death, sickness, or poverty, or reproach. I would have no name, or any interest, or comfort this year, but what is most for the glory of God. I would, this day, give up myself, my whole in∣terest, my all, to be disposed of as he pleases.</P>

God graciously indulged our endeavors, and favored our designs of setting apart yester∣day for solemn fasting; and spirited all that could attend to come. Twenty of the society were together. God mercifully assisted in prayer. We prayed together seven times. Thanks be to God, we were not left to be dull, dry, confused, and wandering. No. God did pour out a spirit of humiliation, and a spirit of supplication, and helped our infirmities. And now, my glorious God, give us faith to look out for answers of peace for Jesus Christ's sake alone, and not for any thing we ever have done, or can do. O, be with us this year! Now, my God, accept my sincere desires to be devoted to thy service.

<P><HI>Wednesday morning, January</HI> 27. —It is with peculiar pleasure I now reflect on the exercises of my soul in the beginning of the year 1760. when almost all my plea was, that God would choose all my changes. O, what have I got by referring my choice to God! How wisely has he chose every thing for me! How worthy is he to be trusted! And when, in the beginning
<PB N="287" REF="035636_0144_100615255FAD0DF8"/>
of last year, he enabled me to give up all that was dear to me, what advantage has he ta∣ken of my solemn surrenders? Verily, though he has a right to all my comforts, to take them all away just when he pleases, whether I resign or not, yet he has spared them all, and added to the number; and given me the sweet of them, as he daily gives me to see all flowing from his bountiful hand; that dear, that faithful hand, that will give me nothing to hurt me; from that infinite wisdom that knows infallibly what is best for me; from that love, truth and faithfulness that has said, All things shall work together for the good of those who love God, of whom I trust I am one.</P>
<P>And now, my soul, in time of prosperity re∣joice in God. Now let him have all thy love, all thy warm affections. Set them not on the creature comforts he has preserved and bestow∣ed. No, no! Now may God be all in all. And since he has so graciously answered my choice and resignation, and thus filled faith's mouth with blessings; now, my soul, open thy mouth wide, and cling to thy faithful God, that his grace may be sufficient for thee, for the present day, and for every day, and for every change God shall see best for me; and for my great and last change.</P>
<P>My soul, think not to build thy nest in the lap of prosperity. This is not thy rest. Sit not down so content, as to make this thy home. Bless God for these refreshments in the inn; but remember thou art a pilgrim and a stranger.

Ah! gladly would I leave all my enjoyments below, to be freed from <HI>these.</HI>—But I resign.—Thy time is the best. My God, still choose all my chang∣es. Infinite wisdom cannot err. Only grace sufficient for me during my abode here, Lord, and it is enough. And thou wilt give grace as well as glory. It is enough! Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief. I believe thou art a∣ble, blessed Jesus, to do this for me. And since thou hast said, My grace <HI>is</HI> sufficient for thee, I will humbly hope.

And I will as cheerfully get up and work and run, when he shall restore bodily strength, and enlarge my heart.</P>

Nothing more than I will give strength of body, and grace sufficient to perform. My bur∣den is light. I do not bind heavy burdens up∣on you. No; I bear your burdens, I feel your griefs and infirmities. Only rely on me, submit to my will, and all shall be well. Wait in a way of believing patiently for me, and I will return and help thee. I will strengthen thee. I will uphold thee. Make no impatient complaints, as though I were cruel, and expect to reap where I have not sown. Do not repre∣sent me, as expecting ten talents in return, if I commit but two. No; be diligent when able, be submissive when disabled, depending on me alone for all assistance and acceptance; and my yoke shall never gall thee, nor my burden press thee down.

The Lord sanctify it to my aged mother, and to me; and enable us to follow him, who, through faith and pa∣tience, is gone to inherit the promises. Thanks be to God, for his distinguishing grace to him; and that thou didst make him so rich a blessing to thy church, and continue him so long a faithful laborer in thy vineyard. Thanks be to God for the success thou didst grant him; for the seals of his ministry; that thou didst not suffer him to toil all the night, and catch noth∣ing.
<PB N="290" REF="035636_0146_10061529906386B0"/>
Or if he did, yet when at thy command he let down the gospel net again, he caught many, both in Hereford, and at London too.</P>
<P>Thanks be to God for that patience and re∣signation to thy divine will, thou didst grant to thy servant, under all the afflictive dispensations of thy all wise providence; when thou didst take away the desire of his eyes with a stroke; and when thou wast pleased to take away the light of his eyes, that he could no more behold the light of this world, or objects of sense. That then thou didst resign his will, cause him cheer∣fully to acquiesce in it: That then thou didst strengthen the eye of faith to behold invisibles, to behold its glorious object. Now faith is swallowed up in open vision and full fruition, as I suppose.</P>
<P>Hail, happy soul, all hail! I congratulate thee on thy safe arrival to the blissful regions. O, let me by faith peep in a little, and view thee now thou hast dropped thy clog of mor∣tality. Now thou beholdest with open face the glory of Jehovah in the dear, the lovely face of Jesus Christ, that God-Man-Mediator, who died for thee, and said, Father, I will that those whom thou hast given me, be with me to behold my glory.—Ah, hast thou dropped the whole body of sin and death. All hail again! What! Canst thou now worship in the most humble, and yet exalted strains, without the least de∣gree of taint of that abominable thing which God's soul hateth? What! Made perfect in ho∣liness! No danger of one wrong principle; no

<P>O, when shall I arrive to this perfection of holiness: Thou wilt not fear for me there. I shall never damp thee more. My odious pride shall have no being there. Let me leap for joy, or shout as loud as I will the riches of distin∣guishing, free, rich, sovereign grace, thou wilt join me. I shall never unstring thy harp, nor thou mine. O thanks be to God, that I am re∣joicing in hope of coming to thee, to be with thee, and to be with Christ, which is far better.</P>
<P>O for grace to make haste, and finish the work God has given me to do. I would fulfil as a diligent hireling my day. But, my God, permit me to long for the shadows of the even∣ing. O, to me to live, is Christ; but to die, unspeakable gain. Let not the Lord be angry. Indulge me a little here, while, through thy grace, my soul breaks for the longing it hath for a freedom from sin. Oh monster!—And the full enjoyment of thyself. Thou knowest I am not groaning under worldly cares. Blessed be thy name, thou hast taken <HI>them</HI> away.—</P>
<P>And now, O my God, grant me strong pa∣tience, and profound submission to the divine will in all things; that I may wait all the days of my appointed time, till my great change come. I bless thee, that my bounds are set, and I cannot pass them. I shall not stay, when my work is done. Lord, it is enough! Thy time is best. Only grace sufficient for every moment, and it is enough.

Severe, hard and cruel, be∣cause it requires me to love the Lord my God with all my heart and soul and strength and mind; and my neighbor as myself? O God, forbid. Slay every degree of enmity that rises up against this righteous law, and calls it cruel. O may I ever lie in the dust for my continual deviations from and violations of thy holy law, and acknowledge I deserve eternal damnation for every breach of it: While I adore the in∣finite wisdom which has magnified the law and made it honorable in the death of the Son of God; while I adore the grace which has said, There is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. O, may my evidences be ever clear. Let me never build upon a persuasion that Christ, grace and pardon are mine, with∣out knowing that I have received him, and do rest upon him alone; am conformed to his im∣age, in the temper of my mind, and tenor of my life. Amidst all my deficiencies, yet I do love righteousness and hate iniquity. Yea, I do delight in the law of God after the inner man. I do esteem it beautiful, holy, just, and

<P><HI>Tuesday morning, November</HI> 9.—On Friday, October 15, I was taken with an ague fit, and extremity of pain, and so put to bed.—For some days I thought it nothing different from what I had been used to for many years, only in degree; as ague fits, hot fevers, and sweats. But at length I was convinced it was of a dif∣ferent kind. This presently gave a spring to my hope that this might prove my last sickness. That God was going, in mercy, to set his weary pilgrim free from the intolerable burden of sin, and take me to himself, to behold his glory. And as my disorders increased, my hope arose to a strong persuasion that I should die. And O how did my eager soul press forward, and bid death ten thousand welcomes! My God, my covenant, faithful God, shone in upon his own work in my soul; gave me clear and sub∣stantial evidences of my union to Christ by faith. All was calm within. I had enough to do to admire the astonishing goodness of God to me, inwardly and outwardly. Mercies flow∣ed in upon me from every quarter. All that could be thought of that was suitable for me was sent me in plenty; so that I had to spare to relieve other sick ones.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="035636_0150_100615331A84BA10"/>Twelve days I kept my bed, except being just taken up to have it made. My dear friends were tender of me, and tended me night and day. Perhaps not less than fifty offered to watch. My dear Susa tended me every day. The Lord reward her, and all the rest of my dear friends!</P>
<P>And since this sickness has not been unto death, I beseech thee, Lord, for Jesus Christ's sake alone, let it be for the glory of God. And as sure as Lazarus was raised from the dead, so sure let me be raised by the power of God to newness of life. O now let my faith be raised above the fears of sin and Satan and the world, as it has been raised above the fears of death. Now, Lord, help me to rely on the same al∣mighty, faithful, covenant God, with whom I could gladly have ventured through the dark valley of the shadow of death; and feared no evil, because thou wast with me. O now make me strong in faith, giving glory to God. Now let me come up through this wilderness leaning upon my beloved; depending on his love, his care, his faithfulness, his allsufficient grace to uphold and keep me, and suffer me neither to stinch nor fear, though I am perfect weakness; but, in thy strength, let me be as a giant; gird up my loins, and run with patience the race set before me. Now let me endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ; and not, as a timorous hare, shrink back. O let vehement love be as oil to the wheels; and let my soul be ever as the chariots of Aminadab, swiftly moving in the paths of universal obedience. O now glorify thyself in me. Dear Lord, where∣fore

True, Lord, I do fall inconceiva∣bly short of perfection in holiness. But thou, who knowest all things, dost know this is my grief and burden. Could it be, I had rather be perfectly holy, than to have all the world. I do hate sin, and myself for it. I do hate the remains of hypocrisy, as well as all my other sins.

<P><HI>Tuesday morning, April</HI> 3.—What is my end in practising the duties of religion? O Lord, thou knowest. I am so dark now that I cannot tell. As to fears of hell, thou knowest I am almost if not wholly without them, whether from faith or stupidity, I cannot tell: But it is certain I am not actuated by slavish fears of hell. But I bemoan it before God, that a legal
<PB N="316" REF="035636_0159_10061544316B69B8"/>
spirit is so interwoven with every thing I do, so that I act rather from fears than delight. And yet, if I do not delight in these exercises of religion, I am sure I have no delight at all. Sure here is the greatest satisfaction I do take. And, upon the whole, my soul, What are my fears, when I omit or carelessly perform duties? Answer. They are fears of provoking God to withdraw yet more from my soul; fears of his leaving me to hardness of heart, blindness of mind, barrenness of soul; and to fall so far as to wound his glorious, precious name. Sure it is precious to me, let Satan say what he will, or why these fears?</P>
<P>But why do I not rejoice in going to God's house, and to his table, as I used to do, esteem∣ing it and other duties the choicest privileges of my life? Answer. Because I do not meet with God in them. Could I find him whom my soul loveth, I should soon run to draw water out of these wells of salvation. O God, never suffer me to slight the means, for they are precious means ap∣pointed by Christ himself. Help me then, in the diligent use of all, to follow on till I do find my Lord again, to my unspeakable joy and con∣solation. Blessed Lord, thou hast said, I will not leave you comfortless, I will come to you. O come, leap over the mountains of my sins, and come away, and my heart shall rejoice, even mine: And I shall practise examination and ev∣ery other duty, with zeal and fervor, not with mercenary, selfish views. Only unveil thy beauties, my Lord and my God, I shall receive and rest upon thee alone for salvation, as thou
<PB N="317" REF="035636_0159_10061544316B69B8"/>
art offered in the gospel. I shall more and more renounce, not only in words, and my judgment; but from my inmost soul, all my own filthy rags, and rest upon, delight in, and plead thy precious, perfect, spotless righteous∣ness: Yes, I shall again rejoice to be nothing, that Christ may be all. O, come, my Lord, and I shall again adore electing love, free, dis∣tinguishing grace and mercy. This sullen, un∣grateful pride shall subside; these murmurings in my tent; this unbelief; this atheism; this hypocrisy; this formality; this lukewarm frame. O come, and my whole soul shall be engaged for God, and the honor of thy name. O come and make thy abode with me.</P>

<P><HI>Wednesday, April</HI> 4.—How do I behave now, with respect to death and judgment? Alas, in a stupid manner! It is but seldom I can bring it near, as in times past. Death and eternity seemed always almost, at the door. Now death seems to fly from me: And being weary of toiling, of temptation, sinning and sorrowing, I cast, as it were, a languishing look after it; but despond, expecting yet long and wearisome days and years. As to fears of death, blessed be God, I am not terrified with them. I, somehow, look on the day of death, as the day of Jubilee. But I cannot stretch into eternity, as heretofore. A negative happiness, a not sin∣ning, not conflicting, &amp;c. is all I can attain to. I cannot reach to a Pisgah's view of the full en∣joyment of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. I cannot conceive any thing about either the en∣joyments, or employments of the inhabitants a∣bove.
<PB N="318" REF="035636_0160_10061546C3AA5EA8"/>
The eye of faith is so dim, it cannot pierce within the veil. I cannot converse with glorified saints and angels, as once I could. I cannot fall prostrate at the feet of Jehovah, cast down my crown, and adore free, distin∣guishing grace; I cannot gaze on the perfec∣tions of a holy, holy, Lord God, as once I could; nor conceive how I ever shall. I have not a lively sense how it will be far better to depart, and be with Christ. I cannot get near him; a veil covers his lovely face; and there∣fore my soul is not enamored with his beauty, as once it was. O, if he could graciously draw aside the veil, before I was aware, my soul would be like the chariots of Aminadab. One glimpse of my Lord and my God, and it is done in a moment.</P>

<P><HI>April</HI> 5.—Am I prepared for death and judgment? A great question <HI>this</HI>!—My soul, do not trifle in answering. There will be no trifling before the judgment seat.

Of all the idle words that I have spoken, and of all the vain, vile, unbelieving, proud, hypocritical, murmur∣ing, atheistical thoughts, which have lodged in my heart? My soul, art thou ready? Nay; but art thou <HI>this moment</HI> ready? Say, Wilt thou go to the judgment seat, and there be tried by impartial justice? I know thou wilt. But art thou willing, cheerfully willing to go?

own person. Oh I cannot do that; for then I am sure I must roar in hell forever! No other sentence awaits me, but, Depart, ye accursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels! I am sure then I must be bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness, where shall be weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth: For I am an unprofitable servant. All my rags must fall off, and I shall be both naked and speechless before the judgment seat; a forlorn, odious spectacie to men and angels. Well, how knowest thou this will not be the case?</P>

Where is the foun∣dation of thy hope of lifting up thy head with joy, before the bar of God? How wilt thou look him in the face, whom thou hast so much abused? Since in every thing I have offended, and in all come short of the glory of God; justice must and will be satisfied.

<P>Answer. This is all that emboldens me to look up.—Sure God has enabled me to fly out of self, into the ark Christ Jesus. When I saw
<PB N="320" REF="035636_0161_100615484CD37A50"/>
the flood of divine vengeance ready to drown my soul in eternal perdition: When I found no rest for the sole of my foot, I flew to Jesus, and he put forth his hand and took me in; took me into union with himself; became my surety; appeased the wrath of an angry God. The flood abated, and he frowned no longer; but spake peace and pardon; entered into cov∣enant with me, and I became his own. And now, though he make not my house to grow; yet, I know he has made with me an everlast∣ing covenant, ordered in all things and sure. And in this is all my hope and confidence; for in that day God did clothe his returning prodi∣gal with the best robe; even the white and beautiful robe of the righteousness of Christ. And though, in myself, I am all deformity, all loathsome, more so than the most offensive car∣rion; yet in that I am lovely, beautiful and complete. Yes, in Christ I am complete. I have the word of God for it, that I am so. In <HI>that,</HI> I can face death in all its terrors, and lift up my head even at the judgment seat.—Bless∣ed be God, that he has accepted a vicarious sat∣isfaction. O blessed be God, for that perfect righteousness, wrought out by Christ, and im∣puted to me, being received by faith alone!</P>

His grace is sufficient for me, to make me take deep root downward in humility, and grow upward, to the honor and glory of his great name. He can yet glorify himself in me. He can yet clothe me with humility, that dear, that beauti∣ful garment, which of all others, best becomes a christian. Lord, I find I am laid in the bal∣ance, and found wanting every where.

O may I be easily bowed in spiritual things. May I be filled with sympathy, when I see others in distress; weep with those who weep.—And may I ever be easily won with kindness. O make and keep my heart always tender, with regard to the evil of sin; apt to be alarmed at the appearance of moral evil. O preserve me from self confidence in engaging spiritual ene∣mies. But as a little child flies to its parents for help, so may I fly to Christ.—Make me as a little child, afraid in the dark, and when far from home; so make me sensible of spiritual dangers, jealous of myself, full of fear, when I cannot see my way plain before me; afraid to be left alone, to be at a distance from God.

Lord God, pour out thy Spirit upon us, a spir∣it of humiliation, prayer and supplication. O that thou wouldest rend the heavens, and come down, and cause all mountains that rise in our way of access and conformity to thee, to flow down at thy presence. O excite our cries for thy church universal; for all the world of sin∣ners; for thy ministers every where; for our minister and church in particular. Lord, have mercy upon us, and yet revive us, for Jesus Christ's sake. And let us, thy poor, unworthy handmaids, yet rejoice in thy salvation.</P>

I adore the grace which has enabled me, vile as I am, to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, destitute, fatherless ones—to labor to support the gospel of Jesus Christ; and to refresh occasionally his dear ministers and chil∣dren. And I will plead for acceptance for his own name's sake: For he has told me, A cup of cold water shall be accepted; and those who give it in the name of a disciple or a prophet, shall not lose their reward. And I will hope in the mercy and free grace of God for accept∣ance of my poor labors of love, in educating the poor, from year to year; that I have been able to say, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee.

Blessed be God for the testimony of my conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity I have had my conversation in this world renouncing evil, hating covetousness, pride and unbelief; hating murmurings, dis∣contents, distrusts of providence and grace; hating deceit, guile, sloth and hypocrisy; yea, hating and groaning under the whole body of sin, and contrariety to God and his holy, pre∣cious law: And I do delight in it, after the in∣ward man, and long for conformity to it; yea, perfect conformity. And in the righteousness of Christ I am complete; though not in my own; I own it to be imperfect and defiled; yet in the Beloved I am accepted: And, God helping me, I will cling there, and with Job I will hold my integrity, till I die. I am not wholly a hypocrite, though tainted with hypoc∣risy. The Lord rebuke thee, Satan, and in his own time deliver me from thee. And he will do it: For he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. And he never will. O now let me boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear. O my God, help me!

O Lord, thou knowest they will, through the malice of Satan, dishonor thee more than ever; be more averse to the ways and people of God than ever, except thou dost turn them about by almighty power. Lord, is thy hand shortened that it cannot save? Are even the children of Rhodeisland out of the reach of sovereign grace? Shall goodly appear∣ances all wear off and come to nought?

Lord, what not▪ O let pure mercy plead on our behalf. Justice is satisfied in the death of thy only, beloved Son, for the chief of sinners: Now let mercy plead, because of the full atonement. Oh, be∣cause of the full atonement, let me lift up my guilty head, and plead for sovereign mercy, and boundless grace. O why should we go on hardened, impenitent and unreclaimed? O my God, I would humbly bless thee that some, I trust, are brought home. O let it be as an

<P><HI>Thursday, April</HI> 23.—It has pleased a righteous, holy, and good God, to lay his hand on me from Saturday afternoon; so that I have been unable to attend on either the black peo∣ple, young women, lads, or school. Have kept my chamber from Lord's day; attended with an ague in my face, much swoln, a fever, &amp;c. And, blessed be God, a sweet content, a resigned will; some little glimpse of hope that I might possibly go home. A sweet satisfaction in a settled belief, that, however poor, short∣sighted, ignorant mortals may, through frailty, have set their eyes too much on a worthless worm, God stands in no need of me. What∣ever infinite love and wisdom has devised, in∣finite power will effect. I cannot cause a sin∣gle word to do good to any one; but God can do his own work by whom he will. Blessed be his name, that does not depend on so slen∣der a thing as my poor, feeble frame. Though that were dissolved, the Lord yet lives. Let this comfort me, and all my dear friends; and resign us all to thy holy will.</P>
<P>But, Lord, if it be thy pleasure to continue me in life, thy will be done. Then, even here do what thou wilt with me: Only glorify thy∣self in me; only make the path of duty plain to me, and I will, by grace, go in it. Whether thou dost call me to active or passive obedi∣ence, thy will be done. If the Lord hath no
<PB N="335" REF="035636_0168_1006155A0B0EC7B0"/>
more for me to do, who am I, that I should contend! If it be his pleasure, I should yet serve him, and my generation according to his will, he will bring me back, restore health of body, and fortitude of mind, against Satan's wiles. He will kindle my love to him and his cause afresh. He will of his own sovereign grace, grant me warmer zeal to run the heav∣enly road: For he is a faithful God. And he will clothe me with that humility, which shall, of his infinite grace, prevent his work being marred in my worthless hands. And glory shall redound to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, through the thanksgivings of many, on my be∣half.</P>
<P>And now I determine, by grace, cheerfully to go forth to the work, to which God shall call me this day and evening, so far as God, with strength of body, and assistance of his Spirit, permit. Thou knowest that without thee I can do nothing. Only help me, Lord, and I will neither flinch nor fear; but work till I die.</P>

<P>Permit me now humbly to adore thee wherein thou hast done it, thou glorious, victo∣rious, triumphant King of Zion, from the day of my espousals, amidst ten thousand inbred lusts, traitors, serpents, vipers, which have lift up their heads and heels against thee, and sought my overthrow. Yet thou hast preserved me, and my darling too, thine own honor and glo∣ry; and hast not suffered me to wound that name, which thou hast from the first, made dearer to me than life. Yea, though, through weakness and folly, and a thousand stratagems of Satan, I have risked it, yet thou hast pre∣served it. Ten thousand times ten thousand praises, my God, that thy glory is what it is to thee; that the cause is one, and the interest one. O I humbly bless thee, that thou didst from the first moment in which I became thine, lay thy glory so near my heart, that it has ever since in∣deed been my darling, my delight and joy, a∣midst ten thousand imperfections, and foiling by Satan and the world; yet here thou hast kept me stedfastly determined, through grace, through Christ strengthening me, <HI>That I will

leave, lofe and deny all that is dear to me in life; yea, and life itself too, if ever they stand in com∣petion with thy glory.</HI> And here I am, after more than thirty years, still determined, by grace, to be for thee, and no other to my latest breath, and to all eternity. O grant me strength from heaven to perform my vows. This is what I want. O strengthen me with strength in my soul now, in the day I cry to thee.

And now the artillery of heaven is displaying, sup∣pose the arrows of the Almighty should drink up my spirits in an instant; say, my sluggish soul, art thou ready to appear before Jehovah's awful bar? Lord God, thou knowest; and I pray thee, let me not be deceived, if I answer in the affirmative. Let me with joy lift up my head, if my redemption from sin is so near; if this poor, mean clog, my feeble body, will in∣terrupt communion with God no more. Adieu, my dear companion! If it be the Lord's will, I bid thee a cheerful adieu, till the morning of a glorious resurrection. I ask not a moment's reprive, if it be my Lord's will to take me.

Art thou ready?—Alas! all my works are imperfect, and unfinished; and will remain so, if I should live to the age of Methuselah: Yea, and I shall add sin to sin, against my gra∣cious God, till death does stop me. Not till

then will my sanctification be complete. But Christ has finished all the work his Father gave him to do. He said, It is finished! The right∣eousness he has wrought out is complete, and in him I stand complete. I have fled to it, I have laid hold on it; God has imputed it, and clothed me with it; and in it, I will cherfully venture through death, and to the judgment seat: For there Christ will openly acknowledge me. I have confessed him before men, and he will confess me before his Father, and his holy angels. The law and justice of God will ac∣quit me; for it is magnified, and fully satisfied; and there is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus. He is able to keep me from falling, should God yet preserve me in this life, and to present me faultless before the throne of God.</P>
<P>My soul, rest secure in him, whether in life, or in death. Reach after as great degrees of conformity to the divine image, and resignation to his will, as can be attained below; and bye and bye God will take thee. Wait his time, that is the best of all.</P>

But to what end should I live, if I live a cold, careless, sin∣ful life. Lord, how shall I glorify thee in life, if I remain so extreme unholy, so unlike to thee! If I backslide yet more; play the harlot yet more: And my love to thee, and zeal for thy glory, and the good of precious immortals grow cold. O my God, shall I not thus dis∣honor thee, and harden others hearts against thee! O, as sure as God is in heaven, and I upon earth; so sure I shall act this treacherous part, if thou dost not stand by me, strengthen and uphold me. O my God, leave me not a moment; for in that moment I fall.

<HEAD><HI>Wednesday morning,</HI> <DATE><HI>October</HI> 7, 1767.</DATE> Matthew xvi. 13, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MY glorious Lord, dost thou inquire, Whom do men say that I, <MILESTONE N="14"/> the Son of man am? There are indeed various opinions of thee this day. <MILESTONE N="15"/> Some believe thee to be only as a great prophet, who did not exist till time began, <MILESTONE N="16"/> &amp;c. But dost thou ask me, who I think thou art? Lord, I know thou art Christ, the Son of the living God. Yea, from everlasting to everlasting thou art God, that great I AM, who art still the same.</P>
<P>Let me hear thee pronounce the blessing on me; <MILESTONE N="17"/> for flesh and blood did not reveal this to me; but thy Father who is in heaven, by his Spirit, for the salvation of my poor soul.</P>
<P>And on thee, as an eternal rock, are all my hopes of safety forever built: <MILESTONE N="18"/> And I do be∣lieve the gates of hell shall not finally pre∣vail against me, after ten thousand attempts to overthrow my faith, yet this rock is my defence.</P>
<P>I humbly bless thee for assurance from thy word, <MILESTONE N="19"/> that what thy Peter and other apos∣tles by their writings bound on earth, is bound in heaven; and what they have loosed on earth, is loosed in heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="035636_0173_1006156767AC6EE0"/> <MILESTONE N="20"/> Is it thy will that I should keep secret the discoveries thou makest to me of thyself? Then show it to me clearly. Let me not be at a loss to know what is duty in this point: That I may neither withhold, nor reveal, contrary to thy blessed will; but always do the things that please thee, and by which thou wilt be glorifi∣ed in me, and by others too.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="21"/> My dear Redeemer, since thou hast suf∣fered, according to thy word, let me never be offended in a crucified Jesus, <MILESTONE N="22"/> or any doctrines of his cross; or sufferings to be endured for thy sake. <MILESTONE N="23"/> Lord, let me never favor the things that be of men; flesh pleas∣ing things; and hereby merit thy sharp re∣bukes: But teach me to acquiesce in all the will of God; all that is brought to pass by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, however contrary to flesh and blood. Lord, teach me effectually, to believe at all times, that infinite wisdom knows best what is most for his own glory, and does all things well.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="24"/> And in whatever thou art pleased to call me to selfdenial, I pray thee, grant me strength from heaven, that in every thing, without reserve, <MILESTONE N="25"/> I may cheerfully take up my cross, and follow thee, never attempting to save my life in a sinful way; but joyfully lose it, rather than sin against thee, lose thee, and lose my own soul. What shall all the world profit me, <MILESTONE N="26"/> while bemoaning a lost God, a lost Christ, a lost heaven, and a lost soul! Oh, in those circumstances, what would not a man give in exchange for his soul! But alas! Noth∣ing
<PB N="346" REF="035636_0174_1006156AD55AB878"/>
is to be had as an equivalent; nor will God accept of any thing in exchange for the re∣demption of the soul, when the only Savior he has provided for its redemption is denied and rejected: <MILESTONE N="27"/> —For when the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his holy angels, to reward every man according to his works, it will be forever too late for those out of him to find mercy.</P>
<P>O Lord, set home by thine almighty power, these alarming considerations upon my own soul, for quickening, I pray thee; that I may give all diligence in making my calling and election sure here; and at last have a reward of pure free grace, according to my works; though not <HI>for</HI> them.</P>

<P>O THOU great Searcher of hearts, I fly to thee to search and try me <HI>now.</HI> I am one of these virgins who have taken a lamp, and am come forth to thy ordinances, <MILESTONE N="1"/> the ways of thy own appointment, to meet the Bride∣groom of precious souls. Show me the truth <HI>now.</HI> <MILESTONE N="2"/> Am I a wise, or am I a foolish one? Have I took my lamp without oil? Or have I the oil of true grace in my vessel with my lamp? <MILESTONE N="3"/> Have I my lamp, and my oil too?
<PB N="347" REF="035636_0174_1006156AD55AB878"/>
O let me not live at the least uncertainty. <MILESTONE N="4"/> Arouse me out of my spiritual slumber. And with me, <MILESTONE N="5"/> all professors; for we all slum∣ber and sleep.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="6"/> O arouse us before the midnight cry comes, that we may now arise and trim our lamps, <MILESTONE N="7"/> while oil is to be had. Now let us search our lamps, and see if they are likely, yea, if there is a possibility that they will go out. O my God, let us not be mistaken, till the day of grace is past.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="8"/> It will be in vain to ask wise virgins for part of their oil. Poor hearts! Though thou hast, <MILESTONE N="9"/> of thy boundless grace bestowed a suf∣ficiency on them, to keep their lamps burn∣ing, they have none to spare: They cannot communicate one drop. I fly to thee; thou hast a sufficiency; yea, an allsufficiency to fill my lamp and vessel up to the brim. I cannot go forth to meet thee without it; my lamp will go out, and I shall be left in obscure darkness. I cannot go to buy, when I should have it to burn: I must have it <HI>now.</HI> I know not how soon the cry will come, Go ye forth to meet him; and then it will be too late forever. Lord, pity me, and with me all who profess thee. I beg for others, as for my own soul, that we may not be found foolish virgins at last; <MILESTONE N="10"/> and while we are gone to buy, thou come, and those who are ready go in with thee, and the door be shut.</P>
<P>O will it be thus with me? Tell me cer∣tainly by thy word and Spirit, Is it possible I shall come at last, <MILESTONE N="11"/> with a Lord, Lord, o∣pen
<PB N="348" REF="035636_0175_1006156C8BB41030"/>
unto me! <MILESTONE N="12"/> And thou answer, Verily I know you not. Many have been deceived; Lord, can it be that I should be so too! Here I am, now, Lord, search me and try me, and discover what is the truth to me also. Dost thou not know me? And do I not know thee? Speak, Lord, by thy word and Spirit. Say to me, I know thee by name, and will not reject thee. I will, in no wife, cast thee out.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="13"/> But O, let not me, nor any of thine, rest secure in past attainments, but all watch. For we know not the day, nor the hour where∣in the Son of man cometh, <MILESTONE N="14"/> to call to an ac∣count those to whom he has committed his goods. To one five talents, to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his ability. <MILESTONE N="15"/> Glorious Lord, I have, at least one. <MILESTONE N="18"/> I pray thee suffer me not to dig in the earth by carking cares about this lower world, and hide my Lord's money, sloth∣fully folding my hands, imagining I can do nothing, because I have not strength and ability of my own, <MILESTONE N="24"/> basely and ungratefully, and falsely accusing thee with being an hard mas∣ter, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gath∣ering where thou hast not strewed: <MILESTONE N="25"/> And so, through cowardly fear and unbelief, hide my talent in the earth.</P>
<P>True, hateful pride is ready to rise and rob God of his glory, in every attempt to improve my talent. But shall I, to prevent that, run to the other extreme, and hide my Lord's money? Is not his grace sufficient for me? O my God, guide, direct and protect me, even me. He
<PB N="349" REF="035636_0175_1006156C8BB41030"/>
who had five talents, did improve; he who had two, did improve. It was by thy grace they did so. Say to me, even to me, My grace is suf∣ficient for thee, and I will endeavor to improve also. O make me wise to know in what way I may best improve to thy honor and glory; wise to know times and seasons, and in what way God does call me to improve. Art thou in thy providence lessening my opportunities in a social way? Will God now guide and direct my pen. Let that be improved to the glory of him who has committed that talent to me. My pen is thine, guide it for thy own glory. And guide me in the business of instructing little ones. O Lord, make me faithful there, to im∣prove the talent thou hast committed to my charge; and bear me up against all discourage∣ments. And make me to improve my talent for the good of my poor family. O let me some way; yea, every way improve so, by thy grace, that at last I may be able to lift up my head with joy, and say, Lord, thou deliveredst to me—and, behold, I have gained! O, of thine infinite grace, assisting me all the while, et me hear at last, a <HI>Well done, good and faith∣ful servant</HI>; and free grace shall forever be my song.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="29"/> Thou hast said, Unto him who hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. I humbly plead for more grace to exercise grace.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="30"/> Let me not at last be cast, with the unprof∣itable servant, into outer darkness; where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth— nor any dear to me, by the bonds of nature or
<PB N="350" REF="035636_0176_100615703B82D918"/>
friendship. I would beg for all, as for my own soul. Go forth with me this day, and let my petitions be answered for the great Inter∣cessor's sake alone. Thanks be to God for the assistance of his Spirit with his word, which is indeed of use to direct us in prayer.</P>
<P>Prepare me, Lord, for that grand and awful moment, when thou who hast taken on thee the human nature, <MILESTONE N="31"/> shall come in thy glory, and all the holy angels with thee: And thou shalt sit on thy throne of glory; and before thee shall be gathered all nations; <MILESTONE N="32"/> and thou shalt separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. O then let me stand on thy right hand, and not on the left. <MILESTONE N="33"/> O then, unworthy as I am in myself, <MILESTONE N="34"/> let me, of thy boundless, sove∣reign grace, hear thee bid me come; hear thee pronounce me blessed of thy Father; and called to inherit the kingdom, prepared for thine from before the foundation of the world. Wilt thou then remember, and mercifully accept what poor, <MILESTONE N="35"/> imperfect services I am now, by thy own grace, enabled to do to any of thine? <MILESTONE N="36"/> Whether to relieve the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, or in prison. Lord, it is so little I can do; and that little so polluted with the dreadful nature of sin, that I dare not plead any thing I have done, or ever can do. Yet make me more than ever sincere, in aiming at doing as to thyself. Let love to thee be the motive and spring of all my ac∣tions; and then I shall never grudge my ut∣most to any of thine.</P>

<HEAD>PART IV. The Conclusion of her Life.</HEAD>
<P>THE bodily infirmities of Mrs. Osborn increased so much; and her eyesight failed to such a degree for above twenty years of the last part of her life, and her whole bodily frame was so weakened and worn out, that she was obliged to give up her school, and was not able to do any thing to support herself. And as she had nothing laid up to live upon, she was wholly dependent on Divine Providence and her friends for daily supplies, during the whole of this time; and was, the greatest part of it, confined to her room. This was in many res∣pects the happiest part of her life. She was free from worldly anxiety and care. She en∣joyed a calmness and serenity of mind, the at∣tendant of resignation to God, and humble trust and confidence in him, contented with the al∣lotments of Divine Providence, seeing the hand of God in every thing which took place—con∣stantly thankful to him for the mercies she was daily and every hour receiving—full of grati∣tude to those whom God inclined to show kindness to her—spending the chief of her time and strength in devotion, in contemplating the divine perfections manifested in his works of
<PB N="353" REF="035636_0177_10061571E75FE520"/>
creation and providence, and in his word—a∣doring and praising the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, praying to him for the church and the world; for her acquaintance, relations, friends, benefactors, and for herself; with constant, humble confession of unworthiness, aggravated sins, and depravity of heart, making the daily occurrences respecting herself, and others, the matter of prayer and praise.</P>
<P>She enjoyed an almost uninterrupted assur∣ance of her interest in the divine favor through Jesus Christ, and longed to be perfectly holy. The thought of dying was pleasing to her: And when any particular disorder, or pain of body, came upon her, which seemed to indicate a speedy dissolution, it would commonly give a spring to her mind and excite pleasure and joy. Thus she appeared in this last part of her life in a measure to enjoy the happy consequence and reward, of the sore trials, labors and conflicts, through which she had passed in former years. Something of which the reader has seen in that part of her diary which has been transcribed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Osborn often said to her friends in this time, that she considered her situation and cir∣cumstances in life, to be the best for her; and that she knew of none, with whom she could wish to exchange outward circumstances, were it left to her option. She expressed a particu∣lar satisfaction in living sensibly dependent on the providence of God, for daily supplies for the body, living with God by the day, as she used to express it, having no store of her own, and not able to do any thing to supply her re∣turning
<PB N="354" REF="035636_0178_100615738C61B168"/>
wants, and not knowing how and by whom they would be supplied, till it was sent in to her, commonly in ways, and by persons not thought of by her. This was suited to ex∣cite a constant sense of her dependence on God for daily and hourly supplies, and the exercise of trust in him, and constant application to him, and acknowledgement and admiration of his goodness in supplying her wants, in a way and at times suited to discover his hand and par∣ticular care of her; and to excite her gratitude to her friends, and prayers for them, who sent or brought to her the things she wanted.</P>
<P>In this manner she lived more than twenty years, and often declared to her friends that her daily wants were fully supplied, and that she was never destitute of the necessaries of life, and commonly had a fulness, and often abound∣ed. Her wants were not great. She stood in need of daily food, washing, candle light, fire wood, and some clothing, and money to pay the rent of her house, which was five dollars every three months. All these wants were constantly supplied, while no particular person was en∣gaged to do it; so that she had none to depend upon but God. While the British had posses∣sion of Rhodeisland in the time of the war, which was near three years, the inhabitants of Newport were driven to great straights, by the scarcity of provision, fuel, &amp;c. and many suffer∣ed to a great degree. Mrs. Osborn lived in a great degree of quiet, and had a constant sup∣ply of the necessaries of life; and received no abuse from the British officers or soldiers, as
<PB N="355" REF="035636_0178_100615738C61B168"/>
most others did. Though a number of soldiers were quartered near the house in which she lived, none were obtruded on her, as they were on others. And as to those who were quarter∣ed near her; it was remarked by her and oth∣ers, that they made less disturbance and noise, than they did elsewhere; and were particularly careful not to do any thing on the Sabbath to disturb that <HI>good woman,</HI> as they called her. And they took care to avoid all profa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e words when near her. Which she used to mention afterwards to her friends, as a remarkable in∣stance of the tender care and protection of heaven.</P>
<P>In the year 1778, while the British soldiers had possession of Newport, Mr. Osborn, her husband, died; and a grand daughter of his, with her husband, who lived in her house, on whom she had some dependence for protection and assistance, moved into the country, by which she appeared more destitute and expos∣ed, than before, being left <HI>alone.</HI></P>
<P>In this time of particular danger and trial, Mrs. MASON, a person who gave good evi∣dence that she was a real friend to Christ, and to his followers, manifested peculiar friendship and generosity towards her, by her constant at∣tention to her, and supplying many of her wants; and continued her special kindness in ministering to her as long as she (Mrs. Mason) lived, which she did till March, 1792. Mrs. Orsborn often said, that Mrs. Mason never failed her in one instance, as a peculiar friend and constant benefactor, to the day of her
<PB N="356" REF="035636_0179_10061575FB270D18"/>
death. We have no reason to doubt that they, both the giver and the receiver, are peculiarly happy together now; and that the former is re∣warded a thousand fold for all her kindness to the latter, as a dear disciple of Jesus Christ. Others have distinguished themselves in their kindness to Mrs. Osborn in ministering to her, whom it is improper to mention, as they are yet alive. We have the pleasure of being as∣sured that they, and all who have ministered to her, <HI>because she belonged to Christ,</HI> will have an ample reward at the resurrection of the just.</P>
<P>There was something peculiar and extraor∣dinary in her being able punctually to pay the rent of her house in this time, which is worthy of particular mention. She depended wholly upon the unsolicited benefactions of her friends for this, as she did for her daily support. And no one was engaged to assist her in doing this, or to take any care about it. She had there∣fore no particular person to look to for it, or to make up any deficiency by which she should be unable to pay what was due at the end of each quarter. It was therefore a very preca∣rious matter, to human appearance, whether, when she had paid the rent of one quarter, she should ever be able to pay another. She could not conjecture from whence it would come, as she had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to look to for it, but that God, whose is the world, and the fulness thereof. Her intimate friends were sometimes concerned for her, when her quarter was near at an end, and she had received but part of the five dollars which would be soon due, and there was a
<PB N="357" REF="035636_0179_10061575FB270D18"/>
great scarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of money, and all appearances that she would not be able to pay. When this was suggested to her, she would reply nearly in the following words. "I desire to be thank∣ful to God, I do not feel in the least anxious about it. I do not doubt of my having the whole of the money at the time in which it will be due, or near it. God has given me a con∣stant and earnest desire to do justice, and pay when any thing is due. This is a just debt, and God has been pleased hitherto to gratify me by enabling me to pay, when it is due; and I believe he will still continue to do it. Per∣haps I shall not live to the end of the quarter. I shall then leave enough to pay this debt. I desire to leave it with God." She generally had the money in her hand by the time it was due, and never failed being able to pay with punctuality. She frequently did not receive much, if any part of the money, till just before the quarter was ended, and knew not from whom, or from whence it would come; yet be∣fore the time to pay came, as much as was necessary to answer her end at that time, would be brought or sent to her, by persons who knew nothing of her present strait. And it was often sent by persons who lived at a distance, which would come to her just at the time in which it was wanted. She had money sent her from Quebec, from the West Indies, and from vari∣ous parts of the United States.</P>
<P>This is related as a remarkable instance of humble trust in God, and resignation and acqui∣escence in his will; and of the tender care
<PB N="358" REF="035636_0180_1006157A06473168"/>
and faithfulness of God, and loving kindness to∣wards one devoted to his service, and trusting in his promises: And that it may serve as an example and encouragement to all, to "trust in the Lord, at all times, and pour out their hearts before him."</P>
<P>Mrs. Orsborn was, in the last twenty years of her life, stripped, by degrees, and deprived of many privileges and enjoyments, which to her had been very great and precious. She had esteemed public worship, attending on the preaching of the gospel and public institutions, as far more desirable and important than all worldly good, in attending on which she had great enjoyment. But her bodily infirmities were so great and increasing, that for near twenty years she was unable to attend public worship. Her eyes failed her to such a degree, that she was obliged to lay by her pen, not being able to write any thing considerable, which she had done before this with great pleasure and profit to herself, having written more than fifty volumes, the least containing near 100 pages, the bigger part above 200, and a number 300, and more, besides letters to her friends, and other occasional writing. The failing of her sight also deprived her of the pleasure and profit of <HI>reading</HI>; especially of reading the Bi∣ble, which she had before daily perused with great pleasure and advantage. She had the Bible, indeed, read to her daily; which she considered as an unspeakable favor. But this did not equal the privilege of being able to have access to it, at all times, and on every
<PB N="359" REF="035636_0180_1006157A06473168"/>
particular occasion. But she paid such atten∣tion to the Bible, read it so much, and so trea∣sured it up in her memory, while she could read, that she found great pleasure and bene∣fit in being able to recollect so much of it, when she was not able to read; which she fre∣quently mentioned to her friends, as matter of thankfulness.</P>
<P>The religious meetings in the room where she lived, which have been mentioned, of the church, of the female society, and occasional meetings for prayer of a number of professors of religion, which she considered as a great priv∣ilege, were continued as long as she was able to bear them, partly for her sake. But at length her infirmities were so great that she was obliged to relinquish this enjoyment. And she became so weak that she could not bear lengthy visits of her friends, in which she used to take a peculiar pleasure. Her most intimate friends could only have short interviews with her at different times. But while she found herself thus deprived of these privileges and her precious enjoyments, one after another, she remained calm and resigned in a sense of her unworthiness of them, and desert of in∣finitely greater evils; and constantly expressed her thankfulness for the privileges and favors she yet enjoyed; particularly that God had not taken himself from her; but indulged her with such a degree of free access to him, and such enjoyment of him in views of his glorious per∣fections and works, especially his love and grace in the glorious work of redemption,
<PB N="360" REF="035636_0181_1006157B916E0170"/>
which more than made up for all that was taken from her. She enjoyed the almost uninter∣rupted light of God's countenance, and spent most of her time and strength in devotion, in prayer and praise, in which she had unspeaka∣ble delight, and a rich foretaste of heaven. She used to say, she had learned to consider and hold her nearest friends, as well as all worldly enjoyments, as a cloak or loose garment, which she was ready to have taken off and laid aside, whenever there was occasion for it.</P>
<P>Some years before her death, she said to her friends, she thought the time was now come for them, and all who knew her, to be quite willing that she should leave the world; for she was become useless in all respects, and was only a charge and burden to those by whom her bodily wants were supplied. She was told, that all her friends desired that her life might be yet continued, if consistent with the divine will, as she was far from being useless, as we had her prayers for her friends; for the church and congregation to which she belonged; for all the people and churches of Christ, and his interest and kingdom in the world, &amp;c. And when her acquaintance, and, particularly, the congregation of which she was a member, thought of her, as being alive in her room, which probably most of them often did, it was attended with an idea and feeling, which tend∣ed to their good, and which they could not have, if she were not in the world. And as to those who ministered to her support and com∣fort, they enjoyed a privilege and satisfaction
<PB N="361" REF="035636_0181_1006157B916E0170"/>
in it, instead of its being an undesirable burden, which they could not have, if she were not here in just such circumstances. And they who did this to her, because she belonged to Christ, had opportunity hereby to exercise christian charity, and express their love to Christ, for all which they would be abundantly rewarded in his eternal kingdom. Her reply was to this purpose. "If this be so, and I can be in any respect and degree useful in my situation and circumstances, I am willing to continue in the body; but to depart and be with Christ is far better. I desire to leave it all with God, and am willing to live or die, just as he pleases."</P>
<P>Some months before her decease her disor∣ders of body appeared to increase; her strength failed her more and more, and she became dropsical, and was at times in great distress for want of breath. She considered herself as now soon <HI>going home,</HI> as she expressed it, and wished for patience to wait till the appointed time of her departure should come, and to bear what∣ever bodily distress God was pleased to lay upon her. She desired her friends to pray for her, that she might have faith and patience to the end of life, and, in no respect, conduct so as to be a disgrace to the religion which she pro∣fessed, and put her christian friends to shame on her account: But that she might glorify God, and speak, and conduct worthy of her high and holy calling, to her last breath.</P>
<P>In a sketch of Mrs. Osborn's character, in∣serted in the Theological Magazine, No. 1.
<PB N="362" REF="035636_0182_1006157D2DDAD888"/>
Vol. II, is the following paragraph, written by one who visited her often in her last sickness.</P>
<P>"As she drew near the close of life, she was a proof of the strength and hope of the righteous; was an instance of the mysterious example of flourishing virtue, with the decays of nature: Of satisfaction in the prospect of future good, when from the world she could derive no pleasure. My physician," she said, "has seriously intimated, that I cannot live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng; but I am not alarmed. Unless my heart deceive me, and <HI>the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked</HI>; but unless mine <HI>greatly</HI> deceive me, I have no reason to be apprehensive for the future state. It appears to be the will of God that I should go hence. I ought to submit to his will, and I do, with cheerfulness. May his will be done." In an∣other season, she said, "The trials of my situation are great; to be in want of breath, is very distressing; pray for me, that I may have patience and resignation: I desire them above all things. O pray for me that, in these last hours of my life, I may not cause you all to blush that I have professed christianity." It being remarked, that God was faithful, and would never forsake those who had loved and served him. "Yes," she replied, "I know, by experience, that he is a faithful covenant keep∣ing God, and he will never leave those who love and serve him; though without his grace I should immediately sink, and my mind be filled with darkness and repining." In this temper of humility and reliance on God, she
<PB N="363" REF="035636_0182_1006157D2DDAD888"/>
continued, and gave no sign of impatience, more than saying, a day or two before her death, when she heard the bell toll, that some∣body had got the start of her."</P>
<P>She continued to sink by degrees, till after a distressing turn, she appeared more comfortable, and they who attended her, helped her to lie down, at her desire, hoping she might get some rest and sleep. They left her for a few minutes, and when they returned, they found her breath was gone, and she a lifeless corpse! Thus she left the world, and passed that death which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had so often and so long desired, calm and se∣rene, without the least perceivable struggle or groan, and, we doubt not, entered into that rest to which the righteous go, on the 2d day of August, 1796, in the 83d year of her age. Her funeral was attended on the 4th day of August, by an uncommon concourse of peo∣ple. The corpse was carried into the meeting house, and a funeral sermon was preached, from Ephesians iv.1. <HI>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Memoirs will be concluded by mentioning a number of particulars of her christian character, in which Mrs. Orsborn was eminent, and worthy of imitation, which have been in some measure brought into view in the foregoing narrative, and the extracts from her diary; and appear in a more clear and striking
<PB N="364" REF="035636_0183_1006157FAA10B128"/>
light to those who have perused the whole of her writings, or had a particular and intimate acquaintance with her.</P>
<P>She was sensibly and strongly devoted to the glory of God, and conscientiously sought to honor him in all her ways. She was tenderly concerned, and careful to do and say nothing which had the least perceivable tendency to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onor him, and constantly watched against every thing of that kind. She desired nothing for herself or others, and that nothing might take place, but what was consistent with the highest display of the divine glory; and it was matter of constant joy to her, that God was able and would secure his own honor, and make the brightest manifestation of his own glorious per∣fections; and would suffer nothing to take place but that which should be for his glory; and there∣fore would cause even those things and events, which, in themselves appeared to have a tenden∣cy to the contrary, to be the occasion of a more clear discovery of his most amiable and glori∣ous character. She had an affecting and strong abhorrence of every thing which she saw in herself, even all moral depravity; and which appeared in others, as having a tendency to dishonor God. This was a constant source of grief and trouble to her. By this she mani∣fested a high degree of disinterested, benevolent love to God, and was more conformed than most professing christians appear to be, to that apostolic injunction, "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="035636_0183_1006157FAA10B128"/>Her love to God, and benevolence to man∣kind led her greatly to desire the prosperity and advancement of the interest and kingdom of Christ in the world, and the salvation of men. For this she prayed, and rejoiced when she found others engaged and united in this, and when there was any appearance of the re∣vival of religion, and of the conversion of sin∣ners, or heard of any thing of this kind in dis∣tant places. She earnestly sought the salvation and temporal good of all whom she knew, and with whom she had any connection; and their circumstances, and the events respecting them, whether prosperous or adverse, affected her, which constantly afforded her matter of prayer and praise, while she endeavored to conduct towards all, and treat them so in all respects as to recommend religion to them, and persuade them to embrace and practise it.</P>
<P>She practised secret devotions at stated times, unless prevented by some unavoidable inter∣ruption; in which she spent considerable time every day, in reading the Bible, serious medi∣tation and prayer, in which she had, especially at times, great enlargement and delight. And when she had no sensible access to God, she could have but little comfort and enjoyment in any thing. Her mind was frequently and almost constantly exercised in devotion by pi∣ous ejaculations, when in company, or attending to her daily business.</P>
<P>She was a great friend to family religion, to have some portion of the Bible read, and prayer attended in the family, in the morning
<PB N="366" REF="035636_0184_10061583DF248CA8"/>
and evening; and took care to have all her family present, and that they should behave with decency. And when no man was present, she thought it her duty to pray with her family herself.</P>
<P>She had a great veneration and love for the christian Sabbath, and public worship. This was a high day with her; and she commonly had great enjoyment in attending public prayers, singing, and hearing the word preach∣ed; and especially in attending the Lord's Sup∣per; for which she was careful and solemn in preparations, and self examination. She used to recollect the particular heads of the public discourses for her own improvement in her re∣tirement, and often committed them to writing, with her reflections on them. She was care∣ful to prepare for the Sabbath, by ordering her family affairs so as not to be led by them to intrude upon the Sabbath, or be any disturb∣ance to her devotions. And after she was con∣fined, and could not attend public worship, she took special care not to attend to any thing on the day before the Sabbath, which might in any respect unfit her for the private duties of the Sabbath, wishing to reserve all her strength of body and mind for the exercises of that high day. And though she could not enjoy bodily attendance on public worship; yet in her spirit she was present with the worshipping assemblies of christians; especially with that to which she had a more particular relation, so as to have a peculiar enjoyment in her attending to them, and joining with them in her mental exercises.
<PB N="367" REF="035636_0184_10061583DF248CA8"/>
In this respect she received great benefit by public worship, and doubtless had more bene∣fit and enjoyment from it, than many, if not the most, received, who were allowed to attend constantly. She was so inquisitive to know what were the subjects of the public discourses, that she would be informed what they were to be, before they were delivered, or soon after, and she would attend to them, and so feast upon the truths contained in them, that her en∣tertainment and profit by them appeared far to exceed that which most who heard them in public obtained.</P>
<P>The following extract of a letter which she wrote to a friend, is inserted here, as an illus∣tration of the above. Speaking of her being deprived of the enjoyment of public worship, by bodily infirmity, she said, "My Lord's days' enjoyments, since my confinement, have been better felt than expressed. Perhaps my exercises never were higher, when worshipping in God's own house, nor even at the Redeemer's table: Never felt a dearer union with the people of God; that oneness which cannot be expressed. Nor had stronger desires excited by the Spirit of God for Zion's prosperity; and the destruc∣tion of sin and Satan, and advancement of Christ's cause and kingdom: Nor stronger de∣sires to help my dear minister while he was en∣gaged in the Lord's work; to be permitted to hold up his hands, that Amalek may not pre∣vail, but the work of the Lord prosper in his hands. The sweet delight I have in realizing that the dear sheep and lambs of Christ's fold
<PB N="368" REF="035636_0185_10061585764EB1D8"/>
are feeding on the gospel dainties, is not easily described. I am indeed a partaker with them, though absent in body. And God so blesseth something repeated to me from the sermons, that I retain and feed more on the precious truths all the week, than I have been able to re∣tain, when I have heard the whole. Thus, be∣cause akin to the glorious Jesus, I dwell in Go∣shen, though not in the King's court, or at his table. And dare I be restless and complain, because I cannot go out? No, no! The will of the Lord be done. I stand amazed at his gen∣tle dealings with such a monster of iniquity!"</P>
<P>She was not talkative; yet affable and pleas∣ant in conversation, and when in company with her friends and acquaintance, she had an aver∣sion to vain, trifling conversation. And if at any time it took place, she would generally at∣tempt to divert it to something serious and profitable. If in any instance she neglected this, and in any degree joined with them, and spoke any thing which on reflection she thought to be too light and unprofitable, she would with sorrow condemn and humble herself before God. Her chief enjoyment in company was with her christian friends; and when she was with them and little or no religious conversa∣tion took place, it would be matter of grief, shame and lamentation to her. Few have their tongues so much under a bridle, as she had; yet she often lamented that it was not more so.</P>
<P>She had a deep, abiding, and increasing con∣viction and sense of the evil of sin, as being en∣mity against God, and all that is truly good;
<PB N="369" REF="035636_0185_10061585764EB1D8"/>
and of the exceeding depravity and wickedness of her own heart, and felt herself wholly undone and lost, if left to herself; that she deserved to be cast off and made miserable forever, and that God would be most just in casting her into endless destruction; that she depended wholly for salvation on the sovereign mercy of Him, who has mercy on whom he will have mercy; that a heart to embrace the gospel, and every degree of right exercise of heart was the gift of God, of which she was infinitely unworthy; and that she depended on the same sovereign grace for the continuance in the exercise of grace; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be kept from falling, and to be made per∣fect in holiness. She therefore trusted in Christ alone as her redeemer and sanctifier. He was infinitely honorable, excellent and precious in her sight, on whose atonement, merit, righteous∣ness, wisdom and power she relied, as every way sufficient for her pardon and complete salva∣tion. This is abundantly expressed in her dia∣ry. She felt the power of these truths to form her to a willing obedience to Christ, and ear∣nestly to desire perfect conformity to the holy law of God, and his moral image and character, knowing that she could not be completely hap∣py till she awaked in the likeness of Christ.</P>
<P>She highly esteemed those who appeared the true ministers of the gospel, for their work's sake, and was liberal in her contributions for the support of public worship and the preach∣ing of the gospel, knowing it was ordained by Christ, that they who preach the gospel, should live of the gospel. It is known that in this
<PB N="370" REF="035636_0186_100615870384FC58"/>
matter she was willing to her power, and even beyond it; and that she often gave more to this end, than many wealthy persons of the same congregation. And she used her influence to excite others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o contribute. And when she was wholly dependent on her friends for a support, and unable to attend public worship, if she had more given to her than she want∣ed for her present supply and comfort, she would give a part of it for the support of the gospel; and would say, she presumed her friends who kindly ministered for the supply of her wants would be willing that she should have the satisfaction of contributing her two mites for the support of the gospel ministry, when she had any thing to spare.</P>
<P>Mrs. Osborn had an uncommon concern to do justice to all with whom she had any deal∣ings, in all respects, both in the sight of men, and before God. In this she was conscientious, and constantly exercised herself with great care and circumspection to have a conscience void of offence towards men, always keeping what she called the golden rule in her view, desiring to do to others, as she would they should do to her. This appears in a clear and striking light in her diary.</P>
<P>And she not only did justice, but loved mer∣cy. She gladly embraced every opportunity to relieve the wants and distresses of others, when in her power, and would often run ventures, and strip herself of what she really wanted, to relieve others who appeared to her to be in greater want. When she was dependent on
<PB N="371" REF="035636_0186_100615870384FC58"/>
others for support, and she had any thing in her hand which she could spare, she took delight in relieving the poor in distress, knowing that her benefactors were willing she should enjoy this pleasure, which was much greater to her, than to use it for herself. In this way she was al∣ways laying up a treasure in heaven, and became rich towards God.</P>
<P>Mrs. Osborn was a kind and <HI>faithful</HI> friend. She was a true friend to all, even to those who acted an unfriendly part to her, and injured her. But her heart was united in a peculiar manner and degree to those who appeared to be friends to Christ. These were her chosen associates and companions, in whom she had great delight. And all her christian friends might place the greatest confidence in her, and use the utmost freedom without giving offence; and trust any secret with her, with the greatest safety, without the least fear of being betrayed, or that it would be communicated to any one. She had a number of intimate friends, with whom she conversed with great openness, free∣dom and pleasure, finding, on acquaintance, that she could safely rely on their candor, friendship, prudence and fidelity. Among these Miss Susa Anthony, whose life has lately been published, was the first, and her greatest inti∣mate, whom she highly esteemed and loved, as an eminent christian, of uncommon discerning and judgment; and whom she found to be a most faithful, prudent friend, at all times. There was a distinguished and eminently christ∣ian and happy friendship enjoyed and cultivat∣ed
<PB N="372" REF="035636_0187_10061588B71F5018"/>
between them, for about fifty years, without any interruption, and to their great mutual comfort and helpfulness.—They were truly, and in a distinguished degree, of one heart and one soul, and during the whole time loved each other with a pure heart, fervently. It is not known or believed that there is to be found, or has been in this century such a union and hap∣py christian friendship between two such emi∣nent christians, for so long a time, as took place in this instance. What fervent prayers and praises did they pour out before God for each other, when separate! What hearty and sweet counsel did they take together, giving mutual advice and assistance, under their various trials, burdens, difficulties and doubts, while they o∣pened their hearts and feelings, in full confi∣dence in each other! With what fervor, freedom and pleasure, did they two join in devotion, by pouring out their hearts before God, when they had opportunities! With what high delight and rapture have they met among the spirits of the just made perfect, where, free from all sin and sorrow, their long continued friendship in this world, is made perfect with an assurance that it will increase in happiness and last forever, in the favor and presence of Him, whom they love with all their hearts, and is their everlasting portion! Here we are lost, and must wait till the curtain of mortality be dropped, to have a perfect knowledge and enjoyment of that felic∣ity and glory of which we have now ideas so dark and very imperfect. Blessed are they
<PB N="373" REF="035636_0187_10061588B71F5018"/>
who are not slothful, but followers of them, who, through faith and patience, now inherit the promises!</P>
<P>AFTER Mrs. Osborn had laid by her pen for a number of years, through the defect of her eye sight, and debility of body and mind, her thoughts unaccountably turned upon meditating on divine subjects, in verse or rhyme. This increased upon her, so that she made verses on a number of subjects; and her memory retained them, while they were not written, so that she could rehearse them dis∣tinctly, when she pleased; which she did to some of her intimate friends. They were pleased with them, not for their elegance and poetry; for to this she made no pretension; but for the sentiments, as expressed by <HI>her,</HI> and flowing from her heart, without any speculative study: And some of them were written from her mouth.</P>
<P>Her mind became more and more engaged in this way, which she found to be entertaining and profitable to herself. At length she thought of attempting to resume her pen, and write her verses on several subjects, though she knew she was not a poet, and had never before attempted any thing of the kind. She found herself able to write, beyond any thing she, or her friends, had ever expected, and wrote so much on a number of subjects, many of which she had be¦fore
<PB N="374" REF="035636_0188_1006158B353F5130"/>
composed in her mind, and retained in her memory, that, if collected together, they would make a considerable volume.</P>
<P>As this was, in several respects, an extraordi∣nary event, and these writings express the de∣vout exercises of her heart, in a manner differ∣ent from her diary, the following is here in∣serted as a specimen of the whole.</P>

<L>WHAT goodness this, which God extends</L>
<L>To us, who once were not his friends!</L>
<L>Compassion had on whom he would,</L>
<L>Though we did evil as we could.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Infinite love! 'Tis all divine;</L>
<L>God's wisdom form'd the vast design;</L>
<L>His pow'r has kept and brought us in,</L>
<L>Through all the assaults of hell and sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now we shall forever gaze</L>
<L>On God, and his perfections praise;</L>
<L>We shall be like him more and more;</L>
<L>Th' Incomprehensible adore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No hateful sin, or weariness,</L>
<L>Shall cause us any more distress.</L>
<L>To do God's will with Seraph's joy,</L>
<L>Shall ever be our sweet employ.</L>

<L>Ye dear companions here at rest,</L>
<L>With love sincere in every breast,</L>
<L>We now will cordially embrace,</L>
<L>Without a blush in any face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more misunderstandings here;</L>
<L>No misconstruction now we fear;</L>
<L>No censures hard, those bitter roots,</L>
<L>Which cast out love and blast its fruits.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No envy now, or selfishness,</L>
<L>Will e'er again our souls possess;</L>
<L>Benevolence shall sweetly flow:</L>
<L>We felt too little when below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No prejudice shall make us stand</L>
<L>Aloof, as in that foreign land;</L>
<L>Because when there we could not see,</L>
<L>We in essentials did agree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We surely did, since we are here,</L>
<L>Where none but friends to Christ appear;</L>
<L>And now our God hath brought us home,</L>
<L>We ever will rejoice as one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O here's no trace of discontent;</L>
<L>Not one who murmurs in his tent:</L>
<L>Nor are there any fiery darts,</L>
<L>Ever to break or vex our hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O precious blood, that once was spilt,</L>
<L>To cleanse our souls from all their guilt;</L>
<L>By which we are indeed made free,</L>
<L>Our souls from sin at liberty.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="376" REF="035636_0189_1006158D2472FE60"/>
<L>O this gives joy its fullest tide,</L>
<L>That out Redeemer's glorify'd;</L>
<L>With satisfaction views the whole,</L>
<L>The fruitful travail of his soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye who are now before our eyes,</L>
<L>Who were on earth our enemies,</L>
<L>We bless the Lord that you 're forgiv'n,</L>
<L>And are arrived safe in heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For this we gave the Lord no rest,</L>
<L>And he has answer'd our request;</L>
<L>For which we magnify his grace,</L>
<L>And join with you to sing his praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye worthy friends, who did relieve</L>
<L>Our pinching wants, ye now receive</L>
<L>The great reward Christ promis'd you;</L>
<L>Ten thousand thanks to God most true.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now grateful love our souls doth cheer,</L>
<L>That we enjoy your presence here:</L>
<L>You did it for King Jesus' sake,</L>
<L>And of his joy you do partake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye sweet acquaintance, christian friends,</L>
<L>Partakers of our joys and pains,</L>
<L>How oft by you did God afford</L>
<L>Relief to us from his own word!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your tender sympathy and love</L>
<L>Did oft to us as cordials prove;</L>
<L>By sweet reproofs, and fervent prayer,</L>
<L>Ye kindly did our burthens bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="377" REF="035636_0189_1006158D2472FE60"/>
<L>In sore temptations, sharp and long,</L>
<L>You faithful held the Lord, and strong:</L>
<L>The great atonement all complete,</L>
<L>The promises most sure and sweet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ten thousand welcomes to this state,</L>
<L>Each other we congratulate,</L>
<L>And now our work shall all be praise</L>
<L>Through an eternity of days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though bonds of nature now do cease,</L>
<L>Our happiness it does increase,</L>
<L>To see our godly parents here,</L>
<L>And relatives to Christ most dear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can we review God's providence,</L>
<L>And yet retain no grateful sense</L>
<L>Of all your love and tender care,</L>
<L>Us for this heaven to prepare?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Do we not know you? Yes, we do,</L>
<L>No ign'rance hides you from our view:</L>
<L>The leaks in mem'ry are all stopp'd</L>
<L>Since we our imperfections dropp'd.</L>
</LG>

<L>What multitudes are there which rise</L>
<L>To fill our souls with sweet surprise?</L>
<L>It is the charming infant race,</L>
<L>Brought here thro' rich and sovereign grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These little ones were born again,</L>
<L>And did believe in Christ, 'tis plain:</L>
<L>God's Spirit wrought the work; but how</L>
<L>On earth we could not fully know.</L>

<L>Glory to God, that now we see</L>
<L>Nothing's too hard for Deity:</L>
<L>These were the lambs, whom Christ caress'd,</L>
<L>Took in his holy arms and bless'd.</L>

<LG>
<L>Thanks be to him his word was giv'n</L>
<L>"Of such the kingdom is of heav'n,"</L>
<L>Now they behold his glory too:</L>
<L>Sweet babes we do rejoice with you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>New wonders still! Lo, here are they,</L>
<L>Unjustly brought from Africa!</L>
<L>They've heard the gospel's joyful sound,</L>
<L>Though lost indeed they now are found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those we see here who once have been</L>
<L>Made slaves to man by horrid sin.</L>
<L>Now through rich grace in Christ are free,</L>
<L>Forever set at liberty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thanks be to God, though not to man,</L>
<L>'Twas he who laid this glorious plan</L>
<L>From evil great, this good to bring</L>
<L>All glory to our God and King.</L>
</LG>

<L>Hail Ministers of Jesus' name,</L>
<L>Who this salvation did proclaim;</L>

<L>What saints are these with crowns we see,</L>
<L>Of joy and immortality?</L>
<L>Gladly we find they are the same</L>
<L>Who out of tribulation came.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The holy prophets who did die</L>
<L>Because they truth did prophesy.</L>
<L>Apostles bless'd, and Martyrs, slain</L>
<L>Because Christ's truth they did maintain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We know that these the world did hate;</L>
<L>But Christ has made them rich and great</L>
<L>He promis'd them this great reward,</L>
<L>And we adore the faithful Lord.</L>

<LG>
<L>New scenes arise. Let us attend:</L>
<L>Here's Abr'am's seed, God's ancient friend.</L>
<L>We see God's covenant was sure,</L>
<L>And did from age to age endure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All these have had repentance giv'n,</L>
<L>The true Messiah own'd from heav'n.</L>
<L>His promises they did embrace,</L>
<L>And now behold his glorious face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That very blood by them was spilt,</L>
<L>Which truly wash'd away their guilt;</L>
<L>Glory to God! we see the Jew:</L>
<L>We, Gentiles, do rejoice with you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Transporting scene! All is delight!</L>
<L>Throngs numberless are in our sight,</L>
<L>Of every kindred, tongue and size,</L>
<L>To overwhelm us with surprise.</L>

<L>When Christ a thousand years did reign,</L>
