<P>An Address to the El∣ders of the Church, upon the oc∣casion of some Friends compelling certain Persons, and their posterity, to serve them continually and arbitraryly, without Regard to E∣quity or Right, not heeding whe∣ther they give them any thing near so much as their Labour de∣serveth.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004149_0006_1003DCBAA37623E8"/>
<HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Dear Beloved Friends, and Elder Brethren, whom as it behoves me, I would intreat as Fathers, a waighty Concern from the Lord, is and hath been at times for many Years on my Spirit, in consideration of this unchristian Liberty, being indulged in the Church, for it is in itself none of the least of the World's Co∣ruptions,</HI> [no, say I, but the greatest, that ever the Devil brought into the Church in <HI>America;] and indeed the Lord by his Spirit, manifested the Evil to me before I was</HI> 12 <HI>Years of Age, and since from time to time, I have had drawings in mind to re∣prove and testify against it, nor have I been altogether silent, altho' much discourag'd by reason of it's being practiced by so many Friends, yea Elders too, and tho' I have formerly thought it strange, that the Church did not exclude it, by her dis∣cipline, and fix the Judgment of Truth upon it, yet now I am sensible such a thing is not easily done or accomplished, there be∣ing so strong opposition in many, that it cannot be brought to the Test, and Judg∣ment brought forth into Victory in the cause at present, without danger of much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rife and disorder in the Church, which is
<PB N="8" REF="004149_0007_1003B98AA09C28E8"/>
generally hurtful where-ever it prevaileth; therefore to be carefully avoided; however I hope we are all unanimous in our judge∣ment, that whatever Friend hath any thing from the movings of the Spirit of Truth to communicate to his Brethren, either by word or writing concerning this or any other matter, ought to be allowed and received in his Testimony, and borne with by his Brethren, so long as he keeps to the counsel and direction of the Holy Spirit, and therefore delivers nothing but what is according to Truth, altho' it hap∣pens to be never so contrary to the interest or inclinations of the Readers or Hearers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now I would such Friends as Practice or Plead for the abovesaid Sin, Evil or Liberty, to consider sollidly what Hardship they impose on such as are concern'd to bear Testimony against it; for while so many Friends continues in said Practice, no one can reprove it, and give it that deserved Character, which is agreeable to it's na∣ture, without implicitly condemning many of his Brethren,</HI> [Ministers and all say I, for they are the worst Enemies in this case the Church has to War with, or that Hell itself, or Devil can procure in this case. (This is very pinching, <HI>B. L.</HI> canst thou prove thy Allegations?) if
<PB N="9" REF="004149_0008_1003DD7C6D814AC0"/>
not, what will become of thee? Never fear, Friend; Fear suprises, thou knows who; but the Truth is stronger than all the Powers of Hell. Blessed for ever is the God of Truth, the Truth of God, the Truth which is God: So be it, saith my Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren and Elder Brethren, as Transgressors in this Thing, which is very hard to do, yet if the Lord require such a Thing or Testimony of any Friend he is ne∣cessitated so to judge his Brethren, or quench the Spirit in its Motions, in his own Heart; for the case admits of no medium. Again I intreat those who slights and dis∣regards the Testimony of any whom the Lord concerns to appear against this fleshly Liberty, to consider whom thy oppose, and withstand; and the inspired Apostle speak∣ing concerning the Lord's Instruments, whom he was pleased to make use of, saith</HI> 1 Thess. iv. 8. <HI>He therefore that des∣piseth, despiseth not Men, but God, who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit. O! That I could prevail so far with all my dear Brethren, that none would any more plead for or endeavour to defend the aforesaid unjust Practice; neither endeav∣our to shield it from the judgment of Truth. We may do well to remember, the Devil is
<PB N="10" REF="004149_0009_1003DD7E57D27ED8"/>
the Author of all Sin, and Sin is the Transgression of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>No greater nor no better Law, say I, than to love God above all, and all our Fellow-Creatures as ourselves; these two contain Law, Prophets and Gospel, do to all as we would be done by. No greater Sin Hell can invent, than to prophane and blaspheme the pure and Holy Truth, which is God all in all, and remove God's Creatures made after his own Image, from all the Comforts of Life, and their Country and procure for them, and bring them into all the mi∣series that Dragons, Serpents, Devils, and Hypocrites, can procure and think of; these things are carried on by Chris∣tians, so called, and Ministers too, in the very greatest appearance of Demuri∣ty and Sanctity in the whole World, that ever I read or heard of; God which is the Truth, saith we shall not eat this cursed Fruit; our Ministers say we may eat, and lawfully too; which shall we believe?</P>
<P>We pretend not to love fighting with carnal Weapons, nor to carry Swords by our sides, but carry a worse thing in the Heart, as will I believe appear by and by; what, I pray and beseech you, dear
<PB N="11" REF="004149_0010_1003DD88385DCF40"/>
Friends, by the tender Mercies of our God, to consider, can be greater Hypo∣crisy, and plainer contradiction, than for us as a People, to ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e to bear Arms, or to pay them that do, and yet purchase the Plunder, the Captives, for Slaves at a very great Price, there∣by justifying their selling of them, and the War, by which they were or are obtained; nor doth this satisfy, but their Children also are kept in Slavery, <HI>ad infinitum;</HI> is not this plainly and sub∣stantially trampling the most Blessed and Glorious Testimony that ever was or ever will be in the World, under our Feet, and committing of Iniquity with, both Hands earnestly? Is this the way to convince the poor Slaves, or our Chil∣dren, or Neighbours, or the World? Is it not the way rather to encourage and strengthen them in their Infidelity, and Atheism, and their Hellish Prac∣tice of Fighting, Murthering, killing and Robbing one another, to the end of the World.</P>
<P>My dear Friends, I beg, I would in∣treat, in all Humility, with all earnest∣ness of mind, on the bended Knees of my Body and Soul; willingly and with all readiness, sincerely, if that would
<PB N="12" REF="004149_0011_1003DD8ECDC96758"/>
do, that you would turn to the Lord, the Blessed Truth, in your Hearts, for Direction, for Counsel and Advice; that you may quit your selves like Men, honourably, of this so Hellish a Prac∣tice. Especially, you that have the Word of Reconciliation to preach to the Children of Men; and if you have any true tenderness of the Love of God in you, as I right well know, blessed be the Name of the Lord, all true Minis∣ters have, you my dear Friends, consider waightily of these important concerns, and quit yourselves of yourselves and Slaves; for a good example in you might do a great deal of good, as a bad one will do, and has done a very great deal of mis∣chief to the Truth; for the Eyes of the People are upon you, some for good, and some for Evil.</P>
<P>And my Friends, you that have Saves, and do minister to others in our Meetings, consider I intreat and beseech you concerning this thing in particular. What Burthens and Afflic∣tions, Bondage, and sore Captivity you bring upon your dear and tender Friends, and keep them in, which cannot touch with this vile and Hellish Practice, but are constrained to bear Testi∣mony against it, as one the greatest
<PB N="13" REF="004149_0012_1003B997C0A469D8"/>
Sins in the World, all things considered: And against you too in some sort, as be∣ing in the practice yourselves, of that which is directly opposite to your own Pretensions, and a very great stumbling Block in the way of honest, godly In∣quirers, which want Peace to their Souls.</P>
<P>What a great Strait these tender hearted mourning Souls must needs be in, think ye, betwixt Love and Duty; they love you dearly for the Truth sake, and yet think it their Duty abso∣lutely in the Fear and Love of God, to testifie against the Sin, and you for con∣tinuing in it.</P>
<P>Dear Friends, what Peace can you have, in thus afflicting your Fellow Members; even the same Testimony they have with you in Meetings, where is the Blessed Unity and Fellowship, you have been preaching so many Years, as being sensible of one anothers exercises, Bearers of one another's Burthens, hav∣ing a deep sence and feeling of others infirmities, or afflictions, or troubles.</P>
<P>What is become of this blessed ex∣perience, my Friends? is it all lost as to you, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so I must give my judgment, that you? have not your constant dwelling in him, that was touched with a feel∣ing
<PB N="14" REF="004149_0013_1003DD98ABA79D08"/>
of our infirmities, tempted in all cases like unto us, yet without Sin; and so are his Saints, for they are all of one, and they live with him Night and Day, in his blessed Kingdom, which is within; and they love him dearly, they cannot avoid it, for he first loved them or us, and we cannot keep back our love from him any more than we can hinder, or stop the Rivers and Streams from running into the <HI>Ocean:</HI> For we having received all from him, of course all re∣turn or run to him again; it is the na∣ture of his essence or divine being.</P>

<P><HI>W. B.</HI> In his Preface, mentions some∣thing of the Lord's dealing with him, when he was about about 10 or 12 Years of Age, which I suppose is about 50 Years ago, then there was much Dis∣course about many <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> People, being taken into <HI>Turky,</HI> or by the <HI>Turks</HI> into Slavery, and sold in the Mar∣ket, for Term of Life, as Beasts in the Field. As our brave Christians so call'd do, and have done for many Years in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and elsewhere in <HI>America,</HI> by the poor Negroes, which is ten times worse in us; all things consider'd; but what crying, wringing of Hands, what Mourning and Lamentations there was then by their Relations, Wives for their Husbands, Parents for their Children, Relations for their Friends, one Neigh∣bour for another! what exclaiming against the <HI>Turk</HI> for his Tyranny and oppression, and cruel Dealing and Treatment, to∣wards their Friends, and may be cursing and calling for Damnation to him and his God too.</P>
<P>Well my Friends, consider of it, and make an Application suitable to the circumstance of your own Slaves; for I do not believe in my Soul, the <HI>Turks</HI> are
<PB N="16" REF="004149_0015_1003DDA20F8F3B08"/>
so cruel to their Slaves, as many Chris∣tians, so called, are to theirs, by what I have seen and heard of, in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and elsewhere; and I give you a reason for it. I was near 18 Months, on board a large Vessel of 400 Tons in a Voyage to <HI>Scanderoon</HI> in <HI>Turky,</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Men that had been 17 Years Slaves in <HI>Turky,</HI> and I never did understand by them, that they were so badly used as the poor Negroes are by some called Christians.</P>
<P>Ezra vi. 21, 22.</P>
<P><HI>And the Children of</HI> Israel, <HI>which were come again out of Captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the Heathen of the Land, to seek the Lord God of</HI> Israel, <HI>did eat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And they kept the feast seven Days with joy: For the Lord made them joyful,</HI> that had separated from the filthiness of the Heathen.</P>
<P>It is like there was some, which came out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and out of Captivity in some sort, which nevertheless would not separate themselves from the filthiness of the Heathen. For long custom had made it so familiar, easy and sweet un∣to them, that they would not leave it,
<PB N="17" REF="004149_0016_1003DDA96531CA20"/>
no not for the Joy of the Lord. And some of these were Priests and Levites, for ought we know; for they loved their Heathen Whores, I believe, and other filthiness, which the Heathens allow of, almost as well as our Spiritual Priests and Levites, under the Gospel of Christ, do their Slaves, it is a very plain, parallel case, when neither the one or the other will part with them, no not for the Joy of the Lord. Then to be sure not for the comfort and Joy of their Brethren, and Sisters, who have been in sore Bondage, and Thraldom or Captivity, on that sin∣ful Hellish Account, Slave-keeping, for 50 Years and more; and that by their Brethren and Sisters, which keeps them and will keep them, in spite of them, let them beg or pray, or say, or do what they can or will.</P>
<P>And all this while Preach, as their tender Friends do; who cannot touch with that sinful practice to gain the whole World; profess the same Pure Truth, Gospel, Unction, Annoynting, Urim, and Thumim, Measure of the Spi∣rit, pretend they have received the same Manifestation and Dispensation to preach, as their innocent Friends, Brethren, or Sisters have.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004149_0017_1003DDB1399BD550"/>
And really to give them their due, they come very near them in Words, for what I and some others can see; for we have observed them strictly as is our duty upon the Truths Account, which suffers so much by them, and their sin∣ful practice, as well as their oppressed, and greatly afflicted Brethren and Sisters.</P>
<P>I say these Nocents, come very near the Innocents in Words, except here and there, they do stretch and strain, rest, part, pervert, misconstrue, and mis∣apply Scripture to serve their covetous Ends, or to justifie the Practice, or to extenuate the Crime. If these things be done by them in∣tentionally,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matt.</HI> xxiii. 13, 14.</NOTE> we may say, with∣out Breach of Charity. They shall receive the greater Damnation; as Christ himself said in a case almost as bad.</P>
<P>Many worthy Men have borne Testi∣mony against this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul Sin, Slave-keep∣ing, by Word and Writing; some of which I have noted elsewhere; but es∣pecially <HI>Ralph Sandiford,</HI> amongst many others, has writ excellently well, against that filthy Sin; far beyond what I can or do pretend to, being a Man of so very
<PB N="19" REF="004149_0018_1003DDB935DD4E80"/>
mean a capacity, and little Learning; but as I firmly believing it to be my duty, in the sight of God; I endeavour to do what I can and leave the Event to the Lord.</P>
<P>And as for any Slave-keepers, who are not impartial in the case; to say that <HI>R. S.</HI> writ in a Spirit of Bitterness, or that he did not end his Life well. As to the first I have read his Book carefully, with Attention; and I do not remember a Word in it contrary to Truth, or any such sharp invectives, as may easily be found in Holy Scripture, both Old and New Testament; altho' I have, it's true, because, I believe in my very Soul the cause does require it, for the nature of those Beasts, is in those Men, which do trade in Slaves; and much worse.</P>
<P>As to the second objection, that he <HI>R. S.</HI> did not end well; let such be intreated to remember the Man of God, that was sent by the Lord, from <HI>Judah,</HI> to declare against the Altar; or that of <HI>Bethel,</HI> and the Miracles wrought by him, the King's Hand withering, and restored by his Prayer; the Altar split∣ing, and since that his Prophesy fulfill∣ed; of Men's Bones, being offered or Burnt thereon.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004149_0019_1003B9B090477EE8"/>
And yet this Man of God, never came to the Supulchers of his Fathers, by reason an old lying Prophet leading him out of the way. So was flain by a Lyon▪</P>
<P><HI>Judah'</HI>s Prophet, had but one Hypo∣critical lying old Prophet, that we read of, to lead him out of the way. But <HI>R. S.</HI> had, and we now have, abundance of Old and Young pretended Prophet's Prophets to lead us, poor Creatures, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the way.</P>
<P>And so they will many, unwary Souls; except the Lord our God b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleased to open our Eyes, to see the Hellish Cheat, and devilish Delusion; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which many of our poor Friends have been seduced, and lead aside in the Hellish Darkness or Smoak, of the Bot∣tomless Pit; for whom my very Soul i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grieved. <HI>God Almighty is my Witness.</HI></P>
<P>The 8<HI>th Mo.</HI> 1736. <HI>Benjamin Lay.</HI></P>
<P><HI>R.

find in it; he was a very tender hearted Man before he came amongst Friends, as well as after, as I have heard from ma∣ny honest Friends, that had much deal∣ing, and intimate Conversation with him, for many Years, which are now living. But before he died, by reason of his sore Affliction of mind, concerning Slave-keeping, as in his Book largely appear, and Infirmity of Body, he fell into a sort of Delirium: However I do believe if he had lived he would have overcame it; for I went to see him se∣veral times, a little before he died; I am not ashamed, nor afraid, to write it, altho' I be censured for it, as I have been with some others, for going to see him, altho' in Affliction, the only time for Visiting, as I humbly conceive, if we go in a right mind.</P>
<P>But O! Say the Slave-keepers, and must confess in their Hearts that Book, <HI>The Mystery of Iniquity,</HI> as it is call'd, and titled; it tells Tales to the World, sets forth to the World's People, what a Parcel of Hypocrites, and Deceivers we are, under the greatest appearance and Pretentions to Religion and Sanctity that ever was in the World; we'll cen∣sure him, and his Book too, into the
<PB N="22" REF="004149_0021_1003DDCABB75D510"/>
Bottomless Pit, if we can, tho' we can't disprove a Word in it, for it's undeni∣able Truth, and so unanswerable; for we never understood, that any one ever attempted it, or so much as spake of it; but what of that, Brethren, if it be sin∣ful we are in the Iniquity, in the prac∣tice of Slave-keeping; and our Children by our means, incouragement, and ap∣pointment, not only so, but our Fathers before us, worthy Men, in their genera∣ting Work; and some of them Minis∣ters and Elders, with all Men of re∣nown. They found the sweetness of it, and so do we, and we will continue in it; let who will or dare say nay; we'll condemn <HI>R.</HI> in his Grave, and his Book and all that favour it, or promote its being spread abroad, or being read, that exposes us, and we'll expose that, or especially him that writ it, by Cal∣lumnies and Slanders, and Surmises, and by insinuating all that ever we can hear or think of against him, now he is in his Grave; especially we did it before, but now more safely, for he can't contradict or oppose us now; so that if we can but render him odious in his Character, his Book will be invalidated in course with us that hate it, altho' we cannot disprove
<PB N="23" REF="004149_0022_1003DDD1667AC4E0"/>
a tittle of it, especially with our Brethren in strict Unity, in this Iniquity, and foulest of Sins, the Negroe Trade.</P>
<P>If this practice can be proved to be the greatest of Sins (as may easily be done) considering it's Root and Branch, and all the sad Fruit it brings forth; yet we read Christ died for Sinners, and he can forgive the greatest, as well as the least.</P>
<P>It is true some may say, Christ in his great Love, hath forgiven Sins, com∣mitted in time of great Darkness and Ignorance; but if we should commit the grossest of evils now, in the clear light of this Gospel Day, continue in them, and plead for it too, we should with∣stand spiritual <HI>Moses,</HI> and our Damnati∣on would be just.</P>
<P>Some indeed may insinuate this Chapter against us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Numbers</HI> xvi.</NOTE> but what if <HI>Korah</HI> the Son of <HI>Izhar,</HI> did with his Company 250 with∣stand <HI>Moses,</HI> they were Princes of the Assembly, famous in the Congregation, Men of renown, as we are many of us: What if <HI>Moses</HI> did fall on his Face, and weep before the Lord, with <HI>Aaron</HI> and others? And if the Lord threatened to to destroy the whole Company; What
<PB N="24" REF="004149_0023_1003DDDD5945DD28"/>
of that? he did not: What if the Earth did open, and swallow up <HI>Korah,</HI> and a Fire from the Lord consumed others; yet we may take notice, the Congregation were not pleased; the rebellious party, for they murmured against <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> saying, <HI>Ye, have killed the Lord's People, or People of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>It is also true, there was 14700 slain by the Plague, of the Murmurers and Rebels, beside them that died about the matter of <HI>Korah.</HI> But it is not, nor hath been so with us as yet, and we have been in this practice, that some few poor Fellows, make such a stir a∣bout, above 50 Years; poor People which cannot purchase them, so pretend Conscience in the case, but let them that oppose our practice in Negroes, bring those things upon us as above∣mentioned; if they can, then People may believe they are in the Right, and we in the Wrong.</P>
<P>But let us consider by the way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matt.</HI> xli. xxvii, xlii, xliii.</NOTE> Brethren, if we go on ar∣guing after this manner, some may be ready to object, that Blasphemous Saying of our Elder Brethren, concerning Christ: <HI>If he be the King of</HI> Israel, <HI>let him now come down
<PB N="25" REF="004149_0024_1003B9BE28E6FA50"/>
from the Cross, and we will believe in him.</HI> It is true the Objection is just, and it may be a Parallel Case: But what shall we do, for People begin to see as clearly as when the Sun is in its Meridian Throne, young People as well as old, That this Practice of ours is as directly opposite to our holy Principles as Light is to Darkness, Christ to <HI>Belial,</HI> or God to the Devil.</P>
<P>If the Case be thus, dear Brethren, as to be sure it is, how shall we stand our Ground? our Ground, I say. It is true we may keep our Meeting-Houses for a time, and we may join Forces with them that are in the Negro Practice; in strict Unity among our selves, and with any other dear Friends of our own Mind, Relations, Customers, Chapmen, Work∣men, or others that we can have any In∣fluence over, Quakers or no Quakers, if they will but come to Meetings and do as we do, if not, say as we say, and plead for said sad Hell-Practice; or at least, Gentleman-like, connive, palliate and dissemble to extenuate the Crime; and we will with all our Might, Interest and Strength, put forth, keep out, and hin∣der or prevent coming into our Syna∣gogues, any that will oppose or condemn
<PB N="26" REF="004149_0025_1003DDE68208ACF8"/>
our Practice, or us for continuing in it. And further, as we have the Power of Discipline, our Ministers are forc'd, and must of Necessity come to us for Certi∣ficates or Letters to recommend them, which we are very ready to give if they are fit for our Turn and Practice, and very good ones too. If they be but ve∣ry poorly qualified in Words, and worse in Conduct and Life, yet they'll serve a small Turn. When he or she have got their Passport, one or other of us, a trusty Brother without Doors, will give them the Hint before they go forth, that if they should chance to meet, or go on purpose where they are to be found or heard of, any of the heavenly Party that is against our hellish Practice (or hellish Party that is against our heavenly Prac∣tice, for it is heavenly to us, it is Com∣fort and Joy to us, and we delight in it greatly and will keep in it) and may be, <HI>My dear Friend, we will give thee a little Memorandum in thy Pocket of Places and Persons, which will be a great Help to thee, poor dear Creature, thy dear Mind being so much exercised about other good Things, that thou mayst chance to forget some other Matters though they be weighty: And wherever thou meets with any such as are
<PB N="27" REF="004149_0026_1003DDE9976D19D0"/>
abovemention'd, when thee comes near their Dwellings, which thee may chance to hear of by strict Inquiry, inform Friends against them whatever thee can; tho' the Name of an Informer be odious, yet in some Cases it is thought necessary, as in this: But be sure when thou comes in thy Testimony, thresh 'em going, spare 'em not; and if any speak to thee after Meeting about it, say,</HI> If the Coat fits thee, put it on; I had no Particular in View. This is and has been the Practice of many worthy Friends, so they hide themselves, and strengthen our Party bravely; so be it, say they.</P>
<P>Matth. vii. 17. <HI>Every good Tree bring∣eth good Fruit, but a corrupt Tree bringeth evil Fruit.</HI> Is there any eviler Fruit in the World than Slave-keeping? any thing more devilish? it is of the very Nature of Hell itself, and is the Belly of Hell.</P>
<P>Verse 18. <HI>A good Tree cannot bring forth</HI> such cursed <HI>evil Fruit</HI> as Slave-tra∣ding, if this Practice be the worst, the greatest Sin in the World (with what goes and grows with it) as it is, to be sure. But if any should say that good Trees, good Men, may be in this Prac∣tice and encourage it, and if they may
<PB N="28" REF="004149_0027_1003DDEDA1C76278"/>
bring forth such Fruit, what Fruit must evil Trees bring forth. This will not hold by a Parity of Reason; comparing Things with Things by an Equality, it will not hold good in any Case, much less in a religious Sense; there it is very odious, to be sure, and is very foul in Ministers especially. Let them keep on their Sheeps Cloathing, and preach and pray as long as they may, until their Tongues are weary, and their Hearers Ears too; they'll preach more to Hell, I firmly believe, than they will to Hea∣ven, while they continue in said Prac∣tice.</P>
<P>For Custom in Sin, hides, covers, as it were takes away the Guilt of Sin. Long Custom, the Conveniency of Slaves wor∣king for us, waiting and tending conti∣nually on us, beside the Washing, clean∣ing, scouring, cooking very nicely fine and curious, sewing, knitting, darning, almost ever at hand and Command; and in other Places milking, churning, Cheese-making, and all the Drudgery in Dairy and Kitchin, within doors and without. And the proud, dainty, lazy Daughters sit with their Hands before 'em, like some of the worst idle Sort of Gentlewomen, and if they want a Trifle,
<PB N="29" REF="004149_0028_1003B9CB1F1B8040"/>
rather than rise from their Seats, call the poor Slave from her Drudgery to come and wait upon them. These Things have been the utter Ruin of more than a few; and yet encouraged by their own Parents, for whom my Spirit is grieved, some of which were and are Preachers in great Repute, as well as others.</P>
<P>Now, dear Friends, behold a Mystery! These Ministers that be Slave-keepers, and are in such very great Repute, such eminent Preachers, given to Hospitality, charitable to the Poor, loving to their Neighbours, just in their Dealings, tem∣perate in their Lives, visiting of the Sick, sympathising with the Afflicted in Body or Mind, very religious seemingly, and extraordinary devout and demure, and in short strictly exact in all their Deco∣rums, except Slave-keeping, these, these be the Men, and the Women too, for the Devil's purpose, and are the choi∣cest Treasure the Devil can or has to bring out of his Lazaretto, to establish Slave-keeping. By these Satan works Wonders many ways. These are the very Men, or People of both Sexes, that come the nearest the Scribes &amp; Pharisees of any People in the whole World, if not sincere: For the Scribes were exact and
<PB N="30" REF="004149_0029_1003DDF99BCF8D78"/>
demure seemingly in their Appearance before Men, according to Christ's Ac∣count of them, and yet the worst Ene∣mies the dear Lamb had, or that the Devil could procure for or against him. And I do surely believe that one such as these, now in this our Day, in this very Country, does more Service for the De∣vil, and Hurt in the Church, in Slave-keeping, than twenty Publicans and Har∣lots: For by their extraordinary Con∣duct, in Hypocrisy, smooth and plausi∣ble appearance, they draw into the Snare almost insensibly, and so beguile unstable Souls before they are aware, which is sorrowful to consider as well as write, their Example being much more powerful than others.</P>
<P>And Friends, what I touched at a lit∣tle before, concerning the delicate Dam∣sels, or fine idle Dames, it may be pret∣ty much like it with the young Men, and may be the old ones, that have their Negroes to Plow, sow, thresh, winnow, split Rails, cut Wood, clear Land, make Ditches and Fences, fodder Cattle, run and fetch up the Horses, or fine cu∣rious pacing Mares, for young Madam and Sir to ride about on, impudently and proudly gossiping from House to House,
<PB N="31" REF="004149_0030_1003DE0498A357B0"/>
stuffing their lazy ungodly Bellies. Then old Sir Master calls, <HI>Negro, fetch my best Gelding quickly, for me to ride to Meeting, to preach the Gospel of glad Tydings to all Men, and Liberty to the Captives, and o∣pening the Prison-Doors to them that are bound; but I'll keep thee in Bondage never∣theless, help thy self if thee can. I charge thee to work very hard when I am gone, and besure be very ready to wait on me &amp; my Children when we come home, if they come with me, or else wait till they do come, and then take their Horses, and look well after them; and then make haste in, all of ye, and be ready to wait upon us, and keep good Fires above stairs or below, and mind your Business well, or I'll take a Course with you; don't think that I'll give</HI> 70 <HI>or</HI> 80 l. <HI>apiece for you, for nothing but to ly la∣zying about like Gentlemen, doing nothing, you shall work now you are young, for when you are very old, you will not do much, I suppose, and then you must be maintained, you and your Wives and Children and Chil∣dren's Children; and if you dont behave your selves well, you'll be but badly pro∣vided for, I believe, when you are past your Labour, whatever you are now.</HI></P>
<P>Dear Friends, these Things are true in Fact, and have been the Ruin of ma∣ny,
<PB N="32" REF="004149_0031_1003DE0B7B847340"/>
Body and Soul, and will be of more I greatly fear; beside and above all, the foul Stain it brings upon the pure, bles∣sed, unchangeable TRUTH.</P>
<P>And my dear, my very dear Friends, I must say, I must say, and it is the Ex∣perience and certain Knowledge of my own Soul, that except People will be willing to come to a Separation, a Sepa∣ration, a Separation,

they never can nor will see the Evil of it, as it really is in itself.</P>
<P>I say my own Experience when I li∣ved in <HI>Barbadoes</HI> about 18 Years ago, where we had much Business in Trading, and the poor Blacks would come to our Shop and Store, hunger-starv'd, almost ready to perish with Hunger and Sick∣ness, great Numbers of them would come to trade with us, for they seemed to love and admire us, we being pretty much alike in Stature and otherways; and my dear Wife would often be giving them something for the Mouth, which was very engaging you that read this may be sure, in their deplorable Condition. Oh! my Soul mourns in contemplating their miserable, forlorn, wretched State
<PB N="33" REF="004149_0032_1003DE109397A3E8"/>
and Condition that mine Eyes beheld them in then, and it is the same now, and will remain except the great almigh∣ty Being, either immediately or instru∣mentally shall be pleased to put a Stop to it; for they are yearly by Shiploads poured in upon, and received by the People, many Thousands in one Year, Year after Year, as is thought, up and down <HI>America,</HI> besides what vast Num∣bers are encreased by Generation daily. O Lord God Almighty, where will this Practice lead us that are called thy Peo∣ple, Dearest God, and make so great a Profession of being lead and guided by thy eternal Spirit, which is the glorious Truth unchangeable and precious, and without End. But I trust, dearest One, thou wilt be pleased to stop and end this Practice, that is more like Hell than Heaven, to be sure.</P>
<P>I having made a little Digression, may resume the Matter relating to my dear Wife, and the <HI>Negroes.</HI> She was a ten∣der-hearted Woman, and, as I said, would be very often giving them some∣thing or other; stinking Biscuits which sometimes we had in abundance, bitten by the Cockroaches; or rotten Cheese,
<PB N="34" REF="004149_0033_1003B9D8422DF7D8"/>
stinking Meat, decayed Fish which we had plenty of in that hot Country; so my dear sweet <HI>Sarah,</HI> she would hand it to them, here and there to those that she thought wanted it most, tho' all wanted enough, God Almighty knows, except here and there a favourite Slave, one of an hundred or thousand, may be, kept for their Glory and Pride to wait on them, amongst their proud, lazy, dainty, tyrannical, gluttonous, drunken, debau∣ched Visitors, the Scum of the infernal Pit, a little worse than the same that comes off their Sugar when it is boiling, which is composed of Grease, Dirt, Dung, and other Filthiness, as, it may be Limbs, Bowels and Excrements of the poor Slaves, and Beasts, and other Mat∣ters, but this I say serves exceeding well to make Rum of, and Molosses, for that is the Use it is put to, with other Ingre∣dients pretty much like it; and these People in the Islands may laugh at us for being ridiculously infatuated, to send away our excellent good Provisions, and other good Things, to purchase such fil∣thy Stuff, which tends to the Corruption of Mankind, and may be send us some of the worst of their Slaves, when they can∣not rule them themselves, along with
<PB N="35" REF="004149_0034_1003DE1C12C06E28"/>
their Rum, to compleat the Tragedy, that is to say, to destroy the People in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and ruin the Country. Dear Friends, or any of my Fellow-Creatures, I must confess I am apt to di∣gress, but when such dangerous Filthi∣ness comes in my Way, I think it my Duty to make it appear if possible to o∣thers; for it is so to me, exceeding sin∣ful above Measure, I will assure you, more than what I can speak or write a∣bundantly; if it should be so to you, I hope you will endeavour to avoid it, and pray for Heavens Assistance, without which all is nothing. As to what was touched on before, when my dear <HI>Sarah</HI> had given to them what she thought fit within-doors, we have taken some more of the same sort and thrown it into the Street, stinking as to be sure it was, yet the poor Creatures would come running, and tearing, and rending one another, to get a part in the scramble of that which I am sure some Dogs would not touch, much less eat of, their poor Bellies were so empty, and so ravenous were they, that I never saw a parcel of Hounds more eager about a dead Carcase, than they always were. This Scramble was commonly on a First Day, before we went
<PB N="36" REF="004149_0035_1003DE23EE3813B8"/>
to Meeting, which was their Market-day, as well as their Hallowing-Day, when they are exempted from their La∣bour, they come down to Town, many Hundreds of them, they that could get or steal any Thing, a little Sugar, or Cotton, Ginger, Aloes, Rum, Cocoa-Nuts, Pine-Apples, Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, old Iron, Wood for Firing, steal any Thing out of Houses, Yards, or any where, or any Thing that was not too hot or too heavy, and bring it to Market on a Sunday, as they call it, to get a penny, or something for the Mouth, and they that could not get any thing to bring to Market, they would come to Town if possibly they could hold out and keep from falling down and fainting by the Way, being perished with Hun∣ger and hard Labour the Week before; I say these very miserable Objects that could get no Truck in the Country to bring to Market, yet they would if pos∣sible come to Town, and see what they could beg or steal there. (Who can blame them if it was ten times worse, they being under such unmerciful Ty∣rants.) These Wretches being in Town in this miserable Condition, with not a Crum of good or bad to put into their
<PB N="37" REF="004149_0036_1003DE2B1928E330"/>
Mouths, ready to drop as they walked or crawled along the Streets, they ma∣ny of them hearing of us, for we were very much known amongst them, they would come to our Door, if they came before we were gone to Meeting, and there they would stand as thick as Bees, but much more like <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s lean Kine, and I may say their Appearance was dis∣mal enough to move a very hard Heart; so we used to give them a little of some∣thing at Times, as we found some Free∣dom, considering our Circumstances; But if we gave to some, and did not to all, as to be sure we could not, oh how the poor Creatures would look. I say many Hundreds would come and flock about us; and them that receiv'd, O how thankful, with bended Knees; but them that did not, what Words can set forth the dejected sinking Looks that appear∣ed in their Countenances. Shall I ever forget them?</P>
<P>Many of these poor Creatures, in Town and Country, were sent to Mar∣ket by their Masters or Mistresses, at o∣ther Times, and they would come to us to lay out their Money, if we had such Goods as they wanted, and when they came in, seem'd to rejoice to see us to∣gether,
<PB N="38" REF="004149_0037_1003DE3034372060"/>
we were so very much alike; and would lift up their Hands with Admira∣tion, and say, <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle backararar man,</HI> for so they call white People, <HI>go all over world see for that backarar woman for himself.</HI> But we, alas! are parted!</P>
<P>Here Friends you may see and under∣stand the powerful Influence long Cus∣tom, Conveniency, Intimacy, and Profit has to insinuate itself into our Affections; for I have often heard my dear Wife say in her Life-time, and express the Danger she was in when living in <HI>Barba∣does,</HI> of being leavened into the very Nature of the Inhabitants, Pride and Oppression: So that dear Creature, she seeing the Evil and the Danger, she was willing and desirous to leave the Island, and indeed so was I.</P>
<P>But, my Friends, here I must come to that that is not very agreeable to Flesh and Blood, which is Confession of Sins: For although I never was Owner of a Slave myself, and all Friends in <HI>Barba∣does</HI> could never persuade me to pur∣chase one, I humbly bless the Lord my good God for that, and this is now my Comfort and dear Joy and sweet Expe∣rience: Yet I must confess, and I have not full Peace without it, yet I may say
<PB N="39" REF="004149_0038_1003DE391DFFBBB8"/>
I have been sorely grieved to see and hear the inexpressible Cruelty, Torture, and Misery, these poor Wretches were and are put to, Night and Day, yet al∣though, as I have said, I saw and heard of such very great Barbarity used toward the Slaves, Night and Day, yet for want of dwelling near enough to the blessed Truth, I was leavened too much into the Nature of the People there which are Masters and Mistresses of Slaves, though I never had nor would have any of my own, but by conversing, trading, and living daily amongst them, where there is vast Numbers, abundance coming daily to buy Goods and to beg, some to steal, we had abundance stolen from us at Times, the worth of ten, fifteen, or near twenty Shillings at a time, come into the Shop whole Droves together, lay the Scheme I suppose, come by Ap∣pointment; when many are come in they seem in great haste, one would say, <HI>Serve me,</HI> another, <HI>Serve me, serve me;</HI> come sometimes by twilight and within Night, then was their Time; so when we were in a hurry, one would run away with one Thing, another with another, and so on. Very much we lost to be sure. Some∣times I could catch them, and then I
<PB N="40" REF="004149_0039_1003DE3AAD9933D8"/>
would give them Stripes sometimes, but I have been sorry for it many times, and it does grieve me to this Day, consider∣ing the extream Cruelty and Misery they always live under. Oh my Heart has been pained within me many times, to see and hear; and now, now, now, it is so.</P>
<P>Shall we fetch and steal them out of their own Country, where God Almigh∣ty has made them and placed them, and in taking of them murther many, very many, and serve them that we take alive ten times worse; steal Husband from Wife, Wife from Husband; steal the Children from their Parents, bring them here or elsewhere amongst our extraor∣dinary Christians, worse Thieves than the others by far; they work 'em, whip and starve 'em almost to death, and if the poor Wretch steal a little to satisfy Hunger, he is tormented without Mer∣cy. Be these Christians, and Ministers too, that encourage and plead for these Things? It must be all a Lie, and that is of the Devil, <HI>for when he speaketh a Lie, it is of himself.</HI> Joh. viii. 44.

<P>And Friends, you that follow this forlorn filthy Practice, do you not con∣sider that you are opening a Door to o∣thers, or setting them an Example to do the like by you, whenever it shall please the Almighty to suffer them to have Power over us, as a Scourge to us for our Sins, what Reason then shall we

Another Piece of Barbarity, of one <HI>Richard Parrot</HI> a Cooper, which I knew; he used to whip his Negroes on Second-day Mornings very severely, to keep them in awe. It is usual for these miserable Slaves to get together on First-days, to bewail and lament their forlorn Condition that they are in one to ano∣ther. One says, <HI>My Master very bad Man;</HI> another, <HI>My Mistress very bad Wo∣man.</HI> This <HI>Parrot'</HI>s Negro, a lusty Fel∣low, a Cooper, and used to get his Ma∣ster 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> a day, being valued at 100<HI>l.</HI> or more; he says, <HI>My Master</HI> Parrot <HI>very bad Man indeed, whippe whippe poor Ne∣gro evee Munne Morning for notin tall! me no bear no longer.</HI> So he hangs him∣self on First-day at Night, because he would not be <HI>whippee Munne Morning.</HI> This was while we lived in <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> I knew <HI>Parrot</HI> very well, having been at his House; and abundance more of such like Things while we abode there.</P>

<P>As <HI>God gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believed in him might have everlasting Life;</HI> so the Devil gives his only begotten Child, <HI>the Merchandize of Slaves and Souls of Men,</HI> Rev. xviii. 13. that whosoever believes and trades in it might have everlasting Damnation.</P>
<P>Again, it is written, 1 Cor. iv. 15. <HI>though you have ten thousand Instructors in Christ, yet you have not many Fathers,</HI> I may say so, <HI>for in Christ have I begotten you thro' the Gospel;</HI> so may many of our Ministers say to the Negro-Traders and Keepers, You have we begotten thro' the Devil, by our Example and Plead∣ing for it, and by our Condemning and Disowning many worthy Friends, of in∣nocent Lives, for testifying against it, and against us for living and continuing in it; but we will do it for all that. What do we care for their Testimony?

Shall we, our Wives, or Sons, or Daugh∣ters, when our Fellow-Merchants (of <HI>Mystery Babylon the Great</HI>) come to vi∣sit us, run to wait on them, their Hor∣ses, their Chariots and Equipage, Cook∣ing, Sculling and waiting? No, we de∣spise it, and them that do it. We will have our Slaves and Souls of Men to do it for us, as our Mother has and had in all Ages of the World; and it was their Glory, and it is ours, and we will have it; and we, our Wives, Sons, Daugh∣ters, Kindred, and our Fellow-Mer∣chants, that are great and honourable, Men of Renown, shall sit and live like Kings and Queens that know no Sor∣row.</P>
<P>I must confess, that as <HI>Paul</HI> had <HI>begotten one in his Bonds,</HI> for Christ's Sake to Christ; so those abovemention'd have begotten many, yea very many, in their Bonds, for the Devil and <HI>Mammon'</HI>s sake, to the Devil and his Kingdom.</P>

<P>9th Month, 1736, as I sat in <HI>Concord</HI> Meeting House, it was their Quarterly Meeting; I may say it was a sweet and comfortable time to me; it came into
<PB N="54" REF="004149_0053_1003BA191C4820A8"/>
and arose in my mind, in Love of Truth, that if our Slave-Keepers had been, or now would be faithful to God, the Truth, and would bring up their Negroes to some Learning, Reading and Writing, and endeavour to the utmost of their power in the sweet Love of Truth to instruct and teach 'em the prin∣ciples of truth and righteousness, and learn them some Honest Trade or Im∣ployment, and then set them free; and all the time Friends are teaching of them let them know that they intend to let them go free in a very reasonable time: and that our Religious Principle will not allow of such Severity, as to keep them in everlasting Bondage and Slavery.</P>
<P>This might according to my way of thinking, beget such Love and Tender∣ness in them, toward their Masters or Mistresses, and to the blessed Truth for their Sakes; that it might be a means to convince some of them.</P>
<P>And should they come to receive the pure Truth, in the Love of it; as, bles∣sed be the Lord, many of us have, and in that sweet Love, which is constrain∣ing, come under a concern and necessity, to go and visit their Brethren, of their own colour, and Country, and Language,
<PB N="55" REF="004149_0054_1003DE9B37BDE1D8"/>
and preach the Gospel of eternal Salva∣tion unto them, from Sin and Captivity, both of Body and Soul, this would be a glorious work indeed, and well worth our Friends pains, charge and time, that they might spend about it; and the best compensation to God and Man, as I think, that they can possibly make, for being so long in a practice that has so much Wickedness attending of it con∣tinually.</P>
<P><HI>Isa.</HI> 61. 1. As to this Chap. it is very excellently Prophesied of concerning the true anointing, which is the Spirit, and is God, and was in <HI>Isaiah,</HI> and filled him with Love, to <HI>preach good tidings to the Meek,</HI> and is of the same Nature, in all People, in all colours, and Countries.</P>
<P>The many Hundreds of Thousands, that are now in Slavery, were they at Liberty, as we are, had the same Edu∣cation, Learning, Conversation, Books, sweet Communion in our Religious As∣semblies; I believe many of them would exceed many of their Tyrant Masters in Piety, Virtue and Godliness; and their bright Genius, which I know they have, would be inlivened; for I have converst with many of them, for Liberty is Life, and Slavery is Death, nay the very
<PB N="56" REF="004149_0055_1003DE9CDBCDCC40"/>
thoughts of it to a right thinking Ani∣mal, as Man or Woman.</P>
<P><HI>Isa.</HI> 61. 1. Is this <HI>preaching glad tide∣ings to the meek,</HI> as many of them are, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind up the broken hearted; to pro∣claim Liberty to the Captives, and opening of the Prison, to them that are bound;</HI> and yet keep them in double Bondage, Body and Soul, them and theirs for ever more. If there be greater contradiction under the Sun; many dear and tender Friends are mistaken, as well as myself.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 2. But how does Slave Merchants, <HI>proclaim the acceptable Year of the Lord?</HI> to their Slaves <HI>the Day of Vengeance</HI> they may, and a long Day it is; but I believe the Lord will repay it, tho' he suffers it long: But I pray and beseech you; you hard-hearted Ministers, of all persuasions in Church and State, that are Christians; how do you comfort all that mourn, and are in Misery, as great for aught I can learn as any are that be under the very worst of <HI>Turks, Jews</HI> or <HI>Infidels,</HI> in the known World.</P>
<P>But my dear and tender Friends, how does this cruelty and partiality agree with our principles as a People, which have been preaching up Perfection in holiness of Life, for near a Hundred Years,

<P>IF Two-Weeks Meeting had had any thing material against me, or Month∣ly Meeting; they should have appeal'd to Quarterly Meeting before we came away▪ But some Friends have been the Instruments of the Death of my Dear Wife I believe.

How many profuse, profli∣gate Creatures, have come in Servants to this Country, which have been stated not only as Members, but Ministers in full Unity, in less time then I have been here; is it not intolerable then, that three or four Men that has the Mark of the Beast, and Number of his Name, Slave-Keepers,

<P>WHEN the strong Man armed keeps the House, his Goods are in Peace: Is not this the Devil? is not Hell in the Soul his House? is not all his Goods Sin? is not Slave-Keeping and Trading the greatest Sin in the World, when it is seen in the light of Truth in all its parts? is not Truth the Light stron∣ger then all? and when this appears in the Heart, and shews the Creature, this Capital Sin, and other Sins to be exceed∣ing Sinful; does not the whole Creation, in the poor condemned or damned Crea∣ture groan, to be delivered? then Hell-Torments, the Smoak and Darkness, of the Bottomless Pit arises and appears in the Soul; the Creature by some Glimmering of the Light sees itself in Darkness, feels itself in Hell tormented, then it cries to

Light to appear more and more for its help, and to bind the strong Man armed, the Devil, and cast him out and spoil his Goods, which is Sin, and is the Devil's Furniture in Hell in the Soul, the Devil's House, where he has had his Residence so long; so when the Devil sees he and his Goods is discovered, which had been so long hid, and Ware appears in the Smoak of the Bottomless Pit; and that he is like to lose one, or some of his chief Subjects and strongest Forces; and his Kingdom, Heads, Horns and Crowns are in danger, and all like to be lost; this puts all Hell in the Soul in an uproar.

<P>WHEN I have mildly reasoned with some Friends concerning their Hostility, in carrying a Person or Friend, if I may call him so, out of Meetings so often, and keeping of him out by Constable and other ways; as at <HI>Philadelphia, Burlington</HI> and <HI>Concord, &amp;c.</HI> without so much as pretending they have used any Gospel Order with him, in any Monthly or Quarterly Meeting, as a dis∣orderly Person.</P>
<P>O But say some, he is a very trouble∣some Person, and has been so for many Years; and is too censorious about Trading in Slaves, or against Traders in, and Keepers of Slavers; And positively affirms, that no Man or Woman, Lad or Lass ought to be suffered, to pretend to Preach Truth in our Meetings, while they live in that Practice; which is all a Lie.</P>
<P>And further, he boldly affirms, that no Person whatsoever has any Right, or ought according to Truths Discipline,
<PB N="64" REF="004149_0063_1003DECB6E14C4A8"/>
to be suffered to have the Rule and Go∣vernment, or any Part of it, in the Church of God, which is the Kingdom of God, while he himself is in League with the Devil, and is managing the Affairs of his Kingdom, which Slave Trading is, as has been proved.</P>
<P>But some that have not, and will not keep Negroe Slaves of their own, may say, we must not be too censorious, for we are often at their Houses, and Eat and Drink bravely, and have their Negroes to wait on us, our Horses, Wives and Children.</P>
<P>Beside all these Things, we buy, sell, Trade, get Gain by and with them, we must be careful how we offend our Bene∣factors, and Dear Friends. But here is yet a stronger Bond than the other, Plea∣sure and Profit, we love to Sleep with their Off-spring, so they be but Rich; for many of us have joyned Affinity with these <HI>Ahabs</HI> (O that hard Word) and <HI>Jezabels</HI> for Gains, by marrying with their rich Children, and if we become Prophets, and can prophesy such things as they like, we shall be highly favoured, and fed at <HI>Jezabel's</HI> Table, though we should be twice 4500 of us.</P>

the Mouth of all <HI>Ahab'</HI>s Prophets, and cause him to go up and fall at <HI>Ramah,</HI> being Damned; what if <HI>Jezebel</HI> be eaten with Dogs, what care we for that.</P>
<P>What if <HI>Jezebel</HI> be eaten with Dogs, if we can get into their Estates and Poses∣sions; what care we? when they are dead and gone, they will not remember our Lying Prophesies. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18. 40. In∣deed we should be loth to be served as <HI>Elijah</HI> did the Prophets, <HI>at the Brook Kishon.</HI></P>
<P>2 <HI>Kings</HI> 10. 1, 5, 6, 7. We had rather destroy all the truly Begotten and Born Heirs of God, and joint or equal Heirs with Christ, the Truth, which testifie against us, and our Slave-Keeping Prac∣tice.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 18 to 26. We to be sure would sooner destroy all the Royal Off-spring of Heaven, as our Elder Brethren, them wicked Elders in <HI>Ahab'</HI>s time, <HI>Slew</HI> 70 <HI>Innocent Children,</HI> for fear of their own dear Lives; but <HI>John</HI> answered, <HI>and served them accordingly:</HI> It's true <HI>Ver.</HI> 25. and if it should be so with us, <HI>its better to die by the Sword than by Famine,</HI> as the Scriptures speak; or especially to be treated as many of our Brethren in this great Iniquity do their Slaves, up

and down in the World, and their Off∣spring, always repeated and repeating for evermore, with all the Torture and Torments that Devil and Dragon, Death and Hell can invent or devise, with all their Accomplices.</P>
<P>But although some of us, that are Ne∣groe Masters and Traders, do allow that the beginning of this Practice was of the Devil, and that he and we his Instru∣ments are now carrying of it on very powerfully, and as it had a beginning there in Hell, so it must have an End.</P>
<P><HI>Matt.</HI> 8. 28, 29. But the time is not yet come, therefore surely we may be allowed to ask the same Question of Truth now, as two of our Elder Brethren did for∣merly, which were possessed with Devils as well as we, <HI>what have we to do with thee;</HI> Truth?</P>
<P><HI>Mark.</HI> 5. 7, 10, 12. <HI>Art thou come hither to torment us before our time? and all the Devils besought him, the Truth,</HI> say∣ing, <HI>send us into the Swine; and Truth gave them leave,</HI> and so he does now; for Truth had rather the Devil should dwell in the Swine than in the Saints, for fear he should make the Saints Swine again, as some were before they were cleansed.</P>

Upon a time when I was reasoning with an eminent Preacher <HI>R. J.</HI> at his House in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> concerning that great <HI>Goliah,</HI> Negroe or Slave-keeping, which hath defied the little Army of the living God so many Years, and still con∣tinues so to do.</P>
<P>He the said <HI>R. J.</HI> was pleased then and there to tell me, that I loved the Negroes better than I did my Friends; and accused me at <HI>Stephen Jenkin'</HI>s House, before many Witnesses, of being the Death of my Dear Wife, and a Per∣secutor of the Church; but before that I charged him with being instrumental of separating my Dear Wife from me by Death, in Writing for a separate Certifi∣cate for my Wife, to a Meeting to which we never did belong, as if he and two or three more had a mind to separate us; which is now brought to pass.</P>
<P>I shall leave them to the great Judge of Heaven and Earth, if he will be pleas∣ed to forgive them, I hope I shall in time. But these things must be borne with I suppose, and more; when I have said to some Friends, Negroe-Keepers and their Adherents, that it seemed a little strange or novel, that a Friend should be hurried out of Meetings so con∣stantly and roughly, before he be disowned,
<PB N="68" REF="004149_0067_1003DEE705BF9E60"/>
or some way dealt with for some Disor∣order or other, contrary to the known and acknowledged discipline of Friends as a People.</P>
<P>If thy Brother is overtaken in a Fault, go to him and tell him his fault, between him and thee; if he hears thee thou hast gained thy Brother; if he will not hear thee, then take two or three with thee; if he will not hear them, then take him to the Church; and if he will not hear the Church, then, not till then, cast him forth. My Dear Friends, have any of these things been done to <HI>B. L.</HI> and yet still continue to cast him out, cast him out, cast him out, he is a troublesome Fellow, and has been so for many Years. Did our dear and well beloved Friends in <HI>Boston</HI> 60 or 70 Years ago, think this a just way of Proceeding, to be taken into Custody, put into <HI>Bridewell,</HI> Whipt severely, and Banished the Town, time after time, without any legal Proceed∣ings, only for being obstinate Quakers, as they were pleased to call them; dare to come again when they had Whipt them out of the Town so often. When I have put some Friends in mind of this, concerning our Dear Tender Friends great Suffering in <HI>New-England,</HI> in a
<PB N="69" REF="004149_0068_1003DEED3B52C868"/>
Book called <HI>New-England Judged,</HI> some Friends have been pleased to tell me that <HI>George Keith</HI> used to say so, or talk after that manner. What he said I cannot tell, but by report, which is not always true; but this of Friends Suffering in <HI>Boston</HI> is true, for I have been upon the Spot or Lot of Ground, where the Dear Lambs were put to Death; for the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus Christ, the Truth.</P>
<P>As to <HI>G. K.</HI> he was an extraordinary Man, while he kept to the Testimony of Truth in his own Heart; I do firmly be∣lieve, according to the Account of him by Friends; and a great Sufferer for Truth, by Imprisonment, and other ways, and an excellent Writer, and Minister in De∣fence of Truth's Principles for about 30 Years, as I remember; as many of his Books manifest, to Judgment of Men that have read them, of right mind and good understanding in Things relating to God's Kingdom; as his <HI>Revelation not ceased,</HI> his <HI>Way to the City of God,</HI> very excellent indeed, and many more; while he dwelt in the Truth and walk∣ed in Truth, he did well; but when he went from that, he was like the <HI>unsavory Salt, good for neither Land nor Dunghill,</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="004149_0069_1003BA48AE88B070"/>
and so it is now with some, or I am mis∣taken. And so it hath been with the very best of Men and Instruments that ever were in the World, though they had been never so much inlightened or illuminated from on High; they grow dark again, as they go from the Light, from God, from Truth, which are one in Nature and Essence, although three Names, for Men as Men do know that have good Natural Eyes, that the further they go from the Light outwardly, the more they go into Darkness until at length they cannot see any thing clearly, or at last not at all; and this comes upon Men because they love Darkness, which is Sin, and they live in Darkness, and walk in Darkness, and at last Darkness in Sin seems to be Light unto them. This is a dreadful State indeed: O that it may appear so before it be too late, to some poor Souls, is my true Desire for their eternal Welfare. Which I desire, as for my own Soul.</P>

<P>MY Dear and Well-beloved Friends; my Joy and the Crown of all my sweet Delights in this World, I can truly say, is the true Unity with my true Brethren, which are the true Church in God the Father, and he in them, ever reigning in his own Blessed Kingdom, Body, House, Tabernacle, <HI>New-Jeru∣salem,</HI> or a Tent, synonimous Terms; while <HI>Israel</HI> abode here, no Divination

could prevail, or inchantments against 'em; but when <HI>Israel,</HI> our Dear Friends, went out of their Tent to look at, and long after the Pleasures, Pride, Profit and Friendship of this World, then they came to be snared with this cursed Sin, Negroe-Trading, as well as some other gross Sins, of which this is Chief, consider∣ing the Hellish Train of Filthiness, which has, does, and ever will attend it, and is inseparable from it; for it is granted by all sober wise Men that truly fear God, and dearly love the Truth in Sincerity, and are well acquainted with this foul Trade from the beginning, and in all its progressions to this Day; I say such as have had a true Account, do know that those that are employed in this Trade, are some of the worst of Men, and with∣al some of the worst of Thieves, Pyrates and Murtherers, from whence our lesser Pyrates have proceeded. And many of these lesser Pyrates have been punished with Death, and some other ways; but the much greater Villains by far, not on∣ly go free but are encouraged, and have been near 50 Years, if not more, by us as a People, by buying of their cursed Hell∣ish-gotten Ware, at a very great Price. And all this Time pretending to the
<PB N="76" REF="004149_0075_1003DEA591387668"/>
most holy pure Religion in the whole World, to do unto all, as we would they should do unto us, and as <HI>James</HI> writes, <HI>to Visit the Fatherless, and Widow, in their Afflictions, and keep ourselves un∣spotted from the World;</HI> but I know no worse Engine the Devil has to make Widows and Fatherless Children, and to bring into Affliction and Bondage, and sore Captivity indeed, than this Hellish practice in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> Negroe-Keep∣ing.</P>
<P>But these Hellish Miscreants, these Men-Stealers, pretend they fetch away these poor Creatures, that they may not kill one the other, when they are the Murtherers which sets 'em to the Work (a cursed work it is) for as I have had an Account, near 35 Years ago, when 10 or 12 Sail of Vessels come on the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and they cannot catel Negroes enough to Freight their Vessel by the Sea side, and in Rivers where they send their Boats in Search and Pursuit of them, where they are acquainted; for they being us'd to the Business know where to go; and to find out some old Ne∣groes that they have been used to trade with, which will bring off in Canoes, their Wives or Children, or their Neighbours
<PB N="77" REF="004149_0076_1003BA1DBB809AE0"/>
Wives, and Children if they can catch 'em in Woods, or any where else, so bring 'em and sell them to our brave Christians, which come there with Ships for that pur∣pose.—O brave! give 30<HI>s.</HI> for a Negroe and sell him for 30<HI>l.</HI> or 40, 50 or 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 <HI>l.</HI> or more: Who would but be a Trader in Slaves and Souls of Men, altho' he goes to Hell for it, and in the mean time intail an Iniquity on his own, and his Neighbour's Posterity to their Destruction and the Ruin of the whole Country beside.</P>
<P>Above 30 Years ago, when I was a common Sailor, I had this Account, and likewise by some Sailors on Board Capt. <HI>Reeves,</HI> coming this Voyage to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> who had been at <HI>Guinea,</HI> and I suppose had been Pyrates, they did acknowledge they had been taken by them.</P>
<P>These vile Fellows on Board Capt. <HI>Reeves,</HI> in their Drink used to tell what cursed Work their former Captain and Sa∣lors made with the poor Negroes in their Passage, for their Lusts; the Captain 6 or 10 of 'em in the Cabbin, and the Sailors as many as they pleased; with much more too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul for me to mention, or for chaste Ears to hear.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="004149_0077_1003BA23EDE9B538"/>
But I pray, I beg, and beseech you my Friends, in the pure Love and Fear of God; consider what part have true Be∣lievers with such Infidels, or Christ with such <HI>Belials,</HI> or our Holy pure God with such unholy impure Devils, until we can join these together; now we can ne∣ver reconcile Slave-Keeping with our Prin∣ciples; we may as well say as <HI>Solomon</HI> of an Harlot, <HI>their Steps go down to Death and their Feet take hold on Hell.</HI></P>
<P>Now my dear Friends, let us consider the matter a little further, concerning these Men-Stealers, and weigh it in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, which is Equi∣ty and Justice. Consider I say, the dif∣ferent circumstances of times and things; it may be these wicked Creatures have been unhappily brought up to the Black Art, most of their Life time; my Soul pities them on that Account; had they had that good Education, Conversation, Books and Mutual Love, in Holy Illu∣minations, sweet Communion together in our solemn Meetings and Gatherings to∣gether, and the Heavenly Showers which many times, yea very often and frequent to my sure and certain Knowledge, and to the great mutual sweet and heavenly
<PB N="79" REF="004149_0078_1003DEBBE5D11F30"/>
Comfort of my poor Soul, with many more of my dear Friends; I say the ma∣ny Heavenly Showers that have dropped as the Dew, and distilled as the small Rain, in our tender Souls immediately, many times, yea innumerable, and instru∣mentally, by the Blessed Messengers of Peace and Salvation, which were sent by the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth eternity and dwelleth in Light, who had a tender regard Blessed by his Holy Name, to those Poor Men and Women too, that were Poor indeed, and truly contrited, and sat trembling before his Divine and Glorious Majesty, ready to receive him that was and is the Word that made all Things; and when they had received him, they or we, We were made to rejoice with Joy unspeak∣able, being filled with him that was, and is, and ever will be the Glory and true rejoicing of his People, and dear Child∣ren, all the World over; that can appeal to him that knows all Things, that they love him more then all things here be∣low, yea than their natural Lives.</P>
<P>Shall we I say as People who have been Blessed with so great Priviledges, and high Favours, forsake the Holy Com∣mandment of Loving God the Truth a∣bove
<PB N="80" REF="004149_0079_1003BA2A3AF640E8"/>
all, and turn to worship for cove∣tous ends, the worst Idol that ever the Devil set up in the World.</P>
<P>Sure those wicked Men above-menti∣oned will rise up in Judgment against us; for had they been so highly favoured in all respects, as Friends as a People have been, who knows but they might have been as great Saints as any in the Church of Christ at this Day; for had Friends stood faithful in their Testimony against this Practice from the beginning they might have convinced many, and stopt 'em in their career; but now they may say, and that truly too, we have been a means to encourage and strengthen them in their wicked ways; for when they brought in a Cargo of Blacks, who more rea∣dy to purchase them, and at a great Price, than the Saints, or them that seem so, and would be thought such. Well my dear and tender Friends, although I touch thus close to ease my afflicted mind, which has been tossed as with a Tempest at times, above 17 Years, on this sad Account Slave-Keeping, yet I write not this of all by no means, I know and be-believe there is many Friends, that dare not touch with it, for any Profit whatso∣ever. I do hope there is some Thousands
<PB N="81" REF="004149_0080_1003DEC8E590BEB8"/>
will not bow the Knee to this <HI>Baal,</HI> nor kiss his Lips for an Ease or Gain. It has been said, that all do not see it so great a Sin as I and some others make it; and for that reason with others I think it my duty to write and speak the more about it where I come, that Friends and others may be better informed. Some have insinuated, as if the Primitive Saints kept Captive Slaves; this is hellish Cen∣sure indeed, to accuse the greatest of Saints with the greatest of Sins; whose Damnation is just, and their reward shall be according to their Works; for they were without Spot, then free from the greatest Spot; holy, as he is holy; per∣fect, as he is perfect; He that Sanctifi∣eth, and they that are Sanctified, are one-Blessing and Honour, Salvation and Glo∣ry to our God, for evermore, <HI>Amen,</HI> saith my Soul.</P>
<P>Cursing and Dishonour, and Damnati∣on is to the Devil and Satan, and his Instruments, that Preach such Doctrines; for they that are Born of God Sin not, neither can they, for his Seed remaineth in them; they cannot Sin, because they are Born of God.</P>
<P>And now my dear Friends and others,
<PB N="82" REF="004149_0081_1003DECF920ED938"/>
you that came in Servants to this Coun∣try, and Slaves, although for a short time by your own Consent too, for you to plead for Negroe-Keeping, is almost intolerable.</P>
<P>I say, you that came here poor, vile, miserable wretches, destitute and folorn, and here you were kept to hard Labour, which was good for you, and brought you to a sense of your filthy, abomina∣ble, undone, and woful cursed condition which you, many of ye had been in, then O then many of you came to consider of your ways, and were wise in turning to the Lord, into your own Hearts by the moving and rising of his own blessed Light, Life, Grace and pure Love there in your own Souls, which was as a Light shining in a Dark Place, your Hearts dark indeed, by reason of Sin, and that filthy Life which you had lived; you came to be burthened with it, and seek relief in turning to the Lord in your Hearts, where he was and is to be found, blessed be his pure Name which is his Essence or divine Nature, manifest with∣in Men; so when you came to this good experience, you came to love the Society and follow the good example of our worthy Elders, very commendable

in you to do, which first settled in this Country; you came to live sober lives, and by your industry, the Almighty favouring, some attained to very large possessions here, being a large Country and few People, but now more numer∣ous, so no occasion for Negro-Slaves; for had this Land been covered with 'em as it is now in some Places, and too much here already, how would you have come to this greatness; you might have perished for want of Business to purchase necessaries. Let it never be forgotten by you, I beseech and pray ye for the Lord's sake, and for your own and your Child∣rens sake, that are coming up in vast Numbers, as well as them that are, or may become Servants hereafter, with many, yea very many of your own Chil∣dren, which is very likely by the wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul courses many of our Youth take, they may be brought to the same Misery and extremity as you were, by their foolish Lusts and vanities; my Soul mourns in contemplating of it, and is in sore dis∣tress and misery, with many of my dear and inwardly beloved Friends, Male and Female, on this sad Account, as well as other gross Sins, many dear tender Souls in our Society, reproachfully called
<PB N="84" REF="004149_0083_1003DEE46D294B68"/>
<HI>Quakers</HI> have writ and bore Testimony against this Sin at times, near 50 Years, but were reproached for that likewise; but some are gone to their Graves in Peace; many yet living; as in <HI>Pennsyl∣vania, Jersey, Long-Island, Nantucket, Old England,</HI> which I have been with at their Houses, and their Writings are extant at this time to my certain knowledge, although many poor seeking Souls, that are bewildered by this wicked Hellish Sin in our Ministers, Slave-Keeping, will not believe or cannot believe it, but rather believe we approve of it as a Peo∣ple with one consent unanimously. When some Friends have been reasoning with some Sober People of other professions in my hearing, concerning the Pride and Covetousness of their hireling Preachers, and concerning Truth's Principles, they have had nothing to say for the one, or against the other; but whether shall we go, say they, we do not approve or like keeping Slaves, it is not doing as we would be done by ourselves; and your People are as greedy as any Body in keeping Negroes for their Gain, (it is too true) but not all said I, no say they again, who shall we believe, we are sure and do know, that your Preachers and

Elders▪ Chief Leaders have 'em; answer was made, not all, for some have testified against it, as a very henious Sin, for ma∣ny Years, Year after Year; and are gone to their silent Graves in Peace, and many yet living amongst us, as above is menti∣oned.

<P>I know no worse or greater stumbling Blocks the Devil has to lay in the way of honest Inquirers, than our Ministers and Elders keeping Slaves; and by straining and perverting Holy Scriptures, Preach more to Hell, than ever they will bring to Heaven, by their feigned Hu∣mility and Hypocrisy.</P>
<P>Satan put to his last Shift, or the De∣vil working wonders, by a seeming Gos∣pel Ministry of great repute; for by their keeping of Slaves, they carry on his Work, and uphold his Kingdom. We read, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. 3. to the end, <HI>That the Dragon drew the third part of the
<PB N="86" REF="004149_0085_1003DEF53203D928"/>
Stars of Heaven, and did cast them to the Earth with his Tail, the vilest part of the Beast.</HI> Let him that reads understand; the Stars were Men that had been en∣lightened, and it has been the Judgment of worthy Men, in many Ages of the World, that a false and fallen Mi∣nistry have been the greatest Instruments of Evil, that ever the Devil brought in∣to the Church of Christ, as may be seen in <HI>Eusebius's Church History, Francis Howgil's Works, G. Fox's Journal,</HI> and in many more beside, which I have by me; does largely set forth that false and fallen Ministers are the worst Devils, and Dragons, and Serpents, the Woman or Church has to War with, by reason of the Power they have with the beastly Nature, in their ignorant Hearers, and foolish bigotted Crowd; such as have itching Ears, and shallow Crowns, car∣nal Minds, and looser Lives; such being Born after the Flesh, are very rea∣dy to join with the Serpent, to persecute him that is Born after the Spirit; it was so, it is so, and it will be so. The Dra∣gon, and the Beast joining Forces, have great Power to make Rents in the out∣ward Church, and Divisions, and sow discord amongst weak Brethren, but the
<PB N="87" REF="004149_0086_1003DEFD1FAF05E0"/>
truly Wise in Heart, I know will be∣ware.</P>
<P>But as to those Dragon, Slave-Keep∣ing Preachers, that are now making War with the Woman, these fallen Stars they say they have been inlightened, and received part of the Ministry; we will allow it, for God Almighty has been ve∣ry good and kind to them, and is still long suffering; So <HI>Judas</HI> their elder Brother was inlightened too, as much and more than they, for ought I know, but he repented, and returned his cursed Gain, and made Confession of his soul Sin, which I fear is more than they will do in haste, so much worse than <HI>Judas</HI> they are, for they Crucifie the Truth daily, and put it to open shame.</P>
<P>I have understood lately, that some have made their Wills when they were Sick, to set their Negroes free at such an Age, 30 or 40, after their Death; that will not salve the Sore, it is too deep and rotten, God will not be mocked so, nor Wise Men neither; they rather think of the old Proverb, it may be.</P>

that Trade nine Sail; and he told me ac∣cording to Account he had there, that there goes from <HI>Bristol</HI> about 50 Sail in a Year for Negroes: And I suppose some plain Coat-Men are concerned in it there as well as at <HI>Leverpoole, Barbadoes,</HI> and elsewhere; now if each of these 50 Vessels carries 300, some carry manymore, it comes to 15000 Souls Yearly, Stolen by <HI>Bristol∣</HI>Men; and if there should be four times as many Stolen by Vessels from <HI>London, Lever∣poole, North-Britain, Ireland, Barbadoes, Jamaica</HI> and some other Places, as I sup∣pose there may, it comes to 75,000 Year∣ly, Stolen and kept in Iron Furnaces; so that in 50 Years and more since Friends have been concerned in this practice, be∣side what has been increased by Genera∣tion, comes to 3825000. Is not this ten times worse than the Sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Egypt, Turk, Jew</HI> or <HI>Infidel?</HI></P>
<P>So I inquired of the Friend what they did with this or such vast Numbers of Slaves; he said, they carried them to <HI>Jamaica</HI> generally, and sold them to the <HI>Spaniard</HI> for the Mines, or any Body else, I suppose, that will give most for them, although they keep them and their Pos∣terity, in their cursed Hellish Iron-Fur∣nace for evermore.</P>

O Brave Christians for the Devil, and Protestants too! is this the way to con∣vince <HI>Papists, Turks, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> of their notorious Wickedness and in∣humanity, when we encourage them in it all we can, by supplying of them with Slaves, for our cursed Gain.</P>
<P>Several eminent Friends amongst us of great Note, have boasted in my hearing of having Servants or Slaves born in their House, alluding to <HI>Abraham,</HI> for keeping Slaves; but I cannot find in all the Scriptures that <HI>Abraham</HI> ever had any Slaves; Servants he might have born in his House, and bought with Money for a time; but I do not believe that righ∣teous, perfect good Man would keep his fellow Creatures in Bondage, them and their Off-spring, for evermore. I have a better Opinion of that tender hearted, good vertuous Man, that was stiled the Father of the faithful, by the Lip of Truth, and that rightly too, for so he was; but the unfaithful hypocritical <HI>Pharisees,</HI> would, for a Cloak to their Wickedness, have him to their Father; but Truth told them, if they were <HI>Abra∣ham'</HI>s Children they would do the Works of <HI>Abraham;</HI> but now ye are of your Father the Devil, and his Works ye

will do. May not Truth say the same thing now, of our Preachers and Elders, Keepers and Traders in Slaves for noth∣ing but their ungodly Gain. But what will our wicked Slave-Keepers get by flying beyond Gospel and Law, to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to patronise their cursed infer∣nal practice; but what Truth said to the <HI>Jews,</HI> it will say to them, <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Now Friends, you that are Slave-Keepers, I pray and beseech ye, examine your own Hearts, and see and feel too, if you have not the same answer from Truth now within; while you Preach and exhort others to Equity, and to do Justice and love Mercy, and to walk humbly before the Lord and his People, and you yourselves live and act quite con∣trary, behave proudly, do unjustly and un∣mercifully, and live in and encourage the grossest Iniquity in the whole World. For I say, you are got beyond Gospel, Law, <HI>Abraham,</HI> Prophets, Patriarchs, to <HI>Cain</HI> the Murtherer, and beyond him too, to the Devil himself, beyond <HI>Cain,</HI> for he Murthered but one, that we know of but you have many Thousands, or caused 'em to be so, and for ought I know many

Hundreds of Thousands, within 50 Years. What do you think of these Things, you brave Gospel Ministers? that keep poor Slaves to Work for you to maintain you and yours in Pride, Pride and much Idleness or Laziness, and Ful∣ness of Bread, the Sins of <HI>Sodom:</HI> How do these Things become your plain Dress, Demure Appearance, feigned Humili∣ty, all but Hypocrisy, which accord∣ing to Truth's Testimony, must have the hottest Place in Hell; to keep those mi∣serable Creatures at hard Labour con∣tinually, unto their old Age, in Bondage and sore Captivity, working out their Blood and Sweat, and Bowels, youthful strength and vigour, then you drop in∣to your Graves, go to your Places or∣dained or appointed for you; so leave these poor unhappy Creatures in their worn-out old Age, to your proud, Dainty, Lazy, Scornful, Tyrannical, and often beggerly Children, for them to Domineer and Tyrannize over, cursing them and you in your Graves, for work∣ing out their youthful Blood and strength for you, and then leave 'em to be a Plague to us; and then of the abuses, miseries and Cruelties these miserable old worn out Slaves go through, no Tongue can ex∣press

I could al∣most wish such hardened, unthinking Sinful devilish Lyars were put into their Places, at least for a time, in a very hard Service, that they might feel a little in themselves, of what they make so light of in other People; and it would be but just upon 'em, and indeed why should they be against it, if the Negroes live as well and better than they; but such notorious Lies will never go down well, with any Sober right tender-hearted People truly fearing God, and that love the Truth above all; for such I believe firmly, when they come to see, and rightly consider the vileness of this prac∣tice in all its parts, and the cursed Fruit it brings forth, they will never enter into it; and if they are in, will en∣deavour to get out as soon as they can; for I do believe if all the Wickedness Tyrany, oppressions and abominable Bar∣barities were written concerning this

<P>Many has said, they do not see it so great an Evil or Sin, that is, Negroe-Keeping; who so Blind as them that will not see; but them that are willing to see, I think it my duty to inform them what I can by Word and Writing, and then leave it to the Lord.</P>
<P>There has been that has reflected on me, as if I wanted a Party, and to see what Numbers I could get on my side; the living Lord God Almighty is Witness for me, that I desire no Party, no Num∣ber but what is on the Lords side, and his Party, which hold the Blessed Truth in righteousness and holiness of Life, in∣deed and in Truth. I must confess I ra∣ther chuse that Number, though but 5, then 500 that hold the Truth in un∣righteousness and in unholiness; and though I could get the Friendship of the World and worldly Spirits, even them amongst ourselves and all their wealth beside; which is gotten by the iniquity of Slave-Keeping or otherwise; my witness is in Heaven; but I must ex∣pect a great many more Slanders than these; nevertheless, I may say as it is

written, of Slave-Keeping Ministers, un∣to the Wicked God saith, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 50. 16, 18. to the end. <HI>What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldst take my Covenant in thy Mouth; when thou sawest a Thief, then thou consents with him, and hast been partaker with Adulterers.</HI> Is not this very applicable to Men-Stealers and Receivers.</P>
<P>But my dear Friends, as to my own part, if the Lord have stirred you up a∣gainst me, let him accept of an offering; but if it be only Men, I don't fear in the least; but my dearest God, whom I serve with pure Love, fervently, will deliver me, and in his own Blessed time estab∣lish me in my Inheritance with Saints in Light. O that the Lord my God would be pleased to raise up some Worthies, that be Valiant for the Truth, upon Earth, and bring them forth into open view, in Sight of all Men, for his Name sake, which is the Truth. <HI>Hebrews.</HI> 11. 33, 34.</P>
<P>O that we may never sell our Birth-right, for a morsel of Meat or any Ad∣vantage of this beggerly World; for Truth said of Old, and saith the same now, <HI>He that will not forsake all is not worthy of me, all for my sake, deny himself, take up the Cross and follow me.</HI></P>

Doth Truth lead its Ministers to keep their fellow Creatures in Bondage and sore Captivity, and their Off-spring for∣evermore; if it does not, but the prac∣tice be proved by the Blessed Truth it∣self to be contrary and directly opposite to its divine Nature, as to be sure it is. Why I pray and beseech you my dear Friends, are some that seem to be Truth's Ministers, so Angry, in a Rage, and such a Fury, as many have been, and are to my knowledge, when they have been reprov∣ed for, or opposed in this their wicked Sin, and very great Iniquity; for so it is proved by Truth itself, <HI>Do to all o∣thers, as you would they should do unto you:</HI> Truth saith, <HI>Whosoever is Angry with his Brother, without just cause, is in danger of Judgment:</HI> but who dare judge a Minister, he will be in such a Fury if he is not true or reprove him, although he pretend to be a Servant in the Church to us all. I know what I write by large experience, for many Years, in several Nations, where my lot hath been cast; so that I am not as one that beats the Air in this cause, as concerning false Mi∣nisters; but as to Truth's Minister, that always dwells in Truth and follows Truth wheresoever he goes, Truth bears wit∣ness

in me, that I love them and the pure dear sweet Testimony Truth hath given us, better than all things in this vain World; now as concerning Offerers, Truth saith, <HI>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remember, thy Brother hath anght against thee, leave thy gift at or before the Altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy Brother, and then, not before, come and offer thy Gift.</HI> O that these Things were well considered by all Preachers and hearers; and that no Prea∣cher might be suffered to appear in our Meetings, but such as were clear of this Sinful Practice, Slave-Keeping, as well as all others; then we should have but few Preachers for a time, I think, but much better Preaching: Dear Friends, I myself do consider how it stands, and what I may have to incounter with; but shall leave all to my dear sweet and for∣ever blessed <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> which hath hither∣to helped, blessed be his Pious Name, Says <HI>B.

<P>Is it not the Church's Prerogative, to judge of the Ministry and Ministers, and to call them to strict Account, concern∣ing their Doctrine, Principles, Practices, and manner of living?</P>

<HEAD>Some Thoughts concerning it.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Writ in ABINGTON, <DATE>the 7<HI>th Mo.</HI> 1736.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Verse</HI> 1. <HI>AND there appeared a great wonder in Heaven, the King∣dom of Heaven</HI> is within saith Truth, the true Church, <HI>a Woman Cloathed with the Sun,</HI> Pure, Light and Brightness, <HI>and the Moon under her Feet,</HI> all changeable things put down, trodden under, in the Soul, <HI>and upon her Head a Crown of</HI> 12 <HI>Stars,</HI> very bright and beautiful to be∣hold.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 2. <HI>And she being with Child, cried travailing in Birth,</HI> until Truth was form∣ed in her, you little Children for whom—til Christ be in you, the hope and Glo∣ry, <HI>and pained to be delivered,</HI> brought forth into Victory over all Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 3. <HI>And there appeared another wonder in Heaven,</HI> in the Heart of Man, <HI>and behold a great red Dragon,</HI> a Furious Beast, and Bloody Monster, <HI>having seven Heads, and</HI> 10 <HI>Horns, and</HI> 7 <HI>Crowns upon his Heads,</HI> it may be he had gotten seven Victories over the Saints, but was over∣come at last.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 4. <HI>And his Tail,</HI> the beastly Nature, <HI>drew the third part of the Stars
<PB N="102" REF="004149_0101_1003DF8AD3B90AB0"/>
of Heaven,</HI> bright Men, <HI>and did cast them to the Earth,</HI> inlightened Men that had received part of the Ministry, as <HI>Judas</HI> did, yet betrayed the Truth, for Gain, as our Slave-Keepers do now. I know what I write, <HI>and the Dragon,</HI> the Beast, <HI>stood before the Woman, which was ready to be delivered</HI> of the Heavenly Birth, <HI>for to devour her Child as soon as it was Born,</HI> to be sure, forfear it should grow strong and break his Head, and take away his Crowns, and Name of Blasphemy, which he is so proud of.</P>
<P>These Men, these fallen Stars have been, and are accounted the greatest of Anti-Christs, and worst of Devils; the true Church has had, and has still to in∣counter with wicked Spirits in high Pla∣ces; as I can if it be desired, produce many worthy Authors to justifie what I write.</P>
<P>In almost all Ages of the World, for∣mer and latter times, as many of our worthy Elders <HI>G. Fox</HI> and many others sets them forth, and that very justly, to be much worse and more dangerous than the common Hirelings of the times.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 5. <HI>And she brought forth a Man Child,</HI> begotten and Born of the Truth,
<PB N="103" REF="004149_0102_1003BA9D71CBC998"/>
which is God, that good Spirit, in the the Soul of Man, <HI>who was to rule all Na∣tions with a Rod of Iron;</HI> in his own time, <HI>and her Child was caught to God,</HI> and to his Throne, preserved in safety, and gloriously exalted in the Soul, and the Soul in him; he that Sanctifieth and they that are Sanctified are one.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 6. <HI>And the Woman</HI> the true Church, <HI>fled into the Wilderness,</HI> a very Solitary Place to weep and mourn out her Days, fearing at times her Spouse had forsaken her altogether, and then O the the distress she was in for her beloved; but this was but to prove her constancy, where she had a Place prepared of God, though she knew it not for a time, <HI>that they should feed her there</HI> 1260 <HI>Days,</HI> if in adversity yet for her advancement in the End: Glory to the pure Spouse, forever, and to the Bride, the Lamb's, Wife for she is Beautiful.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 7. <HI>And there was War in Hea∣ven,</HI> what in that peaceable Place, which we read is so glorious and full of sweet delight, <HI>Michael and his Angels fought;</HI> what must the Saints fight then for Hea∣ven? Yea verily, or else they never enter, and valiantly too, <HI>against the Dragon, and the Dragon fought, and his</HI> (Black)

<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 9. <HI>And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent</HI> that has bitten so many, <HI>called the Devil, and Satan which deceiveth the whole World,</HI> no doubt because the worldly, covetous Spirit is always blind, very easy to be deceived; <HI>he was cast out into the Earth, and his Angels were cast out with him,</HI> out of Heavenly into earthly Minds, where he made Devilish Work no doubt and not much to be thought strange of; but that the Saints of the most high God should lick up what some such earthly minds, in several Professions have spued up, as being too Hellish, and too hard for 'em to digest, or for their Stomachs to bear, to my thinking, is almost beyond com∣pare, Slave-Keeping.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="004149_0104_1003DFA7D20868C8"/>
<HI>Ver.</HI> 10. <HI>And I heard a loud Voice, say∣ing in Heaven, Now is come Salvation and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, &amp; the Power of his Christ:</HI> All this is ex∣perienced within, when Men and Wo∣men are born again, then Truth reigns and rules in its own Kingdom, <HI>for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down;</HI> it was so, and I with some of my oppressed Friends do hope it will be so again; the Devil, <HI>which accused them before our God, Day and Night,</HI> does the same to this Day, for if you reprove or admonish one of our Preachers which keep a Slave or Slaves, he will be in such a rage and fury, beyond that moderation I think that becomes a meek follower of the blessed Lamb of God, which suffered, the just for the unjust, to take away all Sin, then surely Slave-Keeping the worst of Sins; I say reprove one of these for that wicked Practice, and see if he will not accuse you Day and Night, from Meet∣ing to Meeting, in Meeting and out of Meeting, right or wrong, as he thinks fit, and set his Brethren in Iniquity, Slave-Keeping, Preachers, and others a∣gainst you, all he possibly can, and so pro∣ceed to get you disowned if possible: As several worthy Friends have been, for

Testifying against this sinful, foul Hel∣lish practice, the Mother of Enormities. We may safely say as <HI>Solomon</HI> of an Whore or Harlot, that stands by the way side to catch who she can, <HI>their Guests are in the depths of Hell.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 11. <HI>And they overcame him</HI> the accuser, <HI>by the Blood of the Lamb,</HI> blessed dear Lamb, O that all would follow him wherever he goes, Ministers especially, and all others; then we should never Trade in Slaves, and Souls of Men, for cursed Gain; <HI>and by the Word of their Testimony;</HI> they kept their Testimony clear and pure it's like, or else they had not overcame.</P>
<P><HI>And they loved not their Lives unto the Death;</HI> then they were not afraid to reprove Wicked Men, it's very evident, or worse Preachers, which are a sort of Devils, that Preach more to Hell than they do to Heaven, and so they will do forever, as long as they are suffered to reign in the worst, and Mother of all Sins, Slave-Keeping.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 12. <HI>Therefore rejoice, ye Heavens, and all ye that dwell in them;</HI> they have great cause so to do, that know their warfare to be accomplished, &amp; <HI>Sion</HI> in the Soul to be a quiet Habitation, free from

the accuser of the Brethren, these do no evil, commit no Sin; But <HI>Wo to the In∣habiters of the Earth, and of the Sea,</HI> which are People, <HI>for the Devil is come down unto you, having great Wrath, be∣cause be knoweth he hath but a short time.</HI> Great Wrath indeed, and so have his Ministers too, although they seem, and would be thought to be meek followers of the Lamb, yet do but reprove 'em for their gross Sin, and tell them they are the strongest Instruments in the Church that the Devil has to uphold and carry on, and continue that Hellish Trading in Slaves and Souls of Men; and let 'em know that they are the very greatest stumbling Blocks, the Devil has to lay in the way of Honest Inquirers, and you shall soon see what metal they are made of; yet they have cast down many wounded, yea many strong Men it is thought have fallen by their means, as <HI>Solomon</HI> said of an Whore.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 13. <HI>And when the Dragon saw that he was cast unto the Earth, he per∣secuted the Woman that brought forth the Man Child.</HI> When the Dragon, Beast, Serpent, Whore, and false Prophet, all one, saw he was discovered by some Members of the true Church, the Wo∣man

man that brings forth the Man Child the true Heir of God and joint Heir with Truth or Christ, all one; then he shows himself in his proper colours in his natural element, Hellish, as it is; to persecuting of the Woman he goes, the true Church, that brings forth the Man Child, Christ, God, and Man. Them that read, let them understand in Spirit.</P>
<P>Neither enter themselves, or suffer others; as Christ said of former Hy∣pocrites, we may safely of these latter ones.</P>
<P><HI>Ver.</HI> 14. <HI>And to the Woman were gi∣ven, two Wings of a great Eagle, that she might fly into the Wilderness, into her Place; where she is to be nourished, for a time, and times,</HI> and dividing of times, <HI>from the face of the Serpent.</HI></P>
<P>Great Wings may signifie swiftness and strength but where shall we fly, but to the Lord, our Rock, for nourishment and strength; the Lord in his wisdom may have been pleased to hide some from the face of the Serpent for some time for Reasons best known to himself, but now I believe the time is near at hand, that some may or must come forth of the Wilderness, yet leaning on their belov∣ed, to meet the Serpent, although with

Years, almost 20 before I ever saw <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> closely exercised, and sorely oppressed with a false and forward Mi∣nistry, where Slave-Keeping is not per∣mitted by Law, and has been I firmly believe a great means of bringing in and spreading the Apostacy, and so continues to do, by some that pretend to preach freely, as well or ill as by the bare∣faced Hirelings of our time, who cannot deny but that they make a trade of Preaching for their Bellies, but gross A∣postacy by the way.</P>
<P>I have had it in my mind for a con∣siderable time, to write something con∣cerning a false Anti-Christian Ministry, and a true Christian Ministry, fitted and sent forth by the Spirit of Truth itself, in this our Day, with the Epistles of ma∣ny worthy Men, of several persuasions, on that Subject; but fearing it will swell this Volume too large, it is thought best to be reserved for another Impression, with something concerning the Kingdom of Heaven, or Heavenly Kingdom, what it is, and where it is to be found, with the most ready, sure and certain way to attain it, plainly described; for the sake of the sincere in Heart, who are tra∣velling toward <HI>Sion,</HI> with their Faces
<PB N="125" REF="004149_0124_1003BAF832DFD1A8"/>

<P>As no Man or Men can set forth in Words spoken or written, the great good, service, comfort, joy, strength &amp; consolation, a true Ministry sent from God has been, and is of, for the build∣ing up of the true Church in God, in their most Holy Faith:</P>
<P>So no Men or Angels, nor all the Men in the World can declare to the full, the great evil, that a false Ministry, sent from the Devil, has been, and is of, for the Building up of the false Church in their sinful, and unholy Faith and Prac∣tice.</P>
<P>I had it also much in my mind to write something concerning the Lives of the Primitive Christians, mentioned by <HI>William Penn,</HI> in his <HI>No Cross No Crown,</HI> and <HI>Eusebius'</HI>s <HI>Ecclesiastical History, Tho∣mas a Kempis'</HI>s <HI>Christian Pattern, Michael de Molinus'</HI>s <HI>Spiritual Guide,</HI> a Book called <HI>The Apostolick Fathers,</HI> and some of the best of the Philosophers and others, which I have by me, which might be of Ser∣vice, to them that live single Lives es∣pecially;

<P>O the strict Rules of Temperance that was amongst those <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Old-Eng∣land!</HI> what Persecution then was by Plundering, Robbing and ruining of Fa∣milies? What Whipping and Imprison∣ing, many Hundreds at a time, some suffocated to Death, some imprisoned during Life, some Banished, and other ways Tortured.</P>
<P>Then about the same in <HI>N. England,</HI> how many of our first dear and true Friends, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> suffered there by plunder∣ing and ruining of Families, Whipping and Banishing almost continually, with cutting of Ears, and Hanging there was in that Day, for the sake of the Testi∣mony of or for the pure Holy unchang∣able Truth, and of good Conscience, a∣gainst all Iniquity, Cruelty, Bloodshed and Inhumanity, which was acted there, by them that had fled from <HI>Old-England</HI> to save their Backs and their Purses, ac∣cording to the Account in a Book writ∣by <HI>George Bishop,</HI> called <HI>New-England Judged.</HI></P>
<P>Much more might be writ concerning these and such like things, which might fall many large Volumes in Folio. But this
<PB N="127" REF="004149_0126_1003BAFCA7259B40"/>
is not like Slave-Keeping; for those were dispatched or set at Liberty, and some crime or cause pretended; but these for no fault, so much as pretended, but only Devilish Covetousness in the Stealers and Receivers, and then by a lingering Martyrdom from one twenty Years to another, some above Ground and some under Ground in Caves &amp; Dens or Mines, are Murthered by Working hard, and Starving, Whipping, Racking, Hang∣ing, Burning, Scalding, Roasting, and other Hellish Torments, very sorrowful to consider. O when will there be an end of these Things, seeing it now going on with main strength by almost all Par∣ties, as well as by some of those that pretend to the most strict self-denying Doctrine in the World, that is so full of Mercy, Compassion, Forgiveness to the very worst of Enemies, Tenderness, Meekness, Mildness, Sweetness of Love, and Pity to all Creatures of all Kinds; <HI>the merciful Man is merciful to his Beast,</HI> and yet some of these Preten∣ders to this Purity can join with these Men-Killers and Stealers for Gain, which is hard to write, but it is True.</P>
<P>But yet I do know there is a faithful Remnant amongst the People called

<HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> that are zealous against this and all other Iniquity, to whom my Soul is nearly united in Spirit, blessed be the Lord my God, for so great a favour for evermore.

<P>But if the Words be never so sound and orthodox, without Life they are but as Chaff; and what is the Chaff to the Wheat? why truly, Friends, you know the Chaff is for the Beasts; but the bles∣sed Wheat, with which our heavenly Father feeds his Babes, is for the Chil∣dren of the Kingdom, New Jerusalem, the Church of the living God, his House.</P>

Now if such filthy Stuff be countenanced encouraged and commended by our El∣ders and Ministers, some of them, what a Condition is the Church in, which should be without Spot or Wrinkle? I leave it to the Wise in Heart to judge, to such Ministers and Elders as rule well and are worthy of double Honour. So says <HI>B. L.</HI></P>

<P>I remember about 40 years ago I kept my elder Brother's Sheep, and the pret∣ty Lambs and their Dams would be qui∣etly sweetly and prettily feeding toge∣ther, a very beautiful and comely Sight to see. But if a Stranger, my Friends, the Stranger, came near with his Dog, (the Dog sucks the Blood which is the
<PB N="132" REF="004149_0131_1003E090C814DCE8"/>
Life of the Sheep) and if this Dog fell a barking yawling or howling, among the Sheep and the pretty pretty dear Lambs, immediately they leave their Feeding, and run for their dear Lives; so they would be scatter'd, and scatter'd, altho' there was or might be a great Flock of them together. Sometimes, I must con∣fess, I have been a little careless and sleepy like some other Shepherds, and then the Sheep would go wandring about over Hedge and Ditch, and get into my Neighbour's Corn, and do Mischief; and then it was very hard for me to get them out of the Corn and into order again. Sometimes it would cost me many Tears before I could get them into order again. Sometimes if the Sheep and Lambs were not gathered together before Night, in the Night in the Dark the Dog would come and bite many of them, and suck their Blood, and some he would kill; so then that would be a Grief to the Own∣er, and a Reproach to the Shepherd.</P>
<P>So, my very dear Friends, you that are the right true Shepherds, that love the Sheep more than all things in this World, you can very easily make an Application, for it is your Life and Delight to take Care of your Father's Sheep, and his
<PB N="133" REF="004149_0132_1003E0959F62A718"/>
Lambs especially, and are grieved when the Dog, the Dog, the Bloodsucker, does but bark, and hinder them from Feed∣ing. I know what I write, blessed be the Name of the good and great Shep∣herd, for evermore, who laid down his Life for his Sheep and Lambs.</P>
<P>My dear faithful Friends, you are much esteemed by me, and your Unity in the Father in his Kingdom, which is his Church, is much more desired by me than all things in this World, I can tru∣ly say. It has been much in my Mind for a considerable time, to lay before you my Concern for having some of our an∣cient worthy Friends Epistles of Warn∣ing, Reproof, Caution, and Advice to Ministers, collected and reprinted; ap∣prehending it may be of some Service to have a Collection of such as I have mentioned, or such as you shall think will be of most Service; I earnestly de∣sire and entreat to have your Advice and Counsel; for I know right well that in the multitude of Counsel there is Safety, especially with them dear Friends that know the Truth and are faithful; these are the best Counsellors in the whole World. I am your Brother and Friend in the blessed Truth.</P>

<P>AS I was at work in the Garden, it came into my Mind, that many of our Preachers would or did make Prea∣ching so common, that many of our young People, and old ones too, did not much matter it; nay I believe many, yea very many, loath it; it is fulsome and bur∣thensome to them, instead of edifying and strengthening; by reason of many, I fear very many, going and running in their own Will and Time; which brings a very great Exercise, and many heavy Burthens upon some tender dear young Ministers, and others, which are rightly concerned, which cannot receive their chaffy Doctrine, but are almost choaked with it, as well they may, for it is very killing to sit under their dead dry noisy dark dreaming in-and-out Harangues, with <HI>Death in the Pot,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 4. 39, 40. which brings Death and <HI>Darkness</HI> over our Meetings, such as <HI>may be felt,</HI> some∣thing like that in <HI>AEgypt, Ex.</HI> 10. 21. where the Tongue of <HI>the Dogs, Phil.</HI> 3. 2. was heard, the <HI>Voice of the Stranger, John</HI> 10. 6. which <HI>darkens Counsel with or by Words without Knowledge, Job</HI> 38. 2. being alie∣nated

<P>EArly this Morning it was given me to see, that all Slave-keepers and Tra∣ders with them for Gain, were Apostates which pretended to be Christians; espe∣cially in Ministers it is a double Crime, because of their bad Example to to their Flock; for all such have the Mark of the Beast, Whore and False Prophet on them, <HI>Mystery Babylon Mother of Harlots,</HI> let them preach as long as they will or may.</P>
<P>Oh Israel! thy Leaders cause thee to err, by their Lyes and their Lightness! Oh how mine Eyes have seen some of the

first Rank, sit and stand and laugh, Prea∣chers and others, when I have been spea∣king of the Bondage and miserable Cap∣tivity of their poor Slaves, in as light and airy a manner as any Boy in the Town need to do: Persons Male and Female, eminent in the Church, Friends of Renown in their Generation and Con∣gregation; long Custom and Covetous∣ness having made the Sin, altho' so very gross, so easy and familiar to them. Some of which I do verily believe have known the pure Presence of the divine Lord of Life and Glory, his holy Light and blessed Truth in their Souls; yet af∣terwards become vain in their Imagina∣tions, to think Slave-Keeping was law∣ful; so their foolish Hearts became dark∣ned and hardned again worse than ever. Oh that is a sorrowful Condition, to have the greatest Mark of the Apostacy in the World, upon them, and not to know or believe it!</P>
<P>When I say <HI>All Slave-Keepers Apostates,</HI> I mean them that keep innocent Men, Women and Children in everlasting Bon∣dage. As to petty Criminals, that will not or cannot make Restitution, I think, as well as many other tender Friends and

People fearing God and loving his Crea∣tion, their Fellow-Creatures, although very wicked, that they had better be kept in Bondage, <HI>Exod.</HI> 22. 3. that by hard Labour they might be brought to Repentance and Amendment of Life, in order to a happy Death, than to put them to Death in their Sins; for in the Grave there is no Repentance; but hard Labour and mean Living is an Antidote to Luxury and Idleness, and Captivity the Reverse of Nature might prevent a great deal of Wickedness in the World, and bring many unthinking Creatures to remember and prepare for their latter End before it be too late, which I should rejoice to see. There is an excellent Passage quoted by <HI>R. S. page</HI> 104. from <HI>Thomas Moore</HI> High Chancellor of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> much to the purpose. Likewise that holy Man of God <HI>G.

And take heed of Gifts and Rewards, and of Pride, for God doth forbid them, and they do blind the Eyes of the Wise.

<P>THE Thing appeared very clearly as at other Times, that <HI>Slave-keeping,</HI> with all its Concomitants, was the worst Idol, and one of the greatest Marks of the Apostacy, in the whole World, and the very worst Part of the great Whore's Merchandise, Mystery Babylon, the Mo∣ther of Whores.</P>
<P>At this Time also it is brought to my Remembrance, with great Thankfulness to my dearest God and Father, Redeem∣er and Preserver, the great Liberty that I with many Thousands more enjoy in this good Land, which to many wise &amp; right considerate People, is much more valuable than natural Life; especially our religious Liberty; with the Plenty of all good Things needful for the Body, which many hundreds of Thousands have been and are deprived of, by the above∣named vilest, grossest and blackest of all Abominations. And for this black Scene

to be acted by them that pretend to the most pure, holy, meek, sweet and loving Principle (to all People) in the World, is to some, yea many tender hearted People beyond compare with any thing in the World; I say, for these People that pretend not to preach or to pray without the sweet holy Motion or Moving of the pure ho∣ly Spirit in their Hearts, the Unction from the Holy One, the sweet anointing Oil, the Feeling of which doth unite the Brethren, and was and is compared to the Oil that was poured upon the Head of <HI>Aaron,</HI> God's High-Priest, and ran down his Beard, so to the nethermost Skirts of his Garment, before he was to offer an Offering on the holy Altar in the Temple of the Lord; which out∣ward Oil and Anointing, Priesthood, Al∣tar, Offerings, and Temple, were but Types and Shadows of much better Things to come, of a much greater and more glorious heavenly and spiritual Temple, or House; for the Glory of this latter House doth far exceed the Glory of the former, as far as Day exceeds the Night, or Heaven exceeds the Earth, as many have come to the Experience of, blessed be the Name of the Lord Al∣mighty, who rules and reigns in his Temple, in sanctified Hearts, prepared

by himself, to do his Will and dwell in; Praises, Praises be given to his pure Name, for his holy glorious and pure Presence in his holy Temple! For such Bodies and Souls are the Temple of the Holy Ghost, the holy living God; but he or she that defiles this Temple by <HI>Slave-keeping,</HI> him may God destroy, if not repented of and forsaken. Can those Favourites of Heaven, so anointed and array'd, beyond that of <HI>Aaron</HI> more than Words can express; can these sanctified and washed ones, that have been array'd with the fine Linnen clean and white, clean and white indeed, which is the Righteousness of Saints; can these, with the Sow that was washed, turn again to wallow in the Mire of that Heathen Practice, <HI>Slave-Keeping,</HI> and worse, all things well considered; or like the Dog, a ravenous Beast, to lick up his Vomit, the filthiest and most unnatural Part or Sort of Excrement; and so is the Slave∣keeping Practice, I am very certain.</P>
<P>I verily believe there are some now in the Practice of Slave-keeping, that in the Time of their first Love and tender sweet Espousal to Christ, would have been rea∣dy to have answered if they had been as∣ked, as the Man did the Prophet, <HI>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he should do such

<P>THis Morning very early it sprung a∣gain afresh and very lively in my Mind, concerning Marriages made in the sweet Love, Fear, Wisdom and Counsel of the almighty living Lord God and eternal Father in Heaven, if we want Riches and Honour, Pleasure and Joy: What is comparable to those Marriages made only in the Lord, in the Church, in Heaven, in the Temple; but few such Marriages I fear are to be found now a Days, that are made by the Fa∣ther in Heaven, which is the Truth. But abundance of Marriages are made by the Father in Hell, the Devil, which is out of the Truth: Made by the Lust of the Eye, the Lust of the Flesh, and Pride of Life, and for Covetousness to maintain them, which is all of him that is an Enemy to all Mankind, the Devil

or Satan, if we did but know it there is no worse Devil or unclean Spirit than Self, that dwells and Rules in poor Mankind, to their Destruction Soul and Body. Self or Covetousness, says the Apostle, is the root of all Evil; tell me my Friends and Mortals, can there be a worse Devil, or more unclean Spirit or Root from which all Evil grows, or a worse Foun∣tain than that from which all our Mi∣sery flows?</P>
<P>Can there, my dear and well beloved Friends, be a better God or Holy Spirit than that, or he that leads into all Truth, which is Heaven itself, and so into all Peace and Joy; or a worse Devil or un∣holy Spirit than that which leads into all untruth, and so into all Sorrow, Destruc∣tion and Misery, which is Hell enough in my opinion, where the Worm never dies, and the Fire goes not out, and Torment enough for the wickedest of Men, and greater than I wish for the worst Ene∣mies, but rather would pray for them, that they would so live as to escape that Place or State of Torment. </P>

and if he would follow his inward true and spiritual Guide, which would never lead him wrong if he would strictly fol∣low its Counsel. I say I had many things in my Mind to write, but am a little straitned at present, and must wait to see whether this that is done may be of any Service, or in any measure well received by my Brethren, which are begotten and born again of the immortal Seed and Word of God, which lives and abides forever, and is God himself: Those thus born are his Sons and Daughters, God is their own Father, and they his own dear Children, and his Heirs, and joined or equal Heirs with Christ, in his and their Fathers Kingdom, which is and ever will remain an eternal Kingdom of GLORY or GLORIOUS GOVERNMENT where he the Holy One doth rule and govern, which is his Church, in his Peo∣ple, in his House or his Temple, in new Jerusalem, in his Sanctuary, in his King∣dom, in himself, all one and the same eternal SANCTUM SANCTORUM. Christ was not ashamed to call such spiri∣tual Souls his Brethren, which worship God in Spirit, and in his Church which is his Kingdom, saying, <HI>I will declare thy Name unto my Brethren;</HI> and after

his blessed Resurrection sent forth a Wo∣man Preacher the very first, to declare of it, and I believe to preach freely as she had freely receiv'd of him; <HI>Go tell my Brethren I am risen, and that I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God &amp; your God.</HI> O glorious Message! one of the best that ever was, and yet sent by a Woman! the glad Tidings of great Joy, that their Lord was alive that they thought was dead.

<P>Although I have writ thus much for Womens Preaching, yet I would have none go before they are sent of the Lord, no more than Men; for it is alike hate∣ful to me, and many worthy Friends, to my certain Knowledge.

and Impostors, and they were some of the worst Enemies, the very worst the Hebrews had, and procured their Ruin, Overthrow and utter Destruction, as is largely set forth in the History of the Wars of the Jews by <HI>Josephus,</HI> beside what is mentioned in holy Scripture plentifully by the holy Prophets.</P>
<P>And so it was amongst the Primitive Christians, about the Time of the Ten Persecutions, when they gat a little Ease from the Heathen Tyrants, the apostate Christians went to the same devilish Work, of murthering and butchering the true Christians, about their Creeds, keeping of Easter, and other Idols, and about the Clause of one Substance and two Substances, as if the eternal Being could be divided; But especially after <HI>Constantine</HI> the Roman Emperor was converted to the Christian Faith, in his Zeal he gave such large Donations and Revenues to the Church, that it is re∣corded, the same Day there was a Voice heard from Heaven, crying aloud, <HI>This Day is Poison poured into the Church!</HI> which the Event soon after verified.

when the Bishops, Preachers and Rulers grew rich and high, they centred in Pride, Idleness, and Fulness of Bread; then they went together by the Ears with might and main, striving who should be greatest; then to inventing and setting forth the old, nasty, fulsome, stinking Whore's Trumpery or Merchandise to Sale, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18. 13. 17. 5. and they that would not buy it, or could not receive it, might expect to be sent out of the World by all the Tortures that Wrath and Hell could invent, as they could prevail with Kings, Rulers and Govern∣ors to assist them, by unrighteous Laws and Edicts. And when the Magistrates were such Fools as to dance after their Call, they embrued whole Nations and Kingdoms in Blood. These Things are largely set forth in <HI>Eusebius'</HI>s Ecclesiasti∣cal History, an excellent sweet Book it is, and I could heartily wish all right thinking solid sober Men had one of them, especially all Magistrates and Rulers of all Persuasions.

Such as have been enlightned, and are sunk into the Earth again, are more dark and stupid than others; for Publicans and Harlots stand more ready and willing to receive the Message of the Kingdom of Heaven, which is Righte∣ousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost) than they; according to Christs Doctrine, and the Observation of the Children of God (who dwell in his King∣dom of Righteousness, which is free from all Sin) and keeps their Habitation in the Light.</P>
<P>For as dear <HI>George Fox</HI> writes, <HI>Jour∣nal, Part</HI> I. <HI>page</HI> 55, 56. he saw concer∣ning the Priests, that although they act∣ed by a dark Power, and stood in the Deceit, which they and the People were kept under, yet they were not the great∣est Deceivers spoken of in Scripture, for they were not come so far as <HI>Cain, Corah, Dathan, Balaam,</HI> and others, to hear the Voice of God, and knew it, yet these turned from the Spirit; such as these were and would be the greatest Deceiv∣ers, far beyond the Priests. Likewise

among Christians, such as could preach in Christ's Name, work Miracles, cast out Devils, &amp;c. and go as far as <HI>Cain, Corah</HI> and <HI>Balaam</HI> in Gospel Times; such as these were and would be the greatest Deceivers.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 117, 118. he advises Friends, That none appear in Words beyond what they be in the Life that gave forth the Words, here none shall be as the untime∣ly Figs: Let no Image or Likeness be made, but in the Light wait, which will bring Condemnation on that Part that would make the Images, and speaks with the Egyptian Tongue.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 224, 225, 361. All Friends that speak abroad, see that it be in the Life of God, for that begets to God; the Fruits of that shall never wither; and this sows to the Spirit which is in Prison, and of the Spirit reaps Life (to you this is the Word of the Lord God) and the other sows in the Flesh, and of the Flesh reaps Corruption. There is that which ma∣keth merry over the Witness of God; and there is that which maketh merry in the Lord. Such the Lord doth beau∣tifie, whose Trust is in his Strength: But such as be from the Light, whose Eyes be after their Abominations and

O feel Life in the Ministry, let Life be your Commission, your Well-Spring &amp; Trea∣sury in all such occasions; it is not our Parts or Memory, or Repetitions of for∣mer Openings in our will and time that will do God's Work. A dry Doctrinal Ministry, however sound in Words, can reach but the Ear, and is but a Dream at the best.</P>
<P>Page 782 to 789. 885, 6, 7. of <HI>W. Penn'</HI>s <HI>Works</HI> in <HI>Folio. Vol.</HI> I. It's the Ignorance and Idleness of the People, that gives the Clergy an opportunity to effect their Designs, for so mean-spirited are the People as to take all upon trust for their Souls, that would not trust or take a Brass Shilling from an Arch-Bishop; 'tis prodigious to think what Veneration the Priesthood has raised to themselves, by their usurpt Commission, and their Clink-Clank of extraordinary Ordina∣tion; did the People examine their Bot∣tom, the Grounds of their Religion and Faith, it would not be in the Power of

their Leaders to cause them to err. What, doubt my Minister! arraign his Doctrine! put him to proof! by no means: but the consequence of not doing of it, has been the Introduction of much false Doctrine, Superstition and Formality, (amongst the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as well as others) which gave just occasion for Schism; for the Word has no hurt in itself, and im∣plies only a Separation, which may as well be right as wrong.</P>

<P>This Book of <HI>Mercurius</HI> is thought to have been written some Hundreds of Years before <HI>Moses. J.

And they that shall judici∣ously read it and rightly understand it, may well be excused from reading of many Books, the Authors of which pretend so much to the Knowledge of the Creator and Creation. If ever God appeared in any Man, he ap∣peared in him, as appears by this Book; that a Man that had not the Benefit of his Ancestors Knowledge, being, as I said be∣fore, the first Inventor of the Art of commu∣nicating Knowledge to Posterity by Writing, should be so high a Divine, and so deep a Philosopher, seems to be a Thing more of God than of Man, and therefore it was the Opinion of some, that he came from Heaven, not born upon Earth. There is contained in this Book; that true Philosophy, without which it is impossible ever to attain the height and exactness of Piety and Religion. The

<P><HI>P.</HI> 110. A few Words concerning true Discerning and Judgment. They that have not the Spirit of Christ are none of his, but all that receive it, and have Unity with it, that walk not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit, in which they see the Shapes and Forms of every Like∣ness and Image, and Ground from whence they do arise, and no false Birth can have an hiding Place, but from the least to the greatest they are discovered; and the fair coverings that any have cloathed themselves withal is seen through, and all the formed likeness, they are all seen to be of the Flesh (in what they do pro∣fess to be of God) and their Root and Principle is of that Part and Nature that is earthly, from which no good thing can arise, and it brings forth a Birth of its own likeness, and of its own Nature, and though this may seem to be rash Judgment and you may call it so, yet it will stand a Witness against all that are satisfying the Flesh, for there is not any so hardly received as that Testimony
<PB N="173" REF="004149_0172_1003DEDD9B382B90"/>
which strikes at the Life of another, and which deals plainly and simply with all, and desires the good of all, that meets with the least Entertainment in the Hearts of the People; but that which flatters and cries Peace when the Bonds of Iniquity stands, that is pleasant to them that walk in the Flesh, but that which rips 'em up and discovers their shame they kick a∣gainst, will not receive it for Truth, for there is no Work of the Flesh that would come under the Spirit's Judgment; so every form and likeness would save its own Life by putting off the Judgment, as if none could discern it; and no false Birth would have its Nakedness appear, lest it should come to shame thereby.</P>

<P>Dear Friends, meet often together in the Name and Fear of the living God, and take heed of Words; let's see that the Witness speak, which will cut down your own wills, and it will minister to the Witness in others, to the slaying of their wills; and take heed of watching over one another with an evil Eye, to spy out one anothers Weakness, and declare it to others, and discover their Nakedness thou that art here art cursed <HI>Ham,</HI> and the Wrath of will be revealed upon thee, but watch over one another with a pure single Eye, and if thou see the pure in Bondage in any one by the deceit, whis∣per thou, not behind their Back to o∣thers, but let the Witness in thee which sees the Deceit, and suffers with the Pure that is pressed down in it, let it declare and Witness forth the mind of the living God, against the Deceit, and it will cut it down, and the Pure Holy Seed will be set at Liberty, and thy

<P>So all Children, keep your Eye with God, and with Clearness eye him in every Motion, in his everlasting Power, then will cause his Light to shine in the brightness of his everlasting Glory, which will stop all forward and dry Spirits, which is hasty to utter Words before the Lord. If any Simple Heart should utter Words through Weakness out of the Savoury Life, in what you may, bear it in the Meeting, and after speak to them to restore them in a Spirit of Meek∣ness; try all Spirits and taste the Breath from whence the Words proceed, and not to lay your Hands hastily on any, whatever they may pretend, but in that which tries and weighs your own Spirits in coolness and singleness of Heart, try

The People in these Countries of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> have been Blessed with a great deal of Plenty and quiet living for many Years; it is to be feared many, yea the greatest Number by far are grown luke∣warm, as to Religion especially, and are become careless, forgetful and negligent to make suitable returns to the Almigh∣ty for his innumerable favours which he hath been pleased to shower down upon us continually in such abundance, both Spiritually and Temporally for Body and Soul. I believe there was a time when many tender Souls (I hope there is some yet left) lived in a Divine Sense of these great Blessings, and sincerely en∣deavoured to make suitable returns or acknowledgments to the Lord, the Giver, for the same; by walking and living an Holy, Pious, Temperate, Righteous, Just and a Strict self-denying Life, and and so manifested their Sincerity and Love to the ever Blessed <HI>TRUTH,</HI> in the sight of God and Man.</P>

<P><HI>FOR AS MUCH as</HI> LIBERTY <HI>is in real value next unto</HI> Life; <HI>None ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon most mature Consideration.</HI></P>
<P>The Numerousness of Slaves at this Day in the Province, and the Uneasiness of them under their Slavery, hath put many upon thinking whether the Foun∣dation of it be firmly and well laid; so as to sustain the Vast Weight that is built upon it. It is most certain that all Men, as they are the Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> are Coheirs; and have equal Right unto Liberty, and all other outward Comforts of Life. <HI>GOD hath given the Earth</HI> [with all its Commodities] <HI>unto the Sons of</HI> Adam, <HI>Psal.</HI> 115. 16. <HI>And hath made of One Blood, all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the face of the Earth, and hath determined the Times before appoint∣ed, and the bounds of their Habitation: That they should seek the Lord. For as much then as we are the Offspring of GOD,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Acts.</HI> 17. 26, 27, 29. Now although the Title given by the last <HI>ADAM,</HI> doth infinitely better Mens Estates, respecting

GOD and themselves; and grants them a most beneficial and inviolable Lease un∣der the Broad Seal of Heaven, who were before only Tenants at Will: Yet through the Indulgence of GOD to our First Pa∣rents after the Fall, the outward Estate of all and every of their Children, re∣mains the same, as to one another. So that Originally, and Naturally, there is no such thing as Slavery. <HI>Joseph</HI> was rightfully no more a Slave to his Bre∣thren, than they were to him; and they had no more Authority to <HI>Sell</HI> him, than they had to <HI>Slay</HI> him. And if <HI>they</HI> had nothing to do to Sell him; the <HI>Isbmaclites</HI> bargaining with them, and paying down Twenty pieces of Silver, could not make a Title. Neither could <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tiphar</HI> have any better Interest in him than the <HI>Isb∣maclites</HI> had. <HI>Gen.</HI> 37, 20, 27, 28. For he that shall in this case plead <HI>Alteration of Property,</HI> seems to have forfeited a great part of his own claim to Humanity. There is no proportion between Twenty Pieces of Silver, and LIBERTY. The Commodity itself is the Claimer. If <HI>Arabian</HI> Gold be imported in any quan∣tities, most are afraid to meddle with it, though they might have it at easy rates; lest if it should have been wrongfully
<PB N="201" REF="004149_0200_1003BAC574944FD8"/>
taken from the Owners, it should kindle a fire to the Consumption of their whole Estate. 'Tis pity there should be more Caution used in buying a Horse, or a lit∣tle lifeless dust; than there is in purchas∣ing Men and Women: Whenas they are the Offspring of GOD, and their Liber∣ty is,</P>
<P>—<HI>Auro pretiosior Omni.</HI></P>
<P>And seeing GOD hath said, <HI>He that Stealeth a Man and Selleth him, or if he be found in his Hand, he shall surely be put to Death.</HI> Exod. 21. 16. This Law being of Everlasting Equity, wherein Man-Stealing is ranked amongst the most atrocious of Capital Crimes: What lou∣der Cry can there be made of that Cele∣brated Warning,</P>
<P><HI>Caveat Emptor!</HI></P>
<P>And all things considered, it would conduce more to the Welfare of the Pro∣vince, to have White Servants for a Term of Years, than to have Slaves for Life. Few can endure to hear of a Ne∣gro's being made free; and indeed they can seldom use their Freedom well; yet their continual aspiring after their for∣bidden Liberty, renders them Unwilling Servants. And there is such a disparity in their Conditions, Colour and Hair,
<PB N="202" REF="004149_0201_1003DFED2721A788"/>
that they can never embody with us, &amp; grow up in orderly Families, to the Peopling of the Land: but still remain in our Body Politick as a kind of extra∣vasat Blood. As many Negro Men as there are among us, so many empty Pla∣ces there are in our Train Bands, and the places taken up of Men that might make Husbands for our Daughters. And the Sons and Daughters of <HI>New-England</HI> would become more like <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Rachel,</HI> if this Slavery were thrust quite out of Doors. Moreover it is too well known what Temptations Masters are un∣der, to connive at the Fornication of their Slaves; lest they should be obliged to find them Wives, or pay their Fines. If seems to be practically pleaded that they might be Lawless; 'tis thought much of, that the Law should have Satis∣faction for their Thefts, and other Im∣moralities; by which means, <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> is more rarely engraven upon this sort of Servitude. It is likewise most lamentable to think, how in taking Negroes out of <HI>Africa,</HI> and Selling of them here, That which GOD has joined together, Men do boldly rend asunder; Men from their Country, Husbands from their Wives, Parents from their Children.

How horrible is the Uncleanness, Mor∣tality, if not Murder, that the Ships are guilty of that bring great Crouds of these miserable Men and Women. Methinks, when we are bemoaning the barbarous Usage of our Friends and Kinsfolk in <HI>Africa,</HI> it might not be unseasonable to enquire whether we are not culpable in forcing the <HI>Africans</HI> to become Slaves amongst ourselves. And it may be a question whether all the Benefit received <HI>by Negro</HI> Slaves, will balance the Ac∣compt of Cash laid out upon them; and for the Redemption of our own enslaved Friends out of <HI>Africa.</HI> Besides all the Persons and Estates that have perished there.</P>

to sit at the Lord's Table, in <HI>New-Jerusalem,</HI> and sup with him, him himself, and he with them in his own Government or Kingdom, and this is the Supper of the Lord, &amp; the Fellowship &amp; Communion of Saints, who said, <HI>Come, come and have Fellowship with us; for Verily, Verily or truly, our Fellowship is with the Father and the Son.</HI> Is not this <HI>Paradise</HI> itself, to Eat and Drink in the presence of God and Angels. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. and this is perfectly agreeable to what TRUTH promised and said, <HI>I stand at the Door, and knock or call, if any one will hear and regard, or obey my Voice, and open to me in all Obedience, I will come in and sup with him, and he with me, and the Father and we will make our abode with him.</HI> Oh holy abode! no Sin here, No, No, No, surely no, these dear Children Worship their Father, and serve him Night and Day in his Temple with all Alacrity; so these Heaven-Born favourites do know the Gospel and the New-Birth to be Spiritual, the Baptism, the Resurrection, and the Lord's-Supper to be Spiritual, and not carnal or natural. So they that know the New-Birth, they know all the other, for they are all one, in Essence Divine, he that hath one in

possession cannot miss of all the other if he would; this is for them that know the TRUTH, for to others they are but as Mysterious Parables, for the Natural, Earthly, Covetous, Carnal minded Man or Woman knows not these things, nei∣ther can they, because they are made known and manifested by the Holy Spirit the TRUTH only, and a Hundred Thousand Ship-Loads of the best of Books, and all the Earthly Worldly Wisdom, and Natural Learning in the whole World, either in Preachers or Hearers, cannot make manifest the know∣ledge of these things; for he that loves the World, and the things of the World, the Love of the Father is not in him, so as to reveal the Mysteries of the Govern∣ment or Kingdom of Heaven unto him, and in him.</P>
<P>So that I may truly say, this Hea∣venly New-Birth is the chiefest good to bring us to the sure and certain knowledge of Heavenly things, and no other way, this, this, this is the Key that opens the Mysteries of <HI>Truth'</HI>s Government, this is the Rock of Ages, &amp; Foundation on which <HI>Truth</HI> doth and ever will build his Congre∣gation; and Hell, Satan, Sin and Death shall never be able to prevail against it.</P>

<P>Little Children, let no Man deceive you; he that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</P>

<P>Now consider my dear Fellow Crea∣tures, of all Names, while you are com∣mitting of sin, and living in sin, you are established in Satan's Government or Kingdom, and built and building on his Foundation, which is sandy or worse, you may read and pray, sing Songs or Psalms at home, or go to Meetings, carry your Bibles under your Arms, make an Idol of them, and hear Preaching or Praying, either by Form or Extempore or receive the Bread and Wine, call it Communion, but it is with Satan, you may go and be Sprinkled, Dipt and Plunged a Hundred or a Thousand times calling it Baptism, yet it is all of Satan, while in sin, you may go to <HI>Q----r'</HI>s Meeting and sit in silence, fall asleep, fall fast asleep, then wake, first fall a sighing, spitting or blowing the Nose,

stand up pretending to Preach, kneel down pretending to pray, or sit or stand to hear Preaching and Praying, its all of Satan, while in sin, the new Moons and Sabbaths, Sabbaths, Sabbaths, and most solemn Gatherings or Assemblies, were a cursed Abomination to the Lord of old, although of his own appointment, while their Hearts were after Satan and their Idols; their offering Swines Blood, cut∣ting off a Dog's Neck, or slaying of a Man was not more offensive to God, because both done in the Spirit of Satan, &amp; so it is now with the Nominal Christians; for the Plowing of the Wicked is sin, tho' nothing more warrantable scarsly in this World; an offering well accepted in <HI>Abel,</HI> rejected and cursed in <HI>Cain,</HI> because his Heart was not right in the sight of God; are not some of us as bad as they were.

Some of these are Ministers and Elders, but sleepy dead Weights, and very great Burthens in Meetings, especially a false and forward Ministry, which intrude in∣to Things which they know not, but what they know naturally, as brute Beasts, and are vainly pufft up in a flesh∣ly carnal Mind; with such our Meetings are often annoyed and disturbed, whose Voices being that of the Stranger, which I very well know, dear Lambs, you can∣not follow or join with, for they are fit∣ly compared to the unclean Beasts, which mudled and dirtied the pure Water with their Feet: Such as these in our Meet∣ings when gathered together, and the true Sheep and Lambs of Christ's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old are drawing near the Fountain of eternal

That <HI>Cain</HI> is wroth and his Countenance falls, then <HI>Abel</HI> must be slain; the true seed oppressed and kept in Bondage, and the false Birth reigns and bears Rule with great Authority seemingly, to the carnal Mind: But the pure humble, meek and lowly precious Seed of the Government, Kingdom, and true Heir of God, and joined Heirs with Christ sits very still and quiet, waiting for the blessed little River, that makes glad the whole City, Habitation, Con∣gregation or Church of God; to rise

on, acted and done with the face and ap¦pearance of Religion and Sanctity, and under pretence of Preaching the Gospel too, this is the very Secret of Secrets, of the Mystery of Iniquity and the depth of Satan, which many Thousands amongst us I believe doth not see, and here Satan doth work safely, and will work until he is discovered by the single Eye, the cleansed Eye of the mind, that is opened and cleansed by the very Light and Power of Truth itself, and kept open too, and clean in and by the Eternal Light and Life of Truth, or else the Dirt or Dust of the Earth, may and will get in again, and stop the Eye up again, and make it more dark and blind than ever, never, never more to be opened, and this is a sad dismal State indeed for any to fall in∣to, deplorable, never, never, never to be re∣covered.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They that are not right lye down in sorrow, tho' they hide it from others for a time; they feel it themselves, but having once began to Preach for same base End, they are ashamed to, and afraid to leave off, altho' they are convicted and condemned in their own Con∣sciences, clearly and heavily, to be sure, and so it follows,</HI> he that doubts is Damned, <HI>as it is Written.</HI></P>

Hammer nor Ax, nor any Tool of Iron heard or to be heard, all things were made ready be∣fore they were brought there, and yet that was built by Men, but the Glory of the latter House, in</HI> New-Jerusalem <HI>doth and shall exceed, and be and is greater than the Glory of the for∣mer House, as much as Light, Darkness, and Heaven, the Earth, the former was a Type, the latter the Anti-Type, the former was Built by Men to abide for a time, and of Earthly Materials, the latter was, is and ever shall be Built by</HI> TRUTH <HI>itself, of Hea∣venly Substance, and shall abide forever; Glory be to the pure</HI> TRUTH <HI>alone, that was and is, and is to come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> My Friend, <HI>if there was such, and so much care, quietness, stilness, silence and awfulness in Building that outward natural House, Built by Men but for a time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How much more abundantly had we need to be in an awful, reverend, holy, pure, still and-quiet frame of mind, when we meet to∣gether in order for the Building up of this in∣ward and Spiritual House,</HI> New-Jerusalem, <HI>whose Builder and Maker is God himself the Eternal</HI> TRUTH, <HI>and none else but he, and he himself alone, which was and is, is, is, to come, the</HI> Alpha <HI>and</HI> Omega, <HI>the Author as well as finisher of our most Holy Faith.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Dear</HI> John, <HI>this Morning I was in my Garden pulling up some Weeds, it came in my mind what was objected against me lately, by one that ministers amongst us</HI> N. A. <HI>and hath done near</HI> 20 <HI>Years; that I was for setting up some Ministers, and pulling down others, Now,</HI> Dear Friend, <HI>I must confess I do not approve of a false Minister, much less to set him up, neither would I pull down the True by no means, nor touch the truely anointed to do them any harm, for they are very near to my Life I can truely say without any reserve, and I hope ever will be while I have a Being, But if one should ask any Friend, even a false Minister himself, if we might at any Time receive, should or ought to encourage a false Minister, or approve, join and unite with him in Prayer or in his Testimony, he would answer in the Negative, no, no, if not for
<PB N="263" REF="004149_0262_1003E18F2B659A98"/>
Conscience yet for fear of shame or blame, but then, says he,</HI> who shall be Judge, <HI>why truely I may say if we have no Judgment in our goings and doings, we are in a very poor dark Condition, as well as other People, as false Ministers and Prodigals would have us, that we might receive such Husks as they have to feed Swine withal, but the True Children in our the True Kingdom cannot feed on such Chaff, if they offer to receive it by conniving at or seemingly approving of or joining with such Swine-Herds, in Prayer or Testimony they will be in danger of being Choaked, for they them∣selves have not true Peace, their Master Satan cannot give it them; now if any one offer to prove or make manifest their pretentions to Preaching is all Deceit and Cheat, and their seeming seed Corn, nothing but Chaff and Husk, their Peace flys away at once, like Chaff before a strong Wind; this I have often seen in</HI> England, <HI>here and else-where. This Chaff,</HI> Dear Friend, <HI>will not do for Children, the Beast, the Beasts, Beasts can feed on it, for it is agreeable to their Natures as Bread is to Children, like loves its like.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This little or lesser Beast, with his two Horns like a Lamb, but spake like a Dragon, like the Dragon that gave his Power to the first Beast and his Seat, and great Authority to rule and govern in the Church with an high

Hand in a lordly manner, and they that would or could not submit to his Commands, although never so unjust and unreasonable, he spake as a Dragon, especially if any found it their Duty to contradict and oppose his usurped Au∣thority, and his unjust Commands, and Ar∣bitrary Proceedings, such must expect no Mercy from him, and yet have all the Pro∣fession and outward appearance of a meek follower of the dear Lamb, who suffered the contradictions of sinners, for our sakes, that we might follow his Example; so the Beast, I say the Beast had two Horns like a Lamb, got into the outward Form as much as possible, the more craftily to deceive, and thus the Beast is a Beast still, being a little outwardly re∣formed in Speech and Habit; he then gets to Preaching, and that is his Master-Piece, and here Satan is exalted, and shows himself that he is God, chief Ruler, and here Satan's Chieftains thinks they reign in Glory or glo∣riously, and may be others think so too, that see 'em and hear 'em hold forth, such I mean that knows not any thing, but what they know naturally, as Brute Beasts; so e'en let those Swine-Herds, with their Herds of Swine go down into the Sea, and be choaked together, if they please; that the true Sheep and Lambs might never more be troubled with them, would be joyful News to a many afflicted

dear Souls, who go mourning on their Way because of the Oppressor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is likewise some others, amongst us, I am well satisfied, that have been fa∣voured with a Part, and a Portion, and a good Portion too, of the ministry, with the Saints and faithful ones, and have reigned with them in the Firmament of God's Power, and I would to God, that they did reign so still; but alas, alas, some of these are fallen, not from Words, but from Life, and that is all in all. The Dragon's Tail hath prevailed, drawn 'em down to the Earth, they smell and favour of it, that were once fresh and lively, feed∣ing in the green Pastures, loved to sit in Silence in Meetings; as silent as a Flock of Sheep and Lambs in a Field, sweetly feeding, without Noise of Words; but, a∣las, some of these are grown restless and uneasy in sitting in Silence; but must and will be hammering and tampering, es∣pecially, if they feel but a little tickling of some former or old Experience, or a Drop of Wine in their old Bottle, undigested and unrefined, thick and muddy, the Bottle not being very clean: However having a strong Opinion of their own Performances, and a rich Conceit of the great good they do, and have done; to Work they go, with
<PB N="266" REF="004149_0265_1003E199A5C7A568"/>
Noise of Words, and oftentimes no Sense. Then comes forth the Tongue of</HI> Egyptian <HI>Sea, and the Language of</HI> Ashdod <HI>is heard, and the linsey-woolsey Garment is seen, and the plowing is managed with the Ox and the Ass joined together; poor plow∣ing with Beasts so ill matched, so unequal in their Nature and Stature, one drawing one way, and another another way; and then the Field is sown with two Sorts of Seed, may-be a little good and a great deal of bad. Dear Friend, I wish these Plow∣ers and Sowers would stand still a little, and look over the Field they have plowed, and sown, and behold the Produce of their Labours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Those that go forth with Sparks of their own kindling, shall lye down in Sorrow. I think, Oh that these would wait for the still, still Voice, that would direct them a∣right, when and what to speak to the Peo∣ple, and when to be silent; and not go forth in the hurry and bluster of their own Spirits, in their own Time, but wait the Lord's Time: Nor in the Fire, nor the Wind, nor the Earthquake, where the pure</HI> TRUTH <HI>is not known, nor his Voice heard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I say again, I wish those that have been so long plowing with their ill-matcht pair
<PB N="267" REF="004149_0266_1003E19B27FAD530"/>
of Creatures, and sowing the Field with divers Kinds of Seeds, would, or could be prevailed upon, to stand still a little and be quieted, and look back and round about the Field, and see what sort of Plowing they have made, and what Sort of Seed they have sown, and what Sort of Grain is grown up; whether there is not</HI> 30, 60 <HI>or an Hundred Fold more bad than good, and if so, sure there have been a great deal of bad Seed sown in the Field, or it would not have been so (I firmly believe.) I do not believe it is all owing to the Badness of the Ground, but for want of honest Labour performed, by Faithful and True Labour∣ers, and then to have good, weighty, sound, clean, pure substantial Seed sown, without Mixture, in it, by such Seed Men and Wo∣men, and such I love as my own Soul, much more that which dwells and grows in them or in us, the pure eternal Truth. Now my Friend, let all the impudent, false, forward, restless, uneasy, bold, self∣conceited, turbulent, noisey, clamorous, covetous, selfwilled Preachers, Plowers and Sowers in our Meetings, look over the Field where they have laboured, and com∣pare it with any of their Neighbour's Fields, and see whether it be in any better Condition than theirs, if not much worse, all

things well considered. The Advantages we have had and the great Favours that have been bestowed upon us, more than any People in the whole World, that I know of, since the Apostles Days.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friend</HI> J. C. <HI>is it not written, if thou takest a Bird's Nest thou shalt not destroy the Dam, and the young, the young; but shall let the Dam go; but some of these forward Spirits destroy all, lavish out all, leave their Nest empty of all good, not con∣sidering there should be Store of good Seed left for Increase; and are like the foolish Idolaters, that lavish Silver out of the Bag to enrich and beautify their Idols and are left poor and needy themselves, And so it is with these Idolaters, these prophane</HI> Esau's; <HI>a Mess of Pottage or Porridge, a rich Wife or Husband, world∣ly Honour and Profit, the Good of the Bel∣ly or Applause amongst Men, or some other base sinister Ends. Oh these</HI> Nimrods! <HI>these mighty Hunters before the Lord, be∣fore him, not Followers of him, not Follow∣ers of the dear Lamb, thro' Sufferings and Death, in the Cross, in an holy, severe, strict, pure Life of Self-Denial and the daily Cross, this daily Cross, how contrary it is to proud idle lustful Flesh and Blood, what a Burthen it is to it, the very

<L>THE Apostles Ministry perform'd, and race well run,</L>
<L>Their doctrine, and their story written left,</L>
<L>They die. But in their room, as they fore-warn,</L>
<L>Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves</L>
<L>Who all the sacred mysteries of heav'n</L>
<L>To their own vile advantages shall turn,</L>
<L>Of lucre, and ambition; and the truth</L>
<L>With superstitions, and traditions taint,</L>
<L>Left only in those written records pure;</L>
<L>Though not but by the <HI>Spirit</HI> understood.</L>
<L>Then shall they seek t'avail themselves of names,</L>
<L>Places, and titles; and with these to join</L>
<L>Secular pow'r; though feigning still to act</L>
<L>By spiritual: to themselves appropriating</L>
<L>The <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> promis'd alike, and giv'n</L>
<L>To all believers: and, from that Pretence,</L>
<L>Spiritual laws by carnal pow'r shall force</L>
<L>On every conscience; laws! which none shall find</L>
<L>Left them inroll'd; or, what the <HI>Spirit</HI> within</L>
<L>Shall on the heart ingrave. What will they then</L>
<L>But force the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Grace it self, and bind</L>
<L>His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild</L>
<L>His living Temple, built by faith to stand,</L>
<L>Their own faith, not another's? (for, on earth,</L>
<L>Who against faith and conscience, can be heard</L>
<L>Infallible?) Yet, many will presume:</L>
<L>Whence heavy persecution shall arise</L>
<L>On all, who in the worship persevere</L>
<L>Of spirit, and truth: the rest (far greater part)</L>
<L>Will deem in outward rites, and specious forms,</L>

Bestruck with sland'rous darts; and works of faith</L>
<L>Rarely be found. So shall the World go on,</L>
<L>To good malignant, to bad men benign;</L>
<L>Under her own weight groaning; 'till the day</L>
<L>Appear of respiration to the just,</L>
<L>And vengeance to the Wicked: at return</L>
<L>Of <HI>Him</HI> so lately promis'd to thy aid,</L>
<L>The Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold;</L>
<L>Now amplier known thy <HI>Saviour,</HI> and thy <HI>Lord;</HI></L>
<L>Last, in the clouds, from heav'n to be reveal'd</L>
<L>In glory of the <HI>Father,</HI> to dissolve</L>
<L><HI>Satan,</HI> with his perverted world; then raise</L>
<L>From the conflagrant mass, purg'd, and refin'd,</L>
<L>New heav'ns, new earth, ages of endless date,</L>
