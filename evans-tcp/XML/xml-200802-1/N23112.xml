<Q>BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS MOVE ME, NEITHER COUNT I MY LIFE DEAR UNTO MYSELF, SO THAT I MIGHT FINISH MY COURSE WITH JOY, AND THE MINISTRY WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED OF THE LORD JESUS.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of the great apostle Paul. He addressed them to the elders of the church of Ephe∣sus. These elders endeavoured to dissuade him from going to Jerusalem, as they imagined he would there be exposed to great troubles and dangers, from the enemies of the gospel. The apostle considered it his duty to go. He was very desirous of preaching christianity to his countrymen, the Jews, who dwelt at Jerusalem. He was determined not to be prevented, by the formidable pic∣ture of impending dangers, set before him. He expect∣ed troubles, and was prepared to meet and bear them, with fortitude, and patience. "None of these things move me."</P>
<P>HE expresses a firm and unshaken resolution, to pur∣sue the path of duty, discovered to him, notwithstand∣ing the difficulties and hazards which might attend it. He had engaged in a good cause, in a good work, and
<PB N="6" REF="030548_0004_0FE7A77E96BF798F8"/>
he would not desert it, because the duties of it could not be performed, but with great danger and self-denial. In this he set a noble example, to the followers of CHRIST, in general, and to his ministers in particular. "Hav∣ing put their hand to the plough they should not look back." They should not neglect any known duty, what∣ever may be the expence or pain of performing it.</P>
<P>IN the following words of our text he rises, in the ex∣pression of a holy zeal and heroick courage. "Neither count I my life dear to me, that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have re∣ceived of the LORD JESUS." He had "received the ministry" of the gospel, or an apostleship, "of the LORD JESUS," who is the great LORD of the harvest, whose sovereign province it is to send labourers into his vineyard. This apostle had a clear, a special, an extra∣ordinary call to this work. The call he had accepted; and to the service he had devoted his life. Therefore to <HI>wear it out,</HI> or even to <HI>lay it down,</HI> in that sacred em∣ployment, was not so painful to his mind and appre∣hension, as the thought of quitting the work or doing the duties of it slightly. He had set out in the christ∣ian <HI>course;</HI> he had engaged in the christian <HI>ministry.</HI> To finish these well was his great object. This so strongly engaged his attention and pursuit, as to give him a noble elevation of soul, above the obstructions and discourage∣ments which might lie in the way. He expected his life would be spent, and perhaps shortned by a diligent and faithful performance of his duty as a christian, and especially as a christian minister. He laid his account in this, and the event proved his calculation just.</P>
<P>PAUL went to Jerusalem. After he had preached the gospel there, for a season, and with some success, the Jews, in a tumultuous manner seized him, and brought him before their ecclesiastical court. They accused him of subverting their system of religion, and of teaching things contrary to the law of Moses. He made a clear, rational, and animated defence. But finding it did not
<PB N="7" REF="030548_0005_0FE7C58DE4932CA8"/>
satisfy the partial bigotted judges, before whom he was brought, he appealed to Caesar, the roman emperor. After a while, he was sent to Rome, to take his trial there. His trial was long delayed. During the delay, he enjoyed some liberty. He improved it, in promot∣ing a cause, which lay near to his heart, and was dearer to him than his life. He preached the gospel, planted christian churches, and wrote epistles. After a while he was confined a prisoner at Rome. In prison he wrote several of those invaluable epistles, which we have in the new-testament, and which constitute part of the sacred canon. After he was liberated from this con∣finement, which continued about two years, he travelled over great part of Italy, preaching the gospel, and found∣ing churches. He went to Spain, to Crete, to Philippi, to Macedonia; and at length, returned to Rome, about the year of the christian aera 65. The sacred history doth not particularly inform us, what brought on his second imprisonment, at Rome, and his death. But some of the antient fathers, and particularly St. Chryso∣stom, tell us, in their writings, that he having converted, by his ministry, a cupbearer, and a concubine, of the emperor Nero, who was a bitter enemy, and cruel per∣secutor, of christianity, he was so enraged, that he order∣ed Paul to be seized, and committed to prison: That from prison he was brought forth, and beheaded, at a place called the <HI>salvian waters,</HI> on the 29th day of June, A. D. 66: That he was buried at <HI>Ostium;</HI> and that af∣terwards, when the roman empire became christian, a magnificent church was built over his tomb, which, Mr. Calmet, in his dictionary, says continue to this day. Thus this great apostle to the Gentiles, "finished his course, and the ministry which he had received of the LORD JESUS," by the honors of martyrdom. No man, it is likely, ever did as much in spreading the gospel, and promoting the cause of CHRIST, as he. That his sufferings, in his cause were exceedingly great and pres∣sing, we may collect, from the history of the acts of the apostles, and from several of his own letters, before he sealed his testimony to the truth and goodness of that cause, by his blood.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="030548_0006_0FE7C558F160F80"/>
BUT is this a just picture of what the ministers of CHRIST'S religion are to expect, and of what they do in general suffer? In answer to this enquiry, it may be said, that there hath been no small similarity between the services and sufferings of this eminent servant of CHRIST, and those of many, who were his brethren and companions, "in the kingdom and patience of JESUS;" especially in the early days of christianity, when its pro∣moters generally met with warm opposition, and cruel persecution. The case has been very different, at some periods, and in some countries since. This difference hath been strikingly obvious, in our happy land, in which the principles of religious liberty have been so well un∣derstood; and maintained; and in which, the faithful ministers of the gospel, instead of being persecuted, have been honoured, and encouraged, by men of the best and most respectable characters in civil stations.</P>
<P>BUT can we hence pronounce, that labourers, in this part of CHRIST'S vineyard, have no trials and difficul∣ties, connected with their profession and employment? This would, undoubtedly, be carrying the matter too far, and saying what is universally found by experience not to be true.</P>
<P>INDEED for one, in that profession, to exhibit a long and dark catalogue of the trials and troubles which at∣tend it, might lead some to suspect, that he aimed to make a merit to himself, in the fortitude and patience with which he meets, and bears such trials and troubles. I wish not to fall under such an imputation, or suspicion. Still I do not conceive it amiss for one, in the profession, before mentioned, to suggest some of the burthens and difficulties which can hardly be separated from it. This may tend to excite a proper degree of candor and ten∣derness, in his fellow christians towards him, and to en∣gage their prayers for him. "He who wears the shoe, best knows where it is strait and pinches," to use a common remark; or to use one of Solomon's, "the heart knoweth his own bitterness."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="030548_0007_0FE7C58F6F0D22B0"/>
No small part of the difficulty of a gospel minister's work and office, consists in properly "taking heed to himself." To maintain that spirituality, that devout and pious frame of mind, and that sober circumspect course of conduct, which the christian character requires, and which is peculiarly requisite, to support and adorn the ministerial, is no easy thing, even for a good man. Great watchfulness, servent prayer, and help from above, are necessary to it. The ministers of religion are com∣pared to "a city set on a hill which cannot be hid." Many eyes are upon them. These are not always the eyes of candor and friendship, but too often of suspi∣cion and malevolence. What minister can be always so circumspect and cautious, as to avoid creating, though without intending it, a number of little piques and ene∣mies, against himself? He may do it sometimes, even by an inflexible discharge of necessary duties. And if his character must be taken from those whom he has thus innocently, perhaps laudably, offended, all his vir∣tues will be thrown into the back ground, and his foibles magnified with the utmost virulence of malice, and resentment.</P>
<P>No part of his professional business, which a christian minister has to perform, is without it's attendant trials and difficulties. He must, through a great proportion of his time, apply himself to close study. "This is easy employment," some may be ready to pronounce; and those would be most likely to pronounce such an opinion, with confidence, who know least of the matter. An ancient Sage, who knew what it is to apply his mind to a great variety of subjects, to acquire science, and in∣vestigate truth, remarks, "that much study is a weari∣ness to the flesh." Close exertion of the mind preys rapidly on the body. It relaxes and weakens the various springs of the animal machine. It impairs the powers of digestion; hence crudities abound, producing that very afflictive and variegated tribe of disorders, called <HI>nervous,</HI> and <HI>hypochondriac,</HI> by which no class of men suffer so much, as the sedentary and studious. They
<PB N="10" REF="030548_0008_0FE7C55ACDE23EB8"/>
often become strangers to quiet repose, and refreshing sleep. All the springs of life are weakened, and the period of it frequently accelerated. Great students sel∣dom enjoy a healthful vigorous state of body, for any considerable space of time. Their lot is often an early old age, and premature death.</P>
<P>WILL it not require the vigorous employment of all the powers of the christian pastor's mind, to search out the various truths and duties, contained in the sacred oracles? To shew their harmony and connection? In weekly compositions, to astort and arrange them, in plain and familiar language; and in a manner adapted to the different ages, characters and circumstances of his peo∣ple? To endeavour, by a proper application of them, to awaken the thoughtless and secure; to lead the weary and heavy laden to rest and safety in CHRIST; to re∣move from hypocrites their false hopes and confidences, that they may build on the sure corner stone, laid in Zion; to comfort the meek and humble followers of Jesus, when their spirits are depressed, with gloomy apprehensions of their state and character; and to guide all into that way of salvation, revealed in the gospel? The person who supposes such services can be perform∣ed, and such stated instructions prepared, without much close study, and great application of mind, judges quite erroneously. He must have paid very little attention to the matter.</P>
<P>As to the labor of <HI>public speaking,</HI> from sabbath to sabbath, and on other days of social worship, some may suppose it light and inconsiderable. Do such judge rightly? Do they judge by experience? The experiment will shew such an opinion to be unfounded, and must have taught all who have made it, that to stand for seve∣ral hours, and to speak, with a voice loud and forcible enough to be heard, by a large assembly, require no small exertions of strength; and that few things will sooner spend and exhaust it. Not only the lungs, and other organs of speech, are kept on the strain; but the
<PB N="11" REF="030548_0009_0FE7C5954A6116D8"/>
powers of the mind must, at the same time, be vigor∣ously exercised. There must be a constant concern to speak clearly and properly. In most assemblies the preacher has the additional trial, of seeing some before him, whose attention he is not able to gain, by his best endeavours, to prepare useful instructions, and to de∣liver them with propriety; some who, either fall asleep, or appear quite heedless and inattentive, "hearing as though they heard not;" others who, if they hear, it is not with the best disposition; it is rather with a view, to watch for faults, and to make uncandid remarks, than to be instructed, and excited to a faithful perform∣ance of duty. A mere mistake, in the speaker, will, by such persons, be magnified into a crime; and any little impropriety, or uncouthness, in his accents, pro∣nunciation, or gesture, will be more noticed, than the most useful and important sentiments; will be remem∣bred longer, and be mentioned oftner, either to censure, or ridicule the performer. The present speaker, how∣ever liable he may be to such remarks, has the satisfac∣tion to think, there are as few, among his stated hearers, disposed to make them, as in most assemblies.</P>
<P>BUT there is another thing, which may be still more likely to excite unfriendly feelings, in many persons towards their minister, and consequently be an exercise to his faith and patience. His office obliges him to be plain and faithful in his public addresses, to reprove the vicious, to warn them of their danger, to call them to repentance, to urge on them the performance of neg∣lected duties, and to press such a virtuous and godly conversation, as is contrary to a carnal heart, and a corrupt disposition. Such exhortations and admoni∣tions will generally be ungrateful to the more loose and vicious part of an audience. Will they not be apt to feel, towards their religious instructor, much as Ahab did towards the prophet Micajah, though they should not express their feelings, in so plain terms? "I hate him, for he always prophesieth evil concerning me."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="030548_0010_0FE7C55C55834748"/>
STILL more difficult it may be, for a christian mini∣ster to give private counsel, exhortation and reproof, without awakening the resentment of those whom he addresses, and bringing on himself the pointed marks of their displeasure. Yet faithfulness to GOD, and to them, will not suffer him to neglect this difficult and pain∣ful duty.</P>
<P>THE service, to which a minister is often called, of visiting and conversing with the sick, frequently involves in it great difficulties, trials, and temptations. He many times finds persons, in sore distress, both of body and mind. Their situation strongly excites compassion. His heart must be hard and unfeeling indeed, not to be tenderly moved. As to many of these persons, he may have no ground, from their former lives and con∣versation, to judge favourably of their spiritual state. He wishes to speak words of comfort to them, and to apply the promises of the gospel, to dispel their fears, and ease their pained minds. His bowels of pity and tenderness almost constrain him to do it. But he is anxious, left this should produce a false peace, and lead them to rest on deceptive hopes; left it should prevent that sense of guilt and danger, which they ought to en∣tertain, in order to lay them low, humble, and penitent, at the feet of divine mercy, and to excite them to em∣ploy their remaining moments, and their last breath, in ardent cries to a compassionate GOD and SAVIOUR, for pardoning mercy, and sanctifying grace. What can the minister do? If he deals plainly and faithfully, through from the most benevolent motives, he may be deemed cruel: He may grieve and offend the sick persons, and their surrounding friends. Those who have never been called to perform the part of a gospel minister's duty, which we are considering, will hardly conceive the dif∣ficulties which in many cases attend it. Great wisdom is requisite so to unite fidelity and tenderness; that a dangerous presumption may not be encouraged, nor a fatal despondency produced, in the last and important days, and hours of sickness, and of life.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030548_0011_0FE7C596D3108228"/>
ANOTHER thing, in the situation of a minister of re∣ligion, will, by persons acquainted with human nature, be considered as painful and selfdenying, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> his being obliged to give up his independence, so far as many of his people seem to expect; so far as to make himself subservient to their call, their will, and, too of∣ten, to their humour; so far as to have scarcely any time which he can call his own; so far as not to be al∣lowed to claim many of the common rights of human nature, with that free and independent spirit, with which other good men among his people do it, without giv∣ing any offence. He ought undoubtedly to adopt the language, and sentiment of the great apostle, who owned himself "his people's servant for JESUS' sake;" and to be willing in a sober and consistent sense, "to become all things to all men; " i. e. to discover a kind, yielding, and condescending disposition. But is it certain that this would give universal satisfaction? There may be, in most societies, a number who expect their minister should make a greater sacrifice than this to please them. He must forbear to declare his opinion, with that decent freedom which others use, upon religious, domestic, or political subjects, concerning which a diversity of sen∣timents prevails among his people. Many individuals may be ready to claim a right of prohibiting their mini∣ster from expressing an opinion contrary to their's. If he doth not yield to that prohibition, he will hardly fail of meeting with the displeasure of the persons, from whom he dares to dissent. Ministers, as well now, as in the day of our SAVIOUR'S abode upon earth, need to be "wise as serpents, and harmless as doves." And when they sincerely desire and endeavour to be so, it is hardly to be expected they should be so fortunate as to give offence to none. Their concessions may not come up to the wishes of some. Is it possible to please all, when so many, and so different tempers and dispositions, views and designs exist among their parishioners?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030548_0012_0FE7C56196D69A78"/>
ONE of the most painful trails, which Christ's mini∣sters often meet with, still remains to be mentioned, namely, the little attention paid to their most faithful instructions, by a great proportion of their people, and the small success of their labours, in general. It is hard to say what can be more grievous and disheartening to those who have a proper concern for the prosperity of the Redeemer's kingdom, and the salvation of precious souls. Under this discouragement, respecting the peo∣ple to whom he ministred, the prophet Jeremiah once made this resolution, "I will speak no more to them, in the name of the LORD." This drew very moving com∣plaints from some others of GOD'S antient prophets. "I have laboured in vain, and spent my strength for nought: Israel will not be gathered. Who hath be∣lieved our report?"</P>
<P>W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a minister is diligent in his studies, fervent in his prayers, earnest in his preaching, faithful in giving private counsel, and circumspect in his own conduct, yet then to observe many among his people growing evidently more hardened and fixed in wickedness; many who will not give themselves the trouble of attend∣ing publick worship; many more, who appear quite careless and unconcerned about the welfare of their immortal souls; and some among those who have bound themselves, by publick covenant engagements, to main∣tain a life of strict piety and virtue, yet walking very unsuitably to the profession they have made; what can more deeply and painfully wound him? Yet thus wound∣ed, many times, are CHRIST'S faithful ministers. Their time, their strength, and their lives are wearing away, without the comfort of satisfactory evidences that "their labour is not in vain, in the LORD."</P>
<P>I HAVE been long, perhaps too long, in sketching out the dark side of the picture of a christian minister's situ∣ation. Still nothing has been said but what I believe to be a just representation, and what is often realized, by persons in the sacred office. This may have led many
<PB N="15" REF="030548_0013_0FE7C59C8BD7C0E8"/>
ministers, of the present day, to apply to themselves, the remark which the apostle made, relative to himself, and his brethren in the apostolic office. "If in this life only we have hope, we are of all men most miserable."</P>
<P>BUT is there no bright side to this picture? Is there no counterpart to what hath been described, of a mini∣ster's labours, trials and conflicts? Hath he no pleasures and comforts, while discharging the duties of his sta∣tion? He undoubtedly has, if he is faithful, and some which are exceedingly endearing and supporting. The approbation of his own conscience, and comfortable hopes of the Divine approbation. Sensible aid and assistance in his labours, from the spirit and grace of CHRIST. Delightful contemplations on the truths, and blessings of the gospel, for which his professional busi∣ness gives him great advantages. The friendship, the warm affection, the sincere good wishes, and the fervent prayers, of the most amiable and worthy characters, among his people. Great satisfaction, sometimes, in seeing "the pleasure of the LORD prospering in his hands;" and "souls slocking to CHRIST, as doves to their windows:" And especially the prospect of those gracious rewards, which CHRIST hath promised to his faithful ministers, when they shall have finished their course, and the ministry they have received. "Be ye faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life."</P>
<P>WILL not the faithful labourer, in the vineyard of CHRIST, who keeps the eye of his faith fixed on such gracious promises, be comforted, in all his tribulations? Will he not, like the apostle, though sorrowful, yet be always rejoicing? Yea it may be hoped that in the near views of death, he may be able in a good measure hum∣bly to adopt his joyful and triumphant language. <Q>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my de∣parture is at hand. I have fought a good fight: I have finished my course; I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righ∣teousness, which the LORD, the righteous Judge, shall give me, at that day.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="030548_0014_0FE7C5631F73BA30"/>
WHO could be expected to enter into the sacred em∣ployment, or long to continue in it, if nothing of this sort was to be expected, or found, to ballance the many trials and difficulties which are inseparable from it? More virtue and fortitude, than most men are possessed of, would be requisite to prevent their shrinking from a service, so unpromising, yea so formidable. But our SAVIOUR doth not leave, thus comfortless, his servants, whom He calls into his vineyard. Though the rewards of their diligence and fidelity are principally reserved to the future world, yet for their present support and comfort, He hath made such gracious declarations as the following "Lo I am with you always to the end of the world. My grace is sufficient for you, and my strength is made perfect in your weakness."</P>
<P>WITH an expectation of both these, the trials<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seven members of the church, and three or four others, opposed his settlement. After a little time, he had the satisfaction of numbering them all, among his kind, affectionate, and confi∣dential friends; and such they all continued, to the close of their lives.</NOTE> and the supports, your minister consented to enter into the sacred work, in this place, and was solemnly set apart to it forty years ago, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on the fifth day of February, A.D. 1756. A day, and a transaction much to be remem∣bred; and which he can truly say have hardly been out of his serious recollection, for a week or a day since.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Very frequently hath he recollected the leading sentiments of an excellent discourse delivered by the <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Mr. Appleton, on those words of the apostle, 2 Tim. ii. 15. <HI>Study to shew thyself ap∣proved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</HI> Often hath he recollected the charge by the <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Mr. Townsend of Needham, delivered, at once, with that parental tenderness, and that seriousness and gravity, which were happily united in the temper and conduct of that worthy servant of Christ. Often hath he recollected that profusion of christian friendship, and brotherly love, expressed, in the right hand of fellowship, given by the <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Mr. Balch; all which friendship and brotherly love he continued to exem∣plify, while his valuable life was spared, towards the person then ordained, and towards his brethren, in the gospel mi∣nistry in general.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030548_0015_0FE7C59E1493C6C8"/>
SOON after his entering on the work he was visited with such bodily infirmities, as led him to expect his life and labours would be short; that he should, in a little time, finish his course, and the ministry which he had received. Still, with truth he can say, he did not forget his vows and resolutions, to work while it was day; nor did he feel an unwillingness to spend what little strength he had, in the service of his beloved people. He did "not account his life dear to him," if he might spend it successfully in the great work, on which he had entered. To the honour of GOD, he desires thankfully to mention it, that he was strengthened to go on, in his professional labours, much beyond his expectations, and with no long interruptions, for a number of years. With sentiments of gratitude and affection, he often re∣flects on the kind, candid, and tender manner, in which his people treated him, and with which his feeble endea∣vours to serve them were received. They did not despise either his youth or his infirmities. The abundant marks of their sympathetick tenderness and affection rendered all his labours among them, eminently labours of love, which were their own reward.</P>
<P>AFTER about eighteen years, feebly, yet pleasantly spent, in their service, GOD was pleased to visit him with a threatning fever, which reduced him, in appearence, to the very gates of the grave. The tenderness with which they ministred to him during that sickness, is fresh in his grateful remembrance. Their prayers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A day of fasting and prayer was observed by his people, on his account.</NOTE> which GOD was pleased graciously to answer, called him back to further labours among them. The blessing of Heaven, on the gratuitous, the careful, and judicious prescriptions, and attendance of his skilful and bene∣volent physician,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Doctor John Sprague.</NOTE> recovered him to a better state of health, than he had enjoyed for some time before. With renewed pleasure and resolution he again entered on his publick and private labours, in the gospel. And with renewed marks of respect his people received him.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="030548_0016_0FE7C5690718A680"/>
DURING about seventeen years after this, he was not absent from public worship more than two sabbaths, ex∣cepting the time when he had the small pox, which de∣tained him three. Frequently, however, in that term of seventeen years, has he come into this house of worship, weak and trembling, when it appeared to him hardly possible that, without special help from above, he should go through the services of the day. Strength was, as he desires thankfully to record, from time to time, vouch∣safed to him.</P>
<P>ABOUT five years ago, he was visited with a slow fever, which detained him from the house of GOD, for five sab∣baths. Since that time, he hath, every Lord's day at∣tended the services of the sanctuary. He desired now to set up his EBENEZER, acknowledging that "hitherto the LORD hath helped him." He hath spared, and assisted him, to labour in his vineyard, feeble and imperfect as his labours have been, much longer than any of his pre∣decessors, in this society. His term of service hath been protracted beyond that of most of his brethren, in the ministry.</P>
<P>UPON retrospecting this term of forty years, your minister finds much to lament, much to be humbled for, of his faults, defects, and imperfections. His hope is in the abundant mercy of GOD, and the merit of that blood, which was shed for the priesthood as well as for the congregation; to pardon what has been amiss; and to accept his feeble, though, he hopes, sincere attempts to promote the cause of Christ, and the good of souls. He finds, at the same time, many things which demand his gratitude to his DIVINE MASTER; particularly, that he hath called him to labour in so pleasant a part of his vineyard; that he hath supported and assisted him so long; that he hath rendered his services, in a good degree ac∣ceptable to his people; and that they have not, as he would humbly hope, been wholly useless and unsuccess∣ful; though it is a painful consideration, that the evi∣dences of their success have been so few. It is matter
<PB N="19" REF="030548_0017_0FE7C5A3F5677E58"/>
of pleasing and grateful reflection, that friendship and harmony among the people of his charge, and between him and them, have so generally prevailed. He fer∣vently prays, that "brotherly love may continue." He rejoices with his flock that they have been, and now are, so free from those religious disputes, and contentions, which prevail in some societies; occasioned by different and militating sentiments, and by the prevalence of va∣rious sects and denominations of christians.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is not, in the first precinct in Dedham a family of professed Baptists, Quakers, Methodists, or Universalists, known to the writer of this discourse.</P><P>There are now, and have been for more than half a century past, a few families of the episcopal denomination.

<P>MANY events, in this society have taken place within the term of forty years past. The inhabitants of the precinct, and the members of the church, are, in a great measure, changed. But 5 males, and 10 females, who were, so long ago, members of the church, continue alive among us. The church then consisted of 55 male members, and 87 females, resident, in the parish. It now consists of 42 males, and 99 females. The whole number is 1 less now than it was then. The dispro∣portion between males and females is increased. The number of the former is 13 less, and of the latter, 12 more.</P>
<P>THE number of persons admitted, who were not in communion with any church before, is 296, 7 have been received by recommendation from other churches. 32 have been dismissed from this to other churches. The number of children which have been baptized, with us, in the above mentioned period, is 904. 10 adult persons have been admitted to the ordinance of baptism.</P>
<P>THE number of couples, who have been joined in marriage, by your pastor, one or both of which belonged to this town, is 279. A few have been married by ma∣gistrates, in the town.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="030548_0018_0FE7C56A9333CD50"/>
THE number of deaths in this society, within the term of 40 years past, according to the most authentick re∣cords, is 529. I have formerly mentioned, that the yearly average number of deaths was between 9 and 10. It was so during the first 19 years of my ministry. In the last 21 years, in which the small pox hath several times, prevailed among us; the dysentry, and some other epidemick distempers, the average number has been considerably greater.</P>
<P>OF the 529 persons who have died, 9 have arrived to the age of 90 years, or upwards, which is nearly in the proportion of 1 to 60. 42 have lived to be 80 years old and upwards, besides the 9 who survived 90 years. This shews about 1 in 12 to arrive to the age of 80 years.</P>
<P>74 persons have died between 70 and 80 years of age, which, in connection with the calculations above, shews that as great a proportion as 1 in 5, of those who have died, in the term aforesaid, have lived to see threescore years and ten, or more. I cannot ascertain the number of births in this society, during the term of 40 years past. It may be about 1100.</P>
<P>THE above calculations shew, that a greater propor∣tion of persons, among us, than has been generally sup∣posed, has lived to what we may call old age. If a re∣gular, sober, and virtuous mode of living may be assign∣ed, as the natural cause, it reflects honour on the society. A presumptive argument is hereby suggested, in favour of the situation, air and climate, as being friendly to health, and long life. We are bound however ultimate∣ly to ascribe it, to his kind providence, who is the "GOD of our life and the length of our days."</P>
<P>THE number of females, who have lived to old age, is a little larger than that of males. There is not one man, now in the society, quite 80 years old. There is one woman, in her 94th year; and several between 80 and 90 years old. There are 11 women, and 7 men, whose age is between 70 and 80 years, there are 7 men and 34 women in a state of widowhood.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="030548_0019_0FE7C5A5856082B8"/>
THE deaths, in the society, have mostly taken place by the common laws of mortality, or have been what we call <HI>natural deaths.</HI> None in the way of murther, or by the magistrate, "holding the sword, as a terror to evil doers." The lives of several have been brought to an end, in the way of drowning, and by some other melan∣cholly accidents. Two only have been lost at sea.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William Ames, and William Avery, jun.</NOTE> A small number have died in the army either by sword or sickness.</P>
<P>THE three worthy persons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deacons Joseph Wight, Ephraim Willson, and Nathaniel Kings∣bury. The first of these died July 14th 1756, in the 75th year of his age, and 27th of his office. The second died July 19th 1769, in the 86th year of his age, and 34th of his office. The third died August 20th 1775, in the 78th year of his age, and 29th of his deaconship.</NOTE> who sustained the office of deacons, when your present pastor entered on his la∣bours among you, all lived to a good old age; but have, for many years, been numbered among the dead. Two others,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Deacon William Avery, now in the 80th year of his age, and 37th of his office. Deacon Ebenezer Richards, in the 78th year of his age, and 27th of his office.</NOTE> chosen into that office, within 40 years past, after faithfully discharging the duties of it, for a length of time, are now by bodily infirmities, rendered unable to attend to them. We pray GOD to brighten the evening of their day, by the consolations of that religion which they have long professed, and endeavoured to promote. Our brethren,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Deacons Joseph Whiting, Aaron Fuller, and Isaac Bullard.</NOTE> who now perform the benevolent ser∣vices of that office, we wish may long continue to per∣form them, to their own reputation, and to the satis∣faction of the church.</P>
<P>VERY precious to you, no doubt, is the memory of many in the catalogue of more than five hundred persons, deceased from among you, within 40 years past. Their memory is dear to your pastor. In the number were included all the men, except 5 or 6, who invited him into the office, which he now sustains
<PB N="22" REF="030548_0020_0FE7C56FE80E2A68"/>
among you. Not a few of them were his intimate and confidential friends, whom he often met, with great delight, in the house of GOD, and at the table of CHRIST, mingling hearts and affections, in the exercises of piety and devotion. The proofs of their sincere regard to him were so strong, and so multiplied, as to preclude all doubt of it. And he sometimes entertains the pleasing hope, that he may have been the feeble unworthy instru∣ment of good to their souls, in helping them forward to the heavenly world.</P>
<P>IF the names of those who have died, from among us, within the term often mentioned above, should be called over, most of us should hear some which designated our nearest and dearest connexions. Tender parents; be∣loved partners in life; dear children; affectionate bre∣thren and sisters. Calling them to mind may afford a melancholly kind of pleasure. A care to be followers of them, so far as they were of CHRIST, excited and strengthened, will be essentially beneficial to us. We cannot see them again, in the flesh, "till the heavens be no more." How happy if we may then meet them, at the right hand of CHRIST, to unite, in tracing the mysterious steps of Divine providence; and in cele∣brating the wonders of redeeming love! Soon our bodies, like their's, will be laid in the grave, and be mouldering in the dust. A successor to your present pastor, may perhaps, half a century hence, make re∣marks on our deaths, memory, and character, as we do now, on those of our friends, who are gone before us. It is earnestly to be wished, that these commemorative anecdotes, may not only afford transient amusement, but useful instruction, respecting the passing nature of time; the shortness of human life; and the importance of im∣proving well every day as it passes.</P>
<P>THIS particular society in which we dwell, is not ex∣clusively the school, in which we may receive instruction of this serious and universally interesting kind. In neighbouring churches and societies, particularly in

those which originated from this,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At the beginning of the term which this discourse reviews, <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Jonathan Townsend was pastor of the church in Medfield. He was dismissed from his office, October 9th 1769. <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Thomas Prentiss was inducted into the pastoral office in that town, October 31st 1770; and continues to minister to that people in holy things. A small baptist society has, for a number of years, existed in that town. The late <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Thomas Gair, was for several years the pastor. Since his removal, a Mr. Clarke resides there, and frequently preaches to them.</P><P>IN Wrentham, <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Joseph Bean was minister. On the 12th of December 1784, his life, and his very faithful labours were ter∣minated, in the 66th year of his age, and 34th of his ministry. <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> David Avery was installed his successor, May 25, 1786, and his dismission voted by the town, agreeably to advice of council, April 21, 1794. It is painful to add, that that church and town, which for more than a century enjoyed great peace, harmony, and prosperity, are now in a very unhappy, divided, broken state. May they be led to know and pursue the things which are promotive of peace, and christian edification! A small baptist society is in the westerly part of that town. A <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Mr. Williams is their minister.</P><P>THE 2d parish in Wrentham continued vacant, after the death of <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Elias Haven, till June 4th 1760, when the <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Caleb Bar∣num was ordained their pastor. He obtained a dismission from the pastoral office after about 9 years service among them, and was, soon after, installed pastor of the church in Taunton. He went chaplain into the western army, in 1776, and died abroad. The <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Nathaniel Emmons was ordained his successor, in Wrentham, April 21. 1773, and continues the beloved pastor of that flock. This 2d parish in Wrentham was, in the year 1778, made a town, by an act of incorporation, and the name <HI>Franklin</HI> given to it.</P><P>IN Needham, the <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Mr. Townsend continued his faithful labours till September 30th 1762, when his Lord called him away by death, in the 65th year of his age, and 43d of his ministry. <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Samuel West was ordained his successor, April 25th, 1764. He left Needham in November 1788; and was soon installed pastor of a church in Boston, where he now officiates. The <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Stephen Palmer was ordained to the pastoral office, in Needham, November 7. 1792, and there continues his ministra∣tions. A number of the inhabitants of Needham got incorpor∣ated into a distinct precinct, about the year 1773. They were led to seek this, on account of some disagreement in the town, respecting the place of building a meeting house. This 2d pre∣cinct has not yet settled a minister.</P><P>IN Walpole, their first minister, <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Phillips Payson, died Janu∣ary 22d 1778, in the 74th year of his age, and 50th of his mi∣nistry. The <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> George Morey, his successor, was ordained Nov. 19th 1783, and continues the guide and overseer of that people.</P><P>IN the second parish in Dedham, the <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Thomas Balch conti∣nued his acceptable labours till January 8th 1774, when he was removed by death, in the 63d year of his age, and 38th of his ministry, and was succeeded in office, by <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Jabez Chickering, the present pastor, who was ordained July 3d 1776.</P><P>IN the 3d parish in Dedham, of which the <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Andrew Tyler was pastor, some unhappy dissentions took place, about the year 1764. Attempts to restore peace and harmony not succeeding, Mr. Tyler was dismissed from office, about the close of the year 1772. He died in Boston in 1775. The <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Thomas Thacher was ordained his successor, June 7th 1780.</P><P>THE 4th parish in Dedham had the <ABBR>rev.</ABBR> Benjamin Caryl set over them in the Lord, as their first pastor, Nov. 10th 1762. He still labours among them in word and doctrine. That parish was incorporated, as a <HI>district,</HI> by the general court, July 7th 1784, and had the name <HI>Dover</HI> given to it.</P></NOTE> providence teaches the same things, by similar changes and events. "He

that is wise will observe these things." And if we ex∣tend our view to a larger circle, to mark the footsteps of divine providence, in the vicissitudes which have taken place, within no very long period of past time, more useful information will arise to our minds. With∣in the easy recollection of many of us, the grand Ame∣rican revolution hath been brought about, which has given our country a station among the sovereign and independent nations of the earth. This forms an im∣portant aera, and hath given, or confirmed to us, civil and religious privileges, equal, perhaps superior, to those enjoyed in any part of the world; especially taken in connexion with those wise constitutions of govern∣ment, which have been formed, in our country, and carried into operation, during, and since the revolution. The faithful page of history, it is hoped, will convey the knowledge of these great events to the latest generations.</P>
<P>Do not the private events which relate more imme∣diately to this society bear evident signatures of a kind providence, rendering it's condition prosperous? "In∣stead of the fathers are the children." Many repsect∣able
<PB N="25" REF="030548_0023_0FE7C5AD184DD8F8"/>
persons have finished their course. Many respect∣able ones have risen up in their stead. The number of births hath been more than double the number of deaths.</P>
<P>THE education of youth has had some share of atten∣tion paid to it; and a conviction of it's importance appears to be increasing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A gentleman of respectable learning and abilities, Ebenezer Wight, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> hath opened an academy, in the parish, and hath devoted his time to the instruction of youths, of both sexes, in various branches of science.

<P>MANY improvements have been made in the society, tending to convenience and ornament. This decent house<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">THE first meeting-house, tradition says, was built 1638, where the present house stands. The people assembled in it for religious worship about <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4 years. Iu the year 1672 they took it down, and erected another, in the same place, the first being too small to accommodate them. The second, which many of you remember, stood 90 years. In the year 1762 it was taken down, and this, in which we now assemble, was erected, in the same place. The spot fixed upon, by the proprietors, for the first, seems, by general consent, to have been deemed the most suitable, ever since. Soon after the present meeting-house was finished, the handsome clock now in it, was given to the parish, by Samuel Dexter, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> In the year 1775, Mr. Joshua Bracket, late of Boston, deceased, gave to the society, the christening bason, now in use, and the frame in which it stands. The aged and venerable Madam Catharina Barnard (formerly Dexter) March 16, 1789, presented to the society a large folio Bible, desiring a portion of it might be read, in public, on Lord's days. Her donation was greatfully re∣ceived, and her desire complied with.</NOTE> for public worship hath been erected. More

than half the dwelling houses in the parish have been built, aud most of the others repaired and enlarged. Few (I think but seven) have been consumed by fire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE houses burned belonged to the following persons, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Dr. John Sprague, Robert Smith and his son, Joseph Wight and his son, John Eaton, Israel Everett jun. Job Richards, and Isaac Eaton.</NOTE> Some branches of manufactures have been introduced. Others have been extended and enlarged. There hath been an augmentation of property, in the church, and society. The cultivation of the soil hath been carried to greater perfection. The number and commodious∣ness of buildings have been increased. A church fund<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">THE history of the origin and progress of the church's property, is to be found, partly in the records of the church, and partly in those of the original proprietors of those lands which constituted what was, at first, the town of Dedham. It is well understood that the fund, which the church now possesses, proceeded from the sale of a number of lots of land, which belonged to it. This sale was made more than 30 years ago. The money produced by it was let out upon interest. The interest, for a succession of years, was added to the principal. The annual interest now amounts to about 267 dollars, or 80 pounds. It is applied towards the support of the minister. It renders the burden of maintaining public worship light.</NOTE> hath been established, and become considerable. This society is become the seat of the public business of a new formed country.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">THE county of Norfolk was formed out of the county of Suffolk, by an act of the general court, passed March 26th 1793.

The public county build∣ings were not compleated, till a year or two after the in∣corporating act was passed.</NOTE> Hereby it's figure and respecta∣bility are advanced.</P>
<P>AND to it's honour, it may be mentioned, that a spirit of candor and accommodation hath generally marked it's proceedings, to the maintaining peace and harmo∣ny. This was the case in building this house for
<PB N="27" REF="030548_0025_0FE75B1D68430D0"/>
public worship; and in settling the feats, apartments and conveniences to be enjoyed in it. This was the case when a change of the version of the psalms,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ABOUT 35 years ago the society, with very little opposition, ex∣changed, what was generally called, the <HI>New-England</HI> psalms, for the version of Tate and Brady, and a collection of Dr. Watts's hymns bound with it. About three years ago, without any opposition, they introduced Dr. Watts's version of the psalms, and his hymns, in the room of Tate and Brady's.</NOTE> to be used in public worship, was repeatedly made. And this hath been the case in regulating that agreeable part of religious service, singing the praises of GOD in his house.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Much commendation and thanks are due to those who lead in that part of worship, for the judicious and pleasing manner in which the service is performed.</NOTE> And, this also hath been the case when altera∣tions were, more than once, proposed, and agreed to, as to terms and modes,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>March 7th 1742, the church voted not to insist on persons offering relations, as a term of admission into fellowship with them; and at the same time introduced a confession of faith, to be publickly assented to, by each person, when admitted, who did not offer a relation. This confession of faith, though excellent in general, was long, and contained some religious tenets, concerning which many pious persons have their doubts and difficulties. About the year 1767, it was suggested to the church, that something more concise, and expressed in more general terms, might better answer the purpose. A substitute of that kind was proposed, and peaceably adopted.</P><P>At a meeting of the church, April 11th 1793, it was suggested, whether it might not be adviseable to make some alterations in the modes and forms of admitting persons into communion. A committee was chosen to consider the matter and report, what they think proper to be done. The committee, at an ad∣journment of the meeting, reported a general form of christian union, and covenant engagements, in which all persons admitted are to agree. This was adopted without opposition. The said committee also reported the following method of admit∣ting persons, as, in their opinion, proper and adviseable, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>That a person, desiring admission, shall apply to the minister, and make his desire known; that the minister shall mention this, in public; and if no valid objection is offered against the person, within a fortnight, the name of the person shall be inserted in the church covenant, before-mentioned. And when the minister hath notified the church, that this has been done, such person shall be considered as a member of the church, and be treated as such.</Q> This report was accepted by the church, the following clause being added, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Provided however, that if any person shall chuse rather to be admitted into the church, in either of the methods which have been heretofore used, they shall readily be allowed their choice.</Q></P></NOTE> of admitting persons to church fellowship, and christian privileges. Few disputes and controversies have prevailed in the church or society. If the members have not always been <Q>perfectly joined to∣gether in the same mind, and in the same judgment,</Q>
<PB N="28" REF="030548_0026_0FE7C578B6866F60"/>
yet a disposition has prevailed, to permit every one freely to enjoy the right of his private opinion, provided he doth not break in upon the rights of others. This spi∣rit of candor and mutual forbearance has happily tended to the peace of the community. GOD grant it may abound among us, more and more.</P>
<P>BUT whether the scenes through which we pass, or the events upon which we are remarking, be pleasing or painful; one thing is certain; we shall be here but a little while, to observe them. The fashion of the world changes, and passes away, and we are changing, and passing away with it.</P>
<P>YOUR pastor need not tell you that he is in the decline of life. Evidences of it cannot escape his and your observation. He desires to adore that kind providence, which has sustained him so long. And he takes this op∣portunity to express sentiments of gratitude to his be∣loved people, for the candor and friendship with which they have generally treated him. He wishes never to forget the many, many expressions of their kindness and affection. Unkindnesses, and injuries he desires to re∣member none. He wishes to be instrumental of pro∣moting their best interest, during the short remaining period, GOD may continue him in the ministry. He earnestly requests their prayers that he may be so. He has no ground to calculate upon a long continuance. He can expect no other, than e'er long to be laid by, as a broken, or worn out vessel. But while any consider∣able
<PB N="29" REF="030548_0027_0FE7C5B3E51266F8"/>
degree of bodily strength, and powers of mind, is continued to him, he hopes not to be a mere cumberer of the ground, or burden to society. To survive all capa∣city of usefulness, appears to him an event, by no means to be desired.</P>
<P>THOUGH he sincerely wishes that his private inter∣course among his people may be agreeable to them, and minister to their profit; yet probably his occasional visits may not, in frequency, come up to their expecta∣tions, or his own inclination. Should this be the case, their candor, and good sense will furnish sufficient apo∣logies. They will do him the justice, to acknowledge, that he hath not been a stranger, in their families, in times of sickness and trouble. As he hath taken a tender and sympathetick part, in their afflictions, it is his desire to do so still, to the extent of his strength and abilities.</P>
<P>HE feels great solicitude for the utility and success of his publick <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ours and instructions. The small capa∣city he has, as a publick religious teacher, he desires di∣ligently and faithfully to improve. Still it lies very much with his hearers to determine, whether these en∣deavours shall be beneficial to them or not. Without a stated, serious, and prayerful attention, on their part, what profit can they expect to receive? He earnestly intreats them not refuse such an attention.</P>
<P>THE remarks which have been made, at this time, he hopes will be received with the same candor and friend∣ship, with which they have been prepared, and deliver∣ed. For a publick speaker to say so much concerning himself, may be deemed rather indelicate. The subject and the occasion are his apology. He hath not been wont to trespass in this way. And this probably may be the last time, that any thing of this sort, will be de∣livered by him, in this place. Possibly some of the his∣torical anecdotes, in the foregoing pages, may be thought too small and trifling to have a place there. It was the desire of the writer not to offend in this way. Little incidents generally interest the feelings of persons im∣mediately concerned in them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="030548_0028_0FE7C57E0CDA2558"/>
To conclude,</P>
<P>THE pastor of this flock considers his time, all his little strength, whether of body or mind, and even his life, devoted to the honour of CHRIST, and the promo∣tion of their spiritual good; and thinks he can sincerely adopt the language of the apostle, and say, that he "doth not account his life dear to him," if it may be thus faith∣fully, and usefully spent; and "his course, and ministry finished with joy."</P>
<P>THE law of mortality, if nothing else, must e'er long, dissolve the relation of pastor and flock, which has now subsisted between him and them, through the term of forty years. GOD grant that he and they may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dis∣charge the respective duties of the relation, as shall promote the joy and felicity of both, in the coming world.</P>
