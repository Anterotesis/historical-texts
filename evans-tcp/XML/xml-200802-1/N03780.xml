Provision from the Trustees, yet treated in a Manner unbecoming even Heathens. Was all the Money I have collected, to be spent in freeing these Three Children from Slavery, it would be well laid out. I have also in my House near Twenty more, who, in all Probability, if not ta∣ken in, would be as Ignorant of <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>CHRIST,</HI> comparatively speaking, as the <HI>Indians. Blessed be</HI> GOD, <HI>they begin to live in Order.</HI>.</P>
<P>This Day I began the Cotton Manu∣factury; and agreed with a Woman to teach the litle Ones to spin and card. I find annual Cotton grows indifferently well in <HI>Georgia</HI>: And, to encourage the People, I this Day bought 305 <HI>lb.</HI> and have agreed to take all the Cotton, Hemp and Flax that shall be planted the follow∣ing Year, through the whole Province. I see more and more the Excellency of the Charity in which I am engaged. I trust it will make <HI>Savannah</HI> lift up her drooping Head. Tho' there are fewer Inhabitants, yet, I think the People are in a better Situation than when I was here last. They now live independant on a Publick Store, Provisions (Flour especial∣ly) are much cheaper; Cattle more plen∣tiful; and by the Divine Blessing, if any Manufacture can be raised amongst them∣selves,
<PB N="6" REF="004636_0005_100DB4DA25D52E40"/>
to prevent their exporting so much Money, they may yet do well. I bless GOD! My Congregations are as large as usual. The Court-House is generally full, and I keep as near as may be to my old Way of Proceeding. We have the Sacrament every Sunday, and publick Prayer and Exposition twice every Day in the Week. <HI>The LORD bless my Com∣ing, and grant the Inhabitants may know the Things which belong to their Peace, be∣fore they are eternally hid from their Eyes!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, January</HI> 30. Went to Day with the Carpenter and Surveyor, and laid out the Ground whereon the Orphan-House is to be built. It is to be sixty feet long, and forty wide: A Yard and Garden before and behind: The Foundation is to be Brick, and is to be sunk four Feet with∣in, and raised three Feet above the Ground, which is intended for a Cellar and other convenient Places. The House is to be two Story, with a Hip-Roof, the First ten the Second nine Foot high. In all there will be near twenty commodious Rooms. Behind are two small Houses, the one for an Infirmary, the other for a Charity-School for the poor Children of the Town that are not Orphans; for I intend to take in some of them, as my Stock will admit. There is also to be a Still-House
<PB N="7" REF="004636_0006_100DB4DBCD88B8C0"/>
built for the Apothecary. — And I trust, 'ere my return to <HI>England,</HI> I shall see my Chil∣dren and Family quite settled in it. I find it will be an expensive Work: But it is for the LORD CHRIST; He will take care to defray all Charges.— The Money that will be spent on this Occasion, will keep many Families from leaving the Colony; and in all Probability bring many others over.— There are near thirty working at the Plantation already, and I would employ as many more, if they could be got.— Whatsoever is done for GOD ought to be done speedily, as well as with all our Might.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Feb,</HI> 4. Met according to Appointment with all the Magistrates, and former Trustee of the Orphans, who heard the Recorder read over the Grant given me by the Trustees, and took a Minute of their Approbation of the same, <HI>LORD grant I may carefully watch over every Soul that is, or shall be committed to my Charge!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Feb.</HI> 11. Had much of the Divine Presence yesterday, both at Morn∣ing and Evening Service. Took in four fresh Orphans; and sat out with two Friends to <HI>Frederica,</HI> in order to pay my Respects to the General, and to fetch the Orphans that were in the Southern Part of the Colony, <HI>LORD preserve my going

At Night we returned to <HI>Providence.</HI> About eight o'Clock, the Scout Boat came; but it being late, we chose to defer going till the next Morning: In the mean while GOD was pleased to give us refreshing Sleep, and to fill my Soul (after it had been much cast down) with unspeakable Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost. <HI>Oh that I was careful always to behave so as not to provoke that blessed Guest to depart from me!

<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 17. Found my self better in Body, tho' somewhat weak. Preached in the Morning, in a Room belonging to the Store-House. GOD was pleased to give me much Freedom, and the People seem'd very attentive—Dined with the General. Intended to go to St. <HI>Simons</HI> to the Soldiery; but it being too late to go there and preach, I thought it adviseable to preach a second Time at <HI>Frederica.</HI> The General, Soldiers and People attended very orderly. After Sermon, I married a Couple, bapti∣zed a Child, and spent the Remainder of the Evening with my two Friends. <HI>Oh what a happy Thing is it for Brethren to dwell together in Unity!</HI></P>

Spent a good Part of the Day with the General: Received from him a Bill of Exchange for <HI>One Hundred and Fifty Pounds,</HI> which he has advanced me in order to begin a Church at <HI>Savannah.</HI>—About seven o'Clock sat off for the <HI>Darien,</HI> whither I promised to return to take Mr. <HI>Mc' Leod,</HI> and the Or∣phans, with me to <HI>Savannah.</HI>—The Passage to that Place is generally about four Hours; but the Wind being high and contrary, we were obliged to come to a Grapling near an open Reach, and did not get to <HI>Darien</HI> till the next Day at Noon. Mr. <HI>Mc'Leod,</HI> and his Friends, received us with Joy; and finding me ill, advised me to lie down, by which I was much refreshed, and was thereby enabled at Night to give GOD Thanks in Family Prayer. <HI>Oh who can express the loving Kindness of the LORD, or shew forth all his Praise!</HI></P>

met with a cool Reception. After I had been there a little while, I told him, That I was inform'd, he had some Questions to propose to me, and that I was now come to give him all the Satisfaction I could in answering them. Upon this I immedi∣ately perceived Passion begin to arise in his Heart,—
<Q>Yes Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> I have several Questions to put to you, but, <HI>added he,</HI> you are got above us,</Q>
or something to that Purpose. Then he charged me with <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> and Pride, for speaking against the Generality of the Clergy, and desired I would make my Charge good. I told him, I thought I had already; but, as yet, I had scarce begun with them. He then asked me, Wherein were the Clergy so much to blame? I answered, they did not preach up <HI>Justifi∣cation by Faith alone</HI>: And, upon talking with the Commissary, I found he was as ignorant of it as any of the rest. He then sneered me, with telling me of my Mo∣desty, expressed in my Letter to the Bi∣shop of <HI>Gloucester.</HI> He charged me with breaking the Canons and my Ordination Vow: And notwithstanding I told him I was ordained by Letters Dimissory from the Bishop of <HI>London</HI>; yet in a great Rage he told me, if I preached in any publick Church in that Province, he would sus∣pend
<PB N="16" REF="004636_0015_100DB4F2519C9738"/>
me. I replied, I shall regard that as much as I would a Pope's Bull. But, Sir, says I, why should you be offended at my speaking against the Generality of the Clergy, for I always spoke worthily of you?—I might as well be offended, ad∣ded my Brother, at your saying, the Ge∣nerality of People were notorious Sinners, and might come to accuse you, for speak∣ing Evil of me, because I was one of the People. I further added, Sir, you did not behave thus, when I was with you last. No, says he, you did not speak against the Clergy; or some such Thing. Because, replied I, more Light has been given me since that time: But if you will make an Application to yourself, be pleased, Sir, to let me ask you one Question.
<Q>Have you delivered your Soul, by exclaiming against the Assemblies and Balls here? What, Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> must you come to catechise me? No, <HI>says he,</HI> I have not exclaim'd against them; I think there is no Harm in them. Then, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> I shall think it my Duty to ex∣claim against you. Then, Sir, <HI>re∣plied he, (in a very great Rage)</HI> get you out of my House.</Q>
Upon which I made my Bow, and, with my Friends, took my Leave, pitying the Commissary, who I really tho't was more noble than to
<PB N="17" REF="004636_0016_100DB4F4A7D2AFD8"/>
give such Treatment. After this, we went to publick Prayer, dined at a Friend's House, drank Tea with the <HI>Inde∣pendent</HI> Minister, and preached about 4 in the Afternoon, to a large Auditory in his Meeing-House. GOD was pleased to favour us with his Presence, during Sermon; and I spent the remainder of the Evening with my dear Brother and Com∣panions, <HI>Who I trust will be all knit in one Communion and Fellowship, by Faith in a crucified</HI> GOD. <HI>Amen,</HI> So be it.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 15. Breakfasted, sung a Hymn, and had some religious Conver∣sation on board my Brother's Ship. Preached in the <HI>Baptist</HI> Meeting-House, and was much pleased, when I heard af∣terwards, that from the same Pulpit, a Person not long ago, had preached, who denied the Doctrine of Original Sin, the Divinity and Righteousness of our dear LORD, and the Operations of GOD's blessed Spirit upon the Heart. I was led out to shew the utter Inability of Man to save himself, and the absolute Necessity of his depending on the rich and sovereign Grace of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, in order to be restored to his primitive Dig∣nity. Some, I observ'd, were put under Concern, and most seem'd willing to know, whether those Things were so. In
<PB N="18" REF="004636_0017_100DB4F7AA84C7E8"/>
the Evening I preach'd again, in the <HI>In∣dependant</HI> Meeting-House, to a more at∣tentive Auditory than ever: And had the Pleasure afterwards of Finding, that a Gen∣tlewoman, whose whole Family has been carried away for some time with Deisti∣cal Principles, began now to be unhinged, and to see that there was no Rest in such a Scheme, for a fallen Creature to rely on. LORD JESUS, <HI>for thy Mercy's Sake, reveal thyself in her Heart, and make her willing to know the Truth as it is in thee!</HI> Amen, <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 16. Preached at Eight in the Morning at the <HI>Scotch</HI> Meeting-House, to a large Congregation; visited a sick Person; went to Church; heard the Commissary represent me under the Character of the <HI>Pharisee</HI> ,who came to the Temple, saying, <HI>GOD, I thank thee that I am not as other Men are.</HI> But whether I do what I do out of a Principle of Pride, or Duty, the Searcher of Hearts will dis∣cover 'ere long, before Men and Angels. Found myself very sick and weak at Dinner; went to Church again, and preach'd about Five, in the <HI>Independant</HI> Meeting-House Yard, the House itself not being near capacious enough to hold the Auditory.</P>

<L>With restless and ungovern'd Rage,</L>

<P><HI>Thursday, March</HI> 27, 1740. Went this Day to <HI>Bethesda</HI>; and with fall Assurance of Faith, laid the first Brick of the great House. The Workmen attended, and with me kneeled down and prayed: Af∣terward we sung an Hymn suitable to the Occasion; and then I gave a Word of Exhortation to the Labourers, and bid them remember to work heartily, know∣ing that they work'd for GOD and not for Man. Much Satisfaction seem'd to be amongst them, and <HI>blessed be GOD's holy Name,</HI> his Work prospers much in our Hands. Near Twenty Acres of Land are clear'd, and almost ready for planting. Two Houses are already raised, and one near upon being finished. All the Timber for the Frame of the great House is sawn, and most of it brought to the Place where it is to be built. A good Part of the Foundation is dug, and many Thousands of Brick ready for Use. Near Forty Children are now under my Care, and near an Hundred Mouths are daily supplied with Food from our Store. The Expence is great, but our great and good GOD, I am persuaded, will enable me to defray it. As yet I am kept from the

And tho', what has been hi∣therto done, comparatively speaking, may be only as a Grain of Mustard-Seed; yet I believe it will, in GOD's due Time, take Root and fill the Land; and many poor distressed Souls will come and lodge under the Branches of it. <HI>Set thy Al∣mighty</HI> Fiat <HI>to it, O gracious Father! and for thy own Name Sake, let the unbelieving World know, that thou never will forget those that put their Trust in thee.</HI></P>

One Woman that had been a constant Attender on the Means of Grace, and thought herself a Christian for many Years, came to me, acknowledging, that she had been a Self-Deceiver, and knew Nothing of the Righ∣teousness of, or true Living Faith in JESUS CHRIST. A Tradesman of the same Stamp, having; felt the Power of the same Doctrines of Grace, sent me Seven∣teen Volumes of Archbishop <HI>Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lotson's</HI> Sermons, of which he had been a great Admirer, to do what I would with them. A Captain of a Ship, who had been a strong Opposer of the Truth, both wrote and came to me under great Convictions, confessing his Sin, and desirous to be a Christian indeed. Some also there are who have received the Love of GOD in the Truth of it, so that I hope, if Ten Saints could preserve <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom,</HI> the few Righ∣teous Souls left behind, will prevent the utter Desolation of declining <HI>Savannah.

Towards the Conclusion of my Discourse, I read to

I believe God is preparing him for great Services, and I hope he will also be a Means of awaken∣ing some false dead-hearted Preachers a∣mong the Dissenters, who hold the Form of sound Words, but never felt the Power of them in their own Souls. I observed a great Presence of God in our Assembly, and the Word, as I was in∣formed afterwards, came with a Soul∣convicting and comforting Power to ma∣ny. When I had done, I took a little Refreshment, baptized a Child, and hasted to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where I preach'd to up∣wards of Ten Thousand People, upon the Woman that was cured of her bloody Issue.

many fundamental Errors contained in the Commissary's Discourse; for he all a∣long took Faith to be only an Assent to the Truths of the Gospel. He said St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>James</HI> spoke of the same Kind of <HI>Justification</HI>; that <HI>Works</HI> menti∣oned by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> were only the Works of the ceremonial Law; that the Doc∣trine of an <HI>imputed Righteousness</HI> had done much Harm, and hindred the Conversion of the Heathens; that we were to be justified by our Works at the last Day, and consequently were to be justified in the same Manner now.

Here GOD much strengthened and quickened me. The <HI>German</HI> Brethren were exceeding loving to me, and I spent the Evening with many of them, in a most agreeable Manner. The Order, Seriousness and Devotion of of these People in Common Life, is most worthy of Imitation. I never saw so much Simplicity as in them: Surely GOD was with us this Night. They prayed and sung; in their own Language; and then GOD enlarged my Heart to pray in ours. I know not when I have prayed with much greater Power. Many Tears trickled down my Face; and afterwards I was in a great Agony in the Field. <HI>Do thou, O blessed JESUS, who wast in an A∣gony in the Garden, hearken unto the Peti∣tions thou didst in that Hour enable me to send up!</HI></P>

In my Way thither, the LORD was pleased to bring me low, by inward Trials and very great Weakness of Body, occasioned by the Heat of the Sun, Want of Sleep, and the Length of the Journey: —But before I had preached Six Minutes, bodily and spiritual Strength was given me; and the LORD was pleased to set his Seal to what he enabled me to deliver. After Sermon, a Friend took me in his Chair. An old Christian invited me and my Company to his House, Five Miles Distant from the Place where I preached. We were comfortably refreshed under his Roof: And tho' my Body was weak, yet my Soul was strong in the LORD, and in the Power of his Might.

and whom GOD made me an Instrument in converting, in my last Passage to <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> Hitherto he has had the Command of our Sloop; but being obliged to send him on Business to <HI>England,</HI> I have committed the Care of it to his Mate, whom GOD was pleased to bring Home to himself, when I was last at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> This Mate, not long since, was an abandoned Prodigal and Ring-Leader in Vice: —But GOD struck him to the Heart last Fall at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> Capt. <HI>Gladman</HI> had pray'd, that GOD would send him a Mate. This young Man was strongly drawn to come and offer himself. The Captain hired him, and now I believe he is a Child of GOD. Numbers at <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI> cannot but see the New-Crea∣ture in him: And, yet the Doctrine of <HI>Free Justification by Faith in</HI> CHRIST JESUS does Harm to the Christian World! <HI>Surely such Talkers plainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that they never know what it was to believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST with their whole Heart!</HI></P>

I preached in the Meeting-House, as when I was there last: It was full, and was supposed to contain Two Thousand People; near Ten Dis∣senting Ministers were present; and Two Church Ministers, but they did not tarry very long. GOD gave me much Free∣dom of Speech. I dealt very plainly with the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Clergy, many of whom, I believe, preach the Doctrines of <HI>Grace</HI> to others, without being converted them∣selves. No Doubt, some were offended; but I care not for any Set or Party of Men.

But I have been apt to build on my Frames, and think I do no good, or do not please GOD, only because I have not pleased myself.

<P><HI>Thursday, May</HI> 8. Had what my Body much wanted, a thorough Night's Repose. Was much refreshed in Spirit, and was called up very early in the Morning, as I am always, to speak to poor Souls under Convictions. The first I think was an <HI>Indian Trader,</HI> whom GOD was pleased
<PB N="59" REF="004636_0058_100DB5649475CEE8"/>
to bring home by my Preaching, when here last. The Account he gave of GOD's dealing with him, was very satis∣factory. He is just come from the <HI>Indian</HI> Natives, where he has been praying with and exhorting all he met with, that were willing to hear. Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> he had Hopes of, but his Brother Traders en∣deavoured to prejudice them against him: However, by my Advice, he proposes vi∣siting them again next Fall; and I hum∣bly hope the LORD will open a Door a∣mongst the poor Heathen. The Con∣version of one of their Traders, I take to be one great Step towards it. <HI>LORD carry on the Work begun; fulfil thy ancient Promises, and let thy Son have the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utmost Parts of the Earth for his Possession. Come,</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>come quickly.</HI></P>
<P>Conversed also with a poor Negro Wo∣man, who has been visited in a very re∣markable Manner. GOD was pleased to convert her by my Preaching the last Fall; But being under Dejections on Sunday-Morning, she prayed that Salva∣tion might come to her Heart, and that the LORD would be pleased to manifest himself to her Soul that Day. While she was at Meeting, hearing one Mr. <HI>M—n,</HI> a <HI>Baptist</HI> Preacher, whom the LORD has
<PB N="60" REF="004636_0059_100DB5666D93E478"/>
been pleased lately to send forth, the Word came with such Power upon her Heart, that at last she was obliged to cry out; and a great Concern also fell upon many in the Congregation, so that they betook themselves to secret Prayer. The Minister stopped, and several persuaded her to hold her Peace; but the Glory of the LORD shone so brightly round about her, that she could not help blessing and praising GOD, and telling how GOD was revealing himself to her Soul. After some time, she was taken out of the Meet∣ing-House, but she fell upon her Knees praising and blessing GOD. She conti∣nued in an Agony for some considerable Time, and afterwards came in and heard the remaining Part of the Sermon. Ma∣ny, since this, have called her mad, and said she was full of new Wine: But, the Account she gave me of herself, was ra∣tional and solid; and I believe, in that Hour the LORD JESUS took greater Possession of her Soul. Such Cases are not very common; but when an extraor∣dinary Work is carrying on, GOD ge∣nerally manifests himself to some Souls in this extraordinary Manner. And I doubt not, but when the poor Negroes are to be called, GOD will highly savour them, <HI>to wipe off their Reproach, and to shew that

Had great Free∣dom of Spirit, and clear'd myself from some Aspersions that had been cast upon my Doctrine, as though it tended to <HI>Antinomianism</HI>: But I abhor the Tho'ts of it; and, whosoever entertains the Doc∣trines of <HI>Free Grace</HI> in an honest Heart, will find, that they will in their own Nature cause him to be fruitful in every good Word and Work. Many expressed how the Power of GOD was amongst them; and I believe GOD has much People in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> City. The Con∣gregations are very large and serious, and I have scarce preach'd this Time among them, but I have seen a stirring among the dry Bones. At Five in the Evening I preached again, rather to a larger Au∣dience; and after Sermon rode Ten Miles to a Friend's House, that I might be in Readiness to preach, according to Ap∣pointment, the next Morning. How differently am I treated by my Master.

<PB N="63" REF="004636_0062_100DB56D67CD06A0"/>
Expectation, my Soul was so carried out, that I had not Time to talk at all. A wonderful Power was in the Room, and with one Accord they began to cry out, and weep most bitterly, for the Space of half an Hour. They seem'd to be under the strongest Convictions, and did indeed seek JESUS sorrowing. Their Cries might be heard a great Way off. When I had done, I thought proper to leave them at their Devotion. They continued in Prayer (as I was informed by one of them afterwards) for above an Hour, confessing their most secret Faults; and at length the Agonies of some were so strong, that Five of them fell into Con∣vulsion Fits. The present Captain of our Sloop going near the Water-side, was called into a Company almost in the same Circumstances: And at Midnight I was desired to come to one, who was thrown into strong Convulsions; but felt some∣what of Peace and Joy, after I had pray∣ed with her several Times. — Her Case put me in Mind of the young Man whom the Devil tore when he was coming to JESUS CHRIST. These bodily Convul∣sions, I believe, come from the Devil, who, now the Work of GOD is going on, wants to bring an evil Report upon it. <HI>But, O LORD, for thy Mercies Sake,

<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 11. Preached in the Morning to about Fifteen Thousand Peo∣ple, and observed a great Melting to fol∣low the Word. Went twice to Church, and heard myself lash'd by the Commissa∣ry, who preach'd from these Words,
<Q>I bear them Record, they have a Zeal of GOD, but not according to Know∣ledge.</Q>
I could have wished he had considered the next Words, <HI>For they being ignorant of GOD's Righteousness, and going about to establish their own Righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the Righ∣teousness of GOD.</HI> Had he considered these, I might justy have said, <HI>Speaketh Mr. Commissary of this false Zeal, in re∣ference to himself, or of some other Man?</HI> In the Afternoon, the <HI>Tenth</HI> of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> out of which his Text was taken, was appointed for the Lesson; and had he not been more perverse than <HI>Balaam,</HI> it must have restrained the Bitterness of this false Prophet. But he exclaimed loudly against me in the Pulpit; and, as I soon found, obliged many of his Hearers to do what they before were much in∣clin'd to, I mean, resolve to leave him
<PB N="65" REF="004636_0064_100DB573193333D0"/>
entirely. <HI>I bear him Record,</HI> that Expe∣rience will soon convince him, <HI>that</HI> whatever mine be, his own <HI>Zeal</HI> is by no means <HI>according to Knowledge.</HI> After he had done, I preached my Farewel-Ser∣mon, to I believe very near Twenty Thousand Hearers. As the Commissary's Sermon was chiefly full of personal Re∣flections, I did not render Railing for Railing: However, I thought it my Du∣ty, in an especial Manner, to recommend Messrs. <HI>Tennents</HI> and their Associates, be∣ing most worthy Preachers of our dear LORD JESUS. One Passage out of the second Lesson in the Morning much af∣fected me,
<Q>And the LORD had Com∣passion on the Multitude, because they were scatter'd abroad, as Sheep having no Shepherd.</Q>
I then reminded them of our LORD's Command, <HI>Pray ye there∣fore the LORD of the Harvest, that he may thrust out Labourers into his Harvest; for tho' the Harvest is so great, yet the La∣bourers are very few.</HI> The poor People were much concern'd at my bidding them farewel: And after I had taken my Leave, Oh how many came to my Lodg∣ings sorrowing, most of all, that they were likely to see my Face no more for a long Season. I believe near Fifty Ne∣groes came to give me Thanks, under
<PB N="66" REF="004636_0065_100DB574A1529FD8"/>
GOD, for what has been done to their Souls. Oh how heartily did those poor Creatures throw in their Mites for my poor Orphans. Some of them have been effectually wrought upon, and in an un∣common Manner. Many of them have now begun to learn to read; and one that was free, said, she would give me her two Children, whenever I settled my School. I believe Masters and Mistresses will shortly see, that Christianity will not make their Negroes worse Slaves. I in∣tended, had Time permitted, to have set∣tled a Society for Negro Men and Negro Women; but that must be deferred till it shall please GOD to bring me to <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI> again. I have been much drawn out in Prayer for them, and have seen them exceedingly wrought upon, under the Word preach'd. I cannot well ex∣press, how many others, of all Sorts, came to give me a last Farewel: And, indeed, I never yet saw a more general Awakening in any Place. Religion is all the Talk; and, I think, I can say, the LORD JESUS hath gotten himself the Victory in many Hearts. I have scarce had time to eat Bread, from Morn∣ing till Evening. Some one or other was generally applying to me under deep Soul-Concern, and others continually pressing
<PB N="67" REF="004636_0066_100DB576C4C88C60"/>
upon me, to baptize their little Infants. I did comply with as many as I could; but I was obliged sometimes to say, The LORD sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel. Many of the <HI>Quakers</HI> have been most powerfully convinced of the Righteousness of JESUS CHRIST, and openly profess the Truth as it is in JESUS; for which, I believe, they will be shortly thrust out of their Synagogues. Some of their head Men are zealous against me, and are much afraid their Foundation will be sadly shaken. Great Numbers of the Inhabitants would have immediately built me a very large Church, if I would have consented; but I am perswaded, the LORD would have the Gospel preached in the Fields, and building a Church, would, I believe, insensibly lead the People into Bigotry, and make 'em place the Church again, as they have done for a long Time, in the Church Walls: — For these Rea∣sons I declined it, tho' notwithstanding, I believe they will build some Place or an∣other. What I mostly fear is, now there is such a general Awakening, People will not know where to go for proper Food (for they will no longer take up with Husks, as they have done) and then fall into different Sets and Parties. <HI>LORD JESUS look upon them, let not Satan divide

denied the Use of the Pulpit by one of his own Brethren, and was obliged to preach in the Woods, where the LORD manifested forth his Glory, and caused many to cry out, <HI>What shall we do to be saved</HI>? It surprized me to see such a great Multitude gathered together at so short a Warning, and in such a Desart-Place. I believe they were near Twelve Thousand Hearers. I had not spoke long but I per∣ceived Numbers melting. As I proceed∣ed, the Power encreased, till at last, both in the Morning and Afternoon, Thou∣sands cried out, so that they almost drown∣ed my Voice. Never before did I see a more glorious Sight. <HI>Oh what strong Cry∣ing and Tears were shed and poured forth after the dear LORD JESUS!</HI> Some fainted, and when they had gotten a little Strength, they would hear and faint again. Others cried out as tho' somebody was murdering them: And after I had done in the Morning, a Woman, under the deepest Convictions, threw herself upon the Ground, and hung round my Feet, so that I thought she would have pulled me down. Never was my Soul filled with greater Power. <HI>Oh what Thoughts and Words did GOD put into my Heart!</HI> And after I had finished my last Discourse, I was so struck with GOD's Love, that

the People. Look where I would, most were drowned in Tears. The Word was <HI>sharper than a two-edged Sword</HI>: And their bitter Yellings and Groans put me much in Mind of the Shriekings and Howlings of the Damned in Hell. Oh what diffe∣rent Visages were then to be seen! — Some had their Mouths half open; others pale as Death; others wringing their Hands; others lying on the Ground; others sink∣ing into the Arms of their Friends; and most lifting up their Eyes towards Hea∣ven, and crying out to GOD. I could think of Nothing when I looked upon them so much as the Great Day. They seem'd like Persons awak'ned by the last Trump, and coming out of their Graves to Judgment. One would imagine none but a Devil incarnate could have with∣stood the Power, or avoid crying out. <HI>Surely GOD is in this Place.</HI> — And yet one Mr. <HI>Al—son,</HI> a Dissenting Minister, a virulent Opposer of Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> and his Brethren, after Sermon was over, whilst Thousands were under the deepest Distress of Soul, came, desiring to have a publick Disputation. I told him I was going to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and that the Place we now were in, was by no Means pro∣per to dispute in. But he thinking that was only to evade the Trial, I desired
<PB N="75" REF="004636_0074_100DB5876AF89088"/>
him to begin, and I would endeavour to answer such Questions as he should pro∣pose. He then charged me with saying, That <HI>such who had only a Faith of Adherence were in a damnable. Condition.</HI> I answer∣ed, <HI>Such a Thing never enter'd my Tho'ts</HI>; I only said, <HI>A Faith of Adherence was not to be rested in, but that all should ask for and labour after a full Assurance of Faith.</HI> He then brought a Passage out of <HI>Isaiah, Chap.</HI> l. <HI>ver.</HI> 10. to prove, That a Person might be in CHRIST, and yet not know it. I told him, if he was a spiritual Per∣son, he would have known there was a Time, when GOD withdraws his sensi∣ble Presence from a Believer's Soul; and yet, that Soul might be kept from Doubt∣ing of his Interest in CHRIST. He was then about to quote some other Passage of Scripture; but by this Time the People were exasperated at his ill Treatment of me, and one <HI>cried out in his Haste,</HI> That he would take Mr. <HI>Al—son</HI> out of the Place: For this, I rebuked him sharply, saying, <HI>That was not the Spirit of</HI> CHRIST; and, at the same time, blamed Mr. <HI>A—n,</HI> for coming at such an improper Time to dispute, when he saw the Power of GOD so visibly amongst us. I also told him, that I believed he was an Enemy to GOD; but if he had any Objections to
<PB N="76" REF="004636_0075_100DB588F740BEB0"/>
make, I would answer them as I rode to <HI>New-Castle,</HI> or in a Letter, if he would send his Objections to me. Upon this he seem'd sensible of his Fault, and said, he thought 'twas best to withdraw. With great Difficulty I got upon a Horse, for the poor convicted Souls hung upon me; and after I had given them a short Ex∣hortation, to answer those that opposed themselves with Meekness and Fear, I rode to a Friend's House, who had invited me to Dinner, where we all rejoiced, to find what a Fool the Devil and his Ser∣vants prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves to be: For Mr. <HI>A—n</HI> did his Cause so much Hurt by this Action, and discovered his Enmity against the Work of GOD so evidently, that even his Friends began to suspect him. <HI>Blessed be GOD,</HI> I trust all of his Stamp, will shew themselves as clearly, ere it be long: —For I hate to have Com∣munion with ungodly, unconverted Mi∣nisters. I care not, if they all, with one Accord, were set in Opposition against me. And I pray GOD, those that he does not intend to convert, that he would be pleased to confound: For, by being suffered to worry our LORD's Sheep, they will but increase their Torment in a future State. <HI>I would,</HI> says the great St. <HI>Paul, they were even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off that trouble

He inveigh'd bitterly against the Doctrines of <HI>Grace</HI> in private, but was seemingly struck Dumb, after he heard me in Publick; for he did not open his Lips about the Doctrines af∣terwards. <HI>Oh how will divine Truths make their own Way, when attended by a divine Power!</HI> — They will either convict or confound Gainsayers. — As for my own Part, I am in Love with the Doctrines more and more, every Day. I find few others, besides carnal, earthly, sensual, de∣vilish Men, oppose them. And I think the <HI>Church of England</HI> is by no means be∣holden to Bishop <HI>Burnet,</HI> for his Exposi∣tion on her Articles. He has open'd a Door for a most detestable Equivocation; and, was it possible for the Compilers of our Articles to rise again from the Dead, I am persuaded they would insist on their being taken in the Grammatical Sense. — They cannot, in my Opinion, admit of a two-fold Interpretation. But how is

our once faithful Church become an Harlot? Her own Sons have been her Betrayers; and, I fear, if GOD does not speedily prevent, will prove her Murder∣ers. <HI>Father, for thy Mercies Sake, purify her Sons, the Clergy; and grant, that all, who serve at her Altars, may be cloathed with the Righteousness of thy dear Son; and preach and live according to the Truth as it is in JESUS!</HI></P>

Many People stood without the Church Doors; and I was enabled to speak, es∣pecially in the Morning, with such abun∣dant Freedom and Power, that I cannot believe any one Hearer could avoid being affected in some Degree or another. I was carried out for a long Time, and saw the Word strike the Hearers like so many pointed Arrows. It came with such De∣monstration of the Spirit, that carnal Reasoning could not resist it; <HI>Blessed be GOD</HI>! In the Evening I retired, and looked towards <HI>Georgia</HI>; but this Text was much pressed upon my mind,

<P><HI>Sunday, May</HI> 25. Preached Twice from a Balcony, to about Two Thousand People, the Church being not capable of Holding them. In the Morning I had not much Freedom, but in the Evening▪ discoursing on <HI>Abraham's</HI> Faith, a great many, and some even of the most polite, wept much: But alas! When I come to turn from the Creature to the Creator, and to talk of GOD's Love, in sacrifi∣cing his only begotten Son JESUS CHRIST, their Tears dried up. — I told them of it, and could not but from thence in∣fer the dreadful Depravity of human Na∣ture. We can weep at the Sufferings of a Martyr, a Man like ourselves; but when are we affected at the Relation of the Sufferings of the Son of GOD? Mons. <HI>Paschal,</HI> I have been inform'd, always wept, whenever he read of our dear LORD's Passion. And tho' Weeping be not always a Sign of Grace; yet, I think, it is an Evidence of the Hardness of our Hearts, and a Want of a due Sense of Sin, when we can weep at any other me∣lancholly Relation, and yet be unmoved at the Account of the Sufferings of a dy∣ing

<P>After Evening Service, thinking it time to visit my little Family (in all 17 Souls) I went on board, and GOD was with us of a Truth. I prayed with and exhorted them. My Eyes gushed out with Water, my Soul was full of a Sense of the divine Love, and my little Flock wept bitterly too. I was much carried out for them and my dear <HI>Savannah</HI> Friends; and had some Thoughts, that the LORD would now send me to them; whether that be his good Pleasure, I de∣sire to be resigned, and thankful for this Delay. It has been made very beneficial to many Souls, especially to some of our own Sloop, and one more, once a profli∣gate Sinner, who I trust will make an eminent couragious Saint. — I think I have now preached Sixty-Eight Times since my Arrival at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and have been near Forty Days on Shore.

What GOD has prepared for me I know not; but surely I cannot well expect the like till I embrace the Saints in Glory.

<P><HI>Tuesday, June</HI> 10. Blessed be the LORD of all Grace, who still continues to do for me marvelous Things. This Day I hope Salvation is come to many in my House. Long have I interceeded for poor <HI>Savan∣nah</HI> People; intense Wrestling have I had with GOD, time after time, both in publick and private, in their Behalf; and <HI>Friday-Night</HI> GOD most remarkably an∣swered my Request. Ever since my Ar∣rival, my Soul has been quite carried out with a Sense of GOD's Love, in bringing me back so opportunely; and all this Day, one or two of my Friends perceived a divine Power coming gradually amongst us. In the Afternoon one of the Men
<PB N="90" REF="004636_0089_100DB5AA8F04AE48"/>
that I brought over, was enabled to wres∣tle with GOD exceedingly, both for himself and others. About Four GOD gave me to pray intensly and particularly, with strong Crying and Tears, for my Friends who were in the Room with me. Many came into the Passage near us, and wept much before the LORD, labouring much in their Souls. After this I went up and prayed, for near half an Hour, with some of the Women of the House, and three Girls, who seemed to be weary with the Weight of their Sins. But when we were at publick Prayer, the HOLY GHOST seem'd to come into the Congregation, like a mighty rushing Wind, carrying all before it. I was so carried out in my Exposition, that the Sweat poured most plentifully from my Face, till my Animal-Spirits were almost exhausted. I had not begun long, before several began to cry sorely, and the Num∣ber still encreased, till young Men and Maidens, old Men and Children, were all dissolved into Tears, and mourning after JESUS. I believe there was scarce half a Dozen in the whole Congregation, but what were deeply affected. I think I never saw the like before; it amazed me, and I think it must have affected the Heart of any one, not quite dead to GOD, to
<PB N="91" REF="004636_0090_100D862219D83218"/>
behold the little Lambs crying most bit∣terly: And what was more extraordinary, after Church several of my Parishioners, all the Family, and my little Children, came crying along the Street; and many could not avoid Praying very loud. Be∣ing come Home, I laid myself on the Bed, weak in Body and astonish'd at the Power of GOD; but finding so many come up in such a Condition, I rose from the Bed, and betook myself unto Prayer again; but had not I lifted up my Voice like a Trum∣pet, the Groans and Cries of the Chil∣dren and People would have prevented my being heard. This continued for near an Hour, till at last, finding their Concern rather increase than abate, I de∣sired all to retire. — But Oh! how was I delighted afterwards, to hear some or other praying most intensively to GOD in every Corner of the House; and it sur∣prized me to hear what a Spirit of Sup∣plication was put into the Hearts of some of the Boys and Girls. It happened also to thunder and lighten, which added much to the Solemnity of the Night, and reminded us more of the Coming of the Son of Man. After my Parishioners were gone, and my Family retir'd for about an Hour; when I thought their Spirits were composed, I called all together, and sung

an Hymn to our dear LORD JESU whose Hand alone had brought su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mighty Things to pass.

The Boys also go on well. I walk out with them, or the Girls, under Convicti∣on, once every Day; and am delighted to find what a rational Account they give me of the Work of GOD; and how they are let to see the Corruptions of their Na∣ture. They are observed frequently to retire; and some of them have prayed

extempore sweetly before me; and at other Times they have been overheard wrestling with GOD in the strongest Manner, and praying to JESUS CHRIST to deliver them from the Bottomless Pit. Several also of my Parishioners are under great Concern, but I mention my Orphans in particular, that their Benefactors may rejoice, in see∣ing what GOD is doing for their Souls. <HI>Blessed be His holy Name,</HI> our Affairs are now carried on with Decency and Order; and I really believe, <HI>Savannah</HI> will yet be∣come the Joy of the Earth. E'er long, I trust, the LORD will take it into his own Hands, and then the Curse, which, I believe, has hitherto been lying on it, will be taken off. I am now beginning to build a Church; and when Matters are brought to a sufficient Extremity, then, I believe, will be the LORD's Opportunity to save and deliver us. He seems to be purging the Province apace. The Sword will sweep away the Refuse of Lies; and, I trust, a Place will yet be prepar'd in this despised Place, for our dear LORD's own People. Blessed be GOD, my Children are industrious: We have now in the House near 100 Yards of Cloth, spun and weaved; I have also, several Tradesmen belonging to my House; much Cattle on our Plantation: And, I hope, 'ere long

we shall live amongst ourselves. I have several Masters for the Children, who watch over them both in and after School-Hours: Generally, once a Day, they walk with their respective Charges, tell them of the Glory of GOD in the Creation; and praise him by singing a Hymn.— But I shall defer giving a more particular Account, till I send my next Journal. As it is un∣certain when I shall return to my native Country, I thought it my Duty to send this in the mean while, that my dear Friends may give Thanks in my Behalf, and by their Prayers strengthen my Hands; For an effectual Door is Opening in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> for Preaching the Gospel. We hear of Wars, and Rumours of Wars, but let not the Servants of JESUS CHRIST be troubled: — For the LORD generally ushers in his Kingdom with dreadful Pomp, and destroys those with the Sword of the Enemy, who would not be wounded with the Sword of the Spirit.
