<P><HI>SOME apology seems due to the subscribers for and patrons of this Poem, on account of the publication having been delayed till this time. The long indisposition of the author, which terminated in his death, it is hoped will suffi∣ciently apologize for the delay. Had his life been prolonged, and health permitted, his intention was to have made some alterations and corrections; but the work is now handed to the world in the manner he left it, pursuant to his request.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT of the Author.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE design of these Essays is to paint Religion in her native beauties. They are principally intended for youth, to give them just views of Religion, and to persuade them to love and practise it. The subject required me to study perspi∣cuity and percision more than elegance, and truth more than poetical embellishment. I am sensible the Poem will not bear a critical examination; but hope the faults are not so nume∣rous as to render the whole disgusting even to nice judges.</HI></P>

Shews how to obtain the happiness of the world. The folly of making this world our</HI> all, <HI>exemplified by the story of the fool in the gospel. God the only satisfying portion of the soul; made to be happy no where else but in God. Story of Avidus and Palmura. Alexander and Diogenes. The world's vanity. The world's goodness.

<HEAD>The BEAUTIES of RELIGION. BOOK I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LET others sing of heroes, and their feats;</L>
<L>Of earth-born beauties, and their matchless charms;</L>
<L>Whose glories brighten oft, by ignominious</L>
<L>And inglorious deeds:—far and wide to spread</L>
<L>Dire devastation o'er embattled realms;</L>
<L>To stain the earth with crimson, kingdoms shake,</L>
<L>Cities and empires turn to ruinous heaps;</L>
<L>Procure the wreath, and plume the conqueror's brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Religion</HI> be my theme; thy glory sing,</L>
<L>Thou bright effulgence of the Deity;</L>
<L>Offspring of God; from Heaven come down to earth,</L>
<L>To shew a world, in <HI>darkness lost,</HI> the way</L>
<L>To palaces of joy, in realms of light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Shall earthly beauties share the praise of song?</L>
<L>Religion! Queen of Heaven, in brightness walks</L>
<L>The earth around, whose beauty's all divine,</L>
<L>Whose presence beautifies the brighten'd scenes</L>
<L>Of happiest times, and fills the world with joy;</L>
<L>Her beauty yet unsung! timid with awe</L>
<L>From dazzling glories! fearful and trembling</L>
<L>At the bold attempt, now first essay'd;</L>
<L>In praise of that fair Goddess born I sing;</L>
<L>Whose praise a Raphael might have sung, and fail'd</L>
<L>Fully to set her shining beauties forth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should Heaven's whole choir tune their melodious lyres,</L>
<L>To celebrate her praise in loftiest strains;</L>
<L>Her shining glory still exceeds their song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How then "shall <HI>mortal tongue</HI> presume to sing,"</L>
<L>And touch a theme so high, that angels fail!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="021826_0006_0FB5BC55773FAD40"/>
Divine, effulgent, glory's beauteous form</L>
<L>In earthly strains to sing! <HI>Oh vain attempt!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How <HI>far</HI> below, such lofty strains to reach,</L>
<L><HI>My</HI> highest notes must fall! Goddess divine,</L>
<L>As kind as fair, the <HI>will</HI> for deeds accepts:</L>
<L><HI>My willing mind</HI> would soar seraphic heights;</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>low</HI> my flight, yet <HI>glorious the attempt.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O could the theme be touch'd finer minds!</L>
<L>By some Miltonian genius, or like Young;</L>
<L>Or by Columbian bards, Barlow or Dwight;</L>
<L>Or Humphry's tuneful lays, politely fine:</L>
<L>Fly where I creep, and where I fall to soar,</L>
<L>With brighter flames, to play more sprightly beams;</L>
<L>Content <HI>my spark</HI> in darkness shall <HI>go out;</HI></L>
<L>My muse <HI>abortive</HI> in oblivion sink!</L>
<L>Enamour'd with your lays, ye tuneful bards,</L>
<L>My soul took wing, and soar'd to reach those strains:</L>
<L>But to such flowing numbers, sense refin'd,</L>
<L>Harmonic sweetness, captivating charms,</L>
<L>My verse pretends not.—</L>
<L>If coarser strings I touch compar'd with yours,</L>
<L>Joining in symphony, still swells the song.</L>
<L>The deep sonorous <HI>bass,</HI> when to the fine,</L>
<L>The female treble join'd, with tenor soft,</L>
<L>And lofty counter, graces ev'ry muse.</L>
<L>Ambitious then Columbian harmony</L>
<L>Not either string should want, in concert grand;</L>
<L>Content to strike the <HI>lowest,</HI> and obtain</L>
<L>My highest wish, if so as not to jar.</L>
<L>And inclination pow'rful sweetly prompts,</L>
<L>Fair youth with serious song to captivate;</L>
<L>And make their bosoms glow with love divine;</L>
<L>And centre in the fairest of Heaven's fair.</L>
<L>To paint her beauteous form, I go in quest</L>
<L>Of her to guide my pencil; and to learn</L>
<L>Her heavenly charms from her sweet lips inspir'd:</L>
<L>But where is found this Goddess to inspire?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="021826_0007_0FB5BC5CC96EEEA8"/>
<L>In Heav'n she reigns triumphant, fills her wide</L>
<L>Dominions with eternal joy; on earth</L>
<L>She has a mansion too; but who can tell</L>
<L>Where fix'd her shining feat? whose glorious fame</L>
<L>Has spread the earth around. Where'er the sun</L>
<L>On empires shines, Pagans and Christians,</L>
<L>Mahometans and Jews, her power confess,</L>
<L>Her aid implore, and in her smiles rejoice.</L>
<L>Tho' far remote her throne from empire great,</L>
<L>Her very <HI>shadow</HI> casts a pleasing joy;</L>
<L>What then her presence? bliss beyond compare;</L>
<L>Her fame is heard, her shadow's felt; but where's</L>
<L>Her presence? where shines with native lustre,</L>
<L><HI>Unobscur'd</HI> by pomp imperial? where fits</L>
<L>In splendour, without borrow'd robes, this Queen</L>
<L>Of Beauties, dress'd in Heaven's attire? I roam</L>
<L>In quest; through cities, empires of the world.</L>
<L>Thro' Pagan states I wander, scarce perceive</L>
<L>The shadow of her form. If here she's found,</L>
<L>Her beauty's quite defac'd, in mangled form</L>
<L>Appears; her visage marr'd, gloomy and sad;</L>
<L>Her head reclin'd; eyes dropping with perpetual</L>
<L>Tears, o'er her votaries, misled and blind.</L>
<L>The fane superb admits the painted <HI>stock;</HI></L>
<L>Beasts growl, and serpents hiss, at their <HI>prostrate</HI></L>
<L><HI>Adorers;</HI> from these I turn abhorrent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Through Turkish lands I next explore her paths.</L>
<L>Mahometans her presence claim; adore</L>
<L>The Goddess yet ignorant of her charms:</L>
<L>In gaudy dress she shines, and clad'in arms,</L>
<L>Her majesty's support.—External pomp</L>
<L>Her beauty hides; her presence she withdraws,</L>
<L>When <HI>outward splendour soils</HI> her beauteous form.</L>
<L>Amidst the din of arms, <HI>not long resides;</HI></L>
<L>Trumpets, which blow alarms, <HI>not her delight;</HI></L>
<L>The thundering cannons drive her far remote;</L>
<L>Hence impious wretches round war's banners swarm,</L>
<L>Not garments roll'd in blood; <HI>her emblem's peace.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="021826_0008_0FB5BC5E4196AD60"/>
High o'er their heads she sits, with pity weeps;</L>
<L>Whilst alcorans and sonnites fierce engage,</L>
<L>Defend her majesty's renown to blood.</L>
<L>Midst such abhorr'd destruction vain's my search;</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>life</HI> and <HI>glory</HI> that Religion <HI>loves.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From hence to lands call'd Christian I proceed.</L>
<L>In Christian lands her dwelling was of old;</L>
<L>When love was law, they triumph'd in her smiles,</L>
<L>Whose joys arose to transport in her blaze;</L>
<L>When in her native robes she shone resplendent,</L>
<L>And sat the chief in courts illustrious.</L>
<L>When stript of Heaven's attire, her vest from earth;</L>
<L>And made to cringe in service to the great;</L>
<L>A tool to lust and power, and fell revenge;</L>
<L>In courts, in churches, synods, found no more!</L>
<L>Screen'd from our view by masks of <HI>modes</HI> and <HI>forms,</HI></L>
<L>Within the sacred fane appears in <HI>black;</HI></L>
<L>Blind devotees! unconscious of her charms!</L>
<L>Hence discord fierce; blind superstition reigns;</L>
<L>And fiery zeal her absence <HI>loud</HI> proclaim.</L>
<L>Too delicate the whirlwind's furious blast</L>
<L>To bear; the quaking earth and raging flames</L>
<L>Confused noise she flies; a still, small voice,</L>
<L>And <HI>love's smooth element,</HI> is her delight;</L>
<L>Peace her attendant, light her steps surrounds,</L>
<L>And zeal with love inwove, her mantle form;</L>
<L>Truths clad with radiance, white as driven snow,</L>
<L>Beam round the Goddess fair, and grace her form.</L>
<L>Ah! where thro' Christendom is such perfection found?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' Jewry next. Where once a temple rose,</L>
<L>In honour to the Goddess, glorious bright,</L>
<L>Superb of structure, wonder of the world;</L>
<L>By Israel's wisest King, at God's command;</L>
<L>This heav'nly Fair's peculiar seat; <HI>her grace</HI></L>
<L>With glory fill'd the house; when ardent prayer,</L>
<L>Which opens Heaven, and courts her from the skies</L>
<L>To take her dwelling with the sons of men,</L>
<L>By Israel's King was offer'd to his God;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="021826_0009_0FB5BC5FA22AB828"/>
(For then ev'n kings were not asham'd to pray)</L>
<L>Her presence the chief glory of that fane,</L>
<L>Whose outward form so bright, struck Sheba's queen</L>
<L>With stupor.—Where now resides her glory?</L>
<L>Ezekiel thou wilt tell; blest son of man!</L>
<L>With visions of th' Almighty favour'd high.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" This Queen of Beauties, and Heaven's fairest call'd,</L>
<L>" <HI>The Glory of the Lord,</HI> long sat between</L>
<L>" The cherubim on mercy's shining seat;</L>
<L>" Whilst offerings pure, acceptable and sweet,</L>
<L>" Smok'd on her altar; and still there had sat,</L>
<L>" But for the blackest deeds, which hate the light;</L>
<L>" And disrespect, and idle worship, bold</L>
<L>" Transgressors of her sacred laws despis'd;</L>
<L>" Her solemn rites profan'd, her counsels scorn'd;</L>
<L>" At length provok'd in spirit griev'd, dropp'd tears</L>
<L>" Of pity o'er her sacrilegious sons;</L>
<L>" Prepar'd by slow degrees to take her flight,</L>
<L>" Her final flight, and leave the temple grand,</L>
<L>" Shining and beautiful, of <HI>glory void,</HI></L>
<L>" First, to the threshold she remov'd her seat,</L>
<L>" To the eastern gate; then from the holy city,</L>
<L>" To Olive's mount (from whence the Lord of life</L>
<L>" Chose to ascend) from thence to lands unknown."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here paus'd the Prophet—when with grief o'er whelm'd</L>
<L>Thus said, in vain's my search, Religion's fled!</L>
<L>Forever fled! beyond a mortal's sight!</L>
<L>Her throne in Heaven resum'd, and left the earth</L>
<L>All solitary, sad, more dark than night!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not so, the Prophet smiling said, <HI>not so;</HI></L>
<L>Still <HI>her delights are with the sons of men:</HI></L>
<L>In sanctuaries small now she resides,</L>
<L>Far from the pomp and splendour of the world,</L>
<L>In <HI>hearts made new and pure is now her seat:</HI></L>
<L>Confin'd to <HI>time,</HI> nor <HI>place,</HI> to <HI>modes,</HI> nor <HI>sects;</HI></L>
<L>Her shining throne erects in <HI>ev'ry place,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In ev'ry heart, where love and goodness dwell.</HI></L>
<L>Empress of living temples now she reigns.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="021826_0010_0FB5BC67514478A0"/>
Hence this high title to the pure belongs,</L>
<L>Ye are the <HI>temples of the Holy Ghost.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He ceas'd: full to my view the heav'nly Fair</L>
<L>Display'd her shining form: with transport thus;</L>
<L>No more in foreign realms in quest I roam;</L>
<L>Triumphantly transported, rapt with joy,</L>
<L>At that superior form: O heav'nly Fair,</L>
<L>Whose flowing robe refulgent waves around,</L>
<L>Of snowy white; of aspect mild, serene.</L>
<L>With awe profound, and veneration struck;</L>
<L>Silent and motionless I stood enrapt;</L>
<L>Till smiling, thus the Goddess said: fear not</L>
<L>To ask, request; prompt to assist, direct,</L>
<L>And crown with glory the sincere of heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Embolden'd by her kind and soft address,</L>
<L>Thus to this fair Celestial I reply'd;</L>
<L>Thro' kingdoms, and thro' empires of the world,</L>
<L>In quest of pure Religion, have I rov'd,</L>
<L>T' implore her aid, her <HI>beauties</HI> to make known</L>
<L>To sons of men; to learn from <HI>whence she came;</HI></L>
<L>Her <HI>kind design,</HI> and <HI>end to which she leads:</HI></L>
<L>Quick she replies, my aid's not sought in vain;</L>
<L>"For my delights are with the sons of men;"</L>
<L>Listen, make known the pleasing truths, of Heaven</L>
<L>I now unfold:—with heav'nly charms begins.</L>

<L>To publish purposes of grace, and bless</L>
<L>With an immortal life all human race,</L>
<L>Who give me kind reception in their hearts,</L>
<L>To shew how fallen men may rise and shine</L>
<L>In all the glories of Heaven's splendid realms:</L>
<L>How those deserving of eternal death,</L>
<L>May take fast hold on everlasting life;</L>
<L>How deepest stains of guilt in blackest souls</L>
<L>May be wash'd out, made clean and whiter far</L>

Fit to inhabit climes where angels dwell,</L>

<L>Such the despair and agony of souls,</L>

<L>Midst of their years, their pleasures and their hopes.</L>

<LG>
<L>The world embrac'd, befools and them destroys:</L>

<L>Once liv'd in Christian lands a man of wealth,</L>
<L>Avidus was his name, greedy of gold;</L>
<L>He hoarded all his treasure in a chest;</L>
<L>His soul was there, no higher could it soar.</L>
<L>Palmura was his wife, with soul akin,</L>

<L>Scanty allowance made them pine amidst</L>

<L>Pleas'd with their coffers, never thought on death,</L>

<L>No time to serve the Lord or seek his face;</L>
<L><HI>God's days,</HI> design'd t' enrich their souls, employ'd</L>

<L>Expensive deem'd a friendly intercourse;</L>
<L>Their covetous hearts impenetrably hard,</L>
<L>The poor found no admittance in their house.</L>
<L>Palmura sickens, and draws nigh to death,</L>
<L>Expence prevents all needful help, she dies.</L>
<L>Avidus left alone, consoles himself</L>
<L>That all is now his own, no one to share</L>

In the possession of his golden store;</L>
<L>Not long enjoy'd.—Death comes, and bids the miser</L>
<L>Prepare to go where riches profit not.</L>
<L>Amaz'd with fear, he hears the solemn call;</L>
<L>But, oh! to part with what he holds so dear;</L>
<L>To part with all his glitt'ring stores at once;</L>
<L>The pang is worse than death: thus he bemoan'd</L>

<L>In such a glass as this how shines the world?</L>
<L>How empty, how delusive all her glare!</L>
<L>How helpless and deceitful, <HI>when most need!</HI></L>
<L>Poor in abundance was this man of wealth;</L>
<L>The poorer for his gold; more wretched far,</L>
<L>Far more undone: and still severer pains</L>

<L>Earth's treasures empty more than <HI>fill</HI> the soul</L>

Learn hence a lesson that will do you good:</L>
<L>Minds full of earth, are <HI>full</HI> of <HI>emptiness:</HI></L>
<L>All <HI>worldly treasure,</HI> but <HI>makes poor the soul:</HI></L>
<L>The more is <HI>gain'd,</HI> the greater are her <HI>wants:</HI></L>
<L>Shall that be satisfaction, which enjoy'd</L>
<L>Makes wants increase, and new desires arise?</L>
<L>Desires abounding, wants less satisfy'd?</L>
<L>In this just view (no other view is just)</L>
<L>How dwindles earth and all created bliss!</L>
<L>Who wants the least, the most resembles God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Riches and honour, pleasure, the great things</L>
<L>Which hold the world in sordid, eager chace,</L>
<L>Are all alike in this; the more is gain'd,</L>
<L>The more is yet behind: wants still urge on;</L>
<L>The prospect widens as they climb the hill,</L>
<L>Till airy schemes are raised Olympus high;</L>
<L>The base sustaining <HI>all</HI> gives way, they start!</L>
<L>Look round aghast! tremble on precipice!</L>
<L>Exchange the heights of joy for depths of wo.</L>

<L>Behold the heart of man: first small his wants,</L>
<L>Grow greater by increase of same and wealth:</L>
<L>On watry mirror look; behold the waves,</L>
<L>In circles moved around, by stone immersed;</L>
<L>But small at first, the little wave begins</L>
<L>To swell, grows greater still, and still more large,</L>
<L>It widens and increases, till it spreads</L>
<L>O'er the whole surface of the waving pond.</L>
<L>Just thus, man's heart on honour, riches bent;</L>
<L>When first the anxious, warm pursuit begins,</L>
<L>Little of each it seems would satisfy;</L>
<L>This little gain'd, greater desires arise;</L>
<L>Hopes higher run, with eagerness more warm,</L>
<L>To gain if possible an higher prize:</L>
<L>This higher prize obtain'd, 'tis still the same;</L>
<L>In him desires unsatisfy'd remain,</L>
<L>And still increase, and would so, till he grasp'd</L>
<L>Not only towns and kingdoms, but the world;</L>

<L>All happiness from thoughts within proceeds:</L>

<L>All greatness is internal, the mind's the man:</L>

<L>She mild reply'd: who listen to my voice,</L>
<L>Pursue the path I mark, let reason reign,</L>
<L>Peace shall attend their steps, and joy their end</L>
<L>Shall crown. In aid to reason am I come:</L>
<L>Reason, not sense, is man's peculiar guide;</L>
<L>The senses oft deceive, 'tis sacred reason</L>
<L>Finds out the truth of things. Stars to our view</L>
<L>Seem like to spangles in the sky; like tapers</L>
<L>Glitt'ring in the dark. The moon how small!</L>
<L>A little ball of fire the sun himself!</L>
<L>This world <HI>much greater</HI> than sun, moon and stars,</L>
<L>To reason well illumin'd the reverse;</L>
<L>Enormous the dimensions of the spheres.</L>
<L>Where <HI>sense</HI> no other world than this beholds,</L>
<L>All-penetrating reason clearly sees,</L>
<L>Within the vast expanse of firmament,</L>
<L>Myriads of systems, worlds in worlds enclosed,</L>
<L>Revolving in their spheres, round other suns.</L>
<L>What hence is learnt?</L>
<L>Objects, when great the distance, sense can't reach;</L>
<L>'Tis faith and reason look beyond the grave:</L>
<L>To sense <HI>this world is all,</HI> to reason <HI>all's the next.</HI></L>
<L>A mote in sense's eye may hide the sun,</L>
<L>The moon and stars, Heaven's glorious host: a mote</L>
<L>In reason's eye hides God and Christ and Heaven,</L>
<L>And all the glories of that world of light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let reason reign forever; clear her sight,</L>
<L>Obscur'd by mist's dark gloom, by senses rais'd;</L>
<L>Then look with reason's eye on earth, on Heaven,</L>
<L>Compare them; weigh in equal scales; then judge,</L>
<L>And give to both their due, and <HI>both are your's.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Reason's bright light's the glory of the man;</L>
<L>It is Religion makes <HI>that glory</HI> shine.</L>
<L>Virtue apart, <HI>that light to darkness turns.</HI></L>

<L>Religion, virtue always near akin,</L>
<L>To reason shining with her brightest beams,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="021826_0025_0FB5BC98BAFD7C78"/>
Reason is elder sister to fair virtue;</L>
<L>These sisters kind alternately embrace,</L>
<L>Support each other, singly cannot live.</L>
<L>Reason, from piety apart, is folly;</L>
<L>Makes <HI>reasonables</HI> but the <HI>greater fools,</HI></L>
<L>As capable of greater misery;</L>
<L>That <HI>greater misery</HI> to make <HI>their own.</HI></L>

<L>Reason is double folly, when apart</L>
<L>From true Religion; in herself confides;</L>
<L>She helps to choose the way to endless death,</L>
<L>And turn forever from the path of life.</L>
<L>As either with Religion join'd or not,</L>
<L>She's our best friend or greatest enemy;</L>
<L>Makes wife to life, or fools to more than death.</L>
<L>But without reason piety can't live;</L>
<L>Reason to Religion gives existence;</L>

<L>The way thro' darkness, to the realms of light.</L>

<L><HI>Reason and conscience</HI> nature's brightest lights;</L>
<L>Religion bids you follow; makes to shine,</L>

<L>To give directions; point to safety's paths;</L>
<L>Ne'er deviate from her rules, they'll push you back</L>
<L>From harm; and lead you on to noble deeds,</L>
<L>Such as will shine with brightest lustre, when</L>
<L>The sun and moon and stars shall <HI>all</HI> expire.</L>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A rural scene. The appearance of Religion. The creation of all things by one Supreme Being; hence universal obe∣dience inferred. The disobedience and fall of man, and some of the angels. God's great goodness to man in pro∣viding a Saviour: hence the highest praise, the warmest love, and greatest gratitude, are due to him. The cause why Religion is despised. Religion and happiness insepa∣rably connected. What great things it offers to us freely. False notions of Religion. The real effects of it peace, joy, &amp;c. subdues passions; removes the dread of death; destroys his sting; and makes eternity glorious. A view of the new Jerusalem. Narcissus and Lucinda, their happy life. Concludes with the folly of those who de∣spise Religion, and a serious address.</HI></P>

The BEAUTIES OF RELIGION. BOOK II.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SEQUESTER'D from the world, beneath a shade</L>
<L>Of bending myrtles form'd a cool retreat,</L>
<L>And kind protection from the scorching sun:</L>
<L>A murm'ring rill ran gently thro' a mead,</L>
<L>All green and flow'ry, pleasing to the view.</L>
<L>While o'er my head the songsters of the grove,</L>
<L>In nature's plumage gayly rob'd, sprightly</L>
<L>From spray to spray display'd their glossy plumes,</L>
<L>And fill'd the air with their mellifluous notes.</L>
<L>This pleasing scene disposed the mind to peace:</L>
<L>Lonely I walk'd in meditation deep;</L>
<L>With pleasure musing on the various works</L>
<L>Of God. What bright ideas strike the mind,</L>
<L>In aromatic bowers, by nature form'd?</L>
<L>Delicious balm of life! while musing thus,</L>
<L>Religion, heav'nly Fair! <HI>who loves a calm,</HI></L>
<L>With her effulgent glory beam'd around;</L>
<L>Whose radiance added to the beauteous scene</L>
<L><HI>Surprizing lustre.</HI> How blooms the blooming earth!</L>
<L>How shines <HI>this world,</HI> view'd by religious light!</L>

<L>Her beauteous form appear'd divinely bright;</L>
<L>With deeper smiles indented her fair cheeks;</L>
<L>Vermilion's bloom, with blushing sardines mixt;</L>
<L>Her beauty form'd; more beauteous from reviews;</L>
<L>More kind, more pleasing looks, more soft her airs,</L>
<L>And more engaging all her charming charms.</L>

The cause of <HI>hate</HI> to thy fair form unfold;</L>

<L>Th' Almighty spake; let Heav'n and earth be made;</L>
<L><HI>He</HI> spake, and it was done; the Heav'ns and earth</L>
<L>In all their shining glory stood complete.</L>
<L>Angels in Heaven and man on earth were plac'd,</L>
<L>In essence differing, as in different domes;</L>
<L>In this alike, all rational, divine;</L>
<L>To contemplate the glorious works of God,</L>
<L>And pay an homage due to the Supreme,</L>
<L>To praise, to love, adore, and to obey,</L>
<L>With highest ardour, gratitude and joy.</L>

<L>Angels, arch-angels, in the seats of bliss,</L>

<L>Here paused the Goddess.—My full heart exclaim'd.</L>
<L>Columbian youth, for you my bosom glows</L>
<L>With love and warm desire, to lead you on,</L>
<L>To bathe yourselves in pleasure's purest streams,</L>
<L>To drink salubrious draughts at fountain head,</L>
<L>And satiate all your souls with angels food.</L>

<L>Again this Fair resumed her charming theme:</L>
<L><HI>Religion</HI> bids you seek for heav'nly thrones:</L>
<L><HI>Religion</HI> bids you to be kings to God:</L>
<L><HI>Religion</HI> bids you to be priests to him:</L>
<L><HI>Religion</HI> bids you wear her crowns of glory,</L>

<L>What fools! what worse than fools! what, madmen those!</L>
<L>Who will not take the greatest bliss of Heav'n,</L>
<L>Tho' freely proffer'd, by Heav'n's Sov'reign urged;</L>
<L>Yea, rather feel his wrath, than taste his love?</L>
<L>And now mark well these words, hear for your life,</L>
<L>From all that's bad, Religion bids you turn;</L>
<L>And flee, as for your lives, from all that's ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Religion bids you flee from more than death;</L>
<L>She bids you flee from wrath which is to come,</L>
<L>And not adventure into endless flames.</L>
<L>Behold! Religion presses hard on <HI>all,</HI></L>
<L>To make you happy in eternal life.</L>
<L>How strong her motives! and how great her charms;</L>
<L>Her pleasing voice invites you to her realms:</L>
<L>Throws open wide her gates, and calls aloud,</L>
<L>Come, come and enter mansions of the gods;</L>
<L>Come, take abode in highest climes of bliss,</L>
<L>On thrones of brightest glory seat yourselves</L>
<L>In ivory palaces, <HI>where angels feast.</HI></L>

What mortal can resist who pleasure loves!</L>
<L>Whom riches charm! or glory can inspire!</L>
<L>'Tis glory, honour, riches, pleasure, call!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A shining glass she then display'd to view,</L>
<L>Around whose gilded frame, in capitals</L>
<L>Of gold, was writ:—<HI>Glory the wise inherit:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Wisdom's the food and glory of the mind,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A chain of gold, an ornament of grace,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A crown, a treasure, richer far than gold,</HI></L>
<L><HI>More shining than the ruby's glitt'ring blaze.</HI></L>

<L>In this bright mirror truth itself appears;</L>
<L>Treasures of knowledge and of wisdom, hid</L>
<L>From generations, ages, <HI>here</HI> shine bright:</L>
<L>Here man may <HI>know himself;</HI> and <HI>all</HI> to man</L>
<L>That appertains, of great or good, in this</L>
<L>Or other worlds.—Turn now thine eyes, and see</L>
<L>This world's beginning, and her doleful end.</L>
<L>On yonder corner look; behold the world,</L>
<L>From chaos rising fair: turn now thine eyes</L>
<L>On other part; you see her beauteous form,</L>
<L>With flames enwrapt, to utter darkness sink,</L>
<L>From whence she rose—and what between but light</L>
<L>With darkness intermix'd. A prospect fair,</L>
<L>A beauteous scene, all bright, all flow'ry,</L>
<L>Sudden with gloomy clouds involv'd, and scarce</L>
<L>A twinkling ray to chase the horrid gloom.</L>
<L>By gleams of light the blinded race of man</L>
<L>Rush forward, and in the croud are crush'd to death.</L>
<L>In winding, slipp'ry paths, through mire and filth,</L>
<L>They hasten to <HI>that pit.</HI>—Downward I look'd,</L>
<L>Wide yawn'd a gulph, dark, dreadfully profound,</L>
<L>And multitudes precipitately plunged,</L>
<L>Unseen, unthought, they blunder'd off the world.</L>
<L>With images of awe my mind was fill'd,</L>
<L>And thus this Fair address'd, with trembling voice;</L>
<L>O Goddess say, is this the end of man!</L>

<L>With looks of pity, kindly she reply'd,</L>
<L>Man's folly only makes his end forlorn:</L>
<L>Religion marks a <HI>safe,</HI> a <HI>shining path,</HI></L>
<L>Through this <HI>dark world,</HI> up to the <HI>realms of light.</HI></L>
<L>Cast up thine eyes, and mark that shining beam,</L>
<L>A radiance bright, in darkness to direct</L>
<L>The <HI>weary</HI> traveller in paths of peace,</L>
<L>Safe thro' this desart to the land of life.</L>
<L>A shining light I saw, and darkness fled;</L>

<L>Sweet peace, love, joy and light, their steps surround,</L>
<L>All pressing forward for a glorious prize:</L>
<L>I saw the shining path to terminate</L>
<L>In splendours, to effulgent to express:</L>
<L>And as they enter'd those bright realms of light,</L>
<L>'Midst dazzling glories hid from mortal eyes,</L>
<L>The Goddess said—<HI>glory the wise inherit.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This pleasing sight o'erwhelm'd my soul with joy!</L>
<L>Say now, thou Fairest, why in darkness walk,</L>
<L>Thro' crooked paths, in that broad road to death,</L>
<L>Such numbers of mankind? 'Tis their <HI>own choice,</HI></L>
<L>She said: Religion <HI>ready stands</HI> to <HI>guide:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Offers</HI> her <HI>aid;</HI> with all her <HI>eloquence</HI></L>
<L><HI>Persuades</HI> and <HI>calls aloud</HI> to <HI>all</HI> who run,</L>

<L>" O turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die!"</L>

<L>Some plead <HI>necessity,</HI> fate's stern decrees,</L>
<L>And think t' excuse their <HI>free</HI> and <HI>willing choice;</HI></L>
<L>Press reason, to help serve their base designs,</L>
<L>And push them forward in the road to death:</L>
<L><HI>So wilfully</HI> prefer worst ills to good.</L>
<L>If against will, fate urge, there's then no blame;</L>
<L>But willing to be led in ways of sin,</L>
<L>Whether by <HI>fate</HI> or <HI>not,</HI> the blame's your own;</L>
<L>For no decrees necessitate the will.</L>
<L>This the criterion fix'd by Heaven's high King:</L>

<L>Whilst unacquainted with Religion's ways,</L>
<L>Poor stupid mortals think there is no joy</L>

<L>False accusations! impious in extreme!</L>
<L>To say Religion takes away <HI>your peace,</HI></L>

<L>Religion bids her votaries rejoice,</L>

<L>What but Religion can give solid peace</L>

<L>Strange is their peace! their pleasure stranger still,</L>

<L>Religion taught them always to be kind,</L>

<L>A daily intercourse they kept with Heav'n,</L>

<L>Sweet incense to that God who rules the world;</L>

<L>ONCE more the Goddess from her shining throne,</L>
<L>In robes refulgent, shew'd her graceful form;</L>
<L>With still increasing splendour now she shone,</L>
<L>With princely mien and majesty she trod:</L>
<L>Her golden crown, lucid with pearly gems,</L>
<L>A radiant circle form'd round her fair face,</L>
<L>Which shone with heavenly lustre, and her eyes</L>
<L>Beam'd with majestic brightness, rays divine</L>
<L>Enwrapt the Goddess with a dazzling light,</L>
<L>Too bright, too splendid, for incarnate eyes;</L>
<L>In her right hand a golden sceptre gleam'd,</L>
<L>And in her left an olive branch she waved.</L>
<L>I saw the Alexanders, Washingtons,</L>
<L>And Caesars of the world,<HI>all</HI> came, and placed</L>
<L>Their crowns, their laurels, and their wreaths of fame,</L>
<L>At her fair feet, and said, <HI>thy glory's all.</HI></L>

<L>Again transported, my request renew:</L>
<L>Say, heavenly Fair, what influence thou hast</L>
<L>In states, in kingdoms, which thy charms adore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With aspect mild she kindly thus reply'd:</L>
<L>From the first dawn of <HI>being,</HI> to that hour</L>
<L>When sun shall shine no more, I rule and reign,</L>
<L>Nor drop my sceptre when creation sleeps.</L>
<L>Thro' worlds unnumber'd my dominions reach,</L>
<L>To nature's last extreme my sway extends;</L>
<L>I roll the wheels thro' infinite immense,</L>
<L>Then to perfection, when time is no more,</L>
<L>And all my willing subjects safely lodged</L>
<L>In those high realms, where none oppose my reign.</L>

<L>Perpetual hallelujahs to their God,</L>
<L>Owe their tranquility and sweet converse,</L>
<L>Next to the smilings of Jehovah's face,</L>
<L>Unto Religion's laws; <HI>all</HI> there matured</L>
<L>Into perfection, perfectly obey'd.</L>
<L><HI>There</HI> all her ways and laws are unobscured</L>

For as they are, <HI>all things by God are seen:</HI></L>

<L>False reckoning, therefore, <HI>to compute by parts:</HI></L>
<L>Days, months, or years, or ages, <HI>all the same.</HI></L>

<L>How to believe and live, and what's my power</L>

<L>This known, all knowledge else may be dispensed,</L>

<L>Equal her care for parts and the great <HI>whole.</HI></L>
<L>In worlds of light she reigns, and none oppose,</L>

<LG>
<L>What peace! what happiness! <HI>this world</HI> would have,</L>
<L>If all who lived therein were govern'd wholly</L>

<L>Rapine and murder, war and tumult, cease;</L>
<L>Destruction, desolation by the sword,</L>

<L>Fraud and oppression would be banish'd hence;</L>
<L>Malice, revenge, envy and hatred cease;</L>
<L><HI>All</HI> would be calm and quiet, love and joy.</L>
<L>A golden age at once would rise to view,</L>

<L>And speaks against Religion's peaceful reign,</L>
<L>Speaks 'gainst the peace and quiet of mankind:</L>
<L>His own peace too, in <HI>this</HI> and future state:</L>

<L>Transgress her rules, tread under foot her laws,</L>
<L>Do what they can to render earth a place</L>
<L>Horrid, delightless, full of impious deeds.</L>

<LG>
<L>The atheist and the deist each alike</L>
<L>Discard Religion, that is taught of God:</L>

<L>To look no further than the present state,</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="021826_0059_0FB5BD03C2F683B0"/>
The mischief would be great without repair,</L>
<L>Did all believe, as some pretend, and fools</L>
<L>Have said, that there's no God, Religion none;</L>
<L>God's will to man was never yet reveal'd,</L>
<L>No other law in force but nature's law,</L>
<L>Hid deep in ev'ry breast, quite out of sight.</L>
<L>This principle in full extent admit,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Religion walks sublime, and like the sun</L>
<L>Diffuses wide around her gentle rays;</L>
<L>And like the sun sits regent on her throne,</L>

<L>Whatever those pretend of love to man,</L>

<L>Religion's foes are always foes to God,</L>

Despise her beauty, God himself's despised,</L>
<L>If once Religion could be proved a foe</L>

<L>Look down on man, and fink his comforts low,</L>
<L>With just resentment then might reason rise</L>
<L>To extirpate and banish her from earth:</L>
<L>But since Religion benefits the world,</L>
<L>Promotes all order, peace and quietness,</L>
<L>That find a place secure in worlds like this;</L>
<L>Her rules the best observed, most peace enjoy'd;</L>
<L>Therefore, by ev'ry lover of mankind,</L>
<L>Religion <HI>must</HI> be cherish'd and embraced.</L>
<L>Religion's first and last requirement is,</L>
<L>To love your fellow creatures as yourselves,</L>

<LG>
<L>There's most perfection where's least need of laws:</L>

<L>Virtue and vice for sov'reignty contend,</L>

<L>What horrors are produced by vice's train.</L>
<L>How heavy was that sad and gloomy day,</L>
<L>Which fill'd the air with dying groans! made fields</L>
<L>To smoke with blood, and shrieks to pierce the skies!</L>
<L>From tender parents of their sons bereft!</L>

Thy heights, O Charlestown, dismal to behold!</L>
<L>As thick as hail-stones, when the leaden death</L>
<L>Flew thro' the turbid air; destruction sent</L>
<L>Promiscuous, thro' armies in array.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morn rose fair, and beautiful the day,</L>
<L>The sun with gentle influences shone,</L>
<L>And seem'd with smiles to kiss the distant earth,</L>
<L>And bid mankind be gentle, live in love;</L>
<L>To calmness all the elements were hush'd,</L>
<L>And gentle breezes join'd to whisper soft,</L>
<L>In the rough ears of man, both peace and love;</L>
<L>For nature and Religion teach alike:</L>
<L>Untaught by such instruction, high is man,</L>
<L>His passions boil when elements are still;</L>
<L>Then is the time for man to raise a storm,</L>
<L>A storm more black than nature ever made,</L>
<L>Tho' all the elements at once combined</L>
<L>To raise its fury to the highest:—such was this</L>
<L>Fair morning; long 'ere noon, sulphureous smoke</L>
<L>Involved the sun in gloom.—At dawn of day</L>
<L>War's trumpets sound alarm, drums beat to arms,</L>
<L>Thro' streets of Boston crouds of warriors press,</L>
<L>The form'd battalions to their boats proceed,</L>
<L>And ply the foaming waves with clashing oars,</L>
<L>Under safe cover of their cannon move,</L>
<L>Whose roar from Boston's heights, and warlike ships,</L>
<L>Made earth to tremble under floods of death.</L>
<L>When safe on shore they form their martial band,</L>
<L>And bent on death, while music fill'd the air,</L>
<L>Drums, fifes and trumpets, speak their near approach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A choice collected band of freedom's sons,</L>
<L>With hearts intrepid, tho' to war's grim looks</L>
<L>As yet unused, stand waiting their approach.</L>
<L>Mean while, inspirited by freedom's cause,</L>
<L>Their valiant General thus the host address'd:</L>
<L>"Brave sons of freedom, worthy of that name,</L>
<L>See hostile bands thro' slavish fear advance,</L>
<L>Push'd on by points of glitt'ring swords and spears,</L>

By terror only aw'd. Not thus are ye;</L>
<L>By liberty inspired, in freedom's cause,</L>
<L>Your General stands on equal foot with you,</L>
<L><HI>My fellow soldiers all;</HI> 'tis liberty,</L>
<L>Your country, and the rights of man, which call,</L>
<L>And press and urge you on to glorious deeds:</L>
<L>Let not base fear your noble hearts appal,</L>
<L>Let not fair freedom blush to own her sons,</L>
<L>Fair liberty gives all the sweets of life,</L>
<L>As thraldom puts an end to all her joys;</L>
<L>The loss of liberty dread more than death:</L>
<L>Our blood to spill in such a glorious cause,</L>
<L>Above the stars shall raise our fame, and make</L>
<L>Us free forever:—Now your courage shew,</L>
<L>And play the man—<HI>freedom and glory call."</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>This said—the signal's given; drums, trumpets sound,</L>
<L>The deep-mouth'd cannon's roar to voilies join'd,</L>
<L>With hoarse horrific rumble fill the air,</L>
<L>Spreads far and wide, with swelling horror rolls;</L>
<L>The troubled air with hollow roar dashes</L>
<L>The distant clouds! shock'd aether trembles!</L>
<L>Shudders earth and Heav'n! convulsed all nature,</L>
<L>As in pangs of death, with groans expiring,</L>
<L>In dust men roll, and writhe their tortured limbs!</L>
<L>While purple tides thro' many deadly wounds</L>
<L>Flow rapid; gasping mortals pant for breath,</L>
<L>And roll their swimming eyes till closed in death!</L>
<L>O vice! destruction at thy side still walks;</L>
<L>Grim horrors take the place of harbingers,</L>
<L>From Adam's deadly fall to this sad hour.</L>
<L>When Satan had returned from the earth,</L>
<L>And publish'd his exploits to all the damn'd,</L>
<L>How he had fill'd the world with sin and death,</L>
<L>(As Milton in lost Paradise relates)</L>
<L>Expecting loud applause, to serpents chang'd,</L>
<L>Applause is turn'd to an exploding hiss,</L>
<L>Presaging death to all his tow'ring hopes.</L>
<L>The dreadful hiss of balls the ear assails,</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="021826_0073_0FB5BFBADC836870"/>
An horrid whiz; not more confounded noise</L>
<L>That hiss of serpents on the lake of hell.</L>
<L>How solemn all! what anxious thoughts arise</L>
<L>In different breasts! two armies in approach,</L>
<L>Determined both to die before they yield!</L>
<L>See now all Boston's heights, and houses tops,</L>
<L>Crouded with those whose face turns pale with fear;</L>
<L>Their friends and foes they see glitt'ring in arms,</L>
<L>In clashing fury meet: O dismal sight!</L>
<L>By glasses brought more near, more dreadful still!</L>
<L>Where streams of blood from bleeding wounds are seen,</L>
<L>Men wallowing in their gore, panting for breath,</L>
<L>While hideous cracks loud roaring shock the ear.</L>
<L>Flush'd with high hopes, the Britons, used to war,</L>
<L>In martial order twice essay'd t' approach,</L>
<L>And twice, with broken ranks, were driven back</L>
<L>In dire confusion, amidst heaps of slain.</L>
<L>At such repulses boil'd their blood with rage,</L>
<L>Resolved to make one desperate attack,</L>
<L>When to dishearten and with terror awe</L>
<L>Brave freedom's sons, thy flames, O Charlestown, rise,</L>
<L>And pitchy columns darken all the skies:</L>
<L>The spiry flames afar the country round</L>
<L>Are seen above the clouds to wind their way</L>
<L>Thro' the convolving gloom, and then again</L>
<L>Old ocean shudders; the whole aetherial shakes</L>
<L>With peals of thund'ring cannon.—Hearts of steel,</L>
<L>Not to be moved amidst such horrors! deaths!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Involved in smoke, and solid columns form'd,</L>
<L>More boldly they advance, and with <HI>quick step,</HI></L>
<L>To storm the feeble batteries of <HI>a night.</HI></L>
<L>O'erpower'd by numbers, freedom's sons retire,</L>
<L>And Britons take possession of the <HI>heights,</HI></L>
<L>Erect their standards, and in triumph wave</L>
<L>Their bloody banners high.—War's clarions cease;</L>
<L>The troubled air to calmness then subsides;</L>
<L><HI>All'</HI>s hush'd.—As when a whirlwind's furious blast</L>

Destruction wide, tears up the trees, the fields</L>
<L>Lays waste, nor rocks its furious force withstand,</L>
<L>Houses demolish'd, trees uptorn, and rocks</L>
<L>Together hurl'd in wild confusion thro'</L>
<L>The troubled air; thick gloom the earth involves;</L>
<L>Amidst the darkness pointed flashes glare.</L>
<L>And convulsed aether shakes the solid earth,</L>
<L>While rattling hail-stones join t' augment the roar,</L>
<L>And strike a terror thro' the pavid heart.</L>
<L>When spent its furious rage, a calm succeeds.</L>
<L>Just thus the battle ceased.—And then proceed</L>
<L>To the last office of humanity.</L>

<L>The man, the patriot, soldier, all shone bright:</L>

<L>For human happiness a soul possess'd</L>
<L>With burning zeal and love, soon's fledged and wing'd</L>

<L>Tho' much solicited by all who loved,</L>

<LG>
<L>Again the Goddess pleasing voice is heard:</L>

<L>Virtue and peace walk hand in hand on earth,</L>
<L>Fair shining couple, never distant far.</L>

<L>And peace remain'd to happify both lands.</L>
<L>Now the reverse, Britain lies languishing</L>

<L>As when a lion from his den is roused</L>
<L>By hunger keen, he shakes his tawny sides,</L>
<L>Then rushes forth to seize on harmless prey,</L>
<L>Sends forth an hideous yell, the woods resound,</L>
<L>Earth trembles as if struck with thunder hoarse,</L>
<L>The timid herd with speedy feet make haste</L>
<L>To shelter from his deathful jaws; listning</L>
<L>Attentive, he pursues, grows warm in chace,</L>
<L>Seizes the hindmost, wets his chaps with gore,</L>
<L>And gorges flesh and blood; not one suffice,</L>
<L>Still he the chace renews.—The watchful shepherd,</L>
<L>At his approach alarm'd, fearless of danger</L>
<L>From this fierce foe, at once springs forth alert,</L>
<L>The proud, tyrannic ruler of the woods</L>
<L>To meet, and tempt th' unequal combat:</L>
<L>The great, the mighty monarch, swoln with pride,</L>
<L>Disdains his combatant, and stamps the ground,</L>

<L>While from his eye-balls living flashes glare,</L>

SOLILOQUY OF AN INFIDEL. BOOK IV.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE night is gone, the rosy morn appears,</L>
<L>And opening brings me to myself again.</L>
<L>From stupefaction, from the fumes of wine,</L>
<L>I start, with reason half awake, emerged</L>
<L>As from a sea of thoughts tumultuous:</L>
<L>Wherefore wake? to run the round of pleasure,</L>
<L>Live high, taste life, for pleasure's my pursuit;</L>
<L>To live a life of <HI>ease</HI> and <HI>merriment,</HI></L>
<L>Jocund and jovial in the joys of sense;</L>
<L>I want no more; away all thoughts of God,</L>
<L>Heaven, bliss and glory, in another state:</L>
<L>I hate reversions, present's all my wish,</L>
<L>The world's my happiness; take then thine ease,</L>
<L>My soul, eat, drink, be merry, unconcern'd</L>
<L>For future; seek them not, tho' Heav'n's the prize,</L>
<L>Eternal life in Heav'n! a mere chimera!</L>
<L>Fond fancy of the brain of senseless men:</L>
<L>No life, but life <HI>on earth;</HI> the present's mine.</L>
<L>The future none can tell, or <HI>how</HI> or <HI>where,</HI></L>
<L>In Heaven or hell, so the bold preachers teach;</L>
<L>'Tis naught to me; priestcraft's invention all,</L>
<L>And robs me of life's pleasures, if believed;</L>
<L>Believe who will, and mortify the body.</L>
<L>For fields elysian, in aether's realms, perhaps,</L>
<L>My resolution firm abides, and shall,</L>
<L>Desires of flesh forever to fulfil,</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="021826_0089_0FB5BFEEE491F040"/>
And gratify my sensual appetites;</L>
<L>To give loose reins to my impetuous lusts,</L>
<L>Full scope to all my passions and desires,</L>
<L>Pursue life's pleasures in perpetual round,</L>
<L>In spite of <HI>God,</HI> or man, or Heaven, or hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Big resolution! this makes men of spirit!</L>
<L>Noble and great's the soul with courage bold,</L>
<L>That dares defy its God, his laws despise,</L>
<L>Contemn his just authority, and break</L>
<L>Jehovah's great commands, his counsels scorn.</L>
<L>Puny and mean's the soul that bows to God,</L>
<L>That fears his <HI>wrath,</HI> or <HI>trembles</HI> at his <HI>rod;</HI></L>
<L>That seeks his favour, importunes his smiles,</L>
<L>Obeys his precepts, and expects his love.</L>
<L>Not such a fool am I, aversion <HI>all</HI></L>

<L><HI>All hateful,</HI> yea, Religion I despise,</L>
<L>And all her votaries, those simple fools,</L>
<L>That look for happiness above <HI>this</HI> world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come then, my heart, on sensual pleasures bent,</L>
<L>Look earth around, see all things she contains,</L>
<L>And seize on ev'ry pleasure as thine own:</L>
<L>Wake all thy passions; gratify thy lusts;</L>
<L>No pains or trouble spare; rise up, and run</L>
<L>To catch the <HI>golden prizes</HI> as they pass,</L>
<L><HI>Wealth, honour, pleasure,</HI> all that earth affords.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus then in jovial merriment I'll live,</L>
<L>Nor suffer aught to interrupt my joy:</L>
<L>Now glide ye streams of pleasure, roses bloom,</L>
<L>Sparkle ye glasses, and ye fair ones smile,</L>

<L>My hopes and joys! but wherefore fear? away</L>
<L>All dread of death! it ill becomes the man</L>
<L>Resolved on pleasure, God or death to fear;</L>
<L>This takes the sweet of comfort from the joys</L>
<L>Of earth, embitters ev'ry pleasure <HI>here.</HI></L>
<L>Why fear, or dread futurity? since naught's</L>
<L>Beyond the grave, and fears of death kill all</L>
<L>Life's comforts;—then depart, ye direful furies;</L>
<L>Leave me in full possession of my joys:</L>
<L>I will be merry, cheer my heart with mirth,</L>
<L>And naught <HI>but death</HI> shall stop my gay career;</L>
<L>Nor think of <HI>him</HI> untill he strikes the blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what avails! my soul is haunted still;</L>
<L>The flash of conscience is a fire within,</L>
<L>That blazes and disturbs, I cannot quell,</L>
<L>Its whispers oft are <HI>thunder</HI> to my soul,</L>

<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The good, &amp;c Many persons urge the diversity of opinions among Christians, as an objection to Christianity itself; and alledge the many different sects of worshippers, and modes of worship, as an argu∣ment against Religion; as though every sect and mode implied a differ∣ent religion: and because there is in reality but <HI>one,</HI> the pretend it is impossible to find the right with any certainty, among such a multi∣tude. This objection vanishes, by considering Religion not as consisting in particular <HI>modes</HI> and <HI>forms,</HI> though useful appendages, but a prin∣ciple of love and goodness in the soul. Herein all true worshippers agree, of whatever sect or party, how much soever they may differ as to <HI>creeds</HI> and <HI>forms.</HI> And those are Christians indeed, and truly religious, who have such a love to God, as influences them to practise universal godliness and honesty, of whatever denomination. Religion is no party thing, any further than she always dwells with the good. A bad man of any profession should not be accounted religious: nor ought Reli∣gion to be blamed because there are hypocritical professors among every sect; for they belong to her foes.</P></NOTE>The good are my companions through all worlds;</L>
