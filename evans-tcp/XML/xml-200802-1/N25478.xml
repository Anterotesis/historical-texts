<BIBL>GENESIS XIIth CHAPTER, 2d. VERSE.</BIBL>
<Q>AND I WILL MAKE OF THEE A GREAT NATION.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE passage now read contains a part of that promise, which God made to Abraham, when he commanded him to depart from his country and from his kindred and from his father's house, and to sojourn in a strange land. To induce him to comply with this command of heaven, he is assured that he shall become a great nation, and shall be raised to distinguished heights of honor, happi∣ness and renown. I will make of thee a great na∣tion, says Jehovah, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee. This promise we find fulfilled in the nation of the Jews. From small beginning they rose to national greatness and happiness. They were for a long period, a great, happy and flour∣ishing people. Under the protection of divine pro∣vidence, they were secure against the invasion of
<PB N="6" REF="033813_0004_0FF9568642B7A5F0"/>
enemies. God suffered no man to do them harm. He frequently appeared for their protection and deliverance, in times of danger and calamity. He gave them a land flowing with milk and honey and indulged them with all those temporal delights, which are necessary to comfort, pleasure and sat∣isfaction. God chose them for his peculiar people and distinguished them from all the nations of the earth, in regard to religious privileges. He made them acquainted with his perfections and instruct∣ed them in their duty. Unto them pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the service of God, and the promises.</P>
<P>THUS was the promise fulfilled. God made of Abraham a great nation.</P>
<P>IN the sequel of this discourse, I shall endeavor, as the words before us will naturally lead me, to shew what is necessary to render a nation great, ac∣cording to the sense of our text.</P>
<P>THE requisites of national greatness are many and various. In one discourse it will not be expect∣ed that I should notice them all. To make some general observations upon the subject is all that can reasonably be required.</P>
<P>THAT a nation may become great, prosperous and happy it is necessary that they form into society and establish a constitution of civil government, that shall be best adapted to the general good. What form of government is the best and most eligible has been disputed in all civilized nations, by men of know∣ledge and penetration. "Some have been plea∣sed
<PB N="7" REF="033813_0005_0FF956C561C147F8"/>
with a monarchical form, others have chosen an aristocratical; while others, have given the pre∣ference to a more popular mode of government."</P>
<P>THE interests, manners, customs and prejudices of mankind are so variable, that it is very difficult to determine what frame of government will be most promotive of the good of any people. But I think we may safely affirm that to be the best constitution, which abridges the liberties of a peo∣ple no further, than is necessary to their safety, prosperity and political happiness. Under such a constitution, persons are safe in their interest, hon∣or and property. Authority, when exercised con∣trary to the general and important end of govern∣ment, may be remanded and return into the hands of the people. But the greatness and happiness of a nation depend as much, if not more, on a wise and faithful administration, than on any particular form of government.</P>
<P>THAT a people may experience the happy ef∣fects of a wise and good administration of govern∣ment, it is necessary that their rulers be men of knowledge, integrity and religion. It is very evi∣dent, that men, who are invested with the legisla∣tive authority, ought to have some acquaintance with mankind, with history and with the various modes of administration in different nations. But, especially, it is incumbent on civil rulers to be well acquainted with the constitution of the state in which they live. Without this knowledge they must be liable to many errors; and while they in∣tend
<PB N="8" REF="033813_0006_0FF9570321505DB8"/>
to do essential service to the community, they may be pursuing measures, which tend directly to destroy its happiness. We pretend not that it is necessary civil rulers should be persons of collegi∣ate education. But they ought, at least, to be men of good understanding, that have a competent knowledge of the rights of mankind, and the nature of government. Ignorant men, men destitute of these qualifications, will, if raised to places of pow∣er and trust, be a curse, instead of a blessing to the community. They will be little more than mean instruments in the hands of men of crafty intrigue. A few individuals, in this case, will govern the state and a great part of the public lose the benefit of an equal representation. That persons, who are elected officers of government, ought to be men of knowledge and good understanding, we are taught not only by experience, but by revelation. The Jews were commanded "to take wise men, and un∣derstanding, and known among their tribes, and to make them rulers over them." On the other hand, it was considered as a great and heavy judgment, when weak and ignorant men were raised to sta∣tions of power and authority. "Woe unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child."</P>
<P>SOLOMON, when called to sit upon the throne of his father David, prayed that God would give him a wise and understanding heart, that he might be able to judge so great a people.</P>
<P>IF the greatest degrees of political knowledge are not an essential qualification in a ruler, yet he is unfit to be placed at the head of public affairs, who is of inferior abilities, who is unacquainted
<PB N="9" REF="033813_0007_0FF95732D1CB9A60"/>
with the constitution of the State in which he lives, and who knows not what it is to act right; for he is very liable to abuse his power, and to encroach upon the rights and privileges of the people.</P>
<P>"IN free governments, one observes, men are apt to feel, much quicker, than in those of a differ∣ent form. To touch their liberties, is to touch the apple of their eye, every attempt alarms them, and makes them jealous of further designs, and some∣times throws them into the hands of factious dema∣gogues, who are enemies to all government, and are ever watching opportunities to embarrass public measures and to introduce anarchy and confusion. Where so much, therefore, depends, and where the danger of acting wrong is likely to produce such mischievous effects in the community, rulers ought to know very well what it is to act right; where power ends and liberty begins. The more difficult it is to settle this point, so much the more wisdom, knowledge and prudence do rulers need, and so much the more cautious should they be in their political conduct.</P>
<P>ANOTHER indispensable qualification in rulers is integrity. The prosperity of society is in their hands, and the greater their wisdom and knowledge are, the more capable they are of destroying the interest of the community.</P>
<P>IF we have any knowledge of the history of na∣tions, we cannot be ignorant of the unhappy and ruinous effects of raising to stations of power and trust men of no integrity, of base and corrupt minds, of low art and intrigue. The most fatal e∣vils
<PB N="10" REF="033813_0008_0FF9576ADDDBEBC0"/>
in society have originated from this cause.—How many nations, which once enjoyed the bles∣sings of freedom and equal liberty, have either suf∣fered national annihilation, or been reduced to the most abject slavery by men of this description? In∣deed, where has the nation existed, that has been, for a long period, free and happy, while dishonest and unfaithful men were at the head of its public affairs? It cannot be named. But history furnish∣es us with an account of many states and empires, which have been involved in the greatest miseries, and finally were destroyed by means of corrupt and wicked rulers.</P>
<P>THE republic of Sparta, which flourished for almost seven hundred years, and bid defiance to the world, was at last thrown from the height of polit∣ical glory and happiness into the abyss of misery and slavery by unprincipled and intriguing men.</P>
<P>THE ruin of the famous republic of Rome origi∣nated from the same cause. While the reins of government were in the hands of upright and faith∣ful men, she flourished and was mistress of the world; but when persons of the opposite charac∣ter were placed at the helm of state, she lost her happiness, sunk into disgrace, and became a slave.</P>
<P>PERFECTLY agreeable to the dictates of reason, is that observation, "that nothing will so surely, so rapidly bring on the dissolution of society and the loss of the liberties of the people, as want of integrity in rulers."</P>
<P>THE divine oracles, which give us the best in∣structions
<PB N="11" REF="033813_0009_0FF957A75A37DE48"/>
how to secure our present, as well as fu∣ture happiness, inform us that "rulers must be just men, fearers of God, haters of covetousness. That, they shake their hands from holding bribes, because a gift blindeth the eyes of the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous."</P>
<P>REASON and revelation, then concur in support of this truth, that integrity in civil rulers is an es∣sential qualification, and that they only will be ministers of God for good to the people, who are men of integrity, uprightness and honesty.</P>
<P>WE proceed to observe, that religion is an im∣portant qualification in civil rulers. This finishes their character. This renders them acceptable to God, and makes them blessings to society.</P>
<P>RELIGION is necessary to the honor, usefulness and happiness of all moral agents; but religion is peculiarly requisite for civil rulers. It adds a dig∣nity to their character, commands the esteem and veneration of the community, and makes them, what they ought to be, blessings to society. Of such importance is religion in civil rulers, that with∣out it the best genius and the greatest knowledge would endanger the welfare of the State, rather than promote the interest and happiness of the pub∣lic. Men of enlightened minds and corrupt hearts, men of knowledge, but void of piety and the fear of God, are very unsuitable persons to be entrust∣ed with the affairs and concerns of a republic. Per∣sons, who fear not God and obey not the gospe of his son will not regard man, nor consult the in∣terest and well being of civil society any further,
<PB N="12" REF="033813_0010_0FF957E77AC98B98"/>
than what is necessary to their own aggrandize∣ment and the accomplishment of their own private views.</P>
<P>BUT that a nation may become great, it is not only necessary, that they have wise upright and pi∣ous rulers, but the people also must submit to law∣ful authority and equitable laws. The doctrine of non resistance and passive obedience, we reject with abhorrence. A people cannot, in justice be obligated to submit to oppressive and tyrannical laws. When laws are unjust, not well adapted to the circumstances of the community, and when a compliance with them would be attended with ef∣fects injurious to the public, the people have a right first to remonstrate and then refuse submission. But this right belongs only to the majority, the ruling body of the State, and not to any minority. If this principle be not established, all civil order is in danger of being brought to an end. When persons enter into society and combine in civil government, they oblige themselves to submit to the laws of the State, and it is trifling with society and government to refuse submission. It is relasping into a state of nature and subverting the very constitution and basis of society. Obedience to civil authori∣ty is absolutely necessary to the very being of a com∣munity, and every one is an enemy to his country, who refuses submission to its laws.</P>
<P>BUT it is of equal importance to national great∣ness, that laws wisely enacted and well adapted, be faithfully executed. Laws are not only necessary to the good order and prosperity of a community,
<PB N="13" REF="033813_0011_0FF9581B9551AC10"/>
but they must also be executed. Without this, they are perfectly useless. Persons, who disobey the laws of the community, ought to be noticed and brought to justice.</P>
<P>IN every State officers are elected and authoriz∣ed to detect and bring to punishment offenders, and every officer is highly criminal, who neglects this his political duty, who connives at and passes by breaches of law; for by this neglect he violates his promise and injures the community. He is an enemy to the State, and ought to be deprived of his authority and commission. Unless the laws of a community are put in force and the executive authority is exercised, the legislature will become contemptible and the State lose the advantages of civil society. Laws will never be obeyed without sanctions, and persons will never be deterred from violating them, unless criminals be punished. Therefore, no act of disobedience ought to be countenanced, when the interest of the communi∣ty is threatened. Conniving at one act of disobe∣dience will open the way for another, and finally, all violations of law may pass unpunished, confu∣sion and every evil work may enter society, and property, and even life itself become very insecure.</P>
<P>BENEVOLENCE or public spirit, an attachment to the body politic and the general good, in oppo∣sition to partial views, is requisite to national great∣ness. The grand political object, the good of the whole, ought to be kept in view and animate and direct the conduct of every individual. Persons, however, in promoting the interest of society are
<PB N="14" REF="033813_0012_0FF95842DE9C1328"/>
not bound to sacrifice all private views, and to act wholly from public motives. Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and to have regard to our own individual happiness is perfectly consistent with a true love to our country. Every member of civil society may always seek to promote his own interest, when it is not attended with injury to the community. But when by any act of this kind the interest of the community suffers, such act becomes unlawful and the author of it is governed by unjus∣tifiable motives. A selfish spirit in civil society is destructive both of private and public interest, and were this spirit universally to prevail, society would be subverted from its basis, private interest would be the pursuit of all and the public good engage the attention of none.</P>
<P>ANOTHER essential requisite of national great∣ness is domestic peace and concord. The happi∣ness of civil society very much depends upon its u∣nity. A people may be numerous and wealthy, they may be favoured with a good form of govern∣ment and with wise, upright and religious rulers; yet if domestic contentions and quarrels prevail a∣mong them, their prospects of national glory and happiness must be very gloomy. Their national strength will be continually decreasing, their wealth consuming, and they, in time, must fall a prey to their enemies. History and experience abundant∣ly confirm the truth of our saviour's assertion "a king∣dom divided against itself cannot stand." A peo∣ple when united may probably stand against the at∣tacks of their enemies, but when they are divided
<PB N="15" REF="033813_0013_0FF95860061AC650"/>
among themselves, when strife and contentions are prevalent, they must fall. One great cause of the subvertion of the Jewish state and government was division. They were, it is true, obliged to con∣tend with a powerful enemy. But they might have withstood the attack of the Romans and be∣come victorious, if in heart and measures they had been united. The Jewish history furnishes us with an account of that most horrible destruction, which the Roman army made of this unhappily divided people. Every one's sword was turned against his fellow; and they made but a feeble and short resistance. They were soon brought to desolation. Their cities were ravaged and consumed by fire, and their government was wholly subverted. The like divisions are generally productive of similar effects. Contentions in society are much to be dreaded and studiously avoided. They, when kin∣dled, are like fire, they increase their own flame; where they will terminate and what will be their effects, none can determine. They must injure, and they may issue in the dissolution of Society.</P>
<P>BUT let me observe further, that a spirit of in∣dustry among the members of a community is re∣quisite to national greatness.</P>
<P>EVERY excellent and mental accomplishment is the result of enquiry and application. By diligence only can arts and sciences be carried to perfection; and industry is the means, by which the necessaries, conveniences, and accommodations of life are ob∣tained. Reason and experience teach us that in∣dustry is conducive to national glory and prosper∣ity.
<PB N="16" REF="033813_0014_0FF95870A1E14B48"/>
It is this that leads to honor, to wealth, to wisdom, and to that bravery and magnanimity, which are essentially necessary to political happiness; and defence against the invasion of enemies. But idle∣ness is the parent of poverty, cowardice, weakness, ignorance, and every evil that infests human so∣ciety. It is industry, that supports rulers and sub∣jects, that supplies the wants of the needy and fills the garners of the wealthy, that keeps in motion the wheels of government and supports society. "There cannot be a flourishing people without in∣dustry, whatever other advantages they may en∣joy; for without this the benefits of nature must be, in a great measure, lost and the blessings of pro∣vidence thrown away. There are flourishing na∣tions in the world, that wholly owe their power and prosperity, next to the blessing of heaven, to their being remarkably industrious, which has raised and advanced them in spite of many great obstacles and discouraging difficulties, that stood in their way; and there are other nations which, notwithstanding many and great national advantages, have never distinguished themselves for want of taking the pains necessary thereto: Their sloth has kept them down and buried them in obscurity, they have fallen a sacrifice to their inactivity." "The hand of the diligent shall bear rule, but the slothful shall be under tribute."</P>
<P>But we proceed to observe, that a proper atten∣tion to the means of education and knowledge is necessary to national greatness. Knowledge is re∣quisite to the practice of every private and public
<PB N="17" REF="033813_0015_0FF95882F68A14F8"/>
virtue. A disposition to do well, without knowing how to perform, can be but of little use. In the early ages of the world the civil state of mankind was much more imperfect, than it is at this more enlightened period. Mankind were imper∣fectly acquainted with the rights of human nature. The arts and sciences were little cultivated. The principles of benevolence and sociability lay dor∣mant, for want of exercise and improvement. The minds of men were barbarous and their manners unsocial. In this state of ignorance they were ca∣pable of forming at best, only small combinations, and a few families constituted a nation.</P>
<P>They were destitute of that knowledge, which is necessary to forming extensive empires, and sup∣porting them in opposition to the influence of fac∣tion. This mode of living was not much prefer∣able to that, which is practiced in a state of nature. Their uncultivated minds would not admit of their becoming wealthy and powerful; and their genius was exerted mostly to destroy those who opposed them. But by attending to the means of knowl∣edge mankind have made the most valuable im∣provements. They have enlarged their ideas of living and becoming great and honorable. The rights of human nature are better understood, and the ad∣vantages arising from cultivating the arts and sciences have been sensibly felt. If we may judge of the improvements possible to be made by nations, from the improvements in past ages, we may reasonably suppose that knowledge may so hereafter increase, as to put an end to most of the evils that grow out
<PB N="18" REF="033813_0016_0FF9588DC4BB9410"/>
of civil combinations and governments, and unite all the nations of the earth in bonds of perpetual peace and love.</P>
<LG>
<L>" Then nation shall no more 'gainst nation rise,</L>
<L>" Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes,</L>
<L>" Nor fields with gleaming steel be cover'd o'er,</L>
<L>" The brazen trumpets kindle rage no more;</L>
<L>" But useless lances into scythes shall bend,</L>
<L>" And the broad salchion in a plowshare end.</L>
</LG>
<P>WE may further observe, that a free and exten∣sive commerce is necessary to national greatness.</P>
<P>IT is a rare thing that one country or kingdom will afford its inhabitants all the necessaries, con∣veniences and ornaments of life. Different soils are composed of different properties, and are cal∣culated for different production. One country, therefore, must be dependent on others for its produc∣tions by way of commerce; and this may be done without injury to any, but, on the contrary, with great advantage to all.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there are few countries, perhaps none that produces every thing necessary to ag∣grandize a nation, yet it may produce many things, that are, in a degree superfluous and may be ex∣changed for other commodities more necessary, useful and ornamental. In this way the wants of one country may be supplied by the superfluities of another. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tions of the earth, in the present age of the world, have much greater advantages in point of commerce, than the nations, that existed a few centuries before them.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="033813_0017_0FF9589C2BF9A120"/>
THEY had then made but small improvements in the art of navigation▪ which is necessary to a large, commodious and profitable commerce with distant countries. But the nations of the earth have now made such improvement in the art of na∣vigation as enables them to carry on the business of commerce with ease, dispatch and general success.</P>
<P>BUT we may observe, that martial power is re∣quisite to national greatness. In the present im∣perfect state of things, no nation is to expect to be always exempt from the unjust attacks of foreign enemies. Small occasions are often productive of discord and warlike contentions. A nation ought, therefore, ever to be in a capacity to act with vigour in its own defence.</P>
<P>THEY ought to be well acquainted with the arts of war; and to put their country in a proper posture of defence by sea and land. They ought to main∣tain finances, amply answering to the pecuniary exigences of the State; to answer with fidelity and dispatch the just demands of those, who risque their lives in the defence of their country. This is ab∣solutely necessary to national honor and safety.</P>
<P>WE observe further, that if a people would be great and happy, they must be careful of their civ∣il rights and privileges. The subjects of a repub∣lican government must to secure their liberties and perpetuate their happiness be attentive to their po∣litical rights, and with prudence and caution dis∣charge their duty at free and popular elections. It is not difficult, many times, for men of crafty in∣trigue
<PB N="20" REF="033813_0018_0FF958AED79717D0"/>
to obtain offices of importance, and to prevent the operation of the best civil constitution and laws. Bribery and an undue influence in e∣lections may have this effect. A free and unbiassed election is the grand bulwark of natural and civil liberty. And when a people give their suffrages in favor of crafty, ignorant and unprincipled men, they are destitute of that love to their country, which is necessary to secure the continuance of its liberties and independence. They do not con∣sider, that when the wicked, unskilful and in∣triguing bear rule, the liberties of the subjects are in danger and the people have reason to mourn; and that when the righteous, men of knowledge, integrity and religion are in authority, these lib∣erties are secure and the people may rejoice. It cannot be denied, that some persons, who have lived under a free and popular government, have discovered great depravity of soul by trifling with their civil privileges and selling their birthright for a mess of pottage, or a more contemptible com∣pensation. But all, who are true friends to their country, will reject with abhorrence the idea of bribery in elections or giving their votes in favor of any men for public offices, but persons of wis∣dom, integrity and religion. They will weep, that there should be the least reason to fear that their fellow citizens will ever become regardless of their right of elections, or indifferent to the qualifica∣tions of the persons, whom they elect for their civ∣il rulers; that offices of trust, honor and profit should become venal, and that the ignorant, shame∣less
<PB N="21" REF="033813_0019_0FF958BE223E4028"/>
and irreligious should be as fair &amp; eligible candi∣dates as the wise, modest and virtuous. They will detest the man who attempts to buy their vote, or seeks to obtain the honors of his country by a∣ny other means, than that of merit.</P>
<P>WE observe once more, that religion is absolute∣ly necessary to national greatness and prosperity.</P>
<P>RELIGION is the basis of public, as well as pri∣vate happiness. A body politic cannot have a pros∣perous subsistence, without the practice of virtue. "Godliness is profitable to all things." It is this that exalteth a nation; "but sin is the reproach of any people." According as virtue or vice prevail, so will a people prosper or decay. Vice and iniquity are the grand instruments of destruction in every po∣litical constitution. They generally have the ope∣ration and effect of natural causes. But righteous∣ness is productive of opposite effects. It insures the protection and blessing of the great Governor of the universe. It is the only durable basis of good government, of good laws, of mutual confidence, and prosperity. Where this prevails a people will not fail to rise to the highest degrees of national glory and felicity. The pillars of their constitu∣tion will be as durable as the hills and their happi∣ness as lasting as time.</P>
<P>No man, therefore, can better evidence his love for his country, than by endeavouring, in his pro∣per sphere, to prevent the contagious spread of vice, or to promote the influence of morality and reli∣gion. "Contemptible is that man's pretended love to his country who with an ostentatious zeal for her
<PB N="22" REF="033813_0020_0FF8D3D4E8739F10"/>
credit, her finances, or civil establishments, entire∣ly disregards that which is the basis of the whole.</P>
<P>HE is like the man who is careful to repair and adorn some less essential parts of a building, whilst he suffers the foundation to be undermined, which failing the whole tumbles into ruins."</P>
<P>THE truth of these observations is confirmed by the universal history of mankind.</P>
<P>THE Jews, we are assured by history, were a happy and flourishing people, while they were gov∣erned by principles of piety and virtue. While they were willing and obedient they ate the good of the land. Israel then dwelt in safety; the foun∣tain of Jacob was upon a land of corn and wine; his heavens dropped down dew; the Lord was the shield of his help, and the sword of his excellency. But, when the Jews became abandoned to vice, when irreligion prevailed among them, the Lord forsook them; and their glory and happiness de∣parted. They became an easy prey to their ene∣mies. They were carried into captivity, and final destruction was the fate of their policy, church and state.</P>
<P>To the same cause the corruption, of morals and principles, may be traced the complete ruin of the republics of Athens and Rome.</P>
<P>As long as temperance, frugality, chastity, and other virtues were national, and spread among them, they flourished and increased; but when im∣piety and profaneness, luxury and debauchery formed their public character and manners their empire immediately began to decline and decay.
<PB N="23" REF="033813_0021_0FF958DB161D7BD8"/>
Their national glory continued to decrease 'till it was entirely lost, their constitution was wholly sub∣verted, and those, who survived the destruction of their government were left to groan under the rod of cruel and barbarous tyrants. A corruption of manners and numerous crimes, says a writer, made greater havoc in the city of Rome, than the mightiest armies could have done, and in that man∣ner avenged the conquered globe.</P>
<P>THESE are some of the evil effects of irreligion and immorality, with respect to the well being of civil society. May Americans take warning and avoid the rocks, upon which so many thousands have been dashed in pieces.</P>
<P>FROM the preceeding observations, may not the people of America felicitate themselves, and en∣tertain the most pleasing hopes of their future na∣tional greatness? We possess at present many of the advantages which prepare the way for national importance. The climate of the United States is favourable to health and population. Our situa∣tion is neither within the torrid or frigid zone, but the temperate. Whilst we are warned by winds stretching over a large extent of country from the equator, the heat is tempered by cooling breezes from the sea and more northern climes. We are also favoured with a country fertile in its soil. There are but few countries suited to every pro∣duction; nor can we suppose this is the case with America. But its productions are sufficient to supply the wants and many of the luxuries of hu∣man life; and to furnish ample materials for com∣merce.

Diligence and oeconomy in the common class of people is one portrait in our national char∣acter. Improvements in the arts and sciences are increasing, and knowledge is progressing. The several States have not only civil constitutions founded on equal rights, but they are combined in one general federation under a national constitution of government, which serves to unite the wisdom, the wealth and the power of the whole, for the im∣provement, the defence and aggrandizement of the nation. We have the power of appointing our governors, senators, legislators, and magistrates, our laws are made and executed by persons elect∣ed by, and from among ourselves.</P>
<P>WE are also favoured with the most exalted reli∣gious privileges and liberties. We have a revela∣tion from heaven, containing the most excellent system of doctrines and precepts, and the most weighty motives to piety and virtue. We enjoy without molestation the rights of conscience, every one may judge for himself in matters of faith, and may choose such mode of worship as his reas∣on and conscience may dictate.</P>
<P>THESE are national advantages and blessings, which we have received of God and which we hold under the protection of his good providence. But our long enjoying them ultimately depends on a reasonable and religious improvement of them.</P>
<P>A republican government essentially depends on public virtue. Where there is a general want of virtue in the people and administrators of govern∣ment, it becomes feeble and contemptible; &amp; must
<PB N="25" REF="033813_0023_0FF955C66D69A7F8"/>
soon be dissolved. Whether there be sufficient virtue in the people and administrators of the gov∣ernment in these United States long to maintain it, in its present form, time and experience only can ascertain.</P>
<P>WE as a people have enjoyed a great degree of political happiness for many years. But our future prospects of national happiness are not so flattering as what they have been in time past. The republic of France has been, and still is attempting to in∣terrupt our prosperity. Proud, imperious and en∣vious Britain has attempted the same; but she has promised us reparation, and has ceased to insult us. France continues her abuses and greatly annoys our happiness, and instead of discovering the least disposition to make us satisfaction, insultingly de∣mands money, money from us to reward her for the infamous treatment, which she has offered to Ame∣rica. It is not necessary to remind you of the de∣predations which have, for some years past, been made upon our commerce by European nations. I presume they are fresh in your memories. But, I would call your attention to that which is both our duty and happiness, to love and defend our coun∣try. We are not Europeans, but Americans. Let us prove ourselves to be worthy of the name by dis∣covering a strong and firm attachment to the honor and happiness of our nation.</P>
<P>IT ought to be our prayer that those, who are at the head of our government, may have wisdom from above to direct; and it is a matter of the greatest importance that we be united among our∣selves,
<PB N="26" REF="033813_0024_0FF958F2970A8770"/>
and be reconciled to the administrations of our national government; and cheerfully unite our strength to support our independence, our rights and liberties against the invasion of a foreign en∣emy.</P>
<P>IT is said, that France befriended us in our con∣test with Britain, and that we are indebted to her for our salvation. It is not my design to enter into the political disputes of the present day; but I will venture to assert we cannot be under obligations to resign our liberties to any nation, whether she may have been a friend or a foe. It is our duty to defend our liberties and support our indepen∣dence against the assaults of all enemies. We ought to lay aside all prejudices and contentions, and in heart and measures be united. On this depends our national strength, security and honor. "Unit∣ed we stand, but divided we fall." Let us then guard against that party spirit, which has so much prevailed in our land, as to tarnish our glory and injure our happiness. It is said, that this spirit of late has considerably abated. If this be a truth, we ought heartily to rejoice, and to exert ourselves in expelling it wholly from among us. We ought to use our utmost endeavours to prevent conten∣tions and promote concord. To stimulate us to the most laudable exertions of this kind, let us keep in mind, that nothing can have a greater ten∣dency to bring on the dissolution of our republic and make us the sport of foreign nations, than di∣vision among ourselves. Division is the bane of society.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="033813_0025_0FF959043366DBF8"/>
THOSE jarring aims and interfering interests, which are produced by it, must occasion stops a∣mong the wheels of government, embarrass public measures, and greatly annoy the happiness of a people. "Where strife is there is confusion and every evil work."</P>
<P>IF ever our republic is destroyed and we lose our liberties and independence, it must be by be∣ing divided against ourselves. Such is our distance from the powerful nations of the world, and so great is our national strength, and wealth, that we can be brought to ruin only by that intestine strife, which preys upon our vitals and cuts the sinews of our gov∣ernment. If then we have any regard to our own hap∣piness or true love to our country, let us manifest it, by putting an end to our unhappy divisions and following after the things, which make for peace.</P>
<P>LET us cease to exasperate each other with vi∣rulent words, or the reproachful term of Jacobin or Tory. Let us cultivate brotherly love and strive to be good citizens and true Americans. Let us discover our patriotism by being well affected to∣wards our constitution, and by encouraging and as∣sisting the administrators of our government. Let no strife be known among us, except who shall be most active and zealous in promoting the honor, safety and happiness of our nation.</P>
<P>I congratulate my fellow citizens of this State in the choice, which they have made of a chief magi∣strate. We rejoice, that we behold at the head of our government, a Gentleman, in whom wisdom, in∣tegrity
<PB N="28" REF="033813_0026_0FF9590E0609C6C0"/>
and religion are united, who has had, for many years, the decided voice of his country in his favor, and has rendered essential services to the community. Whose christian, moral and political character must endear him to every enlightened and virtuous mind.</P>
<P>THE honorable Council, the honorable Senate, and Representatives will accept of that respect which is due to their character and important sta∣tion.</P>
<P>FROM the past experience, which we have had a wise and faithful administration of govern∣ment in this State, we now trust with our civil Fa∣thers, every thing dear in civil and social life. We flatter ourselves, they will be ministers of God for good to this people, and in heart and measures u∣nite to promote the best interest of their constitu∣ents. It is a day of anxious expectation, of trouble and perplexity, but wisdom is profitable to direct. May this respectable body "acknowledge God in all their ways, and may he direct their steps."—</P>
<P>LET us all acknowledge the being and provi∣dence of God, and be submissive to the govern∣ment of the great disposer of events and the gov∣ernor of the universe. How far the divine Being by his influence interposes in the affairs of states &amp; empires is not easy to determine. Reason and re∣velation, however, lead us to suppose, that the rise, continuance, and fall of empires is under his wise and supreme direction. The nations of the world, therefore, in their political conduct ought to de∣pend on him for direction. They ought to culti∣vate
<PB N="29" REF="033813_0027_0FF959209BA4EB68"/>
the principles of piety and virtue that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may secure his favor and obtain his blessing.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY, the principles of public virtue ought to be exercised and improved. National ex∣istence essentially depends on this. This has ever been the case, in the rise and advancement, and in the decline and subversion of states and empires. On this a good constitution depends. It is this that leads the way to frugality, diligence and oeconomy, obedience to wholesome laws and regulations, to union, benevolence and peace.</P>
<P>BUT above all let us attend to the things, that relate to our happiness beyond the confines of time. Let us cultivate the habits of piety and virtue, that we may become subjects of that kingdom of righte∣ousness and peace, which will survive every change, and continue after all the kingdoms of this world ex∣pire in the dissolution of nature.</P>
