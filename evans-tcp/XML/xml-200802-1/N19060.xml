<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN considering my intended subjects, the fa∣miliar style of letter-writing appeared the most eligible; and particularly, when I re∣flected upon the absurdity of using terms of art, in an address to the ladies. The three first letters will not, I hope, be esteemed fo∣reign to my purpose, as they seem to me alto∣gether introductory to the design. I was in∣duced to add the last letter, upon old age, in order to make the series of letters complete; having now, in this collection, taken up man from the first period of his existence, and car∣ried him through the various stages of life.</P>
<P>It being much to our present purpose, and intimately connected with the following let∣ters, I shall transcribe a part of the introduc∣tion to the eighth edition of the Family Phy∣sician, published about twelve months ago.</P>
<P>"Experience in physic is the wisest path to tread; and considering what poor crazy con∣stitutions too many of the human race unhap∣pily sustain, and the various disorders which even the most robust are liable to, no one can be too particular in remarking such innocent remedies as may relieve slight indispositions, and consequently prevent terrible and fatal diseases.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="024796_0005_0FC88EDC99BE1298"/>"Good nursing is a point which has either been too much neglected, or mistaken; ne∣vertheless it is of the first consequence to∣wards the cure of diseases, and the preserving of delicate and feeble constitutions. It is e∣qually so to render advanced age easy and comfortable, and to preserve helpless infants. To speculative minds it must be matter of as∣tonishment to observe the fatality amongst children, which the following table of births and infant-burials, collected from the bills of mortality, presents for their serious consider∣ation.</P>

The average upon the last ten years.</P>
<P>"Thus we see that almost two thirds of the children born in this metropolis and its envi∣rons are entirely lost to society: 16283 are, upon the average, the annual births; 10145, the infant burials; and, what deserves parti∣cular attention, 7987 are cut off before they
<PB N="vii" REF="024796_0006_0FC88EE2A62BBA80"/>are two years old, which is more than three fourths of those children who die under five years of age. How ardently therefore is it to be wished that such a fatality could be pre∣vented!—It may be prevented.</P>
<P>"Is it not affecting, that so many beings, just entering into life, should be so untimely cut off, to the detriment of society, and the af∣fliction of their weeping mothers? It is, tru∣ly, a subject of commiseration, a scene which draws a silent tear from the eye of humanity, and pierces the wounded bosoms of afflicted parents.—Above three fourths of these little innocents fall a sacrifice under two years old. It is well known, that the thrush and watery gripes generally terminate their existence in the early months; and, if they survive these maladies, the time of teething too frequently brings on the fatal catastrophe.</P>
<P>"Could we but conquer the prejudices of the times, and abolish unnatural and absurd practices—could we but restore that natural and simple method of rearing children, which the all-wise Giver of life has sufficiently point∣ed out—did we but confine them to that nu∣triment, which HE has prepared for their first state of existence—and consult that reason which HE has bestowed upon us, to conduct them forwards—all would be well. But, alas, indolence and luxury forbid the task! Never∣theless, to the rational few the following re∣marks are submitted.</P>
<P>"The thrush and watery gripes are, in the
<PB N="viii" REF="024796_0007_0FC88EE4E6D709F8"/>author's opinion, artificial diseases, and both of them totally occasioned by improper food; such as, all kinds of pap, whether made from flour, bread, or biscuit: they all cause too much fermentation in an infant's stomach, and irritate its tender bowels beyond what nature can support. This appears to him to be the evident cause of the before-mentioned com∣plaints.</P>
<P>"When infants are past this period, the danger in cutting their teeth is justly to be feared. This difficulty proceeds altogether from a weakness of constitution, arising from the same first mismanagement in point of diet: and here a train of dreadful symptoms present themselves; the head, the stomach, the bow∣els, are all at times terribly affected; a gene∣ral wasting of the body frequently ensues; and unconquerable fevers prevail, which ge∣nerally terminate in convulsions and death.</P>
<P>"To prevent all these unhappy consequen∣ces, let us but for a moment reflect that every mother is designed by nature to foster her own child. If the breast is not to be obtained, cow's milk is in general to be preferred to any kind of food that can be invented, because it is nearly similar to that which nature intended."</P>
<P>I sincerely wish the hints thrown out in the following letters may be attended to; as the success of rearing children, and the preserving infirm and aged constitutions, greatly depends upon good nursing; much more indeed than it does upon the application of medicines. For
<PB N="ix" REF="024796_0008_0FC88EE66288A320"/>although, by the medical art, many violent and dangerous diseases may oftentimes be pre∣vented from proving fatal; yet, even when the doctor has taken his leave, the good nurse must still be watchful, "to restore again the invalid to a healthy and vigorous constitu∣tion."</P>
<P>I was apprehensive, that many objections would be started both against my opinions and maxims; which, indeed, was a leading mo∣tive for concealing my name in the first edi∣tion: but as I hope I have spoken with can∣dour, and as I mean to persuade, rather than to find fault, it is to be wished, that the young∣er part of the female sex at least, whom it more nearly concerns, will not receive this little present with such unconquerable prejudices, as would probably have been experienced from their grand-dames. If, by addressing their un∣derstanding, I should be happy enough to con∣vince their judgment, of the propriety of the following observations, I trust they may prove in some measure beneficial both to themselves and their future daughters, in the exalted cha∣racters of wives and mothers.</P>
<P>There is a certain respect due to our ances∣tors and their customs; and, for my own part, I would never embrace new maxims or opi∣nions, but upon full conviction of their claim∣ing preference to old ones. Still it should be remembered, the mind was never designed for a state of slavery; therefore, when once our reason is truly convinced of former errors, let
<PB N="x" REF="024796_0009_0FC88EE8B893AC50"/>the sanction for such mistakes be never so re∣doubtable, there is a glorious freedom inhe∣rent in human nature, that prompts a generous mind to revoke erroneous opinions, and adopt those systems, which, upon mature delibera∣tion, shall appear more rational. And when∣ever the contrary disposition is discovered, it altogether shows a want of candour, and points out an obstinacy, not only culpable with re∣spect to our private characters, but deserving of censure, as it regards society; for such a temper tends to prohibit every kind of disco∣very, that may either improve our own know∣ledge, or benefit our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>All our knowledge with respect to infants, must be obtained from observation alone; as no one ever pretended to remember those sen∣sations and wants which he himself experien∣ced in the earliest part of childhood; therefore a careful attendance is required in the nurse∣ry. When infants are properly managed, there is but seldom an occasion for the help of me∣dicine: and should it be necessary to call in assistance of this land, as they are totally inca∣pable of relating their distress, it requires an accurate observation, together with a circum∣stantial account from the nurses who attend upon them, to enable a medical practitioner to form a right judgment of their diseases.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.
Of Marks—the imaginary consequences of frights and longings. A candid enquiry into the merits of this doctrine.</HEAD>
<P>PREJUDICES, which have been imbibed in our early days, received from those we esteem and reverence, and supported by the authority of past ages, must needs make im∣pressions upon the most candid and ingenuous minds; particularly when almost every day produces strange and wonderful stories to cor∣roborate the supposed fact.</P>
<P>The various blemishes frequently discover∣ed upon children at the birth, have been gene∣rally considered as the effect of a fright, or a disappointment of the mother's longings: and indeed this opinion has so far prevailed, that it has been, for a long time past, looked upon as incontestible. Should any one, therefore, pre∣sumptuously dare to deny this amazing pecu∣liarity in pregnant women, and the consequent effect upon the embryo, he must expect no∣thing less than the general censures of the fe∣male world. Besides, the many positive asser∣tions upon this head, from the most sensible
<PB N="12" REF="024796_0011_0FC88EF270F75AC8"/>persons of undoubted veracity, will naturally lead a prudent man to speak with caution against the doctrine. Nevertheless, it surely cannot be improper to make a candid enquiry into so wonderful a phenomenon.</P>
<P>It is a subject by far the most interesting to the ladies: it comes, indeed, particularly un∣der their cognizance; for the dreaded evil af∣fects the fair sex much more essentially than it does ours. With my female friends, there∣fore, I beg leave to discuss this important point.</P>
<P>It is by every one allowed, to the honour of this nation, (and let particular commendation be given to the daughters of Great-Britain themselves), that in the education of young women, letters, and the polite improvements, are much more attended to in this age than formerly; accomplishments which not only render their manners more engaging, but qua∣lify them likewise for the happy domestic life; and contribute much to adorn these amiable and sweetly-endearing companions of the so∣cial hour. How essentially necessary is such a friend, to make life comfortable and happy!</P>
<P>What a lustre does every good and accom∣plished woman add to the matrimonial state! —She must by every reasonable man be con∣sidred not only as the partner of his bed, but of his very soul.</P>
<P>I can at this readily call to mind many such exalted characters, to whom in a most particular manner I now address myself.—
<PB N="13" REF="024796_0012_0FC88EF4070AB048"/>women, whose enlarged minds are capable of a much greater depth of reasoning than these speculations will afford; and in whose compa∣ny I have oftentimes enjoyed the happiness of friendly conversation—with whom, upon dif∣ferent occasions, I have, in part, entered into the subject of this, and the following letters. It is, indeed, at the request of several of these my worthy female friends, that I have been induced to collect my thoughts, in order to deliver them to the public.</P>
<P>Ignorance, my fair readers, is the parent of credulity and superstition. Knowledge is the conqueror that triumphs over such terrible foes. How much is the understanding enlight∣ened and improved by the use of letters? When therefore we consider that the art of printing was not discovered until the fifteenth century, and it was a long time after that be∣fore it became universal in Europe, we shall not greatly wonder at the bigotry and rude∣ness of manners in our ancestors; and we shall cease to reflect upon those credolous times.</P>
<P>To the score of ignorance we are to place the many and hideous stories which have been formerly related of apparitions, goblins, and witches, that have at times infested different parts of Europe; and even in England have claimed the attention of civil and ecclesiastical power: instances of which are to be found in our history.</P>
<P>At this period I believe there are but few who give credit to such romances. The Spec∣tator
<PB N="14" REF="024796_0013_0FC88EF5916D0F40"/>and his cotemporaries pretty well clear∣ed the country of witches. As to ghosts, the last that made its appearance was the notori∣ous Fanny of Cock-lane; and this arch spirit was effectually laid, as it is called, in a court of justice; where the gentlemen of the law carefully collected her ashes, and, like alche∣mists, turned them into gold; so that there is no fear of any spirits rising from her urn.</P>
<P>We are now, my intelligent fair, fully con∣vinced of the ridiculous fallacy of such bug∣bears; and at this time there is scarcely a fe∣male but can enjoy, without one dreadful ap∣prehension, a cool and silent walk by moon∣light: a pleasure their mothers could hardly be persuaded to partake of; for, not longer than half a century ago, if a dauntless virgin had thus presumptuously ventured, the af∣frighted parents would have been apprehen∣sive for their daughter, lest she should, some time or another, be punished for such impious audacity.</P>
<P>Thus we see prodigies and wonders daily vanishing, in proportion as literary know∣ledge, and the general improvement of the understanding, are cultivated.</P>
<P>To some future season, perhaps, we must postpone the elucidation of marks, the suppo∣sed consequences of frights and longings: yet, if this matter should be a subject of dispute with the ladies for the present, I doubt not that a little time and candid observation will commit the very idea of such romantic opi∣nions,
<PB N="15" REF="024796_0014_0FC88EF998F43AB8"/>together with that of frights, and eve∣ry other superstitious error, to eternal obli∣vion.</P>
<P>A fright is generally believed to have the same unlucky effect upon pregnant women, as a disappointment of their wishes will pro∣duce. Hence they are perpetually racked be∣tween hope and fear, to the torment of them∣selves, and every body about them; and are sometimes so extravagant with regard to a wish or longings, as not to be satisfied but at an immense expense: for we have heard that these strange cravings are not altogether con∣fined to the palate; they sometimes extend themselves to equipage, jewels, dress, baubles, &amp;c. As a proof that such chimerical notions even at this time prevail, the reader is desired to attend to the following relation.</P>
<P>Since the first edition of this work went to the press, the author happened to dine, in company with a pregnant lady totally free from prejudice, at the house of an intimate female friend, who has a heart truly good and sympathetic. Her teeming visitor took notice of a toy; it was a pigeon-house made of Staf∣fordshire ware, and in a baby-house would appear a proper ornament: yet the forebo∣dings of this good matron, lest her friend should have entertained a longing for it, ope∣rated so strongly, that the kindly ordered it to be put into her visitor's carriage. The preg∣nant lady strongly objected to it indeed, but to no purpose; insomuch that she was obliged to take the pigeon-house home.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="024796_0015_0FC88EFFB53F7C28"/>But not to dwell upon such like particulars, which, nevertheless, have been frequently in∣troduced in support of whimsical desires, and which are continually magnified in the rela∣tion, we shall confine our remarks to the ge∣neral manner in which this magic operates.</P>
<P>As I have universally been thought an infidel in matters of this kind, the ladies have treated me accordingly; nay, frequently, when I have begged quarter, it has been cruelly de∣nied; which cautions me at this time to be modestly humble and diffident. I shall assert nothing; but by fair and impartial enquiry endeavour to search out the truth.</P>
<P>In consequence of my supposed want of faith in these affairs, there is scarcely a female I am acquainted with, who does not treasure up every surprising story of this kind that she hears, to tell it me with all the advantages that a persuasive tongue can give, in order to bring about my conversion.</P>
<P>I verily believe, that, by the assistance of these my good friends, I could furnish a large folio volume of such histories. It is a spacious field for the fancy to rove in. A variety of preternatural marks in living persons may be produced every day: nor can the existence of these extraordinary appearances be denied; for that is incontestible, as every one can vouch. The true cause of such wonders, therefore, is the subject of our pursuit.</P>
<P>In the first place, I shall make bold to de∣clare, that I never met with one of these ble∣mishes
<PB N="17" REF="024796_0016_0FC88F0099C01250"/>which altogether struck my fancy with respect even to the imaginary likeness; or which, as to the supposed cause, engaged my rational confidence.</P>
<P>I have been showed a mark that was com∣pared to the rhind of bacon, and told a strange story of the mother's longing for a gammon. I fancied it to be like the tinge of a mulatto, and congratulated the parents that the child was not altogether swarthy.</P>
<P>A lady of my acquaintance has oftentimes declared that she is marked with a perfect pig; but I never could obtain the sight of this rarity, it not being conveniently situated for public inspection. A little while ago, I was in company with her mother, an elderly woman, and quite a stout champion, as I found, for marks and blemishes, in consequence of frights and longings. Upon a particular enquiry, it appeared that she was unacquainted with the accident, until some considerable time after the birth; and then, from the appearance of the mark, she very well remembered the oc∣casion of it—which was this. When she was very near her time, her husband and self were invited to the house of a relation, living at some distance, who, she knew, had some very fine sucking pigs. They both thought the ride would be too much for her; but she recollects her having said, that she would go at all e∣vents, if she was sure they would dress one of the pigs for dinner. However, the husband went alone, and returned in the evening with
<PB N="18" REF="024796_0017_0FC88F022DF06428"/>a quarter of a pig that had been dressed on purpose for their dinner, her relation know∣ing she was fond of it. But alas! as her evil genius would have it, when she sat down to supper, she could eat but very little; and at that time unluckily rubbed the part with her hand, where her daughter is marked, which, she is very certain, occasioned the form of a pig. I asked her how the child could be mark∣ed, since she had her desire? No matter for that, answered she: though I had the pig, the child to be sure must be marked; because I longed for it nice and hot, with good plum sauce and gravy, but was obliged to eat it cold. We all laughed heartily at the conclusion, though, as the reader may judge, from differ∣ent motives; but the old lady thought she had obtained a complete victory.</P>
<P>I have given this little history, to show the absurd manner in which these things are usu∣ally accounted for. It will be also proper in this place to remark the notorious dissimilari∣ty between such blemishes and their supposed originals. We are to take notice, likewise, of the ease with which the fancy is imposed up∣on, or imposes on itself in such cases, even to infatuation; magnifying the most trifling con∣jectures into the strongest confirmations. How often do women rack their minds, to find out the origin of these marks! which evidently proceeds from their aversion to be thought capable of producing an offspring with any imperfections; and their servants and nurses,
<PB N="19" REF="024796_0018_0FC88F03A5167DD8"/>considering it actually as their business, are always ready to help them out upon these oc∣casions.</P>
<P>Fruit, wine, boiled lobsters, fresh salmon, and such like things of a red colour, are the most common marks; and there is scarcely a family in the kingdom, but some one or more of them can produce instances of this sort.</P>
<P>These strange effects, we are told, not only happen to the human race, but also, how wonderful to relate!—to brutes. There is a worthy family, whose veracity is not to be doubted, that are firmly persuaded of the fol∣lowing fact; of which they were all specta∣tors. I shall deliver the account, as nearly as possible, in the lady's words, who favoured me with the relation.</P>
<P>Her father's favourite cat happened to pro∣duce a kitten, which, to the surprise of all the family, was marked upon the back with a rat. As the kitten grew, the rat increased likewise; till, at the end of some months, it dropped off the kitten, quite perfect in its form;—and the lady had it in her own hand. I was question∣ed, very particularly, whether I could any longer doubt the consequences of longing and frights, since it even extended to brutes—for, continued she, what could be the cause of this, but the creature being disappointed of some rat she was pursuing?</P>
<P>Thus closely pressed, I begged her yet to pardon my want of belief. As to the cause, I was silent about it; that there was a substance
<PB N="20" REF="024796_0019_0FC88F08D7D53240"/>upon the kitten, which fell off, as related, I had no doubt.—What then could I doubt?— That their own imaginations deceived them.— How was that possible?—Much more so than they were aware of.—Where is the rat, ma∣dam?—Thrown away long ago.—That is un∣lucky; for, had I seen it, probably it might have struck me as resembling an owl, or some other thing altogether as extravagant. It was downright obstinacy in me; for I would not believe any thing. I further said, had it been a rat, I thought she would have wanted cou∣rage to touch it—even supposing it to be dead; and had it been alive, it would certain∣ly have run away, and prevented her. This pleasantry abated somewhat of the earnestness of our argument; and a laugh made us very good friends—but I was an incredulous man.</P>
<P>I have heard of a woman surprised in the street, when she was very near her time, by a person with a withered arm: upon her return home, the fright threw her into labour, and she was delivered of a child with a withered arm. How can we possibly believe such an immediate effect as this to be produced?— Is it to be credited, that the mother's terror should instantly blast the arm of the child, thus rendering it similar to the object of horror?</P>
<P>And if this be rejected, how can we allow the total loss of a limb from a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cause? —Could it be annihilated? This no one will assert. If not, supposing the effect to take place, and the arm of the keg should be sepa∣rated
<PB N="21" REF="024796_0020_0FC88F0C76F6DCA0"/>from the body, what becomes of it? Such divided part is never to be found upon these occasions. On the contrary, where there is an addition to the form, proceeding also, as we are told, from fright; such, for in∣stance, as a toe or finger extraordinary, an arm or a leg; in the name of wonder, from what source can those exuberances be so im∣mediately produced? Is it not astonishing, that such credulous infatuations should thus beguile our reason?</P>
<P>Not to trouble my fair readers with any more of these relations, which, by prejudiced persons, are accounted undeniable, I shall just mention a few facts for the consideration of the candid.</P>
<P>A lady of my particular acquaintance, du∣ring the time of her pregnancy, was unfortu∣nately overturned in a coach; by which acci∣dent, as she endeavoured to get out, the first joint of her second finger was entirely broken off. This was an alarming circumstance to all her friends, and the dreadful apprehensions of the child's being born a cripple disturbed eve∣ry one; but, to the great astonishment of her acquaintance, she was delivered of a fine and perfect boy.</P>
<P>An eminent practitioner relates a story to this effect, which is equally to be credited, as happening under his own observation.</P>
<P>A lady of quality being in convulsions, the family sent for the doctor in great haste. He found her upon the bed, extremely ill indeed.
<PB N="22" REF="024796_0021_0FC88F0E26E569A8"/>When her ladyship came a little to herself, she cried out, The black cat! the black cat! —her well-known particular aversion to this domestic animal seemed to point out the cause of the disaster, of which till now they were entirely ignorant; and the servants diligent∣ly searched for the object; when in a tub, placed to receive the rain-water near her lady∣ship's dressing-room window, poor puss was discovered.</P>
<P>This sight so terribly affected the lady, that her fears were ever uppermost, and she was miserable until the time of her delivery. Nei∣ther could her friends pacify her, nor the ar∣guments of so able a man bring her to reason. Notwithstanding all they could say, she was fully persuaded her child's face would be like this black cat's. At length Lucina smiled pro∣pitious on its birth; and her ladyship's appre∣hensions vanished, upon her being brought to bed of a lovely boy, without either mark or blemish.</P>
<P>Just about the same time, it happened that the same gentleman delivered another person of a boy also. The child had a small darkish spot upon the forehead. He was curious e∣nough to interrogate the mother about it, and she most ingenuously declared, that she was neither sensible of any fright or longing du∣ring; the whole time of her breeding.</P>
<P>Had this blemish happened to the child of the noble parent, the doctor truly observes, the black cat would undoubtedly have occa∣sioned a remarkable anecdote in the history of
<PB N="23" REF="024796_0022_0FC88F1070A24588"/>her ladyship's house;—for by all her family and friends it would have been looked upon as an incontestible proof of these prodigies; and, give me leave to add, with much more seeming plausibility, too, than the generality of these stories can boast; because the lady had declared her apprehensions at the time of the supposed injury.</P>
<P>I shall here add another instance of an ap∣prehension altogether as fruitless, as that of the noble lady. It was made known to me, in consequence of reading the above to a parti∣cular friend, who immediately replied, that he was under great anxiety for his wife, upon account of her being terrified at the sight of a person who had a very unhappy blemish on her face. The wife of this gentleman, by chance going to St. Paul's church, was placed in a stall exactly opposite to the unfortunate object, which affected her so much, that her devotion was entirely lost; and she talked of this poor woman continually after she left the church.</P>
<P>In a few weeks this lady went again to St. Paul's, and was unluckily placed opposite the same person; which so distressed her, that she dared not to venture there any more. Sure∣ly this is as striking an instance as we can suppose. I told my friend I was glad he ac∣quainted me of it before his wife was brought to bed, and that I should pay great attention to the consequence; but at the same time de∣sired he would endeavour to make both him∣self
<PB N="24" REF="024796_0023_0FC88F12A632FDE0"/>and wife very easy, assuring him, on the observation of myself and others, how little room there was to be under any dismal appre∣hension on this account. To finish the story, his wife was soon after delivered of a fine and perfect child. Since which, this lady has de∣clared her apprehensions so terrified her, that she dared not to look at the child, till she col∣lected from the conversation of her attend∣ants, that the boy's face was free from ble∣mish. What a cruel suspense and painful suf∣ferance must this have been to a mother!</P>
<P>Not long ago I was in the chamber of a la∣dy newly delivered: her mother being pre∣sent, took me to the window, and in great dis∣tress acquainted me the child had a large mark upon the right side of its face; that she was terrified at the thoughts of breaking it to her daughter, and begged me to acquaint her of it. Accordingly, after congratulating the good lady in the straw, upon her own health and a fine baby, in the course of conversation, I jocosely told her that we were at a loss to ac∣count for a pretty spot upon the child's face, and must desire her to inform us of the occa∣sion of it. After a very minute recollection, she frankly confessed she did not remember any one thing that she longed for during her pregnancy, neither could she any how account for the accident.</P>
<P>A variety of other circumstances might be enumerated, to discredit, though many stories are related to confirm, this wonderful affair.
<PB N="25" REF="024796_0024_0FC88F14D792C658"/>I shall not, however, introduce further parti∣culars, though divers have happened within my notice; but conclude this letter with re∣marking, that in every instance before rela∣ted, where the misfortune of a blemish was apprehended, it did not happen; and in the other cases, where marks appeared, they were entirely unexpected, and the cause of them totally unknown to the mothers; which, I may venture to say, has always been the case. If, therefore, women would wish to be cre∣dited in these stories of frights and longings, let them declare, before they are delivered, like the two ladies mentioned in this letter, that they have marked the child, and make known the cause of it. Nothing less can prove this fact; and, till then, even the possibility of it may very reasonably be doubted; for sure∣ly we may conclude that so remarkable an ef∣fect of sympathy can never take place, with∣out the immediate and most certain know∣ledge of the mother.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.
Of Marks—showing that such blemishes may happen in∣dependently of the mother's imagination.</HEAD>
<P>AS to longings, I doubt not but every per∣son must have been sensible of such inclinations. I can answer for myself, that, when indisposed, and my stomach rather weak, I have many times suffered not a little, in being disappointed of a thing that seemed particularly to strike my fancy: surely I may be allowed to say, that the prejudices of fe∣male education are likely to encourage such inclinations to a much greater degree in preg∣nant women, whose appetites are usually weak and fanciful; and, as it is the case in every passion when too extravagantly indulged, I take it for granted, ladies may be sometimes very much hurt by such a disappointment, in∣dependently of superstitious, tormenting ap∣prehensions.</P>
<P>I would wish to arm every female breast with the resolution necessary for her own hap∣piness. Yet I do not deny but upon a thousand occasions the ladies suffer, unavoidably as it
<PB N="28" REF="024796_0026_0FC88F1C00301880"/>were, from fear; and materially so in the pre∣sent instance.</P>
<P>Women, from the delicacy of their frame, and the particular mode of education in polite countries, are, without doubt, much more un∣der the dominion of fear than men, who are continually spurred on by custom and vigour to exert their courage. This renders a variety of objects, although terrible to the fair sex, so familiar to ours, that contempt alone is often∣times a security against many such horrible intruders.</P>
<P>We confess, then, that women are exceed∣ingly subject to fear: it is also granted, that, in things they long for, they may be painful∣ly disappointed. It is not denied but that there are oftentimes very extraordinary appearan∣ces at the birth, which the fancy likens to a variety of things; but it does not therefore follow, that we are bound to believe such marks or blemishes to be the effect of fright, or the consequences of a parent's disappoint∣ment.</P>
<P>In the first letter, we gave several relations on both sides of the question: I shall now beg leave to propose a few queries, which, if al∣lowed, in my opinion, seem in part to account for these extraordinary appearances; and what cannot be illustrated upon a rational en∣quiry, why may we not suppose to proceed from hidden, accidental causes in the opera∣tions of nature? Since excrescences upon trees, plants, and indeed blemishes on almost
<PB N="29" REF="024796_0027_0FC88F1DE46C0538"/>every kind of animals, (of which daily expe∣rience will convince a common observer), seem strongly to authorise such a conjecture; I say, why may we not suppose this to be the true reason, without the assistance of a won∣der-working imagination?</P>
<P>Will not an inflammation upon the eye fre∣quently produce an universal redness over that part which otherwise appears beautifully white?</P>
<P>What is the cause of this surprising altera∣tion?</P>
<P>Must not there ever have been a fluid circu∣lating in those tender vessels?—And must not that fluid be necessarily limpid?</P>
<P>Are not those vessels, therefore, unless in∣jured, too small to admit the sanguinary fluid in its compact and red state?</P>
<P>And does it not evidently appear, that they must be considerably distended, before the red blood can be admitted, which denotes this in∣flammation?</P>
<P>Save where the virgin blush brings the blood into the cheek, or the rosy-coloured nymph rivals our courtly beauties;—does not the whiteness of the skin, in almost every part of the body, plainly show that its vessels equal∣ly deny the admission of this red fluid?</P>
<P>We are told, by curious enquirers, that, for several months after conception, the embryo receives its support from a lympid fluid, and that the form itself is nearly limpid, or co∣lourless.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="024796_0028_0FC88F20511F9738"/>If so, are not the vessels of an unborn child, as it arrives nearer to the birth, gradually en∣larged, so as in the proper parts to give ad∣mission to this red sanguinary fluid?</P>
<P>May not therefore some accidental pressure upon a pregnant woman—the violence of a sudden jolt—or the shock received by a false step or a fall, with a variety of other casual∣ties, convey such an injury to the tender em∣bryo, as upon some part of the skin to occasion a similar effect to that of the eye?</P>
<P>Do we not oftentimes observe inflamma∣tions in the eye to be in a manner habitual?</P>
<P>Why may we not then suppose these deli∣cate vessels, when thus distended, to be so op∣pressed by the particles of the fluid which rush into them, as never more to be able to reco∣ver their natural size?</P>
<P>Hence these parts, and these parts only, giving admission to the red blood—is it not probable that they may assume the various forms, which in various infants are imagined to resemble so many different things?</P>
<P>The cure of the before-mentioned inflam∣mation of the eye frequently depends, not up∣on bleeding, but upon constringing the vessels, and restoring them to their original state, so that they again only admit their proper limpid fluids; and perhaps, if astringent applications were used at the birth, where a strong pressure could be made upon the particular part, many of these blemishes might in a great measure, if not altogether, be removed.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="024796_0029_0FC88F219FEA9010"/>Such are our conjectures on the cause of those marks which are totally of, or approach∣ing to, a red colour. But there are other ble∣mishes, which, at first sight, my readers may take for granted cannot be accounted for by this way of reasoning; such, for instance, as appear to be of a light and dark brown, of a chocolate and black colour. Nevertheless, my fair friends, permit us candidly to pro∣ceed.</P>
<P>A blow sometimes stains the skin yellow; if the part be much bruised, the tinge is deeper, and frequently turns quite black. A curious observed must have noticed, in those persons who from violent blows have received such contusions as are vulgarly called black eyes, that the skin, before it returns to its natural colour, assumes a great variety of different hues; all proceeding from the same first cause. Is it not then probable, that some such accident happening to an unborn child, may produce a similar effect? This perhaps will be allowed: but then why should such blemishes continue in children, since they usually disappear in the case before mentioned? However, to proceed in the enquiry: Such effects being admitted, their permanency then is the difficulty to be overcome. Let us consider, that, although in mature life the constitution has generally strength sufficient to repel most accidents, not instantly mortal, yet in childhood, and old-age, the powers of the body are overcome by very slight injuries. In the meridian of life,
<PB N="32" REF="024796_0030_0FC88F288C207A18"/>those parts of the body, which are disfigured by accidents, most commonly recover them∣selves; nevertheless many instances are to be produced, even in adults, where the skin con∣tinues discoloured. Bruises and other injuries upon the shins, particularly in feeble constitu∣tions, frequently occasion marks that never disappear. The same is likewise observed upon the legs of those who are accustomed to sit too near fire, in which case we say they have burnt their skins; and old sores ge∣nerally leave such marks. I have seen many of these lasting blemishes. My readers proba∣bly recollect the fact, and also that such inju∣red parts assume a variety of colours; black, red, brown, motley, &amp;c. much resembling those which are supposed to proceed from the force of imagination.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, we find such like appear∣ances are sometimes permanent in the differ∣ent periods of life, what can be said to dis∣prove their continuance in infants, when sup∣posed to happen either before or at the time of delivery? For surely we may conclude, the more delicate the form is, it will prove the more susceptible of injuries, and those in∣juries will last the longer; the tender vessels in such cases not being so able to recover themselves. And as we often find it to be so in the feebleness of age, and in a variety of other instances—why may we not in the tender embryo also suppose these blemishes some∣times to remain, and be durable?</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="024796_0031_0FC88F2AE6D3B280"/>But if you think the above reasoning not sufficently plausible, let us consider the differ∣ence of complexion in different persons of this country—but principally the different colours of Europeans and Africans: and since we find appearances so diametrically opposite in the skins of persons, why may not the same con∣trast in some measure take place in the skin of one and the same person, through a kind of error in nature from her intended scope?</P>
<P>Nay, do not those blemishes called frec∣kles, and more especially moles, which fre∣quently make their first appearance in advan∣ced life, and are often covered with hairs—I say, do not these, with the common excrescen∣ces of warts, &amp;c. show us how easily most of the different colours and appearances may be produced at any age? And though the cause of these is full as little known as the matter under present consideration, was the effect ever deemed miraculous?</P>
<P>Now is it to be wondered at, if these sport∣ings of nature should bear a resemblance to some or other of the vast variety of objects in the animal or vegetable creation?</P>
<P>Or in fact, if they bear no such real resem∣blance, cannot the imagination readily sup∣pose they do; in like manner as, when look∣ing upon the clouds, we easily descern men, horses, trees, forests, flocks of sheep, armies, and indeed every thing which the most fruit∣ful invention can form?</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="024796_0032_0FC88F2C1EE9AA70"/>Some further rational conjectures might be added; but they would probably in this place be considered as too technical for the generali∣ty of my readers: I shall, therefore, wave them at present; for I think there has been already enough said upon this subject, to check at least, if not entirely to subdue, these reigning infatuations.</P>
<P>Now if the doctrine of marks, in conse∣quence of frights and longings, should prove to be nothing more than prejudice, ladies will avoid the continual distress which in these cir∣cumstance they labour under; for sorry I am to say it, but at present it seems as fashionable to cultivate such dispositions in young mar∣ried women, as to recommend matrimony it∣self.</P>
<P>On the other hand, supposing all that has been advanced should prove to be chimerical; the removing of the apprehension, by which I mean the foreboding fears of the mother, will be to remove the greatest part of the evil: and surely it is time enough at the birth to discern an imperfection. This, indeed, is a point which the strongest advocates for the force of imagination must not only allow, but likewise approve of its tendency; since for∣titude is the only preventive, according to their favourite system, against the miserable consequences of frights, and disappointed longings: for if such a degree of courage can be obtained, as will prevent fear, and such a degree of resolution maintained, as will pre∣vent
<PB N="35" REF="024796_0033_0FC88F2D998946F8"/>the mind being hurt, upon any casual disappointment of the inclination, the evil it∣self is at once remedied; because the imagi∣nation will never painfully dwell either upon objects of disgust or inclination; and conse∣quently blemishes can never happen from such causes.</P>
<P>I trust that my attentive and intelligent rea∣ders will not be displeased with the discussion of this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> interesting subject.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.
OF MISCARRIAGES.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now, my delicate fair ones, en∣tering upon a subject which requires some circumspection, to divide the province of the physician from the advice of a friend.</P>
<P>There are undoubtedly constitutional er∣rors, which oftentimes prevent women from becoming joyful mothers; and they may be hindered also by accidental circumstances. Both these considerations, however, belong to the physician. In a word, therefore, these directions do not extend to such remote cau∣ses; my counsels at present being designed to assist you in your own sphere.</P>
<P>The desire of children is evidently predo∣minant in almost every female disposition: it must be certainly owing to the wise ordination of Providence, that their education is so ad∣mirably calculated to encourage this fondness. How engaging are the childish amusements of a daughter!—Let us picture an innocent little girl fondly caressing a waxen image, dressing
<PB N="38" REF="024796_0035_0FC88F36E6E4B9E0"/>and undressing it with all the pomp and impor∣tance of a tender mother. What a delightful employment!—how amiable does the child herself appear!—and so endearing is this fe∣male province, that it is justly remarked to grow up with the sex into life.</P>
<P>I have, with inexpressible pleasure, seen many young ladies, women grown, happily amusing themselves at their younger sister's baby-house, and often discovered a crimson blush, that genuine mark of female modesty, arising from their being somewhat confused in suffering themselves to be thus unexpectedly surprised.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, some persons who have declared an aversion to children. I have pain∣fully suffered from the enumeration of the difficulties and inconveniences which they de∣scribe parents to labour under, who have the care of a little family.—Selfish and unsocial considerations!</P>
<P>God has universally manifested, that the whole human race are dependent upon one another; and those persons, who think and act thus narrowly, can neither be accounted good characters in themselves, nor worthy members with respect to society. But, alas! they are strangers to the feelings of parental fondness.</P>
<P>Certain I am, ye amiable wives, that, if it be your good fortune to become happy mo∣thers, your children, those dear pledges of love, if prudently educated, prove not only
<PB N="39" REF="024796_0036_0FC88F381DB243B0"/>an engaging comfort to yourselves, but a great and lasting security for the affections of your husbands. Trust me, there is a time when the charms of beauty must cease, and the passions of youth bend, to the majesty of wisdom:— 'tis then good-nature and good-sense, with that essential ingredient, a cheerful disposi∣tion, will in a great measure secure your con∣quest; and a charming offspring will assuredly contribute to unite parents in the lasting bonds of friendship.</P>
<P>How desirable, therefore, are children! Even poverty itself does not prevent the san∣guine wish for them. Let us then endeavour to promote their safe and happy increase.</P>
<P>The difference of constitution in women is an important affair: there are some who upon every trifling occasion are subject to miscar∣riages—others, again, who, in spite of the most direct and powerful means, are often compelled to bear the token of unwarrantable amours; and there are instances even of mar∣ried women, who, not supposing themselves to be breeding, have been treated in the most likely manner to bring about an abortion—but all in vain. A remarkable story of this kind occurs to my memory, which I relate from my own knowledge.</P>
<P>An honest labouring man and his wife lived together many years without having children; and they were both beyond the meridian of life, when the poor woman was supposed to be afflicted with a dropsy. From time to time
<PB N="40" REF="024796_0037_0FC88F3A57CEF0B0"/>she advised with several eminent physicians, who, from her appearance and the account she gave, treated her as dropsical; administering the most powerful remedies against that dis∣order.</P>
<P>At length she grew so very big, that all hopes of a cure were given over, and the operation of tapping was recommended. The husband's circumstances being narrow, and the expense of this illness putting it out of his power to employ a surgeon, the poor woman was advi∣sed to go into the hospital: this, however, she refused.</P>
<P>A week or two after this, the husband call∣ed, with a most joyful countenance, to inform me his wife was brought to bed, and that both the mother and child were likely to do well. I was at that time very young; but my re∣flexions upon the oddity of the event deter∣mined me to be always wary in the examina∣tion of dropsical female patients.</P>
<P>Thus we see in this woman, and in a variety of other cases, where impious efforts have been used to promote a miscarriage, that na∣ture, in spite of great violence, sometimes will not be interrupted.</P>
<P>Let us then aim at assisting her in this great work, where the constitution appears not able to go through with it; and point out the most rational means to prevent abortion.</P>
<P>Our first letter, over and above the enqui∣ry concerning marks, longings, and frights, greatly tends to this material end. Women of
<PB N="41" REF="024796_0038_0FC88F429D089E00"/>a delicate form, and too great sensibility, are the most liable to miscarry: such also are the most likely to imbibe, and to be affected by, the prejudices we there wished to caution them against. The power of fear is undoubt∣edly sovereign over most persons; and this, as it frequently occasions miscarriages, is tru∣ly to be dreaded. If, therefore, the prejudices were discountenanced, the unhappy fear itself would assuredly cease.</P>
<P>And further, there is nothing tends more to render life happy, either to men or women, than to conquer, as much as possible, the pas∣sion of fear. This is the monster, which in some degree subdues us all, and too frequent∣ly makes mankind miserable. There is no ca∣lamity but would easily become supportable, could we divest ourselves of fear; and daily experience proves women to be most subject to its tortures. How many trifling insects, that a man continually spurns from him, ruffle the breast of females, and throw them into the greatest agonies!</P>
<P>The evil, therefore, is seated in the imagi∣nation; for it is the dreadful apprehension of their own mind that torments them; which, by a firm and steady resolution, may general∣ly be overcome. Fortitude is an inestimable jewel.</P>
<P>However difficult the task appears, the ear∣liest and strongest prejudices may commonly be conquered. I am sensible, that sometimes it will require great pains, and never can be
<PB N="42" REF="024796_0039_0FC88F44196EBE00"/>done but by the strength of reason. Would you, my too susceptible fair, follow my ad∣vice on this subject, a thousand accidents might be avoided that hourly happen to you upon this, and many other occasions.</P>
<P>Reason was bestowed upon us, both for the preservation of our health, and the promo∣tion of our happiness. The abuse of it as ne∣cessarily destroys the one as the other.</P>
<P>How do we continually reflect upon our∣selves for inconveniencies, mental as well as corporeal, that arise from inconsiderateness and folly? Believe me, ladies, miscarriages are frequently brought about by imprudence. When a wife has the pleasing prospect of be∣coming a mother, it is no longer a time to be revelling in midnight assemblies. Such a con∣duct not only deprives her of natural rest, but also endangers her health, and thereby often∣times promotes this dreaded evil.</P>
<P>In this and every other point, I beg leave to caution you against falling into wide ex∣tremes. Some ladies I have seen madly run∣ning up and down, and jumbling all the town over in the most jolting hackney-coach that could be procured; and, although at the same time they complain of being shaken to pieces, yet this they say is to prevent the accident.— Others never step out of doors, nay, nor so much as go up and down a pair of stairs, for several months: this also is to avoid the dan∣ger.</P>
<P>Again let me warn you of both extremes.
<PB N="43" REF="024796_0040_0FC88F459A7452D8"/>Be this your guide—whatever exercise you are capable of taking without fatigue, in∣dulge—but no more. Never, in this point, regard the example of others. Because your friend can do this and that, it is no reason you should; and if the attempt gives pain, it should certainly be avoided.</P>
<P>I need not caution the present age against the pernicious custom of lacing too tightly; for a lass of fifteen, in the dress of our times, would in the last age have been supposed to be just at down-lying.</P>
<P>I do not mean to condemn, but to praise the ladies for giving themselves room in the waist: nevertheless extremes, you know, are not advised. There is a certain medium in every part of life, which is the <HI>je-ne-sais-quoi</HI> that constitutes the agreeable.</P>
<P>It is as uncommon now to see a young girl crooked, as it formerly was to see one perfect∣ly straight. I believe no one denies that their shapes were greatly injured by the stiffness of their stays, and by being laced so exceedingly close. This pernicious custom was frequently the cause of a bad state of health, and threw many young women into consumptions. We now rarely see ladies fainting in public places: but when they did not allow themselves room to breathe, it happened every day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be hoped the ladies will not again lace themselves up, to display fine shapes; the Author, how∣ever, wishes to warn them against so pernicious a fash∣ion.</NOTE> This
<PB N="44" REF="024796_0041_0FC88F471A599EE8"/>prudent alteration, therefore, so serviceable to maidens, is still more necessary for married women.</P>
<P>There is another caution at this time to be observed. I have frequently beheld, with pain, divers ladies too apt to be lifting and playing with heavy children: there are certain sym∣pathetic emotions, altogether natural and laudable, which prompt them to it; and far be it from my thoughts to deprive them of so tender and generous a gratification: neverthe∣less, to see a delicate little form, very near her time, stop a bouncing boy, and catch him in her arms, is really an alarming sight: many miscarriages happen from such inconsiderate∣ness; and, if our conjectures are not wrong, many blemishes also by these means are pro∣bably occasioned.</P>
<P>But there is a practice indiscriminately used even to this day, worse than all the rest; and that is bleeding. Whether a woman be robust or weakly, if she is pregnant, she must be bled. Has she any pains? No matter.—Is she in health? Yes.—But she must lose blood.— Why? Because she is with child. Her mother always did it, and her grandmother, aye, and her great great grandmother too, time out of mind; and therefore can the propriety of it be doubted?—These are the general argu∣ments used by women in favour of bleeding, when they are in perfect health: but if any slight indisposition happens, be it ever so fo∣reign to their particular situations, and which
<PB N="45" REF="024796_0042_0FC88F49DE96B810"/>perhaps at another time would pass unnoticed, dreadful consequences are apprehended, if they are not bled: nay, indeed, those little temporary inconveniencies which generally and unavoidably attend advanced pregnancy, in their mistaken opinions, call aloud for bleeding.</P>
<P>In our two former letters, we took notice of the difficulty that attends rooting out fixed and prevailing prejudices; and I am appre∣hensive that this is as deeply seated in the minds of women, as those of which we there treated. However, let us ask the assistance of reason also in this particular, and search a lit∣tle into the merits of the custom.</P>
<P>Is not the infant supported by the mother?</P>
<P>When there are two to be supported, is not more nourishment required than for one of them only?</P>
<P>Is this then a time, without a real necessity, to sport with the blood of a weakly and deli∣cate woman? No, surely.</P>
<P>Let me therefore beg of you, my ingenuous friends, to consider this matter in a rational light. I have given a plain and easy clue to pursue the enquiry; and the subject will not permit me to enter more fully into it with my fair readers, without assuming the character of the physician, and without advancing those things, which may, in this collection of let∣ters, be considered as an affront to delicacy.</P>
<P>To your own thoughts then I commit it; and will conclude this letter with saying, that,
<PB N="46" REF="024796_0043_0FC88F5010F69B08"/>though I do not deny but there are cases which require bleeding, yet I caution you against doing it at random, and, indeed, with∣out very good advice: at the same time, I firmly believe such instances rarely happen to those who are not of a robust constitution, and am fully persuaded that many women are daily injured by this wrong practice.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.
Mothers milk—the natural and best food for infants.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE endeavoured to set forth the ridi∣culousness of women terrifying them∣selves, and every body about them, during their pregnancy, with evils that most proba∣bly are altogether imaginary. I would wish my female readers to consider this subject in a more extensive view, and to aim at greater fortitude than the sex can generally boast, in the common occurrences of life; when the tenderness of men is not so much engaged, and when the ladies cannot reasonably expect such kind allowances as are made at this par∣ticular time. Think me not severe; a faith∣ful monitor must speak with freedom; the man who is blind to this foible, must be insen∣sible to your charms, and unworthy of your confidence. Your happiness is at stake, much more so than a superficial observer may ima∣gine. Female vivacity softens the rugged paths of life; and, believe me, self-love operates powerfully even upon the most generous
<PB N="48" REF="024796_0045_0FC88F532858D3B0"/>minds. The woman who indulges gloomy ideas—who is continually brooding over me∣lancholy—who, in her hours of domestic re∣tirement, is perpetually rendering herself mi∣serable, and her most intimate acquaintance, and dearest relatives, unhappy—such a mista∣ken SHE must only expect the cold eye of pi∣ty. However powerful her personal attrac∣tions, she will ultimately banish her husband and her friends. It will be found her greatest misfortune, and at a time too when it is irre∣trievable, to have once had the merit to gain, <HI>perhaps,</HI> a valuable heart, when she has not discretion enough to keep it.—The impor∣tance of the subject will, I hope, apologize for this digression.</P>
<P>We have also earnestly laboured to con∣quer the prejudices concerning marks, in con∣sequence of frights and longings; and have ex∣posed the fabulous histories of those wonders. We have likewise shown how the understand∣ing may be deceived by the forms of fancy; and have no less earnestly endeavoured to ex∣plode the mistaken custom of bleeding indis∣criminately, during pregnancy—pointing out, upon rational principles, the absurdity of all. A task equally arduous in every part; a thou∣sand prejudices being imbibed against the whole.</P>
<P>Another subject at this time presents itself to view—I mean that of women suckling their own children; against which the present ob∣stinately received opinions are still more un∣accountable
<PB N="49" REF="024796_0046_0FC88F5561C877D0"/>than the former; as nothing but a strange perversion of human nature could first deprive children of their mother's milk. Give me leave therefore to observe, that milk is the natural support which the great Author of our being has provided for our infant state; and I am heartily sorry the present manner of bringing up children puts me, in some mea∣sure, under the necessity of proving milk to be the best food that can be given them.</P>
<P>Milk is a nourishment produced from the various kinds of food taken in by the mother. Her stomach breaks and digests the aliment, which, after various operations of nature, be∣comes so far animalized as to be a kind of white blood; from whence animal bodies at all times receive their constant support and recruit. This therefore being admitted—un∣til an infant's powers are sufficiently strength∣ened to perform so great a business as that of digestion, the mother, by the all-wise appoint∣ment of Providence, from her own breast supplies it with the means of life. Hence no other nourishment appears so proper for a new-born child.</P>
<P>For the farther information and satisfaction of my female readers, and to convince them that milk is the most proper nourishment for tender infants, I think it will not be improper to give a concise account of the manner in which grown persons receive their constant recruit and support from their daily food.</P>
<P>Whether it be animal or vegetable diet, or
<PB N="50" REF="024796_0047_0FC88F59297E44C8"/>a mixture of both, taken into the stomach, the quality of the food is so far altered by the digestive faculties that a milky nutriment is produced from it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>passes through the bowels, the milk is taken up by a great number of fine vessels, which, from their destined office, are called the milky ves∣sels; and through them it is conveyed into the blood for our support: and, as before ob∣served, nature has so admirably contrived the animal fabric, that mothers are likewise ena∣bled to support their young from this constant supply, which at the same time also affords to themselves their own proper nourishment.</P>
<P>This is the grand scheme of nutriment: for, when these particles of our food, which af∣ford us sustenance, are thus taken up by the milky vessels, the grosser parts are, by the same wonderful construction of the bowels, rejected and evacuated, in a manner well known to every one.</P>
<P>Whoever, therefore, gives this argument a rational consideration, will, I trust, be led to acknowledge milk to be not only the natural, but the best and most strengthening nourish∣ment that infants can possibly receive; because their digestive faculties are, at this time, inca∣pable of producing a good and proper milky nutriment from any kind of food which can be given to them.</P>
<P>The Author of Nature has universally com∣mitted the support of infants, and the early part of children's education, to women; if it
<PB N="51" REF="024796_0048_0FC88F5B599894F0"/>were not thus ordained, he would undoubt∣edly have furnished men also with milk for the nourishment of their young; and experi∣ence convinces us, that women are much bet∣ter qualified both by nature and custom for this important concern. This system of nurs∣ing, therefore, is peculiarly addressed to the fair sex, who are most interested in it, and who will most sensibly feel the happy or miserable effects of the manner in which they discharge this first great trust which is reposed in them. — Here, indeed, a mother will assuredly reap the happy fruits of fortitude, and those likewise of a lively, cheerful and obliging disposition. This subject will be treated at large in the twelfth letter; nevertheless, give me leave to observe, in this place, that such as the mother is, generally speaking, such will be the first, and most probably the most dura∣ble impressions received by the child. It there∣fore naturally follows, that infants, whose minds are early accustomed to agreeable ob∣jects, and whose expanding ideas are gratified with pleasing sensations, unabated by flavish fears—such, and such only, as they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into life, will possess that generous gratitude, which prompts them to consider it as a first great duty to contribute to the happiness of their parents.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly offended, whenever I ob∣serve a child, grown to man or woman's estate, who shows, upon any occasion, a want of re∣spect or duty to its parents; and more parti∣cularly
<PB N="52" REF="024796_0049_0FC88F5D97D66AC0"/>so, if such slight or contempt be exer∣cised towards a good mother. Unnatural monster! to be wanting in respect to her who bore him in her womb—who cherished and supported him with her milk—and for many years after his birth gave up her own pleasures and recreations entirely for his sake—and who had no cares but for his welfare. I would have a mark set upon the forehead of such a barbarous savage; and he should be hunted from the society of men.</P>
<P>Those mothers, who by a foolish indul∣gence spoil their children's tempers and dispositions, are undoubtedly culpable; but the example of a violent, passionate, yet negligent and insensible father, is equally or more to be dreaded. A mother has this plea, that she en∣deavours at least at the time to make her child happy; and it may be said, in excuse for her conduct, that she is to be pitied in not know∣ing better: but there is no excuse, either to God or man, that can be urged to mitigate the vice and folly of such a father: the ini∣quity resteth with himself alone; for the be∣nevolent Author of our being is not to be ar∣raigned upon this or any other occasion.</P>
<P>How provident is nature in all her works! How wonderfully indulgent to man, and o∣ther helpless animals, in their first state of existence, by thus enabling the mother to feed her young with nourishment drawn from her own body, until such time as the offspring has obtained strength sufficient to provide for it∣self!
<PB N="53" REF="024796_0050_0FC88F600FCCFBA0"/>This gracious bounty is abused only by man, the most intelligent of earthly beings; whose misuse of reason leads him astray, whilst humble instinct directs all other parts of the creation aright.</P>
<P>If we look around us, we shall find every animal that gives suck, carefully fostering her young: and other enjoyments are no more thought of, until they are capable of provi∣ding for themselves. An example by which mankind might profit much: but the strong impulse of passion, in this and many other in∣stances, subdues our reason. Did we consider the benefit of our children more, and the in∣dulgence of our selfish inclinations less, the race of man would be more healthy, strong, and vigorous, than we can at present boast. But, alas! such is the depravity of human na∣ture, that it would be in vain to enlarge upon this topic of complaint; it is therefore our present business to prevent, as much as possi∣ble, the future growth of these evils.</P>
<P>Let us, my friends, as you are all interested in the enquiry, compare the success of mankind with that of the other animals in rearing their young. A little observation will convince us, that greater numbers of the human race are lost in their infancy, than of any other species; for near one half the deaths, within our bills of mortality, happen to children under five years of age. And further, compare the opu∣lent with the rustic, the success is still exceed∣ingly different. How many children of the
<PB N="54" REF="024796_0051_0FC88F6161CB1B98"/>great fall victims to prevailing customs, the effects of riches! How many of the poor are saved by wanting these luxuries!</P>
<P>Again, compare the success of such as suc∣kle their own offspring, with that of those who commit them to the care of nurses, or bring them up by hand; and we shall there likewise find an amazing difference: but more of this hereafter.</P>
<P>From these considerations, it is evident, that Nature is always preferable to art; whence the brute creation succeed better than the human, in preserving their own species. And the peasant, whom necessity compels to follow nature, is, in this respect, happier than his lord. Those mothers also, who, in spite of custom, pride, or indolence, will take their little babies to their breast, must have more comfort and success, than those who cruelly consign them to the care of foster nurses; thereby denying them that food, which is not only the most proper, but is ordained like∣wise for their infant state.</P>
<P>Let me then intreat those who are desirous of rearing their children, not to rob them of their natural breast. Would they wish them to be healthy and beautiful, let such mothers give suck: for even wet nurses, we shall find, are very little to be depended upon.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.
Arguments in favour of suckling—as well for the mo∣ther's sake, as the child's—and the evils to be appre∣hended in delivering children to the care of foster nurses.</HEAD>
<P>HEALTH and beauty are desirable, and the latter in particular, to women. They must, in this case, be united; as it is impos∣sible for a woman to be truly beautiful who wants health. Disease blights the rosy bloom upon the cheek, turns the delicate whiteness of the skin into a sallow hue, and destroys the enchanting lustre of the eye. How insufficient is it for a lovely maid to make a conquest, if she cannot keep it, as a wife!</P>
<P>It is not at present my province to enlarge upon the accomplishments of the mind. How necessary they are to secure the affections of a husband, every prudent woman knows: and she must be equally sensible, that the elegance of her person is also to be regarded; an ad∣vantage which those who are in a bad state of health have scarcely spirits to attend to: be∣sides, illness too often renders the sweetest dispositions cross and peevish.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="024796_0053_0FC88F65DB2A21D0"/>Those who are happy enough to have chil∣dren, run the greatest risk, not only of losing them, but of destroying their own health and beauty, by repelling their milk immediately after delivery. It never can be done without producing a fever. Oftentimes tumours, and cancers in the breast, owe their origin to this pernicious custom; asthmatical complaints, and lingering diseases, are frequently occa∣sioned by it; and too commonly, the immedi∣ate death of the mother follows from such ill management.</P>
<P>Consider, my fair pupils, for your own health's sake, and for the sake of your future happiness, how necessary it is to preserve such dear pledges of mutual love. By these power∣ful ties, many a man, in spite of impetuous passions, is compelled to continue the pru∣dent, kind, indulgent, tender husband. Did you but thoroughly know the secret impulses of the human heart, you would not risk the loss of your children, by unnaturally denying them the means of life.</P>
<P>Let not the mistaken husband insinuate, that you will be less charming in his sight, by do∣ing your duty to your little ones: many— many instances have I known, of weakly and delicate women, who, at my particular re∣quest, have suckled their children, and there∣by obtained a much better state of health; nay, they have been more pleasing in their persons, after thus becoming happy mothers; and their husbands have, with pleasure, ac∣knowledged their improved charms.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="024796_0054_0FC88F6E560947F8"/>There may be some cases in which it is not prudent for a mother to give suck; but these instances very rarely happen: and there may be some women, who, although they are ever so desirous, cannot suckle; this, however, is but seldom to be urged. I sincerely sympa∣thise with those unfortunate ladies, who are thus deprived of a happiness, only known to those who enjoy it. What shall we say under these necessitous circumstances? Shall we ad∣vise such mothers to employ a wet-nurse; or to bring their children up under their own management, according to proper rules which shall be laid down in a following letter? They are both, in my opinion, wretched necessities. Yet, was an infant of my own thus unhappily situated, without hesitation I would prefer the latter; for much is to be apprehended from a child's sucking a strange woman: nothing less than absolute necessity would make me comply with it.</P>
<P>Too often diseases, and those of the worst kind, are imbibed from the breast. It is a shocking truth, but vicious inconstancy is be∣come so universal, even among the lower rank of people, that many women offer them∣selves, and are daily employed as wet-nurses, who are labouring under dreadful and infec∣tious diseases. Yet, supposing you can arrive at a satisfactory assurance in this point, there is a certain cleansing quality in the milk of a woman immediately after child-bearing, ex∣ceedingly necessary for the new-born babe, in
<PB N="58" REF="024796_0055_0FC88F6F99AC3C30"/>order to prepare its stomach and bowels for future food: this you very rarely can obtain from a wet-nurse.</P>
<P>There is yet a further evil to be dreaded: as it is through necessity alone that a woman will desert her own infant, and take another to her breast, she may be induced, by the ad∣vantage she gains, to conceal her being again with child, and continue to suckle the infant, till it pines away and dies, for want of proper nourishment. Thousands have been sacrificed by these means. Should they, however, es∣cape, in either case they are, too generally, miserable beings: for, in consequence of the first, diseases of the glands, known by the vul∣gar name of the king's evil, and other terrible complaints, succeed; and in the latter, the rickets, watery gripes, and many other mala∣dies, proceeding from a weakly and relaxed habit of body, most commonly ensue.</P>
<P>On the other hand, disease and death are the usual consequences of the present erro∣neous method of bringing children up by hand. Scarcely one in four of these little in∣nocents live to get over the cutting of their teeth; and the vitiated blood of those that es∣cape, occasioned by improper nourishment, generally renders them infirm, or short-lived. Almost every complaint to which children are subject, appears to me to proceed originally from an improper management of them; for the young of all other animals are full of health and vigour.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="024796_0056_0FC88F712242DBD8"/>And moreover, independently of these mis∣fortunes, the future happiness of the parent herself is greatly interested in this maternal concern; as it generally falls out, that those children who are neglected by their mothers during their infant years, forget all duty and affection towards them, when such mothers are in the decline of life; and this contempt from a child is nothing less than plunging a dagger into the breast of its parent: and be∣sides the cruel pangs which she must unavoid∣ably experience from this want of duty, daily observation convinces us, that widows fre∣quently suffer not a little, even in the com∣mon conveniencies of life, by the means of those very children, who, if properly educa∣ted, would have probably become their sup∣port and comfort.</P>
<P>Such are the melancholy prospects attend∣ing the present unnatural practice of wet and dry nursing; from which a curse is oftentimes entailed upon a generation, of which parents ought to esteem themselves the authors. How terrible soever these things appear, I esteem it my duty to acquaint mothers in particular, what a risk they run in thus hazarding the health and lives of their children, together with their own present and future happiness; and sincerely hope I may imprint the same ob∣jections upon them, that daily experience in my profession presents to me, against these pernicious customs.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="024796_0057_0FC88F72979DEDD0"/>Oh! that I could prevail on my fair coun∣try-women, to become still more lovely in the sight of men! Believe it not, when it is insi∣nuated that your bosoms are less charming, for having a dear little cherub at your breast. I speak from the feelings of a man, and of one too who has an universal and generous love for the virtuous part of your sex. Trust me, there is no husband could withstand the fond solicitations of an endearing wife, would she be earnest in her desire of bringing up her own children. Rest assured, when he beholds the object of his soul cherishing and supporting in her arms the propitious reward of wedlock, and fondly traces his own lineaments in the darling boy, it recalls a thousand delicate sen∣sations to a generous mind: perhaps he drops a sympathetic tear in recollecting the painful throes of the mother, which she cheeefully bore, to make him such an inestimable pre∣sent. His love, tenderness, and gratitude, be∣ing thus engaged—with what rapture, must he behold her, still carefully intent upon the preservation of his own image!</P>
<P>How ardent soever such an one's affections might be before matrimony, a scene like this will more firmly rivet the pleasing fetters of love:—for, though a beautiful virgin must ever kindle emotions in a man of sensibility, a chaste and tender wife, with a little one at her breast, is certainly to her husband the most exquisitely enchanting object upon earth:— and surely, ladies, had fashion but established
<PB N="61" REF="024796_0058_0FC88F7AA8FE00D8"/>this laudable custom among you, it would prove so truly amiable, as not only to excite the emulation of your maiden friends to wor∣thy conquests, but also raise their ambition to shine in characters thus dignified. How great∣ly then would you contribute to the felicity of your own families, and of mankind in ge∣neral!</P>

The management of infants from the birth—with direc∣tions for putting them to the breast.</HEAD>
<P>HAPPY, thrice happy woman, now be∣come a joyful mother, nurturing her young! Say, tell me, you who know the rap∣turous delight, how complete is the bliss of enfolding in your longing arms the dear, dear fruits of all your pains!—pains now no more remembered. Long may you preserve the dar∣ling, and be doubly blest in its future beauty, health, and virtue!</P>
<P>I am not unmindful, my charming friends, of the prejudices necessary to be conquered, before so material a benefit to mankind, as that which I am to picture out in this letter, can be generally obtained. In my last, the misfortunes attending the neglect of this duty were fully explained; and as I have frequent∣ly succeeded among the private circle of my friends, by addressing their understanding, I trust to the candour of the more ingenuous sex, for my success in public. My endeavour, therefore, throughout, shall be to convince
<PB N="64" REF="024796_0060_0FC88F7DD7CA4948"/>you that I have reason and truth on my side. Happy then shall I think myself, and amply rewarded for my trouble, if I am fortunate e∣nough to meet with your approbation; as your observance of the rules laid down in this lit∣le manual must necessarily follow. Much de∣pends upon your maternal care in the first stage of life; it is a pleasing duty, to which you are honourably called, both by nature and the custom of all nations.</P>
<P>I am truly sensible, that, according to the present mistaken manner of suckling and rear∣ing children, the business is a fatigue, which frightens many at the first attempt; it is a me∣thod altogether culpable and unnatural. To this letter particularly belongs the first ma∣nagement of them. In my next, I shall point out the subsequent errors, and lay down some general rules, that will not only prove benefi∣cial to the child, but make the task of suckling easy and delightful to the mother: even the polite and gay may cheerfully undertake this, at present laborious, employment, without greatly interfering with a social life—for the gloomy ideas of a nursery will vanish. The paths of nature are easy and delightful. Come then, my fair, and let us follow her, step by step.</P>
<P>We have before observed, that a child brings its immediate nourishment into the world with its birth. Man is born in sorrow. The fatigue and pain of delivery, both to the mother and the child, require rest; and ge∣nerally,
<PB N="65" REF="024796_0061_0FC88F823395B810"/>where no improper means are used, they both directly-fall into a sweet refreshing sleep; during which time the milky vessels of the breast are dilated. Thus with prudent management, in a short time a small flow of milk will be obtained. The child, replete with nourishment at its birth, awakes equally refreshed with the mother, and by eagerly sucking the nipple encourages its more plen∣tiful supply.</P>
<P>Sometimes there may be a little inconveni∣ence with the first child; but this is rendered still greater by keeping it away, perhaps two or three days, from the mother, and suffering her attendants to draw her breasts, which ge∣nerally occasions sore nipples. The gentle, easy, and frequent suction of an infant, will not only prevent this inconvenience, but gra∣dually invite the milk, thereby relieving the mother from a troublesome burthen: the nip∣ple also, by this means, will be drawn out, so that the child may suck without further diffi∣culty. This is the lesson nature teaches; and wise are they who observe her precepts.</P>
<P>As to an infant's clothing, the lighter it is, and the more unconfined, the better; very little covering is necessary: and the future deformities of shape, &amp;c. not to mention the deplorable loss of health, sometimes proceed from the dress being too heavy and confin∣ed, at its first entrance into life.</P>
<P>I am entirely against an infant's receiving any nourishment until it can be put to the
<PB N="66" REF="024796_0062_0FC88F8423E41088"/>breast; and much more so against cramming it with what nurses call pap. The stomach is not yet sit for any other food than what Nature has prepared. Art cannot produce a diet with such an affinity to animal blood, as to render it proper for the tender bowels of a new-born child.</P>
<P>The cries of an infant are generally occa∣sioned by the uneasiness it suffers, either from its dress, or in consequence of thus cramming it. The complaints of children in these early days, as I before observed, and likewise the difficulty in cutting of teeth, which I shall hereafter speak of, proceed almost entirely from this wrong practice. Watery gripes, of∣fensive stools, and most disorders in their bowels, are altogether occasioned by impro∣per food.</P>
<P>Custom has rendered this ridiculous prac∣tice so universal, that the good women conti∣nually complain it is impossible for a child to remain without food till the milk comes. Let any mother make a fair and unprejudiced tri∣al, and experience will convince her of the truth of our maxim.</P>
<P>How are other animals supported? Nature, in no one part of the creation, is so imperfect, as to be indebted to the wisdom of man to rec∣tify her works. And suppose a case, in which the milk does not flow so soon as in general it is expected, let the child, under such circum∣stances, be put to the breast again and again; a very little nourishment will at present suf∣fice,
<PB N="67" REF="024796_0063_0FC88F86A3AD1268"/>and that will most commonly be obtain∣ed from the nipple; if it is not, a little warm milk and water, with a small quantity of Lis∣bon sugar, is the only nourishment, in my opi∣nion, that is proper to be given: this advice I have caused to be strictly followed, and have happily experienced the good effects of it in an infant of my own, who scarcely received any support from the breast till after the third day from the birth. Follow, my dear ladies, these rules; and where there an hundred ac∣cidents that now happen to mothers, in con∣sequence of milk fevers, and to children, in consequence of being denied the breast, you will rarely find one. I am convinced of the truth of my assertion by experience, and there∣fore am the more bold in recommending it to you, and to the public.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.
A natural and easy method of suckling children.—This duty proved to be a pleasure rather than a fatigue.</HEAD>
<P>NOW then, my nearly interested friends, let us observe those parts of the creation where instinct only can direct, and for once learn a lesson from the tender brute. Behold those animals which are familiar to us, how successful they are in bringing up their young: animals that give milk to three, four, five, six, and sometimes more of their offspring at a birth. How well and happy are their dams! What unremitting care do they take of their nurslings! They never desert them, until time has given to their bodies strength sufficient to provide for themselves. Provident nature!— and shall mankind alone distrust thy good∣ness? Let us learn, and be wise. Never more suffer it to pass for an argument, that a wo∣man, who is capable of bearing a child, has not strength to suckle it, when the little crea∣tures that surround us can rear a whole fami∣ly at once.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="024796_0065_0FC88F8DA8432CB8"/>O that I could convince you of the breast alone being a sufficient support for the most robust of children! Consider nature well in all her works! Let ignorance and prejudice no longer prevail! Believe this solemn truth, almost every woman is capable of supporting her babe; and great will prove the advanta∣ges, both to herself and her infant. When it is confined altogether to the breast, it gains strength every day, and defies disease. The mother, under these circumstances, would not again conceive so quickly; and miscarriages would thereby be, in a great measure, pre∣vented; unless hurried on by frequent bleed∣ings, and other mistaken practices.</P>
<P>If, for the sake of your families, you value your own lives, attend to this indisputable fact. You yourselves know how many women are ruined in their health by not suckling their children; and what numbers are continually sacrificed by unskilful methods of treatment, at the time of their delivery. You may—you should support your young; the task is easy and delightful, and the thriving child rewards your pains. It is not laborious. I would not wish to see you slaves: the tender delicacy of your frame forbids the very thought. The method is plain and easy—only follow nature.</P>
<P>Sleep is essentially necessary to life; and that the stomach should sometimes be at rest, is as essentially necessary to health; both these things the mother and child equally require. Thus the slavish part of the business is set
<PB N="71" REF="024796_0066_0FC88F8F32BEF398"/>aside; for it is an absurd and erroneous cus∣tom, after stuffing it continually in the day, to keep a child at the breast all night. This counteracts the operations of nature, not only by depriving it of its rest, but also, from a constant fullness, the powers of the infant-body are prevented from exerting themselves in a proper manner upon the aliment receiv∣ed. Hence the stomach and bowels are enfee∣bled, and thereby rendered incapable of pro∣ducing such wholesome nourishment as a child would otherwise obtain from its food; to which grand purpose, sound sleep and absti∣nence are equally conductive.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the mother, being con∣tinually disturbed during the night, is also prevented from assimilating that good and perfect milk, which would otherwise be pro∣duced from the food of the day. Hence she becomes ill, grows tired of her task, and the crude milk proves noxious to the weakened bowels of the infant. Thus disappointment and death frequently succeed.</P>
<P>I know it will be urged by some, that it is impossible to keep children quiet and at rest, during the night, and that they cry for food. Let them be managed from the birth agreea∣bly to the directions here given, and then I believe few persons will complain of their be∣ing troublesome. One reason why children do not sleep well by night is, that they are indul∣ged too much in the cradle by day, when they should have exercise. Another still greater
<PB N="72" REF="024796_0067_0FC88F90A7B851D8"/>reason, I am inclined to think, proceeds from pain, occasioned by improper food, in the first passages; for I will venture to affirm, that al∣most every child's bowels, from the present wrong management, are in a state of disease, which too frequently grows up with it into life; and thus in infancy the lurking cause of a bad constitution is oftentimes established.</P>
<P>When their little stomachs, irritated by too large a quantity, and the bad quality of food, become somewhat empty; a pain, probably like what we call the heart-burn, and acidi∣ties at the stomach, awakens them from their disturbed slumbers; and these little creatures can then only discover their uneasiness by cry∣ing. Hence nurses, partly for their own qui∣et, and partly through a mistaken notion that children cry only for nourishment, cram them until they are quite gorged. Such infants ea∣gerly devour whatever is given them, because the reception of food takes off that too great sensibility of the stomach which caused the pain. A similar effect to this, grown persons, troubled with the complaints I have now men∣tioned, must every day experience upon tak∣ing nourishment; for it always affords a pre∣sent relief.</P>
<P>Four or five times in the twenty-four hours are sufficient for a child to receive the breast; and let the following rules be nearly observ∣ed. About six or seven in the morning, after which the child may be allowed an hour or two's sleep;—again, an hour after the mother
<PB N="73" REF="024796_0068_0FC88F97308EF050"/>has breakfasted—and a third time, if she plea∣ses, before dinner—a fourth time, at five or six o'clock in the evening, being two or three hours after dinner—and lastly, between ten and eleven, just before she goes to rest.</P>
<P>Now, by those mothers who have servants to take off the laborious part of the manage∣ment of children, this surely cannot be deem∣ed a fatigue: that the task itself is a pleasure, the fondness of nurses towards children at the breast fully proves; and that it is an indispen∣sable duty, the feelings of human nature evi∣dently proclaim.</P>
<P>In the early months, sleep may be indulged during the day; but exercise should also at proper intervals be given to children. As they grow stronger, sleep should be less encou∣raged, and exercise increased.</P>
<P>There are several points of management that I have no fault to find with; and, among others, think it needless to dwell upon the ne∣cessity of keeping children dry and clean: it is so evident, that few nurses are culpable in these particulars. But as to rocking children, the custom is altogether absurd. He was an ingenious man who invented a mouse-trap, though none but a fool first thought of a cra∣dle; it was certainly invented to save the at∣tendants trouble, for which, by the bye, they suffer more in return. I never permitted a cra∣dle to disgrace my nursery. Infants, if well, sleep without this lullaby-labour; and such forced dozings generally render them peevish
<PB N="74" REF="024796_0069_0FC88F998AE250E0"/>and watchful in the night; which is the most proper time both for them and their nurses to enjoy their rest.</P>
<P>At the end of six or seven months, when the four first teeth ought to appear, children should be kept awake, and exercised as much as possible; by which time, if managed pro∣perly, they will generally gain strength e∣nough to shoot these teeth, and the others will in due course be cut with ease,</P>
<P>Thus you will avoid an evil that sweeps away great numbers; of which, however, I shall speak more fully in another letter; for It is entirely owing to the weakness of their bodies, that children cut their teeth with so much difficulty, and that it is attended with fever, convulsions, and death.</P>
<P>This weakness of body is but little under∣stood; for if a child be bloated with fat, which too generally happens when it is impro∣perly fed, the parents and their friends call it a fine child, and admire how it thrives—when, alas! that very fat is the disease which ren∣ders its constitution thus feeble: for if the butcher did not kill lambs and calves when they become immoderately fat, they likewise would die as frequently as children. Which death may be justly attributed to the prepos∣terous method, so generally in use, of giving them too much crude unsalutary nourishment; and not managing them in other respects as nature requires, to strengthen the body from the food received.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="024796_0070_0FC88F9A8F1121C8"/>After what has been advanced concerning the early part of infant-management, give me leave to observe, that the arguments enforc∣ed upon this important subject are submitted to the consideration of those mothers who are desirous of preferring a rational system to bi∣goted maxims and opinions, I would wish them to be attended to, and I trust that they will merit their approbation. I do not expect the foregoing rules to be invariably adopted from the birth. I know very well, and it is obvious to those who have been attentive to children, that infants require some more, and others less attendance, especially during the first month or two; and a certain time is necessary, even under the most prudent manage∣ment, to accustom them to our wished-for habits. There is a wide difference between knowing what is right, and doing it; and <HI>oftentimes,</HI> although we may be desirous of strictly following the most prudent maxims, difficulties will unexpectedly arise in the first attempts. Let me therefore desire you to aim at the above regulations, which by perseve∣rance will soon become practicable; and then, determine for yourselves, how greatly they will contribute to your own ease and com∣fort, as well as to the advantage of your chil∣dren.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.
The proper method of weaning children.</HEAD>
<P>IN my last letter I condemned the present erroneous method of suckling and feeding children, and recommended a plain and easy way of rearing them to six or seven months old, upon a rational plan, pointed out by na∣ture in many different parts of the creation; and which most probably was strictly follow∣ed by mankind in the early ages of the world, before luxury, pride, and indolence, crept in∣to society. Ancient history never could have boasted of so many strong and valiant men, had not mothers, in their infancy, given strength and vigour to their constitutions; and the cause of the present pusillanimous, feeble, weakly, and diseased race of mortals, may in some measure be ascribed to the want of this earliest maternal care.</P>
<P>Let us talk with the plain and simple hus∣bandman, who has a nursery of trees under his direction: he will tell us it is not sufficient for the stocks to be good of their kind; for,
<PB N="78" REF="024796_0072_0FC88FA30D9226D0"/>unless they be secured from rude winds, and properly cultivated, so that they may receive nourishment, they will never thrive.</P>
<P>It is literally the same in animal life; there are unfortunate mothers who daily and wo∣fully experience the truth of this argument. How many women are blest with fine chil∣dren, not a blemish, nor the mark of a disease, about them at their birth; and yet before ma∣ny months are past, for want of prudent care and proper nourishment, do they not waste away and die? I need not say more; the tears of many of my gentle readers, at the unhappy recollection, will sufficiently testify the fact. May such tears prove a warning for their fu∣ture conduct, and, trust me, my honoured matrons, your sorrow will be turned into Joy—a joy of the tenderest nature, generous and truly laudable!</P>
<P>Let not man, in the vanity of his heart, tri∣umph in a superiority over the fair sex! for to them alone it belongs to lay the foundation, not of what he is, but what he should be— healthy, strong, and vigorous. You, ladies, form an hero in the cradle; and courage is received from the breast. Gratitude in return demands a protection to you from man. With yourselves, therefore, it remains to render him capable of that protection. Thus nature, my fair-ones, ordained your importance in the creation.</P>
<P>But to return to the husbandman: he will again tell us, that when his trees have receiv∣ed
<PB N="79" REF="024796_0073_0FC88FA5356AF128"/>their infant strength, and their roots begin to shoot, it is necessary to transplant them from the nursery to a more extensive soil, in order that they may arrive at their natural perfection. So you, my friends, having brought the child through its infant state, by the tender nourishment of the breast, must, at the time of weaning, (which, in my opinion, is best postponed until it be near a twelve∣month old) transplant your little nursery like∣wise to a more extensive soil that is, you must afford it more copious nourishment, in order to bring it to maturer life.</P>
<P>Yet, as great skill and caution are requi∣red on the part of the husbandman, in this business of transplanting, so great judgment and care must be shown by you, in this your province of weaning children; for custom has so far deviated from nature, as to render the greatest circumspection necessary to point out the happy medium.</P>
<P>A further care, therefore, at this time de∣mands our attention. Man, according to the present mode, particularly in England, is greatly supported by animal food. A sudden transition, from one extreme to another, is al∣ways dangerous; and every material altera∣tion, to avoid inconveniencies, should be brought about step by step. If nature ever in∣tended us to destroy the animals around us for prey, surely we may conclude this food never could be designed for our use, until such time as we had teeth to eat it.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="024796_0074_0FC88FA66B1F1FA0"/>Many ill consequences arise from persons devouring their meals too eagerly; and if the stomachs of men are oppressed, by not suffi∣ciently chewing their meat, certainly the weak and tender stomachs of children, who have not as yet teeth sufficient to break it, must be still less fit to receive it altogether whole.</P>
<P>Animal food, then, at this time of life, is absolutely forbidden, from reason and reflex∣ion; but as it is in some measure necessary to prepare them for their future method of liv∣ing, broths and jellies may be now given spa∣ringly, and, as they increase in strength and age, more plentifully. Hereby the animal jui∣ces are received, which contain the only nou∣rishment in flesh, without any labour to the stomach; and let it be remembered, that the juices of full-grown animals are to be prefer∣red to the younger and fattened kind; but more of this in its proper place.</P>
<P>Let children at this time be fed once or twice a day with about a quarter of a pint of broth, and a little bread mixed in it. When you give a stiff jelly, a large tea-cup full is sufficient; but I would recommend as much warm water, or milk, with it, and likewise a little bread. The breast should not be allowed them now so often as when they were wholly confined to that nourishment; in short, every meal that you thus introduce, should supply one of the stated times of suckling. Thus are they gradually and insensibly weaned from
<PB N="81" REF="024796_0075_0FC88FA8097CB218"/>the breast, and accustomed to animal food, without any pining on their parts, or much trouble to the mother.</P>
<P>Having shown the proper manner of putting a child to the breast, and likewise the most prudent method of taking it away; we shall, in the next letter, point out the safest rules for bringing children up by hand: but another observation or two will not be improper in this place.</P>
<P>The gravy, which runs out of meat, upon cutting it when brought to table, is exceeding∣ly wholesome, being nothing more than the pure juices of flesh. A few spoonfuls of this beef or mutton gravy, mixed with an equal quantity of warm water, and a little salt, make very good broth. I mention this, because parents generally imagine it to be unwhole∣some for children; and oftentimes, when I have recommended it, some good old lady has stoutly opposed me, alleging that it fills a child with humours; whereas, on the contra∣ry, this is the only part of flesh that produces good nourishment.</P>
<P>Here let me protest against the custom of not suffering children to eat salt, for fear of the scurvy; not making a distinction between salted meats, and salt eaten with meat. In this point also, strong prejudices are frequent∣ly to be combated with; for many a time have I been told by persons of reverent years, that children were not suffered to eat salt in former days; adding, perhaps with, a signifi∣cant
<PB N="82" REF="024796_0076_0FC88FABA4410D38"/>shrug, that the present age think them∣selves much wiser than their forefathers.</P>
<P>"Animal food, which has been any consi∣derable time in salt, becomes hard, and re∣quires more force to break and digest it, pro∣per for nourishment, than weak stomachs are capable of exerting; consequently, salted beef, pork, and such like things, are impro∣per for children."</P>
<P>Nevertheless, salt in itself is so far from producing; the scurvy, that it is now general∣ly supposed to be its greatest antidote; other∣wise, why do so many thousands yearly flock to bathe, and drink sea-water? There is, fur∣ther, a certain stimulating quality in salt, that greatly promotes digestion; and whatsoever assists that office, must of course rather contri∣bute to purify the blood, than to render it foul; which is the supposed cause of the pre∣sent frequently imagined, but oftentimes only a, fashionable disease—called the scurvy.</P>
<P>I have been repeatedly thanked for the fol∣lowing information. A table spoonful or two of salt, put into a quart of spring water, is a most excellent wash to cleanse the skin, especially if the face be well rubbed with a coarse cloth some little time after it has been washed with the salt and water. By this means the pores of the skin will be kept open, and no obstruct∣ed perspiration will remain, which is the cause of carbuncles and those red pimples which are generally mistaken for the scurvy. It is this stimulating and cleansing quality of salt that
<PB N="83" REF="024796_0077_0FC88FB1E2F7CC28"/>makes the sea-water so useful to those who are troubled with eruptions; therefore, by the above proportion, the water is rendered still more efficacious, and will clear the face and neck of heats and pimples which frequent∣ly disturb the ladies.</P>
<P>I cannot bear the modern prostitution of the words female delicacy: the duties of a mother are by some thought to be indelicate; and the appellation is now given only to dis∣ease and sickness; for a woman must become a walking ghost, to be styled truly delicate. I frequently lament, that the idea is not more strictly confined to mental accomplishments; nevertheless, I wish my fair friends to bestow every rational and laudable attention to ren∣der their persons neat, elegant, and engaging. I cannot conclude this letter better than by observing, that, although beauty stands like a cypher when alone, every additional qualifi∣cation increases its merits ten-fold; and the less sensible of it the possessor herself appears to be, the more it will always be regarded by the admiring world.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The safest method of bringing children up by hand.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto, my fair philosophers, been carefully observant of, and obedi∣ent to, the laws of nature. Her paths are in∣finitely various. Every step we take, affords new and engaging prospects. We have traced man from the first period of his existence, and have followed reason and instinct, to give him strength and vigour in the earliest part of life. So fair a dawning promises a robust and healthy constitution; nevertheless, necessity obliges us to proceed to a further speculation.</P>
<P>Let it, therefore, be the business of this let∣ter to enquire how nearly art can supply the place of nature. Let us endeavour to point out a method to those unfortunate mothers, who are, through necessity, deprived of the happy enjoyment of suckling their own chil∣dren. It may not prove unworthy the atten∣tion of those, who, by choice, commit them to the care of others. I propose to carry my observations in this letter, as far as my in∣structions
<PB N="86" REF="024796_0079_0FC88FB5585CB990"/>have been given to the valuable and truly praise-worthy matrons, whose duty to their family over-balances every other consi∣deration. By and by, when the suckling is about to be weaned, and the dry-nursed child brought equally forward, the rules of diet will be the same for both; on which account I went no farther in my last, than the proper period for introducing broths, jellies, &amp;c. All other considerations will be brought under general directions.</P>
<P>Mother's milk we have shown to be the na∣tural and most proper support for tender in∣fants; it is a digested fluid, already animali∣zed, and therefore fittest for the nourishment of children. This remark also shows that the infant body is, by nature, designed to receive only a liquid nourishment; a hint particular∣ly necessary to be attended to at this time, as it altogether obviates the general objections against confining children to milk, in prefer∣ence to thicker victuals, of which I shall speak more fully before I conclude this letter.</P>
<P>We have taken notice how tender the sto∣mach and bowels of infants are, and have thence inferred, that almost every complaint they are afflicted with, proceeds from the im∣proper quality of their food: and the too large quantity given them, also increases the dis∣ease. We took notice, that the digestive pow∣ers of a new-born child are incapable of pro∣ducing a kind nutriment even from bread, and therefore exclaimed against feeding them with
<PB N="87" REF="024796_0080_0FC88FBC319753E8"/>what is called pap. But suppose it to be other∣wise: what a poor pittance of support does such a mother allow to her child, who gives it only bread and water!</P>
<P>I have seen many fatal instances of such strange management. We ourselves should think it hard, indeed, and nothing but dire ne∣cessity could compel us to live thus sparingly; besides, how would our flesh waste, and our strength decay! If so, surely it cannot be pro∣per for an infant, whose bones have not as yet strength sufficient to support its frame. How is it possible for a child to thrive under such treatment?—Perhaps some will allow a little milk to be mixed with its food, but very spa∣ringly; because they imagine it stuffs the sto∣mach, and fills a child full of phlegm. Idle and ridiculous are these, and all other argu∣ments that can be urged against this natural and salubrious diet.</P>
<P>Milk is here spoken of in general terms; because I intend, in a subsequent letter, to ex∣amine the several properties of different milks, and to remark the purpose to which each kind seems best adapted. Cow's milk being mostly used, and in my opinion the properest, in ge∣neral, to answer our present design, I would therefore be understood to recommend that, if no other kind is particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>I know very well that many persons, and perhaps some gentlemen in the practice of physic, will differ from me in opinion, when I prefer cow's milk to every other kind of
<PB N="88" REF="024796_0081_0FC88FBF0A368C38"/>nourishment, in the early months, where it is necessary to bring a child up by hand. Let me beg of them only to make the experiment, as I speak from experience; and if they have rea∣son to censure me afterwards, we shall meet upon equal terms; till then, at least, I shall hope for candour from every one.</P>
<P>It has frequently been suggested to me, that cow's milk is too rich, abounding also with too much cream, and that being of a fat oily nature, it will relax more than strength∣en. But, however, this fault is not much to be apprehended from the milk used in and about London. Supposing it to be the case in the country, which I am far from allowing, you may let it stand till the cream rises to the top, and use the skimmed milk; or by boiling deprive it of the greatest part of this oily qua∣lity, which collects itself upon the surface, and may then be readily taken off; or it may be diluted with water.</P>
<P>These doubts being removed, the milk of cows appears, I think, to be the properest sub∣stitute we can make, for that of the breast; and will answer best, after the first month or two, without boiling, unless it purges the child; in which case, boiling it will generally prevent the inconvenience, proceeding in all likelihood from its oily particles. I have no objection to a small quantity of Lisbon sugar being mixed with it, particularly if the child be costive; and indeed this may frequently be of use, to prevent its too great tendency to
<PB N="89" REF="024796_0082_0FC88FBFDC1ED270"/>become acid, from whence disorders of the bowels sometimes arise.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let it be remembered, that, through this system of nursing, children are supposed to be free from disease, and that I am to be considered not as the physician, but as the friend: when they are ill, it is the business of those persons who have the care of them, to direct a proper food; and upon many occasions, milk may be so managed as to prove greatly instrumental, even as a well-adapted nourishment, to their recovery. In too laxative a habit of body, for instance, rice and cinna∣mon may be added; but then care should be taken, that the rice be well boiled in water, before it is mixed with the milk. In the watery gripes, I frequently di∣rect the following diet, for infants: Boil a table spoon∣ful of ground rice, with a little cinnamon, in half a pint of water, till the water is nearly consumed; then add a pint of milk, and let the whole gently simmer for five minutes; strain it through a lawn sieve, and make it palatable with a little sugar. This food corresponds well, in such complaints, with the curative intention.</NOTE></P>
<P>One remark I shall beg leave to make, which comes in here with propriety. We have ta∣ken notice in a former letter of the cleansing quality of mother's milk, upon its first com∣ing into the breast. Now, where children are debarred from receiving it, a substitute of some gentle purgative is highly proper, to give such a stimulus to the bowels, as nature has provided by the mother's means. What I have experienced to be the best calculated for answering this purpose, is something of the following kind.</P>
<P>Suppose we say, <HI>syrup of violets and oil of al∣monds, of each one ounce, with four or five grains of rhubarb.</HI> This composition being shaken
<PB N="90" REF="024796_0083_0FC88FC19D0369F8"/>will pretty well unite. A tea-spoonful may be given as often as you find it necessary.</P>
<P>In case the milk be thrown up in a curdled state, a small quantity of salt will generally prevent it; a circumstance I would wish to have attended to; as many children are sub∣ject to this complaint; and it is a method I have seldom known to fail, unless they are greatly over-fed. Whenever a child throws up the milk, it is to be considered as a com∣plaint, and particularly so if it appears cur∣dled; because it has then passed through the first change it undergoes in the stomach, and consequently discovers that the stomach itself is too feeble to execute its further office. In this case, sometimes the stomach abounds with too great an acidity, but more frequently it is loaded and oppressed by the quantity which has been given to the infant. Milk always cur∣dles in the stomach; and it is only a vulgar error to suppose the contrary; for by this means it becomes a substantial aliment, and affords a proper nourishment to children and other animals; whereas, if it continued in a fluid state, it would contribute but little to their support.</P>
<P>What we have next to observe, is the quan∣tity of milk proper to be given to a new-born child, in the twenty-four hours. What think you, my dear ladies, of a Winchester pint be∣ing a sufficient quantity for the day and night! Methinks I hear an exclamation—O barbarous man! Under a pretence of correcting us, he
<PB N="91" REF="024796_0084_0FC88FC6E1249A98"/>intends to starve the little helpless creatures. Was there ever such a cruelty heard of be∣fore? Allow a child only a pint of milk in a day! Why, it would eat two quarts of pap, and still cry for more.—Yet, after all surprise, an infant in the month will receive, from one pint of milk, more real and good nourishment, than from ten quarts of pap, as it is called; indeed I might say more nourishment than from any other kind of support: for, not∣withstanding the juices which afford susten∣ance are all liquid, it is necessary they should, contain the essence of substantial food: and although a man who is accustomed to daily labour, would soon be emaciated by living continually upon broths, yet milk alone would support his strength and spirits, because it cur∣dles in the stomach, and thereby becomes a more solid and nutritious aliment. And fur∣ther, let me again remind you, that not only the human species, but likewise all other ani∣mals, receive their continual nourishment from a milky juice which is prepared in their own bodies from the aliment received, as was before explained in the fourth letter.</P>
<P>There are, as we have mentioned, very great errors in the quantities as well as the qualities of infants' food. It was before ob∣served, that children's stomachs should not be always crammed. To this it is in a great mea∣sure owing that they are so continually puk∣ing: a circumstance looked upon by some to be natural and wholesome, who preposterous∣ly
<PB N="92" REF="024796_0085_0FC88FCB4017D590"/>encourage this disposition by frequent vo∣mits. But, surely, nature never intended more nourishment to be received than is necessary for our support. Does any person in a good state of health, after a moderate and proper meal, ever find an inclination to throw it up again? Are the young offspring of other ani∣mals constantly puking? How therefore can it be supposed natural for children to do so? A little reflexion would soon convince such superficial observers of their error; for you will rarely find a child throw up its food, when properly nursed.</P>
<P>If one pint of milk, therefore, in the first week or two, be too little, it is an error on the right side; for it appears to be enough to support the child; and much worse conse∣quences are to be apprehended from giving it too much. We must, every one of us, have often experienced how necessary it is to be hungry, in order to relish our food; and that to be continually indulging, palls the appe∣tite. Certainly then, it must be equally neces∣sary, that the infant stomach should some∣times know the sense of hunger.</P>
<P>Would not three or four pints of milk, in the twenty-four hours, support a grown per∣son? If so, undoubtedly one third part is am∣ply sufficient to nourish a new-born child. But I would not be understood to cavil scrupu∣lously for a spoonful or two; I only mean to assist the candid enquirer in this most essential part of the management of children, who are denied the breast.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="024796_0086_0FC88FCCA1D90618"/>We come next to ascertain the proper quan∣tity to be given for a meal. A quarter of a pint is fully sufficient to be taken at a time; and let the hours of feeding, as well as every other particular, be regulated according to the rules laid down in the seventh letter. In ten days, or a fortnight, you may increase the daily allowance a quarter of a pint: and at the end of a month you may allow a pint and a half in the twenty-four hours: another half-pint may be gradually permitted by the time it is three months old; and this quantity, if the child is voracious, may be still increased to three pints in the day; which, I am persuad∣ed, if the milk be good, will prove sufficient: and this allowance will, I hope, cancel the se∣verity of every matron's censure.</P>
<P>Having now given you my thoughts upon this part of infant management, there is but one rational objection that strikes me, against the propriety of so plain and simple a method of bringing children up by hand. Their natu∣ral food is allowed to be milk—but it may be urged, that the human milk, in consequence of the mother's diet, is more strengthening than that of cows, asses, or any other species of brutes. Granted—but then again this ar∣gument equally proves, that cow's milk par∣takes more of a vegetable nature than the milk of women; and, during the early months, all that the advocates for the present custom would contend for, is—what? pap, panado, &amp;c. which are of the vegetable kind; and
<PB N="94" REF="024796_0087_0FC88FCE5707F730"/>therefore their arguments require no farther answer. Were it proposed to add some pro∣per broths to cow's milk, after the first four or five weeks, where there is no circumstance particularly to forbid it, the design would ap∣pear reasonable, in supplying the supposed deficiency of the animal property; and it is a point I would readily join in, nay, it is what I mean to recommend towards the end of the third month. I frequently order milk and broth to be mixed together, and think it pro∣per food. But let every such meal, however, as before advised, supply the place of the usu∣al milk. In whatever way you manage chil∣dren, be careful not to feed them over-much.</P>
<P>There is yet a circumstance of great mo∣ment to be attended to, and, if rightly com∣prehended by my fair pupils, will convince them, that the allowance for the earlier months is amply sufficient: it is the manner in which infants ought to be fed.</P>
<P>Surely it is wrong to put a large boat full of pap into their little mouths, suffering them to swallow the whole of it in the space of a minute; and then perhaps, from their cries, to ply them with a second, which is no sooner down than thrown up again.</P>
<P>We have mentioned the ill consequences of grown persons devouring their victuals too eagerly; and experience must often have con∣vinced every one, that a much less quantity than we generally take, if eaten leisurely, and well chewed, will suffice for a meal; and also
<PB N="95" REF="024796_0088_0FC88FD0160373C8"/>that, after such meals, we seem more com∣fortable, and are inclined to pursue either bu∣siness or pleasure with far greater ease to our∣selves. On the contrary, from a too hasty and hearty meal the stomach will be distended over-much, which is always productive of in∣dolence, and a tendency to sleep. The same must certainly hold good with respect to in∣fants.</P>
<P>Besides, to obtain milk from the breast, nature wisely obliges them to earn their nou∣rishment by the labour of drawing it. The stream being exceedingly small upon the milk's first coming into the breast, it requires a long time to procure a quarter of a pint; and the very exercise fatigues them, before they have received too much. This, in my opinion, fully proves that quantity to be suf∣ficient for a meal.</P>
<P>There is nothing, therefore, wanting, I hope, to complete our system, but a contriv∣ance to supply the place of a nipple, that the child may still labour to obtain its support; which alone will greatly prevent the error in quantity. I have seen some inventions of this kind, by means of parchment or leather sew∣ed to the pointed end of a horn, which is no bad thought, and capable of great improve∣ment. The Hollanders, when they travel, have a small pewter vessel, somewhat in the form of a cone, which is filled with milk, and a piece of sponge covered with a linen cloth is tied over the smaller end. This serves the
<PB N="96" REF="024796_0089_0FC88FD504C59A78"/>children very well as an artificial nipple: for it is observed, that a Dutch woman seldom or never gives suck to her child before strangers.</P>
<P>We have plainly demonstrated, that infant nourishment, particularly in the early months, is designed by nature to be altogether liquid: against such contrivances, therefore, I cannot see an objection.</P>
<P>Would you, my fair friends, undertake this pursuit, from the happy fertility of female imagination, I am certain a little experience would point out to you a ready and conveni∣ent method to answer every purpose; and I am thoroughly satisfied, the happy consequen∣ces would amply reward your pains—by pre∣serving many dear little innocents, that daily fall a sacrifice to repletion or over-feeding.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S.—Since this book made its first appear∣ance, I have contrived a milk-pot for my own nursery upon the above principles; it appears to my family, and to many of my patients, preferable to those now in use, and may pro∣bably be still further improved. For the satis∣faction of my readers, I shall give a descrip∣tion of it. This pot is somewhat in form like an urn; it contains a little more than a quar∣ter of a pint; its handle, and neck or spout, are not unlike those of a coffee-pot, except that the neck of this arises from the very bot∣tom of the pot, and is very small; in short, it is upon the same principle as those gravy-pots which separate the gravy from the oily fat.
<PB N="97" REF="024796_0090_0FC88FD717391568"/>The end of the spout is a little raised, and forms a roundish knob, somewhat in appear∣ance like a small heart; this is perforated by three or four small holes: a piece of fine rag is tied loosely over it, which serves the child to play with instead of the nipple, and through which, by the infant's sucking, the milk is constantly strained. The child is equally sa∣tisfied as it would be with the breast; it never wets him in the least; he is obliged to labour for every drop he receives, in the same man∣ner as when at the breast; and, greatly in re∣commendation of this contrivance, the nurses confess it is more convenient than a boat, and that it saves a great deal of trouble in the feeding of an infant; which is the greatest se∣curity to parents, that their servants will use it, when they themselves are not present.</P>

<P>I AM just now returned from a nursery, where, with sincere pleasure, I beheld a happy mother with a pretty little puppet at her breast, which she had the satisfaction of saving in its earliest days, by her amiable af∣fection and tenderness; an infant born under melancholy circumstances, when the mother herself was afflicted with a terrible quincy in her throat, and had been confined to a sick chamber five or six weeks before her delive∣ry. No one expected the life of the child, and the mother's was equally doubtful. No∣thing but the greatest care on her part could have saved the infant; and, had it been com∣mitted to any other person, the diseased state of its bowels at the birth would, probably, very soon have put a period to its existence.</P>
<P>Judge, ye considerate fair, indulge with me the pleasing reflexions of this good woman! Behold her, fondling at the breast a smiling bey, to whom she not only gave a being, but
<PB N="100" REF="024796_0092_0FC88E03E9323BF0"/>generously preferred his welfare, and dared, even contrary to the advice of her friends, to suckle him, thereby endangering her own, to preserve the life of her child. May gratitude and duty expand within his breast, and prompt him virtuously to reward this truly maternal affection! May he, in future years, become the pleasure and support of her declining life!</P>
<P>This amiable mother has three other little ones, that for health and beauty stand almost unrivalled; all nurtured under her own wing—supported by her breast. What an en∣couragement is this to follow nature! Her heart was never torn by the bitter reflexion of not having done her duty to her family. Ex∣ample glorious! worthy of praise—worthy of imitation!</P>
<P>But to return to our present point: the suckling being weaned, and the dry-nursed child brought equally forward; we shall now join our different nurseries together, and en∣deavour to make them thrive under one ge∣neral direction.</P>
<P>I must, however, beg leave to mention, that as I before advised to have the child kept to the breast till it is near twelve months old, and have also pointed out the prudent man∣ner of introducing broths and jellies, prepa∣rative to weaning it entirely; so this letter is designed to recommend a proper manage∣ment of infants from the period of one to two years of age.</P>
<P>The best method likewise having been laid
<PB N="101" REF="024796_0093_0FC88E0AA42F07F0"/>down for bringing children up by hand, upon those principles that approach nearest to na∣ture, which surely renders them unexception∣able; and having indulged them with broths and jellies earlier than the sucking child; I shall suppose these also gradually brought on to the twelfth month, and thence proceed with both together.</P>
<P>I most earnestly recommend that they be strictly confined to the following diet, and not fed oftener than three, or four times at most, in the twenty-four hours. The quantity for each meal may now with propriety be consi∣derably increased; it will be longer, there∣fore, of consequence, before the stomach be∣comes empty.</P>
<P>Thus, for instance, let their breakfast, at six or seven in the morning, be half a pint of new milk with about two ounces of bread in it. The second meal should be half a pint of good broth, with the same quantity of bread; let this be given about ten or eleven in the morning. The third meal, about two or three in the afternoon, should be broth in like man∣ner: and their supper, about six in the even∣ing, new milk and bread, the same as for breakfast. When you substitute jellies, or gravies, for broth, let them be always plain and simple; and a less quantity will prove suf∣ficient.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the article <HI>salop</HI> in the Family Physician, p. 26, you will find proper directions to prepare an excel∣lent strengthening food, by mixing salop with milk, which makes it of the consistence of a custard. This preparation of milk is highly proper for children, inva∣lids, and aged persons; and it is withal a very agreea∣ble and palatable nourishment.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="024796_0094_0FC88E0D71938F10"/>If children are thirsty between their meals, a little barley-water and milk may be given them; but I would not too frequently encou∣rage this custom.</P>
<P>From hence, the general intention appears throughout, to decrease the quantity of milk, as you introduce other substantial and proper nourishment—though I would always allow children a pint of milk each day.</P>
<P>Biscuits, sweet-meats, sugar plums, &amp;c. all which tend to spoil the appetite, are highly improper, and ought to be looked upon as one of the pernicious effects of luxury. Where is there a child, unaccustomed to such indul∣gence, that would not be equally pleased with a crust of bread? It is not my business here to enter so philosophically into the doctrine of nourishment, as to contend with those who suppose it altogether to proceed from the sac∣charine qualities of food: but allowing them the utmost force of their arguments, I answer, that nature will always prove the best chy∣mist, to separate these sugar-like particles from the aliment we take in. So much for the present, with regard to the regulation of their diet.</P>
<P>As to other particulars: Little or no sleep should now be permitted in the day. Air and exercise are greatly to be recommended. Let
<PB N="103" REF="024796_0095_0FC88E0E596B2BF0"/>them rise as early as you please; and the soon∣er they are put to bed, when the evening be∣gins to shut in, the better. Their clothing should now, and indeed always, be light and easy. By no means suffer children to be confi∣ned in very warm rooms, but accustom them by degrees to those variations of the seasons, which they will be compelled to struggle with in future life.</P>
<P>It is a great misfortune for children to be brought up too tenderly. Should Providence hereafter design them to contend with difficul∣ties, how little capable will they be of con∣quering them? The child thus nurtured most commonly grows up too delicate and feeble to encounter hardships. Should necessity, or chance, hereafter lead him to seek his fortune on the raging seas, or to bear his part in the hardy service of his country by land; how pitiful will such a man appear! How unequal to the necessary toils of sieges, storms, and tempests!—But, however, this great error, to the credit of good mothers be it confessed, is of late years much corrected.</P>
<P>I beg leave, my fair friends, to say something concerning their being put upon their feet. With respect to the time, the strength of the child must determine that period. Of this be assured, that all children will show an inclination to walk, as soon as their bones have acquired a firmness sufficient to support the body. I am fearful many heavy children are injured by exciting their feeble efforts to
<PB N="104" REF="024796_0096_0FC88E0FDA938EF0"/>walk too soon. Doubtless it is a convenience and ease to nurses to set them upon their feet, as they do not then require exercise in the arms; and consequently are not so great a trouble and fatigue to those who have the care of them. But it is a fault entirely to be condemned, and what I particularly caution you against; because, whoever you may have to attend upon your children, they will cer∣tainly encourage them to walk, for reasons above mentioned.</P>
<P>Therefore throw aside your leading-strings, and your back-strings, and every other crafty invention which tends to put children for∣warder than nature designed. Our young plants are to be cultivated without art. The industrious gardener, it is true, can boast of his exotics, and early fruits, by forcing their growth. Yet say, ye sons of Epicurus, are your grapes or pines thus raised, equal to the produce of their natural climate? And not∣withstanding the merit of your gardener, who is thus capable of gratifying this high zest of luxurious extravagance; even in this your boasted pride, a simple clown would be wise enough to expose your folly, by the honest preference which he would give to nature. Such as the fruits are, watery and insipid; such also are the plants thus forced, weakly and tender; susceptible of the slightest inju∣ries, and exposed to continual dangers: such likewise are the poor feeble infants, forced upon their legs before nature has designed
<PB N="105" REF="024796_0097_0FC88E1780E00790"/>them; while others, managed without art, like fruitful vines, defy the inclement seasons, and triumph in their natural strength and vi∣gour.</P>
<P>I do not mean, from what has been said up∣on this subject, to prevent them, when they really show an inclination to walk, but to ad∣monish you against being too precipitate. It is, in my opinion, a good method to suffer the little creatures first to crawl upon a carpet, or any other convenient place; permitting them to tumble about as much as they please. By this means an exercise will be given to the body and limbs, without their continuing in one position long enough to hazard a distortion, from too great a weight of body. Thus let them, by degrees, learn to walk upright, which their own inclinations, in imitation of those about them, will prompt them to, full as soon as nature designed.</P>
<P>I shall now beg leave to offer a few hints with respect to the teeth: a circumstance this, materially to be attended to, as woful experi∣ence daily convinces us.</P>
<P>Children are teazed with cutting of teeth from four or five months, till they are two years old, and upwards; nay, some are so backward as not to have their complete num∣ber till they are turned of three years old. I shall not enter into the distinction of teeth, but speak of them in general, so as to give a com∣petent idea of the precautions I mean to re∣commend.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="024796_0098_0FC88E18E8F85B88"/>It is also very uncertain with respect to the exact time of their shooting any of their teeth; but this also, I believe, chiefly depends upon the strength of the constitution; and if the rules laid down in the preceding letters be properly observed, you will generally find children cut all their teeth by the time they are about two years old. You will, likewise, rarely meet with an instance of their being cut with difficulty. It has been already taken no∣tice of, that the reason of their being back∣ward in their teeth, and so many children lost on this account, is entirely owing to a weak∣ness of body, which is a fact that scarcely any one will deny.</P>
<P>Yet, where the constitution is not strong e∣nough of itself, as a great assistance may be ob∣tained by lancing of the gums, let not a false tenderness prevent fond mothers from allow∣ing such relief to their little babes, in the ex∣cruciating tortures they suffer by the cutting of teeth. The operation is not to be deemed pain; for if you put any thing with a sharp edge into their mouths, they will save you the trouble of doing it, by pressing hard against the in∣strument, and cutting the gum themselves.</P>
<P>When the teeth are discernible to the sight or touch, there is very little sense of feeling in the gum; their tortures proceed from the sensibility of a fine membrane which envelopes the tooth. If that membrane is sufficiently divided, although the gum should again unite, there will be no more trouble; for teeth thus
<PB N="107" REF="024796_0099_0FC88E1A5BBF39C8"/>lanced will gradually advance without future pain. Never, therefore, I say, let a prejudice like this hinder you from relieving such poor little helpless creatures.</P>
<P>There are many persons, who, about the age of twenty, have two, and sometimes four, additional teeth, at the furthermost part of the jaws; and, from the time of life in which they appear, they are called the teeth of wis∣dom. Let me desire such wise ones, sensible of the pain upon this occasion, to reflect how insupportable it must be to many infants, who perhaps are cutting the whole of their teeth al∣most at once; at a time too, when their tender frames are but little capable of bearing pain. Many grown persons are obliged to have such teeth lanced; let them declare how much re∣lief they found from this simple, but useful operation.</P>
<P>Candid reasoning, from experience, is the surest way to conquer prejudices; and those who give themselves leave to think upon the point with candour, will, I doubt not, allow the force of this argument.</P>
<P>It may not be unseasonable, in this place, to give a caution, which those who lance teeth would do well to observe; as carelessness or ignorance in the operation frequently frus∣trates the intended benefit. Let me advise you not to depend upon old women, or nurses, who undertake to do it with crooked sixpen∣ces, and such like ineffectual means.</P>
<P>We took notice a little above, that the pain
<PB N="108" REF="024796_0100_0FC88E1CA8B31CF8"/>arises, not from the gum, but from the sensi∣bility of a fine membrane which envelopes the teeth. It is not, therefore, sufficient to make a longitudinal incision into the gum, that be∣ing too commonly done without dividing this membrane; in which case, instead of good, it does hurt. After cutting through the gum, the instrument should be drawn round the tooth; and the person should be satisfied, that it grates in every part against the tooth, which will effectually divide this too sensible mem∣brane. Where the gum is exceedingly tough, a transverse incision ought likewise to be made, and with these precautions the operati∣on will assuredly succeed. Parents cannot be too careful in this particular; for I have often observed ill consequences from the careless∣ness before mentioned.</P>
<P>In my observations upon children that are lost between the age of five months and three years, I have found they are generally carri∣ed off either by sudden convulsions, or what is called a tooth-fever, or a wasting of the bo∣dy: in the two last cases, the scene likewise is commonly closed with convulsive fits.</P>
<P>The original cause of these disasters having been frequently taken notice of to proceed from the wrong management of children, it appears equally evident to me, that the imme∣diate cause of these fits almost always arises from want of strength in the constitution to cut the teeth. It is true, the bowels some∣times are greatly affected, which indeed ge∣nerally
<PB N="109" REF="024796_0101_0FC88E1EDE9204F0"/>attends a wasting of the body; but then the immediate cause of such complaints at this time is most commonly the teeth: for if children are capable of enduring the impro∣per aliments before mentioned in their most tender state, during the first four or five months; surely, without some more active principle, the vital powers would not after∣wards be by them alone subdued.</P>
<P>This makes me particularly solicitous to recommend lancing of the gums before it is too late to assist children; being firmly per∣suaded that many might be saved, who daily fall a sacrifice to those complaints for want of it.</P>
<P>Among many other instances that I could relate, to show the necessity of admitting this operation before the strength of the child be decayed, and its body wasted, I shall conclude this letter with a remarkable case of this sort.</P>
<P>A poor woman in the neighbourhood, some time since, brought her child to me: he was apparently a stout fine boy, and then about nine months old. She desired my advice for an eruption the child had all over his body, which she called scurvy; but I found it no∣thing more than some pimples proceeding from the improper quality of its food; and in fact, notwithstanding the chubby appearance of the boy (which in reality was nothing more than bloated fat), he was actually of a very weakly frame, as appears by the sequel—and
<PB N="110" REF="024796_0102_0FC88E24B820D1F8"/>I think it necessary, as a farther confirmation of my assertion, to inform you, that his father was at this time between sixty and seventy, his mother not less than four or five and thir∣ty years of age.</P>
<P>Near or quite six months afterwards, the same woman came to beg the favour of me to look at her child again, who, she said, was dying. I saw an infant worn away to a mere skeleton; and, upon enquiry, found it to be the same chubby fat boy I had seen before. He lay panting for breath, and had taken little or no nourishment for twenty-four hours. Upon examining the little patient, there was not a tooth appeared. The cause of the disease, therefore, was immediately evident to me; but I told her it was too late to be of service, for I found the child could not recover.</P>
<P>However, to satisfy the mother, I advised lancing the gums. To the astonishment of every one about the child, sixteen large teeth were cut out; but the gums being very much hardened, for want of this operation, it was with no small difficulty now performed. The immediate relief which the child received, surprised them all still more. From a convul∣sive state that he before lay in, he instantly recovered, took notice of every body in the room, and, during the time I staid, eagerly devoured a considerable quantity of nourish∣ment.</P>
<P>The grateful parent thanked me a thousand times, and reflected upon herself for delaying
<PB N="111" REF="024796_0103_0FC88E259AA61CF0"/>to apply to me before. But, alas! I foresaw it was only a temporary relief, his strength being utterly exhausted. I left her, without giving the least hopes of his recovery; and the next morning the child died. A reflexion upon this case, I take for granted, is entirely needless. It is evident, had the teeth been cut in due time, this fatal accident would not have happened.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, a topic of serious concern; but as it comes under the class of diseases to which infants are subject, it cannot be enlarg∣ed upon in this little volume. Some opinions, and medical observations, are thrown out in the introduction to these letters, which, if carefully attended to, may assist the intelli∣gent parent in her endeavours to preserve the lives of such little innocents. A table of births and infant burials is also inserted, which proves the melancholy truths I am aiming to establish.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.
A general management of children, from two years old, till they leave the nursery.</HEAD>
<P>THE cultivation of the mind I have inten∣tionally reserved for the subject of my next letter; for which reason I shall now fi∣nish my observations upon nursing, and en∣deavour to point out the safest and most pru∣dent method of introducing children into the family way of living.</P>
<P>At length, after surmounting the difficulties and inconveniencies attending the cutting of their teeth, we have now set them upon their legs; to the no small joy of the mother, and the relief of those servants whose business it is to wait upon them.</P>
<P>We have hitherto permitted breed, milk, and the juices only of flesh; and before we ad∣vance any farther, I beg leave to make the following remarks, by which my intelligent readers may profit.</P>
<P>The food of man, in all its various shapes, however tortured and disguised, is still confi∣ned to animal and vegetable productions.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="024796_0105_0FC88E2F1BD6EC30"/>Of vegetables, bread is the most valuable preparation, as the experience of ages proves. That made from wheat flour is still the most strengthening, and ever to be preferred by those who have the means of obtaining it.</P>
<P>The milk of cows, although it may be sup∣posed not to partake so much of a strengthen∣ing nature as the human milk, those creatures feeding altogether upon vegetables, is, never∣theless, to be considered as a food partly ani∣mal, and partly vegetable, prepared also un∣der an all-wise direction.</P>
<P>Gravies, jellies, and broths, we know, are animal juices; either spontaneously flowing from flesh, upon cutting it, after it is dress∣ed; or obtained by a maceration of it in wa∣ter.</P>
<P>From these reflexions, therefore, it ap∣pears, that in the regimen already permitted, the most valuable supplies of life are granted, and in a manner the best adapted to infant constitutions; requiring but little exertion of the digestive faculties, and gradually introdu∣cing that nutriment, which, as the body be∣comes stronger, it must prepare for itself from the grosser aliments.</P>
<P>The intention of what has been said is to encourage, as much as possible, the continua∣tion of this diet a little longer; and, indeed, some of the finest children I ever saw, have been chiefly confined to a food like this, for the first five or six years. But although I strongly recommend it, and am conscious that chil∣dren,
<PB N="115" REF="024796_0106_0FC88E305A92D370"/>unacquainted with the indulgence of variety, would be perfectly satisfied without animal food; yet I am persuaded that the culpable fondness of most parents will initiate them, too early, into the luxuries of a plen∣tiful table.</P>
<P>It is true, we made an observation, that na∣ture never intended flesh for our food, until we had teeth to eat it; but it by no means follows, as soon as we have our teeth, that with an unbounded freedom we are to de∣vour animal food. Remember, likewise, ye too indulgent parents, it has been before ob∣served, that every alteration in our manner of living should be brought about step by step, hasty transitions being always dangerous: and let this teach us to be cautious in our manner of admitting flesh into the meals of children.</P>
<P>After what has been advanced, and after having given you my opinion that it is yet time enough to suffer children to eat flesh, I now leave this very important point to the discretion of parents: however, permit me to recommend, that when flesh is first intro∣duced into their food, at whatever time it may be, this part of their diet should be al∣lowed them but sparingly; and a regard also should be paid to its quality.</P>
<P>The flesh of barn-door fowls, beef, mutton, and full-grown animals in general, is the best. Crammed poultry, calves, and house-fed lambs, kept up to fatten, are improper, be∣cause their juices yield by far less nourish∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="024796_0107_0FC88E319CEEB918"/>Hence, beef tea, and mutton broth, are preferable to those made from lamb or veal. The flesh also of such young fattened animals does not pass off weak stomachs so easily as the other.</P>
<P>High-seasoned gravies, and soups, made dishes, and salted meats, are ever to be avoid∣ed; though salt with their meats may be al∣lowed, for the reasons before given.</P>
<P>Although it is not meant to confine them at this age so strictly to bread, I am by no means for permitting too free a use of vegetables; being convinced, that some complaints of the bowels, in children more advanced in life, proceed from this error, and particularly worms: since, if the eggs of these insects are not taken in, together with these productions of the garden, on which they harbour and feed, yet this food at least affords a consider∣able quantity of slime, which, stagnating in the bowels, serves as an habitation for these pernicious little animals. This is my reason for allowing a little wine, now and then, to be given to children, and I am persuaded that I have seen its good effect. Care should be taken in the choice of vegetables; those of the mealy kind, that approach the nearest to bread, are to be preferred, such as potatoes, rice, &amp;c. Turnips are also good. Lettuces, and some few others, may, in moderation, be given to them, which your own prudence must point out.</P>
<P>The kitchen preparations of milk, such as
<PB N="117" REF="024796_0108_0FC88E3318EAEFD0"/>custards, blamange, white-pots, &amp;c. are ex∣ceedingly proper; and in this kind of food a greater variation may be indulged with less harm, being, for the most part, equally good and innocent. Salop mixed with milk, as mentioned in the last letter, may be granted as often as you please; and let it be remem∣bered, that it is the best way of giving that nutritious vegetable to children and inva∣lids.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Family Physician, p. 26.</NOTE> Eggs are good; and if the yelks be beaten up with warm milk, without boiling, they afford the best nourishment; yet, howe∣ver they are dressed, never suffer children to eat them, if the yelks be hard. Puddings in general are likewise good; but the most sim∣ple are best. Tarts and fruit-pies may be al∣lowed in moderation.</P>
<P>Shell-fish, and indeed most other kinds, may, now and then, be given; but the firmest are to be preferred. These are the most prudent directions that occur to my memory; but, after all, those are wisest who do not pamper young children with too great a variety.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble you with the curative part of diseases incident to children, that be∣ing altogether the concern of the physician; though it would give me a real pleasure to see such complaints treated of, in a masterly man∣ner, by some accurate observer of nature. This present system of nursing is intended on∣ly
<PB N="118" REF="024796_0109_0FC88E39E5C1D138"/>to manage children so as to prevent illness; and it has cost me no small pains to separate the two provinces, which, I hope, is effected to the satisfaction of my readers.</P>
<P>As to rhubarb, Gascoign's powder, magne∣sia, &amp;c. every mother's observations in some measure direct a proper use of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those parents who are at a loss upon these points may consult the Family Physician.—For Rhubarb, see p. 26,—Gascoign's Powder, p. 15—Magnesia, p. 19.</NOTE>; but when disorders do not give way to such sim∣ple methods, there is no time to be lost. I beg leave therefore to caution parents, who can obtain the advice of an experienced prac∣titioner, not to depend upon their own judg∣ments so far, as to suffer a continuance of complaints until they exceed the power of re∣lief. Delays are always dangerous, with re∣spect to disease, even in grown persons; but they are much more so in children, because they have not equal strength, and consequent∣ly sooner sink under bodily infirmities.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.
The necessity of cultivating the dispositions of children, to render them amiable and virtuous.</HEAD>
<P>CONFESS, ye worthy parents who know the height of earthly bliss, what temp∣tations in life could prevail upon you, after two or three years of age, to part from the dear dear offsprings of your mutual loves? Ye tender mothers, speak! I generously applaud an affection thus fondly rivetted in the fe∣male breast, and answer for you, ladies, that nothing upon earth could prove equivalent to such a loss. Ten thousand soft enchant∣ments bind them to your very souls.</P>
<P>This is the time in which their little fond endearments begin to operate; their every action is wonderfully engaging, and their pretty lisping tongues are one universal har∣mony. How exquisite is the delight to view their expanding minds—now catching sound, that quickly rises into sense, beaming a hap∣py prospect of future understanding! Here the volume of man begins—even at this time
<PB N="120" REF="024796_0111_0FC88E3D9D285B00"/>the fertile genius glows. How transporting is their sweet sensibility!</P>
<P>O powerful Nature, how unspeakably strong are thy ties! What heart, unless strangely perverted, can resist thy impulse? Hence arises the unspeakable difference of a laudable and virtuous passion, compared with an unchaste and vicious life. My God! that met should waste their health and for∣tunes in the stews with harlots, rioting in obscene and brutal pleasures, where the ra∣tional being is sunk even below pity!</P>
<P>Such conduct, in the cooler hours of thought, if ever they reflect, must cause no∣thing but anguish and remorse; on the con∣trary, by cultivating a chaste and honoura∣ble love, such wretched libertines might be∣come the joyful parents of little smiling fa∣milies. What an alternative is this! Be dumb, ye lawless rovers; it is an enjoyment beyond your comprehension, for virtuous minds alone can relish it.</P>
<P>What numbers of debauchees, in different climes and ages, worn out by guilty intem∣perance, mournfully lament their cursed fate, in not being blest with an heir to suc∣ceed to their half-ruined fortunes! Consi∣derate Providence! thus to disappoint them —for what but impurity and disease could they give birth to? Happy, thrice happy decree of Nature, that virtue alone can claim a smiling and a healthful progeny.</P>
<P>This is a theme worthy of an abler pen.
<PB N="121" REF="024796_0112_0FC88E3F1870AB08"/>How often has prattling innocence disarmed the rugged fierceness of a brutish nature, and melted down the rage of passion into more than female softness! How often, I say, by these means is a man of wrath insensibly dis∣solved into tenderness and love! I must tear myself away from the digression: should I indulge my zealous inclination, a volume of panegyric would fall short of the sub∣ject.</P>
<P>The human mind, in its infant opening, has been justly compared to a blank sheet of paper, susceptible of every impression: whence it may be supposed, children receive their prejudices and inclinations from the dispositions of those persons to whose care they are entrusted, in like manner as these letters convey the sentiments of the author.</P>
<P>That any children are born with vicious inclinations, I would not willingly believe. When I hear parents exclaiming against the bad dispositions of their own children, I can∣not help oftentimes secretly condemning the parents themselves, for introducing such vices into their habits. Instinct, even in brutes, produces a tenderness for their young—a harmless society amongst their neighbours— a passive fear towards their enemies—and violence seldom is discovered but against those animals which nature has appointed for their support. Can we then imagine that a worse than brutish fierceness should be natu∣rally discernible in our infant state?—that
<PB N="122" REF="024796_0113_0FC88E46EA40D178"/>spite, malice, anger, and revenge, such dia∣bolical passions, should tyrannize before we are capable of self-defence? The very sup∣position seems to me an arraignment of provi∣dence in the noblest part of the creation, and appears to be inconsistent with the justice of a benevolent Deity.</P>
<P>It therefore behoves every mother to be watchful of her own conduct, and perfectly satisfied of the dispositions of such servants as she entrusts with the care of her children, at this susceptible time of life; when even the more affectionately these persons treat them, the worse consequences are to be ap∣prehended, if their own tempers are not good: for as children are gratefully fond of those who use them kindly, they are by far the more likely to imbibe the bad qualities of an indulgent attendant; and, on the contrary, to profit by good examples.</P>
<P>Objects that attract the eyes are the first de∣lighting: the pleasures from hearing are the next. From sight and sound ideas take their gradual rise. Hence, a partial fondness is formed by children towards those whose pro∣vince it is to attend upon them: and for this reason they are more fond of their nurses, who are constantly prattling to them, than of parents neglectful of their infancy.</P>
<P>The want of duty and affection in children towards their parents, so much to be censur∣ed, and so generally complained of, often pro∣ceeds from this early mismanagement. The
<PB N="123" REF="024796_0114_0FC88E482EEC9E78"/>indifference also of too many parents towards their children, frequently owes its origin to depriving themselves of the enjoyments of their little ones at this engaging season of life. Even to an uninterested person, the expand∣ing of an infant mind is a delightful entertain∣ment; but to good parents, the pleasure and attachment must certainly prove exceedingly more agreeable and lasting. We must indeed pity those whom necessity deprives of this happy solace, but utterly condemn such whose inclinations drive their little nurslings from them. Unnatural and mistaken persons, who, if they are punished with undutiful children, suffer only in consequence of their own ne∣glect!</P>
<P>Would you, my tender and considerate ma∣trons, wish to see your children truly amia∣ble? Be then ever careful of yourselves. En∣deavour also as much as possible to prevent violent excess of passion in your husbands. This is a laudable task, and much more in the power of women than they generally ima∣gine. Trust: me, my fair-ones, truly prudent and good wives, by bending a little to the rug∣ged, headstrong, and boisterous dispositions of some husbands, may for the most part ci∣vilize them; and by their endearing and soothing manners, in spite of early vicious ha∣bits, compel them to a behaviour of tender∣ness and love. Thus, by the example of an engaging deportment on your part, you will soften their tempers, so as to render them
<PB N="124" REF="024796_0115_0FC88E499CAC35C0"/>good husbands, good fathers, good masters, and valuable members of society.</P>
<P>While, on the other hand, vindictive and peevish women not only forfeit this female importance, but too frequently estrange their husbands' affections from them: and need I say that this want of harmony and sincere friendship, between man and wife, is a dan∣gerous pattern for their children?</P>
<P>From the strong force of example, it be∣comes in a manner natural to the children of such persons to give an unbridled loose to eve∣ry impulse; nay, their emulation is soon enga∣ged to become equally tyrannical with their parents. On the contrary, where no such pre∣cedents are before their eyes—where impas∣sioned and youthful love keeps pace with sen∣timental friendship—where the polite and well-bred man shows a virtuous inclination towards his wife; and they both join in a proper regard for their children—how much reason have we to expect that their young and tender minds will be impressed with virtue! Nay, I dare aver, that, from this rectitude of behaviour, such parents will generally be re∣warded with good and dutiful children.</P>
<P>With respect to the management of chil∣dren, how shall we draw the line between in∣dulgence and severity? Although they are di∣ametrically opposite to each other, it is scarce∣ly possible to be done; nay, it cannot be de∣termined, so as to admit of absolute decision. Children necessarily require a different treat∣ment,
<PB N="125" REF="024796_0116_0FC88E4B64AA5658"/>even from their natural disposition, as it is usually called; and a conduct indulgent to some, will prove the greatest severity to others. Let it therefore be remembered, that our plan is to subdue the first irregular emo∣tions in the bud, so as to prevent them from rising into passions.</P>
<P>I would, then, at all events, earnestly re∣commend temper and forbearance to those who have the government of their infant years. Kind treatment, good words, and a generous encouragement, to most dispositions, will prove equal to every thing that you require of them; and if they can be conquer∣ed by such laudable and gentle means, you not only carry the first points in the most eli∣gible manner, but accustom them also to an obliging behaviour, and excite their emula∣tion to endeavour to please.</P>
<P>Carefully therefore observe every emotion that is praise-worthy, and let a reward accom∣pany it; for the encouragement of one virtu∣ous impulse will have a much happier effect than the correction of a hundred faults.</P>
<P>Such are the impressions necessary to form a virtuous mind, and they will certainly grow up into their habits. On the contrary, where children's dispositions are untoward; if they be subdued by harsh words, threats, and chas∣tisement, how are their tempers ruffled by such treatment!—and what is to be expected, but that they consider severity and violence as the only means for them to obtain any
<PB N="126" REF="024796_0117_0FC88E537399AFB0"/>point over others, whom they may have a future occasion to contend with? What a wretched foundation of perpetual disquietude!</P>
<P>Where reproof is necessary, mortification is undoubtedly the best means of correction; and let an acknowledgment of the fault prove the means of reconciliation.</P>
<LG>
<L>"And, next to <HI>right,</HI> pray condescend</L>
<L>"T' acknowledge doing <HI>wrong,</HI> my friend."</L>
</LG>
<P>This humbles them in their own opinions; it necessarily begets shame; and before a dispo∣sition is hardened into vice, shame will always produce amendment,</P>
<P>Moreover, in this case there is no object for resentment, that great support of pride; consequently it initiates them to consider tho∣roughly their own conduct, and of course to dwell upon the cause for which they are thus humbled. What, therefore, can more tho∣roughly conduce to render children amiable as they grow up, than the accustoming of them to a retrospection of their own behaviour, and to an inward condemnation of their faults, of which their making a concession is sufficient proof?</P>
<P>Even in the most trifling promise a parent can make to children, I most earnestly recom∣mend that it be religiously adhered to; other∣wise you teach them a shocking lesson of de∣ceit.</P>
<P>For equivocation and falsity, their mortifi∣cations ought to be exceedingly severe; but
<PB N="127" REF="024796_0118_0FC88E54DEEA5E20"/>in every point where you find it necessary to correct be sure you make them truly sen∣sible of their error: at the same time, in every misdemeanor, be thoroughly satisfied that it proceeds from a culpable emotion, be∣fore you reprove it; for it sometimes falls out, that wrong actions may proceed from laudable intentions.</P>
<P>How often in life does it happen, that ex∣ceptions are taken against a friend, who is at that very time actually meditating the angry person's advantage; and yet, perhaps, appear∣ances so blind him that he thinks of nothing but revenge, until an eclaircissement takes place, when he as passionately reproaches himself for his ingratitude! The case is still harder with children; for, when they are pu∣nished wrongfully, it is seldom that they have it in their power to clear themselves; and further, they may probably suppose their own good emotions to be the guilty cause, and thereby endeavour to suppress a rising virtue.</P>
<P>Indulgence over much is liable to produce effects equally bad, as extreme severity; for as the latter inures them to every act of vio∣lence, so the former encourages the breach of every civil duty that thwarts their selfish in∣clinations.</P>
<P>But the greatest misconduct of all arises from these two opposite ways of management being united together, in the widest extreme; when one moment the little creature's bones are almost broken for a fault of which it is
<PB N="128" REF="024796_0119_0FC88E5668C3D250"/>scarcely sensible, and the next moment it is fondly cherished to reconcile it to the mista∣ken parent; and in return, not improbably, indulged in exercising its rage upon toys, in torturing birds, dogs, cats, and such-like do∣mestic animals, as infant tyranny can lord it over; and permitted also at the window to sport with the lives of little buzzing insects, that fall a sacifice to wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>The child who is fondly and foolishly in∣dulged, promises only a melancholy prospect; but where, on the other hand, as is too gene∣rally seen, an occasional severity inures it to cruelty, the disposition is inevitably ruined. The consequences of such severity and such indulgence fill the mind with every disagree∣able apprehension: and indeed, what can they produce but inordinate desires, brutish rage, and violence?</P>
<P>Those parents who are happy enough to subdue their own choler, and thereby set their children proper examples, will have very lit∣tle cause for complaint against them: on the contrary, such as are perpetually quarrelling with each other, with their children, servants, and every body around them, cannot expect much peace and comfort from their rising fa∣milies. But if they will take this friendly ad∣vice, to correct their own errors only once, for every hundredth time they chastise others, it will probably bring about some amendment in themselves; and the force of their example must surely produce the best effect upon their household.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="024796_0120_0FC88E580C5CD350"/>We have now conducted children through the different stages of helpless infancy, and gradually introduced them, though as yet but junior characters, upon the grand theatre of life; where the happy effects of such careful regulations are generally to be distinguished. As to literary improvements, they properly come under another jurisdiction, and there∣fore claim your future consideration. Never∣theless, a condescending obligingness, a sweet affability, an unassuming sensibility, and a mo∣dest deportment, ever denote the proper edu∣cation of a female mind. In like manner, pru∣dence, abstemiousness, and virtuous disposi∣tions in men, most frequently proceed from the good impressions of childhood. Severe stripes, and harsh usage, add fuel to a turbu∣lent and revengeful spirit, and too frequently render a sullen boy malicious: on the other hand, the indulged and spoiled child common∣ly turns out an abandoned libertine.</P>
<P>Thus, my fair-ones, you may easily disco∣ver how much society is interested in your motherly conduct, at this early time; "for, as the twig is bent, the tree will grow;" and the seeds of iniquity, in those dispositions where virtue is not planted, unavoidably, as it were, take root, and spring up without much cultivation.</P>
<P>Every notorious vice shows an utter con∣tempt for the moral duties of life; and the man whose character it infamous, seems but little to regard the opinion of others: there∣fore
<PB N="130" REF="024796_0121_0FC88E60F1ADBE30"/>the good fame and chastity of women be∣come his ridicule and sport. Such men are continually assaulting their virtue, and aiming at their seduction. Of consequence, the dar∣ling, who has never been curbed in the early impulses of erroneous inclinations, will prove to be very little capable of subduing the tem∣pestuous passions of youth; which will not only hurry him on to his own ruin, but also too generally occasion the disgrace, infamy, and destruction of many unfortunate young women.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, how greatly the happiness and prosperity of the fair sex are affected by the sensual misconduct of ours; insomuch that, in the present instance, women as well as men must fall degraded.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.
Of milk—Its properties examined—the different kinds of milk compared with each other—and their parti∣cular virtues explained.</HEAD>
<P>MILK has been recommended, in several letters, as the proper food for infants; and in the fourteenth and fifteenth, it is again spoken of, as being equally necessary for inva∣lids and aged persons. It shall, therefore, be the business of this letter to examine so far into the qualities of milk, and into the milk of different animals, as may enable us to de∣termine what kind of milk is, upon different occasions, to be preferred; which will take in every thing, not elsewhere observed upon this subject.</P>
<P>Milk was before remarked to be a kind of white blood, prepared by the mother for the support of her young; so far we may speak of it in general terms.</P>
<P>In different animals, therefore, it is reason∣able to suppose, and fact confirms our suppo∣sition, that the qualities of milk are also dif∣ferent: hence, by first examining into its ge∣neral properties, and, from those principles,
<PB N="132" REF="024796_0123_0FC88E649A53D288"/>setting forth the peculiar variations in the milk of different animals, we shall arrive at the desired conclusion.</P>
<P>In milk, by stepping into the dairy, we may discern three principal component parts. Af∣ter it has remained some time in an undisturb∣ed state, the cream floats upon the surface. It is the least in quantity, though most nourish∣ing, of an oily balsamic substance, and inflam∣mable in its nature, as the butter, which is made from it, plainly demonstrates.</P>
<P>A lady, before whom I once made some ex∣periments, asked me why the cream floated upon the surface; for being, continued she, the thickest part, ought it not rather to sink to the bottom? I told her, it was the thickest part, to be sure, but at the same time it was also the lightest; specifically so, as oil is light∣er than water, and therefore rises to the top.</P>
<P>The cream being taken off, the remaining milk appears bluish, and thinner than before; and when thus robbed of its thick, creamy part, it consequently is not so smooth to the palate.</P>
<P>On the addition of runnet, or indeed any acid, a separation of the two remaining parts soon takes place, and we discover the curd. This, being the heaviest, when separated from the whey, falls to the bottom. It is the least valuable part of the milk, glutinous in its na∣ture, and composed of the most earthy parti∣cles, being also of an astringent quality.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="024796_0124_0FC88E6B7017C098"/>The third and only remaining part, being the whey of the milk, is the largest in quanti∣ty, of a diluting and cleansing property.</P>
<P>Let us now by this standard compare the different kinds of milk, mostly in use with us, and apply them to the purposes for which they seem best calculated.</P>
<P>The human milk, when drawn from the breast, has exactly the same bluish appearance as cow's milk when the cream is taken off. It affords very little cream, and but a small quan∣tity of curd; therefore the whey constitutes the chief part: but the more healthy the wo∣man is, and particularly if between the age of twenty and thirty, the more her milk abounds with rich creamy balsam, and the more it also contains of the curd or earthy particles; pro∣bably from her constitution being, at this time, in full vigour, and the digestive powers therefore more perfect.</P>
<P>These observations will point out the best substitute, where the breast is denied, and will likewise direct those, who prefer wet-nursing, in the choice of the properest person; for there is, in my opinion, an equal objection against the milk of a very young girl, as against that of a woman almost past child∣bearing. The cleansing quality, before taken notice of, in a breast of new milk, will also, together with reason and experience, show the propriety of recommending those women who have not been long delivered.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="024796_0125_0FC88E6CDF741408"/>Ass's milk is generally allowed to be the nearest to the human, and, according to the above experiments, we find it so, abounding mostly with whey, and having little of the cream or curd in it. Hence, after a severe fit of illness, where the body is much emaciated, and the stomach weak, or where the blood is loaded with sharp, acrid humours, the cleans∣ing quality of ass's milk deserves a preference to that of any other animal which is used for this purpose. In consumptive cases, or where there is a slow, habitual fever, it is justly to be preferred, until such time as the constitution may have gained a little strength, when the more nourishing ought to supply its place.</P>
<P>Mare's milk is esteemed to be much the same as ass's; but this, indeed, is in very lit∣tle use.</P>
<P>Cow's milk comes next under considera∣tion. This appears to be the richest and most nourishing of any of the brutes' milk here mentioned. It abounds with a great deal of cream; for, after standing twelve hours, and being skimmed, it appears equal to any other milk. It contains also a large quantity of curd; and, after all, even the whey is by far more nutritious than any other.</P>
<P>We observed that ass's milk, in the experi∣ments, mostly resembles the human. Why then not prefer that to cow's milk, for the food of children? I do not totally deny the use of this milk for that purpose; but in our part of the country, it is very expensive, and
<PB N="135" REF="024796_0126_0FC88E6E9D9BB258"/>cannot be obtained in any large quantity; for which reason it would be impracticable to bring it into general use.</P>
<P>There is, likewise, another reason which inclines me to give a preference to cow's milk; for, notwithstanding the similarity of human milk to that of asses, the first may well be supposed most strengthening, since women usually feed on animal as well as vegetable diet, while the brutes we speak of are confi∣ned entirely to vegetables. Whence, if we substitute ass's milk, we shall fall short of the nourishment nature designed for us; and therefore for a young child, who requires a heartening diet, the milk of cows, in my opi∣nion, is preferable, as the richness of it is, in some measure, adequate to the supposed dif∣ference in the qualities of human milk, and that of other animals.</P>
<P>The milk of sheep and goats consists mostly of the curd, or earthy particles: hence, where the blood vessels are injured by acrid hu∣mours, and frequent bleedings happen from this cause, or where children are subject to the rickets, from a weakness of the bones, that milk, which abounds mostly with the curd, or cheesy part, seems best calculated to answer the intention; its earthy, mucilagin∣ous, and astringent property having the great∣est tendency to heal such ruptured vessels, and to give a firmness to the bones: but as these milks possess less of the cleansing power, it will, in most cases, particularly in bleed∣ings,
<PB N="136" REF="024796_0127_0FC88E709845EDA0"/>be proper to use the more attenuating kind first.</P>
<P>We have now examined the different milks familiar to us, and, from their different pro∣perties, pointed out the end each sort seems best calculated to answer; whence every per∣son will quickly be determined which to give the preference to in particular complaints.</P>
<P>When any one first begins to eat milk, es∣pecially if a free liver, it may probably purge a little; but such inconveniencies will most commonly be removed, by accustoming the constitution to the use of it; and boiling the milk will in a great measure prevent this ef∣fect. I have always remarked, that those, who, by reason of a pampered appetite, com∣plain of milk and vegetables being windy, and not agreeing with them, are the very per∣sons who most require such a diet; for it is the debauched state of the stomach and bow∣els, that occasions their uneasiness, which this regimen seems the most likely to correct.</P>
<P>I have recommended a little salt to be mix∣ed with milk, before it is given to children, if they are apt to throw it up curdled, and shall mention the experiment which induced me to give that advice; since it is equally worthy the attention of grown persons, some of whom make this an objection to their eat∣ing milk; as I am inclined to believe such precaution will render it agreeable to most constitutions.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="024796_0128_0FC88E76E25A5F60"/>I put two ounces of milk, warm as it came from the cow, into a tea-cup, with a little common salt; I put the same quantity, of the like warmth, into another tea-cup, without salt; then dropping a very little distilled vi∣negar into each, a hard curd presently appear∣ed in that milk which had no salt in it, while the other with the salt was scarcely altered.</P>
<P>I tried the same experiment again, with a large tea-spoonful of runnet, and observed the milk, which had the salt in it, to continue in its fluid state, while the other grew thick and turbid, and almost instantly separated in∣to curds and whey. This last experiment an∣swered the best, and is much more to our purpose than the former. From these hints, it seems reasonable to conclude, that salt, ta∣ken with milk, might equally prevent the too hasty curdling of it, where there is a great acidity in the stomach; in which case, the curdled milk, having too quickly assumed a solidity, becomes troublesome; and because it is not as yet designed to pass into the bow∣els for the office of nourishment, a part of this intolerable load is generally discharged by vomiting. Moreover, the stimulating qua∣lity of salt will greatly assist a weak digestion, and thereby facilitate the passage of the milk from the stomach into the bowels; and from experience, in recommending it to children who used to throw up their milk in a curdled state, I am convinced of its utility.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="024796_0129_0FC88E781FFC9940"/>In all cases, where infirmities or age re∣quire a prudent regimen, I have directed a similar care to that of dieting children. Milk, therefore, comprehends a very material part of such food; and I am fully persuaded, that, if it were more universally used, the world in general would be greatly benefited. I do not, however, mean to be understood, that I debar those from a reasonable quantity of ani∣mal food, who are capable of digesting it. But such as are emaciated by illness, or have the misfortune to labour under gouty com∣plaints; such, also, as are consumptively in∣clined, or those who have crazy, infirm con∣stitutions, and are subject to an habitual fe∣verish disposition, will do right to eat flesh only once in the day, and, for the rest of their nourishment, to live almost, if not altoge∣ther, upon milk.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.
The sick chamber—with directions also for invalids.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now, my dear ladies, entering into the sick chamber, in which, as well as in the nursery, many amiable characters may be drawn. Here, the conjugal affection of a wife is laudably displayed—the tender love of a mother fondly exerts itself—the gratitude and duty of a daughter are conspi∣cuous—the good sister also endears herself to a worthy brother—and female friendship wears a thousand additional charms!</P>
<P>Let us picture a truly tender and good wife, in this exalted character! Let us suppose, that she has deserved recompense, by restoring to her chaste and longing arms the distinguished choice of her youthful love, ennobled by a generous sympathy of virtuous inclinations!</P>
<P>Let us imagine this happy man perfectly re∣covered from a dangerous and painful illness; to which recovery her unwearied attendance proved greatly instrumental: his mind, like∣wise, impressed with every thought a con∣sciousness
<PB N="140" REF="024796_0131_0FC88E7B39376278"/>of such an obligation can inspire! Behold the husband admiring her transcendant excellency; while the honest tear, perchance, trickling down his check, betrays the big e∣motion of a grateful heart. "She, on her part, with looks of cordial love, awhile in si∣lent rapture glows—then on bended knees adores her Maker"—returns most fervid thanks, for that her prayer of sorrow has been heard, that He has graciously restored the husband and the father! How great must be their reciprocal felicity!</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to those instructions which are necessary for the proper execution of this friendly office. There is a certain im∣pertinence frequently proceeding from lauda∣ble motives, which, nevertheless is totally culpable: I mean, the desire of our acquaint∣ance to visit a sick chamber. It is oftentimes, I acknowledge, the effect of tenderness, ill-placed, and a real concern, imprudently ex∣pressed. In general, those visits should not be permitted. I every day experience the ill ef∣fects of chem. When, indeed, a patient is up∣on the recovery, and capable of sitting up three or four hours at a time, the company of a friend, who knows how far to engage with propriety in conversation, is a sweetly re∣freshing solace: but locks, bolts, or bars can∣not be too strong to keep prating gossips, at all times, out of a sick chamber.</P>
<P>During a fever, it is a load sufficient for any patient to bear the disease. Quietude on
<PB N="141" REF="024796_0132_0FC88E82A0B38D30"/>his part, and silence on the part of those about him, ought universally to be imposed. It is not a time for the mind to be engaged either in the pursuit of business or pleasure.</P>
<P>This leads me to a consideration of the ut∣most importance; and as I am not speaking as a physician, but as a friend, it comes pro∣perly within that province, and I hope it will be seriously attended to by every reader. If it is now prejudicial for any one to think, even of the common concerns of life, how much more injurious must it prove, to have the mind engaged in that great work of set∣tling, forever, our worldly affairs!</P>
<P>Would you, my rational friends, wish to be freed from an intolerable burden, never postpone this important business until you are upon a bed of sickness. Not to say how inca∣pable the judgment at such a time will often prove, perhaps to the detriment of some de∣serving friend, or not unlikely to the confu∣sion of a whole family, the very mention of it from any one about us, or the conscious necessity in ourselves, must exceedingly hur∣ry and depress the spirits, when tranquillity and support are essentially necessary: for what can such an idea convey, but death?— A last will and testament is one of the most so∣lemn acts of life, and ought never to be post∣poned till the agonizing moments of death.</P>
<P>The chamber, proper for a patient, is of no small moment. There ought to be a free cir∣culation of air, whether it be in the summer
<PB N="142" REF="024796_0133_0FC88E841D4F9210"/>or winter. I never would have any person confined to a room without a chimney; it is equally necessary in the warmer season for the purpose of discharging the offensive va∣pours of disease, as it is in cold weather, by means of a little fire, to bring the air to a due temperament, which also contributes to re∣move the like offence.</P>
<P>To you, my female friends, this concern of nursing belongs. It is an important, and oftentimes a fatiguing task. I would willingly engage you in it upon principle, and there∣fore shall endeavour to show that man and woman were born for each other's support and comfort. Their respective dependence upon each other is, undoubtedly, the wise or∣dination of Omniscience.</P>
<P>I cannot speak of this mutual obligation, without being mindful of the beautiful pas∣sage in our immortal Milton's Paradise Lost, book the fourth, where Eve gives Adam an account of herself; and I shall introduce the description at length, as a quotation from this author can never be deemed impertinent. Let us attend to the mother of mankind!—</P>
<LG>
<L>To whom thus Eve reply'd. O thou! for whom</L>
<L>And from whom I was form'd; flesh of thy flesh;</L>
<L>And without whom am to no end; my guide</L>
<L>And head! what thou hast said, is just and right.</L>
<L>For we to him indeed all praises owe,</L>
<L>And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy</L>
<L>So far the happier lot, enjoying thee</L>
<L>Pre-eminent by so much odds; while thou</L>
<L>Like consort to thyself canst no where find.</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="024796_0134_0FC88E8617FF6AD8"/>That day I oft remember, when from sleep</L>
<L>I first awak'd, and found myself repos'd</L>
<L>Under a shade, on flowers; much wond'ring where</L>
<L>And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.</L>
<L>Not distant far from thence, a murmuring sound</L>
<L>Of waters issued from a cave, and spread</L>
<L>Into a liquid plain, then stood unmov'd,</L>
<L>Pure as th' expanse of heav'n: I thither went,</L>
<L>With inexperienc'd thought, and laid me down</L>
<L>On the green bank, to look into the clear</L>
<L>Smooth lake, that to me seem'd another sky.</L>
<L>As I bent down to look, just opposite</L>
<L>A shape within the wat'ry gleam appear'd,</L>
<L>Bending to look on me; I started back,</L>
<L>It started back; but pleas'd, I soon return'd:</L>
<L>Pleas'd it return'd as soon, with answering looks</L>
<L>Of sympathy, and love: there I had fix'd</L>
<L>Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire,</L>
<L>Had not a voice thus warn'd me, "What thou seest,</L>
<L>"What there thou seest, fair creature, is thyself;</L>
<L>"With thee it came and goes: but, follow me,</L>
<L>"And I will bring thee where no shadow stays</L>
<L>"Thy coming, and thy soft embraces; he</L>
<L>"Whose image thou art: him thou shalt enjoy</L>
<L>"Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear</L>
<L>"Multitudes like thyself, and thence be call'd</L>
<L>"Mother of human race." What could I do,</L>
<L>But follow strait, invisibly thus led,</L>
<L>Till I espy'd thee? fair indeed, and tall,</L>
<L>Under a plantan; yet, methought, less fair,</L>
<L>Less winning soft, less amiably mild,</L>
<L>Than that smooth watry image: back I turn'd;</L>
<L>Thou following cry'dst aloud, Return, fair Eve;</L>
<L>Whom fly'st thou? whom thou fly'st, of him thou art,</L>
<L>His flesh, his bone; to give thee being, I lent</L>
<L>Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart,</L>
<L>Substantial life, to have thee by my side</L>
<L>Henceforth an individual solace dear:</L>
<L>Part of my soul, I seek thee; and thee claim,</L>
<L>My other half!—With that, thy gentle hand</L>
<L>Seiz'd mine; I yielded; and from that time see</L>
<L>How beauty is excell'd by manly grace</L>
<L>And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="144" REF="024796_0135_0FC88E874F120458"/>To illustrate my argument of our mutual dependence, I must beg leave to indulge my∣self, and hope likewise to entertain my read∣er, with another quotation from the same au∣thor. Adam, desirous of retaining the angel Raphael, relates to him what he remembers, since his own creation, and among other things, that which is to our purpose, his first meeting and nuptials with Eve. After re∣counting his dream, wherein he was inform∣ed of her creation, he proceeds:—</P>
<LG>
<L>I wak'd</L>
<L>To find her, or forever to deplore</L>
<L>Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure.</L>
<L>When out of hope, behold her! not far off;</L>
<L>Such as I saw her in my dream, adorn'd</L>
<L>With what all earth or heav'n could bestow</L>
<L>To make her amiable; on she came,</L>
<L>Led by her heav'nly Maker (though unseen),</L>
<L>And guided by his voice; nor uninform'd</L>
<L>Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:</L>
<L>Grace was in all her steps, heav'n in her eye,</L>

<L>I over-joy'd, could not forbear aloud.—</L>
<L>This turn hath made amends! Thou hast fulfill'd</L>

<L>Extracted: for this cause he shall forego</L>
<L>Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;</L>
<L>And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.</L>
<L>She heard me thus; and though divinely brought,</L>
<L>Yet innocence, and virgin modesty,</L>
<L>Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,</L>
<L>That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won,</L>
<L>Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd,</L>
<L><PB N="145" REF="024796_0136_0FC88E88987104E0"/>The more desirable: or, to say all,</L>
<L>Nature herself (though pure of sinful thought)</L>
<L>Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd;</L>
<L>I follow'd her; she what was honour knew,</L>
<L>And, with obsequious majesty, approved</L>
<L>My pleaded reason.—To the nuptial bow'r</L>
<L>I led her, blushing like the morn: all heav'n,</L>
<L>And happy constellations, on that hour</L>
<L>Shed their selectest influence: the earth</L>
<L>Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill:</L>
<L>Joyous the birds; fresh gales, and gentle airs,</L>
<L>Whisper'd it to the woods, and from their wings</L>
<L>Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrubs,</L>
<L>Disporting! till the amorous bird of night</L>
<L>Sung spousal, and bid haste the ev'ning star</L>
<L>On his hill-top, to light the bridal lamp.</L>
<L>Thus I have told thee all my state, and brought</L>
<L>My story to the sum of earthly bliss,</L>
<L>Which I enjoy: and must confess to find</L>
<L>In all things else delight indeed; but such</L>
<L>As, us'd or not, works in the mind no change,</L>
<L>Nor vehement desire; the delicacies</L>
<L>I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flow'rs,</L>
<L>Walks, and the melody of birds: but here</L>
<L>Far otherwise! transported I behold,</L>
<L>Transported touch: here passion first I felt,</L>
<L>Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else</L>
<L>Superior and unmov'd: here only weak,</L>
<L>Against the charm of beauty's pow'rful glance.</L>
<L>Or Nature fail'd in me, and left some part</L>
<L>Not proof enough such object to sustain;</L>
<L>Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps</L>
<L>More than enough: at least, on her bestow'd</L>
<L>Too much of ornament: in outward show,</L>
<L>Elaborate; of inward, less exact.</L>
<L>For well I understand, in the prime end</L>
<L>Of Nature, her th' inferior; in the mind,</L>
<L>And inward faculties; which most excel:</L>
<L>In outward also her resembling less</L>
<L>His image who made both; and less expressing</L>
<L>The character of that dominion giv'n</L>
<L><PB N="146" REF="024796_0137_0FC88E8B1DB2B4F8"/>O'er other creatures. Yet, when I approach</L>
<L>Her loveliness, so absolute she seems,</L>
<L>And in herself complete, so well to know</L>
<L>Her own; that what she wills to do, or say,</L>
<L>Seems wisest, virtuousest, discretest, best:</L>
<L>All higher knowledge in her presence falls</L>
<L>Degraded; Wisdom, in discourse with her,</L>

<P>How exquisitely charming are these descrip∣tions! what valuable portraits of the first hu∣man pair! The lines elegantly strong! the colourings beautifully rich! Then again the amazingly soft and delicate touches of this great master of the human feelings, wherever we cast our eyes, enchantingly appear!</P>
<P>What can more fully show our mutual de∣pendence!—So amiably engaging to each other, our first parents, in this poem, are de∣scribed, that the labour of either, whereby the other was benefited, must prove a real pleasure. What an example for the encou∣ragement of matrimony!—O that we could more generally display the character of Adam! Then you, my fair-ones, would strive more ardently, in gentleness and love, to imitate this first of women.</P>
<P>If man would endeavour to curb unlaw∣ful inclinations, cherishing and comforting the wife of his bosom; if he would fondly
<PB N="147" REF="024796_0138_0FC88E8D18B24BD0"/>regard her charms and virtues; what emu∣lation must such a conduct excite in every female breast—to give honour and dignity to her husband! Let men but begin the refor∣mation, and I will be accountable for the right behaviour of the generality of your sex.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the culpableness of man will not excuse the folly of woman; and this piece of advice, from a real friend, the la∣dies will do well to observe.</P>
<P>I know my fair pupils will tell me, that al∣though a husband may have follies and vices, yet, if he is but a sensible man, they can over∣look them, and cheerfully submit to their lord and master—but who, say they, can be governed by a fool?</P>
<P>When once a woman has drawn her lot, it is not only her duty, but the height of po∣licy, to make the best of it. Let her choice prove ever so disagreeable, or supposing that she was led into such a marriage by the cruel compulsion of her friends, still honour and obedience are required on her part. By giv∣ing importance to an husband, (even those husbands we are now speaking of, for others will command it) a wife merits, and gener∣ally obtains, praise and adoration, not only from him, but from the whole world.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the mistaken she, who in company degrades, and upon every occasion tauntingly reproaches her husband, thus making him, poor man, the contemptible
<PB N="148" REF="024796_0139_0FC88E92EC7AD740"/>but to level her triumphant shafts at; not∣withstanding she imagines her own wit and superior talents are happily displayed, to the entertainment and admiration of her friends; believe me, ladies, by those very friends she must ever be condemned; and let her merits, in other respects, be ever so great, this culpable part of her behaviour they most assuredly despise.</P>
<P>But to return from our present wander∣ing, which I intentionally followed as an en∣couragement to virtue, a consistency of cha∣racter, and mutual love; being convinced that these qualifications will make even a constant attendance in a sick chamber not al∣together unpleasing. Now then let us pursue our further care, where female tenderness can assuage the severest bodily pains, and render the greatest misfortunes of life at least supportable.</P>
<P>In every disorder, physic and good nursing ought to go hand in hand; and I am the more desirous of giving my opinion with respect to good nursing, as I mean to op∣pose it to poor and bad nursing, which has been too much the unlucky and mistaken practice of the sick chamber: for under the vague idea of inflammation, and inflamma∣tory diseases, even bread and water have been sometimes accounted too great a sup∣port for the patient. But with pleasure, we now see physicians act upon more rational principles; and I would wish to convince
<PB N="149" REF="024796_0140_0FC88E93DAD3E798"/>you, ladies, whose province it is, of the propriety of supporting patients under every disease.</P>
<P>The sick chamber is our subject; but it is also to be understood, that the precau∣tions here laid down will prove equally ne∣cessary, where invalids are permitted to at∣tend to the common affairs of life; for, with∣out a prudent regulation in our method of living, few constitutional or long-existing ails can be removed, or even rendered in any degree light, and easily to be borne; but I am clearly convinced, that it is very possi∣ble for many infirm persons to pass comfor∣tably through a tolerable length of life, and, at last, to pay an easy debt to nature.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be swelling this letter to a very great bulk, were I to enter into a particular account of the diet proper for invalids. The reader who is under the necessity of observing such a prudent restraint, is there∣fore referred to my observations upon diet, in the Fa∣mily Physician: some hints of this kind are there thrown out, which he may probably consider as not al∣together unworthy of his attention.</NOTE></P>
<P>The observations, therefore, upon chil∣dren and aged persons, are equally applica∣ble to those who, by ungoverned passions and intemperance, have ruined their health; for in either of these cases, where the bodily powers are enervated, and the digestion weakened, a proper, light, and nourishing diet is as necessary to restore health, as it is to support the young, and preserve the aged.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="024796_0141_0FC88E967400B2C8"/>Every disease is to be considered as a de∣viation from health; and a fever is the means made use of by Nature to free the body from something that is noxious. Ought, we, therefore, to counteract her in this her own great work? Ought we not rather cau∣tiously and prudently, like a valuable hand∣maid, to tend upon her movements, and generously support her in the design she aims at? Surely this appears to every one rea∣sonable.</P>
<P>However, where there is a fever, or great weakness of the body, or where the body itself is emaciated, an alteration from the common manner of living is certainly neces∣sary. To these points, therefore, I shall con∣fine my advice, as other considerations come under a medical direction.</P>
<P>Few persons are constrained to keep their chambers, who are not troubled with great loss of strength, or feverish complaints; either as the first cause, or as symptoms ac∣companying other diseases. Supposing then these circumstances, the constitution being thus reduced, or Nature labouring to throw off a disease, the body certainly requires a nourishment of the most simple kind; by simple, I mean easy of digestion, but let it at the same time be comfortable. The stomach and bowels must, of necessity, be equally af∣fected with the other parts of the body, and consequently unable to perform their offices upon the common supports of life.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="024796_0142_0FC88E979AF5C390"/>Animal food, therefore, is particularly to be forbidden: and I am sorry to be obliged to blame the fondness of parents, and those who assist in sick chambers, for too frequent∣ly indulging patients thus unwarrantably. Give me leave to observe, if flesh be permit∣ted during the existence of a fever, or when the body, by illness, is exceedingly weaken∣ed and emaciated, from the incapacity of the digestive faculties, the nourishment produced must be imperfect, crude, offensive; and con∣sequently, instead of a support, must add an additional weight to the disease.</P>
<P>But, at the same time, let it be remember∣ed, that, as a support is necessary, good broths, wine whey, jellies, panado, a beverage of wine and water, &amp;c. are to be discretionally permitted; and indeed the inclination of the sick person will generally determine the pro∣priety of these things; for where they are hurtful, an universal loathing of them com∣monly takes place.</P>
<P>These, and such like sippings, being easy of digestion, are not only the properest for a dis∣eased state of the stomach and bowels, but they also supply the body with a necessary nourishment to uphold its strength under the disorder. It is a point at present acknowledg∣ed by all good physicians. It is, in my opinion, a circumstance minutely to be dwelt upon; for woful experience has often convinced me, that the rashness of an obstinate nurse, in one unlucky hour, has counteracted the opera∣tions
<PB N="152" REF="024796_0143_0FC88E99D849BE30"/>of a well-regulated, and otherwise suc∣cessful, regimen.</P>
<P>Although I would debar patients from ani∣mal food, where there is a feverish complaint, nevertheless I do most earnestly recommend a generous, but discretionary, support of easily digested and comfortable liquid nourishment, in every fever. I mean, that barley-water, mint and balm tea, with such like drinks, will not sufficiently support the strength of a pa∣tient under any kind of fever, even for a few days, and much less for as many weeks. As to the distinctions of inflammatory, nervous, and putrid, it is not my business to enter upon them here; but supposing the fever to be in∣flammatory, the patient is, or ought to be, con∣fined to bed, and a breathing sweat encoura∣ged. Will not then an already almost digested and innocent liquid nourishment answer the physician's aim, at the same time that it sup∣ports the patient? Experience has convinced me of its utility. I cannot help, therefore, strongly recommending it; for I am too ap∣prehensive that many lives are daily lost for want of this necessary support.</P>
<P>I am labouring to prevent that mistaken care, which is commonly called starving a disease, and to set aside the dreadful appre∣hension that a little innocent nourishment gi∣ven to a person in a fever, is still adding fuel to the fire. By these errors the ablest assist∣ance is oftentimes baffled, to the cost of the patient; and, not unlikely, to the disgrace of
<PB N="153" REF="024796_0144_0FC88EA057219D98"/>a worthy practitioner. Be assured, that it is more eligible to endeavour to support, and build up again, a shaken, diseased, and totter∣ing frame, than to attempt to pull it down. Never let this be done but by the express com∣mand of wisdom and experience; for it is a serious affair at all times to deprive a tene∣ment of its foundation and strength. It is much to be wished, as it surely must prove a general advantage, that physicians would more particularly direct the regimen of diet in sick chambers.</P>
<P>The punctuality of nurses, and those who attend upon the sick, in the administering of medicines, is of no small import. It is a cruel reflexion upon the honest part of the profes∣sion, that practitioners consult the number of their fees, or the length of their bills, more than the health of their patients. Such ini∣quity is but very seldom, I hope, if ever, prac∣tised; and as few persons employ any but those of whom they entertain a good opinion, let me warn you, as a friend, not to indulge a suspicion which betrays a mean soul, and most probably will, at some time or other, pro∣duce fatal consequences to yourselves. Great relief, nay, oftentimes, perfect health, is as∣suredly to be obtained by the help of medi∣cine. Great evil, nay, too frequently, certain death, ensues from a jealous contempt, or wanton neglect of this salutary aid.</P>
<P>I must speak of another mistake, with re∣gard to the management of linen. A patient
<PB N="154" REF="024796_0145_0FC88EA2C7FE7A70"/>cannot be hurt by changing wet, filthy, and offensive linen, for that which is dry, clean, and comfortable; provided this be done with proper care, not to give cold during the time of shifting the clothes. Linen which is per∣fectly dry and clean is, at all times, to be preferred to that which has been used; for the latter may have absorbed offensive va∣pours, of which the former must be entirely free. Against this observation, I am convinc∣ed, there are great prejudices; nevertheless those who employ their reason but for a mo∣ment, will see the propriety of the present caution.</P>
<P>A free succession of air is essentially necessa∣ry not only to carry off the offensive vapours of disease, but also to the recovery of the pa∣tient; nay, even to the preservation of those who attend upon the sick. It is true that a fire is proper in cold weather, for reasons be∣fore given; but at the same time the cham∣ber ought to be no more than comfortably warm; for where this degree of heat is ex∣ceeded, faint sweats are likely to exhaust the patient's strength, whereby he sinks, perhaps, under a disease, through which, probably, he might otherwise have been supported.</P>
<P>Having now cautioned you against the most material errors, which, at present, occur to my memory, I will beg leave to observe what poor creatures men in general are, when ne∣cessity confines them to a sick chamber! If we reflect upon this scene, ought we to complain
<PB N="155" REF="024796_0146_0FC88EA3A4487F78"/>of the spirits of women? I scarcely ever find a man, in sickness, support himself so well as a woman does. Men are, for the most part, depressed in their spirits, to the greatest de∣gree, when they are ill. Be it then with gra∣titude remembered, that in a sick chamber, the pleasing vivacity, and, let me add, the true philosophy, of a kind female friend, prove es∣sentially necessary. A good nurse will, in a great measure, alleviate our bodily infirmi∣ties, by supporting our spirits in time of sick∣ness.</P>
<P>A man, by striking and superior abilities, industry, and good fortune, is sometimes luc∣ky enough to raise himself, aggrandise his fa∣mily, and bring to his wife conveniencies far beyond her expectations. But what are all these things, compared to the comfort, and tender support, which she in return can largely be∣stow upon him; at a time too when the in∣firmities of nature will not suffer such an ex∣alted favourite of fortune to relish any one enjoyment of life? Ask this very darling, when he is stretched on the bed of sickness, and rendered helpless by disease;—let us fan∣cy him too almost expiring under excruciating agonies—and now put the question to him, Which is more eligible, fortune or health? He will assuredly answer, that one moment's ease is more desirable than all the splendid ad∣vantages he may have obtained.</P>
<P>In like manner, the truly affectionate and sympathising concern, the delicate deport∣ment,
<PB N="156" REF="024796_0147_0FC88EA51FF47350"/>and careful attendance of a good wife, in these scenes of painful sufferance, more than over-balance every thing that is in the power of the most successful husband to be∣stow upon her; and it is a truth which truly generous minds will ever gratefully acknow∣ledge.</P>
<P>A man under these circumstances, with some regard to his accustomed manner of liv∣ing, and the particular disease, is to be consi∣dered as a child; and consequently ought to be submitted to female management. Your care, therefore, will of course direct you to seek the assistance of able and experienced physicians. May their skill conquer the dis∣ease, while you generously support his strength and spirits; and thereby greatly contribute to restore again the invalid to a healthy and vi∣gorous constitution!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.
Old age—by virtue rendered truly honourable. The steps by which we mounted into life, shown to be the easiest and best paths to descend into the grave.</HEAD>
<P>SPRING, summer, and autumn, have their various engaging charms; and there is something peculiarly pleasing in each transi∣tion; but stern winter can boast of nothing besides the fruits of the preceding seasons.</P>
<P>The life of man is often, with propriety, compared to the progressive year; and the only happiness that can be expected in old age, must arise from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a well-spent life; at which time, being likewise the winter of our days, every person may gen∣erally reap the fruits of a past virtuous con∣duct:—for although the benumbed limbs de∣ny the body their usual support, and the hoary head trembles on its withered shoulders, there are valuable comforts yet in store for those, who, like the industrious ant, have been wise enough to treasure them at the proper season.</P>
<P>Such a good man or woman, one would hope, has wherewithal to procure the in∣dulgencies
<PB N="158" REF="024796_0149_0FC88EAE408243A8"/>their years require, and a sufficien∣cy to requite the attendance of a faithful ser∣vant. Join to these a further blessing, that, perchance, kind Heaven has bestowed, a dutiful and good daughter to support their infirmities, and, by her affectionate tender∣ness fully to repay them for the pains of her education, and that parental anxiety, which must necessarily have been sustained during her youth. Here, I say, the wisdom and ten∣der indulgence of a kind parent is amply re∣warded, by the fostering care of a truly vir∣tuous and affectionate child. These are ines∣timable comforts; and such is the easy de∣cline that Providence intended to old age— thus to close life with a not unhappy pe∣riod.</P>
<P>Let us, my amiable friends, picture a worthy and aged man in his second infant state. Let us with composure attend him to the gates of death, there to deliver him up into the bosom of his Creator! Let us in∣dulge a rational sorrow, but at the same time support that calmness and serenity which denote a religiously-informed mind. Let us consider this as a debt we must assuredly pay, and that it puts an everlasting period to the calamities of this life! Whence may be drawn this comfortable conclusion; that, if to the uttermost of our power we have contributed to the great end for which we were created, our future state of existence must be happier than the present.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="024796_0150_0FC88EB2943EA9B8"/>Come then, ye tender and sympathising fair, let us approach the chamber of death! Let us advance to the bed of this good pa∣rent, and behold his calm and resigned coun∣tenance! Although we shall find it a solemn scene, yet there is nothing so terrible in this sight as the world generally imagine. But draw the contrary character, that of a wicked man in his last moments; and it must be shocking indeed.</P>
<P>As ripened and mellow fruit drops, un∣touched, from the tree to its mother earth; so the good old man falls peaceably into the grave, and mingles again with the common dust from which he originally sprang.</P>
<P>It is the vicious alone that have reason to be terrified at the thoughts of death; but we are describing the upright man, not un∣likely taking a last and affectionate farewell of his lovely and dutiful daughters; ex∣horting them to the practice of virtue, and recounting the rewards attendant upon it. The eldest, perhaps, in her willing arms supports the expiring fire, while the youngest administers some refreshing cordial to de∣tain, for a moment, the fleeting spirit. Mean while the tranquil parent, peradventure, gently rebukes the falling tear, prophetically foretelling that their last moments shall be peaceable like his—and blesses them with his dying lips.</P>
<P>For such characters, delineated more at large, and which are worthy of our admi∣ration
<PB N="160" REF="024796_0151_0FC88EB35FCA1790"/>and reverence, I must refer my gentle readers, for the female one, to that great master of human feelings, mr. Richardson, in his history of sir Charles Grandison. How beautifully is honourable age exemplified in the character of mrs. Shirley! The account there given of the latter part of her life will assuredly delight and instruct every one. The death of lady Grandison, how inexpressibly interesting! Although her temples were co∣vered with untimely snow, yet, in the char∣acter of wife, parent, and christian, her ex∣alted virtue had shone unrivalled; and when the awful period approached, behold her de∣parture, like the setting sun,—leaving hus∣band, children, and a world of friends, to mourn the eternal absence of her cheering rays!</P>
<P>The whole work contains a noble system of morality, and is highly to be recommend∣ed to all young persons. These useful lessons will be still more instructive, when read in the company of those who are capable of making proper remarks. This being premis∣ed, virtuous emulation will ever be most excited in young minds from characters which appear real, because example always proves stronger than precept. Thus enter∣tainment and improvement will go hand in hand.</P>
<P>For the other character, I mean that of the good old man, no one has excelled the ingenious and learned dr. Armstrong, in his
<PB N="161" REF="024796_0152_0FC88EB51DE6D0D0"/>Essay upon health. The whole poem, indeed, is written in a masterly style, and conveys many useful instructions, truly worthy of pe∣rusal; but his description of honourable age is inimitable; and although very concise, ne∣vertheless it contains a volume of panegyric. I shall beg that gentleman's leave to transcribe it.—</P>
<LG>
<L>How to live happiest; how avoid the pains,</L>
<L>The disappointments, and disgusts of those</L>
<L>Who would in pleasure all their hours employ,</L>
<L>The precepts here of a divine old man</L>
<L>I could recite. Though old, he still retain'd</L>
<L>His manly sense, and energy of mind.</L>
<L>Virtuous and wise he was, but not severe;</L>
<L>He still remember'd that he once was young;</L>
<L>His easy presence check'd no decent joy.</L>
<L>Him ev'n the dissolute admir'd; for he</L>
<L>A graceful looseness when he pleas'd put on,</L>
<L>And laughing could instruct. Much had he read,</L>
<L>Much more had seen; he studied from the life,</L>
<L>And in th' original perus'd mankind.</L>
</LG>
<P>Such characters render old age desirable, lovely, and truly honourable. The odium of peevish and morose vanishes, while our reve∣rence and admiration stand alone engaged. Who would not wish to be that old man, whose calm tranquillity far surpasses the tran∣sient and passionate enjoyments of youth? Happy children blest with such happy parents!</P>
<P>From this description I hope to interest the tender passions of my fair readers, so as to make them cheerfully contribute to the com∣forts of their aged parents, while they yet live. A dutiful daughter must ever make a
<PB N="162" REF="024796_0153_0FC88EB8E287A920"/>good wife and tender mother; and to a pru∣dent discerning man, it is certainly one of the greatest recommendations in the choice of a companion for life.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a cruel and undutiful child is the most odious and unnatural mon∣ster upon earth; insomuch that the Chinese are said to punish such crimes with the great∣est severity. It is recorded in their history, that if a son should be known to kill, or so much as to strike his father, not only the cri∣minal, but his whole family, would be rooted out, their dwelling razed to the ground, and its foundation sown with salt; nay, Le Compte adds, that the inhabitants of the place where he lived would be put to the sword; as they conclude there must have been a total depra∣vation of manners in that clan, or society of people, who could have bred up among them so horrid an offender.</P>
<P>How beautifully has our inimitable Shake∣speare drawn the two contrasted characters, in his description of Lear and his three daugh∣ters; where the two elder appear like Satan's evil angels, while Cordelia, the poor Corde∣lia, is an exalted example of filial tenderness and affection!</P>
<P>To your peculiar province, ye amiable fair, is this last great duty consigned: to instruct you, therefore, in the proper execution of it, a few useful observations may not be unsea∣sonably introduced.</P>
<P>In a former letter we likened infancy to a lender plant; where we taught the best me∣thod
<PB N="163" REF="024796_0154_0FC88EBECDB892C0"/>of rearing it, so as to make it flourish in the garden of the world. The summer having produced you, the fair fruit of this goodly tree; and the autumn of your parent-stock having ripened your understanding; it is but meet that such knowledge should direct you, at this frozen season, to cherish the decaying root from whence you sprang.</P>
<P>We have taken notice of the helpless state of childhood, before the body has acquired strength sufficient to prepare its own nourish∣ment: we have shown the time when instinct and reason direct us to provide for ourselves; and particularly observed, that animal food was never designed for our use until we had teeth given us to eat it.</P>
<P>Let us continue these speculations, and re∣gard the natural growth of our bodies, toge∣ther with the increasing strength of our con∣stitutions. Behold the child, whom you late∣ly fondled in your arms, now contending with his play-fellows in boyish sports: again, ob∣serve him who lately returned from school with his satchel in his hand, now panting fore∣most in the chace: and now see manhood stamped upon the downy cheek. Let us like∣wise remember the equally gradual declension. At length the sturdy son supports his feeble sire; for he who, in his youth, was swiftest in the race, is now scarcely able to uphold his tottering limbs. The man of war, whose stur∣dy arm wielded the blood-thirsting sword of battle, is now bending under the weight of
<PB N="164" REF="024796_0155_0FC88EC01F9F3ED0"/>his own body. Behold, his sinews are dried up, and the purple current that bounded in his veins, now heavily and scarcely creeps along. In every part alike the powers of this wonderful machine decay. The teeth, de∣signed both for use and ornament, robbed of their beautiful enamel, become unsightly, and drop out of their sockets: the penetrating eye, that searched into the very abyss of thought, is altogether useless, or but dimly discerns the rays of light. Manly fortitude is now no mere; and wisdom itself retires from the decayed mansion. Such is the almost uni∣versal condition of old age, properly called our second childhood; and plain are the in∣ferences to be drawn from hence.</P>
<P>If a light and easily digested nourishment was necessary before our bodies had obtained their proper strength, surely a similar method of living is the most proper when they have lost it; and therefore—the steps by which we mounted into life, are the easiest and best paths to descend into the grave.</P>
<P>The digestive powers of age are equally en∣feebled with the members of the body; and, undoubtedly, the same reason that forbad the use of flesh, before we had teeth, points out the necessity of gradually declining it as they decay. There are, indeed, some few persons toothless who are not far advanced in life; but such constitutions are generally feeble, and therefore the precautions are not unap∣plicable to them,</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="024796_0156_0FC88EC1D1976EE8"/>These arguments being rightly understood, there will be little occasion to enlarge upon this subject; as the directions for the ma∣nagement of children, from the time of wean∣ing them, until they may be entrusted to the care of themselves, comprehend every neces∣sary instruction for the regimen of old age; and those persons act wisely who consider it as a second childhood.</P>
<P>I need not be more particular on this head, as few, I am persuaded, will suppose this pe∣riod to commence with themselves, before it is necessary for them to conform to these rules.</P>
<P>Age, undoubtedly, requires indulgence; but at the same time indolence creeps on it imperceptibly. Those persons suffer least from pain, who rouse themselves to a state of acti∣vity; and there are exercises well adapted even to advanced life: an additional warmth of covering is at this time necessary; yet those act most prudently who do not accustom themselves to very warm clothes, and very warm rooms, while they are capable of endu∣ring the variations of their natural climate.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, one remark must not es∣cape our observation; I mean, the happy ef∣fect of temperance through life: it not only prevents disease as we are upon our journey, but enables us to receive the intended be∣nefit, and cordial support, of wine, and other comfortable sippings, in this time of need. Nature, in a temperate person, obtains fresh
<PB N="166" REF="024796_0157_0FC88EC5C5560B08"/>vigour and spirits from such exhilarating jui∣ces; but where the constitution has been ac∣customed to excess, no advantage, in the de∣cline of life, can be derived from their use.</P>
<P>I have now fulfilled my present design; and through every letter have aimed at convey∣ing my observations in a rational and amu∣sing manner; calculated, I hope, to please, at the same time that I wish to instruct. It is a topic, which, in different parts of it, has been handled by very able men; and yet has generally, I believe, been esteemed a dry subject, particularly by the ladies, to whom it essentially belongs. This dislike seems, probably, to have arisen from the style not seeing sufficiently void of terms of art; for the taste, as well as the judgment, must be pleased, when we mean to encounter preju∣dices, and to correct long established er∣rors.</P>
<P>It will give me a particular satisfaction, if I have so far succeeded in my undertaking, as that the present collection of letters may deserve a place in the ladies library; and per∣haps this little volume may sometimes prove the companion of the nursery and sick cham∣ber, or even afford an hour's amusement in a carriage.</P>
<P>It is intended, my fair, to render your characters truly amiable; and I trust will be received as a present from a sincere friend to the sex. Where tenderness, good-nature, sense, and virtue, are beautifully blended in
<PB N="167" REF="024796_0158_0FC88ECBAAAB8DB0"/>a female form, our admiration and love are equally engaged; and where this proves to be the case, every man is, surely, desi∣rous of contributing to the service of per∣fections so irresistibly engaging—such, at least, is the resolution of,</P>
