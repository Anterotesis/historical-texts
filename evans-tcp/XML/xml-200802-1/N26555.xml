<HEAD>Caution.—Impostors. VERITAS VINCIT OMNES.</HEAD>
<P>IN the present age when imposture stalks so openly and shame∣fully abroad, no man, who has labored for the service of the com∣munity and who has had the satisfaction of seeing his labors crowned with some degree of success, is free from the direct or indirect attacks of persons whose business it is to deceive. And medicine particularly affords a very extensive, though a very dangerous, field for imposition, which is generally practised in proportion to the celebrity the medicine has acquired.</P>
<P>It cannot fail to attract the notice of the public, that CHURCH's COUGH DROPS, unparalleled for their efficacy in the cure of <HI>COUGHS, ASTHMAS</HI> and <HI>CONSUMPTIONS,</HI> and established solely by their merits, has opened a door for imposition. A base and notorious imitation of the genuine medicine, has been vended in almost every city of the United States, as of Dr. Church's pre∣paring, <HI>with his forged Signature,</HI> but which, from their ineffi∣cacy, have been detected. They would be too contemptible to be noticed, were it not by way of caution, as it is too probable dan∣ger of the most serious nature may arise from the application of such gross and scandalous deceptions.</P>
<P>Dr. Church therefore thinks it his indispensable duty to lay be∣fore the public the above facts, requesting them, as they value their money, their health or their lives, to be particularly cau∣tious how they purchase or take any of those despicable and dangerous impositions which are absolutely intruded upon them under the unwarrantable name of Church's Cough Drops, such compositions bearing no analogy to his. As a certain mark of authenticity, each bottle has a blue certificate, signed <HI>James Church,</HI> pasted on the outside wrapper, without which blue label, it cannot be genuine or of Dr. Church's preparing.</P>

<HEAD>APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>FOR many years past, I have applied myself particularly to the study of the cure of Diseases of the Lungs, and the asto∣nishing success I have had since my commencement into prac∣tice, is such as I flatter myself, few in the medical line can boast. In the years 1792 and 1793, by means of public advertisements, I made known a cure for COUGHS, ASTHMAS and CONSUMP∣TIONS, through the efficacy of a Medicine of my own invention: this drew a very considerable number of patients to me, many of whom I had the happiness to cure of the most afflicting maladies incident to human nature, (as will appear by the pamphlets pub∣lished by me) wherein is exhibited such astonishing proofs of its incomparable virtues, as are totally unexampled, and occasion∣ing a demand of the Medicines hitherto uparalleled.</P>
<P>The propagation of these important truths, led me into a vast field for practice, particularly during the uncommonly severe winter of 1794—it was no unusual thing for me to see from 70 to 80 patients a day, nor were my labors crowned with a small degree of success; those who have been my patients and have been restored to health from lingering diseases, need not be in∣formed this; but for the information and satisfaction of those who have not had the opportunity of witnessing the success I have had, I refer to the pamphlet above alluded to. It has been said, if I REALLY had the public good at heart, as I have profess∣ed to have, I should make known the secret by publishing it for the general good; but here I will give some of my objections: was I to do that, they would be prepared by every apothecary and chemist, their virtues would gradually degenerate, and con∣sequently many would be deprived of their efficacy; which as long as they are kept a secret they may expect—experience dai∣ly convinces us that mankind in general despise those things which are commonly known, and two easily obtained.</P>
<P>Many of the most excellent medicines that have been disco∣vered by men eminent in the practice of physic, have performed very astonishing cures during the lives of the inventors, yet af∣ter their decease, when they have no longer remained secrets, but have been published (from motives of philanthropy) for the be∣nefit of mankind in general, have gradually sunk into disrepute and ultimately into oblivion, and for no other reason, but because their preparation was generally known—of these truths I could produce a number of instances.</P>
<P>A professed Medical author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T. Champney.</NOTE> who has vainly attempted to ef∣fect what he calls a "reform in the healing art," in a late publica∣tion says, "if a man should make any discovery in medicine,
<PB N="4" REF="035305_0004_10021AE89FE29900"/>
likely to be useful to his country, let him make it known to the College of Physicians, or Corporation of Surgeons, and on their deliberate trial and report in its favor, let him be rewarded by the Legislature." It is very probable they would make a <HI>"deliberate trial"</HI> of its efficacy to their own profit and emolument; but he must not expect a <HI>"report in its favor,"</HI> although adopted into general use by many of those gentlemen who constitute the <HI>"Col∣lege of Physicians"</HI> and <HI>"Corporation of Surgeons."</HI> Who then is to indemnify me for having given away, what would at least have procured me a comfortable competency? I doubt if this gentleman, or any other person, can produce a single instance, where any professional man was ever rewarded by the Legislature, for any discovery made in medicines however important.</P>
<P>For while every other science is rising hastily towards the sum∣mit of perfection, while monarchs deign to patronize its improv∣ers, and the whole nation derives fresh dignity and importance from the discoveries of individuals, the science of physic <HI>alone</HI> is neglected. Is the cultivation of our lands, the extent of our na∣vigation, or the momentary entertainment of our eye or ear, of more consequence than the enjoyment of our health, or the pre∣servation of our constitutions from sickness or disease? in vain do we attempt to render the earth more fertile, in vain do we la∣bor to extend our commerce, the charms of poetry are wholly useless, and even music's self has little power to please, even with all these blessings, we still are languishing upon a bed of sickness; even all that gold can put us in possession of, would be tasteless and insipid, had we not health to enjoy what we pos∣sess. Yet we cannot in all of our searches, find a single patron for the encouragement of this sublime study.</P>
<P>Our seminaries of learning, appropriate honorable rewards for literary exhibitions; societies instituted for the promotion of the useful arts, have rewarded men for producing a quantity of grass or vegetables: but to whom shall <HI>he</HI> apply, who has found out a dangerous and torturing disease; there is no society to reward <HI>him,</HI> or recompence <HI>him</HI> for his labors; no man of eminence to grant <HI>him</HI> his protection; but on the contrary he is <HI>opposed</HI> by the whole fraternity of physicians and surgeons; and every avenue to fame and honor, through <HI>their</HI> means, is effectually stopped up.</P>
<P>In the present case there are few exceptions, some few medi∣cal gentlemen have been candid enough to make a <HI>deliberate tri∣al</HI> of my medicines, and have made a <HI>report in its favor,</HI> as may be seen by their public testimonies in this pamphlet. I am there∣fore under the necessity, whether pleasant to me or not, of adopt∣ing this as the only method to propagate, and render universally known, the result of long and indefatigable study and practice.</P>
<P>Surely then as the Proprietor, I may without ostentation, con∣gratulate myself and the public, on account of it, and rejoice with the numerous families and individuals, who have thereby been made happy in the unexpected, and frequently unhoped for recovery of themselves, their relatives and friends.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035305_0005_10021AEA347FFCB8"/>The reader must not expect (from what I have said) that the Medicine will work miracles, or that they are infallible, for to assert either, would be a gross violation of truth, as no such Medicines ever were discovered.</P>
<P>My fervent desire is, that all who labour under the several Disorders herein mentioned, may be led to adopt the method laid down in the several directions, and experience the good effects of the Medicine, in a speedy return of health.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ON THE EFFICACY</HI> OF Church's Cough Drops, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS no remedy in the whole history of medicine ever ac∣quired greater celebrity than <HI>CHURCH'S COUGH DROPS,</HI> which is proved to be a perfect cure for <HI>COUGHS, COLDS, ASTH∣MAS, CONSUMPTIONS</HI> and the <HI>HOOPING COUGH</HI>; and no wonder, since upwards of three hundred thousand persons have al∣ready experienced its happy and salutary effects, many of whom have been impelled by motives of gratitude, and for a laudable regard for their fellow men suffering under the similar complaints, to publish their respective cases to the world; therein exhibiting such astonish∣ing proofs of its incomparable virtues, as are totally unexampled, and occasioning a demand for the medicine hitherto unparalleled.</P>
<P>Very many of the patients who have been restored to health by these drops had been reduced by long standing and increasing Con∣sumptive and Asthmatic complaints to the brink of the grave, after having used every remedy recommended as specific for those com∣plaints, and receiving every advice and assistance from the Faculty they could obtain.</P>
<P>The principal qualities of this medicine are an <HI>Expectorant,</HI> a <HI>de∣mulient,</HI> an <HI>Antispasmodic,</HI> a <HI>Corroborant,</HI> an <HI>Anodyne</HI> and a <HI>Tonic</HI>: also an enlivener of the spirits, and a restorer of the appetite, by a removal of the affection which suspends it. It gives almost imme∣diate liberty of respiration in the highest paroxism of the asthma, without a danger of subjecting the patient to take cold; it directly eases the lacerating soreness of the breast occasioned by coughing: in obstructions of the glands, and in removing that acrimony of the fluids, (particularly in that species of cold termed a <HI>Catarrh</HI>) which corrodes the lungs, and if not timely prevented, is productive of the most fatal consequences.</P>
<P>Even in the most desperate cases, which experience has proved a cure to be impracticable, and where the whole internal system has been actually decayed, these drops surprisingly comfort and relieve the patient, not only by giving ease to the cough and breath, but by
<PB N="6" REF="035305_0006_10021AEC16B5DBA8"/>
promoting sleep, stimulating the appetite, enlivening the spirits and consequently prolonging life, of which all men are so naturally desirous.</P>
<P>COMMON COLDS, which are generally occasioned by an obstructed perspiration, will be found to yield to its benign influence in a few hours. In common Coughs, which are in general the effect of COLD, it gives immediate relief, removing those troublesome irritations, or, as they are called, ticklings in the throat, so tormenting in this com∣plaint, and which acts as a constant stimulus to coughing; it quiets those convulsive excitements, and causing the afflicted to breathe and speak freely; it procures rest and sleep in an eminent degree, and strengthens the constitution, which enables it to repel an enemy, whose attacks are frequently followed by the most fatal consequences.</P>
<P>Persons afflicted with PULMONARY COMPLAINTS, or disorders of the BREAST and LUNGS, (even in the most advanced state, and the most advanced period of life) will find instant relief.</P>
<P>In ASTHMATIC or CONSUMPTIVE Affections (recent or chronic) HOARSENESS, CATARRHS, WHEEZINGS and SHORTNESS OF BREATH, it will give immediate ease.</P>
<P>It is also admirable in SORENESS of the BREAST and STOMACH, giving present ease in these cases.</P>
<P>In the HOOPING COUGH it remains without a rival; a few instances only are selected from a numerous list to prove its efficacy.</P>
<P>It has been the instrument in the hands of Providence, of curing many thousands of poor afflicted objects, both Asthmatic and Con∣sumptive, not excluding some of thirty years standing, (see the case of Mr. Williams) and in most of the confirmed cases, where a cure could possibly be effected by medicines, it has wonderfully alleviat∣ed the complaints, so as to enable the patient to attend to business, and to render their lives in a great degree comfortable to themselves.</P>
<P>It operates by gentle expectoration, and may be given to women with child, and to infants with the greatest safety.</P>

<P>In the year 1795, I had the misfortune to break a blood vessel, which was suc∣ceeded by a severe complaint on my lungs, cough, shortness of breath, and spitting up of matter and blood, with every other disagreeable symptom of a disorder of the lungs; indeed so afflicting was this disorder, that I could not rest at night, nor could walk 200 yards in the day, without stopping to cough and rest myself a number of times. This disorder continued to increase upon me, till I was much wasted in body, and exceedingly weak. Seeing your advertisement in the public papers, early in the last summer, I commenced taking your justly celebrated cough drops, which I persevered in the use of for some time; I have now the happiness of informing you, my lungs are perfectly sound; I have no shortness of breath, or spitting of matter or blood; my cough is a little troublesome in the morning, but no other time.</P>

In the year 1779, I caught a severe cold, which settled upon my lungs—this brought on a violent cough, pain and tightness across my breasts and shortness of breath: I used to expec∣torate a frothy, though latterly a quantity of glutinous matter, which owing to the violence of the cough, used sometimes to be mixed with blood. I have had the advice of some of the first Physicians in England, whose prescriptions afforded me little more than temporaay relief. In consequence of hearing that Col. GLOVER, of Portland-place, had been astonishingly relieved by taking your Cough Drops, was induced (having before an aversion to advertised remedies) to give your medi∣cine a fair trial, and am happy to make known to the world, that I am restored to perfect health by taking it, after having suffered a martyrdom for upwards of 16 years.</P>

I had been afflicted with a most dreadful Asthma, for about twenty three years.

Providentially hearing of your Cough Drops, I took them; and through taking them alone, I am now, bles∣sed be God! restored to perfect health.

<P>I have been afflicted for upwards of nineteen years with a most violent cough and shortness of breath, and constantly expectorated a quantity of glutinous matter, which sometimes used to be streaked with blood. I tried every remedy recom∣mended as specifics for those complaints, but found no relief whatever. Among many others I took three pints of the famous Vegetable Balsam, which did me no good. A friend of mine came to visit me here, where I am for the benefit of the air, and brought me a bottle of your Cough Drops, which he purchased at Tutt's, at the Royal-Exchange. The first dose gave me present relief; and by taking the whole bottle, I was so much better as to be able to walk to my house in town. When it was all gone I sent to your house for a double bottle, and it agreed with me so well, that I sent for a bottle containing six, which has perfectly cured me, thanks be to God for it!

<P>My case which is nearly as follows, I give you full liberty to pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish for the be∣nefit of others, as you think proper. About eight years ago I caught a most violent void, which brought with it a dreadful cough and shortness of breath, and which has encreased upon me ever since: at first it was only troublesome to me in cold thick foggy weather, but within th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e last few years it was a trouble to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both

summer and winter, day and night, insomuch that I was scarce able to do any thing, or even to walk about. I applied to many eminent in the practice of physic, whose prescriptions I took with patience, but nothing that I ever took relieved my breath: I despaired of ever being in any degree relieved. My cough in spite of all the medicines and other things that I took, still continued to torment me exceedingly, till by chance happening to hear of your celebrated Cough Drops, I took a dose of it and found instantaneous relief, and by continuing it for about ten days, I was happily rid both of cough and shortness of breath, and am as well as ever I was in my life.</P>

<P>I Have been afflicted with a severe asthma for upwards of twenty years, but this winter, owing to the intenseness of the weather, I suffered more than any preceding winter; my cough was violent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed, and with the greatest difficulty imaginable I drew my breath. I constantly expectorated a quantity of glutinous matter, of a most disagreeable saltish taste and foetid smell. I was always attended by some gentleman of the faculty or another, having tried many; which, beside doing me no good at all, cost me an immense sum of money.—I was at last reduced so low, as not to be able to be lifted out of my bed, nor was I expected to live a day. A friend got me a bottle of your Drops, hearing an extraordinary account of them: the first dose I took did me more good than all the medicines I had taken for twen∣ty years together—it eased my breath almost instantaneously, and quieted my cough; after which I had a good night's rest, a blessing I had not enjoyed for years, and by repeating them I am now, through divide providence, perfectly free from complaint, and will gladly testify the truth of the same to any enquirer.</P>

<P>For public good I desire you will publish the following cure, recently effected on myself by your invaluable medicine. I had been afflicted for a long time with a dreadful cough, shortness of breath, soreness and tightness at my stomach, and my body was so swelled and puffed up with wind, and at the same time my stomach was so clogged with phlegm, that it was with difficulty I could draw my breath, and was often threatened with suffocation. In this dreadful situation I was providentially visited by the Collector of the Excise at Southampton, who re∣commended me to the immediate use of your Cough Drops, which I sent for to your dispensary, and through the instrumentality of one large bottle, I am perfectly cured of all my disorders. It immediately relieved the cough and shortness of breath, and operated by gentle expectoration, discharging the viscid phlegm from my stomach, healed the soreness, and expelled the wind in a wonderful manner; and indeed, I believe it has not its parallel in the world.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE EFFICACY OF DR. CHURCH's Cordial Restorative Balsam.</HEAD>
<P>BALSAMS, it is universally admitted, are more friendly to the constitution than any other class of the <HI>Materia Medica.</HI></P>
<P>Many of the most enlightened physicians assert, that <Q><HI>Bal∣samic Medicines</HI> are of extensive use in physic, and their vir∣tues
<PB N="12" REF="035305_0012_10021AF9DB767CB0"/>
superior to those of any other class, being suited to all constitutions and calculated to remove many diseases.</Q></P>
<P>This excellent <HI>Restorative</HI> is prepared at a considerable ex∣pence, from the choicest, richest, and most valuable Balsams in the worid, joined with a collection of the most useful corrobo∣rants, all happily suited for restoring the most emaciated and de∣bilitated constitutions; its incomparable virtues have been ex∣perienced by thousands in Europe, the West Indies and America, in the Cure of NERVOUS DISORDERS, LOSS OF APPETITE, FEMALE COMPLAINTS, INWARD WEAKNESSES, LOWNESS OF SPIRITS, SEMINAL WEAKNESSES, INDIGESTION, DE∣CAYED, WEAK, RELAXED or DEBILITATED CONSTITU∣TIONS, PAINS IN THE LIMBS, POVERTY OF BLOOD, SINKINGS, ANXIETIES and TREMORS, which so dreadfully affect the weak, the sedentary, and the delicate, BILIOUS DIS∣ORDERS, every symptom of extreme debility, attendant on the indiscretions of youth, the consequences of a dissipated life, ex∣cess of pleasure or grief, change of climate, the immoderate use of tea, hard drinking, or any intemperance; diseases incident to young women, <HI>i.</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Irregularities, the <HI>Flor Albus</HI> or <HI>Whites,</HI> Pains in the Head with a sense of weight across the eyes, Giddi∣ness, Pains in the Stomach, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is particularly adapted to women in a weak state, either in consequence of an immoderate flux of the customary evacuations, bad lyings-in, or any other cause; it is of infinite service to wo∣men at a certain period of life.</P>
<P>THE CORDIAL RESTORATIVE BALSAM
Is recommended as a Medicine of specific and unparalleled virtues for the immediate relief and speedy and permanent cure of the above disorders, having stood a trial of many successful years, during which period many thousands of both sexes have been restored from the brink of the grave.</P>
<P>This Balsam is particularly adapted to weak Female Constitu∣tions, as well as to the phlegmatic habits in general; it acts pow∣erfully as a nervine, not only to the weak stomach, but to the whole nervous system; corrects a vitiated appetite and digestion in the first passages, and assists wonderfully in recovering the tone of the urinary and genital organs.—Hence its efficacy in the obstinate seminal gleets in men, and corresponding weaknesses in women; and hence it will contribute more safely, surely and honorably towards conjugal happiness, than any of those irritat∣ing, diabolical compositions, which are so shamefully admini∣stered to the unwary.</P>
<P>It is earnestly recommended to those ladies, who from repeated and difficult labours, are afflicted with weaknesses and infirmi∣ties; in which cases it is highly useful, strengthening at the same time the stomach, the back, the weakened organs, and the <HI>whole constitution.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="035305_0013_10021AFCCF5D7CA8"/>Those, who in advanced life, feel the consequences of <HI>youthful excess,</HI> or unfortunate youth, who have brought on themselves a numerous train of evils, will by the use of this, <HI>find themselves restored to health and strength,</HI> and all the <HI>melancholy symptoms removed,</HI> which are the general effects of such causes.</P>
<P>For whether the system has received a shock, and is <HI>debilitated</HI> from <HI>imprudencies</HI> or <HI>inattention in the earliest part of life,</HI> or is <HI>sinking under the advance of youth,</HI> a few doses of this <HI>Medicine</HI> will afford immediate assurance of <HI>returning health and strength,</HI> by giving tone to the muscular system, and organs or digestion, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enovating the <HI>whole constitution.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>young</HI> it will afford lasting <HI>health, strength and spirits,</HI> in place of lassitude and debility: and to the <HI>aged and infirm,</HI> it will assuredly furnish <HI>great relief and comfort,</HI> by gently and safely <HI>invigorating the system:</HI> it will not give immortality; but if it be in the power of Medicine to gild the autumn of declining years, and calmly and serenely protract the close of life beyond its narrow span, <HI>this Restorative is capable of effecting that grand desideratum.</HI></P>
<P>Constitutions relaxed, weak or decayed, <HI>in men or women,</HI> are under the immediate influence of this <HI>Restorative.</HI></P>
<P>Old <HI>coughs,</HI> soon relieved, and speedily cured. <HI>Poverty of blood and emaciated limbs,</HI> will ere long meet the happiest change; the chill watery fluid become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch and balsamic, and the limbs be covered with flesh, firm and healthful.</P>
<P>It will no doubt be acceptable to the reader, to see accounts of some of the <HI>remarkable cases and cures</HI> which have been per∣formed by this <HI>truly invaluable medicine,</HI> in the disorders for which it was invented; he has therefore selected a few of such cases as have come within his own immediate knowledge, which are published and may be had (gratis) at any of the places where the Medicine is sold.</P>

<P><PB N="19" REF="035305_0019_10021B08C786BA30"/>THERE is perhaps no malady to which the human frame is subject, that has had more applications of various kinds administered as remedies▪ than the Rheuma∣tism, nor is there scarce a disorder that has resisted with like force the attempts made to remove it. The virtues of the Essence and Extract of Mustard, will be found to equal if not excell those of any other medicine whatever, in the cure of the above complaints. The following is quoted from the London Pharmacopiae, and is the opinion of the College of Physicians concerning this valuable drug.</P>
<P>"MUSTARD, by its acrimony and pungency, stimulates the solids, and attenu∣ates viscid juices, and hence is deservedly recommended for exciting appetite, pro∣moing digestion, encreasing the fluid secretions, also in paralytic and rheumatic af∣ffections."</P>
<P>These Medicines contain all the virtues that can possibly be derived from that excellent and powerful vegetable. The Essence is prepared in a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and is singularly efficacious as an external application; common Rheumatisms, Sprains, Chilblains, Stiff Necks, swelled Joints, Bruises, frozen Feet, local Pains in any part of the body or extremities, swelled Faces, chopped Hands, &amp;c. will be found to yield to its benign influence in a few hours. The Extract is prepared in the form of Pills, and (being an internal remedy) is an amazing additional improvesness, taken in the severest cases of Rheumatic Gout, Chronic Rheumatism, Palsy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ed Pains, Lumbago, Numbness, Gouts, &amp;c. when the Essence is externally appl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. It promotes gentle perspiration, and operates ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y mildly by urine. They also amend a weak digestion, and strengthen the stomach.</P>
<P>☞ Observe. This Chemical Essence and Extract of Mustard, bears no analo∣gy whatever to any other Medicine of a similar title; nor can it possibly be genuine without this certificate; <HI>"I hereby certify, that this bottle" (or box) "of Essence" (or Extract) "of Mustard, is genuine, and prepared by me, James Church, Inventor and sole Proprietor.</HI></P>

<P>I have been much afflicted with the RHEUMATISM ever since the fall of the year 1784, (owing to my imprudently exposing myself to the dews of the evening) to such a violent degree, as (at times) not to be able to raise my hand to my head, or to dress and undress myself, particularly at the change of weather, for which I have used and taken a great deal of medicine to no purpose: till early in July last, having caught a violent cold through over-heating myself I was not able to move in bed. In this situation I lay for two days and two nights, when I was advised by a neighbour to use your CHURCH's ESSENCE OF MUSTARD and PILLS, which after the first application I was able to move without pain, and by using four bottles and three boxes of pills, I was entirely cured, and am now perfectly free from any disorder, and am as well and as hearty as ever I was in my life.

<P>It is near ten years ago since I first found a dimness in my sight, which I suffered for three years, being afraid to use any remedy; but, as it grew worse, I found it indispensably necessary to use some means, thinking▪ if any good could be done, then was the time, as I was very likely to lose the sight of both eyes. I applied to the late Dr. Hunter, who gave me some drops to put into them every night, which put me in the most excruciating pain; and which as my sight grew no better, I was obliged, on account of the violent agony they put me in, to discontinue; since which time I have applied to several eminent men, but never found any relief whatever, till, hearing of your EYE-SALVE, which on account of a great cure re∣cently advertised by you, on a person who I knew very well, I was induced to make trial of it; which I am happy I did, it having, in the course of five weeks, perfectly restored me to my sight, in the forty ninth year of my age.

<P>It is taken for breakfast instead of Foreign Tea: and as our first aliment in the morning is designed to recruit the waste of the body from the night's insensible per∣spiration,
<PB N="23" REF="035305_0023_10021B1228EFB898"/>

This substitute is profes∣sionally approved as a salutary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> diet, or as a morning and afternoon beverage.</P>
<P>THE BOTA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>CAL TEA, is singularly efficacious in all cases of inward weakness, trembling or shaking of the hands, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of appetite, (particularly in the morning) depression of spirits, windy complaints. It speedily relieves the head and stomach in Gouty or Rheumatic cases, and in cases of weak Digestion, but particularly after making too free with the constitution, by an immoderate use of wine, spirituo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s liquors, or any intempe∣rance; it is happily suited to hot climates, and is adopted and approved by some of the first families in the United States and in the West Indies; for its nourishing and invigorating properties, and in billious cases, where the appetite has failed, it is a sovereign remedy.</P>
<P>As proofs of the evil tendency from the Use of Foreign Teas, is subjoined the opinions of some of the first Physicians in Europe.</P>
<P>ON FOREIGN TEA,
<Q>The cause of the Palsy is drinking too much Tea—many imagine Tea has no ill effect on the nerves: this, however, is a mistake—it effects he nerves, which is evident from its causing the hands to shake, preventing sleep, occassioning giddi∣ness, dimness of sight, sickness, &amp;c.</Q>—<HI>Dr. Buchan.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Strong infusions of India Tea, not only unnerves, but destroys the bodily func∣tions.</Q>—<HI>Dr. Hugh Smith.</HI></P>
<P>And another publication, Dr. Hugh Smith says, "Tea is hurtful to both the stomach and nerves, it causes ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nzies, delirium, appoplexies, and other disorders of the brain, which are produced by the nerves being thus disarranged and debili∣tated, the digestive faculty of the stomach is weakened, and the body failing of the recruiting juices, must tend to emaciation, and the whole frame thus rendered one system of distress and infirmity."</P>
<P>The justly celebrated Dr. Tissot says, "This fashionable beverage, India Tea, is extremely pernicious, it destroys the strength of the stomach, the viscera, the blood, the nerves, and eventually the whole body."</P>
<P>Dr. Moliere says, "In billious complaints, Tea is extremely hurtful."</P>
<P>Dr. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hergill, "Tea is very offensive to the lungs, and impedes respiration; it is therefore highly improper for persons who have a difficulty of breathing, or any complaint of the lungs or nerves."</P>
<P>Dr. Saunders says, (see his Med. Mem.) "India Tea renders men impotent and women barren; hence we may account for persons in the higher circles, having few children, and those in general very sickly and unhealthy."</P>
<P>For more accounts of this Tea, see the second edition of this pamphlet.</P>
<P>This Botanical Tea, is calculated to produce the contrary effects, is the result of long and indefatigable study and experience, and by perseveringly adopting its use, will be found to answer every effect herein mentioned.</P>
<P>It is cheaper than India Tea, one packet at 75 cents, will last one person for breakfast nearly one month; cannisters containing eight packets, 5 dollars.</P>
<P>It is prepared only by Dr. Church, and may be had of the venders of his medi∣cines in the United States and the West-Indies.</P>
