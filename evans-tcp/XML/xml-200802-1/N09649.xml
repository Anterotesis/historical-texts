<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>AS it is not doubted the numerous friends of the late Reverend Mr. GEORGE WHITEFIELD will be glad of an opportunity of seeing a ge∣nuine copy of his last Will and Testament; his Exe∣cutors have favoured the Public with a copy of the same, transmitted to them from the Orphan House in Geor∣gia, and which they have proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. And as it was Mr. WHITE∣FIELD's constant declaration he never meant to raise either a Purse or a Party, it is to be remarked, that al∣most the whole money he died possessed of, came to him within two or three Years of his death, in the following manner, viz. Mrs. Thompson, of Tower∣hill, bequeathed him 500l. By the death of his Wife, including a Bond of 300l. he got 700l. Mr. Whit∣more bequeathed him 100l. and Mr. Winder 100l. and it is highly probable, that had he lived to reach Georgia from his late nothern tour, he would have much lessened the above sums, by disposing of them in the same noble and disinterested manner that all the publick or private sums he has been intrusted with have been.</P>

<P>IN the name of the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost, three Persons, but one God; I GEORGE WHITEFIELD, Clerk, at present residing at the Orphan-House Academy, in the Province of Georgia, in North America, being through infinite mercy in more than ordinary bodily health, and a perfectly sound and disposing mind, know∣ing the certainty of death, and yet the uncertainty of the time I shall be called by it to my long wished for home, do make this my last will and testament, in man∣ner and form following, viz. Imprimis, In sure and certain hope of a resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ, I commit my Body to the Dust, to be buried in the most plain and decent manner; and knowing in whom I have believed, and being persuaded that he will keep that which I have committed unto him, in the fullest assurance of faith I commend my soul into the hands of the everloving, altogether lovely, never failing Jesus, on whose compleat and everlasting righte∣ousness I entirely depend, for the justification of my person and acceptance of my poor, worthless, though I trust, sincere performances, at that day when he shall come in the glory of his Father, his own glory, and the glory of his holy Angels, to judge both the quick and dead. In respect to my outward, American con∣cerns, which I have engaged in simply and solely for his great name's sake, I leave that building, commonly cal∣led the Orphan-house, at Bethesda, in the Province of Georgia, together with all the other buildings lately erec∣ted thereon, and likewise all other buildings, lands, ne∣groes, books, furniture, and every other thing whatsoever which I now stand possessed of in the Province of Geor∣gia aforesaid, to that elect Lady, that mother in Israel,

<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mirror of true and undefiled religion, the Right Honorable Selin, Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, de∣siring, that as soon as may be after my decease, the plan of the intended Orphan-house, Bethesda College, may be prosecuted, or, if not practicable, or eligible, to pur∣sue the present plan of the Orphan-house Academy, on its old foundation and usual channel; but if her Lady∣ship should be called to enter into her glorious rest before my decease, I bequeath all the buildings, lands, negroes, and every thing before mentioned which I now stand possessed in the Province of Georgia aforesaid, to my dear first straveller, and faithful, invariable friend, the Honourable James Habersham, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> President of his Majesty's Honorable Council: and should he survive her Ladyship, I earnestly recommend him as the most proper person to succeed her Ladyship, or to act for her during her Ladyship's life time, in the affairs of the Or∣phan-house Academy. With regard to my outward af∣fairs in England; whereas there is a building commonly called the tabernacle, set apart many years ago for di∣vine worship, I give and beneath the said tabernacles, with the adjacent house in which I usually reside, when in London, with the stable and coach-house in the yard adjoining, together with all books, furniture, and every thing else whatsoever, that shall be found in the House and premises aforesaid, and also the building commonly called Tottenham-court Chapple, together with all the other buildings, houses, stable, coach-house, and every thing else whatsoever which I stand possessed of in that part of the town, to my worthy, trusty, tried friends, Daniel West, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in Church-street, Spitalfields, and Mr. Robern Keen, woollen-draper, in the Minories, or the longest survivor of the two. As to the monies, which a kind Providence, especially of late, in a most unexpected way, and unthought of means, hath vouch∣safed to intrust me with; I give and bequeath the sum of one hundred pounds sterling to the Right Honourable Countess Dowager of Huntingdon aforesaid, humbly be∣seeching her Ladyship's acceptance of so small a mite, as
<PB N="vi" REF="012285_0006_0F89E7204A1E39A8"/>
a pepper corn of acknowledgment for the undeserved, unsought for honour her Ladyship conferred upon me, in appointing me, less than the least of all, to be one of her Ladyship's domestic chaplains. Item, I give and be∣queath to my dearly beloved friend the Honourable James Habersham aforesaid, my late wife's gold watch, and ten pounds for mourning; to my dear old friend, Gabriel Harris, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of the city of Gloucester, who recei∣ved and boarded me in his house, when I was helpless and destitute, above thirty five years ago, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds; to my humble faithful servant and friend, Mr. Ambrose Wright, if in my ser¦vice and employ, either in England or America, or elsewhere, at the time of my decease, I give and be∣queath the sum of five hundred pounds; to my brother, Mr. Richard Whitefield, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds; to my brother, Mr. Thomas White¦field, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds, to be given him at the discretion of Mr Robert Keen; to my brother in law Mr. Jame Smith, hosier, in the city of Bristol, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds, and thirty pounds also for family mourning; to my neice Mrs. Francis Hartford, of Bath, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds, and twenty pounds for Family mourning; to Mr. J. Crane, now a faithful steward at the Orphan-house Academy, I give and bequeath the sum of forty pounds; to Mr. Benjamin <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in acknowledge¦ment of his past services at Bethesda, I give and bequeath the sum of ten pounds for mourning; to Peter Edwards, now at the Orphan-House Academy, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds; to Mr. William Trigg, at the same place, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds; both the sums aforesaid to be laid out, or laid up for them, at the discretion of Mr. Ambrose Wright; to Mr. Thomas Adams, of Redborough in Gloucestershire, my first fellow laboorer, and beloved much in the Lord, I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds; to the Re∣verend Mr. Howel Davis, of Pembrokeshire, in South Wales, that good Soldier of Jesus Christ; to Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Joss, Mr. Cornelius Winter, and all my other dearly be¦loved present stated assistant preachers at Tabernacle and

Tottenham-court Chapel, I give and bequeath ten pounds each for mourning; to the three brothers of Mr. Ambrose Wright, and the wife of his brother Mr. Robert Wright, now faithfully and skilfully labouring, and serving at the Orphan-House Academy, I give and bequeath the sum of ten pounds each for mourning; to Mr. Richard Smith, now a diligent attendant on me, I give and be∣queath the sum of fifty pounds and all my wearing ap∣parel which I shall have with me in my journey through America, or on my voyage to England, if it should please an all-wise God to shorten my days in either of these situations. Finally, I give and bequeath the sum of one hundred pounds, to be distributed at the discretion of my executors herein after mentioned, for mourning among my old London servants, the poor widows at Totten∣ham-court Chapel, and the Tabernacle poor, especially my old trusty, disinterested friend and servant, Mrs. Eli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abeth Wood. All the other residue, if there be any re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>due, of monies, goods and chattels, or whatever profits may arise from the sale of my books, or any manuscripts that I may leave behind, I give and bequeath to the Right Honorable the Countess Dowager of Huntingdon, or in case of her Ladyship's being deceased at the time of my departure, to the Honorable James Habersham, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> be∣fore-mentioned, after my funeral expences and just debts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> discharged, towards paying off my arrears that may be due on account of the Orphan-House Academy, or for annual prizes as a reward for the best three orations that shall be made in English on the subjects mentioned in a paper annexed to this my will. And I do hereby apppoint the Honorable James Habersham, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> afore∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to be my executor in respect to my affairs in the province of Georgia, and my trusty tried dearly beloved friends Charles Hardy, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Daniel West, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Mr. Robert Keen, to be executors of this my last will and testament, in respect of my affairs in England, begging each to accept of a mourning ring. To all my other christian benefactors, and more intimate acquaintance, I leave my most hearty thanks and blessing, assuring them that I am more and more convinced of the undoubted reality, and infinite importance of the grand gospel

truths which I have from time to time delivered; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> am so far from repenting my delivering them in an iti∣nerant way, that had I strength equal to my inclination I would preach them from pole to pole, not only be¦cause I have found them to be the power of God to the salvation of my own soul, but because I am as much assured that the Great Head of the Church hath called me by his word, providence, and spirit, to act in this way as that the sun shines at noon day. As for my enemies and misjudging, mistaken friends, I most freely and heartily forgive them, and can only add, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and tremendous day will soon discover what I have been what I am, and what I shall be, when time itself shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no more; and therefore. from my inmost soul, I close all, by crying, Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly, even so Lord Jesus, Amen and Amen.</P>
