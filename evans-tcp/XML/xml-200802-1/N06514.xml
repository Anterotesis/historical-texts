<BIBL>1 PETER 2. 17.</BIBL>
<Q>—Fear GOD: Honour the King.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Principal and most Noble de∣sign of our being made Rational Creatures, is to Capacitate us for Religion; and thereby to Qualify us for Usefulness in the World, and for the Enjoyment of our Maker: An End, truly worthy of it's Author, and our Existence. So that some have tho't, that a Religious Creature, or a Creature capable of Religion; a better Definition of Man, than merely a Rational Creature or a Creature Endowed with Reasonable Understanding: Because what ever Resemblance of Reason may appear in some parts of the Sensitive Creation; yet none of Religion. And by how much the more we exert ourselves in the Practice of Religion and Moral Virtue; By so much the better do we Conform to the Injunction in our Text. <HI>Fear God, Honour</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="008267_0005_102E781971D464B8"/>
<HI>the King.</HI> Loyalty being Dictated as an Essential part of Duty, both by the Light of Nature &amp; Revelation. And nothing is more Evident, than it's being strictly Enjoined in our Christian Profession. I need not go from my Text &amp; Context to Confirm this. The Apostle in the 9th verse of the Context Re∣minds those to whom He wrote, of their pe∣culiar Priviledge &amp; Dignity as Christians and Saints; and the Obligations they were under to Conduct, accordingly: <HI>But ye are a Chosen Generation, a Royal Priesthood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar People; that ye should shew forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness into marvellous light.</HI> In the 11th &amp; 12th verses, He besecheth them to be ex∣treemly careful of their Moral conduct and Conversation: that they give no Occasion to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to reproach them with Licentious∣ness &amp; Disloyalty: <HI>But to Submit to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's sake: whe∣ther it be to the King as Supream; or unto Governors, as unto them that are Sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well. i. e.</HI> To be Sub∣ject to Civil Government, out of Conscience, and Obedience to God, who has Ordained the Civil Magistracy, and Commands Obedience unto it. There are two things implyed in this, (1.) That Disobedience to Civil Autho∣rity proceeds from Mens Lusts, (2) That such
<PB N="7" REF="008267_0006_102E781D9C6B2198"/>
Disobedience, would open the Mouth of Un∣believers against the Gospel: and that a Loyal behaviour will put to Silence the ignorance of Foolish Men; as in verse 15. In the next words the Apostle seems to prevent a secret Objection. Some might Reply, we are free in Christ, and therefore owe no Obedience to any above us. The Apostle grants the An∣ticedent, understanding it of their freedom from the burden &amp; curse of the Law, &amp; the bondage of Sin &amp; Satan; but withal he Ad∣monish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s them not to withdraw their Obedi∣ence to the Magistrate, under this pretence: <HI>As free and Not using your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciousness, but as the Servants of God.</HI> But says He, in the next words, <HI>Honour all Men,</HI> according to their State and Calling: <HI>Love the brotherhood,</HI> as becomes Saints; and to include all in a word, <HI>Fear God▪ Honour the King.</HI> i. e. Let your Religious &amp; Civil de∣portment be such as becomes your Profession as Christians: Examples of Virtue &amp; Piety, and a Bar to every Objection.</P>
<P>I shall improve the words more fully un∣der this DOCTRINAL Observation, viz.</P>
<P><HI>That Religion and Loyalty is the Duty and Glory of a People.</HI></P>
<P>These things are implyed in the words; in as much as the <HI>Fear of God</HI> includes the
<PB N="8" REF="008267_0007_102E7833C098B9A8"/>
whole of Religion, and <HI>Honouring the King</HI> all Loyalty and Subjection that is due to Civil Authority.</P>
<P N="1">1. I say the Fear of God, is often put to Express the sum of our Religion, and the whole of Duty, as in Job 28. 28. <HI>And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is un∣derstanding.</HI> Psal. 111. 10. <HI>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good un∣derstanding have all they that do his command∣ments.</HI> And Eccl. 12. 13. <HI>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter, Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</HI> Now the Reason why this is put for the whole of Religion, seems to be, because Fear is so powerful a Principle, and has so great an influence upon men to make them Religious. For (<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Tillotson.</NOTE> as one observes) it is a Passion that is most deeply rooted in our natures, &amp; flowes immediately from that Principle of self-preservation which God has planted in every Man. Every one desires his own Preservation &amp; Happiness, &amp; therefore hath a natural Dread &amp; Horror of every thing that can destroy his Being, or Endanger his Felicity: and the greatest Danger is from the greatest Power, &amp; that is Omnipotency. So that the Fear of God is an inward acknow∣legement of a holy and just Being, which is
<PB N="9" REF="008267_0008_102E783745F76F70"/>
Armed with an Almighty &amp; Irresistable Power. God having hid in every Man's Conscience, a secret awe and dread of his Infinite Power, and Eternal Justice. Now Fear being so in∣timate to our Natures, it is the strongest Bond of Laws, and the greatest Security of our Duty. For however much we have lost the relish of true Happiness, yet not the sense of Pain &amp; Misery; So that what Love does not attract, Fear may excite.</P>
<P N="2">2. That other Expression of <HI>Honouring the King;</HI> includes all Loyalty &amp; due Obedience to the Civil Magistrate: for as the King is the Head and Fountain of Civil Power, so Subordinate Authority, are streams issuing there from. This by a <HI>Metanimia</HI> a Figure often used in Scripture, is sufficiently expres∣sed.</P>
<P>My Method shall be,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>To shew that Religion is the greatest con∣cern of all Orders of Men, and the chiefest Glory of any People.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>That a Spirit of Loyalty is Essential to the Peace &amp; Happiness of a People.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>To Improve the Subject, and Apply the whole to the present Occasion.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. <HI>Religion is the greatest Concern of all Or∣ders of Men, and the chiefest Glory of a People.</HI> This is of universal extent; it reaches, (or
<PB N="10" REF="008267_0009_102E7838CAC602C8"/>
should do) from the King on the Throne, to the Maid behind the Mill. There is none above it, nor any beneath it. Policy, Power, or Opulency, is the assignment of but few, but Religion is incumbent upon all: and it is as Beneficial in its Nature, as it is Extensive in its Regards. It includes the Knowledge of the greatest Things.—The Possession of the best Good;—and the Enjoyment of the most lasting Tranquillity.</P>
<P N="1">1. Religion includes the Knowledge of the Greatest things. To Know God and Christ, Ourselves, and the way to be for ever happy, is certainly the most extensive &amp; useful Know∣ledge. Our Irreligious and unhappy Estate by Nature, is justly called a state of Ig∣norance &amp; Darkness;<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Having the under∣standing darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance which is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts.</HI> Now the very Nature &amp; Design of Religion, is <HI>To open</HI> our <HI>eyes, and to turn</HI> us <HI>from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that</HI> we <HI>may receive forgiveness of sins, and in∣heritance among them which are sanctified by faith in</HI> Christ.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts 26. 18.</NOTE> The Knowledge of God in his Nature and Perfections, is truly Excellent and Desirable: It gives the greatest Delight and Satisfaction to the Soul, to Discover and Contemplate those his Perfections: For
<PB N="11" REF="008267_0010_102E78ECD50C59F8"/>
whatever is Beautiful and Amiable, as it is dispersed &amp; scattered in the Creature, is Com∣pleat &amp; Centers in God: and not only so, but it Exceeds our Comprehension and Con∣ception: and there is an agreeable satisfaction in gazing upon, and adoring Incomprehen∣sibility; and being swallowed up in the Im∣mensity of the Divine Perfections.</P>
<P>Again, To Know God in his Communi∣cations, in the Manifestations which he has made of himself in the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngdom of Nature and Providence; but especially in the Dis∣pensations of his Grace: This is Useful, En∣riching and Ravishing. <HI>All thy works do praise thee, &amp; thy saints shall bless thee!</HI> The works of Creation and Providence, do plainly shew forth the Being of a God; But the work of Redemption shews what Kind of Being, God is: One Glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders. The Knowledge of God in Christ, &amp; in the work of Redemption thro' him, is an Happiness which even the Angels seem to be surprized at, 1 Pet. 1. 12.—<HI>Which things the Angels desire to look into.</HI> It is the great Mystery of Godliness, the Design of Eternal Wisdom, the chiefest of all God's Works: What con∣tains the Glorious wonders of his Mercy and Power; wherein he renders himself most wor∣thy of our supream Veneration &amp; Affection: our most raised Thoughts are Infinitely be∣neath
<PB N="12" REF="008267_0011_102E78F22F825A80"/>
it's Dignity. The Light of the Gospel (says<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bates.</NOTE> one) hath clearly Revealed so much as is Requisite to be Known in our earthly State; yet the Sublimer parts are still Secret, and reserved for a full discovery by the Bright∣ness of our Saviour's Appearance.—It is the most excellent Knowledge, as that alone which can satisfy the immortal Appetite; and the most Important; for 'tis no less than our Recovery from Extream &amp; Eternal Mi∣sery, and the Restoring of us to the Enjoy∣ment of the Blessed God: a Felicity without Comparison or End: And in proportion to the Regard we have to Salvation, will be our Delight to Know the Means by which we may obtain it.</P>
<P>Therefore, in the next place; To Know Jesus Christ, the Author and Finisher of our Faith, &amp; consequently of our Salvation, must needs be the most Necessary and Excellent Knowledge. For it is of absolute Necessity that we Know God in Christ in order to our being happy: <HI>For this is Life Eternal to Know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI> We must Know him to be more than meerly the Messenger of God, to Publish the glad Tidings of Salvation, and to Direct in the way of Life: we must Know him to be the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God and the <HI>Power</HI> of God; by the Effectual Application of his
<PB N="13" REF="008267_0012_102E78F5E5688DA8"/>
Grace to us by his Holy Spirit. But to know him after this manner, we must at the same time know our own Misery &amp; Unworthiness, together with the need we have of a Mediator. <HI>Cognosce te ipsum,</HI> Know thy Self; was esteem∣ed a Divine Sentence, by the Learned Hea∣then, and is known to be of the greatest im∣portance by the experienced Christian. We ought by no means to separate those two parts of Knowledge; because each alone, is not only unprofitable but dangerous. For as <HI>Monsieur Paschal</HI> observes, The Know∣ledge of God without the Knowledge of our own Misery, is the Nurse of Pride: The Knowledge of our own Misery, without the Knowledge of Jesus Christ is the Mother of Despair. But the true Knowledge of Jesus Christ exempts us alike from Pride and from Despair; by giving us at once a Sight, not only of God, &amp; of our own Misery, but also of the Mercy of God in the Relief of our Misery, We may Know God without Knowing our own Misery; or we may Know our own Misery without Knowing God; or we may Know them both without Knowing the Means of Obtaining from God the Relief of our Misery: But we cannot Know Jesus Christ, without the Knowledge of our Miseries and their Cure. In as much as Jesus Christ is not only God, but he is God under this Cha∣racter, the Healer &amp; Repairer of our Miseries.
<PB N="14" REF="008267_0013_102E78F9503765D0"/>
Thus all they that seek God without Jesus Christ can never meet with such Light in their enquiries, as may afford them true Satisfac∣tion, or solid Comfort; because God is Known and communed with, but in &amp; by a Mediator.</P>
<P N="2">2. Religion puts the Subject into the pos∣session of the best Good. Here I would be understood, what I mean by Religion, when I say, it includes the Knowledge of the great∣est Things, and the Possession of the best Good, &amp;c. <HI>viz.</HI> a Divine Principle implant∣ed in the Soul which Disposes and Qualifies it for the Service and Enjoyment of God. The unhappy mistake which mankind so ge∣nerally labour under with respect to the Nature of Religion, is the sad Occasion of its being so much Neglected or Perverted. The conception of its being an Exteriour Bu∣siness, is the Occasion of its being made an Engine of State, or a Nose of Wax that may serve every purpose. But as Mr. <HI>Shaw</HI> ob∣serves, It is not so much given of God, as itself is something of God in the Soul: as the Soul is not so properly said to give, as to be the Life of Man. As the Conjunction of the Soul with the Body, so verily the Life of the Soul stands in its Conjunction with God, by a spiritual Union of Will and Affections. The nearness to God, which a Soul Enjoys by Religion is called a Cohabitation. Thus it is
<PB N="15" REF="008267_0014_102E78FE88BC5018"/>
expressed in Scripture;<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isa. 57. 15.</NOTE> <HI>I Dwell in the high and holy Place, with him also that is of a hum∣ble Spirit.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 6. 16.</NOTE> <HI>As God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph, 3. 17.</NOTE> <HI>That Christ may dwell in their Hearts by Faith.</HI><NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 3. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Know ye not that ye are the Temples of the Lord, &amp; that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you, &amp;c.</HI> By all which Expressions, it is evident, that there is a most agreeable Intercourse between God, &amp; the Religious Soul; and that hereby it actu∣ally Possesseth the greatest and best Good. For his Favour is Life, and his Loving kind∣ness is better than Life itself. Which brings me to the last Thing under this Head, viz.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is the Enjoyment of the most lasting Tranquility. There is not all that Advan∣tage and Comfort in a Dignified State, that we are ready to apprehend at a Distance: Good and Grand, are different Things. The Great and the Opulent are ordinarily Envied, as the most Comfortable and Happy part of Mankind: But those who possess this Station, find they have their Difficulties, which at Times are so Pressing, that they deserve Pity rather than Envy. But the Soul that possesses that Divine Principle of Re∣ligion, is sure of Comfort, let its external Circumstances be as they will. This Teach∣es how to be Abased and how to Abound, and in every State to be Content. It
<PB N="16" REF="008267_0015_102E79000FC1BCB8"/>
enlightens the Understanding, informs the Judgment, influences the Will, regulates the Passions and Affections, and gives the Man the entire Possession of himself, in the midst of Hurry and Tumult. It is like that benign Stream, of which the Psalmest speaks in Psalm 46. <HI>We will not Fear, though the Earth be Removed, &amp; though the Mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea; though the Waters thereof Roar, and be Troubled; though the Mountains Shake with the Swelling thereof: There is a River the</HI> Streams <HI>whereof shall make glad the City of our God.</HI> To be at Peace with God, and our own Consciences, is the most stable Peace, and affords the most last∣ing Tranquility: and with all its present Ad∣vantages, it is but a prelude and foretaste of what we may Expect to possess and enjoy, in a future and eternal State. There is nothing we have now Observed of Religion in its Na∣ture and Influence, but what is accomodate to all Men; and peculiarly Incumbent upon those in Authority and Power; as we shall have Occasion to consider more particularly hereafter.</P>
<P>II. <HI>That a Spirit of Loyalty, is Essential to the present Comfort and Happiness of a People: and really comes within our Religious Profession and Engagement.</HI></P>
<P>A just discharge of the Duties of the second Table, are as Incumbent as those of the first.
<PB N="17" REF="008267_0016_102E79022565BB00"/>
For as we are to Love the Lord our God with all our Heart and Strength, and Might, so we are to Love our Neighbour as our Selves: and in the discharge of Relative Duty (under which comes that of Loyalty) consists, no small part of our Religion, and the Comfort and Happiness of the present Life. A due Obedience to all proper Authority, is not only the Beauty, but Strength &amp; Glory of a People. But Mutiny &amp; Rebellion, are as distructive to the Political Body, as Sword and Pestilence to the Natural. There is a certain Mechanic Order, which is Requisite to adjust the movements of every kind of Body; which if disconcerted, will destroy the modle of the whole; and incapacitate the same for proper action. Where Pride &amp; Vanity is so preva∣lent, as to render Men uneasy in their proper Station, and troublesome to their Superiors▪ it fills the State with Disorder &amp; Confusion▪ It marrs its Beauty, &amp; saps its Strength: The most effective method for preventing or cor∣recting of which is, to comply with the In∣junction of the Apostle, viz. For every Man to abide steadfast in the calling where with God hath called him; and be content with the as∣signments of Providence. God's <HI>Israel</HI> of Old, was never so Renowned &amp; Happy, as when under proper restrictions with respect to their Order &amp; Government. When there were Wise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Faithful Men at Helm, and the Peo∣ple
<PB N="18" REF="008267_0017_102E7903AB7F0280"/>
were Subject &amp; Loyal, things went well in <HI>Judah.</HI> They were then the envy of their Neighbours, and a terror to their Enemies: But as soon as ever, there comes an Arbitrary Prince on the Throne, and a mutinous &amp; re∣bellious Spirit prevails among the People, they immediately become a Pray to the Ene∣my, a Reproach to their Neighbours, &amp; Pest to themselves. This is evident by comparing the state of this People, under the Reign and Government of <HI>David, Solomon,</HI> &amp; <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> who were Wise, Judicious &amp; Prudent Men; and the People were quiet &amp; easy under their Administration: and that of <HI>Saul, Rehoboam, Ahab, Jehu,</HI> &amp; <HI>Jehoiakim.</HI> As these Kings were Despotick &amp; Arbitrary in their Govern∣ment, so the People were continually uneasy and mutinous; and the State kept in a per∣petual Fermentation. And as the Apostle Observes, (in another Case) these Things were Written for our Example and Warning. Difficulties in a State, are not so much owing the particular mode of Government, as to the conduct of Rulers, and the disposition of the People. <HI>e. g.</HI> The Empire of <HI>Persia,</HI> has been kept in regular state, that is, Free from In∣surrections and Rebellion, and have acquired great Repute, as well as Conquests under the Government of <HI>Naidar Shab,</HI> their late Prince; who was a very Arbitrary &amp; Sovereign Mo∣narch; but a Man of great Sagacity &amp; Pene∣tration.
<PB N="19" REF="008267_0018_102E7907BA1A5420"/>
While some other People under the mildest Government, and best Constitution, have been distressed by intestine Jarrs, and re∣bellious Practices: So that Loyalty, more than mere Policy, Happifies a People. And indeed, a Mutinous, Uneasy, and Disloyal Con∣duct, would be the most inexcusable in this People of any under Heaven. For the World knows not a more just and happy Constituti∣on, or a more mild and faithful Administra∣tion than ours is. For with respect to our Liberties and Priviledges, both Civil and Sa∣cred; God may say, as of his People of old; <HI>What could I have done more that I have not done for it.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isa. 5. 4.</NOTE> But notwithstanding; it is often the Case of the best Constituted States, to be infested with Malecontents, and troubled with pestiferous Incendiaries. There were some of this Temper, as early as the Apostles Days. St. <HI>Jude,</HI> calls them, <HI>Filthy Dreamers, who despise Dominion, and speak Evil of Dignities, raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own Shame; wandering Stars, to whom is re∣served the Blackness of Darkness for ever.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8. 9.</NOTE> And it is observable, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> as well as St. <HI>Jude,</HI> speaks of this as the most bold and audacious Crime: 2 Pet. 2. 10. <HI>Presumptu∣ous are they; Self-willed, they are not affraid to speak Evil of Dignities; whereas Angels which are greater in Power and Might, bring not a</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="008267_0019_102E799ABAAF3D38"/>
<HI>railing Accusation against them before the Lord.</HI>—Whoever is acquainted with the English Annals, must needs see the Difficulties and Dangers which our Nation has often been re∣duced to, by the prevalency of this unhappy Spirit: And indeed, we are not altogether Strangers to it, here. But wherever it pre∣vails, it is (as one justly observes) like a Mu∣tiny in an Army, or a Gangreen in the Body, that will soon prove Fatal, if not seasonably suppressed: It is a Fire that will Consume even to the Foundations of Zion. As this is pregnant with every Evil; so on the con∣trary, a Spirit of Loyalty, Peace and due Sub∣jection, is productive of every Good: Ami∣able in its Nature, and Excellent in its Conse∣quences. <HI>Behold how Good &amp; how Pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity! It is like the precious Ointment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even Aarons Beard, that went down to the skirts of his Gar∣ment; as the Dew of Hermon, and as the Dew that descendeth upon the Mountains of Zion.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. 133.</NOTE></P>
<P>III. I proceed now to Improve the Subject, and to Apply the same to the present Occa∣sion.</P>
<P N="1">1. If Religion &amp; Loyalty be so much the Glory of a People; we may hence learn the Occasion of the present Abject State of our
<PB N="21" REF="008267_0020_102E799C4515BE18"/>
Nation and Land. These Graces are much wanting: There is an awful decay of Reli∣gion, and an unreasonable Spirit of Jealousy and Disquietude prevailing▪ the fear of God is amazingly cast off in this day: While some are disputing the Personallity of the God∣head, and denying the Lord that bought them; others are ridiculing the important Doc∣trine of Atonement, and casting contempt upon the efficacious Merits of a Glorious Re∣deemer; many are exploding the Doctrine of free &amp; sovereign Grace, and exalting hu∣mane Nature under all its Depravity, to a si∣tuation equal to all its Necessities; thereby perverting the Designs of the Gospel, and frustrating as far as may be, the Means of our Salvation: If such Error in Theory, no won∣der there is so much Iniquity in Practice. Alas for the many crying Evils wherewith our Nation and Land Abounds! too many now to be Numbred; I shall only in general mention, our Infidelity, Formality and Pro∣phanation of God's holy Name and Day; our Abuse of a Saviour, and the Operations of his holy Spirit, together with a Contempt of the Gospel and its Ordinances; our Rebel∣lion and Disobedience to just Authority; our Pride, Enmity, Luxury and Profuseness; our Impurity and Intemperance; our Avarice, Oppression &amp; Injustice; False-swearing, Lying, Slandering, Reviling, Envying and Defaming

of others. For this the Land Mourns, and for these Things our God who is highly Dis∣honoured and Offended, has been answering his People by Terrible Things in Righteous∣ness; and is justly bringing on us many grie∣vous Calamities, and especially the present distressed War, which is full fraught with many Evils; such as great decay of Trade, heavy Debts, Plunders, Barbarities, Captivities, loss of Estates and Lives, with a vast variety of other distressing Troubles.—And after se∣veral expensive Campaigns we have little to boast of, but much to be humble under.—The advantages the Enemy have gained upon us, in the Demolition of several of our For∣tresses, the loss of our Artillery, Provisions and Military Stores; together with the Capture of so many of our Forces, carries a very hum∣bling Aspect. And notwithstanding the Mighty Armament sent us from <HI>Europe,</HI> by our most Gracious King, for our Relief, both by Sea and Land; may we not, in the Lan∣guage of the affectionate Prophet, be wail our State, and in some Measure say? <HI>The Har∣vest is past, the Summer is ended, and we are not Saved.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jer. 8. 20.</NOTE> May God of his Mercy prosper and succeed his Majesty's Arms in the current Year; and Save a sinking Nation and Land from impending Ruin; wipe off the Reproach that is cast upon us, and suffer us not to become a Taunt and a Proverb!</P>

<HI>Use</HI> 2. Hence see the Necessity of a Re∣formation. As Religion and Loyalty is the Glory &amp; Safety of a People; so the want of Religion &amp; Virtue, is always proportionably their Disgrace &amp; Disadvantage: For as Righ∣teousness Exalteth a Nation, so Sin is the De∣struction of a People. But the Necessity of a Reformation is peculiarly Obvious at this day. The Most High is manifestly Contro∣verting with us: And the Consequence we may expect will be in the Reformation or Dis∣truction of this People. We have had pre∣vious &amp; sufficient Intimations of the Divine Displeasure: But now God seems to be deal∣ing out the Cup of Trembling, Red with In∣dignation. He has Righteously drawn forth the Sword of the Wilderness against us, to a∣venge the Breach of his Holy Covenant; in letting loose a Numerous, Savage and Blood-Thirsty People, to make Spoil of us, and lay waste his Heritage. Like the <HI>Medes</HI> of old, <HI>They regard not Silver, and as for Gold, they do not desire it; Their Bows do dash the young Men to pieces, and they have no pity on the fruit of the Womb, and their Eyes spare not the Children.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 13. 17, 18.</NOTE> These in Combination with a perfidious &amp; antichristian Nation, are God's Scourge, wherewith he is Correcting of us: And if, what we have reason to fear, should come upon us; How Miserable is our Con∣dition
<PB N="24" REF="008267_0023_102E79A4F6F7E258"/>
What but a Principle of Religion, a stedfast Trust in God could support us? This indeed, like an Anchor to the Soul, is sure and stedfast: <HI>For in the multitude of my Thoughts within me, Thy Comforts delight my Soul.</HI> And to enforce this, let us consider what we have at Stake. Were we inured to Slavery, and used to Bonds; were it barely changing Masters, and going but from one State of Servitude to another, it were not so much: But it is changing Liberty for Slavery, and the most free and generous State, for the most vile and abject. Who that has ever enjoyed the benign Shade, &amp; tasted the sweet Fruits of the <HI>British</HI> Vine, can bear the thoughts of being Tom with the <HI>Gallic</HI> Bramble? How shocking are the tho'ts of being a Con∣quered People; of becoming a Province of <HI>France!</HI> and how dreadful must the Conse∣quences needs be! Could we bear to see our Nobles bound in Chains, and our Rulers with fetters of Iron? Our Elders sitting upon the Ground, girded with Sackloth, &amp; covered in Dust? Could we bear to see our Young Men slain with the Sword, and our Maidens Ravished in the Streets? Our Children and Sucklings swooning for want of Sustenance, and pouring out their Souls in their Mothers bosoms?—Dare we Renounce our Faith, &amp; abandon our Profession? Or can we Suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Religion! One of which, it seems
<PB N="25" REF="008267_0024_102E79A82EBCF358"/>
we must soon be bro't to, should we be so unhappy, as to fall into the hands of our Ene∣mies. We surely could have but little hopes of a Toleration, since it is not allowed to Homeborn Subjects: And the absolute Will of that Arbitrary Monarch, is, that all his Sub∣jects shall have but one Religion. While I look into the train of Evils, which it seems must be the inevitable Consequence of such a disaster, I must say with the Poet.</P>
<P><HI>Obriguere com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, vox Faucibus h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sit.</HI></P>
<P>My Hair stiffens with Horror, &amp; my Voice faulters in my Jaws. Or, rather with the af∣fectionate Prophet: <HI>Mine Eyes do fail with Tears, and my Bowels are troubled within me.</HI> But as we would avoid those Calamities, we must Renounce our evil Practices, and forsake our Iniquities: For after all that has yet been done, God's Anger is not turned away, but his Hand is stretched out still. Tho' by the many Gracious Interpositions of Provi∣dence for our Relief, when in the most ex∣tream Danger; God shews a desire of our Reformation &amp; not Destruction. His Bowels yearn, and his Compassion is kindled towards us: (and speaking after the manner of men) He seems loath to give us up a Prey, and to deliver us into the hands of the Enemy, to be Consumed and Destroyed. <HI>How shall I make thee as Admah, I how shall I set thee as Zeboim!</HI> Wherefore let us be perswaded, to
<PB N="26" REF="008267_0025_102E79AFC1496820"/>
break off our Sins by Righteousness, and our Iniquities by shewing Mercy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Poor, if it may be a lengthening out of our Tranqui∣lity.</P>
<P N="3">3. For Application of what has been said; I would Observe, that Religion which is so universally necessary, is peculiarly incumbent upon Rulers, and those in a Dignified State. And that especially as it has the most direct &amp; powerful tendency to Assimilate them to the likeness of the Divine Original of all Power: and Qualifies them for the most happy way of Governing. It fills Men with Noble, Ge∣nerous, &amp; Heroick Principles; and disposes them to answer the ends of their Exaltation. It cures them of what is Little, Mean and Selfish; and puts them upon seeking the Good of others more than themselves. It will cer∣tainly correct their inordinate Affection of ex∣orbitant Power, and unreasonable Greatness; by teaching them the Honour &amp; Advantage, of Self-Conquest. The same holy Principle, will polish their rough Natures, and sweeten their Tempers, and make them Amiable, as well as Honourable in the sight of their Bre∣thren: Whereas Irreligion and Impiety, does strangely lessen Greatness, and secretly &amp; un∣avoidably derive some Weakness, even upon Authority itself. But Religion will greatly strengthen their Authority, as it naturally pro∣cures
<PB N="27" REF="008267_0026_102E79B15E1EF3E8"/>
a Veneration, &amp; commands Reverence. This will put them under a double Advan∣tage; that whiles they adorn their Posts, they best serve the People; and are themselves Examples of what they enjoin others by Pre∣cept. It will set them above the flatteries of fawning Sychophants, or the unreasonable murmurs of a giddy Populace. In a word, it will be the best Support under the present Weight of Government, and the only Title to a future and glorious Reward. Now then, this being the happy Effect of Religion in Rulers, what may we not Expect from our Honourable Legislature. And since his Ho∣nour, has assigned it as my Province to Of∣ficiate on this publick and solemn Occasion, (Conscious indeed I am of my own Inequality and Insufficiency for the Business) but not∣withstanding, I trust I have Liberty to Ad∣dress myself to your Honours, the Legisla∣ture of this Government, now convened in this Place.</P>
<P>Honoured and much Esteemed;</P>
<P>I am sensible you are called in Providence to take the Conduct of this People, in as Dif∣ficult and Critical a Season, perhaps, as our Land has ever yet Known: And will there∣fore see the Necessity of what I have been Urging, and will not be wanting in your Places to Enforce the same, as the most effective Method for the lengthening out of our Tran∣quillity
<PB N="28" REF="008267_0027_102E79B3051A4258"/>
—It has pleased the Most High to raise you up for such a Day as this; a Day wherein all the Liberties and Priviledges of this People, both Civil and Sacred are struck at; and all that is worth Enjoying is at Stake; even Life itself not excepted. And whiles we are Invaded by so Numerous, Potent and Crafty an Enemy, who have already obtained to many Advantages against us, and are still exerting their whole <HI>Posse</HI> to subject us: And withal so many intestine Jarrs, shrewd Suspicions and Jealousies, unreasonable Mur∣murings and Repinings, it surely requires a steady Hand and a gallant Heart at Helm. Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Minds &amp; be Strong: only be thou strong and very couragious, that thou mayest observe to do all that the Law of the Lord Requireth thee, turn not from it, to the right Hand or to the left, that thou mayest Prosper, whither soever thou goest. And by how much the more Pressing and Difficult our Circumstances are, by so much the more Active and Vigorous, may your Zeal and Attention be. Your Ho∣nours are very Sensible the present Season is on some Accounts, the most Critical and Im∣portant, which this Country ever saw. We are pursued by an Active, Perfidious, Savage Enemy, with such Vigour and Rage, as ex∣ceeds all their past Diligence, Courage and Resolution. They give us sufficient Reason,
<PB N="29" REF="008267_0028_102E79B48FA34008"/>
to be Convinced, they are Resolved to execute a Plan which was long since laid by the ablest States-Man they ever had; and which if God shall please to allow them to Execute; this Country is like to be a Theatre of War and Misery, in succeeding Times; or the fair Pa∣trimony which has been left us, become a Prey of the worst of Men. We have now for Years past, with small and weak Efforts, and the Groans of great Burdens and Expence, been labouring in doing nothing, but expose our∣selves to the Scorn and Reproach of the World.</P>
<P>I think it my Duty now to Congratulate your Honours, and my Country; that God has put it into the Heart of the King, and his Ministers to Appoint, and to Call and En∣courage us to such Measures, as present us with the fairest Hopes (humanly speaking) that we ever had, of curbing and bringing to Reason, the most Inveterate, Ambitious and Restless Enemy in the World; and obliging them to let us live in Peace. These Measures, for Substance, are such as all Wise, Discerning Lovers of their Country, have been wishing for.—We Congratulate ourselves, that God has disposed the Hearts of our Rulers so Readily &amp; Amply to Provide for the exerting the Strength of this Colony, so that nothing may be want∣ing on our Part, to the carrying the King's wise and kind Purposes for us into Execution.
<PB N="30" REF="008267_0029_102E79BB03FCDBD8"/>
—I believe it is the sincere Wish of every Honest Lover of his Country, and of a King who greatly Deserves the Love and Revere∣rence of all his Subjects, that nothing may Hinder, Discourage or Retard your Resolutions in this Interesting Affair; and that you may be Successful in your Endeavours to Excite and Prevail with the other Colonies to do their just Proportion, to rid these <HI>British</HI> Govern∣ments from the Hands of strange Children; and that the backwardness of Others, may not be the Means of our being again made a Prey to deceitful Men; and rendering our Efforts Unsuccessful. And while 'tis the general Cry of this People, <HI>Delenda Est Carthago;</HI> How unhappy will it be, if those who are greatly Concerned, and ought to exert them∣selves with Vigour and Chearfulness, should by with-holding the Help they ought to af∣ford in this Exigence, expose their Brethren, and in the End themselves to Ruin? and bring the Angel's Curse upon them, Judg. 5. 23. <HI>Curse ye Meroz, Curse ye bitterly the Inhabi∣tants thereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the Mighty.</HI> All the Help they can Afford, will be little enough in this Trying Time. The want of the two great Things required in my Text, <HI>Fearing God, and Honouring the King,</HI> will be the most certain Means to hinder our
<PB N="31" REF="008267_0030_102E79BC96002038"/>
Success. If we Repent in Earnest, and by a thorough Reformation return to God; if we faithfully exert ourselves in obedience to the King's Demands; if the Measures proposed, be steadily and vigorously pursued, we have the fairest Prospect of Success we ever saw.—We trust your Honours will not be wanting in either of these, to do your part. It is ea∣sily foreseen, that the Consequence of the pre∣sent Campaign, is like to be Happy or Fatal to this Country. We trust you will to your utmost, promote a Reformation in the Land, and discourage Prophaneness, Wickedness, and Indolence in the Army.—How can we expect to Conquer our Enemies, when by Irreligion and Stupidity at Home, and Pro∣phaneness, Impiety, and Contempt of the God of Hosts, in the Army, we are daily provoking Heaven and Arming divine Ven∣geance against us!</P>
<P>But however much the Important Affairs of the War, may engross your Time and Thoughts; that yet you will not abate of your usual Beneficence both to Church and State: and in Special that our College may enjoy your Patronage and Protection: That it may be for a Name and a Praise, and the Cities of our God may be made glad thereby. And that all Parts of your Administration being duly Dispensed, not only the present, but
<PB N="32" REF="008267_0031_102E79BE3008A568"/>
future Generations may rise up and call you Blessed.—</P>
<P N="2">2. If Religion and Loyalty be so essential to the present Comfort, and future Happiness of Mankind; then surely it becomes us, my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, to be Ex∣amples to the Flock, as well as Zealous Teachers of these important Doctrines. For of all Men, we are under the most peculiar Obligations, so to walk as to please God: and consequently to have the Principles of Religion, and Holiness wrought in our Souls, so as to Influence the whole of our Ministra∣tions: and what we inculcate by Precept, we enforce by Example.—We may remember, that one Aggravated Circumstance in that Notable Rebellion of <HI>Chorah</HI> and his Accom∣plices; is, that it was Headed by <HI>Levites,</HI> and the Principal Incendiaries, were of the Holy Order; which brought a swift and strange Destruction, on those Miserable Mu∣tineers.</P>
<P>As Ministers are like to be useful accor∣ding to their Influence, so it highly Concerns them to make a proper Use of what Influ∣ence they have. Our Nation yet feels the sad Effects of unreasonably urging the Doc∣trines of Passive Obedience, and Non-Re∣sistance, in the Support of a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, and the Encouragement of Numbers of Male-contents.
<PB N="33" REF="008267_0032_102E79C0DFB9BFF8"/>
I wish there were no Danger from the opposite Extream. But as <HI>New-En∣gland,</HI> has hitherto been justly Famed for Loyalty as well as Zeal; so let us not be wanting in our Places to give all suitable En∣couragement and Example of it: and as far as possible to instill into our People the prin∣ciples of Loyalty and Obedience. And in such a Day as this, when Things bear so threatning an Aspect in Providence, let us not neglect to enforce the necessity of Re∣pentance and Reformation. We are now especially to cry Aloud and spare not, but lift up our Voice like a Trumpet, and warn the People of their Sins, and Professors of their Transgressions. While God in his Pro∣vidence is giving so many Tokens of his Dis∣pleasure, He justly Expects, that his Embas∣sadours do urge and enforce them, to excite Reformation and Amendment, in his Peo∣ple. And may it not be well to encourage and continue the Practice of devoting some pittance of Time in every Week to social Prayer; for the Revival of Religion, and the Success of his Majesty's Arms, both in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> and <HI>America:</HI> Agreeable to the Exam∣ple of many of our Protestant Brethren in <HI>Europe,</HI> who, (it seems) are much Encoura∣ged, from the gracious Returns they have already received. For the Language of Pro∣vidence,
<PB N="34" REF="008267_0033_102E79C49E37A438"/>
seems very expresly to Concur with that of Scripture.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Let the Priests, the Mi∣nisters of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them say, Spare thy People O Lord, and give not thine Heritage to Reproach, that the Heathen should Rule over them; wherefore should they say among the People, where is their God?</HI> Upon the faith∣ful and conscientious Discharge of this our Duty, we have the Encouragement to be Answered, as in the next Words, viz. <HI>Then will the Lord be jealous for his Land, and pity his People▪</HI> Let us be Importunate at the Throne of Grace, at this Day, for the Divine Presence with our Authority, both Supream and Subordinate: <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Hur,</HI> must sup∣port <HI>Moses'</HI>s Hands while the Armies are contending; for if they fall, the Enemy pre∣vails: This we must do, until the Victory is obtained, and the Cause decided. And don't let any Thing be Wanting that is within our Power to do.—And until God in his Providence shall prohibit, and say, <HI>Pray not for this People;</HI> let the Language of our Practice concur with the Reply of <HI>Samuel; God forbid that we should Cease to Pray for you.</HI></P>
<P>III. And to Conclude▪ I must Observe, that Religion is of the greatest Importance
<PB N="35" REF="008267_0034_102E79C78A758550"/>
to the People, (as well as Rulers) to dispose them to Subject becomingly to proper Au∣thority; and yield Obedience from Princi∣ples of Conscience, more than merely of Fear. For if Laws were as well adjusted as those of <HI>Solon,</HI> or as possitive as those of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> of old; they would prove in∣effectual without something more Coercive than merely their own Restrictions. But he that is Actuated by Religion, will cheerfully comply with Duty, and be afraid of Rebel∣lion, because he believes that whosoever re∣sisteth Authority, resisteth the Ordinance of God; and that they who resist shall receive to themselves Damnation. But then, Reli∣gion, really fits Men for this, as well as en∣joins them to it: It Mortifies their Lusts of Pride, Hatred, Revenge, &amp;c. It furnishes them with a Meek &amp; Quiet Spirit, and Con∣vinces them of the Reasonableness of that great Rule of Equity; <HI>Whatsoever ye would that Men should do unto you, do ye even so to them:</HI> And it Endowes them with Princi∣ples of Truth, Honestly and Loyalty.—And in as much as the Most High, is pleased to Indulge us with those Priviledges and Liberties, whereby we are favoured above many of our Brethren; in that we have our Rulers as at the first, and our Judges as at the beginning▪ And not only have the Liberty
<PB N="36" REF="008267_0035_102E79C95EB01828"/>
of Choosing our Rulers from among our∣selves; but those that are Chosen, are and have been, so much an Honour to their Sta∣tion, and a Blessing to the People; con∣cerned for the Cause of God, and the Pub∣lick Good: <HI>Men that fear God, and eschew Evil;</HI> That have Served the State with Faith∣fulness &amp; Conducted with Honour. Since this, I say, is our Case, it shews us the pe∣culiar Obligations we are under, to live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godliness &amp; Ho∣nesty: paying a just Defference to their Au∣thority; and to esteem them very highly in Love, for their works sake. To be Generous in their Support, and Tender of their Cha∣racter, and Good Name; and above all to Pray earnestly to God for them, that they may be Directed in Duty, Supported in Go∣vernment, and Endowed with the Blessings of his Grace and Goodness, which shall a∣bundantly fit them for the Rewards of the Faithful.</P>
<P>And upon this joyful Occasion, of our ANNIVERSARY ELECTION; While our Eyes do see all those Great &amp; Good things, which the Lord hath done for us, and yet continues to us; Should not our Hearts be raised in peculiar Strains of Gratitude and Thankfulness? And pay our Acknowledg∣ments in the Language of <HI>David▪</HI> 1 Chron.

29. 11, 12, 13. <HI>Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven, and in the earth, is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious Name▪</HI>—And let us Remember that in the midst of all these Civil Priviledges, our Ingratitude is enhanced and aggravated; while we re∣main Irreligious; Rebels to the Throne and Dignity of Heaven; and all this goodness of God, has no Effect to lead us to Repen∣tance: For if like <HI>Capernaum,</HI> we have been Exalted with Priviledges, like them, we must expect to be cast down, if we Misimprove and Abuse them.</P>
