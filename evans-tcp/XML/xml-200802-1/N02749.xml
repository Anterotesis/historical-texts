<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Sincere and disinterested regard for the good of my Neighbours, is the motive of this present Publication: without Passion or Prejudice, laying aside all useless Speculations and Sub∣tilities, as out of the Question in cases of Fact and Experience; I shall impartially relate, The
<PB REF="003274_0003_0FF02FF947AB1E98"/>
History, Success and, Benefits of the Method of receiving the Small Pox by Incisions or Inoculation, as it is called, so far as it has come to my know∣ledge. Altercations in matters of Fact obvious to the Senses, are trifling and absurd; let Facts be truly related and set in a proper Method or Light, the generality of Mankind are capable to judge for themselves. I shall not be too free with Names of Persons, only where the vouching of Facts may seem to require it. There have been too early and strong Prejudices, both for and against this Me∣thod; People have been partially Credulous or Incre∣dulous of Facts, as they make for or against their respective Opinions, <HI>viz,</HI> In some it savoured much of Credulity, Levity, and Novelty, to be bigotly Zealous for it; in others it show'd too much of strong Pre∣judices, Passions or Obstinate Humour, to be furi∣ously against it: they seem to have acted the fairest part, who exclaiming only against rash and irregu∣lar procedure, were willing to wait patiently until time and a cautious experience should direct their judgments.</P>
<P>MANY great discoveries in Physick have been opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed by the generality of the Faculty at their first appearance, Antimonial Vomits, Mercurial Preparations, the Peruvian Bark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had this fate; but are now by experience proved to be the best of Medicines. It was not by reasoning we learnt that the Bark cures Agues, that Opium relieves Pain, or Mercury carries off the Venereal taint; it was by accident, but afterwards confirmed by Ex∣perience.
<PB REF="003274_0004_0FF030014CECD298"/>
How mean or rash soever the beginning of the Practice of Inoculating the Small Pox may have been; if many Years practised by Old Wo∣men only, and neglected by the Sons of Art in Turky; if in another part of the World a Person of no Literature and of habitual Rashness, from a third hand hearsay of an ever Credulous person, first attempted it indifferently on all who would pay for it, without regard to Age, Sex, Constitution, other Circumstances, and Caution's which tryals of such Consequence may require; as it is one of the inconveniences of Humane Life, that all the World over, Ignorance, Assurance and Rashness pushes on some to attempt without fear or discretion what would make the most exquisite Artist tremble to touch; nevertheless if in the Event by repeated ex∣periments it prove useful, it ought to be embraced.</P>
<P>WE find by some Years Experience, that the Small Pox abstractedly considered, received by In∣oculation is not so Fatal and the Symptoms frequently more mild, than in the accidental Contagion; yet it is not of that certain safety, to exempt it from be∣ing reckoned precarious, and therefore requires Dis∣cretion in applying it to proper Subjects, and Judg∣ment in managing the Distemper so receiv'd.</P>
<P>THE reason of my Addressing this to You, Sir, Is as a sort of Publick Acknowledgement of your Friendship; but more especially because of your noted Probity, Integrity, and Impartiality in all Affairs: in your Office with an unbiassed Duty to the Crown,

<HEAD>A Dissertation CONCERNING Inoculation of the <HI>Small-Pox.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Circassians</HI> living between the <HI>Euxine</HI> and <HI>Caspian</HI> Seas, time out mind, have carried on a considera∣ble Trade with <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> in Selling their own Children, or young Slaves taken by Incursions from their Neigh∣bours; but more especially their <HI>Young Women</HI> being very Beautiful, are in great request in the <HI>Seraglios</HI> and <HI>Harams</HI> of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI>: while they are Children, they procure to them the <HI>Small Pox</HI> by <HI>Inoculation</HI> or otherways; those who retain their Beauties, are <HI>Merchantable,</HI> and bear a good Price: So that the first Intention of <HI>Inoculation</HI> was not the <HI>Saving of Life,</HI> but as a more ready way of procuring the Small-Pox, than by accidental Infection; that they might

know what <HI>Beauties</HI> were proof and would an∣swer the charge of being carried to <HI>Market.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Circassian</HI> Trade conveyed this Practice into <HI>Turky,</HI> where the <HI>Turks</HI> at first from their Principle of <HI>Predestination,</HI> would not come into it; only the <HI>Old Women</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, practised it among the meaner sort of People for some considerable time, says <HI>Pylarinus,</HI> and that <HI>A.</HI> 1701, it first began to be used amongst the better sort in <HI>Constantinople.</HI> His first Patients, were the Four Sons of a <HI>Noble Greek.</HI> In some short time after this <HI>Bellini</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> writes an account of it to Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> desiring his Opinion; Dr. <HI>Pitcarn</HI> was very fond of it, but could not persuade himself to venture it in Practice. <HI>Timonius</HI> from <HI>Constantinople A.</HI> 1713, sends to the R.S. in <HI>London</HI> an account of this Prac∣tice, with a very strong recommendation thereof. <HI>Pylarinus</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> Consul <HI>A.</HI> 1714, sent to the <HI>Royal Society</HI> a more modest account of the same. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> spread in <HI>Boston, New-England, A.</HI> 1721, and the Reverend Dr. <HI>Cot∣ton Mather,</HI> having had the use of these Com∣munications from Dr. <HI>William Douglass</HI>; surrepti∣tiously, without the knowledge of his Informer, that he might have the honour of a Newfangled notion, sets and undaunted Operator to work, and in this Country about 290 were <HI>Inoculated.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Communications of <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pyla∣rinus</HI> in <HI>England</HI> were regarded as <HI>Virtuos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> amusements, until <HI>April</HI> 1721, Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> a Surgeon (who in <HI>March</HI> 1717, at <HI>Bora</HI> near <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI> had seen the <HI>British Ambassadors</HI> Son <HI>at.</HI> 6, <HI>Inoculated</HI> by an old <HI>Greek</HI>) from a few

scanty observations but mostly from hearsay, in quality of a <HI>Traveller</HI> was willing to broach a new thing: he <HI>inocutlated</HI> Miss <HI>Wortley aet.</HI> 4, and Dr. <HI>Keiths</HI> Son <HI>aet.</HI> 6 in <HI>May,</HI> who all had a ve∣ry favourable distinct sort. This encouraged many to think well of it, and in particular <HI>The Royal Family</HI> were induced to cause make try∣al of it; accordingly in <HI>August</HI> it was prac∣tised on 6 <HI>Condemned Criminals</HI> in <HI>Newgate, aet.</HI> 19 <HI>ad</HI> 36, no Medicine was used, all was left to <HI>nature</HI> assisted by a strict and regular Diet, they all received the Infection, and had a fa∣vourable <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> excepting <HI>Evans</HI> who had no symptom neither did his Incisions inflame, having had the Small-Pox in Goal last <HI>Septem∣ber.</HI> Some time after this Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> Inocu∣lates Mr. <HI>Batts</HI> Daughter <HI>aet.</HI> 2 &amp; half, <HI>Joseph Heath aet.</HI> 7, and <HI>Benj. Heath aet.</HI> 3; being in all eleven persons Inoculated from <HI>April</HI> to <HI>Decem∣ber</HI>: thus gradually and circumspectly did the people in <HI>England</HI> proceed in a Practice, which might be of consequence good or bad; few of the <HI>English Physicians</HI> favoured it at first, but in some short time Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> began to countenance it, as did also Sir <HI>Hans Sloan.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Spring following, there were <HI>Inocula∣ted</HI> by order of the Ps. of <HI>Wales,</HI> 6 <HI>Hospital Children aet.</HI> 6 <HI>ad.</HI> 20; four of them had it, and very favourable one of them received no Infec∣tion, having evidently had the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> be∣fore; the sixth had accidents from <HI>Inocu∣lation,</HI> which continued in a lesser degree for eleven weeks, and then had a favourable <HI>Small-Pox.</HI> Soon after these, were <HI>Inoculated</HI> 5 more <HI>Hos∣pital

Children aet.</HI> 8. to 14 weeks, 3 of them had no <HI>Small Pox,</HI> these bodies were <HI>morbid. April</HI> 19th. 1722. Mr. <HI>Amyand</HI> Serj. Surgeon, <HI>ingrafted the Small Pox</HI> on Ps. <HI>Amelia aet.</HI> 11, and Ps. <HI>Carolina aet.</HI> 9. they had them favourable; this would have been a very great encouragement and counte∣nance to this Practice, if unluckily it had not happened that in the same month of <HI>April</HI> dy'd the E. of <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s Son <HI>aet.</HI> 2 &amp; half, and next month dy'd my Lord L. <HI>Bathursts</HI> Ser∣vant <HI>aet.</HI> 19 of the Small-Pox procured by <HI>Ino∣culation</HI>: from this time the Practice continues proceeding, but at a much slower pace than was expected; so that from the accounts of the In∣genious Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> R. S. Secr. in all <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> there were <HI>Inoculated</HI> in the first 3 years of the Practice only 477; the Principal <HI>Inoculators</HI> being Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> 80 Patients, Mr. <HI>Amyand</HI> Serj. Surgeon 62, Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> 85, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN this <HI>Practice</HI> was first attempted, some Physicians in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI> parti∣cularly Dr. <HI>Friend,</HI> from the experience of dis∣orders arising in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> by some foreign liquids being directly admitted into the current of <HI>Blood,</HI> by anology were afraid of the like in case of <HI>Inoculation</HI>; but repeated tryals soon convinced them of the safety of this method. In some of the first tryals the produced <HI>Pustules</HI> were either dry without <HI>Pus,</HI> or like a <HI>Spurious Pox</HI> called the <HI>Chicken</HI> or <HI>Swine</HI> Pox, containing no thick digested <HI>Pus</HI> but a thin <HI>Sanies</HI>; hence they alledged that <HI>Inoculation</HI> produced only an <HI>Eruptive Fever</HI> but no <HI>genuine</HI> Small-Pox: but in
<PB N="5" REF="003274_0010_0FF0301576D7FE48"/>
after tryals, seeing in many the <HI>Pustules</HI> rise with inflamed edges, white &amp; afterwards yellow heads, plump and mellow, and go off about the usual time in yellow Scabs, as also finding them <HI>infectious</HI>; they quickly gave up the point, and <HI>declared</HI> them <HI>genuine.</HI> The <HI>Odium</HI> of spread∣ing infection continues a disadvantage; The ingrafting of foreign <HI>constitutional ails</HI> is a stum∣bling block to the nice and cautious.</P>
<P>THE first <HI>Promoters of Inoculation,</HI> on the o∣ther hand, were much more extravagant in their <HI>deviations</HI>; from <HI>hearsay</HI> and a few <HI>scanty</HI> experiments with much <HI>credulity</HI> and <HI>rashness,</HI> they positively and without reserve, published as follows; and in some instances contradict one the other and themselves.</P>
<P><HI>TIMONIUS A.</HI> 1713. says, These last years some thousands have been <HI>Inoculated</HI> and none died, while at the same time half the affected died in the common way at <HI>Constantinople</HI>; and what is valued by the <HI>Fair,</HI> never leaves Scars nor Pits. Infants have no <HI>Convulsions</HI> with it. He knew but of one Boy who did not receive the Small-Pox by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> his incisions did not swell. The <HI>Pustules</HI> never contain a lauda∣ble <HI>Pus,</HI> but a thin watery <HI>Sanies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PYLARINUS</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> Consul, the most modest of all its Promoters, says, I was not an <HI>Eye-witness</HI> to all that I now relate, I had a great part of it by <HI>hearsay.</HI> The <HI>Operatrix</HI> re∣quired the <HI>Winter</HI> season. The <HI>Eruption</HI> gene∣rally begins the 7th day; there are instances tho' but few, where the <HI>Eruptions</HI> have appea∣red the first day. <HI>Inoculation</HI> sometimes does
<PB N="6" REF="003274_0011_0FF03019E40C1E70"/>
not take place. In some, tho' very seldom, in the <HI>glandulous</HI> parts &amp; <HI>Emunctories, Abcesses</HI> do arise after some time.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Le Duc</HI> a Native of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and who was himself inoculated, assured Dr. <HI>Jurin,</HI> that out of many thousands that in the space of a∣bout 40 years past, had been inoculated in and about <HI>Constantinople</HI> by one Greek woman, not so much as one person has miscarried.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Maitlands account.</HI> Dying is a case which never happened in <HI>Ingrafting.</HI> The giving the Small-Pox by <HI>Inoculation,</HI> never yet failed, nor never can. No Headakes, Thirst, Inquietudes, and other Fever Symptoms, not one in a thou∣sand. Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI> who inoculated great num∣bers, says from his own experience: <HI>The Symp∣toms are as in the natural way, a quick pulse, great heat and thirst, pain in the Head and Back, and about the region of the Stomach, Vomiting, Do∣sedness, Startings, and sometimes Convulsions.</HI> Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> further says, The <HI>Pustules</HI> never leaves any <HI>Pits</HI> behind them: And in his <HI>Vindication,</HI> printed in Autumn, 1722. says, that out of a∣bout 500 <HI>Inoculated,</HI> by that time only 3 had died: Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> who made it his business, as being R. S. Sec. to be well informed, <HI>exeunte, A.</HI> 1722 says that only 182 were <HI>Inoculated</HI> by that time. This imposition on Mankind is too gross: what follows is still more gross. In a loose Poetical rapture Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> says, that supposing 200 or 300 Sick in the <HI>natural</HI> way, and as many in the <HI>Inoculated</HI> way, all under the cure of unskilful and unexperienced people, as few would <HI>Survive</HI> in the Natural way, as would <HI>Die</HI> by the Inoculated way.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003274_0012_0FF0301CD6C5B258"/>Dr. <HI>Brady of Portsmouth.</HI> Not so much as one ever <HI>died</HI> of Inoculation rightly performed, it always is favourable. What wretched work (says Dr. <HI>Brady</HI>) the <HI>Gentleman</HI> (Dr. <HI>C. M.</HI>) who writes the Letter to Mr. <HI>Dummer</HI> from <HI>New-England</HI> makes of his accounts.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Harris</HI> says <HI>Inoculation</HI> is a certain reme∣dy against the <HI>confluent</HI> kind.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Colmans Observations in New-England.</HI> A <HI>Negro</HI> Slave in discourse told him, That <HI>Ino∣culation</HI> was practised in their <HI>Country,</HI> but of how long standing he could not tell; that <HI>God</HI> told it to poor <HI>Negroes</HI> to save their lives, for they had not knowledge and skill as we; when the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> gets into a few Families in a <HI>Town,</HI> The whole Town is inoculated in one week, &amp; are well the next, <HI>none die, no blains nor bails follow the Practice.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Boylston</HI>'s <HI>first account.</HI> There is no truth in the reports of peoples <HI>dying under Inoculation. Timonius</HI> well <HI>known to some in Boston, who also actually knew the truth of his matters of fact</HI>; this sort of Quackery is only fit for a Stage in a Country Market Town. In his second account, published, <HI>A.</HI> 1726. He complains much <HI>that he had heard but of few who have had the benefit of Inoculation in England.</HI> N. B. We are to under∣stand that business running low with him here, he went for <HI>London,</HI> and with the character of an experienced Inoculator, expected a profita∣ble encouragement there, but was entirely dis∣appointed, <HI>not having Inoculated one person there,</HI> so far as I can learn; <HI>Inoculation</HI> in <HI>London</HI> had not as yet got into the hands of Quacks. He
<PB N="8" REF="003274_0013_0FF0301FD5ADBE60"/>
tells us he had such <HI>Faith</HI> in the accounts that Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> gave him of Inoculation, that he could have ventured the first tryal upon him∣self; in a few lines following (forgetting him∣self) he tells us of his great <HI>fright</HI> (as he calls it) on account of his <HI>Sons Illness, not having any directions from</HI> Timonius <HI>and</HI> Pylarinus <HI>concern∣ing this Practice</HI>: these are his own words, by which he unthinkingly exposes his own <HI>Rash∣ness and Inadvertency.</HI></P>
<P>The best of Men have some <HI>Foible</HI>: that of Dr. <HI>Mathers</HI> was <HI>Credulity</HI>; it was upon his Authority that our <HI>New-England Inoculation</HI> was carried on. I shall mention a few Instances of this <HI>weakness</HI> from his own <HI>Letters</HI> concerning Inoculation published in <HI>London</HI>: in one Letter Dated <HI>March</HI> 1722 He tells the world, That <HI>A.</HI> 1721. in <HI>Boston,</HI> some <HI>Cats</HI> had a regular Small-Pox and died of it; that during the Small Pox, the Pigeons and Dunghill Fowls did not lay nor hatch, <HI>that he never knew Blistering miss of saving life in the Small-Pox, &amp;c.</HI> In his Letter communicated to the R. S. by Mr. <HI>Newman</HI> in favour of Inoculation he says, <HI>the Patient is more healthy after Inoculation, it is usefull to Women in Child-bed, it dries up tedious running Ulcers, makes the crazy consumptive people hearty, and rids people of their former maladies.</HI> Thus he makes a <HI>Panacea</HI> of it. To allow of such gross &amp; bold assertions without disproving of them, would be leading Mankind into a <HI>Snare.</HI></P>
<P>ALTHO' <HI>Levity</HI> &amp; <HI>Credulity</HI> brought people in∣to it at first, without waiting the effects of a reason∣able number of <HI>Experiments,</HI> most of the <HI>Anti-Inoculators</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="003274_0014_0FF030215D8626B8"/>
from repeated tryals do now acknow∣ledge, that <HI>Inoculation</HI> generally speaking is a more easy way of undergoing the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> Illness, then where the Infection is received by <HI>accidental contagion</HI>; but its Salutariness falls much short of the <HI>extravagant recommendations</HI> given of it by its <HI>Patrons</HI>; which were very unfair, because it ap∣pears at that time they knew but little of the <HI>Practice.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Method,</HI> to speak impartially, is a consi∣derable improvement in <HI>Physick</HI>; but we can not say that it <HI>Prevents a bad sort,</HI> as sure as a <HI>Pleuresy is cured by V. S, an Intermitting Fever by the Peru∣vian Bark, a chlorosis by Chalybeats, Venereal Ails by Mercury,</HI> &amp;c. In short, it is no infallible Me∣thod of <HI>alleviating</HI> the Distemper, but in many Instances has proved <HI>precarious. Some receive the Distemper not at all, some only Eruptive Fevers, others to so small a degree as to admit of doubt, others the worst sort, some have Dyed of it, Impost∣humetions and other Subsequent Ails rather more than in the natural way,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I shall endeavour to vouch all these particulars chiefly from Histories of the first <HI>Centenary</HI> In∣oculated in <HI>England,</HI> and in the very words of the Inoculators (some of them were too credu∣lous in their first recommendations of it, but they all seem to be very candid in their <HI>Histories of Fact</HI>) which I am ready to produce well vouch∣ed. To proceed further down would be too tedious and nothing to the <HI>advantage of the Me∣thod,</HI> because the proportion of those who <HI>Died</HI> in the subsequent Years, is greater than it was
<PB N="10" REF="003274_0015_0FF030256B751F40"/>
in the beginning: and to speak ingenuously, I kept a correspondence with respect to the bene∣fits of Inoculation in <HI>England</HI> from <HI>unquestionable Facts,</HI> only for the first two or three Years of its Practice there; but have since, by a sort of indolence been remiss, I know no more of it for those last Years, than any other Person may from the Publick Prints. I can but seldom have recourse to Mr. <HI>Boylstone</HI>'s Accounts, because of their being so jejune, lame, suspected, and only in the nature of a <HI>Quack Bill.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>SOME receive the Distemper not at all. Pylarinus</HI> says, Inoculation does not always take place. In Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI>'s first parcel it did not take place in two instances. Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI>'s 20<HI>th,</HI> 28<HI>th,</HI> 29<HI>th,</HI> 30<HI>th,</HI> 32<HI>d,</HI> 42<HI>d,</HI> &amp;c. it did not Infect. Mr. <HI>A—ds</HI> 4<HI>th,</HI> 10<HI>th,</HI> and 11<HI>th,</HI> did not take Effect. In short, from the ingeni∣ous Dr. <HI>Jurins</HI> account of Inoculation in <HI>Great Britain, A.</HI> 1721, 1722, and 1723, out of 477 by that time Inoculated, 29 <HI>had no Small Pox</HI>; which is 1 in 16.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>SOME have only Eruptive Fevers.</HI> Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI>'s 32<HI>d,</HI> Patient. Dr. <HI>H—n aet.</HI> 26, had only an Eruptive Fever, but no Small-Pox; Mr. <HI>A—d's</HI> Child <HI>aet.</HI> 17 months, his 4th patient, had only an Eruptive Fever, and a pretty sharp one during 36 hours. Mr. <HI>A—d's</HI> 11<HI>th</HI> Patient. My L. M— a Son to the D. of <HI>D—t.</HI> aged 11 years, had a gentle Eruptive Fever but no Small-Pox.</P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>OTHERS the worst sort. Pylarinus</HI> modest∣ly says, they are most frequently (not always) of the distinct sort; the eldest (<HI>aet.</HI> 18,) of the 4 Sons of a noble <HI>Greek,</HI> his first Patients, after a course of most violent and dangerous Symp∣toms <HI>narrowly escaped</HI> the 14th day. <HI>Timonius,</HI> who has been found in every thing partial in recommendation of Inoculation, says, that of about 50 who had the Inoculation about the same time, 4 came near the <HI>Confluent</HI> sort, in whom the Eruptions were too sudden, and Symptoms worse. To make some estimate of the <HI>Confluent and Bad sorts,</HI> I shall confine my self to the first <HI>Centenary</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and in the words of the Inoculators. Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI>'s 8th Patient, Mr. <HI>Sympsons</HI> Child dyed the 7th day from Inoculation with <HI>Purple Spots</HI> (the Brother some time before dy'd in the natural way the 4th of Illness full of purple and lived spots.) His 28 <HI>Patient aet.</HI> 5. the elder of two Brothers inoculated about the same time, the younger got thro' the Distemper with a great deal of ease; but the other fared quite otherways, and there appeared some signs of <HI>malignity,</HI> but without danger, he afterwards had a hard Swelling on his Shoulder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (a former Child of this Fami∣ly
<PB N="12" REF="003274_0017_0FF0302A72345350"/>
dyed of a very malignant sort of Small-Pox.) Mr. <HI>Maitlands</HI> 10th patient <HI>Joseph Heath aet</HI> 7. was very ill before the Eruption, had a great load of the <HI>continued kind,</HI> but at last recovered. His 25th Patient Mr. <HI>R—ds aet.</HI> 41, had a great many, some of the <HI>coherent sort,</HI> with pretty sharp invading Symptoms, in some time after he had two boils. His 31st Patient Mr. <HI>Spencer</HI> at 2 &amp; half Son to the E. of <HI>Sunderland</HI> had a mixed sort part <HI>confluent,</HI> he dyed the 11th day <HI>con∣vulsed,</HI> having had a violent <HI>Second Fever.</HI> His 42 Patient Mr. <HI>R—gs</HI> Second Child had a great many, got over the Small-Pox under the care of two <HI>Physicians,</HI> but in some short time after dies of a <HI>Pthisis.</HI> His 47th Patient a Child of my L. <HI>T—ds</HI> had a pretty many of the <HI>Coherent sort.</HI> Mr. <HI>A —ds</HI> 12th Patient My L. <HI>Barthursts</HI> Servant <HI>aet</HI> 19 the Eruption happened in the u∣sual time with a vast quantity of the <HI>confluent kind,</HI> dies the 13th day, having been under the care of Drs. <HI>Arburthnot</HI> and <HI>Mead.</HI> In <HI>June</HI> Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> Apothecary in <HI>Gosport,</HI> inoculated his 3 Children, one of them had <HI>very severe symptoms</HI> preceeding the Eruption, had a great many with 3 or 4 patches of the <HI>Fluxed kind.</HI> Thus we find in fair accounts <HI>that</HI> 9 <HI>in</HI> 100 <HI>have had bad kinds</HI>; some Inoculators except against Mr. <HI>Sympsons</HI> Child, because the seizure was early.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI> ingenuously writes, That both in the natural and ingrafted sort there are al∣most <HI>infinite degrees of the Small-Pox.</HI> In Mr. <HI>Boylston</HI>'s account with a good assurance he tells us, we had no resemblance of bad symptoms in any, where it was not evident that they were
<PB N="13" REF="003274_0018_0FF0302D04AC6558"/>
infected in the natural way before. In all his 247 Patients he met with but 5 or 6, and they had received the infection before; whereof 3 were <HI>Confluent</HI> and 3 <HI>handsome sprinkling</HI> as he terms it. How <HI>disingenuous</HI> is it to suppress the Histories of those who had the severe degrees of it; that there were more is certain. The Rd. Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> in his Book of Observations, <HI>p.</HI> 4. writes: that some 10 or 12 of this number (the first 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0) appeared to have taken the infection in the common way, and accordingly had a <HI>confluent kind or of a fulness</HI> of the distinct sort not known among the Inoculated in the <HI>Levant.</HI> Considering that the other 147 were all in the severest season, and many of them not so well provided for in the adjacent Country Towns, the proportion of <HI>bad kinds</HI> must increase; so in the lowest estimate <HI>there must have been</HI> 25 <HI>or</HI> 30 <HI>with bad sorts.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>SOME have died of it.</HI> I shall not descend to particulars, seeing the ingenious Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> R. S.

Small Pox <HI>mortality</HI> in this way, at times we find some mentioned in the <HI>London</HI> News-Pa∣pers; as for instance in the year 1725. <HI>March</HI> 16. dyed Mrs. <HI>Eyles,</HI> Niece of Sir <HI>John Eyles,</HI> Alderman of <HI>London,</HI> of the Small Pox con∣tracted by Inoculation; <HI>June</HI> 17th dyed of the Small Pox contracted by Inoculation, <HI>Arthur Hill</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> Eldest Son of <HI>Viscount Hillsborough; Au∣gust</HI> 12th dy'd of the Small Pox by Inoculati∣on — <HI>Hurst</HI> of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Boylston</HI> writes, that there were only 6 <HI>who died of or after Inoculation.</HI> The precise number of those who dy'd by Inoculation in <HI>Boston,</HI> I am afraid will never be known, because of the croud of the Sick and Dead while Ino∣culation prevailed most, the Inoculator and Re∣lations inviolably keep the secret; when it got into <HI>Country Towns</HI> it could not be concealed, and we find that <HI>out of</HI> 72 <HI>or</HI> 73 <HI>persons inoculated by Mr.</HI> Boylston <HI>in</HI> Roxbury, <HI>and the adjacent Country Towns,</HI> 5 <HI>to have died; this is about</HI> 1 <HI>in</HI> 14. N. B. Mr. <HI>White</HI> was brought from <HI>Roxbury</HI> to <HI>Boston.</HI> In all fair tryals no man of Probity and Candor does stiffle facts. Mrs. <HI>G—</HI> an ancient Gentlewoman who visited much the Small Pox decumbents of all sorts, whis∣pers that that there were many more. Some <HI>Porters</HI> who at that time were employed to carry the dead to their Graves, say, that it was whis∣pered in sundry houses where the dead were carried from, that <HI>the</HI> person had been Inocu∣lated. I could name some who are suspected, but having only hearsay and conjectural evi∣dence I forbear to affront the surviving Rela∣tions:

I my self am certain of one more who <HI>died after Inoculation</HI> as they express it, having with her Inoculator attended her in her Illness, this was—Housekeeper to Mr. <HI>G—bs</HI> Apo∣thecary inoculated by himself; soon after the <HI>variolous</HI> matter was applied to the Incisions, she began to complain, after two days began the <HI>Small Pox Fever,</HI> and in two days more began the Eruption very full, &amp; <HI>confluent</HI> in her face, the Incisions discharged very much, was never deliri∣ous; she died the 12th day of weakness or <HI>Inaniti∣on.</HI> Capt. <HI>Osborne</HI> in his account of the success of the Inoculations in <HI>N.

His words are, There were in all at least 280 persons inoculated that <HI>I knew of,</HI> and I suppose there might be 20 or 30 more, but of those I can give no certain account; it is to be supposed that he Sail'd for <HI>London,</HI> before Mrs. <HI>Serle</HI> in <HI>Roxbury</HI> died of her Inocu∣lation because he does not mention her, but after her Death severals were Inoculated; thus the number of the Inoculated must exceed 300, and 20 <HI>or</HI> 30 <HI>concealed from us,</HI> many of them without doubt in their <HI>silent Graves.</HI> Would it be <HI>candid</HI> in a strenuous Promoter of this Practice, suppo∣sing he had <HI>suffered much</HI> in his Small Pox illness, and thereafter a <HI>violent Inflammation</HI> in his Leg, when freely askt the Question, if he had received the Infection by <HI>application</HI> of variolous matter or by accidental contagion? <HI>to give no positive Answer.</HI> Would it be fair in another, after his Child had recovered of the Small Pox from In∣oculation,

supposing a Neighbour put the Question seriously, If your <HI>Daughter</HI> had Died, what would you have said? his return should be, If she had, <HI>No body should have known that she was Inoculated.</HI> Mr. <HI>Boylston</HI> in his first account says, I have made my experiments on great num∣bers than I judge proper to mention.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>INOCULATION sometimes leaves Im∣posthumations and other ails. Timonius</HI> says, two morbid Children <HI>aet.</HI> 3.

For an estimate of their proportion, as before, I confine my self to the first <HI>Centenary</HI> Inoculated in <HI>England.</HI> Dr. <HI>Nettleton</HI>'s 23d Patient Mr. <HI>Hansons</HI> Daugh∣ter <HI>aet.</HI> 9 Months, about a fortnight after she was well of the Small Pox, had a <HI>painful swelling</HI> in one of her Thighs and <HI>Inguinal glands,</HI> but went off without suppuration, there only remain∣ing a <HI>hardness</HI> above the Knee for some time. His 37 Patient Mr. <HI>Haighs</HI> Daughter <HI>aet.</HI> 6. had a subsequent small <HI>tumour</HI> on the Muscles of the <HI>Loins</HI> which ripened speedily, <HI>was opened</HI> and healed. His 38 Patient her Sister <HI>aet.</HI> 18, had such another in her Leg, something <HI>deeper,</HI> it gave her a great deal of Pain, and discharged a <HI>great quantity of matter.</HI> Dr. <HI>Brady</HI> of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> Inoculated his four Children the eldest Boy in

Sickening had a <HI>painful swelling</HI> in his Neck, af∣terwards a swelling in his Lip, and a scratched Pock in his Leg does <HI>imposthumate</HI> and is laid open. His eldest Daughter had a <HI>painful tumour</HI> in her Arm. Mr. <HI>Maitlands</HI> 25th Patient Mr. <HI>R—ds aet.</HI> 21 in some short time after had two <HI>Boils.</HI> His 40th Patient Sir D— <HI>O—ne</HI> had a subsequent <HI>Imposthume Axillae.</HI> His 41st and 42d Patients <HI>aet.</HI> 13 Months, &amp; 3 Years; in the first one of the Inoculated Arms, did <HI>Im∣posthumate</HI> and was laid open; the other soon after Dy'd of a <HI>Pthisis</HI> having had an <HI>Imposthume Axillae</HI> and two small <HI>Boils</HI> in other parts. Mr. <HI>A—ds</HI> 14th Patient my Lady <HI>Betty</HI> Daughter to my L. <HI>B—y</HI> as the Small Pox were a drying away, appeared a large white <HI>tumour</HI> under the <HI>deltoides,</HI> which being opened the <HI>humerus Bone was found discover'd,</HI> it was cured without any sensible exfoliation. Thus <HI>eleven in the Hundred had these subsequent ails</HI>: I do with all Candor and Sincerity declare that in many Hundreds of Patients I visited in the last Small Pox time, I had not above half a dozen with subsequent Imposthumations or Boils, and having upon this occasion enquired of most of the other Practitioners, I find the proportions were very small when compared with these.</P>
<P N="7">7. WE may considently pronounce, <HI>That those who have had a genuine Small-Pox by Inoculation, never can have the Small-Pox again in a natural way,</HI> both by reason and experience: but there are some who have had the usual Feverish symp∣toms, a discharge by their Incisions, with a few
<PB N="18" REF="003274_0023_0FF03039DEFCE838"/>
<HI>iwperfect Eruptions,</HI> that may be obnoxious to the Small-Pox. One of the 6 Hospital Chil∣dren inoculated in the Spring 1722. by order of the <HI>Princess of Wales,</HI> had the accidents from Inoculation, and after <HI>eleven weeks had a fa∣vourable Small-Pox.</HI> Mr. <HI>Degrave</HI> Surgeon in <HI>London,</HI> his Daughter was sent to a Nurse with some other persons to undergo Inoculation, at the usual time she had Feverish Symptoms, heats and flushings, and more Sickness than the other persons who had a fair distinct Pock; the In∣cisions discharged about three weeks, (<HI>Timonius</HI> assured us that if the Incisions swell and dis∣charge, they never after will have the Small Pox) she was purged once or twice, and dis∣charged from her confinement: <HI>after eleven weeks she had a favourable Small Pox.</HI> Dr. <HI>Clinch</HI> in his Historical Essay of the Small-Pox, asserts, that a Son of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> Surgeon at <HI>O∣sewestry</HI> in <HI>Shropshire</HI> inoculated by the Father, had the Small-Pox, as was judged, by Inocula∣tion; but some short time thereafter <HI>had it se∣verely in the</HI> natural way: In <HI>May</HI> 1725. the Reverend Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> (a noted undertaker of scrophulous Cases) inoculated a Person of distinc∣tion in <HI>Chelsea,</HI> who thereupon had a <HI>Rash-like Eruption</HI> and small Fever, afterwards was phy∣sicked and sent home as having had the Small Pox, but in a short time after <HI>had the Small-Pox favourable in the natural way.</HI> We have had likewise some instances in the publick News-pa∣per from <HI>England.</HI> Some of the Inoculators say, that this late subsequent Small-Pox was still the effect of a latent infection received by Inocu∣lation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003274_0024_0FF0303B6D7EBA80"/>IT is beyond all dispute, <HI>that some of the Ino∣culated, may have received the Infection before, and that the Small-Pox was from thence</HI>: but if an Inoculated Person dies, or has had a hard time of it, to impute it always to a former accidental contagion, is most partial and unrea∣sonable; more especially they seem to be secure in this <HI>Subterfuge,</HI> if the Eruptions happen sooner than the usual time. <HI>Timonius</HI> says the Eruption sometimes is too sudden and of the fluxy kind. <HI>Pylarinus</HI> says the Eruptions ge∣nerally appear the seventh day, there are some rare instances where it appeared the first day. The Learned Dr. <HI>Huxham</HI> of <HI>Plymouth</HI> writes, <HI>A.</HI> 1724, &amp; 1725 there was in the Town a sort of <HI>Anomalous Small-Pox,</HI> that appeared in <HI>less than</HI> 24 <HI>hours</HI> from the Seizure, and were always of the fluxed kind. Dr. <HI>Jurin</HI> gives a very singu∣lar instance of the Small Pox <HI>appearing in</HI> 2 <HI>or</HI> 3 <HI>days,</HI> in the forehead of a Nurse, squeezed by a Gentleman in his <HI>delirium</HI> against his na∣ked breast full of the coherent kind in the state of maturation; they observed the regular pe∣riods of the distinct kind, and did inflame so as to close up her Eyes by swelling, which after∣wards did soon subside by a blister to her neck: therefore a <HI>fortiori,</HI> where the variolous matter is applied immediately to the blood and circula∣ting juices as by Inoculation, why may not the Eruptions in some constitutions, be <HI>premature.</HI> According to the Inoculators themselves the Eruption may be so <HI>Serotine</HI> as eleven weeks, and why may it not sometimes be too <HI>precoce</HI> by some days.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="20" REF="003274_0025_0FF0303DC0FEA380"/>8. <HI>IF it is not used with circumspection in re∣gard to our Neighbours, it is of pernicious conse∣quence</HI> to populous and trading Towns by sprea∣ding Infection and damping their Trade; besides the <HI>premature</HI> deaths of those who do not expect it. As in some constitutions of years the infecti∣on is not so apt to spread as in others, <HI>to force the spreading of it</HI> by this Artificial method no man (excepting one who has less regard for the lives and good of mankind, than the ready Mo∣ney) will justifie. I am told that about 45 years ago the Small Pox got into several Fami∣lies in <HI>Boston,</HI> and soon went off without dis∣seminating it self. The <HI>Plague</HI> which is recko∣ned more infectious than the Small Pox was in <HI>London,</HI> from 1602, to 1632, every year there died a few of it, but it did not spread excepting in 1603 there dyed of it 30. 561, and in 1625 dyed 35. 417. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> in <HI>London</HI> some years is far more universal and malignant than in other years, for instance, from the <HI>Bills of Mortality, A.</HI> 1702 dyed of the Small Pox only 311, in the year 1706 dyed 1721, in the year 1719 dies 3229. Last Small Pox left <HI>N. England</HI> very abruptly, while the Promoters of Inoculation were endeavouring to force it into the Country Towns; but the <HI>Roxbury</HI> deaths bafled their recommendations. To force the spreading of infection by an <HI>unbounded Inocula∣tion</HI> is a hardship upon Mankind, to oblige them to quit their business with their habitations; means used to save my own life, ought not to endanger my Neighbours. Perhaps it is <HI>more infecting</HI> than in the common way, because af∣ter
<PB N="21" REF="003274_0026_0FF0303F5EF016F8"/>
the Small Pox confinement is over the Ino∣culated walk about, and carry with them a sort of <HI>ambulatory Infection,</HI> their Incisions continu∣ing to run a sort of <HI>variolous</HI> matter. In some measure to obviate this clamour, they at first gave out, that the infection from the Inoculated conveyed a better sort: but this point they soon gave up. Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI>'s 9th Patient Mrs. <HI>Batts</HI> Daughter at Temple near <HI>Hartford,</HI> gave the infection to 6 Servants in the House, all of them had them very bad and one dy'd, says Mr. <HI>Maitland,</HI> contrary to my expectation. In <HI>Boston</HI> Mrs. <HI>Esther Webb</HI> 13th Patient of Mr. <HI>Boylstons</HI> was Inoculated, narrowly escaped in the worst sort of confluent kind, the <HI>Salvo</HI> was that she had received it from her Inoculated Father and Mother, and if this be allowed, then it makes our surmise good.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>THE Communication of Constitutional Dis∣tempers, is a difficulty which will require some series of Years to obviate.</HI> This some may call a <HI>Chi∣merical</HI> or conjectural fear; but as all constitution Distempers have some <HI>Idea</HI> or <HI>Seminium</HI> in every drop of our juices, the <HI>acute Distemper</HI> according to its nature soon shows itself, the <HI>Chronical ails</HI> act slowly &amp; imperceptibly on our Bodies. A <HI>Scor∣butick</HI> taint may lay latent until some disposing cause happens, the <HI>Arthitick</HI> from its nature will not exert it self till old age, it is very uncertain in what stage of life an hereditary <HI>Venereal Pox</HI> may appear, the <HI>Nephritick, Strumous, Epileptick, Maniack,</HI> &amp;c some times intermit one gene∣ration and appear <HI>again</HI> in the next: thus any
<PB N="22" REF="003274_0027_0FF03042B3960E00"/>
subsequent Chronical ail may occasion inquietude in the minds of the Inoculated, and render them uncapable of the greatest happiness in this World, <HI>Mens sana in corpore sano.</HI></P>
<P>As fear, anxiety and despondency or dejec∣tion of Spirits are of bad consequence in all Diseases, and more especially in the Small Pox illness; I cannot avoid taking notice of the In∣advertency or <HI>Inhumanity</HI> of some Inoculation Promoters particularly in this Town, who with <HI>false colourings</HI> expose the Mortality of the Small Pox in the natural way. They harangue thus, <HI>The Small Pox always fatal to</HI> New-England. Mr. <HI>Boylstone</HI> in his first account says, The Small Pox was an <HI>awful</HI> Distemper, whereof so many died as gave an awful Prospect. In his <HI>assuming Dedication</HI> to the <HI>Princes of Wales,</HI> he says the reason of his undertaking Inoculation was, because the Small Pox raged in <HI>New-England</HI> with the utmost Violence: let us recollect and we may find that 22d <HI>July</HI> 1721 the <HI>Select-Men</HI> declare that only 17 by that time had died of it, the Small Pox had then been in Town about three Months, and this was near a Month after Inoculation began, at that time so far as we could investigate about 1 in 10 died of it; how few Popular Fevers have been so favourable, witness that <HI>Febris mali moris</HI> Epidemical here in the Fall. Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> in his Letters publish∣ed in <HI>London,</HI> gives the reason why they used no precaution: because in the natural way it raged with the <HI>utmost fury,</HI> and to make his assertion good, says that of something more than 5000,
<PB N="23" REF="003274_0028_0FF03046167E9350"/>
decumbents near 900 died, which is 1 in 5. 5 or 18 <HI>per ct.</HI> by the fallacy of useing the remotest round numbers in each estimate, he <HI>misrepresents</HI> the case very much: the true numbers, as I had them from Mr. <HI>Salter</HI> were out of 5989, died 844 (or in the nearest round numbers <HI>out of</HI> 6000, <HI>dy'd</HI> 850,) which is Something less than 1 in 7 or 14 <HI>per ct.</HI> Mr. <HI>Boylstone</HI> with his usual candor, in his estimates makes use of round numbers to a pitch much exceeding this; In his account reckoning up the <HI>dismall Symptoms</HI> which attend the natural Small Pox, he endeavours to make the world believe, <HI>That in Boston, A.</HI> 1721. <HI>near one hun∣dred persons had lost one Eye,</HI> I have made dili∣gent enquiry among the Practioners and others, but cannot muster up near a score; and some of those not from the violence of the Distemper, as in two Daughters of Capt. <HI>R—</HI> Patients to Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> who had a kind distinct sort, with an accidental Small Pox <HI>Pustule upon the Pupil of the Eye.</HI> How <HI>inhumane</HI> is it in affairs of life and death thus to trifle with Mankind, to indulge a humour, or to serve a base end, and <HI>how suspected must all accounts be that come from such hands.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>chearfulness of mind</HI> is the best <HI>preparative</HI> for, and <HI>restorative</HI> in the Small Pox; for the comfort of those who have not had the Small Pox, I shall make an estimate of the <HI>net Small Pox deaths</HI> in <HI>Boston, A.</HI> 1721. There died that year of all distempers 1102. whereof 844 were Small Pox, is only 258 of other diseases; but at a <HI>medium</HI> of 6 years preceeding, <HI>A.</HI> 1721.
<PB N="24" REF="003274_0029_0FF030485CCE5808"/>
there dyed <HI>per. an.</HI> 359, and at a <HI>medium</HI> of 6 years following, <HI>A.</HI> 1722. (I do not include <HI>A.</HI> 1722. because the <HI>premature deaths</HI> of 1721. had much lessened the burials for that year) there dyed 411: the mean is 385. from which deduct the above 258, remains 127 deaths of <HI>Valetudina∣rians</HI> who (if we may so express it) must have dyed that year of other ails: or if we compute thus <HI>A.</HI> 1722. dyed only 273, therefore the former year had <HI>anticipated</HI> this 118 of its due Burials; the <HI>medium</HI> of both computations is 122, which deducted from 5989 and from 844 leaves 722 deaths in 5867 is something more than 1 in 8. To reduce the Small Pox <HI>morta∣lity</HI> further let us consider, 1. The disadvantage of its <HI>prevailing in the Autumn</HI> or Fall, the most Sickly time of the year. 2. The Small Pox had been absent 20 years, and consequently a great proportion of <HI>Adults</HI> to have it, in whom <HI>Chronical ails</HI> might be formed; where it fre∣quently comes, <HI>Children</HI> are generally its sub∣jects, and on that account not so mortal. 3. By <HI>Inoculation</HI> the numbers of the infected were in all parts of the Town so increased, that they could <HI>not be well attended</HI>; perhaps the numbers rendred the <HI>contagion more intense</HI> for near 90 dyed of <HI>Purple Spots and other cruen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous colliquations</HI> Had not those disadvantages con∣curred, I do almost perswade my self, not above 1 <HI>in</HI> 10 <HI>would have dyed</HI>; the two former Small Pox times were <HI>more favourable, A.</HI> 1690 and 1702 as Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> in his Book observes: and considering that from the Settling of <HI>Boston</HI> which is now 100 years, the Small Pox hath

afflicted the Town only six times; <HI>A.</HI> 1649, 1666, 1678, 1690, 1702, &amp; 1721. I cannot see any reason to magnifie the chance, and risque which a <HI>Boston</HI> man has of dying by the Small Pox. Dr. <HI>Nettleton of Hallifax,</HI> Dr. <HI>Whitaker of Chichester, and Dr. Williams of Heverford-west.</HI> For the year 1721. make the Small Pox deaths in their Neighbourhood 1 in 5, it certainly must have been with them <HI>a malignant constitution</HI> that year. Accidental Years or Times are not to be induced in forming <HI>general estimates</HI>; as for instance, <HI>A.</HI> 1721. In <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> (a Neighbouring Plantation) out of 30 who had the Small Pox and were sent to <HI>Harbour-Island,</HI> only one person dy'd, without any other ad∣vice than the care of a Nurse.</P>
<P><HI>THE advantages of Inoculation.</HI> 1 The Small Pox received by <HI>Incisions</HI> from the experience of Some years, <HI>abstractedly</HI> considered, is found not so Mortal and the Symtoms generally more fa∣vourable than when it is received by accidental contagition. 2 One may take the advantage of <HI>benign</HI> Small-Pox constitution, and <HI>a favourable Season</HI> of the year to receive it. 3 The Body may be <HI>prepared</HI> and so secure our selves from being taken at a disadvantage and surprise, it is an advantage to know that we are to have a distem∣per 7 or 8 days before it seizes us. 4. It removes that dread and anxiety which is a great uneasi∣ness to some who have not had the Small-Pox.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Royal Family</HI> by their Example, have ob∣viated the Suspicion, which made the Practitioners

here decline it formerly, I mean of its being Cri∣minal. I find <HI>the Practitioners in Town do generally resolve to perform the Opperation when required,</HI> but without perswading or diswading; so that those who are so inclined will have a better chance and choice without being oblidged to expose themselves to a <HI>Rash Operator</HI>; however safe this method may be, discretion and care are ne∣cessary, out of Mr. <HI>Boylstons</HI> 72 or 73 <HI>Roxbury Inoculated Patients</HI> (Mr. <HI>White</HI> included) <HI>dyed</HI> 5: <HI>out of Mr. Thompsons</HI> 28 <HI>Inoculations in the same Towns and season there dyed not one.</HI></P>
<P>THE Operation of Inoculation is always safe even in the rudest hand; Blood letting is attended with the risque of pricking an Artery, tendon or membrane of the muscle; in this the Skin being elevated nothing lays in the way. The Symptoms in the Inoculated Small-Pox are the same as in the natural, and require the same management.</P>
<P>ALTHO' by Inoculation there is a <HI>better chance</HI> than by accidental contagion, nevertheless it is not exempted from being <HI>precarious,</HI> as we have at length exemplified; but as there is no <HI>abso∣lute certainty</HI> in humane affairs, mankind go∣vern themselves by the greatest <HI>probabilities.</HI> If it is found a better chance for preserving Life in this Illness, it will not be easy for <HI>En∣thusiasts</HI> and such like <HI>divines</HI> to make the world believe it a Sin; thus some <HI>Turks</HI> and many of our Neighbours, altho' rigorous <HI>predestinari∣ans,</HI> at the cry of Small Pox <HI>malignity,</HI> do fly to it as a refuge. Suppose an Epidemical and

mortal <HI>Diarrhaea</HI> or <HI>Dysentery</HI> rage in a place, if I can carry off its proper <HI>Pabulum</HI> by <HI>Catharticks,</HI> which is an Analagous artificial Distemper of the same Species, may it not be done? an im∣pending periodical <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> may it not be diverted by an Artificial V. S. The <HI>adequate Analogy</HI> of this, puts me in mind of the <HI>fallacy</HI> of an argument commonly used by the Inocu∣lators, <HI>Artificial</HI> V. S. <HI>Catharticks, drawing of Teeth, cutting of Corns, &amp;c. have been the occasions of deaths, must they be disused</HI>? In these some accident in the Operation is to blame, not na∣ture prematurely set at work to acquire an acute distemper by a safe Operation; A preventive Vo∣mit, Purge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> affects only my self not my Neigh∣bour.</P>
<P>Seeing at present the most zealous Inoculator does not pretend that there is any <HI>absolute cer∣tainty</HI> in this affair, a <HI>Country retreat</HI> in my Judgement, may be advisable to the following <HI>conditions</HI> of persons. 1. To those who are <HI>much advanced in years,</HI> who in the common course of nature may <HI>not survive</HI> the next return of this contagion; the <HI>infirmities</HI> of old age is a disadvantage likewise to be considered. 2. <HI>Preg∣nant women</HI>; and in general all of the <HI>Fair Sex</HI> whose buisiness can allow of a Country retire∣ment for some months once in 12 or 20 years, and whose <HI>faces</HI> are some part of their care and concern, some faces having suffered last Inocu∣lation time. 3. The consumptive and <HI>bad ha∣bits,</HI> whose <HI>crazy fabricks</HI> cannot without a con∣siderable risque, stand the shock of an acute distemper. 4. <HI>Infants,</HI> whose green and tender

age with the incidents of <HI>crudities, Tormina</HI>'s, <HI>Teething, &amp;c.</HI> is of it self precarious, without the accumulation of a Small Pox illness. 5. <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> few of them are observed to survive the Small-Pox in the natural way, &amp; therefore are not without considerable hazard in the other way. 6. <HI>Some particular Families of Whites,</HI> who have something peculiar in their constitution that can∣not bear this infection (fire is not always as the flame from whence it is derived, but as the fewel to which it is applied) we have had in∣stances of this, Mr. <HI>White</HI> and his Sister both di∣ed by Inoculation, the Family of <HI>W—bs</HI> suffered much, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By some singularity of temperament, some are proof against the Pocky contagion, to others it is always mortal. 7. <HI>The exceedingly Timorous</HI> need not to be mentioned, it is to be supposed that fear will give them Wings.</P>
<P>THESE who are in <HI>good Health,</HI> and not in any of these circumstances, are <HI>fit subjects for Inocu∣lation,</HI> more especially whose business requires them to be in foreign parts where the Small Pox always more or less prevails. Since the practice is not Criminal, they who from a publick Spi∣rit undergo the experiment, may be reckoned to essay the <HI>benefit of Mankind</HI> for generations to come.</P>
<P><HI>The best preparation for the Small Pox to</HI> be received either by accident or by incisions is to keep the mind as chearful, &amp; the body as health∣ful as we can. <HI>The symptoms of health</HI> are a good Stomach, easie digestion, regular pulse, quiet and undisturbed Sleep.</P>
