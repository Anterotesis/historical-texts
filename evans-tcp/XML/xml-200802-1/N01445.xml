<HEAD>To the Reverend Mr. <HI>Peter Thacher,</HI> Pastor of the Church of <HI>Milton.</HI></HEAD>
<L>WHat Method shall I take, O Reverend SIRE,</L>
<L>To praise YOUR Merit?</L>
<L>My fainting Muse want's Pow'r to strike her Lyre.</L>
<L>Were but my Muse as Great as You are Good,</L>
<L>My Verses shou'd not march the common Road,</L>
<L>But tow'r aloft;</L>
<L>In highest Harmony shou'd speak your FAME,</L>
<L>And mounting rise like Pyramids of Flame;</L>
<L>So high!</L>
<L>That Nothing but the fam'd <HI>Maeonian</HI> Flight</L>
<L>Th' immortal <HI>Iliads</HI> shou'd reach their Height:</L>
<L>I'd make them in harmonious Numbers move,</L>
<L>And lead them on with Reverence and Love;</L>
<L>My ravisht Soul shou'd breathe pathetic Lays,</L>
<L>Lofty as Those</L>
<L>Which <HI>Virgil</HI> sung to great <HI>Augustus'</HI> Praise</L>

<L>And cannot reach such high heroic strains:</L>
<L><HI>My Muse</HI> scarce fledg'd, yet spreads her callow Wings,</L>
<L>And comes abroad and as She can She Sings.</L>
<L>Since then her Will is good, You cann't <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>T' accept the Presents of an humble Muse.</L>
<L>But humble as She is, She'd fain aspire</L>
<L>"To write good Sense, with true <HI>Britannic</HI> Fire.</L>
<L>And now.</L>
<L>Tho' BICKERSTAFF do's Imitators hate,</L>
<L>I hope these Lines won't make me share their Fate,</L>
<L>Since 'tis <HI>Great Him alone</HI> I imitate.</L>
<L>HE praises Merit only where it's due,</L>
<L>And I don't deviate in praising you.</L>
<L>But let me tell you,</L>
<L><HI>That</HI> 'tis not Gratitude that moves my Pen,</L>
<L>(I owe you nothing more than other Men)</L>
<L>Nor is it foolish OSTENTATION,</L>
<L>But 'tis your <HI>Merit,</HI> Sir, that urges on</L>
<L>My willing Pen:</L>
<L>Therefore believe me now, cou'd I but find</L>
<L>One <HI>more deserving,</HI></L>
<L>Of all the Sacred Tribe that's left behind,</L>
<L>,Mongst the remaining, meritorious Few,</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>He</HI> alone shou'd have my Praise, not <HI>You.</HI></L>

<L>Due Reverence to <HI>Christ's Ambassadour.</HI></L>
<L>Therefore all-hail! Hail venerable Sage,</L>

<L>Go on my Muse.</L>
<L>I wou'd, but I despair, and cannot paint</L>

<L>I'm forced to make use of Stratagem,</L>
<L><HI>Who,</HI> at the Painting of a Funeral,</L>
<L>Its sable, melancholy Weeds and all</L>
<L>Its black Array,</L>
<L>With exquisite and Artful Strokes</L>
<L>Pourtray'd each <HI>fashionable Mourner's</HI> Looks;</L>
<L>Their sad Grimace and counterfeited Grief,</L>
<L>O wing to kind Magnetic Handkerchief:</L>
<L>But when the Painter came to represent</L>
<L>The Face of <HI>real Grief,</HI></L>
<L>Each Feature bid Defiance to his Paint.</L>
<L>He stopt,—</L>
<L>And fearing in the great Attempt to fail,</L>
<L>O'er the afflicted Father drew a Vail:</L>

<P>I Adventure Danger, when about the <HI>Ides</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> I will <HI>Endymion</HI>-like go gaze the Moon, or in her Silence hear the Language of the Stars; for I am fixt as if <HI>Medusa'd</HI> to a Statue; my Soul do's <HI>lascivire inter stellas,</HI> and forgets it is espoused to Flesh and Bloud; Injurable by Frost-biting, chusing (it seems) rather to be Un∣bodied, than Unheavened; it leans so far without my Win∣dow, that an other Blast will puff it out, and freeze up the Casements; I stand here as if <HI>Nero</HI> had befriended me, and sent me my Choice of Death, and I wou'd need's die in this Vein; Oh! the Nectar of Contemplation, the Return of it is superlatively gainful, and wins a man to make a Voyage in the greatest Difficulties: Tho' a <HI>Fryer,</HI> yet it's Truth when he tells you, that <HI>in Contemplatione Mens illuminatur, Cor Amore inflammatur, Mundus contemnitur, &amp;c.</HI> and, from the <HI>Coryphaeus</HI> of Philosophers in his Ethics, look's upon Contemplation as the Queen Regent of all sublunary Bliss, and Inthrones her in a triumphant Chariot. Doubtless the Thoughts that are whistled this way are very well flown; they are as so many Bees that come home <HI>Crura Thymo plena,</HI> laden with Meditati∣on. When I view the whirling Heavens, and revolve their Motions, when I observe those called <HI>Errantes Stellae</HI> not fail to accomplish a certain Course, to keep such Exactness in their Irregularities, that a <HI>Prognosticator</HI> will give you a Prediction of the most shadowed <HI>Eclipses,</HI> in the clearest Sun-shine; when

I see the nimble Spheres dancing their unerring Rounds, I rea∣dily assent to their Harmony, so much disputed. While mine Eye is terminated with the Firmament, I admire without a Limit; when I see <HI>Born Azure Fretted,</HI> or cold <HI>Arctophylax, Volant Pegasus a Croissant,</HI> and the other, <HI>Asteris<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> and the POLES, as a <HI>Bend-sinister,</HI> and when deflecting mine Eye I behold a <HI>Field Vert,</HI> charged with such Variety of Blossoms, so many <HI>Rampant</HI> and <HI>Couchant,</HI> and my self a poor Creature <HI>Passant,</HI> and yet in <HI>Chief</HI> to the Rest, ere now I have won∣dered to Extasie, and conclude my Tongue was made for no∣thing more, than to dwell on the Praises of that Glory and Excellency that owns this <HI>Coat-Armour.</HI> When I behold the Radiant Sun, and find him roll in the <HI>Zodiac</HI> as in a Wheel, when I note how he forms his Course in the <HI>Ecliptic,</HI> how well he knows his regress having toucht either <HI>Tropic,</HI> I assure <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e there is a Hand which is STRENGTH' <HI>in Abstracto,</HI> that wields this useful Instrument, and also as much that trims this Lamp unto the World. When I consider too the Circuit of the Earth, more than twenty three thousand Miles, yet of no Moment in Respect of the Heavens, this constrains me to ac∣knowledge the Great Immensity of the <HI>Aetherial Orbs</HI>; if I shou'd doubtfully query their Vastness, I shou'd cloud the Sun again, and inscribe my Understanding with a Beam; for when without Mathematical Assistance, I can see it much bigger than the Earth, nay, when I have more than probable Conjectures from its <HI>Parallax,</HI> and the Earth's Pyramidal Shadow, that it exceeds it in Magnitude many hundreds of times, that <HI>Sol A∣pogens</HI> is distant from us, or rather that the Planet Earth in its <HI>Aphelion</HI> is distant from the Sun, more than twenty two thou∣sand Semi-diameters of the Terrestrial Globe, yet no higher, nay scarce so high as the Midst of the Planets, and when I see what small Proportion even this <HI>Great Orbit</HI> bear's to the ex∣panded Skies, I am lost in the Wideness of the Eighth Sphere; and will say, certainly if a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eature wou'd fill our capacious Spirit I had found it.

Piece would drive me to a Metaphysical Search; the Pow∣er▪ and Glory evident in <HI>that,</HI> would lead me to <HI>this,</HI> and for ever and ever might well serve me to proclaim an Atheist the most admired Fool <HI>in Rerum Natura,</HI> to be one that denies the Light, who upon first Assent to his Irrational Thoughts, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> runs himself into a <HI>Premunire,</HI> forfeits all his Senses, and deserves to suffer a Confiscation of all enjoyed Good, without a two Months Liberty to Recant.—I'll esteem him a <HI>Furioso,</HI> that do's not <HI>lucidis gaudero Intervallis</HI>; his Heart is the only empty Cask in Nature, for take what you will besides, and say with the Poet, <HI>Jovis omnia plena.</HI> Sometimes I conceive the World a Building, the Earth a Floor, palliated with a green Carpet-Covering, the Heavens a Roof, bespangled with exqui∣site Ornaments, and revere the Wisdom of a Mighty Architect. When I see such Magnificence <HI>in Vestibulo,</HI> in the Vault, <HI>in communi Atri<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> surely the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI> is beyond Descrip∣tion. We live here in the very Bottom of Nature, and think full little <HI>Who</HI> and <HI>What</HI> are on the Top of the Context. Oh! methinks I have something of it <HI>in Intellectu,</HI> by fleeting Glan∣ces, that never was <HI>in Sensu.</HI> Sometimes I call the World a Table spread, and observe Satisfaction for every Sense, dished out in proper Objects; What Orient Colours are brought in to please the Eye, to delight the Ear, what Melody is enclosed in the Breasts of Birds, so well instructed in Song, that every Grove becomes a Quire? What silken Softness have we for the Touch, what Cates and Tastful Viands for the daintiest Palate; what Odoriferous Scents, what perfumed Airs do we meet with to feast our other Sense? What Abundance of Sweetness is bound up in the small Volume of a Flower? I read no less than a Deity in the few Folio's of a Damask Rose; and hence I conclude that Nature hath not left my Soul Objectless, but that there is <HI>somewhere</HI> a Truth for my Understanding, and Goodness for my Will. Again, my Heart is elated above the ordinary Level of Admiration, when I perceive this Sublunary World, top full of Things, as contrary as Fire and Water,

Earth and Air, yet to subsist by one another, nay, which is more, when I see them made In-mates in one Mansion, and how peaceably they co-habit in the same Subject, <HI>in Gradu re∣misso,</HI> I cannot but attribute their Accord to a Soverain Arm and Guidance. When on a Promontory I fix my Foot on firm Earth, while mine Eyes launch out into the Main, and see the Billows come wallowing one in on the Neck of another, as if they mutually encourag'd themselves to an Universal Deluge; yet when they some and make a Noise as unkennelled, I may soon observe them at the End of their Chain. While the <HI>O∣cean</HI> swells it self into <HI>Alps</HI> of Water, and the Brow of it is so furrow'd with Rage, that every Wave threatens to write me among the Dead, suddenly all is cut off with a Dash. When I behold this diffusive Element stand upon an Heap, sure there is some <HI>hitherto</HI> and <HI>no further</HI> that it hears in its loudest Roar∣ings, and that is Gates and Bars to it. When I look on the Reciprocation of the Waters, I feel a Spring of Thoughts at the highest Flow within me, and go beyond the Moon to find a Cause. Sometimes I look upon the Use of a Sea, and con∣ceive great Mercy and Wisdom in placing of it; those heaven∣ly Buckets that pour out refreshing Showers on the parched Soil are dipt in this Cistern, and it is as the Liver to the Bo∣dy, fills the Earth with irriguous Veins. Again, when I see the Earth once every Day muffle it self in its own Shadow, and that the Dark may not be irksome to us, our busie Eyes are as often closed by a Law of Rest, which upon pain of Death, we may not long infringe with a watchful Disobedience, for, <HI>quod caret alterna Requie durabile non est.</HI> Now while we sleep the Night steed's us for a Curtain, the half of the Term of our Life runs out in a sleepy Vacation of Senses, and is most plea∣surable, tho' least lightsom; in this I adore a Supreme Wisdom. The withering Grass likewise is no less beholden to the Night, than our heavie Heads, for now the heavenly Limbecs do di∣still their rared Influence; and that there may be a Growth in Vegetables, a nightly Moisture mingles it self with the Heats

by Day. But while I stand admiring thus, here is one within tells me I need not go fish for Wonders in the Deep, or climb the Height of Heaven for Heaven, for my self am one.—In∣deed when I reflect on the Structure of my Body, I see it is not ordinary; my Stature is Erect when other Creatures gro∣vle. I have a Privilege of looking up, when other Creatures stand Mottoed with a <HI>pro-naque com spectant.</HI> Is there a more exact Work than our Head, here all the Senses keep their Ren∣dezvous, lie Ledger to give Intelligence: If an Object that carries any Colour with it comes, the Eye note's it immedi∣ately, if it make a Noise the Ear catcheth it, and so of the Rest. But when I remember (that) whereby I work all this and more, I am arrived at an Height of Admiration; If you demand me of it, I will say it is some strange Divine Thing, but what I know not; 'tis called a Soul, a most active Being I'm sure it is: It is ever grinding, if you rake it up in the Ash∣es of a Sleep, it will glow in a Dream. It is fixt in a <HI>Micro∣cosm,</HI> but yet not to be contained by the immense <HI>Macrocosm</HI>; it is plac'd in the Orb of a minute Body, but raises it self fur∣ther than the Sun, will pierce the most solid Substance, rest not in a few Objects, tho' a single one may sometimes like a Glass collect its Beams into a Flame—Oh! the Soul that can drag the past and future Time to the Bar of present Consideration, that will in my most retiredness discourse to me of various Matters; this Cosmographical Spirit, that can shew me the Heavens and the Earth as in Land-skip in the darkest Room, oh! the Swiftness of its Motion, 'twill beat against East and West like a Bean in a Bladder, with less Noise and more Nim∣bleness; Lightning to it is Leaden-heeled, and the Wink of an Eye the Consumer of too much Time to stand in Compare. Sometimes I look on my Sway in the World, and observe all the visible Creation bow down to me, the Sun, Moon &amp; Stars wait upon me, but, what shall all this fill my Life with Pride as my Mind with Marvail? No. If I see nothing greater than my self to arrogate my Service, yet I cannot deem me abso∣lute,

or that I am mine own Man, for my Hands and Shoul∣ders, and other Parts are a Lecture to me for the Labour of my Body; my Station here mind's me I must be busied in Contemplation; for I look on the Earth as a green Bank, re∣covered from the Waters for me to stand unmovedly, while I behold the tossing Seas, and turning Spheres, and all Things else in Agitation; now to be thus tasked, denotes my Conditi∣on to be that of a Servant. I further know my Subjection by mine Ignorance,—that Being I have, when I received it, I was meerly patient, how I was brought hither, I have it not in mine own Knowledge; if those about me had conspi∣red, it had been more easy to have made me believe the E∣ternity of my self, <HI>a parte ante,</HI> than the <HI>Atheist a parte post.</HI> That I had a Beginning is delivered me by Tradition, confirm∣ed by the Motions of Accretion and Diminution in my self and others; for I was lighted I know not how, or when. Again, in the Administration of Things, their Order is not from any Law of mine,—and I might well be called <HI>Aesop's</HI> foolish Fly, should I think my self able, to make the very Dust that made me. Now while I ruminate these and a thousand more, as I pass by in the World, I look for some∣thing greater than it: It seems to me unreasonable, that a Work so absolute and uniform should want <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Efficient, that I should with the <HI>Peripatetics</HI> suppose it to be Eternal, seeing it is an ENS <HI>ex Participatione,</HI> or with <HI>Empedocles</HI> sit shuffling in a dusty Cell 'till I have a World out of Atoms. No, but I'll resolutely say, such Wise Position, and Administration of Things was never casual. But I search and wonder, and trem∣ble, for I find my self not far from an Immense Being, that I thus grope after, and say if a Light were brought into the Room, I should find my self in the Everlasting Arms of a Fa∣ther or an Enemy. These Things I read by the <HI>Hieroglyphica</HI> of the Creatures, in the A, B, C of Nature, without the Help of the <HI>WORD</HI>: for as to the Book of <HI>WORKS,</HI> I will call it, compar'd with that of the <HI>WORD,</HI> of later Edition, of more

When I have weighed the Premises, I am troubled, that I have so truanted formerly, and cannot now but resolve to quit my self with more Diligence in this Spiritual Literature; here a Man may be <HI>Librorum Helluo,</HI> without Offence. I trust now, when I have mentioned Cha∣racters of Sun, Moon, Heaven and Earth, and the other Crea∣tures, I shall be able to put them together, and make them spell Infinite Wisdom, and Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From the Earth I learn to contemplate, from the Heav'ns I learn to add Motion and Practice to my Speculat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.

When I see the Largeness and Capacity of my Soul, I will learn be∣times to decline the small and narrow Creature, and search an Object able to better it, able to fill it. And that I may be more skilled in God's Sacred Oracles, I shall desire to medi∣tate in it Day and Night, to use it on all Occasions as a

To have Wife and many Children, is but to extend a Man's Body to larger Dimensions, and to expose it to more Inevita∣ble Aim. The greatest Master is (no question) the veriest Servant to Employment, and the richest Man finds the most Care and Work, to keep and dispense <HI>that</HI> that gives him <HI>that</HI> Denomination. Hath a Man a Plurality of pleasing Accom∣modations, they are but as so many Places made bare, where he is sensible of the least Lash of Fortune; he is an Instru∣ment of many Strings, one or other always fails or is out of Time, which spoil's his <HI>Symphony</HI>; these are all to him as su∣perfluous Members, which are a Burthen, have Sense and so fit to suffer in, but want Motion to stand a man in Stead; the Use and Imployment of them is nothing else but a vain Expence of vital Spirits, when a Condition of Want preserve's them <HI>per Antiperistasin,</HI> and commonly number's more Years: The high∣est Places are most obnozious to Variation, the Sun never so near a Declension as in the <HI>vertical Meridian.</HI> May I not say many, nay most that have sceptered in the World, have been rapt out of it violently, as if they perished by Fascination, from the many malevolent Eyes that dart upon them—.<HI>Julius Caesar</HI> that he may be wofully miserable, his Chair of State shall be his Death-Bed, where he feels no sewer than twenty three Wounds, and sees <HI>Brutus,</HI> even <HI>Brutus' self</HI> among the Conspira∣tors; <HI>Crassus</HI> for all his Bags shall be slain, and so shall valiant <HI>Pompey,</HI> sirnamed the Great, who though he got an old Shirt for a Winding-Sheet, yet he cou'd not be supplied with Fune∣ral Fire enough to consume his Body: Lamentable was the End of <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> and many other Emperours and no∣ble Personages among the <HI>Romans.</HI> In the <HI>Carlovignian</HI> Race of <HI>France,</HI> when <HI>Charlemain</HI> their first western Emperour was once gone, we may behold many tragical <HI>Catastrophe's</HI> after glorious Scenes; <HI>Lewis</HI> the Gentle afflicted with three Rebel Sons grieves to death, <HI>Charles</HI> the Gross without Love and Honour, yea House and Bread at his End.

When I have sometimes given a right Sentence, a new Relation, or some other Event hath stept in and violently blind-folded me again: When I have beheld a Worldling as full of Earth as a Worm, one that load's himself with thick Clay, that walk's in the Sun-shine daily, and never enquires who hath lighted him that glorious Candle, that goes rooting as if he were a Mole in humane Shape, and <HI>Canibal</HI>-like devours poor Men's Flesh; when I had clearly seen and confidently affirmed his Gold to be Dross, and himself beautified with all his Pomp to be but a Jade in Trap∣pings, when I had made use of him as an Occasion of admi∣ring divine Providence, for sparing such a monstrous Hog, yea! when I had out-lawed him as one altogether unworthy of Protection; yet, how hath the Tender of some few Cour∣tesies, or other Things been ready to make me reverse it, hath not only stopped my Mouth, but muddied my sounder Judg∣ment of him, and have been almost disposed to an Entertain∣ment of his (before detested) Principles, and a Prosecution of Prosperity; and the Notion of a Possibility of arriving at his Height, hath been such a Powder-Mine, that I have been well nigh blown up; my Affections have been like a Navy in a Storm at Sea, hardly kept together: I say therefore as before, that the best Perspective to see the World in its genuin and proper State is a great Distance from it. A man must play the cunning Astronomer, who when he would gaze a Star, gets not on the Top of a Pyramid, but descende some deep Pit, for so the visual Spirits are kept together. Earthly Things are a very Mist, before a Man comes at it he may see the Di∣mensions of the Fog, may perhaps look over it, but when once invelopt and clouded within it, his sight is limited to a small Extent; surely Temporals bear about them those <HI>Pastilli</HI> of <HI>Pliny</HI> confected of the <HI>Chameteon's</HI> left Foot, which make those

When I have sometimes made the <HI>German</HI> Evil the Object of my Consideration, think∣ing of it abstractedly; my Heart hath suddenly swell'd at it with indignation, I could no Doubt have put down twenty <HI>Periprases</HI> of it, containing so many Arguments against it; and have admired his strange Madness, who (when Man naturally doth with impatient Eagerness search after an Increase of Knowledge, for the Repair of his Soul, and aim's at the Pre∣servation of Health, as a main Good of the Body) <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>ex Industri<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> cast Lime in his own Eyes, and seek to quench the only Lamp that illuminates him: Oh! strange Philosophy, that to judge physically of a Beast, a Man should lay aside the soverain Life of Reason to descend to that of Sense only! And when I had pronounced (as well I may) that such a One is not the Physician but the Fool, that will avoid the best Me∣dicin (or rather the Preventive of Medicin) Temperance I mean, to imbrace and fofter Drunkenness, the Spawn of many noisom Maladies. In these Thoughts I say, and when I have been confirming in me (as I shall for ever) a Detestation of that beastly Vice, it hath approached me in him whose Parts I have admired, or whose Person I have loved, and hath suffici∣ently evidenced it self by a gross <HI>Traulismus,</HI> (for when in his Fit he hath been a plain <HI>Titubo,</HI> and his Tongue hath pronoun∣ced <HI>Titititubo</HI>) but ah! then I have had enough to do to see the Fault through my Friend; my very judging Faculty hath been somewhat bribed to spare the Sin, lest I fall too foul on the Subject of it; and how have I found out a weak Brain, or strong Temptation, something or other to extenuate the Of∣fence. —When I would look upon mine own Condition as I am a Man, and would seriously weigh the End I came hither for, and my Departure from hence, and would in Contemplati∣on draw near unto him in whom all my Happiness depends, and to help my Thoughts I look upon the round World and my self, and turn over History and record Examples; and yet alas!

Sometimes I would fain sit aloft and look on the Earth as a Theatre, and us Men acting a Tragi-Comedy, while the Almighty, blessed for ever, (who hath appointed to each Man his Part) and the glorious Angels are Spectators; and I consider how every one enters, and then hath his <HI>Exit</HI>; how grosly some are mistaken, that when they are charged to act as Men, they play the Beast and are hissed off the Stage; and others tho' they come on with Fear and Trembling, yet they depart with Applause. Sometimes again I wou'd consider my self and all others as Workers in a Vineyard; a Sort labouring with some Diligence expecting Pay at Night, others sitting idle, guzling out their Wages, laying hold on the present only; and then I look up to Heaven for a Master: Thus, tho' we know Things but dis∣cursive, I have sometimes talked with my self; but alas when all is done, I can but glance at Things, consider them under im∣perfect Notions, nor can I at all keep on foot a Meditation of any Worth, but intervenent Matters soon take me off and blind me, put my Head under Water again; Relations of Parents and Friends, Vicissitude of Things, Day and Night, Winter and Summer, Peace and War, Sickness and Health, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Affecti∣ons, Desires, Fears and Duties of my Place as I am of such a Calling, as I am a Subject, a Son, a Husband, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Oh these pull me down again into the middle Region, wherein Light is infest∣ed with Vapours, and I am eclipsed with I know not what In∣terpositions. Nay, when I do more than thus discourse with my self alone, when I set my self where I may be spoken to from Heaven, and hear perfect Directions for the right esteem of Things, where I may partake of such blessed Ordinances as would clear my Understanding to conceive aright; order my Affections, and form my whole Soul; here alas I find my self a narrow mouthed Bottle, unfit to receive what's instilled, the precious Liquor runs beside, and I am so taken up and termina∣ted in the Ceremony, Objects of these corporeal Eyes, or in the <HI>Opero operato,</HI> that I cannot without much Difficulty in the least

<HEAD>Of Ʋndermining Policy.</HEAD>
<P>THere is a sort of cunning Men whom the World stile's Politicians, tho' somewhat improperly, for they labour of the Disease called the Feaver of Policy, or the Distemper of Prudence; and tho' they make fair as if indued with this no∣ble Virtue, (if I may call it a Virtue, and not rather <HI>aliarum Virtutum Retrix)</HI> yet I rather term it in them <HI>Calliditas, Astutia, Dolus,</HI> or some one of those which indeed doth somewhat re∣semble and emblemish Prudence; and tho' the same Hands at∣tend this Vice which wait upon the other Virtue, as Memory, Understanding, Providence, Circumspection and Caution, yet as old <HI>Ennius</HI> says of the Ape,
<Q><L>Simia quam similis turpissima</L>
<L>Bestia nobis?</L>
<L>See how the Ape resembles thee,</L>
<L>And yet a filthy Beast is he.</L></Q></P>
<P>So I'll say of this, that it is a Counterfeit of Virtue, do's not at all add to it, but makes it more odious, for the Truth is so glorious, and we stand so much upon the Esteem of our Un∣derstanding and Judgment, that we hate <HI>Legerdemain,</HI> and rec∣kon it the greatest Disparagement to have been gulled.</P>
<P>But to difference it from the Virtue mentioned, that Sha∣dow may not cousen us, the Philosopher tells us of another Retinue of Prudence which are no Followers of that Vice, <HI>Prudentia</HI> (saith he) <HI>ubicunc{que} vere est ibi sunt omnes Virtutes, et ibi est omnis Probitas,</HI> and here we have out-stripped the crafty Politician; &amp; besides, we know that <HI>Prudentia est agendi Habitus,</HI> and that if a Man would <HI>act prudently,</HI> it is not only necessary that the Matter and the Manner of the Action should be Good, but the End also suitable; but our Politician fails in

some of these, and tho' his Way and Proceed in a Design seem never so candid and without Exception, yet in the Close of it he sometimes appears in his Colours, and you may then per∣ceive his Aim was to catch, to circumvent, to go beyond ano∣ther, and his <HI>Principium movendi</HI> is discovered to be some base Desire of Pleasure or Profit. If he be Master of his Trade, his Understanding only travels into the World, and his Affect∣ions are terminated in himself, he fear's his own Mischief, love's not for worth of the Object, but as it makes to his own Advantage; his Passions are bound in Chains, he can over-pow∣er his Anger at pleasure, and can cover Envy with a Smile: <HI>Fronti nulla fides</HI> was never better applied than to him, there 's no grosser Hypocrite than he, he 's not guilty of any Virtue but that of Temperance, whereby he curb 's every irregular Motion; and he befools the Ghost of a Man that turned <HI>Non nobis nati sumus</HI> into a Proverb, for his Rules are out of the Tragedi∣an <HI>Scelere velandum est Scelus, &amp; per Scelera semper Sceleribus tutum est Iter.</HI> Two sorts of Men tend this Way, the first of these are they that do not only conceal their wicked Plot while in <HI>Fieri,</HI> but so palliate the Matter having obtained their End, that the Issue shall be attributed to Virtue, or at least to Chance: These are indeed the very First-born of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> and as dangerous as dishonest. The other are they whom the World counts Men of Policy, and call 's shrewd Men; but this Esteem they have, ariseth from their Weakness more than any thing else; these are they that would fain be reputed Men of Brains, and you may easily know them, for their Discourse runs gene∣rally upon the Censure of another's Head-piece; you shall hear them bless themselves in their Arrival at some happy At∣chievement, and you cannot want Information, how they had surely perisht in the <HI>Charybdis</HI> or <HI>Scylla</HI> of many Interruptions, had not their Prudence as a Pilot unerringly steered them: but these Men if they gain the Credit they hunt after, they lose the Opportunity of perfecting a second Project, and are a∣voided as a perilous Quick-fand, and 'tis their usual Lot that

When a Man discovers his drawn Weapon he is not like to do much Mischief; a wise Man would out of Choice deal with one of these, rather than a dull Fellow that hath no Spring, for he'll know how far his Byas will lead him, and easily serve himself of him. But shall I say what I think? Why, truly my Judg∣ment is wrapped up in that old (but golden) Saying, <HI>Plain Dealing is a Jewel.</HI> If we'll but read the Creatures, we shall see the most noble are the freest from Wiles, as the royal and mag∣nanimous Lion▪ the iron-sinewed Elephant, of whose Wisdom and Sagacity we may hear to Wonderment, and for his Valour it is set forth in History sufficiently in his <HI>pugna cum Draconi∣bus et Rhinocerote</HI>; and what more common than to read <HI>de E∣lephantorum Clementia, Pudore, Amore,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Now as <HI>Seneca</HI> says of Fears, <HI>qui pavet vanos Metus veros fa∣tetur,</HI> so I'll say of Desires, for from them I can gather that Man has not Happiness at Home; it must be had somewhere out of himself, and because Desire is natural as to see and hear, and the <HI>Axiom</HI> is <HI>Deus et Natura nil frustra,</HI> I am sure there is an <HI>adequate Object,</HI> there is SOMETHING able to satisfie; and seeing all the finite Creatures cannot do it, it must be the <HI>infinite God,</HI> blessed for ever, who alone is alsufficient, who is able to fill every Dimension of the Soul.</P>
<P>Until we arrive at this Heaven, we are tossed and find no Rest, we are hurried by our Passions, as by so many Waves and Cross-winds; one promising the Felicity we look for in <HI>that,</HI> and another in this; and thus are most led aside by those <HI>Syron-songs,</HI> 'till at length they are rockt asleep, dashed upon a miserable Shipwreck, and do <HI>post omnia perdere Nautam.</HI></P>
<P>'Till we are in the Way to this <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> to this consummate Good, we wander after <HI>Ignes fatuos,</HI> many foolish and noisom Lusts which drown Men in Perdition: 'Till we re∣turn to this Ark, we find no Stay for the Sole of our Foot.

May my Resolutions and Endeavours always be to turn my Desires into a right Channel, seeing they will perpetually boil up; and may I always dam up the sensitive and make them rational and humane.</P>
<P>I must labour to be like one of those <HI>Inferiores Belgae</HI> curious in Surveying the Banks, make daily use of my Commission of Sewers, and of my Reason, I must take care to prevent an In∣undation of <HI>those</HI> that <HI>these</HI> may run more unitedly; and where Appetite is a Disease, I must take care that I do not <HI>venienti occurrere Morbo</HI>; but where 'tis placed aright, when I can with Integrity say <HI>non est Mortale quod opto,</HI> then I must hasten my Paoe, here it is Sin to be slack: I am commanded <HI>to give all Diligence to make Election sure; the Kingdom of Hea∣ven suffers Violence</HI>; I am bid <HI>to love God with all my Heart, Soul and Strength</HI>; do I not <HI>run in a Race</HI>; do I not <HI>work in a Vineyard</HI>; do I not <HI>try Masteries,</HI> and <HI>fight for a Crown?</HI> Away then with Supiness here and idle Curiosity, I have Sea-room enough, and I must put on all my Sails: And if <HI>Augustine</HI> speak Truth, when he says there is <HI>Dul∣cedo Pietatis et Pulchritudo Virtutis,</HI> let me tast, let me fall in love with them; if in the gracious Presence of God there is Plenitude of Joy, and eternal Pleasures, I must shew that I believe it, by my Desire to remain always un∣der the Shadow of the Almighty.</P>

<HEAD>A Copy of VERSES <HI>To a very Ingenious Young Gentleman in the Country.</HI> Written <HI>May</HI> 24<HI>th.</HI> 1714.</HEAD>
<L>IN shady Groves, in dear, delightful Plains,</L>
<L>In silent Shades where peaceful Quiet reigns,</L>
<L>There in soft Ease, there happy <HI>Tityre</HI></L>
<L>Thou liv'st from Care and noisie Tumults free.</L>
<L>Believe me Friend 'tis <HI>this</HI> is Happiness,</L>
<L>And shou'd be lookt upon as real Bliss.</L>
<L>But don't mistake me Sir,</L>
<L>Nor think I hold that there is nothing good</L>
<L>But what 's deducible from Solitude;</L>
<L>There is one Blessing more, which happy I</L>
<L>To th' utmost Height of Happiness enjoy:</L>
<L>(Such Happiness I mean as is by Fate</L>
<L>Allow'd unto our sublunary State.)</L>
<L>It is a soft, a dear, obliging Fair,</L>
<L>Who with her Charms dispels intruding Care:</L>
<L>Whose dear Enjoyment Softness do's infuse</L>
<L>To all my Verse, and animates my Muse.</L>
<L>'Tis She alone, believe me Sir, 'tis She</L>
<L>Raises my Numbers into Harmony.</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="001715_0046_0FB74EB75F8B39D0"/>But yet, when scarcely eighteen Years had ran</L>
<L>Over my Head,</L>
<L>And sprouting Down began to promise Man,</L>
<L>Then, then I've hear'd, (I've hear'd it with Delight)</L>
<L>I've hear'd it whisper'd—<HI>Corydon can write.</HI></L>
<L>But ah!—</L>
<L>Since sacred <HI>Hymen's</HI> genial Taper shone,</L>
<L>And with its Brightness warm'd young <HI>Corydon,</HI></L>
<L>Fame I have hear'd with her loud Trumpet tell</L>
<L>(Oh may 't be true!)—<HI>young</HI> Corydon <HI>writes well.</HI></L>
<L>Thus (dearest Friend) you see I plainly show</L>
<L>That all <HI>my Joys</HI> from th' Premises do flow.</L>
<L>And yet I wou'd not have you think that I</L>
<L>Owe this <HI>great</HI> BLISS to Sensuality,</L>
<L>No, mine 's a noble Flame.</L>
<L>Our Consort-Souls harmoniously do move,</L>
<L>And Pilot-Reason dictates how to love.</L>
<L>These are the Pleasures I 've been treating of,</L>
<L>Which tho' I'm full, I have not yet enough.</L>
<L>Dear Youth,</L>
<L>May your <HI>caelebian</HI> Sun serenely set,</L>
<L>And may indulgent Heaven then see fit,</L>
<L>To crown the Residue of your remaining Life</L>
<L>With that great Happiness, a vertuous Wife,</L>
<L>And may You then with me</L>
<L>And Halcyon-Days, in that bright Orbit move,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Hymen</HI> dwells with all the Charms of Love.</L>
