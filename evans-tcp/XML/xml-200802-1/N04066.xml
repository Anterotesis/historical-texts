<L>I love the Zeal that fires good DAVENPORT's Breast,</L>
<L>But his harsh Censures give my Soul no rest;</L>
<L>Our worthy <HI>Guides</HI> whom GOD has much inflam'd</L>
<L>As unexperienc'd Souls, alas, he nam'd;</L>
<L>Hence giddy Youth a wosul Licence take;</L>

<L>Conversion is become the Drunkard's Song;</L>
<L>GOD's glorious Work, which sweetly did arise,</L>
<L>By this unguarded sad Imprudence dies;</L>
<L>Contention spreads her Harpy Claws around,</L>
<L>In every Church her hateful Stings are found</L>
<L>But as these Thoughts my troubled Mind opprest,</L>
<L><HI>Sleep</HI> sweet Cessation instantly refresh'd,</L>
<L>My Tumults calm, and new-born Pleasure rise,</L>
<L>A charming VISION swims before my Eyes.</L>

<L>The sacred Man is to his Shade convey'd,</L>
<L>On Cammomile his aking Temples laid;</L>
<L>Here Roses, Honey-Suckles, Jessamine</L>
<L>In beauteous Arches o'er the Champion twine;</L>
<L>Here Nature does her flowery Glories spread,</L>
<L>Sheets of white Lillies dress the lovely Bed,</L>
<L>With rich Cor'nations for his Coverlid;</L>
<L>Here pretty Birds employ each smiling Hour</L>
<L>In noble Toyls to deck the charming Bower;</L>
<L><HI>Arabia</HI> Trace for Spices in the Bloom,</L>
<L>And with enamel'd Branches straw the Room;</L>
<L>Here gilded Clouds <HI>Ambrosia</HI> Drops distill,</L>
<L>And all the Air with matchless Odors fill;</L>
<L>Here gentle Zephyrs fan the fragant Flowers,</L>
<L>While singing Angels guard his sleeping Hours:</L>
<L>Now as the shining Warriors watch his Bed,</L>
<L>These <HI>gentle Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks</HI> they whisper in his Head;</L>
<L>'Favourite of Heaven! How came it in thy Mind?</L>
<L>'That Grace was so much to thy self confin'd;</L>
<L>'Crush the proud Thought, and kill it in the Bud;</L>
<L>'Too long you have in this sad Error stood;</L>

<L>'FATHER, he cries, Creator of my Peace,</L>

<P>To the Rev. Mr A—d—ew C—w-ll, On his writing against some of the worthy Ministers of the Gospel.</P>
<L>GO dear lov'd <HI>C—w—l</HI> rest on <HI>D—p—t</HI>'s Bed,</L>
<L>To ease the Pains that seize your lab'ring Head,</L>
<L>There let your tuneful Soul with Angels join;</L>
<L>There let your Sentiments and Stile refine.</L>
<L>May heavenly Language from your Lips distill,</L>
<L>And Love's soft Hand guide your ingenious Quill,</L>
<L>Then worthy <HI>F-x—ft</HI> you no more will blame,</L>
<L>Or so reflect on gentle <HI>T—r—l's</HI> Name,</L>
<L>Your Fathers and your Brethren don't despise;</L>
<L>Tho' you'r array'd with <HI>Argus</HI> shining Eyes:</L>
<L>An Optick-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old turn inward, you may view,</L>
<L>Some Imperfection that remains in you.</L>
<L>Excuse the Freedom real Friendship takes,</L>
<L>And le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Wisdom just Improvement make:</L>
<L>How can Reflections those blest Lips employ,</L>
<L>That Heav'n has form'd to raise immortal Joy,</L>
<L>You have the Art to win with melting Words;</L>
<L>You need not use Granadoes, Darts and Swords;</L>
<L>Let rougher Minds these hostile Weapons take;</L>
<L>By Love divine hard Hearts in Pieces break.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="005011_0008_100E5F6E06410B30"/>My Soul by you it's glorious Power has felt.</L>
<L>My Bosom warms all my Affections melt:</L>
<L>I should not think a thousand Winters long,</L>
<L>While Jesus Love sounds sweetly from your Tongue</L>
<L>Many such Times has Sovereign Love return'd:</L>
<L>By many Instruments my Heart has burn'd;</L>
<L>Then blame me not if I should take the Part</L>
<L>Of all, whom GOD has made to reach my Heart;</L>
<L>I cannot bear a Mortal should reflect</L>
<L>Or treat our precious Guides with cold Neglect:</L>
<L>I beg on bended Knees, with flowing Tears,</L>
<L>You may not give me ground for future Fears;</L>
<L>GOD does their mutual pious Labours bless,</L>
<L>Don't Methods take to lessen their Success;</L>
<L>But Hand in Hand the glorious Work pursue,</L>
<L>There's sweet Employ for many more than you:</L>
<L>Each faithful Shepard does perform his Part;</L>
<L>Some rouse the Conscience, others chear the Heart;</L>
<L>Some from mount <HI>Sinai</HI> throw the awful Flame;</L>
<L>While some sweet Peace in <HI>Jesus</HI> do proclaim.</L>
<L>Each have their different Talents from the Lord,</L>
<L>And each to wandring Souls their help afford.</L>
<L>If I should perish, them I cannot blame;</L>
<L>But my deceitful Heart must take eternal Shame.</L>
