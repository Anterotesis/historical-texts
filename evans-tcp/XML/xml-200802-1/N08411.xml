<ARGUMENT>
<P>An Invocation of the Divine Spirit. A Description of the Temple of <HI>Moloch,</HI> in the Valley of <HI>Hinnon,</HI> where a Congress of infernal Powers are met, to contrive some Method to extirpate the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Race.</P>

<L>The morning stars danc'd to the charming sound:</L>
<L>Yet thou hast often left the chrystal tow'rs,</L>
<L>To visit mortals in their humble bow'rs.</L>

<LG>
<L>Favour'd by thee, the courtly swain of old,</L>

<L>The fountains rose, the streams their course withheld,</L>

<L>The Birds sit silent on the branches near,</L>
<L>The flocks and herds their verdant food forbear.</L>
<L>The swains forgot their Labour, while he sung,</L>
<L>How from the dust their great forefather sprung:</L>
<L>A vital call awoke him from the ground,</L>
<L>The moving clay obey'd th' Almighty sound.</L>
<L>Thus sung in lofty strains the noble bard;</L>

<L>But thou, propitious Muse, a gentler fire</L>
<L>Didst breathe, and tune to softer notes the lyre,</L>

<L>The beauties of his lov'd <HI>Egyptian</HI> sing:</L>
<L>The sacred lays a mystick sense infold,</L>

<L><PB N="7" REF="010760_0005_0F81796E257E4440"/>The strictest rules of chastity she knew,</L>

<L>Such justice never mingle with my fame,</L>

<L>Ascended high a venerable wood;</L>
<L>The solemn shades, which gave a sacred dread,</L>
<L>Conceal'd a vaulted structure for the dead,</L>
<L><HI>Machpelah</HI> call'd; with wondrous labour wrought;</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>An Angel visits <HI>Joseph</HI> in Prison, and in a prophetic Vision shews him his own Advancement, and the future Fate of his Father's Posterity, their Bondage and mi∣raculous Deliverance.

</LG>
<LG>
<L>From the unclouded realms of day above,</L>
<L>From endless pleasures, and unbounded love,</L>
<L>From painted fields, deck'd with immortal flow'rs,</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The seven plenteous Years; with the ensuring Years of Scarcity. <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Character as Regent over the Land of <HI>Egypt. Jacob</HI> distressed with the Famine, sends his Sons thither for Corn. <HI>Joseph</HI> discovers his Brethren, but is unknown of them: Pretends to suspect them as public Spies, and keeps them three Days in Prison; at last sends them back, with a Charge to bring their younger Brother with them, and detains <HI>Simeon</HI> as an Hostage till their Return.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THE jocund years, with smiling plenty crown'd,</L>
<L>In shining circles, now advanc'd their round:</L>
<L>Unbounded crops reward the reaper's toil,</L>
<L>And rustic pleasures chear the banks of <HI>Nile.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Hebrew,</HI> late advanc'd by royal grace,</L>
<L>With dignity and spendor fills his place,</L>
<L>Still watchful for the public good, with care</L>
<L>Restrains excess, by penalties severe,</L>
<L>While justice, truth, and temp'rate virtue, reign'd</L>
<L>Amidst the height of plenty thro' the land:</L>
<L>His prudent sway, the grateful people bless</L>
<L>In all the calm serenity of peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But soon the smiling years their period run,</L>
<L>A gloomy aera now its course begun:</L>
<L>Pale famine comes, with her malignant train,</L>
<L>Dries up the springs, and taints the fertile plain:</L>
<L>The trees decay, each flow'r, and balmy plant,</L>
<L>Pine at their roots, and vital humour want:</L>
<L>No pearly moisture on the meadow lies,</L>
<L>To fan the air no gentle breezes rise.</L>
<L>The languid moon sheds from her silent sphere</L>
<L>No cooling dews, the thirsty earth to chear.</L>
<L>A sultry night ensues a scorching day;</L>
<L>While dismal signs the fiery clouds display.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor <HI>Egypt</HI> mourns alone her blasted ground,</L>
<L>Pale famine stalks thro' all the regions round:</L>
<L><HI>Moriah</HI>'s plain, and <HI>Hermon</HI>'s flow'ry hill,</L>
<L>Wither'd and bare, the hot contagion feel:</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="010760_0024_0F817980D21184D0"/>That fertile climate, by peculiar grace,</L>
<L>Design'd the lot of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s future race,</L>
<L>Where long with peace, and fatal plenty gay,</L>
<L>The pagan princes bore imperial sway,</L>
<L>Their crimes not full:—While <HI>Jacob</HI> sojourn'd here</L>
<L>A stranger, as his great forefathers were:</L>
<L>The common fate he shares, with famine press'd,</L>
<L>And for his num'rous family distress'd:</L>
<L>He sends his sons, by heav'nly conduct led,</L>
<L>To <HI>Egypt</HI>'s plenteous granaries, for bread:</L>
<L>Domestic wants require their utmost haste,</L>
<L>And <HI>Zoan</HI>'s regal tow'rs they reach at last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With soft <HI>Assyria,</HI> now in all her pride</L>
<L>Of wealth and grandeur, <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s palace vy'd:</L>
<L>More honour'd still the rising fav'rite grew,</L>
<L>No bounds his royal master's kindness knew:</L>
<L>His graceful person, charming to the sight,</L>
<L>Majestic, yet more mild than morning light:</L>
<L>His virtues ev'ry grateful tongue employ,</L>
<L>The people's boast, their wonder, and their joy.</L>
<L>All private views were to his soul unknown,</L>
<L>He made the kingdom's welfare still his own:</L>
<L>Th' oppressor's wrongs are by his pow'r redress'd,</L>
<L>He guards the orphan, succours the distress'd,</L>
<L>His fame to distant countries flies abroad,</L>
<L>While <HI>Egypt</HI> names him as her guardian God.</L>
<L>Assiduous still, his officers attend</L>
<L>Where neighb'ring states their num'rous envoys send;</L>
<L>Who for themselves, and pining race, implore</L>
<L>The food of life from his abundant store.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Among the foremost of the suppliant crowd</L>
<L>The <HI>Hebrew</HI> swains with low submission bow'd;</L>
<L>With stern regard each kindred face he views,</L>
<L>Their sight, the late detested scene renews;</L>
<L>Their parting malice, and inhuman rage,</L>
<L>To just revenge his swelling thoughts engage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long silent, in a gloomy pause he stands;</L>
<L>At last their country, bus'ness, name, demands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My lord, thy servants (with a modest grace</L>
<L><HI>Judah</HI> replies) are all of <HI>Hebrew</HI> race:</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="010760_0024_0F817980D21184D0"/>Twelve brethren late, a joyful father's boast,</L>
<L>Till one, by some unhappy chance, was lost;</L>
<L>The youngest with his aged sire remains,</L>
<L>The darling, which his drooping life sustains:</L>
<L>To purchase corn we come, our falling breath</L>
<L>And infant race to save from ling'ring death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy tale (he said) unfolds its own disguise,</L>
<L>By <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s sacred life, you all are spies:</L>

<L>Unmov'd we heard his tender eloquence.</L>
<L>Such beauty, innocence, and blooming grace,</L>
<L>Would have subdu'd in wilds a savage race,</L>
<L>What caves what dungeons, should such monsters hide?</L>

<L>When to the yawning pit you forc'd him down.</L>
<L>What hellish frenzy did your bosoms sire</L>

<L>A sleeping fancy's visionary scheme:</L>

<L>He nobly entertains each <HI>Hebrew</HI> guest:</L>
<L>Their hostage freed the mutual joy compleats,</L>

<L>With sprightly wines, and social converse gay,</L>
<L>In guiltless mirth they spend the fleeting day.</L>

<L>In calm repose supinely past the night,</L>

<L>Their coin the steward secretly convey'd,</L>
<L>A silver cup in <HI>Benjomin</HI>'s was laid.</L>

<LG>
<L>Secure the suburbs utmost bounds were past,</L>
<L>When, with a feign'd concern, and anxious haste,</L>
<L>He overtakes the hindmost of the train,</L>
<L>And thus accosts them in an angry strain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How could you thus, ungrateful and unjust,</L>
<L>Against the rules of hospitable trust</L>
<L>Combine, the consecrated cup to steal,</L>

<L>With what strange meaning is thy language fraught,</L>
<L>Surpriz'd they cry, we're guiltless, e'en in thought,</L>
<L>And by the immortal God, we dare protest,</L>
<L>Such black designs are strangers to our breast.</L>
<L>Our coin unask'd exactly we restor'd,</L>

<L>What can I say?—how shall thy servant speak?</L>
<L>In what pathetic words my silence break?</L>
<L>What energy of language shall I find,</L>
<L>To paint the wild distractions of my mind?</L>
<L>Justice divine, with keen revenge begins</L>

<HEAD>THE <HI>HERMIT.</HI> A POEM.</HEAD>
<Q>Now taught by this confess th' Almighty just, And where thou can't unravel, learn to trust.</Q>
<L>FAR in a wild, remote from public view,</L>
<L>From youth to age, a rev'rend Hermit grew;</L>
<L>The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,</L>
<L>His food the fruits, his drinks the chrystal well;</L>
<L>Unknown to man, with God he pass'd the days,</L>
<L>Pray'r all bus'ness, all his pleasure praise.</L>
<L>A life so sacred, such serene repose</L>
<L>Seem'd Heaven itself, till one suggestion rose,</L>
<L>That vice should triumph, virtue vice obey,</L>
<L>Hence sprung some doubts of providence's sway:</L>
<L>His hopes no more a certain prospect boast,</L>
<L>And all the tenor of his soul is lost:</L>
<L>To clear this doubt, to know the world by sight,</L>
<L>To find if books or swains report it right,</L>
<L>He with the sun a rising journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each event.</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="010760_0030_0F817985322DEE98"/>The morn was wasted in the pathless grass,</L>
<L>And long and lonesome was the wild to pass;</L>
<L>But when the southern sun had warm'd the day,</L>
<L>A youth came posting o'er a crossing way.</L>
<L>His raiment decent, his complexion fair,</L>
<L>And soft in graceful ringlets wav'd his hair,</L>
<L>Then near approaching, father, hail! he cry'd;</L>
<L>And hail, my son, the rev'rend sire reply'd.</L>
<L>Words follow'd words, from questions answers flow'd,</L>
<L>And talk of various kind deceiv'd the road.</L>
<L>Till each with other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>
<L>While in their age they differ, join in heart.</L>
<L>Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound;</L>
<L>Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around.</L>
<L>Now sunk the sun, the closing hour of day</L>
<L>Came onward, mantled o'er with sober gray,</L>
<L>Nature in silence bid the world repose,</L>
<L>When near the road a stately palace rose,</L>
<L>It chanc'd the generous master of the dome</L>
<L>Still made his house the wand'ring stranger's home,</L>
<L>Yet still the kindness, from a thirst of praise,</L>
<L>Prov'd the vain flourish of expensive ease.</L>
<L>The pair arrive: The liv'ry'd servants wait,</L>
<L>Their lord receives them at the pompous gate.</L>
<L>The table groans with costly piles of food,</L>
<L>And all is more than hospitable good.</L>
<L>Then led to rest, the day's long toil they drown,</L>
<L>Deep sunk in sleep, and silk and heaps of down.</L>
<L>At length 'tis morn, and at the dawn of day</L>
<L>Along the wide canals the zephyrs play,</L>
<L>Up rise the guests obedient to the call,</L>
<L>An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall.</L>
<L>Rich luscious wine a golden vessel grac'd,</L>
<L>Which the kind master forc'd the guests to taste;</L>
<L>Then pleas'd and thankful, from the porch they go,</L>
<L>And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe:</L>
<L>His cup was vanish'd, for in secret guise</L>
<L>The younger guest purloin'd the glitt'ring prize.</L>
<L>As one who spies a serpent in his way,</L>
<L>Glist'ning and basking in the summer's ray,</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="010760_0030_0F817985322DEE98"/>Disorder'd stops, to shun the danger near,</L>
<L>Then walks with faintness on, and looks with fear.</L>
<L>So seem'd the sire, when far upon the road</L>
<L>The shining spoil his wily partner show'd;</L>
<L>He stopp'd with silence, walk'd with trembling heart,</L>
<L>And much he wish'd, but durst not ask to part;</L>
<L>Murm'ring he lifts his eyes, and thinks it hard</L>
<L>That generous actions meet a base reward.</L>
<L>While thus they pass the sun his glory shrouds,</L>
<L>The changing skies hang out their sable clouds,</L>
<L>A sound in air presag'd approaching rain,</L>
<L>And beasts to covert scud a-cross the plain:</L>
<L>Warn'd by the signs the wand'ring pair retreat,</L>
<L>To seek for shelter at a neighbouring seat;</L>
<L>'Twas built with turrets on a rising ground,</L>
<L>And strong and large, and unimprov'd around;</L>
<L>Its owner's temper, timorous and severe,</L>
<L>Unkind and griping, caus'd a desart there.</L>
<L>As near the miser's heavy doors they drew,</L>
<L>Fierce rising gusts with sudden sury blew,</L>
<L>The nimble light'ning mix'd with show'rs began,</L>
<L>And o'er their heads loud rolling thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the wind, and batter'd by the rain;</L>
<L>At length some pity warm'd the master's breast,</L>
<L>'Twas then his threshold, first receiv'd a guest,</L>
<L>Slow creeking turns the door with jealous care,</L>
<L>And half he welcomes in the shiv'ring pair;</L>
<L>One frugal faggot lights the naked walls,</L>
<L>And nature's fervour thro' their limbs recals,</L>
<L>Bread of the coarsest sort, with eager wine,</L>
<L>Each harldy granted, serv'd them both to dine:</L>
<L>And when the tempest first appear'd to cease,</L>
<L>A ready warning bid them part in peace.</L>
<L>With still remark the pond'ring Hermit view'd,</L>
<L>In one so rich, a life so poor and rude,</L>
<L>And why should such, within himself he cry'd,</L>
<L>Lock the lost wealth, a thousand want beside.</L>
<L>But what new marks of wonder soon took place</L>
<L>In every settling feature of his face,</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="010760_0031_0F8179878D4F5D28"/>When from his vest the young companion bore</L>
<L>That cup the gen'rous landlord own'd before,</L>
<L>And paid profusely with the precious bowl,</L>
<L>The stinted kindness of this churlish soul.</L>
<L>But now the clouds in airy tumult fly,</L>
<L>The sun emerging ope's an azure sky;</L>
<L>A fresher green the smelling leaves display,</L>
<L>And glitt'ring as they tremble cheer the day;</L>
<L>The weather courts them from the poor retreat,</L>
<L>And the glad master bolts the wary gate.</L>
<L>While hence they walk, the Pilgrim's bosom wrought,</L>
<L>With all the travel of uncertain thought;</L>
<L>His partner's acts without their cause appear,</L>
<L>'Twas there a vice, and seem'd a madness here;</L>
<L>Detesting that, and pitying this, he goes,</L>
<L>Lost and confounded with the various shows.</L>
<L>Now night's dim shades involve the azure sky,</L>
<L>Again they search and find a lodging nigh.</L>
<L>The soil improv'd around, the mansion neat,</L>
<L>And neither poorly low, nor idly great;</L>
<L>It seem'd to speak its master's turn of mind,</L>
<L>Content, and not for praise, but virtue, kind;</L>
<L>Hither the walkers turn with weary feet,</L>
<L>Then bless the mansion, and the master greet;</L>
<L>Their greeting fair bestow'd with modest guise,</L>
<L>The courteous master hears, and thus replies;</L>
<L>Without a vain, without a grudging heart,</L>
<L>To him who gives us all, I yield a part,</L>
<L>From him you come, for him accept it here</L>
<L>A frank and sober more than costly cheer.</L>
<L>He spoke, and bid the welcome table spread,</L>
<L>Then talk'd of virtue, till the time of bed;</L>
<L>When the grave houshold round his hall repair,</L>
<L>Warn'd by a bell, and close the hours with pray'r.</L>
<L>At length the world renew'd by calm repose,</L>
<L>Was strong for toil; the dappled morn arose.</L>
<L>Before the Pilgrim's part, the younger crept</L>
<L>Near the clos'd cradle, where an infant slept,</L>
<L>And writh'd his neck, the landlord's little pride,</L>
<L>O strange return! grew black, and gasp'd, and dy'd.</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="010760_0031_0F8179878D4F5D28"/>Horror of horrors! what, his only Son!</L>
<L>How look'd our Hermit, when the fact was done!</L>
<L>Not hell, tho' hell's black jaws in sunder part,</L>
<L>And breathe blue fire, could more assault his heart.</L>
<L>Confus'd, and struck with silence at the deed,</L>
<L>He flies, but trembling fails to fly with speed;</L>
<L>His steps the youth pursues, the country lay</L>
<L>Perplex'd with roads, a servant show'd the way;</L>
<L>A river cross'd the path, the passage o'er</L>
<L>Was nice to find, the servant trod before;</L>
<L>Long arms of oaks an open bridge supply'd,</L>
<L>And deep the waves beneath them bending glide.</L>
<L>The youth who seem'd to watch a time to sin,</L>
<L>Approach'd the careless guide, and thrust him in:</L>
<L>Plunging he falls, and rising lifts his head,</L>
<L>Then flashing turns, and finks among the dead.</L>
<L>Wild sparkling rage inflames the father's Eyes,</L>
<L>He bursts the bands of fear, and madly cries,</L>
<L>Detested wretch.—But scarce his speech began,</L>
<L>When the strange partner seem'd no longer man;</L>
<L>His youthful face grew more serenely sweet,</L>
<L>His robe turn'd white, and flow'd upon his feet,</L>
<L>Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair,</L>
<L>Celestial odours breath'd thro' purple air;</L>
<L>The form etherial bursts upon his sight,</L>
<L>And moves in all the majesty of light:</L>
<L>Tho' loud at first the Pilgrim's passion grew,</L>
<L>Sudden he gaz'd, and wist not what to do.</L>
<L>Surprize in secret chains his words suspends,</L>
<L>And in a calm his settling temper ends.</L>
<L>But silence here the beauteous Angel broke,</L>
<L>The voice of music ravish'd as he spoke,</L>
<L>Thy pray'r, thy praise, thy life to vice unknown,</L>
<L>In sweet memorial rise before the throne,</L>
<L>These charms success in our bright region find,</L>
<L>And force an Angel down to calm thy mind;</L>
<L>For this commission'd I forsook the sky,</L>
<L>Nay cease to kneel—thy fellow-servant I;</L>
<L>Then know the truth of government divine,</L>
<L>And let these scruples be no longer thine;</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="010760_0032_0F81798844A3B2C8"/>The maker justly claims that world he made,</L>
<L>In this right of Providence is laid;</L>
<L>Its sacred majesty thro' all depends,</L>
<L>On using second means to work his ends;</L>
<L>'Tis thus withdrawn in state from human eye,</L>
<L>The power exerts his attributes on high;</L>
<L>Your actions uses, nor controuls your will,</L>

<L>What strange events can strike with more surprise,</L>
<L>Than those which lately struck thy wand'ring eyes?</L>
<L>Yet taught by these, confess th' Almighly just,</L>
<L>And where thou can't unriddle, learn to trust.</L>
<L>The great vain man who far'd on costly food,</L>
<L>Whose life was too luxurious to be good,</L>
<L>Who made his ivory stands with goblets shine,</L>
<L>And forc'd his guests to morning draughts of wine,</L>
<L>Has, with the cup, the graceless custom lost,</L>
<L>And still he welcomes, but with less of cost.</L>
<L>The mean suspicious wretch, whose bolted door</L>
<L>Ne'er mov'd in duty to the wandering poor,</L>
<L>With him I left the cup, to teach his mind,</L>
<L>That Heav'n can bless, if mortals will be kind,</L>
<L>Conscious of wanting worth he views the bowl,</L>
<L>And feels compassion touch his grateful soul;</L>
<L>Thus artists the sullen oar of lead,</L>
<L>With heaping coals of fire upon its head;</L>
<L>In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow,</L>
<L>And loose from dross the silver runs below.</L>
<L>Long had our pious friend in virtue trod,</L>
<L>But now this child half wean'd his heart from God.</L>
<L>Child of his age, for him he liv'd in pain,</L>
<L>And measur'd back his steps to earth again:</L>
<L>To great excesses had his dotage run;</L>
<L>But God, to save the father, took the son.</L>
<L>To all, but thee, in fits he seem'd to go,</L>
<L>And 'twas my ministry to deal the blow.</L>
<L>The poor, fond parent humbled in the dust,</L>
<L>Now owns, in tears, the punishment is just.</L>
<L>But how had all his fortune felt a wreck,</L>
<L>Had that false servant sped in safety back?</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="010760_0032_0F81798844A3B2C8"/>This night his treasur'd heaps he meant to steal,</L>
<L>And what a fund of charity would fail?</L>
<L>Thus Heav'n instructs thy mind; this trial o'er,</L>
<L>Depart in peace, resign, and sin no more.</L>
<L>On sounding pinions here the youth withdrew,</L>
<L>The sage stood wond'ring as the seraph flew;</L>
<L>Thus look'd <HI>Elisha,</HI> when to mount on high</L>
<L>His master took the chariot of the sky,</L>

<L>The Hermit, bending, here a pray'r begun,</L>

<L>(So <HI>Moses</HI> writes, and all our <HI>Christian seers</HI>)</L>
<L>The <HI>World,</HI> a rude, unfashion'd embryo lay,</L>
<L>Eternal night, without one glimpse of day;</L>
<L>Earth, seas and heav'n, in one blind <HI>chaos</HI> thrown,</L>
<L>And years, and months, and days, were names unknown,</L>
<L>Till God mark'd out the wide, unbounded space,</L>
<L>And stampt CREATION on the formless mass:</L>
<L>Wide o'er the <HI>void</HI> his genial wings he spread,</L>
<L>And <HI>entity</HI> uprear'd its infant head.</L>
<L>Prone to her center sunk the <HI>earth</HI> below,</L>
<L>And o'er her face the rising waters flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let there be light, said God; and sudden light</L>
<L>Sprang from the deep, and burst the womb of night:</L>
<L>Dreadful it gleam'd along the barren waste,</L>
<L>Hell started, and old chaos stood aghast;</L>
<L>From the dark gloom he call'd the chearful light;</L>
<L>Preserv'd its bounds, and wing'd it for the flight.</L>
<L>God saw, approv'd, and blest the spreading ray;</L>
<L>And the first ev'ning clos'd the first created day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again th' Almighty said; let us prepare</L>
<L>A wide expanse of undulating air;</L>
<L>And let it be, the waters to remove</L>
<L>Beneath the firmament from thofe above;</L>
<L>He spake benign; and with his out-stretch'd hand,</L>
<L>Establish'd the immutable command.</L>
<L>Forthwith thin vapours from the gulph arise,</L>
<L>Cloud after cloud, and thicken into skies:</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="010760_0033_0F817988EE7883D0"/>God saw and bless'd: While coral angels play,</L>
<L>And crown with joyful hymns the second day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still was the earth in ambient oceans drown'd,</L>
<L>Nor knew the waters their appointed bound;</L>
<L>When thus again heav'n's all-sufficient Lord,</L>
<L>Thro' the dark void pronounc'd his pow'rful word;</L>
<L>Hear, and obey, ye waters, that below</L>
<L>The firmament in wild disorders flow;</L>
<L>Be gather'd into one capacious bed,</L>
<L>And let dry land upheave her naked head:</L>
<L>Th' almighty thus; and sudden at the word,</L>
<L>Obedient down the hills the torrents pour'd;</L>
<L>Thro' porous veins impetuous waters sweep,</L>
<L>And headlong crowd into a chrystal heap:</L>
<L>Low sunk beneath the hallow'd earth, provides</L>
<L>An ample bason for the rushing tides.</L>
<L>Emerging hills, and broken rocks arise,</L>
<L>And lift their craggy summits to the skies.</L>
<L>God saw it, and confirm'd the wise decree,</L>
<L>He nam'd the dry land earth, the waters sea;</L>
<L>And said, let grateful verdure clothe the earth,</L>
<L>And let the fields conceive a various birth;</L>
<L>Let tender grass, and painted flow'rs arise,</L>
<L>And to the season trust their gaudy dyes:</L>
<L>Let lofty trees their shady honours spread,</L>
<L>And fragrant herbs perfume the springing mead.</L>
<L>Scarce had he spoke, when lo! the quick'ning ground,</L>
<L>Spontaneous smil'd, with vernal beauty crown'd.</L>
<L>Flow'r, herb, and grass arise; and o'er the plain,</L>
<L>Mature for harvest, waves the bearded grain:</L>
<L>Unplanted trees drive deep their branching roots,</L>
<L>Spread in the air, and bend with golden fruits,</L>
<L>God saw it, that 'twas good, and bless'd it all,</L>
<L>And the third day beheld the shadows fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again, said God, let radiant orbs appear,</L>
<L>Thro' the wide kingdom of the hemisphere;</L>
<L>Alternate day and darkness to divide,</L>
<L>And o'er the seasons of the year preside.</L>
<L>And God created two vast orbs of light,</L>
<L>To bear dividual rule, by day and night▪</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="010760_0034_0F81798E8DB431A8"/>And first the sun, an huge, unweildy sphere,</L>
<L>He fixt aloft, to lead the circling year;</L>
<L>To spread around his lustre, and bestow</L>
<L>Prolific influence on the world below.</L>
<L>To the bright car, he join'd the flaming horse,</L>
<L>Furnish'd with light, and pointed out his course;</L>
<L>With generous courage from the barrier freed,</L>
<L>O'er the wide azure bounds th' eternal steed,</L>
<L>Till from afar he views the less'ning east,</L>
<L>And hastens down the ruddy colour'd west;</L>
<L>There forms in halcyon waves a downy bed,</L>
<L>To rest his weary limbs, and quench his burning head.</L>
<L>Oppos'd to him the silver moon displays</L>
<L>Her spotted orb, and burns with fainter rays;</L>
<L>With levell'd aspect views his golden urn,</L>
<L>Feasts on his beams, and fills her farmish'd horn;</L>
<L>Which the Almighty fashion'd, to preside</L>
<L>O'er winds and waves, and rule the angry tide:</L>
<L>With spangling stars to join his trembling light,</L>
<L>And share the gloomy empire of the night:</L>
<L>Of spangling stars sprang forth, at his command,</L>
<L>And roll'd their destin'd orbs, a numerous band;</L>
<L>Darkness repuls'd, day scarce could night outvy,</L>
<L>And on the world bestow a brighter sky.</L>
<L>God saw, approv'd, and bless'd what he had made,</L>
<L>And the fourth day receiv'd the falling shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And God said, let the fruitful waters teem,</L>
<L>And moving creatures glide thro' ev'ry stream;</L>
<L>Let feather'd fowl thro' fluid kingdoms fly,</L>
<L>And with their pinions fan the floating sky.</L>
<L>He spoke; and strait the pregnant sea brought forth,</L>
<L>And ev'ry billow teem'd a scaly birth;</L>
<L>The huge Leviathan, from side to side,</L>
<L>Tumbled along, and flounc'd the thund'ring tide;</L>
<L>On the smooth calm the arching Dolphins play,</L>
<L>And shape, in sportive chace, their liquid way.</L>
<L>While embryo fowl distend their tepid shells,</L>
<L>Mature for life, and burst their scanty cells;</L>
<L>Or loosly rang'd, or firmly wedg'd, they rise</L>
<L>A feather'd cloud, and blacken half the skies.</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="010760_0034_0F81798E8DB431A8"/>The strong-pounc'd eagle, with unwearied fright,</L>
<L>Tow'rs the bright sun to his meridian height.</L>
<L>The elegiac nightingale prepares</L>
<L>His ev'ning song, and sinks in solemn airs.</L>
<L>The lark melodious, pois'd on levell'd wings,</L>
<L>Hangs in mid-air, and brisker carols sings;</L>
<L>Borne on the Breeze, her silver warblings float,</L>
<L>And the CREATOR swells in ev'ry note.</L>
<L>The crested cock, with a majestic mien,</L>
<L>Pains his shrill voice, and struts along the green.</L>
<L>With leathern oars the silver swan divides</L>
<L>The lakes, and proudly o'er the mirror rides.</L>
<L>While that fair bird, whose varied plumes unfold</L>
<L>Myriads of starry eyes, and gems of gold,</L>
<L>With conscious pride spreads forth his gorgeous train,</L>
<L>And with brocaded pinions sweeps the plain.</L>
<L>God saw that it was good, and gracious said,</L>
<L>(In mantling thunder, and in winds array'd)</L>
<L>Be fruitful, O ye creatures, that repair</L>
<L>On painted wings thro' fields of buoyant air;</L>
<L>Be fruitful, O ye creatures, that divide</L>
<L>The restless waves, and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave the briny tide;</L>
<L>Female and male increase with genial seed,</L>
<L>Replenish ev'ry stream, and multiply your breed.</L>
<L>While yet he spoke, the youthful sun descends,</L>
<L>And the fifth day in gloomy darkness ends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once more th' ALMIGHTY said; let fruitful earth</L>
<L>Unfold her womb, and teem with num'rous birth:</L>
<L>Let cattle in the field expect their food,</L>
<L>And savage beasts frequent the lonely wood;</L>
<L>Let reptile animals, a minim race,</L>
<L>And various insects swarm in every place.</L>
<L>Straitway the earth, impregnated, conceives,</L>
<L>And the swol'n glebe with num'rous offspring heaves:</L>
<L>The shaggy lion, and the bristled boar,</L>
<L>Rise into life, and thro' the desarts roar;</L>
<L>The ox and tyger, crowd the peaceful plain,</L>
<L>And the fleet courser shakes his flowing mane;</L>
<L>The vast behemoth, of enormous size,</L>
<L>Starts from the glebe, and rolls his glaring eyes;</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="010760_0035_0F81798F2A4D8B48"/>Behemoth, largest of all nature's race,</L>
<L>With ribs of iron, and with nerves of brass;</L>
<L>His loins are stronger than the temper'd mail,</L>
<L>And like a cedar moves his length of tail.</L>
<L>Still there remains, said God, the noblest part,</L>
<L>The boldest effort of creating art;</L>
<L>After our likeness let us draw the plan,</L>
<L>And in our image build immortal man;</L>
<L>MAN, o'er the riches of the earth to reign,</L>
<L>Of trackless air, and vast unbounded main;</L>
<L>Endow'd with reason, and a power to will;</L>
<L>Inclin'd to good, tho' not restrain'd from ill.</L>
<L>And from the dust God sharp'd the human frame,</L>
<L>And in his nostrils breath'd the living flame;</L>
<L>Female and male he sharp'd them, to command</L>
<L>Earth, air, and seas, and bless his righteous hand;</L>
<L>The brute machine confest th' informing ray,</L>
<L>And infant motion warm'd the struggling clay:</L>
<L>Wak'd into life, his eyes begin to roll,</L>
<L>His heart to beat, to meditate his soul;</L>
<L>Erect to Heav'n he lifts his ardent sight,</L>
<L>Charm'd with those glorious orbs, and worlds of rolling light.</L>
<L>Female and male God shap'd the human frame,</L>
<L>Incorp'rate, consubstantial, and the same;</L>
<L>In the man's side his consort woman lay,</L>
<L>Nor yet call'd forth to view the chearful day;</L>
<L>But Adam slept; for God his eye-lids prest,</L>
<L>And took the beauteous female from his breast;</L>
<L>From a stol'n rib the shining creature rose,</L>
<L>Fresh, fair, and spotless as the falling snows;</L>
<L>Sparkling and gay as the primaeval light,</L>
<L>Soft to the touch, and lovely to the sight;</L>
<L>With polish'd features, but an artless mind,</L>
<L>Unequal fate! to damn, and bless mankind.</L>
<L>Like fragrant flow'rs, she breath'd commanding love.</L>
<L>And her eyes glitter'd like the stars above;</L>
<L>So charming was the MOTHER of our race,</L>
<L>That Angels gaz'd in transport on her face.</L>
