<HEAD>THE <HI>GENUINE EXPERIENCE, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I DOLLY TAYLOR, of Reading, being ap∣prehensive that my dissolution draws very nigh, have requested the following line to be published after my decease in my name, as from a dying per∣son.</P>
<P>I was born in Chelmsford, near Boston, June 16th, 1755; was brought up from my infancy by a kind brother, who took care of my mother (as my father died one month to a day before I was born, and had been deprived of his sight from his child∣hood, so that he was stone blind.)—My mother and brother gave me a good education; but my mind, however was given to vanity and civil re∣creation, so that I was introduced to the best of company among my young companions.</P>
<P>In early life I enjoyed my health, and a fine flow of animal spirits, but lived without God in the world, and thought myself happy in the good esteem of all my friends and acquaintance.—I had no great concern about the welfare of my immor∣tal soul, until the day I was seventeen years of age. Having spent the night before in company, I was looking that morning on the bright and rolling flame of an heating oven, when the dread∣ful thoughts of a burning Hell struck my mind with horror and amazement!—I saw I had been dancing over the brink of destruction. Having never before put this question home to myself — What would become of my poor soul? I was now convinced that my reputation among my compan∣ions would never be any security for me, in the day of God's fiery anger. I saw I had offended Almigh∣ty
<PB N="4" REF="031269_0003_0FEBF062161C08C0"/>God, by giving myself up to vanity. My distress of mind encreased under this conviction, until I took to my chamber by myself and must leave it to those whose terrors of conscience have been very great, to judge of my case by their own experi∣ence.—The same company I had been with but a few hours before, in all the sprightliness of youth∣ful vanity, made application to me, to know when we should have another set dance; but I bid them a final adieu, and never joined myself in such company since; and it is my earnest desire, that all my young friends and acquaintance might be as effectually weaned from the love of such soul de∣stroying company, as I was at that time, and have ever since been.</P>
<P>My distress of mind, however, continued for some considerable time—the friendly admonitions of my affectionate mother and kind brother, to whom I had turned a deaf ear, from time to time, were now to me like so many thunder bolts from heaven, so that I was almost afraid to cry to God for mercy, fearing that I had, young as I was, sinned away the day of God's grace. The first gleam of comfort I receiv∣ed, was in reading the fortieth Psalm, which I de∣sire every reader to turn to, and read for them∣selves. I then thought I could praise God for his glorious excellency, and visited several godly minis∣ters and christian friends, with a view to discover what God had done for my soul; and in a little time I began to scruple my easy state, upon which I concluded myself to be in a more dangerous sit∣uation than I was before. Under these scruples, in the utmost anguish of mind, I fell sick of a fe∣ver, and my life was despaired of. Being asked one Sabdath day morning, if I did not desire to have prayers put up for me, while it was tho't I was just leaving the world? I answered, yes,
<PB N="5" REF="031269_0004_0FEBF064C7D0B3B0"/>but was under strong temptations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> prayers for me would prove ineffectual▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen I suddenly perceived the purity of divine justice in casting me off forever; and found an immediate sensible submission to God's will: Upon which I had a clear discovery of my blessed Saviour plead∣ing and interceding for me at the right hand of his Father; when there was a new song put into my mouth, so that I called out to my friends to praise God on my behalf, as a monument of rich grace and undeserved mercy. My bodily maladies were soon removed and I enjoyed sensible communion with the Father of Spirits. From this time I was established, and have never been exercised with like fears nor scruples since, although I have of∣ten times let down my watch, and have reason to lament my failings and imperfections, as an un∣worthy member of Christ's church on earth, but still I have a strong hope, through the merits of my blessed Redeemer, that I shall soon be out of the reach of sin and Satan, and shall have my gar∣ments washed in the blood of Christ.</P>
<P>Having experienced, since that time, a great deal of God's goodness, in carrying me through scenes of adversity, the most remarkable; I think I may truly say, that had not God been pleased to bring me up out of darkness into his marvellous light, I never should have been enabled (as I have) to endure my temporal afflictions with that pa∣tience and submission which I ascribe to the grace of God alone, and not to any virtue or goodness in my natural constitution and temper; for I was naturally inclined to be thought of in this world, as much as any other person; but God has taught me to be contented with my lot and condition, and to suffer with my family as I ought to do, through scenes of calamity, trials and afflictions
<PB N="6" REF="031269_0005_0FEBF06890A53330"/>of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> nature; those who are acquainted with the circumstances of our family, are sensible, that by means of an extraordinary infirm consti∣tution on my husband's part, together with long and repeated fits of sickness on my part, having been bedrid for a great part of my time, for a whole year at once, several times, and wholly un∣able to do scarce any houshold work for several years together; considering the extraordinary ex∣pences that have arisen, the oppressions and extor∣tions that have been practised upon us with respect to our interest—and the tongues of wicked men let loose upon us, at a time when our whole fam∣ily was dispersed—a great number of emissaries en∣deavoring to prevent christian charity from being bestowed upon us; certainly those who are truly sensible of these things, must be led to adore the good hand of God upon me, that I have not been cast down nor discouraged, but that I endur∣ed these trials with patience and have now reason to expect they will all work for my spiritual good.</P>
<P>With humility, therefore, I desire the follow∣ing address, together with the above narrative, might be printed (as soon as may be) after my decease, not having been able to rise out of my chair, nor get out of my bed, for several months past, without assistance; and having no expectation of seeing my relations in this world, I am there∣fore desirous of calling upon my friends, and oth∣ers, who read this narrative.—All you that are young, and in the bloom of life, more especially; and my prayer to God is, that my experience, my sickness, and my sufferings, may have a proper ef∣fect upon your minds</P>
<P>And now dear reader, whoever you be, of what ever age, in whatever situation, whether you be a
<PB N="7" REF="031269_0006_0FEBF06BC5691608"/>familiar acquaintance of mine, or not so, I hum∣bly intreat you to see to it, that your peace is made with God. Let not the solemn truth if you being unable to change your own hearts, pre∣vent you from rational and laborious attempts to call upon the Almighty God, for the gift of his holy Spirit to accompany the means of salvation until you come to live in actual and daily prepara∣tion for death and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernity.</P>
<P>I rejoice to leave many of my relations abound∣ing in the good things of this life, who have been very kind to me in my adversity, for which I de∣sire God to reward them with spiritual blessings.— May those who are poor in this world, see to it above all things, that they become rich towards God in good works: For the poor may do honor to the christian religion, by cultivating all the graces of divine Spirit, as well as the rich, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir deeds of charity.</P>
<P>I would further exhort all necessitous persons, in a particular manner, not to neglect every law∣ful endeavor to support themselves by their own in∣dustry; but, if after all their endeavors, they should still remain necessitous, let them not be ashamed to make known their wants to those who are lib∣erally and charitably disposed — for I have found relief from such christian benevolence in times of extremity, while our family was dispersed. Re∣member that a graceful &amp; a becoming deportment, with a real disposition to hearken to the advice of your best friends, is necessary in such cases.</P>
<P>My unusual afflictions have been a profitable school to me, and I wish the remembrance of them may be so to many of my readers; for we must all appear before the bar of an all perfect sovereign, to be judged according to our works: Then, if we have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, vis∣ited
<PB N="8" REF="031269_0007_0FEBF06DD93794E8"/>the sick, and those that are in prisons; and if we have been careful to entertain strangers for Christ's sake, we shall meet with an open and a∣bundant admittance into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I once more exhort you that are parents, to cultivate the principles of humanity and piety in the tender minds of your children, towards the poor and the needy—and to put the most favorable construction on the means and occasions of poverty and wretchedness among your acquaintance, and especially among your relations; for the heart of man is apt to be misled in childhood, by the example of wicked parents, who are uncharitable and unkind.</P>
<P>Being desirous of dying in peace with all men, I heartily forgive and ask the forgiveness of all that are concerned among my acquaintance; and now I commit myself to God, hoping that he will provide for my children, whom I leave with my husband, and with those who have the imme∣diate care of them, by his directions, under the protection of God's grace.</P>
<P>Such of my children as are able to read this nar∣rative, and remember their Creator in the days their youth; may they receive instruction from him who took little children in his arms to bless them.</P>
<P>My brethren and sisters of this church will re∣ceive my last and best wishes, that God would sanctify repeated instances of mortality among us, and especially the death of our late Pastor —for he had done his work, and finished his course among us; and while I myself expect soon to follow him, may those who survive me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry fervently to the God of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> revival of religion in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<DIV1 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD>Living Testimony of <HI>AMOS TAYLOR,</HI> of Reading, in respect to the foregoing Narrative.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is to testify, in the solemn fear of Almigh∣ty God, that some time in the month of Jan∣uary, 1793, my tender and affectionate wife inti∣mated a strong desire that I would write a small narrative of her christian experience, together with an address to all her friends and acquaint∣ance; in which I endeavored to answer her mind, as fully as if she had been able to write herself.</P>
<P>She did not expect to live, at that time, and was earnestly importunate with me, that I should do my endeavor to see that the same was sent to the press, in her name, as soon as might be after her death.</P>
<P>It pleased God however, to continue her life until the 19th of May, 1794, when she died with the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rid fever, about one fortnight after she was put to bed of a living child, which is now a∣live and well.— Her deportment, in her last sick∣ness, was as became her profession. she appeared to be wholly resigned to the will of God, and to have the terrors of death removed.</P>
<P>I further testify, that in her life time, she was always so far from murmuring and repining at any adverse dispensation of divine Providence, that she usually calmed my temper, as an happy instru∣ment in the hand of God, to a becoming resigna∣tion.</P>
<P>She oftentimes expressed, and of late years
<PB N="10" REF="031269_0009_0FEBF074831FE958"/>more than ever, an earnest desire to see professors of religion acquaint themselves more with the ex∣ercise of one another's minds in spiritual things. She had a great value for the privileges of private conferences, and family meetings, so called.</P>
<P>She wished to see a greater freedom among chris∣tians, in their enquiry into one another's welfare. She frequently intimated the great necessity of being on our own watch, lest we should go astray. She was sensible of her own imperfections, and ready to forgive private injuries. She was very liberal, in the latter part of her life, towards pro∣fessors of other denominations; although in her younger years she had imbibed a certain degree of rigidness and uncharitableness towards those who were not of her sentiments.</P>
<P>She highly valued the privilege of a gospel min∣istry, although deprived, a great part of her time, for several years together, from attending to the word preached; which was, to her, grief un∣feigned, although accompanied with a resignation to the divine will.</P>
<P>May her example, wherever she followed Christ, be imitated by all professors of religion, and may her address, which now speaks, while she is gone to receive her reward, be the mean of quickening all to a becoming deportment, through our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST.</P>
