<P>THE Lord JESUS CHRIST, who is in the bosom of the Father, (<HI>Job.</HI> 1.18.) was fully acquainted as <HI>God,</HI> with all his Decrees &amp; Counsels, being one with him in them, (<HI>Job.</HI> 10.30.) Yet as <HI>Man</HI> did not know them: <HI>But of that day &amp; that hour, knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father,</HI> Mark 13.32. Having received the Revelation contained in this Book from the Father, communicateth it by his Angel to his Apostle <HI>John,</HI> to be committed to wri∣ting

(And it is observed by One, that as <HI>Moses</HI> the Favou∣rite Prophet began the Scriptures, so <HI>John</HI> the Favourite Apostile finisheth them.)

For the Apostle's first direction was to write &amp; send to the Churches. <HI>Chao.</HI> 1.<HI>v.</HI> 11. And it is ma∣nifest from diverse expressions in the <HI>Epistles,</HI> &amp; from the conclusion of every one of 'em, that there was respect had to the Churches in their contents; viz <HI>He that hath an ear, let him hear when tha Spirit saith unto the Churches</HI>—And indeed in them instruction, incourage∣ment &amp; warning, is given to the Churches in all succeeding ages.

GOD and JESUS CHRIST somewhat pro∣miscously in the following discourse.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Jesus Christ takes notice of &amp; menti∣ons several things which were good and praise∣worthy</HI>: But faulteth them in the Text, which we shall now consider only as it hath respect to the Church of <HI>Ephesus.</HI> And in it we may observe,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>The Introduction, Nevertheless, i.e.</HI> Not∣withstanding those good things which are in thee, which I do observe &amp; have mention'd to thy praise; I am not satisfi'd with thee.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>But I have against thee</HI>; as it is in the Original, <HI>i. e.</HI> To accuse thee of &amp; for which I am offended with thee; there seems to be <HI>Moises</HI> in the word, (somewhat) put in by the Translators, <HI>i. e.</HI> the thing is grievous &amp; I am very angry with thee; as the severi∣ty of the Punishment threatned on impeni∣tence intimateth, viz. <HI>And will remove thy Can∣dlestick, &amp;c.</HI> I will Un-church thee, I will remove the Gospel and the Privileges of a Church from thee, I will destroy thee from being a Church.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>The fault or ground of the Offence,</HI> viz. <HI>Because thou hast left thy first love,</HI> Thou art waxen cold and remiss in thy Love to God &amp; one another, thy former Zeal &amp; warmth in Religion is lost or left.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003473_0004_0FF8490DD70065B0"/>DOCT. <HI>Though there may be good things in Churches; yet if they have left their First Love, Jesus Chirst is Offended with them.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Prop. II.</HI> Jesus Christ is offended with them when it is so.]</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>Churches may have left their First Love, tho' there are good things among them.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Love is the great thing that God requireth of the Children of men.</HI> In Love to God is summ'd up all the Duty that we owe to him. <HI>This is the first &amp; great Commandment, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God With All thy heart &amp; with all thy soul &amp; with all thy mind.</HI> And to love our Nei'bour is the sum of the Second Table of the Law. <HI>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy nei'bour as thy self.</HI> Mat. 22.37, 38. In loving our Nei'bour is virtually contain'd all the duty's we owe him, &amp; therein we ful∣fil the Law relating to him. <HI>For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law For this thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other Command∣ment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy nei'bour as thy self. Love worketh no ill to his nei'bour, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law,</HI> Rom 13, 8—Love to

our Nei'bor disposeth us to wish well to him, to discharge all duty's towards him with a respect to his good, and witholdeth us from doing evil to him. God is good infinitely so, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106 1. and therefore <HI>Maxime am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>,</HI> most Lovely. The loving God with all the heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is the going out of the Soul to∣ward God as the chief good , or the feeling of the Soul in the 1 king of him as such.

And when God Commandeth (as <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.3.) <HI>Thou shalt have no other gods before me</HI>: He requireth this <HI>Su∣preme Love.</HI> And he often expresly &amp; ex∣plicitly insisted upon it with his People of old. Deut. 6.4.5. <HI>Hear O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, &amp; with all thy soul, &amp; with all thy might.</HI> So <HI>Deut.</HI> 10.12. And this is what all Churches &amp; People prosess to do, when they take God to be their God upon his offer in his word. It is on no other or lower terms, that he offereth Himself to any to be their God to protect and bless them.
<PB N="7" REF="003473_0005_0FF8490F5EEFCCC0"/>
Deut. 11.13,—<HI>And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God &amp; to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, That I will give you the rain, &amp;c.</HI> So <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.15.—And Josh 23.11, 12. <HI>Take Good heed therefore unto your selves, that you love the Lord your God. Else if you do in any wise go back, &amp;c.</HI> And Jesus Christ doth particularly inform us, that unless we love him above all, we cannot be his Disciples, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.26.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By the first love of Churches, may be understood that love which was in them at first</HI>: When their Members first turned from their Idols &amp; evil Ways unto the Living God, &amp; were formed into Churches for the carrying on of the Pub∣lick Worship of God &amp; exercising Commu∣nion among themselves: The love of their Espousals when they first came into Cove∣nant-relation with God, were married to him, <HI>Fer.</HI> 3.14. When persons are first Converted, they are usually greatly Affected with the goodness of God, Then they are full of love to him &amp; zeal &amp; life in his ways, &amp; very tender of his glory. And Societies made up generally of such, will be warm &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us for God, &amp; careful to keep themselves holy &amp; pure. <HI>Is∣rael's</HI> warm affection in the day of their Espou∣sals is remembred <HI>Jer.</HI> 2 2 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. in the beginning of the Christian Church, they did with great
<PB N="8" REF="003473_0006_0FF84910E609F5F8"/>
unity stedfastness &amp; alacrity, attend upon the Worship of God; they cheerfully denied themselves, &amp; parted with their worldly Possessions to relieve the Needy &amp; support Reli∣gion, therein shewing their great warmth of Love to God &amp; one another. <HI>Act.</HI> 2.42,—<HI>And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine &amp; Fellowship, &amp; in breaking of Bread, &amp; in Pray∣ers; And all that believed were together, &amp; had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods &amp; parted them to all men, as every man has need, &amp;c.</HI> And the <HI>Ephesians</HI> when they first received the Gospel, gave great testimony by their words &amp; actions, of their love to God &amp; abhorrence of the Sins they had liv'd in. The costly Sacrifice they made of their Magical Books was a notable evidence of their Zeal &amp; Warmth in Religion, <HI>Act.</HI> 19.18, 19. Or by <HI>Churches first love,</HI> may be understood <HI>their for∣mer love</HI>; the love that was in them here-to-fore, that was discover'd by their Members in times past; the word translated <HI>First,</HI> is some∣times rendred <HI>Former.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>When may Churches be said to have left their first or former love</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Answ. In gen.</HI> When the effects &amp; fruits of love are decreased, &amp; the things that manifest a want of love, or a decay in it, prevail and abound among them. Love to God is the spring of Obedience; where that is servent,
<PB N="9" REF="003473_0006_0FF84910E609F5F8"/>
men will be fruitful in good works, &amp; a slack∣ness in Obedience, argues a languishing love.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>When they generally favour of Vanity, World∣liness, Pride, &amp; discover a forgetfulness of God &amp; an unconcernedness about Religion &amp; his Glory.</HI> Such things shew the Heart to be departed from God. Love is of an assimilating nature. Love to God disposeth persons to be like him, to be holy because he is so. To love God, saith one, is to be godly, &amp; have the mind after a fort Deified. 1. Job. 4.7. <HI>And every one that lov∣eth is born of God, &amp;c.</HI> He hath received an im∣pression of the Divine Image. That discovery of the Excellencies of God that draws forth this love to him, is transforming. 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>—Are changed into the same image.</HI> Such a person is made to partake of the Divine Nature, as the Apostle speaks, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. And therefore will favour the things that be of God. <HI>Si ter∣ram ama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> terra es, si Deum amas quidni diet∣rem Deus es. Aug.</HI> It Also disposeth to Humility. The discovery of God's Excellencies takes down all high tho'ts of themselves. <HI>Job.</HI> 42.5, 6. Love to God also disposeth persons to have him much in their tho'ts. The Spouse is full of discourse about her Beloved, <HI>Cant. per tot.</HI> It also disposeth persons to be concern'd for the interest of Religion &amp; tender of God's glory. But when such things as are contrary to the
<PB N="10" REF="003473_0007_0FF8491270D33CB0"/>
loving of God, <HI>viz.</HI> such as have been before mentioned, are increased in Churches, they manifest that Love is decayed in them, their former love is left.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When a light Esteem of God's Word &amp; Or∣dinances prevails in them, &amp; slackness &amp; care∣lessness in attending the Worship of God &amp; the duties of Religion</HI> Love to God will make persons prize his Word very highly. The Psalmist saith, <HI>I love thy commandments above gold, &amp;c.</HI> Ps. 119.127. <HI>Job</HI> saith, <HI>I have esteemed the words of his mouth, more than my necessary food,</HI> Job. 23.12. It will make persons esteem God's Ordinances above worldly Advantages. Psal. 84.10. <HI>I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness,</HI> And it will make persons account the place of Publick Worship very amiable, &amp; long for opportunities of Communion with God there, &amp; rejoice when they present, Psal. 84.1, 2. <HI>How amiable are thy Tavernacles, O Lord of hasts! My soul longeth, yea, even sainteth for the Courts of the Lord, &amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Psal.</HI> 122.1. But when the Word and Ordinances of God are for light by, &amp; opportunities to Worship God &amp; discharge the Duties of Religion are with reluctance &amp; displeasure Entertained, &amp; with weariness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as a Burden &amp; Task, Edifying Exercise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>▪ others unsteadily, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp; formally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="11" REF="003473_0007_0FF8491270D33CB0"/>
among them, 'tis manifest Love is wanting; and the prevailing of these things, shew their former Love is left.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When there is not in them that Warmth &amp; Zeal in Testifying against Sin, that there hath been.</HI> When Prophane and Immoral Practices, are more Conniv'd at &amp; Indulg'd, either, that such kinds of Sin as were formerly &amp; justly blam'd, are not taken notice of, or such degrees of Sin as were rightly accounted Scandalous, are o∣verlook'd; when a <HI>Gallio-like-spirit,</HI> with res∣pect to such things generally prevaileth (ex∣cept where men have been Personally pro∣voked) and each one in their places are loth to be disquieted &amp; at the trouble of opposing &amp; suppressing Sin, or to Expose themselves any ways to do it; but chuse to sit still &amp; let Iniquity pass, this shews they have left their Former Love.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When a Backwardness and Penuriousness in Supporting and Promoting of Religion, doth gene∣rally prevail among them.</HI> When they account the necessary Supports of Religion a burden, &amp; are loth to be at the Cost. Love to God disposeth persons to be Liberal towards him, &amp; not think much of Charge to promote his Honour; and also to be Charitable to the Needy, especially his. But where a Selfish, Covetous spirit and Love of this world pre∣vails, there the love of God decayeth. The
<PB N="12" REF="003473_0008_0FF84915F9CC3038"/>
Covetous person is in this respect an Idolater, because he maketh his worldly Possessions the object of that Love which is due only to God, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.5. An inordinate Love to the World, is inconsistent with the Love of God; they can't be together, <HI>Ye cannot serve God &amp; Mammon,</HI> Mat. 6.24. <HI>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</HI> 1 Job. 2.15.</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>When Profaneness &amp; Immorality increase &amp; prevail among them.</HI> When the Name of God &amp; his Ordinances are less Reverenced; when disregard to the Sabbath, Disobedience, Intem∣perance, Uncleanness, Unrighteousness. False∣ness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> prevail &amp; increase, there the love of God decayeth. Love disposeth to Obey, &amp; Obedience is a fruit &amp; evidence of it Job. 14.21. <HI>He that hath my commandments &amp; keepeth them he it is that loveth me But whose keepeth his word in him verify is the love of God perfected</HI> 1 Job. 2.5.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>When there are Contentions, Envyings, Evil speakings,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>prevailing among them.</HI> Such things shew a want of love one to another, or a decay in it; and so a decay in love to God likewise. Love to God is vainly pretended, by them that hate their nei'bours 1 Job. 4.20 <HI>If a man say I love God, &amp; hateth his brother, he is a liar, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This may be, Churches may have lost their first love, tho' there are good things among them.</HI> This is implied in the Text, and was the case of the Church of <HI>Ephesus.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="13" REF="003473_0008_0FF84915F9CC3038"/>(I) <HI>This may be the state of Churches in gene∣ral; tho' there may be some lively Christians in them, that are full of love to &amp; zeal for God, and stedfast in his Covenant.</HI> Thus in <HI>Elijah's</HI> time, the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were generally and he seems to think Universally Apostalized and turned to Idolatry; Yet God telleth him, <HI>I have left me Seven thousand in Israel,</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 19.14, 18. So in <HI>Ezekiel's</HI> time they were ge∣nerally Corrupt, Yet there were some that <HI>sighed &amp; cried for all the abominations that were done,</HI> &amp; had a mark set upon them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9 4 So in the Church of <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> when they were generally Corrupt and had only a Name that they lived, Yet there were some holy persons among'em <HI>Thou hast a few names, even in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dis that have not defiled their garments,</HI> Rev. 3 1, 4.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>This may be the state of Churches, where there are some good things &amp; practises,</HI> i. e. <HI>that are according to the Word of God.</HI> This, as it seems, was the state of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church in <HI>Abijah's</HI> Reign; his heart was not perfect; There was Idolatry and Sodomy practised &amp; tolerated. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 14.22,— &amp; <HI>Chap.</HI> 15.3, 12. Yet they kept up the External Worship of God according to his Law. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 13.10, 11. So in the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel's</HI> time, they shew'd an Outward respect to God and his Prophet, but their heart went after their Covetousness, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.31. Churches may retain an Ortho∣dox
<PB N="14" REF="003473_0009_0FF8491A82B42768"/>
Consession of Faith, they may have a Re∣gular Ministry, the Publick Worship may be kept up &amp; the Sacraments may be duly Admi∣ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tred, they may reject some Errors, &amp; bear Testimony against some Sins &amp; yet it may be manifest form the foregoing &amp; such like <HI>things,</HI> that they have left their <HI>first</HI> or <HI>former love.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Inconsistency in the things; tho' Love be languish'd, it don't argue that there is nothing good among such a People: Nor doth the being of many such good things ar∣gue, that such a People retain their <HI>first love.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing in the Constitution of such Societies, that doth secure them from losing their first Love, nor indeed from total Apostasy. Grace is not Hereditary. Tho' Churches may be at first constituted of such as are faithful in Christ Jesus, as the Apostle stileth the <HI>Ephesians, Eph.</HI> 1.1. Yet the next Generation may be Hypocrites or Apostales. The Generation succeeding <HI>Joshua &amp; the El∣ders,</HI> forsook the Lord God of their Fathers, and served <HI>Baal</HI> &amp; <HI>Ashtaroth, Judg.</HI> 2.10, 12. There is nothing in the Covenant God stands related to them in, to Secure them; No ab∣solute Promises made to particular Churches, that they shall not totally and finally Aposta∣lize, as there are to particular Saints.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>JESUS CHRIST is Offended with them when it is so; i. e.</HI> when they have
<PB N="15" REF="003473_0009_0FF8491A82B42768"/>
left their first Love; though there are good things still among them, these will not attone or excuse for the want of Love, as our Savi∣our signifies to the Pharisees. <HI>Luk</HI> 11.42. <HI>But we unto you Pharisees, for ye tithe, mint and rue, and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment &amp; the love of God. These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</HI> It was very Offensive in this Church, The Threatning shews great displeasure; <HI>Or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candlestick out of its place, except thou repent,</HI> Context <HI>v</HI> 5.</P>
<P>There are several Reasons why GOD or JESUS CHRIST is Offended with Churches when it is so.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because 'tis very dishonouring to God, when Churches do leave their first or former Love to him, or decay in it.</HI> GOD is the only suitable Object of supream Love, He only being an absolute &amp; an infinite Good, <HI>There is none good but one, that is God,</HI> Mat 19.17. And to love the Lord our God with all the heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is the proper and commanded Acknowlegement of his Excellency &amp; Goodness. Such a love to God puts the Crown on his head (if we may, so speak.) It proclaims him the best good, Exalteth him above all. And tho' in∣deed there cannot be in a Creature, love to God, proportioned &amp; adequate to the Good∣ness &amp; Worthiness of the Object; yet if it be
<PB N="16" REF="003473_0010_0FF8491CB26DB6B8"/>
proportioned to the Powers &amp; Capacities of the Agent, it gives great glory to him. And there are the same Reasons always remaining and binding persons thus to Praise the Lord. What reason there ever was for any person to love God with all their hearts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is to continue their love to him, in the same degree from day to day and for ever. He is immutably good, his Excellencies do not de∣cay his Beauties do not wither. And when persons leave their love to him or decay in it, they treat him, as tho' either it was through Mistake they set their love upon him, and that he was not a Being of such Worth as they did expect he had been; or that if he was so, yet now those Excellencies were de∣cayed or lost; Either of which is dishonour∣ing to God and so offensive.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because they who do so, give God's glory to some other.</HI> They who do not set their chief Love upon God, place it on something else. All have their Treasure their chief good. Some are lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.4. Some bestow that love which is God's due, on their Wealth, and therein are guilty of Idolatry, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.5. The god of Epicures is their belly, <ABBR><HI>Phil.</HI></ABBR> 3.19. And this is offensive to God, who will not endure his glory should be given to another, nor his praise to any creature.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="17" REF="003473_0010_0FF8491CB26DB6B8"/>
3. <HI>Because it is a transgression of his Command and Law.</HI> God's Law extends to the inner man; And God who is a Spirit and seeth the actions of the Soul as well as those of the Body, doth especially insist upon the inner man's being in subjection to him. Prov. 23.26. <HI>My Son, give me thy heart, &amp;c.</HI> And, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. That they who leave their love to God, or decay in it, they transgress the Law; and this being in a main point, yea the very sum of all it is a virtual transgression of the whole Law, &amp; justly &amp; greatly offensive to God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Because in withdrawing their Affections from God, they deal Perfidiously with him.</HI> He Requireth and Commandeth that men love him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that they cleave to him. He doth not offer himself to any to be their God, nor doth he offer to take any to be his People upon any other Terms, than that, They love him with all their heart, &amp;c. and be his, wholly his, and his for ever. Deut. 11.22. <HI>For if ye shall diligently keep all these com∣mandments which I command you to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him.</HI> And hence they who take God to be their God, they do Engage this, if they take him as he offereth himself: And when they do leave or decay in their love to God, they deal deceitfully &amp; falsly in
<PB N="18" REF="003473_0011_0FF8491E4143D270"/>
his Covenant. This is the Male in the Flock, which when persons have Vowed, it is persi∣dious to withold, and turn God off with that which compared therewith, is but mean; yea, without this is bat a corrupt thing. One faith, <Q>External Worship without the Internal, is little better than Mockery and a solemn Affronting the Divine Majesty.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Improvement</HI> USE, I. For INFORMATION.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hence we may learn that JESUS CHRIST doth Observe us in these Churches.</HI> He knoweth our Works, he taketh notice of our Frames, he seeth where Love is decayed and Luke∣warmness possesseth us, he walketh among the Candlesticks, and observeth both Ministers and People, tho' they, perhaps many of them, may have reason to say, as <HI>Hagar,</HI> Gen. 16.13. <HI>Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence we must expect no other, but that JESUS CHRIST is Offended with us in these Churches and in this Government, if we have left our first Love</HI>: And if the Effects of Love that were formerly found with us are decayed, and the things shewing the want of Love are increased among us, they shew it is so. Tho' these Churches were not constituted of Mem∣bers newly Converted from Heathensm; yet they were the first Churches set up in a Hea∣thenish
<PB N="19" REF="003473_0011_0FF8491E4143D270"/>
Land, They were the Candlesticks in which the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ first shined in this part of the Earth, which before for Ages unknown had been one of the dark places of it, full of the habitations of Cruelty. The setting up of these Churches, was the day of the Espousal of this Land. And the first Ministers &amp; Members of these Churches, were many of them, such as had passed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o' the fire of Persecution, and were purified thereby; The tenderness of their Consciences occasion'd them to repair hither. And they were persons full of Zeal and Warmth in Religion and Concern for God's Glory; and gave great Evidence of it, in leaving a pleasant &amp; plentiful Land, (where some of them had fair Estates and good Friends, and might have lived in Ease and Fulness, and have hoped for Honour &amp; Pre∣ferment, could they have complied with the Times,) and many worldly Advantages, Ex∣posing themselves to the Dangers of a vast Ocean, the hardships &amp; miseries of a Wilder∣ness, very destitute then of the Comforts of Life, and full of bloody &amp; deceitful Heathen; Principally to enjoy the Gospel in the purity of its institutions. And our falling from the Zeal &amp; Love that was in the first Founders of these Churches, may be justly Charged upon us as leaving our first Love. Though
<PB N="20" REF="003473_0012_0FF84921492F8C18"/>
there may be good things among us, they will not attone for the decay of Love. The Spi∣rit speaketh to <HI>these Churches,</HI> as well as to Ephesus in this Epistle, and letteth us know, that the decay of Love is offensive to God.</P>
<P>USE, II. Of EXAMINATION.</P>
<P><HI>Let us Examine and Enquire, Whether it be not so with us, that our Love is decayed, and the tokens of it apparent?</HI> Don't the generality of Professors among us favour of Vanity, Worldliness, Pride, and discover great Un∣thoughtfulness of God? How little of that Seriousness, Humility and Heavenly-minded∣ness, that was in some of our Predecessors? They favoured the things that be of God, were full of Religion in their Discourses, whereby they Edified one another. They be∣haved themselves as Strangers &amp; Pilgrims on the Earth, hat were seeking a better Country, that is an Heavenly. Their Solicitude was not so much where they might get most and best Land, but to enjoy the Worship and Or∣dinances of God and an Edifying Ministry. But, alas now! Is not the gold become dim? Do not the generality of Professors favour of Earth? Their Discourses are Vain &amp; Worldly, seldom any thing of Religion in them, or any thing tending to Edifie them as Christians.
<PB N="21" REF="003473_0012_0FF84921492F8C18"/>
Do they not discover that their main Thoughtfulness is about this World? what they shall Eat and Drink and how they shall get Estates; and that they are but little thoughtful of Eternity, or concerned about Securing the Kingdom of Heaven, which should be the first sought, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.33. Is not the Word of God set light by? Is there not a great prevailing of Ignorance in spiritual things? Is not the Bible grown into much dis∣use, and but little profit to some that they have it in their own Languange? Are there not many of good Natural Abilities, that are grosly Ignorant, even in the great &amp; necessa∣ry Things of Religion? The Country im∣proveth in Knowlege and Skill in Worldly business, but in Religious Knowlege, doth it not manifestly decay? How little ambition doth there seem to be or pairs, to be know∣ing in Religion? Do not many seem to be for so much Religion only as will answer their Carnal ends? They will do something in it that they may not lose their interest with the Religious; but will not be Strict, Thorough &amp; Zealous, left they should break with the Carnal sort. Are there not many that Neglect the Worship of God, or are Un∣steady in it, in Publick in Families, in Secret, and more that perform it in a formal heart∣less manner? Don't many pursue and possess
<PB N="22" REF="003473_0013_0FF84924D6F9F540"/>
the World as the main thing, and attend Re∣ligion as tho' they attended it not; having a form of Godliness, but denying the Power of it? 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.5. Do not many discover a very light regard to Religion and the Worship &amp; Ordinances of God, in the setling their abodes? The Concern is not as heretofore to accom∣modate themselves as to the Worship of God, &amp; get under an Edifying Ministry; but where they can have most Land, and be under best advantages to get Money; tho' it lay them under never so great disadvantages as to Re∣ligion and the good of their Souls.</P>
<P>Is there not much Iniquity prevailing and are not the generality of Professors easie under it? They can hear men Curse and Swear, take the Name of God in vain, use filthy Dis∣course, can see Drunkenness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it is no burden or grief to them, as it was to him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.21. Such filthy Conversation from day to day, is no exercise or vexation to their Souls, as 'twas to his, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.7.8. They have no horror takes hold of them because of the wicked that forsake Gods Law. But <HI>Gallio∣like</HI> they care for none of these things. They pretend, it may be, that each one must look to themselves, 'tis none of their business, or that they be not Grand-jury-men: They nei∣ther regard the personal good of their Nei'∣bour, tho' there be a plain Command for it.
<PB N="23" REF="003473_0013_0FF84924D6F9F540"/>
Lev. 19 17 <HI>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy hear: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy Nei'∣bour, and not suffer Sin upon him.</HI> (How many will Backbite, and tell others Faults, &amp; Blast their Names, but a faithful dealing out of Love, to do them good, how little of it?) Nor are they concerned for the Publick, lest that should suffer thro' Sins being tolerated. And if any are Conscientious to deal with Sinners, and testify against Sin; are not they who are dealt with and others also, apt to Reproach 'em as Medling, Precise, Malicious? Do they not hate him that Rebuketh in the Gate? <HI>Amos.</HI> 5.10. Are there not some Professors who will resent it, if any speak slightly of themselves, or families, that can hear the Churches they belong to, and the Religion they Profess, Reproached &amp; Reviled, and the God they own Dishonoured, and his Name taken in Vain, and not be offended at it, yea Caress them that do it?</P>
<P>Is it not manifest that Covetousness doth prevail, and shew it self in a backwardness to be at the Cost of Religion, and those Publick things that tend to Promote it; a Penurious∣ness towards them? Our Fathers devised liberal Things in their Troubles, they provi∣ded for the Support of Religion for the time to come, there were liberal Donations to Churches, and to Schools, from particular
<PB N="24" REF="003473_0014_0FF849280AAE7770"/>
Persons, but how little do they of the present Generation that are reaping the benefit of those things, emulate the generosity of their Predecessors? Tho' the Country be increased greatly in Wealth, as the buildings and living of People generally shew; yet how rare are such Instances of Liberality now? (Though they are needed still, and would greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end to the advancement of Religion and Learning among us.) Yea are there not many full of Objections against and murmurings at, the necessary Annual Expence for the Support of Publick and Religious things? And doth not Prophaness and Immorality, increase among us? Doth not Iniquity abound? which is an evidence of Love is waxing Cold and also a cause of it. <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.12. For evil Communi∣cation is Contagious, one Sinner destroyeth much good. Do not Drunkenness and Un∣cleanness, those two Vices which are said to take away the heart, greatly prevail? Hos 4.11. <HI>Whoredom and Wine, and new Wine take away the Heart.</HI></P>
<P>And is there not abundance of Unrighteous∣ness &amp; Unmercifulness among us? Injustice in Prices, delays and dishonesty in Payments, Deceit, Falseness, and Unfaithfulness in Bar∣gains, Contracts and Betrustments, griping Usary, Evading and Baffling the Laws made for the Security of men form that Oppression?

And taking advantage of any Cir∣cumstantial defects in Ancient doings, whereby not exactly or compleatly they were rendred Legal, to overthrow and disanul them, to the very great damage of others, altho' they were truly &amp; honestly done in that day.</P>
<P>And doth not Pride greatly prevail, &amp; dis∣cover it self many ways among us? In Peo∣ple's going beyond their Means? in their Haughtiness &amp; Untractableness, in Families, in Churches, and in the Common-wealth? &amp; in the grievous Contentions that are among us which generally spring from Pride, &amp; are continued by it?

And how sad is it that there is so much Contention about things that concern Religion, particu∣larly about Setting of Meeting Houses, and Setling of Ministers?

<P>That tho' there are good things still a∣mong us, &amp; we hope many Names that have not defiled themselves; yet is it not manifest from the above-mentioned &amp; such like things, that we have very much left our First Love?

And he hath made this Wilderness a fruitful Land to you, and hath caused you to eat of the increase of the Field, of the fat of kidneys of Wheat, &amp; of the in∣crease of the Herds and of the Flocks; Yea, He hath made you plenteous in good things, and hath blessed you that you are greatly in∣creased, &amp; hath been as a wall of fire about you, &amp; defended you on every side; and his good∣ness is very great to you even to this day, You have your Judges as at the first &amp; your Counsellors as at the beginning; <HI>i. e.</HI> They are of your Brethren chosen by your selves; You injoy your Privileges Civil &amp; Sacred, nothwith∣standing the many indeavours there have been, by Your Enemies, to deprive you of them.

If you go on to withdraw your hearts &amp; love from him, he will remove your Candlesticks; he will take away the Privileges &amp; Being of a Church from you. There needs no other Epistle from heaven to assure you of this, than that where∣in the Text is, <HI>He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.</HI> Ver. 5. <HI>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, &amp; will remove thy candle∣stick out of his place, except thou repent.</HI></P>

that we had left our first Love, and were in danger of God's Wrath &amp; Judgments: Yet we don't see but that we have been of late &amp; are at present, as Prosperous as ever, There is Peace &amp; Plenty, &amp; the Country flourisheth.</P>
<P>It was foretold, there would be in the last days Scoffers, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.3. God hath not been wont speedily to Execute his Threatnings, but to wait &amp; give opportunity for a Reformati∣on.
