<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM CXLVII. v. 14.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>He maketh Peace in thy Borders, and filleth Thee with the Flower of Wheat.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A LONG, dangerous, and expensive War now closes with an honorable Peace; and for this we are ordered to a most reasonable, pious Duty, to return our solemn Thanks to that great and good GOD, who hath taught our Hands to war and our Fin∣gers to fight so very successfully. 'Tis this at last that com∣pletes our Joy by stopping the further Progress of War with her cruel and inseparable Attendants, Misery and Horror: For Conquerors themselves must own it is ever accompanied by those ghastly Furies: The finest and most brilliant Victories cost many Tears: The most blooming and verdant Laurels are ever stain'd with Blood, and even in the Day of Triumph the Cries of Bitterness and Sorrow mix themselves with the Shouts of Joy and Gladness. We may with Truth say, we have had enough of Victory, we have had enough of military Glory, and the Trophies and the Spoils of War; or rather, enough of human Blood has been pour'd upon the Earth even to glut
<PB N="6" REF="009409_0005_0F74046047CEC780"/>
the ravenous Jaws of Death: We have had enough of that Success which cannot be enjoy'd but at the Expence of the Lives of our Fellow-Creatures, and those oft the bravest and the best of Men. Therefore let us with Hearts unfeign'd and Gratitude sincere return our Thanks to Almighty GOD for re∣storing Peace to these Dominions, Security to Trade and Com∣merce, and Stability to our Religion and Church.</P>
<P>I shall not here take up your time in giving you a Detail of the many and great Advantages we have gain'd, the important Acquisitions made, or the signal Victories obtain'd by Sea and Land in the Course of this War, tho' such indeed might be entertaining, and agreable enough, but better seen in the An∣nals of the times, and I think with much more propriety read there than heard here. I shall therefore beg your Attention to what more nearly concerns you not only as a Community but as Individuals, and while I endeavour to shew you what good Use you shou'd make of these peaceable Times, I conceive I shall be offering some Things worthy your Consideration and which, if regarded, may prove of solid and lasting Benefit to you all.</P>
<P>The first Thing that will naturally present itself to us in our reflecting upon the happy Consequences resulting from the Blessing now given us, is the Security of our Civil Liberty, a Happiness we justly glory in; For Britons have preserv'd it pure and uncorrupted thro' all the Struggles of Ambition and the most dangerous Attacks of Power: They have set the World a fair Example that the highest Ambition of Princes shou'd be
<PB N="7" REF="009409_0006_0F740460E03DF3B8"/>
to govern a free People, and that no People can be great or happy but such as are so; whilst other Nations have bow'd their Necks to the Yoke of Power and have basely given up this indisputable Right of Man deriv'd to Him from the first Law of Nature, and daily feel that Misery, which ever waits on Slaves. Oh Liberty! Thou art the Author of every good and perfect Gift, the inexhaustible Fountain, from whence all Blessings flow. Without Thee, what avails the Sweetness of Climate, or the most delightful Situation in the World? what avail all the Riches of Nature, the various Production of the Earth, the Mine bringing forth a thousand Treasures, the Olive and the Vine blooming upon the Mountains, if Tyranny usurps the happy Plains, and proud Oppression deforms the gay-smiling face of Nature.</P>
<P>Here the feeling Heart will naturally reflect on and lament the Fate of those who are doom'd to Slavery, eternal Slavery. Unhappy Creatures destin'd to submit to it, and perhaps no less so are those Countries which are oblig'd to practise it! Respecting this particular, and the manner in which it is Here conducted, it may be said it loses much of it's Horror, when compar'd with that of other Places. This perhaps is true, and I am likewise fully persuaded, that in some of those Families which properly respect Humanity, the State of Servitude ap∣proaches to the Condition of an easy Dependance, and thro' the Consideration and mildness of the Master the very Name of Slave is oft forgotten. But of these how few! Whilst the grasping Avarice of some, the unfeeling hard-heartedness, the very monstrous Disposition of others, which seems to delight
<PB N="8" REF="009409_0007_0F7404618DB48F68"/>
in acts of Cruelty, are known to be exercised daily in producing such Scenes of Misery and Wretchedness, as cannot but be in the highest Degree shocking to those, who know how to think properly of the Condition of Human Nature.</P>
<P>But to return from this Digression. Amiable as Liberty is, we must not persue it with blind Enthusiasm, and ungovern'd Zeal: We ought ever to remember, that this very precious Liberty is no other way to be secur'd to us, but by a dutiful Obedience to the Laws of our Country, and those our Supe∣riors, who have the Care of them. It is Folly, nay it is mad∣ness to suppose that that is true Liberty, which allows Men to act as they please, just as their inflam'd Brains, or wild Ima∣gination may urge them on: For soon, full soon by this means Liberty and public Safety wou'd become Enemies to each other, and fall together. When Liberty becomes so licentious, as to be free from the Check and Controul of just Laws, when it transgresses the Bounds prescrib'd by Nature, numerous and those the worst of Evils will immediately follow: Thus the River, which whilst confin'd in its proper Channel, carried Riches and Plenteousness along with it, gladdening the Lands it flow'd thro'; when it has burst thro' it's Barrier and over∣flow'd it's Banks, brings Terror and Desolation, the produce of the Earth, Cattle and Men are swept away, and lost in the De∣luge of it's Waters. Exactly similar is the Case, when Laws have not their proper Course, or not obey'd, as they ought to be, an Evil which tho' free Governments may be the aptest to fall into, is so great a one, that every true Friend to Liberty wou'd study to prevent it; for, as it has been well observ'd,
<PB N="9" REF="009409_0008_0F740462386D86B0"/>
there is no greater Tyranny upon the Face of the Earth, than that, where those who shou'd obey, are become our Masters: So very necessary is it that we shou'd faithfully adhere to that Principle I mention'd a little before, that we shou'd always be ready and willing to pay a cheerful Obedience to the Laws of our Country, to the King, and all that are put in Authority under Him, as this is not only acting according to the Precepts of our holy Religion, but the only way to secure to us the Blessings we are now so thankful for, and which you wou'd do well seriously to consider.</P>
<P>In Respect of our private Conduct, our just Sense of the many and various good Things of this Life which we enjoy, will best appear in the Use we shall make of them. In Consequence of a good Peace may naturally be expected a greater Plenty of every thing, and if you apply your Affluence and Abundance to the Purposes Providence design'd, they become real Blessings. Reason in this Case evidently points out to you, that you ought to have your Hearts open to acts of Charity and Humanity, and to hold in the greatest Abhorrence sordid Avarice. Above all things, not only that you may have it in your Power to do good to others, but on your own account, you shou'd be sober and moderate in your Pleasures, not dissolving in Luxury and Excess, things so extremely prejudicial to your own Health and Fortune, and which will infallibly involve your Families in Hardships and Misfortunes. And may it not here be ask'd, is there not already too great a Tendency amongst us to Ex∣travagance and Luxury? Some time ago was it not justly ob∣serv'd
<PB N="10" REF="009409_0009_0F7404633680BA70"/>
to you, and this by the Highest Authority here, that some of the Evils this Country labours under, were to be im∣puted to Excesses of this Nature? Supposing the common Articles of domestic Expense are not carried too far, why are you beholden to our Mother-Country for so many Things you wou'd do very well without, which the insignificant Pride of Dress, the empty Ambition of gaudy Furniture, or a splendid Equipage lead you into, and which most undoubtedly serve more for Ostentation and Parade, than any real Use or valuable Purpose in Life. You may imitate other Countries in their Virtues, if they have any, as fast as you please, but believe me, you imitate them too soon, much too soon in their Vices. But what can be said in Defense of that prevailing Passion and Taste for Gaming? Racing, Cards, Dice and all such Diver∣sions, where they are persu'd with that Eagerness as a Business or Occupation, have that fatal Tendency, that they never will permit that Country long to maintain the Character of a well moraliz'd People. If we consider the great Loss of Time, Money, and that Disinclination to Business, which these Things occasion, how many good Reasons may be urg'd, why it is much to be wish'd that several of these idle Amusements were either unknown amongst us, or immediately vanish'd from all Families, that are desirous to appear Examples of Sobriety, and Moderation? Our great and good Forefathers liv'd without Them, and I can see no Reason, no good Reason at least, why we their Posterity might not do so too, if we pleas'd. Many useful Arts in former Days were taken in Hand, and executed by both the Sexes, which now are almost entirely laid aside, and neglected by the one, and are absolutely forgot by, and
<PB N="11" REF="009409_0010_0F7404640206EBC0"/>
unknown to the other. I cou'd say much more to this Sub∣ject, but that has been said, may appear to some full enough, and therefore I shall proceed to another particular universally acknowleg'd of the highest Importance, and I hope that what I shall here advance will be receiv'd with Candour and Good-Nature, when it proceeds from no other Principle than a Desire to amend That which seems to require it, and to offer some Hints which well improv'd, and made use of, might prove of singular Service, and Advantage.</P>
<P>I dare say you all know, and even feel the Necessity of a good Education, and I imagine wou'd look upon it as no small Degree of Felicity, if you cou'd be sure of making your Sons hereafter in Life serviceable to your Country, useful to their own Families, and happy in Themselves.</P>
<P>It shou'd ever be remember'd that the Children of the pre∣sent Generation will be the Men that are to govern in the next, and such as they are train'd up now, will they be afterwards throughout Life, when left to themselves. The now full-grown, and exalted Oak, which has always undeviating risen in Rectitude, is not to be forc'd from it's Uprightness by Violence very cogent and oppressive; and likewise fruitless wou'd be the Attempt to unbend the same from that Crookedness, and Perverseness it was fix'd in, ever since it was a tender Plant. A Circumstance which makes it of the utmost Importance in every Sense both with Regard to the Public and Private In∣terest, in what manner Youth is prepar'd to appear hereafter on the Stage of Life. In respect of the present Method of
<PB N="12" REF="009409_0011_0F740464B360ADF0"/>
Education persu'd by far the greater Part amongst us, will it not appear to a thoughtful Person likely to take an unhappy Turn? The Attention of the Generality seems particularly di∣rected to those parts of useful Knowledge, as they may be call'd, which will turn out to some immediate Account of Profit, and Advantage, which will make some quick Return of a solid, lucrative Nature to their Possessor, whilst those more truly useful Arts, and valuable Studies, which polish, and humanize Mankind, which raise the Genius, and which mend the Heart, which inspire the noble Principles of Probity and Honour, which in short lay the Foundation of every private, and public Virtue, whilst these, I say, lie neglected and overlook'd, as altogether unnecessary to a Youth's future Advancement, and Success in the World. Instead of this what is there substituted? Perhaps I am not far from the Truth, as it is not my Design to be so, when I observe that a little Knowledge in Figures and Accounts, a Smattering of the Mathematics, and a tolerable Acquaintance with the peculiar Business of the Country, make up the Sum total of the Learning of I know not how many. On such Things as these then your Minds must always be em∣ploy'd, or Time will hang extremely heavy on your hands, except when you are engag'd in some of those Amusements and Di∣versions I have before mention'd (for tho' it is a strange Con∣nexion, that of a Persuit after Money and Pleasure, yet such is frequently the Case) and this in such a manner, as shall leave no Room (if you had the Disposition) for any Improvement in any thing more commendable. In consequence of all this your Care of your Descendants must be expected to be similar, and proportionably Defective; and accordingly we may observe
<PB N="13" REF="009409_0012_0F7404665C51C180"/>
you are much more intent upon cultivating a few dirty Acres of Land, than the improving and polishing a Youth's mind, which left wild to itself, like the Woods we live in, is seldom seen to produce any thing fair, lovely, or elegant. For is it an uncommon thing, (I heartily wish it was so) to see the hope∣ful Heir to a large Estate brought up in a manner by no means answerable to it, and who, when in Possession of it, either knowing not how to use it very stupidly hoards it up, or profusely squanders it away, without Judgement, Taste, or Reputation.</P>
<P>'Tis most certain, that in the Treasures of Ancient Learning are to be sought for all those excellent Precepts, which improve and mend the Heart, which as it is the source of every Virtue and every Vice cannot be tended with too much De∣ligence and Care, 'tis I say, in those valuable Stores of Knowlege, where we are to receive such Rules, as shall lay the Passions un∣der the Restraint of just Laws, that shall teach us each virtuous and generous Principle of Justice, Integrity, and Honor; 'Tis there, and there only we shall meet with painted in the liveliest Colors the most shining Examples of the bravest and the best of Men, not to be gaz'd at, but to be imitated: 'Tis from the Contemplation of those amiable Pictures, 'tis by the lovely Ideas we draw in from their Excellence, that we may learn to regulate and form our Manners, learn to transplant into our own Breasts their bright Perfections, till we shine like Them. Upon this noble and broad Foundation let us erect the glorious Superstructure of our Holy Religion, whence we shall see arise
<PB N="14" REF="009409_0013_0F740467044EA170"/>
that fair Edifice at once complete in every Point of Utility and Convenience, and adorn'd with all the Elegance and Simplicity of Nature; which at once shall stand firm and unshaken on its proper Basis, and the Ornament and Honor of all the Country round.</P>
<P>After having thus dwelt more largely, than I at first intended, on the foregoing Subject, I shall add the following Exhorta∣tion, which tho' it only touches upon those Particulars, which might very properly be drawn out into a greater Length, yet may have a good Effect, if duly attended to and regarded.</P>
<P>The most unfeeling, adamantine Heart cannot but swell with Thanks and Praise to Almighty GOD for these invaluable Blessings, the Peace and Security we now enjoy; but to testify properly this our Gratitude to the Supreme Being, let us all for the future (and this is the only way to do it) observe the most pious and religious Deportment, let us by the strictest Regard to the Precepts of that Religion with which we are blessed, the purest upon the Face of the Earth, be so very pru∣dent, and so very circumspect, that if possible, we may never do amiss: Thus we may hope to appear in the Presence of Almighty GOD, not as the most unworthy of his Creatures, upon whom he has been graciously pleased to pour down his Blessings.</P>
<P>Next to our thus conscientiously discharging our Duty to GOD, let us study to express our Loyalty, Affection, and Fi∣delity to the best and most beneficent King by a steady and due Obedience to his Laws, and Government, for this is the only
<PB N="15" REF="009409_0014_0F74046779A2C2C0"/>
kind Return we can make him, and this may much contribute towards making him sit easy, and happy on the Throne of his Ancestors, and sweeten the Toils and Pains of Royalty. As it will not a little serve to this good Purpose, let every one as much as lies in his Power discourage, and discountenance every insolent Attempt to disturb the public Tranquillity, curb every Appearance of Disorder and Discontent, and promote by all possible means the utmost Peace, Friendship, and Brotherly Love amongst one another.</P>
<P>If we entertain a just Sense of our Happiness at this Time, we shall shew our Pleasure and Satisfaction in it with Propriety and Decency; Let us therefore by no means indulge in wild Intemperance, Riot, or Luxury, but express a rational and be∣coming Joy for our present Welfare and Prosperity, and study to render permanent the inestimable Benefits resulting from so glorious a Peace.</P>
<P>On this happy and joyful Occasion I think the most Scrupu∣lous Hearer cannot be offended, that I conclude in a manner somewhat unusual indeed, yet I hope not improper or unsuit∣able tho' in the Language of Poetry,
<Q><L>Oh Peace! Thou Source and Soul of Social Bliss,</L>
<L>Beneath whose calm, inspiring Influence</L>
<L>Science her Views enlarges, Art refines,</L>
<L>And swelling Commerce opens all her Ports:</L>
<L>Blest be the Man Divine, who gives us Thee.</L>
