<L>Since no resisting cause from spirit flows</L>
<L>Thy penetrating essence to oppose;</L>
<L>No obstacles by nature's hand imprest,</L>
<L>Thy subtle and ethereal beams arrest;</L>
<L>Nor motion's laws can speed thy active course,</L>
<L>Nor strong repulsion's pow'rs obstruct thy force;</L>
<L>Since there is no convexity in MIND,</L>
<L>Why are thy genial beams to parts consin'd?</L>

<L>Not that unlicenc'd monster of the crowd,</L>
<L>Whose roar terrific bursts in peals so loud,</L>
<L>Deaf'ning the ear of Peace: fierce Faction's tool;</L>
<L>Of rash Sedition born, and mad Misrule;</L>
<L>Whose stubborn mouth, rejecting Reason's rein,</L>
<L>No strength can govern, and no skill restrain;</L>
<L>Whose magic cries the frantic vulgar draw</L>
<L>To spurn at Order, and to outrage law;</L>
<L>To tread on grave Authority and Pow'r,</L>
<L>And shake the work of ages in an hour:</L>
<L>Convuls'd her voice, and pestilent her breath,</L>
<L>She raves of mercy, while she deals out death:</L>

<L>Does matter govern spirit? Or is mind</L>

<L>No: they have heads to think, and hearts to feel,</L>

Qua-shi had somehow offended his master, a young planter with whom he had been bred up in the endearing intimacy of a play-fellow. His services had been faithful; his attachment affectionate. The master resolved to punish him, and pursued him for that purpose. In trying to escape Qua-shi stumbled and fell; the master fell upon him: They wrestled long with doubtful victory; at length Qua-shi got uppermost, and, being firmly seated on his master's breast, he secured his legs with one hand, and with the other drew a sharp knife; then said, <Q>Master, I have been bred up with you from a child; I have loved you as myself: In return, you have condemned me to a punishment of which I must ever have borne the marks; thus only I can avoid them;</Q> so saying, he drew the knife with all his strength across his own throat, and fell down dead, without a groan, on his master's body.</P>

<L>Whene'er to Afric's shores I turn my eyes,</L>
<L>Horrors of deepest, deadliest guilt arise;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="021269_0008_0FB2B54A96F774A0"/>I see, by more than Fancy's mirror shewn,</L>
<L>The burning village, and the blazing town;</L>
<L>See the dire victim torn from social life,</L>
<L>The shrieking babe, the agonizing wife!</L>
<L>She, wretch forlorn! is dragg'd by hostile hands</L>
<L>To distant tyrants sold, in distant lands!</L>
<L>Transmitted miseries, and successive chains,</L>
<L>The sole sad heritage her child obtains!</L>
<L>Ev'n this last wretched boon their foes deny,</L>
<L>To weep together, or together die.</L>
<L>By felon hands, by one relentless stroke,</L>
<L>See the fond links of feeling Nature broke!</L>
<L>The fibres twisting round a parent's heart,</L>
<L>Torn from their grasp, and bleeding as they part.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hold, murderers, hold! nor aggravate distress;</L>
<L>Respect the passions you yourselves possess;</L>
<L>Ev'n you, of russian heart, and ruthless hand,</L>

<L>Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame,</L>
