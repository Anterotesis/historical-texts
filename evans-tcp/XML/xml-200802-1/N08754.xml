</LIST>
<P>DEarly beloved countrymen, Wilkes's speeches urgeth us in several places to acknowledge and confess our gratitude and praises, and that we should not dissemble nor hide them before the face of our country, but confess them with a joyful and merry heart, to the end that we may enjoy a conti∣nuance
<PB N="4" REF="011191_0004_0F85CD572A746498"/>
of the same, through his fortitude and plain∣ness. And although we ought at all times to ac∣knowledge our favours from great men, so ought we especially so to do when we come together, to render thanks for the great benefits we have received from Wilkes's hands, to speak in his praise, to hear every speech, and to plead those things which are constitutional and requisite both for freedom &amp; liberty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>¶ Then the orater shall say.</HEAD>
<P>O Wilkes! be thou our strength.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> And we will sound forth thy name abroad on the earth.</P>

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> As thou wert in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty without end. Amen.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>¶ Then the People shall chaunt,</HEAD>
<P>O Come, let us sing unto Wilkes, let us rejoice in the spirit of his writings.</P>
<P>Let us thank him with our lips, and shew our∣selves glad in him with huzzas.</P>
<P>For Wilkes is a great writer, and a writer above all writers.</P>
<P>In his brain are all the quirks of the law, and their effects are known to him also.</P>
<P>The N****B***** is his, and he made it, his head prepared the matter thereof.</P>
<P>For he is the man that sheweth wonders, and we are the people that read the work of his hands.</P>
<P>If you would hear him speak, turn not away, as in his provocation, when an exile, and as in the day of tribulation in the King's Bench prison.</P>
<P>When our great men tempted him, proved him and saw him staunch.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011191_0005_0F85CD5BB8B453B0"/>Several years was he grieved with this set of wretches, and said, It is a people who want slavery and famine. They know not my worth.</P>
<P>Unto whom I sware by Magna Charta that they should not gain their end.</P>

<P>As thou wert in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty without end. Amen.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>¶ Then shall follow these verses, one verse by the orator, and another by the people.</HEAD>
<P>O Give thanks unto Wilkes, for he is sensible, and his sensibility continueth for ever.</P>
<P>Let all them give thanks whom he hath de∣fended, and delivered from the power of arbitrary seizures.</P>
<P>Many a time have some men fought against him, after the writing of number Forty-five.</P>
<P>Yea, many a time have they vexed him, but they have not utterly prevailed over him.</P>
<P>They have spread their net to destroy him without a cause, ye, even without a cause did they put him afar off.</P>
<P>They have laid a net for his feet, and have hap∣pily fallen into it themselves.</P>
<P>Great is his courage, and great his perseverance, yea and his capacity is wonderful.</P>
<P>Wilkes sitteth up the fallen poor and bringeth down oppressors to the ground.</P>
<P>Let your voice be for the man of your right-hand, and upon the man who hath supported you in the time of your trouble.</P>
<P>We will not go back from thee, O Wilkes! O let us be free, and we will sing forth thy name.</P>
<P>Honour be to thee, O Wilkes!</P>
<P>As thou wert in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty without end. Amen.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011191_0006_0F85CD5CC5E2E988"/>WILKES, thou hast been our glory from one tribulation to another.</P>
<P>Before the Essay was brought forth, or the North Briton was made, thou wast the man of liberty who defendest our cause, and stood up in our behalf.</P>
<P>Thou turnest B*** to distraction, and again thou sayest, Rise no more to perplex this free people.</P>
<P>For all thy intrigues were in my sight, they are but as yesterday in mine eyes.</P>
<P>But he told, thou shalt dread my displeasure, and be afraid of my spirited indignation.</P>
<P>I have set thy misdeeds before thee, and thy secret fawnings in the light of thine own eyes.</P>
<P>Behold, who regardeth the power of thy wrath? it is even as a weapon without sharpness.</P>
<P>Thou art full of nothingness, and art empty for lack of true knowledge.</P>
<P>Honour be to thee, O Wilkes!</P>
<P>As thou wert in the beginning, thou art now, and ever will be, liberty without end. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>¶ The lecture appointed for this intercession, is taken out of the Chronicles, the twelfth chapter, beginning at the forty-fifth verse.</HEAD>
<P>NOW there was in the reign of G***** the king, a mighty spirit of tribulation. And the great men of the land were laying upon the people bur∣thens of great weight, yea, heavier burthens than were home by their fathers, or their fathers farthers before them. And they cried out unto the elders, and complained for lack of relief. (Now the elders were deaf to their cries, and they minded not the daily lamentation which they made) And they cri∣ed yet louder and louder, so that the whole land was pierced with the sound thereof. And behold, in process of time, that there arose up a man, (who
<PB N="7" REF="011191_0007_0F85CD5DB6238EE0"/>
was also an elder, and a colonel of the guard, in the land of Buckingham) who had compassion upon them; and he opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that you are oppressed and agrieved, and that your task-masters lay upon you more than you are able to bear. Behold I myself will speak unto this people who do evil continually, and will require a reason for that which they now do. Be ye therefore, patient, having peace among yourselves, and you shall be filled. Now it came to pass that af∣ter a short time this good man did as he promised unto the people. And he spoke time after time of their tribulation, and wrote even letters with his own hand, complaining of the rulers in a free country. And behold, they were affronted thereat, and they were full of envy against this man, because he had spoken well of the people. And when it was so that he had wrote even a forty-fifth letter unto them, that they took him out of the house of his habitati∣on, and put him into a fast place, which place is called a tower even unto this day. And they look∣ed into his dwelling, and searched for his papers, and all his secret workings, and they took them every one. And behold, when they had found these, that they took him from the fast place, and banished him afar off beyond the sea. And he was left there, and commanded not to return; for behold it was seemly unto the elders that he should be put away from amongst them.</P>

<HEAD>¶ The second lecture is taken out of the book of Pro∣phecies, second coapter, beginning at the twelfth verse.</HEAD>
<P>WHATSOEVER things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we thro' instruction and understanding, might see into the depths thereof. Now the great secret is found out which was before hid from our eyes, and we see clear∣ly as at noon day. In the beginning was a favou∣rite, and this favourite was B***, and B*** was with the K***. Many were the things wrought by him, and without him was not any evil done that was
<PB N="9" REF="011191_0009_0F85CD5F424C5160"/>
done. In him was pride, and that pride was found to be the destruction of men Now there was a man returned from the land whereunto he was sent, and also persecuted, whose name was Wilkes, the same came back for a plague unto evil doers, And he abode within the gates of the city many days, and put his name among those who were to be chosen elders of the land. But they cast him from among them so that he was not one of the elect, and he went his way. Howbeit he had in another roll his name written (as is recorded in the Chronicles) and he was chosen. Now when B*** heard there∣of, and saw what they had done amongst them, he was very wroth, and wist not what to do, for this same man had stung him aforetime So he stirred up his fellows against him, to persecute him, that he might not abide with them. And behold they grew exceeding powerful, insomuch that they took him away from the people, and put him in a strong hold. And the people grew very wroth, and was displea∣sed thereat. And they assembled in great compa∣nies by thousands, and would not be at rest, because of the things which were done. And they made great noises together; and many got for themselves chalk which was white for to make a mark on every man as he passed, thus, 45 And this mark was put upon the coverings of the heads and the backs of all who passed this way or that way in honour of their great idols, Wilkes and Liberty. Until the even of many days did they do these things.</P>

<P>I Believe in Wilkes, the firm patriot, maker of num∣ber 45. Who was born for our good. Suffered under arbitrary power. Was banished and imprison∣ed. He ascended into purgatory, and returned some time after. He ascended here with honour, and sit∣teth amidst the great assembly of the people, where he shall judge both the favourite and his creatures. I believe in the spirit of his abilities, that they will prove to the good of our country. In the resurrecti∣on of liberty, and the life of universal freedom for ever. Amen</P>

Give them to known and to feel for the necessities of the poor and indigent; and that, instead of bowing, scraping, and cringing for a place in the court, it would much better be∣come them to exert their utmost abilities (as the ser∣vants of the public) in endeavouring to lower the prices of all the necessaries of life, that the poor may rejoice, and the heart of the widow be uplifted with

<HEAD>A Political and Constitutional SERMON.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Book of Prophecies, Chap. i. Ver. 45, 46, 47.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And there shall come a fox from the north, yea, and a he-lion shall rouze himself in the south, and they shall be at war, and shall not dwell at quiet. And there shall come distresses and tumults upon the land, even in this great city, and the oppressed shall rise up by hundreds and by thousands And in these days locusts shall overspread all the face of the earth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the words before us, the prophet seems clearly to indicate to us the troublesome vexations and distur∣bing animosities which must of necessity prevail, in some future time, amongst a particular people. And he endeavours to point out the beginning of these trou∣bles in so very distinct a manner, as if he designed to give the inhabitants a timely warning of this dread∣ful catastrophe, that, by proper means, they might, in some measure, prevent its coming so severe upon them as utterly to destroy them in their sins. He not only prophesies in <HI>general terms,</HI> but is also parti∣cularly careful respecting the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place</HI> when and where these things shall come to pass.</P>
<P>A fox, says he, shall come from the NORTH— a lion from the SOUTH— and there shall come <HI>distresses</HI> in THIS great city—and in THESE days
<PB N="14" REF="011191_0014_0F85CD63C7655F20"/>
locusts shall overspread the face of the land. So you find, my brethren, that when the fox is come from the <HI>north</HI> —and the he-lion has rouzed himself in the <HI>south</HI>— distresses and tumults are to be expected in the city, and over the whole face of the land; and, that hundreds and thousands of oppressed people shall rise up together—and, when these things are so far accomplished, then, in THESE days, locusts shall come in upon us and dwell on the land.</P>
<P>Having thus considered the words in general, as they stand before us, it may be necessary, for the further illustration of this passage, to consider particularly,</P>
<P N="1">I. What we are to understand by <HI>A fox coming from the North.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. How, and in what manner, <HI>a he-lion is to rouze himself in the south,</HI> and why <HI>they shall be at war, and shall not dwell at quiet.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Consider what <HI>distresses and tumults shall op∣press the land,</HI> so that the <HI>oppressed shall rise up by hun∣dreds and by thousands.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Give some description of the locusts which are to <HI>overspread the face of the whole land.</HI> And,</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Conclude with some practical improve∣ment upon the whole. And,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> What we are to understand by <HI>A fox co∣ming from the north.</HI></P>
<P>It may appear necessary, for the right apprehen∣ding of the text, now under our consideration, that the book of <HI>Prophecies,</HI> was, originally, wrote in London; and therefore, when the prophet says, <HI>"even</HI> in this <HI>great city,"</HI> he must be understood to mean <HI>that</HI> place: and of course it follows, that the land spoken of is no other than that of <HI>South-Britain,</HI> on the north of which lieth that part which is called <HI>Scotland,</HI> from whence our admired penman hath in∣formed us the <HI>fox</HI> should come.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011191_0015_0F85CD646F7DC6A0"/>And, as it may not be altogether disagreeable, or in the least unworthy the notice of my hearers, I will first give a short description of these animals, and then proceed. In general, foxes are very remarkable for their deep cunning. They will, when pursued by hunters, make urine on their tails, and strike them upon the faces of the dogs. When trapped by a gin, they have been known to bite of the part con∣fined, and so escaped. And being hungry, they feign themselves dead, on whom the fowls lighting, for prey, they rise and devour them. But, as there are different kinds of foxes, so their artful inventi∣ons are as various. That kind of fox, mentioned by the prophet, the generality of commentators agree to be the BOOT-FOX, and describe him with an extraordinary long head, smooth tongue, and remar∣kable long eyes. His legs are covered with a kind of mottled, woolly furr, though bare at the joints of his knees, and his feet to be cloven. This fox, my beloved, it is well known, has been amongst us for some time, and did, originally, come from the north, answering every description that is given of him by the Prophet in the former part of this chapter, be∣ginning at the sixteenth verse: <HI>And the fox that shall appear in high places, and, by his cunning, get even in∣to the houses of the most high, shall be a favourite fox. He shall feed upon dainties, and he shall have influence over many foxes; yea, and lambs shall lie down before him and do reverence. But the lions of spirit, and the wolves, and their young ones, shall seek his destruction continually.</HI> From hence it is plain, that this same fox is now amongst us, and has been seen COUR<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing it up and down in high forests, and, by his secret fawnings, and detestable undermining attempss, he
<PB N="16" REF="011191_0016_0F85CD68EE7791A0"/>
has got into good feed, and that, as it were, unob∣served. We have, my brethren, too long borne with his ferriting scratches; we have already reason to curse the time that ever such an animal existed amongst us. O my beloved, take care! be upon the watch! this hungry Reynard still lives—still acts— still rules! and unless the other part of this prophecy had taken place, we had been utterly undone for ever. Having considering thus far, I shall proceed, in the next place, to shew,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> How, and what manner, <HI>a he-lion is to rouze himself in the south,</HI> and why they <HI>shall be at war with each other,</HI> so as never to <HI>dwell at quiet.</HI> If our eyes my beloved, have been in the least open, we surely must have perceived, that the words of the Prophet, in this point also, have been fully veri∣fied and brought to pass.—<HI>Yea, and a he-lion shall rouze himself in the</HI> SOUTH; that is, A he-lion shall rouze himself in ENGLAND You cannot be ig∣norant, nay, you must be sensible, that, of all beasts, the lion is the most courageous. The pleasing con∣trast the Prophet hath here drawn, by way of simile, cannot be sufficiently admired. Than the fox and the lion nothing can be more directly apposite; not only the figure and size, but nature and principle. The one, unused to slattery and deceit, timidity and cow∣ardice; the other, a noted partaker of each. With principles thus contrasted, no wonder that each on each should cast so black an eye, and be at variance, and should not <HI>dwell at quiet.</HI> We well know, how∣ever, that when a lion is brought from abroad, in order to be brought under some restraint, he is con∣fined in a prison, wherein he may be kept from dis∣turbing the quiet of those foxes that are generally the most crafty, and are the most afraid of him. My

brethren, apply this particular to the times in which we live: behold and see if nothing of this kind hath yet come to pass amongst us. It was the way of the antients to write by way of fable, and our prophet hath thought proper to adopt that pleasing method above all others. To explain this part of our text, it may not be amiss, therefore, to remark here, what we are to understand by a HE-LION. This accord∣ing to the sense of the learned, can mean no other than the resolute Patriot, who has so much exerted himself in the behalf of his country; who has ever kept a jealous eye on the designs and mean artifices of the favourite <HI>boot-fox,</HI> and gloriously brought to open light what fear and cowardice have been always ashamed to reveal. It is the noble ex∣ertion of this lion that hath so terrified the whole nest of foxes. He has, like <HI>Samson,</HI> knit them all toge∣ther, tail to tail, with a firebrand between each two, from which distress and entanglement they know not how to extricate and deliver themselves. By way of trial they have, however, cast him into a den; ne∣vertheless, he still continues to cause in them a dread, that easily they cannot conquer and overcome: so that <HI>they still are at war with each other, and do not dwell at quiet.</HI>—Proceed we now to consider,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> What distresses and tumults should op∣press the land, so that <HI>the oppressed shall rise up by hun∣dreds and by thousands.</HI> And first, my brethren, I shall consider the distresses—Those who are any way acquainted with life and the world, must, of conse∣quence, perceive, how distress and misery fill our streets. For the want of a proper supply of provisi∣ons, and the common necessaries of life, how many of our poor have been snatched off in their prime! Others advanced to old age, grey-hair'd subjects,
<PB N="18" REF="011191_0018_0F85CD69E5FB86A8"/>
tender fathers, affectionatte mothers, loyal friends, and honest Britons, O! how have they been taken from amongst us by the cruel usage of Poverty and Want! When corn and provisions have been plenty; when Providence hath crowned our harvests with abundance; how have our poor been debarred from partaking thereof, while the owners have stored their barns, and kept it shamefully back from those who were starving with hunger. Not only were these practices, beloved, passed over and winked at by men in power, but at that time it was known to be carried abroad to enemies—open enemies—profes∣sed enemies! and sold cheaper to them, by far, than we could possibly purchase at home. Add to this, the large quantities of wheat continually being cast into the waters, which by long standing, had been spoilt, and rendered useless—even to the DESPISED POOR.</P>
<P>Who then can wonder at the risings of the people or be amazed at the tumults (not abroad, but) at home? Is there not reason—sufficient reason for these murmurings and complaints among the lower class of the people? The Prophet might very well lay a particular emphasis here—<HI>and the oppressed</HI> SHALL <HI>rise up, &amp;c.</HI>—Never had people more oc∣casion to exert what little spirit they had left in their own cause, before they were utterly destroyed.— Thus things were going on in a very <HI>foul</HI> way for their destruction. They saw them, and were wise. Fair and humble means were at first tried; petitions were offered; supplications were made to men in power, and to UNFEELING ministers whose con∣tinual promises were, They WOULD assist;—pro∣visions SHOULD lowered in their prices, and they might rely upon their IMMEDIATE considerati∣on
<PB N="19" REF="011191_0019_0F85CD6A73679F48"/>
on and dispatch. These promises, we are now sen∣sible, were made to appease the noise of the VUL∣GAR, as they are stiled, for never was any thing done in their behalf in consequence of those <HI>promises,</HI> and they were left to shift for themselves, and to do as well as people in their situation were capable of doing, without THEIR assistance.—In this manner were they kept in suspense, starving and to starve, till Necessity (the mother of invention) taught them how to rise in large bodies together, no longer to pray, but to demand. Then came forth, <HI>even in this great city,</HI> multitudes of machanics, various in their professions, and firm in their resolutions, exer∣ting themselves in their own defence, chusing ra∣ther to fall by the sword, than be in the midst of plenty dying for the want of proper sustenance and nourishment.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly considered the <HI>distresses</HI> and <HI>tumults</HI> which have come to pass, according to the prophecy of the Prophet. I come now to give some description of the <HI>locusts</HI> which are to overspread the face of the whole land.</P>
<P><HI>And in these days, &amp;c.</HI> As there are of foxes seve∣rals kinds, so of locusts the same. But, in general, every species of this insect are accounted vile. Their nature is to herd many together, therefore vast mul∣titudes are resembled by them. In <HI>Arabia,</HI> as well as in <HI>England,</HI> the people are infested with them; but, in these times, they more particularly infest the latter. They generally come upon <HI>corn,</HI> when ripe, and what they do not <HI>eat,</HI> they infect with their <HI>touch.</HI> They die whole swarms together; and, after death, they poison the air, and cause a pestilence.—How happy our prophetic writer appears in his expressions and similies, I leave to the determination of my hea∣rers!
<PB N="20" REF="011191_0020_0F85CD6B32268BF8"/>
Nothing could have been more to the pur∣pose in answering his design to paint to the people the events of futurity, in this respect, than that of the <HI>locust.</HI> According to the description I have given of that insect, how striking a resemblance does it bear with the swarm of vile locusts which was daily found in the western patt of our renouned city, where numbers have been seen to assemble together in companies and flights, to accomplish their evil designs. In the twelfth chapter of the <HI>Prophecies,</HI> the Prophet takes notice of the time when they dis∣appear, and what events follow, from verse 88 to verse 92. <HI>Now after the locusts shall have perplexed the people, and have been even in one place years two and five, they shall divide themselves apart. And it shall come to pass, that when the old locusts shall die away, that there shall be great joy and feasting among the people. But behold, they shall fear the coming of another swarm, for they shall not know what they shall do. And the people shall be divided amongst themselves what manner of swarm it shall be. But the beginning thereof shall be destructive unto many.</HI> I have my be∣loved, quoted thus much that ye be not misguided: locusts are amongst you; they are even come with a great power: and, though the last swarm are sepe∣rated, and are gone; yet, take care, the beginning of these, you perceive, <HI>have</HI> already been destructive unto many.</P>
<P>Having thus gone through the principal parts which I at first intended, I now proceed to some practical improvement upon the whole, and will have done. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Seeing that a fox is come from the north, let us be watchful, and extremely jealous, of every mo∣tion that may be made of his exertion. His cun∣ning
<PB N="21" REF="011191_0021_0F85CD6BF5598438"/>
is deep; his attempts sly; and deceit artful. He may be found to make urine of the strongest taint upon his tail, and close your eyes in such a man∣ner, that we cannot pursue him in his intrigues. He may feign dead or inactive, but at last rouze up and devour a multitude. It requires, therefore, the greatest diligence and perseverance to prevent his becoming our detestable and inveterate destroyer.</P>
<P N="2">2. As we are incouraged by the presence of a li∣on, we ought not to be cast down, grieve our spirits, and faint, as though no prospect of help were nigh.— The lion is a furious beast; hardships and difficul∣ties, which appear so to us, become as nothing to him; and we have already found, that his power ALONE hath defended us in our Houses—in our Castles—in our Possessions. We should therefore be thankful, and rejoice that there is one power provided against another, so that our attempts, for the liberty of our children, do not entirely become of non-effect.</P>
<P N="3">3. In all times of public distress and tumultuous proceedings, we should be particularly careful how we think and act, neither to be seen defending our own cause, or walking by the way-side <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to that meritorious action in St. George's fields, namely, the fireing upon and killing several of his majesty's subjects, as they were satisfying their curiosity thereabouts in seeing Mr. (now Alderman) Wilkes.</NOTE>, lest either by fire or sword we be destroyed, and our lives taken away. In short, my brethren, to be in favour with the GREAT, let your conversation be nought, lie down peaceably and be trod upon, resisting none who im∣pose upon you, and then! * * * * and then! * * * * O then!</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="22" REF="011191_0022_0F85CD6D0A2CD7D8"/>4. Seeing that locusts of a new kind are come up∣on us, let us behold them a while in their actions. If they oppress us, and, as the last swarm, blast every gleam of hope, that may appear favourable in our behalf, we may expect little good from them. if they direct themselves by the NORTH wind, and are governed by that cold corner, it is reason∣able to expect that we shall soon be in a starving condition, since that wind carries with it a most omenous aspect, of which we have been the too sad and uncomfortable spectators.</P>
<P>To conclude. Let every one be upon their guard. Whatever appears in the strict eye of Rea∣son, to carry with it the impression of Truth, a taste of true Patriotism, and a love of Liberty and an universal Freedom, by all means let that be first embraced. And I trust, my brethren, that these few hints, which I have just thrown together, will not be unworthy your notice. May this discourse have its desired effect upon you, and promote, in some degree, your fortitude and courage under every imposition that may be lain upon you by a set of arbitrary ******* and ******. Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Now unto all men be consolation, friendship, and good∣will, from this time forth, and for evermore.</HI> Amen.</P>
