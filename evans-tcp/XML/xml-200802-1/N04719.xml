<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING been ordained at <HI>Gloucester,</HI> on <HI>Trinity</HI> Sun∣day 1736, and preached my Sermon on the <HI>Neces∣sity and Benefit of religious Society,</HI> to a very crowded Auditory, in the Church in which I was baptized the Lord's Day fol∣lowing, I set out the next <HI>Wednesday</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I was received with great Joy by my Religious Friends—For about a Week I continued in my Servitor's Habit, and then took my Degree of <HI>Batchelor of Arts,</HI> after having been at the Univer∣sity three Years and three Quarters, and go∣ing on towards the 22d Year of my Age. My dear and honour'd Friends the Reve∣rend Messrs. <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Charles Wesley,</HI> be∣ing now for some time embarked for
<PB N="6" REF="005886_0005_10275DCBCB969550"/>
<HI>Georgia,</HI> and one or two more having taken Orders, the Interest of METHODISM, as it was then and is now term'd, had vi∣sibly declined, and very few of this repu∣tedly mad Way were left at the University. This somewhat discouraged me at Times, but the Lord JESUS supported my Soul, and made me easy by giving me a strong Convic∣tion, that I was where He would have me to be▪ My Degree I soon found was of Service to me, as it gave me access to those I could not be free with when in an inferi∣or Station, and as Opportunity offer'd, I was enabled to converse with them about the Things which belonged to the Kingdom of GOD.—The Subscriptions for the poor Pri∣soners (which amounted to about <HI>Forty Pounds</HI> per Annum) were soon put into my Hands—Two or Three small Charity Schools, maintained by the <HI>Methodists,</HI> were under my more immediate Inspection, which, with the Time I spent in following my Studies, private Retirement, and religi∣ous Converse, sweetly filled up the whole of my Day, and kept me from that unac∣countable, but too common, Complaint of having any Time hang upon my Hands. The distributing Money and Books amongst
<PB N="7" REF="005886_0006_10275DD015D95E58"/>
the poor Prisoners, and employing such as could work, I found was of admirable Ser∣vice:—For hereby they were kept from that worst of Goal diseases, Idleness; and were not only convinced that we bore a good Will towards them, but also laid as it were under an Obligation to hear the Instructions we gave them from time to time.—This practice was first taken up by the Messrs. <HI>Wesleys,</HI> and would to God all Ordinaries of Prisons would Copy after their good Example—They would de∣serve well of the Common-wealth, and if actuated by the Love of God, would re∣ceive a glorious Reward from him who hath said, <HI>I was sick and in Prison, and ye came unto me.</HI></P>
<P>In a short Time I began to be more than content in my present State of Life. God was pleased to be with me of a Truth,—My Strength was proportioned to my Day, and I had thoughts of abiding at the University, at least for some Years, to finish my Studies, and do what good I could amongst the poor despised Methodists.—But <HI>God's Thoughts are not as Man's Thoughts, neither are our Ways as his Ways.</HI>—By a Se∣ries of unforeseen, unexpected and unsought
<PB N="8" REF="005886_0007_10275DD300FE6CD0"/>
for Providences, I was called in a short Time from my beloved Retirement to take a Journey to the Metropolis of <HI>England.</HI>—Whilst I was an under-Graduate, amongst other religious Friends, I was very intimate with one Mr. <HI>B—n,</HI> a professed <HI>Me∣thodist,</HI> who had lately taken Orders, and was Curate at the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London.</HI>—With him, when absent, I frequently correspond∣ed, and when present took sweet Councel, and walked to the House of God as Friends. He mention'd me to that late good and great Man Sir <HI>John Philips</HI>—And being called down for a while into <HI>Hampshire,</HI> he wrote to me to be of good Courage, and in the Strength of GOD, bid me hasten to Town to officiate in his Absence, and be refreshed with the Sight and Conversation of many who loved me for CHRIST'S sake, and had for a long Time desired to see me—</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday August</HI> 4th, (the Priso∣ners being provided for by the coming of Mr. <HI>Harvy,</HI> another young worthy Methodist that had lately taken Deacon's Orders) with fear and trembling I obeyed the Summons, and went in the Stage Coach to <HI>London.</HI>—There being no other Passenger, I employed my∣self, a good Part of the Way, in earnest Sup∣plication
<PB N="9" REF="005886_0008_10275DD5E6BB67C0"/>
to the God of all Grace to be my Guide and my Comforter; at the same Time I could not help praising him for chang∣ing my Heart and calling me to preach the Gospel at a Place to which, not many Years ago, I would have given much Money, would my Circumstances have permitted, to have went up and seen a Play. In the Evening I reach'd the Tower, and was kindly received by my dear Friend—The remain∣der of the Week was spent in visiting Sir <HI>John Philips,</HI> &amp;c. who were too glad to see me.—But God sent me something to ballast it.—For as I passed along the Streets many came out of their Shops, admiring to see so young a Person in a Gown and Cassock. One I remember in particular cryed out, "<HI>There's a Boy Parson.</HI>"—which, as it serv'd to mortify my Pride, put me also up∣on turning that apostolical Exhortation into Prayer, "<HI>Let no Man despise thy Youth.</HI>"</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday August</HI> 8th, in the Afternoon I preached at <HI>Bishop-Gate</HI> Church, the large∣ness of which, and the Congregation toge∣ther, at first a little dashed me; but by ad∣verting to God, and considering in whose Name I was about to speak, my Mind was calm'd and I was enabled to preach with
<PB N="10" REF="005886_0009_10275DD8C7EE6158"/>
Power.—The Effect was immediate and visible to all; for as I went up the Stairs al∣most all seem to sneer at me on Account of my Youth; but they soon grew serious, and exceedingly attentive, and after I came down shewed me great tokens of Respect, bles∣sed me as I pass'd along, and made great Enquiry who I was—The Question no one could answer, for I was quite a Stranger. I speedily slip'd thro' the Crow'd, and came to the <HI>Tower,</HI> blessing God for his Goodness to me the unworthiest of the Sons of Men—</P>
<P>Here I continued for the Space of two Months, reading Prayers twice a Week, cate∣chising and preaching once, besides visiting the Soldiers in the Infirmary and Barracks, daily. I also read Prayers every evening at <HI>Wapping Chapel,</HI> and preached at <HI>Ludgate</HI> Pri∣son every Tuesday—God was pleased to give me favour in the Eyes of the Inhabitants of the Tower—The Chapel was crowded on Lord's Days—Religious Friends from divers Parts of the Town attended the Word, and several young Men came on Lord's Day Morning, under serious Im∣pressions, to hear me discourse about the <HI>New-Birth, and the Necessity of renouncing all in Affection, in order to follow JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005886_0010_10275DDAEEEFFDC0"/>
After I had been about a Month in Town, Letters came from the Messrs. <HI>Wesleys,</HI> and the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Ingham</HI> their Fellow-La∣bourer, <HI>an Israelite indeed,</HI> from <HI>Georgia.</HI> Their Accounts fired my Soul, and made me even long to go abroad for God too—But having no outward call, and be∣ing, as I then thought, too weak in Bo∣dy ever to undertake a Voyage to Sea, I endeavour'd to lay aside all Thoughts of going abroad,—But my Endeavours were all in vain—For I felt at Times such a strong Attraction in my Soul towards <HI>Georgia,</HI> that I thought it almost irre∣sistible.—I strove against it with all my Power, begged again and again with many Cries and Tears, that the Lord would not suffer me to be deluded, and at length opened my Mind to several dear Friends—All agreed that Labourers were wanted at home, that I had as yet no visible Call abroad, and that it was my Duty not to be rash, but wait and see what Providence might point out to me—To this I consented with my whole Heart, and having stayed in <HI>London</HI> till Mr. <HI>B—n</HI> came out of the Coun∣try, I returned to my little Charge at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and waited upon my Deaconship accord∣ing
<PB N="12" REF="005886_0011_10275DE23805CC00"/>
to the Measure of Grace imparted to me</P>
<P>But Oh what a delightful Life did I lead there! What Communion did I daily en∣joy with God! And how sweetly did my Hours in private glide away in reading and praying over Mr. <HI>Henry'</HI>s Comment upon the Scriptures! Whilst I am musing on and writing about it, the Fire I then felt again kindles in my Soul—Nor was I alone happy—For several dear Youths were quickened greatly, and met daily at my Room to build up each other in their most holy Faith—God raised up Friends for our temporal Support—The late Ho∣nourable <HI>Betty Hastings,</HI> that Elect Lady, al∣lowed some of them two or three small Ex∣hibitions.—I also partook of her Ladyship's Bounty; and a Gentleman, whose Heart was in an especial Manner knit to me when last at <HI>London,</HI> was stirred up, without being sollicited, to send me not only Mo∣ney for the Poor, but also a Sufficiency to discharge Debts I had contracted for Books before I took my Degree. Upon his Re∣commendation, I was chosen a corresponding Member of the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge, which I rejoiced in, as it gave me an Opportunity of procuring
<PB N="13" REF="005886_0012_10275DE3C3DF3600"/>
Books at a cheap and easy Rate for the poor People.—May the great high Priest and Apostle of our Profession continue to bless that Society, and prosper all their pious Undertakings to the Advancement of his own Glory, and his People's eternal Good!</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>November,</HI> Provi∣dence once more called me from my be∣loved, tho' little, Scene of Action.—The Rev'd Mr. <HI>Kinchin,</HI> now with God, had lately been awakned, and accordingly resolved to associate with the despised <HI>Metho∣dists,</HI> determining to <HI>know nothing but JESUS CHRIST and him crucified.</HI>—He was then Minister of <HI>Dummer</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> and be∣ing likely to be chosen Dean of <HI>Corpus Christi</HI> College, he desired me to come and officiate for him, till that Affair should be decided.—By the Advice of Friends, I went, and he came to sup∣ply my Place at <HI>Oxford.</HI>—His Parish consisting chiefly of poor and illiterate Peo∣ple, my proud Heart at first could not well brook it.—I would have given all the World for one of my <HI>Oxford</HI> Friends, and mourned for lack of them as a Dove that has lost her Mate—But upon giving myself to Prayer, and reading Mr. <HI>Law'</HI>s excel∣lent
<PB N="14" REF="005886_0013_10275DE54C5EA810"/>
Character of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranius,</HI> in his <HI>Serious Call to a devout Life,</HI> my Mind was re∣conciled to such Conversation as the Place afforded me—Before I came to <HI>Dummer</HI> Mr. <HI>Kinchin</HI> had used his People, accord∣ing to the Rubrick, to have publick Prayers, twice a Day, <HI>viz.</HI> In the Morning, it be∣ing the Winter Season, before it was Light, and in the Evening after the People return∣ed from their Work. He also catechised the Lambs of the Flock daily, and visited from House to House,—He loved his People and was beloved by them—I pro∣secuted his Plan, and generally divided the Day into three Parts, eight Hours for Study and Retirement, eight Hours for Sleep and Meals, and eight Hours for reading Prayers, catechising, and visiting the Parish—The Profit I reaped by these Exercises, and con∣versing with the poor Country people, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nspeakable—I soon began to be as much delighted with their artless Conver∣sation, as I had been formerly with the Company of my <HI>Oxford</HI> Friends; and fre∣quently learnt as much by an Afternoon's Visit as in a Weeks Study—During my Stay here, an Invitation was sent me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very profitable Curacy in <HI>London:</HI> but I
<PB N="15" REF="005886_0014_1026E4A310C4D4D8"/>
had no Inclination to accept it—The Thoughts of going to <HI>Georgia</HI> still crowded continually in upon me, and at length Providence seem'd to point my Way thither. About the Middle of <HI>December</HI> comes a Letter from Mr. <HI>B—n,</HI> informing me, that Mr. <HI>Charles Wesley</HI> was arrived at <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> Soon after came a Letter from Mr. <HI>Charles</HI> himself, wherein he informed me, that he was come over to procure Labourers, but added he, "<HI>I dare not prevent God's Nomination.</HI>—In a few Days after this came, another Letter from Mr. <HI>John Wesley,</HI> where∣in were these Words, <Q><HI>Only Mr.</HI> Delamott <HI>is with me, till God shall stir up the Hearts of some of his Servants, who putting their Lives in his Hands, shall come over and help us, where the Harvest is so great, and the Labourers so few. What if thou art the Man Mr.</HI> Whitefield?</Q> In ano∣ther Letter were these Words, <Q><HI>Do you ask me what you shall have? Food to eat, and Raiment to put on, a House to lay your Head in; such as your Lord had not; and a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</HI></Q> Upon reading this my Heart leaped within me, and as it were ecchoed to the Call—Many things concurred
<PB N="16" REF="005886_0015_10275DE6F2077EC0"/>
to make my Way clear.—Mr. <HI>Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chin</HI> was now elected Dean of <HI>Corpus Christi Col∣lege,</HI> and being thereby obliged to reside at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he willingly took upon him the Charge of the Prisoners.—Mr. <HI>Harvy</HI> was ready to serve the Cure of <HI>Dummer.</HI>—Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI> was my dear Friend, and I thought it would be a great Advantage to me to be under his Tuition—<HI>Georgia</HI> was an Infant, and likely▪ to be an encreasing Colony; and the Government seem'd to have its Wellfare much at Heart—I had heard many Indians were near, it, and thought it a Matter of great Importance that serious Clergymen should be sent there Retirement and Privacy was what my Soul delighted in.—A Voyage to Sea would, in all Probability, not do my Constitution much hurt: Nay, I had heard the Sea was sometimes Beneficial to weakly People. And supposing the worst, as I must necessa∣rily return to take Priest's Orders, it would then be left to my Choice, whether I would fix in my Native Country, or go abroad any more—These Things being thoroughly weighed, I at length resolved within myself to embark for <HI>Georgia;</HI> and knowing that I should never put my Resolution into Prac∣tice
<PB N="17" REF="005886_0016_10275DEC9ED04670"/>
if I conferred with Flesh and Blood, I wrote to my Relations to inform them of my Design, and withal told them, <Q>if they would promise not to dissuade me from my intended Voyage, I would come and take a personal leave of them; if other∣wise, knowing my own Weakness, I was determined to embark without visit∣ing them at all.</Q> A few Days after Mr. <HI>Kinchin</HI> came to <HI>Dummer</HI> and introduced Mr.<HI>Harvy</HI> into the Cure—I apprised them of my Intention—They gave me some friendly Council, and having spent the beginning of <HI>Christmas</HI> sweetly together, and taken an affectionate leave of the <HI>Dum∣mer</HI>-People, I returned once more to <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> to bid adieu to my Friends, who were as dear to me as my own Soul—My Resolution at first a little shocked them, but having reason to think, from my Relation of Circumstances, that, I had a Call from Providence, most of them said, "<HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI>"—</P>
<P>On <HI>New-Year'</HI>s Day 1736,7, I went to <HI>Gloucester</HI> in order to hear the Bishop's <HI>Opinion,</HI> and to take my leave of my Mo∣ther and other Relations—His Lordship received me, as he always did, like a Fa∣ther,
<PB N="18" REF="005886_0017_10275DEF878C0990"/>
approved of my Design, wished me much Success, and said <Q>He did not doubt but God would bless me, and that I should do much Good abroad.</Q> My own Re∣lations at first were not so passive—My aged Mother wept sore, and others urged what pretty Preferment I might have, if I would stay at home—But at length they grew more quiet, and finding me so fixed, gainsayed no longer—During my stay here, I began to grow a little Popular. God gave me Honour for a while, even in my own Country—I preached twice on the Sabbaths. Congregations were very large, and the Power of God attended the Word; and some I have reason to believe were truly converted, who will be my Joy and Crown of rejoicing in the Day of the Lord JESUS.—</P>
<P>In about three Weeks I went to <HI>Bristol</HI> to take leave of some more of my Relations who lived there. As it was my constant Practice, go where I would, to attend on the daily publick Offices of the Church, I went, the <HI>Thursday</HI> after my coming, to hear a Lecture Sermon at <HI>St. John'</HI>s Church. Whilst the Psalm was singing, after Prayers, the Minister came to my Seat, and asked
<PB N="19" REF="005886_0018_10275DF10E6B21B0"/>
me to give the Congregation a Sermon. Having my Notes about me, I complyed. The Hearers seem'd startled, and after Ser∣mon enquiry was made, who I was? The next Day there was another Lecture at <HI>St. Stephens.</HI> Many crowded thither in Ex∣pectation of hearing me again. The Lec∣turer asked me to preach as the other did the Day before. I again complyed, and the Alarm given here was so general, that on the following Lord's Day, many of all denominations were obliged to return from the Churches where I preach'd, for want of Room. Afterwards I was called by the Mayor to preach before him and the Cor∣poration. And for some Time following, I preached all the Lectures on the Week Days, and twice on <HI>Sundays,</HI> besides visiting the Religious Societies. The Word, thro' the Mighty Power of God, was sharper than a two edged Sword. The Doctrine of the <HI>New Birth</HI> and <HI>Justification</HI> by <HI>Faith in Jesus Christ</HI> (tho' I was not so clear in it as after∣wards) made its way like Lightning into the Hearers Consciences. The <HI>Arrows</HI> of <HI>Conviction</HI> stuck fast; and my whole Time between one Lecture and another, except what was spent in necessary Refreshment,
<PB N="20" REF="005886_0019_10275DF54EC710D8"/>
was wholly taken up in talking with poor Souls under concern. Large offers were made me if I would stay at <HI>Bristol;</HI> and many I believe would have almost plucked out their own Eyes to have given me! All wondered that I would go to <HI>Georgia,</HI> who might be so well provided for at home! And some urged, if I had a Mind to con∣vert <HI>Indians,</HI> I might go amongst the <HI>King'</HI>s-<HI>Wood-Colliers,</HI> and find <HI>Indians</HI> enough. But none of these Things moved me. Hav∣ing put my Hand to the Plow, I was de∣termined thro' divine Grace, not to look back. And therefore, at length, I took my leave, but with what mutual Affection and Concern cannot easily be expressed.</P>
<P>During my stay at <HI>Bristol</HI> I made a lit∣tle Elopement to <HI>Bath,</HI> where I was kindly received by a Dear Friend the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Chapman,</HI> and some Elect and honourable Women who befriended the <HI>Oxford</HI> Me∣thodists. I preach'd at the Abbey Church twice.—The late Doctor <HI>Cockman</HI> was pleased to thank me for my Sermon; and Application was made to me by several to print both my Discourses. But I scarce al∣lowed such a Thought to enter, much less to lodge within my Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="005886_0020_10275DF838BA52D8"/>
It was now about the middle of <HI>February. Lent</HI> was at Hand, and I was obliged to be at <HI>Oxford</HI> to perform the Remainder of my College-Exercise, which they call <HI>De∣termining.</HI> I went through <HI>Gloucester,</HI> as it lay in my Way, and abode there a Week, visiting the Prisoners, and encouraging the awakened Souls. Having staid about ten Days at the University, I took, as I thought, my last Farewell of my Dear Friends, and came up to <HI>London</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>March,</HI> in order to wait up∣on <HI>James Oglethorp</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> and the Honourable <HI>Trustees.</HI> I was kindly received by both. The former introduced me to his Grace the present <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Arthur Bedford,</HI> at the Desire of the latter, (with whom I dined at their publick Anniversary) went with me to the present Lord Bishop of <HI>London.</HI> Both approved of my going abroad, the former was pleased to say, <Q>He would take particular Notice of such as went to <HI>Georgia,</HI> if they did not go out of any <HI>Si∣nister</HI> View.</Q> This put me upon enquiry what were my Motives in going? And, af∣ter the strictest Examination, my Consci∣ence answer'd, <Q><HI>Not to please any Man
<PB N="22" REF="005886_0021_10275DF9C39CF128"/>
living upon Earth, nor out of any sinister View; but simply to comply with what I believe to be thy Will, O God, and to promote thy Glory, thou great Shepherd and Bishop of Souls.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I continued at <HI>London</HI> about three Weeks, waiting for Mr. <HI>Oglethorp,</HI> who expected to sail every Day. In this Season I preach∣ed more frequently than when there before. Many more came to hear me, and the last <HI>Sunday</HI> I was in Town, I read Prayers twice, and preached four Times.—But find∣ing Mr. <HI>Oglethorp</HI> was not likely to go for some time, and having lain under particular Obligations to the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Sampson Harris,</HI> Minister of <HI>Stone House,</HI> in <HI>Glou∣cester-shire,</HI> I went down thither, at his Re∣quest, to supply his Place, whilst he came up to dispatch some Affairs in Town.</P>
<P>Hither I had reason to think God sent me in Answer to Prayer: For there was a little sweet Society of seeking Souls, who had heard me preach at an adjacent Town, and wrestled with God, if it was his Will, to send me a∣mongst them. They received me with all Joy, and most of the Parishioners were very civil when I came to visit them from House to House. Upon Examination I found them
<PB N="23" REF="005886_0022_10275D152E516C00"/>
more knowing than I expected. Their Pastor had used to catechise the little ones in the Summer Season, and expound the four Lessons every Lord's Day in the Church. I followed his▪ good Example, and found great Freedom and Assistance given me both in my publick and private Administrations. Having the Use of the Parsonage House, I expounded every Night. Many that were not Parishioners came to hear, and were edified. On <HI>Sundays,</HI> be∣sides expounding the Lessons, catechising and preaching, I repeated my Sermons to the Society. Neither Church or House could contain the People that came. I found uncommon Manifestations granted me from above. Early in the Morning, at Noon Day, Evening, and Midnight, nay all the Day long, did the Blessed JESUS visit and refresh my Heart. Could the Trees of a certain Wood, near <HI>Stone-House,</HI> speak, they would tell what sweet Commu∣nion I and some more dear Souls enjoyed with the ever Blessed God there. Some∣times as I have been walking, my Soul would make such Sallies as tho' it would go out of the Body. At other Times I would be so overpowered with a Sense of
<PB N="24" REF="005886_0023_10275DFCD8A6AF28"/>
God's infinite Majesty, that I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e constrained to throw myself prostrate on the Ground, and offer my Soul as a Blank in his Hands, to write on it what he pleas∣ed. One Night was a Time never to be forgotten. It happened to lighten exceed∣ingly. I had been expounding to many People, and some being afraid to go home, I thought it my Duty to accompany them, and improve the Occasion, to stir them up to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man. But O what did my Soul feel! In my return to the Parsonage House, whilst others were rising from their Beds and frightned almost to Death, to see the Light∣ning run upon the Ground, and shine from one Part of the Heaven unto the other, I and another, a poor, but pious, Country∣man, were in the field, praying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, prais∣ing of, and exulting in our God, and long∣ing for that Time when JESUS should be revealed from Heaven in a Flame of Fire! Oh that my Soul may be in a like Frame when He shall actually come to call me! For I think I never had been happier than that Night, or, all Things considered, more Bless∣ed than during my abode at <HI>Stone-House.</HI> E∣very Week the Congregations increased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="25" REF="005886_0024_10275D2585034F58"/>
on <HI>Ascension</HI> Day, when I took my Leave, the Concern they shewed at my Depar∣ture was inexpressible. Their Sighs and Tears almost broke my Heart. Many cried out with <HI>Ruth, Whither thou goest I will go, where thou lodgest I will lodge.</HI> But I only took one with me who proved a good Servant, and is, I believe, a true Follower of the ever Blessed JESUS.</P>
<P>The Incumbent being returned from <HI>London,</HI> and the People of <HI>Bristol</HI> having given me repeated Invitations, nay having insisted upon my coming again, since the Time of my embarking was deferred, On <HI>May</HI> 23d. I paid them a second Visit. Multitudes came on Foot, and many in Coaches a Mile without the City to meet me▪ and almost all saluted and blessed me as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> along the Street. Upon my coming here I received Letters from <HI>Lon∣don</HI> informing me, that Mr. <HI>Oglethorp</HI> would not embark these two Months. This gladen'd many Hearts, tho' I cannot say it did mine; because I counted the Hours, as it were, till I went abroad. I preached as usual about five Times a Week; but the Congregations grew, if possible, larger and larger. It was wonderful to
<PB N="26" REF="005886_0025_10275E0423366F50"/>
see how the People hung upon the Rails of the Organ-Loft, climb'd upon the Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of the Church, and made the Church itself so hot with their Breath, that the Steam would fall from the Pillars like Drops of Rain. Sometimes almost as many would go away for want of Room as came in, and it was with great Difficulty I got into the Desk to read Prayers, or preach. Per∣sons of all Denominations flocked to hear. Persons of all Ranks, not only publickly attended my Ministry, but gave me private Invitations to their Houses. A private So∣ciety or two were erected. I preached and collected for the poor Prisoners in <HI>New-gate</HI> twice or thrice a Week, and many made me large offers if I would not go abroad.</P>
<P>During my stay here I paid another Vi∣sit to <HI>Bath,</HI> and preach'd three Times in the <HI>Abbey-Church,</HI> and once in <HI>Queen'</HI>s <HI>Chap∣pel.</HI> People crowded and were affected as at <HI>Bristol.</HI> And God stirred up some elect Ladies to give upwards of a <HI>Hundred and Sixty Pounds</HI> for the Poor of <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21<HI>st</HI> I took my last Farewell at <HI>Bristol.</HI> But when I came to tell them, It might be, that they would <HI>see my Face no more,</HI> high and low, young and old
<PB N="27" REF="005886_0026_10275D354893D0E8"/>
burst into such a Flood of Tears as I had never seen before; Drops fell from their Eyes like Rain, or rather gushed out like Water out of the Stony Rock. Multi∣tudes after Sermon followed me home weep∣ing; and the next Day I was empoyled from Seven in the Morning till Midnight in talk∣ing and giving spiritual Advice to awakned Souls.</P>
<P>About three the next Morning, having thrown myself on the Bed for an Hour or two, I set out for <HI>Gloucester,</HI> because I heard that a great Company on Horseback and in Coaches intended to see me out of Town. Some finding themselves disap∣pointed, followed me thither, where I staid a few Days and preached to a very crowded Auditory. Then I went on to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where we had, as it were, a general Rendez∣vouz of the <HI>Methodists;</HI> and, finding their Interest flourishing, and being impatient to go abroad, I hastened away, after taking a most affectionate Leave, and came to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> about the End of <HI>August,</HI> I hope, in some Degree, thankful for the great Things the Lord had done for me in the Country.</P>
<P>Every Hour now seem'd a Week, and every Week a Year till I was embarked.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005886_0027_10275E08C4E05A20"/>
I knew there was no Minister at <HI>Frederica,</HI> for which Place I was then appointed, and I did not care to be absent longer from my proper Charge. Mr. <HI>Oglethorp'</HI>s going was still retarded, and I had thought it my Duty to go immediately without him, had not he and my other Friends urged, that the Soldiers would shortly embark, and that I had best go over with them. This some∣what pacified me, and having now taken a final farewel of all Friends in the Coun∣try, I was resolved to abide at <HI>London,</HI> and give myself wholly to Prayer, the Study of the Scriptures, and my own Heart, till the Soldiers should embark.</P>
<P>The House I lodged at, was good old Mr. <HI>Hutton'</HI>s in <HI>College-street, Westminster,</HI> where I had the Pleasure of seeing my Dear Friend Mr. <HI>Ingham,</HI> lately returned from <HI>Georgia;</HI> and perceiving him, as I thought, remarkably grown in Grace. I long'd still more to be sent to the same School, hop∣ing to catch some of that Holy Flame with which his Soul was fired. We freely and solemnly conversed together about my Call abroad. It seem'd to both quite clear, though we could have wish'd, had it been the Divine Will, to have
<PB N="29" REF="005886_0028_10275D442D9E3130"/>
lived and died together. Our Hearts were knit to each other, like the Hearts of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jonathan.</HI> At midnight we would rise to sing Praises to God, and in∣tercede for the whole State of CHRIST'S Church militant here on Earth.</P>
<P>With this my Dear Friend, I one Day paid a Visit to a worthy Doctor of Di∣vinity near <HI>London,</HI> who introduced us to some Honourable Ladies, who, as I had heard, delighted in doing good. It being my constant Practice to improve my Ac∣quaintance with the Rich for the Benefit of the Poor, I recommended two poor Clergy∣men, and another pious Person to their Cha∣rity. They said little, but between them, unknown to each other, they gave, I think, <HI>Thirty Six Guineas.</HI> When we came to the Doctor's House and saw the Ladies Libe∣rality, he said, <Q>If you had not spoke for others, you would have had a good deal of that yourself.</Q> God gave me to rejoice that I had nothing, and the Poor all. The next Day, upon my return to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> in the first Letter that I opened, was a Bank-note of Ten Pounds, sent from an unexpected hand as a present for myself. This I took as a Hint from Providence to
<PB N="30" REF="005886_0029_10275E0FEB6E7438"/>
go on doing good to others, with a full As∣surance that the Lord would not let me want. Blessed be his Name I have had many such Instances of his tender Concern for my temporal, as well as my eternal Wellfare.</P>
<P>About this Time, thro' the Importuity of Friends, and Aspersions of Enemies, I was prevailed upon to print my Sermon <HI>On the Nature and Necessity of our Regene∣ration or New-Birth in CHRIST JESUS,</HI> which under God began the awakening at <HI>London, Bristol, Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Gloucester∣shire.</HI> The Dissenters I found were sur∣prized to see a Sermon on such a Subject from a Clergyman of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and finding the Author came from <HI>Oxford,</HI> were ready to say, (how justly I will not determine) <Q><HI>Can any good come out of</HI> Nazareth?</Q> This Sermon sold well to Persons of all Denominations, and was dispersed very much in many Parts both at Home and Abroad. A second Im∣pression was soon called for; and finding another of my Sermons was printed without my leave, and in a very incorrect Manner, at <HI>Bristol,</HI> I was obliged to publish in my own Defence, and afterwards thought I
<PB N="31" REF="005886_0030_10275E1173E4AEE8"/>
had a clear Call to print any other Discourses, tho' in themselves mean, that I found blessed to the good of Souls.</P>
<P>But to return to my publick Admini∣strations. Being determined to abide in <HI>London</HI> till the Time of my Departure, I followed my usual Practice of reading and praying over the Word of God upon my Knees. Sweet was this Retirement to my Soul, but it was not of long Continuance—Invitations were given me to preach at se∣veral Places—The Stewards and Members of the Religious Societies were very fond of hearing me,—I was invited to preach at <HI>Crip∣plegate,</HI> St. <HI>Ann'</HI>s, and <HI>Forster-lane Churches,</HI> at Six on the Lord's Day Morning, and to assist in administring the Holy Sacrament—I embraced the Invitations, and so many came, that sometimes we were obliged to conse∣crate fresh Elements two or three Times, and the Stewards found it somewhat difficult to carry the Offerings to the Communion Table—I also preach'd at <HI>Wapping-Chappel,</HI> the <HI>Tower, Lud-gate, New-gate,</HI> and many of the Churches where weekly Lectures were kept up—The Congregations con∣tinually increased, and generally, of a Lord's Day, I used to preach four Times to
<PB N="32" REF="005886_0031_10275D500E0B94C0"/>
very large, and very affected Auditories, besides reading Prayers twice or thrice, and walking, perhaps, twelve Miles in going backwards and forwards from one Church to the other—But God made my Feet like Hinds Feet, and filled me with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> un∣speakable at the End of my Day's Work—This made me look upon my Friend's kind Advice which they gave me, <HI>to spare my∣self,</HI> as a Temptation—For I found by daily Experience the more I did, the more I might do for God—</P>
<P>About the latter End of <HI>August,</HI> finding there were many young Men belonging to the Societies that attended my Administra∣tions, I enter'd into one of their singing Societies, hoping thereby to ingratiate my∣self the more, and have greater Opportuni∣ties of doing them good—It answer'd my Design—Our Lord gave me to spiritualize their singing—And after they had taught me the <HI>Gamut,</HI> they would gladly hear me teach them some of the Mysteries of the <HI>New-Birth,</HI> and the <HI>Necessity of living to God</HI>—Many sweet Nights we spent toge∣ther in this Way—And many of these Youths afterwards, to all Appearance, walk'd with God, and will, I trust, join the hea∣venly
<PB N="33" REF="005886_0032_10275E18C8B8FC88"/>
Choir in singing Praises to the Lamb, and him that sitteth upon the Throne for ever.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>September</HI> my Name was first put into the publick <HI>News∣Papers,</HI> but upon what particular Occasion I cannot now recollect—The <HI>Sunday</HI> be∣fore, with great Reluctance, I was prevail∣ed on to preach a Charity Sermon, at <HI>Wap∣ping Chapel</HI>—The Congregation was very large, and more was collected than had been for many Years upon a like Occasion. This got Air—My Friends improved the Occasion, and entreated me to preach ano∣ther Charity Sermon at Sir <HI>George Wheeler'</HI>s <HI>Chapel</HI>—I absolutely refused; but at length thro' the Importunity of Mr. <HI>Habersham,</HI> since my faithful Assistant in the <HI>Orphan∣House,</HI> I agreed to do it—I discoursed upon the <HI>Widow'</HI>s <HI>giving her two Mites</HI>—God bowed the Hearts of the Hearers as the Heart of one Man—Almost all, as I was told, by the Collectors, offered most willingly—Scarce one appeared before the Lord empty—This still drew on fresh Applications. The <HI>Sunday</HI> following I preached in the Evening at St. <HI>Swithens,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="005886_0033_10275E1A4EFE0B10"/>
where <HI>Eight Pounds</HI> were collected instead of <HI>Ten Shillings</HI>—The next Morning, as I was at Breakfast with a Friend at the <HI>Tower,</HI> I read in one of the <HI>News-Papers,</HI> <Q><HI>That there was a young Gentleman going Volun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier to</HI> Georgia: <HI>That he had preach∣ed at St.</HI> Swithins, <HI>and collected</HI> Eight Pounds <HI>instead of</HI> Ten Shillings; <HI>three Pounds of which were in Half pence: And that he was to preach next</HI> Wednesday <HI>be∣fore the Societies, at their General Quarterly Meeting.</HI></Q> This Advertisement chagrined me very much—I immediately sent to the Printer, desiring he would put me in his Pa∣per no more—His Answer was, That <Q><HI>He was paid for doing it, and he would not loose</HI> Two Shillings <HI>for any Body.</HI></Q> By this means Peoples Curiosity was stirred up more and more—On the <HI>Wednesday</HI> Evening <HI>Bow-Church,</HI> in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> was crowded exceedingly—I preached my Ser∣mon on early Piety, and at the Request of the Societies printed it—Hence for∣wards, for near three Months successively, there was no End of People's flocking to hear the Word of God—The Church-Wardens, and Managers of the Charity-Schools
<PB N="35" REF="005886_0034_10275E1D2B5932D0"/>
perceiving what Effect my preach∣ing had upon the Populace, were continu∣ally applying to me to preach for the Bene∣fit of the Children—And as I was to em∣bark shortly, they procured the Liberty of the Churches on the Week Days; a Thing never known before—I have some∣times had more than a dozen Names of different Churches, at which I promised to preach, upon my Slate Book at once—And when I preached, Constables were obliged to be placed at the Door to keep the People in order—The Sight of the Congregati∣ons was very awful,—One might, as it were, walk upon the Peoples Heads, and Thou∣sands went away from the largest Churches for want of room. They were all Atten∣tion when the Word was delivered, and heard like People hearing for Eternity—I now preached generally nine Times a Week. The early Sacraments were exceeding aw∣ful. At <HI>Cripple Gate, St. Ann's,</HI> and <HI>Forster Lane,</HI> how often have we seen JESUS CHRIST crucified, and evidently set forth before us! On <HI>Sunday</HI> Mornings, long before Day, you might see Streets filled with Peo∣ple going to Church, with their Lantherns in their Hands, and hear them conversing
<PB N="36" REF="005886_0035_10275E0136C21CB8"/>
about the Things of God.—Other Lecture Churches, near at hand, would be filled with Persons that could not come where I was preaching: And those that did come, were so deeply affected that they were like Persons struck with pointed Arrows, or mourning for a first born Child! People gave so liberally to the Charity Schools, that this Season near a Thousand Pounds Sterling was collected at the several Churches, besides many private Contributions and Sub∣scriptions sent in afterwards—I always preached Gratis, and gave myself. The <HI>Blue-Coat</HI> Boys and Girls looked upon me as their great Benefactor; and I believe fre∣quently sent up their Infant Cries in my behalf. Worthy Mr. <HI>Seeward,</HI> afterwards my dear <HI>Fellow-Traveller,</HI> was their hearty Friend and Advocate.—He was concern∣ed in above Twenty Charity Schools; and, as I found some Months afterwards, in∣certed the Paragraph that so chagrined me. The Tide of Popularity now began to run very high,—In a short Time I could no longer walk on Foot as usual; but was constrained to go in a Coach from Place to Place to avoid the <HI>Hosannas</HI> of the Multitude.—They grew quite extra∣vagant
<PB N="37" REF="005886_0036_10275E200C6AE4E0"/>
in their Applauses, and had it not been for my compassionate High-Priest, po∣pularity would have destroyed me: But he knew it was quite unthought of and unsought by me—I used therefore to plead with and intreat him, to take me by the Hand and lead me unhurt thro' this fiery Furnace!—He heard my Request, gave me to see the Vanity of all Commen∣dations but his own, and, in some Measure, enabled me to give back all the Respect I received, to that Fountain from whence it had its Source.—</P>
<P>Not that all spoke well of me,—No, as my Popularity increased, Opposition in∣creased also—At first many of the Clergy were my Hearers and Admirers: But some soon grew Angry, and Complaints were made that the Churches were so crowded, that there was no room for the Parishioners, and that the Pews were spoiled—Some called me a spiritual Pick-Pocket, and o∣thers thought I made use of a kind of a Charm to get the People's Money—A Report was spread abroad, that the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> upon the Complaint of the Cler∣gy, intended to Silence me.—I immediately waited upon his Lordship, and enquired,
<PB N="38" REF="005886_0037_10275E244E1A4678"/>
whether any Complaint of this Nature had been lodged against me? He answered, "<HI>No.</HI>" I asked h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Lordship whether any Objection could be made against my Doctrine? He said, <Q><HI>No: For he knew a Clergyman who had heard me preach a plain Scriptural Sermon.</HI></Q> I asked his Lordship, whether he would grant me a Licence? He said, <Q>I <HI>Needed none, since I was going to</HI> Georgia,</Q> I replied, <Q>Then your Lordship would not forbid me?</Q> He gave me a satisfactory Answer, and I took my leave.—Soon after this, two Cler∣gymen sent for me, and told me, they would not let me preach in their Pulpits any more, unless I renounced that part of my Sermon on <HI>Regeneration,</HI> wherein I wished, <Q><HI>That my Brethren would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tertain their Audi∣tories oftener with Discourses upon the New-Birth.</HI></Q>—This I had no freedom to do, and so they continued my opposers—What I believe irritated some of my Ene∣mies the more, was my free Conversation with many of the serious Dissenters, who invited me to their Houses, and repeatedly told me, <Q><HI>That if the Doctrine of the</HI> New-Birth <HI>and</HI> Justification by Faith, <HI>was preached powerfully in the Church, there would be
<PB N="39" REF="005886_0038_10275E272FF43EC0"/>
but few Dissenters in</HI> England.</Q>—My Practice in visiting and associating with them I thought was quite agreeable to the Word of God.—Their Conversation was sa∣voury, and I thought the best Way to bring them over, was not by Bigotry and Railing, but Moderation and Love, and undissembled Holiness of Life.—But these Reasons were of no avail.—One Minister called me <HI>prag∣matical Rascal,</HI> and vehemently inveighed against the whole Body of Dissenters.—This stirred up the Peoples Corruptions, and having an overweening Fondness for me, whenever they came to Church and found that I did not preach, some of them would go out again—This Spirit I always endea∣voured to quell, and made a Sermon on purpose, from those Words, <HI>take heed how ye hear.</HI>—One time upon hearing that a Church-Warden intended to take eight Pounds a Year from his Parish Minister, because he refused to let me preach his Lecture, I composed a Sermon upon those Words, <HI>Love your Enemies;</HI> and deliver∣ed it where I knew the Church-Warden would be—It had its desired Effect—He came after Sermon and told me, he was convinced by my Discourse that he should
<PB N="40" REF="005886_0039_10275E05ABC7C380"/>
not resent the Injury the Doctor had done me, and then thanked me for my Care—Nor was I without Opposition from Friends, who were jealous over me with a Godly Jealousy.—For I carried high sail, Thousands and Thousands came to hear. My Ser∣mons were every where called for. News came from Time to Time of the springing Up and increase of the Seed sown in <HI>Bristol, Gloucester,</HI> and elsewhere. Large offers were made me if I would stay in <HI>England.</HI>—And all the Opposition I met with, join'd with the Consciousness of my private daily Infirmities, were but <HI>Ballast</HI> little enough to keep me from oversetting.</P>
<P>However, the Lord (Oh infinite Conde∣scension!) was pleased to be with and bless me Day by Day.—I had a sweet knot of Religious Friends, with whom I first at∣tempted to pray extempore.—Some Time I think in <HI>October,</HI> we began to set apart an Hour every Evening to intercede with the Great Head of the Church for carrying on the Work begun, and for the Circle of our Acquaintance, according as we knew their Circumstances required.—I was their Mouth unto God, and he only knows what Enlargement I felt in that Divine

Employ. Once we spent a whole Night in Prayer and Praise; and many a Time, at Midnight and at one in the Morning, after I have been wearied almost to Death in Preaching, Writing, and Conversation, and going from Place to Place, God imparted new Life to my Soul, and would enable me to intercede with him for an Hour and a Half and two Hours together.—The Sweetness of this Exercise made me com∣pose my Sermon upon <HI>Intercession;</HI> and I cannot think it Presumption to give it as my Opinion, that partly, at least, in Answer to Prayers, then put up by his dear Children, the Word for some Years past, has ran and been glorified, not only in <HI>England</HI> but in many other Parts of the World.</P>
<P>It was now, I think, that I was prevailed on to sit for my Picture.—The Occasion was this—Some ill minded Persons had painted me leaning on a Cushion, with a Bishop looking very enviously over my Shoulder.—At the Bottom were Six Lines, in one of which the Bishops were stiled <HI>Mitred Drones.</HI>—The same Person publish∣ed in the Papers that I had sat for it.—This I looked upon as the snare of the Devil to incense the Clergy against me. I consulted
<PB N="42" REF="005886_0041_10275E0BAD544368"/>
Friends what to do. They told me I must sit for my Picture in my own De∣fence.—At the same Time my aged Mother laid her Commands upon me to do so in a Letter, urging <Q><HI>That if I would not let her have the Substance, I would leave her at least the Shadow.</HI></Q> She also mention'd the Painter, and meeting with him one Night very accidentally, I at length with great Reluctance complied, and endeavour∣ed, whilst the Painter was drawing my Face, to employ my Time, in beseeching the great God by his Holy Spirit to paint his Blessed Image upon his and my Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Christmas</HI> now drew near.—Notice was given me that the Soldiers were almost ready to embark for <HI>Georgia,</HI> Mr. <HI>Oglethorp</HI> being yet detained, I was resolved to throw myself into the Hands of God and go with the Soldiers. But the nearer the Time of my Departure approached, the more af∣fectionate and eager the People grew.—There was no end of Persons coming to me under Soul concern. I preached and God blessed me more and more, and support∣ed me for some time with but very little Sleep.</P>
<P>At the Beginning of <HI>Christmas</HI> Week I took my Leave: But Oh what Groans and
<PB N="43" REF="005886_0042_10275E14545F64A0"/>
Sighs were to be heard when I said "Fi∣nally, Brethren, Farewell!'. At great St. <HI>Helen'</HI>s, the Cry was amazing. I was near half an Hour going out to the Door. All Ranks gave vent to their Passions. Thou∣sands and Thousands of Prayers were put up for me. They would run and stop me in the Allies, hugg me in their Arms, and follow me with wishful Looks. Once in the <HI>Christmas</HI> before my Departure, with many others, I spent a Night in Prayer and Praise; and in the Morning helped to ad∣minister the Sacrament at St. <HI>Dunstans,</HI> as I used to do on Saint's Days—But such a Sacrament I never before saw.—The Tears of the Communicants mingled with the Cup, and had not JESUS given us some of his New Wine to drink to comfort our Hearts, our parting would have almost been insup∣portable. At length <HI>December</HI> 28th I left <HI>London,</HI> and went in the Strength of God, as a Poor <HI>Pilgrim,</HI> on board the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> after having preached in a good Part of the <HI>London</HI> Churches, collected about a Thou∣sand Pounds for the Charity Schools, and got upwards of three Hundred Pounds Sterling for the Poor of <HI>Georgia</HI> among my Friends, for which I have since publickly accompted.
<PB N="44" REF="005886_0043_10275E2A43623600"/>
At the same Time God raised me a Suf∣ficiency to supply my own temporal Ne∣cessities; and gave me repeated Proofs, that <HI>if we seek first the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness, all other Things</HI> (I mean Food and Raiment, which is all a Christian should desire) <HI>shall be added unto us.</HI>—For which and all his other unmerited Mercies, I de∣sire to praise him in Time, and magnify his holy Name, thro' the boundless Ages of Eternity.</P>
<P>Some particulars that befell me whilst abroad, and how this Tide of Popularity rose still higher at my return home: How I came to commence a Field Preacher, and part with many Friends, who were as Dear to me as my own Soul: How they that would now have plucked out their Eyes and have given 'em unto me, afterwards accounted me their Enemy be∣cause I told them the Truth: By what Means the Seed now sown sprang up and grew into a great Tree, both in <HI>Eng∣land, Scotland</HI> and <HI>America:</HI> How Divisi∣ons arose among God's People, and what were the Effects and Consequences of them, All this I say must be reserved for another Tract, if God should continue my Life and

Strength, and give me Leisure and Freedom to prosecute and finish it.</P>
<P>In the mean while, let me exhort thee, O Reader, if serious and a Child of God, to bless him for what he has done for my Soul: Or if thou art yet in the Gall of Bit∣terness, and, thro' Prejudice, thinkest that I have either not told Truth, or wrote out of a vain glorious View, let me only intreat thee to suspend thy Judgment for a little while, and JESUS shall decide the Questi∣on. At His TRIBUNALL we shall meet, and there thou shall know what is in my Heart, and what were the Motives which led me out to such a publick Scene of Life. At present I will trouble thee no more; but beg thee whether serious or not to en∣deavour to calm thy Spirit by singing or reading over the following Lines, translated by that Sweet Singer of <HI>Israel,</HI> and my worthy and Honoured Friend Doctor <HI>Watts.</HI></P>

<HEAD>BRIEF ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bethesda,</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 21st. 1745</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My very Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT being now some Months since I ar∣rived here, I think it high time, ac∣cording to my Promise, to send you as explicite an Account a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I well can, of the <HI>Rise, Progress</HI> and <HI>Present Situation</HI> of the <HI>Orphan-House,</HI> where I now am.—Some have thought that the erecting such a Building was only the Produce of my own Brain: But they are much mistaken. For it was first proposed to me by my dear Friend the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Charles Wesley,</HI> who with his Excellency General <HI>Oglethorp,</HI> had concerted a Scheme for carrying on such a
<PB N="52" REF="005886_0048_10275E375EBB2830"/>
Design before I had any Thoughts of going abroad myself. It was natural to think, that as the Government intended this Province for the Refuge and Support of many of our poor Countrymen, that Numbers of such Adventurers must necessarily be taken off, by being exposed to the Hardships which unavoidably attend a new Settlement. I thought it therefore a noble Design in the General to erect a House for fatherless Chil∣dren. And believing such a Provision for Orphans would be some Inducement with many to come over, I fell in with the De∣sign, when mention'd to me by my Friend, and was resolved, in they Strength of God, to prosecute it with all my might.—This was mention'd to the Honourable the Trustees. They took it kindly at my Hands; and as I then began to be pretty popular at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and else where, they wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> for leave for me to preach a Charity Sermon on this Occasion in the <HI>Abby Church.</HI> This was granted, and I accordingly began im∣mediately to compose a suitable Discourse. But knowing my first stay at <HI>Georgia</HI> would necessarily be short, on account of my re∣turning again to take Priest's Orders, I
<PB N="53" REF="005886_0049_10275E3BAA4F11E8"/>
thought it most prudent first to go and see for my self, and defer prosecuting the Scheme till I came home; because I could then be better able to judge, whether the Scheme was practicable, and consequently could be able to recommend it with the greater Earnestness.—When I came to <HI>Geor∣gia</HI> I found many poor Orphans, who, tho' taken Notice of by the Honourable Trustees, yet thro' the Neglect of Persons that acted under them, were in miserable Circum∣stances.—For want of a House to breed them up in, the poor little Ones were tabled out here and there, and besides the Hurt they received by bad Examples, forgot at home what they learnt at School.—Others were at hard Services, and likely to have no Education at all.—Upon seeing this, and finding that his Majesty and Parliament had the Interest of this Colony much at Heart, I thought I could not better shew my regard to God and my Country, than by getting a House and Land for these Chil∣dren, where they might learn to labour, read and write, and at the same Time be brought up in the Nurture and Admoniti∣on of the Lord.—Accordingly at my re∣turn to <HI>England,</HI> in the Year 1738, to take
<PB N="54" REF="005886_0050_10275E3E93B7DDE8"/>
Priests Orders, I applied to the Honoura∣ble Society for a grant of 500 Acres of Land, and laid myself under an Obligation to build a House upon it, and to receive from Time to Time as many Orphans as the Land and Stock would maintain. As I had always acted like a Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> having preached in a good Part of the <HI>London</HI> Churches, and but a few Months before collected near a Thousand Pounds Sterling, for the Children belonging to the Charity Schools in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster;</HI> it was natural to think, that I might now have the Use at least of some of these Churches to preach in for the Orphans hereafter more immediately to be committed to my Care.—But by that time I had taken Priests Orders, the Spirit of the Clergy began to be much imbittered.—Churches were gradually denied me—And I must let this good Design drop, and Thousands (I might add ten Thousands) go without hearing the Word of God, or preach in the Fields.—Indeed two Churches one in <HI>London, viz. Spittle-fields,</HI> and one in <HI>Bristol, viz.</HI> St. <HI>Philips</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> were lent me upon this Occasion; but those were all.—However, God kept me from being
<PB N="55" REF="005886_0051_10275E401C3EB680"/>
discouraged.—I collected for the Orphan-House in <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> Two and Fifty Pounds one Sabbath Day Morning; Twenty Two Pounds of which was in Copper. It would have rejoiced your Heart to see the People give.—They offered willingly, and took more pains to come through the crowd and put their Contributions into my Hatt, than some would to have got them.—Thousands of Prayers were put up with the Alms that were given, and I trust both went up as a Memorial before God. In the After∣noon I collected again at <HI>Kennington Com∣mon,</HI> and continued to do so at most of the Places where I preached. Besides this, two or three of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> and several Persons of Distinction contributed, till at length, having gotten about a Thousand and ten Pounds, I gave over collecting, and went with what I had to <HI>Georgia.</HI> At that time multitudes offered to accompany me; but I chose to take over only a Surgeon and a few more of both Sexes, that I thought would be useful in carrying on my Design. These chearfully embarked with me, desir∣ing nothing for their Pains, but Food and Raiment, My Dear Fellow-Traveller, <HI>Wil∣liam Seward,</HI> <ABBR>Esq;</ABBR> also joined with them,
<PB N="56" REF="005886_0052_10275E4300398690"/>
and was particularly useful to me on this Occasion. Our first Voyage was to <HI>Phila∣delphia,</HI> where I was w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing to go for the sake of laying in Provision. Having a Cap∣tain of a Ship with me, who had been my spiritual Child, by his Advice, I laid out in <HI>London</HI> a good Part of the Thousand Pounds for Goods; and by his Care and my other Fellow-Travellers, without any trou∣ble to myself, got as much by them at <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI> as nearly defrayed the Family's Expence of coming over. Here God bless∣ed my Ministry daily, and begun that Work in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which, I am persuaded, will be remembred thro' the Endless Ages of Eternity. <HI>January</HI> following 1739 I met my Family at <HI>Georgia,</HI> and being unwilling to lose any time, I hired a large House, and took in all the Orphans I could find in the Colony, A great many also of the Town's Children came to School gratis, and many poor People that could not maintain their Children, upon Application, had leave given them to send their little ones for a Month or two, or more, as they could spare them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at length my Family consisted of between 60 and 70. Most of the Orphans were in poor Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and three or four almost
<PB N="57" REF="005886_0053_10275E44E96C2FE0"/>
eat up with Lice—I likewise erected an <HI>In∣firmary,</HI> in which many sick People were cured and taken care of Gratis. I have now by me a List of upwards of a Hundred and Thirty Patients, which were under the Surgeon's Hands, exclusive of my own private Family. This Surgeon I furnished with all proper Druggs and Utensils, which put me to no small Expence: And this was still increased by clearing Land, buying Stock, and building a large Dwelling House Sixty by Forty, and Out Houses, commo∣dious for a large Family to live in. Some∣times (Labourers and all) I have had a Hundred and Twenty to provide for daily▪ My Friends as well as myself, seem'd to have particular Courage and Faith given us for the Season; and we went on chearfully, believing that he for whose sake we began, would enable us to finish this good Work. About <HI>March</HI> I began the great House, hav∣ing only about One Hundred and Fifty Pounds in Cash. I called it <HI>Bethesda,</HI> be∣cause I hoped it would be a House of Mercy to many Souls. Blessed be God we have not been disappointed of our Hope. It has proved a House of Mercy indeed to many.
<PB N="58" REF="005886_0054_10275E4BCFE03580"/>
Several of our Labourers, as well as Visitors, have (in a Judgment of Charity) been born of God here, and given evident Proofs of it, by bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit. Many Boys have been put out to Trades, and many Girls put out to Service. I had the Pleasure the other Day of seeing three Boys work at the House in which they were bred, one of them out of his Time a Jour∣neyman, and the others serving under their Masters. One that I brought from <HI>New-England</HI> is handsomely settled in <HI>Carolina;</HI> and another from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is married and lives very comfortably at <HI>Savannah.</HI> How so large a Family has been supported in such a Colony, without any visible Fund, is wonderful! I am surprized when I look back, and see how for these six Years last past, God has spread a Table in the Wil∣derness for so many Persons. Were all the particular Providences that have attended this Work recorded, perhaps they would be found not inferior to those mentioned by Professor <HI>Frank,</HI> in his <HI>Pietas Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lensis,</HI> whose Memory is very precious to me, and whose Example has a Thousand Times been blessed to strengthen and encourage me in the carrying on this Enterprize.
<PB N="59" REF="005886_0055_10275E4D582FC5C0"/>
Hereafter perhaps when I have more Lei∣sure, I may give you an Account of some of them—My being detained so long in <HI>England</HI> has been a little detrimental to me, my Friends not knowing so well how to act, because they expected to see me daily. And I cannot yet say that I have surmount∣ed the first Years Expence, which indeed was very great, and greater no doubt than it would be now, after my Friends have had so many Years Experience in the Co∣lony.—However I doubt not but by the Blessing of God, in a short Time to pay off my Arrears, and then the Family will be maintained at a small Expence.—My stand∣ing Annual Charges, are now but trifling to what they have been; and my Friends have raised an annual Subscription sufficient for discharging it till the Family may be a∣ble to provide for itself.—This, God willing, I hope will be, in a good Measure, speedi∣ly effected. We have lately begun to use the Plow; and next Year I hope to have many Acres of good Oats and Barley. We have near twenty Sheep and Lambs, Fifty Head of Cattle, and Seven Horses. We hope to kill a Thousand Weight of Pork this Season. Our Garden which is
<PB N="60" REF="005886_0056_10275E4F176FE890"/>
very beautiful, furnishes us with all Sorts of Greens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We have plenty of Milk, Eggs, Poultry, and make a good deal of Butter weekly. A good Quantity of Wool and Cotton has been given me, and we hope to have sufficient spun and wove for the next Winter's Cloathing.—If the Vines hit, we may expect two or three Hogsheads of Wine out of the Vineyard. The Fa∣mily now consists of Twenty Six Persons. Two of the Orphan Boys are blind, one is little better than an Idiot.—But notwith∣standing they are useful in the Family, the one in the Field and the other in the Kitchen. I have two Women to take Care of the Houshold Work, and three Men and two Boys employed about the Plantation and Cattle. A set of Dutch Servants has been lately sent over: The Magistrates were pleased to give me two; and I took in a poor old Widow, aged near 70, whom no body else cared to have. A valuable young Man from <HI>New-England</HI> is my School-Master, and in my Absence performs Duty in the Family. On Sabbaths the grown People attend on publick Worship at <HI>Sa∣vannah,</HI> or at <HI>White-bluff,</HI> a Village near <HI>Bethesda,</HI> where a Dutch Minister offici∣ates
<PB N="61" REF="005886_0057_10275E50AB9E0018"/>
My dear Friends who have hitherto been my Assistants, being married and hav∣ing each one or two Children, thought it best, as most suitable to the Institution, to remove. God has mercifully provided for them, and they are comfortably settled, some at <HI>Savannah</HI> and some elsewhere. We frequently write to and hear from one another. I need not trouble you with the Order of our Family. It is pretty near the same as usual, and I do not think to make any material Alteration for some time. Ma∣ny have applied to me to take in their Children as Boarders, and erect a publick School: But I have not yet determined. It is certain such a School would be exceed∣ing useful in this part of the World, if there should be a Peace, not only for those nor∣thern Parts of the Colony, but also for the more Southern Parts of <HI>Carolina, Puris∣burgh,</HI> and <HI>Frederica,</HI> where are many fine Youths. I have been prevailed on to take one from <HI>Frederica,</HI> and another from <HI>Pu∣risburgh,</HI> and it may be shall admit more. For the present, considering the Situation of Affairs, I think it most prudent to go on in making what Improvements I can on the Plantation and bring a Tutor with me
<PB N="62" REF="005886_0058_10275E564864B650"/>
from the Northward in the Fall, to teach a few Youths the Languages, and enlarge the Family when Affairs are more settled. The House is a noble commodious Building, and every Thing sweetly adapted for bring∣ing up Youth. Here is Land to employ them in to exercise their Bodies, and keep them from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eness out of School Hours. Here are none of the Temptations to de∣bauch their tender Minds, which are com∣mon to more populous Countries, or in Pla∣ces where Children must necessarily be brought up with Negroes. What God intends to do with the Colony is not for me to enquire: Secret Things belong to him. It has hitherto been wonderfully preserved, and the Orphan-House, like the burning Bush, has flourished unconsumed. In fine, the Government has, no doubt, its Well∣fare much at Heart: And, God willing, I intend to carry on my Design till I see the Colony sink or swim. The Money that has been expended on the <HI>Orphan∣House,</HI> and Orphan-House Family, has been of vast Service to this Northern Part of the Colony. And tho' it has been greatly de∣trimental to my own private Interest, yet I do not repent of the Undertaking▪ No, I
<PB N="64" REF="005886_0059_10275E592BBA0010"/>
rejoice in it daily, and hope yet to see many more Souls born unto God here. I have had a very comfortable Winter. The Peo∣ple of <HI>Savannah,</HI> having no Minister till lately, gladly accepted my Labours; and at <HI>Frederica,</HI> the Gentlemen and Soldiers of General <HI>Oglethorp'</HI>s Regiment, as well as the Inhabitants of the Town, received me very gladly. Major <HI>Horton</HI> seems to be∣have very well. He has a very fine grow∣ing Plantation—I saw Barley in the Ear the first of <HI>March. Georgia</HI> is very healthy—Not above one, and that a little Child, has died out of our Family, since it remov∣ed to <HI>Bethesda.</HI> I think the Colony (were the Inhabitants sufficiently numerous) is as capable of as good Improvement as any on the Continent.</P>
<P>For the Satisfaction of my Friends, and silencing, if possible, my Enemies, I have had my Accounts from the very Beginning to <HI>January</HI> last, publickly audited and exa∣mined, Debittor and Creditor, Article by Article; and an Oath for Confirmation, being an End of all Strife, I have sworn to them. A Copy of the Audit, with the particular Names of the Children, I have annexed hereunto. If it gives you or others
<PB N="64" REF="005886_0060_10275E5AB26517B0"/>
any Satisfaction I shall be glad. I have no more to add, but to beg a continued In∣terest in your Prayers, and subscribe my∣self,</P>
