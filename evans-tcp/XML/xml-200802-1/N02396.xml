<Q><BIBL><HI>I. TIMOTHY II. 1, 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I exhort therefore that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men:</P>
<P>For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet, and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty.</P></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S it is a sigular favour and distinguishing privilege to be betrusted with the divine Ora∣cles, according to that in Psal. 147.19, 20. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes, and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation.</HI> And that, in Rom. 3.1, 2. <HI>What advan∣tage hath the Jew? — Much every way, chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</HI> So to hearken unto, and obey the voice of GOD in his word, is, the most sure &amp; certain way for a person or people to become truly and
<PB N="2" REF="002841_0005_0FE674F08048B548"/>
really happy. And hence, it is to be looked up∣on as a good <HI>Omen,</HI> a token for good, that those who are set in the highest and most exalted Pla∣ces and Stations among this People, do not only permit and allow, but call the Messengers of the Lord of Hosts, the Dispensers of his holy Word, to be their Remembrancers, to put them in mind of the will of GOD, and their Duty, who do An∣nually introduce the weighty business &amp; affairs of this Day, not only by solemn Prayer and Sup∣plication, to the Prayer-hearing GOD; but also by giving attention unto the Word, which is profi∣table for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, and for Instruction in Righteousness. And the Tribes do come up, the Tribes of the Lord, to the Testi∣mony of Israel. Persons of all Ranks, Orders and Degrees come up to the Sanctuary of the Lord, and present themselves before the most High GOD, practically saying with them, in Luke 3.14. <HI>And what shall we do?</HI> Well, the words which have been now read do lay before all sorts of Persons their Duty, and show them what they are to do in their several Places and Capacities, to promote the best Interest of the People amongst whom they dwell.</P>
<P>These words are contained in an <HI>Epistle</HI> that was written by the great Apostle &amp; Doctor of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> unto his Son <HI>Timothy.</HI> That admirable Person who after he had been a violent Persecu∣tor of Christ, became a zealous Preacher of him, did labour abundantly to advance his cause; and had the interest of Religion, continually lying very much upon his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002841_0006_0FE674CDDE67A548"/>After he had planted a Church at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> he having occasion to depart from thence, and go in∣to <HI>Macedonia,</HI> to promote the work of the Lord there, besought <HI>Timothy</HI> to abide still in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> for the better ordering, instructing and establish∣ing of the Church there; and when he was absent from him, he wrote this <HI>Epistle</HI> to him to encou∣rage and instruct him in his work, and shew him how to behave himself in the House of GOD.</P>
<P>And having directed him in the <HI>first Chapter,</HI> how to maintain the Truth of the Gospel, and defend it against the Teachers of the Law, and shewed him how to state the true use and end of the Law, which being rightly understood and used is not contrary, but consonant unto the Gospel; He does in this <HI>second Chapter,</HI> teach and instruct him with respect unto divine Worship.</P>
<P>In the words of our Text, with which the Chap∣ter begins, we have a very serious and pathetical Exhortation. And here we may observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Person Exhorting,</HI> viz. The holy and inspired Apostle. <HI>I exhort</HI> (saith he) or <HI>desire,</HI> as it is in the Margin.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Duty exhorted to</HI>; or what it was the Apostle shewed his concern to have done, and that was, <HI>That supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks should be made.</HI> Supplicati∣ons and Prayers for the supply of wants: Inter∣cessions for others▪ And giving of Thanks for good things bestowed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Whom this Duty doth concern</HI>; or who are to be employed herein. And the Apostle doth not only call upon <HI>Timothy,</HI> to perform this duty,
<PB N="4" REF="002841_0007_0FE674F46C0BECB8"/>
and attend this part of worship. Nor doth he only call upon him to put others upon it: but he exhorts <HI>That prayers be made,</HI> &amp;c. intimating, that <HI>Timothy</HI> should not only do it himself; but also put others upon doing of it. Ministers must not only give themselves to Prayer; but also put all others upon this duty, and stir them up to it, as they have opportunity.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>weight and stress</HI> that the Apostle lays upon it. I exhort that <HI>first of all,</HI> or <HI>principally</HI>: intimating, that it is a necessary duty that must not be neglected.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>For whom they are to do this.</HI> And this is to be done,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In general: <HI>For all Men,</HI> i. e. for all sorts and orders of Men: but this is to be understood with an exception of those for whom we are for∣bidden to pray, in 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.16.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. More particularly, and in a special and pe∣culiar manner, <HI>for those who are set to rule over others.</HI> And,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. For <HI>Kings.</HI> Those who are in the chief and supreme Place, or seat of Government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>For all who are in Authority under them</HI>; or in eminent Place: as the Greek word may be rendred.</ITEM>
</LIST></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>To what end, or for what reason,</HI> we should pray for those who are in Authority, expressed in those words, <HI>That we may lead a quiet and peacea∣ble life, in all godliness and honesty.</HI> Which words do plainly intimate, that it is highly necessary and of great concernment that particular Persons, and a whole People should lead a quiet &amp; peace∣able
<PB N="5" REF="002841_0008_0FE674CE5036E100"/>
life in all godliness and honesty. And how much Civil Rulers may promote their leading of such a life. And how needful our Prayers for them are in order to their being instrumental hereof. And what obligations we are under to be Thankful to GOD, when they are so.</P>
<P>From these words, thus considered, many Ob∣servations might be raised: But I would take Notice only of those things in the words which may more particularly suit the occasion of the Day. And so insist only on the following Doctrines or Propositions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> That the Greatest and Best thing that can be desired, or wished for with respect unto a Pro∣fessing People, is, That they may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in the due exercise &amp; practice of all true Godliness and Honesty.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> That Civil Rulers, or those who are in Authority over a People, are to do much to pro∣mote and further their leading a quiet and peace∣able life, in all Godliness and Honesty.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>III.</HI> That all those who would shew them∣selves concerned for the good, and welfare of the People among whom they dwell, should Pray much for their Civil Rulers; or those who are in Authority over them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>IV.</HI> That when Civil Rulers; or those who are in Authority over a People, do promote Peace, Godliness, and Honesty amongst their People, They should give Thanks unto GOD, for the great good and benefit which they receive by them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002841_0009_0FE674C55907E5E0"/>DOCT. I. <HI>That the Greatest and the Best thing that can be desired or wished for, with respect to a Professing People, is, That they may lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life, in the due exercise and practice of all true Godliness and Honesty.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Best and the Greatest thing that they can desire for themselves, or that their best Friends can wish unto them: And this is what they should be always most Sollicitously con∣cerned about.</P>
<P>But what is it to lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life? What to live in the practice of true god∣liness? What to live Honestly? And why should all sorts of Persons among a People be Sol∣licitously concerned that they may lead a Quiet and Peaceable Life, in all Godliness &amp; Honesty? Or, How doth it appear, that this is the greatest and the best thing that can be desired for a Pro∣fessing People? These things may come under our consideration.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What is it for a People to lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life?</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life, is, to be freed from War, and all Molestation from Ene∣mies.</HI> When a People hear the sound of the Trumphet, and the Alarm of War; when the Enemy is at the gate; when they are beset and assaulty by their Adversaries, so that there is no safety for him that comes in, or for him that goes out; when they are often hearing of Garments rolled in blood; or if they only hear the rumors of War, they do not live quietly and peaceably▪ But when they have no Enemies to molest them;
<PB N="7" REF="002841_0010_0FE674CF8042F0B8"/>
when there is no breaking in, nor going out; when they sit every one under his vine &amp; figtree, and there is none to make them affraid: they lead a quiet and a peaceable life. And altho' this may not be what is immediately intended in our Text; yet, Happy is the People that is in such a case.</P>
<P N="2">2. To lead a quiet and a peaceable life, is, <HI>To be secured and protected in the peaceable and quiet enjoyment of their Rights, Liberties and Pri∣vileges.</HI> As there are Enemies without, who do often draw the Sword against them, and molest, and disquiet a People: so there are many within them, and among themselves, or else-where, who would dispossess them of their Estates, or deprive them of their Liberties &amp; Privileges: but when they are protected and defended in the quiet and peaceable possession of their own Rights, and have their invaluable Liberties and Privileges secured unto them, and they enjoy them quietly, they may be said to lead quiet and peaceable lives.</P>
<P N="3">3. To lead quiet and peaceable lives, is, <HI>to Live quietly and peaceably together.</HI> When they are at Peace among themselves, and live quietly to∣gether; when Families live Peaceably &amp; quiet∣ly; when there is peace and quietness in Towns and Churches; and in all Societies among a Peo∣ple, they may be said to lead quiet and peace∣able lives. And this is what they are required and commanded to do. 1 Thes. 4.11. <HI>Study to be quiet.</HI> And in Heb. 12.14. <HI>Follow peace with all men.</HI> Rom. 12.18. <HI>If it be possible as much as in you lyeth, live peaceably with all men.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="002841_0011_0FE674F7C12A2438"/>II. <HI>What is it to live in the due exercise and practice of true Godliness?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It implies, <HI>their being like unto GOD.</HI> To be godly is to be like GOD, and the more like unto GOD any are, the more godly are they. Altho' Men have lost the Image of GOD, yet that glorious One hath of his rich Grace so order∣ed things, that they may be renewed in his Image. Col. 3.10. <HI>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</HI> They have those divine Qua∣lities and Dispositions infused into them, and implanted in them which render <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em like unto GOD, and so they are made Partakers of the di∣vine Nature; as it is expressed, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. Now when they have the Image of GOD renewed in them, those Graces implanted in them, which are the fruits of the Spirit of GOD, and live in the exercise of these Graces, so as to shew forth the virtues and praises of him who hath called them out of darkness into his marvellous light, imita∣ting him in all his imitable excellencies and per∣fections, treading in his steps, and following his example: This is to live in the exercise and practice of godliness. And this is what is requi∣red and commanded, Math. 5.48. <HI>Be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</HI> And in 1 Pet. 1.16. <HI>Be ye Holy for I am Holy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To be godly, or to live in the exercise of godliness, is, <HI>to study &amp; endeavour to please GOD in all that they do.</HI> And this implies, their shunning and avoiding what is displeasing to GOD, and so their departing from Iniquity, and forsaking every
<PB N="9" REF="002841_0012_0FE674CFA861E018"/>
way of Sinning; for Sin is that abominable thing which the Soul of the Lord hates, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.4. And their studying and endeavouring to know what GOD would have them to do in every state and condition, and under whatever circumstan∣ces they are; and when they know what GOD would have them to do, apply themselves to the performance of it; and so endeavour to do always the things that please GOD, and in such a man∣ner as will be acceptable to him: and so devote themselves entirely to him. This is to live in the exercise of godliness.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is to live and walk with GOD.</HI> To live godlily is to think and meditate much on GOD, to thirst for GOD, even for the living GOD, and follow after him from Duty to Duty, and from Ordinance to Ordinance, and so walk in all his Ordinances, drawing near to him in all the ways of his appointment, never being satisfied and con∣tented before they find him, and sit under his shadow with great delight, and find his fruit to be very sweet and pleasant unto them. This is to live in the exercise &amp; practice of true godliness.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>What is it to live Honestly?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> This hath reference to our carriage &amp; be∣haviour towards Men. And so <HI>Men live honestly, when they are sincere and plain-hearted in all their dealings with one another</HI>; not only their trading and commerce, but also in the discharge of every duty that they ought to perform towards one a∣nother: when every one looks at the good of others, as well as his own; according to that in <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.4. <HI>Look not every man on his own things; but every
<PB N="10" REF="002841_0013_0FE674F7E79E6908"/>
man also on the things of others.</HI> And when they have their conversations towards one another in simplicity, and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom; but by the Grace of GOD, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We may consider, <HI>How it appears that this is the best thing than can be desired &amp; wished for, with respect unto a Professing People</HI>? And so that this is what all sorts of Persons among them should be sollicitously concerned about, that they may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty. Now this will appear if we consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. When a People do lead such a life, and live in the due exercise and practice of godliness and honesty, <HI>The Name of GOD is greatly honoured and glorified.</HI> There is nothing to be thought of that is of so great Importance and Concernment, as that whereby GOD is honoured and glorified: for he is Infinitely worthy of it, who is the chief and supreme good, the first Cause &amp; the last End of all things; a Being full of all possible Per∣fection, and hath made all things for the advance∣ment of his own glory, and laid all Men, and especially his own People under infinite Obliga∣tions to honour and glorifie him. They are a People whom he hath formed for himself, that they might shew forth his praise, <HI>Isai.</HI> 43.21. And they have peculiar advantages to honour and glo∣rifie GOD. And hence, it is not a matter of in∣difference whether GOD be honoured by them or no; but it is of absolute necessity.</P>
<P>Now the more quiet and peaceable a People
<PB N="11" REF="002841_0014_0FE674D3ADA6D420"/>
are, and the more there is of true godliness and honestly among them, the more is GOD honoured and glorified by them. When the command∣ments of GOD are obeyed by them, and they manifest their care to please GOD, then he ac∣counts himself honoured and glorified by them; their hearts are set upon honouring and glorifying of GOD, and they do advance his declarative glory. Whereas on the other hand, GOD is greatly dishonoured by a People, when they live in strife and contention, and when impiety and dishonesty prevails among them.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Peoples leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, <HI>will tend very much to their own great Benefit and Advantage.</HI> They cannot possibly do any thing that will tend so much unto their own good as this will, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.8. And that whether they are considered per∣sonally, and particularly: Or, as a People. As for particular Persons amongst a People, there is nothing will promote their Interest and Happi∣ness so much as their living in the practice of true godliness and honesty: for herein they will find that Pleasure, Sweetness and Satisfaction, which will sufficiently reward them for all the care and pains they take to live holily and godlily. And for a few years Service here, they will be recom∣penced with an Eternity of bliss and happiness in the coming world. And then the more there is of godliness and peace, and honesty among a Peo∣ple, the better it will fare with them in all respects, and upon all accounts, as they are a People.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="002841_0015_0FE674FE12C2F698"/>1. If a People would live in the exercise of godliness and honesty, <HI>They would hereby be secu∣red from amazing Judgments and Calamities.</HI> It is accounted a terrible thing to smart under aw∣ful Judgments and Calamities. A People are very apt to grown under them; and they account it an happy thing to be freed therefrom. And as Sin does procure them all. Jer. 4.18. <HI>Thy way, and thy doings have procured these things unto you</HI>: so if a People would live in peace and in the practice of godliness and honesty, they would be safe and out of danger of Judgments or Cala∣mities. When there was a destroying Judgment coming upon the Cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> it was declared to <HI>Abraham,</HI> that if there could have been found <HI>Ten</HI> godly Persons among them, the whole city should be spared for the sake of those <HI>righteous Ones,</HI> Gen. 18.32. whereby it is intimated unto us, what blessings godly Ones are to the Places where they dwell, and how much they do to secure such Places from Judgments and Calamities. And therefore if a People were ge∣nerally Peaceable, and Godly, and Honest, they would be secure from, and out of danger of Judg∣ments and Calamities.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This would exceedingly promote their Pros∣perity.</HI> Deut. 29.9. <HI>Keep therefore the words of this Covenant and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</HI> Piety and Honesty is the best Friend to outward Prosperity; and hereby the Prosperity of their Souls also would be exceeding∣ly promoted; their Souls would prosper and flou∣rish; they would prosper in every thing that they set their hearts, or their hands unto.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="13" REF="002841_0016_0FE674D3DCC9F308"/>3. <HI>It would be very much to their Honour and Credit,</HI> to live peaceably in the exercise of true godliness and honesty, <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.34. As Sin brings a People low, brings shame and reproach, and contempt upon them: so holiness and godliness lifts a Nation high, makes them honourable in the eyes of GOD, &amp; of other Nations, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.13. They shall have honour among their Neighbours.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>This would engage and secure the gracious Presence of GOD with them.</HI> As it is a very dreadful and ruining thing unto a People to lose the presence of GOD, to have that glorious One depart from them, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9.12. So the Enjoyment of the gracious &amp; favourable presence of GOD will render a Person or People truly happy. If GOD be with them, and for them, they need not care who is against them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.31. Their having their Garners filled, affording them all manner of store; their Sheep bringing forth thousands, and ten thousands in their Streets, and their Oxen strong to labour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will not render them so happy as their having GOD in the midst of them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 144. latter end. And if they live in peace, the GOD of love and peace shall be with them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.11. And if they live and walk with GOD in the due exercise and practice of all true godliness and honesty; the Lord will certainly be with them, 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him.</HI> And so there is no∣thing that can more promote a Peoples interest, and be more profitable and gainful to them, than their living in peace, and in the exercise and practice of true godliness &amp; honesty.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="002841_0017_0FE674FE36F55600"/>3. <HI>If a Professing People do not live quietly and peaceably in the practice of godliness and honesty, they give the Lie to their profession.</HI> A professing People are in <HI>Covenant</HI> with GOD: they are un∣der <HI>Baptismal Vows</HI>; and they are often lifting up their hands to the living GOD, and swearing Allegiance unto him: And what do they vow and promise and engage to do, but to serve him in holiness and righteousness all the days of their lives And therefore if they do not live in the Practice of Godliness and Honesty, they flatter GOD with their Mouths, and lie unto him with their Tongues: they are not sound in his Statutes, nor stedfast in his Covenant; but break thro' the solemn Bonds which they have laid themselves under; and are lying Children.</P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>Civil Rulers, or those who are in Au∣thority over a People, are to do much to promote and further their leading a quiet and peaceable Life, in all godliness and honesty.</HI></P>
<P>They may do much to promote this; and they ought to do it: They have great opportunities and advantages to do it; and they are under the greatest and strongest obligations imaginable here-unto.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>They</HI> may <HI>do much to promote and further a Peoples leading a quiet and peaceable Life, in all godliness and honesty.</HI> It is remarked concerning the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> in Judges 2.7. <HI>That they ser∣ved the Lord all the days of Joshua</HI>: to shew the good influence which good Magistrates have upon
<PB N="15" REF="002841_0018_0FE674D652992390"/>
a People, and how much they may do to promote their serving of GOD.</P>
<P>And there are many ways wherein they may very much promote their Peoples leading of such a life, &amp; promote godliness &amp; honesty among them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By making of good &amp; suitable Laws.</HI> As it is one branch of the Power of Civil Rulers to make Laws; so it hath always been found very neces∣sary to have such Laws enacted as will tend to restrain Persons from Impiety and Dishonesty, and to constrain them to do justly, &amp; live honestly, and in the exercise of Piety. And Civil Rulers may do much to promote that which is so desirable among a People, by taking care to have good and wholesome Laws that are every way suited and adapted to the circumstances of their People. And such as will be likely to have the greatest Influence upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By taking care that good and wholesome Laws be duely and seasonably executed.</HI> That so Bold and Daring Transgressors of the Laws may be brought to due and condign punishment, that not only, they may be afraid to go on in ways of Im∣piety and Dishonesty, but others also, hearing what they have brought upon themselves by do∣ing evil, may be deterred from doing as they have done. Deut. 13.10, 11. <HI>And thou shalt stone him with stones,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And all Israel shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear &amp; fear and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.</HI> The punishment of sins committed is <HI>in terrorem,</HI> for the prevention of the like. Smite the Scorner that sins presumptuously, and the simple that is in danger of Sinning carelessly

<P N="4">4. <HI>By their good Examples.</HI> Examples are very leading &amp; prevailing, and in a special man∣ner the Examples of Great Men, and those that have Authority over others. The Examples of such Men do powerfully incline others whether to Good or Bad: To Sin or Holiness. If such Men are <HI>Unchast, Unjust</HI> or <HI>Intemperate,</HI> &amp;c. their Examples are awfully Influential. How often is there that Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d set upon King <HI>Jeroboam; He sinned, and made Israel to sin.</HI> When he indulged himself in sin, this encouraged Multitudes of others to do wickedly.

lest their contrary vertues might seem to upbraid their Rulers Vices. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> (it is said) accounted it graceful &amp; their duty to halt on that Leg on which their King limped. And the wise Man says, in Prov. 29.12. <HI>If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.</HI> But if Ma∣gistrates go before others in a holy Life, and set them bright Examples of honesty, Sobriety, Temperance &amp; Piety, this will provoke Piety in others. When Religion shines with the Rays of Greatness and Majesty, this makes it glorious and lovely in the eyes of others, (as one expresses it.)</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>By taking care that the Gospel be duely Preached unto their People.</HI> The Gospel is called the Gospel of Peace, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.15. As it is a means to promote and make up a Peace between GOD and sinful Men, and settle Peace in the Souls of Men, and promotes love and peace among Men. And this is that whereby vital Piety is promoted: for it is a means of turning and changing the Hearts of Sinners. Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</HI> And of building them up in faith and holiness. Act. 20.32. <HI>I commend you to God and the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</HI> And the word of GOD where it converts not, it often civilizeth, and lays a restraint and curb upon Mens Spirits. It takes cognizance of, and censures and reproves those inward lurking sins, which the Civil Sword cannot reach. And therefore Civil Rulers may do much to promote Peace and Godliness, and Honesty, by taking care that suitable Persons be

employed in Preaching the Gospel, in all Places under their Government, who will diligently and faithfully lay out themselves to promote Peace, and Godliness &amp; Honesty in their several Places. And by taking care that they be encouraged in their work, and supported, that they may not be necessitated to leave that which is their proper Work, to provide for themselves and families, and so to do their work negligently. <HI>Famem Mi∣nistorum sequitur fames verbi,</HI> was a Prophecy of <HI>Luther</HI> long ago. That famishing of the Mi∣nisters would usher in a famine of the word. And hence, altho' a Persecuting <HI>Ahab,</HI> accounted <HI>Elijah</HI> the Troubler of <HI>Israel,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 18.17. And un∣godly Princes cast <HI>Jeremiah</HI> into a Dungeon, <HI>Jer.</HI> 37.15. yet good King <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> sent Princes to teach in the Cities of <HI>Judah,</HI> as it is expressed in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 17.9. <HI>i. e.</HI> to provide for and counte∣nance the <HI>Levites,</HI> who were sent to teach.

He orders the Main∣tenance of the Priests &amp; Levites, that they might neither want Subsistence, nor Encouragement. It was that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord, <HI>i. e.</HI> in the study of it, and in doing their duty, according to it. He would have them be not only maintained but encouraged, that they might do their work with chearfulness: He was not for having them maintained in Idleness and Luxury; but in the Law of the Lord: In their observing of it themselves, and teaching others the good knowledge of it. A good Pattern for
<PB N="19" REF="002841_0022_0FE674DE631BBF48"/>
good Magistrates, who desire to promote the wor∣ship and service of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Civil Rulers, or those who are in Authority over a People,</HI> ought <HI>to do much to promote Peace and Godliness, and Honesty, among their People.</HI> They are under very great and strong Obligati∣ons to improve all the Opportunities and Advan∣tages which they have to do it. Necessity is laid upon them, and they cannot with honour and safety neglect to do it. For</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are appointed, and set up to this very End.</HI> This is an order of Men of divine Appoint∣ment: And the wise GOD must needs have some great and good End in appointing such an order of Men, and they ought as much as in them lies to answer the End of their appointment. Now they are set up and appointed to promote the best good of the People over whom they are set. The People are not made for them: but they for the good of the People; and therefore they should say, with him, <HI>Non mihi, sed Populo,</HI> and act with a greater concern to promote the Publick good of their People, than to promote their own private Interest: And particularly, They are ordained to promote the good of their People in <HI>this way,</HI> even by suppressing of Vice and Wickedness, and promoting Peace and Godliness, and Honesty among them. Rom. 13.4. <HI>He is the Minister of God to thee for good— A Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.14. <HI>Governours are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="002841_0023_0FE674FFC2954CF8"/>
And therefore if Rulers neglect to do this, or do not, to the uttermost of their power promote Piety and Honesty among their People, they do frustrate the End for which they are made; not only as they are Men; but also frustrate the great and holy End, and design of GOD in setting them up in the Places which they are set in.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Honour which GOD hath advanced them unto, brings them under very great Obligations to advance the Honour and Glory of GOD, as much as they can.</HI> They are very honourable Places that Rulers are set in, and it is GOD that hath advanced them unto them. Psal. 75.6, 7.—<HI>Pro∣motion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the Judge, He putteth down one, and setteth up another.</HI> And as He hath advanced them to honour, so He requires &amp; obligeth Men to respect &amp; reverence, and honour them. 1 Pet. 2.17. — <HI>Honour the King.</HI> Rom. 13.7. <HI>Render to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</HI> And as GOD will honour those that honour him, (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.30.) so all those who are honoured by GOD, are under special and peculiar obligations to improve all that they have in honouring of GOD. And seeing GOD is greatly honoured when Peace &amp; Piety and Honesty are promoted among a People; and Rulers have great Oppor∣tunities and Advantages to promote these, they ought to do it. It greatly concer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s them to lay out themselves in all proper and suitable ways, for the promoting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="002841_0024_0FE674E00D6D2628"/>3. <HI>The more there is of Peace and Godliness, and Honesty among a People, the more happy and comfortable will their Reign and Government be, who are set to Rule over them.</HI> As this is what will make a happy People: So happy are those Rulers who do Rule over a People among whom Peace and Godliness, and Honesty, do prevail. For (as an excellent Divine observes) There is nothing more certain than this, That the most serious, godly Christians, are the best Subjects upon earth. It is therefore the Interest of Rulers to do all that possibly they can to promote Peace, and Godliness, and Honesty among their People.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Great and Glorious GOD is always Present with them; his eye is upon them; and he marks and observeth how they manage and behave themselves, in those High Stations, which they are set in.</HI> He who hath set them in those Pla∣ces to promote Peace and Godliness, and Honesty, among his People, critically observes, What they do, How they manage and behave themselves, Whether they answer his just and righteous Ex∣pectations concerning them. This King <HI>David</HI> endeavoured to awe his Soul with the considera∣tion of; Psal. 139.1, 2, 3. <HI>O Lord, Thou hast searched me, and known me, Thou knowest my down sitting, and mine up rising. Thou understandest my thought a far off, Thou compassest my path, and my lying down; and art acquainted with all my way. For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.</HI> And he would have other Rulers walk under the influ∣ence
<PB N="22" REF="002841_0025_0FE67505B16ADD18"/>
of such a consideration, who says, in Psal. 82.1. <HI>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the Gods.</HI> He standeth as a Judge diligently to observe all that is done there. And this was what King <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> made use of to excite the Judges which he ap∣pointed in course of Justice, to faithfulness in their work, to lay out themselves to promote Justice and Equity, and the Fear of the Lord: 2 Chron. 19.6. <HI>Ye judge not for man; but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment.</HI> When Judges are sitting in Courts of Judicature, GOD is with them to observe, and take notice, Whether they impartially do Justice to every one, according to the best understanding that they can have of things. And when Rulers do meet together in a more general Assembly to transact and manage the Publick Affairs, GOD stands in that Congre∣gation of the Mighty, He Judges among them. He observes and takes notice of every One, and sees what Principles and Motives they act from, as well as what they do, and what they design and aim at. Whether their governing End in all they do, be to promote Peace and Godliness, and Ho∣nesty among their People; and to secure and de∣fend them in the quiet and peaceable possession and enjoyment of their Rights, Liberties and Pri∣vileges: Or, whether it be only to serve their own Interest, and the Interest of some particular Friends of theirs.</P>

And after they have been sitting to Judge others, must themselves stand before the Judgment Seat of him whose Servants they are, and give a strict account to him, and pass into an eternal state, as other Men do, where there will be a just Distribution of Rewards &amp; Punishments: and therefore if they do live in Intemperance, and Uncleanness here; if they are Unjust and Unrighteous <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this will stick their Death-beds full of Briars &amp; Thorns, and make them uneasy to them. And how terrible and amazing will the Day of Judgment be unto them? If the thoughts of that Day, at a distance, made <HI>Felix</HI> to quake and tremble, <HI>Act.</HI> 24.25. How will they tremble, when they see it is come in good earnest! When they shall hear the last Trumpet sounding, see the Graves opening, and the Dead arising, and the World on a light fire, and the SON of Man descending in the Pomp &amp; Equi∣page of an Incarnate GOD, and sit down on a fiery Throne, calling them to his Bar! How will they then call and cry to the Rocks and Moun∣tains to fall on them, and hide them from the face of him that sitteth upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great Day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand! <HI>Rev</HI> 6.15, 16, 17. And how dreadful

will it be to be punished with everlasting de∣struction from the presence of the LORD, and the glory of his Power!</P>
<P>But on the other hand, If they are bright Ex∣amples of Sobriety, Temperance and Piety; If they have shaken their hands from holding of bribes, and impartially done Justice to all; and been faithful in improving all their Opportunities and Advantages, to promote Peace, Godliness and Honesty among their People; with what Peace and Serenity of mind may they look death in the face, when they come to encounter the King of Terrors. You see how it was with good King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> what he was under, on apprehension that he should die presently: 2 King. 20.1, 2, 3. <HI>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death, and the Prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came unto him, and said to him; thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, saying, I beseech thee, O Lord, Remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.</HI> And Oh, how reviving and re∣freshing will the Great Day of the LORD be unto them, when it will be said, Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you! Then they will be advanced to infinitely greater honour, and sit on a more honourable Seat than ever they have sat on here: for they shall sit down with CHRIST on his Throne, even as he over-came, and sat down with the Father on his Throne, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21.</P>

<P>The People of GOD should be a Praying Peo∣ple; they should be much in prayer to GOD; and pray without ceasing. And they should not only joyn together in publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssemblies to pray unto GOD; but pray every Family apart, and every Soul apart. And they should pray not only for themselves, but for others also: And in a more especial and peculiar manner, for all that are in Authority. It is a very great and weighty work that they have lying upon them; it is what con∣cerns the glory of GOD, &amp; the good of their People. And how wise soever they are, and well qualified, they can do nothing without GOD. Their whole dependance is upon Him, as well as the Depen∣dance of the meanest &amp; weakest of their people. And therefore all that are under their Authority should be much in Prayer to GOD for them con∣tinually, that GOD would qualify them more and more for their work, be with them in it, and carry them through it: inspire them more and more with a spirit of courage and Resolution; and make them instrumental of promoting Peace and Godliness, and Honesty very much among their People. <HI>David</HI> fore-told this, as part of the glory of <HI>Solomons</HI> Government, that Prayer should continually be made for him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.15.</P>

<P>Here it might be shewed,</P>
<P>That when Civil Rulers are Instrumental to promote Peace &amp; Godliness, and Honesty amongst a People, such a People are greatly benefitted by them. Very great is the good and advantage which a People receive by such Rulers; and well may they be called Pillars &amp; Shields, and strong Foundations, and the Breath of their Nostrils, as they sometimes are. But then,</P>
<P>It is GOD that makes them to be what they are. As He sets them in those Places wherein they are so serviceable &amp; beneficial to their Peo∣ple: so all their Gifts &amp; Qualifications are from GOD: It is He that hath qualified them for these Places, and spirited them to improve their Gifts and Parts, their Opportunities and Advantages for the good and benefit of their People.</P>
<P>And therefore altho' such Rulers are to be re∣spected &amp; honoured, and so acknowledged as in∣strumental of great good in the hands of GOD; yet, GOD is in a peculiar manner to be acknow∣ledged herein; unto Him are we to give the praise &amp; glory hereof. We are hereby brought under very great obligations to gratitude &amp; thank∣fulness unto him.</P>
<P>This is all the return we can make unto him for so great and undeserved a favour, to give
<PB N="27" REF="002841_0030_0FE674E6CB07E5F8"/>
Thanks unto his holy Name, with affected and enlarged hearts, and to walk in some measure agreeable there-unto.</P>
<P>But I shall now proceed to the Improvement, and apply what hath been said.</P>
<P>USE 1 <HI>Hence we see what cause of Humilia∣tion, and deep &amp; bitter Lamentation there is, That there is so much Impiety &amp; Dishonesty prevailing in this Land.</HI> We are fallen into great Aposta∣cies and sore Declensions, have lost much of the Life &amp; Power of Godliness; and the Form of it seems to be going too; and tho' GOD hath been calling aloud to us by his Judgments to Repent, and Reform, yet we go on still in our Trespasses, and after all that GOD hath done to reclaim us, What sinful &amp; scandalous Contentions have there been, which make way for Confusion, and every evil Work: And how notorious does Pride and Idleness, Oppression, Sabbath breaking, prophane Cursing &amp; Swearing, Drunkenness &amp; Uncleanness, and many more Abominations abound and pre∣vail amongst us! And how are we ripening a∣pace hereby for more terrible &amp; amazing Judg∣ments and Calamities! This is for a Lamentati∣on, and should be for a Lamentation.</P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>Hence see what ground &amp; occasion there is of Joy &amp; Rejoycing that there are any among us, who have a zealous concern to promote Peace and Godliness, and Honesty among this People.</HI> Altho' we are grown very Degenerate &amp; Corrupt, and
<PB N="28" REF="002841_0031_0FE675073050D1F8"/>
Iniquity does abound exceedingly amongst us; yet it must be acknowledged to the glory of di∣vine Grace &amp; Mercy, that there is a Number of serious godly, praying Ones among us, who weep and mourn Day and Night for the Iniquities and Abominations, that are in the midst of us; and are zealously concerned for the revival of the work of the LORD, and the promoting of Peace, and Godliness, and Honesty. These are the Cha∣riots of our Israel, and the Horsemen thereof.</P>
<P>And it is to be looked upon as a Token for good, that so many are spirited to lay out part of their Estates, to give their hopeful Sons a liberal Education; and that so many of those who are so Educated, are Spirited to give up themselves to the work of the Ministry, when the Ministry is under such dark &amp; discouraging circumstances, that they cannot have any prospect of advancing their worldly Interest by engaging in that work. It looks as if they were acted by a more noble and generous principle; that it is a desire to be in∣strumental of promoting Religion &amp; Godliness, that carries them out to undertake so good a work; May the GOD of all Grace be with them, and fill them more abundantly with his Spirit &amp; Grace, that when the Aged Servants of the Lord, and those who are in our declining Years shall be called off from our work, we may leave it with a joyful prospect of this, that our Places are like to be filled up with those who will do more to promote true Godliness, than ever we have done.</P>

Certainly they ought to Pray much for themselves, and for their People too. And those of them who are sensible of the weight and Difficulty of their work, will be much in Prayer. King <HI>David</HI> was a Man of Prayer: He resolved that Evening and Morning and at Noon he would pray, and cry aloud unto GOD, <HI>Psal.</HI> 55 17. And how earnest did <HI>Solomon</HI> pray for Wisdom, to know how to go in and out before his Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple? And <HI>Moses</HI> did not only pray much for himself, but was also a powerful Intercessor for his People.

Let us be often striving together in our prayers for them, as well as pray for them alone by our selves. This would better become us than to be too forward to complain of them, and murmur against them. And if we would pray more for them, it may be we should not have so much occasion to complain of them. If they at any time do what they should not do, or neglect to do what they should do; it may be we are to blame. If we had prayed for them as we should have done, perhaps it would have been otherwise.</P>

<P>USE 7. <HI>Let us all be excited by what we have heard, to labour, and do our utmost, in our several Places to promote Peace and Piety, and Honesty among this People.</HI> Seeing this will be so much for the Glory of GOD, and the Good and Benefit of this People.

<P N="2">2 <HI>What hath been said may be improved to ex∣cite and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir up the Ministers of the Gospel, to lay out themselves with a burning Zeal and Inde∣fatigable Pains, to promote Peace, Godliness and Honesty among their People.</HI> And here, Will my Reverend Fathers, and Dear Brethren allow me, the least and unworthiest of their number, to stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, of that which you are sensible is our great &amp; chief Work. This is the work which we are separated and set apart unto, and very awfully and dread∣fully Charged to do, <HI>viz</HI> to promote Peace and Godliness, and Honesty among our People; and seeing it is so desirable a thing for a People to lead such lives, and will conduce so much to the Glory of GOD, and the good of his People, how should we labour and spend ourselves to promote them not only by Praying for our Civil Rulers, and encouraging them to go on steddily and zea∣lously with their work; but also by applying our selves to that which is our proper work. That if possible in this Day of Degeneracy the work of the Lord may be revived, and many may have their eyes opened, and be turned from darkness

to light, and from the Power of Sin and Satan unto GOD; that Bold and daring Sinners may turn their Feet into the way of GOD's Testi∣monies, and the Professors of Religion may be sound in GOD's Statutes, and stedfast in his Co∣venant, and adorn the Doctrine of GOD their Saviour in all things; and the things which are ready to die may be strengthned. And to that End, labour in the most lively and affecting man∣ner to set forth unto them their Misery by Na∣ture, the vileness of Sin, the Vanity of the Crea∣ture, and the Excellency of CHRIST. And with the greatest Importunity cry to the GOD of all Grace, for the plentiful effusion of his Spirit and Grace, that it may be a Day of his Power where∣in very many may be made willing to come over to CHRIST, and walk in his ways, and uphold Religion in the Life &amp; Power of it. And dili∣gently and faithfully attend upon every part of our work, depending upon GOD for Assistance therein, and Success.</P>
<P>Indeed, many are labouring under such diffi∣culties that they cannot give themselves to this work, as they should do, and would do. Altho' they are wronged and injured; yet, People who are quick sighted in other Cases will not see it, and therefore they are not relieved; yet let all, as far as possibly they can, improve their Time, and all their Talents to promote Peace and God∣liness, depending upon GOD, not only for As∣sistance and Success; but for a Maintenance, who is able to open the Eyes and Hearts of People. It is a Good GOD that we serve, and he will not
<PB N="35" REF="002841_0038_0FE674EEAE98CD70"/>
fail any that Trust in him. He hath a glorious Reward for all that will serve him faithfully.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>These Truths may be improved in a loud Call to the Body of this People.</HI> You hear how much our living in Peace, and in the Practice of Godliness and Honesty would tend to the Glo∣ry of GOD. And how much it would be for our own Honour and Safety. O, that you would all do what you possibly can for the promoting of it, and that not only by praying for, and ho∣nouring and supporting our Rulers, and by in∣forming and testifying against Bold Transgres∣sors, and by encouraging the hearts, and strength∣ning the hands of your Ministers: but also by labouring to uphold and maintain the life and power of Godliness in your own Souls, and promo∣ting it as much as you can in your Families.</P>
<P>And so all Heads of Families are to be called upon, to endeavour the Revival of Family Religion and Family Government. There is nothing more necessary than this at this Day. For, as one well observes, If a People have the best Magi∣strates, and they Enact the best Laws, and back them with the strictest Execution; yet So∣cieties will be naught, if Heads of Families neg∣lect their Duty. They have the Care of Persons in their young and tender Years, when they may be bowed; but if they neglect them till they grow up, they are like to be unmanageable; and so to be plagues to the Places where they dwell. It is very probable that at this Door, that Apo∣stacy and Degeneracy came in which hath aw∣fully crept upon this People, and hath been
<PB N="36" REF="002841_0039_0FE6750ED8CAEC80"/>
testified against, by so many amazing Judgments and Calamities. And if ever this People become a truly reformed People there must be a Revival of Family Religion, Family Instruction and Fa∣mily Government. I shall therefore Conclude with a Call to all Heads of Families, to walk within their Houses with a perfect Heart. Set up and maintain the Worship of GOD in your Families constantly. Take pains in teaching and instructing all that are under your Care, and Go∣vern your Families well.</P>
<P>And if All sorts of Persons would unite their active and zealous Endeavours, with Prudence and Fidelity, to suppress Sin and Wickedness and promote the contrary, we should soon come to live in Peace, and in the due Exercise &amp; Prac∣tice of all true Godliness and Honesty. And then should we prosper in all our Undertakings, and see Good according to the Years wherein we have seen Evil; Glory also would dwell in our Land. And we should have occasion to raise that note of Triumph, <HI>The Lord of HOST is with us, The GOD of Jacob is our Refuge,</HI> Selah.</P>
