<HEAD>A SERMON.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 CHRON. XX.11, 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Behold I say how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit. O our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might against this great Company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do; but our eyes are upon Thee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN we are called to enter upon any thing that is very arduous or difficult, it is commonly of no small advantage to consult the lives of the <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> and carefully observe how <HI>they</HI> conducted on similar occasions.</P>
<P>A variety of beautiful examples as well as ad∣mirable rules for the regulation of our conduct in life, so as to be ornaments to society, and blessings to our fellow creatures, are scattered in the divine oracles.</P>
<P>Among the numerous <HI>examples</HI> of this kind, scarce any are either more lovely in themselves, or more worthy of our observation, especially at the present day, than those wherein the saint and the soldier were united.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="014450_0004_0F925F7505CD7940" MS="y"/>A character like this shines with a peculiarly charming lustre.</P>
<P>What can give us a more exalted idea of hu∣man nature, than to see Moses, Joshua, David, and others of a like nobleness of soul going forth un∣dauntedly against their enemies, with <HI>the word of God in their mouths,</HI> as well as <HI>a two-edged sword in their hands?</HI></P>
<P>One but little inferior▪ to them, either as to holi∣ness or heroism, is presented us in our text, which is part of a concise or short prayer to heaven.</P>
<P>In speaking to the words, I shall by divine leave consider particularly, though very briefly, the character of the person who makes this pray∣er;—the occasion upon which he prays;—and also the prayer itself.</P>
<P>The person, who thus solemnly addresses him∣self to heaven, is the excellent and renowned king Jehoshaphat.—A prince very rich, prudent and powerful, of an amiable disposition and unble∣mished character.</P>
<P>The sacred Historian observes, that▪ in the beginning of his reign, <HI>he strengthened himself a∣gainst Israel, and placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</HI></P>
<P>This was acting a very prudent and commenda∣ble part; but sensible however of this eternal truth, that <HI>there was no wisdom or counsel against the Lord;</HI> it is added, that <HI>he sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments: Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Johoshaphat pre∣sents, and he had riches in abundance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014450_0005_0F925F7542C83820"/>He now sets upon the very pinacle of honour, in a situation extremely critical. For in honor of preferment, there is something intoxicating, which is commonly too much for weak heads.</P>
<P>But how is it with Jehoshaphat? How does he behave himself in this exalted station, and un∣der the richest smiles of prosperity?</P>
<P>'Tis said, that hereupon <HI>his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Little contracted souls would have been lifted up with pride; but the noble Prince was of too generous and exalted a make to be guilty of su∣percilious haughtiness. <HI>His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.</HI> A sublime elation of spirit this!</P>
<P>Jehoshaphat's <HI>pleasantness</HI> and <HI>affability</HI> to his soldiers, is also worthy of remark.</P>
<P>When <HI>they rose up early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tek<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a to battle; as they went forth, he stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye stand; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, that should praise the beauty of holiness▪ as they went out before the Army, and to say, Praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever.</HI></P>
<P>Such an apparent tenderness toward his men, accompanied with professed confidence in the divine protection▪ was doubtless of very happy conse∣quence, filling them with great love and respect to their generous commander, and raising their spirits to a sublime pitch.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="014450_0006_0F925F7600334CD0"/>How beautiful to see intrepidity, without rash∣ness or pride? Courage guided by counsel and wisdom, and an air of dignity softened by gentleness and sweetness of behaviour! But I can recollect scarce any thing recorded of this good king that does him more honor than the <HI>prayer</HI> in our <HI>text;</HI> the occasion whereof was this—A very nu∣merous host, consisting of the inhabitants of Am∣mon, Moab and Mount Seir, had come up against him, and invaded his dominions.</P>
<P>Upon receiving intelligence of which, <HI>Jehosha∣phat set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a Fast throughout all Judah: And Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, be∣fore the new Court.</HI></P>
<P>When I figure to myself the pious and amiable Monarch, standing on the <HI>brazen Scaffold</HI> which Solomon had erected for <HI>that purpose,</HI> and in the midst of a very numerous assembly, spreading forth his hands, and solemnly addressing the blessed and only Potentate, in behalf of himself and his be∣loved people, I confess I am <HI>struck with admira∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, on <HI>one</HI> side, the young, the delicate and fair, sinking under distress and fear at the <HI>present</HI> alarm; on <HI>another</HI> stand the venerable Judges and Elders of Israel, whose heads were whitened with age.</P>
<P>On <HI>one</HI> side are fathers anxious for the safety of their dear families and country; on <HI>another,</HI> tender afflicted mothers, with their little children.</P>
<P><HI>Here,</HI> with countenances <HI>sedate,</HI> stand rows of statesmen and politicians; <HI>there,</HI> a numerous
<PB N="9" REF="014450_0007_0F925F7A641FAA58"/>
throng of brave and gallant soldiers: <HI>All</HI> in <HI>deep∣est silence,</HI> and with their eyes <HI>fixed</HI> on their greatly beloved and much respected <HI>Prince,</HI> listen∣ing to hear him begin his solemn address to heaven.</P>
<P>Whereupon, with the greatest solemnity, he at length breaks forth in these pertinent and moving expressions, <HI>O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in Heaven? And rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? And in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?</HI></P>
<P>How lovely to see a <HI>Prince</HI> earnestly <HI>interceed∣ing</HI> at the throne of grace for his <HI>people,</HI> and the people all joining in the intercession, no less anxi∣ous for the preservation of their prince!</P>
<P>The most noble king Jehoshaphat, upon some <HI>special</HI> occasions, did not disdain or refuse to offi∣ciate as <HI>Chaplain.</HI></P>
<P>Far from thinking this beneath his dignity (as too many others have done who were unworthy to loose the latchet of his shoes) he rather accounts it a great honour and privilege, that he who feels himself to be but dust, is permited to speak to the supreme, infinite Majesty.</P>
<P>But I now proceed to a particular consideration of Jehoshaphat's <HI>prayer,</HI> more especially that part of it which our <HI>text</HI> contains; wherein these <HI>four</HI> things are very observable:</P>
<P>He pleads the goodness and righteousness of his <HI>cause,</HI> appeals to God to judge between him and his enemies, acknowledges his utter <HI>inability</HI> without divine assistance, either to conquer or with∣stand them, and professes to repose an entire trust and confidence in God.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014450_0008_0F925F7A98A6F578"/>First, He pleads the goodness and righteous∣ness of his <HI>cause. Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.</HI> In the preceeding verse, he intimates that his people had always behaved <HI>inoffensive</HI> toward these invaders; never giving them any occasion thus to commence hostilities. And now behold, says he, <HI>the children of Ammon, and Moab, and Mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Epypt; but they turned from them and de∣stroyed them</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Moses in the second chapter of Deuteronomy relates that God had forbidden Israel to destroy or distress these nations, commanding them to live peaceably by them as neighbours and brethren.</P>
<P>This prohibition or command, they had care∣fully and religiously observed; insomuch that when the haughty Kings of these nations refused to grant them leave to march through their terri∣tories into the land of Canaan, instead of making them feel the bitter effects of their resentment, they turned from them and went to their promised possession another way.</P>
<P>And now what vile returns are made by the children of Ammon, Moab, and Edom, for this indulgence? Living nigh, they knew full well what wonders God had wrought for Israel; how he had destroyed the heathen before them, and gi∣ven them the land of Canaan for their inheritance.</P>
<P>They could not fail of knowing likewise, that unless propitious Heaven had forbid, <HI>they them∣selves,</HI> no less than the nations round about them, would have been destroyed by Israel's conquering sword.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="014450_0009_0F925F7C4192D500"/>Their very <HI>existence</HI> was, in a great measure, owing to <HI>this,</HI> that the hearts of this victorious people were softened and drawn out in benevo∣lence toward them, so as to let them live quietly by their very borders, while they crushed and ut∣terly extirpated others.</P>
<P>Why therefore this <HI>invasion?</HI> What an <HI>unpro∣voked</HI> injury are the invaders guilty of?</P>
<P>Who gave them the licence to seize the land of Israel, or endeavour to dispossess this highly sa∣voured people of the inheritance which their God had bequeathed them? Or who <HI>provoked</HI> them thus to over-leap their own boundaries?</P>
<P>Jehoshaphat and his people stood in a <HI>good</HI> cause; in the just defence of every thing that was dear and sacred, while their <HI>enemies</HI> acted the part of bloody villains and robbers.</P>
<P>And by the way, 'tis of the last importance that when engaged in matters of great consequence, we be thoroughly convinced that our cause is <HI>just</HI>; so fully convinced of this that we may with humble boldness bring it to the <HI>throne of grace,</HI> and plead and vindicate it there.</P>
<P>This necessarily gives <HI>life</HI> and <HI>animation,</HI> amidst difficulties and dangers; for though we should chance to die in defence of such a cause, allowing it to be sufficiently <HI>important</HI> and <HI>prudently</HI> mana∣ged, our lives would not be foolishly thrown away, but honorably laid down in obedience to a divine call.</P>
<P>But secondly, The good King Jehoshaphat ap∣peals to God to judge between him and his ene∣mies.—</P>
<P><HI>O! our God, wilt thou not judge them?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="014450_0010_0F925F7CB92A23D8"/>As if he had said, is it consistent with the <HI>honour</HI> of thy wise and righteous government to suffer such high handed injustice and wickedness to go off <HI>triumphant?</HI> while these avaricious and grasp∣ing nations, not content with their own pleasant allotments, have without the least provocation, confederated together in order to deprive us of this goodly land, of our privileges and every thing that is dear, can thy thunders <HI>sleep</HI>? can vengeance be <HI>inactive</HI>? With respect to the <HI>righteousness</HI> of our <HI>cause,</HI> Lord, we humbly ap∣peal to thee. Thou knowest that we are injured and unjustly invaded. Self-preservation is a law of thine, ingraven on our hearts, and written in thy word; a <HI>violation</HI> of which would be highly sin∣ful. Therefore not only <HI>interest</HI> but our own <HI>consciences</HI> forbid us to <HI>relinquish</HI> this cause: And wilt Thou not plead and vindicate it, by putting our enemies to shame and confusion?</P>
<P><HI>The judge of all the earth</HI> ever did and ever will <HI>do right;</HI> and whenever he suffers a <HI>righteous</HI> cause to be <HI>lost,</HI> it is through the <HI>mismanagement</HI> and <HI>wickedness</HI> of those who are <HI>concerned</HI> in it, and because they will not suitably implore his counsel and assistance, or walk agreeable to his rules and directions.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> thing noted as worthy of observation in this excellent <HI>prayer</HI> of Jehoshaphat, <HI>is,</HI> that he acknowledges his utter <HI>inability,</HI> without divine assistance, either to conquer or withstand his inva∣ding foes.</P>
<P><HI>We have no might against this great company that cometh against us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014450_0011_0F925F7D782EB0C0"/>He does not say our own strength is <HI>small</HI> and <HI>insufficient</HI>; but we have <HI>no</HI> might—Of <HI>ourselves</HI> we are <HI>nothing</HI> and can <HI>do nothing.</HI></P>
<P>And to the want of <HI>power</HI> be subjoins also his confession of their want of <HI>wisdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Neither know we what to do,</HI> says he.</P>
<P>Power and wisdom are two most <HI>essential</HI> things, which they who <HI>lack</HI> are indeed very <HI>poorly</HI> equipt for <HI>war.</HI></P>
<P>But could Jehoshaphat with a <HI>good</HI> grace con∣fess and plead <HI>his</HI> want of these?</P>
<P>The sacred, infallible history wherein his wor∣thy deeds are recorded, mentions his having eleven hundred and sixty thousand mighty men of valour (if I <HI>rightly</HI> enumerated them) <HI>exclusive</HI> of those whom the king <HI>put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.</HI></P>
<P>It is also there observed that <HI>he wared great exceedingly, building castles and cities of store in Judah; that the Philistines were tributary to him, and the Arabians brought him presents.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis universally confess'd that he was a <HI>wise</HI> prince, and had, no doubt, a number of choice and prudent <HI>councellors.</HI> How then could he say, <HI>we have no might and know not what to do?</HI></P>
<P>This indeed is no <HI>paradox.</HI></P>
<P>He very well knew, and piously and wisely considered that though his walls were never so lofty and impregnable, or his armies never so nu∣merous and brave, he must quickly sink and fall, unless favoured by <HI>divine</HI> assistance.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all his <HI>seeming</HI> might and prowess, he <HI>felt</HI> himself to be a weak and feeble creature, entirely <HI>dependant</HI> upon God for protec∣tion and success.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="014450_0012_0F925F7E359D1130"/>Very <HI>far</HI> from any of us be the impious thought that we can possibly be under such advantageous circumstances in our warlike engagements as <HI>not</HI> to need the aids of Heaven.</P>
<P>To trust in our <HI>own</HI> bow, is not <HI>true courage,</HI> but <HI>madness.</HI></P>
<P>But lastly, the pious king Jehoshaphat, in his prayer, professes to repose an entire trust and con∣fidence in <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our eyes,</HI> he says, <HI>are upon thee.</HI></P>
<P>We look to Thee, trust in Thee, and depend upon Thee alone.</P>
<P><HI>Help, Lord, for vain is the help of man.</HI></P>
<P>He seems entirely sensible of this truth, <HI>Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>chief</HI> strength, he well knew, did not lie in the wisdom of his politicians, or in the numbers and bravery of his soldiers.—These, of themselves, are but broken reeds.</P>
<P>People are apt to repose <HI>too</HI> great a share of their confidence in an <HI>arm of flesh,</HI> as if their <HI>own</HI> skill and power could do all for them; <HI>but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, nor let the rich man glory in his riches.</HI></P>
<P>Vain is the boasted power of creatures of the dust, who <HI>pride</HI> themselves in their craft and strength, and vain are all their designs and strata∣gems, any further than, as they are, for wise and holy ends, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mited by him who is the high pos∣sessor and sovereign ruler of Heaven and earth.</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> can with infinite ease baffle and discon∣cert the deepest laid schemes, or <HI>cause one to chase a thousand and ten to put ten thousand to flight.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="014450_0013_0F925F7EF74EB4E8"/>Therefore it is the great <HI>wisdom and interest,</HI> as well as <HI>duty</HI> of a people or army, to put their entire trust in <HI>Him</HI> for deliverence and success, when under distressing difficulties, and especially if called forth in a <HI>righteous</HI> cause to war against their enemies.</P>
<P>For if they do this, <HI>they need not fear what man can do unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Though surrounded by innumerable dangers, and all hopes of victory or escape, in an <HI>ordinary</HI> way of providence, should be cut off, still they have an <HI>unfailing</HI> refuge. Let them, with hearts <HI>sincere and duly</HI> affected, look up to Heaven and say, <HI>we have no might, neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon Thee;</HI> and the numerous wheels of divine providence would doubtless soon be set in swift motion for their relief.</P>
<P>Nay, rather than they should <HI>fail of success,</HI> the very <HI>stars</HI> in their courses would <HI>fight</HI> for them, and the Lord would bring forth to the de∣struction of their enemies, <HI>his treasures of hail,</HI> the <HI>thunder of his power,</HI> and the forky lightning, which he hath <HI>reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war.</HI></P>
<P>You will now suffer me to offer a few <HI>reflections</HI> that may naturally arise from the <HI>subject,</HI> viewed in connection with the <HI>present solemn occasion,</HI> and <HI>your peculiar</HI> situation.</P>
<P>The tokens of divine displeasure that we lie under are <HI>too</HI> numerous for me to <HI>particularize:</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>few</HI> of which were hinted at in the <HI>morning,</HI> when we were called to mourn a <HI>departing</HI> God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sacred passage, which <HI>then</HI> directed our me∣ditations, was Hosea ix.12. Yea, wo also to them when I depart from them.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014450_0014_0F925F7FDBF2B190"/>It would be <HI>painful</HI> to me to continue harping upon the <HI>plaintive</HI> string, especially when ad∣dressing myself to those who share <HI>too deeply</HI> in our public troubles and distresses, <HI>not</HI> to have an <HI>impressive sense</HI> of them.</P>
<P>To turn the <HI>bright</HI> side of things to view is much more pleasant and agreeable.</P>
<P>Let it suffice therefore to say that a dark cloud charged with fearful artillery, seems to be gather∣ing and blackening around us; insomuch that the language of divine providence to our long and highly favoured land has of late been evidently <HI>this; Blow the trumpet in Zion, call a solemn as∣sembly, proclaim a fast.</HI> The trumpet has been blown, solemn assemblies have been called, &amp; <HI>such</HI> a fast is proclaimed as <HI>this</HI> land never <HI>before</HI> saw.</P>
<P>The peculiarly solemn day is <HI>now</HI> revolving, when humble confessions and fervent prayers from the numerous societies and assemblies, throughout all these United Colonies, (a much larger extent of territory than Jehoshaphat was possessed of) are ascending up to the <HI>Lord of Sabaoth.</HI></P>
<P>The united voice of the colonies in setting apart this day for <HI>humiliation</HI> and <HI>prayer,</HI> as well as their remarkable and very happy <HI>union</HI> in <HI>other</HI> respects, I must interpret as an omen for <HI>good: for the infinitely</HI> compassionate God <HI>never said to the seed of Jacob, seek ye me in vain.</HI></P>
<P>But of what avail would be to us to fast and cry to Heaven imploring divine assistance in an <HI>unjust</HI> and <HI>wicked</HI> cause?</P>
<P>It was a heavy charge against Israel that they <HI>fasted for strife and debate, and to smite with the fists of wickedness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="014450_0015_0F925F80715009E8"/>And are <HI>we</HI> also chargeable with this foul im∣putation? Are we in <HI>real rebellion</HI> against our lawful sovereign? Have we risen up in opposition to his <HI>just and salutary</HI> laws, and <HI>without sufficient reason</HI> cast off his government?</P>
<P>And do we then pretend to seek God to aid and assist us in our <HI>traiterous</HI> proceedings?</P>
<P>Heaven daring assurance, monstrous impiety, would this be! But though a very guilty peo∣ple; thanks be to those kind, divine restraints that have kept us from being guilty of <HI>this</HI> charge.</P>
<P>We not only <HI>think</HI> but <HI>know</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> that we have great reason to complain of <HI>oppression and ty∣ranny;</HI> that our privileges civil and sacred, and our property are all at stake, and that we are loud∣ly called upon to defend them at the <HI>risk</HI> of <HI>life.</HI></P>
<P>If the sight be not too piteous and affecting, turn your eyes to our <HI>metropolis, once princess among these provinces, now a garrison</HI> of merce∣nary British troops; and its miserable inhabitants exposed to the resentment and rage of those, whose very <HI>tender mercies are cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>See those <HI>haughty</HI> ships of war: observe their <HI>hostile</HI> appearance, and consider their no less <HI>hostile designs.</HI> View the <HI>ashes</HI> of pleasant CHARLES∣TOWN. Remember LEXINGTON, CHEL∣SEA, and <HI>yonder</HI> never to be forgotten HILL, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Banker Hill.</NOTE> lately bedewed by some of our <HI>richest</HI> blood.</P>
<P><HI>Behold, I say, how</HI> our unnatural enemies <HI>re∣ward us to come to cast us out of the possession which the Lord our God hath given us to inherit; the possession</HI>▪ which our <HI>fore-fathers</HI> purchased with their <HI>blood</HI> and <HI>treasure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="014450_0016_0F925F819EF9C388"/>O <HI>Britain, Britain!</HI> are <HI>these</HI> sufficiently kind returns for <HI>our</HI> having contributed long and largely to thy wealth and grandeur?</P>
<P>That <HI>England</HI> and <HI>not we,</HI> have been the <HI>ag∣gressors</HI> is undeniably evident.</P>
<P>We used ever to consider <HI>their</HI> interest and hap∣piness as intimately connected with <HI>our own.</HI></P>
<P>Entirely content that they should preside in our government, so far as was agreeable to our charter-privileges, and aggrandize themselves by <HI>monopo∣lizing</HI> our trade; we delighted to treat them with dutiful respect as a <HI>parent state</HI>; rejoicing at their rising glory, and pleased to see their lofty spires, though glittering with American gold.</P>
<P>But <HI>this</HI> was not <HI>enough</HI> —We must be all submission to the <HI>supremacy of parliament</HI>: a par∣liament too the most corrupt and infamous that ever <HI>disgraced</HI> any nation.</P>
<P>We must be <HI>taxed without our consent.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, we must be <HI>slaves,</HI> learn to grovel in the dust, and from thence look up to our impe∣rious <HI>masters,</HI> in order to receive from <HI>their</HI> griping hands, the scanty pittance which they might please to afford us.—</P>
<P>Refusing obedience to these extraordinary man∣datos, our <HI>charter</HI> was <HI>mutilated,</HI> or rather entirely <HI>vacated</HI> and <HI>destroyed</HI>: fleets and armies were sent to our <HI>capital,</HI> our <HI>trade</HI> was <HI>impeded,</HI> and almost every branch of business greatly <HI>distressed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Violence and oppression</HI> daily <HI>increasing</HI> on <HI>one</HI> hand, and <HI>prudent</HI> measures being come into on the <HI>other,</HI> in order to obtain <HI>redress</HI> of our nume∣rous grievances and <HI>evade</HI> the galling chains, that were prepared for us, the memorable period at length came, when open <HI>hostilities</HI> commenced.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="014450_0017_0F925F82404A8DF0"/>That the <HI>Lexington</HI> battle was <HI>begun</HI> by the <HI>British</HI> troops, is what with us admits of <HI>no</HI> doubt.</P>
<P>But allowing for once (though far from any <HI>colour</HI> of truth) that <HI>our</HI> party begun the fight, still, as the <HI>others</HI> went out with an avowed design to <HI>steal,</HI> and to <HI>rob us of our property, they</HI> in reality were the <HI>first aggressors</HI>;
<Q>for he that arms him∣self to commit a robbery and demands the tra∣veller's purse by the terror of instant death, is the first aggressor, though the other should take the advantage of discharging his pistol first and killing the robber.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">President Langdon's Election Discourse.</NOTE></P>
<P>Matters being <HI>thus</HI> stated, does it not plainly follow that our cause is <HI>good</HI> and of the <HI>last im∣portance,</HI> and that we may therefore humbly ap∣peal to <HI>God,</HI> to <HI>judge</HI> between us and our enemies? —<HI>O our God, wilt thou not judge them?</HI> Wilt thou not graciously interpose in behalf of a much injured, afflicted and oppressed people, putting their unrighteous invaders and oppressors to <HI>shame</HI> and <HI>confusion?</HI></P>
<P>Though utterly <HI>unworthy</HI> of so great a favor, we humbly hope and trust Thou <HI>wilt.</HI></P>
<P>It is recorded of a <HI>Turkish</HI> general, that being called to engage a <HI>christian</HI> army, which had bro∣ken through the most solemn ties, he stood up at the head of his troops, and then taking out the <HI>treaty</HI> that they had violated, and holding it up to view, thus addressed the throne of Heaven▪
<Q>O Almighty Being, if thou art, as they say thou art, these christians God, thou lovest what is right and hatest <HI>perfidy</HI>; look down therefore and behold this treaty which <HI>they</HI> have broken,
<PB N="20" REF="014450_0018_0F925F841419FB18"/>
and as Thou canst not favor what is wrong, render <HI>their</HI> arms <HI>successless</HI> and make <HI>mine victorious.</HI></Q>
— He ended—immediately the sword was <HI>drawn</HI>— The two parties vigorously engaged, and the perfidious <HI>christians</HI> were beat∣en off the field.</P>
<P>And may not <HI>we</HI> also hold up a <HI>broken charter,</HI> the cruel <HI>port bill</HI> and the most impious and in∣famous <HI>Quebec bill</HI>; adding to these, the inhu∣man▪ unequaled <HI>treachery</HI> exercised toward the distress'd inhabitants of <HI>Boston,</HI> as witnesses of the <HI>perfidy</HI> of our <HI>enemies,</HI> and what their designs upon us are?</P>
<P>Kind Heaven hath heard our cries owned the JUSTICE OF OUR CAUSE, and appeared for us in numerous ways almost miraculous.</P>
<P>The holy and mighty arm of God hath lately gotten us repeated and most surprizing victories</P>
<P>To <HI>Him</HI> is the glory due, who hath animated our soldiers with courage truly astonishing.</P>
<P>To <HI>Him</HI> is the glory due, who hath <HI>already</HI> crowned some of them with the brightest laurels of victory; and hath so dispirited our enemies there∣by, that they are pining away in tormenting disap∣pointment, almost forced to confess that <HI>there is no enchantment against Jacob, or divination against Israel.</HI></P>
<P>What then remains, but that we repose our en∣tire trust and confidence in this almighty, most kind and gracious Being, who hath thus begun to appear for us?</P>
<P>Blessed be God, if we look to <HI>second</HI> causes, we have wise and able politicians, gallant officers, and many thousands of as brave, undaunted soldi∣ers as ever faced a foe; but still there is abundant
<PB N="21" REF="014450_0019_0F925F84477560C8"/>
reason to confess that of ourselves <HI>we have no might</HI> against our enemies, <HI>neither know what to do.</HI></P>
<P>And to this confession, we may justly add an humble acknowledgment of our shameful <HI>back∣slidings</HI> and <HI>sinfulness</HI> as a people, and our utter <HI>unworthiness</HI> of divine favors.</P>
<P>With hearts deeply affected under a sense of this, may we all break off our <HI>sins</HI> by repentance, saying with afflicted Israel, "Come and let us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us, he hath smitten, and he will bind us up."</P>
<P>O, what a favourable prospect might be af∣forded us by a universal <HI>reformation</HI>!—The whole face of nature would seem hereby to be changed, and to put on a chearful smile.</P>
<P><HI>Our light would break forth as the morning, and our health spring forth speedily: our righteousness would go before us, and the glory of the Lord be our rereward.</HI></P>
<P>As this therefore would be so <HI>beautiful</HI> in <HI>it∣self,</HI> and productive of so many happy conse∣quences, you will not be offended, <HI>gentlemen and soldiers,</HI> if upon <HI>this solemn occasion</HI> I earnestly urge it upon <HI>you,</HI> not forgetting that I <HI>myself</HI> also have great need of the exhortation.</P>
<P>You have come forth to jeopard your lives in defence of your friends and relations, your coun∣try, religion, liberty, and almost every thing that is dear and sacred. In a <HI>nobler</HI> cause, mortals were never engaged</P>
<P>Of your cordial love to your country and gene∣ral courage and resolution to defend it, none can entertain a doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="014450_0020_0F925F84F06000B0"/>There is not, I presume, a <HI>single one</HI> among you all, who would not <HI>disdain</HI> to be guilty of <HI>cowardice,</HI> to desert his colours, or let his sword rest quietly in its scabbard, whenever <HI>the Lord gives it a charge</HI> against the invaders of <HI>Boston and the sea shore.</HI></P>
<P>May your abhorrence of every vicious prac∣tice, and strict adherence to the rules of virtue and religion, be no less conspicuous than your cou∣rage and magnanimity.</P>
<P>What a pity 'tis, dear friends, that the <HI>camp</HI> should so commonly be a school of <HI>vice?</HI> that they who are <HI>most exposed</HI> to death, should be <HI>least</HI> careful to <HI>prepare</HI> for it?</P>
<P>Will you not endeavour to <HI>wipe</HI> off this odium, which of late years, I am sorry to say, has with <HI>too much</HI> reason, been cast upon soldiers? If you are careful that your behaviour be virtuous and exemplary, those abandoned, dissolute troops, that <HI>disgrace</HI> Britain, instead of bringing a soldier's life <HI>hare</HI> into contempt, would be <HI>foils</HI> to set off <HI>your characters,</HI> and make them shine with a more beau∣tiful lustre.</P>
<P>It has been frequently observed, to the signal honour of our <HI>present</HI> American forces, that in ge∣neral, they are remarkably <HI>civil well-behaved,</HI> and <HI>free</HI> from <HI>drunkeness, prophaneness,</HI> or any <HI>other</HI> scandalous practices.</P>
<P><HI>How goodly are thy tents. O Jacob, and thy ta∣bernacles, O Israel!</HI> —How beautiful and lovely to see so large an army of men inspired with heroic sentiments, engaged in a glorious cause, animated therein by the most generous motives, and in a <HI>general</HI> view, <HI>strangers</HI> to the
<PB N="23" REF="014450_0021_0F925F8869B27BF8"/>
shameful <HI>vices,</HI> to which soldiers of the present age (our provincials excepted) have been <HI>com∣monly</HI> and almost <HI>universally</HI> addicted!</P>
<P>That each day may set your respective charac∣ters in a still <HI>fairer</HI> light, is the hearty prayer of every well-wisher to his country.—I beg and beseech you industriously to cultivate and promote union, peace, love, harmony and friendship among yourselves.— <HI>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren,</HI> or soldiers in one common cause, <HI>to dwell together in unity!</HI></P>
<P>With respect to those of you who are in <HI>office,</HI> may I be allowed, gentlemen, to say, I flatter myself that you will always endeavour to answer the <HI>just</HI> expectations of those, who have volunta∣rily chosen you for their commanders, treating your men with <HI>affability, kindness</HI> and <HI>tenderness,</HI> setting before them examples of <HI>virtue,</HI> and using your utmost influence to <HI>suppress</HI> all vice and im∣morality.</P>
<P>You, who are <HI>soldiers,</HI> will I trust do honour to yourselves and country, by being <HI>orderly</HI> and <HI>go∣vernable,</HI> as well as <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>courageous</HI> always paying a <HI>due defference</HI> to the commands of your <HI>officers.</HI></P>
<P>And may all of you, <HI>gentlemen</HI> and <HI>soldiers,</HI> in your several departments, exert yourselves to <HI>purge</HI> from the <HI>camp every accursed thing.</HI> Nor is it sufficient that you be <HI>negatively</HI> good or free from <HI>open, scandalous</HI> vices; but, if you would be safe and happy here, and at last enjoy the bright unfading glories of <HI>Heaven,</HI> you <HI>must</HI> be <HI>born again, washed, sanctified and justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus,</HI> and by his spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="014450_0022_0F925F8A0942F8C0"/>You must inlist under the great captain of sal∣vation; and this should be done <HI>speedily</HI> or it <HI>may</HI> be too late. Let me, dear souls, "address you as a dying man to dying men."</P>
<P>To <HI>others</HI> and to <HI>all,</HI> it may with propriety be said, boast <HI>not yourselves of to-morrow; for ye know not what a day may bring forth:</HI> but who are so exposed as <HI>you,</HI> to be <HI>suddenly</HI> snatched out of time into eternity?</P>
<P>Think not that your being <HI>soldiers</HI> bold and brave <HI>secures</HI> you from the arrests of death. Is he that rides upon the pale horse afraid to ven∣ture upon a <HI>soldier</HI>? The dying groans of millions who have fallen in battle, witness that he is not.</P>
<P>Think not that religion is <HI>unbecoming</HI> your profession.—A thousand things might be said, and numerous instances offered, to show that to join the christian to the soldier, is highly beautiful and ornamental.</P>
<P>Think not that true, vital piety, is <HI>unnecessary</HI> for a soldier. If you find yourselves <HI>fatally</HI> pier∣ced with the instruments of death; if you feel the silver cord of life <HI>losing,</HI> and your souls gush∣ing out in a flow of blood, you will be convinced of the contrary.</P>
<P>Let me be <HI>importunate</HI> in pressing upon you the one thing <HI>needful,</HI> or a preparation for death, by securing a <HI>saving</HI> interest in him, who is <HI>the resur∣rection and the life.</HI></P>
<P>As this is of the last importance, I beg and in∣treat you by all that is dear and sacred, dreadful or delightful, not to neglect or postpone it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="014450_0023_0F925F8A3A54F008"/>What shall I further say?—I fear I have trespassed <HI>already</HI> too long upon your patience. Will therefore add but <HI>little</HI> more than my ardent wishes for your success and happiness. You have, dear brethren, the daily prayers of many thousands. Your ministers, your friends, and your whole country, endeared by every tender tie. (a very few only excepted) are <HI>anxious</HI> for your safety and success.</P>
<P>When, at a distance, we hear the cannons roar, we are paired with anxious concern for you; and our hearts replete with tenderness inexpressible, re-echo to every volley, "Heaven protect, de∣fend and succeed the brave and generous guar∣dians of our privileges and lives." The very <HI>infants,</HI> at their mothers breasts, I had almost said, lisp out a prayer for you.</P>
<P>May the infinitely gracious God hear <HI>the</HI> nu∣merous petitions that are offered up in your be∣half. May He screen you from al harm, render your arms victorious, and in his own time, gently waft <HI>you</HI> and <HI>all</HI> of us to those calm and peaceful regions, where the ear is not wounded with the confused noise of war nor the eye tormented with the piteous, affecting sight of mangled bodies, and garments rolled in blood; where joy unspeakably sublime forever dwells; where hateful tyrants, cruel oppressors, and traiterous villains, <HI>stained</HI> with the blood of their country, without repentance and a thorough change, can never come.</P>
