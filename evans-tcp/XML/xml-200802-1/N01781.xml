<HEAD>A Dialogue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Boston</HI> Gentleman. SIR,
UNderstanding you are come down to represent your Town in the approaching Session, I heartily <HI>congratulate</HI> you on the same: And seeing the divine Providence, which Superintends humane Affairs, has allotted you that Service, I hope you will approve your self <HI>a sincere Lover of your Country,</HI> and make it abundantly evident, that <HI>our most valuable Interests</HI> lay near your Heart.</P>
<P>It is also my earnest Wish, that his Ex∣cellency, and the whole General Assembly may enjoy the Divine Conduct and Di∣rection, in all the weighty and Arduous Affairs that may come before them,; and so be (under Heaven) <HI>the happy Instruments of lengthning out our Tranquility.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002111_0003_0FBB83857934F948"/>
The <HI>Country</HI> Gentleman. Sir, I most passionately pronounce Amen to your Wish; and as to my self, as it has ever been my Ambition, so (I trust) it shall be my unshaken Resolution, instead of Sacrificing the publick Good, and Ship∣wrecking a good Conscience <HI>to gratify a few designing Men,</HI> to lay out my self, as I have Ability and Opportunity in the service of my dear, native Country. I confess things look Discouraging, in as much as the Times may justly be said to be <HI>troublous</HI>; in Re∣gard of the Divisions and Animosities which are among us; but I hope <HI>Good</HI> will come out of <HI>Evil,</HI> and a <HI>Serene Morning</HI> succeed▪ a <HI>Stormy Night.</HI></P>
<P><HI>B. Gent.</HI> Your Resolutions are worthy a Man of Honour, and those who invincibly ad∣here to such Resolves, do truly <HI>merit Praise,</HI> the love of which is a Passion deeply fixed in the mind of every extraordinary Person; and those who are most affected with it, seem most to partake of that <HI>divine particle,</HI> which distinguishes mankind from the inferior Creation. The Stoicks say, we reasonably owe more to our native Country, than to all other things in this lower World, as she Impales the rest we love and cherish;
<PB N="3" REF="002111_0004_0FBB8386F9D10298"/>
and who stand firm in her preservation, &amp; on the contrary must necessarily perish with her.</P>
<P>From this generous Affection, so many em∣inent Actions have taken Birth, of such HEROES as have gloriously exposed their Lives for the preservation of their Country, and laid aside their <HI>private Injuries,</HI> for fear of revenging them at the <HI>publick Ex∣pence.</HI></P>
<P>Such indeed, challenge a peculiar Reve∣rence and Respect, as they are made Instru∣ments of the Conservation and Protection of Men; and acquire a Universal Repu∣tation, which is the last degree of happiness <HI>here,</HI> and after they are fallen Asleep, it may be said of them;
<Q><L>'Look thro' yon Azure Vault! what Rays of Light</L>
<L>'Dart from the HEROES glitt'ring Forms! How Bright</L>
<L>'Their Radiant Crowns! —</L>
<L>'While here their Country's Weal had their Regards,</L>
<L>'Now Heaven bestows munificent Rewards:</L>
<L>'As in the Orb of glorious Deeds they mov'd,</L>
<L>'Superiour Glories crown their Heads above.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002111_0005_0FBB83897098D778"/>Thus their Memory, which is <HI>precious,</HI> shall be transmitted to the latest Posteri∣ty, to their Immortal Honour: On the other Hand, with what marks of Infamy do they deserve to be stigmatiz'd, who (tho' Heaven has Liberally furnish'd them with large A∣bilities to benefit Mankind) are acted by a <HI>mean, norrow, contracted spirit,</HI> may be ar∣gued from what I have said: (for contra∣ries illustrate each other.) This may be called <HI>sordid Frugality</HI> with a witness; when Men are influenc'd by private views, and on every Occasion sacrifice the <HI>publick</HI> Good to their <HI>particular</HI> Interests; most certainly the memories of such shall be accurst.</P>
<P><HI>C. Gent.</HI> What you have said is agreeable to the Sentiments of Mankind in general; but, Sir, what are we to think of the <HI>Ani∣mosities, Jarrs,</HI> and <HI>Contentions,</HI> that spirit of <HI>Party</HI> and <HI>Faction</HI> prevailing among us; (tho' we have a GOVERNOUR, other Plan∣tations would give thousands of Pounds to enjoy) Doth not <HI>this</HI> look with an ill aspect?</P>
<P><HI>B. Gent.</HI> Truly <HI>this</HI> is matter of Lamen∣tation, and will be so to all good men; for the universal Suffrage of Mankind, and the Oracles of Eternal Truth, do abundantly e∣vince,
<PB N="5" REF="002111_0006_0FBB838AB6C63B68"/>
that a <HI>House</HI> or <HI>City, i. e.</HI> any Com∣munity of whatever Denomination, must in∣evitably fall and come to Ruin, when di∣vided against it self.</P>
<P><HI>C. Gent.</HI> But what do you assign as the O∣rigin, and Source of our Divisions; is not the <HI>want of a Medium,</HI> think you, one great Cause?</P>
<P><HI>B. Gent.</HI> The want of a Medium may, no doubt, be assign'd as one great cause of our Calamities; for the Silver and Gold be∣ing Ship'd off, and the Paper Bills exhaust∣ed; what <HI>Oppression, Injustice,</HI> and <HI>cruel U∣sury;</HI> what <HI>tricking, cheating, defrauding,</HI> and <HI>overeaching,</HI> like a Deluge, has over∣flow'd us? to the grievous Scandal of the Christian Name.</P>
<P>Hence it is that the various Schemes, &amp; projections, and Sentiments of Men (as their particular Interests, and private views have led them) have been exhibited, and almost an infinite number of Pamphlets dispersed thro' the Country; to this are owing, the Contests and Controversies among us, which have been managed with such <HI>furious Zeal,</HI> and <HI>Party warmth,</HI> as has ended in Enmity, and utter Alienation: But to say no more
<PB N="6" REF="002111_0007_0FBB838CF4AD90B0"/>
of former things; what think you of Mr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s <HI>distressed state of Boston,</HI> with the se∣veral Answers; and what Reception do they meet with among you in the Country.</P>
<P><HI>C. Gent.</HI> Altho' the Government saw good very highly to resent some passages in that Treatise, yet I verily believe the Gentleman <HI>was far from designing any Reflection</HI> on it (as he solemnly declares, pag. 9.) but that the Good and Happiness of the Town and Country were lying near his Heart; and that <HI>most</HI> of the things therein contained are mat∣ters of Fact, is obvious to every man, who is acquainted with the circumstances of things, which he has set in a <HI>true light,</HI> in the Judgment of all Judicious Men, whom I have convers'd with.</P>
<P>When I perus'd a Pamphlet, containing some Remarks, &amp;c. on the above mention'd Tract, and observed the Author's <HI>circular way of Argumentation</HI>; I supposed (being immers'd in more sublime Studies) he might imagine himself on some <HI>lofty Topick in Me∣taphysicks,</HI> and so has at once been mistaken in his <HI>Theme,</HI> and his Notions of the <HI>true Interest</HI> of his Country: 'Tis well he owns himself liable to <HI>mistakes,</HI> for it requires no great Judgment or Penetration, to detect his Absurdities and Inconsistences; altho' he
<PB N="7" REF="002111_0008_0FBB839144EB8198"/>
boasts, (pag. 12) that he has <HI>made Things appear as plain and certain as a Mathemati∣cal Demonstration</HI>; and challenges <HI>any man to confute him</HI>; but (pag. 19.) he calls the same things, <HI>matters of doubtful Disputation</HI>: But his wonderful Projection, to force Men (by a fatal Necessity) to Industry, Frugality, and Good Husbandry, and so at once to ex∣tricate us out of our Difficulties, is, to have <HI>neither Money or Credit:</HI> (Sir, don't you think <HI>Longitude,</HI> and a <HI>Communication between us and the Moon,</HI> will be found out quickly, and be made as plain as a <HI>Demonstration!</HI>) Surely this Projection would soon extricate us out of this <HI>wretched Life,</HI> if the Govern∣ment should fall in with it, <HI>and I am great∣ly deceived, if we ever see good days again:</HI> But I would have our Projector make the Experiment, and try whether it is <HI>practicable</HI> to subsist any time without <HI>Money</HI> or <HI>Credit</HI>; and if he finds it is, then let him recommend his Project to the Government.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> (in pag. 2. and 9. of his tract) touches to the <HI>Quick</HI> an Order of Gentlemen (as if a man should thrust a Firebrand into a Nest of Hornets) who with shame (or ra∣ther in a shameless manner) Cry, GIVE YE: But it was not long before one of the fiercest of 'em, being rous'd up, (as a strong man af∣ter
<PB N="8" REF="002111_0009_0FBB83930CBABA60"/>
Wine) and having fill'd his Pandoras Box, and fitted himself for his Masters Ser∣vice, sits down, to blot with his detestable Scurrility, a Paper calld the <HI>Deadham Post∣script</HI>; in which posture, were it not just to paint him (something as I've seen K. <HI>J</HI>—) with the Father of Lyes at at his right hand to <HI>instigate</HI> and <HI>dictate,</HI> and an huge Bowl of exhillerating PUNCH at his left to <HI>intoxi∣cate.</HI></P>
<P>But (as one says) can any be so simple as to think, the Cause he seems to patronize can receive any Benefit by the <HI>Clamour and Railing</HI> of so mean and sordid a Wretch, whose Tongue, as we use to say, is no Slan∣der? Here he makes a mighty <HI>Stir</HI> (from his tender regards for the honour of Govern∣ment) and out of his <HI>high-flying Zeal,</HI> thun∣ders out Non-resistance &amp; Passive Obedience, that we <HI>speak not Evil of Dignities, and be subject to the higher Powers,</HI> in such haste, that he jumps over the 2d Chap. of the Epistle, in which there is an Apostolical Interrogation, which he would do well to consider and <HI>apply,</HI> for it is directly leveld as if designed for <HI>him,</HI> Verse 23. <HI>Thou that makest thy boast of the Law, thro' breaking the Law dishonourest thou God?</HI> But what has this man to do with the Gospel? Has he
<PB N="9" REF="002111_0010_0FBB83948A7BF1D8"/>
ever read Psal. 50.16, and onward? Or doth <HI>Paul</HI> give a toleration for men to <HI>be drunk,</HI> and in their merry Cups to <HI>thresh their wives,</HI> contrary to the Light and Law of Nature as well as the Gospel? Or is it <HI>Peter</HI>? No: Perhaps 'tis his pretended Successor at <HI>Rome</HI> gives the <HI>Indulgence,</HI> with promises of Pardon for all Sins, past, present, and to come.</P>
<P><HI>B. Gent.</HI> Sir, What you have said brings to my mind an insufferable Affront lately offer'd to the Town of <HI>Boston.</HI> On the 10<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> being the Day of our Election of Representatives, and the Pretenders Birth Day there came into the publick Town-Meeting, a certain Gentleman, (or rather mercenary R—l) and having placd him∣self on the Bench, and assum'd an uncommon Air of Impudence, he began <HI>imperiously to dictate to his superiors</HI>; and out of his su∣perabundant Loyalty to King GEORGE, and Love to the Protestant Succession, propos'd, <HI>That all the Inhabitants of the Town (tho' otherwise qualifi'd according to Law (should have the Oaths of Allegiance and Abjuration tender'd to them, before they might be a lowed to vote</HI>: And having asserted that there was a Law obliging thereunto (tho' he could not
<PB N="10" REF="002111_0011_0FBB839612B6AA28"/>
produce the same) he went on with his talk as pertinently as a Man may be suppos'd to do, if he should undertake to prove to a demonstration, that <HI>Lawyer and Liar are sy∣nonimous Terms</HI>; Till Mr. Moderator was forc'd to exert his Authority to still his un∣ruly Tongue: This extreamly exasperated the Town, to be challeng'd by such a d— D—, when perhaps there are not 400 more <HI>true,</HI> and <HI>loyal Subjects</HI> (with humble submission to <HI>Lancashire Jack)</HI> in the Kings Dominions; but 'tis generally suppos'd he came (<HI>as a Tool</HI>) to set the Town together by the Ears, and <HI>hinder</HI> the expected Choice.</P>
<P><HI>C. G.</HI> We are not ignorant in the Country of the confounded <HI>jugling Tricks</HI> that have been acted just before the their choice of Representatives in the several Towns, by sending <HI>Emissaries,</HI> and dispatching abun∣dance of <HI>Letters (with News from Robinson Cruso's Island)</HI> from <HI>Vill</HI> to <HI>Vill,</HI> to amuse the Country; insinuating that if things were carried on as they were the last Session, we must expect <HI>the same Fate,</HI> and that the Country will <HI>be ruin'd by the vast Expence and Damage of broken Conventions</HI>; much like the Cry of the High-flying Party in England, in QUEEN ANN's Time, <HI>the Church, the
<PB N="11" REF="002111_0012_0FBB83984533E0F0"/>
Church</HI> is in Danger! And there has not been wanting their utmost Efforts, nor any stone left unturned, to compass their Noble Designs, &amp; make things answer their Desire, tho' they have been drove to such Extremity in two Towns (as I am well Inform'd) to bring in two Gentlemen, <HI>(who ate by some accounted Pillars in the House)</HI> that their <HI>Evangelical Pastor</HI> in one, and an <HI>ungodly Aethropian</HI> in the other, were <HI>Voters</HI> to make a Majority▪ and how unprecedented each of these Instances are, I leave the world to Judge. Probably all this mighty stir has been made, to antedote the <HI>Dose of Hellebore</HI> Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> administred to the Country, (pag. 9. of his <HI>Distressed State)</HI> where he advises them to send publick spirited men, to repre∣sent them, not Sheriffs and Lawyers, who are the only men, who are benefitted by their Neighbours Straits, and fill their Cof∣fers out of the Ruins of their Estates; but <HI>si populus 'vult decipi, decipiatur.</HI></P>
<P><HI>B. G.</HI> It is too well known what sly Insinuations have been used by a Set of Rash men in Boston (before the coming together of the Convention, under the Hypocritical Disguise of contending for Perogatives) with the Country Gentlemen, to Induce 'em to fall into such Measures, as may endanger the Loss of a Charter, <HI>full of Singular Privilidges</HI> (which would be very grateful to several Gentlemen, whose Names I forbear to mention) and involve us in such miserable Circumstances, <HI>as a little valiant talk over a Bowl of Punch cannot extricate out of.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002111_0013_0FBB839A0BA06120"/><HI>C. G.</HI> I had not been half an hour in Town before I was saluted by a very corpulent Gentleman of the 'Change, who thrust into my hand a Pamphlet, which he told me was a <HI>Word in Season,</HI> and contained Mat∣ters of great Importance; and was very importunate with me, to give it a speedy Perusal: The Title of it was, <HI>News from Robinson Cruso's Island</HI>; and I soon found it contained sundry scandalous Reflections of the House of Representatives. That on purpose to show their spite to the G——n, they had put a publick Affront on him, and were guilty of the highest and most <HI>sordid Ingratitude</HI>; That they were <HI>Punch Bib∣bers,</HI> and <HI>Enemies of their Country,</HI> and bringing on it <HI>the last Degree of Slavery:</HI> And on the whole, I was far from being of our celebrated News-mongers mind, that it was proper <HI>to be communicated,</HI> and <HI>worth Peoples knowing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>B. G.</HI> Whoever was the Author of that scanda∣lous Pamphlet, 'tis generally and on good grounds sup∣posed to be one, whose <HI>Scribendi Cacoethes</HI> has made him famous on both sides the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> whose Brain is overcharged with so great a variety of News, that the Country feels themselves on many accounts the <HI>worse for him.</HI> The main Spring of his Learned Jar∣gon seems to be, to fright the Country out of their Privileges, lest while they lawfully use them, <HI>they spit in the Face of Government</HI>: And having run his Parallel to a very great Length, anon he begins to utter <HI>grievous Menaces,</HI> and to roar and bellow like the Popes Bull, that we have by a <HI>Train of bad Usages</HI> compelled a good Spirited Governour to such an in∣flexible Resolution, that <HI>he will make us know he is our Governour</HI>: But with submission to his <HI>Holiness,</HI> we <HI>do know</HI> he is our Governour, (and <HI>as such,</HI> wou'd have all due Regards paid him; But what then? Must we therefore <HI>tamely and quietly</HI> give up all
<PB N="13" REF="002111_0014_0FBB839D386BE8A0"/>
our <HI>Rights and Priviledges</HI>; and so render our selves obnoxious to the Curse of succeeding Generations?</P>
<P><HI>C. G.</HI> No verily: for if we tamely give up one Inch, we shall (according to the Proverb) find by sad Experience, we shall lose an Ell; and anon (like the Giants after the Flood) nothing will be restrained them of all that they have imagined; And who knows where their Designs and Desires will terminate.</P>
<P><HI>B. G.</HI> But the great Controversy of late, has been touching the <HI>Assemblies Right of chusing a Speaker</HI>; and <HI>the Governour's Power to Negative their Choice</HI>; which Matter has been set in a true Light by an honourable Gentleman, in his just and seasonable Vin∣dication, wherein he has fully made it appear, <HI>That the House of Representatives have an unquestionable, fun∣damental Right, to choose their Speaker; and that the Governour has no Negative Voice in that Election</HI>; and that the giving up of this Point, which is of so great Concern and Importance, would give a deadly wound to the Constitution: And altho' that Gentlemans Name has been greatly Canvas'd by a few, whose Endeavours have been used to cast an Odium upon it; (yet if it be a true Maxim that Interest will not lie) he is one who has approved himself a true Friend to his Country, a loyal Subject to King GEORGE. One who will never be guilty of <HI>listening to a few designing Men,</HI> nor be im∣posed upon by <HI>popular and plausible Insinuations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>C. G.</HI> The Choice of a Speaker is one of the valu∣able Priviledges this Province Enjoys, and of which, 'tis strange there should be any Endeavours to deprive them.</P>
<P>I hope this Assembly will intirely fall in with the Sen∣timents of the last, and that private differences, will no more have any influence on the Publick Affairs; (which is highly unreasonable, by how much the Publick Good, ought to be preferred to particular men's Interests) and in a word, may this Province ever
<PB N="14" REF="002111_0015_0FBB839E3807EEE0"/>
have an Assembly that will <HI>quit themselves like Men,</HI> in standing up for the <HI>just Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> of their Country: May we ever enjoy a <HI>just</HI> and <HI>wise</HI> Government, that will assert and maintain the <HI>Preroga∣tives</HI> of the Crown, and being extricated out of the Difficulties we labour under, may we again see <HI>happy and glorious Days,</HI> and the Council of all such as would strike at our Constitution be turned into foolishness; to which, every good man will say AMEN.</P>
<P>Before we part, Sir, I beg the Favour that you would read to me a certain Letter, which you told me formerly, you had by you.</P>
<P><HI>B. G.</HI> Sir, I shall the more readily grant your Re∣quest, because it has Relation to some things we have discours'd of: It is as follows, viz.</P>
