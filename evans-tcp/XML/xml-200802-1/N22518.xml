<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>RESPECTING the source from which the following Letters have been drawn, and the grounds on which the reader is expected to rest his belief of their authenticity, it may be sufficient to inform him, that permission was obtained from the proper authority, to tran∣scribe, from the original papers preserved in the Secretary of State's office in Philadelphia, these and sundry other authentic documents relating to the contest between the colonies and the mother country, viz. Letters from the Commanders of the continental forces, and other persons employed in the public service,—intercepted Letters from British Officers and other adherents to the royal cause,—Communications from the Gover∣nors, Conventions, and Committees, of the several American States,—Dispatches from Agents and Commissioners,—Instructions,—Reports of Committees of Congress,—parts of the secret Journals hitherto unpublished,—and various other pieces elucidative of the events which led to and finally established American Independence.</P>
<P>That permission was granted early in the year 1792, and immediate advantage was
<PB N="iv" REF="029737_0003_0FE2463D94F232A8"/>
taken of the indulgence; though, from va∣rious circumstances, of little consequence to the reader to know, the publication has been so long delayed. Even at this late period, the editor contents himself with laying be∣fore the public but a part of the collection,—intending, if these volumes meet with a fa∣vourable reception, to continue the publica∣tion, and present his readers with a variety of interesting pieces penned by the leaders and principal agents in the American Revolution, and tending to throw light on many import∣ant transactions that have hitherto been ei∣ther enveloped in total darkness, or, at best, but obscurely perceived, and imperfectly un∣derstood.</P>
<P>Some parts of these letters may perhaps appear too full of minutiae to interest that class of readers, who, unaccustomed to enter into the investigation of causes or conse∣quences, delight only in recitals of battles, sieges, and other striking occurrences which constitute the more prominent features of history. But, to the reasoning philosophic reader, who wishes to explore the secret springs of action,—to trace events to their remote and latent causes,—to discover and examine the subordinate and collateral cir∣cumstances (oft trifling in appearance, and generally overlooked by the vulgar eye) which, in the struggles of contending na∣tions give a preponderancy to the one or the other scale,—those minute details will, it
<PB N="v" REF="029737_0004_0FE2463F179F16B0"/>
is presumed, be far from unacceptable, as furnishing him with that species of informa∣tion, upon which alone he can venture to ground a decisive opinion, and which he might elsewhere seek in vain.</P>
<P>The inclosures, frequently referred to in these volumes, would still further contribute to set every circumstance in a clearer and stronger light; and it was the editor's origi∣nal intention that they should have accompa∣nied the letters to which they respectively belong. Obstacles however, <HI>at present</HI> insur∣mountable, stand in the way of their imme∣diate publication: but, when these are re∣moved, the papers alluded to shall make their appearance in form of an Appendix,—such parts of them at least, as are of a curious and interesting nature.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the reader will observe, that it was deemed as yet premature to publish cer∣tain passages of these letters: some omissions have of course taken place, which are every where pointed out by asterisks, and which will be supplied at a proper season, probably not far distant. On the other hand, in per∣haps half a dozen instances, a single word has been hazarded on conjecture, to fill up a chasm, where either the original or the copy happened to be torn or defaced; in which cases, the supplemental words are inclosed within crotchets and printed in Italic. A few entire letters, moreover, as appears by refer∣ence made to them in subsequent ones, are
<PB N="vi" REF="029737_0005_0FE24641B1B046A0"/>
here wanted to complete the chain of cor∣respondence. These the editor can give no account of, as the originals appear to have been lost from the files of office.</P>
<P>About a dozen letters, written by the gen∣eral's secretary,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. P. H. Harrison.</NOTE> are here inserted;—a few from the general himself to the board of war, or committee of Congress,—one to the pres∣ident of the New-York Convention, and one to R. Morris, Esquire, in the department of finance. These it was thought improper to omit: nor did it seem worth while, on ac∣count of a few exceptions, to make any al∣teration in the general title of the book.</P>

<P>THE rain on Friday afternoon and Saturday,—the ad∣vice of several gentlemen of the Jerseys and this city, by no means to cross Hudson's river at the lower ferry—and some other circumstances, too trivial to mention, pre∣vented my arrival at this place, until the afternoon of this day.</P>
<P>In the morning, after giving general Schuyler such or∣ders, as, from the result of my inquiry into matters here, appear necessary, I shall set out on my journey to the camp at Boston, and shall proceed with all the dispatch in my power. Powder is so essential an article, that I can∣not help again repeating the necessity of a supply. The camp at Boston, from the best account I can get from thence, is but very poorly supplied. At this place, they have scarce any. How they are provided at general Wooster's camp, I have not been able yet to learn.</P>
<P>Governor Tryon is arrived, and general Schuyler di∣rected to advise you of the line of conduct he moves in. I fear it will not be very favourable to the American cause.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that I am, with great respect and regard, gentlemen, your most obedient and obliged hum∣ble servant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPON my arrival here this afternoon, I was inform∣ed that an express's was in town, from the provincial camp in Massachusetts-Bay; and having seen, among the pa∣pers in his possession, a letter directed to you as President of the Congress, I have taken the liberty to open it. I was induced to take that liberty, by several gentlemen of New-York who were anxious to know the particulars of the affair of the seventeenth instant, and agreeable to the orders of many members of the Congress, who judged it necessary that I should avail myself of the best information in the course of my journey.</P>
<P>You will find, Sir, by that letter, a great want of pow∣der in the provincial army, which I sincerely hope the Congress will supply as speedily and as effectually as in their power. One thousand pounds in weight were sent to the camp at Cambridge, three days ago, from this city; which has left this place almost destitute of that necessary article; there being at this time, from the best informa∣tion, not more than four barrels of powder in the city of New-York.</P>
<P>I propose to set off for the provincial camp to-morrow, and will use all possible dispatch to join the forces there.</P>
<P>Please to make my compliments to the gentlemen of the Congress; and believe me to be, Sir, your obliged friend, and humble servant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED safe at this place on the third instant, after a journey attended with a good deal of fatigue, and retarded by necessary attentions to the successive civilities which accompanied me in my whole route.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029737_0008_0FE2464AEB01BC30"/>
Upon my arrival, I immediately visited the several posts occupied by our troops; and, as soon as the weather per∣mitted, reconnoitred those of the enemy. I found the lat∣ter strongly intrenched on Bunker's-hill, about a mile from Charlestown, and advanced about half a mile from the place of the late action, with their centries extended about one hundred and fifty yards on this side of the narrowest part of the neck leading from this place to Charlestown. Three floating batteries lie in Mystick river near their camp, and one twenty-gun ship below the ferry place between Boston and Charlestown. They have also a battery on Copse-hill, on the Boston side, which much annoyed our troops in the late attack. Upon the neck, they have also deeply in∣trenched and fortified. Their advanced guards, till last Saturday morning, occupied Brown's houses, about a mile from Roxbury meeting-house, and twenty roods from their lines: but, at that time, a party from general Thomas's camp surprised the guard, drove them in, and burned the houses. The bulk of their army, commanded by general Howe, lies on Bunker's-hill, and the remainder on Rox∣bury-neck, except the light horse, and a few men in the town of Boston.</P>
<P>On our side, we have thrown up intrenchments on Win∣ter and Prospect hills,—the enemy's camp in full view, at the distance of little more than a mile. Such intermediate points as would admit a landing, I have since my arrival taken care to strengthen, down to Sewal's Farm, where a strong intrenchment has been thrown up. At Roxbury, general Thomas has thrown up a strong work on the hill, about two hundred yards above the meeting-house; which, with the brokenness of the ground, and a great number of rocks, has made that pass very secure. The troops raised in New-Hampshire, with a regiment from Rhode-Island, occupy Winter-hill: a part of those from Connecticut, un∣der general Putnam, are on Prospect-hill. The troops in this town are entirely of the Massachusetts: the remainder of the Rhode-Island men are at Sewal's Farm. Two reg∣iments of Connecticut, and nine of the Massachusetts, are at Roxbury. The residue of the army, to the number of about seven hundred, are posted in several small towns along the coast, to prevent the depredations of the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="029737_0009_0FE2464D890EB1F0"/>
Upon the whole, I think myself authorised to say, that, considering the great extent of line and the nature of the ground, we are as well secured, as could be expected in so short a time, and under the disadvantages we labour. These consist in a want of engineers to construct proper works and direct the men, a want of tools, and a sufficient number of men to man the works in case of an attack. You will observe, by the proceedings of the council of war which I have the honour to inclose, that it is our unanimous opin∣ion, to hold and defend these works as long as possible. The discouragement it would give the men, and its con∣trary effects on the ministerial troops, thus to abandon our encampment in their face, formed with so much labour,—added to the certain destruction of a considerable and valu∣able extent of country, and our uncertainty of finding a place in all respects so capable of making a stand,—are leading reasons for this determination. At the same time we are very sensible of the difficulties which attend the defence of lines of so great extent, and the dangers which may ensue from such a division of the army.</P>
<P>My earnest wish to comply with the instructions of the Congress, in making an early and complete return of the state of the army, has led into an involuntary delay of ad∣dressing you; which has given me much concern. Hav∣ing given orders for this purpose immediately on my arriv∣al,—and unapprised of the imperfect obedience which had been paid to those of the like nature from general Ward, I was led from day to day to expect they would come in, and therefore detained the messenger. They are not now so complete as I could wish: but much allowance is to be made for inexperience in forms, and a liberty which had been taken (not given) on this subject. These rea∣sons I flatter myself, will no longer exist; and, of conse∣quence, more regularity and exactness will in future pre∣vail. This, with a necessary attention to the lines, the movements of the ministerial troops, and our immediate security, must be my apology, which I beg you to lay be∣fore Congress with the utmost duty and respect.</P>
<P>We labour under great disadvantages for want of tents: for, though they have been helped out by a collection of now useless sails from the sea-port towns, the number is far
<PB N="11" REF="029737_0010_0FE24653E9BB1B00"/>
short of our necessities. The colleges and houses of this town are necessarily occupied by the troops; which affords another reason for keeping our present situation. But I most sincerely wish the whole army was properly provided to take the field, as I am well assured, that (besides greater expedition and activity in case of alarm) it would highly conduce to health and discipline. As materials are not to be had here, I would beg leave to recommend the pro∣curing a farther supply from Philadelphia, as soon as possible.</P>
<P>I should be extremely deficient in gratitude as well as jus∣tice, if I did not take the first opportunity to acknowledge the readiness and attention, which the provincial Congress and different committees have shewn, to make every thing as convenient and agreeable as possible. But there is a vital and inherent principle of delay, incompatible with military service, in transacting business through such numerous and different channels. I esteem it therefore my duty to repre∣sent the inconvenience which must unavoidably ensue from a dependence on a number of persons for supplies; and sub∣mit it to the consideration of Congress, whether the pub∣lic service will not be best promoted by appointing a com∣missary-general for these purposes. We have a striking instance of the preference of such a mode, in the establish∣ment of Connecticut, as their troops are extremely well provided under the direction of Mr. Trumbull, and he has at different times assisted others with various articles. Should my sentiments happily coincide with those of your honours on this subject, I beg leave to recommend Mr. Trumbull as a very proper person for this department. In the arrangement of troops collected under such circum∣stances, and upon the spur of immediate necessity, several appointments are omitted, which appear to be indispensably necessary for the good government of the army—particu∣larly a quarter-master-general, a commissary of musters, and a commissary of artillery. These I must earnestly recom∣mend to the notice and provision of the Congress.</P>
<P>I find myself already much embarrassed, for want of a military chest. These embarrassments will increase every day: I must therefore request that money may be forward∣ed as soon as possible. The want of this most necessary arti∣cle will (I fear) produce great inconveniences, if not pre∣vented
<PB N="12" REF="029737_0011_0FE24656D3586C50"/>
by an early attention. I find the army in general, and the troops raised in Massachusetts in particular, very deficient in necessary clothing. Upon inquiry, there ap∣pears no probability of obtaining any supplies in this quar∣ter: and, on the best consideration of this matter I am able to form, I am of opinion that a number of hunting shirts (not less than ten thousand) would in a great degree re∣move this difficulty, in the cheapest and quickest manner. I know nothing, in a speculative view, more trivial, yet, if put in practice, would have a happier tendency to unite the men, and abolish those provincial distinctions which lead to jealousy and dissatisfaction.</P>
<P>In a former part of this letter, I mentioned the want of engineers. I can hardly express the disappointment I have experienced on this subject,—the skill of those we have being very imperfect, and confined to the mere man∣ual exercise of cannon; whereas the war in which we are engaged requires a knowledge, comprehending the duties of the field, and fortification. If any persons thus qual∣ified are to be found in the southern colonies, it would be of great public service to forward them with all expe∣dition.</P>
<P>Upon the article of ammunition, I must re-echo the former complaints on this subject. We are so exceeding∣ly destitute, that our artillery will be of little use, without a supply both large and seasonable. What we have must be reserved for the small arms, and that managed with the utmost frugality.* * *</P>
<P>The state of the army you will find ascertained with tolerable precision in the returns which accompany this letter. Upon finding the number of men to fall so far short of the establishment, and below all expectation, I imme∣diately called a council of the general officers, whose opinion (as to the mode of filling up the regiments, and providing for the present exigency) I have the honour of inclosing, together with the best judgment we are able to form of the ministerial troops. From the number of boys, deserters, and negroes, that have been enlisted in the troops of this province, I entertain some doubts wheth∣er the number required can be raised here: and all the gen∣eral officers agree that no dependence can be put on the
<PB N="13" REF="029737_0012_0FE246585766DC28"/>
militia, for a continuance in camp, or regularity and dis∣cipline during the short time they may stay. This unhap∣py and devoted province has been so long in a state of anarchy, and the yoke * * * * * been laid so heavily on it, that great allowances are to be made for troops raised under such circumstances. The deficiency of numbers, discipline, and stores, can only lead to this conclusion, that their spirit has exceeded their strength. But at the same time I would humbly submit to the consid∣eration of Congress the propriety of making some further provision of men from the other colonies. If these regi∣ments should be completed to their establishment, the dis∣mission of those unfit for duty on account of their age and character would occasion a considerable reduction; and, at all events, they have been enlisted upon such terms, that they may be disbanded when other troops arrive. But should my apprehensions be realized, and the regiments here be not filled up, the public cause would suffer by an ab∣solute dependence upon so doubtful an event, unless some provision is made against such a disappointment.</P>
<P>It requires no military skill, to judge of the difficulty of introducing proper discipline and subordination into an ar∣my while we have the enemy in view, and are in daily ex∣pectation of an attack: but it is of so much importance, that every effort will be made, which time and circum∣stances will admit. In the mean time I have a sincere pleasure in observing that there are materials for a good army—a great number of able-bodied men, active, zealous in the cause, and of unquestionable courage.</P>
<P>I am now, Sir, to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the twenty-eighth, inclosing the resolutions of Congress, of the twenty-seventh ultimo, and a copy of a letter from the committee of Albany; to all which I shall pay due attention.</P>
<P>Generals Gates and Sullivan have both arrived in good health.</P>
<P>My best abilities are at all times devoted to the service of my country: but I feel the weight, importance, and variety of my present duties too sensibly, not to wish a more immediate and frequent communication with the Congress. I fear it may often happen in the course of our
<PB N="14" REF="029737_0013_0FE24659DB70C7C0"/>
present operations, that I shall need that assistance and direction from them, which time and distance will not al∣low me to receive.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I have also to acknowledge your favour of the fourth instant by Fessenden, and the re∣ceipt of the commissions, and articles of war. The form∣er are yet eight hundred short of the number required. This deficiency you will please to supply as soon as you conveniently can. Among the other returns, I have also sent one of our killed, wounded, and missing, in the late action; but have been able to procure no certain account of the loss of the ministerial troops. My best intelligence fixes it at above five hundred killed, and six or seven hun∣dred wounded: but it is no more than conjecture,—the utmost pains being taken on their side to conceal it. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>P. S. Having ordered the commanding officer to give me the earliest intelligence of every motion of the enemy by land or water, discernible from the heights of his camp, I this instant, as I was closing my letter, received the in∣closed from the brigade major. The design of this ma∣noeuvre I know not:—perhaps it may be to make a de∣scent somewhere along the coast:—it may be for New-York; or it may be practised as a deception on us. I thought it not improper however to mention the matter to you: I have done the same to the commanding officer at New-York; and I shall let it be known to the committee of safety here, so that intelligence may be communicated, as they shall think best, along the sea-coast of this gov∣ernment.</P>

<P>SINCE I did myself the honour of addressing you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the tenth instant, nothing material has happened in the camp. From some authentic and late advices of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the ministerial troops, and the great inconvenience of calling in the militia in the midst of harvest, I have been induced for the present to wave it:—but in the mean time recruiting parties have been sent throughout this province,
<PB N="15" REF="029737_0014_0FE24664CE3901A8"/>
to fill up the regiments to the establishment of the provin∣cial Congress. At the same time that I received these ad∣vices, I also obtained a list of the officers of the enemy killed and wounded in the late battle at Charlestown, which I take this opportunity to inclose.</P>
<P>The great scarcity of fresh provisions in their army has led me to take every precaution to prevent a supply: for this purpose, I have ordered all the cattle and sheep to be drawn from the low grounds and farms within their reach. A detachment from general Thomas's camp, on Wednes∣day night, went over to Long-Island, and brought from thence twenty cattle and a number of sheep, with about fifteen labourers who had been put on by a Mr. Ray Thomas, to cut the hay, &amp;c. By some accident, they omitted burning the hay, and returned the next day at noon to complete it; which they effected, amidst the firing of the shipping, with the loss of one man killed and anoth∣er wounded.</P>
<P>Last evening also a party of the Connecticut-men stroll∣ed down on the marsh at Roxbury, and fired upon a cen∣try; which drew on a heavy fire from the enemy's lines and floating batteries, but attended with no other effect than the loss of one killed by a shot from the enemy's lines. In the mean time, we are, on both sides, contin∣uing our works: but there has been no other movement than what I have noticed above. I shall endeavour to give a regular and particular account of all transactions as they occur, which you will please to lay before the honourable Congress. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did myself the honour of addressing you the fourteenth instant, I have received advice from gov∣ernor Trumbull, that the assembly of Connecticut had vot∣ed, and that they are now raising, two regiments of seven hundred men each, in consequence of an application from the provincial Congress of Massachusetts-Bay. The Rhode-Island assembly has also made an augmentation for
<PB N="16" REF="029737_0015_0FE24666A5B06C18"/>
this purpose. These reinforcements, with the riflemen who are daily expected, and such recruits as may come in to fill up the regiments here, will, I apprehend, compose an army sufficiently strong to oppose any force which may be brought against us at present. I am very sensible that the heavy expense, necessarily attendant upon this cam∣paign, will call for the utmost frugality and care, and would therefore, if possible, avoid enlisting one unnecessary man. As this is the first certain account of the destina∣tion of these new-raised troops, I thought proper to com∣municate my sentiments as early as possible, lest the Con∣gress should act upon my letter of the tenth, and raise troops in the southern colonies, which, in my present judg∣ment, may be dispensed with.</P>
<P>For these eight days past, there have been no move∣ments in either camp, of any consequence. On our side, we have continued the works without any intermission; and they are now so far advanced as to leave us little to apprehend on that score. On the side of the enemy, they have also been very industrious in finishing their lines, both on Bunker's-hill and Roxbury-neck. In this inter∣val also, their transports have arrived from New-York; and they have been employed in landing and stationing their men. I have been able to collect no certain account of the numbers arrived: but the inclosed letter, wrote (though not signed) by Mr. Sheriff Lee, and delivered me by captain Darby, (who went express with an account of the Lexington battle) will enable us to form a pretty accurate judgment. The increase of tents and men in the town of Boston is very obvious; but all my accounts from thence agree that there is a great mortality, occasioned by the want of vegetables and fresh meat; and that their loss in the late battle at Charlestown (from the few recoveries of their wounded) is greater than at first supposed. The condition of the inhabitants detained in Boston is very dis∣tressing: they are equally destitute of the comfort of fresh provisions; and many of them are so reduced in their cir∣cumstances, as to be unable to supply themselves with salt. Such fish as the soldiery leave is their principal support. Added to all this, such suspicion and jealousy prevails, that
<PB N="17" REF="029737_0016_0FE2466829A8F290"/>
they can scarcely speak, or even look, without exposing themselves to some species of military execution.</P>
<P>I have not been able, from any intelligence I have re∣ceived, to form any certain judgment of the future opera∣tions of the enemy. Sometimes I have suspected an in∣tention of detaching a part of their army to some part of the coast, as they have been building a number of flat-bot∣tomed boats, capable of holding two hundred men each. But, from their works, and the language held at Boston, there is reason to think they expect the attack from us, and are principally engaged in preparing themselves against it. I have ordered all the whale-boats along the coast to be collected: and some of them are employed every night to watch the motions of the enemy by water, so as to guard as much as possible against any surprise. * * *</P>
<P>Next to the more immediate and pressing duties of put∣ting our lines in as secure a state as possible, attending to the movements of the enemy, and gaining intelligence,—my great concern is to establish order, regularity and dis∣cipline, without which our numbers would embarrass us, and, in case of action, general confusion must infallibly en∣sue. In order to this, I propose to divide the army into three divisions:—at the head of each will be a general officer:—these divisions to be again subdivided into brig∣ades, under their respective brigadiers. But the difficul∣ty arising from the arrangement of the general officers, and waiting the farther proceedings of the Congress on this subject, has much retarded my progress in this most necessary work. I should be very happy to receive their final commands, as any determination would enable me to proceed in my plan. * * *</P>
<P>In addition to the officers mentioned in mine of the tenth instant, I would humbly propose that some provision should be made for a judge-advocate, and provost-marshal. The necessity of the first appointment was so great, that I was obliged to nominate a Mr. Tudor, who was well recommended to me, and now executes the office under an expectation of receiving captain's pay—an allowance (in my opinion) scarcely adequate to the service, in new-raised troops, where there are court-martials every day. However, as that is the proportion in the regular army,
<PB N="18" REF="029737_0017_0FE24669AC62BB60"/>
and he is contented, there will be no necessity of an ad∣dition.</P>
<P>I must also renew my request as to money, and the ap∣pointment of a pay-master. I have forbore urging mat∣ters of this nature, from my knowledge of the many im∣portant concerns which engage the attention of the Con∣gress: but as I find my difficulties thicken every day, I make no doubt, suitable regard will be paid to a necessity of this kind. The inconvenience of borrowing such sums as are constantly requisite must be too plain for me to en∣large upon, and is a situation from which I should be very happy to be relieved.</P>
<P>Upon the experience I have had, and the best consid∣eration of the appointment of the several offices of com∣missary-general, muster-master-general, quarter-master-gen∣eral, pay-master-general, and commissary of artillery, I am clearly of opinion that they not only conduce to or∣der, dispatch and discipline, but that it is a measure of economy. The delay, the waste, and unpunishable neglect of duty, arising from these offices being in commission in several hands, evidently shew that the public expense must be finally enhanced. I have experienced the want of these officers, in completing the returns of men, ammunition, and stores. The latter are yet imperfect, from the number of hands in which they are dispersed. I have inclosed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> last weekly return, which is more accurate than the former; and hope in a little time we shall be perfectly regular in this as well as several other necessary branches of duty.</P>
<P>I have made inquiry into the establishment of the hos∣pital, and find it in a very unsettled condition. There is no principal director, nor any subordination among the sur∣geons: of consequence, disputes and contention have arisen, and must continue until it is reduced to some system. I could wish it was immediately taken into consideration, as the lives and health of both officers and men so much de∣pend upon a due regulation of this department. I have been particularly attentive to the least symptoms of the small pox; and hitherto we have been so fortunate as to have every person removed so soon, as not only to prevent any communication, but any alarm or apprehension it might
<PB N="19" REF="029737_0018_0FE24672A1AE6020"/>
give in the camp. We shall continue the utmost vigilance against this most dangerous enemy.</P>
<P>In an army properly organized, there are sundry offices of an inferior kind, such as waggon-master, master-carpen∣ter, &amp;c. but I doubt whether my powers are sufficiently extensive for such appointments. If it is thought prop∣er to repose such a trust in me, I shall be governed, in the discharge of it, by a strict regard to economy and the public interest.</P>
<P>My instructions from the honourable Congress direct that no troops are to be disbanded without their express direction, nor to be recruited to more than double the num∣ber of the enemy. Upon this subject I beg leave to rep∣resent, that, unless the regiments in this province are more successful in recruiting than I have reason to expect, a re∣duction of some of them will be highly necessary, as the public is put to the whole expense of an establishment of officers, while the real strength of the regiment (which consists in the rank and file) is defective. In case of such a reduction, doubtless some of the privates and all the officers would return home: but many of the former would go into the remaining regiments; and having had some ex∣perience, would fill them up with useful men. I so plainly perceive the expense of this campaign will exceed any cal∣culation hitherto made, that I am particularly anxious to strike off every unnecessary charge. You will therefore, Sir, be pleased to favour me with explicit directions from the Congress, on the mode of this reduction (if it shall ap∣pear necessary) that no time may be lost when such neces∣sity appears.</P>
<P>Yesterday we had an account that the light-house was on fire:—by whom, and under what orders, I have not yet learned: but we have reason to believe it has been done by our irregulars.</P>
<P>You will please to present me to the Congress, with the utmost duty and respect; and believe me to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>NOTHING material has occurred in either camp, since I had the honour of addressing you on the twenty-first instant by express: but on Tuesday, three men-of-war and nine transports sailed out of Boston harbour, and stood a course about E. S. E.</P>
<P>One Groves, who came out of Boston the same evening, informed the officer at one of the out-posts, that the trans∣ports had on board six hundred men, and were bound to Block-Island, Fisher's-Island, and Long-Island, to plunder them, and bring off what cattle they may find. The fellow returned again into Boston under such suspicious circum∣stances, that it has led me to doubt the truth of his intel∣ligence.</P>
<P>A deserter, who came in afterwards, informs me that it was given out in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amp, that they were either gone for Indians or fresh provisions; and that each transport had but twenty men on board. Upon this intelligence, I im∣mediately wrote to governor Cooke of Rhode-Island, and
<PB N="21" REF="029737_0020_0FE24675AE57C500"/>
to general Wooster, that they might take proper precau∣tions for removing the cattle off those islands and the coasts, and to prevent any surprise. As we are confirmed, by every account, in the scarcity of fresh provisions in the ene∣my's camp, and particularly by this deserter, it is very prob∣able this voyage may be only intended for a supply: but as it may possibly be otherwise, I thought it best to transmit the intelligence to the honourable Congress, that they may forward it to the southward, or take such other steps as they may judge proper.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, three more deserters have come out,—which makes four in twenty-four hours. Their ac∣counts correspond with those of the first who came out, and which I have related above. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the twenty-fourth July, accompanied by two hundred and eighty-four commissions, which are yet much short of the necessary number. I am much honoured by the confidence reposed in me, of appointing the several officers recom∣mended in mine of the tenth ultimo; and shall endeavour to select such persons as are best qualified to fill these import∣ant posts. * * * *</P>
<P>In the renewal of these commissions, some difficulties occur, in which I should be glad to know the pleasure of the honourable Congress. The general officers of the Massachusetts have regiments; those of Connecticut have both regiments and companies; and the other field officers have companies each. From Rhode-Island, the general officer has no regiment, but the field officers have com∣panies: but I do not find that they have or expect pay under more than one commission. Should the com∣missions, now to be delivered, pursue these different establishments, there will be a distinction between general and field officers of the same rank. In order to put New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode-Island, upon a line with Connecticut, it would be necessary to dismiss a num∣ber
<PB N="22" REF="029737_0021_0FE2467733837448"/>
of officers, in possession of commissions, without any fault of theirs. On the other hand, to bring the Connec∣ticut generals and field officers to the same scale with the others, will add to the number of officers, and may be deem∣ed inconsistent with the terms on which they entered into the service, although you add nothing to the expense, ex∣cept in the article of provisions. Upon the whole, it is a case which I would wish the honourable Congress to con∣sider and determine.</P>
<P>Colonel Gridley of this province, who is at the head of the artillery, has the rank of major-general from the pro∣vincial Congress. Will it be proper to renew his commis∣sion here in the same manner?—It is proper here to re∣mark, that, in this case, he will take rank of all the briga∣diers-general, and even the majors-general, whose commis∣sions are subsequent in date: and this can answer no good purpose, but may be productive of many bad consequences.</P>
<P>These are matters of some importance: but I am em∣barrassed with a difficulty of a superior kind. The esti∣mate, made in Congress, supposed all the regiments to be formed upon one establishment: but they are different in different provinces, and even vary in the same province, in some particulars. In Massachusetts, some regiments have ten companies, others eleven: the establishment of the former is five hundred and ninety men, officers included; of the latter, six hundred and forty-nine. The establish∣ment of Rhode-Island and New-Hampshire is five hundred and ninety to a regiment, officers included:—Connecticut has a thousand men to a regiment. Should the Massachu∣setts regiments be completed, with the new levies from Rhode-Island and Connecticut, and the riflemen, the num∣ber will exceed twenty-two thousand. If they should not be completed,—as each regiment is fully officered, there will be a heavy expense to the public, without an adequate service. The reduction of some of them seems to be nec∣essary, and yet is a matter of much delicacy, as we are situated. I most earnestly request it may be taken into immediate consideration, and the time and mode of doing it pointed out by the honourable Congress. By an esti∣mate I have made from the general return,—when the new levies arrive, and the regiments are completed, there will
<PB N="23" REF="029737_0022_0FE246806AD600E0"/>
be twenty-four thousand four hundred and fifty men on the pay and provision of the United Colonies. Some of the recruiting officers, who have been out on that service, have returned with very little success; so that we may safely con∣clude, the number of two thousand and sixty-four, now wanting to complete, will rather increase than diminish. There are the regiment of artillery, consisting of four hun∣dred and ninety-three men, and one under colonel Ser∣geant (who has not received any commission, although he had orders to raise a regiment, from the provincial Congress here) which are not included in the above estimate. This last regiment consists of two hundred and thirty-four men by the last return; but a company has since joined.</P>
<P>By adverting to the general return, which I have the honour of inclosing (N<SUP>o</SUP> 1) it will be seen what regiments are most deficient.</P>
<P>If the Congress does not choose to point out the particu∣lar regiments, but the provinces in which the reduction is to be made, the several Congresses and Assemblies may be the proper channel to conduct this business, which I would also conceive the most advisable, from their better acquaint∣ance with the merits, terms, and time of service, of the respective officers. Reducing some regiments, and, with the privates thereof, filling up others, would certainly be the best method of accomplishing this work if it were prac∣ticable: but the experiment is dangerous, as the Massachu∣setts-men, under the privilege of choosing their own offi∣cers, do not conceive themselves bound, if those officers are disbanded.</P>
<P>As general Gage is making preparations for winter by contracting for quantities of coal, it will suggest to us the propriety of extending our views to that season. I have directed that such huts as have been lately made of boards should be done in such a manner, that, if necessary, they may serve for covering during the winter. But I need not enlarge upon the variety of necessities, such as cloth∣ing, fuel, &amp;c. (both exceedingly scarce, and difficult to be procured) which that season must bring with it, if the ar∣my or any considerable part of it is to remain embodied.</P>
<P>From the inactivity of the enemy since the arrival of their whole reinforcement, their continual addition to their
<PB N="24" REF="029737_0023_0FE24682295AAB80"/>
lines,—and many other circumstances,—I am inclined to think, that, finding us so well prepared to receive them, the plan of operations is varied, and they mean, by regular approaches, to bombard us out of our present line of defence, or are waiting in expectation that the colonies must sink under the weight of the expense, or the prospect of a winter campaign so discourage our troops, as to break up our army. If they have not some such expectations, the issue of which they are determined to wait, I cannot account for the delay, when their strength is lessened every day by sickness, desertions, and little skirmishes.</P>
<P>Of these last we have had only two worthy of notice. Having some reason to suspect they were extending their lines at Charlestown, I, last Saturday evening, ordered some of the riflemen down, to make a discovery, or bring off a prisoner. They were accidentally discovered soon∣er than they expected, by the guard coming to relieve, and obliged to fire upon them. We have reason to believe they killed several. They brought in two prisoners, whose account (confirmed by some other circumstances) removed my suspicions in part. Since that time, we have, on each side, drawn in our c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntries, and there have been scatter∣ing fires along the line. This evening we have heard of three captains who have been taken off by the riflemen, and one killed by a cannon-shot from Roxbury, besides sev∣eral privates: but as the intelligence is not direct, I only mention it as a report which deserves credit▪ The other happened at the light-house. A number of workmen hav∣ing been sent down to repair it, with a guard of twenty-two marines and a subaltern,—major Tupper, last Monday morning about two o'clock, landed there with about three hundred men, attacked them, killed the officer and four privates; but being detained by the tide, in his return he was attacked by several boats; but he happily got through with the loss of one man killed, and another wounded. The remainder of the ministerial troops (three of whom are badly wounded) he brought off prisoners, with ten to∣ries, all of whom are on their way to Springfield jail. The riflemen, in these skirmishes, lost one man, who (we hear) is a prisoner in Boston jail. The enemy, in return, endeav∣oured to surprise our guard at Roxbury: but they, being
<PB N="25" REF="029737_0024_0FE24683AE7474C0"/>
apprised of it by a deserter, had time to prepare for it: but by some negligence or misconduct in the officer of the guard, they burned the George tavern on the neck; and have every day since been cannonading us from their lines, both at Roxbury and Charlestown, but with no other effect than the loss of two men. On our part, except straggling fires from the small arms about the lines, which we endeavour to restrain, we have made little or no return.</P>
<P>Our situation in the article of powder, is much more alarming than I had the most distant idea of. Having de∣sired a return to be made out (on my arrival) of the am∣munition, I found three hundred and three barrels and a half of powder mentioned as in the store: but on ordering a new supply of cartridges yesterday, I was informed, to my very great astonishment, that there was no more than thirty-six barrels of the Massachusetts store, which, with the stock of Rhode-Island, New-Hampshire, and Connec∣ticut, makes nine thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven pounds,—not more than nine rounds a man. As there had been no consumption of powder since, that could in any degree account for such a deficiency, I was very par∣ticular in my inquiries, and found that the committee of supplies, not being sufficiently acquainted with the nature of a return, or misapprehending my request, sent in an ac∣count of all the ammunition which had been collected by the province; so that the report included not only what was in hand, but what had been spent.</P>
<P>Upon discovering this mistake, I immediately went up to confer with the speaker of the house of representatives, upon some measures to obtain a supply from the neighbour∣ing townships, in such a manner as might prevent our pov∣erty being known; as it is a secret of too great conse∣quence to be divulged in the general court, some individu∣al of which might perhaps indiscreetly suffer it to escape him, so as to find its way to the enemy,—the consequences of which are terrible even in idea. I shall also write to the governors of Rhode-Island and Connecticut, and the com∣mittee of safety in New-Hampshire, on this subject, urging, in the most forcible terms, the necessity of an immediate supply, if in their power. I need not enlarge on our mel∣ancholy situation: it is sufficient that the existence of the
<PB N="26" REF="029737_0025_0FE2468533AA1300"/>
army and the salvation of the country depends upon some∣thing being done for our relief, both speedy and effectual▪ and that our situation be kept a profound secret.</P>
<P>In the inclosures, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2 and 3, I send the allowance of provisions, &amp;c. made by the provinces of Connecticut and Massachusetts. The mode and quantity are different from what has fallen within my experience, and, I am confident, must prove very wasteful and expensive. If any alteration can be safety made (which I much doubt) there might be a great saving to the public.</P>
<P>A gentleman of my family, assisted by a deserter who has some skill in fortification, has, by my direction, sketched out two draughts of our respective lines at Charlestown and Roxbury, which, with the explanations, will convey some idea of our situation, and, I hope, prove acceptable to the members of the honourable Congress. They are the in-closures, N<SUP>o</SUP> 4 and 5.</P>
<P>Since I had the honour of addressing you last, I have been applied to, by a committee of the general court, for a detachment of the army, to protect the inhabitants of the eastern parts of this province from some apprehended dep∣redations on their coasts. I could have wished to have complied with their request: but, after due consideration▪ and consulting the general officers, together with those members of Congress who are here, I thought it my duty to excuse myself. The application and my answer are the inclosures, N<SUP>o</SUP> 6 and 7, which I hope will be approved by the honourable Congress.</P>
<P>Since I began this letter, the original (of which the in∣closure N<SUP>o</SUP> 8 is a copy) fell into my hands. As the writer is a person of some note in Boston, and it contains some advices of importance not mentioned by others, I thought proper to forward it as I received it. By comparing the hand-writing with another letter, it appears the writer is one Belcher Noyes, a person probably known to some of the gentlemen, delegates from this province, who can de∣termine, from his principles and character, what credit is due to him.</P>
<P>The army is now formed into three grand divisions, under the command of the generals Ward, Lee, and Put∣nam; each division into two brigades, consisting of about
<PB N="27" REF="029737_0026_0FE2468EA32544C8"/>
six regiments each, commanded by generals Thomas and Spencer at Roxbury,—Heath at Cambridge,—Sullivan and Greene at Winter-hill. By this, you will please to observe, there is a deficiency of one brigadier-general (oc∣casioned by Mr. Pomroy's not acting under his com∣mission) which I beg may be filled up as soon as possible. I observe the honourable Congress have also favoured me with the appointment of three brigade-majors. I presume they have or intend to appoint the rest soon, as they cannot be unacquainted that one is necessary to each brigade; and in a new raised army, it will be an office of great duty and service.</P>
<P>General Gage has at length liberated the people of Bos∣ton, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in numbers at Chelsea every day. The terms on which the passes are granted, as to money, effects and provisions, correspond with Mr. Noyes's letter.</P>
<P>We have several reports that general Gage is disman∣tling Castle-William, and bringing all the cannon up to town: but, upon a very particular inquiry, accounts are so various, that I cannot ascertain the truth of it.* * *</P>
<P>On the first instant, a chief of the Caghnewaga tribe, who live about six miles from Montreal, came in here, accompained by a colonel Bayley of Cohoss. His accounts of the temper and disposition of the Indians are very fa∣vourable. He says they have been strongly solicited by governor Carleton to engage against us; but his nation is totally averse;—that threats, as well as entreaties, have been used without effect;—that the Canadians are well dis∣posed to the English colonies; and, if any expedition is meditated against Canada, the Indians in that quarter will give all their assistance. I have endeavoured to cherish these favourable dispositions, and have recommended to him to cultivate them on his return. What I have said, I en∣forced with a present, which I understood would be agreea∣ble to him: and as he is represented to be a man of weight and consequence in his own tribe, I flatter myself his visit will have a good effect. His accounts of general Carle∣ton's force and situation at St. John's correspond with what we have already had from that quarter.</P>
<P>The accession of Georgia to the measures of the Con∣gress is a happy event, and must give a sincere pleasure to every friend of America.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="029737_0027_0FE246906B549720"/>
<HI>August</HI> 5.—We have accounts this morning of two explosions at the Castle; so that its destruction may now be supposed certain.</P>
<P>I have this morning been alarmed with an information that two gentlemen from Philadelphia, (Mr. Hitchbourn and captain White) with letters for general Lee and my∣self, have been taken by captain Ayscough at Rhode-Island, the letters intercepted and sent forward to Boston,—with the bearers as prisoners; that the captain exulted much in the discoveries he had made: and my informer (who was also in the boat, but released) understood them to be letters of consequence. I have therefore dispatched the express immediately back, though I had before resolved to detain him till Fessenden's return. I shall be anxious till I am relieved from the suspense I am in, as to the contents of those letters.</P>
<P>It is exceedingly unfortunate that gentlemen should choose to travel the only road on which there is danger. Let the event of this be what it will, I hope it will serve as a general caution against trusting any letters that way in future.</P>
<P>Nothing of consequence has occurred in camp these two days. The inhabitants of Boston continue coming out at Chelsea, but under a new restriction, that no <HI>men</HI> shall come out without special license, which is refused to all mechanics, since the tory labourers were taken at the light∣house.

<P>THE inclosed letter came under such a direction and circumstances, as led me to suppose it contained some interesting advices, either respecting a supply of powder, or the clothing lately taken at Philadelphia; I therefore took the liberty of breaking the seal, for which I hope the ser∣vice and my motives will apologize.</P>

As the filling up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> place of vacant brigadier-general will probably be of the first business of the honourable Congress, I flatter myself it will not be deemed assuming, to mention the names of two gentlemen, whose former ser∣vices, rank and age, may be thought worthy of attention on this occasion. The former is colonel John Armstrong, of Pennsylvania: he served during the last war, in most of the campaigns to the southward; was honoured with the command of the Pennsylvania forces, and his general military conduct and spirit much approved by all who served with him: besides which, his character was distin∣guished by an enterprise against the Indians, which he planned with great judgment, and executed with equal courage and success. It was not till lately that I had rea∣son to believe he would enter again on public service; and it is now wholly unsolicited and unknown on his part. The other gentleman is colonel Fry, of Massachusetts-Bay. He entered into the service as early as 1745, and rose through the different military ranks, in the succeeding wars, to that of colonel, until last June, when he was ap∣pointed a major-general by the Congress of this province. From these circumstances, together with the favourable report made to me of him, I presume he sustained the character of a good officer, though I do not find it distin∣guished by any peculiar service.</P>
<P>Either of these gentlemen, or any other whom the hon∣ourable Congress shall please to favour with this appoint∣ment, will be received by me with the utmost deference and respect.</P>
<P>The late adjournment having made it impracticable to know the pleasure of the Congress as to the appointment of brigade-majors, beyond the number of three which they were pleased to leave to me,—and the service not admitting of farther delay,—I have continued the other three: which I hope their honours will not disapprove. These latter were recommended by the respective corps to which they belong, as the properest persons for these offices until farther direction, and have discharged the duty ever since. They are the majors Box, Scammel, and Samuel Brewer.</P>

Last Saturday night we took possession of a hill con∣siderably advanced beyond our former lines; which brought on a very heavy cannonade from Bunker's-hill, and after∣wards a bombardment, which has been since kept up with little spirit on their part, or damage on ours. The work having been continued ever since, is now so advanced, and the men so well covered, as to leave us under no appre∣hensions of much farther loss. In this affair, we had kill∣ed—one adjutant, one volunteer, and two privates. The scarcity of ammunition does not admit of our availing our∣selves of the situation, as we otherwise might do; but this evil, I hope, will soon be remedied, as I have been inform∣ed of the arrival of a large quantity at New-York, some at New-London, and more hourly expected at different places. I need not add to what I have already said on this subject. Our late supply was very seasonable, but far short of our necessities.</P>
<P>The late adjournment of the honourable Congress hav∣ing been made before my letter of the fourth instant was received, I must now beg leave to recall their attention to those parts of it which respect the provision for the winter, the reduction of the troops, the double commissions under different establishments, and colonel Gridley's appoint∣ment of major-general; in all which, I hope to be hon∣oured with their commands as soon as possible.</P>
<P>The advocate-general has sent me a memorial respect∣ing his service, which I have the honour to inclose; (N<SUP>o</SUP> 1) and from the variety and multiplicity of duty in a new army, as well as his regular service and attendance, I am induced to recommend him to the farther notice of the honourable Congress.</P>
<P>The treatment of our officers, prisoners at Boston, in∣duced me to write to general Gage on that subject.

<P>I DO myself the honour of addressing you in conse∣quence of an application from the commissary-general, who is, by my direction, taking all proper precautions on the approach of winter. I desired him to commit to writing such proposals as his experience and knowledge of the country might entitle him to make; which he has done in the paper which I have the honour to inclose. The difficul∣ty of procuring a sufficient quantity of salt, which I objected to him, he has fully obviated, by assuring me that there is so much now actually in store, in this and the neighbouring towns, as will remove all possibility of a disappointment.</P>

I propose to do myself the honour of writing, in a few days, fully and particularly on several heads, to which I must now refer. In the mean time, I have only to inform the honourable Congress, that I have received a small sup∣ply of seven thousand pounds of powder this week from Rhode-Island, and in a few days expect seven tons of lead, and five hundred stand of arms, a part of the same importation; and to request that more money may be for∣warded with all expedition, the military chest being nearly exhausted.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Camp at Cambridge,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 21, 1775.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been in daily expectation of being favoured with the commands of the honourable Congress, on the subject of my two last letters. The season now advances so fast that I cannot any longer defer laying before them such farther measures as require their immediate attention, and in which I wait their direction.</P>
<P>The mode in which the present army has been collected has occasioned some difficulty in procuring the subscription of both officers and soldiers to the continental articles of war. Their principal objection has been, that it might subject them to a longer service than that for which they engaged under their several provincial establishments. It is in vain to attempt to reason away the prejudices of a whole army: * * * I have therefore forbore pressing them, as I did not experience any such inconvenience from their adherence to their former rules, as would warrant the risk of entering into a contest upon it: more especially as the restraints, necessary for the establishment of essential disci∣pline and subordination, indisposed their minds to every change, and made it both duty and policy to introduce as little novelty as possible. With the present army, I fear such a subscription is impracticable: but the difficulty will cease with this army.</P>
<P>The Connecticut and Rhode-Island troops stand engag∣ed to the first of December only; and none longer than the first of January. A dissolution of the present army
<PB N="33" REF="029737_0032_0FE2469F602AD148"/>
therefore will take place, unless some early provision is made against such an event. Most of the general officers are of opinion the greater part of them may be re-enlisted for the winter, or another campaign, with the indulgence of a furlough to visit their friends, which may be regulated so as not to endanger the service. How far it may be proper to form the new army entirely out of the old, for another campaign, rather than from the contingents of the several provinces, is a question which involves in it too ma∣ny considerations of policy and prudence, for me to under∣take to decide. It appears to be impossible to draw it from any other source than the old army, for this winter; and, as the pay is ample, I hope a sufficient number will engage in the service for that time at least. But there are various opinions of the temper of the men on the subject; and there may be great hazard in deferring the trial so long.</P>
<P>In the continental establishment, no provision has been made for the pay of artificers, distinct from that of the common soldiers; whereas, under the provincial, such as found their own tools were allowed one shilling per diem advance, and particular artizans, more. The pay of the artillery also now differs from that of the province; the men have less, the officers more; and, for some ranks, no pro∣vision is made, as the Congress will please to observe by the list which I have the honour to inclose. (N<SUP>o</SUP> 1.) These par∣ticulars, though seemingly inconsiderable, are the source of much complaint and dissatisfaction, which I endeavour to compose in the best manner I am able.</P>
<P>By the returns of the rifle companies, and that battalion, they appear to exceed their establishment very considerably. I doubt my authority to pay these extra men without the direction of the Congress: but it would be deemed a great hardship wholly to refuse them, as they have been en∣couraged to come.</P>
<P>The necessities of the troops having required pay, I di∣rected that those of the Massachusetts should receive for one month, upon their being mustered, and returning a proper roll: but a claim was immediately made for pay by lunar months; and several regiments have declined taking up their warrants on this account. As this practice was en∣tirely new to me, though said to be warranted by former
<PB N="34" REF="029737_0033_0FE246A0E4383398"/>
usage, here the matter now waits the determination of the honourable Congress. I find, in Connecticut and Rhode-Island, this point was settled by calendar months: in Mas∣sachusetts, though mentioned in the Congress, it was left undetermined; which is also the case of New-Hampshire.</P>
<P>The inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2, is a petition from the subalterns, respecting their pay. Where there are only two of these in a company, I have considered one as an ensign, and or∣dered him pay as such, as in the Connecticut forces. I must beg leave to recommend this petition to the favour of the Congress; as I am of opinion the allowance is inadequate to their rank and service, and is one great source of that familiarity between the officers and men, which is so incom∣patible with subordination and discipline. Many valuable officers of those ranks, finding themselves unable to support the character and appearance of officers, (I am informed) will retire as soon as the term of service is expired, if there is no alteration.</P>
<P>For the better regulation of duty, I found it necessary to settle the rank of the officers, and to number the regiments; and, as I had not received the commands of the Congress on the subject, and the exigence of the service forbade any farther delay, the general officers were considered as having no regiments; an alteration, which, I understand, is not pleasing to some of them, but appeared to me and others to be proper, when it was considered, that, by this means, the whole army is put upon one footing, and all particular at∣tachments dissolved.</P>
<P>Among many other considerations which the approach of winter will demand, that of clothing appears to be one of the most important. So far as regards the preservation of the army from cold, they may be deemed in a state of nakedness. Many of the men have been without blankets the whole campaign: and those, which have been in use during the summer, are so much worn as to be of little service. In order to make a suitable provision in these arti∣cles, and at the same to guard the public against imposition and expense, it seems necessary to determine the mode of continuing the army: for, should these troops be clothed under their present engagement, and, at the expiration of
<PB N="35" REF="029737_0034_0FE246AAE9D91AB0"/>
the term of service, decline renewing it, a set of unprovid∣ed men may be sent to supply their places.</P>
<P>I cannot suppose it▪ to be unknown to the honourable Congress, that, in all armies, it is an established practice to make an allowance to officers, of provisions and forage, pro∣portionate to their rank. As such an allowance formed no part of the continental establishment, I have hitherto forbore to issue the orders for that purpose: but, as it is a received opinion of such members of the Congress as I have had an opportunity of consulting, as well as throughout <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> army, that it must be deemed a matter of course and im∣plied in the establishment of the army, I have directed the following proportion of rations, being the same allowed in the American armies last war:—Major-general, fifteen; brigadier-general, twelve; colonel, six; lieutenant-colonel, five; major, four; captain, three; subaltern, two; staff, two.</P>
<P>If these should not be approved by the honourable Con∣gress, they will please to signify their pleasure, as to the alterations they would have made in the whole or in part.</P>
<P>I am now to inform the honourable Congress, that, en∣couraged by the repeated declarations of the Canadians and Indians, and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged by their requests, I have detached col∣onel Arnold with a thousand men, to penetrate into Cana∣da by way of Kennebeck river, and, if possible, to make him∣self master of Quebec. By this manoeuvre, I proposed ei∣ther to divert Carleton from St. John's, which would leave a free passage to general Schuyler;—or, if this did not take effect, Quebec, in its present defenceless state, must fall into his hands an easy prey. I made all possible inquiry, as to the distance, the safety of the route, and the danger of the season being too far advanced; but found nothing in either, to deter me from proceeding, more especially as it met with very general approbation from all whom I consulted upon it. But, that nothing might be omitted, to enable me to judge of its propriety and probable consequences, I communicated it by express to general Schuyler, who approved of it in such terms, that I resolved to put it in immediate execu∣tion. They have now left this place seven days: and, if favoured with a good wind, I hope soon to hear of their being safe in Kennebeck river. For the satisfaction of the
<PB N="36" REF="029737_0035_0FE246AC6E74F5A8"/>
Congress, I here inclose a copy of the proposed route. (N<SUP>o</SUP> 3.) I also do myself the honour of inclosing a mani∣festo, which I caused to be printed here, and of which col∣onel Arnold has taken a suitable number with him. This is the inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 4. I have also forwarded a copy of his instructions (N<SUP>o</SUP> 5)—from all which I hope the Con∣gress will have a clear view of the motives, plan, and in∣tended execution of this enterprise, and that I shall be so happy as to meet with their approbation in it.</P>
<P>I was the more induced to make this detachment, as it is my clear opinion, from a careful observation of the move∣ments of the enemy, corroborated by all the intelligence we receive by deserters and others, (of the former of whom we have some every day) that the enemy have no intention to come out, until they are reinforced. They have been wholly employed for some time past in procuring materials for barracks, fuel, and making other preparations for winter. These circumstances, with the constant additions to their works which are apparently defensive, have led to the above conclusion, and enabled me to spare this body of men where I hope they will be usefully and successfully employed.</P>
<P>The state of inactivity, in which this army has lain for some time, by no means corresponds with my wishes, by some decisive stroke to relieve my country from the heavy expense its subsistence must create. After frequently rec∣onnoitring the situation of the enemy in the town of Bos∣ton, collecting all possible intelligence, and digesting the whole, a surprise did not appear to me wholly impracticable, though hazardous. I communicated it to the general offi∣cers some days before I called them to a council, that they might be prepared with their opinions. The result I have the honour of inclosing. (N<SUP>o</SUP> 6.) I cannot say that I have wholly laid it aside: but new events may occasion new measures. Of this I hope the honourable Congress can need no assurance, that there is not a man in America who more earnestly wishes such a termination of the campaign, as to make the army no longer necessary.</P>
<P>The season advances so fast, that I have given orders to prepare barracks and other accommodations for the winter. The great scarcity of tow-cloth in this country, I fear, will totally disappoint as in our expectations of procuring hunt∣ing-shirts.
<PB N="37" REF="029737_0036_0FE246ADF4A55350"/>
Governor Cooke informs me, few or none are to be had in Rhode-Island; and governor Trumbull gives me little encouragement to expect many from Connecticut.</P>
<P>I have filled up the office of quarter-master-general, which the Congress was pleased to leave to me, by the appoint∣ment of major Mifflin, which I hope and believe will be universally acceptable.</P>
<P>It gives me great pain to be obliged to solicit the atten∣tion of the honourable Congress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the state of this army, in terms which imply the slightest apprehension of being neg∣lected. But my situation is inexpressibly distressing, to see the winter fast approaching upon a naked army; the time of their service within a few weeks of expiring; and no pro∣vision yet made for such important events. Added to these, the military chest is totally exhausted: the pay-mas∣ter has not a single dollar in hand: the commissary-general assures me he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trained his credit, for the subsistence of the army, to the utmost. The quarter-master-general is precisely in the same situation; and the greater part of the troops are in a state not far from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>utiny, upon the deduction from their stated allowance. I know not to whom I am to impute this failure: but I am of opinion, if the evil is not immediately remedied, and more punctuality observed in future, the army must absolutely break up. I hoped I had so fully expressed myself on this subject, (both by letter, and to those members of the Congress who honoured the camp with a visit) that no disappointment could possibly happen: I therefore hourly expected advice from the pay∣master that he had received a fresh supply, in addition to the hundred and seventy-two thousand dollars delivered him in August: and thought myself warranted to assure the public creditors that in a few days they should be satisfied. But the delay has brought matters to such a crisis, as ad∣mits of no farther uncertain expectation. I have therefore sent off this express, with orders to make all possible dis∣patch. It is my most earnest request that he may be re∣turned with all possible expedition, unless the honourable Congress have already forwarded what is so indispensably necessary.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE reverend Mr. Kirkland, the bearer of this, having been introduced to the honourable Congress, can need no particular recommendation from me. But as he now wishes to have the affairs of his mission and public employ put upon some suitable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooting, I cannot but intimate my sense of the importance of his station, and the great advan∣tages which have and may result to the United Colonies, from his situation being made respectable.</P>
<P>All accounts agree that much of the favourable disposition shewn by the Indians, may be ascribed to his labour and in∣fluence. He has accompanied a chief of the Oneidas to this camp, which I have endeavoured to make agreeable to him, both by civility and some small presents. Mr. Kirk∣land being also in some necessity for money to bear his trav∣elling charges and other expenses, I have supplied him with thirty-two pounds lawful money.</P>
<P>I cannot but congratulate the honourable Congress on the happy temper of the Canadians and Indians, our accounts of which are now fully confirmed by some intercepted let∣ters from officers in Canada, to general Gage and others in Boston, which were found on board the vessel lately taken, going into Boston with a donation of cattle and other fresh provisions for the ministerial army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured with your favour of the twenty∣sixth ultimo, late the night before last; and a meeting of the general officers having been called upon a business which will make a considerable part of this letter. I took the op∣portunity of laying before them those parts of yours which respect the continuance and new-modelling of the army, the fuel, clothing, and other preparations for the ensuing winter. They have taken two or three days to consider; and, as soon as I am possessed of their opinions, I shall lose no time in transmitting the result, not only on the above sub∣jects, but the number of troops necessary to be kept up.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="029737_0038_0FE246B9007F8488"/>
I have also directed the commissary-general and the quar∣ter-master-general to prepare estimates of the expense of their departments for a certain given number of men, from which a judgment may be made, when the number of men to be kept in pay is determined:—all which I shall do my∣self the honour to lay before the Congress, as soon as they are ready.</P>
<P>I have now a painful though a necessary duty to perform, respecting Dr. Church, director-general of the hospital. About a week ago, Mr. secretary Ward, of Providence, sent up to me one Wainwood, an inhabitant of Newport, with a letter directed to major Cane, in Boston, in <HI>[occult]</HI> char∣acters, which he said had been left with Wainwood some time ago, by a woman who was kept by Dr. Church. She had before pressed Wainwood to take her to captain Wal∣lace, Mr. Dudley the collector, or George Rome; which he declined. She then gave him the letter, with a strict charge to deliver it to either of those gentlemen. He, sus∣pecting some improper correspondence, kept the letter, and after some time opened it; but, not being able to read it, laid it up, where it remained until he received an obscure letter from the woman, expressing an anxiety after the origi∣nal letter. He then communicated the whole matter to Mr. Ward, who sent him up with the papers to me. I im∣mediately secured the woman: but for a long time she was proof against every threat and persuasion to discover the au∣thor. However, at length she was brought to a confession, and named Dr. Church. I then immediately secured him and all his papers. Upon his first examination, he readily acknowledged the letter, said it was designed for his brother Fleming, and, when deciphered, would be found to contain nothing criminal. He acknowledged his never having com∣municated the correspondence to any person here but the girl, and made many protestations of the purity of his inten∣tions. Having found a person capable of deciphering the letter, I in the mean time had all his papers searched, but found nothing criminal among them: but it appeared on in∣quiry, that a confidant had been among the papers before my messenger arrived. I then called the general officers together for their advice, the result of which you will find in the inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 1. The deciphered letter is the inclo∣sure,
<PB N="40" REF="029737_0039_0FE246BAEC4ACE60"/>
N<SUP>o</SUP> 2. The army and country are exceedingly irri∣tated: and upon a free discussion of the nature, circum∣stances, and consequence of this matter, it has been unani∣mously agreed to lay it before the honourable Congress for their special advice and direction; at the same time sug∣gesting to their consideration, whether an alteration of the twenty-eighth article of war may not be necessary.</P>
<P>As I shall reserve all farther remarks upon the state of the army till my next, I shall now beg leave to request the determination of Congress, as to the property and disposal of such vessels and cargoes as are designed for the supply of the enemy, and may fall into our hands. There has been an event of this kind at Portsmouth, (as by the inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 3) in which I have directed the cargo to be brought hither for the use of the army, reserving the settlement of any claims of capture to the decision of Congress.</P>
<P>As there are many unfortunate individuals whose prop∣erty has been confiscated by the enemy, I would humbly suggest to the consideration of Congress the humanity of ap∣plying, in part or in the whole, such captures to the relief of those sufferers, after compensating any expense of the cap∣tors, and for their activity and spirit. I am the more indue∣ed to request this determination may be speedy, as I have directed three vessels to be equipped in order to cut off the supplies; and, from the number of vessels hourly arriving, it may become an object of some importance. In the dispo∣sal of these captures, for the encouragement of the officers and men, I have allowed them one third of the cargoes, ex∣cept military stores, which, with the vessels, are to be re∣served for the public use. I hope my plan, as well as the execution, will be favoured with the approbation of Con∣gress.</P>
<P>One Mr. Fisk, an intelligent person, came out of Boston on the third inst. and gives us the following advices:—that a fleet, consisting of a sixty-four, and twenty-gun ship, two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loops of eighteen guns, and two transports with six hun∣dred men, were to sail from Boston as yesterday; that they took on board two mortars, four howitzers, and other artil∣lery calculated for the bombardment of a town:—their des∣tination was kept a profound secret:—that an express sloop of war, which left England the eighth of August, arrived
<PB N="41" REF="029737_0040_0FE246BC7111EB90"/>
four days ago;—that general Gage is recalled, and last Sun∣day resigned his command to general Howe;—that lord Percy, colonel Smith, and other officers who were at Lex∣ington, are ordered home with Gage;—that six ships of the line and two cutters were coming out under Sir Peter Dennis;—that five regiments and a thousand marines are ordered out, and may be expected in three or four weeks:—no prospect of accommodation; but the ministry deter∣mined to push the war to the utmost.</P>
<P>I have an express from colonel Arnold, and herewith send a copy of his letter and an inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 4 and 5.—I am happy in finding he meets with no discouragement. The claim of the rifle officers, to be independent of all the superior officers except colonel Arnold, is without any countenance or authority from me, as I have signified in my last dispatch both to colonel Arnold and captain Mor∣gan. The captain of the brig from Quebec for Boston in∣forms me that there is no suspicion of any such expedition; and that, if Carleton is not drove from St. John's, so as to be obliged to throw himself into Quebec, it must fall into our hands, as it is left without a regular soldier, and many of the inhabitants are most favourably disposed to the American cause;—and that there is the largest stock of ammunition ever collected in America.</P>
<P>In the above vessel some letters were also found, from an officer at Quebec, to general Gage and major Sheriff at Boston, containing such an account of the temper of the Canadians, as cannot but afford the highest satisfaction. I have thought it best to forward them: they are the inclo∣sures, N<SUP>o</SUP> 6 and 7.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your several favours of the twenty-sixth and thirtieth of September, and fifth of Octo∣ber, the contents of which I shall beg leave to notice in their respective order.</P>
<P>Previous to the direction of Congress to consult the gen∣eral officers on the best mode of continuing and providing
<PB N="42" REF="029737_0041_0FE246BDF4FDD390"/>
for the army during the winter, I had desired them to tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their thoughts upon these subjects, and to favour me with the result, by a particular day, in writing. In this interval, the appointment of Dr. Franklin, Mr. Lynch, and colonel Harrison, was communicated,—an event which has given me the highest satisfaction, as the subject was too weighty and complex for a discussion by letter. This appointment made any conclusion here unnecessary, as it is not probable any such arrangement would be agreed on, as would not be altered in some respects, upon a full and free conference. This good effect will arise from the step already taken, that every officer will be prepared to give his sentiments upon these important subjects.</P>
<P>The estimates of the commissary and quarter-master∣general I have now the honour of inclosing. The first is N<SUP>o</SUP> 1, the other N<SUP>o</SUP> 2.</P>
<P>With respect to the reduction of the pay of the men, which may enter into the consideration of their support, it is the unanimous opinion of the general officers, that it cannot be touched with safety at present. * * *</P>
<P>Upon the presumption of there being a vacancy in the direction of the hospital, lieutenant-colonel Hand, former∣ly a surgeon in the eighteenth regiment, or royal Irish, and Dr. Foster, late of Charlestown, and one of the surgeons of the hospital under Dr. Church, are candidates for that office. I do not pretend to be acquainted with their re∣spective merits, and therefore have given them no farther expectation, than that they should be mentioned as candi∣dates for the department. I therefore need only to add upon this subject, that the affairs of the hospital require that the appointment should be made as soon as possible.</P>
<P>Before I was honoured with your favour of the fifth in∣stant, I had given orders for the equipment of some armed vessels, to intercept the enemy's supplies of provisions and ammunition. One of them was on a cruise between Cape Anne and Cape Cod, when the express arrived. The others will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for the sea in a few days, under the com∣mand of officers of the continental army, who are well rec∣ommended, as persons acquainted with the sea, and capa∣ble of such a service. Two of these will be immediately
<PB N="43" REF="029737_0042_0FE246C6A374D3F8"/>
dispatched on this duty, and every particular, mentioned in your favour of the fifth instant, literally complied with.</P>
<P>That the honourable Congress may have a more com∣plete idea of the plan on which these vessels are equipped; I inclose a copy of the instructions given to the captains now out (N<SUP>o</SUP> 4). These, with the additional instruction directed, will be given to the captains who go into the mouth of St. Laurence's river. As both officers and men most cheerfully engage in the service on the terms men∣tioned in these instructions, I fear that the proposed in∣crease will create some difficulty, by making a difference between men engaged on similar service. I have therefore not yet communicated this part of the plan, but reserved an extra bounty as a reward for extraordinary activity. There are no armed vessels in this province; and governor Cooke informs me the enterprise can receive no assistance from him, as one of the armed vessels of Rhode-Island is on a long cruise, and the other unfit for the service. Nothing shall be omitted to secure success. A fortunate capture of an ordnance ship would give new life to the camp, and an immediate turn to the issue of this campaign.</P>
<P>Our last accouts from colonel Arnold are very favoura∣ble: he was proceeding with all expedition; and I flatter myself (making all allowances) he will be at Quebec the twentieth instant, where a gentleman from Canada (Mr. * * *) assures me he will meet with no resistance.</P>
<P>In the quarter-master's estimate, there are some arti∣cles omitted, of which he informs me he cannot pretend to furnish a computation,—such as cartage, tools, &amp;c. for which some general allowance must be made.</P>
<P>From the various accounts received from Europe, there may be reason to expect troops will be landed at New-York, or some other middle colony. I should be glad to know the pleasure of the Congress, whether, upon such an event, it would be expected that a part of this army should be detached, or the internal force of such colony and its neighbourhood be deemed sufficient; or whether, in such case, I am to wait the particular direction of Congress.</P>
<P>The fleet, mentioned in my last, has been seen standing N. N. E.; so that we apprehend it is intended for some
<PB N="44" REF="029737_0043_0FE246C875D60350"/>
part of this province, or New-Hampshire, or possibly Que∣bec.</P>
<P>The latest and best accounts we have from the enemy are, that they are engaged in their new work across the south end of Boston, preparing their barracks, &amp;c. for win∣ter:—that it is proposed to keep from five hundred to a thousand men on Bunker's hill all winter, who are to be relieved once a week;—the rest to be drawn into Boston.</P>
<P>A person who has lately been a servant to major Conolly (a tool of lord Dunmore's) has given an account of a scheme to distress the southern provinces, which ap∣peared to me of sufficient consequence to be immediately transmitted. I have therefore got it attested, and do my∣self the honour of inclosing it, N<SUP>o</SUP> 5.</P>
<P>The new levies from Connecticut have lately marched into camp, and are a body of as good troops as any we have: so that we have now the same strength as before the detachment made under colonel Arnold.</P>
<P>I am, with the most respectful sentiments to the honoura∣ble Congress, and yourself, Sir, your most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY conjecture of the destination of the late squadron from Boston, in my last, has been unhappily verified by an outrage, exceeding, in barbarity and cruelty, every hostile act practised among civilized nations. I have inclosed the account given me by Mr. Jones, a gentleman of the town of Falmouth, of the destruction of that increasing and flour∣ishing village. He is a very great sufferer, and informs me that the time allowed for the removal of effects was so small, that valuable property of all kinds, and to a great amount, has been destroyed. The orders shewn by the captain for this horrid procedure (by which it appears the same deso∣lation is meditated upon all the towns on the coast) made it my duty to communicate it as quickly and extensively as possible. As Portsmouth was the next place to which he proposed to go, general Sullivan was permitted to go up, and give them his assistance and advice to ward off the blow. I flatter myself the like event will not happen
<PB N="45" REF="029737_0044_0FE246CA009EA930"/>
there, as they have a fortification of some strength, and a vessel has arrived at a place called Sheepscot, with fif∣teen hundred pounds of powder.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the Congress have nearly finished their business: but as they write by this opportunity, I must beg leave to refer you to their letter, for what concerns their commission.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE information, which the gentlemen who have lately gone from hence can give the Congress, of the state and situation of the army, would have made a letter unneces∣sary, if I did not suppose there would be some anxiety to know the intentions of the army on the subject of the re∣enlistment.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the advice of those gentlemen, and my own opinion, I immediately began by directing all such officers as proposed to continue, to signify their intentions as soon as possible. A great number of the returns are come in, from which I find that a very great proportion of the officers of the rank of captains, and under, will retire;—from present appearances, I may say, half,—but at least, one third. It is with some concern also that I observe, that many of the officers who retire discourage the continuance of the men, and, I fear, will communicate the infection to them. Some have advised, that those of∣ficers who decline the service should be immediately dis∣missed: but this would be very dangerous and inconve∣nient. I confess I have great anxieties upon the subject, though I still hope the pay and terms are so advantageous, that interest, and, I hope also, a regard to their country, will retain a greater proportion of the privates than their officers. In so important a matter, I shall esteem it my indispensable duty, not only to act with all possible pru∣dence,
<PB N="46" REF="029737_0045_0FE246CC8DE88C00"/>
but to give the most early and constant advice of my progress.</P>
<P>A supply of clothing, equal to our necessities, would greatly contribute to the encouragement and satisfaction of the men. In every point of view, it is so important, that I beg leave to call the attention of the Congress to it in a particular manner.</P>

<P>I COULD not suffer Mr. Randolph to quit this camp without bearing some testimony of my duty to the Congress; although his sudden departure (occasioned by the death of his worthy relative, whose loss, as a good citizen and valuable member of society, is much to be re∣gretted) does not allow me time to be particular.</P>
<P>The inclosed return shews, at one view, what reliance we have upon the officers of this army, and how deficient we are like to be in subaltern officers. A few days more will enable me to inform the Congress what they have to expect from the soldiery, as I shall issue recruiting orders for this purpose so soon as the officers are appointed,—which will be done this day,—having sent for the general officers, to consult them in the choice.</P>
<P>I must beg leave to recall the attention of the Congress to the appointment of a brigadier-general,—an officer as necessary to a brigade as a colonel is to a regiment, and will be exceedingly wanted in the new arrangement.</P>
<P>The proclamations and association, herewith inclosed, came to my hands on Monday last. I thought it my duty to send them to you. Nothing of moment has happened since my last.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE immediate occasion of my giving the Congress the trouble of a letter at this time is to inform them, that, in consequence of their order signified in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, I laid myself under a solemn tie of secre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to captain M<SUP>c</SUP>Pherson, and proceeded to examine his plan for the destruction of the fleet in the harbour of Bos∣ton, with all that care and attention which the importance of it deserved, and my judgment could lead to. But not be∣ing happy enough to coincide in opinion with that gentleman, and finding that his scheme would involve greater expense, than (under my doubts of its success) I thought myself justi∣fied in giving into, I prevailed upon him to communicate his plan to three gentlemen of the artillery in this army, well acquainted in the knowledge and practice of gunnery. By them he has been convinced, that, inasmuch as he set out upon wrong principles, the scheme would prove abortive. Unwilling however to relinquish his favourite project of re∣ducing the naval force of Great-Britain, he is very desirous of building a number of row-gallies for this purpose. But as the Congress alone are competent to the adoption of this measure, I have advised him (although he offered to go on with the building of them at his own expense, till the Con∣gress should decide) to repair immediately to Philadelphia with his proposals; where, if they should be agreed to, or vessels of superior force, agreeably to the wishes of most others, should be resolved on, he may set instantly about them, with all the materials upon the spot:—here, they are to collect. To him therefore I refer for further in∣formation on this head.</P>
<P>A vessel, said to be from Philadelphia and bound to Bos∣ton, with a hundred and twenty pipes of wine (a hundred and eighteen of which are secured) stranded at a place called Eastham, in a gale of wind on the second instant:—another from Boston to Halifax, with dry goods, &amp;c. (amounting, per invoice, to about two hundred and forty pounds lawful) got disabled in the same gale, near Beverly. These car∣goes, with the papers, I have ordered to this place,—the vessels to be taken care of till further orders. I have also an account of the taking of a wood-sloop bound to Boston,
<PB N="48" REF="029737_0047_0FE246D5C2455838"/>
and carried into Portsmouth by one of our armed vessels;—particulars not yet come to hand;—and this instant, of two others, from Nova-Scotia to Boston, with hay, wood, live stock, &amp;c. by another of our armed schooners.—These are in Plymouth.</P>
<P>These accidents and captures point out the necessity of establishing proper courts without loss of time, for the de∣cision of property, and the legality of seizures; otherwise I may be involved in inextricable difficulties.</P>
<P>Our prisoners, by the reduction of Fort Chamblee (on which happy event I most sincerely congratulate the Con∣gress) being considerably augmented, and likely to be in∣creased, I submit it to the wisdom of Congress, whether some convenient inland towns, remote from the post-roads, ought not to be assigned them; the manner of their treat∣ment, subsistence, &amp;c. defined; and a commissary or agent appointed, to see that justice is done both to them and the public, proper accounts rendered, &amp;c. Without a mode of this sort is adopted, I fear there will be sad confusion hereafter, as there are great complaints at present.</P>
<P>I reckoned without my host, when I informed the Con∣gress in my last, that I should in a day or two be able to acquaint them of the disposition of the soldiery towards a new enlistment. I have been in consultation with the gen∣erals of this army ever since Thursday last, endeavouring to establish new corps of officers; but find so many doubts and difficulties to reconcile, that I cannot say when they are to end, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> consequences; as there appears to be such an unwillingness in the officers of one government mixing in the same regiment with those of another; and, without it, many must be dismissed who are willing to serve, notwithstanding we are deficient on the whole.</P>
<P>The council of officers are unanimously of opinion that the command of the artillery should no longer continue in colonel * * *; and knowing of no person better qual∣ified to supply his place, or whose appointment will give more general satisfaction, have taken the liberty of recom∣mending Henry Knox, esquire, to the consideration of Congress, thinking it indispensably necessary at the same time that this regiment should consist of two lieutenant-col∣onels, two majors, and twelve companies, agreeably to the
<PB N="49" REF="029737_0048_0FE246D7461A83E8"/>
plan and estimate handed in; which, differing from the last establishment, I should be glad to be instructed on.</P>
<P>The commissary-general not being returned, will apolo∣gize, I hope, for my silence respecting a requisition of the expense of his clerks, &amp;c. which I was to have obtained together with others, and forwarded.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing of colonel Arnold since the thir∣teenth ultimo. His letter of, and journal to, that date, will convey all the information I am able to give of him. I think he must be in Quebec. If any mischance had hap∣pened to him, he would, as directed, have forwarded an express. No account yet of the armed vessels sent to St. Laurence. I think they will meet the stores inward or outward bound.</P>
<P>Captain Symons, in the Cerberus lately sent from Boston to Falmouth, hath published the inclosed declaration at that place; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd it is suspected he intends to make some kind of a lodgment there. I wrote immediately to Colonel Fin∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of this army, who went up there upon the last alarm, to spirit up the people and oppose it at all events. Falmouth is about a hundred and thirty miles from this camp.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>* * * INCLOSED you have a copy of an act, passed this session, by the honourable council and house of repre∣sentatives of this province. It respects such captures as may be made by vessels fitted out by the province, or by individ∣uals thereof. As the armed vessels, fitted out at the con∣tinental expense, do not come under this law, I would have it submitted to the consideration of Congress, to point out a more summary way of proceeding, to determine the prop∣erty and mode of condemnation of such prizes as have been or hereafter may be made, than is specified in this act.</P>
<P>Should not a court be established by authority of Con∣gress, to take cognizance of prizes made by the continental vessels? Whatever the mode is which they are pleased to
<PB N="50" REF="029737_0049_0FE246D8CAEE7258"/>
adopt, there is an absolute necessity of its being speedily de∣termined on: for I cannot spare time from military affairs, to give proper attention to these matters.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Plymouth have taken a sloop, laden with provisions, &amp;c. from Halifax, bound to Boston: and the inhabitants of Beverly have, under cover of one of the armed schooners, taken a vessel from Ireland, laden with beef, pork, butter, &amp;c. for the same place. The latter brings papers and letters of a very interesting nature, which are in the hands of the honourable council, who informed me they will transmit them to you by this conveyance. To the contents of these papers and letters I must beg leave to refer you and the honourable Congress, who will now see the absolute necessity there is of exerting all their wis∣dom, to withstand the mighty efforts of our enemies.</P>
<P>The trouble I have in the arrangement of the army is real∣ly inconceivable. Many of the officers sent in their names to serve, in expectation of promotion: others stood aloof * * *; whilst a number who had declined have again sent in their names, to serve. So great has the confusion, aris∣ing from these and many other perplexing circumstances, been, that I found it absolutely impossible to fix this very in∣teresting business exactly on the plan resolved on in the con∣ference, though I have kept up to the spirit, as near as the nature and necessity of the case would admit of: the difficul∣ty with the soldiers is as great, indeed more so, if possible, than with the officers. They will not enlist, until they know their colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, captain, &amp;c.; so that it was necessary to fix the officers the first thing; which is, at last, in some manner done; and I have given out enlisting orders.</P>
<P>You, Sir, can much easier judge, than I can express, the anxiety of mind I must labour under on the occasion, especially at this time, when we may expect the enemy will begin to act on the arrival of their reinforcement, part of which is already come, and the remainder daily dropping in.</P>
<P>I have other distresses of a very alarming nature. The arms of our soldiery are so exceeding bad, that I assure you, Sir, I cannot place a proper confidence in them. Our powder is wasting fast, notwithstanding the strictest
<PB N="51" REF="029737_0050_0FE24732F4DF4358"/>
care, economy and attention are paid to it. The long series of wet weather we have had, renders the greater part of what has been served out to the men of no use. Yesterday I had a proof of it, as a party of the enemy, about four or five hundred, taking the advantage of a high tide, landed at Leechmore's point: we were alarmed, and of course ordered every man to examine his cartouch∣box, when the melancholy truth appeared; and we were obliged to furnish the greater part of them with fresh am∣munition.</P>
<P>The damage done at the point was the taking of a man who watched a few horses and cows: ten of the lat∣ter they carried off. Colonel Thompson marched down with his regiment of riflemen, and was joined by colonel Woodbridge, with a part of his and a part of Patterson's regiment, who gallantly waded through the water, and soon obliged the enemy to embark under cover of a man-of-war, a floating battery, and the fire of a battery on Charlestown neck. We have two of our men dangerously wounded by grape-shot from the man-of-war; and, by a flag sent out this day, we are informed the enemy lost two of their men.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your favours of the seventh and tenth instant, with the resolves of the honourable Congress, to which I will pay all due attention. As soon as two ca∣pable persons can be found, I will dispatch them to Nova-Scotia, on the service resolved on in Congress.</P>
<P>The resolve to raise two battalions of marines will (if practicable in this army) entirely derange what has been done. It is therein mentioned, "one colonel for the two battalions:"—of course, a colonel must be dismissed. One of the many difficulties which attended the new ar∣rangement, was in reconciling the different interests, and judging of the merits of the different colonels. In the dismission of this one, the same difficulties will occur. The officers and men must be acquainted with maritime
<PB N="52" REF="029737_0051_0FE246E1C161E1C0"/>
affairs; to comply with which, they must be picked out of the whole army,—one from this corps, one from an∣other,—so as to break through the whole system, which has cost us so much time, anxiety and pains, to bring into any tolerable form. Notwithstanding any difficulties which will arise, you may be assured, Sir, that I will use every endeavour to comply with their resolve.</P>
<P>I beg leave to submit it to the consideration of Con∣gress (if these two battalions can be formed out of this army) whether this is a time to weaken our lines, by em∣ploying any of the forces appointed to defend them, on any other service. The gentlemen who were here from the Congress know their vast extent: they must know that we shall have occasion for our whole force for that purpose; more so now than at any past time, as we may expect the enemy will take the advantage of the first hard weather, and attempt to make an impression somewhere. That this is their intention, we have many reasons to sus∣pect.</P>
<P>We have had, in the last week, six deserters, and took two straggling prisoners. They all agree that two compa∣nies, with a train of artillery and one of the regiments from Ireland, were arrived at Boston;—that fresh ammunition and flints have been served out;—that the grenadiers and light infantry had orders to hold themselves in readiness at a moment's warning.</P>
<P>As there is every appearance that this contest will not be soon decided, and of course that there must be an aug∣mentation of the continental army, would it not be eligible to raise two battalions of marines in New-York and Phila∣delphia, where there must be numbers of sailors now unem∣ployed?—This however is matter of opinion, which I men∣tion with all due deference to the superior judgment of the Congress.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have copies of two letters,—one from colonel Arnold,—the other from colonel * * *. I can form no judgment on the latter's conduct, until I see him. Notwithstanding the great defection, I do not despair of colonel Arnold's success. He will have, in all probabili∣ty, many more difficulties to encounter than if he had been a fortnight sooner; as it is likely that governor Carleton
<PB N="53" REF="029737_0052_0FE247359C2EFF10"/>
will, with what forces he can collect after the surrender of the rest of Canada, throw himself into Quebec, and there make his last effort. There is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate account from cap∣tains Broughton and Sillman, sent to the river St. Lau∣rence. The other cruisers have been chiefly confined to harbour, by the badness of the weather. The same reason has caused great delay in building of our barracks; which, with a most mortifying scarcity of fire-wood, discourages the men from enlisting. The last, I am afraid, is an insu∣perable obstacle. I have applied to the honourable house of representatives of this province, who were pleased to ap∣point a committee to negociate this business: and notwith∣standing all the pains they have and are taking, they find it impossible to supply our necessities. The want of a sufficient number of teams I understand to be the chief impediment.</P>
<P>I got returns this day from eleven colonels, of the num∣bers enlisted in their regiments. The whole amount is nine hundred and sixty-six men. There must be some other stimulus besides love for their country, to make men fond of the service. It would be a great encouragement, and no additional expense to the continent, were they to receive pay for the months of October and November; also a month's pay advance. The present state of the military chest will not admit of this. The sooner it is enabled to do so, the better.</P>
<P>The commissary-general is daily expected in camp. I cannot send you the estimate of the clerks in his depart∣ment, until he arrives.</P>
<P>I sincerely congratulate you upon the success of your arms, in the surrender of St. John's, which I hope is a happy presage of the reduction of the rest of Canada.</P>

<P>I HAD the honour of writing to you on the nine∣teenth instant. I have now to inform you that Henry Knox, esquire, is gone to New-York, with orders to for∣ward to this place what cannon and ordnance stores can be there procured. From thence he will proceed to gen∣eral
<PB N="54" REF="029737_0053_0FE246E3719FCBE0"/>
Schuyler on the same business, as you will see by the inclosed copy of instructions which I have given him. It would give me much satisfaction, that this gentleman, or any other whom you may think qualified, was appointed to the command of the artillery regiment. In my letter to you, of the eighth instant, I have expressed myself fully on this subject, which I beg leave to recommend to your immediate attention; as the formation of that corps will be at a stand, until I am honoured with your instructions thereon. * * * *</P>
<P>There are two persons engaged to go to Nova-Scotia, on the business recommended in your last. By the best information we have from thence, the stores, &amp;c. have been withdrawn some time. Should this not be the case, it is next to an impossibility to attempt any thing there, in the present unsettled and precarious state of the army. * * *</P>
<P>From what I can collect by my inquiries amongst the officers, it will be impossible to get the men to enlist for the continuance of the war; which will be an insuperable obstruction to the formation of the two battalions of ma∣rines on the plan resolved on in Congress. As it can make no difference, I propose to proceed on the new ar∣rangement of the army, and, when completed, inquire out such officers and men as are best qualified for that service, and endeavour to form these two battalions out of the whole. This appears to me the best method, and will, I hope, meet the approbation of Congress.</P>
<P>As it will be very difficult for the men to work when the hard frost sets in, I have thought it necessary (though of little u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at present) to take possession of Coble-hill, for the benefit of any future operations. It was effected, without the least opposition from the enemy, the twenty∣third instant. Their inactivity on this occasion is what I cannot account for;—it is probable they are meditating a blow somewhere.</P>
<P>About three hundred men, women and children of the poor inhabitants of Boston, came out to Point-Shir∣ley last Friday. They have brought their household fur∣niture, but are unprovided of every other necessary of life. I have recommended them to the attention of the
<PB N="55" REF="029737_0054_0FE247371ED72828"/>
committee of the honourable council of this province, now sitting at Watertown.</P>
<P>The number enlisted since my last are two thousand four hundred and fifty men. * * * * Our situation is truly alarming: and of this general Howe is well apprised, it being the common topic of conversation when the people left Boston last Friday. No doubt, when he is reinforced; he will avail himself of the information.</P>
<P>I am making the best disposition I can for our defence, having thrown up, besides the work on Coble-hill, several redoubts, half-moons, &amp;c. along the bay: and I fear I shall be under the necessity of calling in the militia and minute-men of the country to my assistance: I say, I fear it,—because, by what I can learn from the officers in the army, belonging to this colony, it will be next to an im∣possibility to keep them under any degree of discipline, and that it will be very difficult to prevail on them to re∣main a moment longer than they choose themselves. It is a mortifying reflection, to be reduced to this dilemma. There has been nothing wanting on my part, to infuse a proper spirit amongst the officers, that they may exert their influence with the soldiery. You see, by a fortnight's recruiting amongst men with arms in their hands, how little has been the success.</P>
<P>As the small-pox is now in Boston, I have used the precaution of prohibiting such as lately came out from coming near our camp. General Burgoyne, I am inform∣ed, will soon embark for England. I think the risk too great to write you by post, whilst it continues to pass through New-York. It is certain that a post has been in∣tercepted the beginning of last month, as they sent out several letters from Boston with the post-mark of Balti∣more on them. This goes by captain Joseph Blewer, who promises to deliver it carefully unto you.</P>
<P>You doubtless will have heard, before this reaches, of general Montgomery's having got poss;ess;ion of Mon∣tréal. I congratulate you thereon. He has troubles with his troops, as well as I have. All I can learn of colonel▪ Arnold is, that he is near Quebec. I hope Montgomery will be able to proceed to his assistance. I shall be very uneasy until I hear they are joined.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of writing to you the thirtieth ultimo, inclosing an inventory of the military stores taken on board the brig Nancy by captain Manly of the armed schooner Lee. I have now to inform you that he has since sent into Beverly a ship named the Concord, James Lowrie, master, from Greenock in Scotland, bound to Boston. She has on board dry goods and coals, to the value of three thousand six hundred and six pounds, nine shillings and seven pence sterling, shipped by Crawford, Anderson, and Co. and consigned to James Anderson, merchant in Boston. It is mentioned in the letters found
<PB N="57" REF="029737_0056_0FE24738A42A3590"/>
on board, that this cargo was for the use of the army: but, on a strict examination, I find it is really the property of the shippers and the person to whom consigned. Pray what is to be done with this ship and cargo? and what with the brigantine which brought the military stores?—It was agreed, in the conference last October, <HI>"that all vessels employed merely as transports, and unarmed, with their crews, be set at liberty, upon giving security to return to Europe; but that this indulgence be not extended longer than till the first of April next."</HI> In the shippers' letter, they mention: "You must procure a certificate from the general and admiral, of the Concord's being in the government service, such as the Glasgow packet brought with her, which was of great ser∣vice, procured a liberty to arm her, which was refused us; also gave her a preference for some recruits that went out in her." In another part of the letter, they say: "Cap∣tain Lowrie will deliver you the contract for the coals: we gave it to him, as it perhaps might be of use, as a certificate of his ship being employed in the government service." Every letter on board breathes nothing but enmity to this country: and a vast number of them there are.</P>
<P>It is some time since I recommended to the Congress that they would institute a court for the trial of prizes made by the continental armed vessels; which I hope they have ere now taken into their consideration: otherwise I should again take the liberty of urging it in the most pressing manner.</P>
<P>The conduct of a great number of the Connecticut troops has laid me under the necessity of calling in a body of the militia, much sooner than I apprehended there would be an occasion for such a step. I was afraid some time ago that they would incline to go home, when the time of their en∣listment expired. I called upon the officers of the several regiments, to know whether they could prevail on the men to remain until the first of January, or till a sufficient number of other forces could be raised to supply their place. I suppose they were deceived themselves: I know they deceived me by assurances that I need be under no apprehension on that score, for the men would not leave the lines. Last Friday shewed how much they were mis∣taken, as the major part of the troops of that colony were
<PB N="58" REF="029737_0057_0FE246E68039E838"/>
going away with their arms and ammunition. We have however by threats, pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asion, and the activity of the peo∣ple of the country who sent back many of them that had set out, prevailed upon the most part to stay. There are about eighty of them missing.</P>
<P>I have called in three thousand men from this province; and general Sullivan, who lately returned from the prov∣ince of New-Hampshire, having informed me that a num∣ber of men were there ready at the shortest notice, I have demanded two thousand from that province. These two bodies, I expect, will be in by the tenth instant, to make up the deficiency of the Connecticut-men whom I have promised to dismiss on that day, as well as the numbers to whom I was obliged to grant furloughs before any would enlist. As the same defection is much to be ap∣prehended when the time of the Massachusetts-Bay, New-Hampshire, and Rhode-Island forces is expired, I beg the attention of Congress to this important affair.</P>
<P>I am informed that it has been the custom of these prov∣inces in the last war, for the legislative power to order ev∣ery town to provide a certain quota of men for the cam∣paign. This or some other mode should be at present adopted, as I am satisfied the men cannot be had without. This the Congress will please to take into their immediate consideration. My suspicions on this head I shall also communicate to the governors Trumbull and Cooke, also to the New-Hampshire convention.</P>
<P>The number enlisted in the last week are about thirteen hundred men. By this you see how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low this important work goes on. * * *</P>
<P>An express is just come in from general Schuyler, with letters from colonel Arnold and general Montgomery, copies of which I have the honour to inclose you. Upon the whole, I think affairs carry a pleasing aspect in that quarter. The reduction of Quebec is an object of such great importance, that I doubt not the Congress will give every assistance in their power for the accomplishing it this winter.</P>
<P>By the last accounts from the armed schooners sent to the river St. Laurence, I fear we have but little to expect from them: they were falling short of provision, and men∣tion
<PB N="59" REF="029737_0058_0FE247428A3F4E68"/>
that they would be obliged to return; which at this time is particularly unfortunate, as, if they chose a proper station, all the vessels coming down that river must fall into their hands. The plague, trouble and vexation I have had with the crews of all the armed vessels, is inexpressible. I do believe there is not on earth a more disorderly set: ev∣ery time they come into port, we hear of nothing but mutinous complaints. Manly's success has lately, and but lately, quieted his people. The crews of the Washington and Harrison have actually deserted them; so that I have been under the necessity of ordering the agent to lay the latter up, and get hands for the other on the best terms he could.</P>
<P>The house of representatives and the honourable board have sent me a vote of theirs relative to the harbour of Cape-Cod, which you have herewith. I shall send an offi∣cer thither to examine what can be done for its defence, though I do not think I shall be able to give them such assistance as may be requisite; for I have at present neither men, powder, nor cannon to spare. The great want of powder is what the attention of Congress should be partic∣ularly applied to. I dare not attempt any thing offensive, let the temptation or advantage be ever so great, as I have not more of that most essential article than will be abso∣lutely necessary to defend our lines, should the enemy at∣tempt to attack them.</P>
<P>By recent information from Boston, general Howe is go∣ing to send out a number of the inhabitants, in order, it is thought, to make more room for his expected reinforce∣ments. There is one part of the information I can hardly give credit to:—a sailor says that a number of those com∣ing out have been inoculated, with design of spreading the small-pox through this country and camp. I have communicated this to the general court; and recommend∣ed their attention thereto.</P>
<P>They are arming one of the transports in Boston, with which they mean to decoy some of our armed vessels. As we are apprised of their design, I hope they will be disappointed.</P>
<P>My best respects wait on the gentlemen in Congress, and I am, Sir, your most humble, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I WROTE you, the fourth instant, by express, to which I beg you will be referred. My fears, that Brough∣ton and Sillman would not effect any good purpose, were too well founded. They are returned, and brought with them three of the principal inhabitants from the island of St. John's. * * * They brought the governor's commis∣sion, the province seal, &amp;c. &amp;c. As the captains acted without any warrant for such conduct, I have thought it but justice to discharge these gentlemen, whose families were left in the utmost distress.</P>
<P>I am credibly informed that James Anderson, the con∣signee and part owner of the ship Concord and cargo, is not only unfriendly to American liberty, but actually in arms against us,—being captain of the Scotch company at Boston. Whether your being acquainted with this cir∣cumstance, or not, will operate against the vessel and car∣go, I will not take upon me to say: but there are ma∣ny articles on board, so absolutely necessary for the ar∣my, that, whether she is made a prize or not, we must have them.</P>

<P>* * * THE numbers enlisted last week are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men. If they go on at this slow rate, it will be a long time be∣fore this army is complete. I have wrote to the governors of Connecticut and Rhode-Island, also to the conven∣tion of New-Hampshire, on this subject. A copy of my letter to them I have the honour to inclose herewith.
<PB N="61" REF="029737_0060_0FE2474476DA30C8"/>
A letter to the same purport I sent to the legislature of this province.</P>
<P>The militia are coming in fast. I am much pleased with the alacrity which the good people of this province, as well as those of New-Hampshire, have shewn upon this occasion. I expect the whole will be in this day and to∣morrow, when what remains of the Connecticut [<HI>troops,</HI>] who have not enlisted, will have liberty to go to their fire∣sides.</P>
<P>The commissary-general is still by his indisposition de∣tained from camp. He committed an error, when mak∣ing out the ration-list: for he was then serving out (and has continued so to do) six ounces per man per week of butter, though it is not included in the list approved of by Congress. I do not think it would be expedient to put a stop thereto; as every thing, that would have a tendency to give the soldiery room for complaint, must be avoided.</P>
<P>The information I received that the enemy intended spreading the small-pox amongst us, I could not suppose them capable of. I now must give some credit to it, as it has made its appearance on several of those who last came out of Boston. Every necessary precaution has been taken to prevent its being communicated to this ar∣my; and the general court will take care that it does not spread through the country.</P>
<P>I have not heard that any more troops are arrived at Boston; which is a lucky circumstance, as the Connecticut troops, I now find, are for the most part gone off. The houses in Boston are lessening every day: they are pulled down, either for fire-wood, or to prevent the effects of fire, should we attempt a bombardment or an attack upon the town. Coble-hill is strongly fortified, without any interruption from the enemy. * * * This is what at present occurs; from, Sir, your most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED your favour of the second instant, with the several resolves of Congress therein inclosed. The re∣solves relative to captures made by continental armed ves∣sels only want a court established for trial, to make them complete. This, I hope, will be soon done, as I have taken the liberty to urge it often to the Congress.</P>
<P>I am somewhat at a loss to know whether I am to raise the two battalions of marines here, or not. As the delay can be attended with but little inconvenience, I will wait a farther explanation from Congress, before I take any steps therein.</P>
<P>I am much pleased that the money will be forwarded with all possible expedition, as it is much wanting; also that Conolly and his associates are taken. It has been a very fortunate discovery. I make no doubt but that the Congress will take every necessary measure to dispossess lord Dunmore of his hold in Virginia: the sooner steps are taken for that purpose, the more probability there will be of their being effectual. * * * *</P>
<P>I will make application to general Howe, and propose an exchange for Mr. Ethan Allen. I am much afraid I shall have a like proposal to make for captain Martindale, of the armed brigantine Washington, and his men, which, it is reported, was taken a few days past by a man-of-war, and carried into Boston. We cannot expect to be always successful.</P>
<P>You will doubtless hear of the barbarity of captain Wallace on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> island, ere this reaches your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>About a hundred and fifty more of the poor inhabit∣ants are come out of Boston. The small-pox rages all over the town: such of the military as had it not before are now under inoculation. This, I apprehend, is a wea∣pon of defence they are using against us. What confirms me in this opinion, is, that I have information that they are tearing up the pavement, to be provided against a bom∣bardment.</P>

<P>Yesterday, one large mortar was carried over to Bun∣ker's hill:—the troops filling water, carrying it on board the transports:—provisions scarce,—not more than suf∣ficient for six weeks. One regiment of foot, and three companies of the light-horse, sail for Halifax this day.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CAPTAIN Manly, of the Lee armed schooner, took and sent into Beverly the sloop Betsey, A. Atkinson, master. She is an armed vessel, dispatched by lord Dun∣more, with Indian corn, potatoes, and oats, for the army in Boston. The packets of letters found on board, I have the honour to send you with this by captain James Chambers, they being of so much importance that I do not think it would be prudent to trust them by a common express.</P>
<P>As lord Dunmore's schemes are fully laid open in these letters, I need not point out to the Congress the necessity there is of a vigorous exertion being adopted by them, to dispossess his lordship of the strong hold he has got in Virginia. I do not mean to dictate: but I am sure they will pardon me for giving them freely my opin∣ion, which is, that the fate of America a good deal de∣pends on his being obliged to evacuate Norfolk this win∣ter, or not.</P>
<P>I have Kirkland well secured, and think I will send him to you for examination. By most of the letters relative to him, he is a dangerous fellow. John Stewart's letters and papers are of a very interesting nature. Gov∣ernor Tonyn's and many other letters from Augustine shew the weakness of the place; at the same time, of what vast consequence it would be for us to possess our∣selves of it, and the great quantity of ammunition con∣tained in the forts. Indeed these papers are of so great consequence, that I think this but little inferior to any prize our famous Manly has taken.</P>
<P>We now work at our ease on Leechmore's hill. On discovering our party there yesterday morning, the ship which lay opposite began a cannonade, to which Mount Horam added some shells. One of our men was wound∣ed. We fired a few shot from two eighteen pounders which are placed on Coble-hill, and soon obliged the ship to shift her station. She now lies in the ferry-way: and, except a few shells from the mount in Boston, (which do no execution) we have no interruption in prosecuting our works. which will in a very short time be completed.
<PB N="65" REF="029737_0064_0FE247488E026D00"/>
When that is done,—when we have powder to sport with,—I think, if the Congress resolve on the execution of the proposal made relative to the town of Boston, it can be done.</P>
<P>I have sent a letter in this day to general Howe, of which a copy goes herewith. My reason for pointing out brigadier-general Prescot as the object who is to suffer Mr. Allen's fate, is, that, by letters from general Schuy∣ler, and copies of letters from general Montgomery to Schuyler, I am given to understand that Prescot is the cause of Allen's sufferings. I thought it best to be deci∣sive on the occasion, as did the generals whom I consulted thereon.</P>
<P>The returns of men enlisted since my last amount to about eighteen hundred, making in the whole seven thou∣sand one hundred and forty. The militia that are come in, both from this province and New-Hampshire, are very fine-looking men, and go through their duty with great alacrity. The dispatch made, both by the people in march∣ing and by the legislative powers in complying with my requisition, has given me infinite satisfaction.</P>
<P>Your letter of the eighth instant, with the explanatory resolve respecting my calling forth the militia and minute∣men, is come to hand; to which I shall pay all due atten∣tion. You have removed all the difficulties which I labour∣ed under, about the two battalions of marines. I shall obey the orders of Congress in looking out for proper offi∣cers to command that corps. I make no doubt but, when the money arrives to pay off the arrears and the month's ad∣vance, that it will be a great encouragement for the men to enlist.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a letter I lately received from Mr. James Lovell. His case is truly pitiable. I wish some mode could be fallen upon to relieve him from the cruel situation he is now in. I am sensible of the impropriety of exchang∣ing a soldier for a citizen: but there is something so cru∣elly distressing in regard to this gentleman, that I dare say you will take it under your consideration.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to address myself to you on the nineteenth instant, since which I have received endoubted information that the genuine instructions given to Conolly have not reached your hands; that they are very artfully concealed in the tree of his saddle, and covered with can∣vass so nicely that they are scarcely discernible: that those which were found upon him were intended to deceive, if he was caught. You will most certainly have his saddle taken to pieces, in order to discover this deep-laid plot.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a copy of general Howe's letter in answer to the one I wrote him the eighteenth instant. The con∣duct I am to observe towards brigadier Prescot in conse∣quence of these letters, the Congress will oblige me by determining for me.</P>
<P>The gentlemen by whom you sent the money are arriv∣ed. The sum they brought, though large, is not sufficient to answer the demands of the army, which at this time are remarkably heavy: there is three month's pay due, one month's advance, two dollars for each blanket,—the arms, that are left by those who are dismissed, to be paid for,—besides the demands which are on the commissary and quarter-master generals. You will therefore see the necessity of another remittance, which I beg may be as soon as you conveniently can.</P>
<P>I will take the opportunity of the return of these gen∣tlemen, to send colonel Kirkland to you for examination, and that you may dispose of him as to you may seem proper.</P>
<P>A committee from the general court of this province called on me the other day, informing me that they were in great want of ordnance for the defence of the colony; that, if what belonged to them, now in use here, was kept for the continent, they would be under the necessity of providing themselves with others: of course what is kept must be paid for. There are many of the cannon of very little use: such of them as are good, I cannot at present part with: perhaps when I receive the supply
<PB N="67" REF="029737_0066_0FE2474E83AC23C8"/>
from New-York and Canada, it may be in my power to spare them.</P>
<P>Mr. Wadsworth has sent in his report respecting Cape-Cod harbour, a copy of which you will receive herewith; also a letter from a Mr. Jacob Bailey, put into my hands by colonel Little. It contains some things that may not be unworthy the consideration of Congress.</P>
<P>We have made good progress in the works on Leech∣more's point. They would have been finished ere this, but for the severity of the weather, which prevents our people from working.</P>
<P>I received a letter from governor Cooke, which express∣es the fears of the people of Rhode-Island, lest the ships, which we had information were sailed, with some troops on board, were destined for Newport. I sent major-gen∣eral Lee there, to point out to them such defence as he may think the place capable of. I sincerely wish he may be able to do it with effect, as that place, in its present state, is an asylum for such as are disaffected to American liberty.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE to you the twenty-fifth instant; since which I am not honoured with any of your favours. The estimate I then inclosed you was calculated to pay the troops, &amp;c. up to the first of January. That cannot be done for want of funds in the pay-master-general's hands; which causes a great murmuring amongst those who are going off. The monthly expenies of this army amount to near two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, which I take the liberty of recommending to the observation of Congress, that their future remittances may be governed thereby.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="029737_0067_0FE246FB8B44A8A8"/>
It sometimes happens that persons would wish to deposit money in the hands of the pay-master-general, for his bills on the treasury at Philadelphia. He has hitherto declined such offers, not having authority from Congress to draw. Would it not be proper to give this power? If it should be approved of, you will please to point out the mode that the Congress would choose to have it done in.</P>
<P>The clothing sent to the quarter-master-general is not sufficient to put half our army into regimentals; nor is there a possibility of getting any quantity here. I have wrote to general Schuyler, that I wish what was lodged at Albany could be spared for these troops, as general Mont∣gomery would clothe the men under his command at Montréal. If this can be done, it will be of infinite ser∣vice; and no time should be lost in forwarding them to this camp.</P>
<P>In forming the regiments for the new establishment, I thought it but justice to appoint the officers, detached under colonel Arnold, to commissions in them. Their absence at present is of very great detriment to the service, especially in recruiting: I would therefore wish, if the Congress intend raising troops in or for Canada, that they could be taken in there. The sooner I have their opin∣ion of this matter, the better, that, if they can be com∣missioned in Canada, I may appoint officers here to replace them.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have a copy of a representation sent to me by the legislative body of this province, respecting four companies stationed at Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham. As they were never regimented, and were doing duty at a distance from the rest of the army, I did not know whether to consider them as a part of it; nor do I think myself authorised to direct payment for them with∣out the approbation of Congress.</P>
<P>It has been represented to me that the free negroes who have served in this army are very much dissatisfied at be∣ing discarded. As it is to be apprehended that they may seek employ in the ministerial army, I have presumed to depart from the resolution respecting them, and have given license for their being enlisted. If this is disapprov∣ed of by Congress, I will put a stop to it.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="029737_0068_0FE2475111CB9A60"/>
* * * I must remark that the pay of the assistant en∣gineers is so very small, that we cannot expect men of science will engage in it. Those gentlemen, who are in that station, remained under the expectation that an addi∣tional allowance would be made them by the respective provinces in which they were appointed, to that allowed by the Congress.</P>
<P>Captain Freeman arrived this day at camp from Canada. He left Quebec the twenty-fourth ultimo, in consequence of general Carleton's proclamation which I have the hon∣our to send you herewith. He saw colonel Arnold the twenty-sixth, and says that he was joined at Point-à-trem∣ble by general Montgomery, the first instant;—that they were about two thousand strong, and were making every preparation for attacking Quebec;—that general Carleton had with him about twelve hundred men, the majority of whom are sailors;—that it was his opinion the French would give up the place if they get the same conditions granted to the inhabitants of Montréal. * * *</P>
<P>Captains Semple and Harbeson take under their care Mr. Kirkland. * * * Captain Mathews and Mr. Rob∣inson will accompany them. The two latter were taken prisoners by lord Dunmore, who was sending them to Boston, from whence there is little doubt but they would be forwarded to England, to which place I am credibly informed captain Martindale and the crew of the Wash∣ington are sent; also colonel Allen, and the prisoners tak∣en with him in Canada. This may account for general Howe's silence on the subject of an exchange of prisoners mentioned in my letter to him.</P>
<P>General Lee is just returned from his excursion to Rhode-Island:—he has pointed out the best method the island would admit of for its defence: he has endeavoured all in his power to make friends of those that were our en∣emies. You have, inclosed, a specimen of his abilities in that way, for your perusal. I am of opinion that, if the same plan was pursued through every province, it would have a very good effect.</P>
<P>I have long had it on my mind to mention to Congress, that frequent applications had been made to me respecting the chaplains' pay, which is too small to encourage men
<PB N="70" REF="029737_0069_0FE246FE18F32178"/>
of abilities. Some of them, who have left their flocks, are obliged to pay the parson acting for them more than they receive. I need not point out the great utility of gentlemen whose lives and conversation are unexceptiona∣ble, being employed for that service in this army. There are two ways of making it worth the attention of such: one is an advancement of their pay; the other, that one chaplain be appointed to two regiments. This last, I think, may be done without inconvenience. I beg leave to recommend this matter to Congress, whose sentiments hereon I shall impatiently expect.</P>
<P>Upon a farther conversation with captain Freeman, he is of opinion that general Montgomery has with him near three thousand men, including colonel Arnold's. He says that lord Pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had received repeated orders from his father to return home; in consequence of which, he had embarked, some time in October, with a captain Green who was master of a vessel belonging to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>By a number of salutes in Boston harbour yesterday, I fancy admiral Shuldha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is arrived. Two large ships were seen coming in.</P>
<P>Our enlistments now amount to nine thousand six hun∣dred and fifty.</P>
<P>Those gentlemen who were made prisoners by lord Dunmore, being left destitute of money and necessaries, I have advanced them a hundred pounds lawful-money be∣longing to the public, for which I have taken captain Ma∣thews's draught on the treasury of Virginia, which goes inclosed.</P>

<P>SINCE my last of the thirty-first ultimo, I have been honoured with your favour of the twenty-second, inclosing sundry resolves, which shall, in matters they respect, be made the rule of my conduct.</P>
<P>The resolution relative to the troops in Boston, I beg the favour of you, Sir, to assure Congress shall be attempt∣ed
<PB N="71" REF="029737_0070_0FE24752947DE150"/>
to be put in execution the first moment I see a proba∣bility of success, and in such a way as a council of officers shall think most likely to produce it: but if this should not happen as soon as you may expect or my wishes prompt to, I request that Congress will be pleased to advert to my situation, and do me the justice to believe, that circum∣stances, and not want of inclination, are the cause of delay.</P>
<P>It is not in the pages of history perhaps to furnish a case like ours:—to maintain a post within musket-shot of the enemy, for six months together, without<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Left blank in the original to guard against the danger of miscarriage. Read, <HI>"without powder."</HI></NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and at the same time to disband one army, and recruit another, within that distance of twenty-odd British regiments,—is more, probably, than ever was attempted. But if we suc∣ceed as well in the last, as we have heretofore in the first, I shall think it the most fortunate event of my whole life.</P>
<P>By a very intelligent gentleman, a Mr. Hutchinson, from Boston, I learn, that it was admiral Shuldham that came into the harbour on Saturday last; that two of the five regiments from Cork are arrived at Halifax; two others have sailed for Quebec; but what was become of them could not be told:—and the other (the fifty-fifth) has just got into Boston. Certain it is also, that the greatest part of the seventeenth regiment is arrived there. Whether we are to conclude from hence that more than five regiments have been sent out, or that the com∣panies of the seventeenth, arrived at Boston, are part of the regiments destined for Halifax and Quebec, I know not.</P>
<P>We also learn from this gentleman and others, that the troops, embarked for Halifax (as mentioned in my letter of the sixteenth) were really designed for that place, but recalled from Nantasket road, upon advice being received of the above regiments there. I am also informed of a fleet now getting ready under the convoy of the Scarbo∣rough and Fowey men-of-war,—consisting of five trans∣ports and two bomb vessels, with about three hundred marines, and several flat-bottomed boats. It is whispered that they are designed for Newport, but generally thought
<PB N="72" REF="029737_0071_0FE246FF9ED829F8"/>
in Boston that it is meant for Long-Island: and it is probable it will be followed by more troops, as the other transports are taking in water,—to lie, as others say, in Nantasket road, to be out of the ice. A large quantity of biscuit is also baking.</P>
<P>As the real design cannot with certainty be known, I submit it, with all due deference, to the superior judgment of Congress, whether it would not be consistent with pru∣dence to have some of the Jersey troops thrown into New-York, to prevent an evil which would be almost irremedia∣ble, should it happen,—I mean, the landing of troops at that place, or upon Long-Island near it.</P>
<P>As it is possible you may not yet have received his maj∣esty's <HI>"most gracious"</HI> speech, I do myself the honour to inclose one of many, which were sent out of Boston yester∣day.

<P>EVERY account I have out of Boston confirms the embarkation of troops mentioned in my last, which, from the season of the year and other circumstances, must be destined for some expedition to the southward of this. I have therefore thought it prudent to send major-general Lee to New-York. I have given him letters recommen∣datory to governor Trumbull, and to the committee of safety at New-York. I have good hopes that in Connec∣ticut he will get many volunteers, who (I have some rea∣son to think) will accompany him on this expedition, without more expense to the continent than their mainte∣nance. But should it be otherwise, and that they should expect pay, I think it is a trifling consideration, when put
<PB N="73" REF="029737_0072_0FE247541B7B2FD0"/>
in competition with the importance of the object, which is to put the city of New-York, with such parts of the North-river and Long-Island as to him shall seem proper, in that state of defence, which the season of the year and circum∣stances will admit of,—so as, if possible, to prevent the enemy from forming a lodgement in that government, which, I am afraid, contains too many persons disaffected to the cause of liberty and America. I have also wrote to lord Stirling to give him all the assistance that he can with the troops under his command in the continental service, provided it does not interfere with any orders he may re∣ceive from Congress relative to them.</P>
<P>I hope the Congress will approve of my conduct in send∣ing general Lee upon this expedition:—I am sure I mean it well; as experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves, than it is to dis∣lodge them after they have got possession.</P>
<P>The evening of the eighth instant, a party of our men, under the command of major Knoulton, were ordered to go and burn some houses which lay at the foot of Bunker's-hill, and at the head of Charlestown. They were also or∣dered to bring off the guard, which, we expected, consist∣ed of an officer and thirty men. They crossed the mill∣dam about half after eight o'clock, and gallantly executed their business,—having burned eight houses, and brought with them a sergeant and four privates of the tenth regi∣ment. There was but one man more there, who making some resistance, they were obliged to dispatch. The gun that killed him was the only one discharged by our men, though several hundred were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired by the enemy from with∣in their works, but in so confused a manner, that not one of our people was hurt.</P>
<P>Our enlistments go on very heavily.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM exceedingly sorry that I am under the neces∣sity of applying to you, and calling the attention of Con∣gress to the state of our arms, which is truly alarming.
<PB N="74" REF="029737_0073_0FE24701236FDE70"/>
Upon the dissolution of the old army, I was apprehensive that the new would be deficient in this instance: and, that the want might be as inconsiderable as possible, I gave it out in orders, that the arms of such men as did not re-enlist (or such of them as were good) should be retained at the prices which should be affixed by persons appointed to in∣spect and value them: and, that we might be sure of them, I added that there would be a stoppage of pay for the months of November and December, from those who should carry their firelocks away without their being first examined. I hoped, by these precautions, to have procured a consider∣able number: but, Sir, I find with much concern, that, from the badness of the arms, and the disobedience of too many in bearing them off without a previous inspection,—very few were collected. Neither are we to expect that many will be brought in by the new recruits,—the officers, who are out enlisting, having reported that few men who have arms will engage in the service; and that they are under the disagreeable alternative of taking men without arms, or of getting none. Unhappy situation, and much to be deplored!—especially when we have every reason to convince us, that we have to contend with a formidable army, well provided of every necessary; and that there will be a most vigorous exertion of ministerial vengeance against us, as soon as they think themselves in a condition for it. I hope it is in the power of Congress to afford us relief:—if it is not, what must, what can be done?</P>
<P>Our treasury is almost exhausted, and the demands against it very considerable. A constant supply of money, to answer every claim and exigency, would much promote the good of the service. In the common affairs of life, it is useful: in war, it is absolutely necessary and essential. I would beg leave, too, to remind you of the tents, and of their importance,—hoping that, if an opportunity has offered, you have procured them. I fear that our army will not be raised to the new establishment in any reasona∣ble time, if ever: the enlisting goes on so very slow, that it almost seems at an end.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fourth instant, I wrote you that I had received certain intelligence from a Mr. Hutchinson and others, that two of the five regiments from Cork were
<PB N="75" REF="029737_0074_0FE2475CE3F15AE0"/>
arrived at Halifax, one at Boston, and the two others had sailed for Quebec, and had not been heard of. I am new assured (as a matter to be relied on) by four captains of ships, who left England about the second of November, and who appear to be men of veracity, that the whole of these regiments, (except the two companies that arriv∣ed at Boston some time ago) when they sailed, were at Milford Haven, where they had been obliged to put in, by a violent storm, the nineteenth of October; that they would not be able to leave it for a considerable time, as they were under the necessity of repairing their vessels, and getting some new ones taken up. Such is the un∣certainty and contradiction in what I now hear, that it is not possible to know what to believe or disbelieve.</P>
<P>I wrote to the general court yesterday, and to the con∣vention of New-Hampshire, immediately upon seeing the great deficiency in our arms,—praying that they would in∣terest themselves in the matter, and furnish me with all in their power. Whether I shall get any, or what quantity, I cannot determine, not having received their answers. The same application will be made to the governments of Con∣necticut and Rhode-Island.</P>
<P>I do myself the honour to send you sundry newspapers I received from the above-mentioned captains, as they may be later than any you have seen, and contain some interest∣ing intelligence.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKING it for granted that general Schuyler has not only informed you of the fall of the brave and much-to-be-lamented general Montgomery, but of the situation of our affairs in Canada, (as related by general Wooster, colonel Arnold, colonel Campbell, and others) I shall not take up much more of your time on this subject, than is necessary to inclose you a copy of his letter to me, with the result thereon, as appears by the council of war, which I immediately summoned on the occasion, and at
<PB N="76" REF="029737_0075_0FE2470B070A2B78"/>
which Mr. Adams, by my particular desire, was good enough to attend.</P>
<P>It may appear strange, Sir, as I had not men to spare from these lines, that I should presume (without first sending to Congress, and obtaining an express direction) to recommend to the governments of Massachusetts, Con∣necticut and New-Hampshire, to raise each a regiment, on the continental account, for this service. I wish most ar∣dently that the urgency of the case would have admitted of the delay. I wish also that the purport of general Schuy∣ler's letter had not, unavoidably as it were, laid me under an indispensable obligation to do it:—for having informed you in his letter (a copy of which he inclosed me) of his dependence on this quarter, for men, I thought you might also have some reliance on my exertions. This consideration, added to my fears of the fatal consequences of delay,—to an information of your having designed three thousand men for Canada,—to a belief, founded chiefly on general Schuyler's letters, that few or none of them were raised,—and to my apprehensions for New-York, which led me to think that no troops could be spared from that quarter,—induced me to lose not a moment's time in throwing in a force there; being well assured that general Carleton will improve to the utmost the advantages gained, leaving no artifices untried, to fix the Canadians and In∣dians (who, we find, are too well disposed to take part with the strongest) in his interest.</P>
<P>If these reasons are not sufficient to justify my conduct in the opinion of Congress,—if the measure contravenes any resolution of theirs, they will please to countermand the levying and marching of the regiments as soon as pos∣sible, and do me the justice to believe that my intentions were good, if my judgment has erred.</P>
<P>The Congress will please also to observe, that the meas∣ure of supporting our posts in Canada appeared of such ex∣ceeding great importance, that the general officers (agree∣ing with me in sentiment, and unwilling to lay any burden which can possibly be avoided,—although it may turn out an ill-timed piece of parsimony) have resolved that the three regiments for Canada shall be part of the thirteen militia regiments which were requested to reinforce this
<PB N="77" REF="029737_0076_0FE1BF97627D7BA8"/>
army,—as appears by the minutes of another council of war, held on the sixteenth instant. I shall (being much hurried and fatigued) add no more in this letter, than my duty to Congress, and that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>P. S. I inclose you a copy of my letter to the govern∣ments of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New-Hamp∣shire; also a copy of a resolution of this colony, in answer to an application of mine for arms.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I have been informed by a message from the general court of Massachusetts, that they have resolved upon the raising of a regiment for Can∣ada, and appointed the field officers for it, in the western parts of this government. I am also informed by express from governor Trumbull, that he and his council of safety had agreed upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> raising of a regiment for the same purpose; which was anticipating my application to that government.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE commissary-general being at length [<HI>recovered</HI>] from along and painful illness, I have it in my power to comply with the requisition of Congress, in forwarding an estimate of the expense attending his office, as also that of the quarter-master-general.</P>
<P>You will please to observe that the commissary, by his account of the matter, has entered into no special agree∣ment with any of the persons he has found occasion to em∣ploy, (as those, to whose names sums are annexed, are of their own fixing) but left it to Congress to ascertain their wages. I shall say nothing therefore on this head, farther than relates to the proposition of Mr. * * *, to be allow∣ed one eighth for his trouble and the delivery of the other seven eighths of provisions, which to me appears exorbitant in the extreme, however conformable it may be to custom
<PB N="78" REF="029737_0077_0FE2470CE9A53588"/>
and usage: I therefore think that reasonable stipends had better be fixed upon. Both the quarter-master and com∣missary-generals assure me, that they do not employ a single person uselessly: and as I have too good an opinion of them to think they would deceive me, I believe them.</P>
<P>I shall take the liberty, in this place, of recommending the expediency, indeed the absolute necessity, of appoint∣ing fit and proper persons to settle the accounts of this army. To do it with precision, requires time, care, and attention: the longer it is left undone, the more intricate they will be, the more liable to error, and difficult to ex∣plain and rectify;—as also the persons in whose hands they are (if disposed to take undue advantage) will be less subject to detection. I have been as attentive as the nature of my office would admit of, in granting warrants for mon∣ey on the pay-master: but it would be absolutely impossi∣ble for me to go into an examination of all the accounts incident to this army, and the vouchers appertaining to them, without devoting so large a portion of my time to the business, as might not only prove injurious, but fatal to it in other respects. This ought, in my humble opinion, to be the particular business of a select committe of Con∣gress, or one appointed by them, who, once in three months at furthest, should make a settlement with the officers in the different departments.</P>
<P>Having met with no encouragement from the govern∣ments of Massachusetts and New-Hampshire, from my application for arms, and expecting no better from Con∣necticut and Rhode-Island, I have, as the last expedient, sent one or two officers from each regiment into the country, with money, to try if they can buy. In what manner they succeed, Congress shall be informed as soon as they return.</P>
<P>Congress, in my last, would discover my motives for strengthening these lines with the militia: but whether, as the weather turns out exceedingly mild, insomuch as to promise nothing favourable from ice,—and no appearance of powder,—I shall be able to attempt any thing decisive, time only can determine. No man upon earth wishes more ardently to destroy the nest in Boston, than I do:—no person would be willing to go greater lengths than I
<PB N="79" REF="029737_0078_0FE24760470C5A10"/>
shall, to accomplish it, if it shall be thought adviseable. But if we have neither powder to bombard with, nor ice to pass on, we shall be in no better situation than we have been in all the year:—we shall be worse, because their works are stronger.</P>
<P>I have accounts from Boston, which I think may be relied on, that general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inton, with about four or five hundred men, hath left that place within these four days. Whether this is part of the detachment which was mak∣ing up (as mentioned in my letter of the fourth instant, and then at Nantasket) or not, is not in my power to say. If it is designed for New-York or Long-Island as some think, throwing a body of troops there may prove a for∣tunate circumstance. If they go farther south agreeable to the conjectures of others, I hope there will be men to receive them.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the positive assertions of the four cap∣tains from Portsmouth, noticed in my letter of the four∣teenth, I am now convinced from several corroborating circumstances,—the accounts of deserters, and of a lieu∣tenant Hill, of lord Percy's regiment, who left Ireland the fifth of November, and was taken by a privateer from Newburyport,—that the seventeenth and fifty-fifth regi∣ments are arrived at Boston, and other troops at Halifax, agreeable to the information of Hutchinson and others. Lieutenant Hill says that the transports of two regiments only were forced into Milford Haven.</P>
<P>Congress will think me a little remiss, I fear, when I inform them that I have done nothing yet towards raising the battalion of marines: but I hope to stand exculpated from blame, when they hear the reason, which was, that already having twenty-six incomplete regiments, I thought it would be adding to an expense, already great, in officers, to set two entire corps of officers on foot, when perhaps we should not add ten men a week by it to our present numbers. In this opinion the general officers have concur∣red, which induced me to suspend the matter a little long∣er. Our enlistments, for the two last weeks, have not amounted to a thousand men, and are diminishing. The regiment for Canada (it is thought) will soon be filled, as
<PB N="80" REF="029737_0079_0FE2470E6E5E21E8"/>
the men are to choose all but their field officers, who are appointed by the court.</P>
<P>On Sunday evening, thirteen of the Caghnewaga In∣dians arrived here on a visit. I shall take care that they be so entertained during their stay, that they may return impressed with sentiments of friendship for us, and also of our great strength. One of them is colonel Louis, who honoured me with a visit once before.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favours of the sixth and twentieth instant I received yesterday, with the several resolves of Congress alluded to; for which I return you my thanks.</P>
<P>Knowing the great importance Canada will be of to us in the present interesting contest, and the relief our friends there stand in need of, I should be happy, were it in my power to detach a battalion from this camp: but it can∣not be done. On the nineteeth instant, I had the hon∣our to write to you, which will fully convey the resolu∣tions of a council of war, and the sentiments of the gener∣al officers here, as to the propriety and expediency of sending troops from these lines, for the defence of which we have been and now are obliged to call in the militia;—to which I beg leave to refer you. You may rest as∣sured that my endeavours and exertions shall not be want∣ing, to stimulate the governments of Connecticut and New-Hampshire to raise and forward reinforcements as fast as possible; nor in any other instance that will pro∣mote the expedition.</P>
<P>I shall, in obedience to the order of Congress, though interdicted by general Howe, propose an exchange of governor Skene for Mr. Lovell and family, and shall be happy to have an opportunity of putting this deserving man (who has distinguished his fidelity and regard to his country to be too great for persecution and cruelty to overcome) in any post agreeable to his wishes and in∣clination.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="029737_0080_0FE24761CCEC0390"/>
I do not know that there is any particular rank annex∣ed to the office of aide-de-camp. Generally they are captains, and rank as such: but higher rank is often given on account of particular merit and particular circum∣stances. Aides to the king have the rank of colonels. Whether any distinction should be made between those of your commander-in-chief and the other generals, I really know not:—I think there ought.</P>
<P>You may rely that Conolly had instructions conceal∣ed in his saddle. Mr. * * * who was one of lord Dunmore's family, and another gentleman who wishes his name not to be mentioned, saw them cased in tin, put in the tree, and covered over. He probably has exchanged his saddle, or withdrew the papers when it was mended, as you conjecture. Those that have been discovered are sufficiently bad; but I doubt not of the others being worse, and containing more diabolical and extensive plans. I hope he will be taken proper care of, and meet with re∣wards equal to his merits.</P>
<P>I shall appoint officers in the places of those who are in Canada, as I am fully persuaded they will wish to con∣tinue there, for making our conquest complete in that quarter. I wish their bravery and valour may be attend∣ed with the smiles of fortune.</P>
<P>It gives me great pleasure to hear of the measures Con∣gress are taking for manufacturing powder. I hope their endeavours will be crowned with success. I too well know and regret the want of it. It is scarcely possible to describe the disadvantages an army must labour under, when not provided with a sufficient supply of this nec∣essary. It may seem strange, that, after having received about eleven tons, added to about five tons which I found here, and no general action has happened, we should be so deficient in this article, and require more. But you will please to consider, that, besides its being in its nature sub∣ject to waste, and (whilst the men lay in bad tents) una∣voidably damaged by severe and heavy rains (which could not have been prevented, unless it had been entirely with∣drawn from the men, and an attack hazarded against us without ammunition in their hands)—the armed vessels, our own occasional firings, and some small supplies I have
<PB N="82" REF="029737_0081_0FE2470FF0EF05F8"/>
been obliged to afford the sea-port towns threatened with destruction,—to which may be added the supply to the mi∣litia, and going off of the old troops,—have occasioned, and ever will, a large consumption of it, and waste, in spite of all the care in the world. The king's troops never have less than sixty rounds a man in their possession, independ∣ent of their stores. To supply an army of twenty thou∣sand men in this manner, would take near four hundred barrels, allowing nothing for stores, artillery, &amp;c. I have been always afraid to place more than twelve or fifteen rounds at a time in the hands of our men, lest, any acci∣dent happening to it, we should be left destitute, and be undone. I have been thus particular, not only to shew our poverty, but to exculpate myself from even a suspicion of unnecessary waste.</P>
<P>I shall inform the pay-master-general of the resolution of Congress respecting his draughts, and the mode and account of them.</P>
<P>The companies at Chelsea and Malden are and have always been regimented. It was not my intention to re∣place with continental troops the independent companies at Hingham, Weymouth and Braintree. These places are exposed, but not more than Cape-Ann, Beverly, Sa∣lem, Marblehead, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Is it the intention of Congress that the officers of the army should pay postage? They are not exempted by the resolve of the ninth instant.</P>
<P>The Congress will be pleased, I have no doubt, to recol∣lect that the five hundred thousand dollars, now coming, are but little more than enough to bring us up to the first day of this month; that to-morrow will be the last of it; and, by their resolves, the troops are to be paid monthly.</P>
<P>I wish it was in my power to furnish Congress with such a general as they desire, to send to Canada. Since the un∣happy reverse of our affairs in that quarter, general Schuy∣ler has informed me, that, though he had thoughts of declin∣ing the service before, he would now act. My letter of the eleventh will inform them of general Lee's being at New-York. He will be ready to obey their orders, should they incline to send him: but, if I am not greatly deceived, he or some other spirited able officer will be wanted there
<PB N="83" REF="029737_0082_0FE2476A66501718"/>
in the spring, if not sooner; as we have undoubted intelli∣gence that general Clinton has sailed with some troops. The reports of their number are various, from between four and five hundred to nineteen companies of grenadiers and light infantry. It is also imagined that the regiments, which were to sail the first of December, are intended for that place or Virginia. General Putnam is a most valuable man, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine executive officer: but I do not know how he would conduct in a separate department. He is a young∣er major-general than Mr. Schuyler, who, as I have ob∣served, having determined to continue in the service, will, I expect, repair into Canada. A copy of my letter to him, on this and other subjects, I inclose you, as it will explain my motives for not stopping the regiments from these gov∣ernments.</P>
<P>When captain Cockran arrives, I will give him every assistance in my power, in obedience to the orders of Con∣gress: but I fear it will be the means of laying up our own vessels, as these people will not bear the distinction. Should this be the consequence, it will be highly preju∣dicial to us, as we sometimes pick up their provision-vessels, and may continue to distress them in this way.</P>
<P>Last week captain Manly took a ship and a brig bound to Boston from Whitehaven, with coals chiefly, and some potatoes, for the army. I have, for his great vigilance and industry, appointed him commodore of our little squad∣ron; and he now hoists his flag on board the schooner Hancock.</P>
<P>I congratulate you upon the recovery of Smith, and am exceedingly glad to hear of the measures Congress are tak∣ing for the general defence of the continent. The clouds thicken fast: where they will burst, I know not: but we should be armed at all points.</P>
<P>I have not succeeded in my applications to these govern∣ments for arms. They have returned for answer, that they cannot furnish any. Whether I shall be more lucky in the last resource left me in this quarter, I cannot deter∣mine, having not received returns from the officers sent out to purchase of the people. I greatly fear that but very few will be procured in this way, as they are exceedingly scarce, and but a small part of what there are, fit for ser∣vice.
<PB N="84" REF="029737_0083_0FE247199C5FEE68"/>
When they make their report, you shall be in∣formed.</P>
<P>The quarter-master-general has just received from gen∣eral Schuyler clothing for the soldiery, amounting to about seventeen hundred pounds York currency. It has come very seasonably, as they are in great want, and will con∣tribute a little to their relief.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I saw Mr. * * *, and men∣tioning that nothing had been found in the tree of Conol∣ly's saddle, he told me there had been a mistake in the matter; that the instructions were artfully concealed on the two pieces of wood which are on the mail-pillion of his portmanteau-saddle; that, by order of lord Dun∣more, he saw them contrived for the purpose, the papers put in, and first covered with tin, and over that with a waxed canvass cloth. He is so exceedingly pointed and clear in his information, that I have no doubt of its being true. I could wish them to be discovered, as I think they contain some curious and extraordinary plans.</P>
<P>In my letter of the twenty-fourth instant I mentioned the arrival of thirteen of our Caghnewaga friends. They honoured me with a talk to-day, as did three of the tribes of the St. John's and Pafmiquoddi Indians;—copies of which I beg leave to inclose you. I shall write to general Schuyler respecting the tender of service made by the for∣mer, and not to call for their assistance, unless he shall at any time want it, or be under the necessity of doing it to prevent their taking the side of our enemies.</P>
<P>I had the honour of writing you on the nineteenth of November, and then I informed you of having engaged two persons to go to Nova-Scotia on the business recom∣mended in your letter of the tenth; and also that the state of the army would not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n admit of a sufficient force be∣ing sent, for carrying into execution the views of Congress respecting the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck-yards, &amp;c.—I would now beg leave to mention, that, if the persons, sent for information, should report favourably of the expediency and practicability of the measure, it will not be in my power to detach any men from these lines: the situation of our affairs will not allow it. I think it would be adviseable to raise them in the east∣ern parts of this government. If it is attempted, it must
<PB N="85" REF="029737_0084_0FE2476BEAAE4500"/>
be by people from the country. A colonel * * * and a captain * * * have been with me:—they think the men necessary may be easily engaged there, and the measure prac∣ticable: provided there are not more than two hundred British troops at Halifax, they are willing and ready to embark in the matter, upon the terms mentioned in their plan, which I inclose you. I would wish you to advert to the considerations inducing them to the expedition, as I am not without apprehension, should it be undertaken upon their plan, that the innocent and guilty will be involved in one common ruin. I presume they do not expect to receive more than the five or ten thousand pounds mentioned in their scheme, and to be at every expense. If we had men to spare, it might be undertaken for less than either, I con∣ceive. Perhaps, if Congress do not adopt their proposi∣tion, they will undertake to raise men for that particular purpose, who may be disbanded as soon as it is effected, and upon the same terms that are allowed the continental troops in general. Whatever may be the determination of Congress upon the subject, you will please to communicate it to me immediately: for the season most favourable for the enterprise is advancing fast; and we may expect in the spring, that there will be more troops there, and the meas∣ure be more difficult to execute.</P>

<P>THE purport of this letter will be directed to a single object: through you, I mean to lay it before Congress; and, at the same time that▪ I beg their serious attention to the subject, to ask pardon for intruding an opinion, not only unasked, but, in some measure, repugnant to their resolves.</P>
<P>The disadvantages attending the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mited enlistment of troops are too apparent to those who are eye-witnesses of them, to render any animadversions necessary: but to gen∣tlemen at a distance, whose attention is engrossed by a thou∣sand important objects, the case may be otherwise.</P>
<P>That this cause precipitated the fate of the brave and much-to-be-lamented general Montgomery, and brought on

the defeat which followed thereupon, I have not the most distant doubt: for, had he not been apprehensive of the troops leaving him at so important a crisis, but continued the blockade of Quebec, a capitulation (from the best ac∣counts I have been able to collect) must inevitably have followed. And that we were not at one time obliged to dispute these lines under disadvantageous circumstances (proceeding from the same cause, to wit, the troops disband∣ing of themselves before the militia could be got in) is to me a matter of wonder and astonishment: and proves that general Howe was either unacquainted with our situation, or restrained by his instructions from putting any thing to a hazard till his reinforcements should arrive.</P>
<P>The instance of general Montgomery—(I mention it be∣cause it is a striking one; for a number of others might be adduced)—proves, that instead of having men to take advantage of circumstances, you are in a manner compelled, right or wrong, to make circumstances yield to a secondary consideration. Since the first of December, I have been devising every means in my power to secure these encamp∣ments; and, though I am sensible that we never have, since that period, been able to act upon the offensive, and at times not in a condition to defend, yet the cost of marching home one set of men,—bringing in another,—the havoc and waste occasioned by the first,—the repairs necessary for the sec∣ond, with a thousand incidental charges and inconveniences which have arisen, and which it is scarce possible either to recollect or describe—amount to near as much, as the keeping up a respectable body of troops the whole time, ready for any emergency, would have done. To this may be added, that you never can have a well-disciplined army.</P>
<P>To bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well acquainted with the duties of a sol∣dier, requires time. To bring them under proper discipline and subordination, not only requires time, but is a work of great difficulty, and, in this army where there is so little distinction between the officers and soldiers, requires an uncommon degree of attention. To expect then the same service from raw and undisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers, is to expect what never did and perhaps never will happen. Men who are familiarised to danger meet it with∣out shrinking▪ whereas those who have never seen service
<PB N="87" REF="029737_0086_0FE2476D6F8F52D0"/>
often apprehend danger where no danger is. Three things prompt men to a regular discharge of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in time of action—natural bravery, hope of reward, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of pun∣ishment. The two first are common to the untutored and the disciplined soldier: but the latter most obviously dis∣tinguishes the one from the other. A coward, when taught to believe, that, if he breaks his ranks and abandons his colours, he will be punished with death by his own party—will take his chance against the enemy: but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s little of the one▪ and is fearful of the other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from present feelings, regardless of consequences.</P>
<P>Again, men of a day's standing will not look forward: and from experience we find, that, as the time approaches for their discharge, they grow careless of their arms, am∣munition, camp utensils, &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, even the barracks them∣selves have felt uncommon marks of wanton depredation, and lay us under fresh trouble and additional expense in providing for every fresh set, when we find it next to im∣possible to procure such articles as are absolutely necessary in the first instance. To this may be added the seasoning which new recruits must have to a camp, and the loss con∣sequent thereupon. But this is not all. Men, engaged for a short limited time only, have the officers too much in their power: for, to obtain a degree of popularity in order to induce a second enlistment, a kind of familiarity takes place, which brings on a rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion of discipline, unlicens∣ed furloughs, and other indulgences incompatible with order and good government; by which means, the latter part of the time for which the soldier was engaged is spent in undoing what you were aiming to inculcate in the first.</P>
<P>To go into an enumeration of all the evils we have ex∣perienced in this late great change of the army, and the expenses incidental to it—to say nothing of the hazard we have run, and must run, between the discharging of one army and enlistment of another, unless an enormous ex∣pense of militia is incurred—would greatly exceed the bounds of a letter. What I have already taken the liberty of saying will serve to convey a general idea of the matter; and therefore I shall, with all due deference, take the freedom to give it as my opinion, that, if the Congress have any reason to believe that there will be occasion for
<PB N="88" REF="029737_0087_0FE2471CD698B2D0"/>
troops another year, and consequently of another enlist∣ment, they would save money, and have infinitely better troops, if they were, even at a bounty of twenty, thirty, or more dollars, to engage the men already enlisted (till Jan∣uary next) and such others as may be wanted to complete the establishment, for and during the war. I will not un∣dertake to say that the men can be had upon these terms: but I am satisfied that it will never do to let the matter alone, as it was last year, till the time of service was near expiring. The hazard is too great in the first place:—in the next, the trouble and perplexity of disbanding one ar∣my and raising another at the same instant, and in such a critical situation as the last was, is scarcely in the power of words to describe, and such as no man, who has experi∣enced it once, will ever undergo again.</P>
<P>If Congress should differ from me in sentiment upon this point, I have only to beg that they will do me the justice to believe, that I have nothing more in view than what to me appears necessary to advance the public weal, although in the first instance it will be attended with a capital ex∣pense;—and that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the resolves of Congress, I have applied to general Howe for the exchange of Mr. Lovell. A copy of my letter, and his answer thereto, you have inclosed.</P>
<P>Captain Watters and captain Tucker, who command two of the armed schooners, have taken and sent into Gloc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster a large brigantine, laden with wood, a hundred and fifty butts for water, and forty suits of bedding, bound from La Have in Nova-Scotia, for Boston. She is one of the transports in the ministerial service. The captain says that he was at Halifax the seventeenth of January, and that general Massey was arrived there with two regi∣ments from Ireland.</P>
<P>The different prizes were all libelled immediately on the receipt of the resolves of Congress pointing out the mode; but none of them yet brought to trial, owing to a difference be∣tween
<PB N="89" REF="029737_0088_0FE2476EF390AF00"/>
the law passed in this province, and the resolutions of Congress. The general court are making an amendment to their law, by which the difficulties that now occur will be removed, as I understand it is to be made conformable to your resolves. The unavoidable delay attending the bring∣ing the captures to trial is grievously complained of by the masters of these vessels, as well as the captors. Many of the former have applied for liberty to go away without waiting the decision—which I have granted them.</P>
<P>I beg leave to recall the attention of Congress to their appointing a commissary in these parts, to attend the pro∣viding of necessaries for the prisoners who are dispersed in these provinces. Complaints are made by some of them, that they are in want of bedding and many other things. As I understand that Mr. Franks has undertaken that business, I wish he was ordered to send a deputy immedi∣ately to see that the prisoners get what is allowed them by Congress; also to supply the officers with money as they may have occasion. It would save me much time and much trouble.</P>
<P>There are yet but few companies of the militia come in. This delay will, I am much afraid, frustrate the intention of their being called upon, as the season is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lipping fast away when they may be of service.</P>
<P>The demands of the army were so very pressing before your last remittance came to hand, that I was under the necessity of borrowing twenty-five thousand pounds lawful money from this province. They very cheerfully lent it, and passed a vote for as much more, if required. I have not repaid the sum borrowed, as I may stand in need of it before the arrival of another supply, which the demands of the commissary-general, quarter-master-general, and paying off the arrearages, will very soon require.</P>
<P>Your esteemed favour of the twenty-ninth ultimo is just come to hand. It makes me very happy to find my con∣duct to hath met the approbation of Congress. I am entirely of your opinion, that, should an accommodation take place, the terms will be severe or favourable in proportion to our ability to resist, and that we ought to be on a respectable footing to receive their armaments in the spring. But how far we shall be provided with the means, is a matter I pro∣fess
<PB N="90" REF="029737_0089_0FE2471E59E72A20"/>
not to know, under my present unhappy want of arms, ammunition, and,. I may add, men—as our regiments are very incomplete. The recruiting goes on very slow, and will, I apprehend, be more so, if for other service the men receive a bounty, and none is given here.</P>
<P>I have tried every method I could think of, to procure arms for our men. They really are not to be had in these governments (belonging to the public;) and if some meth∣od is not fallen upon, in the southern governments, to supply us, we shall be in a distressed situation for want of them. There are near two thousand men now in camp without firelocks. I have wrote to the committee of New-York this day, requesting them to send me those arms which were taken from the disaffected in that government. The Congress interesting themselves in this request will doubtless have a good effect. I have sent officers into the country, with money to purchase arms in the different towns. Some have returned, and brought in a few:—many are still out:—what their success will be, I cannot determine.</P>
<P>I was in great hopes that the expresses, resolved to be established between this place and Philadelphia, would ere now have been fixed. It would, in my opinion, rather save than increase the expense; as many horses are de∣stroyed by one man coming the whole way. It will cer∣tainly be more expeditious, and safer, than writing by the post or private hands, which I am often under the necessity of doing.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THROUGH you, I beg leave to lay before Con∣gress the inclosed letter from lord Drummond to general Robertson, which came to my hands a few days ago in order to be sent into Boston.</P>
<P>As I never heard of his lordship being vested with pow∣er to treat with Congress upon the subject of our grievances, nor of his having laid any propositions before them for an accommodation, I confess it surprised me much, and led me to form various conjectures of his motives, and intend∣ed application to general Howe and admiral Shuldham for a passport for the safe-conduct of such deputies as Congress might appoint for negociating terms of reconciliation be∣tween Great Britain and us. Whatever his intentions are, however benevolent his designs may be, I confess that his letter has embarrassed me much; and I am not without suspicion of its meaning more than the generous purposes it professes. I should suppose, that, if the mode for negoci∣ation, which he points out, should be adopted (which I hope will never be thought of) it ought to have been fixed and settled previous to any application of this sort; and at best, that his conduct in this instance is premature and of∣ficious, and leading to consequences of a fatal and injurious nature to the rights of this country. His zeal and desire perhaps of an amicable and constitutional adjustment's tak∣ing place may have suggested and precipitated the measure. Be that as it may, I thought it of too much importance, to suffer it to go in without having the express direction of
<PB N="92" REF="029737_0091_0FE2472568D03A18"/>
Congress for that purpose; and that it was my indispensable duty to transmit them the original, to make such interpre∣tations and inferences as they may think right.</P>
<P>Messrs. Willard and Child, who were sent to Nova-Scotia in pursuance of the resolve of Congress, have just returned, and made their report, which I do myself the honour to inclose you. They have not answered the pur∣poses of their commission by any means, as they only went a little way into that country, and found their intelligence upon the information of others. You will see the reasons they assign in excuse or justification of their conduct, in the report itself.</P>
<P>Last night a party of regulars, said to be about five hun∣dred, landed on Dorchester neck, and burned some of the houses there, which were of no value to us; nor would they have been, unless we take post there: they then might be of some service. A detachment went after them as soon as the fire was discovered: but, before it could arrive, they had executed their plan, and made their retreat.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a letter for David Franks, esquire, from Mr. Chamier in Boston, upon the subject of victualling such of the king's troops as may be prisoners within the limits of his contract, which I beg the favour of you to deliver him, and that proper agents may be appointed by him, to see that it is done. I could wish, too, that Congress would fall upon some mode for supplying the officers with such money as they may really stand in need of, and depute proper persons for that purpose, and furnishing the privates with such clothing as may be absolutely necessary. I am appli∣ed to, and wearied by their repeated requests. In some in∣stances I have desired the committees to give the prisoners within their appointments what they should judge absolutely necessary for their support—as the only means in my pow∣er of relieving the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> distress. But I imagine, that, if there were persons to superintend this business, their wants would be better attended to, and many exorbitant charges prevented and saved to the continent; and the whole would then be brought into a proper account.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE late freezing weather having formed some pretty strong ice from Dorchester point to Boston neck, and from Roxbury to the Common, thereby affording a more expanded and consequently a less dangerous ap∣proach to the town, I could not help thinking,—notwith∣standing the militia were not all come in, and we had little or no powder to begin our operation by a regular cannonade or bombardment,—that a bold and resolute a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ault upon the troops in Boston with such men as we had (for it could not take many men to guard our own lines at a time when the enemy were attacked in all quarters) might be crowned with success: and therefore, seeing no certain prospect of a supply of powder on the one hand, and a certain dissolution of the ice on the other, I called the general officers together, for their opinion, agreeably to the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove of Congress, of the twenty-second of De∣cember.</P>
<P>The result will appear in the inclosed council of war; and, being almost unanimous, I must suppose it to be right; although, from a thorough conviction of the necessity of attempting something against the ministerial troops before a reinforcement should arrive, and while we were favoured with the ice, I was not only ready, but willing, and desir∣ous of making the assault, under a firm hope (if the men would have stood by me) of a favourable issue, notwith∣standing the enemy's advantage of ground, artillery, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Perhaps the irksomeness of my situation may have given different ideas to me, than those which influenced the gentlemen I consulted, and might have inclined me to put more to the hazard than was consistent with pru∣dence:—if it had, I am not sensible of it, as I endeavour∣ed to give it all the consideration that a matter of such importance required. True it is, and I cannot help ac∣knowledging, that I have many disagreeable sensations on account of my situation: for, to have the eyes of the whole continent fixed with anxious expectation of hear∣ing of some great event,—and to be restrained in every military operation, for want of the necessary means of carrying it on,—is not very pleasing, especially as the
<PB N="94" REF="029737_0093_0FE2472889FCE668"/>
means used to conceal my weakness from the enemy, conceal it also from our friends, and add to their wonder.</P>
<P>I do not utter this by way of complaint. I am sensible that all that the Congress can do, they have done; and I should feel most powerfully the weight of conscious in∣gratitude were I not to acknowledge this. But as we have accounts of the arrival of powder in captain Mason, I would beg to have it sent on in the most expeditious manner: otherwise we not only lose all chance of the ben∣efits resulting from the season, but of the militia, who are brought in at a most enormous expense, upon a presump∣tion that we should, long ere this, have been amply supplied with powder, under the contracts entered into with the committee of Congress.</P>
<P>The militia, contrary to an express requisition, are come and coming in without ammunition. To supply them alone with twenty-four rounds (which is less, by three fifths, than the regulars are served with) will take between fifty and sixty barrels of powder; and to complete the other troops to the like quantity, will take near as much more, and leave in store not more than about sixty barrels, besides a few rounds of cannon cartridges ready filled for use. This, Sir, Congress may be assured, is a true state of our powder, and will, I hope, bear some testimony of my in∣capacity for action in such a way as may do any essential service.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 21.—When I began this letter, I proposed to have sent it by express. But recollecting that all my late letters have been as expressive of my want of powder and arms as I could paint them, and that Mr. Hooper was to set off in a day or two, I thought it unnecessary to run the continent to the expense of an express, merely to re∣peat what I had so often done before, when I am certain that Congress, knowing our necessities, will delay no time that can possibly be avoided in supplying them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of addressing you on the eigh∣teenth and twenty-first instant, by Mr. Hooper; since which, nothing material has occurred.</P>
<P>We are making every necessary preparation for taking possession of Dorchester heights as soon as possible, with a view of drawing the enemy out. How far our expecta∣tions may be answered, time only can determine: but I should think, if any thing will induce them to hazard an en∣gagement, it will be our attempting to fortify these heights; as, on that event's taking place, we shall be able to com∣mand a great part of the town and almost the whole har∣bour, and to make them rather disagreeable than otherwise, provided we can get a sufficient supply of what we greatly want.</P>
<P>Within these three or four days, I have received sundry accounts from Boston, of such movements there—(such as taking the mortars from Bunker's hill—the putting them, with several pieces of heavy ordnance, on board of ship, with a quantity of bedding—the ships all taking in water—the baking a large quantity of biscuit, &amp;c.)—as to indicate an embarkation of the troops from thence. A Mr. Ides, who came out yesterday, says that the inhabitants of the town generally believe that they are about to remove either to New-York or Virginia, and that every vessel in the har∣bour on Tuesday last was taken up for government's ser∣vice, and two months' pay advanced them. Whether they really intend to embark, or whether the whole is a feint, is impossible for me to tell. However I have thought it expedient to send an express to general Lee, to inform him of it—(in order that he may not be taken by surprise, if their destination should be against New-York)—and con∣tinued him on to you. If they do embark, I think the possessing themselves of that place, and of the North-river, is the object they have in view, thereby securing the com∣munication with Canada, and rendering the intercourse be∣tween
<PB N="96" REF="029737_0095_0FE2472A0C4B2010"/>
the northern and southern United Colonies exceed∣ingly precarious and difficult. To prevent them from ef∣fecting their plan, is a matter of the highest importance, and will require a large and respectable army, and the most vigilant and judicious exertions.</P>
<P>Since I wrote by Mr. Hooper, some small parcels of powder have arrived from Connecticut, which will give us a little assistance.</P>
<P>On Thursday night a party of our men at Roxbury made the enemy's out-centries, consisting of a corporal and two privates, prisoners, without firing a gun or giving the least alarm.</P>
<P>I shall be as attentive to the enemy's motions as I can, and obtain all the intelligence in my power; and, if I find them embark, shall in the most expeditious manner detach a part of the light troops to New-York, and repair thither myself if circumstances shall require it. I shall be better able to judge what to do, when the matter happens. At present, I can only say that I will do every thing that shall appear proper and necessary.</P>
<P>Your letter of the twelfth instant, by colonel Bull, came to hand yesterday evening: and I shall, agreeable to your recommendation, pay proper notice to him. The supply of cash came very seasonably, as our treasury was just ex∣hausted, and nothing can be done here without it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the twenty-sixth ultimo I had the honour of ad∣dressing you, and then mentioned that we were making prep∣arations for taking possession of Dorchester heights. I now beg leave to inform you, that, a council of general officers having determined a previous bombardment and cannonade expedient and proper, in order to harass the enemy and divert their attention from that quarter—on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday nights last, we carried
<PB N="97" REF="029737_0096_0FE2477D22F02EF0"/>
them on from our posts at Coble-hill, Leechmore's-point, and Lam's-dam. Whether they did the enemy any con∣siderable and what injury, I have not yet heard, but have the pleasure to acquaint you that they greatly facilitated our schemes, and would have been attended with success equal to our most sanguine expectations, had it not been for the unlucky bursting of two thirteen, and three ten-inch mortars, among which was the brass one taken in the ord∣nance brig. To what cause to attribute this misfortune, I know not—whether to any defect in them, or to the inex∣perience of the bombardiers. But to return—on Monday evening, as soon as our firing commenced, a considerable detachment of our men, under the command of brigadier-general Thomas, crossed the neck, and took possession of the two hills, without the least interruption or annoyance from the enemy; and by their great activity and industry, before the morning, advanced the works so far as to be se∣cure against their shot. They are now going on with such expedition, that in a little time I hope they will be com∣plete, and enable our troops stationed there to make a vig∣orous and obstinate stand. During the whole cannonade, which was incessant the last two nights, we were fortunate enough to lose but two men—one, a lieutenant, by a can∣non ball's taking off his thigh—the other, a private, by the explosion of a shell, which also slightly wounded four or five more.</P>
<P>Our taking possession of Dorchester heights is only pre∣paratory to taking post on Nuke-hill, and the points oppo∣site the south end of Boston. It was absolutely necessary that they should be previously fortified, in order to cover and command them. As soon as the works on the former are finished and complete, measures will be immediately adopted for securing the latter, and making them as strong and defensible as we can. Their contiguity to the enemy will make them of much importance, and of great service to us.</P>
<P>As mortars are essential, and indispensably necessary for carrying on our operations, and for the prosecution of our plans, I have applied to two furnaces to have some thirteen-inch ones cast with all expedition imaginable, and am en∣couraged to hope, from the accounts I have had, that they
<PB N="98" REF="029737_0097_0FE2472C92CFEB00"/>
will be able to do it. When they are done, and a proper supply of powder obtained, I flatter myself, from the posts we have just taken and are about to take, that it will be in our power to force the ministerial troops to an attack, or to dispose of them in some way that will be of advantage to us. I think from these posts they will be so galled and annoy∣ed, that they must either give us battle or quit their present possessions. I am resolved that nothing on my part shall be wanting, to effect the one or the other.</P>
<P>It having been the general opinion that the enemy would attempt to dislodge our people from the hills, and force their works as soon as they were discovered, which proba∣bly might have brought on a general engagement,—it was thought adviseable that the honourable council should be applied to, to order in the militia from the neighbouring and adjacent towns. I wrote to them on the subject, which they most readily complied with: and, in justice to the militia, I cannot but inform you that they came in at the appointed time, and manifested the greatest alertness, and determined resolution to have acted like men engaged in the cause of freedom.</P>
<P>When the enemy first discovered our works in the morning, they seemed to be in great confusion, and, from their movements, to have intended an attack. It is much to be wished that it had been made: the event, I think, must have been fortunate, and nothing less than success and victory on our side, as our officers and men appeared impatient for the appeal, and to have possessed the most animated sentiments and determined resolution.</P>
<P>On Tuesday evening a considerable number of their troops embarked on board of their transports, and fell down to the castle, where part of them landed before dark. One or two of the vessels got a-ground, and were fired at by our people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> field-piece, but without any dam∣age. What was the design of this embarkation and land∣ing, I have not been able to learn. It would seem as if they meant an attack; for it is most probable, that, if they make one on our works at Dorchester at this time, they will first go to the castle, and come from thence. If such was their design, a violent storm that night, and which lasted till eight o'clock the next day, rendered the exe∣cution
<PB N="99" REF="029737_0098_0FE2478730C66B70"/>
of it impracticable. It carried one or two of their vessels a-shore, which have since got off.</P>
<P>In case the ministerial troops had made an attempt to dislodge our men from Dorchester hills, and the number detached upon the occasion had been so great as to have afforded a probability of a successful attack's being made upon Boston,—on a signal given from Roxbury for that purpose, agreeable to a settled and concerted plan, four thousand chosen men, who were held in readiness, were to have embarked at the mouth of Cambridge river, in two divisions, the first under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan, the second under brigadier-general Greene,—the whole to have been commanded by major-general Putnam. The first division was to land at the powder-house, and gain possession of Beacon-hill and Mount-Horam,—the second at Barton's point or a little south of it, and, after securing that post, to join the other division, and force the enemy's gates and works at the neck, for letting in the Roxbury troops. Three floating batteries were to have preceded, and gone in front of the other boats, and kept up a heavy fire on that part of the town were our men were to land.</P>
<P>How far our views would have succeeded, had an op∣portunity offered for attempting the execution, is impossi∣ble for me to say; nothing less than experiment could determine with precision. The plan was thought to be well digested; and, as far as I could judge from the cheer∣fulness and alacrity which distinguished the officers and men who were to engage in the enterprise, I had reason to hope for a favourable and happy issue.</P>
<P>The militia who were ordered in from the adjacent towns brought with them three days' provision. They were only called upon to act under the idea of an attack's being immediately made, and were all discharged this afternoon.</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind Congress that three major-gen∣erals are essential and necessary for this army; and that by general Lee's being called from hence to the command in Canada, the left division is without one. I hope they will fill up the vacancy by the appointment of another. General Thomas is the first brigadier, stands fair in point

of reputation, and is esteemed a brave and good officer. If he is promoted, there will be a vacancy in the briga∣dier-generals, which it will be necessary to supply by the appointment of some other gentleman that shall be agreea∣ble to Congress: but justice requires me to mention that William Thompson, esquire, of the rifle regiment, is the first colonel in this department, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, is a good officer and a man of courage. What I have said of these two gentlemen, I conceived to be my duty, at the same time acknowledg∣ing, whatever promotions are made will be satisfactory to me.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.—Yesterday evening, a captain Irvine, who escaped from Boston the night before with six of his crew, came to head-quarters, and gave the following intelligence:—"That our bombardment and cannonade caused a great deal of surprise and alarm in town, as many of the soldiery said they never heard or thought we had mortars of shells;—that several of the officers acknowledg∣ed they were well and properly directed; that they made much distress and confusion;—that the cannon-shot, for the greatest part, went through the houses; and he was told that one took off the legs and arms of six men lying in the barracks on the neck;—that a soldier, who came from the lines there on Tuesday morning, informed him that twenty men had been wounded the night before:—(it was reported that others were also hurt, and one of the light-horse torn to pieces by the explosion of a shell: this was afterwards contradicted)—that, early on Tuesday morning, admiral Shuldham, discovering the works our people were throwing up on Dorchester heights, imme∣diately sent an express to general Howe, to inform him that it was necessary they should be attacked and dislodged from thence, or he would be under the necessity of with∣drawing the ships from the harbour, which were under his command;—that preparations were directly made for that purpose, as it was said; and, from twelve to two o'clock, about three thousand men embarked on board the trans∣ports, which fell down to the castle with a design of land∣ing on that part of Dorchester next to it, and attacking our works on the heights at five o'clock next morning;—
<PB N="101" REF="029737_0100_0FE247D196A4A950"/>
that lord Percy was appointed to command;—that it was generally believed the attempt would have been made, had it not been for the violent storm which happened that night, as I have mentioned before;—that he heard several of the privates, and one or two serjeants, say as they were embarking, that it would be another Bunker's-hill affair."</P>
<P>He further informs—"that the army is preparing to leave Boston, and that they will do it in a day or two;—that the transports necessary for their embarkation were getting ready with the utmost expedition;—that there had been great movements and confusion among the troops, the night and day preceding his coming out, in hurrying down their cannon, artillery and other stores, to the wharfs, with the utmost precipitation; and they were putting them on board the ships in such haste, that no account or memoran∣dum was taken of them;—that most of the cannon were removed from their works, and embarked or embarking;—that he heard a woman say, whom he took to be an officer's wife, that she had seen men go under the ground at the lines on the neck, without returning;—that the ship he commanded was taken up, places fitted, and fitting, for of∣ficers to lodge, and several shot, shells, and cannon already on board;—that the tories were to have the liberty of go∣ing where they please, if they can get seamen to man the vessels, of whom there was a great scarcity;—that, on that account, many vessels could not be carried away, and would be burned;—that many of the inhabitants apprehended the town would be destroyed; and that it was generally thought their destination is Halifax."</P>
<P>The account given by captain Irvine, as to the embark∣ation, and their being about to leave the town, I believe true. There are other circumstances corroborating; and it seems fully confirmed by a paper signed by four of the selectmen of the town, (a copy of which I have the hon∣our to inclose you) which was brought out yesterday even∣ing by a flag, and delivered to colonel Learned, by major Basset of the tenth regiment, who desired it might be deliv∣ered me as soon as possible. I advised with such of the general officers upon the occasion as I could immediately assemble; and we determined it right (as it was not ad∣dressed to me or any one else, nor authenticated by the
<PB N="102" REF="029737_0101_0FE1BFA64F880F18"/>
signature of general Howe, or any other act obliging him to a performance of the promise mentioned on his part) that I should give it no answer; at the same time, that a letter should be returned, as going from colonel Learned, signifying his having laid it before me,—with the reasons assigned for not answering it. A copy of this is sent.</P>
<P>To-night I shall have a battery thrown up on Nuke-hill (Dorchester point) with a design of acting as circumstances may require; it being judged adviseable to prosecute our plans of fortification, as we intended before this informa∣tion from the selectmen came.</P>
<P>It being agreed on all hands that there is no possibility of stopping them in case they determine to go,—I shall order look-outs to be kept upon all the head-lands, to dis∣cover their movements and course, and moreover direct commodore Manly and his little squadron to dog them, as well for the same purpose as for picking up any of their vessels that may chance to depart their convoy. From their loading with such precipitancy, it is presumable they will not be in the best condition for sea.</P>
<P>If the ministerial troops evacuate the town and leave it standing, I have thoughts of taking measures for fortifying the entrance into the harbour, if it shall be thought proper, and the situation of affairs will admit of it.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the report from Boston that Halifax is the place of their destination, I have no doubt but that they are going to the southward of this,—and, I appre∣hend, to New-York. Many reasons lead to this opinion: it is in some measure corroborated by their sending an ex∣press ship there, which, on Wednesday week, got on shore and bilged at Cape-Cod. The dispatches, if written, were destroyed when she was boarded. She had a parcel of coal, and about four thousand cannon-shot, six carriage-guns, a swivel or two, and three barrels of powder.</P>
<P>I shall hold the riflemen and other parts of our troops in readiness to march at a moment's warning, and govern my movements by the events that happen, or such orders as I may receive from Congress, which I beg may be am∣ple, and forwarded with all possible expedition.</P>
<P>On the sixth instant, a ship bound from London, with stores for the ministerial army, consisting of coal, porter,
<PB N="103" REF="029737_0102_0FE247DC1056A1E8"/>
and krout, fell in with our armed vessels, four of them in company, and was carried into Portsmouth. She had had a long passage, and of course brought no papers of a late date. The only letters of importance, or in the least interesting that were found, I have inclosed.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congress that money is much wanted. The militia from these governments, engaged till the first of April, are then to be paid: and, if we march from hence, the expense will be very considerable, must be defrayed, and cannot be accomplished without it. The necessity of making the earliest remittance for these purposes is too obvious for me to add more.</P>
<P>When I wrote that part of this letter which is antece∣dent to this date, I fully expected it would have gone be∣fore now by colonel Bull, not deeming it of sufficient importance to send a special messenger. But he deferred his return from time to time, and never set off till to-day. These reasons I hope will excuse the delay, and be re∣ceived as a proper apology for not transmitting it sooner.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of the seventh and ninth instant which I had the honour of addressing you, I mentioned the in∣telligence I had received respecting the embarkation of the troops from Boston; and fully expected, before this, that the town would have been entirely evacuated. Al∣though I have been deceived, and was rather premature in the opinion I had then formed, I have little reason to doubt but the event will take place in a very short time, as other accounts which have come to hand since, of the sailing of a great number of transports from the har∣bour to Nantasket-road, and many circumstances corres∣ponding therewith, seem to confirm and render it un∣questionable.</P>
<P>Whether the town will be destroyed, is a matter of much uncertainty: but it would seem, from the destruc∣tion they are making of sundry pieces of furniture, of many of their waggons, carts, &amp;c. which they cannot take
<PB N="104" REF="029737_0103_0FE1BFB364DACC98"/>
with them as it is said, that it will not: for, if they in∣tended it, the whole might be involved in one general ruin.</P>
<P>Holding it of the last importance in the present contest that we should secure New-York, and prevent the enemy from possessing it,—and conjecturing they have views of that sort, and their embarkation to be for that purpose,—I judged it necessary, under the situation of things here, to call a council of general officers to consult of such measures as might be expedient to be taken at this inter∣esting conjuncture of affairs. A copy of the proceedings I have the honour to inclose you.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the opinion of the council, I shall detach the rifle regiment to-morrow, under the command of brig∣adier-general Sullivan, with orders to repair to New-York with all possible expedition;—which will be suc∣ceeded, the day after, by the other five in one brigade,—they being all that it was thought adviseable to send from hence till the enemy shall have quitted the town. Imme∣diately upon their departure, I shall send forward major-general Putnam, and follow myself with the remainder of the army as soon as I have it in my power,—leaving here such a number of men as circumstances may seem to require.</P>
<P>As the badness of the roads at this season will greatly retard the march of our men, I have, by advice of the gen∣eral officers, wrote to governor Trumbull by this express, to use his utmost exertions for throwing a reinforcement, of two thousand men into New-York, from the western parts of Connecticut,—and to the commanding officer there, to apply to the provincial convention or committee of safety of New-Jersey, for a thousand more for the same purpose, to oppose the enemy and prevent their getting possession in case they arrive before the troops from hence can get there; of which there is a probability, unless they are impeded by contrary winds. This measure, though it may be attended with considerable expense, I flatter myself, will meet with the approbation of Congress. Past experience, and the lines in Boston and on Boston neck, point out the propriety, and suggest the necessity of keep∣ing
<PB N="105" REF="029737_0104_0FE247DD946A8830"/>
our enemies from gaining possession and making a lodgement.</P>
<P>Should their destination be further southward, or for Halifax (as reported in Boston) for the purpose of going into Canada,—the march of our troops to New-York will place them nearer the scene of action, and more convenie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for affording succours.</P>
<P>We have not taken post on Nuke-hill, and fortified it, as mentioned that we should, in my last. On hearing that the enemy were about to retreat and leave the town, it was thought imprudent and unadviseable to force them with too much precipitation, that we might gain a little time, and prepare for a march. To-morrow evening we shall take possession, unless they are gone.</P>
<P>As New-York is of such importance, prudence and policy require that every precaution that can be devised should be adopted, to frustrate the designs which the ene∣my have of possessing it. To this end I have ordered ves∣sels to be provided and held ready at Norwich, for the embarkation and transportation of our troops thither. This I have done with a view not only of greatly expedit∣ing their arrival, (as it will save several days marching) but also that they may be fresh and sit for intrenching and throwing up works of defence as soon as they get there, if they do not meet the enemy to contend with:—for nei∣ther of which would they be in a proper condition after a long and fatiguing march in bad roads. If Wallace, with his ships, should be apprised of the measure, and at∣tempt to prevent it by stopping up the harbour of New-London, they can but pursue their march by land.</P>
<P>You will please to observe that it is the opinion of the general officers, if the enemy abandon the town, that it will be unnecessary to employ or keep any part of this ar∣my for its defence; and that I have mentioned, on that event's happening, I shall immediately repair to New-York with the remainder of the army not now detached, leaving only such a number of men here as circumstances may seem to require. What I partly allude to, is, that, as it will take a considerable time for the removal of such a body of men, and the divisions must precede each other in such order as to allow intermediate time sufficient for
<PB N="106" REF="029737_0105_0FE24788B4039510"/>
them to be covered and provided for, and many things done previous to the march of the whole, for securing and forwarding such necessaries as cannot be immediately car∣ried, and others which it may be proper to keep here,—that directions might be received from Congress respecting the same, and as many men ordered to remain for that and other purposes, as they may judge proper. I could wish to have their commands upon the subject, and in time; as I may be under some degree of embarrassment as to their views.</P>
<P>Congress having been pleased to appoint colonel Thompson a brigadier-general, there is a vacancy for a colonel in the regiment he commanded, to which I would beg leave to recommend the lieutenant-colonel Hand. I shall also take the liberty of recommending captain Hugh Stephenson, of the Virginia riflemen, to succeed colonel Hand, and to be appointed in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as lieuten∣ant-colonel,—there being no major to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egiment since the promotion of major Magaw to be lieutenant-colonel of one of the Pennsylvania battalions, and who is gone from hence. He is, in my opinion, the fittest person in this army for it, as well as the oldest captain in the service, having distinguished himself at the head of a rifle company all the last war, and highly merited the approbation of his superior officers.</P>
<P>Colonel Mifflin informed me to-day of his having re∣ceived tent-cloths from Mr. Barrell, of Philadelphia, to the amount of seven thousand five hundred pounds Penn∣sylvania currency, and applied for a warrant for payment of it. But, as our fund is low, and many necessary de∣mands against it which must be satisfied,—and our calls for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oney are and will be exceedingly great,—I could not gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt it, thinking it might be convenient for payment to be made in Philadelphia, by your order on the treasury there.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with the greatest pleasure I inform you, that, on Sunday last, the seventeenth instant, about nine o'clock in
<PB N="107" REF="029737_0106_0FE247DF188C5CE0"/>
the forenoon, the ministerial army evacuated the town of Boston, and that the forces of the United Colonies are now in actual possession thereof. I beg leave to congratu∣late you, Sir, and the honorable Congress, on this happy event, and particularly as it was effected without endanger∣ing the lives and property of the remaining unhappy inhab∣itants.</P>
<P>I have great reason to imagine their flight was precipitat∣ed by the appearance of a work which I had ordered to be thrown up last Saturday night on an eminence at Dorches∣ter which lay nearest to Boston neck, called Nuke-hill.</P>
<P>The town, although it has suffered greatly, is not in so bad a state as I expected to find it; and I have a particu∣lar pleasure in being able to inform you, Sir, that your house has received no damage worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order, and the family pictures are all left en∣tire and untouched. Captain Cazneau takes charge of the whole, until he shall receive further orders from you.</P>
<P>As soon as the ministerial troops had quitted the town, I ordered a thousand men, (who had had the small-pox) under command of general Putnam, to take possession of the heights, which I shall endeavour to fortify in such a man∣ner as to prevent their return, should they attempt it. But, as they are still in the harbour, I thought it not prudent to march off with the main body of the army until I should be fully satisfied they had quitted the coast. I have there∣fore only detached five regiments, besides the rifle battal∣ion, to New-York, and shall keep the remainder here till all suspicion of their return ceases.</P>
<P>The situation in which I found their works evidently discovered that their retreat was made with the greatest precipitation. They have left their barracks and other works of wood at Bunker's hill, &amp;c. all standing, and have destroyed but a small part of their lines. They have also left a number o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine pieces of cannon, which they first spiked up, also a very large iron mortar; and, as I am in∣formed, they have thrown another over the end of your wharf. I have employed proper persons to drill the can∣non, and doubt not I shall save the most of them.—I am not yet able to procure an exact list of all the stores they have left. As soon as it can be done, I shall take care to
<PB N="108" REF="029737_0107_0FE2478A3B1F3548"/>
transmit it to you.—From an estimate of what the quar∣ter-master-general has already discovered, the amount will be twenty-five or thirty thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the sixth in∣stant has already arrived. The remainder I have ordered to be stopped on the road, as we shall have no occasion for it here. The letter to general Thomas, I immediately sent to him. He desired leave for three or four days, to settle some of his private affairs; after which, he will set out for his command in Canada. I am happy that my conduct in intercepting lord Drummond's letter is approved of by Congress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour to address you on the nineteenth instant upon the evacuation of the town of Bos∣ton by the ministerial army, I fully expected, as their re∣treat and embarkation were hurried and precipitate, that, before now, they would have departed the harbour, and been far in their passage to the place of destination. But, to my surprise and disappointment, the fleet is still in Nantas∣ket-road. The purpose inducing their stay is altogether unknown; nor can I suggest any satisfactory reason for it. On Wednesday night last, before the whole of the fleet fell down to Nantasket, they demolished the castle and houses belonging to it, by burning them down, and the several for∣tifications. They left a great number of the cannon, but have rendered all of them, except a very few, entirely use∣less, by breaking off the trunnions; and those they spiked up: but they may be made serviceable again:—some are already done.</P>
<P>There are several vessels in the docks, which were taken by the enemy (some with and others without cargoes,) which different persons claim as their property and right. Are they to be restored to their former owners on making proof of their title, or to belong to the continent, as captures made from the enemy?—I wish Congress would direct a mode of proceeding against them, and establish a rule for
<PB N="109" REF="029737_0108_0FE247E0B868CBC0"/>
decision: they appear to me to be highly necessary. In like manner, some of the cannon which are in Boston are said to have come from the castle. Supposing them, with those remaining at the castle, to have been purchased by and pro∣vided originally at the expense of this province,—are they now to be considered as belonging to it, or to the public? I beg leave to refer the matter to the opinion of Congress, and pray their direction how I am to conduct respecting them.</P>
<P>It having been suggested to me that there was consider∣able property, &amp;c. belonging to persons who had, from the first of the present unhappy contest, manifested an unfriend∣ly and invetera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e disposition, in the town of Boston, I thought it prudent to write to the honourable General Court upon the subject, that it might be inquired after and secured. A copy of the letter I herewith send you, and submit it to Congress, through you, whether they will not determine how it is to be disposed of, and as to the appropriation of the money arising from the sale of the same.</P>
<P>As soon as the town was abandoned by the enemy, I judged it adviseable to secure the several heights, lest they should attempt to return: and, for this purpose, have caus∣ed a large and strong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> be thrown up on Fort-hill, a post of great importance, as it commands the whole harbour, and, when fortified, if properly supported, will greatly an∣noy any fleet the enemy may send against the town, and render the landing of their troops exceedingly difficult, if not impracticable. This work is almost done, and in a little time will be complete: and, that the communication between the town and country may be free and open, I have ordered all the lines upon the neck to be immediately de∣stroyed, and the other works on the sides of the town facing the country, that the inhabitants from the latter may not be impeded, and afforded an easy entrance, in case the enemy should gain possession at any future time. These matters I conceived to be within the line of my duty; of which I advised the General Court, and recommended to their attention such other measures as they might think necessary for securing the town against the hostile designs of the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="029737_0109_0FE2478BC49FE620"/>
I have just got an inventory of stores and property be∣longing to the crown, which the enemy left in Boston, at the castle, and Bunker's-hill,—which I have the honour to transmit you; and shall give strict orders that a careful attention be had to any more that may be found. I shall take such precautions respecting them, that they may be se∣cure, and turn to the public advantage, as much as possible, or circumstances will admit of.</P>
<P>A Mr. Bulfinch from Boston, who acted as clerk to Mr. * * *, having put into my hands a list of rations drawn the Saturday before the troops evacuated the town, I have inclosed it for your inspection. He says, neither the staff officers nor women are included in the list; from which it appears that their number is greater than we had an idea of.</P>
<P>Major-general Ward and brigadier-general Frye are de∣sirous of leaving the service; and, for that purpose, have requested me to lay the matter before Congress, that they may be allowed to resign their commissions. The papers containing their applications you will herewith receive. They will give you a full and more particular information upon the subject; and therefore I shall take the liberty of referring you to them.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congress that the commissary of artillery stores has informed me, that whatever powder has been sent to this camp has always come without any bill ascertaining the number of casks or quantity. This, it is probable, has proceeded from forgetfulness or inattention in the persons appointed to send it, or the negligence of those who brought it, though they have declared otherwise, and that they never had any. As it may in some measure prevent embezzlements, (though I do not suspect any to have been made) and the commissary will know what and how much to receive, and be enabled to discover mistakes if any should happen,—I should be glad if you will direct a bill of parcels to be always sent in future.</P>
<P>There have been so many accounts from England, all agreeing that commissioners are coming to America, to propose terms for an accommodation, as they say,—that I am inclined to think the time of their arrival not very far off. If they come to Boston, (which probably will be the
<PB N="111" REF="029737_0110_0FE247EB0E3D7E18"/>
case if they come to America at all) I shall be under much embarrassment respecting the manner of receiving them, and the mode of treatment that ought to be used. I there∣fore pray that Congress will give me directions, and point out the line of conduct to be pursued—whether they are to be considered as ambassadors, and to have a pass or per∣mit for repairing through the country to Philadelphia or to any other place—or whether they are to be restrained in any and what manner. I shall anxiously wait their orders, and, whatever they are, comply with them literally.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your favour of the eleventh instant by Saturday night's post, and must beg pardon for not ac∣knowledging it in my last of the twenty-fourth. The hur∣ry I was then in occasioned the neglect, and I hope will apologize for it.</P>
<P>I now beg leave to inform you that I have just received intelligence, that the whole of the ministerial fleet, besides three or four ships, got under way this evening at Nantas∣ket-road, and were standing out for sea: in consequence of which, I shall detach a brigade of six regiments immedi∣ately from hence for New-York, under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan (brigadier-general Heath having gone with the first) which will be succeeded by another in a day or two; and directly after, I shall forward the re∣mainder of the army (except four or five regiments which will be left for taking care of the barracks and public stores, and fortifying the town, and erecting such works for its defence as the honourable General Court may think neces∣sary)—and follow myself.</P>
<P>Apprehending that general Thomas will stand in need of some artillerists in Canada, I have ordered two com∣panies of the train to march immediately; and two mor∣tars, with a quantity of shells and shot, to be sent him. He set out on the twenty-first instant.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have a copy of the return of ordnance stores left in Boston by the enemy. In it are not included
<PB N="112" REF="029737_0111_0FE247945C0E5B98"/>
the cannon left at the castle, amounting to a hundred and thirty-five pieces, as reported, all of which, except a very few, they have destroyed and rendered useless, by knock∣ing off the trunnions, and spiking up.</P>
<P>I beg leave to transmit you the copy of a petition from the inhabitants of Nova-Scotia, brought me by * * *, es∣quire, mentioned therein, who is now here with an Acadian. From this it appears they are in a distressed situation; and, from Mr. * * *'s account, are exceedingly apprehensive that they will be reduced to the disagreeable alternative of taking up arms and joining our enemies, or to flee their country, unless they can be protected against their insults and oppressions. He says that their committees think ma∣ny salutary and valuable consequences would be derived from five or six hundred men being sent there, as it would not only quiet the minds of the people from the anxiety and uneasiness they are now filled with, and enable them to take a part in behalf of the colonies, but be the means of preventing the Indians (of whom there are a good many) from taking the side of government, and the ministerial troops from getting such supplies of provisions from thence as they have done.</P>
<P>How far these good purposes would be answered if such a force was sent as they ask for, is impossible to determine in the present uncertain state of things. For, if the army from Boston is going to Halifax (as reported by them be∣fore their departure) that or a much more considerable force would be of no avail: if not, and they possess the friendly disposition to our cause, suggested in the petition and declared by Mr. * * *, it might be of great service, unless another body of troops should be sent thither by ad∣ministration, too powerful for them to oppose. It being a matter of some importance, I judged it prudent to lay it before Congress for their consideration; and requesting their direction upon the subject, shall only add, if they de∣termine to adopt it, that they will prescribe the number to be sent, and whether it is to be from the regiments which will be left here. I shall wait their decision, and, what∣ever it is, will endeavour to have it carried into execution.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN express arrived this morning with a letter from governor Cooke of Rhode-Island, of which the inclosed is a copy. In consequence of this important intelligence, I immediately dispatched an express after general Sullivan who is on his march to Norwich with six regiments, and ordered him to file off to Providence, if he should be so desired by governor Cooke, to whom I have wrote on the subject.</P>
<P>General Greene was to have marched this morning with five more regiments, by way of Providence. I have order∣ed him to hasten his march for that place; and hope to collect a force there, sufficient to prevent the enemy from effecting their purpose.</P>
<P>Whether this movement be only a feint to draw our at∣tention from their principal object, or not, is at present im∣possible to determine. I momently expect further intel∣ligence from governor Cooke. If the alarm should be well grounded, I shall hasten to Providence, and make the necessary dispositions for their reception. I beg you to as∣sure the honourable Congress I shall exert myself to the at∣most to frustrate the designs of the enemy.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured with your favours of the twenty-first and twenty-fifth ultimo, on the second instant,—the former by Mr. Hanson, &amp;c. the latter by Fessenden. I heartily wish the money had arrived sooner, that the militia might have been paid as soon as their time of service ex∣pired. The disappointment has given them great uneasi∣ness, and they are gone home much dissatisfied: nor have I been without severe complaints from the other troops on the same account. When I get to New-York, I hope a sufficient sum will be there, ready to pay every claim.</P>
<P>It is not in my power to make report of the deficie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of arms in compliance with the direction of Congress at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time, as some of the regiments are at, and most of the oth∣ers on their march to New-York; nor do I know that is would answer any good purpose, if it were,—having made repeated applications to the several assemblies and conven∣tions upon the subject, and constantly received for answer, that they could afford no relief.</P>
<P>When I arrive at New-York, I shall, in pursuance of the order of Congress, detach four battalions to Canada, if the situation of affairs will admit of it; and shall be ex∣tremely happy if they and the troops already there can ef∣fect the important end of their going.</P>
<P>In my letter of the first instant, per post, I inclosed you a copy of a letter from governor Cooke, advising me of the arrival of a ship of war, &amp;c. at and near the harbour of Newport. I have now the pleasure to inform you that the report was entirely premature, and without any foundation. You have a copy of his letter of the first instant to this effect. I wish the alarm had never been given: it occasioned general Sullivan and his brigade to make an unnecessary and inconvenient diversion from their route.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a copy of an account, presented by the honourable General Court, of powder furnished the conti∣nental army by this colony. From the account, it ap∣pears that part of it was supplied before the army was un∣der my command; and therefore I know nothing of it; but have not the smallest doubt of the justice of the charge.
<PB N="115" REF="029737_0114_0FE247EE51FBAEF8"/>
I shall leave about two hundred barrels of this article with major-general Ward, out of which Congress will direct him to make a return, if they think proper,—and also repayment of what may have been furnished by the other governments.</P>
<P>A proclamation of general Howe's, issued a few days before his departure from town, having fallen into my hands, I have inclosed you a copy, which may probably have been the occasion of large quantities of goods being carried away, and the removal of many persons, which otherwise would not have happened.</P>
<P>Colonel Warren, pay-master-general, finding the army likely to be removed from hence, informed me the other day that the situation of his affairs and engagements in the business of the colony are such, as to prevent him from personally attending the army; and offered, in case it should be required, to resign. This was rather embarras∣sing. To me it appears indispensably necessary that the pay-master-general, with his books, should be at or near head-quarters. Indeed it is usual for the head of every department in the army, however dispersed tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> army may be, to be with the commanding general, keeping deputies in the smaller departments. On the other hand, colonel Warren's merit and attachment to the cause are such, that I could do nothing less than desire, (as some money must be left for the pay and contingent charges of the army which will remain here) he would wait here till Congress shall be pleased to give their sentiments upon the matter—sending in the mean time some person in whom he could confide, with the money, but little of which there will be to carry, though great the demands, as nine of the regi∣ments which have marched to New-York have only re∣ceived five hundred pounds each, towards their pay for the months of February and March—and six others, not a farthing. I hope therefore this matter will be consider∣ed by Congress, and the result transmitted me as soon as done.</P>
<P>I would also mention to Congress, that the militia regi∣ments which were last called upon, in making up their ab∣stracts, charged pay—the officers, from the time they re∣ceived orders to raise companies—and the privates, from
<PB N="116" REF="029737_0115_0FE24797CD41A570"/>
the time they respectively engaged to come or were call∣ed upon, though they did not march for a considerable time after—some not within three, four, to twenty days, during all which, they remained at home about their own private affairs, without doing any thing else than "prepar∣ing for the march," as they say by way of plea. This appeared to me so exceedingly unreasonable, and so con∣trary to justice, that the public should pay for a longer time than from the day of their march to that of their return, that I ordered the abstracts to be made out accordingly, and refused to give warrants on any other terms. They say that the enlisting orders, which went out from their governments, give them the pay they claim. The fact may be that something in these may seem to authorize it: but I must submit it to Congress, and wish for their deci∣sion, whether the continent must pay it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to inform you that on the fourth instant I set out from Cambridge, and arrived here on Saturday last. I came through Providence, Norwich, and New-London, in order to see and expedite the embarkation of the troops. The third brigade, under the command of general Greene, was at New-London when I left it, where there was a sufficient number of transports to embark them—and most probably would have arrived here before this, had it not been for a severe storm which happened the night they sailed, which dispersed them, and, I fear, has done them some injury.</P>
<P>General Spencer, with the last brigade, marched from Roxbury the day I left Cambridge, and would be at New-London, ready to embark in the return transports which brought general Sullivan's division to this place. The whole of the troops may be reasonably expected here in the course of this week. The badness of the roads, and difficulty of procuring teams for bringing the stores, bag∣gage, &amp;c. have greatly prolonged their arrival at this place.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="029737_0116_0FE247F0DD4291F0"/>
I have not had time, since I came, to look fully about me; but find many works of defence begun, and some finished. The troops are much dispersed—some on Long-Island, others on Staten-Island, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have ordered four battalions from hence to Canada, and am taking measures to have them forwarded to Albany, by water, with all possible expedition. This will greatly expedite their arrival, and ease the men of much fatigue. I have wrote general Schuyler of their coming, that he may have necessary measures taken to hurry their march to general Thomas.</P>
<P>I am informed by general Putnam that the militia, that were called in for the support of this town in case the ministerial army had arrived before our troops, are all dis∣charged, it being unnecessary to keep them longer.</P>
<P>All the ships of war, besides the Asia moved out of this harbour on Saturday, and the Asia yesterday; some of which are now below the Narrows, and the rest gone to sea.</P>
<P>Your favour of the tenth instant, by major Sherburne, directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer here, came to hand on Saturday evening, with three boxes of money, which I shall deliver the pay-master as soon as he arrives, and transmit you his receipt for the same.</P>
<P>Having received information from hence before my de∣parture from Camb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dge, that thirty pieces of heavy can∣non were wanting, and essentially necessary for the defence of this place, in addition to those already here—I took the liberty of applying to admiral Hopkins, whom I saw at New-London, for that number, with the mortars and stores he brought from Providence,—a list of which he had transmitted you. He told me, that, as many were wanting for the defence of Providence river and the harbour at New-London, it was uncertain whether I could have all I wanted; but that he would send me all that could be spared.</P>
<P>I have not been able to get a return of the troops since I came:—as soon as I do, I will send it you.</P>

<P>Agreeable to your request, I have communicated, in general orders, to the officers and soldiers under my com∣mand, the thanks of Congress for their good behaviour in the service; and am happy in having such an opportunity of doing justice to their merit. They were indeed, at first, <HI>"a band of undisciplined husbandmen:"</HI> but it is (under God) to their bravery and attention to their duty that I am indebted for that success which has procured me the only reward I wish to receive—the affection and esteem of my countrymen.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment received a letter from gen∣eral Schuyler, containing inclosures of a very important nature, copies of which, I imagine, are contained in the inclosed letter to you, which I thought it my duty imme∣diately to forward by express, that they may be laid before the honourable Congress, and proper measures pursued to prevent the fatal effects which are therein apprehended. For my own part, I have done my utmost to forward the four
<PB N="119" REF="029737_0118_0FE247F9EC266228"/>
regiments ordered by Congress: but a variety of incidents have hitherto conspired to prevent their embarkation. The men had scarcely recovered themselves from the fa∣tigues of their march from Boston, and are quite unpro∣vided with necessaries. The colonels of the regiments, though repeatedly called upon for that purpose, had neg∣lected making out the abstracts for their pay. All obsta∣cles however are now removed; and I hope to begin the embarkation this day. Indeed it would have been best, in my opinion, to have sent the regiments, raised in this province and New-Jersey, upon that service, had not the peculiar circumstances under which they were raised pre∣vented it. By the terms of their enlistment, they are to serve during the war, and at five dollars per month, on condition (as I am informed) that they shall not be sent out of those provinces. Besides, they are very ill provid∣ed with arms, some companies not having any. It must be a great burden upon the continent to keep such a num∣ber of useless men in pay: and yet, if they should be dis∣missed, and an unexpected supply of arms should arrive, it may be found very difficult to replace them.</P>
<P>The officers of the several corps that have arrived here have been so busily employed in fixing their men in quar∣ters, that I have not yet been able to procure an exact return of their numbers. Some are yet behind. As soon as the whole are collected, I shall order the proper returns, and transmit them to Congress.</P>
<P>You will please to notice what colonel Hazen says of the disposition of the Indians. In my opinion, it will be impossible to keep them in a state of neutrality. They must, and, no doubt, soon will take an active part either for or against us: and I submit it to the consideration of Congress, whether it would not be best immediately to engage them on our side, and to use our utmost endeav∣ours to prevent their minds being poisoned by ministerial emissaries, which will ever be the case while a king's gar∣rison is suffered to remain in their country. Would it not therefore be adviseable to send a sufficient force from the back counties of Pennsylvania, to take possession of the garrisons of Niagara and Detroit? This, I think, might easily be effected, and would answer the most salutary
<PB N="120" REF="029737_0119_0FE247A28BF318E8"/>
purposes. The Seneca Indians, who have hitherto ap∣peared friendly to us, might be usefully employed in this business.</P>
<P>I am in hopes most of the difficulties mentioned in colonel Hazen's letter will be obviated by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he appearance of the respectable committee of Congress in Canada, and the forces that have been and will be sent there. The security of that country is of the utmost importance to us. This cannot be done so effectually by conquest▪ as by taking strong hold of the affections and confidence of the inhabitants. It is to be lamented that any conduct of the continental troops should tend to alienate their affec∣tions from us.</P>
<P>The honourable Congress will be able to judge from the papers sent them by general Schuyler, and the in∣formation they may receive of the designs of the enemy, whether it is expedient to send a further reinforcement to Canada. If such should be their determination, I stand ready to execute their orders; and am, with respect, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this day honoured with the receipt of your favour of the twentieth instant. I have now the pleasure to acquaint you that the four regiments designed for Can∣ada embarked yesterday with a fair wind for Albany, un∣der the command of colonels Greaton, Patterson, Bond, and Poor; besides which there was a company of riflemen, a company of artificers, and two engineers,—the whole commanded by brigadier-general Thompson.</P>
<P>I have repeatedly mentioned to the honourable Con∣gress the distressful situation we are in for want of arms. With much pains and difficulty I got most of the regi∣ments from the eastward tolerably well furnished; but find the York regiments very badly provided. Colonel Ritze∣ma's
<PB N="121" REF="029737_0120_0FE247FB91BD59F0"/>
has scarcely any: and yet these men, being enlisted during the war, and at five dollars per month, ought not (in my judgment) to be discharged; as we find it almost as difficult to get men, as arms. This is a matter of some importance, which I should be glad to receive the particu∣lar opinion of Congress upon.</P>
<P>Mr. Baldwin is one of the assistant engineers ordered to Canada. He is indeed a very useful man in his department, but declined the service on account of his pay, which he says is inadequate to his support. In order to induce him to continue, I promised to represent his case to Congress; and would recommend an increase of his pay, and that he should have the rank of lieutenant-colonel, of which he is very deserving. I beg leave therefore to recommend him to the Congress, and that they would make provision for him accordingly.</P>
<P>A few days ago, application was made to me by the com∣mittee of safety for this colony, for an exchange of prison∣ers. For the particulars I beg leave to refer you to their letter, a copy of which you have inclosed. As there is a standing order of Congress that no sailors or soldiers shall be exchanged for citizens, I did not incline to comply with the request without the particular direction of Congress: but I have been since informed that the prisoners, mention∣ed in the committee's letter as citizens, are really seamen taken from private vessels, but not in arms. How far this may alter the case, or how far the reasons which induc∣ed the Congress to pass the resolve above-mentioned may still exist, must be left to their determination.</P>
<P>The militia, who, on my application, were ordered to this place to keep possession until I should arrive with the continental forces, were obliged to return home without their pay, as there was not then money sufficient in the treasury for that purpose, and to answer the exigencies of the army. This occasioned great uneasiness among them, and may be attended with very bad consequences in case we should have occasion for their service on any future emergency. I therefore beg the Congress would make pro∣vision for their pay, and point out particularly whether it is to be done by the commander of the continental forces,
<PB N="122" REF="029737_0121_0FE247A40F2F4888"/>
or by the provincial assemblies or conventions from whence they are sent.</P>
<P>As the time for which the riflemen enlisted will expire on the first of July next, and as the loss of such a valuable and brave body of men will be of great, injury to the service, I would submit it to the consideration of Congress, whether it would not be best to adopt some method to induce them to continue. They are indeed a very useful corps: but I need not mention this, as their importance is already well known to the Congress. It is necessary they should pay an early attention to this matter, as we know from past ex∣perience that men are very slow in re-enlisting.</P>
<P>When I had the honour of seeing admiral Hopkins at New-London, he represented to me the weak state of his fleet, occasioned by sickness and the damage he received in his engagement with the enemy; and requested I would spare him two hundred men to assist him in a design he had formed of attacking Wallace. This I readily consented to; and the men are to be returned as soon as the service is performed.</P>
<P>I wish it was in my power at present to furnish general Lee with the companies of artillery he desires. I have al∣ready sent two companies to Quebec; and I have not yet been able to procure a return of those that are here. I expect colonel Knox every moment, and shall then be able to determine whether any can be spared from hence. Blankets we are in great want of, ourselves; and it was with great difficulty a few could be procured for the rifle∣men that were ordered for Canada.</P>
<P>I inclose you Mr. Winthrop's receipt for two hundred thousand dollars brought some time ago from Philadelphia by major Sherburne, which you will please to deliver to the continental treasurers.</P>
<P>On my arrival here, I found that Mr. Livingston had been appointed by the provincial Congress a commissary, to furnish the continental troops stationed in this city with provisions. I suppose this was done because there was no continental commissary then on the spot. Mr. Livingston still claims a right of furnishing all the troops but those lately arrived from Cambridge. Mr. Trumbull is now here: and, as I consider him as the principal in that office,
<PB N="123" REF="029737_0122_0FE247FD16A4FB58"/>
I should be glad to know whether any part of the conti∣nental troops is to be furnished by any other than their com∣missary-general. I must needs say, that to me it appears very inconsistent, and must create great confusion in the accounts as well as in the contracts. I intended to have laid before Congress the amount of the rations, as supplied by colonel Trumbull and Mr. Livingston; and called upon those gentlemen to furnish me with a separate estimate for that purpose. Colonel Trumbull has given me his, by which it appears he supplies the troops at eight pence and one third per ration. I have not yet re∣ceived any from Mr. Livingston; but am informed his contract is at ten pence half-penny. The difference is im∣mense, as it will amount to no less than two hundred pounds per day, for twenty thousand men. It is indeed to be considered that Mr. Livingston's contract is, includ∣ing every other charge; and that to Mr. Trumbull's must be added store hire, clerks, and every other contin∣gent expense. But even then it will not amount to so much as Mr. Livingston's, by a penny per ration, which, in the gross, will be something very considerable. I thought it my duty, without prejudice or partiality, to state the matter fairly to Congress, that they might take such order upon it as to them shall seem necessary. I cannot however, in justice to Mr. Trumbull, help adding that he has been indefatigable in supplying the army; and I be∣lieve, from his connexions in New-England, is able to do it on as good terms as any person in America.</P>
<P>The several matters contained in the foregoing, I must beg the early attention of Congress to; and that I may be favoured with an answer as soon as possible.</P>

<P>IN a letter which I had the honour to receive from Congress some considerable time ago, they were pleased to ask what rank aides-de-camp bore in the army? from whence I concluded that they had adverted to the extra∣ordinary trouble and confinement of those gentlemen, with
<PB N="124" REF="029737_0123_0FE247A59506F710"/>
a view to make them an adequate allowance. But noth∣ing being since done or said of the matter, I take the lib∣erty, unsolicited by, and unknown to my aides-de-camp, to inform your honourable body that their pay is not by any means equal to their trouble and confinement.</P>
<P>No person wishes more to save money to the public, than I do: and no person has aimed more at it. But there are some cases in which parsimony may be ill placed; and this I take to be one. Aides-de-camp are persons in whom entire confidence must be placed: it requires men of abilities to execute the duties with propriety and dispatch, where there is such a multiplicity of business, as must at∣tend the commander-in-chief of such an army as ours▪ and persuaded I am, that nothing but the zeal of those gentle∣men (who live with me, and act in this capacity) for the great American cause, and personal attachment to me, has induced them to undergo the trouble and confinement they have experienced since they have become members of my family.</P>
<P>I give in to no kind of amusements myself; and conse∣quently those about me can have none, but are confined from morning till eve, hearing and answering the applica∣tions and letters of one and another, which will now, I expect, receive a pretty considerable addition, as the busi∣ness of the northern and eastern departments (if I continue here) must. I suppose, pass through my hands. If these gentlemen had the same relaxation from duty as other of∣ficers have in their common routine, there would not be so much in it. But, to have the mind always upon the stretch—scarce ever unbent—and no hours for recreation, makes a material odds. Knowing this, and at the same time how inadequate the pay is, I can scarce find inclina∣tion to impose the necessary duties of their office upon them. To what I have here said, this further remark may be made, and is a matter of no small concernment to me, and, in its consequences, to the public:—and that is, that, while the duty is hard and the pay small, it is not to be wondered at, if there should be found a promptness in them to seek preferment, or in me to do justice to them by facilitating their views; by which means I must lose their aid when they have it most in their power to assist
<PB N="125" REF="029737_0124_0FE247FE9CA41F70"/>
me. Influenced by these motives, I have taken the liberty of laying the matter fully, and with all due deference, be∣fore your honourable body, not doubting its meeting with a patient hearing.</P>

<P>I RECEIVED by last evening's post a letter from Joshua Wentworth, esquire, of Portsmouth, whom I had appointed agent for our little fleet in that province. It is dated the fifteenth instant; an extract from which I have the honour of transcribing for your perusal.</P>
<P>"The third instant, commodore Manly brought in the brigantine Elizabeth, one of the third division which sailed from Nantasket, with a valuable cargo of English goods, and a few hogsheads of rum and sugar, by a Mr. J * * *, who was passenger, part freighter, and a very tory. Sup∣pose the cargo worth twenty thousand pounds sterling. Those goods are, the greater part, owned by the late in∣habitants of Boston, and by some that were inhabitants when the troops left it,—the residue of this Mr. J * * *, and others of the same cast. The complicate state of this
<PB N="126" REF="029737_0125_0FE247A7191B71C8"/>
prize required my immediate setting off for Boston, ex∣pecting I might find some directions for my government there; when I waited on general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me his opinion (but not able to direct, hav∣ing received no instructions to the point) that the vessel and cargo must be libelled, and a dividend to the captors would follow, of all such goods as might be legally claim∣ed by the friends to America; and those that were the property of them inimical, might be decreed forfeited. Upon further inquiry, I was informed a resolve passed in Congress that all vessels and goods, retaken previous to a condemnation by a British court of admiralty, were liable to a partial decree (by every colony judge) to the captors, not more than one-third, nor less than one-fourth. The present prize falls under this resolve: and any other, that [<HI>makes the</HI>] property of our internal enemies liable to a full confiscation, may be necessary for my government: there∣fore shall be much obliged by your full direction of this capture, and a copy of the continental resolves thereon. This brigantine is owned by a Mr. Richard Hart, of this town, taken on her return from the West-Indies last Oc∣tober, and carried into Boston, not condemned: The rum on board are seventeen hogsheads,—and four of sugar, not removed out of her from the time of capture. The other cargo was in general stolen by virtue of general Howe's proclamation (which undoubtedly you have seen) appointing one C * * * B * * * superintendant, who, by the way, was taken in the prize, and is now confined in the Massachusetts colony, with Mr. J * * * and sundry others, by order of the general court, to whom general Ward delivered them.</P>
<P>"There were a serjeant and twelve privates of the fourth, or king's own regiment, taken prisoners on board, with the others, making sixty-three souls. * * *</P>
<P>"There appeared from the pillage of this cargo by ma∣ny of the passengers, the property was in him who could secrete the most. For, when examining the chests and bedding of the prisoners, I found great quantity of goods that they had collected while on board, which were taken out of ware-houses without packing, and hove promiscu∣ously on board the vessel. Even the sailors had provided

for their disposal at pleasure. In fact, the destruction of property, under cover of general Howe's proclamation, is unparell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led. * * *</P>
<P>"I am now discharging the cargo, as it is in a perishing situation; and, when selected, and the regular course pursued through the admiralty, shall advertise agreeable to his Excellency's instructions to general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me an abstract.</P>
<P>"The general court of this province, finding a difficul∣ty in making a code of laws for the admiralty-court, did not complete that institution their last session, when they adjourned to June; which lapse of time will not admit my facilitating the disposal of the prizes under my care, so early as I could wish, for the safety of part of the interest of the Susanna's cargo, viz. the porter, which I fear may be spoiled by lying so long,—it not having equal body to that commonly imported for sale;—which induces me to desire your direction for a disposal of that article either at private or public sale."</P>
<P>That, Sir, is an exact copy of part of Mr. Went∣worth's letter to Mr. Moylan. I now request you will please to direct me, in what manner I shall instruct the agent respecting the complicated cargo, and whether he may be empowered to dispose of the porter or any other articles on board the prizes under his care, which the de∣lay of establishing the court of admiralty may make liable to perish.</P>
<P>I have not yet heard that there has been any trial of the prizes carried into Massachusetts-Bay. This procrastina∣tion is attended with very bad consequences. Some of the vessels I had fitted out are now laid up, the crews be∣ing dissatisfied that they cannot get their prize-money. I have tired the Congress upon this subject: but the import∣ance of it makes me again mention, that, if a summary way of proceeding is not resolved on, it will be impossi∣ble to get our vessels manned. I must also mention to you, Sir, that captain Manly and his crew are desirous to know when they may expect their part of the value of the ordnance stores taken last fall. They are anxious to know what the amount may be. As the inventory of that car∣go is in the hands of Congress, I would humbly submit it
<PB N="128" REF="029737_0127_0FE247B1134F4C60"/>
to them, whether a valuation thereof should not be made, and the captors' dividend be remitted them as soon as pos∣sible. It will give them spirit, and encourage them to be alert in looking out for other prizes.</P>
<P>Several officers belonging to the regiments raised in these middle colonies inform me that their men (notwithstanding their agreement) begin to murmur at the distinction of pay made between them and the regiments from the east-ward. I would be glad that the Congress would attend to this in time, lest it may get to such a pitch as will make it difficult to suppress. They argue that they perform the same duty, undergo the same fatigue, and receive five dol∣lars, when the eastern regiments receive six dollars and two-thirds per month. For my own part, I wish they were all upon the same footing: for, if the British army will not face this way, it will be necessary to detach a great part of our troops: in that case, I would, for many rea∣sons, be sorry there should be any distinctions of regiments that are all in the pay of the United Colonies.</P>
<P>The deficiency of arms (in the New-York regiments es∣pecially) is very great. If I am rightly informed, there are scarce as many in colonel Ritzema's regiment as will arm one company. Can the Congress remedy this evil? If they can, there should not a moment be lost in effecting it, as our strength at present is, in reality, on paper only. Should we think of discharging those men who are without arms, the remedy would be worse than the disease: for, by vigorous exertions, I hope arms may be procured; and I well know that the raising men is exceeding difficult, especially to be engaged during the continuance of the war, which is the footing on which colonel Ritzema's regiment is engaged.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 26.—I had wrote thus far before I was hon∣oured with your favour of the twenty-third instant. In obedience to the order therein contained, I have directed six regiments more for Canada, which will embark as soon as vessels and other necessaries can be provided. These regiments will be commanded by general Sullivan. I shall give him instructions to join the forces in that country un∣der general Thomas, as soon as possible.</P>
<P>With respect to sending more troops to that country, I
<PB N="129" REF="029737_0128_0FE248085D7C1498"/>
am really at a loss what to advise, as it is impossible at present to know the designs of the enemy. Should they send the whole force under general Howe up the river St. Lawrence, to relieve Quebec and recover Canada, the troops gone and now going will be insufficient to stop their progress: and should they think proper to send that or an equal force this way from Great-Britain for the purpose of possessing this city and securing the navigation of Hudson's river, the troops left here will not be sufficient to oppose them: and yet, for any thing we know, I think it not im∣probable they may attempt both,—both being of the great∣est importance to them,—if they have men.</P>
<P>I could wish indeed that the army in Canada should be more powerfully reinforced: at the same time I am con∣scious that the trusting this important post (which is now become the grand magazine of America) to the handful of men remaining here, is running too great a risk. The securing this post and Hudson's river is to us also of so great importance, that I cannot at present advise the send∣ing any more troops from hence:—on the contrary, the general officers now here, whom I thought it my duty to consult, think it absolutely necessary to increase the army at this place with at least ten thousand men, especially when it is considered, that, from this place only, the army in Canada must draw its supplies of ammunition, provisions, and, most probably, of men; and that all reinforcements can be sent from hence much easier than from any other place. By the inclosed return, you will fee the state of the army here, and that the number of effective men is far short of what the Congress must have expected.</P>
<P>I have found it necessary to order colonel Dayton's regiment from New-Jersey to march as one of the six to Canada: wherefore I must recommend it to Congress to order two companies of one of the regiments still in Penn∣sylvania to march to Cape-May, which can be done much sooner: for, had this destination of that regiment not tak∣en place, it would have been very inconvenient to have de∣tached two companies from it to that place; as the march would (according to lord Stirling's and other accounts) have been at least two hundred miles from Amboy, and they must have passed within twenty miles of Philadelphia,
<PB N="130" REF="029737_0129_0FE247B2ECCDBA00"/>
there being no practicable road along the sea-coast of New-Jersey for their baggage to have passed.</P>
<P>Dr. Potts, who is bearer hereof, was, I understand, ap∣pointed director of the hospital for these middle colonies: but the army being removed, with the general hospital, from the eastward, does in course supersede him. He is inclined to go to Canada, where he may be very useful, if a person is not already appointed for that department. I would humbly beg leave to ask the Congress whether, in all these appointments, it would not be best to have but one chief, to whom all the others should be subordinate.</P>

<P>I MEAN, through you, to do myself the honour of laying before Congress a copy of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> address transmitted them some time ago by the assembly of Rhode-Island, which governor Cooke favoured me with in the month of January, at the same time requesting me to interest myself in procuring a body of forces on the continental establish∣ment, for the defence of that colony. I doubt not but the address and the subject of it have had the attention and consideration of Congress before now. But if they have not decided upon the matter, I would beg leave to mention that I have made inquiry into the situation and condition of the colony, and find it to be as stated▪ in the address; and, with all deference to the opinion of Congress, con∣ceive it highly necessary and expedient that they should adopt some measures for relieving their distress, and grant∣ing the aid prayed for. The importance of it in the chain of the union,—its extensive sea-coast, affording harbours for our shipping and vessels, at the same time exposing and subjecting the inhabitants to the ravages and depredations of our enemies,—the zeal and attachment which it has shewn, and which still actuates it, towards the common cause,—their incapacity to pay a sufficient number of men for its defence, should they be able to furnish them after so many engaged in other sevices;—these, and many other reasons which are too obvious to be mentioned, plead pow∣erfully
<PB N="131" REF="029737_0130_0FE24809E0C91CB8"/>
for the notice and attention of Congress, and seem to me to claim their support.</P>
<P>Having thus stated the matter to Congress for their con∣sideration, agreeable to my promise to governor Cooke when I had the honour of seeing him on my way here,—I shall leave it with them, not doubting but they will duly weigh its importance, and give such assistance as they may think reasonable and just. What they chiefly wish for is that the troops they have raised may be taken into con∣tinental pay, and commanding officers appointed by Con∣gress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your favour of the thirtieth ul∣timo, and observe what Congress have done respecting the settlement of the paymaster's accounts. This seems expe∣dient, as he is out of office, and, I am certain, will be at∣tended with but little if any difficulty; nothing more being necessary, than to compare the warrants with his debts, and the receipts he has given, with his credits. I wish every other settlement as easy, and that a committee was appoint∣ed to examine and audit the accounts upon which the war∣rants are founded, particularly those of the quarter-master and commissary generals. They are long and of high amount, consisting of a variety of charges,—of course more intricate, and will require time and an extraordinary degree of attention to adjust and liquidate in a proper manner.—Upon this subject, I did myself the honour to write you a considerable time ago.</P>
<P>Having had several complaints from the officers in the eastern regiments who have been and are engaged in recruit∣ing, about the expense attending it, and for which they have never yet been allowed any thing, though the officers in these governments have, as I am informed,—I shall be glad to know whether the allowance of ten shillings, grant∣ed to the officers for every man enlisted, by the resolve of Congress in [<HI>January</HI>] is general and indiscriminate, or confined to the middle districts. If general, must I have
<PB N="132" REF="029737_0131_0FE247B471C8DB98"/>
retrospect to the time of the resolve, and pay for the ser∣vices since, or only for future enlistments?</P>
<P>In a letter I wrote to Congress the twenty-fifth of De∣cember, I inclosed one I had received from Jacob Baily, esquire, about opening a road from Newbury to Canada. I have received another of the fifteenth ultimo: and, from his account and the intelligence I have from others upon inquiry, I have no doubt of the practicability of the meas∣ure; and am well informed that the distance will be con∣siderably shortened, insomuch that our people going from any part of the New-England governments eastward of Connecticut-river, to Canada, or returning from thence home, will perform their march in five or six days less time than by coming or going any way now used. Add to this, that the road may be so conducted (as it is said) as to go to the river Missisque, from whence the water-carriage to St. John's is good, except forty odd miles,—or be carried so far to the northward, as to keep clear of the Lakes altogether, and afford an easy pass into Canada at all seasons. The advantage resulting from this route being so great and important, I have advanced colonel Bai∣ley two hundred and fifty pounds to begin with, and di∣rected him to execute his plan. No doubt it will require a considerable advance to accomplish it: but that will be soon sunk. The expense saved, by taking off six day's pay and provisions from the soldiers returning to the east∣ern governments at the expiration of this campaign, will be almost if not more than equal to the charge incur∣red in opening it. If not,—as in all probability there will be often a necessity for sending detachments of our troops to Canada from those governments, and for others to return, it will soon be repaid.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the twenty-seventh ultimo, I find general Thompson and his brigade were at Albany;—general Sullivan with the last (except three or four companies of colonel Wayne's regiment, not yet come) is embarked and gone, and probably will be soon there. I am apprehensive, from general Schuyler's account, that they will not proceed with the wished-for expedition, owing to a difficulty in getting teams and provender for cattle neces∣sary to carry their baggage, and a scarcity of batteaux at
<PB N="133" REF="029737_0132_0FE2480B64B37648"/>
the Lakes for so large a number, though he is taking the ut∣most pains to procure them. Should they be stopped for any time, it will be exceedingly unfortunate, as their going from hence has weakened us here much, and our army in Canada will not be strengthened.</P>
<P>I have sent with the last brigade sixty barrels of powder, and other stores and intrenching tools, a supply being ask∣ed for; also the chain for a boom at the narrows of Rich∣elieu, and the three boxes of money brought by Mr. Han∣son; and have wrote to general Schuyler to have the boom fixed as soon as possible. The commissary too has for∣warded about eight hundred barrels of pork, and is in ex∣pectation of a further quantity from Connecticut, which will go on without stopping here.</P>
<P>As the magazine from whence the northern and eastern armies will occasionally receive supplies of powder will probably be here, and our stock is low and inconsiderable, being much reduced by the sixty barrels sent to Canada, I shall be glad to have a quantity immediately forwarded. Our stores should be great: for if the enemy make an at∣tack upon the town, or attempt to go up the North-river, the expenditure will be very considerable. Money too is much wanted:—the regiments that are paid have only re∣ceived to the first of April, except those of Pennsylvania and Jersey which are gone to Canada: they are paid to the last of April. By a letter from general Ward, I find his chest is just exhausted; the money which was left with him for the payment of the five regiments at Boston and Beverly being almost expended by large draughts in favour of the commissary and quarter-master, and in fitting out the armed vessels.</P>
<P>I would here ask a question, to wit, whether, as Mr. Warren's commission is superseded by Mr. Palfrey's ap∣pointment, it will not be necessary to fix upon some person to pay the troops there: or are the payments to go through his hands?—He does not incline to do any thing in the affair without the direction of Congress.</P>
<P>I have inclosed you a return of the last brigade detached, and also of the forces remaining here. And as it is a matter of much importance to know the whole of our strength from time to time, and to see it at one view, for
<PB N="134" REF="029737_0133_0FE247B707290DB8"/>
regulating our movements with propriety, I wish it were a direction from Congress to the commanding officers in the different districts to make monthly returns to the command∣er-in-chief of the continental army, of the state of the troops in their departments, and also of the military stores. Such direction will probably make them more attentive than they otherwise would be. I could not get a return of the army in Canada all last year.</P>
<P>I beg leave to lay before Congress a copy of the pro∣ceedings of a court-martial upon lieutenant * * * *, of the second regiment, and of his defence—which I should not have troubled them with, had I not conceived the court's sentence, upon the facts stated in the proceedings, of a sin∣gular nature, to be by no means adequate to the enormity of his offence, and to be of exceeding dangerous and per∣nicious tendency. Upon these principles I thought it my duty to transmit the proceedings to them, in order that they may form such a judgment upon the facts stated, as they may conceive right and just, and advancive of the public good. At the same time I would mention to Con∣gress that I think it of material consequence that they should pass a resolve, cutting off the right of succession in the military line from one rank to another, which is claim∣ed by many upon the happening of vacancies—(upon which principle this offence seems to have originated in a great measure, and the extraordinary judgment in this instance to be founded)—declaring that no succession or promotion can take place upon any vacancy, without a continental commission giving and authorising it. It is of much con∣sequence to check and entirely suppress this opinion and claim, which is becoming too prevalent, and has an obvi∣ous tendency to introduce mutiny and disorder;—or, if they conceive the claim good, and that it should take place, that they will declare it so, that the point may be settled and known in future.</P>

<P>I HAVE so often and so fully communicated my want of arms to Congress, that I should not have given
<PB N="135" REF="029737_0134_0FE24814367CD658"/>
them the trouble of receiving another letter upon this sub∣ject at this time, but for the particular application of colo∣nel Wayne, of Pennsylvania, who has pointed out a method by which he thinks they may be obtained.</P>
<P>In the hands of the committee of safety at Philadelphia, there are, according to colonel Wayne's account, not less than two or three thousand stand of arms for provincial use. From hence he thinks a number might b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> borrowed by Congress, provided they are replaced w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> continental arms as they are brought into the magazine in that city. At a crisis so important as this, such a loan might be at∣tended with the most signal advantages—while the de∣fenceless state of the regiments, if no relief can be had, may be productive of fatal consequences.</P>
<P>To give Congress some idea of our situation with respect to arms—(and justice to my own character requires that it should be known to them, although the world at large will form their opinion of our strength from numbers, with∣out attending to circumstances)—it may not be amiss to inclose a copy of a return which I received a few days ago from the forts in the Highlands, and add, that, by a report fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> colonel Ritzema's regiment, of the twenty-ninth ul∣timo, there appeared to be only ninety-seven firelocks and seven bayonets belonging thereto; and that all the regi∣ments from the eastward are deficient from twenty to fifty of the former. Four of those companies at the fortifica∣tions in the Highlands belong to colonel Clinton's regi∣ment: but in what condition the residue are on account of arms, and how colonel Wynkoop's men are provided, I cannot undertake to say, but am told, most miserably; as colonel Dayton's of New-Jersey and colonel Wayne's of Pennsylvania also are. This, Sir, is a true though mel∣ancholy description of our situation. The propriety there∣fore of keeping arms in store when men in actual pay are in want of them, and who (it is to be presumed) will, as they ought, bear the heat and burden of the day, is sub∣mitted with all due deference to the superior judgment of others.</P>
<P>I cannot, by all the inquiries I have been able to make, learn what number of arms have been taken from the to∣ries, where they lie, or how they are to be got at. The
<PB N="136" REF="029737_0135_0FE247BE28255800"/>
committee of safety for this colony have assured me that no exertions of theirs shall be wanting to procure arms: but our sufferings in the mean while may prove fatal, as men without are in a manner useless. I have therefore thoughts of employing an agent whose sole business it shall be to ride through the middle and interior parts of these governments, for the purpose of buying up such arms as the inhabitants may incline to sell, and are fit for use.</P>
<P>The designs of the enemy are too much behind the cur∣tain for me to form any acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate opinion of their plan of operations for the summer's campaign. We are left to wander therefore in the field of conjecture: and as no place (all its consequences considered) seemed of more importance in the execution of their grand plan, than pos∣sessing themselves of Hudson's river, I thought it advisea∣ble to remove with the continental army to this city so soon as the king's troops evacuated Boston. But if Con∣gress, from their knowledge, information, or belief, think it best for the general good of the service that I should go to the northward or elsewhere, they are convinced, I hope, that they have nothing more to do than signify their com∣mands.</P>

<P>AT a quarter after seven this evening, I received by express a letter from Thomas Cushing, esquire, chairman of a committee of the honourable general court, covering one to them from the committee of Salem; copies of which I do myself the honour to lay before Congress, that they may judge of the intelligence contained therein, and direct such measures to be taken upon the occasion as they may think proper and necessary.</P>
<P>I would observe, that supposing captain Lee's account to be true in part, I think there must be a mistake either in the number of troops or the transport ships. If there are no more ships than what are mentioned, it is certain there cannot be so many troops. Of this, however, Con∣gress
<PB N="137" REF="029737_0136_0FE24815BB7D10A0"/>
can judge as well as myself; and I submit to them, whether, upon the whole of the circumstances, and the uncertainty of their destination (if they were seen at all) they choose that any forces shall be detached from hence, as they will see, from the returns transmitted yesterday, that the number of men now here is but small and incon∣siderable, and, (what is to be regretted) no small part of these without arms. Perhaps, by dividing and subdivid∣ing our force too much, we shall have no one post suffi∣ciently guarded.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favours of the fourth and seventh instant with their several inclo∣sures, and am exceedingly glad, that before the resolution respecting lieutenant-colonel Ogden came to hand, I had ordered him to join his regiment, and had qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled a disa∣greeable spirit both of mutiny and desertion, which had taken place and seemed to be rising to a great degree in consequence of it. In order to effect it, I had the regi∣ment paraded, and ordered two more at the same time un∣der arms, convinced them of their error and ill conduct, and obtained a promise for their good behaviour in future. To such of the men as had absconded I gave pardons, on their assurances to return to their duty again.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fifth instant which I had the honour of addressing you, I mentioned to Congress the refractory and mutinous conduct of lieutenant * * * *, of the second regiment, and laid before them a copy of the proceedings
<PB N="138" REF="029737_0137_0FE247C0C264F210"/>
of a court-martial upon him, and of his defence, with a view that such measures might be adopted as they should think adequate to his crime. I would now beg leave to inform them, that, since then, he has appeared sensible of his misconduct; and having made a written acknowledg∣ment of his offence, and begged pardon for it, (as by the inclosed copy will appear) I thought it best to release him from his confinement, and have ordered him to join his regiment; which I hope will meet their approbation, and render any determination, as to him, unnecessary;—ob∣serving at the same time that I have endeavoured, and, I flatter myself, not ineffectually, to support their authority, and a due subordination in the army. I have found it of importance and highly expedient to yield many points in fact, without seeming to have done it—and this, to avoid bringing on a too frequent discussion of matters, which, in a political view, ought to be kept a little behind the cur∣tain, and not be made too much the subjects of disquisition. Time only can eradicate and overcome customs and prej∣udices of long standing: they must be got the better of by slow and gradual advances.</P>
<P>I would here take occasion to suggest to Congress (not wishing or meaning of myself to assume the smallest degree of power in any instance) the propriety and necessity of having their sentiments respecting the filling up the vacan∣cies and issuing commissions to officers, especially to those under the rank of field officers. Had I literally complied with the directions given upon this subject when I first en∣gaged in the service, and which I conceived to be super∣seded by a subsequent resolve for forming the army upon the present establishment, I must have employed one clerk for no other business than issuing warrants of appointment, and giving information to Congress for their confirmation or refusal. It being evident from the necessity of the thing, that there will be frequent changes and vacancies in office, from death and a variety of other causes, I now submit it to them, and pray their direction whether I am to pursue that mode and all the ceremonies attending it, or to be at liberty to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll up and grant commissions at once to such as may be fit and proper persons to succeed. * * *</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="029737_0138_0FE2481744E43668"/>
Before I have done, with the utmost deference and re∣spect I would beg leave to remind Congress of my former letters and applications respecting the appointment of prop∣er persons to superintend and take direction of such pris∣oners as have already fallen and will fall into our hands in the course of the war—being fully convinced, that, if there were persons appointed who would take the whole management of them under their care, the continent would save a considerable sum of money by it, and the prisoners be better treated and provided with real necessaries than they now are;—and shall take the liberty to add that it appears to me a matter of much importance, and worthy of consideration, that particular and proper places of secu∣rity should be fixed on and established in the interior parts of the different governments for their reception.</P>
<P>Such establishments are agreeable to the practice and usage of the English and other nations, and are founded on principles of necessity and public utility. The advantages which will arise from them are obvious and many:—I shall only mention two or three. They will tend much to prevent escapes, (which are difficult to effect when the public is once advertised that the prisoners are restrained to a few stated and well-known places, and not permitted to go from thence,) and the more ingenious among them from disseminating and spreading their artful and per∣nicious intrigues and opinions throughout the country, which would influence the weaker and wavering part of mankind, and meet with but too favourable a hearing. Further, it will be less in their power to join and assist our enemies in cases of invasion, and will give us an oppor∣tunity always to know, from the returns of those appoint∣ed to superintend them, what number we have in posses∣sion, the force sufficient to check and suppress their hostile views in times of emergency, and the expenses necessary for their maintenance and support. Many other reasons might be adduced to prove the necessity and expediency of the measure:—I shall only subjoin one more, and then have done on the subject,—which is, that many of the towns where prisoners have been already sent, not having convenience for or the mean of keeping them, complain they are burdensome; and have become careless, inat∣tentive,
<PB N="140" REF="029737_0139_0FE247C24820BBF8"/>
and altogether indifferent whether they escape or not; and those of them that are restricted to a closer con∣finement (the limits of jail) are neglected, and not treated with that care and regard which Congress wish.</P>
<P>I have not received further intelligence of the German troops since my letter of the seventh instant, covering Mr. Cushing's dispatches. But, lest the account of their coming should be true, may it not be adviseable and good policy to raise some companies of our Germans to send among them when they arrive, for exciting a spirit of disaffection and desertion?—If a few sensible and trusty fellows could get with them, I should think they would have great weight and influence with the common soldiery, who certainly have no enmity towards us, having received no injury nor cause of quarrel from us. The measure having oc∣curred, and appearing to me expedient, I thought it pru∣dent to mention it for the consideration of Congress.</P>
<P>Having received a letter from general Ward, advising that Congress have accepted his resignation, and praying to be relieved,—and it being necessary that a general of∣ficer should be sent to take the command of the troops at Boston, especially if the army should arrive which is talk∣ed of, and which some consider as a probable event,—I must beg leave to recommend to Congress the appoint∣ment of some brigadier-generals, not having more here (nor so many at this time) than are essential to the gov∣ernment and conducting the forces and the works that are carrying on. Generals Sullivan and Thompson being ordered to Canada, I cannot spare one more general of∣ficer from hence without injuring the service greatly, and leaving the army here without a sufficient number.</P>
<P>Having frequent applications from the committee of safety and others, about an exchange of prisoners, and not having authority to pursue any other mode in this instance, than that marked out by a resolve of Congress some con∣siderable time ago, I hope they will pardon me when I wish them to take under consideration such parts of my letter of the twenty-second ultimo as relate to this subject; and for their determination upon it. I shall then have it in my power to give explicit and satisfactory answers to those who shall apply.</P>

<P>SINCE my last of the eleventh instant which I had the honour to address you, nothing of moment or import∣ance has occurred; and the principal design of this is to communicate to Congress the intelligence I received last night from general Schuyler by a letter of the tenth, re∣specting the progress of our troops in getting towards Can∣ada, not doubting of their impatience and anxiety to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r of it and of every thing relating to the expedition. For their more particular information and satisfaction, I have done myself the pleasure to extract the substance of his letter on this head, which is as follows:—"that general Thompson, with the last of his brigade, on the morning of Tuesday se'nnight, embarked at Fort-George; and, in the evening of the next day, general Sullivan arrived at Albany; that he had ordered an additional number of carpenters to assist in building boats: who, finishing eight every day, would have a hundred and ten complete by the twenty-first, before which he was fearful the last of general Sullivan's brigade could not embark;—that they would carry thirty men each, besides the baggage, ammu∣tion, and intrenching tools." * * *</P>
<P>He also informs, "that the sixty barrels of powder had arrived, and would be forwarded that day;—that the first regiment of general Sullivan's brigade marched that morn∣ing; and that the intrenching tools and about six hundred barrels of pork were also gone on;—that he cannot pos∣sibly send more than half of the three hundred thousand dollars into Canada, (being greatly in debt on the public account, and the creditors exceedingly clamorous and im∣portunate for payment) which sum he hopes will be suf∣ficient till the Canadians agree to take our paper currency, to which they are much averse, and of which he is ex∣ceedingly doubtful;—that he had got the chain, and would forward it that day to general Arnold, with orders to fix it at the rapids of Richelieu." He adds "that he had reviewed general Sullivan's brigade in presence of about two hundred and sixty Indians, who were greatly pleased with the order and regularity of the troops, and surprised at the number, which, the tories had industrious∣ly
<PB N="142" REF="029737_0141_0FE247C3CDBE8248"/>
propagated, consisted only of three companies, and that they were kept always walking the streets, to induce them to believe their number was much greater than it really was."</P>
<P>I have inclosed a copy of general Schuyler's instructions to James Price, esquire, deputy commissary-general, for the regulation of his conduct in that department, which I received last night, and which general Schuyler requested me to forward you. I also beg leave to lay before Con∣gress a copy of a letter from Samuel Stringer, director of one of the hospitals, purporting an application for an in∣crease of surgeons'-mates, &amp;c. an estimate of which is also inclosed; and submit it to them, what number must be sent from hence or got elsewhere. It is highly probable that many more will be wanted in Canada than are already there, on account of the late augmentation of the army: but I thought it most adviseable to make his requisition known to Congress, and to take their order and direction upon it. As to the medicines, I shall speak to Dr. Mor∣gan (not yet arrived) as soon as he comes, and order him to forward such as may be necessary and can be possibly spared.</P>

<P>I THIS moment received by express from general Schuyler an account of the melancholy prospect and re∣verse of our affairs in Canada: and presuming that the letters which accompany this will give Congress full infor∣mation upon the subject, I shall only add that general Schuy∣ler, in pursuance of orders from the honourable commis∣sioners, has directed brigadier-general Sullivan to halt his brigade; as a further reinforcement (on account of the scar∣city of provisions) would not relieve, but contribute great∣ly to distress our troops already in Canada. Before he received these orders, all the brigade, except Dayton's and Wayne's regiments, had left Albany: but I suppose he will be able to stop their march.</P>

By my letter of the fifteenth, Congress will perceive the quantity of pork already gone from hence: and the commissary has assured me that he will forward a further supply as soon as it can be possibly collected. I had also directed five tons of lead to be sent to general Schuyler for the Canada expedition, before I received this unfortu∣nate account; which was as much as could be spared for the present (our stock being inconsiderable in proportion to the demand we may reasonably expect for it;) and shall do every thing in my power to relieve our affairs from their present distressed and melancholy situation in that quarter, which occurs to me and appears neces∣sary.</P>
<P>I am also to acknowledge the receipt of your favours of the tenth and thirteenth instant, with their several in∣closures. The money, accompanying the latter, came to the paymaster's hands safe.</P>

<P>YOUR favour of the sixteenth, with several resolu∣tions of Congress therein inclosed, I had not the honour to receive till last night.

<P>I DO myself the honour to inform Congress that I arrived here yesterday afternoon about one o'clock, and found all in a state of peace and quiet. I had not time to view the works carrying on, and those ordered to be be∣gun when I went away; but have reason to believe, from the report of such of the general and other officers as I had the pleasure to see, that they have been prosecuted and forwarded with all possible diligence and dispatch.</P>
<P>I am much concerned for the situation of our affairs in Canada, and am fearful, ere this, it is much worse than was first reported at Philadelphia. The intelligence from thence, in a letter from captain Wilkinson of the second regiment, to general Greene, is truly alarming. It not only confirms the account of colonel Biddle and major Sherburne's defeat, but seems to forebode general Arnold's, with the loss of Montreal. I have inclosed a copy of the letter, which will but too well shew that there is founda∣tion for my apprehensions.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of yesterday which I had the honour of addressing you, and which was designed to have gone by post, but was prevented by his departure before the usu∣al time, I mentioned my having received by express a let∣ter and sundry papers from general Schuyler, respecting Sir John Johnston, copies of which I herewith transmit you for your inspection and perusal. They will shew you what measures were planned and attempted for apprehending him, and securing the Scotch Highlanders in Tryon county.</P>
<P>Having heard that the troops at Boston are extremely uneasy and almost mutinous for want of pay, (several months being now due) I must take the liberty to repeat a question contained in my letter of the fifth ultimo—"What mode is to be pursued respecting it? whether is money to be sent from hence by the paymaster general, or some person sub∣ordinate
<PB N="147" REF="029737_0146_0FE2482440280618"/>
ordinate to him to be appointed there for that purpose?" I expected some direction would have been given in this in∣stance, long ere this, from what was contained in yours ac∣companying (or about the time of) the last remittance. I presume it has been omitted by reason of the multiplicity of important business before Congress.</P>
<P>In perusing the several resolves you honoured me with when at Philadelphia and since my return, I find one allow∣ing a chief engineer for the army in a separate department. The service requiring many of them, I wish Congress, if they know any persons skilled in this business, would ap∣point them. General Schuyler has frequently applied, and suggested the necessity of having some in Canada. I my∣self know of none.</P>
<P>I also find there is a resolve of the third of June for taking Indians into the service, which, if literally constru∣ed, confines them to that in Canada. Is that the meaning of Congress, or that the commander-in-chief may order their service to any place he may think necessary?</P>
<P>In respect to the establishing expresses between the sever∣al continental posts,—who is to do it? the resolve does not say. Is it expected by Congress that I should? Who∣ever the work is assigned to, I think, should execute it with the utmost dispatch. The late imperfect and contradicto∣ry accounts respecting our defeat at the Cedars, strongly point out the necessity there is for it. No intelligence is yet come from any officer in command there, (and most probably for want of a proper channel to convey it) though this misfortune happened so long ago.</P>
<P>When I had the honour of being in Congress, if I mis∣take not, I heard a resolve read, or was told of one, allow∣ing the New-York troops the same pay as others in the continental service. This, if any such, I do not find; and if there is not such a one, I shall be under some embarrass∣ment, how to pay the militia to be provided by this prov∣ince. The resolve providing them says they are to be paid, while in service, as other troops are. But if those enlisted heretofore in this province are to receive according to the first establishment, it is a matter of doubt what the militia are to have.</P>
<P>Before this comes to hand, a hand-bill, containing an
<PB N="148" REF="029737_0147_0FE247D010F097F8"/>
account of a victory gained by general Arnold over the party that had defeated colonel Biddle and major Sher∣burne, will most probably have reached you. I have in∣quired into the authenticity of this fortunate report, and have found there is no dependence to be put in it; nor do I believe it deserving of the least credit. I shall be happy not to hear the reverse.</P>

<P>P. S. If Congress have come to any resolution about an allowance to induce men to re-enlist, you will please to fa∣vour me with it, as the time the rifle regiment is engaged for is just expired.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured yesterday with your favour of the seventh, with its inclosures. When Dr. Potts arrives, I shall order him to Canada or Lake-George, as may appear most proper. It is certainly necessary that he or Dr. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should go to the former. The resolve respecting general Wooster's recal I will immediately transmit him, with directions to repair hither without delay.</P>
<P>The situation of our affairs in Canada, as reported by the honourable commissioners, is truly alarming; and I am sorry that my opinion of the ill consequences resulting from the short enlistment of the army should be but too well confirmed by the experience they have had of the want of discipline and order in our soldiery there. This induces me again to wish Congress to determine on a lib∣eral allowance to engage the troops already in service to re-enlist for a longer period, or during the continuance of the war; nor can I forbear expressing my opinion of the propriety of keeping the military chest always supplied with money, as evils of the most interesting nature are often pro∣duced for want of a regular payment of troops. The neg∣lect makes them impatient and uneasy.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="029737_0148_0FE24826D1C9CD70"/>
I am much surprised at the scarcity of provisions there, particularly of flour; as, from several accounts I had re∣ceived from thence, I was led to expect that considerable supplies of that article could be procured there. That our misfortunes may not become greater, I have wrote to the commissary to forward more provisions, in addition to those already sent.</P>
<P>An adjutant and quarter-master-general are indispensably necessary, with assistants. The money saved to the conti∣nent by their non-appointment will be but small and trifling, when put in competition with the loss for want of them. Colonel Fleming, who acted in the former capacity under general Montgomery, is now here: but his indisposition is such as to render him unfit, at this time, for the post:—it is an important one, and requires vigour and activity to discharge the duties of it. He will be of much service to colonel Reed, the business of whose office will increase considerably by the augmentation of the army.</P>
<P>It will be necessary, too, that the commissaries in Can∣ada, and the deputy quarter-master-generals, should have several assistants and clerks: nor do I think a precise num∣ber can be fixed on, as a variety of circumstances may and must occur, to render the number, essential for doing the business in those departments, greater or less at different times. It will be better, I apprehend, to leave it indef∣inite, and with power to the commanding officer to allow such as may be wanted.</P>
<P>I am still in the dark, how the unfortunate affair ended at the Cedars, or on what terms the surrender was made, as the last letter from the commissioners has reference to a former, and mentions an agreement entered into, which I have not seen: but I know of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more than I could wish.</P>
<P>I have received from Providence, in consequence of Mr. Morris's order, as chairman of the secret committee of Congress, two hundred and thirty-four muskets, in part of the two hundred and forty-four directed to be sent. The inclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Brown will ac∣count for the deficiency.</P>
<P>I shall be much obliged by your ordering a quantity of lead and flints to be immediately forwarded: our demands for both are and will be very pressing. There are also want∣ed
<PB N="150" REF="029737_0149_0FE2482E560D9D58"/>
some particular and necessary medicines to complete our hospital chests, of which I will get Dr. Morgan to furnish Congress with a list, when he writes or waits on them about some other matters necessary to be fixed in his de∣partment.</P>
<P>As general Wooster, in all probability, will be here in a little time in compliance with the resolve of Congress and my order transmitted to him, I wish to know what I am to do with him when he comes.</P>
<P>General Schuyler, in his letter of the thirty-first ultimo, of which I transmitted you a copy yesterday, mentions that sundry persons had a design to seize him as a tory, and probably still have; and wishes Congress to give him some public mark of their approbation, if they are convinc∣ed of his zeal and attachment to the cause of his country. Whether he intended that I should communicate his desire to them, or not, I am not certain: but, supposing that he did, I must beg leave to request that you will lay the par∣agraph before them, that they may do, in the instance of his requisition, whatever they may judge necessary.</P>

<P>SINCE I did myself the honour of writing to you yesterday, I have had the satisfaction of seeing, and for a few minutes conversing with Mr. Chase and Mr. Car∣roll, from Canada. Their account of our troops and the situation of affairs in that department cannot possibly sur∣prise you more than it has done me. But I need not touch upon a subject which you will be so well informed of from the fountain-head; nor should I have given you the trouble of a letter by this day's post, but for the distraction
<PB N="151" REF="029737_0150_0FE24881324195D8"/>
which seems to prevail in the commissary's department, as well as others in that quarter,—the necessity of having it under one general direction,—and the dissatisfaction of colonel Trumbull at the allowance made him by Congress as an equivalent for his trouble. With respect to this particular matter, I can only say that I think he is a man well [<HI>calculated</HI>] for the business, and that, where a shil∣ling is saved in the pay, a pound may be lost by misman∣agement in the office; and that his resignation at this time (I mean this campaign) may possibly be attended with fa∣tal consequences. I therefore humbly submit to Congress the propriety of handsomely rewarding those gentlemen who hold such very important, troublesome, and hazard∣ous offices, as commissary and quarter-master.</P>
<P>In speaking to the former about the supplies necessary for the troops to be raised, he informed me that the quan∣tity of salt provisions which was shipping from hence might render his attempts to do it precarious; in consequence of which, I desired him to lay the matter before the con∣vention of this colony, which he will do this day, but in the mean while desired Congress might be informed of the matter, which I cannot better do than in his own words inclosed, and submit the consideration of it to the wisdom of that honourable body.</P>
<P>To Congress I also submit the propriety of keeping the two continental battalions (under the command of colonels Shee and M<SUP>c</SUP>Gaw) at Philadelphia, when there is the greatest probability of a speedy attack upon this place from the king's troops. The encouragements given by gover∣nor Tryon to the disaffected, which are circulated, no one can well tell how,—the movements of these kind of peo∣ple, which are more easy to perceive than describe,—the confident report, which is said to have come immediately from governor Tryon, and brought by a frigate from Hal∣ifax, that the troops at that place were embarking for this,—added to a thousand incidental circumstances, trivial in themselves, but strong from comparison,—leave not a doubt upon my mind but that troops are hourly expected at the Hook.</P>
<P>I had no doubt when I left this city for Philadelphia, but that some measures would have been taken to secure
<PB N="152" REF="029737_0151_0FE2482FDB1E90E0"/>
the suspected and dangerous persons of this government before now, and left orders for the military to give every aid to the civil power. But the subject is delicate, and nothing is done in it. We may therefore have internal as well as external enemies to contend with.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour of transmitting to Congress a letter which came by express last night from general Schuyler, inclosing a copy of a letter to him from colonel Kirkland. I have likewise inclosed the copy of one di∣rected to general Putnam or the commanding officer at New-York. The representations contained in these letters have induced me, without waiting the determination of Congress, to direct general Schuyler immediately to com∣mence a treaty with the Six Nations, and to engage them in our interest, upon the best terms he and his colleagues in commission can procure: and I trust the urgency of the occasion will justify my proceeding to the Congress:—the necessity for decision and dispatch in all our meas∣ures, in my opinion, becomes every day more and more apparent.</P>
<P>The express, Mr. Bennet, was overtaken at Albany by general Schuyler, who had received intelligence at Fort-George that a considerable body of Mohawk Indians were coming down the Mohawk river under the conduct of Sir John Johnston. The general's extreme hurry would not allow him to write: but it seems his intention is to collect at Albany a sufficient force to oppose Sir John. I have given him my opinion that colonel Day∣ton's regiment should be employed in that service, and to secure the post where Fort-Stanwix formerly stood.</P>
<P>In consequence of an information that several mer∣chants were exporting salt pork and beef from this place, I requested the commissary to make application to the provincial Congress for a restraint to be laid on the ex∣portation of those articles, as I apprehended, not only that the enemy might receive supplies by the capture of
<PB N="153" REF="029737_0152_0FE24882B6613038"/>
our vessels, but that our people might shortly experience a scarcity. The provincial Congress have accordingly made a resolution (a copy of which is inclosed) to stop the exportation for fourteen days. They expect Congress will in the mean time frame some general regulations on this head. They are unwilling (they say) to subject their constituents to partial restraints.</P>
<P>I once mentioned to Congress that I thought a war-office extremely necessary, and they seemed inclined to in∣stitute one for our army; but the affair seems to have been since dropped. Give me leave again to insist on the util∣ity and importance of such an establishment. The more I reflect upon the subject, the more I am convinced of its necessity, and that affairs can never be properly con∣ducted without it.</P>
<P>It is with pleasure I receive the resolve inclosed in your favour of the eleventh instant. One considerable ground of dissatisfaction in the army is thereby removed.</P>
<P>I have employed persons in building the gondolas and rafts which the Congress thought necessary for the defence of this place; and, in conjunction with the provincial Congress, have determined to sink chevaux-de-frise, one of which is already begun.</P>

<P>From general Schuyler's letter, he has in view the tak∣ing post where Fort-Stanwix formerly stood. I wrote him I thought it prudent, previous to that, to secure a post lower down, about the falls below the German-Flats, lest the savages should possess themselves of the country, and pre∣vent supplies of men and provisions that may be necessary to send there in future. He says he is in want of cannon and ammunition; but has expressed himself so ambiguously, that I am at a loss to know whether he meant what he has said as an application or not,—this being the only intelli∣gence on the subject, and the first mention of his want. I have desired him to explain the matter, and, in his future requisitions for necessaries, to be more certain and explicit as to quantity and quality. In the mean time I shall send him some intrenching tools, and inquire whether there are any cannon that can be spared from hence.</P>

<P>General Sullivan mentions his having given commissions to some of the Canadians as a measure founded in necessity, and requests my approbation of it. But not considering
<PB N="155" REF="029737_0154_0FE2488565F11E98"/>
myself empowered to say any thing upon the subject, it may not be improper for Congress to give him their opinion in this instance.</P>
<P>I have also inclosed copies of general Schuyler's letters received at the same time. They contain accounts respect∣ing the Indians, variant from what was reported by Mr. Kirkland, but amounting to the same thing,—the probabil∣ity of the savages attacking our frontiers.</P>
<P>By last night's post I had information of a capture made by our armed vessels, of one of the transports with a com∣pany of Highlanders on board, bound to Boston. The in-closed extract from general Ward's letter to me will give you the intelligence more particularly. There are accounts in the city mentioning other valuable prizes: but as general Ward has said nothing of them, I fear they want authen∣ticity.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention that a further sum of money will be wanted for our military chest by the time it can be sent. The inclosed note from the pay-master-general shews the necessity for it; and, I may add, besides his estimate of draughts to be made, there are the claims of the eastern troops at Boston for three or four months' pay, not included, and now due.</P>
<P>Colonel M<SUP>c</SUP>Gaw is arrived with part of his battalion; and by Wednesday evening the whole both of his and colonel Shee's will be here, as I am told.</P>
<P>As it is and may be of great importance to have a com∣munication with the Jersies and Long-Island, I have had several flat-bottomed boats built for the purpose, and have thoughts of getting more for Posaic and Hackinsac rivers, where they may be equally necessary for transporting our army or part of it occasionally, or succours coming to or going from it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your fa∣vours of the fourteenth and eighteenth instant, and the interesting resolves contained in them, with which I have been honoured. The several matters recommended to my attention shall be particularly regarded, and the directions of Congress and your requests complied with in every in∣stance, as far as in my power.</P>
<P>The instituting a war-office is certainly an event of great importance, and, in all probability, will be recorded as such in the historic page. The benefits derived from it, I flatter myself, will be considerable, though the plan upon which it is first formed may not be entirely perfect. This, like other great works, in its first edition, may not be free from error:—time will discover its defects, and ex∣perience suggest the remedy, and such further improvements as may be necessary; but it was right to give it a begin∣ning, in my opinion.</P>
<P>The recommendation to the convention of New-York for restraining and punishing disaffected persons, I am hopeful, will be attended with salutary consequences; and the prohibition against exporting provisions appears to have been a measure founded in sound policy, lest proper supplies should be wanted, wherewith to supply our armies.</P>
<P>I have transmitted general Schuyler the resolves about the Indians, and the others on which he is to act; and have requested his strict attention and exertions in or∣der to their being carried into execution with all possible dispatch.</P>
<P>I note your request respecting Mr. Hancock. He shall have such directions as may be necessary for conducting
<PB N="157" REF="029737_0156_0FE2488B834802F8"/>
his office; and I am happy he will have so early a re∣mittance for paying the troops in his department.</P>
<P>The silver and paper money designed for Canada will be highly serviceable, and I hope will be the means of re∣establishing our credit there in some degree with the Can∣adians, and also encourage our men too, who have com∣plained in this instance. When it arrives, I will send it forward under a proper guard.</P>
<P>I have communicated to major-general Gates the re∣solve of Congress for him to repair to Canada, and di∣rected him to view Point-au-fer, that a fortress may be erected if he shall judge necessary. He is preparing for his command, and in a few days will take his departure for it. I would fain hope his arrival there will give our af∣fairs a complexion different from what they have worn for a long time past, and that many essential benefits will result from it.</P>
<P>The kind attention Congress have shewn to afford the commander-in-chief here every assistance, by resolving that recommendatory letters be written to the conventions of New-Jersey, New-York, and assembly of Connecticut, to authorize him to call in the militia in case of exigency, claims my thankful acknowledgments; and, I trust, if carried into execution, will produce many advantages in case it may be expedient at any time to call in early rein∣forcements. The delays incident to the ordinary mode may frequently render their aid too late, and prove ex∣ceedingly injurious.</P>
<P>I this evening received intelligence of the nineteenth instant from captain Pond, of the armed sloop Schuyler, of his having taken, about fifty miles from this, on the south side of Long-Island, a ship and a sloop bound to Sandy-Hook. The ship, from Glasgow, with a company of the forty-second regiment, had been taken by one of commodore Hopkins's fleet, who took the soldiers out, and ordered her to Rhode-Island; after which, she was retaken by the Cerberus, and put under the convoy of the sloop. As captain Pond informs me, there were five com∣missioned officers, two ladies, and four privates on board. They are not yet arrived at head-quarters. Inclosed is an invoice of what they have on board.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="029737_0157_0FE24839CD061370"/>
General Wooster having expressed an inclination and wish to wait on Congress, I have given him permission, not having any occasion for him here. He set out this morning.</P>
<P>I have been up to view the grounds about Kingsbridge, and find them to admit of several places well calculated for defence; and, esteeming it a pass of the utmost importance, have ordered works to be laid out, and shall direct part of the two battalions from Pennsylvania to set about the ex∣ecution immediately, and will add to their number several of the militia when they come in, to expedite them with all possible dispatch. Their consequence, as they will keep open the communication with the country, requires the most speedy completion of them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honoured with your favour of the nineteenth instant, with sundry resolves of Congress, which came to hand after I had closed mine of the twenti∣eth. I shall appoint a deputy muster-master-general as soon as I can fix upon a proper person for the office, and direct him immediately to repair to Canada.</P>
<P>Mr. Bennet, the bearer of this, delivered me a letter to-day from general Schuyler, inclosing the proceedings of the commissioners of Indian affairs at a meeting at Albany in consequence of the resolution of Congress (as they say) which I transmitted, the seventh instant, for engaging the Indians in our service. The gentlemen appear to me to have widely mistaken the views of Congress in this in∣stance, and to have formed a plan for engaging such Indians as were not in contemplation. I cannot account upon what principles they have gone, as a part of their proceed∣ings shews they are about to hold a conference with the Six Nations. I suppose they esteemed what they have done a necessary measure:—a copy of which I have the honour to inclose you.</P>
<P>I shall now beg leave to lay before Congress a proposi∣tion made to me by captain Leary of this city, in behalf
<PB N="159" REF="029737_0158_0FE2488E29708158"/>
of a body of men who are desirous of being employed in the continental service as a troop of horse, and at the same time to offer my opinion that such a corps may be ex∣tremely useful in many respects. In a march, they may be of the utmost service in reconnoitring the enemy and gaining intelligence, and have it in their power to render many important benefits. The terms on which they are willing to engage are inclosed, which appear to me mod∣erate and reasonable. I am also informed that another company might readily be made up, and most probably upon the same terms. I would therefore submit the pro∣priety and expediency of the measure to the consideration of Congress, and wish their opinion whether it will be agreeable to them that both or either of them should be formed and incorporated in this army, in manner as has been proposed by captain Leary, if it can be done.</P>

<P>I HEREWITH transmit you an extract of a letter from general Ward which came to hand by last night's post containing the agreeable intelligence of their having obliged the king's ships to leave Nantasket-road, and of two transports more being taken by our armed vessels, with two hundred and ten Highland troops on board.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="029737_0159_0FE2483C5614E4A0"/>
I sincerely wish the same success had attended our arms in another quarter—but it has not. In Canada, the situation of our affairs is truly alarming. The inclosed copies of generals Schuyler, Sullivan, and Arnold's letters will in∣form you that general Thompson has met with a repulse at Three-Rivers, and is now a prisoner in the hands of gen∣eral Burgoyne, who (these accounts say) is arrived with a considerable army. Nor do they seem to promise an end of our misfortunes here:—it is greatly to be feared that the next advices from thence will be, that our shattered, divided, and broken army (as you will see by the return) have been obliged to abandon the country, and retreat, to avoid a greater calamity,—that of being cut off or becom∣ing prisoners. I will have done upon the subject, and leave you to draw such conclusions as you conceive from the state of facts are most likely to result, only adding my apprehensions that one of the latter events,—either that they are cut off, or become prisoners,—has already happened, if they did not retreat while they had an oppor∣tunity. General Schuyler and general Arnold seem to think it extremely probable: and if it has taken place, it will not be easy to describe all the fatal consequences that may flow from it. At least our utmost exertions will be necessary, to prevent the advantages they have gained being turned to our greater misfortunes. General Gates will cer∣tainly set out to-morrow, and would have gone before now had he not expected to receive some particular instructions from Congress, which colonel Braxton said he imagined would be given, and transmitted here.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a copy of a letter from general Arnold, re∣specting some of the Indian tribes, to general Schuyler, and of a talk had at Albany with thirteen of the Oneidas. They seemed then to entertain a friendly disposition towards us, which I wish may not be changed by the misfortunes we have sustained in Canada.</P>

<P>I THIS morning received, by express, letters from generals Schuyler and Arnold, with a copy of one from
<PB N="161" REF="029737_0160_0FE2488FAE88B070"/>
general Sullivan to the former, and also of others to gener∣al Sullivan; of all which I do myself the honour to trans∣mit you copies. They will give you a further account of the melancholy situation of our affairs in Canada, and shew that there is nothing left to save our army there but evacu∣ating the country.</P>
<P>I am hopeful general Sullivan would retreat from the Isle-aux-noix without waiting for previous orders for that purpose; as, from generals Schuyler and Arnold's letters, it is much to be feared, by remaining there any considera∣ble time, his retreat would be cut off, or at least be a mat∣ter of extreme difficulty. I would observe to Congress that it is not in my power to send any carpenters from hence to build the gondolas and gallies general Arnold mentions, without taking them from a work equally necessary (if not more so) here, of the same kind:—and submit it to them whether it may not be adviseable (as it is of great import∣ance to us to have a number of those vessels on the Lake, to prevent the enemy's passing) to withdraw the carpenters for the present from the frigates building up the North-river, and detach them immediately, with all that can be got at Philadelphia, for that purpose and carrying on those here.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to inform you of another capture made by our armed vessels, of a transport, on the nine∣teenth instant, with a company of Highland grenadiers on board. The inclosed extract of a letter from general Ward, by last night's post, contains the particulars; to which I beg leave to refer you.</P>
<P>I have been honoured with your favours of the twenty-first and twenty-fifth instant in due order, with their im∣portant inclosures, to which I shall particularly attend. I have transmitted general Schuyler a copy of the resolve of Congress respecting the Mohickan and Stockbridge In∣dians, and directed him to put an immediate stop to the raising the two companies.</P>
<P>The quarter-master-general has been called upon for stopping the tents designed for Massachusetts-Bay, and or∣dered to forward them immediately. He means to write to Congress upon the subject, and hopes his conduct will
<PB N="162" REF="029737_0161_0FE2483DDBF132C0"/>
not appear to deserve their reprehension. Of this they will judge from his relation of the matter.</P>
<P>Being extremely desirous to forward the intelligence from Canada to Congress, well knowing their anxiety about our affairs there, I must defer writing upon some other matters I want to lay before them, until the next oppor∣tunity, which I hope will be to-morrow, when I will in∣form them fully upon the subject of rations, having desired the commissary-general to furnish me with some things necessary in that instance.</P>

<P>UPON information that major * * * was travelling through the country under suspicious circumstances, I thought it necessary to have him secured. I therefore sent after him. He was taken at South-Amboy, and brought up to New-York. Upon examination, he inform∣ed me that he came from New-Hampshire, the country of his usual abode, where he had left his family; and pre∣tended he was destined to Philadelphia on business with Congress.</P>
<P>As by his own confession he had crossed Hudson's∣river at New-Windsor, and was taken so far out of his proper and direct route to Philadelphia—this consideration, added to the length of time he had taken to perform his journey,—his being found in so suspicious a place as Am∣boy,—his unnecessary stay there on pretence of getting some baggage from New-York, and an expectation of re∣ceiving money from a person here, of bad character, and in no circumstances to furnish him out of his own stock,—the major's reputation, and his being a half-pay officer, have increased my jealousies about him.</P>
<P>The business, which he informs me he has with Con∣gress, is a secret offer of his services, to the end that, in case it should be rejected, he might have his way left open to an employment in the East-Indies, to which he is assigned: and in that case he flatters himself he will ob∣tain leave of Congress to go to Great-Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="029737_0162_0FE24891346957D8"/>
As he had been put upon his parole by Congress, I thought it would be improper to stay his progress to Phil∣adelphia, should he be in fact destined thither. I there∣fore send him forward, but (to prevent imposition) under the care of an officer, with letters found upon him, which, from their tenour, seem calculated to recommend him to Congress. I submit it to their consideration, whether it would not be dangerous to accept of the offer of his services.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the request of Congress contain∣ed in your favour of the twenty-fifth instant, and my prom∣ise of yesterday, I do myself the honour to inform you that the cost of a ration, according to the commissary-general's estimate, from the first of July to the first of December, will be from eight-pence to eight-pence halfpen∣ny, York currency.</P>
<P>Having discharged the obligation I was under in this instance, and finding that many applications have been made for victualling the flying camp, I would, with all possible deference, wish Congress to consider the matter well before they come to any determination upon it. Who the gentlemen are that have made offers upon this occasion, I know not: consequently my objections to their appointment cannot proceed from personal dislike; nor have I it in view to serve Mr. Trumbull the commissary-general, by wishing him to have the direction of the whole supplies for his emolument; because whatever rations are taken from him save him the trouble of supplying provis∣ions to the amount, without diminishing his pay,—that being fixed and certain:—but what influences me is a re∣gard to the public good. I am morally certain, if the business is taken out of Mr. Trumbull's hands and put in∣to another's, that it may and will in all probability be at∣tended with great and many inconveniences. It is likely, during the continuance of the war between us and Great-Britain, that the army here, or part of it, and the troops
<PB N="164" REF="029737_0163_0FE2483F6183A6A0"/>
composing the flying camp, will be frequently joined, and under the necessity of affording each other mutual aid. If this event is probable (and most certainly it is) the same confusion and disorder will result from having two com∣missaries, or one commissary and one contractor in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> army in the same department, as did between Mr. Trumbull and Mr. Livingston on the coming of the form∣er to New-York. I cannot discriminate the two cases; and not foreseeing that any good consequences will flow from the measure, but that many bad ones will,—such as clashing of interests,—a contention for stores, carriages,—and many other causes that might be mentioned if hurry of business would permit,—I confess I cannot perceive the propriety of appointing a different person, or any but the commissary.</P>
<P>I would also add, that few armies, if any, have been better supplied than the troops under Mr. Trumbull's care in this instance; which, I should suppose, ought to have considerable weight, especially as we have strong reasons to believe that a large share of the misfortunes our arms have sustained in Canada sprang from a want of proper and necessary supplies of provisions.</P>
<P>Mr. Trumbull too (I am informed) has already made provision in New-Jersey for the flying camp which will be stationed there, and employed proper persons in that colony to transact the business incident to his department, in obe∣dience to my orders, and in full confidence that it was to come under his management.</P>
<P>My great desire to see the affairs of this important post, on which so much depends, go on in an easy, smooth and uninterrupted course, has led me to say thus much upon the subject, and will, I hope, (if I am unhappy enough to differ in opinion with Congress) plead my excuse for the liberty I have taken.</P>
<P>I would also beg leave to mention to Congress the ne∣cessity there is of some new regulations being entered into, respecting the chaplains of this army. They will remem∣ber that applications were made to increase their pay, which was conceived too low for their support; and that it was proposed (if it could not be done for the whole) that the number should be lessened, and one be appointed
<PB N="165" REF="029737_0164_0FE2489B045F5AB0"/>
to two regiments, with an additional allowance. This latter expedient was adopted, and, while the army con∣tinued all together at one encampment, answered well, or at least did not produce many inconveniences. But the army now being differently circumstanced from what it then was,—part here, part at Boston, and a third part detached to Canada,—has introduced much confusion and disorder in this instance; nor do I know how it is possible to remedy the evil, but by affixing one to each regiment, with salaries competent to their support. No shifting, no change from one regiment to another can answer the pur∣pose; and in many cases it could never be done though the regiments should consent,—as where detachments are composed of unequal numbers, or ordered from different posts. Many more inconveniences might be pointed out: but these, it is presumed, will sufficiently shew the defect of the present establishment, and the propriety of an alter∣ation. What that alteration shall be, Congress will please to determine.</P>
<P>Congress, I doubt not, will have heard of the plot that was forming among many disaffected persons in this city and government for aiding the king's troops upon their arrival. No regular plan seems to have been digested: but several persons have been enlisted, and sworn to join them. The matter, I am in hopes, by a timely discovery, will be suppressed and put a stop to. Many citizens and others, among whom is the mayor, are now in confine∣ment. The matter has been traced up to governor Tryon; and the mayor appears to have been a principal agent, or go-between him and the persons concerned in it. The plot had been communicated to some of the army, and part of my guard engaged in it. T * * * H * * *, one of them, has been tried, and, by the unanimous opinion of a court-martial, is sentenced to die,—having enlisted himself, and engaged others. The sentence, by the advice of the whole council of general officers, will be put in execution to-day at eleven o'clock. The others are not tried. I am hopeful this example will produce many salutary con∣sequences, and deter others from entering into the like traitorous practices.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="029737_0165_0FE2484781692520"/>
The inclosed copy of a resolve of the provincial Con∣gress will shew that some of the disaffected on Long-Island have taken up arms. I have, agreeable to their request, sent a party after them, but have not as yet been able to apprehend them,—having concealed themselves in differ∣ent woods and morasses.</P>
<P>General Gates set out on Tuesday with a fine wind which has been fair ever since, and would soon arrive at Albany.</P>
<P>I this moment received a letter from lieutenant Davison, of the Schuyler armed sloop, a copy of which I have in-closed; to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelli∣gence communicated by him.</P>
<P>I could wish general Howe and his armament not to arrive yet, as not more than a thousand militia have yet come in, and our whole force (including the troops at all the detached posts, and on board the armed vessels, which are comprehended in our returns) is but small and incon∣siderable, when compared with the extensive lines they are to defend, and (most probably) the army that he brings. I have no further intelligence about him than what the lieutenant mentions: but it is extremely probable his ac∣counts and conjectures are true.</P>

<P>I was last night honoured with your favour of the twenty-sixth instant, and, agreeable to your request, shall pay proper attention to the resolves it inclosed.</P>
<P>I observe the augmentation Congress have resolved to make to the forces destined for the northern department, and the bounty to be allowed such soldiers as will enlist for three years. I hope many good consequences will re∣sult from these measures; and that, from the latter, a con∣siderable
<PB N="167" REF="029737_0166_0FE2489C88D8B988"/>
number of men may be induced to engage in the service.</P>
<P>I should esteem myself extremely happy to afford the least assistance to the Canada department in compliance with the desire of Congress and your requisition, were it in my power: but it is not. The return which I trans∣mitted yesterday will but too well convince Congress of my incapacity in this instance, and point out to them that the force I now have is trifling, considering the many and important posts that are necessary, and must be supported, if possible. But few militia have yet come in, the whole being about twelve hundred, including the two battalions of this city, and one company from the Jersies. I wish the delay may not be attended with disagreeable conse∣quences, and their aid may not come too late, or when it may not be wanted. I have wrote, I have done every thing I could, to call them in: but they have not come, though I am told that they are generally willing.</P>
<P>The accounts communicated yesterday through lieuten∣ant Davison's letter are partly confirmed, and, I dare say, will turn out to be true on the whole. For two or three days past, three or four ships have been dropping in; and I just now received an express from an officer appointed to keep a look-out on Staten-Island, that forty-five arrived at the Hook to-day:—some say more; and I suppose the whole fleet will be in, within a day or two. I am hope∣ful, before they are prepared to attack, that I shall get some reinforcements. Be that as it may, I shall attempt to make the best disposition I can of our troops, in order to give them a proper reception, and to prevent the ruin and destruction they are meditating against us.</P>
<P>As soon as the express arrived last night, I sent the let∣ters for the northern colonies to the quarter-master-general, with orders to forward them immediately.</P>
<P>When monsieur Wiebert comes, (I have not seen him yet) I shall employ him as Congress have directed. The terms upon which he offers his service seem to promise something from him. I wish he may answer, and be skill∣ed in the business he says he is acquainted with.</P>

<P>I HAD the pleasure of receiving your favour of the twenty-ninth early this morning, with which you have been pleased to honour me, together with the resolves for a fur∣ther augmentation of our army.</P>
<P>The battalion of Germans, which Congress have order∣ed to be raised, will be a corps of much service; and I am hopeful that such persons will be appointed officers, as will complete their enlistments with all possible expedition.</P>
<P>I shall communicate to colonel Stevenson and one of his field-officers what you have requested, and direct them to re∣pair immediately to Philadelphia. It is an unlucky cir∣cumstance that the term of enlistment of these three com∣panies, and of the rifle battalion, should expire at this time when a hot campaign is, in all probability, about to com∣mence.</P>
<P>Canada, it is certain, would have been an important ac∣quisition, and well worth the expenses incurred in the pur∣suit of it. But as we could not reduce it to our possession, the retreat of our army with so little loss, under such a va∣riety of distresses, must be esteemed a most fortunate event. It is true, the accounts we have received do not fully au∣thorise us to say that we have sustained no loss: but they hold forth a probable ground for such conclusion. I am anxious to hear it confirmed.</P>
<P>I have the honour of transmitting you an extract of a letter received last night from general Ward. If the scheme the privateers had in view, and the measures he had planned, have been carried into execution, the Highland corps will be tolerably well disposed of: but I fear the for∣tunate event has not taken place.</P>
<P>In general Ward's letter, was inclosed one from lieuten∣ant-colonel Campbell, who was made prisioner with the Highland troops. I have transmitted you a copy. This will give you a full and exact account of the number of prisoners that were on board the four transports; and will prove, beyond a possibility of doubt, that the evacuation of Boston by the British troops was a matter neither known nor expected when he received his orders. Indeed so

many facts had concurred before to settle the matter, that no additional proofs were necessary.</P>
<P>When I had the honour of addressing you yesterday, I had only been informed of the arrival of forty-five of the fleet in the morning. Since that, I have received authentic in∣telligence from sundry persons (among them, from general Greene) that a hundred and ten sail came in before night, that were counted, and that more were seen about dusk in the offing. I have no doubt but the whole that sailed from Halifax are now at the Hook.</P>
<P>Just as I was about to conclude my letter, I received one from a gentleman upon the subject of calling the five regiments from Boston to the defence of Canada or New-York, and to have militia raised in their lieu. I have sent you a copy, and shall only observe, that I know the author well: his hand-writing is quite familiar to me: he is a member of the General Court, very sensible, of great influ∣ence, and a warm and zealous friend to the cause of Amer∣ica. The expedient proposed by him is submitted to Con∣gress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you, and on the same day, several ships more arrived within the Hook, making the number that came in then a hundred and ten; and there remains no doubt of the whole of the fleet from Halifax being now here. Yesterday evening fifty of them came up the bay and anchored on the Staten-Island side. Their views I cannot precisely determine; but am ex∣tremely apprehensive, as part of them only came, that they mean to surround the island, and secure the stock upon it. I had consulted with a committee of the provincial Con∣gress upon the subject, before the arrival of the fleet; and they appointed a person to superintend the business, and to drive the stock off. I also wrote to brigadier-general Heard, and directed him to the measure lest it might be neglected; but am fearful it has not been effected.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="029737_0169_0FE2484B9037FE28"/>
Our reinforcement of militia is yet but small:—I can∣not ascertain the amount, not having got a return. How∣ever, I trust, if the enemy make an attack, they will meet with a repulse, as I have the pleasure to inform you that an agreeable spirit and willingness for action seem to animate and pervade the whole of our troops.</P>
<P>As it is difficult to determine what objects the enemy may have in contemplation, and whether they may not detach some part of their force to Amboy, and to ravage that part of the country, if not extend their views farther, I submit it to Congress whether it may not be expedient for them to repeat and press home their requests to the different governments that are to provide men for the fly∣ing camp, to furnish their quotas with all possible dis∣patch. It is a matter of great importance, and will be of serious consequence, to have the camp established in case the enemy should be able to possess themselves of this river, and cut off the supplies of troops that might be nec∣essary on certain emergencies to be sent from hence.</P>
<P>I must entreat your attention to an application I made some time ago for flints. We are extremely deficient in this necessary article, and shall be greatly distressed if we cannot obtain a supply. Of lead we have a sufficient quantity for the whole campaign, taken off the houses here.</P>
<P>Esteeming it of infinite advantage to prevent the enemy from getting fresh provisions, and horses for their waggons, artillery, &amp;c, I gave orders to a party of our men on Staten-Island (since writing to general Heard) to drive the stock off without waiting for the assistance or direction of the committees there, lest their slow mode of transacting business might produce too much delay;—and have sent this morning to know what they have done. I am this morning informed by a gentleman, that the committee of Elizabeth-Town sent their company of light-horse on Mon∣day to effect it, and that some of their militia were to give their aid yesterday. He adds that he was credibly told last night by a party of the militia coming to this place, that yesterday they saw a good deal of stock driving off the
<PB N="171" REF="029737_0170_0FE2489F92DBE950"/>

<P>THIS will be handed to you by colonel Stevenson, whom I have ordered, with the captains of the two rifle companies from Maryland, to wait on Congress. They will point out such measures as they conceive most likely to advance the raising of the new rifle battalion, and the persons they think worthy of promotion, that have served in the three companies here, agreeable to the inclosed list.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour to address you on the thirtieth ultimo, I transmitted a copy of a letter I had re∣ceived from a gentleman, a member of the honourable Gen∣eral Court, <HI>[of Massachusetts]</HI> suggesting the improbability of succours coming from thence in any reasonable time, either for the defence of this place, or to reinforce our troops engaged in the Canada expedition. I am sorry to inform you, that, from a variety of intelligence, his appre∣hensions appear to be just, and to be fully confirmed: nor have I reason to expect but that the supplies from the other two governments, Connecticut and New-Hampshire, will be extremely slow and greatly deficient in number.</P>
<P>As it now seems beyond question, and clear to demon∣stration, that the enemy mean to direct their operations
<PB N="172" REF="029737_0171_0FE2484D14DD1850"/>
and bend their most vigorous efforts against this colony, and will attempt to unite their two armies,—that under general Burgoyne, and the one arrived here,—I cannot but think the expedient proposed by that gentleman is ex∣ceedingly just; and that the continental regiments, now in the Massachusetts-Bay, should be immediately called from thence, and be employed where there is the strongest rea∣son to believe their aid will be indispensably necessary. The expediency of the measure I shall submit to the con∣sideration of Congress, and will only observe, as my opin∣ion, that there is not the most distant prospect of an at∣tempt being made, where they now are, by the enemy; and, if there should, that the militia that can be assembled upon the shortest notice will be more than equal to repel it. They are well armed, resolute, and determined, and will instantly oppose any invasion that may be made in their own colony.</P>
<P>I shall also take the liberty again to request Congress to interest themselves in having the militia raised and for∣warded with all possible expedition, as fast as any consid∣erable number of them can be collected, that are to com∣pose the flying camp. This I mentioned in my letter yes∣terday, but think proper to repeat it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing more and more convinced of the necessity. The camp will be in the neighbourhood of Amboy: and I shall be glad that the conventions, or committees of safety, of those governments from whence they come, may be requested to give me previous notice of their marching, that I may form some plan, and direct provision to be made for their reception.</P>
<P>The disaffection of the people at that place and others not far distant is exceedingly great; and, unless it is checked and overawed, it may become more general, and be very alarming. The arrival of the enemy will encour∣age it. They, or at least a part of them, are already land∣ed on Staten-Island, which is quite contiguous; and about four thousand were marching about it yesterday, as I have been advised, and are leaving no arts un-essayed to gain the inhabitants to their side, who seem but too favourably disposed. It is not unlikely that in a little time they may attempt to cross to the Jersey side, and induce many to
<PB N="173" REF="029737_0172_0FE248A69A860DE8"/>
join them, either from motives of interest or fear, unless there is a force to oppose them.</P>
<P>As we are fully convinced that the ministerial army we shall have to oppose this campaign will be great and numer∣ous, and well know that the utmost industry will be used, as it already has been, to excite the savages and every body of people to arms against us whom they can influence, it certainly behoves us to strain every nerve to counteract their designs. I would therefore submit it to Congress, whether (especially as our schemes for employing the west∣ern Indians do not seem to be attended with any great prospect of success, from general Schuyler's accounts) it may not be adviseable to take measures to engage those of the eastward, the St. John's, Nova-Scotia, Penobscot, &amp;c. in our favour. I have been told that several might be got, perhaps five or six hundred or more, readily to join us. If they can, I should imagine it ought to be done. It will prevent our enemies from securing their friendship; and further they will be of infinite service in annoying and harassing them, should they ever attempt to penetrate the country. Congress will be pleased to consider the measure: and if they determine to adopt it, I conceive it will be necessary to authorise and request the General Court of the Massachusetts-Bay to carry it into execution. Their situation and advantages will enable them to negociate a treaty and an alliance better than it can be done by any persons else.</P>
<P>I have been honoured with your two favours of the first instant; and, agreeable to the wishes of Congress, shall put monsieur Wiebert in the best place I can to prove his abilities in the art he professes. I shall send him up imme∣diately to the works erecting towards Kingsbridge under the discretion of general Mifflin, whom I shall request to employ him.</P>
<P>I this moment received a letter from general Greene, an extract of which I have inclosed. The intelligence it contains is of the most important nature, and evinces the necessity of the most spirited and vigorous exertions on our part.</P>
<P>The expectation of the fleet under admiral Howe is cer∣tainly the reason the army already come have not begun
<PB N="174" REF="029737_0173_0FE248569C2BAF68"/>
their hostile operations. When that arrives, we may look for the most interesting events, and such as, in all probabil∣ity, will have considerable weight in the present contest. It behoves us to be prepared in the best manner: and I submit it again to Congress, whether the accounts given by their prisoners do not shew the propriety of calling the sev∣eral continental regiments from the Massachusetts govern∣ment, raising the flying camp with all possible dispatch, and engaging the eastern Indians.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 5.—General Mercer arrived here on Tuesday, and, the next morning, was ordered to Paulus-Hook to make some arrangements of the militia as they came in, and the best disposition he could to prevent the enemy cross∣ing from Staten-Island, if they should have any such views. The distressed situation of the inhabitants of Elizabeth-Town and Newark has since induced me, upon their appli∣cation, to give up all the militia from the Jersies, except those engaged for six months. I am hopeful they will be able to repel any incursions that may be attempted. Gen∣erals Mercer and Livingston are concerting plans for that purpose. By a letter from the latter last night, I am in∣formed the enemy are throwing up small works at all the passes on the north side of Staten-Island, which it is prob∣able they mean to secure.</P>
<P>None of the Connecticut militia are yet arrived: so that the reinforcement we have received is very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>A letter from general Schuyler, with sundry inclosures, (of which N<SUP>o</SUP> 1, 2 and 3 are exact copies) this moment came to hand, and will no doubt claim, as it ought to do, the immediate attention of Congress. The evils which must inevitably follow a disputed command, are too obvi∣ous and alarming to admit a moment's delay in your deci∣sion thereupon: and, although I do not presume to advise in a matter, now, of this delicacy, yet as it appears evi∣dent that the northern army has retreated to Crown-Point, and mean to act upon the defensive only, I cannot help giving it as my opinion that one of the major-gener∣als in that quarter would be more usefully employed here, or in the flying camp, than there: for it becomes my du∣ty to observe, if another experienced officer is taken from hence in order to command the flying camp, that your
<PB N="175" REF="029737_0174_0FE248A92F3795E0"/>
grand army will be entirely stripped of generals who have seen service,—being in a manner already destitute of such. My distress on this account,—the appointment of general Whitcomb to the eastern regiments,—a convic∣tion in my own breast that no troops will be sent to Bos∣ton,—and the certainty of a number coming to this place,—occasioned my postponing, from time to time, sending any general officer from hence to the eastward heretofore: and now I shall wait the sentiments of Congress relative to the five regiments in Massachusetts-Bay, before I do any thing in this matter.</P>
<P>The commissary-general has been with me this morning concerning the other matter contained in general Schuy∣ler's letter respecting the business of that department. He has, I believe, (in order to remove difficulties) re∣called Mr. Avery, but seems to think it necessary in that case that Mr. Livingston should be left to himself, as he cannot be responsible for persons not of his own appoint∣ment. This matter should also be clearly defined by Congress. I have already given my opinion of the ne∣cessity of these matters being under one general direction, in so full and clear a manner, that I shall not take up the time of Congress to repeat it in this place.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favours of the fourth and sixth instant, which came duly to hand, with their important inclosures.</P>
<P>I perceive that Congress have been employed in delib∣erating on measures of the most interesting nature. It is certain that it is not with us to determine in many in∣stances what consequences will flow from our councils: but yet it behoves us to adopt such, as, under t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> smiles of a gracious and all-kind Providence, will be most likely to promote our happiness. I trust the late decisive part they have taken is calculated for that end, and will secure us that freedom and those privileges, which have been and are refused us, contrary to the voice of nature and the British constitution. Agreeable to the request of Congress, I caused "THE DECLARATION" to be proclaimed before all the army under my immediate com∣mand; and have the pleasure to inform them that the measure seemed to have their most hearty assent,—the ex∣pressions and behaviour, both of officers and men, testify∣ing their warmest approbation of it. I have transmitted a copy to general Ward at Boston, requesting him to have it proclaimed to the continental troops in that de∣partment.</P>
<P>It is with great pleasure that I hear the militia from Maryland, the Delaware government, and Pennsylvania, will be in motion every day to form the flying camp. It is of great importance, and should be accomplished with all possible dispatch. The readiness and alacrity with which the committee of safety of Pennsylvania and the other conferees have acted in order to forward the asso∣ciated militia of that State to the Jersies for service till the men to compose the flying camp arrive, strongly ev∣idence their regard to the common cause, and that noth∣ing on their part will be wanting to support it. I hope, and I doubt not, that the associated militia, impressed with the expediency of the measure, will immediately carry it into execution, and furnish in this instance a proof of the continuance of that zeal which has so eminently marked their conduct. I have directed the commissary
<PB N="177" REF="029737_0176_0FE248AAB3A6A418"/>
to make the necessary provision for their reception, who will also supply the army for the flying camp with rations. A proper officer will be appointed to command it.</P>
<P>In pursuance of the power given me by Congress, and the advice of my general officers, I have wrote to general Ward, and desired him forthwith to detach three of the fullest regiments from the Massachusetts-Bay to join the northern army,—esteeming it a matter of the greatest im∣portance to have a sufficient force there to prevent the en∣emy passing the Lake and making an impression in that quarter. The gondolas and gallies will be of great ser∣vice; and I am hopeful the carpenters you have sent from Philadelphia, and that will go from the eastward on your application, will be able to build a sufficient number in time to answer every exigency.</P>
<P>I have requested governor Cooke, if the duck men∣tioned in Mr. Greene's letter is proper for tents, to have it made up as early as possible, and forwarded here. I have also desired him to send the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lints and small arms, as I have general Ward those of the latter that were tak∣en out of the Scotch transports,—our deficiency in these necessary articles being still great.</P>
<P>Observing that Congress have particularly mentioned a bounty of ten dollars, to be paid to men of some corps directed to be raised in two or three instances since their resolve of the twenty-sixth of June, allowing such boun∣ty, I have been led to doubt how that resolve is to be construed; whether it is a general regulation, and ex∣tends to all men that will engage for three years,—for in∣stance, the soliders of the present army, if they will en∣list for that time. If it is, and extends to them, it will be necessary to forward a large sum of money: many per∣haps would engage.</P>
<P>I also observe, by their resolve of the twenty-fifth of June for raising four regiments of militia in the eastern governments to augment the troops in the northern de∣partment, that the assemblies of those governments are em∣powered to appoint paymasters to the said regiments. This appears to me a regulation of great use, and I could wish that it was made general, and one allowed to eve∣ry
<PB N="178" REF="029737_0177_0FE24859F30C2938"/>
regiment in the service. Many advantages would re∣sult from it.</P>
<P>The Connecticut militia begin to come in: but from every account the battalions will be very incomplete, owing, they say, to the busy season of the year. That government, lest any inconvenience might result from their militia not being here in time, ordered three regi∣ments of their light-horse to my assistance, part of which have arrived. But, not having the means to support them (and, if it could be done, the expense would be enormous) I have thanked the gentlemen for their zeal, and the at∣tachment they have manifested upon this occasion, and informed them that I cannot consent to their keeping their horses,—at the same time wishing them to stay themselves. I am told they or part of them mean to do so.</P>
<P>General Mercer is now in the Jersies, for the purpose of receiving and ordering the militia coming for the flying camp: and I have sent over our chief engineer to view the ground within the neighbourhood of Amboy, and to lay out some necessary works for the encampment, and such as may be proper at the different passes in Bergen-Neck, and other places on the Jersey shore opposite Staten-Island, to prevent the enemy making impres∣sions, and committing depredations on the property of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The intelligence we have from a few deserters that have come over to us, and from others, is that general Howe has between nine and ten thousand men, who are chiefly landed on the island, posted in different parts, and securing the several communications from the Jersies with small works and intrenchments, to prevent our people from paying them a visit;—that the islanders have all joined them, seem well disposed to favour their cause, and have agreed to take up arms in their behalf. They look for admiral Howe's arrival every day with his fleet and a large reinforcement; are in high spirits, and talk confi∣dently of success, and carrying all before them when he comes. I trust, through divine favour and our own exer∣tions, they will be disappointed in their views: and, at all events, any advantages they may gain will cost them
<PB N="179" REF="029737_0178_0FE248AC35F33010"/>
very dear. If our troops will behave well (which I hope will be the case, having every thing to contend for that freemen hold dear) they will have to wade through much blood and slaughter before they can carry any part of our works, if they carry them at all,—and, at best, be in pos∣session of a melancholy and mournful victory. May the sacredness of our cause inspire our soldiery with sentiments of heroism, and lead them to the performance of the no∣blest exploits!—</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured with your favour of the eighth in∣stant by yesterday morning's post, with the several resolves to which you referred my attention. I shall duly regard them, and attempt their execution as far as I am able.</P>
<P>By virtue of the discretionary power that Congress were pleased to vest me with, and by advice of such of my gen∣eral officers as I have had an opportunity of consulting, I have ordered the two remaining continental regiments in the Massachusetts-Bay to march immediately for the defence of this place, in full confidence that nothing hostile will be attempted against that State in the present campaign.</P>
<P>I have wrote to the General Court of Massachusetts-Bay, and transmitted a copy of the resolve for employing the eastern Indians, entreating their good offices in this instance, and their exertions to have them forthwith engaged and marched to join this army. I have desired five or six hun∣dred of them to be enlisted for two or three years, if they will consent to it,—subject to an earlier discharge if it shall be thought necessary,—and upon the same terms as the con∣tinental troops, if better cannot be had,—though I am hopeful they may.</P>
<P>In my letter of yesterday, I mentioned the arrival of part of the Connecticut light-horse to assist in the defence of this place, and my objection to their horses being kept. Four or five hundred of them are now come in; and, in justice to their zeal and laudable attachment to the cause of
<PB N="180" REF="029737_0179_0FE2485B76CF6EE0"/>
their country, I am to inform you that they have consented to stay as long as occasion may require, though they should be at the expense of maintaining their horses themselves. They have pastured them out about the neighbourhood of Kingsbridge (being unwilling to send them away) at the rate of half a dollar per week each, meaning to leave in en∣tirely with Congress either to allow or refuse it, as they shall judge proper. I promised to make this representation and thought it my duty; and will only observe that the motives which induced them at first to set out were good and praise-worthy, and were, to afford the most speedy and early succour, which they apprehended would be wanted before the militia arrived. Their services may be extreme∣ly important,—being most of them, if not all, men of rep∣utation and of property.</P>
<P>The subject of the inclosed copy of a letter from gover∣nor Trumbull I beg leave to submit to the consideration of Congress. They will perceive from his representation the disquieting apprehensions that have seized on the minds of the people since the retreat of the northern army, and how exposed the northern frontiers of New-York and New-Hampshire are to the ravages and incursions of the Indians. How far it may be expedient to raise the battalion he con∣ceives necessary to prevent the calamities and distresses he points out, they will determine, upon what he has said, and the necessity that may appear to them for the measure;—what I have done, being only to lay the matter before them in compliance with his wishes.</P>
<P>I have also inclosed a memorial from the surgeons'-mates, setting forth the inadequacy of their pay to their ser∣vices and maintenance, and praying that it may be increas∣ed. I shall observe that they have a long time complained in this instance, and that some additional allowance may not be unnecessary.</P>
<P>As I am truly sensible the time of Congress is much taken up with a variety of important matters, it is with un∣willingness and pain I ever repeat a request after having once made it, or take the liberty of enforcing any opinion of mine after it is once given: but as the establishing of some office for auditing accounts is a matter of exceeding importance to the public interest, I would beg leave once
<PB N="181" REF="029737_0180_0FE248B601610ED0"/>
mere to call the attention of Congress to an appointment competent to the purpose. Two motives induce me to urge the matter; first, a conviction of the utility of the meas∣ure—secondly, that I may stand exculpated if hereafter it should appear that money has been improperly expended, and necessaries for the army obtained upon unreasonable terms.</P>
<P>For me, whose time is employed from the hour of my rising till I retire to bed again, to go into an examination of the accounts of such an army as this with any degree of precision and exactness, without neglecting other matters of equal importance, is utterly impracticable. All that I have been able to do (and that, in fact, was doing nothing) was, when the commissary, and quarter-master, and director-general of the hospital (for it is to these the great advances are made) applied for warrants,—to make them at times produce a general account of their expenditures. But this answers no valuable purpose. It is the minutiae that must be gone into,—the propriety of each charge examined,—the vouchers looked into;—and, with respect to the com∣missary-general, his victualling returns and expenditures of provisions should be compared with his purchases: other∣wise a person in this department, if he was inclined to be knavish, might purchase large quantities with the public money, and fell one half of it again for private emolument; and yet his accounts upon paper would appear fair, and be supported with vouchers for every charge.</P>
<P>I do not urge this matter from a suspicion of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfair practices in either of the departments before mentioned; and sorry should I be if this construction was put upon it, having a high opinion of the honour and integrity of these gentlemen. But there should nevertheless be some con∣trol as well upon their discretion as honesty:—to which may be added, that accounts become perplexed and con∣fused by long standing, and the errors therein not so dis∣coverable as if they underwent an early revision and exam∣ination. I am well apprised that a treasury-office of ac∣counts has been resolved upon, and an auditor-general for settling all public accounts: but, with all deference and submission to the opinion of Congress, these institutions are not calculated to prevent the inconveniences I have men∣tioned;
<PB N="182" REF="029737_0181_0FE248629C6D6B88"/>
nor can they be competent to the purposes, circum∣stanced as they are.</P>
<P>We have intelligence from a deserter that came to us, that on Wednesday morning the Asia, Chatham, and Grey∣hound men-of-war weighed anchor, and (it was said) in∣tended to pass up the North-river above the city, to pre∣vent the communication with the Jersies. They did not attempt it, nor does he know what prevented them. A prisoner belonging to the tenth regiment, taken yesterday, informs that they hourly expected admiral Howe and his fleet. He adds that a vessel has arrived from them, and the prevailing opinion is, that an attack will be ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> im∣mediately on their arrival.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, I am informed that the small-pox has broke out at Boston, and infected some of the troops. I have wrote to him to place the invalids under an officer, to remain till they are well; and to use every possible precaution to prevent the troops from thence bringing the infection. The distresses and calam∣ities we have already suffered by this disorder in one part of our army, I hope, will excite his utmost care that they may not be increased.</P>

<P>The design of this is to inform Congress, that, about half after three o'clock this evening, two of the enemy's ships of war, one of forty and the other of twenty guns, with three tenders, weighed anchor in the bay opposite Staten-Island, and, availing themselves of a brisk and fa∣vourable breeze, with a flowing tide, ran past our batteries up the North-river, without receiving any certain damage that I could perceive, notwithstanding a heavy and inces∣sant cannonade was kept up from our several batteries here, as well as from that at Paulus-Hook. They, on their part, returned and continued the fire as they ran by. I dispatched an express to brigadier-general Mifflin, at our encampment towards the upper end of the island;

but have not heard whether they have got by, or received any damage.</P>
<P>The account transmitted by this morning's post, re∣specting the arrival of one of the fleet, seems to be confirm∣ed. Several ships have come in to-day: among them, one this evening, with a Saint-George's flag at her fore-top-mast-head, which we conclude to be admiral Howe, from the circumstance of the flag, and the several and gen∣eral salutes that were paid. It is probable they will all arrive in a day or two, and immediately begin their ope∣rations.</P>
<P>As it will be extremely necessary that the flying camp should be well provided with powder and ball, and it may be impracticable to send supplies from hence on account of our hurry and engagements, (besides, the communication may be uncertain) I must beg the attention of Congress to this matter, and request that they will forward with all possible expedition such a quantity of musket-powder and lead, (if balls of different sizes cannot be had) as will be sufficient for the militia to compose that camp.</P>
<P>By an express this minute arrived from general Mifflin, the ships have passed his works.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My last of Friday evening, which I had the honour of addressing you, advised that two of the enemy's ships of war and three tenders had run above our batteries here and the works at the upper end of the island. I am now to inform you, that, yesterday forenoon, receiving intelli∣gence from general Mifflin that they had passed the Tap∣pan-Sea, and were trying to proceed higher up,—by advice of R. R. Livingston, esquire, and other gentlemen, I dis∣patched expresses to general Clinton of Ulster, and the committee of safety for Duchess-county, to take measures for securing the passes in the Highlands, lest they might have designs of seizing them, and have a force concealed
<PB N="184" REF="029737_0183_0FE2486567F5F330"/>
for the purpose. I wrote the evening before to the com∣manding officer of the two garrisons there to be vigilant and prepared against any attempts they or any disaffected persons might make against them, and to forward expres∣ses all the way to Albany, that provision and other vessels might be secured and prevented falling into their hands.</P>
<P>The information given general Mifflin was rather pre∣mature, as to their having gone past the Sea. A letter from the committee of Orange-county, which came to hand this morning, says they were there yesterday, and that a regiment of their militia was under arms, to prevent their landing and making an incursion. The messenger who brought it, and to whom it refers for particulars, adds that a party of them, in two or three boats, had approach∣ed the shore, but were forced back by our people firing at them. Since the manoeuvre of Friday, there have been no other movements in the fleet.</P>
<P>General Sullivan, in a letter of the second instant, in∣forms me of his arrival with the army at Crown-Point, where he is fortifying and throwing up works. He adds that he has secured all the stores except three cannon left at Chamblee, which in part is made up by taking a fine twelve-pounder out of the Lake. The army is sickly,—many with the small-pox; and he is apprehensive the militia, ordered to join them, will not escape the infection. An officer he had sent to reconnoitre had reported that he saw at Saint John's about a hundred and fifty tents,—twenty at Saint Roy's, and fifteen at Chamblee; and works at the first were busily carrying on.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a general return of the army here, which will shew the whole of our strength. All the detached posts are included.</P>
<P>A letter from the eastward, by last night's post, to Mr. Hazard, post-master in this city, advises that two ships had been taken and carried into Cape-Ann,—one from Antigua, consigned to general Howe, with four hundred and thirty-nine puncheons of rum,—the other a Jamaica∣man, with four hundred hogsheads of sugar, two hundred puncheons of rum, thirty-nine bales of cotton, pimento, fustic, &amp;c. &amp;c. Each mounted two guns, six-pounders.</P>
<P>About three o'clock this afternoon I was informed that
<PB N="185" REF="029737_0184_0FE248B941388000"/>
a flag from lord Howe was coming up, and waited with two of our whale-boats, until directions should be given. I immediately convened such of the general officers as were not upon other duty, who agreed in opinion that I ought not to receive any letter directed to me as a private gentleman: but if otherwise, and the officer desired to come up to deliver the letter himself, as was suggested, he should come under a safe-conduct. Upon this, I directed colonel Reed to go down and manage the affair under the above general instruction.</P>
<P>On his return, he informed me, that, after the common civilities, the officer acquainted him that he had a letter from lord Howe to Mr. Washington, which he shewed un∣der a superscription, <HI>"To George Washington, esquire."</HI> Colonel Reed replied there was no such person in the ar∣my, and that a letter intended for the general could not be received under such a direction. The officer expressed great concern,—said it was a letter rather of a civil than military nature,—that lord Howe regretted he had not ar∣rived sooner,—that he (lord Howe) had great powers. The anxiety to have the letter received was very evident, though the officer disclaimed all knowledge of its contents. However, colonel Reed's instructions being positive, they parted. After they had got some distance, the officer with the flag again put about, and asked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der what direc∣tion Mr. Washington chose to be addressed:—to which colonel Reed answered, his station was well known, and that certainly they could be at no loss how to direct to him. The officer said they knew it and lamented it; and again repeated his wish that the letter could be received. Colonel Reed told him a proper direction would obviate all difficulties, and that this was no new matter,—this sub∣ject having been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully discussed in the course of the last year; of which lord Howe could not be ignorant:—upon which they parted.</P>
<P>I would not upon any occasion sacrifice essentials to punc∣tilio: but in this instance, the opinion of others concurring with my own, I deemed it a duty to my country and my appointment, to insist upon that respect, which, in any oth∣er than a public view, I would willingly have waved. Nor do I doubt, but, from the supposed nature of the message,
<PB N="186" REF="029737_0185_0FE24866ED15F630"/>
and the anxiety expressed, they will ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her repeat their flag, or fall upon some mode to communicate the import and <HI>[contents]</HI> of it.</P>
<P>I have been duly honoured with your two letters, that of the tenth by Mr. Anderson,—and the eleventh, with its inclosures. I have directed the quarter-master to pro∣vide him with every thing he wants to carry his scheme in∣to execution. It is an important one, and I wish it suc∣cess; but am doubtful that it will be better in theory than practice.</P>
<P>The passage of the ships of war and tenders up the river is a matter of great importance, and has excited much con∣jecture and speculation. To me two things have occurred, as leading them to this proceeding,—first a design to seize on the narrow passes on both sides of the river, giving almost the only land-communication with Albany, and of conse∣quence with our northern army; for which purpose they might have troops concealed on board, which they deemed competent of themselves, as the defiles are narrow,—or that they would be joined by many disaffected persons in that quarter. Others have added a probability of their having a large quantity of arms on board, to be in readi∣ness to put into the hands of the tories immediately on the arrival of the fleet, or rather at the time they intend to make their attack. The second is, to cut off entirely all intercourse between this and Albany by water, and the up∣per country, and to prevent supplies of every kind going and coming.</P>
<P>These matters are truly alarming, and of such importance that I have wrote to the provincial Congress of New-York, and recommended to their serious consideration the adoption of every possible expedient to guard against the two first; and have suggested the propriety of their employing the militia, or some part of them, in the counties in which these defiles are, to keep the enemy from possessing them, till further provision can be made; and to write to the sev∣eral leading persons on our side in that quarter, to be atten∣tive to all the movements of the ships and the disaffected, in order to discover and frustrate whatever pernicious schemes they have in view.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="029737_0186_0FE1BFA1EEDB29B8"/>
In respect to the second conjecture of my own, and which seems to be generally adopted, I have the pleasure to in∣form Congress, that, if their design is to keep the armies from provision, the commissary has told me upon inquiry, he has forwarded supplies to Albany (now there, and above it) sufficient for ten thousand men for four months; that he has a sufficiency here for twenty thousand men for three months, and an abundant quantity secured in differ∣ent parts of the Jersies for the flying camp, besides having about four thousand barrels of flour in some neighbouring part of Connecticut. Upon this head, there is but little occasion for any apprehensions, at least for a considerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me.</P>

<P>THIS will be handed you by Mr. Griffin, who has also taken upon him the charge and delivery of two pack∣ets containing sundry letters which were sent to Amboy yesterday by a flag, and forwarded to me to-day by gen∣eral Mercer. The letter addressed to governor Franklin came open to my hands.</P>
<P>I was this morning h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oured with yours of the thir∣teenth instant, with its important and necessary inclosures; and, in obedience to the commands of Congress, have transmitted general Howe the resolves intended for him. Those for general Burgoyne I inclosed and sent to gen∣eral Schuyler, with directions immediately to forward them to him.</P>
<P>The inhuman treatment of the whole, and murder of part of our people, after their surrender and capitulation, was certainly a flagrant violation of that faith which ought to be held sacred by all civilized nations, and founded in the most savage barbarity. It highly deserved the severest reprobation; and I trust the spirited measures Congress have adopted upon the occasion will prevent the like in

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honoured with yours of the fifteenth instant, with sundry resolves.</P>
<P>I perceive the measures Congress have taken to expe∣dite the raising of the flying camp, and providing it with articles of the greatest use. You will see by a postscript to my letter of the fourteenth, I had wrote to the com∣manding officer of the Pennsylvania militia, ordering them to be marched from Trenton to Amboy, as their remain∣ing there could not answer the least public good. For, having consulted with sundry gentlemen, I was informed, if the enemy mean to direct their views towards Pennsyl∣vania or penetrate the Jersies, their route will be from near Amboy, and either by way of Brunswic or Bound-brook,—the lower road from South-Amboy being through a woody, sandy country. Besides, they will be then able to throw in succour here, and to receive it from hence in cases of emergency.</P>
<P>The Connecticut light-horse, mentioned in my letter of the eleventh, notwithstanding their then promise to continue here for the defence of this place, are now dis∣charged, and about to return home,—having peremptorily refused all kind of fatigue duty, or even to mount guard, claiming an exemption as troopers. Though their assist∣ance is much needed, and might be of essential service in case of an attack, yet I judged it adviseable, on their ap∣plication and claim of such indulgences, to discharge them; as granting them would set an example to others, and might produce many ill consequences. The number of men included in the last return, by this, is lessened about five hundred.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="029737_0188_0FE248C45B759A20"/>
I last night received a letter from general Schuyler, with several inclosures, copies of which I have herewith transmitted. They will give Congress every information I have respecting our northern army and the situation of our affairs in that quarter;—to which I beg leave to re∣fer their attention. I cannot but express my surprise at the scarcity of provision which general Schuyler mentions, after what the commissary assured me, and which formed a part of my letter of the fourteenth. He still assures me of the same. This is a distressing circumstance, as every article of provision, and every thing necessary for that de∣partment, can have no other now than a land-conveyance, the water-communication from hence to Albany being en∣tirely cut off.</P>
<P>Congress will please to consider the inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 6, about raising six companies out of the inhabitants about the Lakes, to prevent the incursions of the Indians. The general officers, in their minutes of council, have deter∣mined it a matter of much importance;—and their atten∣tion to the price of goods furnished the soldiery may be extremely necessary. They have complained much upon this head.</P>
<P>The retreat from Crown-Point seems to be considered in opposite views by the general and field officers. The former (I am satisfied) have weighed the matter well; and yet the reasons assigned by the latter against it appear strong and forcible. I hope whatever is done will be for the best. * * *</P>
<P>By a letter from the committee of Orange-county, re∣ceived this morning, the men-of-war and tenders were yes∣terday at Haversham-bay, about forty miles above this. A number of men, in four barges from the tenders, at∣tempted to land, with a view (they suppose) of taking some sheep and cattle, that had been previously removed. A small number of militia that were collected obliged them to retreat, without their doing any damage with their cannon. They were sounding the water up towards the Highlands; by which it is probable they will attempt to pass with part of the fleet, if possible.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening a flag came from general Howe with a letter addressed "<HI>To George Washington, esquire, &amp;c.
<PB N="190" REF="029737_0189_0FE2486F58B6F338"/>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>New-York,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 19, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the sixteenth and seventeenth, with the several resolves they contained; to the execution of which, so far as shall be in my power, I will pay proper attention.</P>
<P>In my letter of the seventeenth I transmitted you a copy of one from general Schuyler, and of its several in∣closures. I confess the determination of the council of general officers on the seventh, to retreat from Crown-Point, surprised me much: and the more I consider it, the more striking does the impropriety appear. The reasons assigned against it by the field-officers, in their re∣monstrance, coincide greatly with my own ideas and those of the other general officers I have had an opportunity of consulting with, and seem to be of considerable weight,—I may add, conclusive. I am not so fully acquainted with the geography of that country and the situation of the different posts, as to pronounce a peremptory judg∣ment upon the matter: but, if my ideas are right, the possession of Crown-Point is essential, to give us the su∣periority and mastery upon the Lake.</P>
<P>That the enemy will possess it as soon as abandoned by us, there can be no doubt; and if they do, whatever gallies or force we keep on the Lake will be unquestiona∣bly in their rear. How they are to be supported there, or what succour can be drawn from them there, is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps it is only meant that they shall be employed on the communication between that and Ticonderoga. If this is the case, I fear the views of Con∣gress will not be answered, nor the salutary effects be de∣rived from them, that were intended.</P>
<P>I have mentioned my surprise to general Schuyler, and would, by the advice of the general officers here, have directed that that post should be maintained, had it not been for two causes,—an apprehension that the works
<PB N="191" REF="029737_0190_0FE248C614C9DA88"/>
have been destroyed, and that, if the army should be or∣dered from Ticonderoga, or the post opposite to it (where I presume they are) to repossess it, they would have nei∣ther one place nor another secure and in a defensible state: the other, lest it might increase the jealousy and diversity of opinions which seem already too prevalent in that ar∣my, and establish a precedent for the inferior officers to set up their judgments whenever they would, in opposi∣tion to those of their superiors,—a matter of great deli∣cacy, and that might lead to fatal consequences, if coun∣tenanced;—though in the present instance I could wish their reasoning had prevailed.</P>
<P>If the army has not removed, what I have said to gen∣eral Schuyler may perhaps bring on a reconsideration of the matter; and it may not be too late to take measures for maintaining that post. But of this I have no hope.</P>
<P>In consequence of the resolve of Congress for three of the eastern regiments to reinforce the northern army, I wrote to general Ward, and, by advice of my gen∣eral officers, directed them to march to Norwich, and there to embark for Albany; conceiving that two val∣uable purposes might result therefrom,—first, that they would sooner join the army, by pursuing this route, and be saved from the distress and fatigue that must attend every long march through the country at this hot and un∣comfortable season; and secondly, that they might give succour here, in case the enemy should make an attack about the time of their passing. But the enemy having now, with their ships of war and tenders, cut off the water-communication from the hence to Albany, I have wrote this day and directed them to proceed by land across the country. If Congress disapprove the route, or wish to give any orders about them, you will please to certify me thereof, that I may take measures accordingly.</P>
<P>Inclosed I have the honour to transmit you copies of a letter and sundry resolutions which I received yesterday from the convention of this State. By them you will per∣ceive they have been acting upon matters of great impor∣tance, and are exerting themselves in the most vigorous manner to defeat the wicked designs of the enemy, and such disaffected persons as may incline to assist and facili∣tate
<PB N="192" REF="029737_0191_0FE24871E69906F8"/>
their news. In compliance with their request, and on account of the scarcity of money for carrying their salutary views into execution, I have agreed to lend them, out of the small stock now in hand, (not more than sixty thousand dollars) twenty thousand dollars, in part of what they want; which they promise speedily to re∣place. Had there been money sufficient for paying the whole of our troops and no more, I could not have done it. But as it was otherwise, and by no means proper to pay a part and not the whole, I could not foresee any in∣conveniences that would attend the loan;—on the con∣trary, that it might contribute in some degree to forward their schemes. I hope my conduct in this instance will not be disapproved.</P>
<P>I inclosed governor Trumbull a copy of their letter and of their several resolves, to-day, by colonel Broom and Mr. Duer, two members of the convention, who are go∣ing to wait on him; but did not think myself at liberty to urge or request his interest in forming the camp of six thousand men, as the levies, directed by Congress to be furnished the third of June, for the defence of this place, by that government, are but little more than one third come in. At the same time, the proposition I think a good one, if it could be carried into execution. In case the enemy should attempt to effect a landing above Kingsbridge, and to cut off the communication between this city and the country, an army to hang on their rear would distress them exceedingly.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favours of the eighteenth and nineteenth, with which you have been pleased to honour me, have been duly received, with the several resolves alluded to.</P>
<P>When the letter and declaration, from lord Howe to Mr. Franklin and the other late governors, come to be pub∣lished, I should suppose the warmest advocates for depend∣ence on the British crown must be silent, and be convinc∣ed beyond all possibility of doubt, that all that has been said about the commissioners was illusory, and calculated expressly to deceive and unguard, not only the good peo∣ple of our own country, but those of the English nation that were averse to the proceedings of the king and minis∣try. Hence we see the cause why a specification of their powers was not given the mayor and city of London, on their address requesting it. That would have been danger∣ous, because it would then have been manifest that the line of conduct they were to pursue would be totally variant from that they had industriously propagated, and amused the public with. The uniting the civil and military offices in the same persons too, must be conclusive to every think∣ing one, that there is to be but little negociation of the civil kind.</P>
<P>I have inclosed, for the satisfaction of Congress, the sub∣stance of what passed between myself and lieutenant-colo∣nel Patterson, adjutant-general, at an interview had yester∣day
<PB N="194" REF="029737_0193_0FE248736BD9FB90"/>
in consequence of a request from general Howe the day before;—to which I beg leave to refer them for par∣ticulars.</P>
<P>Colonel Knox of the train having often mentioned to me the necessity of having a much more numerous body of artillerists than what there now is, in case the present con∣test should continue longer,—and knowing the deficiency in this instance, and their extreme usefulness,—I desired him to commit his ideas upon the subject to writing, in or∣der that I might transmit them to Congress for their con∣sideration. Agreeable to my request, he has done it; and the propriety of his plan is now submitted for their decision. It is certain that we have not more at this time than are sufficient for the several extensive posts we now have,—including the draughts which he speaks of, and which, I presume (not only from what he has informed me, but from the nature of the thing) can never be qualified to render the same service as if they were regularly appointed and formed into a corps for that particular purpose.</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind Congress that some time ago I laid before them the proposals of some persons here for forming a company of light-horse; and the president's an∣swer, a little time after, intimated that the plan seemed to be approved of. As those who wanted to make up the troop are frequently pressing me for an answer, I could wish to be favoured with the decision of Congress upon the subject.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the fourteenth instant, dated at Albany, he informs me, that, the day before, some desperate designs of the tories in that quar∣ter had been discovered, the particulars of which he could not divulge, being under an oath of secrecy;—however, that such measures had been taken, as to promise a pre∣vention of the intended mischief; and that four of the conspirators (among them, a ringleader) were apprehend∣ed about one o'clock that morning, not far from the town. What the plot was, or who were concerned in it, is a matter I am ignorant of as yet.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the pleasure of writing you by this morning's post, I was favoured with a letter from gover∣nor Trumbull, a copy of which is inclosed, and to which I beg leave to refer you. In regard to the stock he men∣tions, I wrote to him, requesting that they might be re∣moved from the islands on which they were, as I conceiv∣ed it of great importance to distress the enemy as much as possible in the article of fresh provision. I wish the other governments may follow his example, and have it remov∣ed from the islands belonging to them respectively.</P>
<P>When the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ps of war and tenders went up the river, it was thought expedient that application should be made for the Connecticut row-gallies and those belonging to Rhode-Island, in order to attempt something for their destruction. As soon as they arrive we shall try to employ them in some useful way,—but in what, or how successfully, I cannot at present determine.</P>
<P>Congress will please to observe what Mr. Trumbull says respecting the continental regiment raising under colonel Ward. If they incline to give any orders about their des∣tination, you will please to communicate them by the ear∣liest opportunity, as their march will be suspended till they are known.</P>
<P>The orders Mr. Trumbull has given to the officers of their cruisers, to stop provision-vessels, seem to be necessary. We have too much reason to believe that some have gone voluntarily to the enemy, and that there are many persons who would continue to furnish them with large supplies: and, however upright the intentions of others may be, it will be a matter of the utmost difficulty, if not an impossi∣bility, for any to escape falling into their hands now, as every part of the coast (it is probable) will swarm with their saips of war and tenders. I had proposed writing to the convention of this State upon the subject before I re∣ceived his letter; and am now more persuaded of the ne∣cessity of their taking some steps to prevent further expor∣tations down the Sound. In my next I shall inform them of the intelligence received from Mr. Trumbull, and rec∣ommend the matter to their attention.</P>

<P>P. S. It appears absolutely necessary that the expor∣tation of provision should be stopped. Our army is large, and otherwise may want. Nor can individuals be injured, as they have a ready-money market for every thing they have to dispose of in that way.</P>

<P>DISAGREEABLE as it is to me and unpleasing as it may be to Congress to multiply officers, I find myself under the unavoidable necessity of asking an increase of my aides-de-camp. The augmentation of my command,—the increase of my correspondence,—the orders to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,—the instructions to draw,—cut out more business than I am able to execute in time with propriety. The business of so many different departments centring with me, and by me to be handed on to Congress for their information,—added to the intercourse I am obliged to keep up with the adjacent States,—and incidental occurrences,—all of which require confidential and not hack writers to execute,—renders it impossible, in the present state of things, for my family to discharge the several duties expected of me, with that precision and dispatch that I could wish. What will it be then, when we come into a more active scene, and I am called upon from twenty different places perhaps at the same instant?</P>
<P>Congress will do me the justice to believe (I hope) that it is not my inclination or wish to run the continent to any unnecessary expense; and those who better know me will not suspect that shew and parade can have any influence on my mind in this instance. A conviction of the neces∣sity of it, for the regular discharge of the trust reposed in∣me, is the governing motive for the application; and, as such, is submitted to Congress by, Sir, your most obe∣dient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I WAS yesterday morning honoured with your fa∣vour of the twenty-fourth instant with its several inclos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res, to which I shall pay the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> attention.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="029737_0197_0FE2487DDFDED810"/>
The confidence Congress are pleased to repose in my judgment demands my warmest acknowledgments, and they may rest assured it shall be invariably employed, so far as shall be in my power, to promote their views and the public weal. * * *</P>
<P>Since my last, nothing material has occurred. Yester∣day evening report was made that eight ships were seen in the offing, standing towards the Hook. The men-of-war and tenders are still up the river. They have never attempt∣ed to pass the Highland fortifications; and, a day or two ago, quitted their station, and fell down the river eight or ten miles. The vigilance and activity of the militia oppo∣site where they were have prevented their landing and do∣ing much injury. One poor peasant's cot they plundered and then burnt.</P>
<P>I would wish to know whether the allowance given to officers, the seventeenth of January, of a dollar and one-third for every man they enlist, Congress mean to extend to the officers who enlist for the new army for three years. At first it may appear wrong, or rather exorbitant, suppos∣ing that many will be recruited out of the regiments now in service, and under them: but the allowance will be of great use, as it will interest the officers, and call forth their exertions, which otherwise would be faint and languid. In∣deed I am fearful, from the inquiries I have made, that their utmost exertions will be attended with but little success. It is objected that the bounty of ten dollars is too low; and argued,—"if the States, furnishing men for five or six months, allow considerably more, why should that be ac∣cepted when the term of enlistment is to be for three years." I heartily wish a bounty in land had been or could be giv∣en, as was proposed some time ago. I think it would be attended with salutary consequences.</P>
<P>In consequence of my application to governor Trumbull, he has sent me two row-gallies; and I expect another from him. None from governor Cooke are yet come; nor have I heard from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m on the subject. One is complete here. The fire-ships are going on under Mr. Anderson's direction, but rather slowly; and I am preparing some ob∣structions for the channel nearly opposite the works at the upper end of this island. When all things are ready, I in∣tend
<PB N="199" REF="029737_0198_0FE248D4B9AE5798"/>
to try, if it shall seem practicable, to destroy the ships and tenders above, and to employ the gallies, if they can be of advantage.</P>
<P>The militia for the flying camp come in but slowly. By a return from general Mercer yesterday, they are but little more than three thousand. If they were in, or can be there shortly, and the situation of the enemy remains the same, I would make some efforts to annoy them, keeping our posts here well guarded, and not putting too much to the hazard, or in any manner to the risk.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of the twenty-fourth I received on Sat∣urday evening, and, agreeable to your request, shall expunge the preamble to the resolution subjecting the property of subjects to the British crown to forfeiture and confisca∣tion.</P>
<P>Our stock of musket-powder is entirely made up in car∣tridges. I therefore request that Congress will order four or five tons more of that sort to be immediately forwarded; it being not only necessary that we should have more for that purpose, but also some stock to remain in barrels.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening Hutchinson's and Sergeant's regi∣ments from Boston arrived; also two row-gallies from Rhode-Island. I am fearful the troops have not got en∣tirely clear of the small-pox. I shall use every possible precaution to prevent the infection spreading; and, for that purpose, have ordered them to an encampment separate and detached from the rest.</P>
<P>By Saturday's report from Long-Island camp, five ships, a brig, and five schooners, had got into the Hook; by yes∣terday's, two ships more, and a sloop, were standing in. What they are, I have not been able to learn.</P>
<P>I have transmitted a general return herewith, by which Congress will perceive the whole of our force at the time it was made.</P>
<P>I have inclosed you an account of sundry prizes, which was transmitted to several gentlemen here by Saturday's
<PB N="200" REF="029737_0199_0FE24A191DA8D5A0"/>
post. The two last prizes I did not see mentioned in the letters shewn me; and I fear the report of the second pro∣vision-vessel is premature. I was also this minute informed that captain Biddle had taken a ship with sugars for Bri∣tain, and, in bringing her in, unfortunately lost her on Fisher's-Island.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honoured with your two favours of yesterday's date; and, agreeable to your request, have given Mr. Palfrey liberty to negociate your claim with Mr. Brimer, and wish it may be satisfied agreeably to you.</P>
<P>I last night received a letter from general Schuyler, a copy of which I do myself the honour to transmit you. You will thereby perceive his reasons for leaving Crown-Point, and preferring the post the council of officers deter∣mined to take opposite to Ticonderoga. I am totally un∣acquainted with those several posts and the country about them, and therefore cannot determine on the validity of his observations, or think myself at liberty to give any di∣rection in the matter.</P>
<P>Congress will please to observe what he says of their dis∣tress for money. From hence he can have no relief, there being only about three or four thousand dollars in the pay∣master's hands, according to his return this morning,—and all but two months pay due to the army, besides many other demands. I could wish that proper supplies of money could be always kept:—the want may occasion consequen∣ces of an alarming nature.</P>
<P>By a letter from him, of a prior date to the copy inclos∣ed, he tells me that a Mr. Ryckman, who has just returned through the country of the Six-Nations, reports that the Indians who were at Philadelphia have gone home with very favourable ideas of our strength and resources. This he heard in many of their villages:—a lucky circumstance if it will either gain their friendship or secure their neu∣trality.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="029737_0200_0FE249277047DD00"/>
In my letter of the twenty-seventh I informed Congress of my views and wishes to attempt something against the troops on Staten-Island. I am now to acquaint them, that, by the advice of general Mercer and other officers at Amboy, it will be impracticable to do any thing upon a large scale, for want of craft, and as the enemy have the entire command of the water all round the island. I have desired general Mercer to have nine or ten flat-bot∣tomed boats built at Newark-bay and Elizabeth-Town, with a design principally to keep up the communication across Hackinsac and Passaic rivers, which I deem a matter of great importance, and extremely necessary to be attend∣ed to.</P>
<P>Since I wrote you yesterday, eleven ships more, four brigs, and two sloops, have come into the Hook. I have not yet received intelligence what any of the late arrivals are: but I suppose we shall not long remain in a state of uncertainty.</P>
<P>Having reason to believe that lord Howe will readily come into an exchange of such prisoners as may be more immediately under his command, and that something will be offered on this subject within a day or two, or rather come in answer to the propositions I have made general Howe. I should be glad to have Congress's interpretation of the resolve of the twenty-second instant, empowering the commanders to exchange, &amp;c. whether by the word <HI>'sailor,'</HI> they mean sailors generally, as well those taken in the vessels of private adventurers by the enemy, as those be∣longing to the continental cruisers, or vessels in the conti∣nent's employ; or whether they only design to extend the exchange to the latter,—those in their particular em∣ploy.</P>
<P>I would also observe, that, heretofore, sailors belonging to merchant ships that have fallen into our hands, and those employed merely as transports, have not generally been considered as prisoners. I submit it to Congress whether it may not be now necessary to pass a resolve declaring their sentiments on this subject, and, in general, who are to be treated as prisoners of war, that are taken on board vessels belonging to the subjects of the British crown, &amp;c.
<PB N="202" REF="029737_0201_0FE248D64597BF58"/>
The result of their opinion upon the first question propos∣ed, you will be pleased to transmit me by the earliest op∣portunity.</P>
<P>I have inclosed, for the consideration of Congress, a memorial and petition by captain Holdridge, praying to be relieved against the loss of money stolen from him,—not conceiving myself authorised to grant his request. The certificate which attends it proves him a man of character; and his case is hard, on his state of it. Whether making the loss good may not open a door to others, and give rise to applications not so just as his may be, I cannot deter∣mine. That seems to be the only objection to relieving him.</P>
<P>I am informed by general Putnam that there are some of the Stockbridge Indians here (I have not seen them myself) who express great uneasiness at their not being employed by us, and have come to inquire into the cause. I am sensible Congress had them not in contemplation when they resolved that Indians might be engaged in our service. However, as they seem so anxious,—as they were led to expect it, from what general Schuyler and the other commissioners did,—as we are under difficulties in getting men, and there may be danger of their (or some of them) taking an unfavourable part,—I beg leave to sub∣mit it as my opinion, under all these circumstances, that they had better be employed.</P>

<P>YOUR favour of the thirtieth ultimo, with its sev∣eral inclosures, I was honoured with by Wednesday's post.</P>
<P>Congress having been pleased to leave with me the direction of colonel Ward's regiment, I have wrote to governor Trumbull, and requested him to order their march to this place, being fully satisfied that the enemy mean to make their grand push in this quarter, and that the good of the service requires every aid here that can be obtained. I have also wrote to colonel Elmore, and
<PB N="203" REF="029737_0202_0FE24928F6A0CD60"/>
directed him to repair hither with his regiment. When it comes, I shall fill up commissions for such officers as ap∣pear with their respective companies.</P>
<P>Colonel Holman, with a regiment from the Massachu∣setts State, is arrived. Colonel Cary from thence is also here, waiting the arrival of his regiment which he hourly expects. He adds, when he left New-London he heard that the third regiment from the Massachusetts was almost ready, and would soon be in motion.</P>
<P>The enemy's force is daily augmenting and becoming stronger by new arrivals. Yesterday, general Greene re∣ports that about forty sail, including tenders, came into the Hook. What they are, or what those have brought that have lately got in, I remain uninformed. How∣ever, I think it probable they are part of lord Howe's fleet, with the Hessian troops:—it is time to look for them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured with your favour of the thirty-first ultimo on Friday, with its several inclosures; and return you my thanks for the agreeable intelligence you were pleased to communicate, of the arrival of one of our ships with such valuable articles as arms and ammunition; also of the capture made by a privateer.</P>
<P>The mode for the exchange of prisoners, resolved on by Congress, is acceded to by general Howe, so far as it comes within his command. A copy of my letter and his answer upon this subject I have the honour to inclose you; to which I beg leave to refer Congress.</P>
<P>The inclosed copy of a letter from colonel Tupper, who had the general command of the gallies here, will inform Congress of the engagement between them and the ships of war up the North-river on Saturday evening, and of the damage we sustained. What injury was done to the ships, I cannot ascertain. It is said they were hulled sev∣eral
<PB N="204" REF="029737_0203_0FE248D7CA8F1C18"/>
times by our shot. All accounts agree that our of∣ficers and men, during the whole of the affair, behaved with great spirit and bravery. The damage done the gallies shews beyond question that they had a warm time of it. The ships still remain up the river; and, before any thing further can be attempted against them (should it be thought adviseable) the gallies must be repaired.</P>
<P>I have also transmitted Congress a copy of a letter I received by Saturday's post from governor Cooke, to which I refer them for the intelligence it contains. The seizure of our vessels by the Portuguese is, I fear, an event too true. Their dependence upon the British crown for aid against the Spaniards must force them to comply with every thing required of them. I wish the Morris may get safe in with her cargo. As to the ships captain Buch∣lin saw on the twenty-fifth ultimo, they are probably ar∣rived; for yesterday twenty-five sail came into the Hook.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, he informs me that two of our armed vessels, the day before, had brought into Marblehead a ship bound from Halifax to Staten-Island. She had in about fifteen hundred and nine pounds' worth of British goods, besides a good many belonging to tories. A Halifax paper, found on board her, I have inclosed, as also an account sent me by Mr. Hazard, transmitted him by some of his friends, as given by the tories taken in her. Their intel∣ligence, I dare say, is true respecting the arrival of part of the Hessian troops. General Ward in his letter men∣tions, that, the day this prize was taken, captain Burke, in another of our armed vessels, had an engagement with a ship and a schooner which he thought were transports, and would have taken them, had it not been for an un∣lucky accident in having his quarter-deck blown up. Two of his men were killed, and several more were wounded.</P>
<P>The hulks and chevaux-de-frise, that have been pre∣paring to obstruct the channel, have got up to the place they are intended for, and will be sunk as soon as pos∣sible.</P>
<P>I have transmitted Congress a general return of the ar∣my in and about this place on the third instant, by which they will perceive the amount of our force.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="029737_0204_0FE2492A7B5CF1F8"/>
Before I conclude, I would beg leave to remind Con∣gress of the necessity there is of having some major-gener∣als appointed for this army, the duties of which are great, extensive, and impossible to be discharged as they ought and the good of the service requires, without a competent number of officers of this rank. I mean to write more fully upon the subject: and, as things are drawing fast to an issue, and it is necessary to make every proper dis∣position and arrangement that we possibly can, I pray that this matter may be taken into consideration, and claim their early attention. I well know what has prevented appointments of this sort for some time past: but the sit∣uation of our affairs will not justify longer delays in this instance. By the first opportunity, I shall take the liber∣ty of giving you my sentiments more at large upon the propriety and necessity of the measure.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of the fifth which I had the honour of addressing you, I begged leave to recal the attention of Congress to the absolute necessity there is for appointing more general officers,—promising at the same time, by the first opportunity, to give my sentiments more at large upon the subject.</P>
<P>Confident I am that the postponing this measure has not proceeded from motives of frugality: otherwise I should take the liberty of attempting to prove that we put too much to the hazard by such a saving. I am but too well apprised of the difficulties that occur in the choice. They are, I acknowledge, great; but at the same time it must be allowed they are of such a nature as to present themselves whenever the subject is thought of. Time on the one hand does not remove them; on the other, delay may be pro∣ductive of fatal consequences.</P>
<P>This army, though far short as yet of the numbers in∣tended by Congress, is by much too unwieldy for the com∣mand of any one man, without several major-generals to assist. For it is to be observed that a brigadier-general at
<PB N="206" REF="029737_0205_0FE248DEE4AA8D08"/>
the head of his brigade is no more than a colonel at the head of a regiment, except that he acts upon a larger scale. Officers of more general command are at all times wanted for the good order and government of an army, especially when the army is composed chiefly of raw troops: but in an action they are indispensably necessary. At present there is but one major-general for this whole department and the flying camp; whereas, at this place alone, less than three cannot discharge the duties with that regularity they ought to be.</P>
<P>If these major-generals are appointed, as undoubtedly they will, out of the present brigadiers, you will want for this place three brigadiers at least. The northern depart∣ment will require one, if not two (as general Thompson is a prisoner, and the baron Woedtke reported to be dead or in a state not much better) there being at present only one brigadier-general (Arnold) in all that department. For the eastern governments there ought to be one, or a major-general, to superintend the regiments there, and to prevent impositions that might otherwise be practised. These make the number wanted to be six or seven: and who are to be appointed, Congress can best judge.</P>
<P>To make brigadiers of the oldest colonels would be the least exceptionable way: but it is much to be questioned whether by that mode the ablest men would be appointed to office. And I would observe, though the rank of the colonels of the eastern governments was settled at Cam∣bridge last year, it only respected themselves and is still open as to officers of other governments. To pick a col∣onel here and a colonel there through the army according to the opinion entertained of their abilities, would no doubt be the means of making a better choice, and nominating the fittest persons: but then the senior officers would get disgusted, and, more than probable, with their connexions, quit the service. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> might prove fatal at this time. To appoint gentlemen as brigadiers, that had not served in this army, (in this part of it at least) would not wound any one in particular, but hurt the whole equally, and must be considered in a very discouraging light by every officer of merit. View the matter therefore in any point of light you will, there are inconveniences on the one hand, and
<PB N="207" REF="029737_0206_0FE24933CB344D28"/>
difficulties on the other, which ought to be avoided. Would they be remedied by appointing the oldest colonels from each State?—If this mode should be thought ex∣pedient, the inclosed list gives the names of the colonels, from New-Hampshire to Pennsylvania inclusive, speci∣fying those who rank first, as I am told, in the several colony lists.</P>
<P>I have transmitted a copy of a letter from Mr. John Glover, setting forth the nature and grounds of a dispute between him and a Mr. Bradford respecting their agency. Not conceiving myself authorised, nor having the smallest inclination to interefere in any degree in the matter, it is referred to Congress, who will determine and give direc∣tion upon it in such manner as they shall judge best. I will only observe that Mr. Glover was recommended to me as a proper person for an agent when we first fitted out armed vessels, and was accordingly appointed one; and, so far as I know, discharged his office with fidelity and industry.</P>
<P>I received yesterday evening a letter from general Schuyler, containing lieutenant M<SUP>c</SUP>Michael's report, who had been sent a scout to Oswego. A copy of the report I have inclosed for the information of Congress, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t gen∣eral Schuyler should have omitted it in his letter which accompanies this. He was at the German-Flats when he wrote, which was the second instant, and the treaty with the Indians not begun; nor had the whole expected then arrived. But of these things he will have advised you more fully, I make no doubt.</P>
<P>The pay-master informs me he received a supply of mon∣ey yesterday. It came very seasonably: for the applica∣tions and clamours of the troops had become incessant and distressing beyond measure. There is now two months' pay due to them.</P>

<PB N="208" REF="029737_0207_0FE248E17060EB10"/>
who left the Solebay man-of-war last evening. One of them is a native of New-York. Their account is that they were in the engagement with colonel Moultrie at Sullivan's island on the ninth of July—(the particulars they give nearly correspond with the narrative sent by general Lee)—that they left Carolina three weeks ago as a con∣voy to forty-five transports having on board general Clin∣ton, lord Cornwallis, and the whole southern army con∣sisting of about three thousand men, all of whom were landed last week on Staten-Island in tolerable health;—that, on Sunday, thirteen transports, part of lord Howe's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet, and having on board Hessians and Highlanders, came to Staten-Island;—that the remainder of the fleet, which was reported to have, in the whole, twelve thou∣sand men, had parted with these troops off the banks of Newfoundland, and were expected to come in every mo∣ment;—that they were getting their heavy carriages and cannon on board, had launched eight gondolas with flat bottoms, and two rafts or stages to carry cannon.</P>
<P>These men understand that the attack will soon be made, if the other troops arrive;—that they give out they will lay the Jersies waste with fire and sword;—that the computed strength of their army will be thirty thousand men. They further add, that, when they left Carolina, one transport got on shore, so that they were not able to give her relief; upon which, she surrendered, with five com∣panies of Highlanders, to general Lee, who, after taking every thing valuable out of her, burnt her;—that the ad∣miral turned general Clinton out of his ship after the en∣gagement, with a great deal of abuse;—great differences between the principal naval and military gentlemen;—that the ships, left in Carolina, are now in such a weakly distressed condition, they would fall an easy prey.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By yesterday morning's post, I was honoured with your favour of the second instant, with sundry resolutions of Congress, to which I shall pay strict attention.</P>
<P>As the proposition for employing the Stockbridge In∣dians has been approved, I have wrote to Mr. Edwards, one of the commissioners, and who lives among them, re∣questing him to engage them, or, such as are willing, to enter the service. I have directed him to indulge them with liberty to join this or the northern army, or both, as their inclination may lead.</P>
<P>I wish the salutary consequences may result from the regulation respecting seamen taken, that Congress have in view. From the nature of this kind of people, and the privileges granted on their entering into our service, I should suppose many of them will do it. We want them much.</P>
<P>I yesterday transmitted the intelligence I received from the deserters from the Solebay man-of-war. The inclos∣ed copy of a letter by last night's post, from the honoura∣ble Mr. Bowdoin, with the information of a captain Ken∣nedy lately taken, corroborate their accounts respecting the Hessian troops. Indeed his report makes the fleet and armament, to be employed against us, greater than what we have heard they would be. However there re∣mains no doubt of their being both large and formidable, and such as will require our most vigorous exertions to oppose them. Persuaded of this, and knowing how much inferior our numbers are and will be to theirs when the whole of their troops arrive,—of the important conse∣quences that may and will flow from the appeal that will soon be made,—I have wrote to Connecticut and New-Jersey, for all the succour they can afford, and also to the convention of this State. What I may receive, and in what time, the event must determine. But I would fain hope, the situation and the exigency of our affairs will call forth the most strenuous efforts and early assistance of those who are friends to the cause. I confess there is but too much occasion for their exertions. I confidently trust they will not be withheld.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029737_0209_0FE248E2F36EEA78"/>
I have inclosed a copy of a letter from Mr. Bowdoin respecting the eastern Indians. Congress will thereby perceive that they profess themselves to be well attached to our interest,—and the summary of the measures taken to engage them in our service. I have the treaty at large between the honourable council of the Massachusetts, on behalf of the United States, with the delegates of the Saint John's and Mickmac tribes. The probability of a copy's being sent already, and its great length, prevent one coming herewith. If Congress have not had it for∣warded to them, I will send a copy by the first oppor∣tunity after notice that it has not been received.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 9.—By a report received from general Greene last night, at sunset and a little after, about a hundred boats were seen bringing troops from Staten-Island to the ships, three of which had fallen down towards the narrows, having taken in soldiers from thirty of the boats. He adds, that, by the best observations of several officers, there appeared to be a general embarkation.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Mercer for two thousand men from the flying camp. Colonel Smallwood's battalion, as part of them, I expect this forenoon: but where the rest are to come from, I know not, as, by the general's last re∣turn, not more than three or four hundred of the new levies had got in.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fifth I inclosed a general return of the army under my immediate command; but I imagine the following state will give Congress a more perfect idea, though not a more agreeable one, of our situation. For the several posts on New-York, Long and Governor's islands, and Paulus-Hook, we have, fit for duty, ten thou∣sand five hundred and fourteen,—sick present, three thou∣sand and thirty-nine,—sick absent, six hundred and twen∣ty-nine,—on command, two thousand nine hundred and forty six,—on furlough, ninety-seven,—total, seventeen thousand two hundred and twenty-five. In addition to these, we are only certain of colonel Smallwood's battalion in case of an immediate attack. Our posts too are much divided, having waters between many of them, and some distant from others fifteen miles. These circumstances, sufficiently distressing of themselves, are much aggravated
<PB N="211" REF="029737_0210_0FE24936CFB5F518"/>
by the sickness that prevails through the army. Every day more or less are taken down; so that the proportion of men that may come in cannot be considered as a real and serviceable augmentation on the whole.</P>
<P>These things are melancholy; but they are neverthe∣less true. I hope for better. Under every disadvantage, my utmost exertions shall be employed to bring about the great end we have in view: and, so far as I can judge from the professions and apparent disposition of my troops, I shall have their support. The superiority of the enemy and the expected attack do not seem to have depressed their spirits. These considerations lead me to think, that, though the appeal may not terminate so happily in our favour as I could wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, yet they will not succeed in their views without considerable loss. Any advantage they may get, I trust, will cost them dear.</P>
<P><HI>Eight o'clock, P. M.</HI></P>
<P>By the reverend Mr. Madison and a Mr. Johnson, two gentlemen of Virginia, who came from Staten-Island yes∣terday, where they arrived the day before in the packet with colonel Guy Johnson, I am informed that nothing material had taken place in England when they left it:—that there had been a change in the French ministry, which, many people thought, foreboded a war;—that it seemed to be believed by many that Congress would attempt to buy off the foreign troops, and that it might be effect∣ed without great difficulty. Their accounts from Staten-Island nearly correspond with what we had before: they say that every preparation is making for an attack;—that the force now upon the island is about fifteen thousand;—that they appear very impatient for the arrival of the for∣eign troops, but a very small part having got in. Wheth∣er they would attempt any thing before they come, they are uncertain: but they are sure they will as soon as they arrive, if not before. They say, from what they could collect from the conversation of officers, &amp;c. they mean to hem us in by getting above us and cutting off all commu∣nication with the country.</P>
<P>That this is their plan, seems to be corroborated and confirmed by the circumstance of some ships of war going out at different times within a few days past, and other
<PB N="212" REF="029737_0211_0FE248E47581D488"/>
vessels. It is probable that a part are to go round and come up the Sound.</P>
<P>Mr. Madison says lord Howe's powers were not known when he left England;—that general Conway moved, before his departure, that they might be laid be∣fore the commons; and had his motion rejected by a large majority.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the eighth and tenth instant, with their several inclosures. I shall pay attention to the resolution respecting lieutenant Josiah, and attempt to relieve him from his rigorous usage. Your letters to such of the gentlemen as were here have been delivered. The rest will be sent by the first op∣portunity.</P>
<P>Since my last, of the eighth and ninth, the enemy have made no movements of consequence. They remain nearly in the same state; nor have we any further in∣telligence of their designs. They have not been yet joined by the remainder of the fleet with the Hessian troops.</P>
<P>Colonel Smallwood and his battalion got in on Fri∣day; and colonel Miles is also here with two battalions more of Pennsylvania riflemen.</P>
<P>The convention of this State have been exerting them∣selves to call forth a portion of their militia to an encamp∣ment forming above Kingsbridge, to remain in service for the space of one month after their arrival there; and also half of those in King and Queen's counties, to reinforce the troops on Long-Island till the first of September, un∣less sooner discharged. General Morris too is to take post with his brigade on the Sound and Hudson's-river for ten days, to annoy the enemy in case they attempt to land; and others of their militia are directed to be in readiness, in case their aid should be required. Upon the whole, from the information I have from the convention, the militia ordered are now in motion, or will be in a lit∣tle
<PB N="213" REF="029737_0212_0FE2493959E84F18"/>
time, and will amount to about three thousand or more. From Connecticut, I am not certain what succours are coming. By one or two gentlemen who have come from thence, I am told some of the militia were assembling, and, from the intelligence they had, would march this week.</P>
<P>By a letter from governor Trumbull, of the fifth, I am advised that the troops from that State, destined for the northern army, had marched for Skenesborough. Gener∣al Ward too, by a letter of the fourth, informs me that the two regiments would march from Boston last week, having been cleansed and generally recovered from the small-pox. I have also countermanded my orders to col∣onel Elmore, and directed him to join the northern army, having heard, after my orders to Connecticut for his march∣ing hither, that he and most of his regiment were at Alba∣ny or within its vicinity. General Ward mentions that the council of the Massachusetts State will have in from two to three thousand of their militia to defend their lines and different posts, in lieu of the regiments ordered from thence agreeable to the resolution of Congress.</P>
<P>The inclosed copy of a resolve of this State, passed the tenth instant, will discover the apprehension they are un∣der of the defection of the inhabitants of King's county from the common cause, and of the measures they have taken thereupon. I have directed general Greene to give the committee such assistance as he can, and they may re∣quire, in the execution of their commission; though at the same time I wish the information the convention have re∣ceived upon the subject may prove groundless.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to mention to Congress, that, in a letter I received from general Lee, he mentions the valua∣ble consequences that would result from a number of cav∣alry being employed in the southern department. With∣out them (to use his own expressions) he can answer for nothing:—with one thousand, he would ensure the safety of those States. I should have done myself the honour of submitting this matter to Congress before at his particular request, had it not escaped my mind. From his acquaint∣ance with that country, and the nature of the grounds, I doubt not he has weighed the matter well, and presume he
<PB N="214" REF="029737_0213_0FE248EDDC37C528"/>
has fully represented the advantages that would arise from the establishment of such a corps: all I mean, is, in com∣pliance with his requisition, to mention the matter, that such consideration may be had upon it (if not already de∣termined) as it may be deserving of.</P>
<P>I have transmitted a general return, whereby Congress will perceive the whole of our strength, except the two bat∣talions under colonel Miles, which, coming since it was made out, are not included.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a letter just come to hand from Marti∣nique. Congress will please to consider of the purport, fa∣vouring me with their answer and a return of the letter.</P>
<P>This moment (ten o'clock) report is made by general Greene that a man-of-war came in yesterday, and that six∣ty sail of ships are now standing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. No doubt, they are a further part of the Hessian fleet.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on Mon∣day, nothing of importance has occurred here, except that the enemy have received an augmentation to their fleet, of ninety-six ships:—some reports make them more. In a letter I wrote you yesterday by lieutenant-colonel Reed, I advised you of this: but pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ming it may not reach you so soon as this will, I have thought proper to mention the intelligence again.</P>
<P>Inclosed I have the honour to transmit a copy of the examination of a deserter sent me this morning by general Mercer, to which I beg leave to refer Congress for the latest accounts I have from the enemy. Whether the intelligence he has given is literally true, I cannot de∣termine: but as to the attack, we daily expect it.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="029737_0215_0FE248EF5FDBC300"/>
Your favour of the tenth, with its inclosures, was duly received; and I have instructed the several officers who were promoted, to act in their stations as you requested, though their commissions were not sent.</P>
<P>As we are in extreme want of tents and covering for this army,—a great part of those at the out-posts having nothing to shelter them, nor houses to go into,—I submit it to Congress whether it may not be prudent to remand those that were lately sent to Boston, where there are no troops at present; and, if there were, the necessity for them would not be great, as the town, and barracks at several of the posts, would be sufficient to receive them.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter from lieutenant-colonel Henshaw will discover to Congress his views and wishes, which they will consider and determine on, in whatever way they think right and conducive to the public good;—meaning only to lay his letter before them.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of mentioning that colonel Varnum of Rhode-Island has been with me this morning to resign his commission, conceiving himself to be greatly injured in not having been noticed in the late arrangement and promotion of general officers. I remonstrated against the impropriety of the measure at this time; and he has con∣sented to stay till affairs wear a different aspect from what they do at present.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that since I had the pleasure of addressing you yesterday, nothing interesting between the two armies has happened. Things remain nearly in the situation they then were.</P>
<P>It is with peculiar regret and concern that I have an op∣portunity of mentioning to Congress the sickly condition of our troops. In force regiments there are not any of the field-officers capable of doing duty: in others the duty is extremely difficult for want of a sufficient number. I have been obliged to nominate some till Congress transmit the appointments of those they wish to succeed to the several vacancies occasioned by the late promotions. This
<PB N="218" REF="029737_0217_0FE248F0E43E8C98"/>

<P>THE circumstances of the two armies having under∣gone no material alteration since I had the honour of writ∣ing to you last, I have nothing particular or important to communicate respecting them.</P>
<P>In my letter of yesterday I forgot to mention the arrival of lord Dunmore here. By the examination of a captain Hunter (who escaped from the enemy, and came to Am∣boy on the fourteenth) transmitted me by general Rober∣deau, I am certainly informed his lordship arrived on the thirteenth. The examination does not say any thing about the ships he brought with him; it only extends to his force, which it mentions to be weak.</P>
<P>I before now expected the enemy would have made their attack; nor can I account for their deferring it, unless the intelligence, given by captain Hunter and another per∣son who escaped about the same time, is the cause, to wit, that they are waiting the arrival of another division of the Hessian troops, which (they say) is still out. Whether that is the reason of the delay, I cannot undertake to deter∣mine: but I should suppose things will not long remain in their present state. I have inclosed a copy of general Rob∣erdeau's letter, and of the examination of those two persons, which will shew Congress all the information they have given upon these subjects.</P>
<P>I am just now advised by Mr. Aires, who came from Philadelphia to build the row-gallies, that two of our fire-vessels attempted last night to burn the enemy's ships and tenders up the river. He says that they burned one tender, and one of them boarded the Phoenix, and was grappled with her for near ten minutes; but she cleared herself. We lost both of the vessels. His account is not so partic∣ular as I could wish; however, I am certain the attempt

<P>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of the sixteenth with the inclosure, and am sorry it is not in my power to transmit Congress a copy of the treaty as they require, having sent it away with the other papers that were in my hands.</P>
<P>The resolution they have entered into respecting the for∣eign troops, I am persuaded, would produce salutary effects if it could be properly circulated among them. I fear it will be a matter of difficulty. However, I will take every measure that shall appear probable to facilitate the end.</P>
<P>I have the honour to inclose you, for the perusal and consideration of Congress, sundry papers marked N<SUP>o</SUP> 1 to N<SUP>o</SUP> 7, inclusive; the whole of which, except N<SUP>o</SUP> 2 and 7, (my answers to lord Drummond and general Howe) I received yesterday evening by a flag, and to which I beg leave to refer Congress.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly at a loss to know the motives and causes inducing a proceeding of such a nature at this time, and why lord Howe has not attempted some plan of nego∣ciation before, as he seems so desirous of it. If I may be allowed to conjecture and guess at the cause, it may be that part of the Hessians have not arrived, as mentioned in the examination transmitted yesterday,—or that general Burgoyne has not made such progress as was expected, to form a junction of their two armies,—or, what I think equally probable, they mean to procrastinate their opera∣tions for some time, trusting that the militias which have come to our succour will soon become tired and return home, as is but too usual with them. Congress will make their observations upon these several matters, and favour me with the result as soon as they have done. They will observe my answer to lord Drummond, who (I am pretty confident) has not attended to the terms of his parole, but
<PB N="220" REF="029737_0219_0FE248F269FDCD38"/>
has violated it in several instances. It is with the rest of the papers; but, if my memory serves me, he was not to hold any correspondence directly or indirectly with those in arms against us, or to go into any port or harbour in America, where the enemy themselves were or had a fleet, or to go on board their ships.</P>
<P>The treaty with the Indians is in the box which lieuten∣ant-colonel Reed, I presume, has delivered before this. If Congress are desirous of seeing it, they will be pleased to have the box opened. It contains a variety of papers, and all the affairs of the army, from my first going to Cam∣bridge, till it was sent away.</P>
<P>This morning the Phoenix and Rose men-of-war, with two tenders, availing themselves of a favourable and brisk wind, came down the river, and have joined the fleet. Our several batteries fired at them in their passage, but without any good effect that I could perceive.</P>

<P>I WAS yesterday morning favoured with yours of the seventeenth, accompanied by several resolutions of Congress, and commissions for officers appointed to the late vacancies in this army.</P>
<P>I wrote some days ago to general Schuyler to propose to generals Carleton and Burgoyne an exchange of prison∣ers in consequence of a former resolve of Congress author¦ising their commanders in each department to negociate one. That of major Meigs for major French, and cap∣tain Dearborn's for any officer of equal rank, I submitted to general Howe's consideration, by letter, on the seven∣teenth, understanding their paroles had been sent him by general Carleton; but have not yet received his answer upon the subject.</P>
<P>In respect to the exchange of the prisoners in Canada, if à proposition on that head has not been already made, (and I believe it has not) the inclosed copy of general Carleton's orders (transmitted me under seal by major Bigelow, who was sent with a flag to general Burgoyne
<PB N="222" REF="029737_0221_0FE248FC49440A30"/>
from Ticonderoga, with the proceedings of Congress on the breach of capitulation at the Cedars, and the inhuman treatment of our people afterwards) will shew it is unnec∣essary, as he has determined to send them to their own provinces, there to remain as prisoners; interdicting at the same time all kind of intercourse between us and his army, except such as may be for the purpose of imploring the king's mercy. The assassination he mentions, of brigadier-general Gordon, is a fact entirely new to me, and what I never heard of before. I shall not trouble Congress with my strictures upon this * * * performance, * * * on∣ly observing that its design is somewhat artful, and that each boatman with major Bigelow was furnished with a copy.</P>
<P>I have also transmitted Congress a copy of the major's journal, to which I beg leave to refer them for the intelli∣gence reported by him on his return from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uce.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Greene yesterday evening, he informed me he had received an express from Hog-Island inlet, advising that five of the enemy's small vessels had ap∣peared at the mouth of the creek, with some troops on board;—also that he had heard two peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guas were off Oyster-bay, the whole supposed to be after live stock; and to prevent their getting it, he had detached a party of horse, and two hundred and twenty men, among them twenty ri∣flemen. I have not received further intelligence upon the subject.</P>
<P>I am also advised by the examination of a captain Button (master of a vessel that had been taken) transmitted me by general Mercer, that the general report among the ene∣my's troops, when he came off, was, that they were to attack Long-Island, and to secure our works there if possi∣ble, at the same time that another part of their army was to land above this city. This information is corroborated by many other accounts, and is probably true: nor will it be possible to prevent them landing on the island, as its great extent affords a variety of places favourable for that purpose, and the whole of our works on it are at the end

<P>Though the intelligence reported by the spy on his re∣turn to governor Livingston has not been confirmed by the event he mentions, (an attack last night) there is every reason to believe that one is shortly designed. The fall∣ing down of several ships yesterday evening to the Nar∣rows, crowded with men,—those succeeded by many more this morning, and a great number of boats parading around them (as I was just now informed) with troops, are all circumstances indicating an attack: and it is not improbable it will be made to-day. It could not have hap∣pened last night, by reason of a most violent gust.</P>
<P>We are making every preparation to receive them; and I trust, under the smiles of Providence, with our own
<PB N="224" REF="029737_0223_0FE248FE14DAF188"/>
exertions, that my next, if they do attack, will transmit an account that will be pleasing to every friend of Amer∣ica, and of the rights of humanity.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG leave to inform Congress, that, yesterday morning and in the course of the preceding night, a con∣siderable body of the enemy, amounting by report to eight or nine thousand, and these all British, landed from the transport-ships mentioned in my last, at Gravesend-bay on Long-Island, and have approached within three miles of our lines, having marched across the low cleared grounds near the woods at Flat-bush, where they are halt∣ed, from my last intelligence.</P>
<P>I have detached from hence six battalions as a rein∣forcement to our troops there, which are all that I can spare at this time, not knowing but the fleet may move up with the remainder of their army, and make an attack here, on the next flood-tide. If they do not, I shall send a further reinforcement, should it be necessary; and have ordered five battalions more to be in readiness for that purpose.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but a little time will produce some im∣portant events. I hope they will be happy. The rein∣forcement detached yesterday went off in high spirits; and I have the pleasure to inform you that the whole of the army, that are effective and capable of duty, discover the same, and great cheerfulness. I have been obliged to appoint major-general Sullivan to the command on the island, owing to general Greene's indisposition:—he has been extremely ill for several days, and still continues bad.</P>
<P>By Wednesday evening's post I received a letter from general Ward, inclosing a copy of the invoice of the ord∣nance stores taken by captain Manly, with the appraisement of the same, (made in pursuance of my direction, founded on the order of Congress) which I do myself the honour

<P>THE irregularity of the post prevents your receiv∣ing the early and constant intelligence it is my wish to communicate. This is the third letter which you will probably receive from me by the same post. The first was of little or no consequence: but that of yesterday gave you the best information I had been able to obtain of the enemy's landing and movements upon Long-Island. Having occasion to go over thither yesterday, I sent my letter to the post-office at the usual hour, being informed that the rider was expected every moment, and would go out again directly: but in the evening when I sent to inquire, none had come in.</P>
<P>I now inclose you a report made to me by general Sullivan after I left Long-Island yesterday. I do not conceive that the enemy's whole force was in motion, but a detached party rather. I have sent over four more regi∣ments, with boats, to be ready either to reinforce the troops under general Sullivan, or to return to this place, if the remainder of the fleet at the watering-place should push up to the city; which hitherto (I mean, since the landing upon Long-Island) they have not had in their power to do, on account of the wind which has either been a-head or too small when the tide has served. I have nothing further to trouble the Congress with at pres∣ent, than that I am theirs and your most obedient humble servant▪</P>

<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the twentieth and twenty-fourth, and am happy to find
<PB N="226" REF="029737_0225_0FE248FF97838BE8"/>
my answer to lord Drummond has met the approbation of Congress. Whatever his views were, most certainly his conduct respecting his parole is highly reprehensible.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the twenty-fourth, almost the whole of the enemy's fleet have fallen down to the Narrows; and, from this circumstance, and the striking of their tents at their several encampments on Staten-Island from time to time previous to the departure of the ships from thence, we are led to think they mean to land the main body of their army on Long-Island, and to make their grand push there. I have ordered over considerable reinforcements to our troops there, and shall continue to send more as circumstances may require. There has been a little skir∣mishing and irregular firing kept up between their and our advanced guards, in which colonel Martin of the Jersey levies has received a wound in his breast, which, it is ap∣prehended, will prove mortal; a private has had his leg broke by a cannon-ball, and another has received a shot in the groin from their musketry. This is all the damage they have yet done us:—what they have sustained, is not known.</P>
<P>The shifting and changing the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of course put it out of my power to transmit a general one of the army. However, I believe our strength is much the same as it was when the last was made, with the ad∣dition, of nine militia regiments come from the State of Connecticut, averaging about three hundred and fifty men each. These are nine of the fourteen regiments mention∣ed in my letter of the nineteenth. Our people still con∣tinue to be very sickly.</P>
<P>The papers designed for the foreign troops have been put into several channels, in order that they might be conveyed to them; and, from the information I had yes∣terday, I have reason to believe many have fallen into their hands.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a copy of lord Drummond's second let∣ter (in answer to mine) which I received since I trans∣mitted his first, and which I have thought necessary to lay before Congress, that they may possess the whole of the
<PB N="227" REF="029737_0226_0FE249519ABEF068"/>
correspondence between us, and see how far he has excul∣pated himself from the charge alleged against him. The log-book he mentions to have sent colonel Moylan proves nothing in his favour. That shews he had been at Ber∣muda, and from thence to some other island, on his pas∣sage from which to this place, the vessel he was in was boarded by a pilot who brought her into the Hook, where he found the British fleet, which his lordship avers he did not expect were there, having understood their destination was to the southward.</P>

<P>I THIS minute returned from our lines on Long-Island, where I left his excellency the General. From him I have it in command to inform Congress, that yes∣terday he went there, and continued till evening, when, from the enemy's having landed a considerable part of their forces,—and many of their movements,—there was reason to apprehend they would make in a little time a general attack. As they would have a wood to pass through before they could approach the lines, it was thought expedient to place a number of men there on the different roads leading from where they were stationed, in order to harass and annoy them in their march. This being done, early this morning a smart engagement ensued between the enemy and our detachments, which, being unequal to the force they had to contend with, have sus∣tained a pretty considerable loss: at least many of our men are missing. Among those that have not returned, are generals Sullivan and lord Stirling. The enemy's loss is not known certainly: but we are told by such of our troops as were in the engagement and have come in, that they had many killed and wounded. Our party brought off a lieutenant, serjeant, and coporal, with twen∣ty privates, prisoners.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="029737_0227_0FE249011AA23CC0"/>
While these detachments were engaged, a column of the enemy descended from the woods, and marched to∣wards the centre of our lines with a design to make an impression, but were repulsed. This evening they ap∣peared very numerous about the skirts of the woods, where they have pitched several tents: and his excellency in∣clines to think they mean to attack and force us from our lines by way of regular approaches, rather than in any other manner.</P>
<P>To-day, five ships of the line came up towards the town, where they seemed desirous of getting, as they turn∣ed a long time against an unfavourable wind: and on my return this evening, I found a deserter from the twenty-third regiment, who informed me that they design, as soon as the wind will permit them to come up, to give us a severe cannonade, and to silence our batteries, if possible. I have the honour to be, in great haste, Sir, your most obedient,</P>

<P>I WAS last night honoured with your favour of the twenty-seventh, accompanied by sundry resolutions of Congress. Those respecting the officers, &amp;c. that may be wounded in the service of the States, are founded much in justice, and (I should hope) may be productive of ma∣ny salutary consequences. As to the encouragement to the Hessian officers, I wish it may have the desired effect. Perhaps it might have been better had the offer been sooner made.</P>
<P>Before this, you will probably have received a letter from Mr. Harrison, of the twenty-seventh, advising of the engagement between a detachment of our men and the enemy on that day. I am sorry to inform Congress that I have not yet heard either of general Sullivan or lord Stirling, who (they would observe) were among the missing after the engagement: nor can I ascertain our loss. I am hopeful, part of our men will yet get in: several did yesterday morning. That of the enemy is also un∣certain:

the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ounts are various. I incline to think they suffered a good deal. Some deserters say five hun∣dred were killed and wounded.</P>
<P>There was some skirmishing, the greatest part of yes∣terday, between parties from the enemy and our people: in the evening it was pretty smart. The event I have not yet learned.</P>
<P>The weather of late has been extremely wet. Yester∣day it rained severely the whole afternoon, which dis∣tressed our people much,—not having a sufficiency of tents to cover them, and what we have, not being got over yet. I am in hopes they will all be got to-day, and that they will be more comfortably provided, though the great scarcity of these articles distresses us beyond meas∣ure, not having any thing like a sufficient number to pro∣tect our people from the inclemency of the weather;—which has occasioned much sickness, and the men to be almost broken down.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLINATION as well as duty would have in∣duced me to give Congress the earliest information of my removal and that of the troops, from Long-Island and its dependencies, to this city, the night before last: but the extreme fatigue which myself and family have undergone, as much from the weather since as the engagement on the twenty-seventh, rendered me and them entirely unfit to take pen in hand. Since Monday, scarce any of us have been out of the lines till our passage across the East-river was effected yesterday morning; and, for forty-eight hours preceding that, I had hardly been off my horse, and never closed my eyes; so that I was quite unfit to write or dic∣tate till this morning.</P>
<P>Our retreat was made without any loss of men or am∣munition, and in better order than I expected from troops in the situation ours were. We brought off all our cannon and stores, except a few heavy pieces, which, in the condition the earth was by a long-continued rain, we
<PB N="230" REF="029737_0229_0FE249092AF84650"/>
found, upon trial, impracticable. The wheels of the car∣riages sinking up to the hobs rendered it impossible for our whole force to drag them. We left but little provisions on the island, except some cattle which had been driven within our lines, and which, after many attempts to force across the water, we found impossible to effect, circum∣stanced as we were.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a copy of the council of war held pre∣vious to the retreat, to which I beg leave to refer Congress for the reasons, or many of them, that led to the adoption of that measure.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening and last night, a party of our men were employed in bringing our stores, cannon, tents, &amp;c. from Governor's-Island, which they nearly completed. Some of the heavy cannon remain there still, but (I ex∣pect) will be got away to-day.</P>
<P>In the engagement on the twenty-seventh, generals Sullivan and Stirling were made prisoners. The former has been permitted, on his parole, to return for a little time. From my lord Stirling I had a letter by general Sullivan (a copy of which I have the honour to transmit) that contains his information of the engagement with his brigade. It is not so full and certain as I could wish:—he was hurried most probably, as his letter was unfinished:—nor have I been yet able to obtain an exact account of our loss;—we suppose it from seven hundred to a thousand killed and taken.</P>
<P>General Sullivan says lord Howe is extremely desirous of seeing some of the members of Congress; for which purpose he was allowed to come out, and to communicate to them what has passed between him and his lordship. I have consented to his going to Philadelphia, as I do not mean, or conceive it right, to withhold, or prevent him from giving, such information as he possesses in this in∣stance.</P>
<P>I am much hurried and engaged in arranging and mak∣ing new dispositions of our forces; the movements of the enemy requiring them to be immediately had;—and there∣fore have only time to add, that I am, with my best re∣gards to Congress, their and your most obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my intelligence of late has been rather unfavour∣able, and would be received with anxiety and concern, pe∣culiarly happy should I esteem myself, were it in my pow∣er at this time to transmit such information to Congress, as would be more pleasing and agreeable to their wishes:—but, unfortunately for me,—unfortunately for them,—it is not.</P>
<P>Our situation is truly distressing. The check our de∣tachment sustained on the twenty-seventh ultimo has dis∣pirited too great a proportion of our troops, and filled their minds with apprehension and despair. The militia, instead of calling forth their utmost efforts to a brave and manly opposition in order to repair our losses, are dismayed, in∣tractable, and impatient to return. Great numbers of them have gone off,—in some instances, almost by whole regiments, by half ones, and by companies at a time. This circumstance, of itself, independent of others, when fronted by a well-appointed enemy superior in number to our whole collected force, would be sufficiently disagreea∣ble:—but, when their example has infected another part of the army,—when their want of discipline, and refusal of almost every kind of restraint and government, have pro∣duced a like conduct but too common to the whole, and an entire disregard of that order and subordination necessa∣ry to the well doing of an army, and which had been in∣culcated before, as well as the nature of our military es∣tablishment would admit of,—our condition is still more alarming: and with the deepest concern I am obliged to confess my want of confidence in the generality of the troops.</P>
<P>All these circumstances fully confirm the opinion I ev∣er entertained, and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of mentioning to Congress, that no depend∣ence could be put in a militia, or other troops than those enlisted and embodied for a longer period than our regula∣tions heretofore have prescribed. I am persuaded, and as fully convinced as I am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties must of necessity be greatly hazarded if not entirely lost, if their defence is left to any but a per∣manent
<PB N="232" REF="029737_0231_0FE2490BDBE2CF28"/>
standing army,—I mean, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>xist during the war. Nor would the expense, incident to the support of such a body of troops as would be competent to almost every exigency, far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in succour, and new enlistments, which, when ef∣fected, are not attended with any good consequences. Men who have been free, and subject to no control, cannot be reduced to order in an instant; and the privileges and exemptions they claim and will have, influence the con∣duct of others; and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the disorder, irregularity, and confusion they occasion.</P>
<P>I cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to produce the desired effect. When men can get double that sum to engage for a month or two in the militia, and that militia frequently called out, it is hardly to be expect∣ed. The addition of land might have a considerable in∣fluence on a permanent enlistment.</P>
<P>Our number of men at present fit for duty is under twenty thousand; they were so by the last returns and best accounts I could get after the engagement on Long-Island; since which, numbers have deserted. I have or∣dered general Mercer to send the men intended for the flying camp to this place, about a thousand in number, and to try with the militia, if practicable, to make a diversion upon Staten-Island.</P>
<P>Till of late, I had no doubt in my own mind, of de∣fending this place: nor should I have yet, if the men would do their duty: but this I despair of. It is painful, and ex∣tremely grating to me, to give such unfavourable accounts: but it would be criminal to conceal the truth at so critical a juncture. Every power I possess shall be exerted to serve the cause; and my first wish is, that, whatever may be the event, the Congress will do me the justice to think so.</P>
<P>If we should be obliged to abandon the town, ought it to stand as winter quarters for the enemy? They would derive great conveniences from it on the one hand; and much property would be destroyed on the other. It is an important question, but will admit of but little time for de∣liberation. At present I dare say the enemy mean to pre∣serve it if they can. If Congress therefore should resolve
<PB N="233" REF="029737_0232_0FE2495D85B1FE18"/>
upon the destruction of it, the resolution should be a pro∣found secret, as the knowledge of it will make a capital change in their plans.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the second, our affairs have not undergone a change for the better, nor assumed a more agreeable aspect than what they then wore. The militia, under various pretences, of sick∣ness, &amp;c. are daily diminishing; and in a little time, I am persuaded, their number will be very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>On Monday night a forty-gun ship passed up the Sound between Governor's and Long-Island, and anchored in Turtle-bay. In her passage she received a discharge of cannon from our batteries, but without any damage; and, having a favourable wind and tide, soon got out of their reach. Yesterday morning I dispatched major Crane of the artillery, with two twelve-pounders and a howitzer, to annoy her; who, hulling her several times, forced her from that station, and to take shelter behind an island, where she still continues. There are several other ships of war in the Sound, with a good many transports or store-ships which came round Long-Island, so that that communication is entirely cut off. The admiral, with the main body of the fleet, is close in with Governor's-Island.</P>
<P>Judging it expedient to guard against every contingency as far as our peculiar situation will admit, and that we may have resources left if obliged to abandon this place, I have sent away and am removing above Kingsbridge all our stores that are unnecessary, and that will not be immedi∣ately wanted.</P>
<P>I have inclosed several original letters from some of our officers prisoners at Quebec, which fell into general Gates's hands, and were transmitted by him to general Schuyler who sent them to me. General Gates adds, that the per∣sons who brought them said general Burgoyne had sent messages to the inhabitants upon the lakes; inviting their
<PB N="234" REF="029737_0233_0FE2490D5F2D6A30"/>
continuance on their farms, and assuring them that they should remain in security.</P>
<P>The post-master having removed his office from the city to Dobbs's-ferry, as it is said, makes it extremely incon∣venient, and will be the means of my not giving such con∣stant and regular intelligence as I could wish. Cannot some mode be devised, by which we may have a pretty constant and certain intercourse and communication kept up? It is an interesting matter, and of great importance; and, as such, I am persuaded, will meet with due attention from Congress.</P>
<P>I have transmitted the copy of general Gates's letter as sent me by general Schuyler, from which Congress will discover all the information I have respecting general Bur∣goyne's message, and my latest intelligence from Ticonde∣roga, with the returns of the army there. Those of the army here it is, impossible to obtain, till the hurry and bus∣tle we are now in are a little over.</P>

<P>I WAS last night honoured with your favour of the third, with sundry resolutions of Congress; and perceiving it to be their opinion and determination that no damage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be done the city in case we are obliged to abandon it, I shall take every measure in my power to prevent it.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the fourth, nothing very material has occurred, unless it is that the fleet seem to be drawing more together, and all getting close in with Governor's-Island. Their designs we cannot learn; nor have we been able to procure the least information of late, of any of their plans or intended operations.</P>
<P>As the enemy's movements are very different from what we expected,—and, from their large encampments a
<PB N="235" REF="029737_0234_0FE2495F09E69390"/>
considerable distance up the Sound, there is reason to be∣lieve they intend to make a landing above or below Kings∣bridge, and thereby to hem in our army, and cut off the communication with the country,—I mean to call a coun∣cil of general officers to-day or to-morrow, and endeavour to digest and fix upon some regular and certain system of conduct to be pursued in order to battle their efforts and counteract their schemes; and also to determine of the ex∣pediency of evacuating or attempting to maintain the city and the several posts on this island. The result of their opinion and deliberations I shall advise Congress of by the earliest opportunity, which will be by express, having it not in my power to communicate any intelligence by post, as the office is removed to so great a distance, and entirely out of the way.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a list of the officers who are prisoners, and from whom letters have been received by a flag. We know there are others not included in the list.</P>
<P>General Sullivan having informed me that general Howe was willing that an exchange of him for general Prescot should take place, it will be proper to send general Prescot immediately, that it may be effected.</P>
<P>As the milltia regiments in all probability will be impa∣tient to return, and become pressing for their pay, I shall be glad of the direction of Congress, whether they are to receive it here or from the conventions or assemblies of the respective States to which they belong. On the one hand, the settlement of their abstracts will be attended with trou∣ble and difficulty: on the other, they will go away much better satisfied, and be more ready to give their aid in future, if they are paid before their departure.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I must take the liberty of mentioning to Congress the great distress we are in for want of money. Two months' pay (and more to some battalions) is now due to the troops here, without any thing in the military chest to satisfy it. This occasions much dissatisfaction, and almost a general uneasiness. Not a day passes without complaints and the most importunate and urgent demands on this head. As it may injure the service greatly, and the want of a regular supply of cash produce consequences of the most fatal tendency, I entreat the attention of Congress
<PB N="236" REF="029737_0235_0FE2490EE3C81860"/>
to this subject, and that we may be provided as soon as can be with a sum equal to every present claim.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Howe, proposing an exchange of general M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald for lord Stirling, and shall be ex∣tremely happy to obtain it, as well as that of general Sul∣livan for general Prescot, being greatly in want of them, and under the necessity of appointing, pro tempore, some of the colonels to command brigades.</P>

<P>Before the landing of the enemy on Long-Island, the point of attack could not be known, or any satisfactory judgment formed of their intentions. It might be on Long-Island, or Bergen, or directly on the city. This made it necessary to be prepared for each, and has occa∣sioned an expense of labour which now seems useless, and is regretted by those who form a judgment from after-knowledge. But I trust, men of discernment will think differently, and see that by such works and preparations we have not only delayed the operations of the campaign till it is too late to effect any capital incursion into the country, but have drawn the enemy's forces to one point and obliged them to [<HI>disclose</HI>] their plan, so as to enable us to form our defence on some certainty.</P>
<P>It is now extremely obvious from all intelligence,—from their movements, and every other circumstance,—that having landed their whole army on Long-Island (except about four thousand on Staten-Island) they mean to inclose us on the island of New-York, by taking post in our rear while the shipping effectually secure the front; and thus, either by cutting off our communication with the country, oblige us to fight them on their own terms, or surrender at discretion,—or by a brilliant stroke en∣deavour to cut this army in pieces, and secure the col∣lection of arms and stores, which they well know we shall not be able soon to replace.</P>
<P>Having therefore their system unfolded to us, it became an important consideration how it could be most success∣fully opposed. On every side there is a choice of diffi∣culties; and every measure on our part (however painful the reflection is from experience) to be formed with some apprehension that all our troops will not do their duty. In deliberating on this great question, it was impossible to forget, that history, our own experience, the advice of our ablest friends in Europe, the fears of the enemy, and even the declarations of Congress, demonstrate, that on our side the war should be defensive—(it has ever been called a war of posts)—that we should on all occasions avoid a general action, nor put any thing to the risk, un∣less
<PB N="238" REF="029737_0237_0FE24916E3718838"/>
compelled by a necessity into which we ought never to be drawn.</P>
<P>The arguments on which such a system was founded were deemed unanswerable; and experience has given her sanction. With these views, and being fully persuaded that it would be presumption to draw out our young troops into open ground against their superiors both in number and discipline, I have never spared the spade and pickaxe. I confess I have not found that readiness to defend even strong posts at all hazards, which is necessary to derive the greatest benefit from them. The honour of making a brave defence does not seem to be a sufficient stimulus when suc∣cess is very doubtful, and the falling into the enemy's hands probable: but I doubt not, this will be gradually attained. We are now in a strong post, but not an impregnable one, nay, acknowledged by every man of judgment to be unten∣able, unless the enemy will make the attack upon lines when they can avoid it, and their movements indicate that they mean to do so.</P>
<P>To draw the whole army together in order to arrange the defence proportionate to the extent of lines and works, would leave the country open for an approach, and put the fate of this army and its stores on the hazard of making a successful defence in the city, or the issue of an engagement out of it. On the other hand, to abandon a city which has been by some deemed defensible, and on whose works much labour has been bestowed, has a tendency to dispirit the troops and enfeeble our cause. It has also been con∣sidered as the key to the northern country. But as to that, I am fully of opinion that the establishing of strong posts at Mount-Washington on the upper part of this island, and on the Jersey side opposite to it, with the as∣sistance of the obstructions already made (and which may be improved) in the water, not only the navigation of Hudson's-river, but an easier and better communication may be more effectually secured between the northern and southern States. This, I believe, every one acquainted with the situation of the country will readily agree to; and it will appear evident to those who have an opportuni∣ty of recurring to good maps.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="029737_0238_0FE2496AC199D210"/>
These and many other consequences, which will be in∣volved in the determination of our next measure, have given our minds full employ, and led every one to form a judgment as the various objects presented themselves to his view.</P>
<P>The post at Kingsbridge is naturally strong, and is pretty well fortified: the heights about it are command∣ing, and might soon be made more so. These are im∣portant objects, and I have attended to them accordingly. I have also removed from the city all the stores and am∣munition except what was absolutely necessary for its de∣fence, and made every other disposition that did not es∣sentially interfere with that object,—carefully keeping in view, until it should be absolutely determined on full consideration, how far the city was to be defended at all events.</P>
<P>In resolving points of such importance, many circum∣stances peculiar to our own army also occur. Being only provided for a summer's campaign, their clothes, shoes, and blankets, will soon be unfit for the change of weather which we every day feel. At present we have not tents for more than two thirds, many of them old and worn out: but if we had a plentiful supply, the season will not admit of continuing in them long. The case of our sick is also worthy of much consideration. Their number, by the returns, forms at least one fourth of the army. Policy and humanity require they should be made as comfort∣able as possible.</P>
<P>With these and many other circumstances before them, the whole council of general officers met yesterday in order to adopt some general line of conduct to be pursued at this important crisis. I intended to have procured their sepa∣rate opinions on each point; but time would not admit. I was therefore obliged to collect their sense more generally than I could have wished. All agreed the town would not be tenable if the enemy resolved to bombard and can∣nonade it: but the difficulty attending a removal operated so strongly, that a course was taken between abandoning it totally and concentring our whole strength for its defence: nor were some a little influenced in their opinion, to whom the determination of Congress was known, against an evac∣uation
<PB N="240" REF="029737_0239_0FE24919A30368D0"/>
totally, as they were led to suspect Congress wished it to be maintained at every hazard.</P>
<P>It was concluded to arrange the army under three divi∣sions;—five thousand to remain for the defence of the city;—nine thousand to Kingsbridge and its dependencies, as well to possess and secure those posts, as to be ready to attack the enemy who are moving eastward on Long-Isl∣and, if they should attempt to land on this side;—the re∣mainder to occupy the intermediate space, and support ei∣ther;—that the sick should be immediately removed to Orangetown, and barracks prepared at Kingsbridge with all expedition to cover the troops.</P>
<P>There were some general officers, in whose judgment and opinion much confidence is to be reposed, that were for a total and immediate removal from the city,—urging the great danger of one part of the army being cut off be∣fore the other can support it, the extremities being at least sixteen miles apart;—that our army, when collected, is inferior to the enemy;—that they can move with their whole force to any point of attack, and consequently must succeed by weight of numbers, if they have only a part to oppose them;—that, by removing from hence, we deprive the enemy of the advantage of their ships, which will make at least one half of the force to attack the town;—that we should keep the enemy at bay, put nothing to the hazard, but at all events keep the army together, which may be recruited another year;—that the unspent stores will also be preserved; and, in this case, the heavy artille∣ry can also be secured. But they were overruled by a majority, who thought for the present a part of our force might be kept here, and attempt to maintain the city a while longer.</P>
<P>I am sensible a retreating army is encircled with diffi∣culties; that the declining an engagement subjects a gener∣al to reproach; and that the common cause may be affect∣ed by the discouragement it may throw over the minds of many. Nor am I insensible of the contrary effects, if a brilliant stroke could be made with any probability of suc∣cess, especially after our loss upon Long-Island. But, when the fate of America may be at stake on the issue, when the wisdom of cooler moments and experienced men
<PB N="241" REF="029737_0240_0FE2496C7A6599A8"/>
have decided that we should protract the war if possible, I cannot think it safe or wise to adopt a different system when the season for action draws so near a close.</P>
<P>That the enemy mean to winter in New-York, there can be no doubt:—that, with such an armament, they can drive us out, is equally clear. The Congress having re∣solved that it should not be destroyed, nothing seems to remain, but to determine the time of their taking posses∣sion. It is our interest and wish to prolong it as much as possible, provided the delay does not affect our future measures.</P>
<P>The militia of Connecticut is reduced, from six thou∣sand, to less than two thousand, and in a few days will be merely nominal. The arrival of some Maryland troops, &amp;c. from the flying camp, has in a great degree supplied the loss of men: but the ammunition they have carried away will be a loss sensibly felt. The impulse for going home was so irresistible, it answered no purpose to oppose it. Though I would not discharge, I have been obliged to acquiesce; and it affords one more melancholy proof, how delusive such dependencies are.</P>
<P>Inclosed I have the honour to transmit a general return, the first I have been able to procure for some time; also a report of captain Newel from our works at Horn's-Hook or Hell-gate. Their situation is extremely low, and the Sound so very narrow, that the enemy have them much within their command.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday honoured with your favour of the eighth instant, accompanied by sundry resolutions of Con∣gress, to which I shall pay the strictest attention, and, in the instances required, make them the future rule of my conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="029737_0241_0FE2491B26231790"/>
The mode of nego<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iation pursued by lord Howe I did not approve of; but as general Sullivan was sent out upon the business, and with a message to Congress, I could not conceive myself at liberty to interfere in the matter, as he was in the character of a prisoner, and totally subject to their power and direction.</P>
<P>The list of prisoners, before omitted through hurry, is now inclosed; though it will probably have reached Con∣gress before this. I shall write by the first opportunity for major Hawsackse to repair to Philadelphia—(he is in the northern army;)—and will also mention the several ap∣pointments in consequence of colonel St. Clair's promo∣tion.</P>
<P>As soon as generals Prescot and M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald arrive, I shall take measures to advise general Howe of it, that the proposed exchange for general Sullivan and lord Stirling may be carried into execution.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the eighth, nothing material has oc∣curred, except that the enemy have possessed themselves of Montezore's-island, and landed a considerable number of troops upon it. This island lies in the mouth of Haerlem-river, which runs out of the Sound into the North-river, and will give the enemy an easy opportunity of landing either on the low grounds of Morrisania, if their views are to seize and possess the passes above Kingsbridge, or on the plains of Haerlem, if they design to intercept and cut off the communication between our several posts. I am making every disposition and arrangement that the divided state of our troops will admit of, and which ap∣pear most likely and the best calculated to oppose their attacks; for I presume there will be several. How the event will be, God only knows: but you may be assured that nothing in my power, circumstanced as I am, shall be wanting, to effect a favourable and happy issue.</P>
<P>By my letter of the eighth you would perceive that several of the council were for holding the town, con∣ceiving it practicable for some time. Many of them now, upon seeing our divided state, have altered their opinion, and allow the expediency and necessity of concentring our whole force, or drawing it more together. Convinced of the propriety of this measure, I am ordering our stores
<PB N="243" REF="029737_0242_0FE2496E027C5E28"/>
away, except such as may be absolutely necessary to keep as long as any troops remain; that, if an evacuation of the city becomes inevitable (which certainly must be the case) there may be as little to remove as possible.</P>
<P>The inclosed packet contains several letters for particu∣lar members of Congress and for some gentlemen in Phil∣adelphia. They came to hand yesterday, and were brought from France by a captain Levez lately arrived at Bedford in the Massachusetts State. I must request the favour of you to open the packet, and to have the letters put in a proper channel of conveyance to the gentlemen they are addressed to.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HIS excellency being called from Head-Quarters to∣day on business of importance which prevents his writing, I therefore do myself the honour to inform Congress of what has happened since his letter of yesterday.</P>
<P>Last evening the enemy transported a number of men from Buchanan's to Montezore's-island, and, by their several movements, more strongly indicate their intention to land somewhere about Haerlem or Morrisania,—most likely, at both at the same time. This morning one of the ships that have been for some time in the Sound mov∣ed down towards Hell-gate; but, the tide leaving her, she could not get near enough to bring her guns to bear upon our fortification. If she means to attack it, it is probable she will warp in the next tide. Their batteries have kept up a pretty constant fire against ours at that place, but without any considerable effect. This morn∣ing they opened a new one.</P>
<P>I do not recollect any other material occurrence, and shall only add, that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favour of the tenth, with the resolution of Congress which accompani∣ed
<PB N="244" REF="029737_0243_0FE2491CAAF373F0"/>
it, and thank them for the confidence they repose i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my judgment respecting the evacuation of the city. I could wish to maintain it, because I know it to be of im∣portance: but I am fully convinced that it cannot be done, and that an attempt for that purpose, if persevered in, might and most certainly would be attended with conse∣quences the most fatal and alarming in their nature.</P>
<P>Sensible of this, several of the general officers, since the determination of the council mentioned in my last, petitioned that a second council might be called to recon∣sider the propositions which had been before them upon the subject. Accordingly I called one on the twelfth, when a large majority not only determined a removal of the army prudent, but absolutely necessary,—declaring they were entirely convinced from a full and minute inquiry into our situation, that it was extremely perilous; and, from every movement of the enemy, and the intelligence received, their plan of operations was to get in our rear, and, by cutting off the communication with the main, oblige us to force a passage through them on the terms they wish, or to become prisoners in some short time for want of necessary supplies of provision.</P>
<P>We are now taking every method in our power to re∣move the stores, &amp;c, in which we find almost insuperable difficulties. They are so great and so numerous, that I fear we shall not effect the whole before we meet with some interruption. I fully expected that an attack some∣where would have been made last night. In that I was disappointed; and happy shall I be, if my apprehensions of one to-night, or in a day or two, are not confirmed by the event. If it is deferred a little while longer, I flatter myself all will be got away, and our force be more con∣centred, and of course more likely to resist them with success.</P>
<P>Yesterday afternoon, four ships of war, two of forty and two of twenty-eight guns, went up the East-river, passing between Governor's and Long-Island, and anchored about a mile above the city, opposite Mr. Stivansent's, where the Rose man-of-war was lying before. The design of their going not being certainly known, gives rise to various con∣jectures,—some supposing they are to cover the landing of
<PB N="245" REF="029737_0244_0FE2496F84DA14A8"/>
a party of the enemy above the city,—others that they are to assist in destroying our battery at Horn's-hook, that they may have a free and uninterrupted navigation in the Sound. It is an object of great importance to them, and what they are industriously trying to effect by a pretty constant can∣nonade and bombardment.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would beg leave to mention to Congress, that the pay now allowed to nurses for their at∣tendance on the sick is by no means adequate to their ser∣vices; the consequence of which is, that they are extremely difficult to procure: indeed they are not to be got; and we are under the necessity of substituting in their place a number of men from the respective regiments, whose service by that means is entirely lost in the proper line of their du∣ty, and but little benefit rendered to the sick. The officers I have talked with upon the subject all agree that they should be allowed a dollar per week, and that for less they cannot be had.</P>
<P>Our sick are extremely numerous, and we find their re∣moval attended with the greatest difficulty. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> matter that employs much of our time and care; and what makes it more distressing is the want of proper and convenient places for their reception. I fear their sufferings will be great and many. However, nothing on my part, that humanity or policy can require, shall be wanting to make them comfortable, so far as the state of things will ad∣mit of.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Saturday about sunset, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix more of the enemy's ships, one or two of which were men-of-war, passed be∣tween Governor's-island and Red hook, and went up the East-river to the station taken by those mentioned in my last. In half an hour I received two expresses,—one from colonel Serjeant at Horn's-hook [Hell-gate] giving an account that the enemy, to the amount of three or four thousand, had ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched to the river, and were embarking
<PB N="246" REF="029737_0245_0FE24924E536D330"/>
for Barns's or Montezore's-island, where numbers of them were then encamped;—the other from general Mifflin, that uncommon and formidable movements were discovered among the enemy; which being confirmed by the scouts I had sent out, I proceeded to Haerlem, where it was supposed (or at Morrisania opposite to it) the principal at∣tempt to land would be made. However, nothing re∣markable happened that night: but in the morning they began their operations. Three ships of war came up the North-river as high as Bloomingdale, which put a total stop to the removal, by water, of any more of our provi∣sion, &amp;c. and about eleven o'clock those in the East-river began a most severe and heavy cannonade, to scour the grounds, and cover the landing of their troops between Turtle-bay and the city, where breastworks had been thrown up to oppose them.</P>
<P>As soon as I heard the firing, I rode with all possible dispatch towards the place of landing, when, to my great surprise and mortification, I found the troops that had been posted in the lines retreating with the utmost precipitation, and those ordered to support them (Parsons's and Fellows's brigades) flying in every direction, and in the greatest con∣fusion, notwithstanding the exertions of their generals to form them. I used every means in my power to rally and get them into some order: but my attempts were fruitless and ineffectual; and on the appearance of a small party of the enemy, not more than sixty or seventy, their disorder increased, and they ran away in the greatest confusion, without firing a single shot.</P>
<P>Finding that no confidence was to be placed in these brigades, and apprehending that another party of the ene∣my might pass over to Haerlem plains and cut off the re∣treat to this place, I sent orders to secure the heights in the best manner with the troops that were stationed on and near them; which being done, the retreat was effected with but little or no loss of men, though, of a considerable part of our baggage,—occasioned by this disgraceful and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stardly conduct. Most of our heavy cannon, and a part of our stores and provisions which we were about removing, was unavoidably left in the city, though every means (after
<PB N="247" REF="029737_0246_0FE2497B31964A48"/>
it had been determined in council to evacuate the post) had been used to prevent it.</P>
<P>We are now encamped with the main body of the army on the heights of Haerlem, where I should hope the ene∣my would meet with a defeat in case of an attack, if the generality of our troops would behave with tolerable brave∣ry. But experience to my extreme affliction has convinc∣ed me, that this is rather to be wished for than expected. However, I trust that there are many who will act like men, and shew themselves worthy of the blessings of freedom.</P>
<P>I have sent out some reconnoitring parties to gain intel∣ligence, if possible, of the disposition of the enemy, and shall inform Congress of every material event by the earliest opportunity.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my letter of the sixteenth contained intelligence of an important nature, and such as might lead Congress to expect that the evacuation of New-York and retreat to the heights of Haerlem, in the manner they were made, would be succeeded by some other interesting event, I beg leave to inform them that as yet nothing has been attempt∣ed upon a large and general pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of attack.</P>
<P>About the time of the post's departure with my letter, the enemy appeared in several large bodies upon the plains about two and a half miles from hence. I rode down to our advanced posts, to put matters in a proper situation if they should attempt to come on. When I arrived there I heard a firing, which, I was informed, was between a party of our rangers under the command of lieutenant-col∣onel Knolton, and an advanced party of the enemy. Our men came in and told me that the body of the enemy, who kept themselves concealed, consisted of about three hundred as near as they could guess. I immediately ordered three companies of colonel Weeden's regiment from Virginia, under the command of major Leitch, and colonel Knolton with his rangers composed of volunteers from different
<PB N="248" REF="029737_0247_0FE2497CB458C1C0"/>
New-England regiments to try to get in their rear, while a disposition was making as if to attack them in front, and thereby draw their whole attention that way.</P>
<P>This took effect as I wished on the part of the enemy. On the appearance of our party in front, they immediately ran down the hill, took possession of some fences and bush∣es, and a smart firing began, but at too great a distance to do much execution on either side. The parties under col∣onel Knolton and major Leitch unluckily began their at∣tack too soon, as it was rather in flank than in rear. In a little time major Leitch was brought off wounded, having received three balls through his side; and in a short time after colonel Knolton got a wound which proved mortal. Their men however persevered, and continued the engage∣ment with the greatest resolution.</P>
<P>Finding that they wanted a support, I advanced part of colonel Griffith's and colonel Richardson's Maryland regi∣ments, with some detachments from the eastern regiments who were nearest the place of action. These troops charg∣ed the enemy with great intrepidity, and drove them from the wood into the plain, and were pushing them from thence (having silenced their fire in a great measure) when I judged it prudent to order a retreat, fearing the enemy (as I have since found was really the case) were sending a large body to support their party.</P>
<P>Major Leitch, I am in hopes, will recover: but colonel Knolton's fall is much to be regretted, as that of a brave and good officer. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad about forty wounded: the number of slain is not yet ascertained: but it is very in∣considerable.</P>
<P>By a sergeant who deserted from the enemy and came in this morning, I find that their party was greater than I imagined. It consisted of the second battalion of light in∣fantry, a battalion of the royal Highlanders, and three companies of Hessian riflemen, under the command of brigadier-general Leslie. The deserter reports that their loss in wounded and missing was eighty-nine, and eight killed. In the latter, his account is too small, as our peo∣ple discovered and buried double that number. This af∣fair, I am in hopes, will be attended with many salutary consequences, as it seems to have greatly inspirited the
<PB N="249" REF="029737_0248_0FE2497E378FB1A0"/>
whole of our troops. The sergeant further adds that a considerable body of men are now encamped from the East to the North-river, between the seven and eight-mile stones, under the command of general Clinton. General Howe, he believes, has his quarters at Mr. Apthorp's house.</P>

<P>P. S. I should have wrote to Congress by express be∣fore now, had I not expected the post every minute; which, I flatter myself, will be a sufficient apology for my delaying it. The late losses we have sustained in our bag∣gage and camp necessaries have added much to our distress which was very great before. I must therefore take the liberty of requesting Congress to have forwarded as soon as possible such a supply of tents, blankets, camp-kettles, and other articles, as can be collected.

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you yester∣day, nothing material has occurred. However, it is prob∣able in a little time the enemy will attempt to force us from hence, as we are informed they are bringing many of their heavy cannon towards the heights and the works we have thrown up.

Every disposition is making on our part for de∣fence: and Congress may be assured that I shall do every thing in my power to maintain the post so long as it shall appear, practicable, and conducive to the general good.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of the six∣teenth with its inclosures. To prevent the injury and
<PB N="250" REF="029737_0249_0FE24979AD2C6C30"/>
abuses which would arise from the militia and other troops carrying away ammunition and continental property, I have published the substance of the resolves upon the subject in general orders.</P>
<P>Since my letter of yesterday, nothing of importance has cast up. The enemy are forming a large and extensive encampment in the plains mentioned in my last, and are busily employed in transporting their cannon and stores from Long-Island. As they advance them this way, we may reasonably expect their operations will not long be deferred.</P>
<P>Inclosed are sundry letters, &amp;c. to which Congress will be pleased to pay such regard as they may think them de∣serving of. The letter from monsieur . . . . . came open under cover of one to me. Those from colonel Hand and colonel Ward contain a list of vacancies in their regi∣ments, and of the persons they esteem proper to fill them. The former, I believe, returned no li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t before: the latter says he never got any commissions. Generals Howe and Erskine's proclamations shew the measures that have been pursued, to force and seduce the inhabitants of Long-Island from their allegiance to the States, and to assist in their destruction.</P>
<P>As the period will soon arrive, when the troops com∣posing the present army (a few excepted) will be disband∣ed according to the tenor of their enlistments, and the most fatal consequences may ensue if a suitable and timely pro∣vision is not made in this instance, I take the liberty of suggesting to Congress not only the expediency but the absolute necessity there is that their earliest attention should be had to this subject. In respect to the time that troops should be engaged for, I have frequently given my senti∣ments; nor have I omitted to express my opinion of the difficulties that will attend raising them, nor of the imprac∣ticability of effecting it without the allowance of a large and extraordinary bounty.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy and painful consideration to those who are concerned in the work and have the command, to be forming armies constantly, and to be left by troops just when they begin to deserve the name, or perhaps at a moment when an important blow is expected. This, I
<PB N="251" REF="029737_0250_0FE249DD2AE92350"/>
am informed, will be the case at Ticonderoga with part of the troops there, unless some system is immediately come into, by which they can be induced to stay. General Schuyler tells me in a letter received yesterday, that De Haas's, Maxwell's, and Wind's regiments stand engaged only till the beginning of next month, and that the men, he is fearful, will not remain longer than the time of their enlistment.</P>
<P>I would also beg leave to mention to Congress, that the season is fast approaching when clothes of every kind will be wanted for the army. Their distress is already great, and will be increased as the weather becomes more severe. Our situation is now bad, but is much better than that of the militia that are coming to join us from the States of Massachusetts-Bay and Connecticut in consequence of the requisition of Congress. They, I am informed, have not a single tent or a necessary of any kind; nor can I conceive how it will be possible to support them. These circumstances are extremely alarming, and oblige me to wish Congress to have all the tents, clothing of every kind, and camp necessaries, provided and forwarded, that are to be procured. These eastern reinforcements have not a single necessary, not a pan or a kettle,—in which we are now greatly deficient. It is with reluctance that I trouble Congress with these matters: but to whom can I resort for relief unless to them? The necessity therefore, which urges the application, will excuse it, I am persuaded.</P>
<P>I have not been able to transmit Congress a general re∣turn of the army this week, owing to the peculiar situation of our affairs, and the great shifting and changing among the troops. As soon as I can procure one, a copy shall be forwarded to Congress.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the hours allotted to sleep I will borrow a few moments to convey my thoughts on sundry important matters to Congress. I shall offer them with the sincerity
<PB N="253" REF="029737_0252_0FE249DF123BEC48"/>
which ought to characterize a man of candour, and with the freedom which may be used in giving useful informa∣tion without incurring the imputation of presumption.</P>
<P>We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another disso∣lution of our army. The remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon the occasion last year, the conse∣quences which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been taken by the enemy, added to a knowledge of the present temper and situation of the troops, reflect but a very gloomy prospect upon the appearances of things now, and satisfy me beyond the possibility of doubt, that, unless some speedy and effectual measures are adopted by Congress, our cause will be lost.</P>
<P>It is in vain to expect that any or more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the service on the encour∣agement offered by Congress. When men find that their townsmen and companions are receiving twenty, thirty, and more dollars, for a few months' service (which is truly the case,) it cannot be expected, without using compulsion; and to force them into the service would answer no valua∣ble purpose. When men are irritated, and the passions in∣flamed, they fly hastily and cheerfully to arms: but after the first emotions are over * * *, a soldier, reasoned with upon the goodness of the cause he is engaged in and the inestimable rights he is contending for, hears you with pa∣tience, and acknowledges the truth of your observations, but adds that it is of no more importance to him than others. The officer makes you the same reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not support him, and he cannot ruin himself and family to serve his country, when every member of the community is equally interested and benefited by his labours. * * *</P>
<P>It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this contest is not likely to be the work of a day,—as the war must be carried on systematically,—and to do it you must have good officers,—there are, in my judgment, no other possible means to obtain them but by establishing your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your officers good pay. This will induce gentlemen and men of character to en∣gage: and, till the bulk of your officers are composed of such persons as are actuated by principles of honour and a
<PB N="254" REF="029737_0253_0FE24989AFD18038"/>
spirit of enterprise, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have such allowances as will enable them to live like and support the characters of gentlemen. * * * Besides, something is due to the man who puts his life in <HI>[your]</HI> hands, hazards his health, and forsakes the sweets of domestic enjoyment. Why a captain in the continen∣tal service should receive no more than five shillings cur∣rency per day for performing the same duties that an officer of the same rank in the British service receives ten shillings sterling for, I never could conceive, especially when the latter is provided with every necessary he requires upon the best terms, and the former can scarce procure them at any rate. There is nothing that gives a man consequence and renders him fit for command, like a support that renders him independent of every body but the State he serves.</P>
<P>With respect to the men, nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a permanent establishment: and for no shorter time than the continuance of the war, ought they to be engaged; as facts incontestibly prove that the diffi∣culty and cost of enlistments increase with time. When the army was first raised at Cambridge, I am persuaded the men might have been got, without a bounty, for the war. After this, they began to see that the contest was not likely to end so speedily as was imagined, and to feel their consequence by remarking, that, to get in the militia in the course of the last year, many towns were induced to give them a bounty.</P>
<P>Foreseeing the evils resulting from this, and the de∣structive consequences which unavoidably would follow short enlistments, I took the liberty in a long letter (date not now recollected, as my letter-book is not here) to rec∣ommend the enlistments for and during the war, assigning such reasons for it as experience has since convinced me were well founded. At that time, twenty dollars would, I am persuaded, have engaged the men for this term. But it will not do to look back: and, if the present opportunity is slipped, I am persuaded that twelve months more will increase our difficulties four-fold. I shall therefore take the freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty be immediately offered, aided by the proffer of at least a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres of land, and a suit of
<PB N="255" REF="029737_0254_0FE249E097E43218"/>
clothes and blanket to each non-commissioned officer and soldier; as I have good authority for saying, that, however high the men's pay may appear, it is barely sufficient, in the present scarcity and dearness of all kinds of goods, to keep them in clothes, much less afford support to their families.</P>
<P>If this encouragement then is given to the men, and such pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen of character and liberal sentiments to engage, and proper care and precaution used in the nomination (having more re∣gard to the characters of persons than the number of men they can enlist,) we should in a little time have an army able to cope with any that can be opposed to it, as there are excellent materials to form one out of. But while the only merit an officer possesses is his ability to raise men,—while those men consider and treat him as an equal, and (in the character of an officer) regard him no more than a broomstick, being mixed together as one common herd, no order nor discipline can prevail; nor will the officer ever meet with that respect which is essentially necessary to due subordination.</P>
<P>To place any dependence upon militia is assuredly rest∣ing upon a broken staff,—men just dragged from the ten∣der scenes of domestic life,—unaccustomed to the din of arms,—totally unacquainted with every kind of military skill; which being followed by a want of confidence in themselves, when opposed to troops regularly trained, dis∣ciplined, and appointed, superior in knowledge and supe∣rior in arms, makes them timid and ready to fly from their own shadows. Besides, the sudden change in their man∣ner of living (particularly in the lodging) brings on sick∣ness in many, impatience in all, and such an unconquera∣ble desire of returning to their respective homes, that it not only produces shameful and scandalous desertions among themselves, but infuses the like spirit into others.</P>
<P>Again; men accustomed to unbounded freedom and no control, cannot brook the restraint which is indispensably necessary to the good order and government of an army; without which, licentiousness and every kind of disorder triumphantly reign. To bring men to a proper degree of subordination is not the work of a day, a month, or even
<PB N="256" REF="029737_0255_0FE2498B34D5F870"/>
a year: and, unhappily for us and the cause we are enga∣ged in, the little discipline I have been labouring to estab∣lish in the army under my immediate command is in a manner done away, by having such a mixture of troops as have been called together within these few months.</P>
<P>Relaxed and unfit as our rules and regulations of war are for the government of an army, the militia (those prop∣erly so called; for of these we have two sorts, the six-months-men, and those sent in as a temporary aid) do not think themselves subject to them, and therefore take liber∣ties which the soldier is punished for. This creates jeal∣ousy: jealousy begets dissatisfactions; and these by de∣grees ripen into mutiny, keeping the whole army in a con∣fused and disordered state,—rendering the time of those who wish to see regularity and good order prevail, more un∣happy than words can describe. Besides this, such repeated changes take place, that all arrangement is set at nought, and the constant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as fast as adopted.</P>
<P>These, Sir, Congress may be assured, are but a small part of the inconveniences which might be enumerated, and attributed to militia: but there is one that merits particular attention, and that is the expense. Certain I am, that it would be cheaper to keep fifty or a hundred thousand in constant pay, than to depend upon half the number and supply the other half occasionally by militia. The time the latter are in pay before and after they are in camp, assembling and marching,—the waste of ammu∣nition, the consumption of stores, which, in spite of every resolution or requisition of Congress, they must be furnish∣ed with, or sent home,—added to other incidental ex∣penses consequent upon their coming and conduct in camp, surpasses all idea, and destroys every kind of regularity and economy which you could establish among fixed and set∣tled troops, and will, in my opinion, prove (if the scheme is adhered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) the ruin of our cause.</P>
<P>The jealousies of a standing army, and the evils to be apprehended from one, are remote, and, in my judgment, situated and circumstanced as we are, not at all to be dreaded: but the consequences of wanting one, according to my ideas formed from the present view of things, is
<PB N="257" REF="029737_0256_0FE249E21B8CC7B8"/>
certain and inevitable ruin. For, if I was called upon to declare upon oath, whether the militia have been most serviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I should subscribe to the latter. I do not mean by this, however, to arraign the conduct of Congress: in so doing I should equally con∣demn my own measures, if I did not my judgment: but experience, which is the best criterion to work by, so fully, clearly and decisively reprobates the practice of trusting to militia, that no man who regards order, regularity and economy, or who has any regard for his own honour, char∣acter, or peace of mind, will risk them upon this issue. * * *</P>
<P>An army formed of good officers moves like clock∣work: but there is no situation upon earth less enviable nor more distressing than that person's wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s at the head of troops who are regardless of order and discipline, and who are unprovided with almost every necessary. In a word, the difficulties which have forever surrounded me since I have been in the service, and kept my mind con∣stantly upon the stretch,—the wounds which my feelings (as an officer) have received by a thousand things which have happened contrary to my expectation and wishes, * * *—added to a consciousness of my inability to gov∣ern an army composed of such discordant parts, and under such a variety of intricate and perplexing circumstances,—induce not only a belief, but a thorough conviction in my mind, that it will be impossible (unless there is a thorough change in our military system) for me to conduct matters in such a manner as to give satisfaction to the public, which is all the recompense I aim at, or ever wished for.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I must apologize for the liberties taken in this letter, and for the blots and scratchings there∣in, not having time to give it more correctly. With truth I can add, that, with every sentiment of respect and esteem,</P>

<P>HAVING wrote you fully on sundry important subjects this morning, as you will perceive by the letter which accompanies this, I mean principally now to inclose
<PB N="258" REF="029737_0257_0FE2498CB7929FA0"/>
a copy of a letter received from general Howe on Sunday morning, with the lists of the prisoners in his hands,—of those in our possession belonging to the army immediately under his command,—and of my answer, which were omitted to be put in the other. His letter will discover to Congress his refusal to exchange lord Stirling for Mr. M<SUP>c</SUP>Donald, considering the latter only as a major. They will be pleased to determine how he is to be ranked in future.</P>
<P>The number of prisoners according to these returns is greater than what we expected. However, I am inclined to believe, that, among those in the list from Long-Island, are several militia of general Woodhull's party, who were never arranged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this army. As to those taken on the fifteenth, they greatly exceed the number that I supposed fell into their hands in the retreat from the city. At the time that I transmitted an account of that affair, I had not obtained returns, and took the matter upon the offi∣cers' reports. They are difficult to get with certainty at any time. In the skirmish of Monday se'nnight, they could have taken but very few.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I shall take occasion to mention that those returns made with such precision, and the difficulty that will attend the proposed exchange on account of the dispersed and scattered state of the prisoners in our hands, will clearly evince the necessity of appointing commissaries and proper persons to superintend and conduct in such in∣stances. This I took the liberty of urging more than once, as well on account of the propriety of the measure and the saving that would have resulted from it, as that the prison∣ers might be treated with humanity, and have their wants particularly attended to.</P>
<P>I would also observe (as I esteem it my duty) that this army is in want of almost every necessary,—tents, camp kettles, blankets, and clothes of all kinds. But what is to be done with respect to the two last articles, I know not, as the term of enlistment will be nearly expired by the time they can be provided. This may be exhibited as a further proof of the disadvantages attending the levy∣ing of an army upon such a footing as never to know how to keep them without injuring the public or incommoding

The present field-officers of the regiment can∣not claim any right in preference to him, because he ranked above them, and as a captain, when he first entered the service. His conduct as an officer, on the expedition with general Arnold last fall,—his intrepid behaviour in the assault upon Quebec, when the brave Montgomery fell,—the inflexible attachment he professed to our cause during his imprisonment, and which he perseveres in,—added to these, his residence in the place colonel Stephen∣son came from, and his interest and influence in the same circle, and with such men as are to compose such a regi∣ment,—all, in my opinion, entitle him to the favour of Congress, and lead me to believe that in his promotion the States will gain a good and valuable officer for the sort of troops he is particularly recommended to com∣mand. * * *</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour of transmitting to you the inclosed letter from lieutenant-colonel Livingston, with sundry copies of general Delancey's orders, which discover the measures the enemy are pursuing on Long-Island for raising recruits and obtaining supplies of provisions. In con∣sequence of the intelligence they contain, and authentic advices through other channels respecting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se matters, I have sent brigadier-general George Clinton to meet gener∣al Lincoln, who has got as far as Fairfield with part of the troops lately ordered by the Massachusetts assembly, to concert with him and others an expedition across the Sound with those troops, three companies under colonel Livingston, and such further aid as governor. Trumbull can afford, in order to prevent if possible their effecting those important objects, and to assist the inhabitants in the removal of their stock, grain, &amp;c. or in destroying them, that the enemy may not derive any advantage or benefit from them.</P>
<P>The recruiting scheme they are prosecuting with un∣common industry; nor is it confined to Long-Island alone. Having just now received a letter from the committee of West-Chester county, advising that there are several com∣panies of men in that and Duchess county preparing to go off and join the king's army, I have given directions to our guard-boats and the centries at our works at Mount-Washington to keep a strict look-out in case they attempt to come down the North-river; also to general Heath at Kingsbridge, that the utmost vigilance may be observed by the regiments and troops stationed above there and down
<PB N="262" REF="029737_0261_0FE24996EFAE44B0"/>
towards the East-river, that they may intercept them, should they take that route with a view of crossing to Long-Island. I will use every precaution in my power to pre∣vent those parricides from accomplishing their designs: but I have but little hopes of success, as it will be no difficult matter for them to procure a passage over some part or other of the Sound.</P>
<P>I have been applied to lately by colonel Weedon of Vir∣ginia, for permission to recruit the deficiency of men in his regiment out of the troops composing the flying camp,—informing me at the same time that some of those from Maryland had offered to engage. Colonel Hand of the rifle battalion made a similar application to-day. If the enlistments could be made, they would have this good consequence,—the securing of so many in the service. However, as the measure might occasion some uneasiness in their own corps, and be considered as a hardship by the States to which they belong, and the means of their fur∣nishing more than the quota extracted from them in the general arrangement, and would make it more difficult for them to complete their own levies, I did not conceive myself at liberty to authorise it without submitting the pro∣priety of it to the consideration of Congress, and obtain∣ing their opinion whether it should be allowed or not.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a list of warrants granted from the sec∣ond to the thirtieth ultimo inclusive, the only return of the sort that I have been able to make since the resolution for that purpose,—owing to the unsettled state of our affairs, and my having sent my papers away. You will also receive sundry letters, &amp;c. from general Schuyler, which came under cover to me, and which I have the honour of for∣warding.</P>
<P>By a letter just received from the committee of safety of the State of New-Hampshire, I find a thousand of their militia were about to march on the twenty-fourth ultimo to reinforce this army in consequence of the requisition of Congress. Previous to their march, general Ward writes me he was obliged to furnish them with five hundred pounds of powder and a thousand pounds of musket-ball; and I have little reason to expect that they are better pro∣vided with other articles than they were with ammunition.
<PB N="263" REF="029737_0262_0FE249EF175459E0"/>
In such case they will only add to our present distress which is already far too great, and become disgusted with the service, though the time they are engaged for is only till the first of December. This will injure their enlisting for a longer term, if not wholly prevent it.</P>
<P>By three deserters who came from the Galatea man-of-war about five days ago, we are informed that several trans∣ports had sailed, before they left her, for England, as it was generally reported, in order to return with a supply of provisions, of which they say there is a want. General Mercer, in a letter, informed me that general Thompson said he had heard they were going to dismiss about a hun∣dred of the ships from the service. I am also advised by a letter from Mr. Derby at Boston, of the twenty-sixth ultimo, that, the day before, a transport snow had been taken and sent into Piscataqua by a privateer, in her passage from New-York to the West-Indies. She sailed with five more under the convoy of a man-of-war, in order to bring from thence the troops that are there, to join general Howe. They were all victualled for four months. From this intelligence it would seem as if they did not apprehend any thing to be meditating against them by the court of France.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 3. I have nothing in particular to commu∣nicate respecting our situation, it being much the same as when I wrote last. We had an alarm this morning a lit∣tle before four o'clock, from some of our out-centries, who reported that a large body of the enemy was advan∣cing towards our lines. This put us in motion: however, it turned out entirely premature; or at least we saw noth∣ing of them.</P>

I have no doubt but that the committee will make such report of the state and condition of the army, as will induce Congress to believe that nothing but the most vigorous exertions can put matters upon such a footing as to give this continent a fair prospect of success. Give me leave to say, Sir,—I say it with due deference and respect (and my knowledge of the facts, added to the importance of the cause, and the stake I hold in it, must justify the freedom,)—that your affairs are in a more unpromising way than you seem to apprehend.</P>

True it is, you have voted a larger one in lieu of it: but the season is late; and there is a material difference between voting of battalions and raising of men. In the latter there are more difficulties than Congress are aware of; which makes it my duty (as I have been informed of the prevailing sentiments of this army) to inform them, that, unless the pay of the of∣ficers, especially that of the field-officers, is raised, the chief part of those that are worth retaining will leave the service at the expiration of the present term, as the soldiers will also, if some greater encouragement is not offered them than twenty dollars and a hundred acres of land.</P>
<P>Nothing less, in my opinion, than a suit of clothes an∣nually given to each non-commissioned officer and soldier▪ in addition to the pay and bounty, will avail; and I ques∣tion whether that will do, as the enemy (from the infor∣mation of one John Mash, who, with six others, was ta∣ken by our guards) are giving ten pounds bounty for re∣cruits, and have got a battalion under major Rogers nearly completed upon Long-Island.</P>
<P>Nor will less pay, according to my judgment, than I have taken the liberty of mentioning in the inclosed esti∣mate, retain such officers as we could wish to have contin∣ued. The difference per month in each battalion will amount to better than a hundred pounds. To this may be added the pay of the staff-officers; for it is presumable they will also require an augmentation: but, being few in number, the sum will not be greatly increased by them, and consequently is a matter of no great moment: but it is a matter of no small importance to make the several of∣fices
<PB N="265" REF="029737_0264_0FE249F099821338"/>
desirable. When the pay and establishment of an officer once become objects of interested attention, the sloth, negligence, and even disobedience of orders, which at this time but too generally prevail, will be purged off. But while the service is viewed with indifference,—while the officer conceives that he is rather conferring than receiving an obligation,—there will be a total relaxation of all order and discipline, and every thing will move heavily on, to the great detriment of the service, and inexpressible trouble and vexation of the general.</P>
<P>The critical situation of our affairs at this time will jus∣tify my saying that no time is to be lost in making of fruit∣less experiments. An unavailing trial of a month to get an army upon the terms proposed may render it impracti∣cable to do it at all, and prove fatal to our cause; as I am not sure whether any rubs in the way of our enlist∣ments, or unfavourable turn in our affairs, may not prove the means of the enemy recruiting men faster than we do. To this may be added the inextricable difficulty of form∣ing one corps out of another, and arranging matters with any degree of order, in the face of an enemy who are watching for advantages.</P>
<P>At Cambridge, last year, where the officers (and more than a sufficiency of them) were all upon the spot, we found it a work of such extreme difficulty to know their sentiments (each having some terms to propose) that I despaired once of getting the arrangements completed: and I do suppose, that at least a hundred alterations took place before matters were finally adjusted. What must it be then under the present regulation, where the officer is to negociate this matter with the State he comes from, distant perhaps two or three hundred miles?—some of whom, without leave or license from me, set out to make personal application, the moment the resolve got to their hands. What kind of officers these are, I leave Congress to judge.</P>
<P>If an officer of reputation (for none other should be applied to) is asked to stay, what answer can he give, but in the first place, that he does not know whether it is at his option to do so, no provision being made in the resolu∣tion of Congress, even recommendatory of this measure;
<PB N="266" REF="029737_0265_0FE24999F6888A70"/>
consequently, that it rests with the State he comes from (surrounded perhaps with a variety of applications, and influenced probably by local attachments) to determine whether he can be provided for or not? In the next place, if he is an officer of merit, and knows that the State he comes from is to furnish more battalions than it at present has in the service, he will scarcely, after two years' faith∣ful services, think of continuing in the rank he now bears, when new creations are to be made, and men appointed to offices (nowise superior in merit, and ignorant perhaps of service) over his head. A committee, sent to the army from each State, may upon the spot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix things with a de∣gree of propriety and certainty, and is the only method I can see of bringing matters to a decision with respect to the officers of the army. But what can be done in the meanwhile towards the arrangement in the country, I know not. In the one case you run the hazard of losing your officers; in the other, of encountering delay, unless some method could be devised of forwarding both at the same instant.</P>
<P>Upon the present plan, I plainly foresee an intervention of time between the old and new army, which must be fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed up with militia (if to be had) with whom no man who has any regard for his own reputation can undertake to be answerable for consequences. I shall also be mistaken in my conjectures, if we do not lose the most valuable offi∣cers in this army, under the present mode of appointing them: consequently, if we have an army at all, it will be composed of materials not only entirely raw, but (if un∣common pains are not taken) entirely unfit: and I see such a distrust and jealousy of military power, that the commander in chief has not an opportunity, even by rec∣ommendation, to give the least assurances of reward for the most essential services. In a word, such a cloud of perplexing circumstances appear before me, without one flattering hope, that I am thoroughly convinced, unless the most vigorous and decisive exertions are immediately adopted to remedy these evils, that the certain and abso∣lute loss of our liberties will be the inevitable consequence; as one unhappy stroke will throw a powerful weight into the scale against us, enabling general Howe to recruit his

Some of the most probable remedies, and such as experience has brought to my more intimate knowledge, I have taken the liberty to point out: the rest I beg leave to submit to the consideration of Congress.</P>
<P>I ask pardon for taking up so much of their time with my opinions. But I should betray that trust which they and my country have reposed in me, were I to be silent upon a matter so extremely interesting. With the most perfect esteem, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS last night honoured with your favour of the second with sundry resolutions of Congress. * * *</P>
<P>In respect to the exchange of prisoners, I fear it will be a work of great difficulty, owing to their dispersed and scattered situation throughout the States. In order to ef∣fect it, I have wrote to the eastern governments to have them collected, and to transmit me an account of their number, distinguishing the names and ranks of the field and commissioned officers, and the corps they belong to. I have also wrote to governor Livingston of the Jerseys up∣on the subject, and must take the liberty of requesting Con∣gress to give directions that a similar return may be made of those in Pennsylvania and Maryland, and for their be∣ing brought to Brunswic, that they may be ready to be exchanged for an equal number of those of the same rank.</P>
<P>I observe, by the resolve of the twenty-sixth ultimo, that the exchange in particularly directed to be made of the of∣ficers and soldiers taken on Long-Island. But should not that follow the exchange of those officers and men who have lately returned from Quebec, whose imprisonment has been much longer, and whose service has not been less severe, and, in many instances, conducted with great in∣trepidity? I have had many applications since their arrival, by which they claim a kind of preference as far as their number and the circumstances of their rank will allow,
<PB N="268" REF="029737_0267_0FE249A462103318"/>
and which I thought it my duty to mention, that I may obtain some direction upon the subject.</P>
<P>You will observe by a paragraph of a letter received yes∣terday from general Howe, a copy of which you have at▪ length, that the non-performance of the agreement between captain Forster and general Arnold, by which the latter stipulated for the return of an equal number of officers and prisoners in our hands for those delivered him, is consider∣ed in an unfavourable light, and entirely imputed to me, as having the chief command of the armies of the States, and a controlling power over general Arnold. The point∣ed manner in which Mr. Howe is pleased to express him∣self could not personally affect me, supposing there had been no good grounds for the treaty not being ratified, having been nothing more than an instrument of conveying to him the resolutions formed upon the subject. * * *</P>
<P>However, I would beg leave to observe, from the letters from the hostages,—from what has been reported by others respecting captain Forster's having used his endeavours to restrain the savages from exercising their wonted barbarities, though in some instances they did,—his purchasing some of the prisoners for a pretty considerable premium,—but, above all, from the delicate nature of such treaties, and be∣cause the non-observance of them must damp the spirits of the officers who make them, and add affliction to the mis∣fortunes of those whom necessity and the nature of the case force into captivity to give them a sanction by a long and irksome confinement,—for these reasons and many more that will readily occur, I could wish Congress to reconsid∣er the matter, and to carry it into execution.</P>
<P>I am sensible the wrong was originally in their employ∣ing savages, and that whatever cruelties were committed by them should be esteemed their own acts: yet perhaps, in point of policy, it may not be improper to overlook these infractions on their part, and to pursue that mode which will be the most likely to render the hardships in∣cident to war most tolerable, and the greatest benefits to the State.</P>
<P>I have ventured to say thus much upon the subject from a regard to the service, and because such gentlemen of the
<PB N="269" REF="029737_0268_0FE249FB660BF1C8"/>
army as I have heard mention it seem to wish the treaty had been ratified rather than disallowed.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a list of vacancies in the third regiment of Virginia troops, in part occasioned by the death of major Leitch who died of his wounds on Tuesday morning,—and of the gentlemen who stand next in regimental order, and who are recommended to succeed to them. You will observe that captain John Fitzgerald is said to be appoint∣ed to the duty of major. This I have done in order, be∣ing the oldest captain in the regiment, and, I believe, an offi∣cer of unexceptionable merit, and as it was highly necessary at this time to have the corps as well and fully officered as possible. There is also a vacancy in the first continental battalion by the promotion of lieutenant Clarke to a major∣ity in the flying camp, to which colonel Hand has recom∣mended William Patten to succeed, as you will perceive by his letter inclosed.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty to transmit a plan for establish∣ing a corps of engineers, artificers, &amp;c. sketched out by colonel Putnam, and which is proposed for the considera∣tion of Congress. How far they may incline to adopt it, or whether they may choose to proceed upon such an ex∣tensive scale, they will be pleased to determine. However, I conceive it a matter well worthy of their consideration, being convinced from experience, and from the reasons suggested by colonel Putnam who has acted with great dil∣igence and reputation in the business, that some establishment of the sort is highly necessary, and will be productive of the most beneficial consequences.</P>
<P>If the proposition is approved by Congress, I am inform∣ed by good authority that there is a gentleman in Virginia, in the colony service, John Stadler, esquire, a native of Germany, whose abilities in this way are by no means in∣considerable. I am told he was an engineer in the army under general Stanwix, and is reputed to be of skill and ingenuity in the profession. In this capacity I do not know him myself, but am intimately acquainted with him in his private character, as a man of understanding and of good behaviour. I would submit his merit to the inquiry of Congress; and if he should answer the report I have
<PB N="270" REF="029737_0269_0FE249A5E58AFA28"/>
had of him, I make no doubt but he will be suitably pro∣vided for.</P>
<P>The convention of this State have lately seized and had appraised two new ships, valued at six thousand two hun∣dred and twenty-nine pounds York currency, which they have sent down for the purpose of sinking, and obstructing the channel opposite Mount-Washington. The price being high, and the opinions various as to the necessity of the measure, some conceiving the obstruction nearly sufficient already, and others that they would render it secure, I would wish to have the direction of Congress upon the sub∣ject by the earliest opportunity, thinking myself, that, if the enemy should attempt to come up, they should be used, sooner than to hazard their passing. I must be governed by circumstances, yet hope for their sentiments before any thing is necessary to be done.</P>
<P>Sundry disputes having arisen of late between officers of different regiments and of the same rank, respecting the right of succession to such vacancies as happen from death or other causes,—some suggesting that it should be in a co∣lonial line and governed by the priority of their commissions; others, that it should be regimentally,—and there being an instance now before me, between the officers of the Vir∣ginia regiments, occasioned by the death of major Leitch; it has become absolutely necessary that Congress should determine the mode by which promotions are to be regu∣lated,—whether colonially and by priority of commissions, or regimentally, reserving a right out of the general rule they adopt, to reward for particular merit, or of withhold∣ing from office such as may not be worthy to succeed.</P>
<P>I have only proposed two modes for their consideration, being satisfied that promotions through the line (as they are called) can never take place without producing discord, jealousy, distrust, and the most fatal consequences. In some of my letters upon the subject of promotions, and one which I had the honour of addressing to the board of war on the thirtieth ultimo, I advised that the mode should be rather practised than resolved on: but I am fully con∣vinced now of the necessity there is of settling it in one of the two ways I have taken the liberty to point out, and under the restrictions I have mentioned; or the disputes
<PB N="271" REF="029737_0270_0FE249FCEA67B298"/>
and applications will be endless, and attended with great inconveniences.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour of transmitting to you a copy of a letter from the comte D'Emery, governor-gen∣eral of the French part of St. Domingo, which I received yesterday, and also my answer, which I have inclosed and left open for the consideration of Congress, wishing that it may be sealed if they approve of the sieur De Chambea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s releasement, which I think may be attended with many valuable consequences. If Congress concur in sentiment with me, they will be pleased to give direction for his passage by the first opportunity to the French islands: if they do not, I shall be obliged by your returning my letter.</P>
<P>I have also the pleasure of inclosing a copy of a letter from monsieur P. Pennel, which came to hand last night, and which contains intelligence of an agreeable and inter∣esting nature, for which I beg leave to refer you to the copy. The polite manner in which monsieur Pennel has requested to be one of my aides-de-camp demands my acknowledgments. As the appointment will not be at∣tended with any expense, and will shew a proper regard for his complaisance and the attachment he is pleased to express for the service of the American States, I shall take the liberty of complying with his requisition, and transmit him a brevet commission, provided the same shall be agree∣able to Congress. Their sentiments upon this subject you will be kind enough to favour me with by the first opportunity. The inclosed letter for the sieur De Chambeau you will please to forward to him (if he is to be enlarged) after closing it.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I must take the liberty to observe that I am under no small difficulties on account of the French gentlemen that are here in consequence of the commissions they have received,—having no means to employ them, or to afford them an opportunity of ren∣dering that service they themselves wish to give, or which
<PB N="272" REF="029737_0271_0FE249A76B2BBE18"/>
perhaps is expected by the public. Their want of our language is an objection to their being joined to any of the regiments here at this time, were there vacancies, and not other obstacles. These considerations induce me to wish that Congress would adopt and point out some par∣ticular mode to be observed respecting them. What it should be, they will be best able to determine. But to me it appears that their being here now can be attended with no valuable consequences, and that, as the power of appointing officers for the new army is vested in the con∣ventions, &amp;c. of the several States, it will be necessary for Congress to direct them to be provided for in the regiments to be raised, according to the ranks they would wish them to bear—(or I am convinced they will never be taken in, let their merit be what it may;)—or to form them into a distinct corps which may be increased in time. They seem to be genteel, sensible men; and I have no doubt of their making good officers as soon as they can learn as much of our language as to make themselves well under∣stood: but, unless Congress interfere by their particular direction to the States, they will never be incorporated in any of the regiments to be raised: and, without they are, they will be entirely at a loss, and in the most irksome situation, for something to do, as they now are.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of writing you yester∣day, I have been favoured with a letter from the honour∣able council of Massachusetts-Bay, covering one from Richard Derby, esquire, a copy of which is herewith transmitted, as it contains intelligence of an important and interesting nature.</P>
<P>As an exchange of prisoners is about to take place, I am induced, from a question stated in a letter I received from governor Trumbull this morning, to ask the opinion of Congress, in what manner the States that have had the care of them are to be reimbursed the expenses incurred on their account. My want of information in this instance,
<PB N="273" REF="029737_0272_0FE249FE6EA8CF18"/>
or whether any account is to be sent in with the prisoners, would not allow me to give him an answer, as nothing that I recollect has ever been said upon the subject. He also mentions another matter, viz. whether such privates as are mechanics, and others who may desire to remain with us, should be obliged to return. In respect to the latter, I conceive there can be no doubt of our being under a necessity of returning the whole, a proposition having been made on our part for a general exchange, and that agreed to: besides, the balance of prisoners is greatly against us; and I am informed it was particularly stipulated by gen∣eral Montgomery, that all those that were taken in Canada should be exchanged whenever a cartel was settled for the purpose.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, I should suppose the several committees having the care of them should be instructed to make the most exact returns of the whole, however wil∣ling a part should be to continue with us. At the same time I should think, it not improper to inform them of the reasons leading to the measure, and that they should be in∣vited to escape afterwards, which, in all probability, they may effect without much difficulty if they are attached to us, extending their influence to many more, and bringing them away also.</P>
<P>The situation of our affairs and the present establishment of the army requiring our most vigorous exertions to en∣gage a new one, I presume it will be necessary to furnish the pay-master-general as early as possible with money to pay the bounty, lately resolved on, to such men as will enlist. Prompt pay perhaps may have a happy effect, and induce the continuance of some who are here: but, with∣out it, I am certain that nothing can be done; nor have we time to lose in making the experiment. But then it may be asked, who is to recruit? or who can consider themselves as officers for that purpose, till the conventions of the different States have made the appointments?</P>
<P>Yesterday afternoon the exchange between lord Stirling and governor Browne was carried into execution; and his lordship is now here. He confirms the intelligence men∣tioned by captain Souther, about the transports he met, by the arrival of the Daphne man-of-war (a twenty-gun ship)
<PB N="274" REF="029737_0273_0FE249A8F8287700"/>
a few days ago, with twelve ships under her convoy, having light-horse on board. They sailed with about twenty in each, and lost about eighty in their passage, besides those in the vessel taken by captain Souther. He further adds that he had heard it acknowledged more than once, that, in the action of the sixteenth ultimo, the enemy had a hundred men killed,—about sixty Highlanders of the for∣ty-second regiment, and forty of the light-infantry. This confession coming from themselves, we may reasonably conclude, did not exaggerate the number. * * *</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 9. About eight o'clock this morning, two ships, of forty-four guns each (supposed to be the Roebuck and Phenix,) and a frigate of twenty guns, with three or four tenders, got under way from about Bloomingdale where they had been lying some time, and stood with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asy southerly breeze towards our chevaux-de-frise, which we hoped would have inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epted their passage while our batteries played upon them: but, to our surprise and mor∣tification, they ran through without the least difficulty, and without receiving any apparent damage from our forts, though they kept up a heavy fire from both sides of the river. Their destination or views cannot be known with certainty: but most probably they are sent to stop the navigation, and cut off the supplies of boards, &amp;c. which we should have received, and of which we are in great need. They are standing up, and I have dispatched an express to the convention of this State, that notice may be immediately communicated to general Clinton at the Highland fortifications, to put him on his guard in case they should have any designs against them, and that pre∣cautions may be taken to prevent the craft belonging to the river falling into their hands.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that, since my letter of the eighth and ninth instant which I had the honour of addressing you, nothing of importance has occurred, except that the ships of war which I then mentioned, in their
<PB N="275" REF="029737_0274_0FE24A06DDAF8878"/>
passage up the river, took a sloop that was at anchor off the mouth of Spitendevil, and two of our row-gallies which they out-sailed. The crews, finding that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands, ran them near the shore, and effected their own escape. From the intel∣ligence I have received, the ships are now lying at Tarry-town, without having landed any men (which seemed to be apprehended by some) or attempted any thing else. Their principal views, in all probability, are, to interrupt our navigation, and to receive such disaffected persons as incline to take part against us. The former they will ef∣fect beyond all question; and I fear that their expectations respecting the latter will be but too fully answered.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 12. The inclosed copy of a letter received last night from the convention of this State will shew you the apprehensions they are under on account of the disaf∣fected among them. I have ordered up a part of the mi∣litia from Massachusetts under general Lincoln, to pre∣vent, if possible, the consequences which they suggest may happen, and which there is reason to believe the conspira∣tors have in contemplation. I am persuaded that they are upon the eve of breaking out, and that they will leave nothing unessayed that will distress us and favour the designs of the enemy, as soon as their schemes are ripe for it.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 13. Yesterday the enemy landed at Frog's-Point, about nine miles from hence, further up the Sound. Their number we cannot ascertain, as they have not ad∣vanced from the point,—which is a kind of island,—but the water that surrounds it is fordable at low tide. I have ordered works to be thrown up at the passes from the point to the main. From the great number of sloops, schooners, and nine ships, that went up the Sound in the evening, full of men, and from the information of two deserters who came over last night, I have reason to believe that the greatest part of their army has moved upwards or is about to do it, pursuing their original plan of getting in our rear, and cutting off our communication with the country.</P>
<P>The grounds from Frog's-Point are strong and defensi∣ble, being full of stone fences, both along the road and across the adjacent fields, which will render it difficult for
<PB N="276" REF="029737_0275_0FE249B2EEF9BDD8"/>

<P>HIS excellency having gone this morning to visit our posts beyond Kingsbridge and the several passes leading from Frog's-Point and the necks adjacent, I have the honour to inform you by his command, that no interesting event has taken place since his letter by yesterday's post.</P>
<P>Every day's intelligence from the convention of this State holds forth discoveries of new plots and of new conspira∣cies. Some of the members seem to apprehend that insur∣rections are upon the eve of breaking out, and have sug∣gested the necessity of seizing and securing the passes through the Highlands, left the disaffected should do it. Their preservation being a matter of the greatest import∣ance, his excellency, notwithstanding the situation we are in with respect to troops, has detached colonel Tash with his regiment, lately from New-Hampshire, in addition to the militia mentioned in his last, with directions to receive orders from the convention, as to the station and post he is to occupy.</P>
<P>There are now in our possession several persons, inhabit∣ants of this State, who had engaged to join the enemy, and were intercepted in going to them. There are also two who confess they have been with them, and that they had actually engaged in their service; but, finding the terms (the bounty, pay, &amp;c.) not so advantageous as they ex∣pected from the information they had received, they were induced to return. As the affairs of this government are in a precarious situation, and such as, the convention them∣selves seem to think, forbid their interposition farther than taking measures to apprehend them, his excellency would wish to obtain the sentiments of Congress, and their direc∣tion upon a subject so extremely critical and delicate, and
<PB N="277" REF="029737_0276_0FE24A0973A9C8C8"/>
which, in the consideration of it, involves many important consequences.</P>
<P>Your favour of the ninth, with its several inclosures, his excellency received yesterday morning by the express, who proceeded immediately on his journey.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 17. I am directed by his excellency to ac∣quaint you that we are again obliged to change our dispo∣sition, to counteract the operations of the enemy. Declin∣ing an attack upon our front, they have drawn the main body of their army to Frog's-Point, with a design of hem∣ming us in, and drawing a line in our rear. To prevent the consequences which would but too probably follow the execution of their scheme, the general officers determined yesterday that our forces must be taken from hence, and extended towards East and West-Chester, so as to out∣flank them. General Lee, who arrived on Monday, has strongly urged the absolute necessity of the measure. It is proposed to leave a garrison at Fort-Washington, and to maintain it if possible, in order to preserve the communica∣tion with the Jerseys. They are landing their artillery and waggons upon the Point; and there are now several boats passing up the Sound, full of men.</P>

<P>I HAVE it in command from his excellency to trans∣mit you the inclosed copies of dispatches which just now came to hand, and which contain intelligence of the most interesting and important nature respecting our affairs in the northern department. His excellency would have wrote himself, but was going to our several posts, when the express arrived.</P>
<P>The enemy are pursuing with great industry their plan of penetrating the country from the Sound, and of forming a line in our rear. They are now extended from Frog's-Point to New-Rochelle, from whence it is generally con∣jectured they mean to take their route by way of the White-Plains, and from thence to draw a line to the North-river. We on our part have drawn our whole force, ex∣cept the regiments intended to garrison Fort-Washington, from the island of New-York, and have possessed ourselves of the heights, passes, and advantageous grounds, between
<PB N="279" REF="029737_0278_0FE24A0AF6D53370"/>
New-Rochelle where the van of their army now lies, and the North-river. They will in all probability attempt to effect their purpose by moving higher up. If they do, our forces will move accordingly, it being a principal object to prevent their outflanking us.</P>
<P>On Friday, one of their advanced parties, near East-Chester, fell in with part of colonel Glover's brigade, and a smart and close <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ensued, in which, I have the pleasure to inform you, our men behaved with great cool∣ness and intrepidity, and drove the enemy back to their main body.</P>

<P>I AM directed by his excellency, whose business has called him from hence, to acknowledge his receipt of your favours of the twelfth and fifteenth instant, and to inform you in answer to the first, that he will mention the case of the French gentlemen to general Lee, and obtain his opin∣ion as to the best mode of providing for them in a useful way. The horses belonging to the light dragoons who were taken, he thinks, will be very serviceable; and he will write to general Ward or one of the agents to pur∣chase them.</P>
<P>In respect to your requisition for an immediate return of ordnance stores, his excellency says it cannot possibly be complied with in the present unsettled state of the army.

In order to effect the good purposes you have in view, he would take the liberty to recommend the establishing of magazines of ammunition and other ordnance stores in prop∣er places of security, from whence supplies could be oc∣casionally drawn. As large quantities are constantly in demand in time of war, he does not conceive your provi∣sion in these instances can be too great.</P>
<P>He will direct the regimental returns in future to include arms and accoutrements, and the commissary-general to transmit monthly lists of rations. He thinks the regulation extremely proper, though he apprehends the information to be premature respecting the over-quantity suggested to have been drawn, having heard no suspicion of the sort in this army of late.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE whole of our army is now here and on the neighbouring heights, except the troops left at Mount-Wash∣ington and Kingsbridge, (about fourteen hundred at the former, and six hundred at the latter) and general Lee's division which now forms the rear, and which is on their march. Our removal, and that of the stores, have been attended with a great deal of trouble, owing to the scarcity and difficulty of procuring waggons. However, they are nearly effected, and without any loss. The general officers are now reconnoitring the several passes leading from the enemy, that the most important may be immediately secur∣ed. The situation of their army remains nearly the same as when I had the honour of addressing you on the twenty-first instant. It differs in nothing unless it is that their main body is more collected about New-Rochelle. A few of their troops are extended as far as Momarioneck.</P>
<P>On Monday night a detachment of our men, under the command of colonel Hazlet, was sent out to surprise and cut off major Rogers, if possible, with his regiment which was posted there. By some accident or other the expedi∣tion did not succeed so well as I could have wished. However, our advanced party, led on by major Greene of
<PB N="281" REF="029737_0280_0FE24A0C79293590"/>
the first Virginia regiment, fell in with their out-guard, and brought off thirty-six prisoners, sixty muskets, and some blankets. The number killed is not certainly known: but it is reported by an officer who was there, that he counted about twenty-five. Our loss, two killed, and ten or twelve wounded; among the latter, major Greene, whose recov∣ery is very doubtful.</P>
<P>On Wednesday there was also a smart skirmish between a party of colonel Hand's riflemen,—about two hundred and forty,—and nearly the same number of Hessian chas∣seurs, in which the latter were put to the route. Our men buried ten of them on the field, and took two prisoners, one badly wounded. We sustained no other loss than having one lad wounded, supposed mortally.</P>
<P>The ships of war that are in the North-river fell down, yesterday morning or the evening before, to Dobbs's ferry, to prevent our bringing stores from below by water, and the removal of those that are landed there. As soon as the waggons, employed in bringing the baggage and stores of general Lee's division, are disengaged, they will be immediately sent to assist those already there to remove them.</P>
<P>On Saturday night we had the misfortune to lose one of the new ships intended to be sunk for obstructing the chan∣nel. She parted her cables in a severe squall, when prop∣erly ballasted, and bilged as soon as she struck the shore. The other ship was sunk well; and yesterday morning two brigs, both ready, were sent down for the same pur∣pose.</P>
<P>About two o'clock this afternoon, intelligence was brought to Head-Quarters that three or four detachments of the enemy were on their march, and had advanced within about four miles of this place. It has been fully confirm∣ed since by a variety of persons who have been out to rec∣onnoitre. Their number cannot be ascertained: but it is generally conjectured that the detachments are or will be succeeded by as many columns composing their main body. Our drums have beat to arms, and the men are ordered to their several posts. Most probably some important event is upon the eve of taking place: I hope it will be victory in favour of our arms. General Lee, with his division, has not got up; but I hear he is on his march.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="029737_0281_0FE249B8BAB338C0"/>
Experiment having proved it difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the enemy from possessing the navigation of the North-river, and rendering the communication and inter∣course between the States divided by it extremely hazard∣ous and precarious by means of their ships of war, it has become a matter of important consideration how to remedy the evil, and to guard against the consequences which may result from it. I am charged by his excellency to men∣tion it to Congress as a matter that has employed much of his thought, and that seems worthy of their most serious attention. He has communicated it to several of the gen∣eral and other officers, and to many gentlemen of sense and discernment, who all agree with him, not only upon the propriety but the absolute necessity that two distinct armies should be formed,—one to act particularly in the States which lie on the east, the other in those that are on the south of the river;—the whole however to be raised on a general plan, and not to be confined to any particular place by the terms of enlistment. These matters,—the apparent difficulty and perhaps impracticability of succours being thrown across the river while the enemy can command it,—have induced his excellency to submit the measure to their consideration, not knowing how their operations may be directed, and foreseeing that innumerable evils may arise if a respectable force is not appointed to oppose their arms wheresoever they are carried.</P>

<P>THE situation of our affairs not permitting his ex∣cellency to write himself, I have it in charge to inform you, that, on yesterday morning about ten o'clock, the enemy appeared in several large columns in our front, and, from their first movements, seemed as if they meant an at∣tack there. However, halting for a little time, their main body filed off to our left, and presently began a most severe and incessant cannonade at a part of our troops who had taken post on a hill, with a view of throwing up some lines. At the same time they advanced in two divisions, and, af∣ter a smart engagement for about a quarter of an hour, obliged our men to give way.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="029737_0282_0FE24A17610E8258"/>
Our loss is not certainly known; but, from conjecture, is between four and five hundred in killed, wounded, and missing. What theirs was, we have not heard.</P>
<P>After gaining the hill, (upon which they are entrenching) and leaving a sufficient number of men and artillery to prevent our repossessing it, they proceeded to advance by our left; and, as far as I can discover, their posts or en∣campments now form nearly a semicircle. It is evident their design is to get in our rear according to their original plan. Every measure is taking to prevent them: but the removal of our baggage, &amp;c. is attended with infinite diffi∣culty and delays.</P>
<P>Our post, from its situation, is not so advantageous as could be wished, and was only intended as temporary and occasional, till the stores belonging to the army, which had been deposited here, could be removed. The enemy com∣ing on so suddenly has distressed us much. They are now close at hand, and most probably will in a little time com∣mence their second attack: we expect it every hour:—perhaps it is beginning: I have just heard the report of some cannon.

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the twenty-ninth instant, no event of importance has occurred. The enemy are throwing up some lines and redoubts in our front, with a view of cannonading as soon as they are ready; and at the same time are extending their wings far∣ther by our right and left. It is supposed that one of their objects is to advance a part of their troops, and seize on the bridge over Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on river, that the communication may be cut off with the upper country. To prevent this, a part of our force is detached, with orders to proceed with the utmost expedition, and to secure the pass, if possible.</P>
<P>We are trying to remove, to guard against their designs, but are greatly impeded by reason of the scarcity of wag∣gons in proportion to our baggage and stores. Every ex∣ertion has been employed to obtain a sufficiency; but they cannot be had in this part of the country. The quarter-master has sent to Connecticut to get a supply, if possible.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="029737_0283_0FE249BF2A222200"/>
Our army is decreasing fast.

If this was done, perhaps many who are now here might be induced to en∣gage: but at present there are none authorised to recruit.</P>
<P>His excellency would have wrote himself by the person who carries this (to the care of general Greene;) but his attention is totally engaged in ordering the affairs of the army, and the best mode for its removal.</P>

<P>I AM directed by his excellency to acknowledge his receipt of your favour of the twenty-eighth ultimo which came to hand yesterday evening, and to transmit you a copy of the letter. I had the honour of writing you by the Boston express by his command. Had the express been charged with no other letter, the loss would not have been attended with any material injury to us or advantage to the enemy, provided it should come to their hands: but there were others from his excellency, of a very interest∣ing nature, the miscarriage of which gives him much con∣cern. As the bundle was taken away in so sudden and secret a manner, I fear there is but little hope of recover∣ing it,—being done most probably for the express purpose of furnishing the enemy with intelligence, and a state of our army. Besides his excellency's letters, the most ma∣terial of which was to Mr. Rutledge, there were five or six more from the gentlemen of his family.</P>
<P>My letters of the twenty-ninth and of yesterday, which I had the honour of addressing you, will give a pretty full account of our situation, and of every matter respecting this army antecedent to this date. I only omitted to mention that we have taken thirteen of the Waldeckers, and that, for several days past, our scouting parties have brought in one, two, or three prisoners. In addition to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, we have every day a deserter or two.</P>

This in∣formation has carried his excellency and aides out. The result of their movement I have not heard: but most likely they are pursuing their original design of getting by our flanks and seizing the heights above us.

<P>P. S. His excellency has just returned, and says the alarm was premature. It arose from some of lord Stir∣ling's advanced guards seeing a body of our men who had been ordered to reinforce him, who were supposed to be the enemy. His excellency is very apprehensive that the army will be greatly distressed for want of provision, par∣ticularly in the article of flour, owing to the water conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ance, both in the North and East river, being in the enemy's possession. He has wrote to the convention of this State, and directed Mr. Trumbull, that their utmost exertions in this instance may be used. There is a good deal of flour on the Jersey side: but there is no other way to get it, but by carting and ferrying it over to Peekskill. This I have wrote to general Greene to have done, by his excel∣lency's direction.</P>

<P>BY command of his excellency, I have the honour to acknowledge his receipt of your favour of the twenty-fourth ultimo, and to inform you that he esteems the plan you propose to lay before Congress, for preventing more rations being drawn than may be due, well calculated to answer the end. That respecting the sick seems to him not entirely perfect. The captains or commanders of companies are prohibited from drawing pay for such sick as may be discharged from the hospitals as unfit for service. If, during their stay, and before it can be known whether their case will or will not admit of their return, it should become necessary to make up a regimental pay-abstract, in what manner are the officers to make up their rolls? are they to include the sick, or not?</P>
<P>As this is a case which may and must of necessity fre∣quently happen, it appears to his excellency that the intend∣ed regulations should be more general, and restrain the officers from including in their pay-abstracts or rolls all the sick they send to the hospitals, and the pay due them previ∣ous to their going. In such case, those who are discharged as unfit for service may receive their pay as intended; and those who return to duty can obtain what was due to them when the regiment was paid, by applying to the paymaster with the officer and surgeon's certificates, or be included in a subsequent abstract. The inconveniences and abuses which are designed to be remedied by these regulations, his excellency does not apprehend to arise so much from necessity (as incident to the nature of armies) as from the imperfect institution of the present, and the great mix∣ture and diversity of troops composing it, and also from the inattention of the officers. * * *</P>
<P>The defenceless state of Pennsylvania, as communicated by the committee of safety to your honourable body, is a matter of much concern to his excellency, which is not a little aggravated by the part too many seem ready to take in favour of the enemy. He trusts, however, the defec∣tion will be too inconsiderable to threaten any alarming consequences.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="029737_0286_0FE24A1AA16193F8"/>
Before the receipt of your letter, his excellency had wrote to the commanding officer of the Virginia regiments at Trenton, directing him to march them forward towards general Greene's post, and there remain under his com∣mand till further orders, unless special instructions had been or should be given to the contrary by Congress, or for their particular destination.</P>
<P>Agreeable to your request, his excellency has consulted with general Lee upon the best mode for employing the French gentlemen, and making them serviceable. The result is that they should be appointed to regiments by Congress according to the ranks they have been pleased to give them, and with the same pay as is allowed other offi∣cers in such cases. Their want of our language is rather an objection: but it is hoped they will attain a sufficient knowledge of it, ere it be long, to be of great service; and that, in the interim, their advice and assistance in di∣recting of works may be of use where they may be sta∣tioned.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you that on yester∣day morning the enemy made a sudden and unexpected movement from the several posts they had taken in our front. They broke up their whole encampments the pre∣ceding night, and have advanced towards Kingsbridge and the North-river. The design of this manoeuvre is a mat∣ter of much conjecture and speculation, and cannot be ac∣counted for with any degree of certainty. The grounds we had taken possession of were strong and advantageous, and such as they could not have gained without much loss of blood in case an attempt had been made. I had taken every possible precaution to prevent their outflanking us;—which may have led to the present measure. They may still have in view their original plan, and, by a sudden wheel, try to accomplish it. Detachments are constantly out to observe their motions, and to harass them as much as possible.</P>
<P>In consequence of this movement I called a council of general officers to-day, to consult of such measures as should
<PB N="288" REF="029737_0287_0FE249C41486AB50"/>
be adopted in case they pursued their retreat to New-York; the result of which is herewith transmitted. In respect to myself, I cannot indulge an idea that general Howe, sup∣posing he is going to New-York, means to close the cam∣paign, and to sit down without attempting something more. I think it highly probable, and almost certain, that he will make a descent with a part of his troops into Jersey: and, as soon as I am satisfied that the present manoeuvre is real and not a feint, I shall use every means in my power to forward a part of our force to counteract his designs: nor shall I be disappointed if he sends a detachment to the southward for the purpose of making a winter campaign.</P>
<P>From the information I have received, there is now a number of transports at Red-Hook, with about three thousand troops on board. Their destination, as given out, is to Rhode-Island: but this seems altogether im∣probable for various reasons; among others, the season is much against it. In the southern States they will find it milder, and much more favourable for their purposes. I shall take the liberty of mentioning that it may not be im∣proper to suggest the probability of such a measure to the assemblies and conventions in those States, that they may be on their guard,—and the propriety of their establishing and laying up magazines of provisions and other necessa∣ries in suitable places. This is a matter of exceeding im∣portance, and what cannot be too much attended to.</P>
<P>From the approaching dissolutión of the army, and the departure of the new levies which is on the eve of taking place, and the little prospect of levying a new one in time, I have wrote to the eastern States by the unanimous ad∣vice of the general officers, to forward supplies of militia in the room of those that are now here, and who, it is fear∣ed, will not be prevailed on to stay any longer than the time they are engaged for. The propriety of this appli∣cation I trust will appear, when it is known that not a single officer is yet commissioned to recruit, and when it is considered how essential it is to keep up some shew of force and shadow of an army.</P>
<P>I expect the enemy will bend their force against Fort-Washington, and invest it immediately. From some ad∣vices, it is an object that will attract their earliest attention.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="029737_0288_0FE24A1C257157A8"/>
I am happy to inform you, that, in the engagement on Monday fe'nnight, I have reason to believe our loss was by no means so considerable as was conjectured at first. By some deserters and prisoners we are told, that of the enemy was tolerably great: some accounts make it about four hundred in killed and wounded: all agree that among the former there was a colonel Carr of the thirty-fifth regi∣ment.</P>
<P>The force that will be sent to Jersey after I am satisfied of Mr. Howe's retreat, in addition to those now there, ac∣cording to my present opinion, will make it necessary for me to go with them, to put things in a proper channel, and such a way of defence as shall seem most probable to check the progress of the enemy, in case they should at∣tempt a descent there, or a move toward Philadelphia.</P>

The former was advised as the most eligible in respect to the gentlemen who were here before. It requires time to form an accurate opinion of the merits of an officer; and the present situation of the army will not allow me to pay a particular attention to monsieur Laytaniac, or such notice as he may wish to receive, or I to give: nor is there any way of making his stay here agreeable.</P>

<P>I HAVE only time to acknowledge the honour of your letter of the fifth instant, and its several inclosures, and to inform you, that, agreeable to the resolves of Con∣gress, I shall use every measure in my power that the moving and present confused state of the army will admit of, to appoint officers for recruiting.</P>
<P>You will have been advised, before this, of the arrival of commissioners from Massachusetts. Others have come from Connecticut: but, from the present appearance of things, we seem but little if any nearer to levying an army. I had anticipated the resolve respecting the militia, by writing to the eastern States and to the Jersey, by the

advice of my general officers, and from a consciousness of the necessity of getting in a number of men if possible, to keep up the appearance of an army. How my applica∣tions will succeed, the event must determine. I have little or no reason to expect that the militia now here will remain a day longer than the time they first engaged for. I have rec∣ommended their stay, and requested it in general orders. General Lincoln and the Massachusetts commissioners are using their interest with those from that State: but, as far as I can judge, we cannot rely on their staying.</P>
<P>I left White-Plains about eleven o'clock yesterday;—all peace then. The enemy appeared to be preparing for their expedition to Jersey according to every information. What their designs are, or whether their present conduct is not a feint, I cannot determine.</P>
<P>The Maryland and Virginia troops under lord Stirling have crossed the river, as have part of those from the Jer∣sey: the remainder are now embarking. The troops, judged necessary to secure the several posts through the Highlands, have also got up. I am going to examine the passes, and direct such works as may appear necessary; after which, and making the best disposition I can of things in this quarter, I intend to proceed to Jersey, which I expect to do to-morrow.</P>
<P>The assemblies of Massachusetts and Connecticut, to induce their men more readily to engage in the service, have voted an advance pay of twenty shillings per month, in addition to that allowed by Congress to privates. It may perhaps be the means of their levying the quotas ex∣acted from them sooner than they could otherwise have been raised: but I am of opinion, a more fatal and mis∣taken policy could not have entered their councils, or one more detrimental to the general cause. The influence of the vote will become continental, and materially affect the other States in making up their levies. If they could do it, I am certain, when the troops come to act together, that jealousy, impatience and mutiny would necessarily arise. A different pay cannot exist in the same army. The reasons are obvious, and experience has proved their force in the case of the eastern and southern troops last spring. Sensible of this, and of the pernicious conse∣quences
<PB N="292" REF="029737_0291_0FE249CE88615320"/>
that would inevitably result from the advance, I have prevented the commissioners from proceeding or pub∣lishing their terms till they could obtain the sense of Con∣gress upon the subject, and remonstrated against it in a let∣ter to governor Trumbull. I am not singular in opinion: I have the concurrence of all the general officers, of its fatal tendency.</P>
<P>I congratulate you and Congress upon the news from Ticonderoga, and that general Carleton and his army have been obliged to return to Canada without attempting any thing.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you of my arrival here yesterday, and that the whole of the troops belonging to the States, which lay south of Hudson's-river, and which were in New-York government, have passed over to this side, except the regiment, lately colonel Small-wood's, which I expect is now on their march.</P>
<P>That they may be ready to check any incursions the enemy may attempt in this neighbourhood, I intend to quarter them at Brunswic, Amboy, Elizabethtown, New∣ark, and about this place, unless Congress should conceive it necessary for any of them to be stationed at or more con∣tiguous to Philadelphia. In such case they will be pleas∣ed to signify their pleasure. There will be very few of them after the departure of those who were engaged for the flying camp, which is fast approaching. The disposi∣tion I have mentioned seems to me well calculated for the end proposed, and also for their accommodation.</P>
<P>The movements and designs of the enemy are not yet understood. Various are the opinions and reports on this head. From every information, the whole have removed from Dobbs's ferry towards Kingsbridge; and it seems to be generally believed on all hands, that the investing of Fort-Washington is one object they have in view: but that can employ but a small part of their force. Whether they intend a southern expedition, must be determined by
<PB N="293" REF="029737_0292_0FE24A276131B228"/>
time: to me there appears a probability of it, which seems to be favoured by the advices we have that many transports are wooding and watering. General Greene's letter would give you the substance of the intelligence brought by Mr. Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Staten-Island in this instance, which he received before it came to me.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have copies of two letters from general Howe, and of my answer to the first of them. The letter alluded to, and returned in his last, was one from myself to Mrs. Washington, of the twenty-fifth ultimo, from whence I conclude that all the letters which went by the Boston express have come to his possession. You will also perceive that general Howe has requested the return of Peter jack, a servant to major Stewart, to which I have consented, as he was not in the military line, and the re∣quisition agreeable to the custom of war. This servant having been sent to Philadelphia with the Waldockers and other prisoners, I must request the favour of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earliest opportuni∣ty, in order that he may be returned to his master.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave not only to suggest but to urge the necessity of increasing our field artillery very considerably. Experience has convinced me, as it has every gentleman of discernment in this army, that, while we remain so much inferior to the enemy in this instance, we must carry on the war under infinite disadvantages, and without the smallest probability of success. It has been peculiarly owing to the situation of the country where their operations have been conducted, and to the rough and strong grounds we possessed ourselves of, and over which they had to pass, that they have not carried their arms, by means of their artillery, to a much greater extent. When these difficulties cease by changing the scene of action to a level champaign country, the worst of consequences are to be apprehended. I would therefore, with the concurrence of all the officers whom I have spoken to upon the subject, submit to the consideration of Congress whether immediate measures ought not to be taken for procuring a respectable train.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands that each battalion should be furnished at least with two pieces, and that a smaller num∣ber
<PB N="294" REF="029737_0293_0FE249D0660F9F30"/>
than a hundred of three pounds, fifty of six pounds, and fifty of twelve pounds, should not be provided, in ad∣dition to those we now have. Besides these, if some eigh∣teen and twenty-four-pounders are ordered, the train will be more serviceable and complete. The whole should be of brass, for the most obvious reasons: they will be much more portable, not half so liable to burst: and, when they do, no damage is occasioned by it, and they may be cast over again. The sizes before described should be particu∣larly attended to: if they are not, there will be great rea∣son to expect mistakes and confusion in the charges in time of action, as it has frequently happened in the best regulated armies. The disparity between those I have mentioned and such as are of an intermediate size is diffi∣cult to discern.</P>
<P>It is also agreed that a regiment of artillerists, with ap∣proved and experienced officers, should be obtained if pos∣sible, and some engineers of known reputation and abilities. I am sorry to say, too ready an indulgence has been had to several appointments in the latter instance, and that men have been promoted, who seem to me to know but little if any thing of the business.</P>
<P>Perhaps this train, &amp;c. may be looked upon by some as large and expensive. True, it will be so: but when it is considered that the enemy, having effected but little in the course of the present campaign, will use their utmost efforts to subjugate us in the next, every consideration of that sort should be disregarded, and every possible preparation made to frustrate their * * * attempts. How they are to be procured, is to be inquired into. That we cannot provide them among ourselves, or more than a very small proportion, so trifling as not to deserve our notice, is evident. There∣fore I would advise, with all imaginable deference, that, without any abatement of our own internal exertions, ap∣plication should be immediately made to such powers as can and may be willing to supply them. They cannot be obtained too early, if soon enough: and I am told they may be easily had from France and Holland.</P>
<P>Mr. Trumbull the commissary-general has frequently mentioned to me of late the inadequacy of his pay to his trouble and the great risk he is subject to on account of the
<PB N="295" REF="029737_0294_0FE24A28E5DC71A0"/>
large sums of money which pass through his hands. He has stated his case with a view of laying it before Congress and obtaining a more adequate compensation. My sentiments upon the subject are already known: but yet I shall take the liberty to add that I think his complaint to be well founded, and his pay, considering the important duties and risks of his office, by no means sufficient, and that the foot∣ing he seems to think it should be upon, himself, appears just and reasonable.</P>
<P>A proposition having been made long since to general Howe and agreed to by him, for an exchange of prisoners in consequence of the resolutions of Congress to that effect, I shall be extremely happy if you will give directions to the committees and those having the charge of prisoners in the several States south of Jersey, to transmit me proper lists of the names of all the commissioned officers, and of their ranks and the corps they belong to; also the number of non-commissioned and privates, and their respective regi∣ments. You will perceive by his letter, he supposes me to have affected some delay, or to have been unmindful of the proposition I had made.</P>
<P>I propose to stay in this neighbourhood a few days, in which time I expect the designs of the enemy will be more disclosed, and their incursions be made in this quarter, or their investiture of Fort-Washington, if they are intended.</P>

<P>HAVING given my promise to general Howe, on his application, that Peter Jack, a servant of major Stewart, who was sent to Philadelphia with the Waldeckers and other prisoners, and who has nothing to do in the military line, should be returned to his master agreeable to the usage of war in such cases,—I must take the liberty to request the favour of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earliest opportunity, that he may be forwarded to his master in compliance with my promise.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you last, an important event has taken place, of which I wish to give you the earliest intelligence.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="029737_0296_0FE24A2A68511B20"/>
The preservation of the passage of the North-river was an object of so much consequence that I thought no pains o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expense too great for that purpose: and therefore, after sending off all the valuable stores except such as were necessary for its defence, I determined, agreeable to the ad∣vice of most of the general officers, to risk something to defend the post on the east side, called Mount-Washington.</P>
<P>When the army moved up in consequence of general Howe's landing at Frog-point, colonel Magaw was left on that command, with about twelve hundred men, and orders given to defend it to the last. Afterwards, reflect∣ing upon the smallness of the garrison, and the difficulty of their holding it if general Howe should fall down upon it with his whole force, I wrote to general Greene who had the command on the Jersey shore, directing him to govern himself by circumstances, and to retain or evacuate the post as he should think best, and revoking the absolute order to colonel Magaw to defend the post to the last ex∣tremity. General Greene, struck with the importance of the post, and the discouragement which our evacuation of posts must necessarily have given, reinforced colonel Magaw with detachments from several regiments of the flying camp, but chiefly of Pennsylvania, so as to make up the number about two thousand.</P>
<P>In this situation things were yesterday, when general Howe demanded the surrendry of the garrison, to which colonel Magaw returned a spirited refusal. Immediately upon receiving an account of this transaction, I came from Hackinsac to this place, and had partly crossed the North-river when I met general Putnam and general Greene, who were just returning from thence, and informed me that the troops were in high spirits, and would make a good defence: and it being late at night, I returned.</P>
<P>Early this morning colonel Magaw posted his troops partly in the lines thrown up by our army on our first com∣ing thither from New-York, and partly on a commanding hill lying north of Mount-Washington,—the lines being all to the southward. In this position the attack began about ten o'clock, which our troops stood, and returned the fire in such a manner as gave me great hopes the enemy was entirely repulsed. But at this time a body of troops cross∣ed
<PB N="298" REF="029737_0297_0FE249D36FA382C8"/>
Haerlem-river in boats, and landed inside of the second lines, our troops being then engaged in the first.</P>
<P>Colonel Cadwallader, who commanded in the lines, sent off a detachment to oppose them: but they, being over-powered by numbers, gave way; upon which, colonel Cad∣wallader ordered his troops to retreat in order to gain the sort It was done with much confusion; and the enemy crossing over came in upon them in such a manner, that a number of them surrendered.</P>
<P>At this time the Hessians advanced on the north side of the fort in very large bodies. They were received by the troops posted there, with proper spirit, and kept back a considerable time; but at length they were also obliged to submit to a superiority of numbers, and retire under the cannon of the fort.</P>
<P>The enemy, having advanced thus far, halted; and im∣mediately a flag went in, with a repetition of the demand of the fortress, as I suppose. At this time I sent a billet to colonel Magaw, directing him to hold out, and I would endeavour this evening to bring off the garrison, if the for∣tress could not be maintained, as I did not expect it could, the enemy being possessed of the adjacent ground. But, before this reached him, he had entered too far into a treaty to retract: after which, colonel Cadwallader told another messenger who went over, that they had been able to obtain no other terms than to surrender as prisoners of war. In this situation matters now stand. I have stopped general Beall's and general Heard's brigades, to preserve the post and stores here; which, with the other troops, I hope we shall be able to effect.</P>
<P>I do not yet know the numbers killed or wounded on either side: but, from the heaviness and continuance of the fire in some places, I imagine there must have been consid∣erable execution.</P>
<P>The loss of such a number of officers and men, many of whom have been trained with more than common at∣tention, will, I fear, be severely felt; but, when that of the arms and accoutrements is added, much more so; and must be a further incentive to procure as considerable a supply as possible for the new troops, as soon as it can be done.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not been yet able to obtain a particular account of the unhappy affair of the sixteenth, nor of the terms on which the garrison surrendered. The intelli∣gence that has come to hand is not so full and accurate as I could wish. One of the artillery, whose information is most direct, and who escaped on Sunday night, says the enemy's loss was very considerable, especially in the attack made above the fort by the division of Hessians that march∣ed from Kingsbridge, and where lieutenant-colonel Raw∣lins, of the late colonel Stephenson's regiment, was posted.</P>
<P>They burned yesterday one or two houses on the heights, and contiguous to the fort, and appeared, by advices from general Greene, to be moving in the evening their main body down towards the city. Whether they will close the campaign without attempting something more, or make an incursion into Jersey, must be determined by the events themselves.</P>
<P>As Fort-Lee was always considered as only necessary in conjunction with that on the east side of the river, to preserve the communication across, and to prevent the ene∣my from a free navigation, it has become of no importance by the loss of the other, or not so material as to employ a force for its defence. Being viewed in this light, and ap∣prehending that the stores there would be precariously situ∣ated, their removal has been determined on to Boundbrook above Brunswic, Princeton, Springfield, and Acquacke∣nunk bridge, as places that will not be subject to sudden danger in case the enemy should pass the river, and which have been thought proper as repositories for some of our stores of provision and forage.</P>
<P>The troops belonging to the flying camp under generals Heard and Beall, with what remains of general Ewing's brigade, are now at Fort-Lee, where they will continue till the stores are got away. By the time that is effected, their term of enlistment will be near expiring; and, if the enemy should make a push in this quarter, the only troops that there will be to oppose them, will be Hand's, Haz∣lett's, the regiments from Virginia, and that, lately Small∣wood's,—the latter greatly reduced by the losses it sustain∣ed
<PB N="300" REF="029737_0299_0FE24AA92B79A768"/>
on Long-Island, &amp;c. and sickness: nor are the rest by any means complete. In addition to these, I am told there are a few of the militia of this State, who have been called in by governor Livingston. I shall make such a disposition of the whole at Brunswic and at the interme∣diate posts, as shall seem most likely to guard against the designs of the enemy, and to prevent them making an ir∣ruption or foraging with detached parties.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter from colonels Miles and Atlee will shew Congress the distressed situation of our prisoners in New-York; and their distress will become greater every day by the cold inclement season that is approaching. It will be happy if some expedient can be adopted, by which they may be furnished with necessary blankets and clothing. Humanity and the good of the service require it. I think the mode suggested by these gentlemen, for establishing a credit, appears as likely to succeed, and as eligible, as any that occurs to me. It is probable many articles that may be wanted can be obtained there, and upon better terms than elsewhere. In respect to provision, their allowance perhaps is as good as the situation of general Howe's stores will admit of: it has been said of late by deserters and others that they were rather scant.</P>
<P>By a letter from the paymaster-general, of the seven∣teenth, he says there will be a necessity that large and early remittances should be made him. The demands, when the troops now in service are dismissed, will be extremely great. Besides, the bounty to recruits will require a large supply; and he adds that the commissary-general has informed him, that, between this and the last of December, he shall have occasion for a million of dollars.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 21. The unhappy affair of the sixteenth has been succeeded by further misfortunes. Yesterday morn∣ing a large body of the enemy landed between Dobbs's ferry and Fort-Lee. Their object was, evidently, to in∣close the whole of our troops and stores that lay between the North and Hackinsac rivers, which form a very nar∣row neck of land. For this purpose, they formed and marched as soon as they had ascended the high grounds towards the fort. Upon the first information of their hav∣ing landed, and of their movements, our men were order∣ed
<PB N="301" REF="029737_0300_0FE24A72665A5C00"/>
to meet them: but finding their numbers greatly supe∣rior, and that they were extending themselves to seize on the passes over the river, it was thought prudent to with∣draw our men; which was effected, and their retreat se∣cured. We lost the whole of the cannon that was at the fort (except two twelve-pounders) and a great deal of baggage, between two and three hundred tents, about a thousand barrels of flour, and other stores in the quarter-master's department. This loss was inevitable. As many of the stores had been removed as circumstances and time would admit of. The ammunition had been happily got away.</P>
<P>Our present situation between Hackinsac and Passaic rivers being exactly similar to our late one, and our force here by no means adequate to an opposition that will promise the smallest probability of success, we are taking measures to retire over the waters of the latter, when the best disposition will be formed that circumstances will ad∣mit of.</P>
<P>By colonel Cadwallader, who has been permitted by general Howe to return to his friends, I am informed the surrender of the garrison on the sixteenth was on the com∣mon terms as prisoners of war; the loss of the Hessians, about three hundred privates and twenty-seven officers kill∣ed and wounded; about forty of the British troops, and two or three officers; the loss on our side but inconsider∣able. I beg leave to refer you to him for a more particu∣lar account, and also for his relation of the distresses of our prisoners. Colonels Miles and Atlee's letter, men∣tioned above, upon this subject, was through mistake sent from hence yesterday morning. The mode of relief pro∣posed by them was a credit or supply of cash through the means of Mr. Franks. This seems to be doubtful, as he is said to be in con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inement by colonel Cadwallader,—provided it would have been otherwise practicable.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not yet heard that any provision is making to supply the place of the troops composing the flying camp, whose departure is now at hand. The situation of our affairs is truly critical, and such as requires uncommon ex∣ertions on our part. From the movements of the enemy, and the information we have received, they certainly will make a push to possess themselves of this part of the Jersey. In order that you may be fully apprised of our weakness, and of the necessity there is of our obtaining early succours, I have, by the advice of the general officers here, directed general Mifflin to wait on you. He is intimately acquaint∣ed with our circumstances, and will represent them better than my hurried state will allow.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Lee to come over with the con∣tinental regiments immediately under his command: those with general Health I have ordered to secure the passes through the Highlands. I have also wrote to governor Livingston requesting of him such aid as may be in his power; and would submit it to the consideration of Con∣gress whether application should not be made for part of the Pennsylvania militia to step forth at this pressing time.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would mention, if an early and immediate supply of money could be sent to Mr. Dalham to pay the flying camp troops, it might have a happy effect. They would subsist themselves comfortably on their return, provide many necessaries of which they are in great want; and moreover, it might be the means of inducing many, after seeing their friends, to engage again.</P>
<P>I expected, on coming here, to have met with many of the militia, but find from inquiry that there are not more than from four to five hundred at the different posts.</P>

their several inclosures. The execution of the resolves has been and will be attended to as far as in my power.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Schuyler to send down as early as possible the troops in the northern department from this and the State of Pennsylvania. The proposition for ex∣changing Mr. Franklin for general Thompson I shall submit to general Howe, as soon as circumstances will al∣low me.</P>
<P>I have nothing in particular to advise you of, respecting the enemy, more than that they are advancing this way. Part of them have passed the Passaic; and I suppose the main body that they have on this side the North-river would have done the same before now, (as they are coming on) had their progress not been retarded by the weather which has been rainy for several days past. I have scouts and detachments constantly out to harass them and watch their motions, and to gain, if possible, intelligence of their designs.</P>
<P>Colonel Miles, who has been permitted to go to Phila∣delphia for a few days by general Howe, will deliver you this, and inform you of the distresses of our prisoners, and the necessity of effecting their exchange as far as we have prisoners to give in return.</P>
<P>By a letter from the board of war on the subject of an exchange, they mention that several of the prisoners in our hands have enlisted. It is a measure, I think, that cannot be justified, though the precedent is furnished on the side of the enemy: nor do I conceive it good in point of pol∣icy.

<P>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of the twenty-sixth, and with its inclosures, by which I perceive the measures that have been adopted for forwarding a re∣inforcement of militia. Their arrival is much to be wish∣ed, the situation of our affairs being truly alarming, and
<PB N="304" REF="029737_0303_0FE24A3622B1D218"/>
such as demands the earliest aids. As general Mifflin's presence may have a happy influence on the disposition and temper of many of the associators, I shall not direct his re∣turn so long as he can be done without, and till it becomes indispensably necessary.</P>
<P>On Thursday morning I left Newark, and arrived here yesterday with the troops that were there. It was the opinion of all the generals who were with me, that a re∣treat to this place was requisite, and founded in necessity, as our force was by no means sufficient to make a stand, with the least probability of success, against an enemy much superior in number, and whose advanced guards were en∣tering the town by the time our rear got out. It was the wish of all to have remained there longer, and to have halt∣ed before we came thus far; but, upon due consideration of our strength, the circumstances attending the enlistment of a great part of our little force, and the frequent advices that the enemy were embarking or about to embark an∣other detachment for Staten-Island with a view of landing at Amboy to co-operate with this, which seemed to be confirmed by the information of some persons who came from the island, that they were collecting and impressing all the waggons they could find,—it was judged necessary to proceed till we came here, not only to prevent their bringing a force to act upon our front and rear, but also that we might be more convenient to oppose any troops they might land at South-Amboy, which many conjectur∣ed to be an object they had in view. This conjecture too had probability and some advices to support it.</P>
<P>I hoped we should have met with large and early suc∣cours by this time: but as yet no great number of the mi∣litia of this State has come in; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have I much reason to expect that any considerable aid will be derived from the counties which lie beyond this river, and in which the enemy are. Their situation will prevent it in a great measure from those parts where they are, provided the in∣clinations of the people were good. Added to this, I have no assurances that more than a very few of the troops composing the flying camp will remain after the time of their engagement is out: so far from it, I am told that some of general Ewing's brigade, who stand engaged to
<PB N="305" REF="029737_0304_0FE24A7EA29BA268"/>
the first of January, are now going away. If those go whose service expires this day, our force will be reduced to a mere handful.</P>
<P>From intelligence received this morning, one division of the enemy was advanced last night as far as Elizabeth-town, and some of their quarter-masters had proceeded about four or five miles on this side, to provide barns, &amp;c. for their accommodation. Other accounts say another division, composed of Hessians, are on the road through Springfield, and are reported to have reached that place last night.

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favours of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third instant, which, from the unsettled situation of our affairs, I have not been able to answer before. That of the eighteenth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>loses a list of stores [<HI>imported</HI>] in the Hancock-and-Adams conti∣nental ship, and carried into Dartmouth in New-England,—with a resolve of Congress to deliver the muskets, pow∣der, lead, and flints, to my order. As the other articles of the cargo will be full as useful to the army as those in∣cluded in the resolve, I would advise that directions be given to have the whole cargo removed from Dartmouth to some secure place in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, and there deposited till called for. It is by no means prop∣er
<PB N="306" REF="029737_0305_0FE24A37A5E11520"/>
that so great a quantity of military stores should be lodg∣ed with the army, especially at present, as we know not to-day where we shall be obliged to remove to-morrow: and that will in all probability be the case while the ene∣my continue with a light army on this side the North-river.</P>
<P>In answer to that part of yours of the nineteenth in which you ask my advice as to the propriety of enlisting prisoners of war, I would just observe, that, in my opinion, it is neither consistent with the rules of war, nor politic: nor can I think, that, because our enemies have committed an unjustifiable action, by enticing, and, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> instances, intimidating our men into their ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, we ought to follow their example. Before I had the honour of yours on this subject, I had determined to remonstrate to general Howe on this head. As to those few who have already enlisted, I would not have them again withdrawn and sent in, be∣cause they might be subjected to pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hment: but I would have the practice discontinued in future. If you will re∣vert to the capitulation of St. John's and Chamblee, you will find an express stipulation against the enlisting the pris∣oners taken there.</P>
<P>I remarked that the enlistment of prisoners was not a politic step:—my reason is this, that in time of danger I have always observed such persons most backward, for fear (I suppose) of falling into the hands of their former mas∣ters, from whom they expect no mercy: and this fear they are apt to communicate to their fellow-soldiers. They are also most ready to desert when any action is expected, hop∣ing, by carrying intelligence, to secure their peace.</P>
<P>I met captain Hesketh on the road; and, as the situa∣tion of his family did not admit of delay, I permitted him to go immediately to New-York, not having the least doubt but general Howe will make a return of any officer of equal rank who shall be required.</P>

<P>I YESTERDAY had the honour of writing you, and to advise you of our arrival here. I am now to in∣form
<PB N="307" REF="029737_0306_0FE24A8026867128"/>
you that the enemy are still advancing, and that their van-guard had proceeded as far as Bonem, a small town about four miles this side of Woodbridge, according to my last intelligence. As to their number, reports are various. Some say they were joined yesterday by a considerable re∣inforcement from Staten-Island. How far this fact may be true, I cannot determine: but, from every information, before, they were between six and seven thousand strong.</P>
<P>I have for some time past supposed Philadelphia to be the object of their movement, and have every reason to be∣lieve my opinion well founded,—the advices of sundry persons who have had an opportunity of mixing and con∣versing with them on the march, agreeing that such is the report. I have wrote to governor Livingston upon the subject, requesting his utmost exertions to forward on eve∣ry succour in his power. The same, I trust, will be at∣tended to in Pennsylvania. Without a sufficient number of men and arms, their progress cannot be checked:—at pres∣ent our force is totally inadequate to any attempt.</P>
<P>Several officers belonging to the enemy, who were pris∣oners, have obtained permission to return. I have not yet sent in the names of those belonging to us, that are to be exchanged for them. By a Virginia paper, I perceive that captain Morgan and lieutenant Heath who were ta∣ken prisoners at Quebec, and now on parole, are pro∣moted in the late arrangement of officers in that State,—the former to a regiment, the latter to a majority. It would be well if they were released: but, being Virginians, and not knowing that any gentlemen who were taken at the same time are so circumstanced, I have declined claiming their return without the opinion of Congress, lest I should incur the charge of partiality.</P>
<P>I have sent forward colonel Humpton to collect proper boats and craft at the ferry for transporting our troops: and it will be of infinite importance to have every other craft besides what he takes for the above purpose, secured on the west side of Delaware: otherwise they may fall into the enemy's hands and facilitate their views.</P>

<P>IN a little time after I wrote you this evening, the enemy appeared in several parties on the heights opposite Brunswic, and were advancing in a large body towards the crossing-place. We had a smart cannonade whilst we were parading our men, but without any or but little loss on either side. It being impossible to oppose them with our present force with the least prospect of success, we shall retreat to the west side of Delaware (and have advanced about eight miles) where it is hoped we shall meet a rein∣forcement sufficient to check their progress. I have sent colonel Humpton forward to collect the necessary boats for our transportation, and conceive it proper that the mi∣litia from Pennsylvania should be ordered towards Trenton, that they may be ready to join us, and act as occasion may require.</P>

<P>I ARRIVED here this morning with our troops be∣tween eight and nine o'clock, when I received the honour of your letter of the first with its inclosure.</P>
<P>When the enemy first landed on this side the North-river, I apprehended that they meant to make a push this way; and knowing that the force which I had was not sufficient to oppose them, I wrote to general Lee to cross with the several continental regiments in his division, and hoped he would have arrived before now. By some means or other he has been delayed. I suppose he has passed the river, as his letter of the twenty-sixth ultimo mentioned that he had marched a brigade the day before, and should
<PB N="309" REF="029737_0308_0FE24A81AB205050"/>
follow the next himself. The remainder of the troops I conceived necessary to guard the several passes through the Highlands; nor do I think they can be called from thence. Their number is very small, being reduced to very few by the departure of the troops who stood engaged till the thirtieth ultimo.</P>
<P>I understand there are now at Bristol several prisoners. As their exchange at this time cannot be effected with propriety, I think it will be necessary, under the present situation of affairs, to have them removed immediately to some more interior place, upon their paroles.

<P>I ARRIVED here myself yesterday morning with the main body of the army, having left lord Stirling with two brigades at Princeton and that neighbourhood, to watch the motions of the enemy, and give notice of their ap∣proach. I am informed that they had not entered Bruns∣wic yesterday morning at nine o'clock, but were on the opposite side of the Rariton.</P>
<P>Immediately on my arrival here, I ordered the removal of all the military and other stores and baggage over the Delaware: a great quantity are already got over; and as soon as the boats come up from Philadelphia, we shall load them; by which means I hope to have every thing secur∣ed this night and to-morrow, if we are not disturbed. Af∣ter being disencumbered of my baggage and stores, my fu∣ture situation will depend entirely upon circumstances.</P>
<P>I have not heard a word from general Lee since the twenty-sixth of last month; which surprises me not a little, as I have dispatched daily expresses to him, desiring to know when I might look for him. This makes me fear∣ful
<PB N="310" REF="029737_0309_0FE24A42694EDC10"/>
that my letters have not reached him. I am informed by report that general St. Clair has joined him with three or four regiments from the northward. To know the truth of this, and also when I may expect him, and with what numbers, I have this minute dispatched colonel Stew∣ard (general Gates's aide-de-camp) to meet general Lee and bring me an account.</P>
<P>I look out earnestly for the reinforcement from Phila∣delphia. I am in hopes, that, if we can draw a good head of men together, it will give spirits to the militia of this State, who have as yet afforded me little or no assistance; nor can I find they are likely to do much.</P>
<P>General Heard just informs me that a person, on whose veracity he can depend, has reported to him that on Sun∣day last he counted a hundred and seventeen sail of ships going out of the Hook. You may depend upon being ad∣vised instantly of any further movement in the enemy's army or mine.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you yesterday, I received a letter from general Lee. On the thirtieth ul∣timo he was at Peekskill, and expected to pass the river with his division two days after. From this intelligence you will readily conclude that he will not be able to afford us any aid for several days. The report of general St. Clair's having joined him with three or four regiments, I believe to be altogether premature, as he mentions nothing of it. It has arisen, as I am informed, from the return of some of the Jersey and Pennsylvania troops from Ticon∣deroga, whose time of service is expired. They have reached Pluckemin where I have wrote to have them halt∣ed and kept together, if they can be prevailed on, till further orders.</P>
<P>The inclosed is a copy of a letter which came to hand last night from major Clark, to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelligence it contains. The number of the enemy said to be embarked is supposed to be rather exag∣gerated.
<PB N="311" REF="029737_0310_0FE24A8BA6ACB220"/>
That there has been an embarkation is not to be doubted, it being confirmed through various channels. By colonel Griffin, who went from Brunswic on Sunday morning with a captain Sims, to pass him by our guards, and who was detained by lord Cornwallis till Monday evening on account of his situation, the amount of general Clinton's force, from what he could collect from the offi∣cers, was about six thousand: as to their destination, he could not obtain the least information. By him I also learn the enemy were in Brunswic, and that some of their advanced parties had proceeded two miles on this side. The heavy rain that has fallen has probably checked their progress, and may prevent their further movement for some time.</P>

<P>YOURS of the twentieth of last month was deliver∣ed to me by the brigadier La Roche de Fermoy, who is now here, but unable to render me that service, which I dare say, from his character, he would, were he better ac∣quainted with our language.</P>
<P>I yesterday received a letter from you without a date, mentioning that the prisoners from York-town were di∣rected to halt at Newtown for my orders. On hearing they were there, I sent colonel Moylan to conduct them, and the prisoners from Reading who arrived nearly at the same time, over towards Brunswic, and deliver them in.</P>
<P>I hope you have not sent captain Price, lieutenant Pea∣cock, and major Campbell, on to this place, as it is highly improper they should see and know the situation of our army here and at Princeton. They had better be sent up, under the care of some person, to Newtown or that neigh∣bourhood, and there wait the arrival of some larger party, who, I imagine, will be soon forwarded from Lancaster, and go in with them.</P>

Lieutenant Symes came over to me at Brunswic from Bethlehem without the least guard or escort; and a lieu∣tenant of the seventh regiment went through our whole army, and was at last discovered by a mere accident. He had a pass from the council of safety, and that was all. Such an irregular mode of suffering prisoners to go in alone must be put a stop to, or the enemy will be as well ac∣quainted with our situation as we are ourselves. If they are left at liberty to choose their own route, they will al∣ways take that through our army, for reasons too obvious to mention.</P>

<P>AS nothing but necessity obliged me to retire before the enemy and leave so much of the Jerseys unprotected, I conceive it my duty, and it corresponds with my incli∣nation, to make head against them so soon as there shall be the least probability of doing it with propriety. That the country might in some measure be covered. I left two brigades consisting of the five Virginia regiments and that of Delaware, containing in the whole about twelve hundred men sit for duty, under the command of lord Stirling and general Stephen, at Princeton, till the baggage and stores could cross the Delaware, or the troops under their respective commands should be forced from thence. I shall now, having removed the greatest part of the above articles, face about with such troops as are here sit for ser∣vice, and march back to Princeton, and there govern my∣self by circumstances and the movements of general Lee.
<PB N="313" REF="029737_0312_0FE24A8D2A851DD8"/>
At any event, the enemy's progress may be retarded by this means if they intend to come on, and the people's fears in some measure quieted, if they do not. Sorry I am to observe, however, that the frequent calls upon the militia of this State, the want of exertion in the principal gentlemen of the country, or a fatal supineness and insensi∣bility of danger till it is too late to prevent an evil that was not only foreseen but foretold, have been the causes of our late disgraces.</P>
<P>If the militia of this State had stepped forth in season (and timely notice they had,) we might have prevented the enemy's crossing the Hackinsac, although without some previous notice of the time and place it was impossible to have done this at the North-river. We might with equal probability of success have made a stand at Brunswic on the Rariton. But as both these rivers were fordable in a variety of places (knee-deep only,) it required many men to defend the passes; and these we had not. At Hack∣insac our force was insufficient, because a part was at Eliz∣abethtown, Amboy, and Brunswic, guarding a coast which I thought most exposed to danger; and at Brunswic, be∣cause I was disappointed in my expectation of militia, and because on the day of the enemy's approach (and probably the occasion of it) the term of the Jersey and Maryland brigades service expired; neither of which would consent to stay an hour longer.</P>
<P>These, among ten thousand other instances, might be adduced to shew the disadvantages of short enlistments, and the little dependence upon militia in times of real danger. But, as yesterday cannot be recalled, I will not dwell up∣on a subject which, no doubt, has given much uneasiness to Congress, as well as extreme pain and anxiety to myself. My first wish is that Congress may be convinced of the impropriety of relying upon the militia, and of the necessity of raising a larger standing army than what they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d. The saving in the article of stores, provisions, and in a thousand other things, by having nothing to do with mili∣tia unless in cases of extraordinary exigency, and such as could not be expected in the common course of events, would amply support a large army, which, well officered, would be daily improving, instead of continuing a destruc∣tive, expensive, and disorderly mob.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="029737_0313_0FE24A45A7B200A8"/>
I am clear in opinion, that, if forty thousand men had been kept in constant pay since the first commencement of hostilities, and the militia had been excused doing duty during that period, the continent would have saved money. When I reflect on the losses we have sustained for want of good troops, the certainty of this is placed beyond a doubt in my mind. In such case, the militia, who have been harassed and tired by repeated calls upon them (and farm∣ing and manufactures in a manner suspended,) would, upon any pressing emergency, have ▪run with alacrity to arms; whereas the cry now is, "they may be as well ru∣ined in one way as another;" and with difficulty they are obtained.</P>
<P>I mention these things to shew, that, in my opinion, if any dependence is placed in the militia another year, Con∣gress will be deceived. When danger is a little removed from them, they will not turn out at all. When it comes home to them, the well-affected, instead of flying to arms to defend themselves, are busily employed in removing their families and effects,—whilst the disaffected are concerting measures to make their submission, and spread terror and dismay all around, to induce others to follow the exam∣ple. Daily experience and abundant-proofs warrant this information.</P>
<P>I shall this day reinforce lord Stirling with about twelve hundred men, which will make his number about two thousand four hundred. To-morrow I mean to repair to Princeton myself, and shall order the Pennsylvania troops (who are not yet arrived, except part of the German bat∣talion and a company of light infantry) to the same place.</P>
<P>By my last advices, the enemy are still at Brunswic; and the account adds that general Howe was expected at Eliz∣abethtown with a reinforcement, to erect the king's stand∣ard, and demand a submission of this State. I can only give this as a report brought from the enemy's camp by some of the country people.</P>

<P>By a letter of the fourteenth ultimo from a Mr. Cald∣well, a clergyman, and a staunch friend to the cause, who has fled from Elizabethtown, and taken refuge in the mountains about ten miles from hence, I am informed that general or lord Howe was expected in that town to publish pardon and peace.

<P>COLONEL Reed would inform you of the intelli∣gence which I first met with on the road from Trenton to Princeton yesterday. Before I got to the latter, I received a second express informing me, that, as the enemy were advancing by different routes, and attempting by one to get in the rear of our troops which were there, (and whose numbers were small, and the place by no means defensible) they had judged it prudent to retreat to Trenton. The retreat was accordingly made, and since to this side of the river.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="029737_0315_0FE24A4729B11C68"/>
This information I thought it my duty to communicate as soon as possible, as there is not a moment's time to be lost in assembling such force as can be collected: and as the object of the enemy cannot now be doubted in the smallest degree. Indeed I shall be out in my conjecture (for it is only conjecture) if the late embarkation at New-York is not for Delaware river, to co-operate with the ar∣my under the immediate command of general Howe, who, I am informed from good authority, is with the British troops and his whole force upon this route.</P>
<P>I have no certain intelligence of general Lee, although I have sent frequent expresses to him, and lately a colonel Humpton to bring me some accurate accounts of his situ∣ation. I last night dispatched another gentleman to him (major Hoops) desiring he would hasten his march to the Delaware, in which I would provide boats near a place called Alexandria, for the transportation of his troops. I cannot account for the slowness of his march.</P>
<P>In the disordered and moving state of the army, I can∣not get returns: but, from the best accounts, we had be∣tween three thousand and three thousand five hundred men, before the Philadelphia militia and German battalion arriv∣ed:—they amount to about two thousand.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID myself the honour of writing to you yester∣day, and informing you that I had removed the troops to this side of the Delaware. Soon after, the enemy made their appearance, and their van entered just as our rear guard quitted. We had removed all our stores, except a few boards. From the best information, they are in two bod∣ies, one at and near Trenton, the other some miles higher up, and inclining towards Delaware; but whether with intent to cross there, or throw themselves between general Lee and me, is yet uncertain.</P>
<P>I have this morning detached lord Stirling with his brigade, to take post at the different landing-places, and prevent them from stealing a march upon us from above:
<PB N="317" REF="029737_0316_0FE24A9031A30BE8"/>
for I am informed, if they cross at Coryel's ferry or there-abouts, they are as near to Philadelphia, as we are here. From several accounts I am led to think that the enemy are bringing boats with them: if so, it will be impossible for our small force to give them any considerable opposition in the passage of the river, [<HI>as they may</HI>] make a feint at one place, and, by a sudden removal, carry their boats higher or lower before we can bring our cannon to play upon them.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, the security of Philadelphia should be our next object. From my own remembrance, but more from information, (for I never viewed the ground) I should think that a communication of lines and redoubts might soon be formed from the Delaware to Schuylkill on the north entrance of the city, the lines to begin on the Schuylkill side, about the heights of Springate∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, and run eastward to Delaware, upon the most advan∣tageous and commanding grounds. If something of this kind is not done, the enemy might, in case any misfortune should b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al us, march directly in, and take possession. We have ever found that lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light, are very formidable to them: they would at least give a check till people could recover of the fright and consternation that naturally attends the first appearance of an enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time every step should be taken to collect force, not only from Pennsylvania, but from the most neigh∣bourly States. If we can keep the enemy from entering Philadelphia, and keep the communication by water open for supplies, we may yet make a stand, if the country will come to our assistance till our new levies can be collected.</P>
<P>If the measure of fortifying the city should be adopted, some skilful person should immediately view the grounds, and begin to trace out the lines and works.

<P>P. S. <HI>Nine o'clock, A. M.</HI> I this minute received in∣formation that the enemy were repairing the bridges three or four miles below Trenton; which seems to indicate an intention of their passing lower down, and suggests to me the necessity that some attention should be had to the fort at Billingsport, lest they should possess themselves of it; the consideration of which I beg leave to submit to Congress. I have wrote to the council of safety on the subject.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER I had wrote you yesterday, I received cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> information that the enemy, after repairing Croswix's br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge, had advanced a party of about five hundred to Bordentown. By their taking this route, it confirms me in my opinion, that they have an intention to land between this and Philadelphia, as well as above, if they can pro∣cure boats for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="029737_0318_0FE24A98E0C73858"/>
I last night directed commodore Seymour to station all his galleys between Bordentown and Philadelphia, to give the earliest intelligence of any appearance of the enemy on the Jersey shore.</P>
<P>I yesterday rode up the river about eleven miles, to lord Stirling's post, where I found a prisoner of the forty-second regiment who had been just brought in. He informed me that lord Cornwallis was at Pennytown with two battalions of grenadiers, and three of light infantry, all British, the Hessian grenadiers, the forty-second Highland regiment, and two other battalions, the names of which he did not remember. He knew nothing of the reasons of their be∣ing assembled there, nor what were their future intentions. But I last night received information from my lord Stir∣ling, which had been brought in by his scouts, which in some measure accounted for their being there. They had made a forced march from Trenton on Sunday night, to Coryel's ferry, in hopes of surprising a sufficient number of boats to transport them; but, finding themselves disap∣pointed, had marched back to Pennytown, where they re∣mained yesterday. From their several attempts to seize boats, it does not look as if they had brought any with them, as I was at one time informed. I last night sent a person over to Trenton, to learn whether there was any appearance of building any: but he could not perceive any preparations for a work of that kind; so that I am in hopes, if proper care is taken to keep all the craft out of their way, they will find the crossing of Delaware a matter of considerable difficulty.</P>
<P>I received another letter from general Lee last evening: it was dated at Chatham (which I take to be near Mor∣ristown) the eighth of this month. He had then received my letter sent by major Hoops, but seemed still inclined to hang upon the enemy's rear, to which I should have no objection, had I a sufficient force to oppose them in front: but as I have not at present, nor do I see much probabil∣ity of further reinforcement, I have wrote to him in the most pressing terms, to join me with all expedition.</P>
<P>Major Sheldon, who commands the volunteer horse from Connecticut, waits upon Congress to establish some mode of pay. I can only say that the service of himself
<PB N="320" REF="029737_0319_0FE24A53994698A8"/>
and his troop has been such as merits the warmest thanks of the public, and deserves a handsome compensation for their trouble. Whatever is settled now, will serve for a precedent in future. From the experience I have had, this campaign, of the utility of horse, I am convinced there is no carrying on the war without them; and I would therefore recommend the establishment of one or more corps (in proportion to the number of foot) in addition to those already raised in Virginia. If major Sheldon would undertake the command of a regiment of horse on the continental establishment, I believe he could very soon raise them; and I can recommend him as a man of activ∣ity and spirit, from what I have seen of him.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night received the favour of Mr. Thomp∣son's letter inclosing the proceedings of Congress, of the eleventh instant. As the publication of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> resolve, is my opinion, will not lead to any good end, but, on the contrary, may be attended with some bad consequences, I shall take the liberty to decline inserting it in this day's orders. I am persuaded, if the subject is taken up and re∣considered, that Congress will concur with me in sentiment. I doubt not but there are some who have propagated the report: but what if they have? Their remaining in or leaving Philadelphia must be governed by circumstances and events. If their departure should become necessary, it will be right: on the other hand, if there should not be a necessity for it, they will remain, and their continuance will shew the report to be the production of calumny and falsehood. In a word, Sir, I conceive it a matter that may be as well disregarded; and that the removal or stay∣ing of Congress, depending entirely upon events, should not have been the subject of a resolve.</P>
<P>The intelligence we obtain respecting the movements and situation of the enemy is far from being so certain and satisfactory as I could wish, though every probable means in my power, and that I can devise, are adopted for that
<PB N="321" REF="029737_0320_0FE24A9B787B5DA8"/>
purpose. The latest I have received was from lord Stir∣ling last night. He says that two grenadiers of the In∣niskillen regiment, who were taken and brought in by some countrymen, inform that generals Howe, Corn∣wallis, Vaughan, &amp;c. with about six thousand of the flying army, were at Pennytown, waiting for pontons to come up, with which they mean to pass the river near the Blue Mounts, or at Coryel's ferry,—they believe, the latter;—that the two battalions of guards were at Brunswic, and the Hessian grenadiers, chasseurs, and a regiment or two of British troops, are at Trenton.</P>
<P>Captain Miller of colonel Hand's regiment also informs me, that a body of the enemy were marching to Burling∣ton yesterday morning. He had been sent over with a strong scouting party, and, at day-break, fell in with their advanced guards consisting of about four hundred Hessian troops, who fired upon him before they were discovered, but without any loss, and obliged him to retreat with his party and to take boat. The number of the whole he could not ascertain: but it appeared to be considerable. Captain Miller's account is partly confirmed by commodore Seymour, who reports that four or five hundred of the en∣emy had entered the town. Upon the whole, there can be no doubt but that Philadelphia is their object, and that they will pass the Delaware as soon as possible. Happy should I be if I could see the means of preventing them: at present, I confess, I do not. All military writers agree that it is a work of great difficulty, nay, impracticable, where there is any extent of coast to guard. This is the case with us; and we have to do it with a force small and inconsiderable, and much inferior to that of the enemy. Perhaps Congress have some hope and prospect of rein∣forcements: I have no intelligence of the sort, and wish to be informed on the subject. Our little handful is daily decreasing by sickness and other causes: and, without aid, without considerable succours and exertions on the part of the people, what can we reasonably look for o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expect, but an event that will be severely felt by the common cause, and that will wound the heart of every virtuous American,—the loss of Philadelphia? The subject is disagreeable: but yet it is true. I will leave it, wishing that our situa∣tion
<PB N="322" REF="029737_0321_0FE24A551D774A08"/>
may become such as to do away the apprehensions which at this time seem to fill the minds of too many, and with too much justice.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heath, dated at Peekskill, the eighth, I am advised that lieutenant-colonel Vose was then there with Greaton's, Bond's, and Porter's regiment, amounting in the whole to between five and six hundred men, who were coming this way. He adds that generals Gates and Arnold would be at Goshen that night, with S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ark's, Poor's, and Read's regiments; but for what pur∣pose he does not mention.</P>
<P>The inclosed extract of a letter which I received last night contains intelligence of an agreeable nature. I wish to hear its confirmation by the arrival of the several prizes: that with clothing and arms will be an invaluable acqui∣sition.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to be advised of the mode I am to observe in paying the officers; whether they are to be allowed to draw the pay lately established, and from what time, or how long they are to be paid under the old establishment. A pay-roll which was presented yesterday, being made up for the new, has given rise to these propositions. Upon my objecting to it, I was told that Congress or the board of war had established the precedent, by paying the sixth regiment of Virginia troops commanded by colonel Buck∣ner, agreeable to the latter, as they came through Phila∣delphia.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE apparent designs of the enemy being to avoid this ferry, and land their troops above and below us, have induced me to remove from this place the greater part of the troops, and throw them into a different disposition on the river, whereby I hope not only to be more able to im∣pede their passage, but also to avoid the danger of being inclosed in this angle of the river. And notwithstanding the extended appearances of the enemy on the other side, made, at least in part, to divert our attention from any
<PB N="323" REF="029737_0322_0FE24A9CFADCE8A0"/>
particular point as well as to harass us by fatigue, I cannot divest myself of the opinion that their principal design is to ford the river somewhere above Trenton; to which design I have had particular respect in the new arrangement, wherein I am so far happy as to have the concurrence of the general officers at this place.</P>
<P>Four brigades of the army, under generals lord Stirling, Mercer, Stephen and De Fermoy, extend from Yardley's up to Coryel's ferry, posted in such a manner as to guard every suspicious part of the river, and to afford assistance to each other in case of attack. General Ewing, with the flying camp of Pennsylvania, and a few Jersey troops under general Dickinson, are posted from Yardley's ferry down to the ferry opposite Bordentown. Colonel Cad∣wallader, with the Pennsylvania militia, occupies the ground above and below the mouth of Neshaminy river as far down as Dunk's ferry, at which place colonel Nixon is posted with the third battalion of [<HI>Pennsylvania. </HI>] A proper quantity of artillery is appointed to each brigade; and I have ordered small redoubts to be thrown up oppo∣site every place where there is a possibility of fording. I shall remove further up the river to be near the main body of my small army, with which every possible opposition shall be given to any further approach of the enemy to∣wards Philadelphia.</P>
<P>As general Armstrong has a good deal of influence in this State, and our present force is small and inconsidera∣ble, I think he cannot be better employed than to repair to the counties where his interest lies, to animate the peo∣ple, promote the recruiting service, and encourage the mi∣litia to come in. He will also be able to form a proper judgment of the places suitable for magazines of provision to be collected. I have requested him to wait upon Con∣gress on this subject: and if general Smallwood should go to Maryland on the same business, I think it would have a happy effect: he is popular and of great influence, and, I am persuaded, would contribute greatly to that State's furnishing her quota of men in a little time. He is now in Philadelphia.</P>

<P>ABOUT one o'clock to day I received a letter from general Sullivan, a copy of which you have inclosed. I will not comment on the melancholy intelligence which it contains, only adding that I sincerely regret general Lee's unhappy fate, and feel much for the loss of my country in his captivity.</P>
<P>In respect to the enemy, they have been industrious in their attempts to procure boats and small craft: but as yet their efforts have not succeeded. From the latest advices that I have of their movements by some prisoners and others, they appear to be leaving Trenton, and to be filing off towards Princeton and Allentown. What their de∣signs are, whether they mean to retreat, or only a feint, cannot be determined. I have parties out to watch their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, and to form, if possible, an accurate opinion of their plans.</P>
<P>Our force, since my last, has received no augmentation,—of course, by sickness and other causes, has diminished: but I am advised by a letter from the council of safety, which just came to hand, that colonels Burd and Gil∣breath are marching with their battalions of militia, and also that some small parties are assembling in Cumberland county. * * *</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a late letter which I had the honour of addressing you, I took the liberty to recommend that more battalions should be raised for the new army than what had been voted. Having fully considered the matter, I am more and more convinced not only of the propriety but of the necessity of the measure. That the enemy will leave noth∣ing un-essayed in the course of the next campaign to re∣duce these States to the rule of a most * * *, must be obvious to every one; and that the militia is not to be depended on, or aid expected from them but in cases of the most pressing emergency, is not to be doubted. The
<PB N="325" REF="029737_0324_0FE24A9E81968650"/>
first of these propositions is unquestionable, and fatal ex∣perience has given her sanction to the truth of the latter: indeed their lethargy of late, and backwardness to turn out at this alarming crisis, seem to justify an apprehension that nothing can bring them from their homes. For want of their assistance, a large part of Jersey has been exposed to ravage and to plunder; nor do I know that Pennsylvania would share a better fate, could general Howe effect a pas∣sage across the Delaware with a respectable force. These considerations have induced me to wish that no reliance, except such as may arise from necessity, should ever be had in them again; and to make further mention to Congress of the expediency of increasing their army. I trust the measure will meet their earliest attention.</P>
<P>Had I leisure and were it necessary, I could say much upon this head: but, as I have not, and the matter is well understood, I will not add much. By augmenting the number of your battalions, you will augment your force: the officers of each will have their interest and influence; and, upon the whole, their numbers will be much greater, though they should not be complete. Added to this, from the present confused state of Jersey, and the improper ap∣pointment of officers in many instances, I have little or no expectation that she will be able to raise all the troops ex∣acted from her, though I think it might be done, were suitable spirited gentlemen commissioned, who would exert themselves, and encourage the people, many of whom (for a failure in this instance, and who are well disposed) are making their submissions. In a word, the next will be a trying campaign: and as all that is dear and valuable may depend upon the issue of it, I would advise that nothing should be omitted, that shall seem necessary to our success. Let us have a respectable army, and such as will be com∣petent to every exigency.</P>
<P>I will also add that the critical situation of our affairs, and the dissolution of our present force, (now at hand) re∣quire that every nerve and exertion be employed for re∣cruiting the new battalions. One part of general Howe's movements at this time, I believe, is with a design to dis∣tract us and prevent this business. If the inclemency of the weather should force him into winter-quarters, he will not remain there longer than necessity shall oblige him: he
<PB N="326" REF="029737_0325_0FE24A60001D76F8"/>
will commence his operations in a short space of time; and in that time our levies must be made up, to oppose him, or I fear the most melancholy of all events must take place.</P>
<P>The inclosed extract of a letter from the commissary-general will shew his demands for money, and his plans for procuring salted provisions and a quantity of flour from the southward. The whole is submitted to the considera∣tion of Congress; and I wish the result of their opinion to be transmitted him, with such supplies of money as may be necessary for himself and the departments he mentions.</P>
<P>The clothing of the troops is a matter of infinite import∣ance, and, if it could be accomplished, would have a hap∣py effect. Their distresses are extremely great, many of them being entirely naked, and most so thinly clad as to be unfit for service. I must entreat Congress to write to the agents and contractors upon this subject, that every possible supply may be procured and forwarded with the utmost expedition. I cannot attend to the business myself, having more than I can possibly do besides.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Camp, above Trenton Falls,</HI> <DATE><HI>Dec.</HI> 20, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE waited with much impatience to know the determinations of Congress on the propositions made some time in October last for augmenting our corps of artillery and establishing a corps of engineers. The time is now come when the first cannot be delayed without the great∣est injury to the safety of these States; and therefore, un∣der the resolution of Congress bearing date the twelfth in∣stant, at the repeated instances of colonel Knox, and by the pressing advice of all the general officers now here, I have ventured to order three battalions of artillery to be immediately recruited. These are two less than colonel Knox recommends, as you will see by his plan inclosed: but then this scheme comprehends all the United States, whereas some of the States have corps already established, and these three battalions are indispensably necessary for the operations in this quarter, including the northern de∣partment.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="029737_0326_0FE24AA65B36B878"/>
The pay of our artillerists bearing no proportion with that in the English or French service,—the murmuring and dissatisfaction thereby occasioned, and the absolute impossi∣bility (as I am told) of getting them upon the old terms,—and the unavoidable necessity of obtaining them at all events,—have induced me (also by advice) to promise officers and men that their pay should be augmented twen∣ty-five per cent, or that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> engagements shall become null and void. This may appear to Congress premature and unwarrantable. But, Sir, if they view our situation in the light it strikes their officers, they will be convinced of the utility of the measure, and that the execution could not be delayed till after their meeting at Baltimore. In short, the present exigency of our affairs will not admit of delay either in council or the field: for well convinced I am, that, if the enemy go into quarters at all, it will be for a short season. But I rather think the design of gen∣eral Howe is to possess himself of Philadelphia this winter, if possible; and in truth I do not see what is to prevent him, as ten days more will put an end to the existence of our army. That one great point is to keep us as much harassed as possible, with a view to injure the recruiting service and hinder a collection of stores and other neces∣saries for the next campaign, I am as clear in, as I am of my existence. If therefore,—[<HI>when</HI>] we have to provide in this short interval, and make these great and arduous preparations,—every matter that in its nature is self-evident is to be referred to Congress at the distance of a hundred and thirty or forty miles, so much time must necessarily elapse, as to defeat the end in view.</P>
<P>It may be said that this is an application for powers that are too dangerous to be entrusted. I can only add that desperate diseases require desperate remedies; and with truth declare that I have no lust after power, but wish with as much fervency as any man upon this wide-extend∣ed continent for an opportunity of turning the sword into a ploughshare. But my feelings, as an officer and a man, have been such as to force me to say that no person ever had a greater choice of difficulties to contend with than I have. It is needless to add that short enlistments, and a mistaken dependence upon militia, have been the origin of all our misfortunes and the great accumulation of our debt.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="029737_0327_0FE24A61B13AD438"/>
We find, Sir, that the enemy are daily gathering strength from the disaffected. This strength, like a snow-ball, by rolling, will increase, unless some means can be devised to check effectually the progress of the enemy's arms. Mi∣litia may possibly do it for a little while: but in a little while also, the militia of those States which have been fre∣quently called upon will not turn out at all; or, if they do, it will be with so much reluctance and sloth, as to amount to the same thing:—instance, New Jersey!—wit∣ness, Pennsylvania!—Could any thing but the river Dela∣ware have saved Philadelphia?—Can any thing (the exi∣gency of the case indeed may justify it) be more destruc∣tive to the recruiting service, than giving ten dollars bounty for six weeks' service of the militia, who come in, you cannot tell how,—go, you cannot tell when,—and act, you cannot tell where,—consume your provisions, exhaust your stores, and leave you at last at a critical moment?</P>
<P>These, Sir, are the men I am to depend upon ten days hence: this is the basis on which your cause will and must forever depend, till you get a large standing army sufficient of itself to oppose the enemy. I therefore beg leave to give it as my humble opinion, that eighty-eight battalions are by no means equal to the opposition you are to make, and that a moment's time is not to be lost in raising a great∣er number,—not less, in my opinion and the opinion of my officers, than a hundred and ten. It may be urged that it will be found difficult enough to complete the first number. This may be true, and yet the officers of a hun∣dred and ten battalions will recruit many more men, than those of eighty-eight. In my judgment this is not a time to stand upon expense: our funds are the only object of consideration. The State of New-York have added one battalion (I wish they had made it two) to their quota. If any good officers offer to raise men upon continental pay and establishment in this quarter, I shall encourage them to do so, and regiment them when they have done it. If Congress disapprove of this proceeding, they will please to signify it, as I mean it for the best.</P>
<P>It may be thought that I am going a good deal out of the line of my duty, to adopt these measures, or to advise thus freely. A character to lose,—an estate to forfeit,—
<PB N="329" REF="029737_0328_0FE1BFA7F1194660"/>
the inestimable blessings of liberty at stake,—and a life de∣voted,—must be my excuse.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing of the light-horse from Virginia, nor the regiment from the Eastern-Shore. I wish to know what troops are to act in the different departments, and to have those from the southward (designed for this place) ordered on as fast as they shall be raised. The route should be pointed out by which they are to march; assistant-com∣missaries and quarter-masters upon the communication, to supply their wants; the first or second officer of each bat∣talion to forward them, and the other to come on, receive and form them at their place of destination. Unless this is immediately set about, the campaign, if it should be clos∣ed, will be opened in the spring before we have any men in the field.</P>
<P>Every exertion should be used to procure tents: a clothier-general should be appointed without loss of time for supplying the army with every article in that way:—he should be a man of business and abilities. A commissary of prisoners must be appointed to attend the army:—for want of an officer of this kind, the exchange of prisoners has been conducted in a most shameful and injurious man∣ner. We have had them from all quarters pushed into our camps at the most critical junctures, and without the least previous notice. We have had them travelling through the different States in all directions by certificates from committees, without any kind of control; and have had instances of some going into the enemy's camp without my privity or knowledge, after passing in the manner before mentioned. There may be other officers necessary which I do not recollect at this time, and which, when thought of, must be provided: for this, Sir, you may rely on, that the commanding officer, under the present establishment, is obliged to attend to the business of so many different de∣partments, as to render it impossible to conduct that of his own with the attention necessary;—than which, nothing can be more injurious.</P>
<P>In a former letter, I intimated my opinion of the neces∣sity of having a brigadier for every three regiments, and a major-general to every three brigades, at most. I think no time is to be lost in making the appointments, that the arrangements may be consequent. This will not only aid
<PB N="330" REF="029737_0329_0FE24A633506D828"/>
the recruiting service, but will be the readiest means of forming and disciplining the army afterwards, which, in the short time we have to do it, is of amazing consequence. I have laboured, ever since I have been in the service, to discourage all kinds of local attachments and distinctions of country, denominating the whole by the greater name of <HI>'American:'</HI> but I found it impossible to overcome preju∣dices; and, under the new establishment, I conceive it best to stir up an emulation; in order to do which, would it not be better for each State to furnish (though not to ap∣point) their own brigadiers?—This, if known to be part of the establishment, might prevent a good deal of conten∣tion and jealousy; and would, I believe, be the means of promotions going forward with more satisfaction, and quiet the higher officers.</P>
<P>Whilst I am speaking of promotions, I cannot help giv∣ing it as my opinion, that, if Congress think proper to con∣firm what I have done with respect to the corps of artille∣ry, colonel Knox (at present at the head of that depart∣ment, but who, without promotion, will resign) ought to be appointed to the command of it, with the rank and pay of brigadier. I have also to mention, that, for want of some establishment in the department of engineers agreea∣ble to the plan laid before Congress in October last, colo∣nel Putnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted, and taken a regiment in the State of Massachusetts. I know of no other man tolerably well qualified for the conducting of that business. None of the French gentlemen whom I have seen with appointments in that way appear to me to know any thing of the matter. There is one in Philadel∣phia, who, I am told, is clever: but him I have never seen.</P>
<P>I must also once more beg leave to mention to Congress the expediency of letting promotions be in a regimental line. The want of this has already driven some of the best officers that were in your army, out of the service. From repeated and strict inquiry I am convinced you can adopt no mode of promotion that will be better received, or that will give more general satisfaction. I wish therefore to have it announced.</P>
<P>The casting of cannon is a matter that ought not to be one moment delayed: and therefore I shall send colonel Knox to put this in a train, as also to have travelling car∣riages
<PB N="331" REF="029737_0330_0FE24AAAAFA2D6E8"/>
and shot provided,—elaboratories to be establish∣ed, one in Hartford<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and another in York. Magazines of provisions should also be had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. These I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the commissar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. As our great loss last year proceeded from a want of teams. I shall direct the quarter master-gen∣eral to furnish a certain number to each regiment to answer the common purposes thereof, that the army may be ena∣bled to remove from place to place differently from what we have done, or could do, this campaign. Ammunition carts, and proper carts for intrenching tools, should also be provided, and I shall direct about them accordingly. Above all, a store of small arms should be provided, or men will be of little use. The consumption and waste of these, this year, has been great:—militia, flying-camp men, &amp;c. coming in without, were obliged to be furnished, or become useless. Many of these threw their arms away: some lost them, whilst others deserted, and took them away. In a word, although I used every precaution to preserve them, the loss has been great; and this will forever be the case in such a mixed and irregular army as ours has been.</P>
<P>If no part of the troops already embarked at New-York has appeared in Virginia, their destination doubtless must be to some other quarter; and that State must, I should think, be freed from any invasion, if general Howe can be effectually opposed in this. I therefore inclose a memo∣randum given me by brigadier Stephen of Virginia, which Congress will please to adopt in the whole,—in part,—or reject,—as may be consistent with their plans and intelli∣gence.</P>
<P>The division of the army, late under the command of general Lee, now general Sullivan, is just upon the point of joining us. A strange kind of fatality has attended it. They had orders on the seventeenth of November to join, now more than a month. General Gates, with four east∣ern regiments, is also near at hand: three others from those States were coming on, by his order, by the way of Peekskill, and had joined general Heath whom I had or∣dered on with Parsons's brigade, to join me, leaving Clin∣ton's brigade and some militia (that were at Forts Mont∣gomery and Constitution) to guard those important passes of the Highlands. But the convention of the State of
<PB N="332" REF="029737_0331_0FE24A64B9640C10"/>
New-York seeming to be much alarmed at Heath's coming away,—a fleet appearing off New-London,—and some part of the enemy's troops retiring towards Brunswic,—induc∣ed me to countermand the order for the march of Parsons's brigade, and to direct the three regiments from Ticonderoga to halt at Morristown in Jersey (where I understand about eight hundred militia had collected,) in order to inspirit the inhabitants, and, as far as possible, cover that part of the country. I shall send general Maxwell this day to take the command of them, and, if to be done, to harass and annoy the enemy in their quarters, and cut off their convoys.</P>
<P>The care and vigilance, which were used in securing the boats on this river, have hitherto baffled every attempt of the enemy to cross: but, from concurring reports and appearances, they are waiting for ice to afford them a passage.</P>
<P>Since writing the foregoing I have received a letter from governor Cooke of Rhode-Island, of which the inclosed is a copy. Previous to this, and immediately upon the first intelligence obtained of a fleet's going through the Sound, I dispatched orders to generals Spencer and Arnold to proceed without the least delay to the eastward. The first, I presume, is gone: the latter, not getting my letter till he came to a place called Easton, was, by advice of general Gates who also met my letter at the same place, induced to come on hither before he proceeded to the eastward. Most of our brigadiers are laid up: not one has come on with the division under general Sullivan, but they are left sick at different places on the road.</P>
<P>By accounts from the eastward, a large body of men had assembled in Rhode-Island from the States of Massa∣chusetts and Connecticut. I presume (but I have no ad∣vice of it) that the militia, ordered from the first to ren∣dezvous at Danbury (six thousand in number) under the command of major general Lincoln, for supplying the place of the disbanded men of that State in the continental army, will now be ordered to Rhode-Island.</P>
<P>In speaking of general Lincoln, I should not do him justice, were I not to add that he is a gentleman well wor∣thy of notice in the military line. He commanded the militia from Massachusetts last summer, or fall rather, and much to my satisfaction,—having proved himself on all
<PB N="333" REF="029737_0332_0FE24AAC31AB39A8"/>
occasions an active, spirited, sensible man. I do not know whether it is his wish to remain in the military line, or whether, if he should, any thing under the rank he now holds in the State he comes from would satisfy him. How far an appointment of this kind might offend the continen∣tal brigadiers, I cannot undertake to say: many there are, over whom he ought not to be placed; but I know of no way to discriminate. Brigadier Reed of New-Hampshire does not, I presume, mean to continue in service: he ought not,—as I am told, by the severity of the small-pox, he is become both blind and deaf.</P>

<P>P. S. Generals Gates and Sullivan have this instant come in. By them I learn that few or no men are recruited out of the regiments coming on with them, and that there is very little reason to expect that these regiments will be prevailed upon to continue after their term of ser∣vice expires. If militia then do not come in, the conse∣quences are but too evident.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I should dwell upon the subject of our dis∣tresses, cannot be more disagreeable to Congress than it is painful to myself. The alarming situation to which our affairs are reduced impels me to the measure. Inquiry and investigation,—which in most cases serve to develop and point out a remedy, in ours, present more and greater difficulties. Till of late, I was led to hope from report that no inconsiderable part of the troops composing the regiments that were with general Lee, and those from Ti∣conderoga under general Gates, had enlisted again. This intelligence, I confess, gave me reason to expect that I should have, at the expiration of the present year, a force somewhat more respectable than what I find will be the case.</P>
<P>Having examined into the state of those regiments, I am authorised to say from the information of their officers, that but very few of the men have enlisted. Those who have are of the troops from Ticonderoga, and were permitted to visit their friends and homes, as part of the terms on which they would re-engage. In respect to those who marched
<PB N="334" REF="029737_0333_0FE24A6CC7DC2178"/>
with general Lee, I cannot learn that any have. Their refusal, I am told, has not proceeded more from an aversion to the service, or any fixed determination not to engage again, than from their wishes to return home,—the non-appointment of officers in some instances,—the turning out of good, and appointing of bad,—and in others, the incom∣plete or rather no arrangement of them,—a work unhappi∣ly committed to the management of their States: nor have I the most distant prospect of retaining them a moment longer than the last of this instant, notwithstanding the most pressing solicitations and the obvious necessity for it.</P>
<P>By the departure of these regiments I shall be left with five from Virginia, Smallwood's from Maryland, a small part of Rawlins's, Hand's from Pennsylvania, a part of Ward's from Connecticut, and the German battalion, amounting in the whole at this time from fourteen to fif∣teen hundred effective men. This handful, and such mili∣tia as may choose to join me, will then compose our army.</P>
<P>When I reflect upon these things they fill me with much concern, knowing that general Howe has a number of troops cantoned in the towns bordering on and near the Del∣aware,—his intentions being to pass, as soon as the ice is suf∣ficiently formed, to invade Pennsylvania and to possess him∣self of Philadelphia if possible. To guard against his de∣signs and the execution of them, shall employ my every exertion: but how is this to be done? As yet but few militia have gone to Philadelphia, and they are to be our support at this alarming crisis. Had I entertained a doubt of general Howe's intentions to pass the Delaware on the dissolution of our army, and as soon as the ice is made, it would now be done away. An intercepted letter from a gentleman of Philadelphia (who has joined the enemy) to his friend and partner in the city declares that to be their design,—that the army would be there in ten or twenty days from the sixteenth instant, the time of his writing, if the ice should be made;—advises him by no means to re∣move their stores,—that they would be safe.</P>
<P>The obstacles which have arisen to the raising of the new army, from the mode of appointing the officers, in∣duce me to hope, if Congress resolve on an additional num∣ber of battalions to those already voted, that they will de∣vise some other rule by which the officers, especially the
<PB N="335" REF="029737_0334_0FE24AB4DE892F38"/>
field-officers, should be appointed. In case an augmentation should be made to the eastern regiments, a deviation from the former m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de will operate more strongly as to them than to other battalions, because there have been many more officers in service from those States, than the regi∣ments voted to be raised would admit of; by which means several deserving men could not have been provided for, had the utmost pains been used for the purpose; and many others of merit have been neglected in the late appoint∣ments, and those of little worth and less experience put in their places or promoted over their heads. This has been the case with many of the best officers.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter from the paymaster-general will shew the state of the military chest, and the necessity of a large and immediate supply of cash. The advances to the officers, for bounty and the recruiting service, are great: besides, the regiments, at the expiration of this month, will require pay of their claims. * * *</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE your obliging favours of the twenty-first and twenty-third. The blankets are come to hand; but I would not have any of the other goods sent on till you hear again from me.</P>
<P>I agree with you that it is in vain to ruminate upon, or even reflect upon the authors or causes of, our present mis∣fortunes: we should rather exert ourselves, and look for∣ward with hopes that some lucky chance may yet turn up in our favour. Bad as our prospects are, I should not have the least doubt of success in the end, did not the late treach∣ery and defection of those, who stood foremost in the op∣position
<PB N="336" REF="029737_0335_0FE24A6F5FFDF4E8"/>
while fortune smiled upon us, make me fearful that many more will follow their example, who, by using their influence with some and working upon the fears of others, may extend the circle so as to take in whole towns, coun∣ties, nay, provinces. Of this we have a recent instance in Jersey; and I wish many parts of Pennsylvania may not be ready to receive the yoke.</P>
<P>The security of the continental ships of war in Delaware is certainly a capital object; and yet to draught the many hands, necessary to fit them out, from the militia, might be dangerous just now: perhaps in a little time hence their places may be supplied with country militia; and then, if the exigency of affairs requires it, they certainly ought to be spared. I will just hint to you a proposition that was made, or rather talked of, a few days ago by the officers of two New-England regiments whose time of service will expire on the first of January. They are most of them water men: and they said their men would willingly go on board the frigates, and navigate them round to any of the ports in New-England, if it was thought they would be safer there than in Delaware. You may think of this, and let me hear from you on the subject, if the proposition pleases you.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Boger of the navy is already gone in, and I have made a demand of lieutenant Josiah in exchange; but I have not heard whether lord Howe accedes to it. I will procure the release of doctor Hodge as soon as it can be done without injuring others by giving him the prefer∣ence, as I have always made it a rule to demand those first who have been longest in captivity. I will take the same steps in regard to Mr. Jones, commander of the sloop taken by the Andrew Doria.</P>
<P>I shall take the earliest opportunity of sending in your letter to general Lee, with the bill drawn upon major Small.</P>
<P>From an intercepted letter from a person in the secrets of the enemy, I find their intentions are to cross Delaware as soon as the ice is sufficiently strong. I mention this, that you may take the necessary steps for the security of such public and private property as ought not to fall into their hands should they make themselves masters of Phil∣adelphia, of which they do not seem to entertain the least doubt.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the pleasure of congratulating you upon the success of an enterprise which I had formed against a detachment of the enemy lying in Trenton, and which was executed yesterday morning.</P>
<P>The evening of the twenty-fifth I ordered the troops in∣tended for this service to parade back of M<SUP>c</SUP>Konkey's fer∣ry, that they might begin to pass as soon as it grew dark, imagining we should be able to throw them all over, with the necessary artillery, by twelve o'clock, and that we might easily arrive at Trenton by five in the morning, the distance being about nine miles. But the quantity of ice, made that night, impeded the passage of the boats so much, that it was three o'clock before the artillery could all be got over; and near four, before the troops took up their line of march.</P>
<P>This made me despair of surprising the town, as I well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke. But as I was certain there was no making a retreat with∣out being discovered, and harassed on re-passing the river, I determined to push on at all events. I formed my de∣tachment into two divisions, one to march by the lower or river road, the other by the upper or Pennington road. As the divisions had nearly the same distance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately upon forcing the out-guards, to push directly into the town, that they might charge the enemy before they had time to form.</P>
<P>The upper division arrived at the enemy's advanced post exactly at eight o'clock; and in three minutes after, I found, from the fire on the lower road, that that division had also got up. The out-guards made but small opposi∣tion, though, for their numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a constant retreating fire from behind houses.
<PB N="338" REF="029737_0337_0FE24A70E2DDCFD0"/>
We presently saw their main body formed: but, from their motions, they seemed undetermined how to act.</P>
<P>Being hard pressed by our troops, who had already got possession of their artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right, leading to Princeton. But, perceiving their intention, I threw a body of troops in their way; which immediately checked them. Finding from our dis∣position, that they were surrounded, and that they must inevitably be cut to pieces if they made any further resist∣ance, they agreed to lay down their arms. The number that submitted in this manner was twenty-three officers and eight hundred and eighty-six men. Colonel Rahl the commanding officer, and seven others, were found wound∣ed in the town. I do not exactly know how many they had killed; but I fancy not above twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular stand. Our loss is very trifling indeed,—only two officers and one or two privates wounded.</P>
<P>I find that the detachment of the enemy consisted of the three Hessian regiments of Lanspach, Kniphausen, and Rahl, amounting to about fifteen hundred men, and a troop of British light horse: but, immediately upon the begin∣ning of the attack, all those who were not killed or taken pushed directly down the road towards Bordentown. These would likewise have fallen into our hands, could my plan have been completely carried into execution. Gen∣eral Ewing was to have crossed before day at Trenton fer∣ry, and taken possession of the bridge leading out of town: but the quantity of ice was so great, that, though he did every thing in his power to effect it, he could not get over. This difficulty also hindered general Cadwallader from crossing with the Pennsylvania militia from Bristol. He got part of his foot over: but finding it impossible to em∣bark his artillery, he was obliged to desist.</P>
<P>I am fully confident, that, could the troops under gen∣erals Ewing and Cadwallader have passed the river, I should have been able with their assistance to have driven the ene∣my from all their posts below Trenton. But the numbers I had with me being inferior to theirs below me, and a strong battalion of light infantry being at Princeton above me, I thought it most prudent to return the same evening
<PB N="339" REF="029737_0338_0FE24AB905347948"/>
with the prisoners and the artillery we had taken. We found no stores of any consequence in the town.</P>
<P>In justice to the officers and men, I must add that their behaviour upon this occasion reflects the highest honour upon them. The difficulty of passing the river in a very severe night, and their march through a violent storm of snow and hail, did not in the least abate their ardour: but, when they came to the charge, each seemed to vie with the other in pressing forward: and were I to give a prefer∣ence to any particular corps, I should do great injustice to the others.</P>
<P>Colonel Baylor, my first aide-de-camp, will have the honour of delivering this to you; and from him you may be made acquainted with many other particulars. His spirited behaviour upon every occasion requires me to rec∣ommend him to your particular notice.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM just setting out to attempt a second passage over the Delaware with the troops that were with me on the morning of the twenty-sixth. I am determined to ef∣fect it if possible; but know that it will be attended with much fatigue and difficulty on account of the ice, which will neither allow us to cross on foot, nor give us an easy passage with boats. General Cadwallader crossed from Bristol on the twenty-seventh, and, by his letter of yester∣day, was at Bordentown with about eighteen hundred men. In addition to these, general Mifflin sent over five hundred from Philadelphia on Friday, three hundred yesterday evening from Burlington, and will follow to-day with seven or eight hundred more. I have taken every precaution in my power for subsisting the troops, and shall, without loss of time, and as soon as circumstances will admit of it, pur∣sue the enemy in their retreat,—try to beat up more of their quarters,—and, in a word, in every instance, adopt such measures as the exigency of our affairs requires, and our situation will justify.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="029737_0339_0FE24ABA887F23F0"/>
Had it not been for the unhappy failure of generals Ew∣ing and Cadwallader in their attempts to pass on the night of the twenty-fifth,—and if the several concerted attacks could have been made,—I have no doubt but that our views would have succeeded to our warmest expectations. What was done occasioned the enemy to leave their several posts on the Delaware with great precipitation. The peculiar distresses to which the troops who were with me were re∣duced by the severities of cold, rain, snow, and storm,—the charge of the prisoners they had taken,—and another reason that might be mentioned,—and the little prospect of receiving succours on account of the season and situa∣tion of the river,—would not authorize a further pursuit at that time.</P>
<P>Since transmitting the list of prisoners, a few more have been discovered and taken in Trenton,—among them a lieutenant-colonel, and a deputy-adjutant-general,—the whole amounting to about a thousand.</P>
<P>I have been honoured with your letter of the twenty-third and its several inclosures, to which I shall pay due attention. A flag goes in this morning with a letter to general Howe, and another to general Lee. For the lat∣ter, Robert Morris, esquire, has transmitted a bill of ex∣change, drawn by two British officers, for a hundred and sixteen pounds nine shillings and three pence, on major Small, for money furnished them in South-Carolina, which I trust will be paid. This supply is exclusive of the sum you have resolved to be sent him, and which Mr. Morris will procure in time.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Trenton,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 1, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR resolves of the twenty-seventh ultimo were trans∣mitted me last night by messieurs Clymer, Morris, and Walton. The confidence which Congress have honoured me with by these proceedings has a claim to my warmest acknowledgments. At the same time I beg leave to assure them, that all my faculties shall be employed to direct prop∣erly the powers they have been pleased to vest me with, and to advance those objects, and only those, which gave rise to this honourable mark of distinction. If my exer∣tions should not be attended with the desired success, I trust the failure will be imputed to the true cause,—the peculiarly distressed situation of our affairs, and the difficul∣ties I have to combat,—rather than to a want of zeal for my country, and the closest attention to her interests, to promote which has ever been my study.</P>
<P>On Monday morning I passed the Delaware myself; the whole of our troops and artillery not till yesterday, owing to the ice which rendered their passage extremely difficult and fatiguing. Since their arrival, we have been parading the regiments whose time of service is now expired, in or∣der to know what force we should have to depend on, and how to regulate our views accordingly. After much per∣suasion and the exertions of their officers, half or a greater proportion of those from the eastward have consented to
<PB N="4" REF="029737_0342_0FE24AC59C3CDDD8"/>
stay six weeks on a bounty of ten dollars. I feel the in∣convenience of this advance, and I know the consequences which will result from it:—but what could be done?—Pennsylvania had allowed the same to her militia:—the troops felt their importance, and would have their price. Indeed, as their aid is so essential, and not to be dispensed with, it is to be wondered they had not estimated it at a higher rate. I perceive that Congress, apprehensive of this event, had made unlimited provision for it.</P>
<P>General Mifflin is at Bordentown with about eighteen hundred men, and general Cadwallader at Croswix's, with about the same number. We are now making our arrange∣ments, and concerting a plan of operations, which I shall attempt to execute as soon as possible, and which I hope will be attended with some success.</P>
<P>As to the number and situation of the enemy, I cannot obtain certain intelligence: but, from the accounts most to be relied on, they have collected the principal part of their force, from Brunswic and the neighbouring posts, at Princeton, where they are throwing up some works. The number there is reported to be from five to six thousand; and it is confidently said they have sent the chief part of their baggage to Brunswic. It is added that general Howe landed at Amboy a day or two ago with a thousand light troops, and is on his march from thence.</P>
<P>I have sent into different parts of Jersey, men of influ∣ence to spirit up the militia, and flatter myself that the many injuries they have received will induce some to give their aid. If what they have suffered does not rouse their resentment, they must not possess the common feelings of humanity. To oppression, ravage, and a deprivation of property, they have had the more mortifying circumstance of insult added:—after being stripped of all they had with∣out the least compensation, protections have been granted them for the free enjoyment of their effects.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you, that, since the date of my last from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my command to this place. The difficulty of cross∣ing the Delaware on account of the ice made our passage over it tedious, and gave the enemy an opportunity of draw∣ing in their several cantonments, and assembling their whole force at Princeton. Their large picquets, advanced to∣wards Trenton,—their great preparations, and some intel∣ligence I had received,—added to their knowledge that the first of January brought on a dissolution of the best part of our army,—gave me the strongest reasons to conclude that an attack upon us was meditating.</P>
<P>Our situation was most critical, and our force small. To remove immediately was again destroying every dawn of hope which had begun to revive in the breasts of the Jersey militia; and to bring those troops which had first crossed the Delaware and were lying at Croswix's under general Cadwallader, and those under general Mifflin at Bordentown, (amounting in the whole to about three thou∣sand six hundred) to Trenton, was to bring them to an exposed place. One or the other however was unavoida∣ble: the latter was preferred, and they were ordered to join us at Trenton, which they did, by a night-march on the first instant.</P>
<P>On the second, according to my expectation, the enemy began to advance upon us; and, after some skirmishing, the head of their column reached Trenton about four o'clock, whilst their rear was as far back as Maidenhead. They attempted to pass Sanpink creek which runs through Tren∣ton, at different places; but, finding the fords guarded, halted, and kindled their fires. We were drawn up on the other side of the creek. In this situation we remain∣ed till dark, cannonading the enemy, and receiving the fire of their field pieces, which did us but little damage.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029737_0344_0FE24AC71E25A6C0"/>
Having by this time discovered that the enemy were greatly superior in number, and that their design was to surround us, I ordered all our baggage to be removed silent∣ly to Burlington soon after dark; and at twelve o'clock, after renewing our fires, and leaving guards at the bridge in Trenton, and other passes on the same stream above, marched by a round-about road to Princeton, where I knew they could not have much force left, and might have stores. One thing I was certain of, that it would avoid the ap∣pearance of a retreat, (which was of course,—or to run the hazard of the whole army being cut off) whilst we might by a fortunate stroke withdraw general Howe from Tren∣ton, and give some reputation to our arms. Happily we succeeded. We found Princeton about sun-rise with only three regiments, and three troops of light-horse in it, two of which were on their march to Trenton. These three regiments, especially the two first, made a gallant resistance, and, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, must have lost five hundred men: upwards of one hundred of them were left dead in the field; and, with what I have with me and what were taken in the pursuit and carried across the Del∣aware, there are near three hundred prisoners, fourteen of whom are officers, all British.</P>
<P>This piece of good fortune is counterbalanced by the loss of the brave and worthy general Mercer, colonels Haz∣let and Potter, captain Neal of the artillery, captain Flem∣ing who commanded the first Virginia regiment, and four or five other valuable officers, who, with about twenty-five or thirty privates, were slain in the field. Our whole loss cannot be ascertained, as many who were in pursuit of the enemy (who were chased three or four miles) are not yet come in.</P>
<P>The rear of the enemy's army lying at Maidenhead (not more than five or six miles from Princeton) was up with us before our pursuit was over: but as I had the precaution to destroy the bridge over Stoney-brook, (about half a mile from the field of action) they were so long retarded there as to give us time to move off in good order for this place. We took two brass field-pieces; but, for want of horses, could not bring them away. We also took some blankets, shoes, and a few other trifling articles, burned the
<PB N="7" REF="029737_0345_0FE24B1AC14A71C0"/>
hay, and destroyed such other things as the shortness of the time would admit of.</P>
<P>My original plan, when I set out from Trenton, was, to have pushed on to Brunswic: but the harassed state of our troops, (many of them having had no rest for two nights and a day) and the danger of losing the advantage we had gained by aiming at too much, induced me, by the advice of my officers, to relinquish the attempt: but, in my judg∣ment, six or eight hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esh troops upon a forced march would have destroyed all their stores and magazines,—taken (as we have since learned) their military chest, containing seventy thousand pounds,—and put an end to the war. The enemy, from the best intelligence I have been able to get, were so much alarmed at the apprehension of this, that they marched immediately to Brunswic without halting, except at the bridges, (for I also took up those on Millstone, on the dffierent routes to Brunswic) and got there before day.</P>
<P>From the best information I have received, general Howe has left no men either at Trenton or Princeton. The truth of this I am endeavouring to ascertain, that I may regulate my movements accordingly.</P>
<P>The militia are taking spirits, and, I am told, are coming in fast from this State: but I fear those from Philadelphia will scarcely submit to the hardships of a winter campaign much longer, especially as they very unluckily sent their blankets with their baggage to Burlington. I must do them the justice however to add, that they have undergone more fatigue and hardship, than I expected militia (especially cit∣izens) would have done at this inclement season. I am just moving to Morristown, where I shall endeavour to put them under the best cover I can:—hitherto we have been with∣out any; and many of our poor soldiers quite barefoot, and ill clad in other respects.</P>

<P>I AM happy to inform you that the account of gen∣eral Mercer's death, transmitted in my last, was premature, though it was mentioned as certain by many who saw him
<PB N="8" REF="029737_0346_0FE24AC9B4582580"/>
after he was wounded. By intelligence from Princeton yes∣terday evening, he was alive, and seemed as if he would do well:—unhappily he is a prisoner. Had it not been for the information I had of his death, I would have tried to have brought him away, though I believe it could not have been effected.</P>
<P>The enemy have totally evacuated Trent and Prince towns, and are now at Brunswic and the several posts on the communication between that and Hudson's river, but chiefly at Brunswic. Their numbers and movements are variously reported: but all agree that their force is great. There have been two or three little skirmishes between their parties and some detachments of militia, in which the latter have been successful, and made a few prisoners. The most considerable was on Sunday morning near Springfield, when eight or ten Waldeckers were killed and wounded, and the remainder of the party (thirty-nine or forty) made prisoners, with two officers, by a force not superior in number, and without receiving the least damage.</P>
<P>The severity of the season has made our troops, especially the militia, extremely impatient, and has reduced the num∣ber very considerably. Every day more or less leave us. Their complaints, and the great fatigues they had undergone, induced me to come to this place, as the best calculated of any in this quarter to accommodate and refresh them. The situation is by no means favourable to our views; and, as soon as the purposes are answered for which we came, I think to remove, though I confess I do not know how we shall procure covering for our men elsewhere.</P>

<P>I AM honoured with yours of the sixth, inclosing sev∣eral resolves of Congress respecting an exchange to be pro∣posed between general Lee and the Hessian field-officers taken at Trenton. Colonel Ralle died the day after the action; and we left one of the majors so ill of his wounds, that I am in doubt of his recovery. I can however make a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offer of all that remain, in exchange for general Lee, except one whom you order to be proposed for colonel Allen. If the offer is rejected by general Howe, I shall think myself then at liberty to remonstrate to him on his treatment of general Lee. If he will not exchange him, he should at least admit him to his parole, as we have ever done their prisoners who have fallen into our hands.</P>
<P>I understand from undoubted authority that they intend to try the general by a court-martial, as a deserter from their service, pretending that his resignation was never accepted of. But I shall inform general Howe, that, if any such step is taken under so shallow and illegal a pretext, and their sentence should extend either to affect his life or liberty, they may depend upon the most severe and adequate retali∣ation upon our part.</P>
<P>The enemy have made no move since my last. By every account, they begin to be distressed, particularly for forage, of which there is little or none remaining in the small circle they possess, except salt hay.</P>
<P>By letters from general Heath, of the ninth, he was be∣ginning
<PB N="10" REF="029737_0348_0FE24AD28630AFB0"/>
to move down towards Kingsbridge with the troops from New-England. This must add to the distress of the enemy, who will, by this measure, be deprived of the sub∣sistence they formerly drew from West-Chester and the coun∣ties to the northward of York-island.</P>

<P>I EMBRACE this opportunity, by Mr. Hopkins, of informing you that the enemy remain upon their old ground at Amboy and Brunswic.

<P>General Warner, with two regiments from Massachusetts, is arrived here: general Heath, with the remainder of the troops from that State, has by this time begun to move down towards Kingsbridge.</P>

<P>I HAVE not had the honour of any of your favours since I wrote to you on the fourteenth instant.—No material alterations have happened in this quarter. The enemy, from every account, mean to make Brunswic their advanc∣ed post for this winter. They are endeavouring to draw in all the forage they can get; in the course of which, they have daily skirmishes with our advanced parties: but I think, do what they will, they must be distressed greatly before the winter is over.</P>
<P>By a late resolve of Congress, the towns of Carlisle in Pennsylvania, and Brookfield in Massachusetts, are fixed upon for the proper places to erect elaboratories, and lay
<PB N="11" REF="029737_0349_0FE24B1DCA99D630"/>
up magazines of military stores. Upon communicating this resolve to general Knox, who will have the principal direction of these matters, he was of opinion that Hartford in Connecticut would be on many accounts more conve∣nient for that purpose than Brookfield, particularly in re∣spect to buildings, which are already erected, and, though not such as are immediately fit for the uses they are intend∣ed, may be easily converted to them.—General Knox, and others whom I have consulted upon the occasion, also think that Yorktown will be full as safe, and more convenient than Carlisle.—If these two alterations should, upon a re∣consideration, appear to you in the same light, and no steps should have been taken towards carrying matters into exe∣cution, I should be glad that you would, by a new resolve, permit me to direct the works to be carried on at the places last mentioned.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fluctuating state of an army composed chiefly of militia bids fair to reduce us to the situation in which we were some little time ago,—that is, of scarce having any ar∣my at all,—except reinforcements speedily arrive. One of the battalions from the city of Philadelphia goes home to∣day,—and the other two only remain a few days longer upon courtesy. The time for which a country brigade un∣der general Mifflin came out is expired, and they stay from day to day by dint of solicitation,—their numbers much reduced by desertions. We have about eight hundred of the eastern continental troops remaining of twelve or four∣teen hundred who at first agreed to stay,—part engaged to the last of this month, and part to the middle of next. The five Virginia regiments are reduced to a handful of men, as are colonel Hand's, Smallwood's, and the German battalion. A few days ago general Warner arrived with
<PB N="12" REF="029737_0350_0FE24AD45CCAC9E0"/>
about seven hundred Massachusetts militia engaged to the fifteenth of March.</P>
<P>Thus you have a sketch of our present army, with which we are obliged to keep up appearances before an enemy already double to us in numbers, and who from every ac∣count are withdrawing their troops from Rhode-Island, to form a junction of their whole army, and make another at∣tempt either to break up ours, or penetrate towards Phila∣delphia,—a thing by no means difficult now, as the ice af∣fords an easy passage over the Delaware.</P>
<P>I do not yet know what effect general Heath's moving down towards New-York will have. Yesterday morning a considerable firing was heard, which seemed to be about Kingsbridge. I am in hopes that his appearance on that quarter with a pretty large force will oblige them to with∣draw part of theirs from Jersey, to secure the city of New-York, which, by late accounts, is weakly garrisoned. Gen∣eral Heath has all the eastern and York militia with him, except the small brigade under general Warner that I men∣tioned before, one regiment of Connecticut, stopped at Providence in Rhode-Island, and a number (how many I do not know) requested by general Schuyler to be sent to Ticonderoga.—If it should appear that they are regardless of the diversion made by general Heath, and persist in their plan of drawing their whole army together in Jersey, I must order him over with all his troops, except as many as are necessary to garrison the forts and guard the passes in the Highlands.</P>
<P>I have ordered away every officer that could be spared, some to recruit, and some to collect the scattered men of the different regiments, who are dispersed almost over the con∣tinent: for, of the vast numbers sent to the hospitals at different times, few ever returned after they got well.</P>
<P>As militia must be our dependence till we can get the new army raised and properly arranged, I must entreat you to continue your endeavours with the States of Pennsylva∣nia, Maryland and Virginia to turn out every man they possibly can, and for some longer time than they generally have stipulated for. If they agree for a month or any lim∣ited time, it should commence from the time they actually join the army, and not from the time they leave their
<PB N="13" REF="029737_0351_0FE24B27CEBFFC58"/>
homes: otherwise the marching backwards and forwards consumes the term of engagement.</P>
<P>I think these demands of aid should be made as quietly as the nature of the case will admit of, especially at this time when we are deceiving our enemies with false opinions of our numbers: for, to boast of our superiority in that respect on one hand, and to call publickly on the people for assist∣ance on the other, is an impropriety too glaring:—indeed it has been already noticed in some publications that I have seen from New-York.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM favoured with yours of the fifteenth instant, with the sundry resolves inclosed in it. If that respecting the continental currency is carried strictly into execution, it cannot fail of fully re-establishing its credit.</P>
<P>I have no objection to the three gentlemen who are recommended for field-officers in the New-Hampshire regi∣ment; they seem fully entitled to it, as they have raised the regiment. I will furnish them with commissions from the date of their appointment, when applied to for that purpose.</P>
<P>There is something particular in the application of colonel Dubois and his officers for the sum of five hundred and thirteen dollars and two thirds. They were to have been commissioned provided they could raise the men; but, from their own pay-abstract, it appears that fourteen officers only brought twenty-five men into the field. As they certainly did not comply with their agreement, I would, after stating the matter as it really was, submit it to Congress who have the disposal of the public money.</P>
<P>I have perused the petition of monsieur Faneuil and other French gentlemen. If they could raise such a regiment as they propose, it would certainly be useful: but I have no conception that there are Canadians enough to be found even for a regiment of the common number, much less of two thousand three hundred and forty-seven, which is the number proposed. I know, neither colonel Livingston nor colonel Hazen could ever complete their Canadian regi∣ments
<PB N="14" REF="029737_0352_0FE24AD5E054EAA0"/>
when they had the country open to them. As I would give encouragement to foreigners of real merit, I would put the thing upon this footing:—if monsieur Faneuil can procure a sufficient number of officers to fill a regiment of the common size, and they can give any assur∣ances of being able to raise the men, I would grant them commissions.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to remark here, that, except we can throw the many foreigners who have commissions in our army into a corps together, they will be entirely useless, as they can neither converse with officers nor men in any other kind of regiment.</P>
<P>I am so well assured that you would not recommend doctor Potts to succeed doctor Stringer in the northern de∣partment except you had sufficient proof of his abilities in the medical line, that I readily concur with you in the ap∣pointment.</P>
<P>I have received a piece of information which I am afraid is true,—and that is, that the British cruisers have taken a French vessel, with a large parcel of cannon and mortars on board. I know such a one was expected, and therefore more readily credit the account.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last to you was on the twentieth instant. Since that, I have the pleasure to inform you that general Dick∣inson, with about four hundred militia, has defeated a for∣aging party of the enemy of an equal number, and has taken forty waggons, and upwards of a hundred horses, most of them of the English draft breed, and a number of sheep and cattle which they had collected. The enemy retreated with so much precipitation, that general Dickinson had on∣ly an opportunity of making nine prisoners. They were observed to carry off a good many dead and wounded in light waggons.—This action happened near Somerset court∣house on Millstone river. General Dickinson's behaviour reflects the highest honour upon him: for, though his troops were all raw, he led them through the river middle-deep,
<PB N="15" REF="029737_0353_0FE24B2995E88158"/>
and gave the enemy so severe a charge, that, although supported by three field-pieces, they gave way and left their convoy.</P>
<P>I have not heard from general Heath since the siring near Kingsbridge last Saturday; which I cannot account for, un∣less the North-river should have been rendered impassable by the ice. But the account of his having surprised and taken Fort-Independence on Friday night last comes so well au∣thenticated by different ways, that I cannot doubt it. It is said that he took four hundred prisoners in that fort, and that he invested Fort-Washington on Saturday, which oc∣casioned the siring. This is brought out by three of our officers who made their escape from New-York on Sunday, and is confirmed by a spy who went into Amboy, who says an express had arrived at Amboy from New-York, with an account of the loss of Fort-Independence, and calling for a reinforcement to protect the city; in conse∣quence of which, a number of troops had gone over. I have sent in spies to Brunswic and Amboy to know the truth of this: and if it appears that they have weakened themselves to reinforce New-York, I shall probably make some attempt upon them, if we have men enough left to do it.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to know what stock of small-arms you at present have, and what are your expectations shortly. The necessity that we have been and are now under, of calling in and arming the militia, scatters our armory all over the world, in a manner: their officers are so irregular that they generally suffer their men to carry home every thing that is put into their hands, which is forever lost to the public. The new-raised regiments will call for a great number of arms; and I do not at present see how they are to be supplied.</P>
<P>I would again beg leave to recall the attention of Congress to the appointment of general officers. I will not suppose the nomination of them is postponed upon a saving principle, because the advantage in having proper officers to examine the pay-rolls of their several regiments, and compare them with the returns of their brigades,—to see that the regiments are provided with what is proper, and that no more than a sufficiency is allowed,—to keep officers to their duty, and not, while the spirited officer is encountering all the fatigues
<PB N="16" REF="029737_0354_0FE24AD764627BD0"/>
and hardships of a rigorous campaign, suffer a number of others, under various frivolous pretences and imaginary sick∣nesses, to enjoy themselves at the public expense at their own firesides;—I say, if the appointments are withheld upon par∣simonious principles, the Congress are mistaken: for I am convinced, that, by the correction of many abuses which it is impossible for me to attend to, the public will be benefited in a great degree in the article of expense. But this is not all. We have a very little time to do a very great work in. The arranging, providing for, and disciplining a hundred and odd battalions is not to be accomplished in a day; nor is it to be done at all with any degree of propriety, when we have once entered upon the active part of the campaign. These duties must be branched out, or they will be neglected, and the public injured. Besides, were the brigadiers appointed, they might be facilitating the recruiting service; they would have time to get a little acquainted with their brigades, the wants of them, and ease me of the great weight and burden which I at present feel.</P>
<P>On whom the choice will or ought to light, I cannot un∣dertake to say. In a former letter I took the liberty of submitting to the consideration of Congress the propriety of appointing, out of each State, brigadiers to command the troops of that State,—thinking, as a distinction is now fix∣ed, a spirit of emulation might arise by this means. At any rate, I shall take the liberty of recommending general Cad∣wallader as one of the first for the new appointments. I have found him a man of ability, a good disciplinarian, firm in his principles, and of intrepid bravery. I shall also beg leave to recommend colonel Reed to the command of the horse, as a person, in my opinion, every way qualified: for he is extremely active and enterprising; many signal proofs of which he has given this campaign. For the rest, the members of Congress can judge better than I can: I can only say, that, as the army will probably be divided in the course of the next campaign, there ought, in my opinion, to be three lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals, and twen∣ty seven brigadiers:—in other words, there ought, at least, to be a brigadier to every four regiments, and a major-gen∣eral to every three brigades. The lieutenant-generals will, I presume, be appointed out of the oldest major-generals, and
<PB N="17" REF="029737_0355_0FE24B2B1A59CDC8"/>
the major-generals from the oldest brigadiers. Nine briga∣diers will then be to nominate.</P>
<P>I forgot before this to inform Congress, that, including the regiment of light dragoons from Virginia, and colonel Shel∣don's to be raised in Connecticut, I have only commission∣ed officers for four regiments. I was willing to try how these could be equipped before I put more officers into commission. It is apprehended we shall find difficulty in providing neces∣saries or even horses for these four regiments: if we should not, I shall immediately set about the residue. Colonel Baylor, colonel Moylan, (who, as volunteer, has remained constantly with the army since his discontinuance in the quarter-master's department) and colonel Sheldon, com∣mand the three new regiments of light dragoons.</P>
<P>The treasury has been for some time empty, and the army has laboured under the greatest inconvenience for want of money. The recruiting service is particularly injured by this, as many officers are now waiting only for bounty-money. I have also complaints from the eastward, of the want of money to carry on their recruiting service. If we are not supplied with that necessary article, all matters must be at a stand. I must therefore beg, that, if Mr. Palfrey has not been already supplied with a large sum, it may be done with the utmost expedition, and that you will endeav∣our to keep up the supply by constantly sending on smaller parcels.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS last night honoured with yours of the eigh∣teenth instant, inclosing a letter from the State of New-York to Congress. From the particular situation of their State in regard to their being totally deprived of commerce, they cer∣tainly must stand in need of the assistance of the other States to provide them with clothing and every thing necessary for the equipment of their forces; and it ever was my intention
<PB N="18" REF="029737_0356_0FE24AE0AA87F080"/>
to allow them a full proportion of the clothing purchased to the eastward, whenever it came to hand. Little or none of it has yet reached this army, though in the greatest want, and exposed to the severities of a winter campaign.</P>
<P>The convention have in one instance already provided for themselves out of the public stock, by stopping and making use of twenty-six bales of clothing coming on from the east∣ward to the army here. As this was done without consult∣ing me, I took the liberty of desiring them not to do the like in future; not that I meant to deprive them of their share, but because it disappointed me of many articles which I stood in immediate want of, and had not provided from other quarters. But you may be assured, that, whenever returns are made of the whole stock of clothing, they shall have their proportion, and more than that,—allowance for their peculiar situation.</P>
<P>I am amazed to hear complaints of the hospital on the east side of Hudson's-river. Doctor Morgan, with most of his mates, has been constantly there since I left it with the main body of the army. It is in vain however to look back upon past misfortunes. I will not pretend to point out the causes; but I know matters have been strangely conducted in the medical line. I hope your new appointment, when it is made, will make the necessary reform in the hospital, and that I shall not, the next campaign, have my ears, and eyes too, shocked with the complaints and looks of poor creatures perishing for want of proper care, either in the regimental or hospital surgeons.</P>
<P>I agree with the convention in the expediency of ob∣structing the passage of the North-river in some place be∣tween the mouth and the Highlands. We have found that our labour and expense has been thrown away in endeavour∣ing to do it below, where the channel is amazingly wide and deep; but, from the slight view I have had of the river above, I think the passage may be easily obstructed, and de∣fended by proper fortifications, as the river is so narrow that no vessel going up could possibly escape the fire. I am no judge of what can be done towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting out the frigates at Poughkeepsie:—that must be left to the gentlemen of the marine committee.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="029737_0357_0FE24B2C9CA17F90"/>
The hint given by the convention of New-York, of the necessity and utility of a commissary of forage, had struck me before, and had been mentioned by general Mif∣flin, whose department of quarter-master-general must be eased of part of the load which is at present thrown upon it. He is obliged in many instances to act entirely out of his proper line; and, instead of being confined to the duty of quarter-master-general, is also waggon-master, and forage-master-general.—I have wrote to two persons that I think qualified to fill the office of waggon-master; and I hope one of them will accept.—That of commissary of forage shall be attended to.</P>
<P>The want of accurate maps of the country which has hitherto been the scene of war, has been of great disadvan∣tage to me. I have in vain endeavoured to procure them, and have been obliged to make shift with such sketches as I could trace out from my own observation and that of gen∣tlemen around me. I really think, if gentlemen of known character and probity could be employed in making maps (from actual survey) of the roads,—the rivers, and bridges and fords over them,—the mountains, and passes through them—it would be of the greatest advantage.</P>
<P>I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote to gene∣ral Howe, and proposed the fixing an agent for prisoners at New-York. I have not received an answer: but if he ac∣cedes to the proposal, I shall appoint Mr. Lewis Pintard.</P>
<P>I am sorry that I am obliged to contradict the report of the taking of Fort-Independence as mentioned in my last. I believe the evacuation of some detached redoubts gave rise to the report.—I have not heard from general Heath since the fourteenth instant, which I am amazed at. I am quite in the dark as to his numbers, and what progress he has made.</P>
<P>On the twenty-third, a party of four hundred of our men, under colonel * * *, fell in with two regiments of the enemy, convoying a number of waggons from Brunswic to Amboy. Our advanced party under colonel Parker en∣gaged them with great bravery upwards of twenty minutes, during which time the colonel-commandant was killed, and the second in command mortally wounded. The people living near the field of action say their killed and wounded
<PB N="20" REF="029737_0358_0FE24AE250BFB070"/>
were considerable. We lost only two men, who were made prisoners. Had colonel * * * come up with the main body, colonel Parker and the other officers think we should have put them to the rout, as their confusion was very great, and their ground disadvantageous. I have ordered * * * under arrest, and shall bring him to trial to answer for so extraordinary a piece of conduct.</P>
<P>Reinforcements come up so extremely slow, that I am afraid I shall be left without any men before they arrive: The enemy must be ignorant of our numbers, or they have not horses to move their artillery, or they would not suffer us to remain undisturbed. I have repeatedly wrote to all the recruiting officers, to forward on their men as fast as they could arm and clothe them; but they are so extremely averse to turning out of comfortable quarters, that I cannot get a man to come near me, though I hear from all parts that the recruiting service goes on with great success. It would be well if the board of war, in whose department it is, would issue orders for all officers to equip and forward their re∣cruits to Head-Quarters with the greatest expedition.</P>
<P>By a resolve of Congress passed some time ago, general Schuyler is directed to apply to me for ninety-four tons of powder—a quantity which it is impossible I should have by me, and for which I do not know where to direct him to apply. I could wish that returns were made to me of the quantity of powder on hand, and where it is to be found, that I may not be at a loss at any time of emergency.</P>
<P>Since the resignation of colonel Reed, the important of∣fice of adjutant-general has been left unfilled, (I mean as to a principal) and I am much at a loss how or where to find a person in every way capable and proper to execute the of∣fice. My inclinations lead me to confer the appointment upon a major Morris: but ample testimonials should be pro∣duced, and full proof of fidelity ought to be made, before an office of so high trust should be conferred upon a person in a manner a stranger to me. I only know major Morris from a short personal acquaintance, and from report: he never even brought a letter of recommendation to me. From his conversation, and from the accounts I have received from others, he is a man of considerable military abilities; and, from his behaviour in two instances, he is a man of
<PB N="21" REF="029737_0359_0FE24B36767ECE40"/>
bravery and conduct. His story is simply this—that he left the British service in disgust upon not receiving a promotion to which he was justly entitled. Perhaps some gentlemen of Congress may know more about him, or may be able to make such inquiries as might satisfy them as to the safety and propriety of appointing him. I have no other motive for wishing him a preference than that I think him the prop∣erest person that has come under my notice, provided all matters before mentioned were cleared up. I shall wait the result of a determination of Congress before I proceed fur∣ther in this appointment: and I wish to be favoured with their advice as speedily as possible; for the remains of the old army is much disarranged for want of a good adjutant-general, and the formation of the new in a great measure depends upon an able officer in that line.</P>

<P>I HAVE none of your favours unanswered at present. There is such a demand upon me from all quarters for money, which I am unable to answer, that I cannot help again pressing you to send on a supply. The recruiting ser∣vice is almost at a stop here for want of money; and gov∣ernor Trumbull writes me word that it is totally so in Con∣necticut. He adds that their loan officers cannot proceed in their business for want of proper check-books and notes; but that, if they were furnished with them, they could soon take in a sufficient quantity to answer their purposes.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to be informed whether I have a right to draw warrants upon the loan-officers in the different States. The State of Connecticut advanced colonel Sheldon, at my request, ten thousand pounds lawful, to raise his regi∣ment of horse. For their reimbursement they desired me to give them a draught upon the loan-office: but, not know∣ing whether I had a right to draw upon that fund, I deferred it till I heard from you.</P>
<P>I must beg you to write to the assemblies of the different States, and insist upon their passing a law to inflict a severe and heavy penalty upon those who harbour deserters, know∣ing
<PB N="22" REF="029737_0360_0FE24AE3D286E798"/>
them to be such. Our army is shamefully reduced by desertion; and, except the people in the country can be forced to give information when deserters return to their old neighbourhoods, we shall be obliged to detach one half of the army to bring back the other.</P>
<P>I have a letter from general Heath, of the twenty-fourth instant. He was at and near Kingsbridge with his army. I do not find that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is likely to do more than to draw the attention of the enemy that way, and to cut them off from forage, of which they are in great wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with yours of the twenty-fourth of January, with sundry resolves of Congress, and a peti∣tion of monsieur Pellisier's inclosed. I am not the proper <HI>[person]</HI> to refer the petition to, as I am no judge of his merit as an engineer, having never had an opportunity of seeing any of his performances. At any rate I do not see the necessity of appointing him or any other person principal engineer at Ticonderoga: for that would exclude any other, though of superior abilities, from being sent there. Besides, as a corps of engineers will in all probability be soon estab∣lished, monsieur Pellisier's rank can then be settled with more propriety.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention in any of my former letters that I had appointed captain Nathaniel Guest, of Virginia, to the command of a regiment to be raised upon the frontiers of Virginia and Carolina; and I have directed him, if possible, to bring a company or two of Cherokee Indians. If they can be procured, they will answer two valuable purposes—one, as excellent scouts—the other, that they will be in fact hostages, and will secure the good behaviour of their nation.</P>
<P>Major Bland, commandant of the Virginia horse, has de∣sired to know whether there is not a necessity of giving a bounty and re-enlisting his regiment as continental troops. They were enlisted to serve in the colony; and the men
<PB N="23" REF="029737_0361_0FE24B37FABB2030"/>
were with some difficulty prevailed upon to march hither: but the major thinks they would be entirely reconciled upon receiving the bounty.</P>
<P>I received a letter from Mr. Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, desiring I would ap∣point proper persons to make inquiry into and take deposi∣tions concerning the behaviour of the British and foreign troops in Jersey. This would be an endless task, as their line of march is marked with devastation, and is a thing of such public notoriety that it demands no further proof.</P>
<P>I remonstrated with general Howe upon the treatment of our wounded at Princeton. You will see by the inclosed letter from him, that he disavows and detests the proceed∣ing: but I fear that too much encouragement is given to such barbarous behaviour by the British officers; for, in a late skirmish in which Sir William Erskine commanded, lieutenant Kelly of the fifth Virginia regiment was flightly wounded in the thigh; but, before he could get off the field, he was overtaken and murdered in a most cruel manner. General Stephen informed me that he would write to Sir William, and inform him, that, unless such practices were put a stop to, our soldiers would not be restrained from making retaliation.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heath, of the thirteenth of last month, I find that he had decamped from the neighbour∣hood of Kingsbridge, and removed back towards the White-Plains. His reasons for doing so were, that the troops could not stand the inclemency of the weather, and that he feared the troops expected from Rhode-Island would land upon his back. I have however directed him to leave a body of light troops under an active officer, in order to harass their foraging parties, and to cover our own who are to remove as much of the forage from West-Chester county as they can; and, after leaving as many men as will secure the passes in the Highlands, the remainder are to be sent over here to join me; for I am apprehensive that the enemy are reinforc∣ing themselves at Brunswic.</P>
<P>I shall to-morrow send out parties from every quarter, to remove all the waggons, horses, cattle and sheep, or as many as possible, from the neighbourhood of the enemy's lines. They are to attend particularly to the horses: for if we can reduce those that they at present have, and can hinder them
<PB N="24" REF="029737_0362_0FE24AE5558B2AD0"/>
from getting fresh ones from the adjacent country, it will be impossible for them to move their artillery and waggons forward, should they incline to make another push towards Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I observe by your last resolves that the militia of Balti∣more, Harford and Cecil counties in Maryland, are order∣ed out and to march this way. Let me entreat you to suf∣fer none to go forward to Philadelphia but what are equip∣ped with arms, accoutrements and blankets: they hurt the service much by taking those things only for a short time from the continental troops, many of whom would other∣wise be enabled to take the field.</P>
<P>The secretary of the board of war has transmitted me ex∣tracts of general Schuyler's letters, in which he calls press∣ingly for some general officers to be sent to his assistance. This will shew you the necessity of immediately making the promotions recommended in mine of the twenty-second of January; for at present I cannot spare a general officer from this quarter without injuring the service.</P>
<P>Nothing of consequence has happened since I wrote to you last, except a skirmish on the first of this month, five or six miles from Brunswic-landing, between our advanced par∣ties (about seven hundred in the whole) and upwards of two thousand of the enemy, under Sir William Erskine. The heat of the engagement was <HI>[borne by]</HI> colonel Scott of the fifth Virginia regiment, who, with about a hundred men, beat back two hundred of the British grenadiers. Sev∣eral other officers behaved with great spirit; but there is some reason to suspect that colonel * * *, who command∣ed our main body, did not behave altogether as he ought. I have ordered a court upon him, that the matter may be fairly canvassed, and that he may stand condemned or ac∣quitted by the evidence of those who were present.</P>
<P>Colonel * * *, who was under arrest upon a charge of cowardice, broke his parole and went over to Bucks-county, I suppose with an intent to make his escape: but I dispatched a troop of light horse after him, who brought him back yes∣terday; and he is to take his trial on Friday.</P>
<P>The small-pox has made such head in every quarter, that I find it impossible to keep it from spreading through the whole army in the natural way. I have therefore deter∣mined,
<PB N="25" REF="029737_0363_0FE24B3984E8B6C0"/>
not only to inoculate all the troops now here that have not had it, but shall order doctor Shippen to inoculate the recruits as fast as they come in to Philadelphia. They will lose no time, because they will go through the disorder while their clothing, arms and accoutrements are getting ready.</P>
<P>From the first institution of civil government, it has been the national policy of every precedent State to endeavour to engage its members to the discharge of their public duty by the obligation of some oath: its force and happy influence has been felt in too many instances, to need any arguments to support the policy or prove its utility. I have often thought the States have been too negligent in this particular, and am more fully convinced of it from the effect general Howe's excursion has produced in New-Jersey. An oath is the only substitute that can be adopted to supply the defect of princi∣ple. By our inattention in this article, we lose a consider∣able cement to our own force, and give the enemy an oppor∣tunity to make the first tender of the oath of allegiance to the king. Its baneful influence is but too severely felt at this time. The people generally confess they were compelled to take protection, and subscribe the <HI>Declaration:</HI> yet it fur∣nishes many with arguments to refuse taking any active part▪ and further they allege themselves bound to a neutrality at least. Many conscientious people who were well-wishers to the cause, had they been bound to the States by an oath, would have suffered any punishment rather than have taken the oath of allegiance to the king; and are now lost to our interest for want of this necessary tie. Notwithstanding the obligation of the <HI>Association,</HI> they do not conceive it to have the same effect as an oath. The more united the inhabit∣ants appear, the greater difficulty general Howe will have in reconciling them to regal government, and consequently the less hope of conquering them. For these reasons and many more that might be urged, I should strongly recom∣mend every State to fix upon some oath or affirmation of allegiance to be tendered to all the inhabitants without ex∣ception, and to outlaw those that refuse it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday waited upon by two French gen∣tlemen, monsieur Romand de Lisle, and Robillard. The first produced a commission signed by you in November last, appointing him a major of artillery: but, by the inclosed let∣ter from him to me, he claims much higher rank under the promise of Congress—that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommandant of the continen∣tal artillery. Whether any such promise was made, I leave you to determine.</P>
<P>Robillard claims a captaincy of artillery: but, upon what he grounds his pretensions, I do not know. I never saw him but once before; and that was upon his way from Bos∣ton to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive what a weight these kind of people are upon the service, and upon me in particular. Few of them have any knowledge of the branches which they pro∣fess to understand; and those that have are entirely useless as officers, from their ignorance of the English language. I wish it were possible to make them understand, when com∣missions are granted to them, that they are to make them∣selves masters of the English language in some degree before they can be attached to any particular corps.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the fifth instant, no event of an important and interesting nature has occurred, unless the successes of our parties in foraging and bringing off several horses, waggons, and some fat cattle and sheep, which were contiguous to and around the enemy's lines, are considered as such. I then mentioned that I had such a scheme in contemplation, which was happily accom∣plished the next day without any loss. The enemy in turn have made frequent efforts in that way, but with little suc∣cess. Whenever they made the attempt, it never failed to produce a skirmish. They have been common of late, but with little damage to either side.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="029737_0365_0FE24B3B0824BB68"/>
We have certain intelligence that they have drawn the greatest part of their troops from Rhode-Island, and are told that part of them have landed on Staten-Island and at Am∣boy, with a view of augmenting their force at Brunswic.</P>
<P>Colonel * * *, agreeable to the information contained in my last, has been tried by a court-martial, and cashiered. The proceedings and sentence I directed to be transmitted to the secretary of the war-office, and to the printers of this State and Virginia, to be published.</P>
<P>General Lincoln is just arrived with a regiment of Mas∣sachusetts militia, about two hundred and fifty. This, he says, is succeeded by three more, which will make in the whole near eighteen hundred: but in this I think he must be mistaken, unless those on the march are much fuller and larger than what they usually are. The whole are of the troops that were with general Heath.</P>
<P>General Knox, by a letter of the first instant, informs me, that, on mature inquiry and examination, he finds Spring∣field to be more convenient and much better calculated for an elaboratory and cannon-foundery, than any other part of the New-England States. He adds that a quantity of copper, tin, and other useful materials, can be had there; and that the necessary works and preparations, from these and other advantages, can be accomplished at least three or four months sooner there than any where else.</P>
<P>In consequence of his opinion, which I esteem of weight, particularly in this instance—and knowing the importance of, and how essential these establishments are—I have ven∣tured to order the works to be begun there, without regard to what had been done at Brookfield, which was of but little consequence. The former, besides the many advantages mentioned by general Knox, stands on Connecticut-river, and has a good navigation: yet is entirely secure against any attempts of the enemy, being twenty miles above Hartford, where the river is narrow, and too shoal to admit vessels that can give the least annoyance. As nothing but the good of the service could have led to this measure, I trust it will be approved.</P>
<P>I have wrote to the assembly of Massachusetts State and the convention of New-Hampshire, requesting their good offices and exertions to promote the raising of their regiments
<PB N="28" REF="029737_0366_0FE24AEFEC8A5418"/>
as expeditiously as possible, and to forward the whole of the quot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> first exacted from them, to Ticonderoga. Their contiguity to that post more than to any other—the import∣ance of it, and general Schuyler's apprehensions that the enemy may attempt to pass the lake (if not on the ice) as soon as it is open—added to the great trouble, expense, and loss of time it will save in marching them elsewhere, and others there who are much more distant and remote—induced me to determine so. I find the council of the former, on general Schuyler's earnest application, before my letter reached them, had determined to send four regi∣ments as soon as they could be completed. I only wish the whole may be made up in a short time, and that their arrival may be early enough to prevent those inconveniences and fatal consequences which the want of a sufficient force in that quarter would subject us to, were the enemy to pass the lakes at this time.</P>
<P>Mr. James Mease is now here in consequence of being appointed clothier-general. He is adjusting a plan for an∣swering the end of his appointment, and making an estimate, to be laid before Congress or their secret committee, of such clothes as may be necessary to import for the army.</P>
<P>It is with much concern that the situation of our affairs obliges me to mention so frequently the want of money, es∣pecially when I am persuaded every means are used to fur∣nish it. Our distress on this account is great indeed; and the injury the service receives, almost inconceivable:—not a day, an hour, or scarcely a minute passes, without com∣plaints and applications on this head. The recruiting the regiments is most materially retarded by it.</P>
<P><HI>Ten o'clock, P. M.</HI>—Just now a flag returned, that went to Brunswic to-day, who brought the inclosed letters from general Lee, which I do myself the honour to transmit you, with a copy of one to myself.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour to inclose you a plan drawn up by doctor Shippen in c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert with doctor Cochran, for
<PB N="29" REF="029737_0367_0FE24B449E6AB288"/>
the arrangement and future regulation of the general hospi∣tal. As this plan is very extensive, the appointments numer∣ous, and the salaries affixed to them at present, large, I did not think myself at liberty to adopt any part of it before I laid it before Congress for their approbation. I will just re∣mark, that, though the expense attending an hospital upon the inclosed plan will be very great, it will in the end not only be a saving to the public, but the only possible method of keeping an army a-foot.</P>
<P>We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now at an enormous bounty, and with no small difficulty, recruiting an army of upwards of a hundred bat∣talions. The ensuing campaign may, from the same causes, prove as sickly as the last: and if the hospitals are in no better condition for the reception of the sick, our regiments will be reduced to companies by the end of the campaign; and those poor wretches who escape with life will be either scattered up and down the country, and not to be found, or, if found, totally enervated and unfit for further duty. By these means not only the bounty is lost, but the man is lost also: and I leave you to judge whether we have men enough to allow of such a consumption of lives and consti∣tutions as have been lost the last campaign. For my own part I am certain, that, if the army which I hope we shall have in the field this year is suffered to moulder away by sickness as it did the last, we must look for reinforcements to some other places than our own States.</P>
<P>The number of officers mentioned in the inclosed plan I presume are necessary for us, because they are found so in the British hospitals: and, as they are established upon the surest basis,—that of long experience under the ablest phy∣sicians and surgeons,—we should not hesitate a moment in adopting their regulations, when they so plainly tend to correct and improve our former want of method and knowl∣edge in this important department.</P>
<P>The pay affixed to the different appointments is, as I said before, great, and perhaps more than you may think adequate to the service. In determining upon the sum that is to be allowed to each, you ought to consider that it should be such as will induce gentlemen of character and skill in their profession to step forth, and in some manner adequate to the practice which they have at home: for unless such
<PB N="30" REF="029737_0368_0FE24AF16E7B1FC8"/>
gentlemen are induced to undertake the care and manage∣ment of our hospitals, we had better trust to the force of nature and constitution, than suffer persons entirely ignorant of medicine to destroy us by ill-directed applications.</P>
<P>I hear from every quarter, that the dread of undergoing the same miseries for want of proper care and attention when sick, has much retarded the new enlistments, particularly to the southward. This is another reason for establishing our hospitals upon a large and generous plan: for we ought to make the service as agreeable and enticing as possible to the soldiery, many of whom (especially when we call forth the militia) not only quit the comforts but the luxuries of life.</P>
<P>A few days ago doctor * * * sent me the inclosed man∣uscript, which is a vindication of his conduct, upon which he desires a court of inquiry may be held. I transmit it to you by his direction. As I do not know what particular charges were alleged against him, I can say nothing to it or about it. You will find a plan of his also inclosed, for the better regulation of the hospital: but I think all his hints are included in doctor Shippen's plan.</P>
<P>As no time is to be lost in appointing the necessary of∣ficers, fixing upon the proper places for hospitals, and many other preparations, I could wish that Congress would take this matter under their immediate consideration, and favour me with their sentiments thereon as soon as possible.</P>

<P>THE principal design of this is to inform you, that we have strong reasons to believe that the enemy are on the point of making some push. What their object is,—whether to beat up our quarters and to extend their own, to make a large forage and collection of provender, of which they are in great want, or to turn their views towards the Delaware,—is a matter of uncertainty: but it seems probable that one of these things they have in contemplation. Such of their troops as have returned from Rhode-Island have landed at Amboy, and, with them, several pieces of heavy artillery. General Howe is come over too, and it is said, lord Percy.
<PB N="31" REF="029737_0369_0FE24B465D9FC938"/>
Their number at Brunswic and the landing place, before the arrival of this last reinforcement, was estimated from seven to eight thousand.</P>
<P>I have ordered the utmost vigilance and attention to be ob∣served at our several posts, to guard against surprises, and every preparation to be made that the weak and feeble state of our little army will admit of. At this time we are only about four thousand strong; a force, you will suppose, une∣qual to a successful opposition, if they were not militia, and far too small for the exigencies of our affairs. It is impossi∣ble to obtain exact returns, though they are daily called for, owing to the frequent and almost constant departure of some of the corps.</P>
<P>Colonel Nielson of Brunswic, with a detachment of mi∣litia, on the morning of the eighteenth, surprised major Stock∣don, whom he took with fifty-nine privates of general Skin∣ner's corps, killing four, and bringing away the arms of the whole, with some blankets. This about balances the loss of a militia guard which a party of British troops took last week in Monmouth, near the Hook.</P>
<P>I wish to be informed how the regiments that are raising are to be armed, and of the provision that has been made for the same. I have reason to fear, indeed I am convinced, that there is a great deficiency in many, if not in the whole of the States, in this article: every letter that I receive from them mentions their want, and calls for supplies.</P>

<P>MONSIEUR Faneuil, who some time ago laid a plan before you for raising and officering a corps of Frenchmen, waited upon me yesterday. His success, as I expected, has been small in enlisting or rather engaging Can∣adians. I cannot find that he has met with more than thir∣ty or forty who would be willing to serve with him. He is now upon another scheme,—that of raising, arming and clothing a number of men in the French islands. To grant a commission of that kind is without the extent of my pow∣ers, and I have therefore desired him to go forward, and lay
<PB N="32" REF="029737_0370_0FE24AF2F113CC08"/>
his proposals before Congress. If they appear feasible, they may be adopted▪ but I would beg leave to observe that one precaution will be necessary, that is, that the commis∣sions of monsieur Faneuil and his officers should depend upon the performance of their agreement for raising any certain number of men.</P>
<P>I have often mentioned to you the distress I am every now and then laid under by the application of French of∣ficers for commissions in our service. This evil, if I may call it so, is a growing one: for, from what I learn, they are coming in swarms from old France and the islands. There will therefore be a necessity of providing for them or discountenancing them. To do the first is difficult; and the last, disagreeable, and perhaps impolitic, if they are men of merit:—and it is impossible to distinguish these from mere adventurers, of whom, I am convinced, there are the greatest number. They seldom bring more than a com∣mission and passport, which, we know, may belong to a bad as well as a good officer.</P>
<P>Their ignorance of our language, and their inability to re∣cruit men, are unsurmountable obstacles to their being in∣grafted into our continental battalions: for our officers, who have raised their men, and have served through the war up∣on pay that has hitherto not borne their expenses, would be disgusted if foreigners were put over their heads:—and I assure you, few or none of these gentlemen look lower than field-officers' commissions. To give them all brevets, by which they have rank and draw pay without doing any ser∣vice, is saddling the continent with a vast expense: and to form them into corps, would be only establishing corps of officers; for, as I said before, they cannot possibly raise any men.</P>
<P>Some general mode of disposing of them must be adopted; for it is ungenerous to keep them in suspense, and at great charge to themselves: but I am at a loss how to point out this mode. Suppose they were told in general, that no man could obtain a commission, except he could raise a number of men in proportion to his rank. This would effectually stop the mouths of common appliers, and would leave us at liberty to make provision for gentlemen of undoubted
<PB N="33" REF="029737_0371_0FE24B47E10C3C50"/>
military character and merit, who would be very useful to us as soon as they acquired our language.</P>
<P>If you approve of this, or can think of any better meth∣od, be pleased to inform me as soon as you possibly can▪ for, if I had a decisive answer to give them, it would not only save me much trouble but much time, which I am now obliged to bestow in hearing their different pretensions to merit, and their expectations thereupon.</P>
<P>I inclose you the papers which Monsieur Faneuil origi∣nally laid before the council of Massachusetts: they may be of use if you enter into a negociation with him.</P>

<P>CONGRESS having resolved that several regiments of cavalry should be raised to form a part of their army, I beg leave, through you, to lay before them the inclosed list of officers which appear necessary to be appointed to each corps, and which they will be pleased to establish. At the same time I should suppose it highly expedient to fix their pay and that of the privates. There is now one regiment in service, and three more recruiting: this makes it indis∣pensably necessary that it should be done. Applications are constantly making to know what the pay is, and objections raised against the service for want of due information.</P>
<P>I have transmitted a list of such pay as seemed to be thought reasonable for part of the officers to receive when colonel Sheldon's regiment was directed to be levied, and a copy of the memorandum made at that time. This, col∣onel Sheldon conceived, would not be more than adequate to their services, trouble, and expense, and which in some degree was founded on the opinions of other gentlemen of whom inquiry was made upon the subject. I did not fix it in the instances where it is set down with certainty, as the memorandum will shew. A criterion, by which I was also governed upon that occasion, was the resolve appoint∣ing Mr. Sheldon lieutenant-colonel-commandant, with the rank and pay of colonel. From thence I attempted to pro∣portion that of some other officers. Upon the whole, I

think it should be settled without further loss of time, and wish the earliest attention of Congress to be had to it.</P>
<P>Our delicate and truly critical situation, for want of a suf∣ficient force to oppose the enemy who are now ready, and, before many days elapse, will take the field, induced me to expect that the troops raising in the southern States, and intended for this army, would march in companies or half companies as they were made up, without waiting for their regiments to be complete. Policy strongly suggested the propriety of the measure, and I requested it: but, to my great anxiety and surprise, I am told that this line of con∣duct is totally neglected, though a great number of recruits are actually engaged. I must entreat Congress to interpose again with their most pressing applications and commands that this expedient be adopted without a moment's delay. No injury can result from it, because a sufficient number of proper officers can and must be left, to recruit the corps to their full complement.</P>
<P>Nor will my fears respecting the state of our arms allow me to be silent on that head. Let the States be urged to send their men equipped with them and every other neces∣sary, if possible. I know not what supplies may be in store elsewhere, or in the power of Congress: but they must not depend upon their being furnished here with any, or but with very few:—no human prudence or precaution could secure but a small part of those belonging to the public, and in the hands of the soldiery, from being embezzled and carried off when their time of service expired; nor can the same abuses be restrained in the militia.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO military operation of any consequence has occur∣red since I had the honour of writing to you last, except that on Sunday I received information that the enemy were advancing in a manner and in numbers so much greater than usual, that it looked like a prelude to an attack upon our posts, which were immediately put in the best prepara∣tion to receive them. It turned out to be only a stronger
<PB N="35" REF="029737_0373_0FE24B4964F2FFE8"/>
foraging party than usual. They were however opposed in so spirited a manner by our advanced parties, that they were checked, and retired in the afternoon towards Amboy, from whence they came. Their loss in the course of the day, from the best accounts I can get, amounts to about one hundred in killed, wounded, prisoners, and deserters. Some people who were near the scene of action, and who have picked up accounts from those who have since been in Amboy, are sanguine enough to suppose that they have lost five hundred all together: but of this I have no conception. Our loss was only two killed and ten wounded.</P>
<P>I was in hopes, that, by the time the militia who are now in service would be discharged, we should have a con∣siderable number of the new levies in the field: but, though I have reports from all quarters of the great success of re∣cruiting, I cannot get a man of them into service. General Johnson's militia all go the fifth of March (many are gone already) and general Lincoln's on the fifteenth. These two bodies form so considerable a part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur force, that, unless they are replaced, I shall be left in a manner desti∣tute: for I have no great hopes of seeing an equal number of continental troops by that time.</P>
<P>I have wrote to Pennsylvania, to endeavour to get a re∣inforcement of militia from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence; and I am told the mi∣litia from the counties of Baltimore, Hartford, and Cecil, in Maryland, are on their march: but as I have it not from any authority, I know not when to expect them, or in what numbers. They are about passing a militia-law in this State, which may perhaps have some effect: but at present they are under no regulation at all.</P>
<P>I have in my late letters recommended several things to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our consideration, particularly that of a promotion of general officers. The very well-being of the new army depends upon its being done speedily. Not only this, but we are now suffering for want of brigadiers. General Schuyler has wrote most pressingly for the assistance of gen∣eral officers; and I have none to send him without injur∣ing the service in this quarter. The hospital plan too re∣quires an answer, as nothing can be done in the nomina∣tion of the proper officers till I have your determination. There are several other matters of consequence before you,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this evening honoured with your favour of the twenty-third ultimo, accompanied by sundry proceed∣ings of Congress. Those respecting general Lee, and which prescribe the treatment of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the five Hessian field-officers, are the cause of this letter.</P>
<P>Though I sincerely commiserate the misfortunes of gen∣eral Lee, and feel much for his present unhappy situation, yet, with all possible deference to the opinion of Congress, I fear that these resolutions would not have the desired ef∣fect—are founded in impolicy—and will, if adhered to, produce consequences of an extensive and melancholy na∣ture. Retaliation is certainly just, and sometimes necessa∣ry, even where attended with the severest penalties: but, when the evils which may and must result from it exceed those intended to be redressed, prudence and policy require that it should be avoided. Having premised thus much, I beg leave to examine the justice and expediency of it in the instances now before us.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="029737_0375_0FE24B515DE60D80"/>
From the best information I have been able to obtain, general Lee's usage has not been so disgraceful and dishon∣ourable as to authorise the treatment decreed to those gen∣tlemen, was it not prohibited by many other important con∣siderations. His confinement, I believe, has been more rigorous than has been generally experienced by the rest of our officers, or those of the enemy who have been in our possession: but if the reports be true, (received on that head) he has been provided with a decent apartment and with most things necessary to render him comfortable. This is not the case with one of the officers comprehended in the resolves, if his letter, of which a copy is transmitted, deserves your credit. Here retaliation seems to have been prematurely begun; or, to speak with more propriety, severities have been and are exercised towards colonel Campbell, not justified by any that general Lee has yet received.</P>
<P>In point of policy, under the present situation of our af∣fairs, this doctrine cannot be supported. The balance of prisoners is greatly against us; and a general regard to the happiness of the whole should mark our conduct. Can we imagine that our enemies will not mete the same punish∣ments, the same indignities, the same cruelties, to those be∣longing to us, in their possession, that we impose on theirs in our power? Why should we suppose them to possess more humanity than we have ourselves? or why should an inef∣fectual attempt to relieve the distresses of one brave unfor∣tunate man involve many more in the same calamities?</P>
<P>However disagreeable the fact may be, the enemy at this time have in their power, and subject to their call, near three hundred officers belonging to the army of the United States. In this number there are some of high rank; and most of them are men of bravery and of merit. The quota of theirs in our hands bears no proportion, being not more than fifty at most. Under these circumstances we should certainly do no act to draw upon the gentlemen belonging to us, and who have already suffered a long captivity, greater punishments than they have and now experience. If we should, what will their feelings be, and those of their numerous and ex∣tensive connexions?—Suppose the treatment prescribed for the Hessians should be pursued, will it not establish what the enemy have been aiming to effect by every artifice and
<PB N="38" REF="029737_0376_0FE24B00BB5DD488"/>
the grossest misrepresentations,—I mean, an opinion of our enmity towards them, and of the cruel conduct they expe∣rience when they fall into our hands,—a prejudice which we on our part have heretofore thought it politic to sup∣press and to root out by every act of lenity and of kindness? It certainly will:—the Hessians would hear of the punish∣ment with all the circumstances of heightened exaggera∣tion—would feel the injury, without investigating the cause, or reasoning upon the justice or necessity of it. The mis∣chiefs, which may and must inevitably flow from the execu∣tion of the resolves, appear to be endless and innumerable.</P>
<P>On my own part, I have been much embarrassed on the subject of exchanges already. Applications are daily made by both friends and enemies, to complete them as far as circumstances of number and rank will apply. Some of the former have complained that a discrimination is about to be adopted, perhaps injurious to their reputation, and certainly depriving them of their right of exchange in due course, as established upon the principles of equality pro∣posed last year, acceded to by both parties, and now sub∣sisting. The latter charge me with a breach of faith, and call upon me to perform the agreement.</P>
<P>Many more objections might be subjoined, were they material:—I shall only observe that the present state of our army (if it deserves that name) will not authorise the lan∣guage of retaliation or the style of menace. This will be conceded by all who know that the whole of our force is weak and trifling, and composed of militia (a very few reg∣ular troops excepted) whose service is on the eve of ex∣piring.</P>
<P>There are several other matters which might be men∣tioned upon this subject, would time and opportunity per∣mit: but as they will not, I beg leave to refer you to col∣onel Walker, who will deliver this, and give satisfaction to any inquiries that may be deemed necessary. Persuading myself that Congress will indulge the liberty I have taken upon this occasion, I have only to wish for the result of their deliberations after they have reconsidered the resolves, and to assure them that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour to transmit you the inclosed copy of a letter from general Lee, received by a flag on Tuesday last. You will perceive from thence his wishes and expectations of seeing some members of Congress in conse∣quence of his letter upon that subject. None of the pass∣ports which he mentions were sent out, though the letter came by general Howe's permission as the others did. I should be happy to relieve his anxiety as far as I could, by sending in major Morris: but this I cannot do till a safe-conduct is granted.</P>
<P>The more I consider the resolves respecting lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Hessian officers, the more con∣vinced I am of their impolicy. The proposition made by Congress for the exchange of prisoners, and which by their direction was transmitted to general Howe, was found∣ed on principles of equality in number and in rank. From hence no demand, as a matter of right, can be made of general Lee's releasement for any officer or number of of∣ficers of inferior rank: whatever is or might be done in such instance, would be of favour and indulgence. The only cartel that now subsists is the one I have mentioned. This, so far as it goes, is a beneficial one: it recognises the rank of our officers, and insures their discharge from captivity whenever we are possessed of a like number belonging to them, and of the same rank. If on our part it should be violated,—if it is not observed,—surely it will and must cease to be obligatory on general Howe. What conse∣quences may then ensue, I leave to your conjecture.</P>
<P>If it be objected that the above observations, and what I said in my former letter, prove that no treatment receiv∣ed by our officers should be retaliated on theirs,—my an∣swer is, that the proportion of officers in their hands is at least six to one in ours. This consideration, supposing we had a right to demand general Lee's liberty, would be of great weight, and sufficient to prevent, in my opinion, the execution of the resolves. I have the honour to be, in haste, your most obedient servant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured several days ago with your letter of the twenty-fifth ultimo, with its inclosures, the receipt of which was omitted to be acknowledged in my last.</P>
<P>Could I accomplish the important objects so eagerly wish∣ed by Congress,—"confining the enemy within their pres∣ent quarters,—preventing their getting supplies from the country, and totally subduing them before they are rein∣forced,"—I should be happy indeed. But what prospect or hope can there be of my effecting so desirable a work at this time? The inclosed return, to which I solicit the most serious attention of Congress, comprehends the whole force I have in Jersey. It is but a handful, and bears no pro∣portion, on the scale of numbers, to that of the enemy. Added to this, the major part is made up of militia. The most sanguine in speculation cannot deem it more than ade∣quate to the least valuable purposes of war.</P>
<P>The reinforcements mentioned to be drawn from general Heath were merely ideal,—nearly the whole of the eastern troops which were with him being here before. They were only engaged till to-day: and to-day they leave the camp. Their service has been of pretty long continuance, and al∣most the whole of the winter months. What prospect there may be of immediate succours from other quarters, I know not: but from the militia of this State I cannot expect to derive much more aid. Those who are well affected have been so frequently called from their homes, that they are tired out, and almost profess an abhorrence of the service: nor have I heard as yet that any continental troops are on the way. I have wrote to the brigadiers-general in most of the States upon the subject, and also to the colonels, urging them by every motive to exert themselves in filling the reg∣iments, and to forward them on.</P>
<P>I confess, Sir, I feel the most painful anxiety when I reflect on our situation and that of the enemy. Unless the levies arrive soon, we must, before it be long, experience some interesting and melancholy event. I believe the en∣emy have fixed their object, and the execution will surely be attempted as soon as the roads are pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble. The un∣prepared state in which we are, favours all their designs;
<PB N="41" REF="029737_0379_0FE24B556ED2D8D0"/>
and it is much to be wished that they may not succeed to their warmest expectations.</P>
<P>On recurring to the late promotions of brigadiers, I find the number appointed to be short of what I took the liberty to recommend, and not competent to the exigencies of the service, supposing the whole in office before, and those lately created, consent to act, which I have reason to believe will not be the case. I shall only beg leave to refer you to my former letters upon this subject, and to assure you that many disadvantages will result from not having a sufficient number of officers of this rank. We have always been de∣ficient in this instance; and certain I am that the service has been greatly injured by it. The proportion I mentioned was full small, and, in my opinion, should not be dispensed with.</P>
<P>I would also take the liberty of mentioning again (having received no answer upon the subject) that settling the hos∣pital plan and establishment becomes more and more nec∣essary. It is an object of infinite importance; and the dif∣ficulties of doing it on a proper foundation will be great, if not almost insurmountable, should it be deferred till the campaign opens, and the enemy begin their operations. The benefits of the institution will soon be known:—the want was severely felt in the course of the last year.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which claims, in my opinion, the earliest attention of Congress,—I mean the pay of the regimental surgeons, and that of the mates. These ap∣pointments are so essential, that they cannot be done with∣out. The pay, in the first instance, is so low, so inadequate to the services which should be performed, that no man sustaining the character of a gentleman, and who has the least medical abilities or skill in the profession, can think of accepting it: that in the latter is so paltry and trifling, that none, of the least generosity of sentiment or pretensions to merit, can consent to act for it. In a word, these are in∣conveniences of an interesting nature:—they amount to an exclusion of persons who could discharge the duties of those offices; and, if not redressed, there is not the smallest prob∣ability that any can be prevailed on to enter them again.</P>
<P>There are several matters also which I referred to Con∣gress some time since, and upon which I have not received
<PB N="42" REF="029737_0380_0FE24B0C3951DFB8"/>
the result of their deliberations.—One inquiry, about the state of arms and ammunition, I am peculiarly anxious to be satisfied in.</P>
<P>From the inconveniences and injuries to the service of late for want of money, I am induced to request that the strictest regard should be had to furnishing the pay-master with constant and sufficient supplies. On Sunday he re∣ceived five hundred thousand dollars, half of which is al∣ready expended, and the balance in a day or two will be entirely swept away▪ without discharging the several claims. By his report, the commissary here requires an immediate draught for a hundred thousand; and the militia returning and about to leave camp, a hundred and twenty thousand more. The expense incurred by calling on them so fre∣quently is almost incredible. Besides these, there are sev∣eral arrears due to the old troops, and to most of the gen∣eral and staff officers.</P>

<P>I fully intended to transmit you a general return, but am not able to make it out with precision. However, from the most accurate estimate that I can form, the whole of our numbers in Jersey, fit for duty at this time, is under three thousand.

The troops under inoculation, including their at∣tendants, amount to about one thousand.</P>

<P>THE difficulty if not impossibility of giving Congress a just idea of our situation (and of several other important matters requiring their earliest attention) by letter, has in∣duced me to prevail on major-general Greene to wait upon them for that purpose. This gentleman is so much in my confidence, so intimately acquainted with my ideas,—with our strength and our weaknesses,—with every thing respect∣ing the army,—that I have thought it unnecessary to partic∣ularize or prescribe any certain line or duty of inquiries for him. I shall only say, from the rank he holds as an able and good officer in the estimation of all who know him, he

To prevent inconveniences of the like nature in future, I have thought it proper that an estimate of the monthly advances should be formed and laid before Congress. This colonel Palfrey will do; and though it cannot be effected with a degree of scrupulous exactness and precision, yet from his intimate knowledge of the incidental charges and expenses in the common course of things, the calculation, I apprehend, will be attended with many benefits. It will shew Congress the necessary provisions of money to be made for ordinary contingencies, and enable them to form a rule for their government in the instance of supplies for the army.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY a letter, of which the inclosed is a copy, came to my hands. The account is confirmed by a countryman who is since come in: but nothing distinct has yet been received.</P>
<P>The aid required of me in colonel Hay's letter cannot be given: I have no men to oppose the enemy's designs in any one quarter, although called upon from every quarter. All that was possible for me to do towards collecting a force at Peekskill, I had attempted before: I had in peremptory terms called upon the officers of Rhode-Island and Con∣necticut to forward on their recruits under proper officers as fast as possible to that place: I had directed such of the New-York regiments as had been ordered to Ticonderoga, to repair thither: I had requested eight of the Massachusetts regiments to be marched to that post: and left these should not arrive in time, I urged governor Trumbull, in a letter of the sixth instant, to send two thousand of his militia to the same place. But sorry I am to observe, the militia have got tired; and the colonels of the continental regiments have been greatly deceived themselves,—have greatly de∣ceived me,—or the most unheard-of desertions * * * have prevailed * * *: for regiments, reported two or
<PB N="45" REF="029737_0383_0FE24B60A86C4828"/>
three months ago to be half completed, are, upon the colo∣nels being called upon in positive terms for a just state of them, found to contain less than one hundred men; and this not the case of a single regiment only, but of many. In Connecticut alone, by a letter from general Parsons, of the sixth instant, four regiments are mentioned as not hav∣ing more than eighty rank and file, each.</P>
<P>These, Sir, are melancholy truths: but facts they are, and necessary to be known to Congress, however prudent it may be to conceal them from the observation of others.</P>
<P>To superintend the business of recruiting,—to see that the officers were diligent,—to prevent impositions if pos∣sible,—to appoint fit places of rendezvous,—to see that the recruits were actually brought to those places, and there equipped and trained for the field,—were among the great objects which early and repeatedly induced me to press the appointment of general officers: but unfortunately the delay of appointing, being followed by the resignation of some officers and non-acceptance of others, will involve the army in a mere chaos of confusion at a time when the utmost order and regularity should prevail, and when all our arrangements ought to be completely established. The medical department will, it is much to be feared, be in the same situation:—not an officer yet appointed to it.</P>
<P>For want of proper and coercive powers,—from disaf∣fection and other causes,—the militia of this State are not to be depended upon. They are drawn out with difficul∣ty, and at a most enormous expense, as their accounts will shew: they come, you can scarce tell how; they go, you hardly know when. In the same predicament are those of Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>Numbers from this State have joined the enemy; and many more are disposed to do so, as the letter from Mr. Hoff (a copy of which is inclosed, corresponding with sev∣eral others of the same tenor) sufficiently evinces.</P>

<P>The arrival of the arms, locks and flints, you have been pleased to mention, is a most fortunate and happy event. I join you most sincerely in congratulations upon the occasion.</P>
<P>I have not yet obtained a certain account of the ex∣pedition against and destruction of Peekskill.

It is said that it was done in part by our own people when they found that they could not pre∣vent them falling into the enemy's hands. The ships and troops have gone down the river again.</P>
<P>Mr. Kirkland, the Oneida missionary, arrived here this week, with a chief warrior and five other Indians of that nation. They had been to Boston, and came from thence to this place to inquire into the true state of matters, that they might report them to a grand council to be shortly held. They said things were so falsely and variously rep∣resented by our enemies through their agents, that they did not know what to depend on. I invited them to go to Philadelphia: but they declined it, declaring they were well satisfied with what they had seen, and that they were authorised to tell their nation, all they had heard from the enemy was false. Being told that France was assisting us, and about to join in the war, they seemed highly pleased; and Mr. Kirkland said he was persuaded it

would have a considerable effect on the minds of several of the nations, and secure to us their neutrality, if not a declaration and commencement of hostilities in our favour. I shewed them every civility in my power, and every thing that I thought material to excite in them an idea of our strength and independence.

<P>CAPTAIN Deshields, of Mr. Buchanan's ship from Baltimore, who was taken by the enemy and carried into York, made his escape from thence on Saturday evening. He informs that three thousand troops, British and Hessian, embarked about ten days ago from the city and Staten-Island, on board transports which were lying at the latter when he came away. He adds that the enemy have built
<PB N="48" REF="029737_0386_0FE24B1101E9AF60"/>
and are building a number of light flat-bottomed boats, about seventy of which were finished.</P>
<P>Captain Deshields says it seemed to be the general opin∣ion and conversation that this embarkation was for Chesa∣peak-bay, with a view of making a descent on the Eastern-Shore, or that the troops were to proceed to the Head of Elk, taking Annapolis and Baltimore in their way. There were some who thought it probable they mean to go up the North-river and attempt the Highland fortifications. I have written to general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal and Clinton, desiring them to make the best preparation that circumstances will admit of, for their reception, in case the latter should be their object.</P>
<P>Captain Deshields being in company with the captain of the packet, but unknown to him, heard him say that a war with France was much expected when he left England, which was about the beginning of February.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of writing to you last, I have received the inclosed from general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal, which contains a full account of the late affair at Peekskill. Eve∣ry prudential step appears to have been taken by the gener∣al, and as good a disposition made as his small number of men would admit of.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing further respecting the embarkation of troops which I mentioned in my last. I am in hopes the Connecticut militia will arrive at Peekskill before an∣other expedition is made up the North-river. I have wrote to hasten them as much as possible, lest such another de∣sign should be really in agitation. In my opinion, Dela∣ware-bay is their object, and Chesapeak only thrown out by way of blind: their late attempt to procure Dela∣ware pilots seems to confirm it.</P>
<P>I observe by your late promotions that a foreign gentle∣man is appointed to the command of the German battalion. I could wish that he was ordered to join immediately,
<PB N="49" REF="029737_0387_0FE24B63E19E3B50"/>

<P>P. S. I have ordered the deputy quarter-master-general to establish proper relays of expresses between this and Philadelphia, that intelligence may be occasionally convey∣ed in the most expeditious manner. If there should be any appearance of a fleet in Delaware-bay, it will be known in a very few hours in Philadelphia, by hoisting the sig∣nals; and I beg I may have the earliest notice of it. The quarter-master will inform you who his rider in Philadel∣phia is, that you may know where to apply.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with yours of the fourth, inclosing sundry resolves of Congress from the twenty-ninth of March to the fifth instant. I am extremely glad to see the resolve for the immediate removal of military stores from Baltimore and Annapolis: for, although I do not imagine that the enemy intend an expedition of any great conse∣quence in Chesapeak-bay, yet while the stores lay at the above-mentioned places, they were always subject to be destroyed by a sudden attack of a ship of war with a few land forces.</P>
<P>The regulations for the pay-master-general's department are very salutary, and, if carried strictly into execution, will make a vast saving to the public. It may be easily done when the army is put upon a regular footing: but while we are obliged to make use of militia, we must submit to all the irregularities that naturally attend them, and must not therefore expect to have the rule as scrupulously complied with by them as could be wished. * * *</P>
<P>The muster-master-general complained that the duty re∣quired of him was more than he could perform: but by the late resolves there is an ample allowance for deputies; and therefore no further excuse can be made upon that head.</P>
<P>I most ardently wish to see the hospital established. I am afraid too much time has been lost in the consideration
<PB N="50" REF="029737_0388_0FE24B1C450D0B88"/>
of the plan: but the gentlemen who shall be appointed to the superintendence must endeavour to make up for lost time by their diligence.</P>
<P>By the latest accounts from Brunswic, it looks as if the enemy were projecting an embarkation. They have been stripping the buildings of boards, and cutting small timber, and transporting them from Brunswic to Amboy. It is imagined this is to build births in their transports. I shall keep a constant look-out upon the motions of their vessels, and shall endeavour to obtain every intelligence by sending people into their quarters. I think Delaware-bay must be their destination, if they move by water.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS just now honoured with your letter of the ninth instant, covering sundry resolutions of Congress. Those for regulating the hospital and medical department, I trust, will prove of the most salutary consequences. It is only to be regretted that this necessary and liberal insti∣tution had not been gone into and completed at an earlier period.</P>
<P>The honours Congress have decreed to the memory of generals Warren and Mercer afford me the highest pleas∣ure: their character and merit had a just claim to every mark of respect; and I heartily wish that every officer of the United States, emulating their virtues, may by their actions secure to themselves the same right to the grateful tributes of their country.</P>
<P>Since writing to you yesterday I have received further intelligence of the enemy's preparations in York, indicating a movement before long. It is contained in the inclosed letter, N<SUP>o</SUP> 1, and corroborates the opinion I have long en∣tertained that they would make a push against Philadelphia. The tory regiments mentioned, we are told, are at Hack∣insac, and are about five hundred strong, exclusive of a company of Highlanders which is with them.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter from le chevalier count De Vrecourt came to hand this morning,—which I have thought proper
<PB N="51" REF="029737_0389_0FE299D28050EEC0"/>
to transmit to Congress, that they may consider his case, and adopt such measures respecting him as his character and testimonials deserve. I never heard of him before: but if he is a skilful engineer, he will be extremely useful, and should be employed, though he may not understand our language. At this time we have not one with the army, nor one to join it, of the least reputation or preten∣sions to skill. If this gentleman came in consequence of an agreement with doctor Franklin, and brought creden∣tials from him, I should suppose him to be acquainted with what he was recommended for.</P>
<P>The cartel, proposed to be settled, and so long in agita∣tion, is not accomplished yet: the last meeting on that business was the second instant, when nothing was done: nor is a further interview appointed respecting it. I have transmitted a copy of lord Cornwallis's letter which came out the next day, with that of the paper alluded to by him, which Mr. Harrison refused to receive from colonel Walcot, and of my answer to the latter in a letter to general Howe. The objections or articles mentioned by colonel Walcot were those general Greene had with him, and which he left when he came from Philadelphia: the original I have by me. Those points were insisted on again, and rejected, and a tender made of the paper by colonel Walcot, which he brought with him prepared.</P>
<P>I have appointed John Wilkens, John Steel, Mathew Irvine, and Samuel Kersley, esquires, captains of companies to be raised by them, in consequence of the recommenda∣tion of general Armstrong. As the interest of those gen∣tlemen lies in Pennsylvania chiefly, and it would be draw∣ing money from the pay-master here to carry to Philadel∣phia, (supposing there was a supply in the chest, which is not the case) I shall be obliged by Congress's ordering six hundred dollars to be advanced to each of them on ac∣count of the recruiting service; the first of whom I imag∣ine is in Philadelphia. If this requisition can be complied with, he, I presume, will give notice to the rest; or, if general Armstrong is informed of it, he will do it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with yours of the tenth, accompanied with one from the committee of Congress to whom I have wrote very fully upon the subject of the resolve for forming an army upon the west side of Delawar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and to which I refer you. I wish I could see any prospect of an army, fit to make proper opposition, formed any where. You will perhaps be surprised at this, after the public reports of the great success of recruiting in all the States; but, to convince you that these are but bare reports, I will give you the best information I have been able to collect from actual returns and other accounts.</P>
<P>New-Hampshire.—No returns: but a letter from gen∣eral Heath says they are tolerably forward. All their regiments go to the northward.</P>
<P>Massachusetts.—About four hundred men raised to a regiment; many of these yet to undergo inoculation. Seven of their regiments go to the northward, and eight are to come to Peekskill for the present.</P>
<P>Rhode-Island.—Only three hundred and sixty men en∣listed in both regiments the first of April. Two hundred of these are yet to be inoculated. General Varnum writes me that he despairs of filling up the regiments.</P>
<P>Connecticut.—By a return from general Parsons, of the fourth of April, about eighteen hundred men were recruited through the whole State,—they, much dispersed;—many to have the small-pox; and recruiting at a stand.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="029737_0391_0FE299D55AC706B8"/>
New-York.—About two hundred men to a regiment: and, from the peculiar situation of that province, it will be almost impossible for them to fill up their regiments though they exert themselves very much.</P>
<P>New-Jersey.—Between two and three hundred to a regiment. They also lie under many difficulties on ac∣count of the disaffection of their State: but their officers are active and diligent.</P>
<P>Pennsylvania.—Most of her regiments are very back∣ward; those most so who have been longest recruiting.</P>
<P>Delaware State.—No return of their regiment.</P>
<P>Maryland.—I have only the return of one regiment, which consists of two hundred men; but I do not believe the others are in more forwardness. The disputes about the rank of officers have prevailed so much, that the re∣cruiting service has been in a manner neglected.</P>
<P>Virginia.—The nine old regiments will not exceed eigh∣teen hundred effective men: and governor Henry, in a letter which I received yesterday, informs me that he did not think that more than four of the six new ones would be filled. He proposes the expediency of raising volunteer companies to serve seven or eight months, to make up the deficiency: but this I shall object to on many accounts, particularly that it would be introducing a body of men who would look upon themselves at liberty to do what they pleased, and, the moment their time expired, would leave us, though at the most critical juncture.</P>
<P>If the men that are raised, few as they are, could be got into the field, it would be a matter of some consolation; but every method that I have been able to devise has prov∣ed ineffectual. If I send an officer to collect the sick and scattered of his regiment, it is ten to one but he neglects his duty, goes home on pleasure or business, and the next that I hear of him is that he has resigned:—furloughs are no more attended to than if there was no limitation of time: and in short, Sir, there is such a total depression of that mil∣itary ardour which I hoped would have inspired every of∣ficer when he found his pay genteelly augmented, and the army put upon a respectable footing, that it seems to me as if all public spirit was sunk. * * *</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="029737_0392_0FE24B7004062AA8"/>
I shall as soon as possible transmit to the board of war a list of the appointments I have made in consequence of the powers vested in me.</P>
<P>If the appointments in the hospital are not filled up be∣fore the receipt of this, I would take the liberty of men∣tioning a gentleman whom I think highly deserving of no∣tice, not only on account of his abilities, but for the very great assistance which he has afforded in the course of this winter, merely in the nature of a volunteer. The gentle∣man is doctor John Cochran, well known to all the faculty, and particularly to doctor Shippen, who, I suppose, has mentioned him among the candidates. The place for which the doctor is well fitted, and which would be most agreeable to him, is surgeon-general to the middle depart∣ment. In this line he served all the last war in the British service, and has distinguished himself this winter, particular∣ly in his attention to the small-pox patients and the wound∣ed, who, but for him and doctor Bond, must have suffered much, if not been totally neglected, as there were no other medical gentlemen to be found. If the appointment of surgeon-general is filled up, that of deputy-director of the middle department would be acceptable.</P>
<P>I have been thus full in my recommendation because doctor Cochran in a manner had my promise of one of the capital appointments in the hospital, upon a presumption that I should have had some hand in the nomination by the resolution of Congress empowering me to fill all commissions under the rank of brigadiers-general.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 13.—I have this moment received a line from general Lincoln, informing me that the enemy attempted to surprise him early this morning at his post at Bound-brook; but he made good his retreat to the pass of the mountains just in his rear, with trifling loss.</P>

<P>I HAVE nothing of importance to transmit Con∣gress, no event in the military line having happened since my last, except the surprising a small picquet guard of the enemy on Monday night at Bonemtown, and bringing off thirteen prisoners, by one of our parties. An enterprise of a similar nature was formed against that at Amboy, in which the party sent to effect it did not succeed so well, though the most advanced of them seized and secured three of their out-centries without giving an alarm.</P>
<P>By a letter from general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal, of yesterday, I am informed that he had received accounts of thirty-six sail of transports having left Newport on Friday last, with troops on board. Other reports he had were that a number of ships were coming up the Sound, so that we may reasonably conclude general Howe is drawing his forces from the east∣ward. General Arnold, in a letter of the sixth, mention∣ed, that, from the preparation of transports, and other circumstances, he thought it probable an embarkation was about to take place.</P>
<P>There are grounds to suspect, from information received, that some unfair practices have been and are meant to be used in certain exports from Philadelphia. It is said that a vessel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avigated by Frenchmen loaded there, belonging to * * * of New-York, which carried her cargo to gener∣al Howe; also that * * * and * * * of Monmouth-coun∣ty intend to load one or more for the same purpose, under the idea of sending them to foreign markets. I have writ∣ten to the board of war for Pennsylvania upon the subject,
<PB N="56" REF="029737_0394_0FE24B718A5F3660"/>
and doubt not but these hints will be properly improved, and such frauds guarded against as well as circumstances will admit.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a copy of an advertisement published in Gaine's paper of the fourteenth, which shews that no arti∣fices are left untried by the enemy to injure us. Before the appearance of this unparalleled piece, I had heard that a person was gone from York to Rhode-Island with a quantity of counterfeit money.</P>
<P>There is one thing which I beg leave to mention to Congress, and which I think highly deserving their atten∣tion, that is, that supplies of hard money, or bills of ex∣change to procure it, should, if possible, be sent to our pris∣oners in the hands of the enemy, at least to the officers, to relieve their wants. By letters which I have received from them of late, I find they are in great distress, and such as ought to be removed, if it can be done. No inconveni∣ence will result to the public from such supplies, if they can be furnished, as proper stoppages and deductions can be made from their pay.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 19.—I was honoured with your letter of the sixteenth between twelve and one o'clock yesterday, ac∣companied by sundry resolutions. I hope the measures Congress have adopted will produce the salutary conse∣quences they had in view: but I fear that the States, unless they are delicate in exercising the powers they are invested with for filling vacancies in instances of removal from office, and pay strict attention to a proper line of succession where there are no capital objections, will renew much of that confusion and disorder we have been endeav∣ouring to extricate ourselves from. Nor will this be of small difficulty, if they displace many officers: for, suppos∣ing them to have kept the most accurate lists of their orig∣inal appointments, changes have taken place in several instances from various causes unknown to them, and of which they cannot be apprised.</P>
<P>I can assure Congress the appellation given to the reg∣iments officered by me was without my consent or privity. As soon as I heard it, I wrote to several of the officers in terms of severe reprehension, and expressly charged them to suppress the distinction, adding that all the battalions
<PB N="57" REF="029737_0395_0FE299D8649CC5B0"/>
were on the same footing, and all under the general name of Continental.</P>
<P>An attack upon the king's troops at Rhode-Island was certainly a desirable event, could it have been conducted with success, or upon equal terms. It being an object of great moment, and involving in its issue many important consequences, I am led to believe the practicability of it has had much consideration, and the measure was found to be unadviseable under the circumstances of the troops collected for the purpose. If the enemy have not evac∣uated the island, I suppose the matter will be further weighed.</P>
<P>I do not find in the medical arrangement any mention of regimental surgeons'-mates, or provision made for their payment. Whether Congress mean to dispense with such officers or not, I cannot tell: I have heard that they do: but they appear to me to be absolutely necessary. We are often obliged to divide regiments and send a part to a distant post: when this is the case, it is essential that there should be some person with them to take charge of the sick or wounded, if such there should be. I have only mentioned this of many reasons that might be urged to shew the expediency of such appointments.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the many circumstances inducing a belief that Philadelphia will be the first object of the ene∣my's attention,—yet, as the stratagems of war are various, and they may be easily changed, especially when they have the entire command of the water,—I cannot but consider the detention of the troops at Philadelphia, farther than mentioned in my letter in answer to that from the board of war, as inexpedient, and subject to great inconvenience and injury. In the present divided, separated state of the army, we are weak at all points, and not able to make the least opposition promising success. Supposing they were collected here, they would be ready to act as necessity and circum∣stances might require. If the enemy pushed for Philadel∣phia, we should have notice of it, and could hang upon their flank and rear: nor is it likely they would undertake such an expedition without attempting the destruction or dispersion of the army first. If they embarked and should go by sea, we should have information of it, and could be
<PB N="58" REF="029737_0396_0FE24B730FF88810"/>
there in time. On the other hand, should all they have done prove a feint▪ and they should turn their views to the North-river, we should be in a much better situation to counteract their designs, and to check the progress of their arms in that quarter. Added to this, several of the reg∣iments, especially those which came first from Virginia and Pennsylvania, are so broken that it is impossible to do any thing with the parts that are here; and that spirit which is always derived from a corps being full, or as much so as circumstances of number will admit of, is entirely done away.</P>

<P>I WAS last night honoured with your letter of the twenty-fifth, with sundry resolves of Congress. Such of them as are necessary for my government and conduct I shall strictly attend to.</P>
<P>The money and bills for our prisoners had better be transmitted to Elias Boudinot, esquire, to whom I shall give directions to adopt ways and means for sending the same, and for a proper appropriation and distribution of the money amongst them. Bills, I think, will be most eligible, provided they are duly paid. As to procuring clothes in New-York, I have reason to believe that it will not be al∣lowed, and that the prisoners, will obtain no supplies but what we send them.</P>
<P>I heard of Mr. Franklin's practices some time ago, and advised governor Trumbull of the same, that his conduct might be properly attended to. It is very unhappy for us that, through the intrigues of such men, the enemy have found means to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aise a spirit of disaffection but too gen∣erally in many of the States. In this, I have strong assur∣ances

<P>I LAST night received the favour of your letter of the twenty-sixth, with the resolves to which it alludes.</P>
<P>The views of Congress, in sending general officers to the eastward to hasten on the troops, have been long an∣ticipated: general Poor is in New-Hampshire for the pur∣pose,—general Heath in Massachusetts-Bay, with the brig∣adiers Nixon, Glover and Patterson,—general Varnum in Rhode-Island, and general Parsons in Connecticut. Gen∣erals Spencer and Arnold too have been desired to attend to the business. To these gentlemen I have wrote repeat∣edly in the most pressing terms upon the subject, and I have no reason to doubt but every exertion on their part has been employed to promote the end. The delay of those who have enlisted has arisen from the late period when they engaged, and from their being inoculated since, which could not be dispensed with, without subjecting them to the calamities and ravage of the small-pox in the natu∣ral way.</P>
<P>At three o'clock this morning I received a letter from general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal inclosing three from colonel Huntington, copies of the whole of which I have transmitted. By these
<PB N="61" REF="029737_0399_0FE299E3B4880368"/>
you will perceive the impression which a part of general Howe's army has made into Connecticut, and the prospect they had of destroying such of our stores as were deposited in Danbury, which unfortunately were but too large and considerable, if the event has taken place. A circum∣stance, perhaps more to be regretted, is that the enemy marched through a strong and rough country, and were near that place, without the smallest opposition. I have no other information upon the subject than what these pa∣pers contain: but we have little ground to expect that they have not accomplished their purpose. Further intel∣ligence will be probably received to-day or to-morrow, when I shall be happy to hear that they have paid for their enterprise. Of this, I confess however, I am not very sanguine in my expectations.</P>
<P>This post had been considered as a proper depository for stores, by gentlemen acquainted with it; and its securi∣ty not thought questionable whilst troops were passing through it. I had also directed that as many of the draughts in Connecticut as the place was capable of ac∣commodating, should be collected there and inoculated, to answer the purpose of a guard, hoping by the time of their recovery, that the situation of the army would be such as to admit a strong one to be stationed there and continued: but, unhappily for us, such languor and supineness prevails every where, that we seem unable to effect any point we wish, though never so important and interesting. So ear∣ly as the sixth of March, I wrote to governor Trumbull, earnestly requesting two thousand militia to be sent to gen∣eral M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal to be employed at Peekskill and on the com∣munication in West-Chester county for six weeks. With this requisition he most readily complied so far as his or∣ders were necessary, and (I am certain) his influence would extend. This I have repeated, and this supply he has ex∣erted himself to furnish: yet so ineffectual have his endeav∣ours been, that not more than eight hundred had come out by general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal's return on the seventeenth in∣stant; nor did he expect more, from the accounts he had. In a word, Sir, no expedient or pains have been unattempt∣ed by me to bring on troops, and to keep our affairs on a favourable footing.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="029737_0400_0FE24B7E3B5583A0"/>
I would again mention the case of our prisoners with the enemy, and pray that the secret committee would send to Mr. Boudinot supplies of money for them as early as possi∣ble. They are in great distress, and many officers have lately escaped, contrary to the tenor of their parole; some of whom are now here, urging that necessity compelled them to the measure.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday honoured with your letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo, inclosing sundry resolves. Agreeable to the directions of Congress, I have written to the States of New-Hampshire and Massachusetts, and urged them to complete and forward their troops destined for Ticondero∣ga, with all possible expedition. The brigadiers gone there for the present are Fermoy, Poor, Patterson and Learned. Nixon and Glover were also intended for that post under my first plan, which was, that all the regiments, to be raised in those States by the resolve in September, should compose that army. But having by the advice of my officers direct∣ed the route of eight regiments from the latter to Peekskill, to wait till the designs of general Howe were unfolded, these two officers were to follow them. I did not partic∣ularize the brigadiers who were to go first, or the regiments;
<PB N="63" REF="029737_0401_0FE299E538295990"/>
but left the matter to major-general Heath, who was in∣structed in general terms to pursue such measures as seemed most likely to promote the service.</P>
<P>The colonels appointed to the New-Hampshire regiments I never knew. Those ordered to Ticonderoga from Mas∣sachusetts by general Heath, and who I presume have marched, were Bailey, Wesson, Jackson, Marshall, Brewer-Bradford and Francis. What proportions of their regi∣ments have marched, I cannot ascertain: but I am per∣suaded they were detached as fast as they were raised, and circumstances would admit. Francis's, the first of April, was returned five hundred strong; and, by a letter from colonel Marshall about the fifteenth of last month, he ex∣pected to march in a day or two with the last division of his regiment that was ready, which would make about four hundred, including those who had gone. The remainder (about sixty) were to follow with the proper officers as soon as they were fit—they having been inoculated.</P>
<P>I have written to generals M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal and Clinton to have the provision removed from Derby, &amp;c. and directed that they should point out proper places for its reception in Ulster; also that small works and guards of militia will be essential for its protection. * * *</P>
<P>The damage we sustained at Danbury, nor the enemy's loss, have not been transmitted with any accuracy: but, from the latest accounts from thence, the former was not so great, and the latter more considerable, than was appre∣hended at first.</P>
<P>I congratulate Congress upon the fortunate arrival of the Amphitrite with military and ordnance stores:—it is an important event. That of the French ship at Boston, and of the sloop from Martinique, added to the capture of the two provision ships, are to be regarded as interesting too. I would here take the liberty to mention that I think all the military and ordnance stores should be moved without a moment's delay to Springfield or some interior part of the country. Springfield should be the place, because the elab∣oratory is there, and they will be more convenient to use as exigences require. In their present situation their se∣curity is questionable; and, if an attack should be made in the eastern quarter, their loss is much to be apprehended.
<PB N="64" REF="029737_0402_0FE24B7FD6694248"/>
Before I quit this subject, I would beg leave to observe also that the disposal and direction of military stores should be only with one body or with one person. At present this power is exercised through so many channels, that much confusion is introduced; and it cannot be avoided: nor will it be possible that matters in this line should be con∣ducted with any degree of propriety, unless Congress come into some regulations respecting them. The inclosed ex∣tract of a letter from general Heath will prove the expedi∣ency. Many other instances might be mentioned, were it necessary.</P>
<P>The desertions from ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> army of late have been very considerable. General Howe's proclamation, and the bounty allowed to those who carry in their arms, have had an unhappy influence on too many of the soldiery: in a particular manner on those who are not natives. * * *</P>
<P>I could wish some means could be devised to cause more frequent desertions of <HI>[the enemy's]</HI> troops. Congress may think of some expedient: a larger bounty might have some effect, and money to the foreigners in lieu of land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The bounty given by general Howe to those who carry in arms, is sixteen dollars as we are told, though his proclama∣tion only expresses that they shall have the full value.

<P>I WAS this morning honoured with your letter of the third instant, with its inclosures. General Arnold's pro∣motion gives me much pleasure. He has certainly discov∣ered, in every instance where he has had an opportunity, much bravery, activity and enterprise. But what will be done about his rank?—He will not act most probably un∣der those he commanded but a few weeks ago.</P>
<P>I trust the appointment of Mr. Ludwick as superintend∣ant of bakers will have the salutary consequences you men∣tion: I have been long assured that many abuses have been
<PB N="65" REF="029737_0403_0FE299E6BA851828"/>
committed for want of some proper regulations in that de∣partment.</P>
<P>By major Troop, one of general Gates's aides, and who left Albany on Tuesday last, I am informed the accounts of general Carleton's approach towards Ticonderoga were premature. He says general Gates received a letter before he came away, from brigadier-general Wayne, of the twen∣ty-fourth ultimo, in which he mentioned nothing of it;—that three thousand troops had arrived there, all in high spirits and health, except nine;—and that that post could never be carried without the loss of much blood. The proceedings of Congress and your letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo were the first and only information I had of Mr. Carleton's being on the lake, having heard nothing upon the subject from general Gates or any other person.</P>
<P>In my last I mentioned that sixteen dollars bounty were given by general Howe to deserters with arms. I have reason to believe from information received since, and which seems to be generally credited, that he has advanced the bounty to twenty-four dollars.</P>
<P>It is much to be wished that our printers were more dis∣creet in many of their publications. We see, almost in ev∣ery paper, proclamations or accounts transmitted by the en∣emy, of an injurious nature. If some hint or caution could be given them on the subject, it might be of material service.</P>
<P>By a person who has just arrived here, it is reported that general Wooster is dead of his wounds.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congress that in a day or two our military chest will be exhausted. I beg that a supply may be forwarded as soon as possible: if there should be a fai∣lure, we shall have many things to apprehend.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered you by colonel Conway▪ an Irish gentleman in the service of France, who came pas∣senger in the Amphitrite, and was introduced to me yes∣terday, by a letter from Mr. Deane and one from general Heath, copies of which are transmitted.</P>
<P>This gentleman waits on Congress to obtain an ap∣pointment in the army of the States, and, from Mr. Deane's recommendation, is an officer of merit. He says no par∣ticular command was agreed on between him and Mr. Deane; nor does he wish otherwise than that Congress should exercise their own discretion: at the same time he observes that it will be mortifying to him to hold a rank under that of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssieurs De Fermoy and De Borre, who were inferior officers in their own service, and subject to his command. He can give the character of several of the officers who were passengers with him.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to speak of colonel Conway's merits or abilities, of my own knowledge, having had but little opportunity to be acquainted with him. From what I can discover, he appears to be a man of candour: and if he has been in service as long as he says he has, I should suppose him infinitely better qualified to serve us, than many who have been promoted, as he speaks our language. He seems extremely anxious to return to camp, as the campaign may be expected to become active every day; and wishes Congress to determine whatever command they may think proper to honour him with, as soon as they shall think it expedient.</P>

<P>THE inclosed is copy of a letter which was hand∣ed to me by monsieur Mottin de la Balme, from Silas Deane, esquire. For a more particular account of his merit and services, I must refer you to himself. I have sounded him as to his expectations, and find that nothing under a lieutenant-colonelcy of horse will content him.
<PB N="67" REF="029737_0405_0FE299F18DA3ED98"/>
If you should, from his own account, or from what you can collect from others, think proper to confer this rank upon him, there is no vacancy in any other corps except that of colonel Sheldon.</P>
<P>I am afraid we shall never be able to find places va∣cant, equal to the expectations of the French gentlemen who are now here, much less for those that will follow. The high rank conferred upon those who first came over, many of whom had no pretensions either from their ser∣vices or meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, has naturally raised the expectations of those who come properly recommended, to such a pitch, that I know not what will satisfy them. Indeed it is not to be imagined that a gentleman and an old soldier can submit to be commanded by a person in this country, whom he remembers to have been his inferior in France. I know not how we can remedy this evil, or put a stop to the growth of it, but by being very circumspect for the future, on whom we confer rank above that of a subaltern.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the fifth instant nothing material has occurred.</P>
<P>Inclosed you will be pleased to receive a general return of our forces in Jersey, the sixth instant, which is the first I have been able to obtain with any degree of accuracy.</P>
<P>I have not heard from general De Haas since his pro∣motion. As soon as I was informed of it, I wrote and requested him to repair to camp: but, having received no answer, I am apprehensive my letter miscarried. I wish Congress to give him notice of his appointment, and direc∣tions to join the army, if he accepts his commission and is not prevented by indisposition.</P>
<P>Through the board of war I have been favoured with a copy of general Gates's letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo. Hudson's-river and the passes in the Highlands I always considered as objects of great importance, and accordingly have provided for their security in the best manner my judg∣ment could direct, and the circumstances of the army admit.
<PB N="68" REF="029737_0406_0FE299988C044F28"/>
If they are less secure than we wish them to be, it is owing to our inability, and not to inattention. I have written to general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal, and will do it again, to employ much of his care upon this subject. War, in theory, and the modes of defence, are obvious and easy; but, in practice, they are more difficult. Unhappily for us, the means in our power do not always accord with our wishes or what would be our interest to pursue.</P>
<P>As yet none of the eastern troops have passed the North-river, except two small detachments from Connecticut and Rhode-Island, amounting to about two hundred and seven∣ty, which missed my orders till they had got over. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I shall send back after we are more reinforced, unless the movements of the enemy in this quarter make their detention necessary. The rest of the eastern troops which have marched (except the seven regiments from Massachusetts and three from New-Hampshire, ordered immediately to Ticonderoga) are at and on their way to Peekskill, as mentioned in my letter of the third—where they are to remain with all the York troops except Vanschaick's and Gansevoort's now at the northward, till general Howe's designs and intended operations are better understood. This disposition appearing to me and my general officers the best that could be made in our state of uncertainty, was adopted. The two troops of horse, recommended by Congress to be sent to general Gates, shall go as soon as circumstances will admit. At present we have not more than are constantly employed at the different posts.</P>
<P>General Heath, in a letter of the thirtieth ultimo, mentions that the military chest at the eastward is exhaust∣ed, and that a supply will be wanted much to defray the expenses which will arise on the removal of the military and ordnance stores to Springfield. He says Mr. Han∣cock was to write upon the subject, and requested I would also mention it to Congress in my first letter.</P>
<P>Accounts have been frequently exhibited of late by the officers, respecting subsistence whilst recruiting and on their march. As I do not recollect the provision Congress have made in such cases, I wish to be informed, and to be fa∣voured with a copy of their several resolves upon the subject.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered you by general Arnold, who arrived here to-day in his way to Philadelphia. He seems to be anxious to settle his public accounts which are of considerable amount, and waits on Congress, hoping they will appoint a committee of their body, or of such gentle∣men as they shall judge proper, to take the matter into con∣sideration. This he considers the more necessary, as he has heard some reports have been propagated, injurious to his character as a man of integrity. If any such aspersions lie against him, it is but reasonable that he should have an opportunity of vindicating himself and evincing his inno∣cence.</P>
<P>I find he does not consider the promotion Congress have been pleased to confer upon him sufficient to obviate the neglect arising from their having omitted him in their late appointments of major-generals. He observes it does not give him the rank he had a claim to from seniority in the line of brigadiers, and that he is subject to be commanded by those who had been inferior to him. He further adds, that Congress, in their last resolve respecting him, have ac∣knowledged him competent to the station of major-general, and therefore have done away every objection implied by their former omission. These considerations are not with∣out their weight, though I pretend not to judge what mo∣tives may have influenced the conduct of Congress upon this occasion. It is needless to say any thing of this gen∣tleman's military character: it is universally known that he has always distinguished himself as a judicious, brave officer, of great activity, enterprise and perseverance.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honoured with your letter of the tenth instant, accompanied by the proceedings of Con∣gress of the day before.</P>
<P>The conduct of two many officers in withholding the pay of their soldiers, I am persuaded, is reprehensible, and has been the cause of uneasiness and of many desertions. Every measure in my power will be exerted to prevent such abuses in future, and every aid given to punish the offenders in an exemplary manner. But Congress will excuse me when I tell them it will be impossible to com∣ply with their recommendation upon this subject, unless the general officers withdraw their attention from matters of the utmost importance, and such as require their con∣stant care. Were this not the case, the dispersed situation of the officers at this time through the different States on the recruiting service would prohibit the inquiry. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do I apprehend the regulations empowering and enjoin∣ing the regimental pay-masters to bring them to an account will be found competent to the end. Such officers will be proper to state the accounts in the first instance, and to receive vouchers, &amp;c. but will not do to settle them final∣ly, as their connexions with the regiments will subject them much to the influence of the officers.</P>
<P>I should suppose, if two or three gentlemen of integrity and of ability in accounts, were appointed auditors to at∣tend the army till the business is finished, it would be the best expedient that could be fallen on. They would be a check on the pay-masters, and, I am persuaded, will be the means of the accounts being fairly and justly liquidated. If a settlement can be once obtained, I trust the same con∣fusion will never take place again, as the pay-masters will receive and pay all money due to the regiments, and ac∣count for it, and as the army is on a more permanent footing than it ever was before: for this, like most other inconveniences and difficulties which we have experienced, is to be imputed in a great measure to short enlistments and the frequent dissolution of our troops.</P>
<P>A return of the army in Jersey, as late as the sixth in∣stant, I transmitted yesterday morning in a letter by Mr.
<PB N="71" REF="029737_0409_0FE299F49847D200"/>
Randolph of Chesnut-street, which you will probably re∣ceive to-day, and from which Congress will be able to determine the expediency of calling out the militia from Delaware and Pennsylvania. Though it gives me pain that we should be under the necessity of recurring to such a measure, yet I should suppose it to be adviseable. Our army is weak, and by no means equal to that of the ene∣my; and, till their designs are known and we are more reinforced with regular troops, we should be prepared in the best manner we can. I would observe, if the militia are called out, it should be for a fixed determinate time: for, though they will certainly return when that expires, yet that is more tolerable than for them to go off in par∣ties every day, as their whim and caprice suggest,—which has always been the case when the time was not stated. I would also observe, if it is possible, they should be en∣gaged to march out of their States if ordered. If their service is located, they will move with great reluctance, if they do at all.</P>
<P>On Saturday a smart skirmish happened with a detach∣ment of our troops who attacked a number of the enemy near Piscatawa, in which our men behaved well, and oblig∣ed the enemy to give way twice (as reported to me) with loss. The enemy receiving a strong reinforcement, our people retreated to their post. I cannot give the particu∣lars, as they have not been sufficiently ascertained. Their piquets were also attacked yesterday by some of our parties from Boundbrook, and forced within their lines.</P>

I fear it will be hardly possible to satisfy the views and claims of some of the French gentlemen. The late pro∣motion of monsieur Malmady, though highly honourable, and such as should be considered fully if not more than adequate to his pretensions taken upon any principle, does not come up to his demands. He arrived here yesterday morning, and has been writing to me upon the subject. From the high marks of distinction but too readily con∣ferred upon these men in many instances, they seem to have lost sight of what is just and reasonable. It would have been happy for us, particularly for me and for the gentlemen themselves, if a too easy grant of favours had not induced them to contemn all rank in our army under that of field-officers:—nor is it in my power to give com∣mands to every appointment. I shall inform monsieur Armand (and reconcile him to it in the best manner I can) that there is no vacancy for him at present: and I would beg leave to suggest, that, where promotions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made in future from political and honourary motives, it would be well for Congress to explain to the gentlemen that it may be some time before they can be put in actual command. This might prevent their entertaining sus∣picions of neglect on my part, which the situation of the army will not allow me to obviate. There is no vaca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> for monsieur Malmady, of the rank he now holds, unl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the merits of many other officers, who have served with reputation and much longer here, are to be overlooked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make way for him. Such a measure will neither be prac∣ticable, nor prudent to attempt.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heard who is at Pompton, I am informed that colonels Barton and Buskirk with three hundred tory levies from Bergen, on the morning of the thirteenth, attempted to surprise and cut off about seventy of his militia stationed at Pyramus. The officer happily had notice of their design, and eluded it by moving his post. It happened that the morning was foggy; and the enemy entering at different places, their parties engaged. General Heard says their loss could not be ascertained: but, from the reports of the inhabitants, ten of their men were killed and carried away at one time, and several wounded.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform Congress, that, immediately after the receipt of their resolve of the twenty-sixth of March, recommending the office of adjutant-general to be filled by the appointment of a person of abilities and unsus∣pected attachment to our cause, I wrote to colonel Timo∣thy Pickering of Salem, offering him the post in the first instance, and transmitting at the same time a letter for col∣onel William Lee, whom Congress had been pleased to mention, to be delivered him in case my offer could not be accepted. This conduct, in preference of colonel Picker∣ing, I was induced to adopt from the high character I had of him, both as a great military genius cultivated by an in∣dustrious attention to the study of war, and as a gentleman of liberal education, distinguished zeal, and great method and activity in business. This character of him I had from gentlemen of distinction and merit, and on whose judgment I could rely.</P>
<P>When my letter reached colonel Pickering, at first view he thought his situation in respect to public affairs would not permit him to accept the post. That for colonel Lee he sent immediately to him, who, in consequence of it, re∣paired to head-quarters. By colonel Lee I received a let∣ter from colonel Pickering, stating more particularly the
<PB N="74" REF="029737_0412_0FE299A6D14088D0"/>
causes which prevented him accepting the office when it was offered, and assuring me that he would in a little time ac∣commodate his affairs in such a manner as to come into any military post in which he might be serviceable, and thought equal to.</P>
<P>Here I am to mark with peculiar satisfaction, in justice to colonel Lee who has deservedly acquired the reputation of a good officer, that he expressed a distrust of his abilities to fill the appointment intended for him; and, on hearing that colonel Pickering would accept it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not only offered but wished to relinquish his claim to it in favour of him, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e declared he considered, from a very intimate and friendly acquaintance, as a first military character; and that he knew no gentleman better or so well qualified for the post among us. Matters being thus circumstanced, and colonel Lee pleased with the command he was in, I wrote to colonel Pickering on his return, who accepted the office, and is daily expected.</P>
<P>In this business I beg Congress to be assured, though col∣onel Lee was postponed in the first instance, their recom∣mendation had its due weight; and that no motive, other than a regard to the service, induced me to prefer colonel Pickering. His acknowledged abilities and equal zeal—without derogating from the merits of colonel Lee who holds a high place in my esteem—gave him a preference; and I flatter myself the cause will be promoted in his ap∣pointment, especially as we shall have two good officers in lieu of one, who, I am persuaded, will do honour to themselves in the line in which they move.</P>
<P>Considering the passes through the Highlands of the ut∣most importance to secure, I sent generals Greene and Knox about a fortnight ago to see what had been done for their defence, and to consult with the general officers they should meet, upon such further measures as might be deem∣ed necessary for their greater safety. The inclosed copy of their report will fully convey their sentiments upon the sub∣ject; to which I beg leave to refer Congress. I have sent general Putnam to command in that quarter, and have in∣structed him to use every possible means in his power for expediting and effecting the works and obstructions men∣tioned in the report. Fearing that the cables might not
<PB N="75" REF="029737_0413_0FE299FE9FC70668"/>
be procured in time, I have directed his particular and im∣mediate attention to fixing the boom. However, as the cables would render that more secure, and will be extreme∣ly serviceable in the opinion of the officers—if they are to be had in Philadelphia, I would advise Congress to order them to be purchased and forwarded without loss of time: they cannot be got elsewhere. They must be proportioned to the width of the river, which is about five hundred and forty yards; and, as they will be of most use if diagonally laid, the gentlemen think they should not be less than four hundred and fifty fathoms long, and of the largest size that can be had. Unless they are large and substantial, they will answer no purpose, and will not sustain their weight when stretched.</P>
<P>I should be glad to know whether it be the intention of Congress that one of the already-appointed general officers may be assigned to the command of the light-horse, or wheth∣er they have in contemplation the appointing of one for this purpose: if the first, I shall immediately name one to that duty; if the second, they will be pleased to choose one, as it is time we should have our arrangements complete.</P>
<P>I have nothing of importance to communicate, unless it is that seventeen ships are said to have arrived at New-York on the twenty-second, and that others were in the offing. A report has also prevailed, and has come through two or three channels, that governor Tryon (that was) is dead of the wound he received in the Danbury expedition: and one account is that lieutenant-colonel Walcot fell in the engage∣ment at Ridgefield. I do not know how far the facts are to be depended on:—it seems certain that Mr. Tryon was wounded.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclosed is a copy of a letter received yesterday from general Howe. Congress will perceive, by referring to the copy of his letter of the twenty-first of April trans∣mitted in mine of the twenty-sixth, that he persevered in his demand for an equal number of prisoners to be returned for those sent out by him; which has been the subject of con∣troversy between us. As general Howe has called upon me again for my final decision upon the subject, and Con∣gress are fully possessed of it, having received transcripts of every paper respecting it▪ I wish them to take the matter un∣der their earliest consideration, and to inform me as soon as they can, whether the grounds on which it has been con∣ducted by me are agreeable to their ideas, and whether my objections are or are not to be departed from. The affair is particularly stated in my letter of the ninth ultimo to gen∣eral Howe, in answer to the paper addressed to me by lieu∣tenant-colonel Walcot; copies of which were inclosed in my letter to the president on the tenth of the same month. The dispute, so far as general Lee is concerned, rests at present on their declaring him exchangeable, as other prison∣ers are, on the principle of equality of rank; to ensure which, or his safety, lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Hessian field-officers are detained. The other objection to returning their prisoners is, that a great proportion of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se sent out by them were not fit subjects of exchange when re∣leased, and were made so by the severity of their treatment and confinement, and therefore a deduction should be made, from the list.</P>
<P>Good faith seems to require that we should return as ma∣ny of theirs at least as we received effectives from them—I mean such as could be considered capable of being ex∣changed; and perhaps sound policy, that the agreement subsisting for exchanges should continue. On the other hand it may be said, that our prisoners in general, in the enemy's hands at present, will have greater security by our retaining them, and that general Howe will be less apt to relinquish any part of his claim, the more the number in our hands is diminished by an exchange.</P>
<P>I confess I am under great difficulty in this business. But what is more particularly the cause of this application
<PB N="77" REF="029737_0415_0FE29A019027BA18"/>
is the latter part of the first paragraph of the inclosed copy.—<HI>"and for your determination respecting the prisoners now here, that I may make my arrangements accordingly."</HI> This is couched in terms of great ambiguity; and I am really at a loss what interpretation to give it,—whether he in∣tends that his conduct respecting them shall be as I advise (this appears more favourable than can well be expected) or that, if the previous demand is not answered in a satis∣factory manner, he shall consider them on a different foot∣ing from that on which our former prisoners were, and the agreement totally dissolved. We are told government of∣fered the prisoners they took to the India company, and they have procured an act dispensing with that of the habeas-corpus in particular cases of persons supposed inimical to them, &amp;c. How far they or their commanders may adopt these measures, remains to be known: I have only mentioned them as they respect the general subject of my letter.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding my recommendation agreeable to what I conceived to be the sense of Congress, lieutenant-colonel Campbell's treatment continues to be such as cannot be jus∣tified either on the principles of generosity, or strict retal∣iation; as I have authentic information, and I doubt not you will have the same, that general Lee's situation is far from being rigorous or uncomfortable: except his not be∣ing permitted to go at large on parole, he has reason to be content with every other circumstance of his treatment.</P>
<P>I am just moving to Boundbrook, from whence I return∣ed yesterday morning. On Monday morning a body of the enemy advanced near that post. They retreated, on seeing a detachment march to meet them. There was some firing at long shot, but without any great damage. We had only three men slightly wounded. What their loss was, I know not: three of their light-horse were killed. By advices from the eastward, the troops are coming from Rhode-Island.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did myself the honour to write to you the twenty-ninth, I have received the inclosed intelligence. As it comes from a person of veracity, and one who is much in the confidence of the enemy, I have no doubt as to the fact of the two brigades having come over from New-York to Amboy, and also that a number of waggons have been brought from Staten and Long-Island▪ These accounts are corroborated by information of the same kind from several different quarters. But I do not place so much dependence upon the account of the intended attack upon this place, because I think, if such a matter was really in agitation, it would be kept a profound secret; I rather am opinion that it is thrown out to deceive. But at any rate, taking it for granted that they are assembling their troops and carriages, what can they have in view but a move, either immediately, or when their reinforcement (if they get any) arrives? and if they do move, I can see no other object but Philadelphia. It is true they have seemed for some time past to have laid aside all thoughts of attempting that city by land: but if they had only the attacking this army in contemplation, they would never encumber themselves with a large train of waggons, which,
<PB N="79" REF="029737_0417_0FE29A03187E37C8"/>
if they were successful, would retard them in their pur∣suit, and, if defeated, would be in danger of falling into our hands.</P>
<P>I inclose you an extract of a letter which I received from general Sullivan. If the two India ships which have been cut down are gone out to sea, I should suppose they are intended for the Delaware, because they are not capa∣ble of performing a rough or long voyage. This, if true, looks if a sudden corresponding move by land was in∣tended; for they will never send their ships long before their troops.</P>
<P>These, you will please to observe, are mere conjectures upon circumstances: for the actions of the enemy have for a long time past been so different from appearances, that I hardly dare to form an opinion. But I would wish to profit by every piece of intelligence, and be prepared to ward off every danger that threatens. I would therefore recommend that the Pennsylvania militia, who are assem∣bled at Bristol for the express purpose of guarding the riv∣er and opposing the passage of the enemy, should be put under the command of a good general officer, who would see that they are kept to their duty, and prepared for a sud∣den emergency. Except this is done, they may as well be at home.</P>
<P>I last night received a letter from general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal, an extract of which you have inclosed. By this it appears that a reinforcement is arrived, but whether from Canada or Europe, is uncertain. You will observe that he likewise mentions, that eight transports with foot, and a schooner with horses and hay, had fallen down. We can only form conjectures at present of the place of their destination: but if they stand southward, Philadelphia is the most probable place.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to communicate a very agreeable piece of intelligence which I have received from general Parsons, of the destruction of twelve of the enemy's vessels in Sag-harbour upon the east end of Long-Island. I give you his letter at length, which I think reflects high honour upon the conduct and bravery of colonel Meigs, his officers, and men.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Coudray is just arrived at camp, and proposes to set out to-morrow for Philadelphia. What his views are, I am uncertain, having had no conversation with him upon the subject: but I find an idea prevails that there is an agreement between Mr. Deane and him, that he shall have the chief command of the artillery. How well found∣ed this opinion may be, I cannot determine: but if it be true, it may involve the most injurious consequences. Gen∣eral Knox, who has deservedly acquired the character of one of the most valuable officers in the service, and who, combat∣ing almost innumerable difficulties in the department he fills, has placed the artillery upon a footing that does him the greatest honour—he, I am persuaded, would consider him∣self injured by an appointment superseding his command, and would not think himself at liberty to continue in the service. Should such an event take place in the present state of things, there would be too much reason to appre∣hend a train of ills, such as might convulse and unhinge this important department.</P>
<P>Supposing monsieur Coudray to have made such an agreement, the case is of great difficulty, and, in my opin∣ion, is worthy of the most delicate consideration of Con∣gress. Yet may not means be still devised to satisfy this gentleman by appointing him to some command not derog∣atory to his promised rank, and which will be agreeable to him? From the recommendations we have had of him, I am obliged to esteem him of high character, and of great knowledge in what he professes: and, from this consider∣ation and the manner in which he is mentioned to us, it ap∣pears that much address and delicacy must be used, to con∣ciliate matters.</P>
<P>Many reasons, besides those I have noted, might be assigned for continuing general Knox first in command in this department, which, on reflection, will readily occur. I would only observe, without insinuating the most dis∣tant shadow of distrust of monsieur Coudray's honour, candour, or integrity, that, on the general maxims of prudence and policy, it may be questioned with much pro∣priety whether so important a command as that of the ar∣tillery
<PB N="81" REF="029737_0419_0FE29A049D302718"/>
should be vested in any but a native, or one attach∣ed by the ties of interest to these States.</P>

<P>THE inclosed copies of generals Gates and Poor's letters, which just now came to hand, contain the latest advices from the northern army.

I wish our accounts from that quar∣ter may be happy, if Mr. Carleton makes an attack. The shameful deficiency in all our armies affords but too just grounds for disagreeable apprehensions: if the quotas as∣signed the different States are not immediately filled, we shall have every thing to fear. We shall never be able to resist their force, if the militia are to be relied on; nor do I know whether their aid, feeble and ineffectual as it is, is much to be expected. Can no expedients be devised to complete the regiments, and to rouse our unthinking countrymen from their lethargy?—If there can, the situ∣ation of our affairs calls loudly for it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD take the liberty of addressing a few lines to Congress on a matter which appears to me of im∣portance,
<PB N="82" REF="029737_0420_0FE299AB9F1B7870"/>
and which is considered in the same light by many of our officers, and others not in the military line. The subject I allude to is the condition of many persons now with the enemy, who, deluded by their arts and a misguided attachment to their measures, fled from the pro∣tection of the States, to find security with them, and who in many instances, are in arms against us.</P>
<P>It has been suggested through various channels,—and the suggestion seems to be credited, especially as some have already escaped,—that many of these unhappy people, con∣vinced of their error and the wicked part they have takes, would embrace the earliest opportunity of leaving the ene∣my and returning among us, were they sure of being re∣ceived into our friendship again, and of enjoying their prop∣erty and the rights of citizens.</P>
<P>This subject, in the consideration of it, strikes me as important, interesting, and delicate,—involving many con∣sequences worthy of mature deliberation and attention. As such,—and deeming myself incompetent to it,—I think it my duty to submit it to Congress for their dis∣cussion, to take such measures therein as they shall esteem necessary and right.</P>
<P>If these people, particularly those in arms, are ingeni∣ous in what has been hinted, and it is their wish, or that of any considerable part of them, to return,—I should sup∣pose that it would be expedient, and founded in found policy, to give every suitable assurance to induce them to come. Such an event would be attended with salutary ef∣fects, would weaken the enemy, distress them greatly, and would probably have a most happy influence in preventing others from joining their arms. On the other hand, the indulgence may be liable to great abuse, supposing it not to be duly guarded: or if the effects produced by it should be partial, they will not be adequate to the ends in view. Yet, as the enemy on their part are using every device they are capable of, to seduce both soldiers and citizens from our service into theirs, and have succeeded but too well, it is generally thought in the military line that something should be attempted to counteract them. Whether Con∣gress will be of the same sentiment, and, if they should, what and how extensive the mode and indulgence ought to be, is entirely with them.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="029737_0421_0FE29A0F25059D88"/>
There is one difficulty that occurs to me, supposing the measure to be adopted. What line of discrimination can be drawn upon such an occasion, though circumstances should differ and seem to require it? While the poor, de∣luded, ignorant, duped by artifices and a thousand causes to lead them wrong, have a claim to their country's par∣don and indulgence, there are many of well-informed un∣derstanding, who, from their early-avowed hostile dispo∣sitions and inveterate disregard of her rights, and those who have taken a double and triple part, cannot have the same pretensions; whose only view in returning may be to serve their own sordid purposes, and the better to pro∣mote those plans they have steadily pursued.</P>
<P>One thing more I would observe, which is, that if Con∣gress judge an adoption of measures eligible on the subject of my letter, the sooner it is come into, the better, for the most obvious reasons; and the time allowed for those to return who wish the indulgence, should be fixed at a short period,—not longer, in my opinion, than till the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Left blank in the original.</NOTE> day of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Left blank in the original.</NOTE> next: otherwise they may avail themselves of the circumstance, and wait events to decide their choice. If any good consequences are produced, the means can be renewed and further extended.</P>
<P>Congress will be pleased to excuse me for thus freely com∣municating my sentiments, especially when I assure them that they are dictated by what I esteem my duty.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be, &amp;c. <SIGNED>G. W.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. The more I consider the subject of my letter, the more important and interesting it appears. I am in∣clined to think, if the measure proposed should be deemed expedient, that it will be better that the indulgencies and assurances for their return should be communicated through the medium of some second, secret hand, qualified to offer them and negociate the business, rather than by an act of public authority. Opportunities, I should suppose, may be found, by which they may obtain due information in that way, and which will not hold out to the enemy the same cause of suspicion and of vigilance to prevent their es∣caping. Whatever mode shall be considered most advise∣able, should be immediately adopted. What time should
<PB N="84" REF="029737_0422_0FE299B6DAB50940"/>
be allowed in the first instance, I am at a loss to deter∣mine: if the continuance is too short, there may be dan∣ger of their not being apprised so as to get off: if it is too long, they will defer matters to the last, and act then as circumstances of interest dictate. To err in the former will be least injurious.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS morning had the honour of your letter of the fifth, with its inclosures. The resolution of the thir∣tieth of May, respecting the French gentlemen who came passengers in the Amphitrite, reached camp before your letter, and has excited much uneasiness in the artillery corps. The inclosed copy of a letter from general Knox will convey their anxiety upon the subject,—which I think it necessary to transmit, as well from duty as on account of his request.</P>
<P>The difficulties upon this occasion arise from the pecu∣liar circumstances of most of the officers composing the artillery regiments at this time. I do not know, for my own part, what operation Congress precisely meant the resolution should have; but if the commissions which these gentlemen are to receive should give them rank from the date of those they had from the king of France, or from
<PB N="85" REF="029737_0423_0FE1BFADD29873C8"/>
their compact with Mr. Deane, there are but few officers now in the artillery who will not be superseded in their command, unless some method is adopted to prevent it. This, I am persuaded, Congress had not in contempla∣tion, because it is opposed to policy and to justice; and I am led to believe the resolution was come into for want of due information how matters were circumstanced in this instance.</P>
<P>The officers now in the artillery I am obliged to con∣sider of great merit: experience has proved them to be most warmly attached to the rights of their country; and their conduct in the line of their profession has been such as does the highest honour to themselves and the gentleman who immediately commands them. Without derogating in the least from the character of the French officers who are to be commissioned, and whom I wish to receive every countenance they merit, there is strong reason to doubt (laying aside every consideration of policy) whether they have seen as much real service as our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the course of two campaigns. It would be hard, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say unjust, that the latter should lose their command when they have a claim to every mark of favour, and after they have taken great pains to form their companies: the service requires that they should not; and I am convinced the event would be attended with the most fatal consequences.</P>
<P>But what is to be done? This is a case of difficulty, view it as you will. I am not for rejecting the French gentlemen:—far otherwise—I am for employing them: and public faith, and the encouragements given to bring them over, demand that it should be done. After much thought and consideration upon the subject, two modes oc∣cur to me, as the only possible ones by which it can be ef∣fected, and by which the inconveniences I have mentioned can be remedied. One is, that a new corps of artillery should be formed, and these gentlemen attached to it. This, we have reason to fear, cannot be done, from the difficulties we have experienced in raising men, and from their having no interest or connexions with the people. Their situation in such case, if they are men of sentiment and active dispositions, would be irksome and distressing. The other is, that our present officers now under consider∣ation
<PB N="86" REF="029737_0424_0FE299B85D790370"/>
should have their commissions antedated, to give them precedency of rank: and this may be done with the great∣er propriety, as most of them were intended to hold the posts they now sustain, before the French gentlemen had any claim upon us. It is true they were not commissioned, because the old corps existed under the first arrangement. Further it is said—and there is no doubt of the fact—that these gentlemen were promoted by brevet just before their departure from France, merely to give them rank here; antecedent to which, our officers were superior to them in this point; and these brevets only confer local <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nk, confined to the French-American colonies.</P>
<P>This latter m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de appears the most eligible: if it is adopt∣ed, they will be distributed through the corps as assistant officers. Their want of a knowledge in our language inca∣pacitates them for command in the first instance; and not only so, but to place them at the head of companies, over officers that have been at great trouble, pains and expense in raising the men, would be both unmilitary and unjust. I shall now quit the subject, wishing that whatever will best conciliate matters and advance the public good, may be done; suggesting at the same time, with all deference, as it is much easier to prevent evils than to remedy them after they have happened, it will be well, in all cases of foreign and indeed other applications, that the consequences, which granting them will involve, should be maturely weighed and taken in every point of view. In the present case of difficulty, things I am persuaded, might have been adjusted with the greatest facility, had the committee of foreign ap∣plications been fully possessed of all the circumstances re∣specting the artillery regiments.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Gates, of the second instant, transmitting a copy of one from general Poor, the enemy, who were at Split-Rock according to their last advices which I forwarded, have returned down the Lake. Cap∣tain Whitcomb had been sent out to reconnoitre, and re∣ported on his return that only one boat remained.</P>
<P>From sundry accounts from New-York, there is reason to believe the enemy are on the point of making some ex∣pedition. Their preparation of ships for troops, light-horse, &amp;c. indicates that they intend to go by water. What their
<PB N="87" REF="029737_0425_0FE29A126EA79A80"/>
object is, yet remains a secret. The inclosed copy of an examination is very particular, and as recent as any that I have received. The person who gave the information be∣longs to Cape-May county, and appeared to be a sensible intelligent lad. A deserter of the seventy-first this moment came in: you also have his examination inclosed.</P>

At present, as the regiments are greatly dispersed, part in one place and part in another, and accurate states of them have not been made, it will not be in my power to for∣ward it immediately. I shall here take occasion to mention that I communicated the resolution appointing a brigade∣chaplain in the place of all others, to the several brigadiers. They are all of opinion that it will be impossible for them to discharge the duty; that many inconveniences and much dissatisfaction will be the result; and that no establishment appears so good in this instance as the old one. Among many other weighty objections to the measure, it has been suggested that it has a tendency to introduce religious dis∣putes into the army, which, above all things, should be avoided,—and in many instances would compel men to a mode of worship which they do not profess. The old es∣tablishment gives every regiment an opportunity of having a chaplain of their own religious sentiments,—is founded on a plan of a more generous toleration,—and the choice of chaplains to officiate has been generally in the regiments. Supposing one chaplain could do the duties of a brigade,
<PB N="88" REF="029737_0426_0FE299B9F0E37CD8"/>
(which supposition however is inadmissible when we view things in practice) that being composed of four or five per∣haps, in some instances, six regiments, there might be so many different modes of worship. I have mentioned the opinion of the officers and these hints to Congress upon this subject, from a principle of duty, and because I am well assured it is most foreign to their wishes or intention to excite, by any act, the smallest uneasiness and jealousy among the troops.</P>
<P>There remains no room to believe otherwise than that the enemy are on the point of moving: this is confirmed by intelligence from all quarters, and through so many different channels, that we must consider it certain. Whether they will move by land or water, or by both, cannot be ascertain∣ed; nor is their destination precisely known: but every circumstance points out Philadelphia as their object. Be∣ing of this opinion, I have directed the return of general Mifflin. Before he left Philadelphia, I wrote, counter∣manding the order for his coming here; but he did not re∣ceive my letter. I would also mention to Congress that I think the military stores, lately arrived, and at or coming to Philadelphia, should be removed to a place of perfect se∣curity. Though I would not excite needless uneasy ap∣prehensions, prudence requires that things so essential should not be exposed to risk.</P>

<P>INCLOSED you will receive a copy of a letter from me to lord Cornwallis, on the inhuman treatment of lieu∣tenant Martin by a party of the enemy's horse. My re∣monstrance and sending his corpse produced nothing more than a short answer from his lordship, which you also have. It was thought unnecessary to view the body, the fact being admitted and justified.</P>
<P>I have also taken the liberty to inclose a copy of my letter to general Howe, in answer to his of the twenty-first of April, twenty-second of May, and fifth instant. From the latter part of the first paragraph in that of the twenty-second
<PB N="89" REF="029737_0427_0FE29A13F358BEB0"/>
of May, I was induced to propose an exchange of all the prisoners now in his hands, so far as it can be effected on the principles of the agreement subsisting between us, ex∣cept that of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Hessian field-officers who are to be retained till general Lee is de∣clared exchangeable. I did not expect the proposition would be acceded to: but, as his letter is of doubtful meaning in this instance, I thought it expedient to make the offer,—first, as it will be a happy event if we release our prisoners,—and secondly, as the proposition may draw from him an explanation of his sentiments, though he should re∣ject it.</P>
<P>The New-York paper of the ninth instant I transmit for your perusal: it contains an extract of a letter from gover∣nor Tryon to Christopher Billop of Long-Island. This extract, I think, is worthy of attention, and may be im∣proved to great advantage if published in the papers with such strictures and observations as it will well warrant, and as will occur to an ingenious pen. The enemy, on their part, use the most artful publications, and avail themselves of every thing they can, going from us. We should prof∣it, where we can, by their productions.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congress that several officers in the corps of cavalry have applied to me, to know in what point of view their horses are considered—whether as pub∣lic property, or as private belonging to themselves, to be fur∣nished at their own expense. When colonel Sheldon's regiment was ordered to be raised, the officers thought the horses should be a matter of public charge: but as it had never been determined, and I was not perfectly satisfied with the custom in such cases, I did not consider myself authorised to decide upon it. I promised to recommend it to the consideration of Congress; and this I have done since on similar occasions. The officers urge, that, as hors∣es are essential to the discharge of their duty, they should be provided at the public expense; that they have risen to such enormous prices, that, if the contrary is establish∣ed, they must, from the nature of the service, not only sink their pay, but make a large sacrifice of their private interest.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029737_0428_0FE299BB75598C08"/>
Though the practice may have been against their appli∣cation in other armies, yet their reasoning seems plausible and to be founded in justice. There are objections too against the measure, but not of sufficient validity, in my opinion, to oppose to their claim. Another reason may be suggested, why the public should find them horses; which is, that if they were to provide them themselves, the apprehension of losing them might prevent a proper discharge of duty, and in some cases produce too great a degree of cautious prudence.</P>
<P>This matter I have thought it necessary to lay before Congress, not doubting but it will have that attention which it may seem to deserve. There is one thing more I would add upon the subject, which is, if their application is considered just, I should suppose it best to fix a certain determinate sum to be allowed for the horses they have brought and may have occasion to purchase, in preference to leaving it to their discretion and judgment.</P>
<P>It being evident, so far as we can reason from circum∣stances and appearances, that general Howe designs Phil∣adelphia to be the first object of his pursuits, or the defeat of this army; and, for one or both of these purposes, is collecting nearly his whole force at Brunswic,—a board of general officers determined yesterday evening after ma∣ture deliberation, that all the continental troops at Peeks∣kill and its dependencies, except one thousand effectives, should be immediately marched to reinforce this army. That number, with the convalescents and such aids of mi∣litia as are now and may be assembled in case of emergen∣cy, was deemed competent to the defence of those posts against any attempt that may be made to possess them in the present situation of things.</P>
<P>I have inclosed a general return shewing our whole strength in Jersey at this time, from which it will appear our circumstances in this respect are by no means so de∣sirable as could be wished. I esteem it my duty to trans∣mit information of this sort from time to time to Congress, and am encouraged the more to do it from a conviction that they, sensible of the necessity of the most profound secrecy, will not suffer the least intimation of our numbers to transpire.</P>

<HI>June</HI> 14.—Your favour of the thirteenth, with its in∣closures, was received last night.</P>
<P>Having proposed to general Howe an exchange of the prisoners now in his possession, as you will perceive by the inclosed copy of my letter, and also added, that <HI>"his con∣duct towards prisoners would govern mine,"</HI> it appears to me that it would be improper to transmit him a copy of your first resolution of the tenth instant, till we have some∣thing more from him on the subject proposed. I confess I did not, nor do I yet, understand the paragraph of his let∣ter of the twenty-second ultimo, to which I have alluded, and which induced me to propose an exchange if that was his wish, and to subjoin, that his conduct to our prisoners should govern mine,—as a caution to prevent him exercis∣ing severity or a new mode of treatment of them, contrary to the spirit of the agreement between us, and the ideas entertained upon the subject when it was first entered in∣to,—if such was his meaning.</P>
<P>Finding that there would be great difficulty in filling the battalions intended to be raised, I did not commission officers for all the sixteen additional ones: I apprehended such a measure would accumulate expense without increas∣ing our strength, and therefore did not set the whole on foot. I shall be happy, on governor Caswell's letter and your recommendation of colonel Shepard, that he should have a regiment: from the character given him, and the terms on which he offers his services, there can be no ob∣jection. Congress will be pleased to appoint him to the command they wish him to have; and I should think it adviseable that he be ordered to march with his corps to join this army, leaving proper officers to recruit the de∣ficiency.</P>
<P>I have perused monsieur De Coudray's opinion about the fortifications, and have no doubt but that it is well founded. I have not sufficient knowledge of them to pro∣nounce an opinion with certainty myself.</P>
<P>You will observe by the New-York paper the execution of * * *. His family well deserves the generous notice of Congress. He conducted himself with great fidelity to our cause, rendering <HI>[his country essential]</HI> services, and has fallen a sacrifice in promoting her interest. Perhaps
<PB N="92" REF="029737_0430_0FE299C5B2EF8918"/>
a public act of generosity (considering the character he was in) might not be so eligible as a private donation.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 15.—When I wrote yesterday, my information was that one division of the enemy was advancing on the Princeton road, and it was believed from the general movement of their army that they were proceeding towards Delaware. What their real design was, is not yet under∣stood. Those that advanced on that road, after marching some distance, filed off to the right, down Millstone-river, and joined the other column on the Coryel-ferry road leading by Somerset court-house. One object of their movement might be to inclose general Sullivan and his division between their two columns: another (which most probably was the principal cause, if they did not mean to proceed to Delaware when they set out) to manoeuvre us out of our present encampment into action upon disadvan∣tageous terms. The first they could not hope to succeed in after general Sullivan changed his post to Rocky-Hill; an event which took place only the evening before, and which it is presumed they were not well advised of when they left Brunswic. A considerable body of them remain at Somerset court-house, and on the communication be∣tween that and Brunswic. We have been and are harras∣sing them with light troops: but they being in open ground with a large train of artillery, we cannot do it so effectually as could be wished.</P>
<P>I shall be glad to be informed whether general De Haas considers himself an officer in the army. He has never joined it since his promotion, or written a single line to me upon the subject. If he accepts his commission, it will be well for Congress to order him to repair to the army immediately. The brigade intended for him is without a general officer, and has brought on a disagreea∣ble dispute between two of the colonels, each claiming the command. This is not the only inconvenience:—officers of high rank remaining at home, afford a bad example to others who are inferior, and grounds of application for the like indulgence.</P>
<P>This letter, except the paragraphs of this date, I in∣tended to send yesterday, but was prevented by the move∣ment of the enemy which rendered it unadviseable.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour of addressing you last, I informed you that the main body of the enemy had march∣ed from Brunswic, and extended their van as far as Som∣erset court-house. I am now to acquaint you, that, after encamping between these two posts and beginning a line of redoubts, they changed their ground yesterday morning and in the course of the preceding night, and returned to Bruns∣wic again, burning, as they went, several valuable dwelling houses. We had constantly light troops hovering round them as far as circumstances would permit: but, being se∣cured on their flanks by the Rariton and Millstone, they were difficult to approach; and, without loss, effected their return to their former posts. This sudden and precipitate change in their operations has afforded matter for much spec∣ulation. We suppose their original design was to attempt an impression on our right, or to manoeuvre us out of our ground, or to advance towards the Delaware. Whether these con∣jectures were well founded, cannot be ascertained: but it is probable, if they had an impression in view, they found
<PB N="94" REF="029737_0432_0FE299C73758A7C8"/>
it could not be attempted without great loss—(as to bring∣ing on an attack, they effectually secured themselves against one by the post they took)—or if passing the Delaware was their object, that, from the temper of the people, the prosecution of it (if not impracticable) would meet with much greater opposition than what they expected: for I must observe—and with peculiar satisfaction I do it—that, on the first notice of the enemy's movements, the militia assembled in the most spirited manner, firmly determined to give them every annoyance in their power, and to afford us every possible aid. This I thought it my duty to men∣tion in justice to their conduct; and I am inclined to be∣lieve that general Howe's return, thus suddenly made, must have been in consequence of the information he received that the people were in and flying to arms in every quarter to oppose him. I shall not reason upon this event: but I cannot but consider it as a most fortunate and happy one to us, and the most distressing Mr. Howe has yet experi∣enced, unless he has schemes in contemplation beyond the reach of my conjecture.</P>
<P>I should have written to Congress more frequently re∣specting the enemy after they came from Brunswic, had I not been almost constantly on horse-back, and had their designs been clear: but as they were not, I did not wish to puzzle them with conjectures, more especially as I wrote general Arnold (with whom I was obliged to correspond, that he might co-operate with me as circumstances should require) to transmit them copies of my letters.</P>
<P>Inclosed you will be pleased to receive an extract of a letter from colonel Jackson of Boston to general Knox. The intelligence it contains is interesting; and I shall be happy to hear that the two brigs mentioned have captured the remainder of the Hessians, and more particularly so if the capture should not be far from the British coast, pro∣vided they arrive safe.</P>
<P><HI>Twelve o'clock.</HI>—I just now received a letter from gen∣eral Schuyler, a copy of which, and of its inclosures, is herewith transmitted. The enemy, from appearances, hav∣ing changed their views for the present, or at least ren∣dered them dark and mysterious, I have sent expresses to brigadiers M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal and Glover to halt their divisions, if
<PB N="95" REF="029737_0433_0FE29A22A79A2348"/>
they have proceeded any considerable distance from Peeks∣kill, till further orders—otherwise to return. I have also written to general Putnam to hold four regiments in readi∣ness to embark for general Schuyler's aid, should further intelligence from Canada respecting the enemy's move∣ments make it necessary. The uncertainty of general Howe's operations will not permit more to be done at this time. General Parsons arrived here this morning, and his division is marching to their ground towards the left of the lines.</P>
<P>I omitted to mention in my last, that, in consultation with my general officers, it was agreed that promotions should be regimental in the army for all officers under the rank of field officers,—and for all of that rank, in the line of their state. This is now settled as a general rule; a right being reserved however, that it may be made for par∣ticular merit out of this line, or refused for demerit or any substantial objection.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour and pleasure to inform you that the enemy evacuated Brunswic this morning and retired to Amboy, burning many houses as they went along.
<PB N="96" REF="029737_0434_0FE299C8BB3AC010"/>
Some of them, from the appearance of the flames, were considerable buildings.</P>
<P>From several pieces of information and from a variety of circumstances, it was evident that a movement was in agi∣tation, and it was the general opinion that it was intended this morning. I therefore detached three brigades under the command of major-general Greene to fall upon their rear, and kept the main body of the army paraded upon the heights, to support them if there should be occasion. A party of colonel Morgan's regiment of light-infantry at∣tacked and drove the Hessian piquet about sun-rise: and upon the appearance of general Wayne's brigade and Mor∣gan's regiment (who got first to the ground) opposite Bruns∣wic, the enemy immediately crossed the bridge to the east side of the river, and threw themselves into redoubts which they had before constructed. Our troops advanced briskly upon them; upon which they quitted the redoubts without making any opposition, and retired by the Amboy road.</P>
<P>As all our troops, from the difference of their stations in camp, had not come up when the enemy began to mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e off, it was impossible to check them, as their numbers were far greater than we had any reason to expect,—being, as we were informed afterwards, between four and five thou∣sand men. Our men pursued them as far as Piscatawa: but finding it impossible to overtake them, and fearing they might be led on too far from the main body, they returned to Brunswic.</P>
<P>By information of the inhabitants, general Howe, lord Cornwallis, and general Grant, were in the town when the alarm was first given: but they quitted it very soon after.</P>
<P>In the pursuit, colonel Morgan's riflemen exchanged several sharp fires with the enemy, which, it is imagined, did considerable execution. I am in hopes that they after∣wards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell in with general Maxwell, who was detached last night with a strong party, to lie between Brunswic and Amboy to intercept any convoys or parties that might be passing: but I have yet heard nothing from him.</P>
<P>General Greene desires me to make mention of the con∣duct and bravery of general Wayne and colonel Morgan, and of their officers and men, upon this occasion, as they constantly advanced upon an enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar superior to them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> numbers, and well secured behind strong redoubts.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="029737_0435_0FE29A242AEBF210"/>
General Sullivan advanced from Rocky-Hill to Bruns∣wic with his division; but, as he did not receive his order of march till very late at night, he did not arrive till the enemy had been gone some time.</P>
<P>I have sent down lord Stirling's division to reinforce general Maxwell; and in the morning I shall move the main body of the army to some secure post nearer Amboy, from whence we can with more case annoy the enemy than from this distance. I am inclined to think they mean to cross to Staten-Island: if they do, we may perhaps find an opportunity of making a stroke upon their rear: at any rate we shall have a chance of obliging them to make a total evacuation of the State of Jersey.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour to address you last, it was on the subject of the enemy's retreat from Brunswic to Am∣boy, and of the measures pursued to annoy them. At the time of writing, the information I had received respecting their loss was rather vague and uncertain: but we have rea∣son to believe, from intelligence through various channels since, that it was pretty considerable, and fell chiefly on the grenadiers and light-infantry, who formed their covering party. The inclosed copy of a letter, containing the in∣formation of a person just from New-York, corresponds with other accounts on this head, and with the declarations of some deserters. Some of the accounts are, that officers were heard to say they had not suffered so severely since the affair at Princeton.</P>
<P>After the evacuation of Brunswic, I determined, with the advice of my general officers, to move the whole army the next morning to this post, where they would be nearer the enemy, and might act according to circumstances. In this I was prevented by rain, and they only moved yesterday morning. I have advanced lord Stirling's division and some other troops lower down in the neighbourhood of Metuchin meeting-house, and intended to have posted more there; but found, on reconnoitring the ground, that it was low and
<PB N="98" REF="029737_0436_0FE299CA456C6998"/>
disadvantageous, and still more unfavourable through a scar∣city of water. These reasons, added to that of there not being the smallest prospect of attacking the enemy in Amboy with a probability of success—secured on their flanks by water, and in their front by strong redoubts across the Neck—would not permit me, either in my own opinion or that of my general officers, to keep any greater body of men in that quarter, where they would have been dispersed, and of consequence extremely insecure.</P>
<P>I have light parties lying close on the enemy's lines, to watch their motions, and who will be ready to act in con∣junction with lord Stirling's division and such other troops as it may be necessary to detach; though I think—and so do the rest of the officers—that no event is likely to take place that will require more, since the idea of forcing their lines, or bringing on a general engagement on their own ground, is universally held incompatible with our interest, and that that number is sufficient to avail us of any advan∣tages we can expect to arise from their retreating from Amboy, supposing notice of the fact should be obtained. Their contiguity to the Sound, and the small distance across it, (having boats prepared to pass in) will enable them to get off (should they so incline) against every prudent and justifiable exertion on our part. Whether such is their design, is more than I can positively determine: but there is every reason to believe that they have been and are trans∣porting their baggage to Staten-Island, and making every preparation to embark on board their transports for some new expedition.</P>
<P>Your favour of the twenty-fourth I just now received, and am extremely obliged by your cordial congratulations on the enemy's retreat from Brunswic, and favourable in∣terpretation of the event of my conduct. The resolution you did me the honour to transmit shall have my attention.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted, that an express sent off to general Maxwell on Saturday night, to inform him of gen∣eral Greene's movement towards Brunswic that he might conduct himself accordingly, did not reach him. Wheth∣er the express went designedly to the enemy, or was taken, is not known: but there is reason to believe he fell into their hands. If general Maxwell had received the order,
<PB N="99" REF="029737_0437_0FE29A2EE87D2C60"/>
there is no doubt but their whole rear-guard would have been cut off. This the enemy confessed themselves, as we are well informed by persons in Bonemtown.</P>
<P>By a reconnoitring party just returned, it is reported as a matter of doubt whether any of the enemy have removed from Amboy; though it is almost certain they have trans∣ported a great deal of their baggage.</P>

<P>ON Thursday morning general Howe advanced with his whole army in several columns, from Amboy, as far as Westfield. We are certainly informed that the troops sent to Staten-Island returned the preceding evening, and, it is said, with an augmentation of marines, so that carrying them there was a feint with intention to deceive us. His design in this sudden movement was either to bring on a general engagement upon disadvantageous terms, considering mat∣ters in any point of view—or to cut off our light parties, and lord Stirling's division which was sent down to sup∣port them—or to possess himself of the heights and passes in the mountains on our left. The two last seemed to be the first objects of his attention, as his march was rapid against these parties, and indicated a strong disposition to gain those passes.</P>
<P>In this situation of affairs it was thought absolutely nec∣essary that we should move our force from the low grounds, to occupy the heights before them; which was effected. As they advanced, they fell in with some of our light par∣ties and part of lord Stirling's division, with which they had some pretty smart skirmishing, with but very little loss I believe on our side, except in three field-pieces which un∣fortunately fell into the enemy's hands: but, not having obtained returns yet, I cannot determine it with certainty; nor can we ascertain what the enemy's loss was.</P>
<P>As soon as we had gained the passes, I detached a body of light troops under brigadier-general Scott, to hang on their flank, and to watch their motions; and ordered Mor∣gan's corps of riflemen to join him since. The enemy re∣mained
<PB N="100" REF="029737_0438_0FE29BAA2964CD40"/>
at Westfield till yesterday afternoon, when, about three o'clock, they moved towards Spanktown, with our light troops in their rear and pursuing. The enemy have plundered all before them, and, it is said, burned some houses.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not been able to ascertain yet with any degree of precision the loss sustained by the enemy in the several skirmishes on Thursday, though we have many reasons to believe it was much more considerable than what it was apprehended to be when I had the honour of addressing you upon the subject. The inclosed copy of a letter from lord Stirling contains the fullest and most par∣ticular information that I have received: and the accounts given by sundry inhabitants to persons who have been in the neighbourhood where the skirmishes were, and where the enemy were encamped, countenance this intelligence.</P>
<P>As to our loss, as reported by the enemy, I am persuad∣ed it is exaggerated beyond all bounds of truth or prob∣ability, being assured by lord Stirling that it was trifling—and by such deserters as have come in, that they saw but very few prisoners taken. It would have been certainly known before this, (that is, the number not yet returned) had not some of the parties, and I believe the most which were then out, joined the corps since detached.</P>
<P>In respect to the enemy's designs or intended move∣ments, they are not to be determined. It is certain they got into Amboy yesterday evening: and, from advices this morning from officers sent to South-Amboy to observe their motions, there were strong reasons to conclude they were evacuating the town, as their horse had gone over to Staten-Island, and as several boats were also passing with baggage, and others with troops. There were further cir∣cumstances favouring this opinion, such as apparent breach∣es in some of their lines: yet general Sullivan informs me, by a letter just new received, that, from all the intelligence

<P>P. S. <HI>June</HI> 30.—From intelligence received last night, the opinion that the enemy are evacuating Amboy seems to be more confirmed.</P>
<P>As the facts in lord Stirling's letter are rather taken up on report than from any certain knowledge of their having happened, I cannot consider them sufficiently authentic for publication; nor are they transmitted for that purpose, though I am well persuaded the enemy's loss was much more considerable than it was at first imagined to be. It has been reported to me to-day that the enemy took sixty∣four prisoners in the whole. Whether they were all of our army, or in part countrymen, I cannot decide; for, having detached at that time a number of light parties, and man, of them having fallen in with the corps ordered out since, returns could not be made with accuracy. The prisoners taken by us were thirteen, two of whom are light dragoons, the rest infantry. Generals Scott and Conway intended to move towards Amboy this morning: but it is probable the rain has prevented them.</P>

He wrote me, he should return this morning, and bring off whatever stores he may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind; though there is little reason to expect that they have left any thing valuable behind.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclosed copies of general St. Clair's letters, transmitted yesterday afternoon and last night by general Schuyler, I have thought it my duty to send you. The intelligence they contain is important and interesting; nor are there circumstances wanting besides these, to induce a belief, or at least to raise a strong presumption, that the enemy have in contemplation a junction of their two armies by way of the Lakes and the North-river. If they have their whole Canada force on the former, it is certainly their object.</P>
<P>On receiving these accounts, I wrote immediately to general Putnam to embark Nixon's brigade for reinforcing the northern army—to wait however the arrival or near approach of generals Parsons and Varnum's brigades from this place, who march this morning—or the coming in of an equal number of militia to supply their place before they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. This I have done by the advice of my general offi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, and is all that is thought practicable in the present un∣certain indeterminate situation of things. The rest of the army here will be held in readiness to move according to information and circumstances.</P>
<P>As I have observed, if we were certain general Burgoyne was approaching Ticonderoga with his whole army, I should not hesitate a moment in concluding that it is in consequence of a preconcerted plan with general Howe, and that the latter is to co-operate with him, by pushing his whole force up the North-river, and aiming a stroke in
<PB N="103" REF="029737_0441_0FE29A88850C9270"/>
the first instance and immediately against the Highland pass∣es. But as the appearance of the enemy on the Lake may be a feint, calculated to amuse and distract (though it may seem like a real attack) to draw this army to Peekskill and more to the northward, that general Howe may with more facility turn his arms against Philadelphia—it has been de∣termined unadviseable for us to move till we have further proofs of his intentions, and that our conduct must be gov∣erned by his.</P>
<P>Our situation is truly delicate and embarrassing. Should we march to Peekskill, leaving general Howe on Staten-Island, there will be nothing to prevent him passing to South Amboy, and pushing from thence to Philadelphia, or in short by any other route; though the marching such of his troops from the point opposite Amboy as were encamped there, and the sailing of the ships from Princess-bay yes∣terday morning, are circumstances indicating that an em∣barkation has or will take place. On the other hand, if the North-river and the possession of the Highlands are his objects, our remaining here till his views are certainly known may subject us to a risk that we wish to avoid.</P>
<P>Thus, let us examine matters as we will, difficulties stare us in the face. We shall attempt to consult, and to do the best we can. I have written to generals Putnam and George Clinton fully upon the subject, urging them to put forth every exertion in their power, and instantly to call in a respectable body of militia to aid in the defence of those important posts at this critical conjuncture. I trust they will come out; their services in all probability will not be wanted but for a very short time.</P>
<P>I must earnestly request that you will send Mr. Stew∣art, the issuing commissary-general, to camp immediately. There is reason to apprehend the army will be in great distress and confusion for want of issuing commissaries in three or four days. On Saturday, those with Mr. Trum∣ball declare they will leave him, without they are put on a different footing from what they now are. I need not mention the consequences that will result from such an event, if there are not others here to supply their places.</P>
<P>There is one thing more I would add, which is, that there is not more than forty thousand dollars in the milita∣ry
<PB N="104" REF="029737_0442_0FE1BFC974398D78"/>
chest, and two months' pay due to all the army, except two or three regiments which have just obtained warrants. A hundred and fifty-six thousand, out of the last supply sent the paymaster, I was obliged to order to Peekskill for the troops in that quarter, whose demands are great and pressing also. I must earnestly entreat that you will for∣ward a supply directly to the paymaster:—should we be obliged to move before the troops are paid, much uneasiness and murmuring will be the certain attendants, and, I fear, something worse.</P>
<P>As the enemy will adopt every stratagem and device to deceive and distract us,—notwithstanding the present ap∣pearance in favour of their making an expedition up the North-river, I doubt not but you will have the most vigi∣lant look-outs kept along Delaware-bay, and proper ex∣presses and signals for communicating the earliest intelligence. I think it would be highly expedient that some sensible judicious men should be employed in that business at this time, who would view things as they ought to be, and from whose accounts certain inferences and conclusions may be drawn, so as to form a proper line for our conduct. The most fatal consequences may flow from false information at this period: things should be examined with all possible certainty. I shall not be surprised to hear of several ships appearing in or off Delaware, though general Howe's des∣tination should be elsewhere. Their fleet give them the most signal advantages, and an opportunity of practising a thousand feints.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honoured with yours of the fifth, with sundry resolves of Congress to which I shall pay due attention.</P>
<P>No change has taken place in the situation of the enemy upon Staten-Island since I wrote to you on the fifth: but I have this morning received an account from Elizabeth-Town, which mentions that a person had just come from the Island, who informs that small craft are constantly
<PB N="105" REF="029737_0443_0FE29A8B59C52718"/>
plying between New-York and the fleet, laden with of∣ficers' baggage and stores put up in packages, and marked with their names and regiments; and that transports are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itted up with stalls over their main decks for the recep∣tion of horses. This looks as if a longer voyage was in∣tended than up the North-river.</P>
<P>I have given notice to all the eastern States to be upon their guard, should the fleet put to sea and steer that way: and I think the works upon and obstructions in the Del∣aware should be carried on with spirit, and completed as far as possible, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they should visit that quarter. I think the southern States should also be advised of the uncertain∣ty of the next operation of the enemy, that they may also be making such preparations as they may judge necessary.</P>
<P>I shall make inquiry into the number of arms at present at Springfield: and if any can possibly be spared to the State of Connecticut, they shall have all or part of those requested by governor Trumbull. General Knox expects the return on Saturday from Springfield; and I can then determine the matter.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS morning received a letter of the seventh in∣stant from general Schuyler, a copy of which, and of its in∣closure, I herewith send you. The intelligence which they contain is truly interesting, supposing it just: but it differs so widely from what we had reason to expect from the ac∣counts mentioned in general St. Clair's letters to general Schuyler (copies of which you would receive in his letter transmitted from hence last night by major Hoops) that I would fain flatter myself it is not true. I am the more encouraged to hope this, as captain Farmam's letter from Fort-Ann to brigadier Learned seems to be the founda∣tion of the whole, and does not authorise the unfavourable and unhappy conclusions built upon it. I should rather suppose, if any accident has befallen us, it must have hap∣pened to the detachment of men from the Grants, under colonel Warner: for we find from general St. Clair's let∣ters, he expected something from him. The whole ac∣count is so confused that we cannot establish any certain deduction from it; and I shall be happy if it proves pre∣mature and groundless.</P>
<P>I am told by a gentleman who came to camp yesterday evening, that Nixon's brigade would certainly arrive at Al∣bany on Tuesday morning, as he saw the vessels, in which it was embarked, standing up the evening before with a fair wind.</P>
<P>If the event mentioned by general Schuyler should not have happened, we cannot doubt but general Burgoyne has come up the Lake, determined, if possible, to carry his point,—I mean, to possess himself of our posts in that quarter, and to push his arms further. Supposing this not to have happened, as our continental levies are so deficient in their number, our security and safety will require that aids from the militia should be called forth in cases of
<PB N="107" REF="029737_0445_0FE29A8CE24DEFC8"/>
emergency: if it has, there is now an absolute necessity for their turning out to check general Burgoyne's progress; or the most disagreeable consequences may be apprehended. Upon this occasion I would take the liberty to suggest to Congress the propriety of sending an active, spirited of∣ficer, to conduct and lead them on. If general Arnold has settled his affairs, and can be spared from Philadelphia, I would recommend him for this business, and that he should immediately set out for the northern department: he is active, judicious, and brave, and an officer in whom the militia will repose great confidence. Besides this, he is well acquainted with that country, and with the routes and most important passes and defiles in it. I do not think he can render more signal services, or be more use∣fully employed at this time, than in this way. I am per∣suaded his presence and activity will animate the militia greatly, and spur them on to a becoming conduct. I could wish him to be engaged in a more agreeable service—to be with better troops: but circumstances call for his exer∣tions in this way, and I have no doubt of his adding much to the honours he has already acquired.</P>
<P>In consequence of the advices from general St. Clair, and the strong probability there is that general Howe will push against the Highland passes to co-operate with general Burgoyne, I shall, by the advice of my officers, move the army from hence to-morrow morning towards the North∣river. If such should be his intention, we shall not be too early, as a favourable wind and tide will carry him up in a few hours. On the other hand, if Philadelphia is his ob∣ject, he cannot get round before we can arrive there; nor can he well debark his troops, &amp;c. and proceed across the land, before we can oppose him.</P>

<P>WHEN I had the honour of addressing you last. I hoped the intelligence received respecting our affairs in the northern department was not true, or at least that they were not so unfavourable as they were then represented.
<PB N="108" REF="029737_0446_0FE29A322737C798"/>
But the inclosed copy of a letter from general Schuyler, which came to hand yesterday evening, confirms it, most unhappily for us, in its fullest latitude. This event, (the evacuation of our posts on the Lake) among the most un∣fortunate that could have befallen us,—is rendered more interesting by the manner in which it took place. I have no further information upon the subject than what the copy contains, and shall be happy to hear by my next advices, that the main body of the army, of whose situation general Schuyler knew nothing with certainty, have not become prisoners: for I fear, from the disposition they discovered on this distressing occasion, they would have surrendered to the enemy, in case they fell in with them, though infe∣rior in number.</P>
<P>In respect to general Schuyler's demands, it is not in my power to comply with the whole of them. Not a sin∣gle tent can be furnished: the kettles will be, and are or∣dered on; and an express is going to Springfield for all the musket-cartridges, sixty barrels of powder, and a pro∣portionable quantity of lead and cartridge-paper for his use. Ten pieces of artillery, with harness, are also ordered, with proper officers from Peekskill. I have written to him to procure horses and drivers himself, as they are to be ob∣tained with much more ease where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is, than here: nor can he be supplied with the heavy cannon which he requests, supposing them necessary,—not having one to spare from a more important use,—the defence of the Highlands Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this, as his regiment is part of Nixon's brigade,—who will an∣swer every purpose he can possibly have for an engineer at this crisis. A supply of intrenching tools was sent him four or five days ago, in consequence of an application then made.</P>
<P>I should be extremely happy if our situation would allow me to afford him a large reinforcement of men: but I cannot with any degree of propriety, in the opinion of my general officers, send more to his aid at this time than a number of recruits on the march from Massachusetts State, belonging to some of the regiments under his command, who amount to six hundred at least, and are now, I ex∣pect, pretty well advanced towards Peekskill. With this
<PB N="109" REF="029737_0447_0FE29A8E6671EB40"/>
augmentation to what he already has,—supposing general St. Clair and his force to have come in, and any number of militia to have turned out,—he will have an army, equal if not superior to general Burgoyne's, from the only accounts we have obtained. Besides this consideration, it is most probable that general Burgoyne will suspend his operations till general Howe makes a movement and an effort on his part. His designs, I think, are most unquestionably against the Highlands, and that he will attempt the execution as soon as possible.</P>
<P>We have been prevented marching to-day by the rain; but, as soon as the weather permits, shall proceed as expe∣ditiously as we can towards the North-river, and cross, or not, as shall appear necessary from circumstances.</P>
<P>In my last I took the liberty of suggesting the propriety of sending an active officer to animate the militia that may assemble for checking general Burgoyne's progress, and mentioned general Arnold for that purpose. Being more and more convinced of the important advantages that will result from his presence and conduct, I have thought it my duty to repeat my wishes on the subject, and that he may, without a moment's loss of time, set out from Philadelphia for that purpose.</P>
<P>When this arrives, it is likely general Howe's intention will be well understood: but whether it is or not, as there are strong reasons to believe his operations will be up the North-river and on the east side of it, I shall take the lib∣erty to recommend the sending on the North-Carolina and other continental troops at Philadelphia, to join this army, unless Congress have some information that a southern ex∣pedition is intended, of which I am not apprised.</P>
<P>If Congress have taken colonel Procter and his corps into the service of the States, it will be expedient for them to come on with all the field-artillery which colonel Flow∣ers the commissary may have ready. This I have been induced to mention, having heard Congress were about to adopt them, and as our demand for artillerists is great. I would also observe that the situation of our affairs has be∣come so delicate and embarrassing by the late misfortune we have experienced, that it is much to be wished some expedient could be come into, if there be any more effica∣cious
<PB N="110" REF="029737_0448_0FE29A33A93A4688"/>
than what has been already recommended, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illing and completing the several regiments. At present they only count in number, but not in force, being most shame∣fully deficient in their just complements.</P>
<P>Your letter of the eighth was duly received; and, agree∣able to your request. I communicated to generals Greene and Knox the resolution of Congress respecting them and general Sullivan, the last of whom I have not seen since it came to hand.</P>

<P>I WAS yesterday evening honoured with yours of the fourteenth. I have heard nothing from the northward since my last. I this day received advice from Staten-Island, that, on Sunday, seventy sail of the enemy's ships fell down from the watering-place to the Hook: But wheth∣er they have since gone out to sea, I have not heard.

I can either march forward or return, as circumstances may require.</P>
<P>If general Nash should not have begun his march before this reaches you, be pleased to order him to proceed as far as Trenton only, and there wait my further orders. In case he should have marched, be pleased to dispatch an ex∣press after him, with orders to halt at Trenten.</P>
<P>I am pleased to hear that you have taken colonel Proc∣ter's corps of artillery into continental service. You will be kind enough to order them to join the army immediate∣ly: for I expect the light artillery in a few days from the eastward; and artillery-men will be wanted to man them.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but the militia from the western parts of New-England will turn out to general Schuyler's assist∣ance, as I hope those of this State and Jersey will to mine, should they be wanted.</P>
<P>I shall be very happy if the committee of Congress can arrange the commissary's department in such a manner as will satisfy the officers concerned in the business, and at the same time serve to supply the army with more regularity than has been done for some time past.

<P>THE little notice I had of your coming to the ar∣my, and the shortness of your stay in camp, will more than probably occasion the omission of many matters which of right ought to be laid before you; and the interruption which my thoughts constantly meet by a variety of occur∣rences, must apologize for the crude and indigested manner in which they are offered.</P>
<P>The completion of the continental regiments is a matter of such infinite importance, that I think no means should be left unessayed to accomplish it. Draughting, where the powers of government are adequate, would be the speediest and most effectual: but if it should be thought unadvisea∣ble to attempt this mode,—next to it I would recommend that the business of recruiting should be taken entirely out of the hands of the officers of the army, and that each State should appoint some person of known activity (one, for instance, who has been a good under-sheriff) in each county or township, not only to recruit, but to apprehend deserters;—these persons to be liberally rewarded for each recruit and deserter whom they shall deliver, at stated pe∣riods and places, to officers appointed to receive, discipline, and march them to the army;—none of these recruiters to have the smallest power to act out of their own districts, but to be absolutely fixed to them.</P>
<P>A mode of this kind would, in my humble opinion, be less burdensome to the public than the present,—prevent
<PB N="114" REF="029737_0452_0FE29A3FF8552868"/>
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dle habits which recruiting officers contract, not only injurious to themselves, but to others,—the most effectual means which can be devised for the recovery of deserters,—the surest way of keeping your regiments of equal strength, and of making the duty more equal in the detail of it: in a word, many valuable advantages would result from it, whilst I can suggest but one reason against it,—and that, (fully satisfied I am) when weighed in the scale of interest, will not operate,—I mean, the keeping so many officers in camp, who might be spared from the duties of the field till the regiments are stronger than at present. The sixteen additional regiments labour under such dis∣advantages in some States, as to render the interposition of Congress, in some shape or other, indispensably necessary.</P>
<P>With respect to food, considering we are in such an ex∣tensive and abundant country, no army was ever worse sup∣plied than ours, with many essential articles of it. Our soldiers, the greatest part of last campaign and the whole of this, have scarcely tasted any kind of vegetables,—had but little salt;—and vinegar, which would have been a tol∣erable substitute for vegetables, they have been in a great measure strangers to. Neither have they been provided with proper drink: beer or cider seldom comes within the verge of the camp, and ruin in much too small quanti∣ties. Thus, to devouring large quantities of animal food untempered by vegetables or vinegar, or by any kind of drink but water,—and eating indifferent bread, (but for this last a remedy is provided)—are to be ascribed the many putrid diseases incident to the army, and the lament∣able mortality that attended us last campaign. If these evils can be remedied, the expense and trouble ought not to be obstacles. Though some kinds of vegetables are not to be had, others are, which, together with sour krout and vinegar, might easily be had, if proper persons ac∣quainted with the business were employed therein.</P>
<P>Soap is another article in great demand. The conti∣nental allowance is too small: and, dear as every neces∣sary of life is now got, a soldier's pay will not enable him to purchase; by which means his consequent dirtiness adds not a little to the diseases of the army.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="029737_0453_0FE29A9C83F0E940"/>
I have no reason to accuse the clothier-general of inat∣tention to his department; and therefore, as his supplies are incompetent to the wants of the army, I am to sup∣pose his resources are unequal. Ought not each State then to be called upon to draw such supplies from the country manufactories, as can be afforded? particularly of shoes, stockings, shirts and blankets,—articles indispensably nec∣essary, and of which scarce too many can be provided:—in the mean while, every provision to be making, for cloth∣ing the troops uniformly and warm in the winter. It is a maxim which needs no illustration, that nothing can be of more importance in an army, than the clothing and feeding it well. On these the health, comfort and spirits of the soldiers essentially depend; and it is a melancholy fact, that the American army are miserably defective in both these respects. The distress most of them are in for want of cloathing is painful to humanity, dispiriting to them∣selves, and discouraging to every officer. It makes every pretension to the preservation of cleanliness impossible, exposes them to a variety of disorders, and abates or de∣stroys that military pride, without which nothing can be expected from any army.</P>
<P>The consequence of giving rank indiscriminately is much to be dreaded: great dissatisfaction has already arisen on account of bestowing this on officers in the civil departments of the army, on the inferior staff, waggon-master, &amp;c. who, by custom, propriety, and every other motive, are excluded from it in all well-regulated armies. The too great liber∣ality practised in this respect will destroy the pride of rank where it ought to exist, and will not only render it cheap, but contemptible. It is the policy of all armies to make it valued and respected, as a stimulus to emulation, and an incitement to bold and gallant undertakings: it must be very unadviseable therefore, in our infant state of war, to adopt novel customs to bring it into discredit—which must and will be the consequence of making it too common, be∣sides the disgust it creates in others.</P>
<P>An auditor of accounts, to be constantly with the army, is absolutely requisite. It is impossible for me, crowded as I am with other business, to examine and adjust the numerous complex accounts of the army with-that correctness the
<PB N="116" REF="029737_0454_0FE29A417AB4AFC0"/>
public have a right to expect, before warrants pass for pay∣ment; and, without doing it, great impositions may follow. The provision for making regimental pay-masters regulate all regimental accounts is altogether incompetent to the end proposed from it: for these men being appointed generally agreeable to the recommendation of the field-officers of the regiments they belong to—associating constantly with the officers of their corps, and in a great measure under their control—cannot be considered as sufficiently uninfluenced: nor are auditors at a distance from the army of much use, as it would require a delay not admissible, to send accounts to them to audit before they were passed and paid in conse∣sequence of warrants from the commander-in-chief of the army.</P>
<P>A good geographer, to survey the roads and take sketch∣es of the country where the army is to act, would be ex∣tremely useful, and might be attended with exceeding valuable consequences. He might with propriety have the chief direction of the guides, and must have a head to pro∣cure, govern, and pay them. If such a person should be approved of, I would beg leave to recommend Mr. Robert Erskine, who is thoroughly skilled in this business, has al∣ready assisted us in making maps of the country, and has (as I am informed) uniformly supported the character of a fast friend to America.</P>
<P>A small travelling press, to follow head-quarters, would be productive of many eminent advantages. It would enable us to give speedy and exact information of any mil∣itary transactions that take place, with proper comments upon them, and thereby frustrate the pernicious tendency of falsehood and misrepresentation, which in my opinion, of whatever complexion they may be, are, in the main, detrimental to our cause. If the people had a channel of intelligence, that, from its usual authenticity, they could look up to with confidence, they might often be preserved from that despondency which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pictures our enemies and their emissaries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with,—and from that diffidence of truths favourable to us, which they must naturally feel from the frequent deception they are exposed to by the extravagant colourings our
<PB N="117" REF="029737_0455_0FE29A9E09D68A18"/>
friends often give to our successes. It would also be very useful to dispatch business in camp, being the most expedi∣tious means of taking copies of orders or other matters that require to be dispersed, and would save a good deal in returns and other papers we are often obliged to get printed in Philadelphia. An ingenious man, to accompa∣ny this press and be employed wholly in writing for it, might render it singularly beneficial.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly embarrassed how to dispose of the French officers in general, but more especially the artillery officers, who are come out under the sanction of a compact. I can think of no other way than that of forming a separate corps of them, and draughting men from the whole line to compose that corps: but even this will be attended with many disagreeable effects;—among others this is not the least, that officers will think themselves much injured to have the men they have had the trouble of raising, taken from them and given to others. There is something in this which is discouraging, and breaks the spirit of a good officer, who prides himself in having a full and complete corps.</P>
<P>A doubt has arisen, whether a person who belongs to any of the United States of America, and who owed al∣legiance to any of the said States,—that went to the ene∣my some time past, and since that time has been lurking about any of the fortifications, or about any of the encamp∣ments of the armies of the United States,—plundering and driving off cattle to the enemy, recruiting for them, or committing any other atrocious crime,—or who is appoint∣ed an officer in the enemy's army,—can be tried by a general court-martial, under the resolution of Congress of the twenty-first of August, 1776, and punished as a spy.</P>

<P>WE have been under great embarrassments respect∣ing the intended operations of general Howe, and still are, notwithstanding the utmost pains to obtain intelligence of the same. At present it would appear that he is going
<PB N="118" REF="029737_0456_0FE29A445A93AE30"/>
out to sea. By authentic information, there are only forty ships at New-York; the rest are gone elsewhere, and have fallen down between the Narrows and the Hook: between these two places, the number, from the most accurate ob∣servation, was about one hundred and twenty yesterday. As I observed before, their destination is uncertain and un∣known: but I have thought it my duty to inform Congress of these facts, that they may give orders to the militia to hold themselves in readiness to march on the shortest notice, in case Philadelphia should be their object. At the same time I am to request that they will have a sufficient number of proper look-outs fixed at the Capes of Delaware, (to whose accounts implicit confidence may be given) to make the earliest reports of the arrival of any sleet,—which Con∣gress will transmit me by the speediest conveyance.</P>
<P>As the enemy will probably make many feints, and have it unhappily but too much in their power from their ship∣ping, I would advise that the look-outs should be cautioned to be extremely accurate in their observations and reports, mentioning, with as much precision as possible, the number of ships that may appear. Our situation is already criti∣cal, and may be rendered still more so by inaccurate and ill-grounded intelligence.</P>
<P>From the advices received on Saturday, of the movements of part of the enemy's ships, and the strong reasons there were to suppose general Howe would push up the North-river to co-operate with general Burgoyne, I detached lord Stirling with his division to Peekskill on Sunday morning:—they crossed the river that evening and the next morning. This movement will prove unnecessary, should his destina∣tion be to the southward. I have also ordered general <HI>Nixon'</HI>s brigade from Peekskill to reinforce general Schuy∣ler, from his representations of the inadequacy of his force to oppose general Burgoyne, and of the seeming backward∣ness of the people in that quarter to afford him aid.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honour to transmit you a copy of my letter to general Howe, of the sixteenth instant, pro∣posing
<PB N="120" REF="029737_0458_0FE29A4B9CD8E728"/>
an exchange between generals Lee and Prescot. I dispatched it early the next morning, and presume it got to hand on the eighteenth. As yet I have not received his answer.</P>
<P>The amazing advantage the enemy derive from their ships and the command of the water, keeps us in a state of constant perplexity and the most anxious conjecture. We are not yet informed of their destination, nor can any plau∣sible conclusions be drawn respecting it, at least not such as appear satisfactory. What renders the matter still more difficult and confused, is their extreme inactivity and delay: for it is certain they began to embark immediately after the evacuation of Amboy, and now remain between the Narrows and the Hook, or were there when I was last ad∣vised upon the subject. I have two active officers, with an escort, now out, for the purpose of intelligence, and for re∣connoit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing their situation from Fort-Lee and along the river in that neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Things being thus circumstanced, and various opinions, as to their real object, prevailing among us,—some suppos∣ing it to be Philadelphia, others the North-river, and others an expedition more easterly,—I would submit it to Con∣gress whether the militia of the neighbouring counties should not be immediately called to the first, or at Chester,—the lower counties, at Wilmington. This measure appears to me highly expedient, and no objection can lie against it, of sufficient validity to prevent it, as a few days must certainly determine their real designs. Should they be against Phil∣adelphia, and they have favourable winds, their voyage will be made in a short time, when it may be too late to obtain their aid, and to arrange them properly for defence, supposing them to come in. I am the more induced to recommend this measure, as the several objects we have to attend to necessa∣rily oblige this army to continue at a considerable distance from that place till their intentio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s are better understood; and as they might by a sudden and rapid p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h attempt to ef∣fect some material, capital stroke, before we could get there, unless there is a respectable force to oppose them: for, though no great dependence can be put in a militia acting alone, nor a vigorous opposition expected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them (from the nature of things) to a disciplined, well appointed army,
<PB N="121" REF="029737_0459_0FE29AAAC4B41230"/>
yet their operations may be greatly retarded by them, and may be checked till other succours arrive. The report of a force, especially if it is in any wise respectable, let it be of what sort it may, will have some influence on their conduct, and may prevent enterprises that would otherwise be undertaken.</P>
<P>From the intelligence we received on Saturday evening that a number of the enemy's ships were standing up the North-river,—and in the course of that and the preceding day, that forty sail were in the Sound, going into Fairfield harbour,—I had not the least doubt in my mind but gen∣eral Howe had in view a stroke against the Highlands and the fortifications there, and to co-operate with general Burgoyne. In consequence of these advices, I judged it expedient to move the army the next morning, from our then encampment, towards those posts. Lord Stirling's division was ordered to take the route to King's-ferry, and to pass the river to Peekskill; and I proceeded myself with the remainder, which composed the main body, by the route leading through the Clove towards New-Windsor. We marched over a very difficult and rugged road till night, when we halted,—the first division having advanced about eighteen miles. In this situation we lay till yesterday morning, when, from the information received before re∣specting the enemy's fleet being at and near the Hook, and no further accounts of the ships in the Sound, a change in our measures took place. Stephen and Lincoln's divisions were ordered to proceed to Chester, (there to wait fur∣ther directions, as a place from whence they may move with much more ease either to Philadelphia or Hudson's river, being seven miles nearer the former, and equally con∣venient to the latter) and general Greene's division to this ground. By dividing, and this arrangement, I am in hopes our movements will be more expeditious, wheresoev∣er they may be necessary.</P>

The progress of his arms, and the deficiency in the quotas of men exacted from the States to compose our army, seem to forbid expeditions for conquest, and to demand our utmost exertions to maintain what we already have. Congress will be pleased to write to the Massachusetts council on the subject, and a line to general Heath, that he may know how to govern himself respecting the application.</P>

<P>General Greene's division, consisting of Muhlenberg and Weedon's brigades, is now here: it will proceed six or seven miles farther this evening. Generals Sullivan and Stirling's divisions have repassed Hudson's river:—the for∣mer will proceed by this route—the latter by way of Para∣mus and Boundbrook or Brunswic. General Stephen, with his own and Lincoln's division, (general Lincoln be∣ing ordered to join general Schuyler) is marching on a back road from Chester, through Sussex, to Howel's ferry on Delaware. Moylan's and Bland's regiments of horse, which were pasturing about Boundbrook and on the com∣munication towards Woodbridge, were ordered to march too on the first intelligence I received of the fleet's sailing. Morgan's corps of light troops is also on the march through Brunswic, with directions to halt at Trenton till further orders, or till he gets certain information of the appearance of the fleet in Delaware. I intend in like manner that lord Stirling's division shall halt and remain there or at Bris∣tol, till we have further information of the enemy. From either of these places they will be sufficiently near Philadel∣phia, and may proceed in time on any emergency.</P>

<P>I have thought proper to halt the whole army at these two places and at Trenton till our knowledge of the enemy's destination becomes more certain.

<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your letter of yesterday, and with its inclosures. I shall pay attention to the resolves transmitted; and, as soon as circumstances ad∣mit, shall propose to general Howe an exchange between lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Hessian field-officers, and a like number of ours, of equal rank in his hands.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to lay before Congress a copy of a report made by a board of general officers, held on the sev∣enth instant, to consult of several matters respecting the army. In the course of their deliberation they took into consideration the subject reported—I shall only add that this matter has been long complained of by the officers, and the more so as the indulgence they pray could not nor can be ever attended with the least possible injury to the public, and is what I believe is allowed in most armies. Congress, I am persuaded, will give it their attention—and, if no good objections of a public nature appear against the measure, will grant what the officers wish and the board have recom∣mended.</P>
<P>I perceive by the resolves of the thirtieth ultimo and first instant, for recalling generals Schuyler and St. Clair, that they are directed to repair to head-quarters. I also find that a committee had been resolved on, to digest a mode for inquiring into the reasons for evacuating Ticonderoga and Mount-Independence, and into the conduct of the gen∣eral officers in the northern department at the time of the evacuation. As these gentlemen have received the letter upon this subject by this time, and will probably be down in the course of a few days, I shall be glad to be informed

<P>THE disappearance of the enemy's fleet for so many days rendering it rather improbable that they will again re∣turn, I have thought it adviseable to remove the army back to Coryel's, where it will be near enough to succour Phila∣delphia, should the enemy, contrary to appearances, still make that the object of their next operation; and will be so much the more conveniently situated to proceed to the northward, should the event of the present ambiguous and perplexing situation of things call them that way. I was the more inclined to this step, as the nearness of the army to the city, besides other disadvantages, afforded a temp∣tation both to officers and men, to indulge themselves in licenses inconsistent with discipline and order, and conse∣quently of an injurious tendency.</P>
<P>But before my departure, I esteem it my duty to commu∣nicate to Congress the result of my examination into the nature of the river-defence proper to be adopted, according to the means in our possession, to prevent the success of any attempt upon Philadelphia by water. I therefore beg leave to lay before Congress what appears to me most eligible, considering all circumstances, and comparing my own observations with the different opinions of the gentlemen whom I consulted on the occasion.</P>
<P>It is generally a well-founded maxim, that we ought to endeavour to reduce our defence as much as possible to a certainty by collecting our strength and making all our prep∣arations at one point, rather than to risk its being weak and ineffectual every where, by dividing our attention and force to different objects:—in doing this, we may disable ourselves from acting with sufficient vigour any where, and a misfortune in one place may pave the way for a similar
<PB N="128" REF="029737_0466_0FE29A5C544D53A0"/>
one in another. In our circumstances we have neither men, cannon, nor any thing else to spare, and perhaps can∣not with propriety hazard them on objects, which, being attended with the greatest success we can promise ourselves, can be productive of only partial and indecisive advantages, and which may possibly fail of the end proposed,—may have some serious ill consequences,—and must at all events have some disadvantages.</P>
<P>It is then to be considered where our defence can be most effectually made—whether at Billingsport or at Fort-Island. It appears to me that the last deserves greatly the preference: Billingsport has but one row of chevaux-de-frise: Fort-Island has three, and, in addition to them, a boom, and another chevaux-de-frise ready to be sunk in the channel on the approach of the enemy: of course the ob∣structions, in this respect, are four times as great at the one as at the other. The gallies and floating batteries that could be brought for the defence of the chevaux-de-frise at Billingsport would be unable to maintain their station when once the enemy were in possession of the commanding ground on the Jersey side, to which they would be entirely exposed; and, notwithstanding the works raising there, even supposing them complete, the strongest advocates for making our defence in this place do not pretend that the event can be protracted more than fifteen or twenty days at most; at the end of which time, we should be obliged, with the loss of our cannon at least, to abandon the de∣fence, and leave it in the power of the enemy to remove or destroy the chevaux-de-frise at pleasure.</P>
<P>Nor is it by any means certain that a single row of che∣vaux-de-frise would be an impenetrable barrier to the ene∣my's ships:—experiments have been made, that lead to a contrary supposition; and if they should hazard one (which it might be well worth their while to do with some of their less valuable ships) under favour of a leading breeze and tide, and should succeed in it,—the consequence might be the loss of our gallies and floating batteries, which I appre∣hend might be intercepted, and (with the assistance of their gallies and small armed vessels) taken: and this would greatly weaken the opposition we might otherwise give at Fort-Island, and tend powerfully to tender it abortive.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="029737_0467_0FE29ABB4E2B78D0"/>
But if they should not attempt this, contenting themselves with safer though slower operations, I have already observ∣ed that it is agreed on all hands, in fifteen or twenty days they would be able to possess themselves of infallible means of frustrating our opposition there by the capture of our works. And if we add to this that it might very pos∣sibly happen in less time,—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no other cause, yet, from the garrison being intimidated by a consciousness of its own inferiority and inability to support itself against a so much superior force of numbers, which might occasion a conduct destructive to itself,—there will remain no sufficient reasons to justify the making this the principal point of defence.</P>
<P>At Fort-Island, the boom and chevaux-de-frise are an ample security against any forcible impression of the enemy's ships, which it would be imprudent in them to attempt. On the Jersey side, the situation of the ground is such, that the gallies, floating-batteries, and forts, employed in the defence of the obstructions, would have little to fear from any batteries erected there. Red-bank seems by its eleva∣tion to be the only advantageous spot for annoying them: but as it is computed to be above nineteen hundred yards from Fort-Island, the distance is rather too great to allow any battery raised there to act with such effect as to be able to silence our fire. On this side, the ground, by dikes and sluices, may be laid under water to so considerable an ex∣tent as to leave no danger of our river force being annoyed from thence; for which purpose suitable preparations ought at once to be made, against it be necessary to carry them into effect.</P>
<P>But though a battery upon Red-bank would not, in my apprehension, be able to prevent the efficacy of our defence, or give any material disturbance to Fort-Island in particu∣lar, yet it might serve to make the situation of some of our gallies rather uneasy; and this perhaps makes it worth while to pre-occupy it in order to keep it out of the enemy's hands, erecting a small but strong work there, capable of containing about two hundred men, with six or eight pieces of light cannon and a proportionable quantity of stores. As the approaches to it are difficult on account of the ad∣jacent creeks, and a communication can be kept open be∣tween it and our army,—by which means the garrison
<PB N="130" REF="029737_0468_0FE29A5E0CA5D6B8"/>
might receive succours from time to time,—though we could not expect to make it impregnable, yet we should have a prospect of holding it much longer than we could the work at Billingsport. In the position, which, from my present view of it, I should think it best for our army to take, the left wing of it would be nearly opposite to Red-bank, and therefore in a condition to relieve and support it;—whereas Billingsport being more remote from the probable position of the army, and detached from any other work, could not easily derive any assistance from without, and must rely wholly upon its own strength.</P>
<P>Either at Billingsport or at Fort-Island, I believe there is not much to be apprehended from the fire of the enemy's ships unaided by land-batteries: for, as by the information of those who ought to be acquainted with the fact, not more than three ships can act a-breast at a time at either place,—and as the gallies, not requiring the same depth of water, can extend themselves at pleasure, and besides carry a superior weight of metal to that which frigates commonly have,—a much superior fire could be opposed to them than any they could bring, and (from the difference of size and make between the frigates and gallies) to much better ef∣fect than theirs. The comparative extent of the river at Billingsport and at Fort-Island has been assigned as a motive of preference to the former,—the river being narrower there than at the latter, and supposed to admit of fewer ships op∣erating at a time: but as it is asserted by the gentlemen in the river department, that the sand-banks and shallow∣ness of the river in most places near Fort-Island compen∣sate for the width of it, and make it impossible for more than three ships to act together at a time,—this reason for preferring the position at Billingsport seems to have no foundation. And if we consider that our whole force of gallies and floating batteries would be collected at Fort-Island, assisted by the fort itself,—and that it would not be safe to trust them all out for the defence of Billingsport for fear of the disaster already suggested,—it seems evident enough that this is the place where our defence may be most successfully made.</P>
<P>One of the most weighty considerations with me is that our army, as before intimated, could more conveniently
<PB N="131" REF="029737_0469_0FE29ABCD4E84F68"/>
co-operate with the defence by water here than at Billings∣port. The ground on this side is better situated here than at the other place: and the army being so much nearer the city, it is so much the less likely that the enemy should be able, by a circuitous route, to fall into the rear of it, and separate it from the city,—which is a circum∣stance that ought carefully to be attended to.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen are of opinion that our principal de∣pendence ought to be upon Fort-Island and its appendages: but, at the same time, that we should make a part of our defence at Billingsport,—proposing, for that purpose, that the works there should be continued on the new contracted scale, to be garrisoned by four or five hundred men. The reasons for this are, that it would serve to delay the ene∣my, and give our army time to come up, should it be at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay distance,—and that it would prevent those disagreea∣ble impressions which never fail to accompany the aban∣doning works that have been once raised, and plans that have been once in execution, especially when the persons concerned in the defence of them repose a degree of con∣fidence in them,—which is said to be the case in the pres∣ent instance.</P>
<P>But these reasons may perhaps not be so conclusive as it is imagined: for it is a question, whether, if our army was so remote as to make such a delay necessary, the enemy would embarrass themselves with removing the wa∣ter obstructions in the first place, but would not rather de∣bark and make a rapid march by land, possessing them∣selves of the city, and of those positions which would make the surrender of the gallies, &amp;c. in some sort a nat∣ural consequence. And it is worthy of consideration whether the abandoning the works begun at this time, which will probably allow some leisure for any disagree∣able impressions it might make to be effaced, will not be less injurious than the abandoning them hereafter when they have cost more expense, time and labour, and in the critical moment of an attack, when every misfortune, and the loss of the most inconsiderable post, is too apt to have a much worse influence on the mind, than the real import∣ance of it will justify.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="029737_0470_0FE29A5F91943A98"/>
Add to this the possibility that the garrison, dismayed at the approach of numbers so superior to their own, might not answer the end expected from them, and might even be lost by their timidity;—the certainty of losing the can∣non after the time limited for the defence, and thereby weakening that of the upper position;—the chance of los∣ing the gallies and floating-batteries requisite for covering the chevaux-de-frise, by a hazardous and successful attempt to break through them,—and the garrison with them, which would fall of course upon such an event. It is however submitted to Congress to balance the advantages and disad∣vantages, and determine accordingly. I would only beg leave to give it clearly as my opinion that our principle de∣pendence ought to be upon Fort-Island and the obstructions there, and that Billingsport ought not by any means to be defended more than as a secondary object: and, to that end, I would recommend that the works on Fort-Island,—which, on their present construction, are by no means calculated for the defence of the chevaux-de-frise,—be immediately altered and adapted to that purpose, tak∣ing care at the same time to make them defensible with a small number of men against any sudden attempt to land in boats and carry them by assault.</P>
<P>But, whatever scheme is pursued, I could wish the greatest diligence and dispatch may be used in bringing it to maturity: for, though the danger which lately threat∣ened seems to have subsided, there is no knowing how soon it may return: and certainly it will be prudent to do every thing in our power to be prepared for it, as we can lose nothing by being so, and may lose a great deal by neglecting to improve the interval of leisure they have given us, should it be their intention to revisit this quarter. As the means to this, it will be necessary to furnish Mr. Coud∣ray, to whom the superintendency of those works is entrust∣ed, with a competent number of workmen, tools, and what other things he may want, to enable him to carry them on with propriety, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, and expedition.</P>
<P>On the whole, I am of opinion that the obstructions in the river, with the help of gallies, floating-batteries, and with tolerable industry to put the land works in a proper state, will be extremely formidable to the enemy, and au∣thorise
<PB N="133" REF="029737_0471_0FE29ABE581C7858"/>
a reasonable expectation of their being effectual. The fire-ships also will contribute to this end: for though there are many obstacles to render their success precarious, and a happy concurrence of circumstances is necessary to∣wards it,—any of which failing may disappoint the project, and there is therefore no room to be sanguine, yet there is some probability of its succeeding; and they will be at least an embarrassment and terror to the enemy, and will oblige them to use precautions inconvenient to them, and service∣able to us.</P>
<P>As an accurate knowledge of the country is essential to a good defence,—and as the enemy's approach may be sud∣den, and we may be called to act, without having time, when it happens, to examine it sufficiently if it is not done beforehand, it would answer a valuable purpose to have it immediately carefully reconnoitred, and sketches taken of all the landing places, great roads, and by-paths, encamp∣ing grounds, heights, rivers, creeks, morasses, and every thing that it can be of any importance to know. Marcus-Hook seems to be the most advanced place at which it is conjectured the enemy will land; the survey should there∣fore comprehend all the country between that and Phila∣delphia. Monsieur Du Coudray has offered his service, with his engineers, to do this business, if authorised by Congress, only requiring that they may be supplied with horses and a hand or two. If Congress approve of it, I shall be glad they may be desired to enter upon it without loss of time.</P>

<P>GENERAL Newcomb having informed me that he had collected a body of about five hundred Jersey militia at Woodbury, I have desired him to endeavour to keep them together while matters remain in their present uncertainty and suspense, and to employ them in whatever works may be carrying on at Billingsport or Red-bank for the defence of the river. I mention this, that, if it shall be thought proper, monsieur Du Coudray may be directed to call for the assistance of those militia accordingly.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Du Coudray has laid before me a plan of the river, by which it appears that, for a consider∣able space between the two sand-banks on the east side of Fort-Island, there is from four to four and a half fathoms depth of water. According to this representation, there would be room for three frigates to lie between those banks in such a position as to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilade the works at Fort-Island, and make it difficult to maintain them.</P>
<P>There are but two ways of remedying this inconveni∣ence;—one by having a sufficient number of chevaux-de-frise sunk at the entrance between the two banks;—and the other, by having the lest flank of Fort-Island fortifica∣tion supported by a good battery capable of resisting the cannon of the ships, and obliging them to quit their station. The first is evidently preferable, because the efficacy of it will be more certain. A few chevaux-de-frise properly placed might effectually bar all access to the ships: but there is a possibility that any battery we can construct might be overpowered by the fire of the shipping: and as
<PB N="135" REF="029737_0473_0FE29AC6DEDE5418"/>
we have few cannon, and Fort-Island is itself a marshy spot, incapable of affording earth for the batteries necessary to be raised upon it, which must be brought from the oppo∣site shore,—it would not be prudent to multiply works there more than cannot be avoided. It would also be a great advantage gained, to secure the Island from annoyance ex∣cept in one point, and that in front, from only three ships at a time,—which would be effected by stopping up the passage between the two banks with chevaux-de-frise. I should therefore think it of importance to have this measure immediately adopted and carried into execution.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour of addressing a few lines to Congress on a subject which appears to me of infinite im∣portance, and to have a claim to their serious attention. The matter I allude to is the exorbitant price exacted by merchants and venders of goods for every necessary they dispose of. I am sensible the trouble and risk in importing give the adventurers a right to a generous price, and that such, from motives of policy, should be paid: but yet I cannot conceive that they, in direct violation of every prin∣ciple of generosity, of reason, and of justice, should be al∣lowed (if it is possible to restrain them) to avail themselves of the difficulties of the times, and to amass fortunes upon the public ruin.</P>
<P>This grievance is now an object of universal complaint, and of universal apprehension: and the consequences that are likely to result from a continuance of it excite in every well-affected mind the most disagreeable feelings. The inclosed copy of a memorial from a part of the Pennsylva∣nia officers shews their sentiments upon the subject: and I am persuaded those of the whole army are similar, as they have and do experience the gross abuses they com∣plain of. I know that ways and means for preventing this evil wholly, are difficult (if practicable) to find out: but I should hope that Congress themselves, or the supreme
<PB N="136" REF="029737_0474_0FE29A6BA7DB8590"/>
powers in the respective States, through their recommenda∣tion, may devise some mode by which it may be redressed in part.</P>
<P>I think there are two measures, which, if adopted and put under proper regulations, would be of considerable sav∣ing to the public, and to the army, at the same time that they would contribute a good deal to do away part of the uneasiness of the latter, arising from the enormous prices they are compelled to pay for necessaries. The first is the establishment of public tanneries in three or four of the States, under care of a judicious commissary or director, to which all the hides of the cattle killed for the army should be carried, and tanned. There should be also deputies to attend the army to collect the hides: and it appears to me that establishing the tanneries in different States,—for in∣stance one in this, and another in Connecticut,—will be much more adviseable than fixing only one in either of them; as the business may be carried on more extensively, with more convenience, and at less expense, than if the raw hides were to be transported to one place only, from which probably there would be a necessity of carrying them the whole distance back again after they were dressed. This subject was under consideration of Congress once be∣fore, and a commissary (if I recollect, a Mr. Phillips) ap∣pointed, who declined the office. Leather is of such es∣sential use, and so indispensably necessary for shoes and other purposes in the army, that too much care nor too effectual means cannot be taken to procure it.</P>
<P>What I have ventured to mention, if gone into, will add much to our supplies, and, I am certain, will prevent the high and unjustifiable prices demanded for this article when in the hands of private owners. Besides, at those tanne∣ries, a number of artists, such as shoe and harness makers, might be employed to work the leather up.</P>
<P>In like manner, since our imports of spirit have become so precarious, nay impracticable, on account of the enemy's fleet which infests our whole coast,—I would beg leave to suggest the propriety of erecting public distilleries in differ∣ent States. The benefits arising from the moderate use of strong liquor have been experienced in all armies, and are not to be disputed. In the present situation of affairs, our
<PB N="137" REF="029737_0475_0FE29AC9EF5C92A0"/>
soldiery cannot obtain such supplies as are absolutely neces∣sary; and if they are fortunate enough to get any, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the sutlers at most extravagant rates, and at such as are in∣credible to tell of. This is a source of much complaint, and, I should hope, may be removed by appointing proper persons to buy grain and distil it for the army,—large quan∣tities of which may be easily procured, and on reasonable terms, in many of the States.</P>
<P>In respect to the observation in the memorial about ra∣tions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certain the present allowed value is by no means sufficient; nor does it answer the purpose intended. Since that was fixed, provisions, like every other article, though not from the same causes, have become extremely dear; and what at that time was a just equivalent, is totally inade∣quate now. This matter, I doubt not, will have the atten∣tion of Congress, and such regulations be made respecting it, as may be right and equitable.</P>
<P>It appears to me, from the information I have received, that two companies, each to consist of sixty men at least, under proper officers, of unsuspected attachment, spirit and activity,—should be immediately raised, to guard the labo∣ratory and stores at Carlisle. Their security is of consider∣able importance, and ought to be attended to. These com∣panies, besides serving as a guard, will be frequently of use as escorts and convoys to stores. If Congress should deem them necessary, and order them to be enlisted, yet I would recommend that they should not be raised as merely station∣ary or local,—having found from experience that regiments or companies formed upon such a footing enter upon other services with great discontent and reluctance, though the occasion should be never so pressing.</P>
<P>In a letter of the thirteenth of June, I submitted to Con∣gress an application from the officers of cavalry respecting their horses,—whether they were to be provided at their own or the public expense. I also laid before them, in a letter of the fifth of July, captain Sullivan's requisition for pay. I shall be glad to be honoured with their determination upon these subjects, and also in general respecting the line of conduct I should pursue as to the pay of officers taken prisoners at any time before the close of the last campaign, who have been permitted to be on parole;—and wheth∣er

there is to be any distinction between such of them as are continued by new appointments, and those who are not. I have frequent applications in these instances, and wish to know how to act.</P>
<P>Since the express from general Schuyler left this, I re∣ceived a letter from governor Clinton, a copy of which, and of its inclosures, I herewith transmit, as they give a much more favourable account of the affair at Fort-Schuy∣ler, than was contained in his letter.</P>

<P>FROM the time which has clapsed since general Howe departed from the Capes of Delaware, there is the strongest reason to conclude that he is gone far either to the eastward or southward, and with a design to execute some determined plan.

The probability is in favour of a southern expedition, be∣cause he has been seen, since his departure from the Capes, off Sinapuxent, steering a southern course,—and because, had his destination been to the eastward, his arrival there, from the general state of the winds, must have announced it before this, or his fleet would have been discovered by some of the cruisers on that coast.</P>
<P>If he is gone to the southward, he must be gone far that way: for, had Chesapeak-bay been his object, he would have been there long since, and the fact well established. Beyond that, there is no place short of Charleston, of suf∣ficient importance to engage his attention. The extensive commerce,—the vast accumulation of military and other stores in that town and its dependencies,—with the eclat it would give his arms if he should unfortunately take it,—afford him stronger inducements to direct his operations there, than he could possibly have elsewhere.</P>
<P>Matters being thus circumstanced, an important question arises,—how this army is to be employed?—If his inten∣tions are such as I have supposed them, it appears to me that an attempt to follow him would not only be fruitless, but would be attended with the most ruinous consequences. The distance is so immense that general Howe might ac∣complish every purpose he had in view, before we could possibly arrive to oppose him; and so long a march through an unhealthy climate at this season would debilitate and waste a principal part of our force. Added to this,—after we had made a considerable progress, he might easily re∣embark his troops and turn his arms against Philadelphia or elsewhere, as he should think proper, without our being in a condition to give the least aid.</P>
<P>As these, and many other reasons which will readily occur to Congress, will shew the impracticability of our counteracting general Howe in that quarter with any good effect, we have no other alternative left than to remain here idle and inactive, on the remote probability of his re∣turning this way,—or to proceed towards Hudson's-river, with a view of opposing general Burgoyne, or making an attempt on York-Island, as the situation of affairs shall
<PB N="142" REF="029737_0480_0FE29A703148DDF8"/>
point out. A successful stroke with respect to either would be attended with the most signal advantages, and would be the best compensation we could make for any losses we may sustain to the southward. Besides these con∣siderations,—if, after all our conjectures and reasoning up∣on the subject, general Howe should be gone to the east∣ward to co-operate with Mr. Burgoyne, the army will be, by the movement proposed, so far on its way, to prevent, I hope, the success of his enterprise.</P>
<P>The above reasons led me to call a council of general officers this morning, to take the subject of removing the troops from hence into consideration: and I am happy to inform Congress they were in sentiment with me upon the occasion, as they will perceive by a copy of the proceedings then had, which I do myself the honour of laying before them. Nevertheless, as it is a movement which may in∣volve the most important consequences, I have thought proper to submit it to Congress for their deliberation and decision. If it is deemed expedient, we have perhaps not a moment to lose in carrying it into execution; and, un∣der this persuasion, I have sent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, (who will have the honour of delivering this) to bring me the result of their opinion.</P>
<P>As the northern department has been all along consid∣ered separate, and in some measure distinct, and there are special resolves vesting the command in particular persons,—in case it should hereafter appear eligible to unite the two armies, it may perhaps be necessary that Congress should place the matter upon such a footing as to remove all scru∣ples or difficulties about the command, that could possibly arise on my arrival there. This I request, from a disposi∣tion to harmony, and from my knowing the ill and fatal consequences that have often arisen from such controver∣sies, and not from the most distant apprehension that one would take place upon such an event. The thing however is possible; and to guard against it, can do no injury.</P>

<P>I AM this moment honoured with yours of this morning, containing several pieces of intelligence of the fleet's having been seen off the Capes of Virginia on the fifteenth instant. I shall, in consequence of this informa∣tion, halt upon my present ground till I hear something further.</P>
<P>Colonel Pinckney of South-Carolina paid me a visit two days ago. He informed me that the military stores in Charleston and the neighbourhood were immense, and that he did not believe that the governor or commanding officer there had had the least intimation of the fleet's hav∣ing stood to the southward; and he seemed very apprehen∣sive, that if Charleston was their object, they would find them lulled into security, and quite unprepared for an at∣tack. As I cannot yet think that general Howe seriously intends to go into Chesapeak, I would by all means advise that an express be immediately dispatched (if one has not already gone) to warn them of their danger, to let them prepare in the best manner for defence, and to advise them to remove all supernumerary stores.</P>
<P>I shall immediately call upon governor Livingston to furnish the number of militia from the State of Jersey, de∣manded by requisition of Congress, to garrison the forts in the Highlands, while the New-York militia march to rein∣force the northern army.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you that the army marched early this morning, and will encamp, I expect, this even∣ing within five or six miles of Philadelphia. To-morrow morning it will move again, and I think to march it through the city, but without halting. I am induced to do this, from the opinion of several of my officers and many friends in Philadelphia, that it may have some influence on the minds of the disaffected there, and those who are dupes to their artifices and opinions. The march will be down Front and up Chesnut-street, and, I presume, about seven o'clock.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, the arrival of the enemy's fleet in Ches∣apeak-bay, and the seeming probability that general Howe will debark his troops and attempt something, yet I would take the liberty to mention that I think the several works for the defence of the city should be carried on with the usual industry, and that no pains should be omitted to com∣plete them. I would also advise that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same look-outs for intelligence should be continued at the Capes, and the earliest information communicated of any thing material: for, though the fleet is in Chesapeak-bay, the enemy may push in a number of vessels with troops, and make an ef∣fort to effect some stroke against Philadelphia by surprise.

What we had before was after he marched, and was an answer to a report he had received from him. There was also a mis∣take in his name before, being called Bom in the copies sent by general Lincoln.</P>

<P>I THIS morning returned from the Head-of-Elk, which I left last night. In respect to the enemy, I have nothing new to communicate:—they remain where they debarked first. I could not find out from inquiry what number is landed, nor form an estimate of it from the dis∣tant view I had of their encampment. But few tents were to be seen from Iron-hill and Gray's-hill, which are the only eminences about Elk. I am happy to inform you that all the public stores are removed from thence, except about seven thousand bushels of corn. This I urged the commissary there to get off as soon as possible, and hope it will be effected in the course of a few days, if the enemy should not prevent,—which their situation gives them but too easy an opportunity of doing. The scarcity of teams in proportion to the demand will render the removal rather

<P>HAVING endeavoured, at the solicitation of the count De Pulaski, to think of some mode for employing him in our service, there is none occurs to me, liable to so few inconveniences and exceptions as the giving him the command of the horse. This department is still without a head, as I have not, in the present deficiency of brigadiers with the army, thought it adviseable to take one from the foot for that command. The nature of the horse service with us being such that they commonly act in detachments, a general officer with them is less necessary than at the head of the brigades of infantry. In the absence of gener∣al Smallwood, who is ordered to put himself at the head of the Maryland militia, we shall have two brigades without general officers.</P>
<P>But though the horse will suffer less from the want of a general officer than the foot, a man of real capacity, expe∣rience and knowledge in that service, might be extreme∣ly useful. The count appears, by his recommendations, to have sustained no inconsiderable military character in his own country: and as the principal attention in Poland has been for some time past paid to the cavalry, it is to be pre∣sumed this gentleman is not unacquainted with it. I sub∣mit it to Congress how far it may be eligible to confer the appointment I have mentioned upon him: they will be sensible of all the objections attending the measure, without my particularising them, and can determine accordingly.</P>

<P>ON my return to this place last evening from White-Clay creek, I was honoured with yours of the twenty-sev∣enth, with sundry resolves of Congress, to which I shall pay due attention.</P>
<P>The enemy advanced a part of their army yesterday to Gray's-hill about two miles on this side of Elk,—wheth∣er with intent to take post there, or to cover while they remove what stores they found in the town, I cannot yet determine. I do not know what quantity of private prop∣erty remained: but of the public there were several thou∣sand bushels of corn and oats, which might have been re∣moved also, had not most of the teams in the country been employed by private persons in bringing off very valuable goods.</P>
<P>Our light parties yesterday took between thirty and for∣ty prisoners: twelve deserters from the navy and eight from the army have already come in; but they are able to give us very little intelligence. They generally agree that their troops are healthy, but that their horses suffered very much by the voyage.</P>
<P>By a letter from general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, which you were pleased to transmit me yesterday, he requests that commissions may be sent to brigadiers Glover, Poor, and Patterson, which I beg the favour of you to do by the return express.

<P>THE latest and most material intelligence which I have obtained respecting the enemy, you will find in the inclosed papers, which I do myself the honour of transmit∣ing to you.</P>
<P>How far the enemy have it in view to extend themselves in a line from bay to bay, I cannot determine: but the idea has taken place with many; and it is said to be found∣ed on their hints to some persons, who, from accident in some instances, and perhaps choice in others, have had a more familiar intercourse with them. I cannot suppose they have any such design, or, if they have, that it can be more than temporary for procuring supplies of provisions.</P>
<P>General Howe's declaration is agreeable to his constant usage, and is what we might reasonably expect. The only difference is, the present exhibition is styled a <HI>'declaration.'</HI> It is another effort to seduce the people to give up their rights, and to encourage our soldiery to desert. The facts contained in the deposition of Francis Alexander, which you have also inclosed, seem to be opposed to that regular∣ity and discipline which are promised by the declaration.</P>
<P>Yesterday there was some skirmishing between one of our advanced parties and one of the enemy's, in which they were obliged to retreat, with the loss of an officer and

<P>I have received no particular accounts respecting the Maryland eastern shore militia: from the best informa∣tion I have, a great many are well disposed to turn out, but are prevented giving their aid through the want of arms. Apprehending that the militia there would stand in need of an officer to arrange them, I wrote to general Cadwal∣lader, requesting his good offices, which I am told have been exerted. Colonel Gist is now gone down, and I expect will move on as soon as possible, with such as are armed, towards the enemy.

<P>I THIS minute returned to head-quarters, where I found your favour of this date, with the resolves respecting general Sullivan, and colonel Richardson's battalion. I had conversed with general Sullivan upon the subject, and observed to him that it was necessary an inquiry should be had relative to the affair of Staten-Island, as his conduct was censured, and much dissatisfaction prevailed. He was sensible of the propriety of the measure, and expressed a desire that it should take place, provided he could have the benefit of general Smallwood's testimony, who was on the expedition. That gentleman happens at this time to be in Maryland; which must necessarily delay the inquiry, unless some mode can be agreed upon for obtaining his sentiments upon the matter.</P>
<P>This morning the enemy came out with a considerable force and three pieces of artillery, against our light advanc∣ed corps, and, after some pretty smart skirmishing, obliged them to retreat,—being far inferior in number, and without cannon. The loss on either side is not yet ascertained: ours, though not exactly known, is not very considerable: theirs, we have reason to believe, was much greater, as some of our parties, composed of expert marksmen, had opportunities of giving them several close, well-directed fires,—more particularly in one instance, when a body of riflemen formed a kind of ambuscade. They advanced about two miles this side of Iron-hill, and then withdrew to that place, leaving a piquet at Couch's mill, about a mile in front. Our parties now lie at White Clay creek, ex∣cept the advanced piquets, which are at Christiana bridge.</P>
<P>On Monday a large detachment of the enemy landed at Cecil court-house; and this morning I had advice of their having advanced on the Newcastle road as far as Carson's tavern. Parties of horse were sent out to reconnoitre them, which went three miles beyond the Red Lion, but could neither see nor hear of them; whence I conjecture they filed off by a road to their left, and fell in with their main body. The design of their movement this morning seems to have been to disperse our light troops who had been troublesome to them, and to gain possession of Iron-hill,

I have written to general Putnam to detach the fifteen hundred men mentioned by Congress, and inclose my letter upon the subject, which you will be pleased to forward to him by the earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>In respect to the subject of monsieur Du Coudray's let∣ter, I would beg leave to observe, however eligible the measure might otherwise be which he recommends, an at∣tempt to carry it into execution at this time would answer no valuable purpose, as the work in all probability could not be more than marked out when it would be wanted. I would also add that I do not conceive any great advan∣tages could be derived from it, supposing it could be com∣pleted,—as we are certain the enemy will never attack lines which they can avoid. If they were obliged to ap∣proach Philadelphia by a particular route, in such case no exertions should be spared to erect works, and the adop∣tion of the plan would be highly expedient.</P>
<P>The enemy are now lying near Kennet's Square, and in a tolerably compact body. They have parties advanced on the Lancaster road, and on those leading over this ford and to Wilmington. Manoeuvring appears to be their plan. I hope, notwithstanding, that we shall be able to find out their real intended route, and to defeat their purposes.</P>
<P>By light-horsemen this instant come in, the enemy are in motion, and appear to be advancing towards us. His excellency is giving the necessary orders, and getting the troops under arms, which prevents him from signing this himself, as was intended at first.</P>

<P>YOUR favour of this morning came to hand about two o'clock. His excellency was then out, and still is. I have nothing material to inform you of respecting the enemy. By the last advices from our reconnoitring par∣ties, they had halted in a low ground strongly flanked by two hills, about a mile below Welch's tavern. It is sup∣posed they moved from the post they occupied this morn∣ing, for want of water. Some interesting event may take place to-morrow, as they are within a convenient distance to attack, if they have any such intention.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour of addressing you this morn∣ing, I mentioned that the enemy were advancing, and had begun a cannonade. I would now beg leave to inform you that they have kept up a brisk fire from their artillery ever since. Their advanced party was attacked by our light troops under general Maxwell, who crossed the Brandi∣wine for that purpose, and had posted his men on some high grounds on each side the road. The fire from our people was not of long duration, as the enemy pressed on in force,—but was very severe.</P>
<P>What loss the enemy sustained, cannot be ascertained with precision: but, from our situation and the briskness
<PB N="156" REF="029737_0494_0FE29AEB94CDA730"/>
of the attack, it is the general opinion, particularly of those who were engaged, that they had at least three hundred men killed and wounded. Our damage is not exactly known: but, from the best accounts we have been able to obtain, it does not exceed fifty in the whole.</P>
<P>After this affair, the enemy halted upon the heights, where they have remained ever since, except a detachment of them which filed off about eleven o'clock from their left, and which has since passed Brandiwine a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jones's ford, between five and six miles above Chad's. The amount of it is not known,—the counts respecting it being various,—some making it tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or three thousand strong, and others more.</P>
<P>Generals Sullivan, Stirling and Step<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, with their divis∣ions, are gone in pursuit, and to attack it if they can with any prospect of success. There has been a scattering loose fire between our parties on each side the creek since the action in the morning, which just now became warm, when general Maxwell passed over with his corps, and drove them from their ground with the loss of thirty men left dead on the spot, (among them a captain of the forty-ninth) and a number of entrenching tools with which they were throwing up a battery.</P>
<P>At half after four o'clock the enemy attacked general Sullivan at the ford next above this, and the action has been very violent ever since. It still continues. A very severe canonade has begun here too; and I suppose we shall have a very hot evening:—I hope it will be a happy one.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sorry to inform you, that, in this day's engage∣ment, we have been obliged to leave the enemy masters of the field. Unfortunately, the intelligence received, of the enemy's advancing up the Brandiwine and crossing at a ford about six miles above us, was uncertain and contra∣dictory, notwithstanding all my pains to get the best. This prevented me making a disposition adequate to the force
<PB N="157" REF="029737_0495_0FE29B58EC8D1338"/>
with which the enemy attacked us on our right; in conse∣quence of which, the troops first engaged were obliged to retire before they could be reinforced. In the midst of the attack on the right, that body of the enemy, which remain∣ed on the other side of Chad's ford, crossed it, and attacked the division there under the command of general Wayne, and the light troops under general Maxwell, who, after a severe conflict, also retired. The militia under the com∣mand of general Armstrong, being posted at a ford about two miles below Chad's, had no opportunity of engaging.</P>
<P>But, though we fought under many disadvantages, and were, from the causes above mentioned, obliged to retire, yet our loss of men is not, I am persuaded, very consider∣able,—I believe much less than the enemy's. We have also lost seven or eight pieces of cannon, according to the best information I can at present obtain. The baggage, having been previously moved off, is all secure, saving the men's blankets, which being at their backs, many of them doubtless are lost.</P>
<P>I have directed all the troops to assemble behind Ches∣ter, where they are now arranging for this night. Not∣withstanding the misfortune of the day, I am happy to find the troops in good spirits: and I hope another time we shall compensate for the losses now sustained.</P>
<P>The marquis La Fayette was wounded in the leg, and general Woodford in the hand: divers other officers were wounded, and some slain; but the numbers of either can∣not now be ascertained.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of this date. I heartily wish the works on Delaware were com∣pleted: but I think,—and in this opinion my officers con∣cur,—that the service will be injured if any part of the con∣tinental troops were now to be employed about them. If
<PB N="158" REF="029737_0496_0FE29AF48463E6C0"/>
we should be able to oppose general Howe with success in the field, the works will be unnecessary: if not, and he should force us from hence, he will certainly possess himself of them. But, to prevent his attempting it now, I have directed the meadows on Province-Island to be over∣flowed immediately, and any other grounds that may be thought necessary for that purpose. The works have been more peculiarly under the direction of monsieur Du Cou∣dray; and I doubt not he will pay every attention to their completion and security, that the situation of affairs will ad∣mit of.</P>
<P>A part of the militia under general Armstrong will be posted along Schuylkill, to throw up redoubts at the differ∣ent fords which will be occasionally occupied, whilst I move to the other side with the main body of the army. This disposition appears to me the most eligible from a con∣sideration of all circumstances, and better than if any part of our present force was to be employed at the forts. If further reinforcements of the militia should come in, they perhaps may be more properly assigned to that business than any we now have.</P>
<P>Your letter respecting general De Borre just now came to hand: I shall transmit him a copy of it and of the reso∣lution. There can be no court of inquiry into his conduct at this time:—as soon as the state of the army will admit, it will be held.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of yesterday, with its several inclo∣sures, came to hand last night. Though I would willingly pay every attention to the resolutions of Congress, yet, in the late instance respecting the recal of general Sullivan, I must beg leave to defer giving any order about it till I hear further from that honourable body. Our situation at this time is critical and delicate; and nothing should be done to add to its embarrassments. We are now most probably on the point of another action, and to derange the army by withdrawing so many general officers from it, may and must be attended with many disagreeable if not ruinous consequences. Such a proceeding at another time might not produce any bad effects: but how can the army be pos∣sibly conducted with a prospect of success, if the general of∣ficers are taken off in the moment of battle?—Congress may rely upon it, such a measure will not promote but in∣jure the service.</P>
<P>It is not my wish to prevent or to delay a proper inquiry into general Sullivan's conduct a single instant, when the circumstances of the army will admit: but now they pro∣hibit it, and (I think) the suspension in his command also. The recal of general St. Clair obliged me to part with general Lincoln whom I could but ill spare; so that the whole charge of his division is now upon general Wayne, there being no other brigadier in it than himself. The Maryland troops, if general Sullivan is taken away, will not have one general officer, general Smallwood being at the head of the militia coming from that State, and general De Borre suspended:—added to this, colonel Gift, who commands one regiment of them, is now from it by order. In a word, Sir, whether the charges alleged against general
<PB N="160" REF="029737_0498_0FE29AF643193E50"/>
Sullivan are true or false, or whether his conduct has been exceptionable or not, I am satisfied the resolution for his recal at this time was unhappily adopted, and, if carried into execution, will not fail to add new difficulties to our present distresses: and I am obliged to observe, in justice to my own character, that I cannot be answerable for the consequences which may arise from a want of officers to assist me.</P>
<P>It gives me great pleasure to find general Gates is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> respectable a footing; and I hope our affairs in that quar∣ter, in the course of a little time, will be in as prosperous a train as we could reasonably wish.</P>
<P>The main body of the enemy, from the best intelligence I have been able to get, lies near Dilworthtown, not far from the field of action, where they have been busily em∣ployed in burying their dead, which, from accounts, amount∣ed to a very considerable number. We are moving up this road to get between the enemy and the Swedes' ford, and to prevent them from turning our right flank, which they seem to have a violent inclination to effect, by all their movements.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to recommend in the most earnest manner, that some board or committee be appointed, or some mode adopted, for obtaining supplies of blankets for the troops:—many are now without; and the season becoming cold, they will be injured in their health, and unfitted for service, unless they are immediately provided with them. Our supplies in this instance, as well as in every article of cloathing, cannot be too great, as there are frequent losses not easily to be avoided. I would also observe that I think, in point of prudence and sound policy, every species of pro∣visions should be removed from the city, except such as will be necessary to supply the present demands of this army. I have been told there are considerable quantities in private Lands, which should not be suffered to remain a moment longer than they can be conveyed away.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honoured with your two favours of yesterday, and their inclosures, to which due attention shall be paid.</P>
<P>The enemy seem now to be straining every nerve to ac∣complish their purpose: but I trust, whatever present suc∣cess they may have, they will, ere long, experience a re∣verse of fortune.

Yesterday the enemy moved from Concord, by the Edgemont towards the Lancaster road, with evident de∣sign to gain our right flank. This obliged us to alter our position and march to this place, from whence we intend immediately to proceed to Warwick. We suffered much from the severe weather yesterday and last night, being un∣avoidably separated from our tents and baggage,—which not only endangers the health of the men, but has been very injurious to our arms and ammunition. These, when we arrive at Warwick, we shall endeavour, as soon as possible, to put again into a proper condition,—to do which, and to refresh the men, are two principal motives for going there.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not had the honour of addressing you since your adjournment to Lancaster, and I sincerely wish that my first letter was upon a more agreeable subject. The enemy, by a variety of perplexing manoeuvres through a country from which I could not derive the least intelli∣gence, (being to a man disaffected) contrived to pass the Schuylkill last night at the Flat-land and other fords in the neighbourhood of it. They marched immediately to∣wards Philadelphia, and I imagine their advanced parties will be near that city to-night.</P>
<P>They had so far got the start before I received certain intelligence that any considerable number had crossed, that I found it in vain to think of overtaking their rear, with troops harassed as ours had been with constant marching since the battle of Brandiwine; and therefore concluded, by the advice of all the general officers, to march from this place to-morrow morning towards Philadelphia, and on the way endeavour to form a junction with the conti∣nental troops under general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal from Peekskill, and the Jersey militia under general Dickinson, both of whom are, I hope, on this side the Delaware. I am also oblig∣ed to wait for general Wayne and general Smallwood, who were left upon the other side of Schuylkill, in hopes
<PB N="163" REF="029737_0501_0FE29B5D756FFE20"/>
of falling upon the enemy's rear:—but they have eluded them as well as us.</P>
<P>When I last recrossed the Schuylkill, it was with a firm intent of giving the enemy battle whereever I should meet them, and accordingly advanced as far as the Warren tavern upon the Lancaster road, near which place the two armies were upon the point of coming to a general engagement, but were prevented by a most violent flood of rain, which continued all the day and following night. When it held up, we had the mortification to find that our ammunition, which had been completed to forty rounds a man, was entirely ruined; and in that situation we had nothing left for it but to find out a strong piece of ground which we could easily maintain till we could get the arms put into order, and a recruit of ammunition.</P>
<P>Before this could be fully effected, the enemy marched from their position near the White-horse tavern, down the road leading to the Swedes' ford. I immediately crossed the Schuylkill above them, and threw myself full in their front, hoping to meet them in their passage, or soon after they had passed the river. The day before yes∣terday they were again in motion, and marched rapidly up the road leading towards Reading. This induced me to believe that they had two objects in view,—one to get round the right of the army,—the other perhaps to detach parties to Reading where we had considerable quantities of military stores.</P>
<P>To frustrate those intentions, I moved the army up on this side the river to this place, determined to keep pace with them: but early this morning I received intelligence that they had crossed the fords below. Why I did not follow immediately, I have mentioned in the former part of my letter: but the strongest reason against being able to make a forced march is the want of shoes. Messieurs Car∣roll, Chase and Penn, who were some days with the army, can inform Congress in how deplorable a situation the troops are, for want of that necessary article. At least one thousand men are bare-footed, and have performed the marches in that condition. I was told of a great number of shoes in the hands of private people in Philadelphia, and sent down to secure them: but I doubt the approach of the enemy will prevent it.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="029737_0502_0FE29AF948BB5DE8"/>
I have planned a method of throwing a garrison into Fort Mifflin. If it succeeds, and they, with the assistance of the ships and gallies, should keep the obstructions in the river, general Howe's situation in Philadelphia will not be the most agreeable: for if his supplies can be stopped by water, it may be easily done by land. To do both shall be my utmost endeavour; and I am not yet without hope that the acquisition of Philadelphia may, instead of his good fortune, prove his ruin.</P>
<P>General St. Clair, who has been constantly with the army for some time past, can give you many pieces of in∣formation which may have escaped me, and therefore I re∣fer you to him for many particulars.</P>
<P>If there are any shoes and blankets to be had in Lan∣caster or that part of the country, I earnestly entreat you to have them taken up for the use of the army. I have been informed that there are large parcels of shoes in par∣ticular there.</P>
<P>Finding that the inclosed came from colonel Gibson, I took the liberty of opening it, as I wanted much to know what route he was taking.</P>
<P>I have ordered all the Virginia militia who are tolera∣bly armed to come forward and join the army. Those who have no arms are to wait at Frederic-Town in Mary∣land till they hear whether any can be provided for them at Lancaster: you will therefore be pleased to make in∣quiry what number can be procured there, and send an express to Frederic with orders for as many men to come forward, as there are arms.</P>

Some have supposed the crew mutinied,—while another report is, that she was disabled in her rudder by a shot, and drove on shore. This misfortune takes off the success of captain Biddle's cruise.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING received intelligence through two inter∣cepted letters, that general Howe had detached a part of his force for the purpose of reducing Billingsport and the forts on Delaware, I communicated the accounts to my general officers, who were unanimously of opinion that a favourable opportunity offered to make an attack upon the troops which were at and near Germantown. It was ac∣cordingly agreed that it should take place yesterday morn∣ing, and the following dispositions were made.</P>
<P>The divisions of Sullivan and Wayne, flanked by Con∣way's brigade, were to enter the town by the way of Ches∣nut-hill, while general Armstrong with the Pennsylvania militia should fall down the Manatawny road by Vandeer∣ing's
<PB N="166" REF="029737_0504_0FE29B0419478AD8"/>
mill, and get upon the enemy's left and rear. The divisions of Greene and Stephen, flanked by M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal's brigade, were to enter, by taking a circuit by way of the lime-kiln road, at the market-house, and to attack their right wing; and the militia of Maryland and Jersey, under gen∣erals Smallwood and Forman, were to march by the old York road, and fall upon the rear of their right. Lord Stirling, with Nash and Maxwell's brigades, was to form a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orps-de-reserve.</P>
<P>We marched about seven o'clock the preceding evening, and general Sullivan's advanced party, drawn from Con∣way's brigade, attacked their piquet at Mount Airy or Mr. Allen's house about sun-rise the next morning, which pres∣ently gave way; and his main body, consisting of the right wing, following soon, engaged the light-infantry and other troops encamped near the piquet, which they forced from their ground. Leaving their baggage, they retreated a con∣siderable distance, having previously thrown a party into Mr. Chew's house, who where in a situation not to be easily forced, and had it in their power, from the windows, to give us no small annoyance, and in a great measure to ob∣struct our advance.</P>
<P>The attack from our left column under general Greene began about three-quarters of an hour after that from the right, and was for some time equally successful. But I cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that quarter, as I am not yet informed of them with sufficient certainty and precision.</P>
<P>The morning was extremely foggy, which prevented our improving the advantages we gained, so well as we should otherwise have done. This circumstance, by concealing from us the true situation of the enemy, obliged us to act with more caution and less expedition than we could have wished, and gave the enemy time to recover from the effects of our first impression: and, what was still more unfortu∣nate, it served to keep our different parties in ignorance of each other's movements, and hindered their acting in con∣cert. It also occasioned them to mistake one another for the enemy,—which, I believe, more than any thing else, contributed to the misfortune which ensued. In the midst of the most promising appearances, when every thing gave
<PB N="167" REF="029737_0505_0FE29B68643EBF60"/>
the most flattering hopes of victory, the troops began sud∣denly to retreat, and entirely left the field, in spite of every effort that could be made to rally them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it may be said the day was rather unfor∣tunate than injurious. We sustained no material loss of men, and brought off all our artillery, except one piece which was dismounted. The enemy are nothing the better by the event; and our troops, who are not in the least dis∣pirited by it, have gained what all young troops gain by be∣ing in actions. We have had however several valuable of∣ficers killed and wounded, particularly the latter. General Nash is among the wounded, and his life is despaired of. As soon as it is possible to obtain a return of our loss, I will transmit it.</P>
<P>In justice to general Sullivan and the whole right wing of the army, whose conduct I had an opportunity of ob∣serving, as they acted immediately under my eye,—I have the pleasure to inform you that both officers and men be∣haved with a degree of gallantry that did them the highest honour.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the fifth, I have obtained a return of our loss in the action on Saturday, by which it appears to be much more consider∣able than I at first apprehended, though I always imagin∣ed myself that it was greater than it was generally suppos∣ed to be. The copy of the return inclosed will shew the amount as it now stands; but I hope many of those who are missing will yet come in: I fear however there are sev∣eral under that denomination to be added to the number of the slain, as the action was warm in every quarter, from
<PB N="168" REF="029737_0506_0FE29B05D149DB88"/>
the information of the officers who commanded the differ∣ent attacks.</P>
<P>What loss the enemy sustained, I am not able precisely to ascertain: but from a variety of corresponding accounts of persons who left the city since, and those of a deserter, it was very considerable. The deserter, who is intelligent, says general Agnew was killed, Sir William Erskine wounded in the head and leg, and that their general loss, in killed and wounded, amounted to near eight hundred. Several reputable persons from the city corroborate this, particularly with respect to general Agnew's death: some say upwards of two hundred waggons with wounded were carried in after the action, and before they came out: and that it was the common belief there, the enemy had been severely handled.</P>
<P>It is with much chagrin and mortification I add that every account confirms the opinion I at first entertained, that our troops retreated at the instant when victory was declaring herself in our favour. The tumult, disorder, and even despair, which, it seems, had taken place in the British army, were scarcely to be paralleled: and it is said, so strongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail, that Chester was fixed on as their rendezvous. I can discover no other cause for not improving this happy opportunity, than the extreme haziness of the weather.</P>
<P>My intention is to encamp the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at some suitable place to rest and refresh the men, and recover them from the still remaining effects of that disorder naturally at∣tendant on a retreat. We shall here wait for the rein∣forcements coming on, and shall then act according to circumstances. General Varnum, with the detatchment from Peekskill amounting to about twelve hundred, in¦cluding officers, would be last night at Coryel's ferry. About five hundred militia from Virginia, and two hun∣dred from Maryland, together with colonel Gibson's State regiment consisting of two hundred and twenty-six effec∣tives, have already joined the army. Since the action, general Forman's brigade of Jersey militia has quitted us. The men began to be uneasy at their situation, and desirous to return home: and as, by some intelligence received from general Dickinson, there was reason to imagine there
<PB N="169" REF="029737_0507_0FE29B69E9379ED8"/>
might be a call for their services in the Jersies, it was thought expedient to gratify their desire.</P>
<P>The state of our water defence on the Delaware is far from being as flattering as could be wished. After some slight opposition from the Jersey militia under general Newcomb, a detachment of the enemy took possession of Billingsport. This perhaps is an event of no material consequence: but it is to be lamented that many of the officers and seamen on board the gallies have manifested a disposition that does them little honour. Looking upon their situation as desperate, or probably from worse mo∣tives, they have been guilty of the most alarming deser∣tions: two whole crews, including the officers, have de∣serted to the enemy. I learn however by captain Brew∣er, who is this moment arrived here from the fleet, that the accounts they have received from the city, of our late attack, were such as to have produced a favourable change, and to have inspired them with more confidence. I would here observe that the charge of bad conduct was by no means applicable to the whole:—far from it. He fur∣ther adds that four of the enemy's ships made an attempt yesterday morning to weigh the chevaux-de-frise opposite to Billingsport, but were repulsed by our gallies,—which has also contributed to raise the spirits of the seamen. Our garrison on Fort-Island, consisting of little more than two hundred continental troops under lieutenant-colonel Smith, appear determined to maintain their post to the last extremity.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congress that there is a great deficiency of general officers in this army. When the de∣tachment coming from Peekskill joins us, we shall have thirteen brigades. These require as many brigadiers, and six major-generals:—instead of these, we shall have only four major-generals and eleven brigadiers; and the deficien∣cy will be still increased by the death of general Nash, which, from every appearance, is momently to be expected. General Woodford's absence, occasioned by his wound, adds to our embarrassments, though it will be but for a time. Under these circumstances, Congress will be sensible that the government of the army cannot go on with that energy which is essential to its well-being and success. Neither
<PB N="170" REF="029737_0508_0FE29B0753ABE768"/>
officers nor men will transfer the respect and obedience they pay to a general officer, to a colonel who happens to be appointed to the temporary command of a brigade; nor will he, knowing his authority to be only temporary, be as solicitous to enforce it, as one who is conscious he is to continue in the station he fills. Want of leisure pre∣vents my being more particular at this time: but I shall take the liberty, in a day or two, to point out the troops that are in want of general officers, with my observations on the subject.</P>
<P>I cannot however omit this opportunity of recommend∣ing general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal to their notice. This gentleman, from the time of his appointment as brigadier,—from his abilities, military knowledge, and approved bravery,—has every claim to promotion. If I mistake not, he was passed over in the last appointments of major-generals, and young∣er officers preferred before him: but his disinterested at∣tachment to the service prevented his acting in the manner that is customary in like circumstances. This, I think, gives him a peculiar title to esteem, and concurs with the opinion I have of his value as an officer, to make me wish it may appear adviseable to Congress to promote him to one of the vacancies.</P>
<P>It would be well if the intended inquiry into the conduct of general St. Clair could be brought to a speedy issue; and, if he is acquitted to the satisfaction of Congress, that, as his general character as an officer is good, he may be again restored to the service.</P>
<P>By a letter this evening received from colonel Hawkes Hay of Haverstraw, dated the fifth at four o'clock, P. M. four ships of war, a considerable number of armed vessels, eight transports, and forty flat-bottomed boats, arrived that morning in the bay opposite that place, and were landing troops at Verplank's-Point. Their number and design were not known.</P>

<P>AS general Howe's operations are in this quarter, and his object in all probability fixed for this campaign, I am induced to submit it to the consideration of Congress if the whole or a part of the regiment of artillery command∣ed by colonel Harrison should not be immediately ordered to join this army. In the late actions, the corps under general Knox has suffered severely; and it is so reduced by the number of killed, wounded, &amp;c. that we are oblig∣ed to make draughts from the other battalions to supply their places. The measure I have ventured to submit will not, from present appearances, be attended with any ill con∣sequences, if carried into execution,—and the less so, as the State of Virginia, according to my information, is rais∣ing another regiment. Should it be thought adviseable, Congress will transmit their orders to colonel Harrison. If the regiment comes, they need not bring their artillery.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Wednesday evening I received the honour of your letter of the seventh with its several inclosures. The providing of suitable quarters for the troops during the winter demands our attention: but I confess it is difficult to say where they will be. Sundry circumstances may occur in the course of the campaign, to render any provis∣ion, which might now be thought of, altogether improper.</P>
<P>In respect to general Putnam's letter, though the ac∣counts transmitted by colonel Hawkes Hay indicate that the enemy had some attack in contemplation, yet I cannot but think the force the general mentions to have been at New-York was greatly exaggerated. The highest number of the reinforcements, said to have arrived, is three thou∣sand; and these are mentioned to be half boys. Other reports make it much less,—and some as low as five or six hundred. However, be it what it may, it is not in my power to grant him aid. Had the reinforcement arrived before the troops marched from Peekskill, so many might
<PB N="172" REF="029737_0510_0FE29B08D6EA5D10"/>
not have been ordered from thence. But the case was oth∣erwise, or at least I was not apprised of their arrival; and the detachments from thence were directed by the ad∣vice of my general officers, who had under consideration the state of the whole force at that post and its de∣pendencies, according to a general return. At the same time I urged general Putnam to call in all his out-posts, and to write in pressing terms to governor Trumbull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o assist him with some militia.</P>
<P>I have not heard a single syllable more of the troops or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet mentioned by colonel Hawkes Hay, except a vague report to-day that a number, supposed to be about fifteen hundred, had landed on this side the river at Haverstraw. If the fact is so, it is probable, they mean to pass through the Clove and invest the forts. I have great confidence in the activity and bravery of governor Clinton; and I trust, if such is their view, they will meet at least with a spirited if not a successful opposition. I have sent up lieu∣tenant-colonel Radiere, one of the engineers, with orders to direct such other works as may appear necessary.</P>
<P>There was a very severe cannonade on Wednesday night: it began about twelve o'clock, and continued till yesterday morning between seven and eight. I have not learned the occasion; but, from the direction, suppose it was at Fort-Mifflin, or an engagement between our armed vessels and the enemy's ships, which probably were making a second attempt against the chevaux-de-frise. I have determined to maintain the post at Red-Bank, if it can be done, and have detached colonel Greene there with his regiment of Rhode-Island troops, consisting of about two hundred and twelve effective privates. I have also written to general Newcomb of Jersey, pressing him to give all the aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e can from the militia.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the seventh we have been joined by more of the Virginia militia. The whole number now in camp amounts to about eleven hundred. Many of their arms are indifferent, and almost the whole are destitute of pouches and other necessary accoutrements.</P>
<P>On Sunday the enemy evacuated Billingsport. They left all our cannon, but burned the platforms and carriages.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="029737_0511_0FE29B735EC2C950"/>
Inclosed you will receive a letter addressed to me by colonel Portail. Congress will judge of the contents, and decide upon them as they may think they merit.</P>
<P>The military chest is nearly exhausted, not having more than ten thousand dollars in it; and a large part of the army is to pay for the month of August. Besides their claims, large sums are wanted by the quarter-master-general, and for other purposes. Congress, I hope, will order such immediate supply to be forwarded to the paymaster-general, as shall be in their power.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 11.—I wish to know what stores of le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d we have, and what expectations of further supplies. I am rather uneasy on this head, as I have not been able to ob∣tain satisfaction on some inquiries within the course of a few days.</P>
<P>The cannonade mentioned above was between our gallies and a detachment of the enemy who were attempting to throw up a battery at Webb's or the lowest ferry on Schuyl∣kill. It has been repeated this morning. Their design, in erecting this battery, probably is to cover their passage to Province-Island, from whence, by occupying the grounds about the pest-houses, they may expect to annoy Fort-Mifflin.</P>
<P>Our distress for want of shoes and stockings is amazing∣ly great, particularly for want of the former. On this ac∣count we have a great many men who cannot do duty, and several detained at the hospitals for no other cause. I must request Congress to continue their exertions to relieve us, and to direct every supply of these and other necessaries to be forwarded as soon as they possibly can after they are collected. It will be proper to send them on as fast as they can be procured, without waiting to make up a considera∣ble quantity to be brought at one time.</P>
<P>I was this morning honoured with your favours of the ninth, and their several inclosures. I feel in the most sen∣sible manner the honourable approbation Congress have been pleased to give of my conduct, and that of the army under my command, in the action on the fourth instant: nor am I less indebted to you, Sir, for the polite mode in which you have conveyed their sentiments. I shall com∣municate the resolve upon the subject to the army, and hope,
<PB N="174" REF="029737_0512_0FE29B1384F2A1D0"/>
if a favourable opportunity offers, under the smiles of Prov∣idence, they will merit, by more substantial services, the fur∣ther applause of their country.</P>
<P>The resolution of the eighth, for preventing supplies and intelligence being carried to the enemy, appears to me to be a salutary one; and I hope it will be attended with the most beneficial consequences. That it may be known among the inhabitants who are in their neighbourhood, and who have been guilty of such practices, I would wish to receive several printed copies, that they may be distributed in proper places.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the eleventh instant, nothing material has happened between our army and general Howe's. The inclosed copies of commodore Hazlewood and colonel Bradford's letters will shew the situation of affairs in the navy and at Fort-Mifflin, on the eleventh,—which are the latest accounts I have re∣ceived from thence. But there has been a warm cannonade since, which continued, with but little intermission, till be∣tween two and three o'clock yesterday afternoon, when it ceased. The result I have not heard; but I hope, from the determined spirit of the fleet and the garrison, matters continue as we could wish.</P>
<P>I received an express last night from general Putnam, informing me of the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and the consequent evacuation of Peekskill. I should send copies of his letters to me: but as the express who brought them had dispatches for Congress, I conclude he has advised them fully on the subject. These events may have an un∣happy influence on our northern affairs: but as the Con∣necticut militia seem to be coming in fast, and governor Clinton is exerting himself to bring out the force of New-York,—if general Putnam can but keep pace with their fleet in their progress up the river, I hope he will be able
<PB N="175" REF="029737_0513_0FE29B77B70AE970"/>
to frustrate their design of relieving general Burgoyne, and that every thing will still terminate well in that quarter.</P>
<P>It gives me pain to repeat so often the wants of the army: and nothing would induce me to it but the most urgent necessity. Every mode hitherto adopted for sup∣plying them has proved inadequate, notwithstanding my best endeavours to make the most of the means which have been in my power. The inclosed return will shew how great is our deficiency in the most essential articles. What new expedient Congress can devise for more effectually answering these demands, I know not, persuaded as I am that their closest attention has not been wanting to a mat∣ter of so great importance: out, circumstanced as we are, I am under an absolute necessity of troubling them, that if any new source can be opened for alleviating our dis∣tresses, it may be embraced as speedily as possible; for it is impossible that any army, so unprovided, can long subsist, or act with that vigour which is requisite to ensure success.</P>
<P>The return now inclosed is for troops present in camp; besides which, there are numbers in the several hospitals, totally destitute of the necessaries they require to fit them for the field; and, on this account alone, are prevented from joining their corps. The recruits coming in are also in the same melancholy predicament. I cannot ascertain with precision what quantity of cloathing is at this time in Mr. Mease's hands: but, from every account, what he has can administer but a very partial relief. I know he is en∣tirely bare of some of the most capital articles we want.</P>
<P>With respect to cartouch-boxes, without which it is im∣possible to act, I cannot find from my inquiries that there are any in store. Several of the continental troops are de∣ficient in this instance; and, what adds to our distress, there are but very few of the southern militia that are provided. I am trying to make a collection about the country: but, from the information I have received, the measure will be attended with but little success. This want, though not remedied immediately, may be removed in time; and I would take the liberty to recommend that the earliest at∣tention should be had to making a large supply. I would also advise that much care should be used in choosing the
<PB N="176" REF="029737_0514_0FE29B15086DF198"/>
leather:—none but the best and thickest is proper for the purpose; and each box should have a small inner flap for the greater security of the cartridges against the rain and moist weather. The flaps in general are too small, and do not project sufficiently over the ends or sides of the boxes. I am convinced of the utility, nay necessity, of these improve∣ments, and that the adoption of them, though they will incur an additional expense at first, will prove a considera∣ble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving, and of the most beneficial consequences: for we know from unhappy experience, in the severe rain on the sixteenth ultimo, the few boxes we had of this con∣struction preserved the ammunition without injury, whilst it was almost wholly destroyed in those of the common form with a single flap.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which I cannot omit men∣tioning to Congress, and which, in my opinion, has a claim to their most serious attention,—I mean the general defective state of the regiments which compose our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣mies. Congress will find, from a view of the returns transmitted from time to time, that they do not amount to half of their just complement. What can be done to remedy this, I know not: but it is certain every idea of voluntary enlistments seems to be at an end; and it is equally certain that the mode of draughting has been car∣ried on with such want of energy in some States, and so much disregarded in others, that but a small accession of force has been derived from it. These facts are sufficient∣ly interesting of themselves. But there are others to be added. I am told that Virginia, in her regulations for draughting, extended her plan only to the nine regiments that were first raised. In what policy this was founded, I cannot determine: but the other six are to receive no reinforcements from that source. Nor do matters stop here. The engagements of the first nine regiments, I am informed, were temporary: and, according to the officer's accounts, the longest period to which any of the men are bound to serve is next April:—many are not obliged so long: and there are some who claim a discharge at this time. I do not mention these things through choice, but from a principle of duty, to the end that Congress may de∣vise some timely and effectual provision for the whole, if
<PB N="177" REF="029737_0515_0FE29B806236CA00"/>
such shall be in their power. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the subject; and I will only observe that the conse∣quences of calling the militia [<HI>into the field in</HI>] the course of the war have been so severely and ruinously felt, that I trust our views will never be turned to them but in cases of the greatest extremity.</P>
<P>In pursuance of the resolution of Congress, a court of in∣quiry has sat upon general Sullivan. They met on the tenth, and continued the examination till the twelfth, when they came to the inclosed opinion. The depositions and papers which were before the court were many and prolix. They are not transmitted: but they may be obtained from the court, if wanted. Besides the depository proofs which they had of wounded and dead officers, they had many gentlemen before them in person.</P>

<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the twelfth and thirteenth instant, with their several inclo∣sures. In respect to the resolution directing a flag to be sent to general Howe, I am inclined to think that the informa∣tion upon which it was framed was without foundation. The letters which have come from our officers who have been lately taken generally mention that their treatment has been tolerably good; and such privates as have escaped have said nothing in the course of their examination, of their having been compelled to work. For these reasons I have taken the liberty to decline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending the flag. At the same time Congress may be assured, if our prisoners suffer any wrongs, I shall take every means in my power to have them redressed as soon as I am apprised of them.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="029737_0516_0FE29B168A54BAC8"/>
It is with the highest satisfaction I congratulate Congress on the success of our arms at the northward in the action of the seventh,—an event of the most interesting import∣ance at this critical juncture. From the happy train in which things then were, I hope we shall soon hear of the most decisive advantages.</P>
<P>We moved this morning from the encampment at which we had been for six or seven days past, and are just arrived at the grounds we occupied before the action of the fourth. One motive for coming here is to divert the enemy's atten∣tion and force from the forts. These they seem to consid∣er as capital objects, and (from their operations) mean to reduce, if possible. At present their designs are directed against Fort-Mifflin and the chevaux-de-frise. I have therefore detached a further reinforcement to the garrison.</P>
<P>I yesterday, through the hands of Mrs. * * *, received a letter of a very curious and extraordinary nature from Mr. D * * *, which I have thought proper to transmit to Congress. To this ridiculous, illiberal performance. I made a short reply, by desiring the bearer of it, if she should hereafter by any accident meet with Mr. D * * *, to tell him I should have returned it unopened, if I had had any idea of the contents;—observing at the same time, that I highly disapproved the intercourse she seemed to have been carrying on, and expected it would be discontinued. Notwithstanding the author's assertion.

<P>I LAST night had the honour to receive your letter of the seventeenth instant, with its several inclosures.</P>
<P>I heartily wish the States may feel the importance of fill∣ing their battalions, and may, in consequence of the rec∣ommendation of Congress, adopt such measures as will prove effectual for the purpose. I cannot but think that heretofore there has been a want of attention in this instance,
<PB N="179" REF="029737_0517_0FE29BA0C8FDAE78"/>
and that the subject, though interesting to the last degree, has been viewed with too much indifference. The resolu∣tion respecting deserters, I hope will also have their notice. It is highly necessary that they should come into some regu∣lations for apprehending them, and punishing those who give them countenance. If this is not done, our force will be always diminishing, and no exertions in the army will prevent it. I shall try the effects of a proclamation on those who are now delinquents, and shall be happy if it meets with success; but confess, from the experiment I have made, that I am not sanguine in my expectations that it will be the case.</P>
<P>As to the recruiting officers, I must observe, that, not∣withstanding the resolution of Congress of the thirty-first of July, and my circular letter on the subject of it to ma∣ny of the States, I have not received an account that any officers have been appointed, except in Connecticut and Jersey.</P>
<P>On Sunday the enemy evacuated Germantown, and with∣drew themselves within their lines near the city. They seem determined to reduce the forts, if possible; and, for this purpose, have thrown several parties over on Province-Island. I was informed this afternoon that a detachment also passed the Delaware at Cooper's ferry in the morning. If the account be true, (and I have no doubt of it) it is high∣ly probable they mean to make an attack upon the garrison at Red-Bank. I am taking every measure in my power to counteract them, and have written to generals Forman and Newcomb of Jersey to afford every aid they can to relieve the fort, in case they do invest it.</P>
<P>Against Fort-Mifflin they have kept up a cannonade, more or less, every day, and have thrown several shells, but without doing any considerable damage. The explosion of one killed a private, and wounded three others, who were in a barrack where it fell. They also set fire to two ammunition-boxes with a hot ball on the nineteenth, which did some injury to the barracks. I do not recollect that we have suffered lately in any instances besides these.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honour of transmitting to Congress the inclosed copies of sundry letters just now received, and congratulate them most sincerely on the important intelli∣gence which they contain. The damage the enemy have sustained in their ships, I hope, will prevent their future at∣tempts to gain the passage of the river; and the repulse of the troops under count Donnop, and his captivity, I flatter myself, will also be attended with the most happy conse∣quences. At the time these actions happened, a supply of ammunition was on the way to the forts; and I have also ordered a further quantity to be immediately sent.</P>
<P>By colonel Blaine, one of the issuing commissaries, who left Red-Bank in the morning before the action, I am hap∣pily informed that he had thrown considerable supplies of provision into both garrisons. He also adds that he came from Jersey this morning, and that the enemy had recro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> the Delaware and returned to Philadelphia. I have written to colonel Greene that the prisoners must be immediately sent from his post: and Mr. Clymer, a deputy under Mr. Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinot, will set out to-morrow morning to make a prop∣er disposition of them.</P>
<P>It gives me great concern to inform Congress, that, after all my exertions, we are still in a distressed situation for want of blankets and shoes. At this time no inconsidera∣ble part of our force are incapable of acting, through the deficiency of the latter; and I fear, without we can be re∣lieved, it will be the case with two-thirds of the army in the course of a few days.</P>

<P>I WAS duly honoured with Mr. Hancock's letter if the twenty-fifth, with its several inclosures. I shall take the case of John More under consideration, and will trans∣mit colonel Mason my determination upon the same.</P>
<P>At this time I cannot inform the commissary whether any alterations have or have not been made by general orders in the original ration establishment. I have been under the necessity, from time to time, to send away my orderly books; and they are necessary to be examined upon the subject. However, I think it probable that a departure from the first allowance may have been found expedient, and direct∣ed by some authority, or the commissary would not have adopted it. In respect to the alteration referred to my con∣sideration, it is a matter of consequence, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> desired the general officers to inform themselves whether it will be agreeable to the army at large, or what other regulations may be necessary in this instance. As soon as I have their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ments, I will write to Congress upon the subject.</P>
<P>The enemy still consider the possession of our posts upon the river of great importance; and, from their preparation of fascines, &amp;c. and the best information I have been able to obtain, they will make further efforts to carry them. Viewing them in this light myself, and imagining that they would persevere in their plans to occupy them, I wrote some days ago in the most pressing terms to generals Dickinson, Forman, and * * *, to afford every aid in their power from the militia of Jersey. As yet we have receiv∣ed but little; and I have no encouragement to expect that it will be much augmented in a short time. This does not proceed from a want of activity and exertion on the part of the two first mentioned gentlemen, whose conduct and zeal upon every occasion give them a claim to the public esteem, but in a considerable degree from the peculiar cir∣cumstances of their State at this time. The apprehensions of an invasion from Staten-Island keep a large proportion of the militia from the eastern and upper part of the State al∣most constantly employed at and in the neighbourhood of Elizabeth-Town: and Mr. Livingston's powers as gover∣nor being expired, and no provision made (it seems) for
<PB N="182" REF="029737_0520_0FE29B25AC4CBA90"/>
such a contingency,—there are none of sufficient authority to order them out, till a new appointment can be had:—at least there is ground to suspect that the orders and exertions of these two gentlemen, unassisted by civil authority, will not be attended with the advantages we wish, and which our affairs require. * * *</P>
<P>Under these circumstances I have been obliged to detach a further reinforcement of continental troops under general Varnum, to maintain the two garrisons, if possible,—besides sailors drawn from the line, to man the gallies. This de∣tachment, when it arrives, added to the force now in the forts, will make the whole amount to sixteen hundred ef∣fective rank and file sent from this army.</P>
<P>After the action of the fourth ultimo at Germantown, I hoped we should have been in a situation to attack the ene∣my again on those grounds, and with more success than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the former instance; but this I was not able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The severe rain on the sixteenth of September,—the action on the fourth,—the removal of our stores, and having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> form a new elaboratory,—added to the small number <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hands engaged in the business of it,—laid us under di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ties in the capital and essential article of ammunition, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> could not be surmounted. Every exertion was directed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obtain supplies; but (notwithstanding) they were inade∣quate, too scanty, and insufficient to attempt any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a large and general scale, before the enemy withdrew them∣selves. With what we had, in case an experiment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been made, fortune might have decided in our favour for the present; but we should not have been afterwards in a situation to maintain the advantage we might have gained: and if a repulse had taken place, and the enemy pursued,—for want of a reserve we might have been exposed to the most imminent danger of being ruined. The distress of the soldiers for want of shoes was also a powerful obstacle to the measure.</P>
<P>I could wish that our circumstances were now such as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> authorise a general attack for dislodging them from the city: but I think that they are not. This also is the opinion of my general officers, upon a full and comprehensive view of matters, as Congress will perceive by the inclosed copy of the minutes of council on the twenty-ninth ultimo, which
<PB N="183" REF="029737_0521_0FE29BA8A5DBC1D8"/>
I have taken the liberty to transmit and lay before them. The superiority of numbers on the part of the enemy, in respect to regular troops,—their superior discipline, and the redoubts and lines which they have thrown up between the two rivers and about the city,—the happy state of our af∣fairs at the northward, and the practicability of drawing succours from thence,—the consequences of a defeat,—these were all motives which led to a decision against an attack at this time.</P>
<P>I have sent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, to gen∣eral Gates, to give him a just representation of things, and to explain to him the expediency of our receiving the rein∣forcements which have been determined necessary, if they will not interfere with and frustrate any important plans he may have formed. Indeed I cannot conceive that there is any object now remaining, that demands our attention and most vigorous efforts so much as the destruction of the army in this quarter. Should we be able to effect this, we shall have little to fear in future.</P>
<P>General Howe's force, according to the state now made, is more considerable than it was generally supposed to be. I did not think it quite so great myself, but always imagin∣ed the common estimate much too low:—nor can I posi∣tively say what it really is. However, there are strong reasons to believe that it is not over-rated. After the evac∣uation of Germantown, an almost infinite number of scraps and bits of paper were found, which, being separated and arranged with great industry and care, bear the marks of genuine and authentic returns at different periods. The manner in which they were destroyed and disposed of gives no room to suspect that it was the effect of design. In ad∣dition to this, I am informed by general Putnam that he had heard a reinforcement of four regiments was coming round to Delaware from New-York.</P>
<P>The inclosed return will give Congress a general view of the strength of this army when it was made, and a par∣ticular one of the forces of each State which compose it. By this they will perceive how greatly deficient the whole are in furnishing their just quotas. The militia from Mary∣land and Virginia are no longer to be counted on:—all the former, except about two hundred, are already gone? and
<PB N="184" REF="029737_0522_0FE29B278B763440"/>
a few days, I expect, will produce the departure of the whole or chief part of the latter, from the importunate ap∣plications which some of them have made. Besides this diminution, I am apprehensive we shall have several men added to the sick list by reason of the late excessive rain and want of clothes.</P>
<P>We have not yet come to any determination respecting the disposition of our troops for the winter,—supposing it a matter of great importance, and that for the present we should be silent upon it. The reasons will readily occur. By continuing the campaign, perhaps many salutary if not decisive advantages may be derived; but it appears to me that this must depend upon the supplies of cloathing which the men receive. If they cannot be accommodated in this instance, it will be difficult if not impossible to do it without effecting their destruction.</P>
<P>I would take the liberty to mention that I feel myself in a delicate situation with respect to the marquis La Fayette. He is extremely solicitous of having a command equal to his rank, and professes very different ideas, as to the purposes of his appointment, from those Congress have mentioned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me:—he certainly did not understand them. I do not know in what light they will view the matter: but it ap∣pears to me, from a consideration of his illustrious and im∣portant connexions,—the attachment which he has mani∣fested for our cause,—and the consequences which his return in disgust might produce,—that it will be adviseable to gratify him in his wishes; and the more so, as several gentlemen from France, who came over under some assur∣ances, have gone back disappointed in their expectations. His conduct with respect to them stands in a favourable point of view,—having interested himself to remove their uneasiness, and urged the impropriety of their making any unfavourable representations upon their arrival at home: and in all his letters, he has placed our affairs in the best situation he could. Besides, he is sensible, discreet in his manners, has made great proficiency in our language, and, from the disposition he discovered at the battle of Brandi∣wine, possesses a large share of bravery and military ardour.</P>
<P>There is a French gentleman here,—monsieur Vrigny, in whose favour the marquis seems much interested.
<PB N="185" REF="029737_0523_0FE1BFB9ADEFEEF8"/>
He assures me he is an officer of great merit, and, from that motive and a regard to the service, wishes to see him promoted. The rank he holds in France, and his present expectations, are contained in the inclosed copy of a paper given me by the marquis. Monsieur Vrigny also has hon∣ourable certificates of his services, nearly corresponding with the marquis's account of them. If Congress are pleased to honour him with a commission in the army of the States, I must try to employ him.</P>
<P>I took the liberty some short time ago to mention to Congress the situation of the nine first raised Virginia regi∣ments, and the term for which they stand engaged; and, considering that we should suffer greatly by the loss of so large a part of our force which have been long inured to service, I thought it adviseable to consult the officers com∣manding them, upon the mode which should app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r to them best calculated to re-enlist them. They accordingly met, and reported their sentiments in writing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> copy of which I have inclosed. I do not know that expedients, more promising of success than those they have pointed out, can be adopted. Congress will be pleased to give the mat∣ter their earliest attention, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>our me with their opin∣ion by the first opportunity, whether the indulgence and allowance they have proposed may be granted,—and, if any additional bounty may be given, what it shall be. The high sums paid for substitutes and draughts, of late, even in the militia service, will make this necessary: for the soldiers, being well apprised of that fact, will not be induced to engage again during the war or for three years, for the usual p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mium.</P>
<P>I would also lay before Congress a remonstrance by the subaltern officers of the Virginia line, founded on a reform I thought necessary to take place in the regiments from that State. These, in their establishment, were made to consist of ten companies,—two more than were assigned to those of the States in general. This, and the great dispro∣portion between the officers and men, induced me to reduce them to a level with the rest belonging to the continent, in order to prevent a considerable unnecessary expense. To effect this, no new promotions are to be made in the two extra companies, viz. the ninth and tenth, either to vacan∣cies
<PB N="186" REF="029737_0524_0FE29B294B3775C0"/>
existing at the time of the regulation, or to any future ones that may happen therein: and the subalterns are to remain in their rank and command till they can be promot∣ed in the other eight companies, and their men incorporat∣ed. This is what they complain of. I have made a short state of facts, and wish Congress to determine upon them and the remonstrance as they shall think proper.</P>
<P>At the request of governor Clinton, I have transmitted a copy of his letter to me, giving an account of general Vaughan's expedition up the North-river after the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and of the destruction committed by his troops in burning Kingston and the houses and mills on the river. According to the latest advices, they have re∣turned again; and it is reported that they have destroyed the barracks and forts, and gone to New-York:—but this is not confirmed.</P>
<P>A few days ago Mr. Franks of Philadelphia, agent for the British prisoners, sent out six thousand continental dol∣lars to Mr. Richard Graham of Virginia, for the subsistence of the Hessians and other prisoners in that State. The policy of suffering the enemy to support their prisoners with money which they refuse themselves, and which they at∣tempt to depreciate in every instance they possibly can, ap∣pears to me very questionable,—and the more so, as it may be counterfeited. Besides, they have laid us under every difficulty they can devise, as to our prisoners in their hands:—nothing will do for their support but hard money. If the enemy were obliged to furnish the same, the quantity with us would be greater, and of course the means of re∣lieving ours, easier. I do not know what consequences a prohibition against receiving continental money or the cur∣rency of any State from them might involve: I think the subject is worthy of the consideration of Congress; and for that reason. I have mentioned it.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 3.—The report of the enemy's having destroy∣ed the forts and barracks on the North-river, and of their having returned to New-York, is confirmed. I this morn∣ing received a letter from general Putnam upon the subject, a copy of which is transmitted. The information that they mean to reinforce general Howe, I doubt not is true: it has come through several channels, and nothing is more
<PB N="187" REF="029737_0525_0FE29BABADF968C0"/>
probable. As to their having a further expedition in view, it seems to be questionable:—general Burgoyne's defeat, and the eastern troops being ready to be employed in an∣other way, are circumstances against the measure.</P>
<P>Agreeable to my expectation, the Virginia militia are gone: so that we have none now in aid of the continental troops, but those of the State mentioned in the return, and a few from Maryland. I do not know what can or will be done to obtain further reinforcements of them; but it appears to me, taking matters in any point of light, that fur∣ther aids should come from Virginia and Maryland: for, should we be able to accommodate the continental forces with clothes so as to carry on a winter campaign, their as∣sistance will be material, either to maintain a blockade, or in any decisive stroke we may attempt. And if they can∣not be so provided, and we should be obliged to retire into quarters, their service will be still more necessary to assist in covering the country against incursions for forage and pro∣visions. The militia of this State, themselves, supposing they should be tolerably vigorous in their exertions, will not be equal to the task: at least it will be difficult, if not impracticable, for them to do it. It is to be wished that such as can be drawn out may be engaged to serve three months, or two at least, (if it can be effected) after their arrival in camp; and that a mode could be adopted to sup∣ply their places with others at the expiration of their term, should the exigency o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our affairs require it. A time for their contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance should be fixed, or they will always be uneasy and pushing off; and the longer circumstances will admit it to be, the better; for, after the period recurs, for which they come, it will be impossible to retain them a mo∣ment. As to the number that should be required, it is dif∣ficult to determine: however, it is likely it will fall short of the requisition, as it ever has upon such occasions.</P>
<P>There is a report prevailing in camp, which has come through several channels, that a successful expedition has been made upon Rhode-Island, and eight hundred pris∣oners taken, with several pieces of artillery, and a large quantity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alt. I heartily wish it may be true: but at present it wants confirmation.</P>

Mr. Thompson's letter of the twenty-first ultimo, with its inclosures, came to hand yesterday. I join Congress most sincerely in congratulations on our important success in the surrender of general Burgoyne at the head of his forces, and am happy they have received a confirmation of the event from general Gates.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour to inclose you an extract of a letter from major general Dickinson, of the sixth instant, by which it appears that a reinforcement has sailed from New-York, either for general Howe or some other expe∣dition. I have not yet heard whether any of the troops on their march from the northward have yet crossed the North-river; but I hope they will be with me near as soon as general Howe's reinforcement can arrive at Phila∣delphia.</P>
<P>There was a heavy firing of cannon, all the day of the fifth, down the river; and in the evening some musketry was heard; from whence we concluded that an attack had been made upon Fort-Mifflin. But it turned out to be an attack made by general Varnum, with a twelve and an eigh∣teen-pounder fixed near Red-Bank, upon the enemy's ships. He thinks he damaged the Somerset of sixty-four guns con∣siderably, as she got on ground, and was for some time ex∣posed to his fire. The ships were obliged to quit their sta∣tions and fall lower down.</P>
<P>From a variety of accounts and circumstances, I am in∣duced to believe that the enemy are meditating a grand blow against Fort-Mifflin. I have put the place in as good a state of defence as my present numbers will admit, and have directed general Varnum to afford every further assist∣ance in his power. I therefore hope they will meet a warm reception whenever they make the attempt.</P>
<P>The military chest is again empty, and the army is un∣paid for the months of September and October,—besides the draughts that are requisite for the commissary and quar∣ter-master-general's department. You will therefore be
<PB N="189" REF="029737_0527_0FE29BB6478892D8"/>
pleased to direct a supply of cash to be sent on as expedi∣tiously as possible.</P>
<P>I fear, from a letter which I have lately received from gen∣eral Heath, that no proper measures are taken to put up a supply of salt provisions for next campaign, to the eastward. I have inclosed a copy of general Heath's letter to Mr. Buchanan, the commissary-general of purchases, and have desired him to have the matter looked into in time: but it is of so much importance to the very existence of the ar∣my, that I think it deserves the attention of Congress.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Camp at White-Marsh,</HI> <DATE><HI>November</HI> 10, 1777.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the fourth and fifth instant, with their several inclosures. Among those of the former, I found the resolution you are pleased to allude to, respecting your appointment as presi∣dent. Permit me, Sir, to congratulate you upon this event, and to assure you I have the most entire confidence that I shall experience in you during your presidency the same politeness, and attention to the interests of the States, that marked the conduct of your worthy predecessor.</P>
<P>With respect to the views of the navy-board for securing the frigates, the situation of the army would not admit of a compliance with them, supposing they would answer the end. I have therefore written to the board in the most pressing terms, to have the frigates scuttled in such way that they may be raised when it shall be necessary, and that in the mean time they may not be liable to injury from float∣ing ice. I see no measure so likely to secure them to us, and against the enemy's attempts. I have been extremely fearful they would have possessed and employed them, with the Delaware and their batteries, on the rear of the gallies and the fort, while the ships below attacked in front. I need not point out the probable consequences of such an event: they are too obvious.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="029737_0528_0FE29B37AD8DC228"/>
The resolves which you request to be communicated to the army shall be published in general orders. The let∣ters for commodore Hazelwood, &amp;c. have been put in a proper channel of conveyance.</P>
<P>As to the disposition of part of the northern army, my letter of the first, continued to the third, contains my ideas upon the subject, and those of my general officers. I shall be sorry if the measures I have taken on this head should interfere with or materially vary from any plans Congress might have had in view. Their proceedings of the fifth, I presume were founded on a supposition that the enemy were still up the North-river, and garrisoning the forts they had taken. This not being the case, and all accounts agreeing that reinforcements to general Howe are coming from York, I hope the aids I have required will be considered expedient and proper. Independent of the latter consideration, I think our exertions and force should be directed to effect general Howe's destruction, if it is possible.</P>
<P>Among the various difficulties attending the army, the adjustment of rank is not the least. This,—owing to the several modes, the several principles, that have prevailed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> granting commissions,—is involved in great perplexity. The officers of the Pennsylvania troops are in much con∣fusion about it: in many instances, those who were junior in rank, from local and other circumstances, have obtained commissions older in date than those which were granted afterwards to officers their superiors before. This with many other irregularities, has been and is the cause of great uneasiness: and, though precedency of rank so claim∣ed should not be supported in justice or upon any principle,—we find all, having the least pretext for the title, strenu∣ous to support it, and willing to hold a superiority. I was therefore induced to order a board of officers to take the matter under consideration. The result, respecting the field-officers of this State, I now inclose, and wish Con∣gress to adopt the regulation which the board have made, and to transmit me, by the earliest opportunity, commis∣sions dated according to their arrangement. At the same time it may be proper that there should be a resolve vacat∣ing the commissions they now have, and directing them to
<PB N="191" REF="029737_0529_0FE29BB960922668"/>
be delivered to me. Their attention to this business, I trust, will be immediate: the disputes and jealousies with the officers require it.</P>
<P>I have inclosed the memorial of colonel Portail and the other engineers for their promotion, referred to me by the board of war for my sentiments. As to the terms these gentlemen mentioned to have been proposed and agreed to when they first arrived, I know nothing of them further than the memorial states. In respect to their abilities and knowledge in their profession, I must observe they have had no great opportunity of proving them since they were in our service. However, I have reason to believe that they have been regularly bred in this important branch of war, and that their talents, which have been hitherto, as it were, dormant, want only a proper occasion to call them forth; in which case, I have no doubt they would do themselves honour and the States essential service. It is of great importance, too, to consider the practicability of replacing these gentlemen with persons equally qualified, if they should quit the service; and how indispensable men of skill in this branch of military science are to every army. While I am on this subject, I would take the liberty to mention that I have been well informed that the engineer in the northern army (Corieski, I think, his name is) is a gentleman of science and merit. From the character I have had of him, he is deserving of notice too.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to mention that we are in great dis∣tress for want of money. This will be more urgent every day: and it is probable there will be a good deal of pay due to the troops coming to reinforce us. General Putnam writes pressingly for a supply, and says, he is in a most dis∣agreeable situation for want of it. I must request the at∣tention of Congress to this subject.</P>
<P>Your favour of the seventh came to hand this morning. I shall pay proper attention to the inclosures. The rank of the officers of cavalry I will attempt to have settled as soon as circumstances will admit.</P>
<P>I have nothing very interesting to communicate. The enemy have lost one of their new floating-batteries: it sunk in a little time after it was launched. There has been a
<PB N="192" REF="029737_0530_0FE29B39917B6B08"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE condition of the army for want of clothes and blankets, and the little prospect we have of obtaining re∣lief, according to the information I have received from the board of war, occasion me to trouble you at this time. The mode of seizing and forcing supplies from the inhabitants, I fear, would prove very inadequate to the demands, while it would certainly embitter the minds of the people, and excite perhaps a hurtful jealousy against the army. I have had officers out for the purpose of purchasing and making voluntary collections of necessaries: and, in a few instances, more coercive measures have been exercised: but all these have proved of little avail: our distresses still continue, and are becoming greater. I would therefore humbly sub∣mit it to the consideration of Congress whether it may not be expedient for them to address the several legislative and executive powers of the States on this subject as early as possible, and in the most urgent terms. It appears to me, if they were to appoint, under the authority of Congress, proper active agents, that many necessaries might be pro∣cured in addition to those [<HI>purchased</HI>] on public account. Besides this, I think the exigency of our affairs requires that they should resolve on an immediate assessment to be made on the inhabitants. If these modes were adopted, considerable aids might be derived, and in a way much less exceptionable than that of seizing by the army. The as∣semblies in many States, I believe, are now sitting; and I have no doubt, upon a requisition by Congress, but they will give attention to the measure.</P>
<P>Inclosed you will receive a copy of a letter from general Putnam, which came to hand to-day. You will find his and governor Clinton's opinion respecting the fortifications necessary to be made for the security of the North-river. As soon as I heard that Warner's militia were coming down to reinforce me, I immediately wrote to countermand
<PB N="193" REF="029737_0531_0FE29BBAE3B3B988"/>
them, and directed that they should be retained to carry on the necessary works during the time they are to serve. My letter on this subject was on the ninth instant. As to the other troops, the propriety of bringing them here, I be∣lieve, is not to be questioned. We are told through vari∣ous channels that Sir Henry Clinton is coming round with all the force that can be possibly spared from New-York; and it is said that those on Staten-Island are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. It is added also that the inhabitants of the former are great∣ly alarmed and disgusted, and that general Tryon is call∣ing in the militia of Long-Island for the defence of the city. General Putnam's letter will also evince the neces∣sity there is for a large and immediate supply of money being sent to the pay-master-general.</P>
<P>I have also the honour to transmit you a copy of a re∣port by a board of general officers, on the subject of rations, which I submit to the consideration of Congress. The es∣tablishment and regulations which they propose appear to me to be just and necessary, supposing the commissary's es∣timate to be right, which I presume is the case, from the exorbitant price which has been and is now paid for every species of provision. The necessity of an alteration in the former value has been long urged by many officers; and for want of it, several, I believe, have left the service.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sorry to inform you that Fort-Mifflin was evacuated the night before last, after a defence which does credit to the American arms, and will ever reflect the
<PB N="194" REF="029737_0532_0FE29B3B174D1298"/>

The works were entirely beat down, every piece of can∣non dismounted, and one of the enemy's ships so near that she threw grenades into the fort, and killed men upon the platforms, from her tops, before they quitted the island. This ship had been cut down for the purpose, and so con∣structed that she made but a small draught of water, and by these means warped in between Fort-Mifflin and Province-Island. Some complaints are made that the captains of the galleys did not sufficiently exert themselves to drive this vessel from her station: but I shall not deter∣mine any thing upon the matter till a proper inquiry is made.</P>
<P>Nothing in the course of this campaign has taken up so much of the attention and consideration of myself and all the general officers, as the possibility of giving a further relief to Fort-Mifflin than what we had already afforded. Such a garrison was thrown into it as has been found by experience capable of defending it to the last extremity: and Red-Bank, which was deemed essentially necessary, not only for the purpose of keeping open the communication, but of annoying the enemy's ships and covering our own fleet, has been possessed by a considera∣ble detachment from this army. The only remaining and practicable mode of giving relief to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort was by dislodging the enemy from Province-Island, from whence they kept up an incessant fire. But this, from the situa∣tion of the ground, was not to be attempted with any de∣gree of safety to the attacking party, without the whole or a considerable part of the army should be removed to the west side of Schuylkill to support and cover it.</P>
<P>To account for this, you must be made acquainted with the nature of the ground. In order to have made the attack upon Province-Island, the party destined for that service, which should have been at least fifteen hundred, must have marched down the Chester road as far as the Bell inn near Derby, and thence, turning towards Del∣aware, must have proceeded about four miles further through a neck of land, to the island. The enemy have a bridge at the middle ferry upon Schuylkill, which is but four miles from the Bell inn: consequently, by throwing a body of men over that bridge upon the first discovery of
<PB N="195" REF="029737_0533_0FE29BBC66E14EE0"/>
our design, and marching down to the Bell, they would have effectually cut off our detachment upon their return. It is true the covering party might have consisted of a less number than the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e army: but then those remaining upon this side of the river would have been too few to have been entrusted with all the artillery and stores of the army, within twelve miles of the enemy.</P>
<P>There were many and very forcible reasons against a total remove to the west side of Schuylkill. Leaving all our stores at Easton, Bethlehem and Allentown uncov∣ered, and abandoning several of our hospitals within reach of the enemy, first presented themselves. Another, and, in my opinion, a more weighty reason than either of the preceding, was the importance of supporting the post at Red-Bank, upon which that of Fort-Mifflin in a great measure depended, as through it we sent in supplies of men, provision and ammunition. The enemy, sensible of this, endeavoured to dislodge us from Red-Bank on the twen∣ty-second of last month; which, as Congress have been informed, cost them four hundred men.</P>
<P>Now, had our army been on the west side of Schuylkill, they might, without any danger of an attack upon their lines, have thrown over so considerable a force into Jer∣sey, that they might have overpowered the garrison, and, by making themselves masters of it, have reduced Fort-Mifflin by famine or want of ammunition. Thus we should in all probability have lost both posts by one stroke. They might also, by taking possession of the fords upon Schuylkill, have rendered the junction of our northern reinforcements with us a very difficult, if not an imprac∣ticable matter: and, should any accident have happened to them, we should have stood a very poor chance of looking general Howe in the face through the winter with an inferior army. We should finally have thrown the ar∣my into such a situation, that we must inevitably have drawn on a general engagement before our reinforcements arrived; which, considering our disparity of numbers, would probably have ended with the most disagreeable consequences.</P>
<P>It was therefore determined a few days ago to wait the arrival of the reinforcement from the northward before
<PB N="196" REF="029737_0534_0FE29B3C9A4985D0"/>
any alteration could safely be made in the disposition of the army: and I was not without hopes that the fort would have held out till that time. That we might then have moved without endangering the stores, I had given orders for the removal of them, from the places before mentioned, to Lebanon and other places in Lancaster county, which is at any rate more safe and convenient than where they were.</P>
<P>As the keeping possession of Red-Bank, and thereby still preventing the enemy from weighing the chevaux-de-frise before the frost obliges their ships to quit the river, has become a matter of the greatest importance, I have determined to send down general St. Clair, general Knox, and baron Kalb, to take a view of the ground, and to en∣deavour to form a judgment of the most probable means of securing it. They will at the same time see how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is possible for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet to keep their station since the loss of Fort-Mifflin, and also make the proper inquiry into the conduct of the captains of the galleys, mentioned in the former part of this letter.</P>
<P>I am informed that it is matter of amazement, and that reflections have been thrown out against this army, for not being more active and enterprising than, in the opinion of some, they ought to have been. If the charge is just, the best way to account for it will be to refer you to the returns of our strength, and those which I can produce of the ene∣my, and to the inclosed abstract of the clothing now actual∣ly wanting for the army: and then I think the wonder will be, how they keep the field at all in tents at this season of the year. What stock the clothier-general has to sup∣ply this demand, or what are his prospects, he himself will inform you, as I have directed him to go to York-town to lay these matters before Congress. There are, besides, most of those in the hospitals more bare than those in the field: many remain there for want of clothes only.</P>
<P>Several general officers, unable to procure clothing in the common line, have employed agents to purchase up what could be found in different parts of the country. General Wayne, among others, has employed Mr. Zantzinger of Lancaster, who has purchased to the amount
<PB N="197" REF="029737_0535_0FE29BC7952957D8"/>
of four thousand five hundred pounds, for which he de∣sires a draught upon the treasury-board. Inclosed you have a copy of his letter. I am not clear whether this application should properly be made to the treasury, or the clothier-general, who should charge the money to the regiments for whom the clothes are, as so much advanced to them. If the latter should appear the most proper mode, I will order it to be done.</P>
<P>I am anxiously waiting the arrival of the troops from the northward, who ought, from the time they have had my orders, to have been here before this. Colonel Hamil∣ton, one of my aides, is up the North-river, doing all he can to push them forward: but he writes me word that he finds many unaccountable delays thrown in his way. However, I am in hopes that many days will not elapse before a brigade or two, at least, arrive. The want of these troops has embarrassed all my measures exceedingly.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the thirteenth and nineteenth instant with their inclosures. I am well assured Congress have not been inattentive to the necessities of the army; and that the deficiency in our supplies, particularly in the article of clothing, has arisen from the difficulty of importing, on account of the nume∣rous fleet that line our coast. However, I am persuaded that considerable relief might be drawn from the different States, were they to exert themselves properly. This I hope will be the case as soon as they receive the pressing recommendations of Congress upon the subject.</P>
<P>It has been the unvaried custom of the enemy, from the commencement of the present contest, to try every artifice and device to delude the people. The message through John Brown was calculated for this end. I am surprised Mr. Willing should suffer himself to be imposed on by
<PB N="198" REF="029737_0536_0FE29B496C8819C8"/>
such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>imsy measures. He knows that there is a plain, obvious way for general and lord Howe to communicate any proposals they wish to make, to Congress, without the intervention of a second and third hand. But this would not suit their views. I am sorry that Mr. Brown should be the bearer of the message; as, from the character I have had of him, he is a worthy, well-disposed man. It has been frequently mentioned that he had interested him∣self much in behalf of our prisoners, and had afforded them every relief and comfort his circumstances would allow him to give.</P>
<P>I have been endeavouring to effect an exchange of pris∣oners, from principles of justice, and from motives of hu∣manity: but at present I have no prospect of it. Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> general Howe has assured our officers it was his wish, and, if it could not be done, that he should readily agree to their release on parole. The inclosed copies of my let∣ters and his answer will shew Congress what has passed between us upon that subject; and at the same time, that I had remonstrated against the severe and cruel treatment of the prisoners, and proposed the plan of sending in a suit∣able person to inquire into the facts, before the receipt of their resolution. Their sufferings, I am persuaded, have been great, and shocking to humanity. I have called up∣on general Howe for redress, and an explicit answer to my letter of the fourteenth. If I do not receive one by to-morrow night, with the most positive and satisfactory assurances that a proper conduct shall be observed towards them in future, we must retaliate, however much we wish to avoid severity, and measures that bear the smallest ap∣pearance of rigour or inhumanity.</P>
<P>Inclosed you will receive a list of sundry officers who have been cashiered since the action of the fourth ultimo. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> that these examples will involve many favourable and beneficial consequences. Besides these, there were many more brought to trial, who were acquit∣ted; among them, general Maxwell, and general Wayne—the former for charges against him while he command∣ed the light troops,—the latter for charges against his conduct in the attack made on his division, in the night of the twentieth of September. The result of the court <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="199" REF="029737_0537_0FE29BC9267598A8"/>
inquiry against general Wayne not entirely exempting him from censure in his own opinion, he requested a court-martial; and, upon a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll and minute investigation of the charges against him, he was honourably acquitted, and in terms of high respect.</P>
<P>I am sorry to inform Congress that the enemy are now in possession of all the water defences. Fort-Mifflin and that at Red-Bank mutually depended on each other for support: and the reduction of the former made the tenure of the latter extremely precarious, if not impracticable. After the loss of Fort-Mifflin, it was found Red-Bank could derive no advantages from the galleys and armed vessels—(they could not maintain their station)—and, in case of investiture, the garrison could have no supplies, no retreat, nor any hope of relief, but such as might arise from a supe∣rior force acting without on the rear of the enemy, and dislodging them. Under these circumstances, the garrison was obliged to evacuate it on the night of the twentieth instant, on the approach of lord Cornwallis, who had cross∣ed the river from Chester with a detachment, supposed to be about two thousand men, and formed a junction with the troops lately arrived from New-York, and those that had been landed before at Billingsport.</P>
<P>From general Varnum's account, I have reason to hope that we saved most of the stores, except a few heavy can∣non: however, I cannot be particular in this instance. I am also to add, from the intelligence I have received, that most if not all the armed vessels have been burned by our own people, except the galleys, one brig, and two sloops, which are said to have run by the city. How far this might be founded in necessity, I am not able to determine; but I suppose it was done under that idea, and an apprehension of their falling into the enemy's hands if they attempted to pass up the river.</P>
<P>Upon the first information I had of lord Cornwallis's movement, I detached general Huntington's brigade to join general Varnum, and, as soon as possible, general Greene with his division; hoping that these,—with Glover's brig∣ade which was on the march through Jersey, and which I directed to file off to the left for the same purpose,—and with such militia as could be collected,—would be able to
<PB N="200" REF="029737_0538_0FE29D180C9B8DE8"/>
defeat the enemy's design, and to preserve the fort. But they were so rapid in their advances, that our troops could not form a junction and arrive in time to succour the gar∣rison; which obliged them to withdraw.</P>
<P>General Greene is still in Jersey; and when Glover's brigade joins him, if an attack can be made on lord Corn∣wallis with a prospect of success, I am persuaded it will be done. About a hundred and seventy of Morgan's corps are also gone to reinforce him.</P>
<P>Generals Poor and Patterson with their brigades, and colonel Bailey with Learned's, are now in camp. The last arrived on Friday evening, the other two in the course of yesterday. I have not yet obtained returns of their strength; but, from the accounts of the officers, they will amount in the whole to twenty-three or twenty-four hundred rank and file. But I find many of them are very deficient in the articles of shoes, stockings, breeches, and blankets. Besides these, about three hundred and fifty men,—detachments from Lee's, Jackson's, and Henley's regiments,—have joined me.</P>
<P>Yesterday evening the enemy burned several houses in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, and they have commit∣ted the most wanton spoil in many others.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday morning honoured with your fa∣vours of the twenty-second instant. I wish the measures Congress have adopted may effectually suppress the disturb∣ances in the western department. Should they prove suc∣cessful, and the savages and wicked deluded inhabitants re∣ceive a severe check, it is probable they will not be induc∣ed again to take part against us, or at least for some considerable time. Colonel Crawford set out yesterday evening, and will be with Congress, I expect, in the course of two or three days to take their commands.</P>
<P>I was much obliged by the foreign intelligence you were pleased to transmit me: it is agreeable and interesting; and I heartily wish there may be an early declaration of hostil∣ities
<PB N="201" REF="029737_0539_0FE29C22A7820F38"/>
between France and Britain. From these advices, things seem to be getting into a proper train for it: and it is not easily to be conceived that it can be much longer delayed. However, our expectations have not been an∣swered in this instance, and they may yet be held in sus∣pense. The political reasons, that lead to delay on the part of France, I do not perfectly understand. As to Britain, her honour is lost in the contest with us, and the most indignant insults will scarcely be able to draw her at∣tention from her present pursuits. The account of Mr. Lee having effected the purposes of his embassy at the court of Berlin is of great importance. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be true. In such case, administration, however desirous they may be, will probably be disappointed in their schemes of further mer∣cenary aids against us.</P>
<P>I must take the liberty to request the decision of Con∣gress on the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the nine first-raised Virginia regiments as early as circumstances will permit. If the plan proposed for re-enlisting them is judged expedient, one capital in∣ducement to that end, suggested by the officers, will cease if it is longer delayed. It is a matter of considerable im∣portance, and of which I wish to be satisfied as soon as pos∣sible. I should also be happy in their determination re∣specting the marquis De la Fayette. He is more and more solicitous to be in actual service, and is pressing in his appli∣cations for a command. I ventured before to submit my sentiments upon the measure; and I still fear a refusal will not only induce him to return in disgust, but may involve some unfavourable consequences. There are now some vacant divisions in the army, to one of which he may be appointed, if it should be the pleasure of Congress. I am convinced he possesses a large share of that military ardour which generally characterizes the nobility of his country. He went to Jersey with general Greene, and I find he has not been inactive there. This you will perceive by the following extract from a letter just received from general Greene.</P>
<P>"The marquis, with about four hundred militia and the rifle corps, attacked the enemy's piquet last evening, killed about twenty, wounded many more, and took about twenty prisoners. The marquis is charmed with the spirited
<PB N="202" REF="029737_0540_0FE1BFC7D0E7E950"/>
behaviour of the militia and rifle corps: they drove the en∣emy about half a mile, and kept the ground until dark. The enemy's piquet consisted of about three hundred, and were reinforced during the skirmish. The marquis is de∣termined to be in the way of danger."</P>
<P>* * * I must request you to transmit me a number of blank commissions as soon as you have an opportunity to do it. There are several vacancies yet to fill; and the officers entitled to them are anxious to be appointed. The commissions I want should be under your signature, and not Mr. Hancock's. I mention this, lest you should send any of the latter that might remain. Those signed by you will be competent to all cases: those by Mr. Hancock, only to such as happened during his presidency; and of these I have now some.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 27. Inclosed you will receive a copy of gen∣eral Howe's letter in answer to mine of the fourteenth and twenty-third, which only came to hand last night, and at an instant when I was giving the commissary of prisoners instructions forthwith to confine a number of the officers in our hands, and to put the privates under very different restrictions from those they have been used to. I am in hopes the treatment of ours will be much better in future. Mr. Boudinot will immediately take measures for releasing the officers on parole, that we may relieve an equal number of ours. I should have been happy to have effected a gen∣eral exchange, or a partial one: but general Howe will not upon any terms but those he has ever insisted on.</P>
<P>The enemy have got up several of their ships to the city. It is likely they have found a passage through the chevaux-de-frise, or they may have removed them.</P>

<P>ON Saturday I had the honour to receive your favour of the twenty-sixth ultimo, with its inclosures. The re∣solve of the twenty-fifth I have published in orders, agree∣able to direction, and shall be happy if Congress can fall upon measures to render the situation of the officers and
<PB N="203" REF="029737_0541_0FE29C242C9ED230"/>
soldiery more eligible than what it now is. At present it is truly distressing: and, unless some means can be devised to support them more comfortably, we shall have to appre∣hend the most alarming consequences. The officers, or at least a large proportion of them, as well as the men, are in a most disagreeable condition as to clothing, and without any certain prospect of relief: and, what is still more pain∣ful,—if perchance they have an opportunity of purchasing, (which is seldom the case) they have the mortification to find themselves totally incompetent to it, from the depre∣ciation of our money, and the exorbitant prices demanded for all articles in this way. This is the source of great uneasiness, of indifference to the service, and of repeated (I may say, daily) applications to leave it, and these too by as good officers as are in the American line.</P>
<P>In respect to promotions for merit and intrepidity, I would beg leave to observe, that, though these are proper considerations to found them upon, yet they should be made with the greatest caution and attention, and only in cases of the most eminent and distinguished services. Every pro∣motion or rise out of common course cannot fail to excite uneasiness in a greater or lesser degree: and nothing will reconcile them to the army at large, and particularly the officers more immediately affected by them, but where the causes are known and acknowledged. This I mention from my wishes to promote the public interest, from my knowing that harmony is essential to this end, and from no other motives whatever.</P>
<P>Before the receipt of your favour, I do not recollect to have heard of John Simper's case. His brother has not been with me. As soon as he arrives, I shall give direc∣tions for him to be released from his present confinement, and to be forwarded to Cecil county.</P>
<P>I have nothing material to inform you of. Lord Corn∣wallis and the detachment under his command (mentioned in my last) returned from Jersey on Thursday. We had reason to expect an attack since, from our advices from the city, but have been disappointed. General Greene has also joined me with all the troops that were with him, ex∣cept Huntington's brigade, which will be in to-day.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you, that, in the course of last week, from a variety of intelligence, I had reason to expect that general Howe was preparing to give us a general action. Accordingly, on Thursday night he moved from the city with all his force, except a very in∣considerable part left in his lines and redoubts,—and ap∣peared the next morning on Chesnut-hill, in front of, and about three miles distant from, our right wing. As soon as their position was discovered, the Pennsylvania militia were ordered from our right, to skirmish with their light advanced parties; and I am sorry to mention that briga∣dier-general Irvine who led them on had the misfortune to be wounded and to be made prisoner. Nothing more oc∣cured on that day.</P>
<P>On Friday night the enemy changed their ground, and moved to our left, within a mile of our line, where they remained quiet and advantageously posted the whole of the next day. On Sunday they inclined still further to our left; and, from every appearance, there was reason to ap∣prehend they were determined on an action. In this movement, their advanced and flanking parties were warm∣ly attacked by colonel Morgan and his corps, and also by the Maryland militia under colonel Gist. Their loss I cannot ascertain: but I am informed it was considerable, having regard to the number of the corps who engaged them. About sunset, after various marches and counter∣marches, they halted; and I still supposed, from their dis∣position and preceding manoeuvres, that they would attack us in the night or early the next morning: but in this I was mistaken.</P>
<P>On Monday afternoon they began to move again, and, instead of advancing, filed off from their right: and the first certain account that I could obtain of their intentions was, that they were in full march towards Philadelphia by two or three routes. I immediately detached light parties after them to fall upon their rear: but they were not able to come up with them.</P>
<P>The enemy's loss, as I have observed, I cannot ascer∣tain. One account from the city is that five hundred
<PB N="205" REF="029737_0543_0FE29C25AEF83B20"/>
wounded had been sent in: another is that eighty-two waggons had gone in with men in this situation. These, I fear, are both exaggerated, and not to be depended upon. We lost twenty-seven men in Morgan's corps, killed and wounded, besides major Morris, a brave and gallant officer, who is among the latter. Of the Maryland militia there were also sixteen or seventeen wounded. I have not re∣ceived further returns yet.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish that they had made an attack, as the issue, in all probability, from the disposition of our troops, and the strong situation of our camp, would have been for∣tunate and happy. At the same time I must add, that reason, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbad us quitting our post to attack them. Nothing but success would have justified the measure: and this could not be expected from their position.</P>
<P>The constant attention and watching I was obliged to give the enemy's movements would not allow me to write before: and this I believe was the less material, as I have reason to think your committee who were in camp most of the time, and who are now here, transmitted an account of such occurrences as they deemed important in any degree. The first cause too, Sir, and my engagements with the committee previous to the coming out of the enemy, will, I trust, sufficiently apologize for my not acknowledging be∣fore the honour of your favours of the thirtieth ultimo and the first instant, which came to hand in due order and time.</P>

<P>I YESTERDAY evening had the honour of your favour of the first instant, with its several inclosures.—The letter you allude to, from the committee of Congress and board of war, came to hand on Saturday morning: but it does not mention the regulations adopted for removing the difficulties and failures in the commissary line. I trust they will be vigorous, or the army cannot exist. It will never answer, to procure supplies of clothing or provision by coercive measures:—the small seizures made of the former a few days ago in consequence of the most pressing and absolute necessity,—when that, or to dissolve, was the alternative,—excited the greatest alarm and uneasiness even among our best and warmest friends. Such procedures may give a momentary relief; but, if repeated, will prove of the most pernicious consequence. Besides spreading disaffection, jealousy, and fear in the people, they never fail, even in the most veteran troops under the most rigid and exact discipline, to raise in the solidery a disposition to licentiousness, to plunder and robbery,—difficult to sup∣press afterwards, and which has proved not only ruinous to the inhabitants, but, in many instances, to armies them∣selves. I regret the occasion that compelled us to the measure the other day; and shall consider it among the greatest of our misfortunes, if we should be under the ne∣cessity of practising it again.</P>

<P>The proceedings of Congress for the detention of gen∣eral Burgoyne and army, or rather suspending their em∣barkation, till the convention of Saratoga is explicitly ratified and notified by the court of Britain, shall re∣main secret here till they are duly announced by Con∣gress. This procedure, when known to the general, will chagrin him much: for I learn by a letter from general Heath, that the refusal to let his troops embark at Rhode-Island or in the Sound had given him some uneasiness. I have nothing of importance to communicate; and have only to add that</P>

<P>P. S. The great diversity of opinions prevailing, as to the operation which the resolves of the thirtieth ultimo and first instant should have, which give a month's extra pay, makes it necessary for me to request Congress to describe with certainty and precision the persons whom they intend∣ed should be the particular objects of their benevolence.
<PB N="208" REF="029737_0546_0FE29BD4945D9F80"/>
Without this, I am certain I shall not be able to execute the resolves according to their intention, and in a manner that will be agreeable to the army.</P>
<P>If such officers and men as were in camp when the re∣solves were passed, and who continue the whole winter, are the only objects to be benefited, it is urged that many who have discharged their duty with fidelity,—who have ex∣perienced a severe campaign to that time or till a few days before,—who may be now out of camp, and yet be here in the course of the winter,—will be excluded. For ex∣ample, all officers and men on furlough, though they should have been long from their homes before,—perhaps much longer, in many instances, than many who remain,—and whose private and family necessities oblige them to be ab∣sent,—those who have fallen sick from their services, and who are in hospitals or the country,—detachments on com∣mand,—these would be excluded. Such discriminations, I believe, will give great disgust and uneasiness. It is dif∣ficult, in cases of this nature, to draw a proper line of dis∣tinction, and impossible to do it in such a way as to give satisfaction.</P>
<P>I do not mean to enlarge upon the subject: my only wish is to have it precisely ascertained who are to be in∣cluded and paid, and who are not, under the resolves, that I may not on the one hand act contrary to public inten∣tion, and on the other give cause of complaint, and perhaps do wrong to individuals.</P>
<P>Knowing the difficulty of drawing a proper line, and the disgust and murmurings that ever attend discrimina∣tions,—were I to advise upon the subject, only such officers and men should be excluded (since extra pay has been de∣termined on) as are absent from camp without regular authority, or such as may abuse indulgencies regularly obtained.</P>
<P>It has been observed by some, and perhaps with pro∣priety, that there are officers and men now in camp, or who may be shortly in, who have no superior claim to merit,—whose affairs are not so pressing, or who have al∣ready had indulgencies,—or who, from their being nearer their friends and connexions, have had opportunities of seeing them frequently, of ordering their concerns, and
<PB N="209" REF="029737_0547_0FE29C3217412BB8"/>
visiting their homes once, twice, or perhaps oftener in the campaign, whilst they who were more remote were precluded from any of these advantages, and were constantly on duty. These considerations will have their weight in the scale of disgust with the parties interested. For my part, though the resolves were founded in principles of generosity,—were intended to reward merit, and promote the service,—from the difficulties attending the execution, I wish they had never been made, especially as I believe officers and men would in a little time have become tolerably well rec∣onciled to their quarters.</P>

<P>AS I do not recollect with precision whether any, or what resolutions have been made by Congress respecting captures by the army or detachments of it, and not having all their proceedings with me, with which I have been hon∣oured from time to time, to assist my inquiries upon the subject,—I must take the liberty to request that they will determine, and favour me with their decisions upon, the following points:</P>
<P N="1">1. What articles captured are to be considered as pub∣lic property?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether articles captured by parties or detach∣ments, not determined public property, are to be distrib∣uted or sold for the benefit of the army at large, or are to be considered as the sole and exclusive right of the captors?</P>
<P N="3">3. If, in general instances, such articles as are taken, and which are not considered public property, are deter∣mined to be the sole and exclusive right of the captors,—are stationary detachments, who, from their situation, have much more than a common chance of making prizes, to be considered upon the same footing?</P>
<P N="4">4. If there is to be a distinction between stationary and other detachments,—and the former are denied an exclusive right to the captures they make,—what propor∣tion of the articles are they to have?</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029737_0548_0FE29BD767487520"/>
I have been induced to state the above questions on ac∣count of some difficulties that have arisen respecting the prize taken by the detachment at Wilmington under gen∣eral Smallwood, that the same may be determined, and certain principles established, to govern in like and future cases. In the instance of this prize, as the baggage taken (from general Smallwood's and the officers' representa∣tion) will be but inconsiderable when divided among them∣selves, I have consented that they shall have it at a just appraisement and distribution, and have directed him to have the whole, and the value, properly inventoried, that such order may be made respecting the latter as the de∣cisions of Congress may justify and point out. I have also directed the sale of the brig, as I understand some offers have been made for her, and as her situation may be considered hazardous and precarious.</P>
<P>Besides the brig taken at Wilmington, a vessel has stranded at Reedy-Island with goods on board. It is said a quantity of rum, some bales of cloth, a number of hats, and some other articles (all wanted by the army) have been taken out of her by the militia, particularly those of Kent county. These general Smallwood is endeavouring to find, that they may be of public benefit.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered to you by the chevalier De Mauduit du Plessis, who was among the first French officers that joined the army of the United States. The gallant conduct of this young gentleman at Brandywine, German∣town, and his distinguished services at Fort-Mercer where he united the offices of engineer and commandant of artil∣lery, entitle him to the particular notice of Congress. He made several judicious alterations in the works at Red-Bank, shewed great good conduct during the action in which the Hessians were repulsed, and was spoken of, in conse∣quence, in terms of the highest applause, by the command∣ing officer of the post. After the evacuation was deter∣mined upon, he became the means of saving some valuable

artillery and stores, and cheerfully undertook, as volunteer, the hazardous operation of blowing up the magazine, &amp;c. without the apparatus usually provided upon such occasions. I must further add in monsieur Du Plessis' favour, that he possesses a degree of modesty not always found in men who have performed brilliant actions. It is with pleasure there∣fore that I recommend it to Congress to grant him a brevet of lieutenant-colonel,—a reward due to his merit, and which will not have the inconvenience of occasioning any dissatisfaction in the corps to which he belongs.</P>
<P>As some particular circumstances have prevented mon∣sieur Du Plessis waiting upon Congress sooner, I hope there will be no difficulty in antedating the brevet, so that the recompense may more immediately follow the services which he has done. At the same time, that there may not be any uneasiness on the part of monsieur Fleury, whom Congress have been pleased to reward in the same way and as their times of service are nearly equal in France, I would propose that monsieur Du Plessis' bre∣vet should bear the same date, viz. the twenty-sixth of November.</P>

<P>P. S. I wish a supply of money to be sent as soon as possible. Our distresses for want of it are not easily to be described. What Mr. Palfrey brought with him was not sufficient to pay the troops for November, by two hundred and fifty or three hundred thousand dollars. The de∣mands were immense, most of the eastern troops having had four or five months' pay due to them, and some, more. The army now in general has three months' pay in arrear, exclusive of the month's extra pay; and, besides this, the quarter-master is pressing for large draughts for the pur∣poses of his department, though he has received a propor∣tion of the money which came with Mr. Palfrey.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favour of the third instant, and with its inclosure.</P>
<P>As general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal's late severe illness and present feeble state will not permit him to proceed on the intended excursion into Canada, baron De Kal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will follow the marquis agreeable to his wish and the direction of Congress.</P>
<P>According to the promise contained in my last, I take the liberty of transmitting you copies of such letters as have lately passed between general Howe and myself.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 12. Since writing the above, I have received another letter from general Howe, of the fifth instant, a copy of which, and of my answer, you have also inclosed. By these you will perceive that he has proposed a general exchange of prisoners, and that I have acceded to it. I have written to Mr. Boudinot, commissary in this line, re∣quiring his return to camp; and shall give him direction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pursue the most speedy measures for accomplishing this business, so interesting to the unhappy officers and men in general Howe's hands, and to the cause of humanity. There are some other matters, as you will discover, which I could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon.</P>
<P>The situation of the affairs of the army has not till lately made it convenient to go into the inquiry directed by the resolve of the twenty-eighth of November, of the losses of the Forts Montgomery and Clinton in the State of New-York, and of Fort-Mifflin on Delaware. With respect to the two former, it happens that almost all the principal officers acting in that quarter were in some way or other so far concerned in the affair, as to make them improper for prosecuting the inquiry. I therefore propose to send officers from this army. If his health will permit, I should wish general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal to preside. His thorough knowledge of those posts and all their connexions qualifies him in a peculiar manner for the purpose. I have written to him on the subject.</P>
<P>With respect to Fort-Mifflin, the inquiry involves very extensive considerations, and, more or less, affects almost all the general officers in this army, whose advice and con∣currence in the measures taken make them in some degree

parties. The mode, in my opinion, most unexceptionable to be pursued, is for Congress to authorise a committee of their own body, or to delegate any other persons they may choose to entrust, not connected with the operations of this army, to go into the business.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 14. Your several favours of the seventh, and that of the eighth instant, were duly received yesterday evening. As soon as circumstances will admit, I shall appoint a court-martial in the case directed, and shall no∣tify the parties concerned of the same. The oath, which Congress have prescribed to be taken by the officers of the army, I shall publish in general orders, and the mode how it is to be done, with directions about the certificates. I shall extend colonel Dyer's furlough to the first of April, as required.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the honour of your sev∣eral favours of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first instant, which, with their respective inclosures, have been duly received.</P>
<P>In compliance with the resolution of Congress of the fifth instant, transmitted in your letter of the seventh, I was about to take measures for appointing a court-martial and bringing on the trials which they direct. But on recur∣ring to the papers you were pleased to send me, I do not find that the committee have made any particular charges against the officers who are to be the objects of trial. It was probably the intention of Congress that these charges should be laid by me. But as I might err in doing it, and not fully correspond with their views in the matter, especially as it would require considerable time and thought to make myself sufficiently acquainted with it from the pa∣pers collected, I should think it would be most adviseable for Congress to state explicitly the charges they wish to have exhibited against the officers respectively; and then the business may be proceeded on with propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="029737_0553_0FE29C406DBD4E08"/>
Besides the above reasons which operate generally against my exhibiting the charges, in the particular instance of general Schuyler, it is impossible for me to do it, as I do not know what instructions he had received from Congress from time to time as to the objects of his command, nor precisely what these were. These appear to me necessary to be known, and essential to carry on a prosecution against him.</P>
<P>When Congress shall have arranged these points, and are pleased to honour me with them, I will pursue the speediest measures to bring on the trials. The sooner this can be done, the better, as some of the parties are extreme∣ly anxious, and strongly importune it.</P>
<P>Baron Steuben has arrived at camp. He appears to be much of a gentleman, and, as far as I have had an oppor∣tunity of judging, a man of military knowledge, and ac∣quainted with the world.</P>
<P>The inclosed extract of a letter from general Putnam will shew how great the distresses are in that quarter for want of money. He has described their necessities so ful∣ly, that it is unnecessary for me to add upon the subject: I shall only observe that his account is more than justified by many other letters, and that I am persuaded the earliest possible supply will be forwarded, that the very important and interesting works carrying on there may not be the least retarded.</P>
<P>I am under some embarrassments respecting the thir∣teenth Virginia regiment. It was raised on the west side of the Allegany and towards Pittsburg, with assurances from the officers, it is said, that the men should not be drawn from that quarter. This circumstance, added to the disturbances by the Indians, and the exposed situation of their families, has been the cause of great desertions, and is at present the source of much uneasiness, and the more so, as part of the regiment was never marched from thence. I think the whole should be united either here or there, and wish Congress to direct me upon the subject. At the same time that their case, if truly represented, seems to be hard, and to merit the indulgence they claim, I would observe that the twelfth regiment from the west∣ern parts of the same State, and the eighth and twelfth
<PB N="216" REF="029737_0554_0FE29BE2A1112238"/>
Pennsylvania from the frontier counties of this, have similar pretensions, and might become uneasy, and apply for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> indulgence.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the directions of Congress, I shall send a major-general to Rhode-Island, though the number of offi∣cers here of this rank, from one cause and another, is greatly reduced, and more so than it ought to be in point of policy.</P>
<P>Our loss of matrosses, the last campaign, in killed and wounded, was considerable; and it has not been a little increased this winter by desertions from colonel Proctor's corps. From these circumstances, we are very weak in this line; and I request that Congress will be pleased to order colonel Harrison's regiment of artillery to march from Virginia as early as the roads will admit, and join this army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the liberty of transmitting you copies of three letters from general Howe, of the fourteenth and twenty-first ultimo, and of the second instant, with their inclosures. The unhappy violation of the flag of truce has laid us under no small embarrassments, and has afford∣ed the enemy good grounds for complaint and triumph at the same time. This however is the natural consequence, and must ever be the case, where different powers counter∣act each other in matters of the most delicate importance. There are some circumstances attending this affair, which it may possibly be in the power of Congress to throw light upon. If they can, I shall be obliged by their assistance.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 8. In consequence of the letters which have lately passed between general Howe and myself, particu∣larly those of the fifth and tenth ultimo, copies of which I had the honour to transmit you in mine of the eighth, continued to the fourteenth, I was about to send com∣missioners to meet those appointed by general Howe for adjusting the disputed points between us, carrying into ex∣ecution an exchange of prisoners, and improving the old
<PB N="217" REF="029737_0555_0FE29C41F02D6B78"/>
cartel, as far as it might be practicable, for their better ac∣commodation in future. This meeting was to be on the tenth instant: but, yesterday morning, Dunlap's paper of the fourth being put into my hands, I found that a reso∣lution had been made the twenty-sixth of February, calling for all accounts against prisoners in our hands, and declar∣ing that no exchange should take place, till the balance due thereon to the United States is discharged. Some of the States are not required to exhibit their claims till the first of June. The time that would be taken to adjust them, and make a delivery of the prisoners, would more than exhaust all the ensuing summer.</P>
<P>This resolution I cannot consider as an intended infrac∣tion of my engagements with general Howe: yet its op∣eration is diametrically opposite both to the spirit and letter of the propositions made on my part, and acceded to on his. I supposed myself fully authorised "by the instruc∣tions and intentions" of Congress to act as I did: and I now conceive that the public as well as my own personal honour and faith are pledged for the performance.</P>
<P>By the direction of Congress, I in the first instance stipulated with general Howe an exchange of prisoners,—officer for officer, of equal rank,—soldier for soldier,—and citizen for citizen. This agreement they have ever approved, and repeatedly declared their willingness to carry into execution. Their resolution of the twenty-fourth of March last empowered me (on condition of general Lee being declared exchangeable) not only <HI>"to proceed"</HI> to the exchange of prisoners according to the principles and regulations of the cartel before agreed on, but also to enter, into such further principles and regulations as should ap∣pear to me most proper and advantageous. A subsequent resolution of the sixth of June holds forth the same lan∣guage, sanctions my conduct and reasonings in the nego∣ciations about that time on the subject, and directs an ad∣herence to them. No event has occurred since that period, by which I could conclude there was any alteration in the views of Congress:—so far from it, that all my late let∣ters breathing the same spirit with the former, and pointedly signifying my wish to bring about a general exchange, if not with an express, at least met with a tacit approbation.
<PB N="218" REF="029737_0556_0FE29BE577307AA0"/>
General Howe at length, by profession, if not in reality, is willing to perform the agreement on the conditions re∣quired by me, and confirmed by them.</P>
<P>It may be said, that, with whatever powers I was orig∣inally vested to negociate an exchange, the resolution of the nineteenth of December last was an abridgment of them, so far as to annex a new condition,—the settlement and payment of accounts previous to its taking place. I had no conception of this being the case in the present in∣stance, however the letter may warrant the construction. Besides the common principle of preventing the inconven∣iences necessarily resulting from allowing the enemy to make their payments in paper currency, I had reason to imagine that general Burgoyne's army was more particularly the object of the concluding clause. This interpretation I the more readily adopted; for, exclusive of the affairs of that army, I verily believed, that, from the confused defective state of our accounts relating to prisoners, there would be a considerable balance in favour of Mr. Howe. Nor was the situation of our accounts the only reason for this belief: the prisoners in our hands, especially those westward of the Delaware, as I am informed, have been in a great measure supported by their own labour, and at the expense of the enemy, who have had agents constantly among us. If this is the case, the reason of the resolve not applying, the effect ought not of course.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may be thought contrary to our interest to go into an exchange, as the enemy would derive more immediate advantage from it than we should. This I shall not deny: but it appeared to me, that, on principles of genuine, extensive policy, independent of the considerations of compassion and justice, we were under an obligation not to elude it. I have the best evidence that an event of this kind is the general wish of the country: I know it to be the wish of the army; and no one can doubt that it is the ardent wish of the unhappy sufferers themselves. We need only consult the tide of humanity, and the sympathies natural to those connected by the cements of blood, inter∣est, and a common dread of evil, to be convinced that the prevailing current of sentiment demands an exchange. If the country, the army, and even the prisoners themselves,
<PB N="219" REF="029737_0557_0FE29C4372166340"/>
had a precise idea of our circumstances, and could be fully sensible of the disadvantages that might attend the giving our enemy a considerable reinforcement without having an equivalent, they might perhaps be willing to make a sacri∣fice of their feelings to the motives of policy. But they have not this knowledge, and cannot be entrusted with it; and their reasonings, of necessity, will be governed by what they feel.</P>
<P>Were an opinion once to be established (and the enemy and their emissaries know very well how to inculcate it, if they are furnished with a plausible pretext) that we de∣signedly avoided an exchange, it would be a cause of dis∣satisfaction and disgust to the country and to the army,—of resentment and desperation to our captive officers and sol∣diers: to say nothing of the importance of not hazarding our national character but upon the most solid grounds, es∣pecially in our embryo state, from the influence it may have on our affairs abroad; it may not be a little dangerous to beget in the minds of our own countrymen a suspicion that we do not pay the strictest observance to the maxims of honour and good faith.</P>
<P>It is prudent to use the greatest caution not to shock the notions of general justice and humanity, universal among mankind, as well in a public as a private view. In a busi∣ness on the side of which the passions are so much con∣cerned as in the present, men would be readily disposed to believe the worst, and cherish the most unfavourable con∣clusions. Were the letters that have passed between gen∣eral Howe and myself from first to last, and the proceed∣ings of Congress on the same subject, to be published with proper comments, it is much to be feared, if the exchange should be deferred till the terms of the last resolve were fulfilled, that it would be difficult to prevent our being generally accused with a breach of good faith. Perhaps it might be said, that, while the enemy refused us justice, we fondly embraced the opportunity to be loud, perse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ering, incessant in our claims; but the moment they were willing to render it, we receded from ourselves, and started new difficulties. This, I say, might be the reasoning of spec∣ulative minds; and they might consider all our professions
<PB N="220" REF="029737_0558_0FE29BE6F8F417E8"/>
as <HI>mere</HI> professions; or, at best, that interest and policy were to be the only arbiters of their validity.</P>
<P>Imputations of this nature would have a tendency to unnerve our operations, by diminishing that respect and confidence which are essential to be placed in those who are at the head of affairs either in the civil or military line. This, added to the prospect of hopeless captivity, would be a great discouragement to the service. The ill conse∣quences of both would be immense,—by increasing the causes of discontent in the army, which are already too numerous, and many of which are in a great measure un∣avoidable,—by fortifying that unwillingness which already appears too great, towards entering into the service, and of course impeding the progress both of draughting and re∣cruiting,—by dejecting the courage of the soldiery, from an apprehension of the horrors of captivity,—and finally by reducing those, whose lot it is to drink the bitter cup, to a despair which can only find relief by renouncing their attachments and engaging with their captors. These ef∣fects have already been experienced in part from the obsta∣cles that have lain in the way of exchanges: but if these obstacles were once to seem the result of system, they would become ten-fold. Nothing has operated more dis∣agreeably upon the minds of the militia than the fear of captivity, on the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting it has hitherto stood. What would be their reasonings, if it should be thought to stand-upon a worse?</P>
<P>If a present temporary interest is to be a ruling principle, it is easy to prove that an exchange can never take place. The constitution of our army in respect to the term of service for which our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> engage, and the dependence we are obliged to place on the militia, must forever operate against us in exchanges, and forbid an equality of advantages. Should it be said that there are times when it might be more peculiarly unequal and injurious, and that the present is such on account of the week condition of our army,—I answer that the delay necessarily involved in the previous negocia∣tion on the subject, in delivering the prisoners from time to time in small numbers and receiving others in their stead, and the mode of delivery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> different places, will nearly bring the matter to the point we could wish, and give us

leisure to reinforce this army, (if it is to be done at all) so as to obviate in a great measure the ill consequences apprehended.</P>
<P>But if the argument of interest on a partial scale be pur∣sued as far as it will go, not only the general consideration thrown out above, but special ones apposite to every situa∣tion, will present themselves, that we ought not to exchange: now we ought not, because our army is weak!—when the season is more advanced, and it is time for the campaign to open, we ought not, because our army may be strong, and it will be our business to avail ourselves of our own strength and the enemy's weakness, to strike some decisive blow!—if they, by the protection of their shipping and impregnable works, should be able to baffle our attempts till the period of reinforcements from Europe arrive, it will surely then not be our interest to add numbers and strength to an enemy already sufficiently numerous and strong!—Thus, by a par∣ity of reasoning, the golden era will never come, which is to relieve the miseries of captivity. Our service must be∣come odious: those who are out of it will endeavour to keep so; and those who are in it will wish to get out of it: every prisoner the enemy makes will be his soldier rather than submit to a rigorous and despairing confinement.</P>
<P>If we do not seize the present propitious moment when the necessities of the enemy press them to reasonable terms, to form and establish a liberal cartel, it is not impossible, in the vicissitudes and reverses of war, that a time may come when we should wish we had embraced it, and interest may strongly impel the enemy to decline it, except on the most unequal conditions. True policy, as well as good faith, in my opinion, binds us to improve the occasion.</P>
<P>There are however some ambiguities in general Howe's conduct, which require explanation, and ought to put us upon our guard. I determined to make the affair of citi∣zens,—viz. to procure an exemption from captivity for them, if possible,—or, if not, (since it cannot now be de∣manded as a matter of right) to fix their exchangeability upon the easiest and most unequivocal foundation,—an in∣dispensable preliminary to any further procedure; and at the same time to secure the exchange of general Lee and all
<PB N="222" REF="029737_0560_0FE29BE87AE871C0"/>
other officers who have been the particular objects of exception.</P>
<P>The interview intended between general Howe's com∣missioners and those on our part on the tenth instant is now postponed. I cannot doubt that Congress, in preservation of the public faith and my personal honour, will remove all impediments that now oppose themselves to my engagements, and that they will authorise me, through commissioners ap∣pointed for the purpose, to negociate a more extensive and competent cartel, upon such principles as may appear ad∣vantageous and founded in necessity,—any resolutions here∣tofore to the contrary notwithstanding; and I must request that they will favour me with their answer by the earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>The work, from its nature, will be difficult. Two par∣ties are concerned, whose interests are more than opposite in a common view. We shall endeavour to act for the best, and to promote the public service as far as possible, though we may not be able to answer the expectations of all. But it should be remembered, that, although general Howe's want of men affords a prospect of favourable terms, yet he will not be disposed to sacrifice to it all considerations of general advantage in a contract of such a nature; and it is not even to be hoped that it can take place except on princi∣ples of mutual benefit.</P>
<P>I persuade myself that the freedom I have taken in de∣livering my sentiments so fully upon this occasion will rea∣dily be excused, as it proceeds from a desire to place the motives of my conduct in a just point of view, and from an opinion of duty that led me to a free discussion of a subject, which, considered in all its lights, will appear to compre∣hend consequences of the first delicacy and magnitude.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been this day favoured with yours of the twenty-seventh of February, and of the second, third, and fourth instant, which I shall answer in their order.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="029737_0561_0FE29C4F65D64B68"/>
The removal of so valuable a train of field artillery from. Albany to Farmington, as to a place of greater security, was certainly a measure highly proper; and you may be assured that every precaution shall be taken to escort them safely through Jersey to this camp, when it is thought ad∣viseable to bring them hither.</P>
<P>You mistook the intent of mine of the eighteenth of February. I did not mean to give you the trouble of mak∣ing a return of the British officers who were exchanged af∣ter the convention. General R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idesel, as I informed you, wrote to me to obtain liberty for him to make an exchange of some of his suit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and other foreign officers, as that liber∣ty had been allowed to the British. I did not choose to give him any answer until I had applied to you, that I might know whether you had any reason for making such distinction: and as you misapprehended me, I shall still be obliged to defer answering him till I hear from you. I think, considering the great number of officers of ours who are in captivity, it is our interest to exchange as many of their officers, prisoners under the convention, as we can.</P>
<P>Commissioners from me are to meet others from general Howe on the thirty-first of this month, to endeavour to settle a general exchange of prisoners. Until we know the issue of the negociation, it will be hardly worth while to alter the situation of the prisoners in Lancaster county.</P>
<P>On the twenty-seventh of February I had occasion to write to Congress, on the subject of yours of the third. It was occasioned by a representation from the colonel of the thirteenth Virginia regiment which was raised (as colonel M<SUP>c</SUP>Kay's and Cooke's were) to remain upon the frontier. Were this the case with only one regiment, I should not hesitate, considering the face of affairs to the westward, to order it immediately to Fort-Pitt or the neighbourhood. But the eighth and twelfth Pennsylvania, and the twelfth and thirteenth Virginia, all claim the same right; and if the indulgence is granted to one, the others will be dissat∣isfied: and to spare them all at this time is impossible.</P>
<P>To regain the deserters from those regiments is certainly a very desirable thing: and the mode you point out is the most probable. But I fear, if those men who are now here find that the deserters are not to be brought down to join
<PB N="224" REF="029737_0562_0FE29BF2EA577658"/>
their regiments in camp, that they may be induced to go off, in hopes of obtaining the same terms. I confess I am much embarrassed by this matter, and shall be exceedingly glad to have the advice and assistance of Congress and the board upon the subject, before I come to any determination. It is an evil that will ever result from enlistments for local purposes, when it is not convenient to abide by the agree∣ment.</P>
<P>I shall immediately transmit the papers, inclosed in yours of the fourth, to general Howe.</P>

<P>P. S. Several instances having occurred, in which of∣ficers have drawn clothing from the clothier-general, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being entitled to it,—I shall be glad, if any applications are made to the board in future, that they will never give orders to any but such as bring testimonials from the brig∣adier or officer commanding the brigade they belong to.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday night I had the honour to receive your favours of the first and fifth instant, with their inclosures.</P>
<P>I am happy to find that my past conduct respecting citi∣zens, in the correspondence between general Howe and myself, is approved by Congress. They may rest assured that their rights are strongly impressed on my mind; and that, in all my transactions, every support in my power shall be given them. I know their importance; and, in my ex∣pected negociations with general Howe, if possible, I will exempt citizens from captivity. However, I cannot hope to effect it, as I cannot demand it as a matter of right, since Congress themselves, in their original resolve directing a proposition to be made for the exchange of prisoners, mentioned that of citizens,—which implied a right of cap∣turing them.</P>
<P>They may also be assured that general Lee will not be forgotten. He has all along been a principal object in dis∣pute: and, so far from doing any thing injurious to him, his
<PB N="225" REF="029737_0563_0FE29C50E9915B80"/>
right to be exchanged, and his releasement, are intended to be placed upon the most explicit, unambiguous footing. Indeed, from the spirit of general Howe's letters collective∣ly taken, since his agreement to enlarge the officers on pa∣role in the first instance, and his extension of it in the last to an exchange,—though they are not free from ambigui∣ties,—it may be inferred, that, on sending in lieutenant-col∣onel Campbell and the Hessian field-officers captured at Trenton, an exchange of all officers will immediately com∣mence. It seems to be a point with him that it shall be∣gin with them, as they have been longest in captivity. I have taken the liberty to inclose you copies of three letters which have just passed between general Howe and myself, more particularly concerning general Lee, in which I have pushed matters respecting him as far as I thought it pru∣dent at this time. Every precaution will certainly be used to prevent the enemy gaining any advantage in the ex∣change of prisoners.</P>
<P>With great deference, I would take the liberty to ob∣serve that Congress seem to have carried the preamble of their resolve of the twenty-sixth ultimo, prohibiting the en∣listing, &amp;c. prisoners and deserters, too far; and, through accident, to have recited a fact that has never happened (at least to my knowledge) and which is injurious to us,—viz. that prisoners had been enlisted by us. If any have, it is what I never knew. However, be this as it may, if the resolution has not been published, I could wish the preamble to be altered, and only to recite, <HI>"that experience,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>deserters"</HI> only. The resolution itself may stand as it does, comprehending a prohibition against the en∣listment of both.</P>
<P>My reason for troubling Congress upon this occasion is, we have always complained against general Howe, and still do, for obliging or permitting the prisoners in his hands to enlist, as an unwarrantable procedure, and wholly re∣pugnant to the spirit at least of the cartel. This preamble seems to admit the practice on our part, which would cer∣tainly justify it in him, and is such evidence as must silence us in future, (should it stand) and afford him an opportu∣nity for recrimination,—though, as I have suggested, I be∣lieve
<PB N="226" REF="029737_0564_0FE29BF4A596C998"/>
no prisoners have ever been enlisted by us,—I am sure none have through compulsion.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to transmit you an extract of a letter from captain Barry, which will inform you of his successes. The two ships he burned after stripping them; and he was obliged, it seems, two days after the capture, to ground and abandon the schooner, after a long and severe engagement with some of the enemy's frigates and smaller armed vessels. It is said he saved her guns and most of her tackle.</P>
<P>I also take the liberty to lay before Congress copies of letters from messieurs Champion, W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dsworth, and Reed. From the uniformity of sentiment held forth by these gen∣tlemen, it is much to be feared the measures lately adopted by the commissioners at New-Haven, for regulating the prices of provision, will have a disagreeable effect upon our supplies of meat. How far it may be practicable to sus∣pend their operation for a time, I cannot determine: but, if it can be done, it appears we should experience many ad∣vantages from it. It is a matter of great importance; and, as such, is submitted to Congress for their consideration. If any thing can be done to procure supplies of provision, particularly of the salt kind, I should suppose, and am per∣suaded, it will not be omitted.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be presented to you by count Pulaski, who, from a conviction that his remaining at the head of the cavalry was a constant subject of uneasiness to the prin∣cipal officers of that corps, has been induced to resign his command. Waving a minute inquiry into the causes of dissatisfaction,—which may be reduced perhaps to the dis∣advantages under which he laboured, as a stranger not well acquainted with the language, genius and manners of this country,—it may be sufficient to observe, that the degree of harmony which is inseparable from the well-being and consequent utility of a corps, has not subsisted in the cavalry since his appointment, and that the most effectual as well
<PB N="227" REF="029737_0565_0FE29C526C6A4CE0"/>
as the easiest remedy is that which he has generously applied.</P>
<P>The count, however, far from being disgusted with the service, is led by his thirst of glory, and zeal for the cause of liberty, to solicit farther employment, and waits upon Congress to make his proposals. They are briefly that he be allowed to raise an independent corps composed of sixty-eight horse and two hundred foot,—the horse to be armed wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h lances, and the foot equipped in the manner of light infantry. The former he thinks he can readily fill with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ives of good character and worthy the trust reposed in them. With respect to the other, he is desirous of more latitude, so as to have liberty of engaging prisoners and de∣serters from the enemy.</P>
<P>The original plan for the lance-men was to have draught∣ed them from the regiments of horse. But as this method <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> produce a clashing of interests and perhaps occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disturbances, the count prefers having a corps totally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nnected with any other. My advice to him, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enlist his number of cavalry with the continental boun∣ty▪ and, if it should be found consonant to the views of Congress to allow his raising the number proposed over and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the establishment for the horse, then he would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the footing of an independent corps▪ if not, he might at all events have them as draughts; and in this case there would be no ground for complaint.</P>
<P>with regard to the infantry, which the count esteems es∣sential to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> success of the cavalry, I have informed him that the enlisting deserters and prisoners is prohibited by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resolve of Congress. How far congress might be in∣clined to make an exception, and license the engaging pris∣oners in a particular detached corps, in which such charac∣ters may be admitted with less danger than promiscuously is the line, I cannot undertake to pronounce.</P>
<P>I have only to add that the count's valour and active zeal on all occasions have done him great honour; and from a persuasion, that, by being less exposed to the inconveni∣ences which he has hitherto experienced, he will render <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> services with such a command as he asks for, I wish him to succeed in his application.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to transmit you a letter from governor Clinton which he inclosed to me for my perusal and consideration. The inconvenience he mentions, as re∣sulting from the resolve respecting the appointment of a commandant for Forts Montgomery and Clinton, requires to be obviated. I do not conceive it to have been the de∣sign of Congress to make the command of those forts alto∣gether distinct and independent on the general command of the pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in that quarter; but only to designate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the officer who should have the immediate charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them.</P>
<P>There is such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n intimate connexion between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the other posts and pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in the Highlands and their vicinity, that it is necessary for one officer to have the super∣intendency and control of the whole, and to be answera∣ble for all. If this were not to be the case, but the command were to be divided, there might want that co-operation be∣tween the garrisons and the troops without, which might be essential to their preservation and to the common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣poses of defence. The assigning a fixed number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the garrisons would not remove this inconvenience; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the co-operation would still be necessary. But if it were otherwise, I should not think the measure adviseable, be∣cause we do not know what number of men we may have in the field next campaign; and the number for the defence of the Highlands must be proportioned to the general strength; and the force of the garrisons, to that number.</P>
<P>On these considerations, having ordered general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dou∣gal to repair to the Highlands to assume the chief command there, I have comprehended the forts among the other ob∣jects of his trust; in the discharge of which, I am persuaded he will manifest adequate zeal and ability. But as the re∣solve
<PB N="229" REF="029737_0567_0FE29C53F02921D0"/>
in question affords room for doubt, it will be proper to have it explained, so as more explicitly to ascertain the intention of Congress.</P>
<P>I am perfectly in sentiment with governor Clinton on the propriety of drawing the troops from the northward to re∣inforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From every thing I can learn, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere seems to be no prospect of prosecuting the intended expedition into Canada. If so, I apprehend it can answer no valuable end to keep a body of troops in and about Albany. In the present circumstances of Canada, little is to be dreaded thence: the enemy, in all probability, will be well satisfied to act on the defensive, without risking the consequences of an attempt against us. A proper garrison at Fort-Schuyler, and a small party by way of guard at Albany, with the militia of the country that may be occasionally drawn together, will be a sufficient security against the inroads of the enemy from Canada, or the depredations of the neighbouring Indians, supposing there were any of the tribes whose dispositions were still actively hostile notwithstanding our late northern successes, which is by no means a natural supposition. All the men, more than are wanted for these purposes, would be of the most important utility in the Highlands.</P>
<P>If the arms and stores <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Albany should be thought an objection to the plan, I would beg leave to observe that Al∣bany appears to me a most improper place for stationary arsenals or magazines, and that those which are there at present should be removed without delay. Besides, as they would be in most danger from an incursion up the North-river, the best way to counteract that danger is to strength∣en the passes in the Highlands, and obstruct the navigation; in order to which, the reinforcing them with the troops from the northward would be no inconsiderable step.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered you by captain Sullivan, who waits on Congress upon the subject of pay and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="230" REF="029737_0568_0FE29BF7ADB16EF8"/>
his rank in the line of the Massachusetts officers. He is one of the gentlemen, who, in going with major Sherburne to relieve the post we had at the Cedars in 1776, after a brave and gallant conduct, fell into the enemy's hands. In a few days after, on the treaty which general Arnold made, he generously offered himself, as I have been informed, and went one of the hostages to Quebec, for the perform∣ance of it.</P>
<P>By some means the State of Massachusetts-Bay has not continued him in their line, nor has he any appointment in the army. He is now on parole through the indulgence of general Carleton, and has applied to me for pay and rations from the time of his return: and considering also the depri∣vation of his rank as hard and injurious, he hopes he will be provided for in a suitable manner, and according to that standing which he formerly held in the army.</P>
<P>Captain Sullivan's wishes in either instance cannot be an∣swered by me. As to the first, the resolution of the nine∣teenth of January, regulating the pay of prisoners (which is the only rule for my government) seems to have drawn the line between officers on parole who are continued in service, and those who are not; and, making that the only criterion to fix pay, to have precluded every other discrim∣ination; and the powers, which were vested in the respect∣ive States to appoint officers, prohibit any interference by me in his favour, as to the latter.</P>
<P>I have stated the nature of the captain's claims, and the reasons which are opposed to his obtaining relief in either instance from me. I shall only add that the neglect by the States (in their appointments) of the officers who were in captivity, where there was no other objection to them, was at least ungenerous, if not impolitic and unjust. It has been the case in many instances: and as to the gentlemen who is particularly the subject of this letter, the testimonials that have been given of his character as an officer were much in his favour, and greatly to his honour.</P>
<P>By accident, the resolution of the nineteenth of January, alluded to above, has been mislaid. I must trouble you with a request for another copy of it.</P>
<P>I transmit Congress colonel * * *'s application to re∣sign. As general Huntington, in whose brigade he is, and
<PB N="231" REF="029737_0569_0FE29C5DA74DFF18"/>
in whom I have the utmost confidence, is perfectly willing, I have only to say upon the occasion that I have not the smallest objection to the measure.</P>
<P>General Sullivan set out for Rhode-Island on Friday last to take the command there, in consequence of the resolu∣tion of Congress directing me to send a major-general there for that purpose. Supposing general Greene in the quar∣ter-master line, I have now only one major-general left in camp.</P>

<P>ON Saturday I had the honour to receive your fa∣vour of the tenth, with the resolutions alluded to.</P>
<P>Inclosed I take the liberty to transmit an extract of a letter just received from general Parsons. This, as well as the letter which I inclosed you yesterday from governor Clinton, will shew the confusion in the management of af∣fairs on the North-river. I informed Congress then that I had sent general M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal to take the chief command there, comprehending the forts,—which appeared to me the only effectual means for curing all disorders, and pro∣moting the public service. To remove all impediments, it were to be wished that Congress would invest him with every necessary power for carrying into execution the objects of his command: and it might be well if they were to ex∣tend to any future commanding officer, as it would prevent those difficulties which have heretofore arisen from their having been considered as merely personal.</P>
<P>I am more and more in sentiment with governor Clin∣ton on the propriety and absolute necessity of drawing the troops from the northward, to reinforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From the information I have from colonel Radiere who has just come from thence, I find that the intended defences are far less advanced than I had any idea of. According to him, little or nothing is yet done, though I have repeatedly and constantly urged the prosecution of them with all possible industry. The in∣closed copies of my letters to general Putnam will shew
<PB N="232" REF="029737_0570_0FE29C015CDC0FC0"/>
that I have uniformly pressed the closest attention to the business, though it might be inferred from general Parsons's letter that there had been some inconsistency in my orders. There remains but a little time to do a great deal in; and I fear that no exertions now will be sufficient to place things in that quarter on the secure and respectacle footing we could wish. However, we should do the most we can: and if the works cannot be as complete as they ought, the troops will be there; and a reliance must be had in their bravery, to repel any attempt that may be formed against them.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour of transmitting you the inclos∣ed letter from general Smallwood, giving intelligence of the enemy's motions on the Delaware, and his conjectures re∣specting their object. The account he has heard of troops being on board the vessels is confirmed by the relations of deserters and others, who agree that a considerable number of men have been embarked, and add that they took seven∣teen day's provision with them. From this circumstance it is scarcely to be imagined that they are ordered on a sea voyage. The proportion of small vessels in the fleet makes it probable that they have in view to collect forage, or at∣tempt the destruction of the salt-works; and both these ideas are favoured by accounts from the city.

<P>HEREWITH I do myself the honour to inclose cop∣ies of a letter from an officer of militia at Elizabethtown, to me, and an extract of a letter from one of Mr. Boudi∣not's deputies at Boston, to him,—both tending to induce a belief that the enemy have some enterprise in contempla∣tion. What this is, time must discover. I have this whole winter been clearly of opinion that general Howe's movements would be very early this spring, to take ad∣vantage of the weak state of our army,—or late, if he ex∣pected considerable reinforcements from England, and meant to avail himself of his full strength. If the first takes place, as appearances indicate, it may, I think, be consid∣ered as a proof of one or both of these two things, that he is either well informed (he cannot indeed be otherwise) of the situation, and more than probably, of the strength of our army, or that he expects no inconsiderable reinforce∣ments this year from Europe. In either case it is our in∣dispensable duty to reinforce and arrange our army, as speedily as possible, that we may in the first instance be prepared for defence,—in the second, take advantage of any favourable circumstance which may happen, to injure the enemy.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the designs of Congress with respect to the establishment of the army, I know not: but I do most earnestly and devoutly recommend a speedy adoption of them, and the appointment of officers, as our present situation at this advanced season is truly alarming, and to me highly distressing, as I am convinced that we shall be plunged into the campaign before our arrangements are made, and the army properly organized.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="029737_0572_0FE29C04DA381110"/>
The numberless disadvantages, resulting from the late appointment of general officers last year, make me look for∣ward with infinite anxiety, this:—for, after all the wisdom that Congress or their committee can use in the choice of officers, many will be disgusted: resignations of some and perhaps non-acceptance of others will follow. Before matters then can be brought to a proper tone, much time will be lost, and a great deal of trouble and vexation en∣countered,—to overcome which, is not the work of a day; and, till they are overcome, confusion, disorder, and loss, must prevail. In the meanwhile, order, regularity, and discipline,—which require the vigilance of every officer to establish, and must flow from the general officers in every army,—are neglected, or not entered upon in time to ef∣fect. Thus it happened last year; and brigades and divi∣sions became vacant, to the great injury of the service.</P>
<P>As it is not improper for Congress to have some idea of the present temper of the army, it may not be amiss to re∣mark in this place, that, since the month of August last, be∣tween two and three hundred officers have resigned their commissions, and many others were with difficulty dissuaded from it. In the Virginia line only, not less than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix colonels, as good as any in the service, have left it lately; and more, I am told, are in the humour to do so.</P>
<P>Highly advantageous also would it be, if the recruits and draughts from North-Carolina and Virginia were not suffered to halt on their way to camp under pretence of get∣ting equipped, but sent forward and incorporated into the dif∣ferent regiments of their respective States as soon as it could be done. Out of the number of men said to be draughted in Virginia last fall, and others from North-Carolina, very few have joined the army; but owing to desertion and oth∣er causes, they have dwindled to nothing: and this will always be the case with new recruits, especially those who are unwillingly drawn forth, if much time is spent in get∣ting them to their regiments under the care of proper of∣ficers. This shews the necessity (if the season and other powerful reasons did not loudly call for it) of hastening them to the army.</P>
<P>My solicitude for the preservation of the communication of the North-river gives me very uneasy sensations on ac∣count
<PB N="235" REF="029737_0573_0FE29C60CBB928E0"/>
of our posts there, and will excuse my again asking if the troops to the northward, except such as are necessary for the defence of Fort-Schuyler, can be so advantageously employed as at the works on that river. A respectable force at those posts would awe New-York, and divide general Howe's force or expose the city. To depend too much upon militia, is, in my opinion, putting every thing to hazard.</P>
<P>If I should appear uncommonly anxious respecting the several matters contained in this letter, by repeating them, Congress will do me the justice, I hope, to believe that I am actuated by no views but such as are prompted by cir∣cumstances and the advanced season. With the greatest respect, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honoured with yours of the twenty-fifth, inclosing duplicates of two former resolves of Con∣gress, and a resolve of the twenty-third instant, accepting the resignation of colonel Charles Webb.</P>
<P>Since mine of the twenty-fourth, Mr. Boudinot has communicated the following intelligence, being part of a letter to him:—"I have lately received some intelligence from New-York, that we may make ourselves easy in Jer∣sey, as all the force that can be spared is to be sent to join
<PB N="236" REF="029737_0574_0FE29C065EBDBC58"/>
general Howe. Two thousand five hundred are actually on board transports, and lying at the watering-place."</P>
<P>I have this day received a letter from general Small∣wood, dated yesterday at Wilmington, in which he says—"The enemy, about four days ago, had a fleet of near fifty sail standing up the river, which I fancy was from New-York; and yesterday their foraging fleet went up without touching upon this side the Delaware, except three or four small parties about Port-Penn, who have been con∣stantly drove off by a party of about a hundred of our men, who have been guarding and aiding the removal of the forage, which is at length happily effected."</P>
<P>A Philadelphia paper of the twenty-seventh also men∣tions, that a fleet of upwards of forty sail had left the Hook on Sunday, and that they were said to be in the river.</P>
<P>From all the above circumstances, I have no doubt but the troops have arrived from New-York. I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heard nothing further from Rhode-Island since I wrote to you last.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you upon the twenty-ninth ultimo, I have not been able to learn with any precision whether the transports that arrived brought any considerable number of troops. A Hessian deserter says there were only a few German convalescents on board. If so, the fleet with two thousand five hundred, mentioned in my last, is not arrived, supposing they were bound to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>General St. Clair arrived yesterday from Boston: and, as he seems very anxious to have his matter determined one way or the other, I beg leave to recall the attention of Congress to my letter of the twenty-seventh of February upon that subject. Having received no information since that time which serves to direct my judgment as to the charges which it will be proper to exhibit against general
<PB N="237" REF="029737_0575_0FE29C624DB235D8"/>
St. Clair, I have only again to request that Congress or the committee will be pleased to point out the particular charges upon which the court shall proceed.</P>
<P>I could wish this matter might not be delayed, on sev∣eral accounts. General St. Clair is in a very delicate s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣uation, and feels it sensibly. He was kept inactive great part of last campaign, and probably will be the whole of this, except his trial can be shortly brought on,—as it will be almost impossible to find time to hold a court after the scene of action opens. If he should be acquitted, he would render very essential service, especially at this time when we have so few general officers: if condemned, his place may be immediately filled. It will besides take him some little time to prepare for his defen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after he knows the particular charges alleged against him.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Lee of the light dragoons, and the of∣ficers under his command, having uniformly distinguished themselves by a conduct of exemplary zeal, prudence and bravery, I took occasion, on a late signal instance of it, to express the high sense I entertained of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> merit, and to assure him that it should not fail of being properly noticed. I was induced to give this assurance from a conviction that it is the wish of Congress to give every encouragement to merit, and that they would cheerfully embrace so favour∣able an opportunity of manifesting this disposition.</P>
<P>I had it in contemplation at the time, in case no other method more eligible could be adopted, to make him an offer of a place in my family. I have consulted the com∣mittee of Congress upon the subject, and we were mutually of opinion that the giving captain Lee the command of two troops of horse on the proposed establishment, with the rank of major, to act as an independent partizan corps, would be a mode of rewarding him, very advantageous to the service. Captain Lee's genius particularly adapts him to a command of this nature; and it will be the most
<PB N="238" REF="029737_0576_0FE29C09387AF048"/>
agreeable to him, of any station in which he could be placed.</P>
<P>I beg leave to recommend this measure to Congress, and shall be obliged by their decision as speedily as may be convenient. The campaign is fast approaching, and there will probably be very little time to raise and prepare the corps for it. It is a part of the plan to give Mr. Lindsay the command of the second troop, and to make Mr. Pey∣ton captain-lieutenant of the first.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now the honour to acknowledge your sev∣eral letters of the twenty-first, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth ultimo, with their inclosures, which have been duly re∣ceived. It gives me pain to observe they appear to con∣tain several implications by which my sensibility is not a little wounded. I find myself extremely embarrassed by the steps I had taken towards an exchange of prisoners and the formation of a general cartel making more ample provision for their future accommodation and relief. The views of Congress seem to be very different from what I supposed them when I entered into my late engagements with general Howe: their resolution of the thirtieth ulti∣mo, pointedly requiring a strict adherence to all former ones upon the subject, will in all probability render them impracticable. I considered some of their resolutions as dictated on the principle of retaliation, and did not imag∣ine the terms they contained would be insisted upon in negociating an agreement calculated to remedy the evils which occasioned them. In most respects they might be substantially complied with: but there are some points to which an exact conformity must of necessity destroy the idea of a cartel. One is the obliging the enemy to pay gold and silver on equal terms for continental currency, estimating the articles supplied them at their actual prices with us, as seems to be the design of the resolve of the nineteenth of December: another is the subjecting the in∣habitants
<PB N="239" REF="029737_0577_0FE29C6D4CA57128"/>
of these States, taken in arms against them, to trial and punishment, agreeable to the resolve of the thir∣tieth of the same month.</P>
<P>I am well aware that appearances ought to be upheld, and that we should avoid as much as possible recognizing by any public act the depreciation of our currency: but I conceive this end would be answered as far as might be necessary, by stipulating that all money payments should be made in gold and silver, being the common medium of commerce among nations, at the rate of four shillings and six pence for a Spanish milled dollar, &amp;c.—by fixing the price of rations on an equitable scale relatively to our re∣spective circumstances,—and providing for the payment of what we may owe, by sending in provision, and selling it at their market. The rates of money, and the prices of provisions and other commodities, differ every where: and, in treaties of a similar nature between any two States, it is requisite, for mutual convenience, to ascertain some common ratio both for the value of money in payments, and for the rates of those articles on which they may arise.</P>
<P>It was determined on mature consideration not to con∣clude any thing expressly that should contradict the reso∣lution of the thirtieth of December: but at the same time, if it is designed to be the rule of practice, it is easy to per∣ceive it would at once overturn any cartel that could be formed. General Howe would never consent to observe it on his part, if such a practice were to exist on ours. Though the law ought not to be contravened by an ex∣press article admitting the exchangeability of such persons, yet, if it is not suffered o sleep, it is in vain to expect the operation of it will be acquiesced in by the enemy.</P>
<P>The measures I have taken must evince that it is my determination to pay the fullest attention to the interests of citizens, and to the rights of generel Lee, in the treaty: and I think it but justice to the gentlemen appointed to negociate it, to declare that I know them to be so fully impressed with the importance of both those objects, as to make them cheerfully observant of the injunctions of Con∣gress, so far as not to conclude any agreement of which the exchange of general Lee and the alternative respecting
<PB N="240" REF="029737_0578_0FE29C0FF9C2D1C8"/>
citizens are not essential parts. These points had been early determined on.</P>
<P>It is with no small concern that I have been obliged to trouble Congress upon the subjects of this letter: and, should they appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them in the same light they do to me, and they should think proper to remove the obstacles which now oppose the business in hand, I must request they will be pleased to communicate their determination as expeditiously as possible, that the commissioners may govern themselves accordingly, and either proceed to form∣ing a cartel, or put an end to the negociation. Before the resolves of the thirtieth came to hand, they had m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and been in treaty two days, with a prospect of a favoura∣ble accommodation.</P>
<P>I am happy to inform Congress that general Lee will be out on parole to-morrow in place of general Prescot: and I have every reason to expect, if the negociation can be continued upon admissible terms, that his exchange will immediately follow the releasement of colonel Campbell and the Hessian field-officers. It is agreed that lieuten∣ant-colonel Allen shall be exchanged for lieutenant-colonel Campbell.</P>
<P>The importunate applications of colonel Lee and major Swazey to leave the service oblige me to lay the matter before Congress. Colonel Lee's letter upon the subject was transmitted me the twenty-fifth of January: but, hop∣ing he might change his mind, I deferred writing to Con∣gress upon his request. He has renewed it again in urgent terms, through general Heath; and I have only to ob∣serve that it is a painful circumstance to see officers of their merit leaving the service. It is the case every day. I shall be obliged by Congress informing me of the dates of the resignations of the colonels in the Virginia line: I have only received the date of colonel Lewis's.</P>
<P>Inclosed is a letter from captain Cotteneau of the ship Ferdinand, with an invoice of her cargo. The letter only came to hand yesterday; and, as it is of an old date, it is highly probable that the goods are sold. If they are not,—from the captain's desire to give the public a pref∣erence in the sale, Congress will have an opportunity of
<PB N="241" REF="029737_0579_0FE29C7118E48348"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had the honour of receiving your favour of the fourth instant, inclosing a resolve of Congress, of the same date, empowering me to call forth five thousand mi∣litia from the States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New-Jersey. I thank Congress for the power: at the same time it is incumbent on me to assure them, that,—granting the practicability of collecting such a number,—it would prove a work of time, difficulty and expense; to evince which, I need only recur to the experience of last cam∣paign on similar occasions, and to remind you that it was not possible to obtain a thousand men, nor sometimes even one hundred, from this State, although the former number was required and promised for the purpose of covering during the winter the country between Schuylkill and Delaware.</P>
<P>As this resolve appears to have been made in conse∣quence of my letters of the twenty-fourth and twe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ultimo, which were founded on conjecture, and, in some degree, misinformation,—and as the execution of it would,
<PB N="242" REF="029737_0580_0FE29C807861FD90"/>
exclusive of the inconveniences abovementioned, I am per∣suaded, have a tendency to injure the completion of the continental regiments,—I shall call for a small part only of the number allowed; but could wish that Hartley's regiment were ordered immediately to camp, and the du∣ties of it performed by militia. In like manner I would propose that all remote guards should be composed of mi∣litia, and that the several purposes for which men are drawn from the continental troops should be answered by them. This would be a means of drawing together a considera∣ble number of men who are in a manner lost to the ar∣my, and of employing the militia to the best advantage possible.</P>
<P>The great end of my letter to Congress, of the twenty-fourth ultimo, seems to have been mistaken. My views were not turned to reinforcements of militia. To know whether the old establishment of the army, or the new as agreed upon by the committee, is the choice of Congress,—and in what manner the regiments of this State and the additionals are to be reduced,—officers for the whole ap∣pointed, &amp;c.—were my objects. These are objects of the greatest moment, as they may, in their consequences, in∣volve the fate of America; for I will undertake to say that it is next to impossible, when the season is so far ad∣vanced, properly to accomplish those changes, appoint∣ments, and the dependent arrangements for the ensuing campaign. Should any convulsion happen, or movement take place, they will be altogether impracticable. Justice to my own character, as well as duty to the public, con∣strain me to repeat these things: their consequences are more easily conceived than described.</P>
<P>It may be said by some, Sir, that my wish to see the of∣ficers of this army upon a more respectable establishment is the cause of my solicitude, and carries me too far. To such I can declare that my anxiety proceeds from the causes abovementioned. If my opinion is asked with re∣spect to the necessity of making this provision for the offi∣cers, I am ready to declare that I do most religiously be∣lieve the salvation of the cause depends upon it,—and, without it, your officers will moulder to nothing, or be composed of low and illiterate men, void of capacity for
<PB N="243" REF="029737_0581_0FE29C12D1EE1680"/>
this or any other business. To prove this, I can with truth aver, that scarce a day passes without the offer of two or three commissions; and my advices from the eastward and southward are that numbers who had gone home on furlough mean not to return, but are establishing them∣selves in more lucrative employments. Let Congress de∣termine what will be the consequence of this spirit.</P>
<P>Personally, as an officer, I have no interest in their de∣cision, because I have declared, and I now repeat it, that I never will receive the smallest benefit from the half-pay establishment: but, as a man who fights under the weight of a proscription, and as a citizen who wishes to see the liberty of his country established upon a permanent foun∣dation, and whose property depends upon the success of our arms, I am deeply interested. But,—all this apart, and justice out of the question,—upon the single ground of economy and public saving, I will maintain the utility of it: for I have not the least doubt, that, until officers con∣sider their commissions in an honourable and interested point of view, and are afraid to endanger them by negli∣gence and inattention, no order, regularity or care, either of the men or public property, will prevail. * * *</P>
<P>By officers who are just returned from Massachusetts-Bay, I learn that there is not the least prospect of getting men from thence before the month of June,—if then; and indeed that there is no reason to expect any number that will deserve the name of reinforcement for the conti∣nental regiments this campaign,—the towns being only called upon to furnish the deficiency of their last year's quota, so that all subsequent casualties are disregarded, and the fifteen regiments of that State, which may now per∣haps want four thousand men to complete them, will re∣ceive only five hundred if the towns came within that number of their complement last year. What change the requisition of Congress, of the [<HI>twenty-sixth</HI>] of February, may effect, I shall not undertake to say: if it has not a speedy and powerful operation, our prospects in that quar∣ter will be exceedingly unpromising.</P>
<P>A gentleman from New-Hampshire some little time since informed me that matters were nearly in the same train there, notwithstanding a resolve for the completion of
<PB N="244" REF="029737_0582_0FE29C145A0FF770"/>
their battalions; and the inclosed copy of a letter (N<SUP>o</SUP> 1) from general Putnam, whom I have desired to remain in Connecticut for some time in order to forward the recruits from that State, conveys his ideas of what may be expected from thence. What New-York, New-Jersey, and North-Carolina have done or are about to do, I know not. Pennsylvania and Maryland have tried the effect of vol∣untary enlistments to little purpose; and the first, in direct contradiction to the most pointed injunctions laid on the officers, have their recruits composed chiefly of deserters who will embrace the first opportunity of escaping with our arms. Virginia, it is true, has proceeded to a draught: but the number, besides being in itself inadequate, has been lessened by desertion; and the deficiency of the regiments, on the other hand, being increased by death and desertion, their strength will probably fall very far short of the new establishment.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is not a flattering picture of our affairs: but the representation is just; and it is incumbent on me to exhibit it in my own defence, as, notwithstanding all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> unfavourable circumstances,—and what is to me a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prospect of being plunged into the campaign before the ar∣rangements are made, officers, appointed, &amp;c.—great mat∣ters, I perceive, are expected from our activity this spring▪ in proportion therefore will the disappointment be felt by those who are sanguine. For want of the ratification of Congress, the horse establishment, companies of sappers, provost-marshalsey, &amp;c. &amp;c. (as agreed to by the commit∣tee, and recommended for their consideration) are entirely at a stand, at a time when we ought to be deriving benefits from their execution. In a word, at no period since the commencement of the war have I felt more painful sensa∣tions on account of delay, than at the present: and, urged by them, I have expressed myself without reserve.</P>
<P>By a letter just received from general Weedon, I am informed of his intention to resign, if general Woodford should be restored to his former rank, which he had not then heard. General Muhlenberg is now balancing on the same point. One, therefore, if not two brigadiers, will be wanted for that State. The disadvantages resulting from the frequent resignations in the Virginia line, the
<PB N="245" REF="029737_0583_0FE29C73F5E05008"/>
changes of commanding officers to the regiments, and other causes equally distressing, have injured that corps beyond conception, and have been the means of reducing very respectable regiments in some instances to a mere handful of men: and this will ever be the case till officers can be fixed by something equivalent to the sacrifice they make. To reason otherwise, and suppose that public virtue alone will enable men to forego the ease and comforts of life, to encounter the hardships and dangers of war for a bare sub∣sistence, when their companions and friends are amassing large fortunes,—is viewing human nature rather as it should be, than as it really is.</P>
<P>The clothier-general of the army, as well as the heads of every other department, should be in camp near the commander in chief: otherwise it is impossible that the operations of war can be conducted with energy and pre∣cision. I wish most sincerely that this,—as not the least essential part of the business settled with the committee,—were decided, and a thorough investigation were had into the conduct of this department; as it is a matter of uni∣versal astonishment that we should be deficient in any arti∣cle of clothing, when it is commonly asserted that the east∣ern States alone can furnish materials enough to clothe a hundred thousand men. If this be fact, there is a fatal error somewhere, to which may be attributed the death and desertion of thousands.</P>
<P>I shall make no apology for the freedom of this letter. To inform Congress of such facts as materially affect the service, I conceive to be one great and essential part of my duty to them and myself. My agreement with the com∣mittee entitled me to expect upwards of forty thousand continental troops, exclusive of artillery and horse, for the service of the ensuing campaign, including those to be em∣ployed in the defence of the North-river. Instead of these, what are my prospects?</P>

<P>ON Thursday evening I had the honour to receive your two letters of the fourteenth instant. I am much obliged by the fresh assurances which Congress are pleased to make me of their confidence; and they may be satisfied that I wish nothing more ardently than that a good and perfect agreement should subsist between us.</P>
<P>The negociation between the commissioners is ended without effecting a cartel: nor do I suppose, from the in∣formation I have received on the subject, that there is any good prospect that one will ever be formed, or at least for a great while, on a liberal and extensive plan. A report of the proceedings of the commissioners on our part, at their several meetings, I take the liberty to inclose. The papers, N<SUP>o</SUP> 1, contain the letters between general Howe and my∣self, stipulating the neutrality of Germantown,—our re∣spective powers,—and the result of the meeting there;—N<SUP>o</SUP> 2, the subsequent proceedings at Newtown. The old agreement, I presume, continues; and under it we must carry on exchanges.</P>
<P>General Muhlenberg has communicated his determina∣tion to resign, but has promised not to leave his brigade till Congress shall appoint another general in his room, pro∣vided it is done in any reasonable time.</P>
<P>By postponing my call upon the militia, as mentioned in my last of the tenth, I did not mean to decline it altogeth∣er. I did not see the necessity of calling out five thousand for the sole purpose of defence: and, in the present situa∣tion of things, I cannot perceive my way sufficiently clear for offensive measures, as I do not know when to expect the recruits from the different States, nor what prospect the
<PB N="247" REF="029737_0585_0FE29C7D3629FF50"/>
commissary has of provision:—as we only get it yet from hand to mouth, assembling the militia, unless for the pur∣pose of defence, should be the last thing done, as they soon become impatient, and are very expensive in the articles of stores, camp utensils, provisions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The inclosed draught of a bill was brought to Head-Quarters yesterday afternoon, by a gentleman who informed me that a large cargo of them had been just sent out of Philadelphia.

I sup∣pose it will obtain a place in the papers, and am not with∣out anxiety that it will have a malignant influence.

<P>WITH your letter of the seventeenth instant, and its inclosures, I was duly honoured on Saturday afternoon. When I addressed you on the eighteenth, I was doubtful whether the draught of the bill then transmitted was not spurious and contrived in Philadelphia: but its authentici∣ty, I am almost certain, is not to be questioned. The in∣formation from Philadelphia seems clear and conclusive that it came over in the packet, with lord North's speech on the introduction of it into parliament. I inclose a paper con∣taining his speech, which just came to hand. This bill, I am persuaded, will pass into a law. Congress will perceive by the minister's speech, that it aims at objects of the great∣est extent and importance, and will, no doubt, in one way

<P>I TAKE the liberty to transmit you a letter which I received yesterday from governor Tryon, inclosing the draughts of the two bills I forwarded before, with his cer∣tificate of the manner in which they came to his hands, ac∣companied by his more extraordinary and impertinent re∣quest, that, through my means, the contents should be com∣municated to the officers and men of this army. This engine of ministry, from governor Livingston's account, is very industriously circulating copies of these draughts, in obedience to their and his royal master's mandates. The letter which I inclose, and a triplicate, came to hand at one time: some future conveyance, it is probable, will pre∣sent me the duplicate.</P>
<P>I would also take the liberty to inclose you the Evening Post, N<SUP>o</SUP> 475, which governor Livingston was so obliging as to send me yesterday. Were we not fully satisfied from our experience, that there are no artifices, no measures too * * * for the enemy or their adherents to attempt in or∣der to promote their views, we might be astonished at the daring confidence, in defiance of the opinion of the world, manifested in a publication in this paper, purporting to be a resolution of Congress, of the twentieth of February. This proceeding is infamous to the last degree, and calculated to produce the most baneful consequences by exciting an op∣position in the people to our draughting system, and embar∣rassing at least the only pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mode now left us for rais∣ing men. I think it of great importance that the forgery should be announced in the most public manner, and am the more induced to this opinion from governor Living∣ston's account of the disagreeable operation it has had, and is still likely to produce, if not contradicted. If it is, and with a few strictures, I should hope that it will excite in the breasts of all our countrymen, a just and generous con∣tempt of the enemy, for such a dirty, wicked proceeding.</P>

I was last night honoured with your favour of the eigh∣teenth instant, with the proceedings alluded to. A gener∣al plan of operations for the campaign is indispensably es∣sential to be settled. I have thought much upon the sub∣ject; and some propositions respecting it were put into the hands of all the general officers here on Tuesday evening, for their consideration. I also intended to send a messenger this day to meet general Gates, supposing him to be on his way to Hudson's-river, and to request his call at this camp, that we might enter into a full and free discussion of the point. There is not a moment to be delayed in forming some general system, in my opinion; and I only wait the arrival of generals Gates and Mifflin, to summon a council for the purpose.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform Congress that the report of the commissioners coming, according to intelligence received yesterday by a person of Philadelphia, is confidently be∣lieved; and it is there thought that they will very soon ar∣rive. I think it almost certain that the matter will not be delayed, as the conduct of ministry, in not sending them immediately after their former propositions, has been much reprobated, and as it may be of much importance to im∣prove the first impressions of the people upon the occasion. Lord Amherst, admiral Keppel, and general Murray, are said to be the persons appointed; and it is likely they are vested with both civil and military powers. The informa∣tion was through the channel of a sensible intelligent man, well known, and of esteemed credit. He is connected with the British army, having two or three brothers in it.

<P>I HAD the honour yesterday afternoon to receive your letter of the twenty fourth, continued to the twenty-fifth, with its important inclosures. Congress will be pleased to accept my sincere thanks for the fresh instance of confidence manifested in their resolution of the twenty-third, and other proceedings; and they may rest assured that whatever pow∣ers are entrusted to me shall be invariably directed to pro∣mote the interest of these States. If in any case there should be a misapplication or a failure in the execution, it will be the effect of mistake and not of design.</P>
<P>I shall take measures for distributing the report of the committee on lord North's bills, and the resolution of the twenty-third inviting delinquents to return to their allegi∣ance and to the protection of these States. This proceed∣ing appears to me founded in great good policy; and I should hope that it will be attended with many valuable consequences:—but this can only be proved by the event.</P>
<P>Though I wish most heartily for the aid of general Lee in council and upon every other occasion,—yet, as the time of his return is uncertain, or at least it will be several days before it takes place,—and as it seems to me that there is not a moment to lose in forming some general system for our operations,—I should think it inexpedient for general Gates to delay coming to camp till his arrival. After a plan is digested, there will be a great deal of time expend∣ed before things will be in a proper train for execution. The season is fast advancing; and the period which may be most favourable for any designs we may form will presently arrive.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to transmit an extract of a letter from general Heath, which will shew Congress that he is pressed on all sides for money. Governor Livingston too is ap∣prehensive he will be under embarrassments on account of the purchase of horses in consequence of the recommenda∣tion
<PB N="251" REF="029737_0589_0FE29CDF9CDE84A8"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE extensive ill consequences, arising from a want of unif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mity in discipline and manoeuvres throughout the army, have long occasioned me to wish for the establishment of a well organized inspectorship; and the concurrence of Congress in the same views has induced me to set on foot a temporary institution, which, from the success that has hith∣erto attended it, gives me the most flattering expectations, and will, I hope, obtain their approbation.</P>
<P>Baron De Steuben's length of service in the first military school in Europe, and his former rank, pointed him out as a person peculiarly qualified to be at the head of this de∣partment. This appeared the least exceptionable way of introducing him into the army, and one that would give him the most ready opportunity of displaying his talents. I therefore proposed to him to undertake the office of in∣spector-general, which he agreed to with the greatest cheer∣fulness, and has performed the duties of it with a zeal and intelligence equal to our wishes. He has two ranks of in∣spectors under him: the lowest are officers charged with the inspection of brigades, with the title of brigade-inspect∣ors: the others superintend several of these: they have written instructions relative to their several functions; and the manoeuvres which they are to practise are illustrated by a company which the baron has taken the pains to train himself.</P>
<P>The brigade-inspectors were chosen by the brigadier and commanding officers of regiments in each brigade. The inspectors are lieutenant-colonels Barber of Jersey, Brooks
<PB N="252" REF="029737_0590_0FE1BFBF70F45558"/>
of Massachusetts, Davis of Virginia, and monsieur Ter∣nant, a French gentleman:—the reason for employing him (apart his intrinsic merit and abilities) was his possessing the French and English languages equally, which made him a necessary assistant to the baron De-Steuben. He is content to serve without rank, until, after an experiment of his abilities, Congress shall determine what he is enti∣tled to.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of lieutenant-colonel Fleury in camp, as he was unemployed, and had exercised the office of aide-major in France, the baron proposed to have him employed as an inspector; in which I readily acquiesced, as Congress had given him the rank and pay of lieutenant-colonel. There may be other foreign officers in continental pay, idle for want of being attached to some corps, of whose services we might avail ourselves in this way, which is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> method of disposing of them, unless they could be formed into a distinct corps.</P>
<P>From the extraordinary fatigue and close attention re∣quired of the officers employed in the inspectorship, I did not think it amiss to let them entertain hopes that Congress would allow some addition to the pay which they derive from their rank; and I take the the liberty of recommend∣ing the measure. I would propose twenty dollars per month for the brigade-inspectors, and thirty for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he inspect∣ors, in addition to their pay in the line.</P>
<P>I should do injustice if I were to be longer silent with regard to the merits of the baron De Steuben. His knowl∣edge of his prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion, added to the zeal which he has dis∣covered since be began upon the functions of his office, lead me to consider him as an acquisition to the service, and to recommend him to the attention of Congress. His expec∣tations with regard to rank extend to that of major-general. His finances, he ingenuously confesses, will not admit of his serving without the incident emoluments; and Congress, I presume, from his character and their own knowledge of him, will without difficulty gratify him in these particulars.</P>
<P>The baron is sensible that our situation requires a few variations in the duties of his office from the general prac∣tice in Europe, and particularly that they must necessarily be more comprehensive; in which, as well as in his instruc∣tions
<PB N="253" REF="029737_0591_0FE29CE12BE09310"/>
he has skilfully yielded to circumstances. The suc∣cess which has hitherto attended the plan enables me to re∣quest with confidence the ratification of Congress, and is, I think, a pledge of the establishment of a well-combined gen∣eral system, which insurmountable obstacles have hitherto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pposed.</P>

<P>I HAVE had the honour to receive your dispatches of the twenty-seventh instant. In compliance with the request of Congress, I shall immediately call upon the officers in the army to take the oath of allegiance and abjuration. This I should have done as soon as the resolution passed, had it not been for the state of the army, at that time, and that there were some strong reasons which made it expedi∣ent to defer the matter.</P>
<P>My opinion upon the subject of a future provision for the officers hath been so fully, and, I trust, so necessarily and equitably urged, that I shall not add further respecting it, except my sincere wishes that the establishment was deter∣mined on. Nothing, in my idea, can be more just; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> there is nothing more essential:—the present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> state of the army is hurtful in the extreme.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the twenty-seventh, I have received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>entic information of the sailing of a very large number of transports from Philadelphia,—two hundred, it is said. They went down the Delaware the beginning of the week, light and empty. I have not been able to learn any thing of their destination; nor can I form a conjecture upon the occasion that is the least satisfactory.</P>
<P>With infinite pleasure I beg leave to congratulate Con∣gress on the very important and interesting advices brought by the frigate La Sensible.

<P>IN a late letter from general Schuyier, I received the proceedings of a board of commissioners for Indian affairs, held at Albany the fifteenth of last month. It appears by them and some other accounts I have seen, that there is but little prospect of succeeding in the plan for engaging a body of Indians from that quarter to serve with this army. The advantage which the enemy possess over us, in having the means of making presents much more liberally than we can, has made a strong impression upon their minds, and seems to be more than a counterbalance for any arguments we can offer to conciliate their attachment. They also appear to be apprehensive for their own safety, and rather to wish for aid and protection from us, than willing to leave their habitations and come to our assistance.</P>
<P>The measure proposed was by way of experiment, as one which might possibly be attended with valuable conse∣quences, and, if it, could have been effected without much difficulty, might have been worth a trial. But, as the scheme does not well correspond with their present dispo∣sition, and may serve to increase our embarrassments in
<PB N="255" REF="029737_0593_0FE29CEA57C57AD0"/>
keeping them even in tolerable good humour, I am inclined to think it would be most adviseable to relinquish the attempt. They may be told of what has happened in Europe, with proper embellishments, and that our affairs are now upon such a footing as to render their aid in the field unnecessary, and that all we require of them is their friendship and good wishes. This and promises of protection may have a pow∣erful and happy effect.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to counteract the temptation held out by the enemy, and to secure the good will of the Indians, who appear to be at least in a state of hesitancy and indecision, if nothing worse. Congress, I am per∣suaded, will do every thing in their power to promote these desirable ends.</P>

<P>I HAD the honour to receive in due time your sev∣eral favours of the third, sixth, and ninth instant, with the papers to which they respectively alluded. After much consideration upon the subject, I have appointed general M<SUP>c</SUP>Intosh to command at Fort-Pitt and in the western country, for which he will set out as soon as he can accom∣modate his affairs. I part with this gentleman with much reluctance, as I esteem him an officer of great worth and merit, and as I know his services here are and will be ma∣terially wanted. His firm disposition and equal justice, his assiduity and good understanding,—added to his being a stranger to all parties in that quarter,—pointed him out as a proper person; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extensive advantages will be derived from his command, which I could wish was more agreeable. He will wait on Congress for their instructions.</P>
<P>As lieutenant-colonel Sutherland, major Agnew, and lieutenant Poe, have only requested to go to Europe on
<PB N="257" REF="029737_0595_0FE29CED98ED5518"/>
parole, it does not appear to me that I can with propriety apply to general Howe for their exchange:—this would imply that they were prisoners of war. Though their ex∣change is certainly the most desirable mode of release, as it would relieve an equal number of our officers from captiv∣ity, yet I should be happy if a negociation for the purpose should commence on their part. Knowing that it would be our interest to exchange all the officers of general Bur∣goyne's army if it could be done, I wrote general Heath not long since, to take occasion to mention to them that we should always be willing to accede to any equal propositions for that purpose, and would carefully convey their applica∣tions to Sir William Howe or the general who might com∣mand the British army. I take the liberty to return their letters, presuming that Congress may incline to give them some answer, either directly, or through general Heath.</P>
<P>In respect to lieutenant-colonel * * *, I do not find that there is any necessity for granting the prayer of his petition: we have already too many officers: and I do not appre∣hend the interest of the States would be much promoted in his appointment. If he could make up two or three com∣panies, they would be of prisoners and deserters, who would most assuredly embrace an early opportunity to go off with their arms and clothing. I am disposed to consider him as a man of some address and policy, as he is aiming at a con∣firmation in the line of the army (by obtaining an appoint∣ment to a new corps) of the rank which he had as a division quarter-master. Besides the impolicy of augmenting the number of our officers where it is not really essential, such a promotion would give dissatisfaction; and I suppose there are few officers, if any, who formerly commanded Mr. * * * in the line of the army, that would submit to his orders.</P>
<P>The inclosed copy of a letter from general Dickinson to me will inform Congress of the fate of the continental frig∣ates in Delaware,—a fate (in the situation they were left) I had long predicted, and which I had taken much pains to avert, by using every argument in my power to have them sunk. In that case, their destruction would have been at least a work of time, difficulty and expense, and might have been perhaps prevented. About one o'clock on Thursday
<PB N="258" REF="029737_0596_0FE29C8E097B98D8"/>
I got notice of an intended move of the enemy by water; and, conjecturing the destination of it, had a detachment under general Maxwell (whose tour of duty it was) ready to march towards the Delaware by four o'clock: but a heavy rain prevented their moving till next morning.</P>
<P>I have been happy in the exchange, and a visit from lieu∣tenant-colonel Allen. His fortitude and firmness seem to have placed him out of the reach of misfortune. There is an original something in him that commands admiration; and his long captivity and sufferings have only served to in∣crease if possible his enthusiastic zeal. He appears very de∣sirous of rendering his services to the States, and of being employed, and at the same time does not discover any am∣bition for high rank. Congress will herewith receive a letter from him; and I doubt not they will make such pro∣vision for him as they may think proper and suitable.</P>
<P>I take pleasure in transmitting a Philadelphia paper of the ninth, which came to hand yesterday evening, contain∣ing a message from his most christian majesty to the court of London in consequence of the treaty between him and these States,—and his Britannic majesty's address to the lords and commons, &amp;c. The message is conceived in terms of irony and derision, more degrading to the pride and dignity of Britain than any thing she has ever expe∣rienced since she has been a nation.

the uneasinesses which have been so extremely distress∣ing, and prevent resignations, which had proceeded, and were likely to be at such a height, as to destroy our whole military system. It has experienced no inconsiderable shock, particularly in the line of some States, from the loss of sev∣eral very valuable officers.</P>
<P>The letter and brevet for colonel Allen I will transmit by the first opportunity. He left camp eight days ago.</P>
<P>From a variety of concurring circumstances, and the uni∣form report of persons who have left Philadelphia within four days past, it would appear that the enemy mean to evac∣uate the city. It is said they have already embarked a part of their heavy cannon and baggage,—that transports are fitted and fitting for their horse, and taking in hay. The accounts further add that there has been a press for some nights in the city, and several men obtained in this way, and carried aboard ship; also that there had been an increased number of vendues. These circumstances all indicate an evacuation: but I have not been able to learn the objects of their future operations. I wrote to general Gates yesterday upon the subject, that he may be prepared in the best manner the situation of things will admit, in case they should be destined for the North-river,—and desired him to retain for the present all the eastern recruits intend∣ed for this army.</P>
<P>The quarter-master-general and commissary of provisions are directed to use every possible exertion for putting the affairs of their departments in a train to facilitate a move∣ment in case it should be necessary. But such have been the derangements and disorders in them, that we must be greatly embarrassed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or a considerable time yet.</P>
<P>A valuable detachment, under the command of the mar∣quis Fayette, marched this morning, which is intended to move between the Delaware and Schuylkill, for restraining the enemy's parties, procuring intelligence, and to act as circumstances may require.</P>
<P>I cannot help feeling for the prisoners in possession of the enemy. If they evacuate Philadelphia, those unhappy men will be dragged away with them, and perhaps to a more miserable confinement. But, supposing that their future treatment should not be worse, or even that it should be
<PB N="260" REF="029737_0598_0FE29C8F8C78A080"/>

<P>P. S. I would take the liberty to mention that I think the arms and clothing expected from France should be brought forward without a moment's delay after they ar∣rive. The impolicy of suffering them ever to remain in places accessible to shipping, out of the question,—our dis∣tress for both is amazingly great: we have many men now without firelocks, and many coming in, in the same predic∣ament; and half the army are without shirts.

<P>GENERAL M<SUP>c</SUP>Intosh will have the honour to de∣liver you this. He is now on his way to take the command at Pittsburg and in the western frontiers, and waits on Congress for their instructions. I would take the liberty of submitting to Congress the inclosed account of expenses incurred by the general in his journey from Georgia to join this army, and which he presented to me and to the audi∣tors for payment. I did not know how far I might be au∣thorised to comply with his request, and therefore lay the matter before Congress. At the same time I would ob∣serve that nothing appears to me more equitable than that claims of this sort, where they are not immoderate, should be satisfied by the public. If this were not the case, the expenses of an officer when ordered from one post to anoth∣er, especially where they are distant, would sink the whole or a very large part of his pay. The charges attending the general's journey from hence to Pittsburg will require equal attention; and the whole, I am persuaded, will meet with a just and suitable provision.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the twenty-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> instant, nothing material has happened. The enemy are still in Philadelphia: but the intelligence from thence is so clear and so strong, that it is certain, or nearly as much so as any event can be that is contingent, that they mean to abandon it. Against the various measures they are pursuing, which point to an evacuation, there is but one single circumstance opposed that I can learn, which is, that they are working at their redoubts with great in∣dustry. But this fact, though certainly true, cannot be of sufficient weight to raise a doubt upon the subject, and must be considered as merely calculated to deceive us, and to mask their design.</P>
<P>We cannot find out, notwithstanding the most diligent pains, whether their movement will be by land or sea; nor are the inhabitants of the town satisfied on the point. Appearances favour either. They have a great many ships, and very large: yet, from a preparation of boats at Prince's-Bay on the south side of Staten-Island which I am just advised of, and for some other reasons, a land route is not improbable.</P>
<P>I have detached to Jersey the whole of the troops of that State under general Maxwell, which, I flatter myself, with the militia general Dickinson will be able to collect, will give them some annoyance in case they attempt a re∣treat by land.</P>

<P>LIEUTENANT-colonel John Gibson, of the sixth Virginia regiment, who, from his knowledge of the western country, and Indian nations and language, is ordered to repair to Pittsburg, will have the honour of delivering you this. He is entitled, and has been ever since the twenty-fifth of October last, to a regiment in that line: and I must take the liberty to request that Congress will give him a commission of that date. The resolution of the

I do not know particularly to what regiment he ought to be appointed: Congress therefore will be pleased to give him a commission for a regiment from the State of Virginia, without mentioning the number.</P>

<P>I HAD the honour to receive your favour of the twenty-fifth instant by doctor Scudder, and that of the twenty-ninth, yesterday afternoon, with the inclosures and packet to which they referred.</P>
<P>I shall inform major Lee of the new arrangement of his corps, and will appoint the officers required. Major Beatty is not in camp. The letter addressed to him shall be sent by the first opportunity to Princeton, where I presume he will be found. That for captain Smith is already dis∣patched to him.</P>
<P>The enemy are yet in Philadelphia, though the whole chain of information for several days past afforded grounds to believe that they would have evacuated it before now. I should suppose they are nearly prepared to do it, though the removal of the stores and baggage of so large an army requires considerable time.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 1. I should be glad to know, in case Philadelphia is evacuated, whether any and what line of conduct is to be pursued respecting the goods that may be left. Such articles as come under the denomination of public stores will of course be taken by the proper officers for the use of the States. The point on which I wish direction is with respect to goods and merchandise, private property.
<PB N="263" REF="029737_0601_0FE29CFBB1794498"/>
I do not know whether any considerable quantity may be left: but, it has been suggested, that, from an expectation of the sort, there are some bringing into light their gold and silver for the purpose of buying up. If there should be clothing suitable for the army, perhaps there might be nothing unjust in the public's taking the preference, and Congress appointing one or two intelligent active persons of address, acquainted with the city and with those who have the goods, with proper powers to purchase them.</P>
<P>Whatever measure may be thought expedient, it will be necessary to adopt it as early as possible, as the evacua∣tion will probably take place in a short time. Robert Morris, esquire, I should imagine, if the purchasing scheme is determined on, will be able to point out proper persons. Some gentlemen have mentioned messieurs Samuel Howell and Thomas Franklyn as well qualified both an account of their integrity and attachment to our cause, and from their knowledge of the city and residence in it ever since the enemy had the possession.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that, agreeably to the resolutions transmitted in your favour of the thirty-first ul∣timo, I shall undertake the reform of the North-Carolina battalions in camp as soon as circumstances will admit.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish the legislatures of the several States had passed laws adopting the generous policy recommended by Congress in their resolution of the twenty-third of April. I am assured by authority not to be questioned, that, for want of this, hundreds, nay, thousands of people, and among them many valuable artizans with large quantities of goods, will be forced from Philadelphia, who otherwise would willingly remain. From report, their reluctance and distress upon this occasion are scarcely to be paralleled. There are a few whose conduct has been such, that no as∣surances of security, I presume, could induce them to stay:
<PB N="264" REF="029737_0602_0FE29C9B4F9040C0"/>
and their departure, compelled and founded as it were in the approbation of their own consciences, would answer all the purposes of example, especially if followed by a con∣fiscation of property. A proscribing system, or laws hav∣ing the same effect, when carried to a great extent, ever appeared to me to be impolitic: and their operation should always cease with the causes which produced them. Ex∣amples in terrorem are necessary: but to exile many of its inhabitants cannot be the interest of any State.</P>

<P>I have notified general Mifflin of the inquiry directed by Congress on the eleventh instant, by transmitting him a copy of their proceedings; and he has obtained leave, on his solicitation, to repair to York, &amp;c. to prepare for his defence. This I thought myself under a necessity of grant∣ing, however inconvenient and injurious it may be to per∣mit the absence of officers at this period.</P>
<P>Our expectations that Philadelphia will be evacuated in the course of a few days are again up. The information received yesterday through various channels, and in a pret∣ty direct way, would seem to place the matter almost on the footing of certainty.</P>
<P>We had about forty privates and twenty seamen ex∣changed on Sunday.

As yet I am not fully ascer∣tained of the enemy's destination; nor are there wanting a variety of opinions as to the route they will pursue, whether it will be by land or sea, admitting it to be to New-York.

could not find, after the maturest consideration on the sub∣ject, that his passage through the country could be in any wise material, or answer any other purpose than to spread disaffection.</P>
<P>I shall take every measure in my power to prevent an intercourse between the army and the enemy, and also be∣tween the inhabitants and the latter. You may rest as∣sured that whatever letters come from their lines shall be, as they ever have been, minutely inspected; and when∣ever they import any thing of an insidious cast, they shall be suppressed. In this I trust I shall not offend against any rule of right, nor the strictest propriety.</P>
<P>The letter for the commissioners I shall transmit by the earliest opportunity: however, their departure from Phila∣delphia will prevent their getting it as soon as they other∣wise would have done. I cannot say that I regret the delay: for there is no knowing to what acts of depreda∣tion and ruin their disappointed ambition might have led. And permit me to add that I think there was no other criterion for Congress to go by, than the one they have adopted. The proceedings of the twenty-second of April, it is probable, have reached Britain by this time, and will shew that the present powers of the commissioners,—or at least those we are obliged to suppose them to possess,—are wholly incompetent to any valuable end.</P>
<P>I have appointed general Arnold to command in Phila∣delphia, as the state of his wound will not permit his ser∣vices in a more active line. Colonel Jackson, with a detachment of troops, is to attend him: and I flatter my∣self that order will be preserved, and the several purposes answered, expressed by Congress in their resolution of the fourth instant.

<P>THE baron Steuben will have the honour to deliver you this. I do not know particularly the extent of his business at York: but, from what he has communicated, it is in part to get the duties and powers of his appoint∣ment minutely defined and settled. I inclose a copy of orders on the fifteenth instant, which were issued to quiet the minds of the general officers, and to remove a spirit of jealousy which but too apparently was rising among them. These contain my ideas of the principal duties of the in∣spector's office, and, I have reason to think, are generally agreeable to the army. While I am on this subject, I must do justice to the baron's intelligence, zeal, and in∣defatigable industry, from which we have experienced very happy effects.</P>
<P>The inclosed letter I transmit at the request of captain Gibbs; and I wish to recommend him to the considera∣tion of Congress. He has been in the army from the commencement of the war, and in the capacities which he mentions. When Congress were pleased to honour me with the appointment of officers for the sixteen additional battalions, I offered to make some provision for him: but this he declined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he commanded originally consisted of fifty men: but, since the arrival of baron S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>euben, it has been aug∣mented to a hundred and fifty. He advised that there should be a select corps of this number to receive the ma∣noeuvres in the first instance, and to act as a model to the army; and proposed that it should be formed of the old guard company and draughts from the line. I presume,—if it should be Congress's pleasure,—that a majority would be highly agreeable to the captain, and is as much as he expects.</P>

<P>I am now here with the main body of the army, and pressing hard to come up with the enemy. They encamp∣ed yesterday at Monmouth court-house, having almost the whole of their front, particularly their left wing, secured by a marsh and thick wood, and their rear by a difficult defile, from whence they moved very early this morning. Our advance, from the rainy weather, and the intense heat when it was fair, (though these may have been equally disadvan∣tageous to them) has been greatly delayed. Several of our men have fallen sick from these causes; and a few unfor∣tunately have fainted, and died in a little time after.</P>
<P>We have a select and strong detachment more forward, under the command of major-general Lee, with orders to attack their rear if possible. Whether the detachment will be able to come up with it, is a matter of question, especial∣ly before they get into strong grounds. Besides this, Mor∣gan, with his corps, and some bodies of militia, are on their flanks.</P>
<P>I cannot determine yet at what place they intend to em∣bark. Some think they will push for Sandy-Hook, whilst others suppose they mean to go to Shoal-harbour. The latter opinion seems to be founded in the greater probabil∣ity, as, from intelligence, several vessels and craft are lying off that place.</P>
<P>We have made a few prisoners; and they have lost a good many men by desertion. I cannot ascertain their number, as they came in to our advanced parties, and pushed immediately into the country.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I EMBRACE this first moment of leisure to give Congress a more full and particular account of the move∣ments of the army under my command since its passing the Delaware, than the situation of our affairs would heretofore permit.</P>
<P>I had the honour to advise them, that, on the appearances of the enemy's intention to march through Jersey be∣coming serious, I had detached general Maxwell's brigade in conjunction with the militia of that State to interrupt and impede their progress by every obstruction in their power, so as to give time to the army under my command to come up with them, and take advantage of any favourable cir∣cumstances that might present themselves. The army hav∣ing proceeded to Coryel's ferry and crossed the Delaware at that place, I immediately detached colonel Morgan with a select corps of six hundred men to reinforce general Max∣well, and marched with the main body towards Princeton.</P>
<P>The slow advance of the enemy had greatly the air of de∣sign, and led me, with others, to suspect that general Clin∣ton, desirous of a general action, was endeavouring to draw us down into the lower country, in order, by a rapid move∣ment,
<PB N="274" REF="029737_0612_0FE29CAC8E8C49F8"/>
to gain our right, and take possession of the strong grounds above us. This consideration, and to give the troops time to repose and refresh themselves from the fa∣tigues they had experienced from rainy and excessive hot weather, determined me to halt at Hopewell township about five miles from Princeton, where we remained till the morning of the twenty-fifth.</P>
<P>On the preceding day I made a second detachment of fifteen hundred chosen troops under brigadier-general Scott, to reinforce those already in the vicinity of the enemy, the more effectually to annoy and delay their march. The next day the army moved to Kingston; and having receiv∣ed intelligence that the enemy were prosecuting their route towards Monmouth court-house, I dispatched a thousand select men under brigadier-general Wayne, and sent the marquis De la Fayette to take the command of the whole advanced corps, including Maxwell's brigade and Morgan's light infantry, with orders to take the first fair opportunity of attacking the enemy's rear.</P>
<P>In the evening of the same day, the whole army march∣ed from Kingston, where our baggage was left, with inten∣tion to preserve a proper distance for supporting the advanc∣ed corps, and arrived at Cranberry early the next morning. The intense heat of the weather, and a heavy storm un∣luckily coming on, made it impossible to resume our march that day without great inconvenience and injury to the troops. Our advanced corps, being differently circum∣stanced, moved from the position it had held the night be∣fore, and took post in the evening on the Monmouth road about five miles from the enemy's rear, in expectation of at∣tacking them next morning on their march. The main body having remained at Cranberry, the advanced corps was found to be too remote, and too far upon the right, to be supported, in case of an attack either upon or from the enemy; which induced me to send orders to the marquis to file off by his left towards Englishtown, which he accordingly executed early in the morning of the twenty-seventh.</P>
<P>The enemy, in marching from Allentown, had changed their disposition, and placed their best troops in the rear, consisting of all the grenadiers, light infantry, and chasseurs
<PB N="275" REF="029737_0613_0FE29D0E0398BEF0"/>
of the line. This alteration made it necessary to increase the number of our advanced corps; in consequence of which, I detached major-general Lee with two brigades to join the marquis at Englishtown, on whom of course the command of the whole devolved, amounting to about five thousand men. The main body marched the same day, and encamped within three miles of that place. Morgan's corps was left hovering on the enemy's right flank; and the Jersey militia, amounting at this time to about seven or eight hundred men, under general Dickinson, on their left.</P>
<P>The enemy were now encamped in a strong position, with their right extending about a mile and a half beyond the court-house in the parting of the roads leading to Shrews∣bury and Middletown, and their left along the road from Allentown to Monmouth, about three miles on this side the court-house. Their right flank lay on the skirt of a small wood, while their left was secured by a very thick one,—a morass running towards their rear, and their whole front covered by a wood, and, for a considerable extent towards the left, with a morass. In this situation they halted till the morning of the twenty-eighth.</P>
<P>Matters being thus situated,—and having had the best information, that, if the enemy were once arrived at the heights of Middletown, ten or twelve miles from where they were, it would be impossible to attempt any thing against them with a prospect of success,—I determined to attack their rear the moment they should get in motion from their present ground. I communicated my intention to general Lee, and ordered him to make his disposition for the attack, and to keep his troops constantly lying upon their arms, to be in readiness at the shortest notice. This was done with respect to the troops under my immediate command.</P>
<P>About <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive in the morning, general Dickinson sent an express informing that the front of the enemy had begun their march. I instantly put the army in motion, and sent orders by one of my aides to general Lee to move on and attack them unless there should be very powerful reasons to the contrary—acquainting him at the same time, that I was marching to support him, and, for doing it
<PB N="276" REF="029737_0614_0FE29CAE12E3B180"/>
with the greater expedition and convenience, should make the men disencumber themselves of their packs and blankets.</P>
<P>After marching about five miles, to my great surprise and mortification, I met the whole advanced corps retreat∣ing,—and, as I was told, by general Lee's orders,—with∣out having made any opposition, except one fire, given by a party under the command of colonel Butler, on their being charged by the enemy's cavalry, who were repulsed. I proceeded immediately to the rear of the corps, which I found closely pressed by the enemy, and gave directions for forming part of the retreating troops, who, by the brave and spirited conduct of the officers, aided by some pieces of well served artillery, checked the enemy's advance, and gave time to make a disposition of the left wing and second line of the army upon an eminence, and in a wood a little in the rear, covered by a morass in front. On this were placed some batteries of cannon by lord Stirling who com∣manded the left wing, which played upon the enemy with great effect, and, seconded by parties of infantry detached to oppose them, effectually put a stop to their advance.</P>
<P>General Lee being detached with the advanced corps, the command of the right wing, for the occasion, was given to general Greene. For the expedition of the march, and to counteract any attempt to turn our right, I had ordered him to file off by the new church, two miles from En∣glishtown, and fall into the Monmouth road, a small distance in the rear of the court-house, while the rest of the column moved directly on towards the court-house. On intelli∣gence of the retreat, he marched up and took a very ad∣vantageous position on the right.</P>
<P>The enemy, by this time, finding themselves warmly opposed in front, made an attempt to turn our left flank: but they were bravely repulsed and driven back by detach∣ed parties of infantry. They also made a movement to our right with as little success, general Greene having ad∣vanced a body of troops with artillery to a commanding piece of ground; which not only disappointed their design of turning our right, but severely enfiladed those in front of the left wing. In addition to this, general Wayne advan∣ced with a body of troops, and kept up so severe and well-directed
<PB N="277" REF="029737_0615_0FE29D10F01F7540"/>
a fire, that the enemy were soon compelled to re∣tire behind the defile where the first stand in the beginning of the action had been made.</P>
<P>In this situation the enemy had both their flanks secured by thick woods and morasses, while their front could only be approached through a narrow pass. I resolved never∣theless to attack them; and, for that purpose, ordered general Poor, with his own and the Carolina brigade, to move round upon their right, and general Woodford upon their left, and the artillery to gall them in front. But the impediments in their way prevented their getting within reach before it was dark. They remained upon the ground they had been directed to occupy during the night, with intention to begin the attack early the next morning; and the army continued lying upon their arms in the field of action to be in readiness to support them.</P>
<P>In the mean time the enemy were employed in remov∣ing their wounded, and about twelve o'clock at night marched away in such silence, that, though general Poor lay extremely near them, they effected their retreat without his knowledge. They carried off all their wounded, ex∣cept four officers and about forty privates whose wounds were too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angerous to permit their removal.</P>
<P>The extreme heat of the weather, the fatigue of the men from their march through a deep sandy country al∣most entirely destitute of water, and the distance the ene∣my had gained by marching in the night, made a pursuit impracticable and fruitless: it would have answered no valuable purpose, and would have been fatal to numbers of our men, several of whom died the preceding day with heat.</P>
<P>Were I to conclude my account of this day's transac∣tions without expressing my obligations to the officers of the army in general, I should do injustice to their merit, and violence to my own feelings. They seemed to vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with each other in manifesting their zeal and bravery. The catalogue of those who distinguished themselves is too long to admit of particularizing individuals. I cannot, however, forbear mentioning brigadier-general Wayne, whose good conduct and bravery through the whole action deserves particular commendation.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="029737_0616_0FE29CB0E7F468A8"/>
The behaviour of the troops in general, after they re∣covered from the first surprise occasioned by the retreat of the advanced corps, was such as could not be surpassed. All the artillery, both officers and men, that were engag∣ed, distinguished themselves in a remarkable manner.</P>
<P>Inclosed, Congress will be pleased to receive a return of our killed, wounded, and missing. Among the first were lieutenant-colonel Bunner of Pennsylvania, and major Dickinson of Virginia, both officers of distinguished merit, and much to be regretted. The enemy's slain, left on the field, and buried by us, according to the return of the per∣sons assigned to that duty, were four officers and two hun∣dred and forty-five privates. In the former number was the honourable colonel Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kton. Exclusive of these, they buried some themselves, as there were several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> graves near the field of battle. How many men they may have had wounded, cannot be determined: but, from the usual proportion, the number must have been considerable. There were a few prisoners taken.</P>
<P>The peculiar situation of general Lee at this time re∣quires that I should say nothing of his conduct. He is now in arrest. The charges against him, with such sen∣tence as the court-martial may decree in his case, shall be transmitted for the approbation or disapprobation of Con∣gress, as soon as it shall be passed.</P>
<P>Being fully convinced by the gentlemen of this country that the enemy cannot be hurt or injured in their embark∣ation at Sandy-Hook, the place to which they are going,—and unwilling to get too far removed from the North-river,—I put the troops in motion early this morning, and shall proceed that way, leaving the Jersey brigade, Mor∣gan's corps, and other light parties (the militia being all dismissed) to hover about them, to countenance desertion, and to prevent their depredations as far as possible. After they embark, the former will take post in the neighbour∣hood of Elizabethtown, the latter rejoin the corps from which they were detached.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you, that, on Sun∣day morning, the left wing of the army moved towards the North-river; the right followed yesterday; and the second line, which forms the rear division, is also now in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion. I shall advance as fast as I can consistently with the circumstances of the weather and the health of the troops.</P>
<P>The enemy, from the advices of our parties of observa∣tion, were nearly if not all embarked yesterday. They have continued to desert upon all occasions.</P>
<P>I should be extremely happy if the committee appointed to arrange the army would repair to it as soon as possible.

The variety of hands in which the power▪ of grant∣ing of commissions and filling up vacancies is lodged,—and other circumstances,—have occasioned frequent instances of younger officers commanding their seniors, from the for∣mer having received their commissions, and the latter not,—and these, not only in the line of the army at large, but in their own brigades, and even in their own regiments. This, it will be readily conceived, is necessarily productive of much confusion, altercation and complaint, and requires the speediest remedy.</P>

<P>ON Friday evening, I had the honour to receive your letter of the seventh instant, with its inclosures. The vote of approbation and thanks, which Congress have been pleased to honour me with, gives me the highest satisfac∣tion, and at the same time demands a return of my sincerest acknowledgments. The other resolution I communicat∣ed
<PB N="280" REF="029737_0618_0FE29CB8850A2558"/>
with great pleasure to the army at large in yesterday's orders.</P>
<P>The left wing of the army, which advanced yesterday four miles beyond this, moved this morning on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards King's-ferry. The right, and second line, which makes the last division, are now here, where they will halt for a day or two,—or perhaps longer, if no circumstances of a pressing nature cast up,—in order to refresh themselves from the great fatigues they have suffered from the intense heat of the weather.</P>
<P>We have had it reported for two or three days through several channels from New-York, that there is a French fleet on the coast: and it is added that the enemy have been manning with the utmost dispatch several of their ships of war which were there, and have pushed them out to sea. How far these facts are true, I cannot determine: but I should think it of infinite importance to ascertain the first, if possible, by sending out swift-sailing cruisers. The most interesting advantages might follow the information. I will try, by every practicable means that I can devise, to obtain an accurate account of the enemy's fleet at New-York.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour yesterday evening of receiving your very important favour of the tenth instant. Colonel Laurens, one of my aides, will set out this morning with a letter to the French admiral, the count D'Estaing, in∣closing a copy of yours, and such other information as I have been able to collect. Its further purpose is for the establishing a convention of signals in case of co-operation, or to convey him such knowledge of the enemy's naval force and position, as may from time to time come under our cognizance.</P>
<P>It appears by intelligence of to-day that the count D'Es∣taing is off or near Sandy-Hook, having already seized several fishing-boats on the Banks, in order to procure in∣formation and pilots.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="029737_0619_0FE29D1B32756F48"/>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the fourteenth, I have been favoured with your letters of the eleventh and seventeenth, with their respective inclosures. The next morning after the receipt of the former which came to hand on the seventeenth, I dispatched lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, another of my aides, with the best pi∣lots and the most skilful masters of ships I could procure, to admiral count D'Estaing, to converse with him more f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly on the subject of his operations, than I was able to direct lieutenant-colonel Laurens to do for want of the information which I afterwards obtained from major Chouin, and a knowledge in several other points besides.</P>
<P>On Sunday night Mr. Laurens returned; and I found by him that it was the count's first wish to enter at Sandy-Hook, in order to possess himself of, or to destroy, if pos∣sible, the whole of the British fleet lying in the bay of New-York; and that, for this purpose, he had been much engaged in his inquiries about the depth of water, and in sounding the channel to ascertain it; the result of which was, that the water, from the experiments made, was too shallow at the entrance to admit his large ships,—or, if they could be got in, it appeared that it would not be without a great deal of difficulty and risk. After this disappointment, the next important object which seemed to present itself was an attempt against Rhode-Island, which the count in∣clined to make (unless I should advise the contrary) as soon as the Chimere frigate, which had carried his excellency monsieur Girard into the Delaware, should rejoin him.</P>
<P>Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who was well informed of our situation and of my sentiments on every point, was in∣structed to give the admiral a full and accurate state of facts, and to acquaint him what aid and how far we could
<PB N="282" REF="029737_0620_0FE29CBB9F194208"/>
co-operate with him in case of an attempt either against New-York or Rhode-Island; and also to obtain his ideas of the plan and system which he might think ought to be pursued, and to agree with him on certain signals.</P>
<P>Previous to my dispatching Mr. Hamilton, from the in∣formation I received on my inquiries respecting the navi∣gation at the Hook, I was led to suspect (however inter∣esting and desirable the destruction or capture of the British fleet might be) that it was not sufficient to introduce the count's ships. Under this apprehension, I wrote general Sullivan on the seventeenth by express, that an expedition might take place in a short time against Rhode-Island, and urged him at the same time to apply to the States of Mas∣sachusetts, Rhode-Island and Connecticut, for as many men as would augment his force to five thousand, and also to make every possible preparation of boats, provision, pilots, &amp;c. as if the event was fixed and certain.</P>
<P>From this time till about twelve o'clock on Sunday, the troops continued passing the river, when I crossed with the last division. On Monday afternoon I arrived at this place, in the neighbourhood of which, the right and left wing encamped that night, with the second line a few miles in their rear. And here I am happy to add that their passage across the river was effected without any ac∣cident, or without any more delay than necessarily attend∣ed the work.</P>
<P>Being persuaded now, from the conversation which I have had with several pilots and masters of vessels, of char∣acter, as well as from the accounts of other gentlemen, and colonel Laurens's report on his return, that the passing of the count's ships by the Hook would be extremely preca∣rious, if not impracticable,—I determined yesterday (which was as soon as it could be done) without waiting for fur∣ther intelligence upon the subject, to put two brigades un∣der marching orders. They accordingly marched this morning at two o'clock, for Rhode Island, under the par∣ticular command of generals Varnum and Glover respect∣ively, and both under the direction, for the present, of the marquis De la Fayette. A water conveyance was thought of and wished for the ease of the troops: but, on consid∣eration of all circumstances▪ such as the difficulty of pro∣viding
<PB N="283" REF="029737_0621_0FE29D1CB5C49660"/>
vessels, the change and precariousness of the winds, the risk from the enemy's ships, &amp;c. their route by land was deemed by far the more eligible. The force with general Sullivan, from the best and latest advice I have been able to obtain, is about three thousand. A detach∣ment under colonel Jackson will follow Varnum's and Glover's brigades.</P>
<P>The inclosed papers, N<SUP>o</SUP> 1, respecting eight persons sent from Bennington, and ordered into the enemy's lines, came to hand yesterday. About the same time I received a letter from governor Clinton, containing a petition by the prisoners, and a letter from the committee of Albany, all r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>monstrating against the proceeding. As this is a matter in which I have no authority to act, nor in which I would wish to intermeddle, I take the liberty of referring it to Congress, that they may decide upon it. The prisoners are at West-Point, and ordered to be detained there for the present.</P>
<P>I would also take the liberty of transmitting to Con∣gress a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from captain Gibbs, and of recommending him to their consideration. His letter was to have been sent by the baron Steuben before we marched from Valley-Forge: but his declining to go to Yorktown at that time, and our move through the Jerseys, delayed its being done. The captain has been in the army from the commence∣ment of the war, and in the capacities which he mentions. When Congress were pleased to honour me with the ap∣pointment of officers for the sixteen additional battalions, I offered to make some provision for him: but this he de∣clined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he originally commanded consisted of fifty men; but, since the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. The baron advised that there should be a select corps of this number to receive the manoeuvres in the first instance, and to act as a model to the army; and proposed that it should be formed of the old guard company, and draughts from the line. I presume, if it should be Congress's pleasure, a majority would be highly acceptable to the captain, and that it is as much as he expects.</P>
<P><HI>Eleven o'clock, P. M.</HI> I this moment received a letter from colonel Hamilton who is on his return to the army,
<PB N="284" REF="029737_0622_0FE29CBD256A27D0"/>
dated the twentieth at Black-Point. He informs that the count D'Estaing would sail the next evening for Rhode-Island, being convinced from actual soundings that he could not enter his ships. He was anxiously waiting the arrival of the Chimere, but, at all events, meant to sail at the time he mentions. The admiral has agreed on signals with Mr. Hamilton. Immediately after this letter came to hand, my aide, Mr. Laurens, set out for Providence, having many things to communicate to general Sullivan upon the subject of his co-operation, which neither time nor propriety would suffer me to commit to paper. Gen∣eral Sullivan is directed not to confine the number of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oops to five thousand, but to augment it, if he shall judge it necessary to insure his success.</P>
<P>I was informed by Mr. Laurens, that the count D'Es∣taing's magazine of bread is not so large as we could wish, and that in the course of a few weeks he will be in want. This circumstance I thought it right to mention: and I should suppose that any quantity of biscuit may be provided in a little time at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The inclosures, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2, are copies of three letters from myself to the admiral. I flatter myself the present of stock, which I directed for him, on his first arrival, in behalf of the States, will be approved by Congress.</P>
<P>The accounts from the western frontiers of Tryon coun∣ty are distressing. The spirit of the savages seems to be roused, and they appear determined on mischief and havoc in every quarter. By a letter from governor Clinton, of the twenty-first, they have destroyed Springfield and An∣dreas town, and are marching towards the settlements on the west branch of the Delaware. These incursions are extremely embarrassing to our other affairs, and I think will justify a conclusion that Sir Henry Clinton's intention was to operate up the North-river. Whether it may have changed with circumstances, cannot be determined.</P>
<P>I have detached the fourth Pennsylvania regiment and the remains of Morgan's corps, under lieutenant-colonel Butler, and also colonel Graham with a York State regi∣ment, to co-operate with the militia, and to check the In∣dians if possible. Colonel Butler is an enterprising good officer, and well acquainted with the savage mode of war∣fare:
<PB N="285" REF="029737_0623_0FE29D1E399E0FA0"/>
and I am persuaded whatever comes within the compass of his force and abilities, will be done.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE baron De Steuben will have the honour of delivering you this. I am extremely sorry that this gen∣tleman's situation and views seem to have determined him to quit the service, in which he has been heretofore and is capable still of being extensively useful. Some discontents, which arose among the officers on account of the powers with which the office was at first vested, induced me to ar∣range the duties of it upon a plan different from that on which it began. The moving state of the army has for some time past, in a great degree, suspended the exercise of the inspectorate. When the troops marched from Bruns∣wic, the scarcity of general officers,—most of them being engaged with the court-martial either as members or wit∣nesses,—occasioned my giving the baron a temporary com∣mand of a division during the march. On our arrival near our present encampment, I intended he should relin∣quish this charge, and resume his former office, for which purpose a general order was accordingly issued. But I find that he is entirely disinclined to the measure, and re∣solves not to continue in the service unless he can hold an actual command in the line.</P>
<P>Justice concurring with inclination constrains me to testi∣fy, that the baron has in every instance discharged the sev∣eral trusts reposed in him with great zeal and ability, so as to give him the fullest title to my esteem, as a brave, inde∣fatigable, judicious and experienced officer. I regret there should be a necessity that his services should be lost to the army: at the same time I think it my duty explicitly to observe to Congress, that his desire of having an actual and permanent command in the line cannot be complied with, without wounding the feelings of a number of officers whose rank and merits give them every claim to attention; and that the doing it would be productive of much dissatisfac∣tion
<PB N="286" REF="029737_0624_0FE29CBEAD097EC8"/>
and extensive ill consequences. This does not pro∣ceed from any personal objections on the part of those of∣ficers against the baron:—on the contrary, most of them, whom I have heard speak of him, express a high sense of his military worth. It proceeds from motives of another nature which are too obvious to need particular explana∣tion, or may be summed up in this, that they conceive such a step would be injurious to their essential rights and just expectations. That this would be their way of thinking upon the subject, I am fully convinced, from the effect which the temporary command given him, even under cir∣cumstances so peculiar as those I have mentioned, produced: the strongest symptoms of discontent appeared upon the occasion.</P>

<PB N="287" REF="029737_0625_0FE29D2A44A57018"/>
have resulted from the establishment, which I conceive have proceeded principally from the total independ∣ence of the commissary-general of military stores on the commanding officer of artillery. It seems some alterations are necessary: and what they shall be, Congress will be pleased to determine.</P>
<P>It is not without reluctance that I am constrained to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my importunities on the subject of the committee of ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gement. The present unsettled state of the army is productive of so much dissatisfaction and confusion, and of such a variety of disputes, that almost the whole of my time is now employed in finding temporary and inade∣quate expedients to quiet the minds of the officers, and keep business on a tolerable sort of footing. Not an hour passes without new applications and new complaints about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k: and, for want of a proper adjustment of this and many other essential points, our affairs are in a most irksome and injurious train. We can scarcely form a court-mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> or parade a detachment in any instance, without a warm discussion on the subject of precedence; and there are sev∣eral good officers now who are fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to decline duty, to prevent disputes, and their being commanded by oth∣er who upon every principle are their inferiors, unless their having obtained commissions before them (from the opportunities they had of making earlier applications, from local circumstances) should be considered sufficient to give them a superior claim. There are many other causes of dis∣satisfaction on this head: but I will not enter into a mi∣nute relation of them. I sincerely wish that the gentlemen appointed, or such others as Congress may think proper to nominate for the occasion, would immediately repair to camp:—the present opportunity is favourable for reducing matters to system and order; and, from painful experience, I know there is an absolute necessity for it.</P>
<P>I should also hope that Congress will excuse me for mentioning again the necessity there is for appointing some brigadiers. The Massachusetts, by the resignation of gen∣eral Learned, wants one: Pennsylvania, as general Hand is not here, has but one with the army: Maryland, which has two large brigades in the field, has only general Small-wood; and the North-Carolina troops, since the departure
<PB N="288" REF="029737_0626_0FE29CCA9F281AD0"/>
of general M<SUP>c</SUP>Intosh, have been without any. As I had taken the liberty upon a former occasion to offer my senti∣ments to Congress and their committee upon this subject, I should not trouble them now, if I was not more and more convinced that the service required promotions in this line. The frequent changes which take place among the officers, where there are no brigadiers, are attended with great in∣convenience and detriment; and they are an effectual bar to the introduction of discipline. In such cases, the officers know that their command is but temporary, always liable to cease; and therefore they do not find themselves suffi∣ciently interested to promote order and subordination; nor will the rest look up to them with that respect and defer∣ence which are essential. Every day's experience proves this, and shews beyond question that the affairs of a brigade can never be in a right train without a brigadier or some general officer to direct them. It is certain these appoint∣ments, at the first view, will add a little to the list of expense: but in the end they will be a great saving, and produce many important advantages. We are also a good deal distressed at this time for major-generals. However, as this arises more from the peculiar circumstances and situ∣ation of many which prevent them from duty in the line, than from a deficiency in the number appointed, I shall not add upon the occasion.</P>
<P>There is another branch of the army, which, in my opin∣ion, calls loudly for the appointment of a general officer,—and this is the cavalry. For want of a proper regulating head in this corps, the whole has been in confusion, and of but very little service; whereas, under a right management, it might be most useful. The principal officers in it do not harmonize; which circumstance, with their disputes about rank, would (were there no other objections) effectually prevent the corps from rendering the public the services they have a right to expect, and of which it should be ca∣pable. To promote any gentlemen now in it to a general command, would not be acquiesced in by the rest—nor do I know that any of them wish it; and it would increase their misunderstanding, and, of course, disorder.</P>
<P>I mean to draw all the horse immediately together, when I trust they will be under the direction of a general officer
<PB N="289" REF="029737_0627_0FE29D2BC8304870"/>
appointed by Congress for the purpose. Who he shall be, will remain solely with them to determine. However, I will take the liberty to add that he should be intelligent, active, attentive; and, as far as I can judge, general Cad∣wallader or general Reed would fill the post with great honour and advantage; though it would seem, from the seat the latter has taken in Congress, and from his late appoint∣ment to the council of Pennsylvania, as if he had declined every military view. The abilities of these gentlemen, as well as their attachment, are generally known; and I am led to believe that either would be as acceptable to the corps as any person that can be found. Indeed I have learned as much from two of the colonels.</P>
<P>I have been waiting with the most impatient anxiety to hear of count D'Estaing's arrival at Rhode-Island; but as yet I have not been so happy. My last intelligence from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hence is a letter from general Sullivan, dated at ten o'clock in the forenoon of the twenty-seventh, when he had no advice of the fleet. He was in high spirits; and, from the preparation in which matters were, he entertained the most flattering hopes of success in the intended enter∣prise. The brigades of Varnum and Glover, with Jack∣son's detachment, would arrive, I expect, on the second instant.</P>
<P>As the army was encamped, and there was no great pros∣pect of a sudden removal, I judged it adviseable to send general Greene to the eastward on Wednesday last, being fully persuaded his services, as well in the quarter-master line as in the field, would be of material importance in the expedition against the enemy in that quarter. He is inti∣mately acquainted with the whole of that country, and be∣sides, he has an extensive interest and influence in it. And, in justice to general Greene, I take occasion to observe that the public is much indebted to him for his judicious management and active exertions in his present department. When he entered upon it, he found it in a most confused, distracted and destitute state. This, by his conduct and industry, has undergone a very happy change, and such as enabled us with great facility to make a sudden move with the whole army and baggage from Valley-Forge in pursuit of the enemy, and to perform a march to this place. In
<PB N="290" REF="029737_0628_0FE29CCC58E52370"/>
a word, he has given the most general satisfaction, and his affairs carry much the face of method and system. I also consider it as an act of justice to speak of the conduct of colonel Wadsworth, commissary-general. He has been in∣defatigable in his exertions to provide for the army; and, since his appointment, our supplies of provision have been good and ample.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 4. At seven o'clock in the evening yesterday, I received the inclosed letter from general Sullivan, with one addressed to myself, a copy of which I do myself the pleas∣ure of forwarding. I am exceedingly happy in the count's arrival, and that things wear so pleasing an aspect.</P>
<P>There is another subject on which I must take the liber∣ty of addressing Congress, which is that of the clothier's department. I am perfectly satisfied, that unless this very important and interesting office is put under better regula∣tions, the army will never be clothed. * * * I believe both officers and men, particularly the latter, have suffered greater inconveniences and distresses than soldiers ever did before, for want of clothing; and that this has not flowed more from a real scarcity of articles, than a want of proper exertions and provident management to procure them. It is essential that something should be done, and immediate∣ly, to place the department on a better footing. We have now a great many men entirely destitute of shirts and breech∣es, and I suppose not less than a fourth or fifth of the whole here who are without shoes. From the deficiencies in this line, numbers of desertions have proceeded,—not to men∣tion deaths: and what is still worse, the troops which re∣main, and see themselves in rags, want that spirit and pride necessary to constitute the soldier.</P>
<P>I have been informed by several officers, and by such as I can depend on, that many of the late draughts are willing and desirous of enlisting during the war. I do not con∣ceive myself at liberty to give direction on the point, and therefore submit it to Congress to decide. However, if they can be engaged for the usual bounties allowed by the contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, after proper precautions are taken to prevent fraud, I think the measure will be expedient. It is true, our affairs have an agreeable aspect at present: but the war may continue, and we—want men. A third of the
<PB N="291" REF="029737_0629_0FE29D2D4D94BAF8"/>
time of some of them, and a half in the case of others, is already expired; and as they will rise in their views, and become more difficult in proportion as their service draws to a conclusion,—if the step is considered adviseable, the sooner we attempt to enlist, the better in all probability will the work succeed.</P>

<HEAD>[The following letter, without date, appears to have been written about the fifteenth of August, 1778.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Fuhrer and Mr. Kleinsmit have lately left the British lines, and come in to us. The account they give of themselves is this, that they had been first-lieuten∣ants in the Hessian corps, were taken prisoners at Trenton, resided during their captivity at Dumfries in Virginia, were lately exchanged, and have since resigned their commissions; that having solicited permission to come out from the enemy, and being refused, they determined to leave them at all hazards, and have now put their design in execution. The circumstances of their captivity are known to several of∣ficers in our army.</P>
<P>They are desirous of entering into our service, observing that there are a number of German officers in the same disposition with themselves, who will resign and join us, if they find that these meet with proper countenance. It ap∣pears to me that important advantages may attend the en∣couraging a disposition of this nature (if it really exists,—which is far from being impossible) from the influence it will necessarily have upon the soldiery by increasing that spirit of desertion and discontent which already prevails among them.</P>
<P>Congress will best judge of the propriety of employing these gentlemen. I have been thinking in what manner it might be done: and the mode least exceptionable, which at pres∣ent occurs to me, is to authorise them to raise a corps for themselves by enlisting such German inhabitants, and such deserters from the foreign troops, as may be willing to en∣gage. The corps at first, as it is only by way of experi∣ment, need not be large, but may be afterwards increased
<PB N="294" REF="029737_0632_0FE29CCF64936358"/>
as circumstances shall point out. This measure, I appre∣hend, cannot be attended with any material inconvenience, and may be productive of utility. If the gentlemen are employed at all, it must be in a new corps, as they could not be introduced into any of those already formed, with∣out injuring the officers in them, and producing dissatisfac∣tion, murmurs, and resignations.</P>
<P>I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded them on the plan here suggested, and they seem to be very sanguine in its success, and anxious to undertake it. They expect some augmentation in rank; and indeed it seems necessary, in order the more effectually to interest others to follow their example: but caution should be used not to carry the idea too far, because, be∣sides other weighty considerations, the higher the rank con∣ferred on them, the more difficult it will be to provide for those who may hereafter come to us, and who will of course frame their expectations by comparison.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you to-day by captain Riley, I received a letter from general Sullivan, a copy of which you have inclosed. From this it appears the count D'Estaing had not returned with his squadron on the thirteenth instant: and there is reason to fear, from the violence of the weather ever since, that he has not yet got in. This accident has much deranged our views; and I shall be happy if it does not totally defeat our enterprise against Rhode-Island. I feel much for the count.

<P>I DO myself the honour of transmitting to Congress the inclosed memorial of colonel Rawlings, presented in behalf of himself and the Maryland officers who were un∣der his command in the year 1776. The facts which are stated in it are generally true: and I cannot but feel myself exceedingly interested in favour of these gentlemen. The conduct of this whole corps, when Fort-Washington was attacked, is so generally known and approved, that it is al∣most unnecessary to add upon the subject. However, I think it but justice to observe that every representation of that day's transaction gave them the highest credit. They fought with a degree of veteran bravery; and, though but a handful, they maintained their ground a considerable time, notwithstanding the most vigorous efforts to force them. All who were spectators upon the occasion have declared this; and the enemy themselves have not refused them applause.</P>
<P>It seems hard that officers of their merit should be over∣looked,—and a loss to the service that they should remain unemployed: but the consequences that would attend their
<PB N="297" REF="029737_0635_0FE29D3A46971688"/>
incorporation with any of the corps now existing appear too disagreeable to try the experiment. Colonel Rawlings himself, from the information I have had, does not incline to give any uneasiness to the line of the army, and would rather make a distant part of it against the Indians, in case he could be provided for in that way. Captain Beall, who is charged with this, will be able to inform Congress more fully than I can of the wishes of the colonel and the rest of his officers; and his account may lead perhaps to some suitable and practicable provision for them. As I have observed before, they are men who deserve well of their country. I only mention the Maryland officers upon this occasion, because that part of the corps which came from Virginia was provided for by the State in their present ar∣rangement, as I have been credibly advised.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawlings was never in the complete and actual command of the regiment under his direction as colonel, because he never obtained a commission: but he became entitled to it according to the then common rule of promo∣tion by the death of colonel Stephenson, and the non-accept∣ance of colonel Morgan who was appointed to it. Of the latter circumstance, Mr. Rawlings, I am persuaded, was never apprised, as it was kept a secret from an apprehension that the enemy might claim an officer of the rank of colo∣nel in exchange for Morgan who was then a prisoner on parole, if his promotion came to their knowledge. Major Williams, of the Maryland part of the corps, was appointed by the State to one of her regiments now in the field, and is the only officer in his predicament I know of, that they arranged.</P>

<P>I WOULD take the liberty to inform Congress that colonel Armand is come to camp with his corps, and has applied to me for commissions for his officers. By the resolution for establishing the corps, it was to be officered out of the foreigners then commissioned in our service, who were not nor could be provided for in any of the regiments. Instead of this, there are only three officers in this corps who before held any commissions in our service, viz. lieu∣tenant-colonel Vrigney, and captains Mercley and Shafner. The two last were only lieutenants, and are now appointed to captaincies, contrary (it seems to me) to the spirit and intention of the resolution.</P>
<P>As colonel Armand has departed from his instructions which must govern me, I am not authorised to grant the commissions he requires, and am therefore under the ne∣cessity of troubling Congress with the arrangement of the corps, N<SUP>o</SUP> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as it now actually stands for their considera∣tion and decision. The colonel founds his deviation from the resolve upon some verbal intimation given him that the part in question would not be insisted on.</P>
<P>I would also take the liberty to mention that general Du Portail lately delivered me a memorial, in which, among other things, he represents that he had made an agreement with Congress at his first appointment, that nei∣ther himself nor the other gentlemen with him should ever be commanded by any of the engineers who had preceded them in our army. I could not but answer that the com∣missions of officers were the only rule of precedency and command I had to judge by; and, while others held su∣perior appointments, I must consider them accordingly in the course of service. He gave me the inclosed letter to you upon the subject, and is extremely anxious to leave the matter placed upon a certain footing; and, no doubt, it will be for the good and tranquillity of the service that the claim be determined as speedily as possible one way or the other. At the same time I think it right to observe, that it cannot be expected that colonel Cosciu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ko, who has been a good while in this line, and conducted himself with rep∣utation

<P>Since I had the honour of writing you on the twenty-fifth instant, I have not received a single line from general Sullivan. The only intelligence I have from the eastward is from monsieur Pontjobeau. This gentleman left Rhode-Island the twenty-seventh, and arrived about two hours ago in camp. From him I learn that our people were still on the island;—that it was generally thought they had made effectual provision for a retreat in case of exigency;—that in the evening of that day he met monsieur Preville, an officer belonging to the Languedoc, at Providence, go∣ing with dispatches to general Sullivan,—who informed him that the French fleet had got into Boston. He further adds, that monsieur Calonne who was in company with him at Providence, and who had more conversation with mon∣sieur Preville than he himself had, told him that monsieur Preville said count D'Estaing had sailed or was on the point of sailing again for Rhode-Island with ten ships of the line and his frigates.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honour of transmitting you a copy of a letter I this minute received from general Sullivan. I congratulate Congress on the repulse of the enemy, and only wish our troops may be able to effect a retreat, which seems the most eligible measure they can pursue in the present situation of things.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favour of the twenty-eighth and that of the thirtieth ultimo, with the several inclosures to which they refer.</P>
<P>Congress may rely that I will use every possible means in my power to conciliate any differences that may have arisen in consequence of the count D'Estaing's going to Boston, and to prevent a publication of the protest upon the occasion. Several days before the receipt of the reso∣lution, I had written to the eastward, urging the necessity of harmony, and the expediency of affording the admiral every assistance to refit his ships. This I repeated after the resolution came to hand; and I have also taken op∣portunity to request all the general officers here to place the matter in the most favourable point of view whenever they hear it mentioned.</P>
<P>The five hundred guineas, which Congress were pleased to order, came safe to hand, and shall be appropriated to the purposes they intended, and as the exigency of the ser∣vice may require. For want of supplies of this sort, we have been very deficient in intelligence in many important and interesting points. In some cases, no consideration in paper money has been found sufficient to effect even an engagement to procure it: and, where it has been other∣wise, the terms of service, on account of the depreciation, have been high, if not exorbitant.</P>
<P>The designs of the enemy, as to their future movements, remain yet entirely [<HI>in the dark:</HI>] but the expectation of their leaving the continent is daily decreasing. The hur∣ricane season seems opposed to their going to the West-Indies; and the passage to Europe in a little time will become more and more dangerous. Besides these, there is another circumstance, of some weight, if true, to induce a belief that they mean to stay. It appears by the papers that part of the regiments lately raised in Britain are order∣ed to Halifax. If the troops here were intended to be recalled, it would seem that some of them would be sent to reinforce that garrison sooner than troops from England or Scotland; and hence I think it may be presumed that another campaign will take place in America, especially if
<PB N="302" REF="029737_0640_0FE29D3D4EDC6D98"/>
administration are disappointed in their expectations from the commission.</P>
<P>Where the theatre of war may be, must be a matter of conjecture. But, as it is an acknowledged fact that an army acting in the eastern States must derive flour for its support from those more western, I submit to Congress the expediency, and, in my opinion, the necessity of establish∣ing, without loss of time, magazines of this article at con∣venient places (removed from the Sound) in Connecticut and Massachusetts. I am the more induced to wish an early consideration of this point, as, by a sudden move of the army (should events make it necessary) the departments of commissary and quarter-master would be greatly distress∣ed. Nor would such magazines, I should imagine, be at∣tended with any considerable loss, though the army should not operate in that quarter, as the flour would answer oc∣casionally for our shipping, and the surplus might in all probability be otherwise readily disposed of.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of transmitting to Congress a memorial I received from the reverend Mr. Tetard. From the cer∣tificates annexed to it, he appears to be a man of great mer∣it: and, from every account, he has suffered in the ex∣treme in the present contest. His attachment, services, and misfortunes, seem to give him a claim to a generous notice: but, according to the new establishment of the army, it is not in my power to make any provision for him. I therefore recommend his case to the attention and con∣sideration of Congress.</P>
<P><HI>Six o'clock, P. M.</HI> I this minute received a letter from general Sullivan, of which the inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2, is a copy. I shall be exceedingly happy if a perfect reconciliation has taken place between him and the count and all the officers. His letter will shew some of the reasons that led to the protest, and that it was the hope of our officers that it would have operated as a justification to the admir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, to return against the sentiments of his council, especially as it coincided (as it is said) with his own inclination. I had these reasons from another hand when the protest first came.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 5. I was duly honoured yesterday evening wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h your favour of the thirty-first ultimo. Though it is
<PB N="303" REF="029737_0641_0FE29DA7AEBF2DA8"/>
not expressed in the resolution of that date that any other bounty is to be given to the men who engage for three years or during the war, than twenty dollars, I shall take it for granted they are to receive the usual allowances of clothing and land. There are several continental troops whose time of service will expire at the end of the fall or during the winter. I shall consider these within the mean∣ing and operation of the resolve, though they are not mentioned; and shall direct every necessary measure to be taken to re-enlist them.</P>
<P>From the exorbitant state, town, and substitute boun∣ties, I am very doubtful whether twenty dollars will be found sufficient to engage so great a proportion either of the draughts or continentals, as was at first apprehended. Our failure in the enterprise against Rhode-Island will have its weight; and every day, from the approach of the fall and winter, will add new difficulties. As it is a work of the most essential importance, I will order it to be be∣gun the instant the money arrives: and lest, on experi∣ment, the sum should prove too small, I would submit it to Congress whether it will not be expedient to pass another resolve, authorising a further bounty of ten dollars, to be used as circumstances may make it necessary. This can remain a secret, and will not be carried into execution but in case of evident necessity. I feel very much interested upon the occasion, and have submitted this mode, that there may not be the least possible delay in attempting to engage the men under a second expedient if the first should not succeed. The articles of clothing and blankets should also employ the utmost attention to provide them: we are now in great want, particularly of the latter; there not being less than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> actually wanted at this moment.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the pleasure to hear this morning, by a let∣ter from general Sullivan, of the thirty-first ultimo, that he had effected a retreat to the main, the preceding night, without any loss either of men or stores. As he has writ∣ten to Congress fully upon the subject, and I feel their anxiety to hear it, I shall not detain major Morris longer than to observe that I think the retreat a most fortunate, lucky, and well-timed event.</P>
<P>Major Morris informs me he has heard that lord Howe was off Boston with his fleet: and it appears by a New-York paper of the second, that rear-admiral Parker arrived at Sandy-Hook on this day week with six ships of the line, of seventy-four guns each,—which is corroborated by other accounts. I transmitted the intelligence to his ex∣cellency count D'Estaing yesterday and the day before, as it acquired more and more the appearance of certainty,—as I have regularly done every occurrence interesting to his fleet and our operations.</P>

<P>I TAKE the liberty of laying before Congress the inclosed copies of a paragraph and schedule contained in a letter from general Heath, which I lately received. These will apprise Congress, if they are not already informed, of the supplies of provision and wood wanted by the count D'Estaing, and will naturally lead to a consideration of the ways and means to be pursued for furnishing them as soon as possible.</P>
<P>Since I had the honour of addressing you on the fourth and fifth instant, I have obtained a return of the blankets which are now deficient. This, and the fast approach of the fall, will suggest the necessity of the most vigorous ex∣ertions being used to procure them. Not a night will pass from this time without the soldiers feeling the want.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour of returning to Congress the report of their committee on the subject of an inspec∣torship (transmitted in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, which was not received till the thirty-first) with such ob∣servations as have occurred to me in considering the mat∣ter, and which I have made with a freedom that I trust will be agreeable to Congress. I wish it had been in my power to have returned it before: but the intervention of a variety of other important business from time to time obliged me to postpone a conclusion upon the points till yesterday.</P>
<P>I have already, in a letter of the twenty-sixth of July, delivered my sentiments upon the consequences that would attend the baron Steuben's being appointed to an actual and permanent command in the line; and therefore I will not trouble Congress with a repetition of them. How∣ever, I will take the liberty to add that I am more and more convinced that what I then said upon the occasion was well founded; and that I am certain such a measure will produce at least infinite discontents and disquietudes among the general officers.</P>
<P>I have also had the honour to receive your favour of the fifth instant, with the several papers to which it refers. These shall have my attention as far as practicable. I hope all the confederate troops are on the march from Phila∣delphia, and, if they are not, that immediate orders will be given for their joining the army.</P>
<P>The inclosed copy of a letter from general Sullivan, of the tenth instant, will inform Congress that the enemy have not relinquished their burning plans, and that in this way they have destroyed several houses, stores, and vessels, at and near Bedford.</P>
<P>I was advised on Wednesday night that a body of them, consisting of four or five thousand, under general Grey, had made a landing in that quarter, and were intrenching. In consequence of this, and from an apprehension that general Clinton might possibly mean to operate to the eastward and form some project in concert with lord Howe against the count D'Estaing's squadron, I determined to move the
<PB N="306" REF="029737_0644_0FE29D4B48EC2A18"/>
troops from this ground to a rear position, better calculated to afford support to the works on the North-river in case an attempt should be made against them, and at the same time more convenient for forwarding detachments to the eastward, if the enemy point their operations that way.</P>
<P>I was the more induced to come to this determination as most of the accounts from New-York seemed to lead to a belief, as they still do, that a considerable movement was and is in contemplation, if not an entire evacuation of the city, and this by water. Besides these reasons, the princi∣pal objects for taking post here do not now exist. One was to create every possible jealousy in favour of the expe∣dition against Rhode-Island; another, the consuming the forage within its vicinity and towards Kingsbridge. The former is now over, and the latter in a great degree ac∣complished.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the twelfth instant, I have received your several favours of the tenth, twelfth and sixteenth, with the resolutions to which they allude. I transmitted the British commissioners the resolve of the fourth instant respecting the convention troops the morning after it came to hand, and also wrote to Sir Henry Clinton upon the subject of passports. I have not received his answer.</P>
<P>With respect to the magazines, I have directed the com∣missary to form them on the inland communication from hence to Boston, at proper intervals. The twenty thou∣sand barrels of flour that Congress have ordered to be pur∣chased will be a valuable addition, if they can be transport∣ed by water: but it seems to me there will be great risk of its being lost, if it is sent by sea while the enemy have a su∣perior fleet on our coast.</P>
<P>As the campaign is not closed yet, all our cavalry are of use. They lie in the neighbourhood of the enemy's posts, for the purpose of restraining their parties, and for obtain∣ing and giving intelligence of their movements; and they
<PB N="307" REF="029737_0645_0FE29DAAB70FBBD0"/>
are subsisted upon the forage which would otherwise be ex∣posed to them. I am sensible that these corps are attended with great expense; and the moment I think the service will admit of it, they or a part of them shall be quartered in different places distant from the army, where they may be provided for on better terms. The price of forage, and the difficulty of getting it, are really objects of great magnitude, and such as should undergo some regulation, if there is any that can be adopted. I received letters a few days ago from the commissary and quarter-master upon this subject, copies of which, and of my letter in consequence to the several States from Massachusetts-Bay to Pennsylva∣nia inclusive, I take the liberty to inclose.</P>
<P>The resolution prohibiting officers, except such as are specially authorised, to keep horses in the army or within forty miles of it, has been published in orders, and I will take every step in my power to give it effect.</P>
<P>I have considered the practicability of reducing the teams employed in the army, and find, however desirable the object may be, that it cannot be done. We have not at this time more than are absolutely and indispensably nec∣essary, nor so many as would be necessary in case of a rap∣id movement: neither does it appear to me that there can be a substitution of ox for horse teams, at least to any great extent; nor that any material advantages would arise from such a measure. There might perhaps be a small saving in the article of provender: but this, I fear, would be greatly over-balanced in the loss of cattle that would be appropri∣ated to the use of the commissary's department. After a full investigation of the subject, I believe we shall be obliged to adhere to the kind of teams we now employ, and that the only relief we shall have in point of expense will arise from sending a part of the horses to places where they may be more easily foraged, when we have fixed our camp and quarters for the winter.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congress that there is a ne∣cessity of some mode's being established, by which claims on the old quarter-mastership, that remain unsatisfied, may be discharged. There are many of this nature; and these, however well authenticated they may be, the gentlemen now in office do not conceive themselves at liberty to ad∣just,
<PB N="308" REF="029737_0646_0FE29D4CCCAAB0E8"/>
without obtaining some special direction for the purpose. I am every day applied to for payment of such accounts, and, in many instances, have been obliged, as well for the sake of justice to individuals as for the public good, to or∣der them to be taken up. It appears to me that Congress cannot be too early in their resolution upon this occasion, and that either the present department should be authorised to settle and pay such claims, or that some persons should be appointed and supplied with money for the purpose.</P>
<P>The army marched from White-Plains on the sixteenth instant, and is now encamped in different places. Three brigades, composing the Virginia troops, part of the right wing, under the command of general Putnam, are at Rob∣inson's near West-Point: and two brigades more, com∣posing the remainder, are with baron De Kalb at Fishkill plains, about ten miles from the town, on the road leading to Sharon. The second line, with lord Stirling, is in the vicinity of Fredericsburg; and the whole of the left wing at Danbury under the command of general Gates. These several posts appear to be the best we can occupy in the pres∣ent doubtful state of things, as they have relation to the support of West-Point in case of an attack in that quarter, and are also on the communication to the eastward, if the enemy point their operations that way. Besides these dis∣positions, general Scott with a light corps remains below in the country about King's-Street.</P>
<P>The letter from Sir Henry Clinton which I have the honour of transmitting was sent to me to-day by colonel Baylor who is posted at Hackinsac. He says he received one for me by the same flag; and, from his note, he sup∣posed he had charged the horseman with it who just arriv∣ed at Head-Quarters. Through accident he forwarded yours to me; and I think it probable that you will be troubled with mine. If this should be the case, you will be so obliging as to return it to me by the first conveyance. I was also informed by colonel Baylor, that a considerable body of the enemy landed at Paulus' Hook in the evening of the twenty-second, and were encamped that night in the woods between four and five miles from the town of Ber∣gen. He had not learned their object: but it is likely they are after forage.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following is an extract of a letter of the sev∣enteenth instant, which I had the honour to receive from the count D'Estaing.</P>
<P>"I entreat you to promote the exchange of prisoners already planned by monsieur Girard. The unhappy per∣sons taken before the commencement of hostilities cannot be fully regarded as prisoners: their lot is dreadful. The mode adopted for exchanging them by means of your com∣missary, without introducing the king's name or mine into the transaction, removes a great part of the political diffi∣culties which before subsisted."</P>
<P>I am an entire stranger to the plan above referred to, or to the mode that has been adopted for exchanging by means of our commissary. He is absent from the army: and I must therefore beg the favour of you to obtain from monsieur Girard such information as will enable me to give directions for carrying the count's desires into execution, if practicable.</P>
<P>The marquis De Vienne, at present at Boston, has re∣quested a furlough of eighteen months to enable him to return to France, whither he is called by some domestic concerns. I do not conceive myself at liberty to grant his request without the permission of Congress, to whom I would beg leave to observe, that, if agreeable to them, he may be indulged without prejudice to the service, as he is not attached to any particular command.</P>
<P>I have just received an account from Jersey, which I fear is too true, that colonel Baylor's regiment of dragoons were surprised in their quarters the night before last, and most of them killed or taken. A few of the stragglers have come in, who can give but a very imperfect account of the matter. They think the colonel and most of the officers were made prisoners, and that the privates were put to the sword. There were, I imagine, about one hundred men of the regiment together when this unlucky accident happened.</P>
<P>The stay of the enemy in Jersey being longer than I apprehended, and not knowing what their real intentions
<PB N="310" REF="029737_0648_0FE29D4E5154A158"/>
may be, I have ordered general Maxwell to advance from Elizabethtown to the neighbourhood of Acquakenunk bridge, and have sent over general Woodford's brigade from this side of the river. I have also ordered general Pulaski to advance with as much expedition as possible, and join the brigades. Lord Stirling has this day gone over to take the command of the continental forces and militia who are assembling in considerable numbers. If the enemy mean only to forage, they will be kept from ex∣tending themselves by these troops: and if they have any designs upon the posts in the Highlands, they will be pre∣vented from seizing the passes leading to the forts, by lord Stirling, who will be between them and the enemy, and always ready to posses them.</P>
<P>I have made proper dispositions on this side the river for the security of the Highlands, in case that body of the enemy, who are on this side Kingsbridge employed in col∣lecting forage, should advance.</P>
<P>The sketch of Rhode-Island, forwarded by this express, was received from general Sullivan, and left behind by accident when the last dispatches were sent off.</P>
<P>I have had the honour of receiving yours of the twen∣tieth, inclosing an order for count Pulaski's legion to ad∣vance to Trenton.</P>

<P>I AM honoured with your favour of the twenty-seventh of September, with the inclosed resolves of Con∣gress, a copy of which has been transmitted to major-general Lincoln for his information and direction.</P>
<P>Being separated from my papers, I am uncertain whether I mentioned in my last, that, the enemy in the Jerseys hav∣ing received a reinforcement and made some forward movements, I had thought it expedient to detach another brigade thither to act in conjunction with the one already there together with Pulaski's corps and the militia, and had sent major-general lord Stirling to take the command of the whole;—that I had also ordered major-general
<PB N="311" REF="029737_0649_0FE29DB7CC28EE28"/>
Putnam across the river for the immediate security of West-Point, and moved a division of troops to this place, to be nearer that post. I have since come here myself, and propose to remain till the views of the enemy on the Jerseys are decided: though I have had no reason to al∣ter my opinion that nothing more than a forage is intend∣ed. By the last accounts, they had drawn in their out-parties, and resumed their first bounds behind Hackin∣sac river, at the liberty-pole and Newbridge.</P>
<P>That part of Baylor's regiment which escaped came off in the first instance, and were afterwards brought off in so dispersed a manner that the number has not been ascer∣tained: but, from what I have learned, I should estimate the loss at about fifty men and seventy horses. Major Clough is dead of his wounds. This affair seems to have been attended with every circumstance of cruelty.</P>
<P>It is a small compensation for this accident, that colonel Butler three or four days ago, with a party of infantry and horse comprehending major Lee's corps, surprised about a hundred Yagers below Tarrytown, killed ten on the spot, and took a lieutenant and eighteen men prisoners. The roughness of the country facilitated the flight of the rest, and prevented the success being more complete.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be delivered to you by major general the marquis De la Fayette. The generous motives, which first induced him to cross the Atlantic and enter the army of the United States, are well known to Congress. Rea∣sons equally laudable now engage his return to France, which in her present circumstances claims his services. His eagerness to offer his duty to his prince and country, however great, could not influence him to quit the conti∣nent in any stage of an unfinished campaign. He resolved
<PB N="312" REF="029737_0650_0FE29D595411E4C8"/>
to remain at least till the close of the present, and embraces this moment of suspense to communicate his wishes to Con∣gress, with a view of having the necessary arrangements made in time, and of being still within reach, should any occasion offer of distinguishing himself in the field.</P>
<P>The marquis at the same time, from a desire of preserv∣ing a relation with us, and a hope of having it yet in his power to be useful as an American officer, solicits only a furlough sufficient for the purposes above-mentioned. A reluctance to part with an officer, who unites to all the military fire of youth an uncommon maturity of judgment, would lead me to prefer his being absent on this footing, if it depended on me. I shall always be happy to give such a testimony of his services as his bravery and conduct on all occasions entitle him to; and I have no doubt that Congress will add suitable expressions of their sense of his merit, and their regret on account of his departure.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE incessant and pressing applications of the offi∣cers, and their real distress for clothing, oblige me to re∣peat my wishes to the board, to obtain the earliest direction of Congress for relieving their wants. They are in a very disagreeable situation in this respect; and, unless some mode can be adopted for speedily supplying them, many will be obliged involuntarily to quit the service; or, if this should not be the case, we shall be involved in perpetual complaints, and the most painful applications.</P>
<P>I do not recollect, when the army was first appointed, that there was any engagement on the part of the public that the officers should be provided with clothing through their means; nor has there been any explicit declaration
<PB N="313" REF="029737_0651_0FE29DB95269F958"/>
since, that I remember, for the purpose: but the measure has become indispensably necessary; and, without the in∣tervention of public aid, they never can be supplied: for their pay, if the articles proper could be found in a private way, (from the enormous and exorbitant prices now ex∣acted for every thing) would prove wholly incompetent to the end.</P>
<P>There is however a resolution of Congress, of the twen∣ty-second of November last, which points to a provision through the public means and those of the States individ∣ually taken. This has encouraged the officers to look for supplies in the manner there professed; and their not being able to obtain them makes them more uneasy perhaps than if the resolution had never passed.</P>
<P>I have written to messieurs Otis and Andrews to make a return of the cloth, &amp;c. in their hands, proper for offi∣cers, and also to advise me what quantities might be pro∣cured in case the board should direct a purchase. This appears to be the only practicable expedient at this time, from which relief can be drawn: and, if it is to be adopt∣ed, the agents cannot be too soon ordered to carry it into execution. I really wish to be informed by the board by the first opportunity whether the officers may expect sup∣plies through the public stores, that I may be able to an∣swer them decisively upon the point when they apply. As matters now stand, I am in a very awkward and irksome situation.</P>
<P>Since it is evident that the officers cannot provide them∣selves with clothing, and that there is a necessity for the intervention of the public aid, I would submit it to the board whether it may not be proper for them to form an estimate of clothing, proportioned to the number of officers in the army, for the consideration of Congress, and to ob∣tain their sanction for importing the same, if they approve the plan. This measure, it seems to me, is the only one that can insure relief in future; and it appears the more eligible as the loss to the public will be infinitely less than if they procure the articles in the country, supposing that it could be done. Besides this consideration, the officers then might be properly uniformed and all placed on a just and equal footing.</P>

If the board should be authorised to direct an immedi∣ate purchase of clothing for the officers, I will take the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erty to suggest that it may not be improper for them to enjoin on the part of the clothier a strict compliance with the resolution of Congress which I have mentioned, in the sale. The officers say that hitherto it has not had the necessary and generous operation intended by Congress; but, on the contrary, in the few instances in which they have been able to furnish themselves with articles from the public stores, that they have done it at the current exorbi∣tant prices. Indeed, there are many matters in the de∣partment which require a more perfect and explicit arrange∣ment than has ever been made: and at present there is such a clashing of offices and officers that it is difficult to determine how or with whom business is to be transacted.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the sixth instant by favour of the marquis De la Fayette, I re∣ceived your letter of the second with its inclosure.</P>
<P>I do myself the honour of transmitting you an account of the engagement between the French and British fleets on the twenty-seventh of July, as published by the British admiralty-board. I received a printed copy of it last night from New-York, which I have forwarded to his excellen∣cy count D'Estaing. It is evident from admiral Keppel's own relation of the affair, that he was pretty severely han∣dled, notwithanding he affects in the conclusion to mention that he wished extremely for an opportunity to renew the combat the next day.</P>
<P>We are still in great suspense as to the operations and designs of the enemy, though every practicable measure has been used and is pursuing, to come at them. By late and direct accounts it would seem that some troops at least are going from New-York. A few days, I think, must open their conduct decisively.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="029737_0653_0FE29DBAD64C38B0"/>
I have had the misfortune to hear that the Raleigh frigate has become a prize to two British ships of war after a long and very gallant resistance. Captain Barry, finding that the frigate would fall into the enemy's hands, ran her ashore on Seal-Island, to which he escaped in boats with about eighty of his hands, and from thence to the main. It is said he took measures for blowing her up, but was defeated in his purpose by the perfidy of an under officer who concealed himself and remained on board.</P>

<P>I AM honoured with yours of the ninth, inclosing the resolves to extend the embargo, and to prevent fore∣stalling provisions. I hope the latter will have the desired effect: for, unless that most infamous practice of raising the prices of the necessaries of life can be stopped, it will be impossible for any funds to subsist the army.</P>
<P>Inclosed you have the copy of a petition from the ref∣ugees in New-York to the commissioners. You may depend upon the authenticity of it, as it is taken from a New-York paper. It should seem by this that they are extremely so∣licitous and anxious to know whether New-York is to be garrisoned, which implies a suspicion on their part that it is to be evacuated. All accounts, since mine of the four∣teenth, confirm the report of a very considerable embarka∣tion. It is said to consist of ten British regiments com∣pleted to their full establishment, and their grenadier and light companies added to them. This will make them amount to upwards of five thousand men. They have not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed.</P>
<P>I cannot say that I am satisfied that a total evacuation of the city is intended this winter, although many inhabit∣ants near the lines, and several out of the city, are of that opinion. I have set every engine at work to procure full intelligence of their designs; and I hope to succeed. The current opinion of deserters and others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the present embarkation is intended for the West-Indies: some few have said that they have a design upon Charleston.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE letter which I had the honour of addressing to you the day before yesterday would inform Congress of the embarkation and sailing of a considerable detachment of the enemy from New-York, and of the measures I had taken in expectation of and upon the happening of the event. Whether this will be succeeded by a further em∣barkation, or by a total evacuation of the posts which they hold within the States, in the course of this year or the ensuing one, I cannot pretend to determine. But, as it will be right and prudent in us to provide for every con∣tingency, I would with the greatest deference submit it to Congress whether it may not be proper for them to call upon the States to provide men in time for filling their respective battalions, before or at any rate against the open∣ing of the spring, and in the same manner as if there was a moral certainty that the war would be prosecuted with all possible vigour on the part of Britain. Should this not be the case, or should any events cast up in the mean time to render troops unnecessary, it will be easy to disband the levies and to keep them from the field,—while, on the other hand, our relaxation in not providing them may sub∣ject us at least to many disagreeable consequences.</P>
<P>The general return of the infantry in the month of Sep∣tember, transmitted to the board of war by the adjutant-general, and to which I beg leave to refer, will shew Congress the whole amount of our reputed force at that time. But I am to observe, that large, very large deduc∣tions are to be made from it on account of the columns of sick, and the men said to be on command. Many under the former description, particularly that of sick absent, are actually dead; others, unfit for service; and several, who have recovered, have deserted: nor will the latter afford more than one half of its number in time of action, as various duties, such as waggoning, distant guards, escorts, &amp;c. em∣ploy a great proportion of those under this denomination.</P>
<P>Besides the above deductions, Congress will perceive from the returns which I now take the liberty of transmit∣ting, that there are four thousand three hundred and eighty draughts and others, whose terms of service will expire
<PB N="317" REF="029737_0655_0FE29DBC589C1838"/>
during and by the close of winter: for I am sorry to add that our exertions to re-engage the draughts and old sold∣iers in this predicament, for the usual bounty, have proved so far ineffectual and without success. I have not tried what effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> additional grant of ten dollars might have: but I fear, and it seems to be the opinion of all I have con∣sulted upon the occasion, that it would have but little if any influence. I know, in the case of the draughts and troops of one State, that the offer of twenty dollars on the part of the continent, with a like allowance and an actual deposit of it by the State, has been no temptation.</P>
<P>This general reluctance and refusal is founded in the unhappy depreciated light in which the soldiery view the money, and their expectation of receiving immense State, district, and substitute bounties. Whether grants or boun∣ties by Congress, bearing some proportion to these, to such as should enlist for the war, would be attended with better success, I cannot undertake to decide. The experiment may be made if they judge it proper: and if it proves an inducement of any extent, it will be an infinite saving in the end. I believe however our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urest and only certain aids will be derived from draughting, which I trust may and will be done by the States on the recommendation of Congress, agreeable to the mode mentioned in my letter to their committee when they first honoured me with a visit at Valley-Forge. The exertions to recruit by voluntary enlistments may still go on, as both modes in all probabil∣ity will not produce near as many men as may be found necessary.</P>
<P>In the case of the Carolina troops whose service is end∣ing every day, the officers say that nothing will induce them to enlist, unless they can be permitted to go home on furlough till the spring. On this indulgence they seem to think several might be engaged. The distance is great, and there will be some uncertainty as to their returning: besides, it will be fixing a precedent for others. If Con∣gress approve the plan, they will be pleased to inform me by the earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>I am under some difficulty about clothing the draughts, and the old soldiers whose service is expiring and will de∣termine every day. As Congress have never expressed
<PB N="318" REF="029737_0656_0FE29D5E080A70F0"/>
their sense upon the subject, and this is increased by a let∣ter which I received some time ago from the board of war, which respects particularly the draughts, I must earnestly request that Congress will favour me with the speediest direction in the case, whether they are to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> furnished out of the supplies coming on, equally with the other troops. At the same time I will take the liberty to offer it as my opinion, that, however inconvenient or expensive it may appear at the first view to clothe them, the measure will be necessary, and founded not only in humanity but sound policy. We have no prospect now of levying men in any other way: and if they are not clothed, they will be ex∣hausted by sickness and by death; and not doing it may prove an insurmountable bar or at least a great obstacle to our obtaining future aids, though the exigencies of our af∣fairs should be never so pressing. Yet the clothes may be withheld as long as circumstances will permit, as an in∣ducement for them to enlist. In the instance of the old soldiers who have not received the annual allowance of Congress, the point seems clearly in their favour. The board suggested that the draughts might be supplied out of the best of the old clothes which might be given in by the troops on receiving new ones: but unfortunately there will be few of any worth.</P>

<P>I HAD the honour of your letter of the twenty-second instant, with its several inclosures, to-day at noon. I shall pay a proper regard to the act of Congress respect∣ing monsieur De Vrigney. For information on the second resolve for obtaining a return of the re-enlistments, I must beg leave to refer Congress to my letter of the twenty-fourth. I have complied with the intention of the third, and transmitted the act to Sir Henry Clinton, which re∣lates to Mr. Franks.</P>
<P>The certain intelligence of a large number of troops having embarked at New-York,—the sailing of a consider∣able fleet concurring at the moment their departure was
<PB N="319" REF="029737_0657_0FE29DC8AAE118B8"/>
expected,—left me no room to doubt that the fleet which went out of the Hook on the nineteenth and early the twentieth instant contained the embarkation of which I had been advised. In the persuasion of this, my letter of the twenty-second to your excellency was written: but, from more recent advices, and through various channels, bearing every mark of authenticity, I am to conclude the supposition has been ill founded. The above-mentioned fleet appears to have carried away no other troops than in∣valids, the officers of the corps lately reduced, with some refugees. The twenty-third instant the troops which had embarked still remained in the harbour. They are fixed at ten or twelve British regiments, and six of the new levies. This fleet was probably composed of homeward-bound victuallers, with some merchantmen and other ves∣sels, which chose to take the protection of a convoy. The accounts still say that they were accompanied by fourteen or fifteen sail of the line and some frigates.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 27. In my letter of the twenty-second I ad∣vised your excellency of the measures I had taken to as∣certain the practicability of an enterprise against Chemung. I have the honour to inclose the report of governor Clin∣ton, general Schuyler, and general Hand, on the subject. I cannot help concurring with these gentlemen in opinion, and am persuaded from a number of considerations, that we must lay aside all thoughts of an expedition against that place for the present. Besides other necessary preparations, we have not yet been able to get forward the clothing for the army. The Congress will also perceive in lieutenant-colonel Butler's journal, transmitted to your excellency in my letter of the twenty-second instant, the great difficulties he had to encounter in crossing the rivers at a much earlier season of the year.</P>

I will direct the best and cheapest dis∣position I can to be made of the cavalry for their accom∣modation in quarters, and will instruct the forage-master on the occasion.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honoured with yours of the nineteenth, twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth ultimo.</P>
<P>A tolerable supply of shoes has lately arrived to the issu∣ing clothier's store from the eastward, Pennsylvania, and Jersey: and, if the different persons employed in procuring that article will exert themselves to keep up the supply, I hope we shall not be much distressed during the winter, provided we remain quietly in quarters.</P>
<P>It is much to be wished that Congress would come to a speedy resolution concerning the procuring clothing for the officers at a price in proportion to their pay, more especial∣ly as they were led to expect this from a resolve which passed in November, 1777. If the clothing itself cannot be conveniently procured, I imagine the alternative of al∣lowing an adequate sum of money in lieu thereof would be the next best expedient.</P>
<P>As the board must undoubtedly have experienced the many difficulties arising from the want of a proper arrange∣ment of the clothier's department, I hope they will press the committee who have that business in charge, to bring in their report, that the new system may be carried into execution without loss of time. Whether it has been ow∣ing to want of conduct in the late officer, or his want of proper powers and directions, I will not undertake to de∣termine: but the irregularity in that department has been
<PB N="322" REF="029737_0660_0FE29D6A53E17A40"/>
an endless source of trouble to me, and a great cause of dis∣content in the army.</P>
<P>I have given the issuing clothier directions to keep an ac∣count of the marks and numbers of the bales of blankets, and of the quality of their contents, from whence you will be able to trace from whom those small ones were purchased. When the issues are completed, you shall have the account. The directions to Mr. Mease were very proper. If any corps want completing in any particular article which is not to be procured here, I will sign the order myself.</P>
<P>In the present scarcity of hats, the caps of which you have forwarded a pattern must be used by way of substitute. But an officer very attentive to the health of his men in∣forms me that he found an inconvenience from the use of woollen caps last winter instead of hats: when the men put them off in the spring, they many of them took violent colds from the sudden transition. They also contribute to keep the head dirty, than which nothing is more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>healthy.</P>
<P>I find it impracticable to carry the recommendation of the board, respecting calling in the old clothes upon deliv∣ery of the new, into execution. The soldiers were not to be convinced of the good policy and economy intended by the application of the old clothes to hospitals and the fol∣lowers of the army, but looked upon it as an unjustifiable attempt to deprive them of what they had earned by their year's service, and what (considering the scanty supply of some kinds of covering, blankets in particular) would help to make them more comfortable during the winter. These discontents were communicated to me, the moment they arose, by some of the best officers in the line: which de∣termined me to let the matter drop, more especially as another argument was made use of, which was unanswera∣ble: this was, that, upon a fair settlement, there would be found a considerable deficiency of the bounty-clothing for a year or two past, and that therefore it would be more equitable to make up the deficiency than to draw in the remains.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Wednesday afternoon I received a letter from the honourable Mr. Lee and Mr. Lovell of the committee for foreign affairs, inclosing a plan and sundry resolutions of Congress for attacking Canada the next campaign in conjunction with the forces of his most Christian majesty, and requesting my observations upon the same to be trans∣mitted to Congress, and a copy to be delivered to the mar∣quis De la Fayette. These dispatches, through the indis∣position of the marquis (who unfortunately was seized with a fever in his journey from Philadelphia, which still de∣tains him at Fishkill) were prevented coming to hand till that time: and the great importance and extent of the subject they comprehend would not permit me the honour of an earlier communication of my sentiments. I hope Con∣gress will excuse my not complying with that part of the resolution which requires me to deliver a copy of my ob∣servations to the marquis, as the manner in which I am obliged to treat the subject opens such a prospect of our wants and our weaknesses, as, in point of policy, ought on∣ly to be known to ourselves.</P>
<P>I am always happy to concur in sentiment with Congress; and I view the emancipation of Canada as an object very interesting to the future prosperity and tranquillity of these States: but I am sorry to say the plan proposed for the purpose does not appear to me to be eligible under our pres∣ent circumstances. I consider it as my duty, and what Congress expects from me, to give my reasons for this opin∣ion with that frankness and candour which the importance of the subject demands; and, in doing this, I am persuaded I shall nor fail to meet with their approbation.</P>
<P>It seems to me impolitic to enter into engagements with the court of France for carrying on a combined operation of any kind without a moral certainty of being able to ful∣fil our parts, particularly if the first proposal came from us. If we should not be able to perform them, it would argue either a want of consideration, a defective knowledge of our resources, or something worse than either, which could not fail to produce a degree of distrust and discontent that might be very injurious to the Union. In the present in∣stance,
<PB N="324" REF="029737_0662_0FE29D6BD79A6B60"/>
should the scheme proposed be adopted, a failure on our part would certainly occasion in them a misapplication of a considerable land and naval force which might be use∣fully employed elsewhere, and probably their total loss. It is true, if we were at this time to enter into the engagement, we should be every day better able to judge whether it will be in our power to accomplish what may be expected from us: and, if we should find hereafter that our resources will be unequal to the undertaking, we may give notice to the court of France in season to prevent the sailing of the troops and the ill effects which might attend it. But besides that a project of this kind could not be embraced by France without its having an influence on the whole system of oper∣ations for the next campaign, which of course would re∣ceive some derangement from its being abandoned, a re∣nunciation of this could not fail to give a very unfavoura∣ble impression of our foresight and providence, and would serve to weaken the confidence of that court in our public councils.</P>
<P>So far from there being a moral certainty of our com∣plying with our engagements, it may in my opinion be very safely pronounced, that, if the enemy keep possession of their present posts at New-York and Rhode-Island, it will be impracticable either to furnish the men or the other neces∣sary supplies for prosecuting the plan. They will not at∣tempt to keep those posts with less than ten thousand men and a considerable navy. If it should be thought best for the advantage of carrying on the expeditions intended, to forego any offensive operations against these garrisons, and to leave them in quiet possession of such important places, we shall at least be obliged to provide for the security of the country against their incursions and depredations, by keeping up a force sufficient to confine them within their own limits. It is natural too to suppose, that the people's expectations of being protected will grow stronger in pro∣portion to the diminution of the enemy's force, and the greater facility with which it can be afforded. They will hardly be content to continue in a state of alarm and insecurity from a force so inconsiderable, while the principal strength of the States is drawn out in the prosecution of remote objects. If this reasoning is just, we shall be oblig∣ed
<PB N="325" REF="029737_0663_0FE29DCD6BAB2F18"/>
to have a larger force than the enemy, posted in differ∣ent places to prevent sudden inroads which they would oth∣erwise be able to make at different points: and the num∣ber required cannot be estimated at less than twelve or fif∣teen thousand men. This will be two-thirds as large a force as we have been able to raise and maintain during the progress of the war, as these calculations both of the ene∣my's strength and of our own are meant to designate the number of effective rank and file.</P>
<P>If I rightly understand the plan in consideration, it re∣quires for its execution twelve thousand six hundred men rank and file. Besides these, to open passages through a wilderness, for the march of the several bodies of troops, to provide the means of long and difficult transportations by land and water, to establish posts of communication for the security of our conveys, to build and man vessels of force necessary for acquiring a superiority on the lakes,—these and many other purposes peculiar to these enterprises, which would be tedious in detail, will demand a much larger pro∣portion of artificers and persons to be employed in man∣ual and laborious offices, than are usual in the ordinary course of military operations. When we add the whole together, the aggregate number of men requisite for the service of the ensuing campaign will be little less than dou∣ble the number heretofore in the field: but, to be more certain in the calculation, it may be placed at only one half more.</P>
<P>Experience is the only rule to judge by in the present case. Every expedient has been exhausted in the preced∣ing campaigns to raise men; and it was found impossible to get together a greater force than we had, though the safety and success of the cause seemed absolutely to require it. The natural and direct inference therefore is, that the re∣sources of the country were inadequate to a larger supply. I cannot then see that we can hope upon any principle to be equal to so much greater exertions next year, when the people and the army appear to grow daily more tired of the war, and the depreciation of our money continually increas∣ing, and of consequence proving a smaller temptation to in∣duce them to engage.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="029737_0664_0FE29D6D5D365520"/>
The state of our supplies for transporting and subsisting the troops will stand upon a footing equally bad. We have encountered extreme difficulties in these respects, and have found that it was full as much as we were competent to, to feed the army we have already had, and enable it to keep the field and perform the movements required by the con∣tingencies of the service. It is not likely that these diffi∣culties will diminish; but on the contrary they will rather multiply as the value of our currency lessens: and the enor∣mous prices to which provisions have risen, and the artifi∣cial scarcity created by monopolies, with what we have to fear from the effect of the same spirit, give us no reason to flatter ourselves that our future prospects can be much better.</P>
<P>In this situation of things we are hardly warranted to ex∣pect that we shall have it in our power to satisfy the de∣mands of numbers so much greater than we have yet had to supply, especially if we consider that the scene of our operations has hitherto been in the heart of the country furnishing our resources, which of course facilitated the drawing them out,—and that we shall then be carrying on the war at an immense distance, in a country wild and un∣cultivated, incapable of affording any aid, and great part of it hostile. We cannot in this case depend on temporary or occasional supplies as we have been accustomed, but must have ample magazines laid up beforehand. The labour and expense in forming these, and transporting the necessa∣ry stores of every kind for the use of the troops, will be in∣creased to a degree that can be more easily conceived than described. The transportation must be, a great part of the way, through deserts affording no other forage than herb∣age: and, from this circumstance, our principal subsistence of the flesh kind must be salted, which would not only be an additional expense in the additional consumption of so scarce and dear an article as salt, but would greatly increase the difficulty both of providing and transporting. My let∣ter of the twenty-ninth ultimo (transmitting a copy of one from the quarter-master-general) which I had the honour of addressing to Congress, and to which I wish to refer, will point out the difficulties and daily expense attending our supplies of the article of flour only, in our present cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="327" REF="029737_0665_0FE29DD6838C8220"/>
exclusive of its cost,—and lay the foundation for a sort of comparative estimate to be formed of those that would attend the support of the troops when employed at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o great a distance.</P>
<P>If, in addition to all this, we should have the French fleet to supply during the winter,—the likelihood of which I have no sufficient information to ground a judgment up∣on,—it will appear still more impracticable to furnish the supplies requisite for the extensive operations proposed. But, independent of this, the improbability of doing it is, in my apprehension, infinitely too great to justify the un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>This reasoning is founded on a supposition that the ene∣my do not evacuate their present posts at New-York and Rhode-Island: nor can we presume upon any past appear∣ances so far as to determine the contrary, and enter into a national contract, the fulfilment of which at any rate, in my judgment, will depend on this event. Opinions on the subject are various, and the arguments on both sides cogent. Circumstances have hitherto been very indecisive: at Rhode-Island there is nothing that looks like an evacua∣tion, that I have heard of:—at New-York, the length of time elapsed since the event has been expected, which can∣not be satisfactorily accounted for, makes it not a little doubtful and problematical.</P>
<P>But if it were even certain that the enemy would short∣ly leave these States, I should think our ability to carry on the expeditions meditated (from the nature of the country, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remoteness from the source of our supplies, joined to the discouraging state of our finances) too precarious to authorize a pre-concerted agreement with a foreign power, binding ourselves to the attempt. On the other hand, if we were certain of our doing our part, a co-operation by the French would, in my opinion, be as delicate and pre∣carious an enterprise as can be imagined. All the reasons, which induce France and the United States to wish to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Canada and Halifax from the dominion of England, operate with her perhaps more forcibly to use every possible effort for their defence. The loss of them would be a deadly blow to her trade and empire. To hope to find them in a defenceless state, must be founded in a supposition of the total
<PB N="328" REF="029737_0666_0FE29D789530D9B8"/>
incapacity of Britain both by land and sea to ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord them protection. I should apprehend we may run into a dan∣gerous error by estimating her power so low.</P>
<P>We have been informed that a strong garrison has been lately sent to Halifax, amounting, by report, to about four thousand men:—a part of the detachments which the ene∣my are now making from New-York are currently said to be, and in all probability are, destined for that place:—if they evacuate entirely, a very considerable part of their force will no doubt go there; and in any case we may expect that reinforcements will be thrown from thence into Cana∣da early in the spring. The English are now greatly supe∣rior to the French by sea in America, and will from every appearance continue so unless Spain interpose,—an event which I do not know we are authorized to count upon. However, as I am destitute of information with respect to the present state of European politics, this is a point upon which I can form but an imperfect judgment: but if it should not take place, I think it infinitely probable, from the maritime situation and advantages of Halifax which is represented as the finest port and best naval arsenal in America,—from the security it is calculated to give to the general trade and possessions of Britain, both on the conti∣nent and in the West-Indies,—that it will be a station for a larger naval force than the one intended to convoy me French troops:—it will naturally be the principal rendez∣vous of the British ships of war in America. If this posi∣tion be admitted,—should the English have any knowledge or even suspicion of the design of the French court to send a fleet up the river St. Laurence, nothing will be easier than to intercept this fleet on its way, or to take or destroy it after it has got in. Nor can we flatter ourselves with keeping this business a secret. Congress perhaps will be surprised to be told that it is already in more hands than they suspect: and, in the progress of the negociation in France, it will get into many more. The preparations will announce the intention. It is indeed a part of the plan to avow the destination of the French troops, though this is to be contradicted by the manner of their clothing, &amp;c. The stationing of troops this winter, as is proposed, particu∣larly on the Mohawk and Connecticut river, would be une∣quivocal
<PB N="329" REF="029737_0667_0FE29DD98720C888"/>
proofs of the design: it must at least excite the strongest suspicion, so as to put the English nation upon their guard, and make them take precautions to counter∣act it.</P>
<P>But if the French troops should arrive before Quebec, I think their success against that strong place, fortified by every advantage of nature and of art, would be extremely doubtful. It is suppos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this capital post will be found in so weak a condition as to make its surrender a matter of course, owing to the enemy's having previously drained themselves for the defence of Detroit, Niagara, St. John's, Montréal, &amp;c. but we cannot depend that this will be the case:—they may esteem it the part of prudence rather to sacrifice or at least to hazard the extremities in order to collect their strength at the heart. Montréal in∣deed, and the posts essential to it, must be defended, be∣cause the possession of them would throw too large a part of the country into our hands. But if reinforcements are sent to Canada early in the spring,—a circumstance ex∣tremely likely,—these may be attended to without too far weakening the garrison of Quebec; and, as before observ∣ed, we cannot build upon their conduct's being regulated by an ignorance of our plans. The French troops, instead of a coup-de-main, would in this case be reduced to the necessity of carrying on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blockade.</P>
<P>I will now take the liberty to turn my attention towards the operations of our own troops. The one against De∣troit I shall at present say nothing about: if well conduct∣ed. I should hope that place would fall without very great difficulty. The case is very different with respect to Nia∣gara. This, I am informed, is one of the strongest for∣tresses in America, and can only be reduced by regular approaches or by famine. In accomplishing this, last war, and a conquest as far as Montrèal, I believe general Am∣herst exhausted two campaigns, with all the advantages which he derived from the united efforts of Britain and America, with every convenience for water-transportation, including plenty of seamen, and with money that com∣manded every thing which either country could furnish. The former mode would require great perseverance, time, and labour, and an apparatus which it would be almost im∣practicable
<PB N="330" REF="029737_0668_0FE29D7A17897F58"/>
to transport. The latter is practicable, but very difficult. To effect it, we must gain a superiority on the lakes. The enemy have already a respectable force there:—if they suspect our design, which they cannot fail to do from the measures to be taken, they may improve the interval in adding to it; and, by providing materials and artificers upon the spot, they may be able to increase it so as to keep pace with us. It is therefore easy to see that we ought not to be too sanguine in the success of this ex∣pedition, and that, if a moderate force be employed in the defence of Niagara without degarnishing Quebec and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>termediate posts, its reduction will be a very arduous task.</P>
<P>The body of troops to penetrate by way of the river St. Franci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must meet with great obstacles: they will have a march of about a hundred and fifty miles from Cohoss, which is about a hundred and sixty miles beyond Hartford, a great part of which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> through a hitherto-un∣inhabited and trackless country, with an immense train of waggons: all the stores and provisions for the whole march, and the future supply of the troops, at least till they should get footing in Canada, must accompany them from the beginning. The impediments and delays in such a march almost exceed conception.</P>
<P>When arrived at the St. Laurence, fresh obstacles probably would present themselves. The presumption is, that, if the enemy could not make head there, they would desol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the country through which they were to pass, de∣stroy all the provision and forage, remove every kind of water craft, and demolish the materials for building others. These precautions being taken on the Sorelle and St. Laurence would pretty effectually obstruct our progress both to Montréal and Cadoroqui,—to say nothing of the rapidity of the current and the numerous rifts between Montreal and Legalette.</P>
<P>When we deliberately consider all the obstacles in the execution, and the difficulties we shall find in preparing the vast magazines required, which have been already enumerated, if within the compass of our resources, we shall be led to think it not very improbable that this body may be unable to penetrate Canada, at least in time to co∣operate
<PB N="331" REF="029737_0669_0FE29DDB0B02B5D8"/>
operate with the French troops, if a co-operation should be necessary. The situation of these troops then would be delicate and dangerous:—exposed to a defeat from the united force of the enemy, in great danger of having their retreat cut off by a superior naval force in the river, they would have every thing to fear. On the other hand, if our operations should be as successful as we may flatter ourselves, a tempest or a British fleet may deprive us of the expected aid; and at a critical moment we may find ourselves in the bosom of an enemy's country, obliged to combat their whole force with one inferior and reduced by a tedious and wasting march. The five thousand men, when they arrived in Canada, would probably little exceed four capable of service; and would be still less, if out of them we should establish posts as we advanced, to insure a retreat and protect escorts of provision which must follow for future support. Thus an accident in either case would involve the defeat of the whole project; and the catastro∣phe might be attended with the most unhappy consequences to America.</P>
<P>The plan proposed appears to me not only too extensive and beyond our abilities, but too complex. To succeed, it requires such a fortunate coincidence of circumstances as could hardly be hoped, and cannot be relied on;—the departure of the enemy from these States, without which we cannot furnish the stipulated force, or supplies to main∣tain them,—such a want of power or want of foresight in the enemy as will oblige them to neglect the reinforcement of Halifax and of Canada, and prevent them, however con∣veniently situated, from disputing the passage of the four ships of the line and four frigates up the river St. Lau∣rence, or attempting their destruction afterwards,—such a combination of favourable incidents as will enable several bodies acting separately and independently by sea and land, and from different countries, to conform to times and pe∣riods so as to insure a co-operation;—these and many other circumstances must conspire, to give success to the enterprise.</P>
<P>Congress, I am persuaded, had powerful reasons for fix∣ing the convoy at the number they have: and their supe∣rior information respecting the affairs of Europe at this
<PB N="332" REF="029737_0670_0FE29D7B9C27EA90"/>
juncture enables them to judge much better than I can pretend to do, of its sufficiency. But, from the imperfect view I have of the matter, I have been led, in considering the subject, to look upon it as insufficient. From the gen∣eral tenor of intelligence, the English out-number the French in the channel: in America, both on the conti∣nent and in the islands, they are greatly superior. If the the last Toulon fleet is employed in the Mediterranean, the French may have the superiority there: but, upon the whole, the balance of naval force seems hitherto to be on the side of the English. If we add to this that the number of ships of war in the French ports, built or building, bears no comparison to the number in the English ports, and that Britain, notwithstanding the diminution she has suffered, is still a kingdom of great maritime resources,—we shall be disposed to conclude that the preponderance is too like∣ly to continue where it is. The interposition of Spain in∣deed would make a very interesting change: but her back∣wardness heretofore seems to be an argument that she is withheld from interfering by some weighty political mo∣tives: and how long these may continue to restrain her, is a question I am unqualified to determine.</P>
<P>Besides these general objections to the plan which have been stated, there appear to me to be some particular ones which I shall take the liberty to point out.</P>
<P>In the first place I observe there are to be five thousand militia employed in the two expeditions against Detroit and Niagara. The drawing into service so large a number composed chiefly of husbandmen, in addition to what may be found necessary for other exigencies on the coast at so interesting a season of the year, will certainly be very inju∣rious to the culture of our lands, and must tend to add to the deficiency of supplies. But this, though not to be overlooked, is not the principal objection. In the expe∣dition against Detroit, militia perhaps may answer, as it is not a post of very great strength, and may possibly be aban∣doned, on or in a little time after the approach of a force that cannot be opposed in the field, and the garrison pro∣ceed to reinforce that of Niagara. But even here troops of another kind would be far preferable. However, the case will be very different with respect to this last:—it is,
<PB N="333" REF="029737_0671_0FE29DDC8EAAAF38"/>
as I have before mentioned, one of the strongest fortresses of America, and demands for its reduction the very best of troops. Militia have neither patience nor perseverance for a siege. This has been demonstrated by all the expe∣rience we have had. An attempt to carry on one which should materially depend on them would be liable to be frustrated by their inconstancy in the most critical moments. Agreeable to the plan under consideration, three thousand five hundred out of five thousand six hundred are to be militia.</P>
<P>It is a part of the plan that the troops sent against De∣troit, whether successful or not, are to form a junction with those at Niagara. It appears to me on the contrary, that the expedition against Detroit, under the present arrange∣ment, must stand on its own bottom, and have no other object than the reducing that place and destroying the ad∣jacent Indian settlements. Lake Erie is certainly occu∣pied by two armed vessels of sixteen and eighteen guns, and, it is said, by five or six others of smaller size, having two, three, or four guns each, which, while the enemy hold Niagara, will prevent the communication of our troops by way of the lake,—to say nothing of the want of bat∣teaux for transportation. A communication by land must be performed through an extent of more than four hundred miles, and a great part of this at least under many disad∣vantages of route, and through tribes of hostile Indians.</P>
<P>My knowledge of the country is not sufficiently accu∣rate to enable me to discover the reasons which determined Congress to divide the force destined against Niagara, and to appoint the march of one body from Ononguaga to that place. It seems to me however that this disposition might be subject to one great inconvenience, which is, that, if each column be not superior to the whole collective force of the enemy, they risk being beaten separately and succes∣sively, besides the trouble and expense of preparing as it were for two expeditions instead of one,—of opening two roads instead of one,—and the uncertainty of a co-opera∣tion (if no disaster should happen to either) at the moment when it might be necessary. The inquiries I have as yet had it in my power to make are opposed to the practicabil∣ity of conveying cannon in the route from Ononguaga to
<PB N="334" REF="029737_0672_0FE29D7D1F475AD0"/>
Niagara, or at least place it as a point infinitely doubtful: and, without cannon, nothing can be effected against that post. Upon the whole, the great matter essential to suc∣cess against Niagara is to subdue the enemy's force on lakes Erie and Ontario, particularly the latter. This once done, and the garrison by that means cut off from its supplies, the fort will be likely to fall an easy prey. Here our ef∣forts should be directed: nor do I at present perceive the purposes to be answered by the body going from Onon∣guaga, unless the devastation of the intermediate Indian villages be the object,—which perhaps may not be equal to the risk, labour and expense, and the more so as they would fall of course if we should succeed in the general operation.</P>
<P>The cantoning five thousand troops this winter or Con∣necticut-river, under our present prospects, will in my opin∣ion be impracticable, and, in any case, unadviseable. When I had the honour of writing to Congress in September last on the subject of a winter campaign into Canada, I had been led by [<HI>colonel</HI>] Bailey, and other gentlemen ac∣quainted with the country, to expect that very considera∣ble magazines of provisions might be laid up on the upper parts of that river. But it appears on experiment that their zeal for the expedition made them too sanguine in the matter. The purchases fall far, very far short of what was expected. The difficulties of transportation, as rep∣resented by the quarter-masters and commissaries, supported by facts that speak for themselves, are so great and com∣plicated that I should have no hope of being able, from remote parts of the continent, to throw in the quantity requisite for subsisting these troops during the winter, and at the same time of forming the magazines which would be necessary to prosecute the expedition in spring. We may be endeavouring to form the magazines: but the troops cannot be on the spot this winter; otherwise they will exhaust the provision as fast as it can be collected. The same objection applies to the stationing of troops on the Mohawk-river.</P>
<P>In estimating our force for the next campaign, it is to be considered that upwards of four thousand of the present army will have completed their term of service by the last
<PB N="335" REF="029737_0673_0FE29DE49C006D30"/>
of May next, and that a great proportion of the remainder will have done the same about the close of the ensuing fall, unless they can be induced to re-engage,—of which the ill success of our present exertions to enlist those whose en∣gagements are about to expire affords but an unfavourable prospect. This and the general temper of the officers, dissatisfied much with their situation, will suggest a strong argument against the extensive projects in contemplation.</P>
<P>In whatever point of light the subject is placed, our abili∣ty to perform our part of the contract appears to me in∣finitely too doubtful and precarious to justify the undertak∣ing. A failure, as I have already observed, would involve consequences too delicate and disagreeable to be hazarded. But, at the same time that my judgment is against this, I am clearly of opinion that we should attempt every thing that our circumstances will permit: but, as the extent of our power must be regulated by many possible events, I would wish to hold ourselves free to act according to either possibility, and as a clearer view of our future resources may authorize. If the enemy entirely leave these States, it will produce a vast change in our affairs; and new pros∣pects may open, of which we can at present have but a very imperfect idea. It would be a great step towards raising the value of our money, which would give a new spring to our military operations. We may be able to un∣dertake much more than we can now foresee.</P>
<P>If the enemy attempt to keep posts in these States, a primary object will be to expel them, if in our power: If not, we must make proper provision to bar their depreda∣tions, and must turn our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tention to the security of our frontiers, by pursuing such measures as shall be within the reach of our abilities. Though we may not be able to launch into so wide a field as we could wish, something upon a more partial scale may be enterprised. Detroit and Niagara may perhaps be reduced, though Canada may not be an accession to the confederacy. With a view to what is possible, preparations may be going on, and we can make such an application of them as we shall find practicable.</P>
<P>As there is no time to be lost in doing this, I shall give the necessary orders so far as relates to the article of pro∣vision,
<PB N="336" REF="029737_0674_0FE29D87F2C75420"/>
which indeed has been already done in part. Mag∣azines of forage, materials for boat and ship building, and other articles, must also be provided,—which will depend on the final arrangements and more definitive instructions of Congress. These measures will be necessary to be tak∣en, whether the present plan is carried on, or whether some∣thing less extensive, depending wholly on ourselves, is sub∣stituted in its place. I shall wait the further orders of Congress for the government of my conduct in delivering the plan to the marquis as their resolution seems to require, or in transmitting it immediately to doctor Franklin as the letter from the committee seems to direct. At present I am under some doubt concerning the intention of Congress in this particular.</P>

<P>BARON De Steuben will have the honour of deliv∣ering you this. He waits upon Congress on the subject of the inspectorship, which he is extremely anxious should be put upon some decided footing. He appears to be sensi∣ble of some difficulties in the plan formerly proposed, and which I had the honour some time since to transmit my ob∣servations upon,—and desirous that they should not prove an obstruction to the progress of an institution, which, if accommodated to the circumstances and sentiments of the army, promises very great advantages to the service. The success the baron had in the beginning, and the benefits derived from it, make me regret the obstacles that have so long suspended his exertions; and I should wish he may have it in his power to resume them on principles most ad∣vancive of the service.

<P>I DO myself the honour to transmit you the copy of a letter of the tenth instant, which I received yesterday from Sir Henry Clinton, on the subject of exchanging the prisoners of the convention. Should the proposition be agreeable to Congress, I shall be glad to receive powers to enter into a negociation as soon as possible, as it may probably relieve our officers upon parole from the disagree∣able necessity of returning to New-York. I will just ob∣serve, that, should an exchange take place upon the terms proposed by Sir Henry, I should suppose we shall not be obliged to give up any considerable number of privates by way of composition, as the officers of the convention (should the whole be suffered to be exchanged) would go a great way towards liberating ours at present in the hands of the enemy. But it cannot be expected that they will leave their troops entirely destitute of officers. Mr. commissary Clark, mentioned by Sir Henry Clinton, was permitted by general Heath to go from Boston to New-York to settle

<P>I HAD the honour to receive your favour of the sixth yesterday, with the inclosed copy of a letter from the pres∣ident of the council of New-Jersey, relative to an expect∣ed attack upon the western frontier of that State. I have just received a letter from general Hand giving intelligence of an attack upon colonel Alden's regiment at Cherry-Valley, effected by surprise, in consequence of which, there is too much reason to apprehend that regiment may fall a sacrifice. I transmit a copy of the dispatches announcing this disagreeable affair.</P>
<P>These depredations of the enemy give me the most seri∣ous concern. I lament that we have not yet had it in our power to give them an effectual check. I am perfectly convinced that the only certain way of preventing Indian ravages is to carry the war vigorously into their own coun∣try. But as this is thought impracticable at this late sea∣son of the year from the state of the water, and other im∣pediments, I fear we must content ourselves with defen∣sive precautions for the present. I have already informed Congress that colonel Cortlandt's regiment had marched towards the Minisinks: but, having since directed count Pulaski to proceed with his corps to Colesfort in that neigh∣bourhood, colonel Cortlandt will take post somewhere be∣tween that place and Rochester. Orders are now given to colonel Spencer's regiment and colonel Armand's corps to join general Pulaski. This disposition is agreeable to the opinion of governor Clinton and other gentlemen ac∣quainted with the country whom I have consulted, and is calculated to cover the eastern frontier of Pennsylvania, New-Jersey, and the western part of New-York. I shall also immediately send the remainder of general Clinton's brigade to Albany. When arrived there, if any thing of∣fensive can possibly be undertaken, it shall be done: if not, they will be disposed of in a manner that shall seem best adapted for protection and defence.

<P>BY the time this reaches you, general Du Portail <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ill probably be at Philadelphia. One part of his business <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to prosecute the directions given him some time since for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rming a plan for the defence of the river Delaware, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e submitted to Congress: another part is to understand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om Congress what may be their views and wishes with respect to his further continuance in America, and that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e three other gentlemen attached to him.</P>
<P>He informs me that the furlough he obtained from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourt of France expires in February next, and that, unless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is a certain prospect of his being employed hereafter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a manner useful to the States and honourable to himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e intends immediately to return. He therefore wishes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome explicit ideas to be realized on the subject. He is also anxious that something definitive should be done with respect to the pay and the other appointments both of him∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf and the other gentlemen with him, which have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itherto undecided, and have left them in an uncertain and disagreeable situation. Added to this, he is desirous to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave some arrangement fixed for the rules and manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervice in his department.</P>
<P>He delivered me, some days since, a memorial intended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Congress, and which I have now the honour to inclose, containing his ideas on a general system of fortification for these States, and which he requested me to accompany with my sentiments. But it includes questions of finance and considerations of policy the most extensive and import∣ant, of which Congress alone can form a competent judg∣ment. I shall therefore only say, that, considered merely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a military point of view, the plan appears to me worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f very serious attention.</P>
<P>It is but justice to general Du Portail to observe that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave a high opinion of his merit and abilities, and esteem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im not only well acquainted with the particular branch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e professes, but a man of sound judgment and real knowl∣edge in military science in general.

<P>COUNT Kolhowski, who will have the honour of delivering you this, is a Polish officer who is desirous of entering into our service. I inclose your excellency two letters in his favour from doctor Franklin and Mr. Deane; added to which, he is recommended to me by count Pu∣laski as a brave and useful officer who served under him in Poland. He wishes him to be placed on his legion, with the rank of captain and the pay of lieutenant,—to perform the duties of the latter till he can give proofs of his talents and obtain some other employ. With very great esteem and respect, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>MR. Wheelock will have the honour of presenting this letter to your excellency. He waits on Congress up∣on the affairs of a regiment under the command of colonel Bedel, which, it seems, was raised in the Cohoss county, or at least has been kept up since March last upon the recommendation of the marquis Fayette when at Albany. This corps, according to the inclosed state by Mr.
<PB N="341" REF="029737_0679_0FE29DEE935C6008"/>
Wheelock who is the lieutenant colonel, to which I beg leave to refer Congress, and according to other information I have received, was at first assembled under the direction of major-general Gates about this time twelvemonth for the purpose of a sudden enterprise against St. John's, and the enemy's armed vessels lying there, and was engaged till the last of March.</P>
<P>I cannot undertake to say in what manner or how use∣fully this regiment has been employed, or to what extent in point of men. But Mr. Wheelock says it has been of great service: and the object of his present journey is to obtain the direction of Congress for their being paid when proper rolls are produced, and their determination whether it is to be disbanded now, or continued till April next, the period for which the men are said to have engaged, though the marquis's recommendation extended only to the end of the present campaign.</P>
<P>The regiment may or may not be necessary in future. Much will depend on the system of conduct the enemy pursue the next campaign, and on our own operations. I would observe, under its present engagement, its services were to be local, or at least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a certain quarter. If it should be deemed expedient to re-enlist it,—if prac∣ticable, it should be done on the general scale of acting wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever it may be requisite: (though perhaps it may not be possible, to accomplish it) and, in such case, it will also be material for the public to have a more perfect knowl∣edge of its arrangements than what I apprehend it has hitherto had.</P>

<P>I HAD the honour of your excellency's two favours of the fourteenth and fifteenth instant, with their several inclosures. The consideration of doctor Conolly's case, with the resolution of Congress, I have transmitted to Sir. Henry Clinton.</P>
<P>In my letter of the sixteenth I communicated to your excellency the attempt on Fort Alden by the savages. I have since received the inclosed dispatches confirming that
<PB N="342" REF="029737_0680_0FE29D8CA51B2158"/>
disagreeable account. I also informed Congress at the same time of the steps which were taken for the security of the frontier of Pennsylvania, New-Jersey, and the west∣ern part of New-York,—and that the two remaining reg∣iments of general Clinton's brigade were ordered to Al∣bany.</P>
<P>I have to regret that the condition of affairs is such as does not admit of a compliance with repeated detachments from this army. However, that every thing possible might be done under our present circumstances, general Hand was further instructed on the sixteenth instant to confer with general Schuyler at Albany, and with those persons in that part of the country who could in any manner assist in forming his judgment on the best measures to be pur∣sued with the troops which were employed in the several quarters: and yesterday I changed his command to that of the Minisinks, and forwarded him an extract from colo∣nel Hartley's letter of the ninth, that he might accommo∣date his dispositions to recent events. I have only to add on this subject, that, on the twentieth, brigadier-general Clinton set out to take the command at Albany, with di∣rections to consult with general Hand, and to form with him such combined arrangements as may appear most con∣sistent with their united strength.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR excellency's letter of the eighteenth, with the inclosure referred to, came to hand yesterday. I had be∣fore received the intelligence contained in Mr. Deane's letter, and in consequence made part of the detachments which have been mentioned in my late letters. It is high∣ly probable that the late incursions and outrages were com∣mitted by the parties comprehended in Mr. Deane's in∣telligence; and I should hope that the force already gone from the army, together with the season, will prevent them at least from making further great depredations.</P>
<P>Since I had the honour of addressing your excellency on the twenty-first, I received a letter from general Hand, of the eighteenth, an extract from which you will find inclos∣ed, with copies of a letter from major Whiting and one from a Mr. Clyde. These will inform Congress, that though the ravages at the Cherry-Valley settlement were great in the late attack by the savages, yet our loss was much less than we had reason to apprehend it from our former advices. The account of the enemy's having stormed the fort, and cut off Alden's regiment, happily turns out premature. The inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 2, which is a copy of a letter from lord Stirling, of the seventeenth, will advise Congress that the fleet of transports, which had lain at the Hook for some days before, came up the preceding night to the watering-place, and also that some of the ships of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had returned to York dismasted. Your excellency will also see by the inclosure, N<SUP>o</SUP> 3, (which contains an extract, from a letter from general Sullivan, of the eigh∣teenth instant) the latest advices I have respecting admiral Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s fleet. From the loss of the Somerset, and these several accounts, they suffered severely in their late cruise.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 24. I just received from general Hand the inclosed petition from major Whitcomb, addressed to Con∣gress, and his letter to general Hand, of the same date.
<PB N="344" REF="029737_0682_0FE29D966ED8F738"/>
My information respecting the corps under major Whit∣comb's command has hitherto been very imperfect; and even now I do not know the terms on which it was en∣gaged: nor had I, till these letters came to hand, any rea∣son to think that the troops above had not all been equally paid,—having sent up a supply of money for the purpose soon after I came to this camp, and authorized the pay-master-general a few days ago to forward a further quantity. I shall immediately write to general Clinton, now on his way to Albany, to send a proper officer to muster the corps, and also three companies (which he calls provincials) un∣der his direction, said to be engaged to the first of next month;—after which, both will be paid on his presenting proper rolls. With respect to clothing, the only applica∣tion I recollect to have had from major Whitcomb was answered with such supplies, both in quantity and quality, as our stores at the time would admit of. It may perhaps be practicable hereafter to put his corps on a better footing in this instance.</P>
<P>The alarm which major Whitcomb speaks of in the be∣ginning of his letter to general Hand was occasioned (as Congress will perceive by a copy of another letter from him to general Hand) by a descent made by a body of the enemy in the country about the south end of Lake Cham∣plain, and who, according to his report, have done consid∣erable damage.</P>
<P>I directed general Du Portail some time ago to take a view of the works carrying on in the Highlands for the defence of the North-river, and to make an estimate of the cannon necessary for the purpose. This he did; and, as he is now at Philadelphia, I have written to him by this conveyance, and requested him to present the estimate to Congress. I am sorry the number wanted is so great, and the more so as I find upon inquiry that the Salisbury fur∣nace in Connecticut, which used to cast so many, is much out of repair, and could not possibly be put in order, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a proper state for supplies, before May. The providi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of cannon is a matter of infinite importance; and I a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> persuaded Congress will take every means in their pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to accomplish it. Besides the pressing and extensive d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mand for the works on the North-river, we cannot exte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> our views too soon to the obtaining further large suppli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="345" REF="029737_0683_0FE29DFA32FE4688"/>
We must in the course of things have occasion for a great deal of artillery: and, in any enterprise we may undertake against Canada, whether on a large or a small scale, sever∣al pieces of various calibers will be absolutely essential. Besides arming the ships and vessels we shall be obliged to build to gain the navigation of the lakes, our land opera∣tions will require a great number.</P>
<P>A detachment of continental troops will conduct those of the convention from the North-river to the Delaware. The German battalion is to compose part of the escort: and, after the convention troops cross to Pennsylvania, I have directed it, in consequence of the intelligence trans∣mitted of late by Congress respecting the frontiers, to pro∣ceed to Easton with all its baggage, where it is to wait till general Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d arrives at the Minisinks, and whence it will be ready to act as circumstances may require. At the same time, if these frequent detachments from the army could be avoided, it were much to be wished. The troops will be by this means in a very dispersed state; and, be∣sides losing perhaps some advantages which might present themselves if they were more collected, their discipline will be greatly injured, and it will be extremely difficult, from a variety of causes, to draw them together again: and, if it should be practicable, it is highly probable we shall find their number much impaired by desertion and otherwise.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. John Dodge will have the honour of delivering this letter to your excellency. His history is that he is a native of Connecticut, and about eight years ago, as he informs me, settled in the country between Detroit and Pittsburg as an Indian trader;—that he carried on com∣merce till January 1776, when, for his attachment to our cause and the measures he had taken to promote it, he be∣came obnoxious to the enemy, was seized by order of the governor of Detroit, was thrown into prison, and there continued till the beginning of May last, when he was sent to Quebec;—that on the ninth of October he escaped
<PB N="346" REF="029737_0684_0FE29D99880C1EA0"/>
from thence and got into our settlements, through the aid of a French Caghnewaga who came with him▪ here on Friday last.</P>
<P>I find Mr. Dodge an intelligent young man, intimately acquainted with all the tract of country between Pittsburg and Detroit, and with that lying on Lake Erie, also with most of the savage tribes in those parts, and with their languages. He is likewise well acquainted with the com∣munication from Fort Stanwix to Oswego and Niagara.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. Dodge's history to be true; and, from a variety of circumstances, I am persuaded of his firm at∣tachment to us: and I would take the liberty to suggest to Congress that I think he may be of very important ser∣vice to us in any enterprise we may undertake in the west∣ern quarter, or against the force on Lake Erie or Lake Ontario. This consideration, with that of his losses and suffering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which I am inclined to believe have been con∣siderable, seem to make him worthy of notice and atten∣tion. His information is good and clear in several points which I know myself, and in many others, (from the man∣ner in which he delivered it) far superior and much more satisfactory than what I have been able to derive from any other person. As I have observed before, Mr. Dodge ap∣pears to me a valuable intelligencer; and, if Congress are pleased to honour him with an opportunity, he will give them an account of the posts of Detroit and Niagara when he left them, and of that at Michilimachinac,—of the ene∣my's naval force on lakes Erie and Ontario, and of such other matters in Canada as he was able to inform him∣self of, either by his own observation or the relation of others.</P>
<P>General Gates supplied Mr. Dodge with some money to defray his expenses from Boston to this place, and I have advanced him to-day a hundred and fifty dollars more to carry him to Philadelphia.</P>

<P>P. S. Mr. Dodge means to call on major Butler of the light troops, with whom he says he is well acquainted. He also says he is extremely well acquainted with colo∣nel Wood, of Virginia,—but he is not in camp;—and he adds that he was at Pittsburg in 1775, when doctor Walker, Mr. Wilson, and Lewis Morris, esquire, were

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS yesterday honoured with your favour of the twentieth, with its several inclosures. Congress will be pleased to accept my acknowledgments for the communi∣cation of the treaties between his most Christian majesty and the United States. The resolve respecting the ex∣change of prisoners has been transmitted to Sir Henry Clinton, and I have appointed commissioners (if he thinks proper) to meet his at Amboy the seventh of next month.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to inform Congress that the whole army (one brigade and the light corps excepted) is now in motion to the places of their respective cantonments for winter-quarters. I have thought it prudent to delay this event a while, to give time for the convention troops to make some progress in crossing the North-river, to prevent a possibility of accident. The third division passes this day; and, if no unexpected interruption happens, the whole will be over, the thirtieth instant. When their passage is com∣pleted, the remaining troops kept in the field will imme∣diately retire to quarters.</P>
<P>The disposition for winter-quarters is as follows.—Nine brigades will be stationed on the west side of Hudson's river, exclusive of the garrison at West-Point,—one of which (the North-Carolina brigade) will be near Smith's Clove for the security of that pass, and as a reinforcement to West-Point in case of necessity; another (the Jersey brigade) will be at Elizabethtown, to cover the lower part of Jersey; and the other seven, consisting of the Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania troops, will be at Middlebrook. Six brigades will be left on the east side of the river and at West-Point;—three of which (of the Massachusetts troops) will be stationed for the immediate defence of the Highlands; one at West-Point in addition to the garrison already there; and the other two at Fish-kill and the Continental Village. The remaining three brigades, composed of the New-Hampshire and Connecti∣cut troops, and Hazen's regiment, will be posted in the
<PB N="348" REF="029737_0686_0FE29D9B134C6248"/>
vicinity of Danbury, for the protection of the country ly∣ing along the Sound, to cover our magazines lying on Connecticut-river, and to aid the Highlands on any serious movement of the enemy that way. The park of artillery will be at Pluckemin. The cavalry will be disposed of thus:—Bland's regiment at Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chester in Virginia, Bay∣lor's at Frederic or Hagarstown in Maryland, Moylan's at Lancaster in Pennsylvania, and Sheldon's at Durham in Connecticut. Lee's corps will be with that part of the army which is in the Jerseys acting on the advanced posts. This comprehends the general distribution of the army, except Clinton's brigade of New-York troops, Pulaski's corps, and some detached regiments and corps stationed at Albany and at different parts of the frontier, of which Congress have already been particularly advised. General Putnam will command at Danbury, General M<SUP>c</SUP>Dougal in the Highlands, and my own quarters will be in the Jer∣seys, in the neighbourhood of Middlebrook.</P>
<P>This disposition appeared to me best calculated to con∣ciliate as far as possible these several objects,—the protec∣tion of the country, the security of the important posts in the Highlands, the safety, discipline, and easy subsistence of the army. To have kept the troops in a collected state would have increased infinitely the expense and difficulty of subsisting them, both with respect to forage and provi∣sions: to have divided them into smaller cantonments would have made it far less practicable to maintain order and discipline among them, and would have put them less in a condition to control and prevent offensive operations on the side of the enemy, or to assemble to take advantage of any favourable opening which their future situation may offer, should they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> weaken themselves by further detachments so far as to invite an enterprise against them.</P>
<P>By the estimate of the quarter-master and commissary-general, it appears indispensable to have the principal part of the army on the other side of the North-river. It was thought impracticable to furnish the necessary supplies of flour for the whole, on this side the river, from the im∣mense difficulty and expense of transportation in the win∣ter season, and from the exhausted state of the country with respect to forage. As this subject has been already
<PB N="349" REF="029737_0687_0FE29DFD39593A88"/>
fully before Congress, I shall not trouble them with a rep∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ition of the detail. In order as much as possible to re∣duce the demand of forage and facilitate the supplies, I have given directions, when the several divisions arrive at their cantonments, to send away to convenient places at a distance from them all the horses not absolutely requisite to carry on the ordinary business of the army.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to add that the troops must again have recourse to the expedient of hutting as they did last year. But, as they are now well clad, and we have had more leisure to make some little preparations for winter-quarters, I hope they will be in a more comfortable situation than they were in the preceding winter. With the highest respect and esteem, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>As many inconveniences would attend the removing of the sick officers and men of the convention troops by land, and the officers having families, I have written to general Gates to permit them to proceed to the falls of James's-river by water, on the officers' giving their paroles that they and the men will perform the voyage. I have also acquainted him of the meeting in contemplation for an ex∣change of prisoners, that the officers may not leave Boston till the result is known.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to address you by command of his excellency, who went from this place at four o'clock this morning, in consequence of advice received last night that fifty-two vessels great and small, including a bomb-ketch, with troops on board, had, the day before yesterday, moved up the North-river as far as Cloyster-landing, and yesterday morning got under way and were proceeding far∣ther up. He proposed to make his first stage at Acquake∣nunk, and to proceed as his future intelligence might re∣quire. He is much at a loss to determine the design of the enemy, but thinks it may either have respect to the forts in the Highlands or to the convention troops.</P>
<P>When he left Peekskill, the two Massachusetts brigades, on their march thither from Hartford, were not arrived, so that the troops on the spot were only the original garri∣son of West-Point, and Nixon's brigade which lay near the Continental Village: but, without the most inexplica∣ble delay, those must have reached their destination some days since. If so, and the enemy should meditate a stroke against West-Point, they will probably fail in it unless there should be something like a surprise. The general also thinks it probable that the Maryland division were yesterday even∣ing at the Clove. Their instructions were, to communicate with West-Point and reinforce it on any emergency. They were, in addition to them, directed last night by express to move immediately towards the forts, divested of baggage and artillery, for the more speedy communication. The Carolina brigade has been some time stationed at the en∣trance of the Clove.</P>
<P>One brigade of the Virginia troops is at Pompton, and the other two were expected to reach Springfield yesterday. The Pennsylvania troops, it is supposed, would be at Ac∣quakenunk or in the neighbourhood of Paramus. These troops, immediately on receiving the present intelligence,
<PB N="351" REF="029737_0689_0FE29E17EC297738"/>
were ordered to halt; and his excellency is gone forward to regulate their movements according to circumstances. The brigade in this town is ordered to hold itself in readiness.</P>
<P>If the convention troops should be their object, it is prob∣able the attempt will be too late to answer any purpose: the rear division was to cross the North-river on Wednes∣day last, but must certainly have done it on Thursday; the front must be not far from the Delaware; and the whole too far advanced to be subject to a rescue. Added to this, there is a pretty strong guard with each division. His excellency however has sent on the intelligence to colonel Bland who directs their march, urging him to hasten them forward with all possible dispatch.</P>
<P>One brigade of Connecticut troops was at Danbury, the other at Fredericsburg, when we came away; and general Poor's was in full march for the former, and must long since have arrived.</P>

<P>Upon leaving Elizabethtown I directed colonel Harri∣son to inform you of the intelligence I had received, and which I thought demanded my personal attention, as the enemy appeared to be going up the river in considerable force. Having put the troops destined for the Middlebrook cantonment upon their march back towards the North-riv∣er, I was proceeding that way myself when an express met me a few miles beyond this, informing me that the enemy's shipping, which had been as high as King's ferry, had fall∣en down again. They landed a party at the ferry, and set fire to a few small buildings near the water; but, upon a party of ours advancing, they immediately [<HI>re-embarked</HI>] without attempting any thing further. The boats and stores of every kind had been previously secured. I cannot ac∣count
<PB N="352" REF="029737_0690_0FE29E0A200BBC40"/>
for this manoeuvre but by supposing that they had been mis-informed as to the quantity of stores at the ferry, or that they expected to find the posts in a defenceless situation; or it may perhaps have been to favour a forage below.</P>
<P>Finding that the troops destined for the defence of the Highlands had arrived at their respective posts agreeably to my orders and expectations, I have again put those in∣tended for Middlebrook into motion; and I hope they will arrive there while the roads and weather are both fine.</P>
<P>Accounts from New-York through a good channel in∣form me that thirty thousand tons of shipping had been suddenly taken up for government service, and that a gen∣eral embargo is laid. The occasion has not yet transpired; at least it has not yet reached me.</P>

But the perfect confidence I have in the justice and candour of that honourable body emboldens me to communicate without reserve the difficul∣ties which occur in the execution of their present order; and the indulgence I have experienced on every former occasion induces me to imagine that the liberty I now take will not meet with their disapprobation.</P>
<P>I have attentively taken up the report of the committee of the fifth (approved by Congress) on the subject of my letter of the eleventh ultimo on the proposed expedition into Canada: I have considered it in several lights, and sincerely regret that I should feel myself under any embar∣rassment in carrying it into execution: Still I remain of opinion, from a general review of things and the state of our resources, that no extensive system of co-operation with the French, for the complete emancipation of Cana∣da, can be positively decided on for the ensuing year. To propose a plan of perfect co-operation with a foreign pow∣er without a moral certainty in our supplies, and to have that plan actually ratified with the court of Versailles, might be attended, in case of failure in the conditions on our part, with very fatal effects.</P>
<P>If I should seem unwilling to transmit the plan as pre∣pared by Congress, with my observations, it is because I find myself under a necessity (in order to give our minister sufficient ground to found an application on) to propose something more than a vague and indecisive plan, which, even in the event of a total evacuation of these States by the enemy, may be rendered impracticable in the execution by a variety of insurmountable obstacles: or if I retain my present sentiments and act consistently, I must point out the difficulties as they appear to me; which must embar∣rass his negociations, and may disappoint the views of Con∣gress.</P>
<P>But, proceeding on the idea of the enemy's leaving these States before the active part of the ensuing campaign, I should fear to hazard a mistake as to the precise aim and extent of the views of Congress. The line of conduct
<PB N="354" REF="029737_0692_0FE29E0BA2F612C0"/>
that I am to observe in writing to our minister at the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of France does not appear sufficiently delineated:—were I to undertake it, I should be much afraid of erring through misconception. In this dilemma I would esteem it a par∣ticular favour to be excused from writing at all on the sub∣ject, especially as it is the part of candour in me to ac∣knowledge that I do not see my way clear enough to point out such a plan for co-operation as I conceive to be con∣sistent with the ideas of Congress, and that will be suffi∣ciently explanatory with respect to time and circumstances, to give efficacy to the measure. But if Congress still think it necessary for me to proceed in the business, I must re∣quest their more definitive and explicit instructions, and that they will permit me, previous to transmitting the in∣tended dispatches, to submit them to their determination.</P>
<P>I could wish to lay before Congress more minutely the state of the army, the condition of our supplies, and the requisi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s necessary for carrying into execution an under∣taking that may involve the most serious events. If Con∣gress think this can be done more satisfactorily in a personal conference, I hope to have the army in such a situation before I can receive their answer, as to afford me an op∣portunity of giving my attendance. I would only add that I shall cheerfully comply with the directions of Con∣gress relative to making every preparation in our power for an expedition against Niagara, and for such further opera∣tions to the northward as time and circumstances shall en∣able us to carry on. Measures for the purpose have been taken in part for some time past; and I shall pursue them vigorously. The subject has long engaged my contempla∣tion; and I am thoroughly convinced of the expediency and policy of doing every thing practicable on our part, for giving security to our frontiers by the reduction of those places which facilitate annoying them, and even for ac∣complishing the annexation of Canada to the Union.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a letter which I had the honour of receiving from Congress, dated the second instant, was inclosed the copy of one from lieutenant-colonel Fleury, upon the subject of which, the president desired me to express "my sentiments, as also of the merits of Mr. Fleury during his services in the army."</P>
<P>I do not conceive that Congress should request a renew∣al of colonel Fleury's furlough from the French minister plenipotentiary. An application of that kind ought, in my opinion, to be made by himself, not only because it is cus∣tomary, but because solicitations of a similar nature would in all probability be made by many not having Mr. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ry's claim to the favour of the public, and to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would be difficult to give a refusal after a precedent had been established. I would not be understood to include the case of general Du Portail and the gentlemen in the engineering department, who are peculiarly circumstanced, and in whose behalf I have written particularly to Congress.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Fleury's merits as an officer, I can only re∣peat what I have upon several occasions mentioned to Con∣gress before,—that he is brave, active, and intelligent, and that, should he obtain leave to remain in America, I shall take an opportunity (agreeably to my promise to him) of employing him in a manner suitable to his rank, and in such a way as will not clash with the officers of the line.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addressing you on the thirteenth, the gentlemen appointed to meet commissioners from Sir Henry Clinton have returned to camp. Your excellency will find, by a copy of their report, N<SUP>o</SUP>. 7, (which, with the other papers respecting the meeting is inclosed,) that an exchange of prisoners has not taken place.</P>
<P>As an exchange has not been effected, and Sir Henry Clinton has called for all our officers on parole, I shall, in consequence of the resolution of the nineteenth ultimo,
<PB N="356" REF="029737_0694_0FE29E0D26C1C4A8"/>
order the commissary of prisoners to require the immediate return of the convention and any other officers with the enemy on parole. I do not mean however to include gen∣eral Burgoyne in the demand unless Congress should di∣rect it, as there appear to me many political reasons for permitting him to remain in Britain in his present temper. But if Congress should differ from me in opinion on this point, I shall be happy to be informed, that measures may be pursued for his recal.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of addressing Congress some time since on the subject of general Du Portail and the gentle∣men with him. He informs me that his affair has not yet been decided, and is extremely anxious that it should be in some way or other. He assigns many powerful reasons to shew that it is very interesting to him (if he is not to continue in our service) to return to France as speedily as possible. He also informs me that he has reason to think, in the consideration of his affair, the retaining him in service and the adopting the plan proposed in his memoir are unit∣ed, and the decision of the one suspended on that of the other; and has therefore requested me to represent to Con∣gress that he should be happy if they could be considered separately; and if his services, abstractedly from the project proposed by him, are deemed necessary, it will be agreea∣ble to him to remain in the country.</P>
<P>I have already taken the liberty to offer my sentiments on the propriety of engaging these gentlemen to continue in the service. It really appears to me that they will be essentially necessary to our future operations, whether de∣fensive or offensive; and it cannot therefore but give me pleasure if it shall be consistent with the views of Congress to retain them, and to give every encouragement which they may reasonably expect.</P>
