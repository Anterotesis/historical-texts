<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM LXXVIII. 5, 6, 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children. That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children. That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE importance of the rising generation, has engaged the attention of the wise and good, in all ages. Experienced old men have ardently desired the best good of posterity. Patriarchs, prophets, and apostles have laboured to promote it. The inspired writer of this Psalm, impressed deeply with the subject, calls on us to attend to the words of his mouth, even the words which had been received from the fathers which, said he, we will not hide from their children, "shewing to the generations to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength and his wonderful works."</P>
<P>THE words of our text contain a summary of God's law and testimony which he appointed for his people, to be transmitted to succeeding generations; that the knowledge and practice of true religion might be preserved to the end of the world. It will not be doubted that this subject claims our most serious attention, on the present occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024381_0004_0FC63968120AED50"/>WE shall attempt an illustration of it by con∣sidering the law and testimony which God hath established in his church. And</P>
<P>THE great importance of transmitting them to posterity.</P>
<P N="1">I. WE are to consider the law and testimony which God hath established in his church.</P>
<P>WERE we to confine our views to the time of the Psalmist, nothing more would be comprised than those sacred books of the old testament▪ which were compleat in his day. The words of our text have a manifest reference to the writings of Moses, but they may be more extensively ap∣plied. God's law and testimony was a progressive revelation, through the several periods, from the first age of the world, till the completion of the sacred canon. Before the deluge, and in the days of the patriarchs, Noah and Abraham, only a few revelations were given to the church.—Large additions were made in the time of Moses. In succeeding ages, the will of God was further re∣vealed to man, by his prophets and other inspired messengers, till the scriptures of the old testament were compleated. And, at the appointed time, the Divine Redeemer appeared, in our world, and having finished his labours and sufferings on earth, and ascended to glory, he shed down the Holy Ghost on his apostles and others, to commit to writing the whole New Testament for the benefit of his church, to the end of the world.—Thus, "Holy men of God, spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Peter i. 21.</NOTE>," And, "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners, spake to the fathers,
<PB N="7" REF="024381_0005_0FC6396C3A2C1318"/>
by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken un∣to us by his Son<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 1, 2.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>HENCE, we are to understand, the law and tes∣timony of God, in the days of the Psalmist, to comprise all parts of divine revelation then given to the church. To us they imply the whole canon of holy scripture. These sacred writings are "given by inspiration of God, and are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in∣struction in righteousness. That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 16, 17.</NOTE>." But they, "principally, teach, what man is to believe, concerning God, and what duty God requires of man." Proofs, of the being and perfections of God, surround us in his works. "The heavens declare his glory, and the firma∣ment sheweth his handy work. Day unto day ut∣tereth speech, and night unto night sheweth know∣ledge<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Psalm xix. 1, 2.</NOTE>." And "the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made, even his eternal power and Godhead<NOTE N="{reversed ¶}" PLACE="foot">Psalm xix. 7.</NOTE>." But "the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple<NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 20.</NOTE>." It is from the written word that we are to learn in the fullest manner, the divine perfections and will, and without which we are utterly in the dark as to the door of hope for sin∣ners, and the way in which salvation is attain∣able.</P>
<P>THE law and testimony of God instruct us in all needful truth. In these, we are taught in the
<PB N="8" REF="024381_0006_0FC63972EA49B6D0"/>
clearest manner, the natural and moral perfecti∣ons of God.—The creation of all things, by the word of his power.—The relations of man to his Creator, and to his fellow creatures.—The origi∣nal state of innocence and felicity, and the nature and extent of God's moral government.—Those divine writings, teach us the sad and inexcusable apostacy of the first man, and the consequent state of sin and condemnation, to him and his posterity. Here we learn that mysterious glory of the divine existence.—<HI>A Trinity in Unity.</HI>—From this we are led, in the progressive revelation, to a view of the second person in the adorable Trinity, as the Redeemer of man.—The holy scriptures inform us of "the counsel of peace," or the plan of re∣demption fixed in the purpose of God, and accom∣plished in the person of, THE WORD. The great mystery of godliness is here displayed. "God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory." The work of redemption, is evidently, the greatest of God's works revealed to man. To this all his other works tend, and in this they centre. For this reason a principal part of the sacred scriptures are employed in treating on this subject.</P>
<P>"OF this salvation, the prophets enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace which should come unto us; searching what, or what manner of time, the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified before hand, the sufferings of Christ, and the glory which should follow."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="024381_0007_0FC6397528A430A8"/>THE apostles were "witnesses of the sufferings of Christ," and they "determined to know no∣thing among their hearers, save Jesus Christ and him crucified."</P>
<P>IN connexion with the person and work of Christ, and redemption by his blood; the law and testimony reveal to us the work of the holy spirit, in the application of redemption, and the way in which sinners become united to Christ, and partakers in the saving benefits of his death. Here we are taught the necessity of "repentance to∣wards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ." That without faith, it is impossible to please God,"—That "he who believeth shall be saved, but he who believeth not, shall be damn∣ed." That men are "justified by faith without the deeds of the law"—"Justified freely by the grace of God, through the redemption which is in Jesus Christ." From these oracles, we also learn, that the faith of God's elect, is connected with a life of christian holiness, or obedience to all divine commands,—that "those, only who do God's commandments, are blessed, have right to the tree of life, and shall enter in through the gates into the city."</P>
<P>ALL gospel institutions and ordinances belong to the divine testimony, and are enjoined in the holy scriptures.—The religious and devout observa∣tion of them is an important part of christian holi∣ness, and those who fear God, count them among their greatest blessings.—Private and social prayer to God, and other branches of his worship—The observation of the Lord's day.—Of the christian sacraments.—Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, are
<PB N="10" REF="024381_0008_0FC63977369FA480"/>
not only enjoined as duties, but granted as privi∣leges.—In connexion with those is the institution of the christian church and evangelical ministry.—The office and work of the ministry, and the order, unity and discipline of the church, are ap∣pointed by God, "for the perfecting the saints, for the edifying the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the know∣ledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."</P>
<P>THE holy scriptures enjoin the duties of sensible dependence on God.—Submission in adversity, and of humility and thankfulness in prosperity. They teach us in whatever state we are, "therewith to be content," and furnish rules by which if duly applied, we shall "know how to be abased and how to abound—to be full and to be hungry."—They instruct us to be as strangers and pilgrims on earth, to lay up treasure in heaven, and endure as seeing him who is invisible. In all conditions, and through all changes, living or dying; the word of God furnishes a rich supply of needful truth: that the good man may say with thankful praise, "thy testimonies, O Lord, are wonderful, therefore doth my soul keep them." "The en∣trance of thy word giveth life, it giveth under∣standing to the simple."</P>
<P>IT must be remembered that God's law and tes∣timony contain all necessary rules of duty in our various relations to each other. There we may learn our duty and happiness, as husbands and wives, parents and children, and in all other do∣mestic relations.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="024381_0009_0FC6397979F65548"/>THE word of God also, inculcates the love of our neighbor, and teaches us to respect all men as such. It requires us to "love our enemies, and do good to those who hate us, to pray for those who despitefully use us, and persecute us."—To "bear one another's burdens, relieve the distres∣sed, visit the fatherless and widows in their afflic∣tions," and be "ready to every good work."</P>
<P>THIS sacred book not only teaches men the love of their country, but inspires them with that true patriotism which seeks its best interest and pro∣duces all becoming exertions to promote it.—And that in such a manner as to advance the good of deserving individuals, and to coincide with the true interest of other countries, and of mankind.—We must not omit to observe, that the love of our country, required in the holy scriptures, is such as is subservient to the glory of God. To this, all its exertions tend, and in it they are ultimately absorbed.</P>
<P>THE divine word teaches us to spend life in preparation for death and heaven.—It assures us of the conscious existence of those, who are absent from the body—Of the resurrection, both of the just and unjust—Of the final judgment, and the ne∣verending blessedness of the righteous, and punish∣ment of the wicked, and it presents the most awful and endearing motives to persuade us to live un∣der the governing influence of those great and everlasting realities; and it offers such divine sup∣ports, in afflictions and death, as if duly applied, will enable us to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, and fear no evil, and in the lan∣guage of thankful exultation to cry, "O death,
<PB N="12" REF="024381_0010_0FC6397AC440B6F0"/>
where is thy sting. O grave, where is thy vic∣tory!</P>
<P N="2">II. THE great importance of transmitting to posterity, the divine law and testimony will ap∣pear from the following considerations.</P>
<P N="1">1st. THE worth of posterity.</P>
<P>THE importance of man will deeply impress the mind which attentively considers it. The pre∣sent and future existence are, both of them, high∣ly interesting, but especially the latter. The va∣rious endowments of the mind of man, in connex∣ion with his immortality, render his existence im∣portant, in the highest degree.—Such is the worth of the human soul, that in the estimate of unerring wisdom, it is not to be exchanged for the whole world<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Math. xvi. 26.</NOTE>. This worth is summarily comprised in the capacity for possessing and diffusing happiness, or which issues in the same, for union to God and his kingdom. Each individual of the present and future ages will fill a place in the scale of beings, through never-ending duration: important in eve∣ry period of his existence; how important then in the whole of it! The present infant of a day, is a being of immortality, and will act a part which will materially effect the felicity, not of himself only, but of the whole moral system, and that for∣ever.</P>
<P>SUCH considerations show the importance of man, and the worth of posterity; but it is still more strongly marked in the agency of God with respect to our race. This world is evidently cre∣ated to be an habitation for man, the various or∣ders of inferior creatures, were made and ap∣pointed
<PB N="13" REF="024381_0011_0FC6397C4BD678C8"/>
for his service; and the whole course of events from the first creation, is directed with re∣ference to him. But what swallows up all other considerations on this subject, is, <HI>the work of re∣demption!</HI> to this, nothing can be added to evince the importance of man, and the worth of posteri∣ty: the whole is expressed in saying that "<HI>in due time, Christ died for the ungodly</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Romans v. 6.</NOTE>." and that, "<HI>God so loved the world, that he gave his only be∣gotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">John iii, 16.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="2">2d. THE felicity and usefulness of posterity de∣pends on a becoming regulation of their principles and manners. This consists in their receiving God's testimonies, and reducing them to practice. These testimonies enjoin the several branches of that religion which is summarily contained in the love of God and man. Without which they can be neither happy nor useful<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">This assertion respects only the nature and tendency of moral dispositions, and is by no means to be understood in opposition to the important truth, that God by his wise and holy agency, so over-rules the wickedness of his enemies, and counteracts its nature and tendency as to render it subservient to the purpose of his in∣finite wisdom and holiness, and thus, by "educing good from ill," he causes the wrath of man to praise him, and the remainder of wrath, he graciously restrains.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT each of these depend on such dispositions will appear to be true, to whatever particular we apply the observation.</P>
<P>WHAT but mutual affection constitutes that har∣mony of minds which is termed friendship?—Such union of hearts is the source and band of domestic felicity: if this be wanting, how deplo∣rably miserable is the nearest of human connex∣ions
<PB N="14" REF="024381_0012_0FC63983B18BDA68"/>
even in the midst of all other earthly good. But where this is found it not only gives worth to all other enjoyments, but supplies their absence, and gives truly sublime satisfaction in the midst of calamity. All family relations, and other social connexions are found to be happy in proportion to this, and the reverse if it be wanting.</P>
<P>THE interests of society at large are proportion∣ably effected, and depend on the union of its mem∣bers, and where this in any good measure exists, the benevolent spectator will behold it with plea∣sure, and exultingly cry out, "Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell to∣gether in unity."—But as man is a being of im∣mortality, and a member of that vast society, com∣prising all intelligent beings, his felicity and use∣fulness are principally to be measured in relation to that.—When viewed in this connexion, how interesting is the present subject!—Those whose principles and manners are formed to the business and enjoyments of God's kingdom, are prepared for the noblest existence. It is by the love of God and man they are thus formed. Without this their noble endowments will be employed in a manner strongly tending to the injury of others, and with regret to themselves. This tendency will be ef∣fectual and everlasting.</P>
<P>THE only possible method of escape from this evil is in receiving God's testimonies and reducing them to practice.—And in this way only will they live in the most useful manner to others on earth, and be actively useful in heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THAT posterity may be thus useful and hap∣py, they must be instructed in God's testimonies.
<PB N="15" REF="024381_0013_0FC639868521A110"/>
It belongs indeed to God only, to form the heart to the love of divine truth. Paul may plant, and Apollos water, the best means may be applied in vain, unless attended with the blessing of God. However, it is his good pleasure to bless his own institutions. We are as totally dependent on him for the health and support of the body. Our dai∣ly bread is the gift of his bounty, no less than the food for the soul. But who will infer from thence, that we are not to apply the appointed means, to obtain food for ourselves and our families? The duty is not less evident, and is much more impor∣tant in regard to the soul. A proper sense of our dependence on God, that our posterity may be formed to be useful and happy, will lead to a faithful application of the appointed means.</P>
<P>AN acquaintance with the word of God is the great appointed medium of that felicity and use∣fulness which is to be sought for posterity; this is to be obtained by instruction. For many reasons it is important that this instruction should be given in youth: the mind is then most susceptible of last∣ing impressions; habits of ignorance and obstina∣cy are not formed, at most they have not attained the firmness of long indulgence; bad example has not exerted its baneful influence to strengthen them in the way of death; inveterate custom has not fixed them in the walks of vice, and rendered them callous to the truths of religion, and the re∣monstrances of conscience.</P>
<P>SAD experience evinces, that few who have spent their youth in vice and folly, are brought to re∣pentance and reformation in advanced age. Of these few were the cases examined, it would pro∣bably
<PB N="16" REF="024381_0014_0FC6398AB4011858"/>
be found that in most of them, the founda∣tion was laid by early instruction. Innumerable have been the instances of its success. How many of God's people have blessed him for the instruc∣tion of their youth, and that from their childhood they have "known the holy scriptures, which are able to make them wise to salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus."—Admitting that a few have been made wise to salvation who never enjoyed this inestimable privilege, (for we rejoice in the unlimited sovereignty of God, and that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy:) yet how disproportioned are their means to be useful and happy, and how deeply must they lament the want of that early and pious instruction recommended in our text! and how superior the advantages of those who have enjoyed it!</P>
<P>BUT alas! how vast are the numbers of those, who live and die in extreme ignorance of God and religion; not only in the regions of unenlighten∣ed paganism, but even in the midst of those who enjoy the gospel! Their untaught childhood and youth have prepared them to despise religious knowledge in riper years. Habits of vice have induced them to add contempt to ignorance, till they have increased the number of those "fools who despise wisdom and instruction, make a mock at sin, and die for want of wisdom."</P>
<P N="4">4th. THE instruction of children and youth in God's testimonies, should be the great concern of parents.</P>
<P>IF posterity are instructed at all in these things, it must be principally by their care.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="024381_0015_0FC6398C09421248"/>THIS instruction cannot be supposed to be ob∣tained by themselves, or their own unassisted ex∣ertions. If it be not the duty of parents, to whom doth it belong? and how shall it be obtain∣ed? The God of nature has established the course of society,—the relations of parent and child are his appointment; he hath constituted that singleness of affection, that identity of inte∣rests and enjoyments between the two parents, which directs their joint exertions, in nursing and educating their offspring, and which nothing but the height of obstinacy in wickedness can prevent.—As children in general must probably be un∣taught in God's testimonies, and devoted to ruin if they are neglected by their parents, so the great∣est benefits may be hoped for in a compliance with this duty.—The advantages in the hand of parents for success are distinguishingly great: they are much in the company of their children, and have abundant opportunity to impress the ob∣jects of religion on their minds.—The earliest im∣pressions of their offspring are highly favorable to such views. Beside the foundation in nature for the most tender reciprocal affections between pa∣rents and children—the early dependence in one, and exertions of kindness in the other, greatly increase the nearness; the parents are strongly prompted to instruct, and the children to learn; prepossessed as they are, in favor of their parents, and inclined to adopt their sentiments and manners, will they not hang on their lips, and re∣ceive the instructions of wisdom!—Allowing that the state of sin which is common to man, and in which our children are partakers, is opposed to
<PB N="18" REF="024381_0016_0FC6398D8D57F460"/>
the admission of saving knowledge, is this an ob∣jection against <HI>parental instruction</HI>? doth it not even shew its superior importance?—Or, are all means to be neglected, because the fallen race are dull of hearing? Should we not infer just the reverse, and in imitation of the divine example, "give them line upon line, and precept upon precept<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isaiah <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>."</P>
<P>MOREOVER this important duty is committed to parents, by the wisdom of God—under the ancient dispensation such are the divine directions.</P>
<P>"THESE words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart, and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes, and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Deut. vi. 6, 7, 8, 9.</NOTE>. That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Deut. xi. 21.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>AMONG the many passages in the sacred writings inculcating this important duty, we add only this summary direction.—"Fathers provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nur∣ture and admonition of the Lord<NOTE N="{reversed ¶}" PLACE="foot">Ephesians vi. 4.</NOTE>."</P>
<P N="5">5th. WE must not omit to observe, that paren∣tal education is the great instituted mean for the good of posterity: this might be shewn from the experience of all ages, and the word of God.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="024381_0017_0FC6399527A41A10"/>IT appears from particulars already mentioned, that childhood and youth are the seasons for im∣planting those practical sentiments in the human mind, which are to influence through life, and most essentially affect the condition of man through the whole of his existence. Experience confirms this truth, both in the happy fruits of a well di∣rected education, and in the sad consequences where it has been neglected.—Admitting that a good education has not always been attended with de∣sired success, and that some men have become wise and good who never enjoyed it; in the former case it only proves the sad degeneracy of human nature, and the great danger of youth; and in the latter, it displays the sovereign freedom of devine grace: but in neither, counteracts the dictates of reason and common experience, found∣ed on the stated course of events in the provi∣dence of God, and the history of man.—Because the best medicines are not always successful to re∣store the sick, and in some instances they recover with none or with bad ones; shall we, herefore not apply this stated mean of recovery, or shall we pre∣fer the advice of Quacks and Empiries to that of the most approved practitioners?</P>
<P>BUT a truth of this importance rests not meer∣ly or chiefly on the conclusions of fallible man.—The word of God abundantly confirms it.</P>
<P>TO set this matter in the strongest light would require long quotations from many parts of the sacred writings, and would draw out the dis∣course to an unreasonable length, and indeed, would be needless, as few or none have ever appeared to deny the present truth. And writers
<PB N="20" REF="024381_0018_0FC6399A0BCF7000"/>
who have differed widely as to the standing of the children of faithful parents, with respect to the gracious covenant of God, and their title to its blessings, have nevertheless agreed in the di∣vine appointment of parental education, as the great mean for the good of posterity <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>A particular discussion of the standing of baptized children, as distinguished from others who are educated under the gospel, and the obligations and encouragements which are peculiar to them, would not have been adapted to the particular design of this dis∣course; and would rather have diverted the attention of the hear∣ers from its main object; which was to impress the minds of <HI>all</HI> parents with a practical sense of the duty and importance of the religious education of their children: and <HI>all</HI> children and youth with a sense of their great obligations to improve whatever degree of religious education they have enjoyed, in a life of practical religion.</P><P>The additional privileges and duties of those who are the chil∣dren of faithful parents, devoted to God by christian baptism in their infancy, are exceedingly important; and worthy a par∣ticular and separate cosideration: but could not so properly be illustrated in this discourse.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>UNDER the general term of <HI>parental education</HI> we mean to comprise the whole of the duty en∣joined on parents in training up their children; their dedication to God in their infancy, accord∣ing to his institution, perpetuated by a course of daily prayer, unreservedly devoting them to him for his blessing.—A course of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and well directed instructions, from the first opening of their understandings, suitable to their age, capa∣city, and other circumstances, ultimately adapted to their last improvement in the knowledge of God and true religion, and to excite them to a life of practical holiness.—Add to this, the steady and well directed exertions of parental authority and love; enforcing their instructions: and above
<PB N="21" REF="024381_0019_0FC6399B09923DB8"/>
all, the efficacious influence of wise and pious ex∣ample; without which, there can be little hope from instruction and the exercise of authority. From the combined influence of these, we are en∣couraged to hope for success in parental educati∣on; and not merely or cheifly from its natural tendency, however well adapted, but from divine institution and that gracious influence which God is pleased often to bestow, in connection with the means of his own appointment.—That means are divinely instituted for the best good of young children, and even <HI>infants</HI> cannot be questioned, after the express decision of our blessed Redeemer.</P>
<P>ON a certain occasion, when such were brought to him, (undoubtedly by their parents,) for his blessing, some of his disciples were so remarkably blind, as to object to it; but he sweetly reproved them.—The history of this event deserves our at∣tention. It runs thus. "And they brought young children or infants to him, that he should touch them, and lay his hands on them, and pray: and when his disciples saw it, they rebuked those who brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased; and said, suffer the little chil∣dren to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>VERILY I say unto you, whosoever shall not re∣ceive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall, in no wise, enter therein. And he called them unto him, and took them up in his arms, and put his hands on them and blessed them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Math. xix, 13—15. Mark x, 13—16. Luke xviii, 15—17.</NOTE>."</P>

with our text; we have sufficient evidences of the divine appointment of parental education, as the great mean of the good of posterity. Would any attend more fully to the extent of the evi∣dence, they may consult the history of Gods co∣venant with Abraham—the history of Job's at∣tention to the best good of his children—the in∣spired writings of David and Solomon—and in∣deed, the whole bible.</P>
<P>THE reflections and conduct of our divine teacher, in the case just quoted, are full of the most useful instruction. Happy parents, who brought those children to Christ for his blessing, and happy children who received it from him. For we know that those whom HE blesseth, are indeed blessed.</P>
<P>How much must those parents have been edified and comforted, by such condescending love of the blessed Jesus—what lasting impressions must have been made by it on the minds of the children,—and what animating encouragement is, hereby, presented to parents and children, in all ages, to go and do likewise<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">History informs us that the celebrated Ignatius, afterwards Bishop of Antioch, was one of these infants. See Dodredges in loc.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>FROM such views, we may reasonably hope for the blessing of God in common with the faithful and well directed performance of parental duty; that our children may be useful and happy on earth, and blessed forever in the kingdom of God. We proceed to observe,</P>
<P N="6">6th. THE education of the present generation, may be justly expected to have a happy influence on many succeeding ages.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="024381_0021_0FC6399EC60E1C20"/>THIS is a leading sentiment in the text.—It was verified in the Psalmist, who had received the im∣portant truths, which it contains, in this manner through successive generations, from Moses to his own time; agreeably to the divine injunction to which he refers, which required such instructions to their children, "<HI>that the generation to come might know them. Even the children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children,</HI> that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments."</P>
<P>SCRIPTURE history abounds with facts in confir∣mation of the present truth. We may reasonably conclude, it was in this way, that the knowledge and practice of true religion were preserved in the family of <HI>Seth,</HI> to the time of the deluge; while the pious race were distinguished by the ti∣tle of "<HI>the Sons of God</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Genesis, vi. 2.</NOTE>." The intercourse of these, with the wicked descendants of Cain, broke the chain of religious education, and a ge∣neral apostacy brought on the destruction of man∣kind.</P>
<P>NOAH was found righteous before God in that evil generation, and was saved with his family from the common ruin. His son <HI>Ham</HI> very soon forsook the true religion, and was the father of a degenerate and accursed race; most probably in consequence of alliance with the family of Cain<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Genesis, iv. 22. <HI>Naamah</HI> is the only fe∣male descendant of Adam, mentioned by name in the history of the old world, as some Expositors suppose, because she was the wise of Ham, and the mother of a degenerate race after the flood.</NOTE>. But the true religion was preserved for many
<PB N="24" REF="024381_0022_0FC639A052D4C918"/>
years in the family of Shem. No doubt by means of the pious education which he received from his father Noah, and transmitted to his children.</P>
<P>WHEN idolatry was fast spreading among his de∣scendents, most probably <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the fruit of affinity with the wicked posterity of Ham, and the conse∣quent neglect of good parental education, it plea∣sed God to call Abram, one of his posterity, and the ninth in descent from him, and instruct him in the religion of his pious progenitors, and also to favor him with several new and important reve∣lations. How he improved these, in the education of his children, we learn from the divine decla∣ration, in the following words: "I know him, that he will command his children and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Genesis xviii. 19.</NOTE>." We may have the fruits of his pious exertions in the character of his descendents, Isaac and Jacob, "the heirs with him of the same promise."</P>
<P>As the chosen family increased, and their inter∣course with their idolatrous neighbors was ex∣tended, there was a decline of religious education, and the nation became sadly degenerated. This was uniformly the case, when they married strange wives of the idolatrous nations round them, which effectually obstructed a religious education. But the good effects of it in these instances, where it did exist, are conspicuous in the history of that people from beginning to end. It is observable also, in some who were not of the chosen family—the instance of the Rachabites is instructive and memorable. The injunctions of Jonadab, their
<PB N="25" REF="024381_0023_0FC639A4EA91D3C0"/>
father or progenitor, were religiously observed by them for many ages<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Compare, 2d Kings x. 15, with Jeremiah xxxv. 1—11.</NOTE>. The pious Timothy was the happy subject of that "unfeigned saith which dwelt first in his mother Lois, and his grand mother Eunice<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">2d Timothy i. 5.</NOTE>; and from a child, no doubt by the pious education of his mother, he had known the Holy Scriptures, which were able to make him wise to salvation through faith in Christ Je∣sus<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Chapter iii. 15.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>SUCH is the readiness of the human mind to be influenced by parental education, that, when this is opposed to the dictates of the Holy Scriptures, and the clearest reason, it often establishes youth in opposition to the truth, and fixes prejudices, which the labours of their best and wisest friends, are never after able to remove. What happy influ∣ence then may we expect from it, when wisely conducted on the principles of reason and revela∣tion?</P>
<P>THE influence of parental education is evident in the history of all nations.—Principles and manners have descended from father to son, through suc∣cessive generations—in domestic and more exten∣ded life—in laws, politics and religion. We shall be established in this truth, by attending to the past and present habits of our own country. In how many respects are those of the present gene∣ration, in business, policy and religion, to be tra∣ced back to our ancestors through several ages? And this notwithstanding our singular convulsions and important revolution in government, so strong∣ly tending to a similar revolution in our habits and customs.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="024381_0024_0FC639A702A34B00"/>THE truth will receive confirmation, even, from ourselves and the place in which we live; as in all other things, so in particular in regard to the promotion of order, and the interests of re∣ligion. Who are the men, of the present age, among us, whose labours and example, maintain the peace and good order of society, the observa∣tion of the Lord's day, and the public institutions of religion? Are they not the descendents of those venerable ancestors who taught these things diligently to their children, and who added the pious efficacy of their examples and their prayers? and who are the people among us, that are a dead weight on society?—opposers of order, and who openly trample on the institutions of reli∣gion? and who are rarely to be seen in this house of prayer? Are they not generally, the descend∣ents of progenitors like themselves, whose fatal examples have fixed their posterity in the path of ruin? For though instances might be named of apostates, from the good principles and examples of their ancestors, they are comparatively few, and in most cases may be accounted for, from dangerous connections, in childhood, youth, or ri∣per years. And how few, whose unhappy lot hath been the reverse of a wise and virtuous education, have ever emerged from that degraded condition of the mind, and become useful in society; the supporters of good order and religion?</P>
<P>REFLECTIONS like these, must have often occur∣ed to observers of human nature, either in the history of other ages and countries, or in attention to their own. And they must have made deep im∣pressions of the great importance of a virtuous and well directed education.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="024381_0025_0FC639AC11685068"/>SUCH views, we are led to suppose, have influ∣enced the wise and good in all ages, in the educa∣tion of their children. Was it not the belief of truths like these, which induced Abraham to "com∣mand his children and houshold after him, that they might keep the way of the Lord<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii. 19.</NOTE>?—and Jo∣shua to resolve that "as for him and his house they would serve the Lord<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Joshua xxiv, 15.</NOTE>?—What brought the aw∣ful judgments of God on Eli and his house, but the neglect of this important duty? when "his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1st Samuel ii. iii. &amp; iv. chapters.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>DAVID, the man after God's heart, closed his life with an address, of this import, to the princes of Israel, and to his son.—"Now keep and seek ye all the commandments of the Lord your God, that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you, forever."—"And thou Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind. For the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off forever<NOTE N="{reversed ¶}" PLACE="foot">1st Chron. xviii. 1, 9. See also 1st Kings, ii. 1—4.</NOTE>."—Job, whose singular piety is much celebrated in holy scripture, has the honorable testimony, that he "sanctified his sons, and continually offered burnt offerings ac∣cording to the number of them all<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Job i. 5.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>THUS in the remotest ages, as well as in later times, good men have esteemed the religious edu∣cation
<PB N="28" REF="024381_0026_0FC639ADC3D6BA20"/>
of their children and posterity, as an object of the first importance; and they have possessed "no greater joy, than to learn that their children walk in the truth." In this they have ever been agreed, from such views as have been mentioned, of which it is not the least that the education of the present generation, may be justly expected to have a happy influence on many which shall suc∣ceed.</P>
<P>WITH the utmost propriety, did the pious psalm∣ist remind us of the divine institution by Moses on this subject. "That the generation to come might know his statutes; even the children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children; that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments."</P>

<P>MANY are the serious and weighty reflections furnished by this subject, and they will readily oc∣cur to the considerate mind. But "the impor∣tance of the rising generation," and the awful and endearing motives to fidelity in parents and chil∣dren, are among the first.—To these we shall at∣tend in the following addresses.</P>
<P N="1">I. To the parents of the congregation. Those of you who are advanced in life, will remember that thirty years have now passed away since our first interview in this place of worship! Thirty years are usually accounted the life of a minister. I am not insensible that my life and ministry have been attended with many imperfections, for which I have cause for deep humiliation. But I am not
<PB N="29" REF="024381_0027_0FC639B023E82B50"/>
conscious of designedly shunning to declare all the counsel of God, or of keeping back any thing which was profitable to you.—"I have not sought yours but you."—Sensible that the best part of my days is already past, and that the time of my departure is at hand, I would wish to be pure from the blood of all men, and especially of the people of my charge, and to be ready to give up the account of my stewardship. I am not only concerned for an admission to the joys of the redeemed for myself; but, am earnestly desirous, that you, and your children, may also be partakers. This has been a leading object, of my labours among you, from the first of my ministry. Many of you who are now advanced in life, were the youth of the congregation, at the time of my settlement. "The fathers, where are they?" The venerable ancestors of t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> people, are no more on earth. The pastor with his flock, who founded this society are long since, removed to the world of spirits.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>The church of Christ in the north society in Preston, was for∣med on the thirtieth of November, 1720, at which time the Rev'd Hezekiah Lord, was ordained to the pastoral office there, by prayer and the imposition of the hands of

Those, who were the principal actors in my set∣tlement, are either silent in death, or strug∣gling with the latest calamities of declining life. Many of them acted their part well, and their ever dear and honoured names are "like preci∣ous ointment" to posterity. Much is the debt of gratitude from their children. You have now succeeded to their place—to discharge that debt, you must fill it up usefully. On this condition, they will not be ashamed to own you, as their children, hereafter. That you may thus do, and be blessed, suffer the word of exhortation from him who "lives if ye stand fast in the Lord."</P>
<P>YOU will seriously consider, that the interests of this people and of future generations are de∣volved on you, and that you are to give account to God for the important betrustment. That you may do it with joy, be pleased to remember and practise the following particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="024381_0029_0FC639B302DE3CD8"/><HI>First of all,</HI> "Acquaint yourselves with God and be at peace with him." To this you are invited, not only by all the motives which re∣spect yourselves, but also on account of your children and posterity: for what reasonable hope can be indulged of fidelity, in the education of your children, if you are not faithful to your∣selves?</P>
<P>LET it be your first care then, to have just views of the religion of the bible, and reduce it to practice. True religion as exhibited in the scriptures, and existing in good men, is a beau∣tiful and consistent whole; consisting of various parts, harmoniously uniting, and mutually illus∣trating each other. It is doctrinal, experiment∣al, and practical, and in each of these, the con∣nection and dependence, of the parts, on each other, add strength, consistence and beauty to the whole, and prove it to be every way wor∣thy of God, and suitable to man. Let this di∣vine religion be exemplified in your profession and your lives.</P>
<P>NEXT to your duty, as individuals, I would intreat you to do honour to christianity, as hus∣bands and wives. This will be effected, by living in that conjugal harmony, for which there is every inducement, from personal and domest∣ic felicity—from the interests of posterity—from this world and the world to come. Then you will "dwell together according to knowledge, and as fellow heirs of the grace of life, and your prayers will not be hindered."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Peter iii. 7.</NOTE> In this way, you may be like that excellent pair, of whom
<PB N="32" REF="024381_0030_0FC639BA74425F48"/>
we have this honourable testimony, "that they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 6.</NOTE> Many are the branches of genu∣ine christianity, or ways of exemplifying its ex∣cellent nature—they are correspondent to all our relations to God, and to our fellow-creatures, to society on earth, to this world and the world to come. A right apprehension, of its leading principles, will be abundantly useful in directing your judgment, and influencing your practice at all times, and in all conditions.</P>
<P>OUR particular attention is now called to that only, which is the subject of this discourse; The education of posterity.</P>
<P>MAY I not say, in your behalf and my own, that "we have no greater joy than to hear that our children walk in the truth." To parents, as members of society, and as christians; their edu∣cation is a leading object. We have received God's testimonies from our parents, let us com∣mit them to our children. We are especially called to this, on account of their dangerous state, from the circumstances of the age in which they live. For though we should not "inquire wisely in asking why the former days were better than these,"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ecclesiastes vii. 10.</NOTE> as human nature and the world, are substantially, the same in all ages; there are, however, occasional differences, important to be regarded in the education of youth. You are not insensible, that the present age has the marks of degeneracy in several particulars, which in∣fluence the manners of the people, the order of
<PB N="33" REF="024381_0031_0FC639BFA8F3F688"/>
society, and the interests of religion. The wor∣ship of God, in families, and in public, and the religious observation of the Lord's Day, were ge∣nerally practised by our fathers, and with great de∣cency. But what a sad reverse has taken place in our day! Numbers, it is to be feared, are not well grounded in the first principles of christianity, and are in a condition to become an early prey to se∣ducers, who would betray them into false religi∣ons, or even to none.</P>
<P>THIS may, no doubt be traced to several influ∣encing causes.—But may we not conclude, that one of the greatest, is the criminal neglect of ma∣ny parents in the education of their children, and their own bad examples? The children of such fa∣milies have an unhappy influence on those who are better taught, and the contagion of vice and irre∣ligion is widely extended; for "man is born like the wild asses colt<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Job xi. 12.</NOTE>," and human nature tends to evil.</P>
<P>THIS calamitous event of our day, adds a new and important motive to all that have been named, for parental fidelity in the education of children. Their danger is uncommonly great, and we are at least, in part accountable for it.—How highly doth it concern us, to improve the remainder of our life, faithfully, for the good of our children. We wish they may grow up to be useful and happy in family connections, to be good members of socie∣ty, to serve their generation, to honor their Ma∣ker and Redeemer, transmit to their children the principles of virtue and piety, and be prepared for heaven.—That none of these important objects
<PB N="34" REF="024381_0032_0FC639C21CCC1DB8"/>
may be lost through our neglect, we should "bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord;" that they may know and practice God's testimonies, "and arise and declare them to their children; that they may set their hope in God, and not forget his works, but keep his command∣ments. Let these things be in our hearts, that we may teach them diligently to our children; and talk of them when we set in our houses, and when we walk by the way, and when we lie down, and when we rise up." Our instructions must be adapted to their age, capacities, and other cir∣cumstances. They must be supported by the ex∣ertions of parental authority and love; but above all <HI>by our examples and prayers.</HI> We must devote them to God from their earliest infancy, and per∣petuate the dedication by prayer, as long as we live, that the God of our pious progenitors may be their God; and we must be in all respects, as far as possible, what we would wish them to be. We must walk before them in the path of wis∣dom, which leads to usefulness and felicity on earth, and to glory in Heaven.—Among the ma∣ny inducements to this, it will be useful to recol∣lect the instructions and example of our pious fa∣thers; these must, in some instances at least, be fresh in our minds. Such recollections must ex∣ceedingly soften the heart, and the impressions of these truths will be proportionably deep. What child or parent ever read the following address of the wise man to his children, without the tender∣est emotions? "Hear ye children the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> give you good doctrines, forsake you not
<PB N="35" REF="024381_0033_0FC639C3830EEDB0"/>
my law. <HI>For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. He taught me also and said unto me—Let thine heart retain my words, keep my commandments, and live.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE happy influence of such parental education, was early displayed in his choice of wisdom, in preference to riches and long life<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, iii. 1—14.</NOTE>. And he faith∣fully transmitted it to posterity, in the book of proverbs, addressed to his children. It remains, that, in our respective conditions, we go and do likewise.—The remainder of our time, for paren∣tal exertions, is short; many of you like me, are in the advance of life—we shall soon be silent in death.—What we do for our children and poste∣rity, must be speedily accomplished.—The leading motives to fidelity and vigor, in this honorable service have been already considered.—You will recollect them.—Let me hope they will ever be present to your thoughts, and influence your practice; that if our separation should be near, and I should never more address you on this sub∣ject, I may die, with the joyful prospect of your fidelity and success;—that he who sowed, and they who reap, may rejoice together.</P>
<P N="2">II. To the children and youth.</P>
<P>A FEW words will comprise the substance of what I would wish to be impressed on your hearts. I have little to offer which can be called new; but it is not less weighty and interesting for being old. The text and subject are not more impor∣tant to your parents, than to you. If their obli∣gations and motives, respecting your education, are such as have been named, yours are propor∣tionable
<PB N="36" REF="024381_0034_0FC639C5C38FB670"/>
to receive their instructions, and reduce them to practice. It is for your sakes, and be∣cause your interest is so deeply involved, that they are thus obliged. On this depends your felicity and usefulness in this and the future life.</P>
<P>THE price in your hand to get wisdom is ex∣ceedingly precious; but its continuance is uncer∣tain, and at best it is short.—If you follow the dic∣tates of a virtuous and truly good education, you will be useful and happy on earth, and blessed in heaven—God will be your friend and protector here, and your portion forever. But if you des∣pise the instructions of parental piety, it is at your peril; you will be marked for wretchedness and reproach on earth, and for aggravated mi∣sery in hell. And you will "mourn at the last, and say, how have we hated instruction, and our hearts despised reproof? And have not obeyed the voice of our teachers, nor inclined our ear to them that instructed us<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Proverbs v. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>."—That this may not be your awful doom, <HI>Remember</HI> that you are the creatures of God—born for immortality—ruined by sin, and must partake of the gospel salvation, or be ruined forever.—Your continu∣ance on earth at most will be short, much shorter than you can, now, readily conceive. The flight of time, is exceedingly rapid. How soon have the last thirty years passed away? and are forever gone!—what changes have these thirty years produced?—those who were then the pa∣rents of the congregation are generally gone—we have succeeded in their place, and you in ours.—More than five hundred, of all ages, have
<PB N="37" REF="024381_0035_0FC639C837EDDF00"/>
died in the society; nearly an equal number of children, at present constitute our schools; as appears from the late visitation<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Thirteen schools are annually maintained in the society, du∣ring the winter; which are visited at the close of the season, by the pastor, in company with the civil authority and select-men, to inspect their manners and inprovement in learning; and their knowledge in the assemblies' catechism; and to give them instruc∣tions adapted to their age and capacity, on the nature and im∣portance of early virtue and piety.</NOTE> They will soon fill your place—you ours, and we shall be gathered to our fathers. The following thirty years will probably be marked with changes as numerous and affecting as those which are past. Should you live during those thirty future years, which is much to be doubted, they will be but "a vapour which appears for a little season, and then vanisheth away."</P>
<P>I GIVE you my best wishes for time and eternity, with the following short directions: "Remember now your creator in the days of your youth, be∣fore the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when you shall say you have no pleasure in them." "Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man: For God shall bring e∣very work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ecclesiastes xii. 1, and 13, 14.</NOTE>."—Give ear to good instruction from your parents and others—pray for a blessing—study your bibles, especially the book of Proverbs, particularly a∣dapted for the benefit of youth—watch and pray against temptations, and the destructive influence of bad example—strive to be wise and good—a blessing to your parents, connections and society—to be useful to yourselves and others, and in rea∣diness for death and heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="024381_0036_0FC639CA97280250"/>LET me recommend to your imitation the exam∣ple of young Joseph, who rejected the allurements of guilt, with this excellent reflection, "How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxix. 9.</NOTE>?"—and that of the pious Timothy, who attended to the religious instructions of a faithful parent, and, "from childhood knew the holy scriptures, which were able to make him wise to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">2 Timothy i. v. &amp; iii. 15.</NOTE>;" and whose future charac∣ter marks the value of a virtuous education wisely improved.</P>
<P>FINALLY, and above all, remember and imitate the example of the blessed Jesus, who at the age of twelve years, engaged the attention, and exci∣ted the astonishment of his most learned instruc∣tors, at his understanding and answers, "and still was subject to his parents; and as he advanced in age and stature, increased in wisdom, and in favor with God and with man<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 46—52.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>MAY you live, and be wise, useful and happy, to a good old age—many years after your parents and minister shall be gone to their fathers—May you faithfully transmit to the children of the com∣ing age, the pure religion of the blessed Jesus—May it be perpetuated in this place, through all generations till his second coming—May we meet in heaven, with each other, with our pious ances∣tors—the children of future ages, and with all the redeemed, and be to the praise of divine grace forever. AMEN.</P>
