<P>IN July last, the following letter was transmitted to the person to whom it is ad∣dressed, and a few weeks ago it was retur∣ned under cover, without a syllable in reply. As children that are crammed with confec∣tionary, have no relish for plain and whole∣some food; so men in power, who are sel∣dom addressed but in the sweet tones of adu∣lation, are apt to be disgusted with the plain and salutary language of truth. To offend was not the intention of the writer: yet the President has evidently been irritated; this however, is not a bad symptom, for irritation causelessly excited, will frequently subside into shame, and to use the language of the moral∣ist, "Where there is yet shame, there may in time be virtue—."</P>

<HEAD>EXPOSTULATORY LETTER TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>IT will generally be admitted, Sir, and perhaps with justice, that the great family of mankind were never more benefited by the military abilities of any individual than by those which you dis∣played during the memorable Ameri∣can contest. Your country was injured, your services were called for, you im∣mediately arose and after performing the most conspicuous part in that blood∣stained tragedy, you again became a private citizen, and unambitiously reti∣red to your farm — I here was more of true greatness in this procedure, than the modern world, at least, had ever beheld; and while public virtue is ve∣nerated by your country-men, a con∣duct so exalted, will not be forgotten.—The effects which your revolution
<PB N="4" REF="032785_0004_0FF564D4E4A59398"/>
will have upon the world are incalcula∣ble. By the flame which you have kindled, every oppressed nation will be enabled to perceive its fetters; and when man once knows that he is en∣slaved, the business of emancipation is half performed—France has already burst her shackles, neighboring nations will in time prepare, and another half century may behold the present besot∣ted Europe, without a Peer, without a Hierarchy, and without a Despot. If men were enlightened, revolutions would be bloodless; but how are men to be enlightened, when it is the interest of governors to keep the governed in ignorance? "To enlighten men," says your old correspondent, Arthur Young "is to make them bad subjects." Hur∣ricanes spread devastation: yet hurri∣canes are not only transient, but gives salubrity to the torrid regions, and are quickly followed by azure skies, and calm sunshine. Revolutions too, for a time, may produce turbulence; yet revolutions clear the political atmos∣phere and contribute greatly to the comfort and happiness of the human
<PB N="5" REF="032785_0005_0FF564D66D6667F0"/>
race. What you yourself have lived to witness in the United States is suffi∣cient to elucidate my position. In your rides along the banks of your fa∣vorite Potowmack, in your frequent ex∣cursions through your own extensive grounds, how gratifying must be your sensation on beholding the animated scenery around you, and how pleasura∣ble must be your feelings, on reflecting that your country is now an asylum for mankind; that her commerce, her agriculture, and her population are greater than at any former period, and that this prosperity is the natural re∣sult of those rights which you defend∣ed against an abandoned cabinet, with all that ability which men, who un∣sheath the sword in the cause of hu∣man nature will, I trust, ever display. Where liberty is, there man walks e∣rect and puts forth all his powers; while slavery, like a torpedo, benumbs the finest energies of his soul.</P>
<P>But it is not to the commander in chief of the American forces, nor to the President of the United States, that I have aught to address; my business
<PB N="6" REF="032785_0006_0FF564DFEC3FE180"/>
is with George Washington, of Mount Vernon, in Virginia, a man who, not∣withstanding his hatred of oppression and his ardent love of liberty, holds at this moment hundreds of his fellow be∣ings in a state of abject bondage.—Yes! you, who conquered under the banners of freedom—you, who are now the first magistrate of a free people, are, (strange to relate) a slave-holder. That a Liverpool merchant should endeavor to enrich himself by such a business is not a matter of surprise, but that you, an enlightened character, strongly ena∣mored of your own freedom; you who, if the British forces had succeeded in the Eastern states, would have retired with a few congenial spirits to the rude fast∣nesses of the Western wilderness, there to have enjoyed that blessing, without which a paradise would be disgusting, and with which the most savage regi∣on is not without its charms; that you, I say, should continue to be a slave hol∣der, a proprietor of human flesh and blood, creates in many of your British friends both astonishment and regret.</P>
<P>You are a Republican, and an advo∣cate
<PB N="7" REF="032785_0007_0FF564E178094E70"/>
for the dissemination of knowledge and for universal justice—where then are the arguments by which this shame∣less dereliction of principle can be sup∣ported? Your friend Jefferson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Besides those of color, figure and hair, there are other phy∣sical distinctions, proving a difference of race. They have less hair on their face and body. They secrete less by the kidneys, and more by the glands of the skin, which gives them a very strong disagreeable odor. This greater degree of transpiration renders them more tolerent of heat, and less so of cold, than the whites. Perhaps too a difference of structure in the pul∣monary aparatus, which a late ingenious experimentelist<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Crawford, Stockdale, London.</NOTE> has discovered to be the principal regulator of animal heat, may have disabled them from extricating, in the act of inspiration, so much of that fluid from the outer air, or obliged them in ex∣piration, to part with more of it. They seem to require less sleep. A black, after hard labor through the day, will be in∣duced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight, or later, tho' knowing he must be out by the first dawn of the morning. They are at least as brave, and more adventure∣some. But this perhaps may proceed from a want of fore∣thought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present. When present, they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness than the whites. They are more ardent after their females; but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sen∣sation. Their griefs are transient. Those numberless af∣flictions, which render it doubtful whether Heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner for∣gotten with them. In general, their existence appears to par∣ticipate more of sensation than reflection. To this must be as∣cribed their disposition to sleep, when abstracted from their diver∣sions, and unemployed in labor. An animal whose body is at rest, and who does not reflect, must be disposed to sleep of course. Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason and ima∣gination it appears to me, that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Eucl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous.</P>

to shew that the negroes are an inferior order of being; but surely you will not have recourse to such a subterfuge. Your slaves, it may be urged, are well treated—That I deny. Man never can be well treated who is deprived of his rights. They are well cloathed, well fed, well lodged, &amp;c. Feed me with ambrosia, and wash it down with nectar, yet, what are these, if liberty be wanting? You took arms in defence of the Rights of Man—Your negroes are men—Where then are the rights of your negroes,? They have been innured to slavery, and are not fit for freedom. Thus it was said of the French; but where is the man of unbiassed common sense who will assert that the French Republicans of the pre∣sent day, are not fit for freedom? It has been said too by your apologists, that your feelings are inimical to sla∣very, and that you are induced to ac∣quiesce in it at present merely from motives of policy; the only true policy is jus∣tice, and he who regards the con∣sequences of an act rather than the jus∣tice

of it, gives no very exalted proof of the greatness of his character.</P>
<P>But if your feelings be actually re∣pugnant to slavery, then are you more culpable than the callous hearted plan∣ter, who laughs at what he calls the pi∣tiful whining of the Abolitionists, be∣cause he believes slavery to be justifia∣ble, while you persevere in a system which your conscience tells you to be wrong. If we call the man obdurate who cannot perceive the attrociousness of slavery, what epithets does he de∣serve who, while he does perceive its at∣trociousness, continues to be a proprie∣tor of slaves. Nor is it likely that your own unfortunate negroes are the only sufferers by your adhereing to this ne∣farious business; consider the force of an example like yours, consider how∣many of the sable race may now be pi∣ning in bondage merely forsooth, be∣cause the President of the United States, who has the character of a wise and good man, does not see cause to discontinue the long established prac∣tice. Of all the slave holders under Heaven, those of the United States
<PB N="10" REF="032785_0010_0FF564EECE0C9A78"/>
appear to me the most reprehensible; for man never is so truly odious as when he inflicts upon others that which he himself abominates. When the cup of slavery was presented to your coun∣trymen, they rejected it with dis∣dain, and appealed to the world in justification of their conduct; yet, such is the inconsistency of man, that thou∣sands upon thousands of those very people, with yourself amongst the num∣ber, are now sedulously employed in holding the self-same bitter draught to the lips of their sable brethren. From men who are strongly attached to their own rights, and who have suffered much in their defence, one might have expected a scrupulous attention to the rights of others; did not experience shew, that when we ourselves are op∣pressed, we perceive it with a Lynx's eye; but when we become the op∣pressors, no noon-tide bats are blinder. Prosperity perhaps may make nations as well as individuals forget the distres∣ses of other times; yet surely the ci∣tizens of America cannot so soon have forgotten the variety and extent of
<PB N="11" REF="032785_0011_0FF564F061F567B8"/>
their own sufferings. When your country lay bruised by the iron hand of despotism, and you were compelled to retreat through the Jerseys with a handful of half naked followers; when the bayonet of the mercenary glistened at your back, and liberty seemed about to expire, when your farms were laid waste, your towns reduced to ashes, and your plains and woods were strew∣ed with the mangled bodies of your brave defenders; when these events were taking place, every breast could feel, and every tongue could execrate the sanguinary proceedings of Britain; yet what the British were at that period; you are in a great degree at this—you are boastful of your own rights—you are violators of the rights of others, and you are stimulated by an insatiable ra∣pacity, to a cruel and relentless op∣pression. If the wrongs which you now inflict be not so severe as those which were inflicted upon you, it is not because you are less inhuman than the British, but because the unhappy ob∣jects of your tyranny have not the power of resistance. In defending your
<PB N="12" REF="032785_0012_0FF564F1EB90A620"/>
own liberties you undoubtedly suffered much; yet if your negroes, emulating the spirited example of their masters, were to throw off the galling yoke, &amp; retiring peaceably to some uninhabited part of the western region, were to re∣solve on liberty or death, what would be the conduct of the southern planters on such an occasion? Nay, what would be your conduct? You who were <Q>born in a land of liberty,</Q> who, <Q>early learned its value,</Q> you, who <Q>en∣gaged in a perilous conflict to defend it,</Q> you who, <Q>in a word, devoted the best years of your life to secure its permanent establishment in your own country, and whose anxious re∣collection, whose sympathetic feelings and whose best wishes are irresistibly excited, whensoever in any coun∣try you see an oppressed nation unfurl the banners of freedom.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the answer of the president of the United States to the address of minister, plenipotentiary of the French Republic, on his presenting the colors of France to the United States.</NOTE>Possessed of these energetic sentiments, what would be your conduct? Would you have the virtue to applaud so just
<PB N="13" REF="032785_0013_0FF564F375B052E0"/>
and animating a movement as the revolt of your southern negroes!</P>
<P>No! I fear both you and your coun∣trymen would rather imitate the cold blooded British cabinet, and, to gratify your own fordid views would scatter among an unoffending people, terror, desolation and death. Harsh as this conclusion may appear, yet it is war∣ranted by your present practice; for the man who can boast of his own rights, and yet holds two or three hun∣dred of his fellow beings in slavery, would not hesitate in case of a revolt to employ the most sanguinary means in his power, rather than forego that which the <HI>truly</HI> republican laws of his country are <HI>pleased</HI> to call his property. Shame! Shame! That man should be deemed the property of man, or that the name of WASHINGTON should be found a∣mong the list of such proprietors!</P>
<P>Should these strictures be deemed se∣vere or unmerited on your part, how comes it that while in the northern and middle states, the exertions of the virtu∣ous Quakers &amp; all other philanthropists, have produced such regulations as must
<PB N="14" REF="032785_0014_0FF564FFD02B82D8"/>
speedily eradicate every trace of slave∣ry in that quarter; how comes it, that from you these humane efforts have ne∣ver received the least countenance? If your mind has not sufficient firmness to do away that which is wrong the mo∣ment you perceive it to be such, one might have expected, that a plan for ameliorating the evil would have met with your warmest support; but no such thing. The just example of a ma∣jority of the State has made no visi∣ble effect upon you; and as to the men of Maryland, of Virginia, of the two Carolinas, of Georgia, and of Kentuc∣ky, they smile contemptuously at the idea of negro emancipation, and, with the State Constitution in one hand, and the cow-skin in the other exhibit to the world such a spectacle, as every real friend to liberty must from his soul a∣bominate.</P>
<Q><L>Then what is man, and what man seeing this,</L>
<L>And having human feelings, does not blush</L>
<L>And hang his head to think himself a man.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="15" REF="032785_0015_0FF564FE48D75DE0"/>The hypocritical bawd who preaches chastity, yet lives by the violation of it, is not more truly disgusting, than one of your slave-holding gentry bellowing in favor of democracy. Man does not readily perceive defects in what he has been accustomed to venerate; hence it is that you have escaped those ani∣madversions which your slave proprie∣torship has so long merited. For sev∣en years you bravely fought the battles of your country, and contributed great∣ly to the establishment of her liberties; yet you are a slave-holder! You have been raised by your fellow-citizens to one of the most exalted situations upon earth, the first magistrate of a free peo∣ple; yet you are a slave-holder! A ma∣jority of your countrymen have recently discovered that slavery is unjust and are gradually abolishing the wrong, yet you continue to be a slave-holder! You are a firm believer too, and your letters and speeches are replete with pious re∣flections on the Divine Being, Provi∣dence, &amp;c. yet you are a slave-holder! Oh! Washington. 'Ages to come will read with astonishment' that the man
<PB N="16" REF="032785_0016_0FF565015A93B600"/>
who was foremost to wrench the rights of America from the tyrannical grasp of Britain, was amongst the last to re∣linquish his own oppressive hold of poor and unoffending negroes! In the name of justice, what can induce you thus to tarnish your own well earned celebrity and to impair the fair features of A∣merican liberty with so foul and indeli∣ble a blot? Avarice is said to be the vice of age. Your slaves, old and young, male and female, father, mother and child, might, in the estimation of a Vir∣ginian planter, be worth from fifteen to twenty thousand pounds. Now, sir, are you sure that the unwillingness which you have shewn to liberate your negroes, does not proceed from some lurking pecuniary consideration? If this be the case, and there are those who firmly believe it is, then there is no flesh left in your heart; and present reputa∣tion, future fame, and all that is estima∣ble among the virtuous, are, for a few thousand pieces of paltry yellow dirt,
irremedibly renounced.</P>
