<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE occasion on which the following Discourse was delivered, ought not to be deemed too inconsidera∣ble for any farther notice. The opening of an <HI>African Church,</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> and, perhaps, <HI>the first,</HI> is a remark∣able event in the progress of Christian knowledge. At the request, therefore, of the People expressly concern∣ed, and with the countenance of several most respecta∣ble characters, who wish well to them, the Author of this Discourse, assents now to its proceeding from the press. It was prepared in unavoidable haste, and un∣der such peculiar circumstances of failure of health at the time, that it could not have been undertaken at all, or even tolerably executed, when undertaken, had it not been for <HI>Dr. Rush</HI>'s distinguished attentions, and his most valuable hints, of which the Preacher was fortunate in availing himself.</P>
<P>The familiarity of the <HI>Stile,</HI> and plainness in the <HI>manner</HI> of address, it is to be presumed, require no apology.</P>

<P>O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everlast∣ing God; Creator, Preserver, and Governor of the Universe; regard, we beseech thee, the prayers and praises we this day offer unto thy divine Majesty, in the place which we are now assembled in, to dedicate unto thee. Dwell in this house, we pray thee; accept and sanctify it, as an holy Temple, devoted to thy service, and to the maintenance of thy true religion and virtue.</P>
<P>We know, O Lord, that thou dwellest not in Tem∣ples made with hands, so as to be circumscribed by them, as thou hast created the boundless expanse of Heaven
<PB REF="027259_0005_0FD3F32796816210"/>
for thy Throne, and the Earth out-stretched immense for thy Foot-stool; but, whose Glory neither the bound∣less expanse of Heaven, which is thy Throne—nor the Earth out-stretched immense, which is thy Foot-stool—nor even the Heaven of Heavens—are able to contain. Yet, though thy divine nature be thus unlimited, vouch∣safe, we beseech thee, to be more especially present in this Sanctuary, by thy grace and heavenly benediction; that, as often as two or three are gathered together <HI>here</HI> in thy name, thou mayest be in the midst of them, to hear and to fulfil their petitions: so that this house may be for ever sacred to the worship of thee the only true God; where the Gospel of thy blessed son, our saviour Jesus Christ, may be faithfully preached, and the Sacra∣ments of his institution rightly and duly administered—that Gospel, which is "the power of God unto salvation to as many as believe"—those holy Sacraments, which, being worthily received, are able to "nourish us unto eternal life."</P>
<P>And do thou, O merciful God, who before all Tem∣ples, preferest a pure and upright heart; enlighten, preserve, convert us. "May thy Priests," <HI>here</HI> mini∣stering before thee, "be clothed with righteousness, and may thy Saints," uttering their responses, "sing with joyfulness." Pour out upon the whole Congrega∣tion a spirit of Piety and universal Charity; of that Pi∣ety which is servent, yet humble—of that▪ "Charity, which is the very bond of perfectness, the end of the commandment, and which proceedeth out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith unfeigned." May they ever possess a lively remembrance of the mercy thou hast vouchsafed unto them, in being graciously plea∣sed to call them out of the darkness of Paganism, and the bondage of ignorance and error, into the clear light of Gospel Revelation, and "the glorious liberty of the children of God." May their understandings be ever∣more illuminated by that heavenly light, and may they ever "stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free." May they so diligently learn the precepts of thy blessed son, and so constantly follow his good example, that, having faithfully worshipped thee in thy church upon earth, they may, when the present period of their probation shall be accomplished, be admit∣ted to the general assembly and church of the first-born
<PB REF="027259_0006_0FD3F3298064E808"/>
in thy heavenly kingdom, where with Angels and Arch-angels, and all the innumerable Hosts of Heaven, they may laud and magnify thy glorious name, through the endless ages of eternity.</P>
<P>Hear us, O Lord, we humbly beseech thee, for the sake of thine only son Jesus Christ, our Mediator and Redeemer, to whom, with the Father and the holy Ghost, be all honor and glory, world without end. Amen.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH ix, 2.</BIBL>
<P>THE PEOPLE THAT WALKED IN DARKNESS HAVE SEEN A GREAT LIGHT.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS <HI>I passed by,</HI> soon after the walls of this Build∣ing were carried up,—<HI>and beheld</HI> the Marble on the Ea∣stern Front, <HI>inscribed</HI> with these words, my attention was exceedingly attracted by them; for I was struck with the propriety of such a <HI>choice.</HI> And, I know of none more suitable to direct our thoughts on the present interesting occasion. They relate to the Gentiles; and, this day, they have their accomplishment here.</P>
<P>Blessed God! who are these <HI>that gather themselves to∣gether?</HI> They <HI>come to thee!</HI> They <HI>come, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by light,</HI> and <HI>to the brightness of its rising. The sons of strangers do build up thy walls</HI>—Their children's children <HI>shall minister unto thee.—In thy wrath didst thou smite them, but in thy favour hast thou had mercy on them.</HI></P>
<P>The stile of holy Scripture is often figurative; and notices are taken from familiar objects, and circumstances generally known, in common life, in order to convey spiritual conceptions with the greater clearness, and to render their impression the stronger and more abiding. This is remarkably seen in the writings of the sublime Isaiah. We have an instance of it before us, in the Text,—where the words Darkness, and Light, which, literally, denote qualities universally understood, as they respect worldly things, are applied to certain qualities and conditions relative to spiritual things.</P>
<P>—"The people that walked in Darkness"—is the Prophet's expression;—"The people" who lived in
<PB N="10" REF="027259_0008_0FD3F32E2739DEC0"/>
blindness and error, <HI>have seen a great light,</HI>—the light of the truth—the light of the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>With some variation, how strongly is the same thought represented in the close of the verse—"they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined."—</P>
<P>—Yes; of all darkness, that of the Soul is most dark: and of all who wander—the wanderers from the path of life, are most forlorn, and to be pitied.—Of course, Divine illumination, the light from God, is, of all things, the most precious.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> are a people who have "walked in Darkness."</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> who walked in darkness, have been favoured with a change of that condition; you have been brought <HI>to see Light</HI>: And</P>
<P>That Light is a glorious one—a <HI>great</HI> Light.</P>
<P>From these considerations, do clearly flow certain Du∣ties, which eminently claim your observance.</P>
<P N="1">I. YOU are a People who "have walked in dark∣ness."</P>
<P N="1">1. In being brought up as Pagans, or Heathen, unac∣quainted with Divine Revelation, and the covenant of grace, <HI>in your own country.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is meant of the <HI>general</HI> state of the black people, or Africans.</NOTE></P>
<P>Your fathers, and some, perhaps, of you now present, did, near the shores of <HI>Senegal</HI> and <HI>Gambia,</HI> on this or the other ill-fated range, or coast, of <HI>Africa,</HI>—may be in <HI>Be∣nin, Congo</HI> or <HI>Angola,</HI>—ignorant of "God that made the world, and all things therein,"—bow down in adoration before stocks, stones, beasts, and the vilest creeping things,—pray to the hollow winds; or, dancing in wild circles, mutter to Devils;—or, in affrighted gaze, yell to the pale moon, to save you!—And it is known, that proportioned to the degrees of darkness, in the aforementioned respects,—especially the "gross dark∣ness" covering the people,—must, of course, be the corrupt state of their manners.</P>
<P N="2">2. You have "walked in darkness," as being slaves in <HI>this country</HI>—for slavery, and darkness, or ignorance, go hand in hand.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="027259_0009_0FD3F32E2BB95430"/>Can a poor African, dragged in fetters from his native land,—and here, driven and tormented under the lashes of cruelty, be any thing else than dark, dark! Can a people, kept back from knowledge, expressly for this reason—lest it should unfit them for being beasts of bur∣den,—<HI>can they</HI> be any other than dark?</P>
<P>To the credit of humanity, in <HI>this</HI> part of America, and several other parts, <HI>such treatment</HI> hath been held in abhorrence. It is unknown, except in narratives from abroad.</P>
<P>Still, at the very best, slavery is an hard allotment. It sinks the mind, no less than the body: it weakens its ca∣pacity: destroys all <HI>principle</HI>; corrupts its feelings; prevents it from either discerning, or choosing aright in any thing. Yes—and in the proportion that it exists any where, it has its effect in vitiating the general manners.</P>
<P>PENNSYLVANIA!—thou hast considered this: Thou hast mitigated its ills, in the first instance, and in the most proper manner which the evil would admit of, art pursu∣ing the plans for its entire abolition.</P>
<P N="3">3. You "have walked in darkness," as <HI>sinners.</HI> In this respect, all mankind are upon a footing—they all <HI>walk in darkness.</HI> The term is fitly chosen indeed, to express <HI>the state of man.</HI> He has lost sight of his chief end, and of the means to attain it. He mistakes his supreme good. He wanders in crooked paths. He exposes himself conti∣nually to dangers. He falls into innumerable vices and corruptions—and no wonder—for he walketh in darkness.</P>
<P>This darkness may be considered in a two-fold view,—as <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal.</HI> The <HI>external</HI> darkness includes that state of things in the world, which is opposed to the knowledge of God, and true religion; those circumstan∣ces severally, or taken together, which the <HI>evil one</HI> makes use of, as a medium, through which, to carry on his own foul business. It comprehends all those erroneous sys∣tems of religion which prevailed among the different na∣tions, before the appearing of the Messiah, Jesus Christ; and all the schemes or systems, whatever may be their names, that have been substituted for his religion, since.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027259_0010_0FD3F33049A34130"/>The <HI>internal</HI> darkness is seated in man's mind. It is an immoral disposition of the heart; a corrupt state of the affections. It is THE ENMITY AGAINST GOD, spoken of by St. Paul. It is that aching, wrathful abyss (if I may so express it) <HI>void and without form</HI>—till the spirit of God "moveth upon the face of it," and saith, "Let there be light."—</P>
<P>The depraved condition of the soul, being the dread∣ful effect of man's fall, you find set forth in holy scrip∣ture, by no expression so frequent, as that of "Darkness." And, what is very observable—this internal darkness al∣ways implies that extreme evil, <HI>Unbelief</HI>—a distrust in the Almighty, and his declarations: and, in relation to the redemption offered to the world—it is a refusal to ac∣cept thereof, or to comply with its gracious terms.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the next place, let us observe, agreeably to our text, that a "People that walked in darkness," <HI>external,</HI> and <HI>internal,</HI> "have seen a great light."— They have perceived by the eye of their understanding—they have discovered—they have become acquainted with, that which will guide them to liberty and happiness.</P>
<P>By this "great light," is meant the knowledge of true religion—the instruction contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ;—"the light of the glory of God in the face" of his beloved Son,—who is himself called "the light of men;" "the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." Verily, under the circumstances in which his world lay by reason of sin; and, in the expectations of deliverance through the grace and virtue of a messenger sent from GOD, who is <HI>the eternal essential light;</HI> there could not be a more pro∣per word summarily to characterize that divine messenger, than LIGHT. Well therefore, may the beautiful meta∣phor be used, as it often is, to designate or express <HI>his influence.</HI> This is called light, as opposed to darkness. It dispels darkness. It irradiates the external and inter∣nal hemisphere of the mind. It is that <HI>spiritual</HI> medium of sight, by which we <HI>see</HI> spiritually. It shows God to be what he is. Our altars need no more to have this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. It reveals his name, his nature, his perfections.—</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="027259_0011_0FD3F3321588C970"/>It shows man, as a creature, and a sinner. It shows him in a very different view from what he is disposed to consider himself, by the light of his own reason. It dis∣covers to him his littleness, his dependance on a superior, his depravity,—and withal, his utter inability to save himself. Particularly, does it open <HI>the way of salvation;</HI> setting forth, in a manner most comfortable, most easy to be understood by people of all capacities—high, or low,—that "God may be just, and yet the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus." It shows, that grace is the true spring of holiness: that divine pardon produces divine peace; and this peace to be inseparable from puri∣ty and virtue. It shows, moreover, all the social and re∣lative duties; and points out the connection of each of them with the glory of God, and with general and indi∣vidual happiness. Yes, my brethren,—and to complete the whole, it opens the divine abodes of existence in the world to come. It carries your hopes stedfast and sure, to the morning of that bright day, in the which, the re∣deemed ones shall put on immortality,—shall all meet one another, and meet the Lord;—when dignity and ex∣cellence that cannot now be uttered, shall be theirs for ever.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is called a <HI>great</HI> light. Let us enquire into the reasons of this epithet. It is <HI>great,</HI> both with respect to its <HI>object,</HI> its <HI>origin,</HI> and its <HI>circumstances.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Its object: Here indeed, there is not <HI>one</HI> only; but many: and in the like multiplied view, may the ori∣gin be contemplated, together with the other particu∣lars.</P>
<P>In regard to the first,—I shall try a moment to direct your attention to the principal of all—It is a <HI>great</HI> light, because it manifests to the world, the <HI>Great Being.</HI> The knowledge of God, or the religious im∣pression of an intelligent, almighty <HI>Cause</HI> of all things,—"the rewarder of them that diligently seek him," is as <HI>essential</HI> to human happiness, as the breath we draw, is now to human life. Man may exist without knowing God: but existence merely is not happiness. A sensibili∣ty on our part, of the relation we stand in to the infinite∣ly great and good Creator, and of the duty flowing from that relation,—it is this that gives man his dignified
<PB N="14" REF="027259_0012_0FD3F3337A1CBD50"/>
place in the arrangement of the universe. Yet, it is too certain, to be disputed, that such knowledge or sensibili∣ty might, through human degeneracy and weakness, in a great measure, or altogether become lost.—It actu∣ally did so—What was the state of the world, in this respect, before the revelation of gospel light? What hath been its state ever since, in places where that light has not reached? or in minds which refuse its friendly aid, under all the circumstances that appreciate and re∣commend it? One cannot give a more express, and at the same time, a more full answer to the above, than in these few scriptural words, "Having no hope, and <HI>without God.</HI>"—</P>
<P>The great light I am speaking of, immediately tends to the removing from human minds, that obscurity which covered them, with regard to that infinite Being. It is light that <HI>doth make manifest.</HI> And it is this <HI>great</HI> light that hath revealed or manifested God—not in <HI>the my∣steries of his nature;</HI> but, as far as by us, he may be known; a Being great and good,—in whom the most entire confidence may be reposed; a Being who ordereth and governeth universally, and in the most perfect man∣ner; a Being who is the standard of excellence; and who is still the compassionate benefactor of man though fallen; a Being who is reconciling the world unto him∣self; who is establishing an intercourse between earth and heaven; bestowing forgiveness through a Mediator; and opening all the springs of righteousness and consola∣tion. Here there arises in view</P>
<P>Another object of this light, enhancing its exalted na∣ture and qualities; I mean the great salvation by the gospel of Jesus Christ; a salvation from sin and death, in∣to holiness and life eternal: for, wherever its gracious influence is experienced—<HI>there</HI> peace is established; the dominion of satan is overturned, and a new domini∣on fixed in the soul—the reign of God; new principles are implanted—the principles of light and love; a new life communicated—the life of heaven.</P>
<P>This sketch must suffice at present—</P>
<P>Other particulars, numerous and important, might here be brought forward, as <HI>objects</HI> of the <HI>great light</HI> be∣fore us: but as the <HI>principal</HI> ones contemplated just now,
<PB N="15" REF="027259_0013_0FD3F335534A85B8"/>
do virtually include or refer to all the rest; I forthwith pass on</P>
<P N="2">2. To the greatness of this light, in respect of its <HI>ori∣gin</HI> or <HI>sources.</HI></P>
<P>It is <HI>great,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) Because it comes from the <HI>Great</HI> Being, "the Father of Lights," the Author and Creator of all things. He "who commanded light to shine out of darkness," <HI>in the beginning,</HI>—hath now "shined into our hearts, to give us" this light.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Because it was conveyed to the word, by the <HI>great</HI> Immanuel, the Son of God, "the brightness of the Fa∣ther's glory, and the express delineation of his person;" of whom it was predicted, that "he should be great."— It was conveyed by him, whose immense dignity, and divine attributes, attested and announced in the clear∣est manner, must give it value. It was conveyed by him, who was THE WORD, and in the beginning, "with God;" —"who hath a name above every name;" of whom it is said, as "the first begotten," "and let all the an∣gels of God worship him;" and "thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever"—upon whose shoulder is "the government," as Mediator—the WONDERFUL,—the <HI>Counsellor,</HI> the <HI>Mighty God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Mighty Lord, or Heir of all things—Lord over all.</NOTE>, the <HI>Everlasting Father</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Father of the perpetual <HI>age to come,</HI> the age of the Gospel.</NOTE>, the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI>—"able and willing to save unto the uttermost:" I repeat it,—This light, this "Wis∣dom, which is from above," conveyed by Him, must be <HI>great.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) It is <HI>great,</HI> because it is communicated by the agency of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> whose power is great to over∣come all resistances from earth and hell; whose office it is, to "reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment;"—the spirit who led the disciple Peter, to make the memorable confession which his Lord entitles THIS ROCK, "on which he will build his church,—and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it;"—the spirit,
<PB N="16" REF="027259_0014_0FD3F3369728D540"/>
through whose divine irradiations, the ancient prophets, and all the men of God from the beginning, saw, and foretold the several periods of the Messiah's kingdom;— its dawn, its commencement, its gradual unfolding, and the unutterable glory in which it is to issue;—the Spirit, whose guidance and inspiration were given in a manner still more extraordinary, unto the Apostles—leading them unto all truth: bringing to their remembrance all that their Master had taught them; enduing them with miraculous powers; accompanying their preaching with irresistible energy and demonstration; instructing them how to an∣swer and refute their adversaries; supporting them and their pious followers against the spirit and malice of the world; qualifying them severally to fulfil the great pur∣poses of the ministry; and abiding with all the faithful servants of Christ, ministers and people, to the end of the world: the Spirit who is the author at first, and the pro∣moter ever afterwards, of all saving impressions, graci∣ous influences, and heavenly virtues in the human mind; —the inspirer of the gifts of faith, of purity, of love, of consolation:—Through his agency and operation, is this <HI>light</HI> communicated.</P>
<P N="3">3. I said it is <HI>great,</HI> in relation to the circumstances ap∣pertaining to it: and this is the third head, with which the consideration of the greatness of this light, supplies me.</P>
<P N="1">(1) It is <HI>great,</HI> because it hath endured a great while —from the fall of man, to the present day. It is as old as the creation. With its early rays it comforted and refreshed the patriarchs. Increasing gradually, it was a guide to the prophets. From one age to another, down to the "fulness of the time," it taught the good and just, to "live by faith." It was reflected back in hope and consolation, from every type and ordinance of the law. It encircled every altar. It interpreted every sacrifice. It enabled the members of the church of God, to look through each emblem and shadow, to the sub∣stance. In a word,—it may be traced in a distinguishable stream, up to the beginning of time: it will extend down to the end of time; and it will shine more and more "un∣to the perfect day."</P>
<P N="2">(2.) It is <HI>great,</HI> because it shall illuminate the whole world. Yes, "from the rising of the sun, unto the go∣ing
<PB N="17" REF="027259_0015_0FD3F33802377588"/>
down of the same," it will cause the name of the Messiah to be "great among the heathen." In a more eminent degree than we can have any just conception of, at present,</P>
<P>"One tide of glory, one unclouded blaze"— shall cover the earth.—</P>
<P>Innumerable passages of Scripture prove the future universal prevalence of this light: meanwhile, the hap∣piest comparisons, and most expressive charming prospects are made use of often, to represent its excellency and increasing brightness.</P>
<P>I refer you, particularly to the Book of Psalms;— to the Prophets, Isaiah, Zechariah, and Malachi;— to the books of the holy Gospel, expressly so named;— to the epistles of St. Paul,—and the revelation of St. John: the substance of their report, is, That by the prevailing and expanding of this light, the "Dominion" of Christ, shall be from sea, even to sea; and from the rivers, even to the ends of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>: That every where, the walls of his church shall be called "salvation, and its gates praise<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. 60.</NOTE>:" That "in every place, incense shall be offered to his name, and a pure offering<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mal 1.</NOTE>:" That "the wilder∣nesses and solitary places shall be universally made glad; and the deserts shall blossom as the rose<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isa. 35.1.</NOTE>;—The mountains exult,—the vales be filled with melody;— the trees of every forest break forth into singing<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ch. 44.</NOTE>:— the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ch. 29. Ch. 35.</NOTE>:"—That "the fulness of the Gentiles shall come; for the same Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 11.</NOTE>;" That "the ransomed of the Lord, shall return, and come to Zion with Songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>;" That "a great multi∣tude"—countless by men; "of all nations, and kin∣dreds, and people, and tongues, shall stand before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. 7.</NOTE>."—</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="027259_0016_0FD3CDCFA0986410"/>(3.) Lastly, it is <HI>great,</HI> because, as it will shine on, with unceasing lustre, until the end of time; so it will shine hereafter, in the glory which it produces, throughout all eternity.</P>
<P>From the words thus opened and explained, there clearly arise certain duties, which you are expressly con∣cerned in. Allow me, with affectionate plainness to state and recommend them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first is, <HI>Gratitude to God,</HI> for having directed, in his own wise Providence, that you should come from a land of Pagan darkness, to a land of Gospel light; from a state, afterwards, of slavery, to a state of liberty; and now, from guilt and sinfulness, to this state of salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>As for those who brought you, or your fathers, from your own country,—one may say of them, with a little variation,—because of the different circumstances—as <HI>Joseph</HI> said to his brethren, "But as for you, ye thought evil against us; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive."</P>
<P>I am aware, that your condition, or cases severally, may differ a good deal, one from the other. I will spe∣cify an instance, and consider it with you, a moment; not losing sight of the gratitude just mentioned.—As the greater number of you are free; so, there may be others of you yet in bondage: these nevertheless, have received mercies enow to thank God for. His dispensati∣ons are unquestionably wise and proper. Whatever he permits, will turn to the real profit of such as do resign themselves to his good pleasure. Your present situation does not hinder you from being <HI>Christ</HI>'s freemen. Your present situation gives you some advantages above what others have: yes, and very possibly, above what your Masters have,—in that your humbleness of mind, your patience, faithfulness, and trust only in God, will add to the greatness of your future happiness.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next duty is <HI>gratitude</HI> to your <HI>earthly benefac∣tors,</HI> who planned your emancipation from slavery.</P>
<P>There are certain evils, which, when once they have obtained footing, and become <HI>epidemick,</HI> as it were, are scarcely seen as evils: no wonder then if they be slow and difficult to remove: so it hath been with slavery. A few humane, considerate persons, at an early period of our
<PB N="19" REF="027259_0017_0FD3F33AF9C39900"/>
settlement in this country,—yes, in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> particu∣larly, were moved by the Divine Spirit, to open <HI>light</HI> upon this darkness. Their Testimony was treated as visiona∣ry for a while; but, in time, it gained upon the judge∣ment and consciences of men.</P>
<P>Here, you will recollect the names of LAY, of WOOL∣MAN,—and above all, ANTHONY BENEZET;—whose labours were unwearied in your behalf; whose works of benevolence and love, have followed them to the regions of peace and blessedness beyond the grave.</P>
<P>There are also living characters not a few, in this city, and throughout the <HI>United States,</HI> heartily engaged in the same business of humanity. Behold, how intent they are to do your people good!</P>
<P>You owe much likewise, to those persons who planned schools for the instruction of your children. This in∣struction is as the <HI>door</HI> introducing the young people to the <HI>great light.</HI> Knowledge is the best foundation for in∣tegrity and usefulness: and it is the element and life of <HI>Freedom.</HI></P>
<P>You owe much to the "Pennsylvania Society for promo∣ting the abolition of slavery, and the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage." The memory of <HI>Franklin</HI> here rises before you. He was its President. With the like views in which it originated, may it persevere— till its work be completed.</P>
<P>But especially, do you owe a large debt of gratitude to the citizens of Philadelphia, who assisted you by dona∣tions and loans, in the building of this handsome, spaci∣ous, and very convenient church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dimensions—60 feet, by 40—height proportional.</NOTE>. You thought that to have an house of your own to assemble in for public worship, was, in consideration of your increased num∣bers, now desirable and expedient. In the same view have your patrons and friends regarded the matter, and countenanced your proceedings. And, as with brother∣ly kindness and complacency, they leave it to yourselves to fix upon, or adopt such system, order, and mode of worship as may be most agreeable to you; so have they found a perfect freedom in helping you to prepare a
<PB N="20" REF="027259_0018_0FD3F33C8E019628"/>
place, where that system, order, and mode may peace∣fully reside, and operate.</P>
<P>On the pleasing ground marked out above, I <HI>could</HI> go farther,—indulging <HI>your</HI> feelings,—and <HI>my own,</HI> by particularly mentioning some characters in this place, pre∣eminent for generous actions, wherever they have oppor∣tunity; and who truly have been so, with regard to you:—But we are restrained in that satisfaction. There is, however, what will be infinitely more acceptable to them; namely, to see that their acts of kindness <HI>do good.</HI></P>
<P>Most favourably assisted, the pious labour of your hands hath prospered thus far; and you are now happily assem∣bled, for the first time, within these walls;—<HI>we</HI> offer∣ing our congratulations; and cheerfully uniting with <HI>you</HI> to worship the God of All.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another duty, is compassionate love to your bre∣thren, who are yet in darkness, or bondage, in other parts of the world. Be tenderly affectioned towards their condition. Pray publicly, and privately, that "the Lord may hear your voice, and look upon their affliction, and their labour, and their oppression."—</P>
<P>O mighty God! Thou dost encourage us in this thing. For, notwithstanding the confusion of nations, and the corruption and madness of human passions;—there is some prospect that the general cause of justice and of freedom, and of peace on earth, will at last pre∣vail!</P>
<P N="4">4. Humility is the next duty.—Remember your former condition. Pride was not made for man, in any, even the highest stations in life; much less for persons who have just emerged from the lowest. It is said, there is a great deal of this among your people, already; and that it is increasing extremely fast. I wish this might be no more than a surmise: and then, that even the surmise itself might be dropped; for your friends meet with dis∣couragements on this head. Will you, my brethren, guard against pride? Will you reflect on the nature of the evil itself; the offences that come by it; and other unhappy consequences!</P>
<P>It was a custom among the Jews, as you find recorded by Moses, in the book of Deuteronomy, ch. 26.5—when the Priest received the <HI>Basket of first fruits</HI> from them;—
<PB N="21" REF="027259_0019_0FD3F340454503A8"/>
for each person to declare, in the house and presence of the Lord,—the history of the mean and wretched ori∣gin of his family: "A <HI>Syrian</HI> ready to perish, was my father."</P>
<P>In like manner, when you are tempted to cherish the least pride, in your freedom—in dress—in your favoura∣ble reception among your fellow-citizens,—and even in this <HI>stately building;</HI>—or in any of your civil, as well as re∣ligious privileges;—then check yourselves, by confessing privately and publicly, that "a slave ready to perish was my father:" Or, if all cannot say this; you may unite in expressions still more humbling, and say "A sinner—a fallen man—a rebel against God—an heir of wrath; and, until redeemed, a child of hell, <HI>was my father.</HI>"</P>
<P N="5">5. Circumspection in your conduct and intercourse with the world, is another duty that you are especially con∣cerned in. "See that ye walk circumspectly; not as fools, but as wife." Remember, that you have enemies, as well as friends; that you will be narrowly watched; and that less allowance will be made for your failings, than for those of other people. This circumspection will be the more necessary, as you have became a religious society.—</P>
<P>Peaceableness among yourselves, and with all men, is indispensable to a fair character; as also truth in your dealings, in your words, and in your inner man; diligence in providing things honest: temperance and sobriety; an obliging, friendly, meek conversation.—</P>
<P>Here a particular thought occurs to me, which is not to be suppressed: With regard to those of you who are <HI>not free,</HI>—you must not be cast down, nor discontented. It is a dispensation of Providence, as I hinted already, to which you should submit in quietness, for conscience sake: and in so doing, you shall certainly meet with good. I give you St. Paul's advice, adapted exactly to your situ∣ation▪ "Let as many servants as are under the yoke, count their own masters worthy of all honour; that the name of God, and his doctrine be not blasphemed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi.1.</NOTE>▪"</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="027259_0020_0FD3F34163815718"/>To proceed: You have built an house for the public worship of God; and this day, solemnly dedicated it un∣to him.—</P>
<P>O may the Lord our God accept of the dedication! Let him not leave this people, nor forsake them: "Hear thou in heaven, their prayers and their supplications, and maintain their cause!"</P>
<P>Come then ye people, highly favoured! Your house is <HI>Holiness unto the Lord!</HI> Let none who ever worship in it, dishonor it at any time, or in any way. You have here, in the most public manner named the name of Christ, and told us, You "have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him;"—depart then,—depart from all—yea, even from the shadow of iniquity.</P>
<P>It is not a small matter, to have even heard of the true God. It is still a greater to have been taught his pure religion: But, together with the above,—for <HI>you</HI> to be encouraged, in the course of events, to build a temple to that God, wherein his name may be adored,—this is indeed <HI>an honour</HI> bestowed upon you. Here then, be assured,—is a period in your progress and profession, which will prove very remarkable: For, according as your con∣duct henceforth, turns out well or ill; your example will be a praise in the view of all around you,—or a reproach. Yes, this very house—or rather, the conversation of those belonging to it, "is set for the fall, or rising again of many"—of the people <HI>of your colour.</HI> On the right improvement of your present advantages, depends, per∣haps, the fate of your brethren in bondage, in every part of the world. Strengthen the hands of your friends every where by your pure and unexceptionable conduct. This will be to "let your light shine," in favour of the multitudes yet covered with darkness. This will be en∣couraging the deliverance of those who are bound.</P>
<P>A contrary behaviour will certainly increase their dark∣ness, and tend only to rivet still closer their chains. It may render the yet existing reproach of our country per∣petual.</P>
<P>To conclude;—Strive to escape from the darkness of sin. O let it not be "your condemnation, that light is come into the world, and that you have chosen dark∣ness rather than light, because your deeds are evil."
<PB N="23" REF="027259_0021_0FD3F34343C6B878"/>
With your own eyes, behold the <HI>great light</HI> that has been described; and walk ye in it. Prize beyond all things the instructive, renovating grace of the gospel. Reflect on the considerations now offered for that purpose. At∣tend, I beseech you, to the admonitions of your own consciences; to the calls of Providence; to the word of the Lord; to the teachings of the Divine Spirit; to the terrors of neglecting so great a salvation; to the hopes, and the joys of obtaining it;—to the sure prospects of glory, honour, and immortality in the life to come.</P>
<P>Thus have we asked, O great God! for the counsel, and light, and Blessing which we need. Thus have we opened these doors, for thy sacred worship, and to thine honour. Thus, with thy permission, have I spoken to this people, whom we take by the hand as <HI>Brethren</HI> in Christ Jesus.—Who can doubt, but thou wilt, look down from Heaven, and cast upon us the bright beams of thy mercy!</P>
<P>MY RESPECTED AUDIENCE,</P>
<P>What if now, before we part, some free-will offering should be made, in favour of this dedicated house— Prayers never come up more acceptably before God, for a memorial, than when united with alms: And I am in∣clined to believe, that there are very few occasions, if any, on which such an union could, with more propriety than the present, take place.</P>
<P>Under some difficulties, though highly favoured,— after considerable delay, and apprehensions, at times, of much greater;—it hath pleased Providence to permit this goodly building to be brought on to its present state. There is more must be done to it yet, you see, ere it will be quite safe and convenient to assemble in: and very pro∣bably, notwithstanding the economy of the managers or trustees, a share of the past account, is yet unpaid.</P>
<P>The people of the congregation may by easy contribu∣tions from time to time, help themselves in this laudable business. Yes: and it may be reasonably expected, that each of you now present,—I speak to those of the con∣gregation—will, this day, give something for that purpose. And, for your encouragement, these respecta∣ble
<PB N="24" REF="027259_0022_0FD3F344C72548E0"/>
citizens, a number of your benefactors,—your Fellow-Christians also—will cheerfully go on to en∣courage and assist you.</P>
<P>Will <HI>you</HI> then—(I address myself to such benefac∣tors) will you allow me to solicit a present contribution, in the generous view intimated above! and then—we shall depart with satisfaction.</P>
<P>To press this matter much, is totally unnecessary: For, it has ever appeared to me a trait in the <HI>Philadel∣phia</HI> character, that the citizens looked not for <HI>pressing solicitations</HI> to do beneficent actions; but for <HI>opportunities.</HI> "And God is not unrighteous, that he will forget your works, and labour that proceedeth of love."</P>
