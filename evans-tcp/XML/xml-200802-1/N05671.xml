<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the End of the Year 1750, some Persons, who had frequent Opportunities of observing the Distress of such distemper'd Poor as from Time to Time came to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> for the Advice and Assistance of the Physicians and Surgeons of that City; how difficult it was for them to procure suitable Lodgings, and other Conveniences proper for their respective Cases, and how expensive the Providing good and careful Nurses, and other Attendants, for want whereof, many must suffer greatly, and some probably perish, that might otherwise have been restored to Health and Comfort, and become useful to them∣selves, their Families, and the Publick, for many Years after; and considering more∣over, that even the poor Inhabitants of this City, tho' they had Homes, yet were therein but badly accommodated in Sickness, and could not be so well and so easily taken Care of in their separate Habitations, as they might be in one convenient House, under one Inspection, and in the Hands of skilful Practitioners; and several of the Inhabitants of the Province, who unhappily became disorder'd in their Senses, wander'd about, to the Terror of their Neighbours, there being no Place (except the House of Correction) in which they might be confined, and subjected to proper Management for their Recovery, and that House was by no Means fitted for such Purposes; did charitably consult together, and confer with their Friends and Ac∣quaintances, on the best Means of relieving the Distressed, under those Circum∣stances; and an Infirmary, or Hospital, in the Manner of several lately established in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> being proposed, was so generally approved, that there was Reason to expect a considerable Subscription from the Inhabitants of this City, towards the Support of such an Hospital; but the Expence of erecting a Building sufficiently large and commodious for the Purpose, it was thought would be too heavy, unless the Subscription could be made general through the Province, and some Assistance
<PB N="4" REF="007197_0003_102B392E88A3A3B0"/>
could be obtained from the Assembly; the following Petition was therefore drawn, and presented to the House on the 23d of <HI>January,</HI> 1750-51.</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="petition">
<HEAD>To the Honourable House of REPRESENTATIVES of the Province of Pennsylvania, The PETITION of sundry Inhabitants of the said Province.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Humbly sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT with the Numbers of People the Number of Lunaticks, or Per¦sons distemper'd in Mind, and deprived of their rational Faculties, hat greatly encreased in this Province.</P>
<P>THAT some of them going at large, are a Terror to their Neighbours, who are daily apprehensive of the Violences they may commit; and others are continually wasting their Substance, to the great Injury of themselves and Families, ill disposed Persons wickedly taking Advantage of their unhappy Condition, and drawing them into unreasonable Bargains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THAT few or none of them are so sensible of their Condition as to submit volun∣tarily to the Treatment their respective Cases require, and therefore continue in the same deplorable State during their Lives; whereas it has been found, by the Ex∣perience of many Years, that above two Thirds of the mad People received into <HI>Bethlehem</HI> Hospital, and there treated properly, have been perfectly cured.</P>
<P>YOUR Petitioners beg Leave farther to represent, that tho' the good Laws of this Province have made many compassionate and charitable Provisions for the Re∣lief of the Poor, yet something farther seems wanting in Favour of such whose Poverty is made mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> miserable by the additional Weight of a grievous Disease, from which they might easily be relieved, if they were not situated at too great a Distance from regular Advice and Assistance, whereby many languish out their Lives, tortur'd perhaps with the Stone, devour'd by the Cancer, depriv'd of Sight by Cataracts, or gradually decaying by loathsome Distempers; who, if the Ex∣pence in the present Manner of nursing and attending them separately when they come to Town, were not so discouraging, might again, by the judicious Assistance of Physick and Surgery, be enabled to taste the Blessings of Health, and be made in a few Weeks useful Members of the Community, able to provide for themselves and Families.</P>
<P>THE kind Care our Assemblies have heretofore taken for the Relief of sick and distemper'd Strangers, by providing a Place for their Reception and Accommoda∣tion, leaves us no Room to doubt their shewing an equal tender Concern for the Inhabitants. And we hope they will be of Opinion with us, that a small Provincial Hospital, erected and put under proper Regulations, in the Care of Persons to be appointed by this House, or otherwise, as they shall think meet, with Power to re∣ceive and apply the charitable Benefactions of good People towards enlarging and supporting the same, and some other Provisions in a Law for the Purposes above∣mentioned, will be a good Work, acceptable to GOD, and to all the good People they represent.</P>
<P>WE therefore humbly recommend the Premises to their serious Consideration.</P>

ON the second Reading of the Petition, <HI>January</HI> 29, the House gave Leave to the Petitioners to bring in a Bill, which was read the first Time on the first of <HI>February.</HI> For some Time it was doubtful whether the Bill would not miscarry, many of the Members not readily conceiving the Necessity or Usefulness of the Design; and ap∣prehending moreover, that the Expence of paying Physicians and Surgeons, would eat up the whole of any Fund that could be reasonably expected to be raised; but three of the Profession, <HI>viz.</HI> Doctors <HI>Lloyd Zachary, Thomas Bond,</HI> and <HI>Phineas Bond,</HI> generously offering to attend the Hospital <HI>gratis</HI> for three Years, and the other Objec∣tions being by Degrees got over, the Bill, on the seventh of the same Month, passed the House, <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> and in <HI>May</HI> following it received the Governor's As∣sent, and was enacted into a Law, as follows.</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="act">
<HEAD>An ACT to encourage the Establishing of an HOSPITAL for the Relief of the Sick Poor of this Province, and for the Reception and Cure of Lunaticks.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the saving and restoring useful and laborious Members to a Community, is a Work of publick Service, and the Relief of the Sick Poor is not only an Act of Humanity, but a religious Duty; and whereas there are frequently, in many Parts of this Province, poor distemper'd Persons, who lan∣guish long in Pain and Misery under various Disorders of Body and Mind, and being scattered abroad in different and very distant Habitations, cannot have the Benefit of regular Advice, Attendance, Lodging, Diet and Medicines, but at a great Expence, and therefore often suffer for want thereof; which Inconveniency might be happily removed, by collecting the Patients into one common Provincial Hospital, properly disposed and appointed, where they may be comfortably sub∣sisted, and their Health taken Care of at a small Charge, and by the Blessing of GOD on the Endeavours of skilful Physicians and Surgeons, their Diseases may be cured and removed. And whereas it is represented to this Assembly, that there is a charitable Disposition in divers Inhabitants of this Province to contribute largely towards so good a Work, if such Contributors might be incorporated with proper Powers and Privileges for carrying on and compleating the same, and some Part of the Publick Money given and appropriated to the Providing a suitable Building for the Purposes aforesaid.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, for the Encouragement of so useful, pious and charitable a De∣sign, we pray that it may be enacted, And be it enacted by the Honourable JAMES HAMILTON, Esquire, Lieutenant-Governor under the Honourable <HI>THOMAS PENN,</HI> and <HI>RICHARD PENN,</HI> Esquires, true and absolute Proprietaries of the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and Counties of <HI>New-Castle, Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> up∣on <HI>Delaware,</HI> by and with the Advice and Consent of the Representatives of the Freemen of the said Province in General Assembly met, and by the Authority of the same, That it shall and may be lawful to and for all Persons, each of whom shall have contributed or subscribed the Sum of <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> or more, towards founding an Hospital, for the Reception and Relief of Lunaticks, and other distemper'd and sick Poor within this Province, or as many of them as shall think fit to assemble and meet on the first Day of the Month called <HI>July</HI> next; and for all Persons who shall
<PB N="6" REF="007197_0005_102B3932232CA380"/>
thereafter contribute the like Sum of <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> or more (together with the said first Subscribers) or so many of them as shall think fit to assemble and meet on the second Day of the first Week, in the Month called <HI>May,</HI> yearly for ever, at some conve∣nient Place in the City of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> then and there to elect by Ballot, twelve fit and suitable Persons of their own Number to be Managers of the said Contribution and Hospital, and one other Person to be Treasurer of the same, until the next Election; and farther, to make such Laws, Rules and Orders, as shall appear to them the said Contributors met, or the major Part of them, to be good, useful and necessary, for the well governing, ordering and regulating the said Hospital, and for the Regulation of the future Elections of Managers, Treasurer, and other necessary Officers and Ministers thereof, and for limiting and appointing their Num∣ber, Trust, and Authority, and generally for the well ordering all other Things con∣cerning the Government, Estate, Goods, Lands, Revenues, as also all the Business and Affairs of the said Hospital: All which Laws, Rules and Orders, so to be made as aforesaid, shall be from Time to Time inviolably observed by all concern'd, according to the Tenor and Effect of them, provided they be not repugnant to the Laws of <HI>England</HI> or this Government, and are approved by the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the Assembly, and the Attorney-General of this Province for the Time being, under their Hands and Seals. And the said Contributors shall be, and are hereby made a Body Corporate in Law, to all Intents and Pur∣poses, and shall have perpetual Succession, and may sue, or be sued, plead, or be impleaded, by the Name of <HI>The Contributors to the</HI> Pennsylvania <HI>Hospital,</HI> in all Courts of Judicature within this Province, and by that Name, shall and may re∣ceive and take any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, not exceeding the year∣ly Value of <HI>One Thousand Pounds,</HI> of the Gift, Alienation, Bequest, or Devise of any Person or Persons whomsoever; and of any Goods or Chattels whatsoever; and the said Contributors are hereby impower'd to have and use one common Seal in their Affairs, and the same at their Pleasure to change and alter.</P>
<P>PROVIDED nevertheless, That no General Meeting of the said Contributors, nor any Persons acting under them, shall employ any Money or other Estate, expresly given or added to the Capital Stock of the said Hospital, in any other Way than by applying its annual Interest or Rent towards the Entertainment and Care of the sick and distemper'd Poor, that shall be from Time to Time brought and placed therein, for the Cure of their Diseases, from any Part of this Province, without Partiality or Preference.</P>
<P>AND for the further Encouragement of this beneficent Undertaking▪ Be it enact∣ed by the Authority aforesaid, That when the said Contributors shall have met and chosen their Managers and Treasurer as aforesaid, and shall have raised by their Con∣tributions, a Capital Stock of <HI>Two Thousand Pounds</HI> Value (the yearly Interest or Rent of which is to be applied to the Accommodating of the Sick Poor in the said Hospital, free of Charge for Diet, Attendance, Advice and Medicines) and shall make the same appear to the Satisfaction of the Speaker of the Assembly for the Time being; that then it shall and may be lawful for the said Speaker of the As∣sembly, and he is hereby required to sign an Order or Orders on the Provincial Treasurer, or Trustees of the Loan Office, for the Payment of <HI>Two Thousand
<PB N="7" REF="007197_0006_102B3934CABB5080"/>
Pounds,</HI> in two yearly Payments, to the Treasurer of the said Hospital, to be ap∣plied to the Founding, Building, and Furnishing of the same.</P>
<P>AND be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Accounts of the Disbursements of the said <HI>Two Thousand Pounds,</HI> so ordered by the Speaker of the Assembly aforesaid, or any Part thereof that shall be hereafter expended, as the Case may be, and of the Rents, Products, and Interests of any real or personal Estates or Sums of Money charitably given to the Use of the said Hospital, toge∣ther with a List of such Donations, shall be fairly drawn out and published annu∣ally in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> or other News-papers: And the Managers of the said Hospital shall at all Times, when required, submit the Books, Accounts, Affairs, and OEco∣nomy thereof, to the Inspection and free Examination of such Visitors as may from Time to Time be appointed by the Assembly of this Province, to visit and inspect the same.</P>
<P>PROVIDED always, and it is hereby further enacted by the Authority afore∣said, That if at any Time hereafter, there should not be a constant Succession of Contributors to meet yearly and chuse Managers as aforesaid, then the said Hospi∣tal, and the Estate and Affairs thereof, shall be in the Management, and under the Direction of such Persons as shall be from Time to Time appointed by Act of General Assembly of this Province for that Purpose.</P>

<P>As soon as the Law was published, the Promoters of the Design set on Foot a Subscription, which in a short Time amounted to considerable more than the Sum required by the Act. And on the First of the Month called <HI>July,</HI> 1751, a Majo∣rity of the Contributors met at the State-House in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and pursuant to the Act chose by Ballot twelve Managers, and a Treasurer, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>THE Managers met soon after the Choice, and viewed several Spots of Ground in and near the City, which were thought suitable to erect Buildings on for this Pur∣pose; and agreeing in Judgment, that one particular Lot, belonging to the Proprie∣taries, would suit as well or better than any other, they drew up the following re∣spectful Address, and sent it (with the following Letter) to <HI>Thomas Hyam,</HI> and <HI>Syl∣vanus Bevan,</HI> to be presented by them to the Proprietaries.

<HEAD>The ADDRESS of the Managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please the Proprietaries,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>IT hath been long observed, that this your Province, remarkable for the Goodness of its Constitution, Laws and Government, and many other Advantages, is yet deficient of a common Hospital or Infirmary, for the Relief of such Poor as are afflicted with curable Diseases.</HI></P>
<P><HI>YOUR good People here, to supply this Defect, and out of a tender charitable Regard for their Fellow-creatures, have voluntarily subscribed, and are still subscribing, large Sums towards a Stock for the Support of such an Hospital: And the General Assembly being petitioned by a Number of the Inhabitants of all Ranks and Denominations, have passed an Act to encourage the same, and granted▪</HI> Two Thousand Pounds <HI>for the Founding, Building, and Furnishing thereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IN Pursuance of that Act, we the Subscribers were, on the first of this Instant, chosen by the Contributors to be Managers of the said Hospital, and think it our Duty to take this first Opportunity of laying the Affair before our Proprietaries, in humble Con∣fidence that so good and pious an Undertaking will not fail of their Approbation; hoping withal, from the accustomed Bounty of the Proprietary Family, in encouraging former Designs of publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Utility to the People of their Province, the present will also receive their kind Assistance; and as private Persons raise a Stock to support the Hospital, and the Assembly build the House, so (that all concerned in the Province may share in the Ho∣nour, Merit and Pleasure of promoting so good a Work) the Proprietaries will be pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o favour us with the Grant of a Piece of Ground for the Buildings, and their necessary Accommodations.</HI></P>

<SALUTE><HI>Esteemed Friends,</HI> Thomas Hyam, <HI>and</HI> Silvanus Bevan,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Opinion we have of your beneficent Principles, induces us to make this Application to you, and we hope the Opportunity of exerting your Ten∣derness to the Afflicted and Distressed, will be so acceptable, as to render any Apo∣logy unnecessary for our Freedom in requesting your Friendship in delivering and sol∣liciting the Address we herewith send to our Proprietaries, THOMAS and RICHARD PENN.</P>
<P>THE Circumstances of this Province have, in a few Years past, been much al∣ter'd, by the Addition of a great Number of Persons who arrive here from several Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> many of whom are poor, and settle in remote Parts of the Coun∣try, where suitable Provision cannot be made for their Relief from the various Dis∣orders of Body and Mind some of them labour under; the Consideration of which hath lately rais'd in many of the Inhabitants of this City a benevolent Concern, and engaged them to apply for the Assistance of the Legislature, by whom a Law is pas∣sed, and some Provision made out of the Provincial Treasury for the Erecting a publick Hospital or Infirmary, under the Direction of a Corporation, by whom we have lately been elected the Managers; but as the publick Funds are not sufficient to answer the Expence of endowing it, a charitable Subscription for that Purpose hath been propos'd and begun with good Success. The Necessity and Advantages of this Institution are so apparent, that Persons of all Ranks unite very heartily in promoting it; and as several of our most eminent Physicians and Surgeons have freely offered their Service for some Years, we have good Grounds to expect that this Under∣taking may be of general Service much sooner than was at first expected, and that our Legislature will soon make a further Provision for the Building, which we ap∣prehend it will be prudent to contrive and erect in such Manner, as to admit of such Additions as the future State of the Province may require. The principal Dif∣ficulty we now labour under, is the Want of a commodious Lot of Ground in a healthy Situation; for (tho' we have so great Encouragement as we have men∣tion'd) we cannot flatter ourselves with speedily raising a Sum sufficient to enable us to provide for all other necessary Charges, and to purchase a suitable Piece of Ground so near the built Part of the City, as the constant Attendance of the Phy∣sicians, and other Considerations, will necessarily require: We are therefore under the Necessity of laying the State of our Case before our Proprietaries, and we hope the same Motives which have induced others, will have due Weight with them to pro∣mote this good Work, and that they will generously direct a Piece of Ground to be allotted for this Service.</P>
<P>THERE are several Lots in different Parts of this City very suitable, but from their Situation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are of great Value for other Purposes; we have therefore thought of one, which is in a Part of the Town quite unimproved, and where, in all Probability, there will be the Conveniency of an open Air for many Years; it is the vacant Part of the Square between the <HI>Ninth</HI> and <HI>Tenth-streets</HI> from <HI>Delaware,</HI> on the <HI>South</HI> Side of <HI>Mulberry-street,</HI> and is 396 Feet <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West,</HI> and 360 Feet <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South.</HI> The Lots in this Part of the City have not advanced in Value
<PB N="10" REF="007197_0009_102B3939EF27ABA8"/>
for several Years past, and are not likely to be soon settled; so that we are in Hopes, if you will favour us with your Application for this Piece of Ground, you will meet with no Difficulty in obtaining it.</P>
<P>THE Interest of the Proprietaries and People are so nearly connected, that it seems to us self-evident that they mutually share in whatever contributes to the Pro∣sperity and Advantage of the Province; which Consideration, added to the Satisfac∣tion arising from Acts of Charity and Benevolence, will, we hope, have so much Weight with them, as to render any other Argument superfluous; but as your own Prudence will suggest to you the most effectual Method of solliciting this Address successfully, we rely thereon so much, as to think it unnecessary to add any Thing more on this Occasion, than that your Friendship therein will be exceedingly grateful to us, and our Fellow-citizens in general; and next to obtaining the Lot we ask for, the most agreeable Service you can do us, is to obtain a speedy Answer; for the Promoting this Undertaking appears to us so necessary, that all concerned therein are unanimous in determining to prepare for the Building early in the Spring next Year.</P>

<P>AND whereas the said Managers have addressed us, laying the said Affair before us, in Confidence that so good and pious an Undertaking would not fail of our Approbation, and hoping, from the accustom'd Bounty of our Family in encourag∣ing former Designs of publick Utility to the People of our said Province, the pre∣sent would also receive our kind Assistance; and that as private Persons raised the Stock to support the Hospital, and the Assembly were to build the House, so that we would be pleased to favour the said Managers with the Grant of a Piece of Ground for the Buildings and necessary Accommodations for the said Hospital; and also requesting our Sentiments, if any Thing should occur to us that we might think of Service with respect to the Management or Rules of the said Hospital:</P>
<P>KNOW ye therefore, that we, having taken the Premises into our Consideration, and approving and greatly favouring the said general Scheme and Intention, and being desirous to aid and assist the same, as conceiving that the due Execution there∣of may tend to the Relief of many poor and necessitous Persons in our said Pro∣vince, and to the general Benefit and Advantage of the same, have resolved to in∣corporate the present and future Subscribers by our Grant of Incorporation; and at the same time to grant unto such Corporation so incorporated, a valuable Tract of Land in a proper Place within our good City of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>T<HI>HE Design of the Hospital being (in itself) so beneficent, and our honourable Pro∣prietaries having fully express'd their Approbation of it in strong Terms, as well as declared their kind Intentions of aiding and assisting it, by granting a valuable Tract of Land, in a proper Place, for an Hospital; all therefore that seems necessary for us to do, is to convince our honourable Proprietaries, that the Methods by which they have pro∣posed to aid and assist the Hospital, will by no Means answer these good Intentions, but are really inconsistent therewith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WE must then beg Leave to remark in the first Place, with regard to the Charter, That as the Act of Assembly is undoubtedly the best Grant of Incorporation that we can possibly have, and as the Representatives of the Freemen of this Province have generously contributed towards the Design, we should fail of the Respect that is justly due to them, were we to accept of any other, without obtaining some very great and manifest Advan∣tage by it; but that there are no such Advantages in the Charter proposed, is evident at first View: On the contrary, we should by it be confined to stricter Limits than we now are, particularly with respect to the Power of making By-Laws, and being subjected to Visitors of the Proprietaries Appointment. But that Clause which makes the Lot (and of Consequence the Buildings on it) revert to the Proprietaries, on Failure of a Succession of Contributors, is so weighty an Objection, that were there no other, we could not en∣tertain
<PB N="15" REF="007197_0014_102B394517F26EA0"/>
the least Thoughts of accepting the Charter; for as the Sum allowed for Support of the Hospital is limited, we may reasonably conclude, that in Time there will cease to be a Succession of Contributors, and no Person can imagine that when that happens to be the Case, the Lot and Buildings ought to become the private Property of any Man: And tho' the Act of Assembly hath made Provision in a Manner which may be liable to some Inconveniences, yet it can scarce fail of answering the Purposes first intended. The Pro∣prietaries, to be sure, have not attended to these Consequences, or they never would have proposed any Thing so inconsistent with the Design they intended to promote.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AS to the Lot that the Proprietaries designed for the Hospital, it is so situated, and so circumstanced, that it will by no Means be suitable for the Purpose; it is a moist Piece of Ground, adjoining to the Brick-yards, where there are Ponds of standing Water, and therefore must be unhealthy, and more fit for a Burying-place (to which Use Part of it is already applied) than for any other Service; besides, as it is Part of a Square al∣lotted by the late honourable Proprietary for publick Uses, as the old Maps of the City will shew, our Fellow-citizens would tax us with Injustice to them, if we should accept of this Lot by a Grant from our present Proprietaries, in such Terms as would seem to imply our assenting to their having a Right to the Remainder of the Square.</HI></P>

<SALUTE><HI>Esteemed Friends,</HI> Thomas Hyam, <HI>and</HI> Sylvanus Bevan,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE now, on Behalf of the Contributors to the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Hospital, with much Gratitude and Respect, acknowledge the benevolent Disposition you have manifested by your Industry and Care in solliciting our Address to our Pro∣prietaries; and as we are fully convinced nothing hath been wanting on your Parts, we should have been much pleased that the Lot which the Proprietaries proposed for the Hospital, and the Terms of their Grant, were such as we desired, or could accept.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the Receipt of your Letter, with the Copy of that you had from the Proprietaries, our President waited on the Governor, who was pleased to communicate to us the Instructions he had received; and as the An∣swer given by the Proprietaries to you, may have induced you to think they had granted our Request, we think it necessary to send you a Copy of their Instructions to the Governor, after Perusal of which, and of the few Remarks we have made thereon, we have no Doubt you will approve of our Resolutions not to accept of a Lot on these Terms.</P>
<P>BEFORE we agreed on the Address to the Proprietaries, we survey'd the Square (of which the Lot proposed by them is a Part) and the Situation appeared to us in every Respect inconvenient and unsuitable for our Purpose: It is contiguous to the Brick-makers Grounds, from which the City hath been furnished with Bricks above Forty Years past, so that their large Ponds being continually filled with standing Water, renders the Neighbourhood unhealthy, and of course absolutely improper for our Purpose, which is to restore the Sick to Health; and the only proper Use of that Square will be for a Burying-ground, to which Service some Part of it hath been applied by a Grant from the Proprietaries; and the Dissatis∣faction which appeared, and still subsists among our Fellow-citizens, on the Pro∣prietaries
<PB N="16" REF="007197_0015_102B3947B8BD0E10"/>
claiming a Right to make that Grant is so great, that if there were no other Objection, we would not run the Risque of encreasing it.</P>
<P>WE still think that the Lot we first mentioned is more suitable for us than any other so near the City, and of so small Value, and we are not entirely without Hopes that the Proprietaries, who have so fully declared their Approbation of our Design, will still grant the same to us; we are assured, if they regard their own Interest in the Affections of the People, or even attend to the Justice of their concurring in the Promoting of every Scheme calculated for the Publick Utility of their Province, they will chearfully grant it to us: And if you should entertain the same Senti∣ments, we request you to renew your Sollicitations to them, and if you find them still unwilling to favour our Request, we should be pleased to know whether they will sell it to us, or let it for ever on an annual Rent, and the Price or Rent they pro∣pose; for as the Number of Contributors still continues gradually encreasing, we shall rather endeavour to purchase a Lot in a proper Situation, than to build the House in an inconvenient Place, or to accept of any Lot on such Terms as we know would give a general Dissatisfaction.</P>
<P>ONE of the Contributors hath offered to give a Lot of Ground much larger than that we now ask, and in a very good Air, but being about a Mile out of Town, we are apprehensive it will be inconvenient to the Physicians, who, as they freely give their Attendance, should be subjected to as little Difficulty as possible.</P>
<P>WE have, for the present, hired a House tolerably convenient, into which we began to admit Patients about six Months since; the Number since received is Twenty-three, of which Twelve have been cured and discharged, and Eleven are remaining; and as the Benefits of this Institution become daily more attended to, we have not the least Doubt that the Minds of such who are blessed with the Means, will gradually become the more freely disposed to contribute towards this good Work, and that it will soon become of general Service to the People of this Pro∣vince.</P>
<P>THE kind Manner in which you have chearfully engaged to serve us, gives us Reason to think you will approve of our writing to you with so much Freedom, we shall not therefore offer any Apology for it.</P>

<P>—<HI>WE attended your Proprietary,</HI> THOMAS PENN, <HI>Esquire, and presented to him your Remarks on the Grant of Land made by him and his Brother</HI> RICHARD <HI>to your Society (dated the Eighth of</HI> October, 1751) <HI>and requested instead thereof that Spot

which your Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ial mentioned, and desired might be granted for the intended Hospital; he perused the Remarks, and made Objections to them, alledging that the Ground which you desired was contiguous to that which they have offered, consequently no Difference in the Healthiness thereof. And as to the Remark against its reverting to the Proprietaries, be very readily declared nothing more was intended by the Clause in the Grant, than that pro∣vided the Scheme for the Establishment and Continuance of the Hospital should not succeed, either for want of the Sum proposed to be raised as a Fund, or through any other Cause, that then the Ground should revert,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but as to the Erections thereon, they should be at the Managers Disposal. We desired his Answer in Writing, but he refused the Giving it in that Manner, and added, the Governor should have the necessary Instructions on the Af∣fair, unto whom you might apply concerning it. On the whole, he came to this Resolution, not to make any Alteration in what was before granted, nor to lett or sell the Spot of Ground you pitch upon; and therefore we are of Opinion, you should either accept the Pro∣prietary's Offer, with the Clause relating to the reverting to them being explained, or else to fix on some other Piece of Ground. And if there is no other Objection than the small Distance of a Mile to the Place which one of the Contributors hath offered to give you, may not that be more fit for an Hospital or Infirmary, than to have it in the City, where infections Diseases may be much more liable to spread. We observe, with Pleasure, the Success that hath attended the Beginning of the good Work you are engaged in, and hope it will go forward, and be happily compleated, and are, with hearty Salutes,</HI></P>

<BIBL>MATTH. XXV.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>AMONG all the innumerable Species of Animals which inhabit the Air, Earth and Water, so exceedingly different in their Production, their Proper∣ties, and the Manner of their Existence, and so varied in Form, that even of the same Kind, it can scarce be said there are two Individuals in all Respects alike; it is remarkable there are none within our Observation distinguished from the rest by this Particular, that they are by Nature incapable of Diseases. The old Poets, how▪ extravagant soever in their Fictions, durst never offend so far against Nature and Probability, as even to feign such a Thing; and therefore, tho' they made their <HI>Achilles</HI> invulnerable from Head to Foot, and clad him beside in impenetrable Armour, forg'd by the Immortals, they were obliged to leave one soft unguarded Place in his Heel, how small soever, for Destruction to enter at.—But tho' every Animal that hath Life is liable to Death, Man, of all other Creatures, has the greatest Number of Diseases to his Share; whether they are the Effects of our In∣temperance and Vice, or are given us, that we may have a greater Opportunity of exercising towards each other that Virtue, which most of all recommends us to the Deity, I mean CHARITY.</P>
<P>THE great Author of our Faith, whose Life should be the constant Object of our Imitation, as far as it is not inimitable, always shew'd the greatest Compassion and Regard for the Sick; he disdain'd not to visit and administer Comfort and Health to the meanest of the People; and he frequently inculcated the same Dis∣position in his Doctrine and Precepts to his Disciples. For this one Thing (in that beautiful Parable of the Traveller wounded by Thieves) the <HI>Samaritan</HI> (who was esteemed no better than a Heretick or Infidel by the Orthodox of those Times) is preferred to the Priest and the <HI>Levite,</HI> because he did not, like them, pass by re∣gardless of the Distress of his Brother Mortal, but when he came to the Place where the half-dead Traveller lay, <HI>he had Compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his Wounds, pouring in Oil and Wine, and set him on his own Beast, and brought him to an Inn, and took Care of him.</HI>—<HI>Dives,</HI> also, the rich Man, is repre∣sented as being excluded from the Happiness of Heaven, because he fared sump∣tuously every Day, and had Plenty of all Things, and yet neglected to comfort and assist his poor Neighbour, who was helpless, and <HI>full of Sores,</HI> and might perhaps have been revived and restored with small Care, <HI>by the Crumbs that fell from his Table,</HI> or, as we say, <HI>with his loose Corns.</HI>—<HI>I was sick, and ye visited me,</HI> is one of the Terms of Admission into Bliss, and the Contrary, a Cause of Exclusion: That is, as our Saviour himself explains it, <HI>Ye have visited, or ye have not visited, assisted and comforted those who stood in need of it, even tho' they were the least, or meanest of Mankind.</HI> This Branch of Charity seems essential to the true Spirit of
<PB N="19" REF="007197_0018_102B394D71410628"/>
Christianity, and should be extended to all in General, whether Deserving or Un∣deserving, as far as our Power reaches. Of the ten Lepers who were cleansed, nine seem to have been much more unworthy than the Tenth, yet, in respect to the Cure of their Disease, they equally shared the Goodness of GOD. And the great Physician in sending forth his Disciples, always gave them a particular Charge, <HI>that into whatsoever City they entered, they should heal all the Sick,</HI> without Distinc∣tion.</P>
<P>WHEN the good <HI>Samaritan</HI> left his Patient at the Inn, <HI>he gave Money to the Host, and said, take Care of him, and what thou spendest more, I will repay thee.</HI> We are in this World mutual Hosts to each other; the Circumstances and Fortunes of Men and Families are continually changing; in the Course of a few Years we have seen the Rich become Poor, and the Poor Rich; the Children of the Wealthy lan∣guishing in Want and Misery, and those of their Servants lifted into Estates, and abounding in the good Things of this Life. Since then our present State, how prosperous soever, hath no Stability, but what depends on the good Providence of GOD, how careful should we be not to harden our Hearts against the Distresses of our Fellow Creatures, left he who owns and governs All, should punish our Inhu∣manity, deprive us of a Stewardship in which we have so unworthily behaved, <HI>laugh at our Calamity, and mock when our Fear cometh.</HI> Methinks when Objects of Charity, and Opportunities of relieving them, present themselves, we should hear the Voice of this <HI>Samaritan,</HI> as if it were the Voice of GOD sounding in our Ears, <HI>Take Care of them, and whatsoever thou spendest, I will repay thee.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Good particular Men may do separately in relieving the Sick, is small, compared with what they may do collectively, or by a joint Endeavour and Interest. Hence the Erecting of Hospitals or Infirmaries by Subscription, for the Reception, Entertainment, and Cure of the Sick Poor, has been found by Experience exceed∣ingly beneficial, as they turn out annually great Numbers of Patients perfectly cured, who might otherwise have been lost to their Families, and to Society. Hence Infirmaries spread more and more in <HI>Europe,</HI> new Ones being continually erected in large Cities and populous Towns, where generally the most skilful Phy∣sicians and Surgeons inhabit. And the Subscribers have had the Satisfaction in a few Years of seeing the Good they proposed to do, become much more extensive than was at first expected; for the Multitude and Variety of Cases continually treated in those Infirmaries, not only render the Physicians and Surgeons who at∣tend them, still more expert and skilful, for the Benefit of others, but afford such speedy and effectual Instruction to the young Students of both Professions, who come from different and remote Parts of the Country for Improvement, that they return with a more ample Stock of Knowledge in their Art, and become Blessings to the Neighbourhoods in which they fix their Residence.</P>
<P>IT is therefore a great Pleasure to all the Benevolent and Charitable, who have been acquainted with these Things in other Countries, to observe, that an Institu∣tion of the same Kind has met with such Encouragement in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and is in such Forwardness, that there is Reason to expect it may be carried into Execution the ensuing Year. May the Father of Mercies grant it his Blessing, and Thousand of our unhappy Fellow Creatures, yet unborn, will have cause to bless him, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

it into the Hearts of the generous Contributors, and enabling them thus to pro∣vide for their Relief.</P>
<Q><HI>Homines ad Deos, nulla re propius accedunt, quam Salutem Hominibus dando.</HI> <BIBL>CICER. ORAT.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THIS Motto, taken from a Pagan Author, expresses the general Sense of Mankind, even in the earliest Ages, concerning that great Duty and exten∣sive Charity, the administring Comfort and Relief to the Sick. If Men, without any other Assistance than the Dictates of natural Reason, had so high an Opinion of it, what may be expected from Christians, to whom it has been so warmly re∣commended by the best Example of human Conduct. To visit the Sick, to feed the Hungry, to clothe the Naked, and comfort the Afflicted, are the inseparable Duties of a Christian Life.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY 'tis observable, that the Christian Doctrine hath had a real Effect on the Conduct of Mankind, which the mere Knowledge of Duty, without the Sanctions Revelation affords, never produced among the Heathens: For Hi∣story shows, that from the earliest Times of Christianity, in all well regulated States where Christians obtained sufficient Influence, publick Funds and private Charities have been appropriated to the Building of Hospitals, for receiving, sup∣porting, and curing those unhappy Creatures, whose Poverty is aggravated by the additional Load of bodily Pain. But of these Kind of Institutions among the Pagans, there is no Trace in the History of their Times.</P>
<P>THAT good Prince EDWARD VI. was so affected at the Miseries of his poor diseased Subjects, represented in a Charity Sermon preach'd to him on the Occa∣sion, that he soon after laid the Foundation of four of the largest Hospitals now in <HI>London,</HI> which the Citizens finished, and have ever since maintain'd.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Hide-park,</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> in <HI>Edinburgh, Liverpool, Winchester,</HI> and in the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> and sundry other Places in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> large and commodious In∣firmaries have been lately erected, from trifling Beginnings of private Charities: And so wonderfully does Providence favour these pious Institutions, that there is not an Instance of any One's failing for want of necessary charitable Contributions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Extract from the</HI> Tour through Great-Britain, <HI>Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>Page</HI> 293.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1740, on the Promotion of Dr. <HI>Gilbert,</HI> Dean of this Church, to the Bishoprick of <HI>Land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff,</HI> his Majesty was pleased to confer the Deanery on Dr. <HI>Alured Clarke,</HI> who was installed in the Month of <HI>January,</HI> in that Year; and if we may be allowed to judge from the pious Acts he began with in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Station, a more worthy Man could not have been preferr'd thereto.</P>
<P>THE House, an ancient Building, belonging to that Dignity, had, thro' the Remissness of its former Possessors, been too long neglected; wherefore his first Work was to set about altering and repairing that, which he did within nine Months of his Instalment, at an Expence of about <HI>Eight Hundred Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE this was perfected, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Spring 1741, he drew up and published Proposals for found∣ing an Hospital in this City, for lodging, dieting, and curing the sick and lame Poor thereof, and of the County of <HI>Devon,</HI> on the like Plan of that which he had before founded at <HI>Winchester,</HI> for the Benefit of that City, and County of <HI>Hants.</HI> A De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gn so good, recommended by the pious Elo∣quence of a Divine so learned and judicious, on Views so visibly disinterested, and so clearly ab∣stracted from all Party Schemes or Intentions, met with the general Applause and Assistance of the Gentry and Clergy of all Parties, Sects and Denominations; who, however different in Religion and Politicks, unanimously join'd in this pious Undertaking: And a Subscription being opened in <HI>March,</HI> hath already <HI>(November,</HI> 1741<HI>)</HI> brought in about <HI>Two Thousand Pounds,</HI> of which near <HI>Fif∣teen Hundred Pounds</HI> are annual Engagements, which, 'tis highly probable, will be not only conti∣nued, but much augmented, so that 'tis hoped that Two Hundred Patients at a Time may be pro∣vided for. <HI>John Tuckfield,</HI> of <HI>Radd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was pleased to accommodate the Governors with a Plot of Ground near <HI>Southernbay,</HI> without the City Walls, at a very moderate Price, and to give <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> towards carrying on the Building for the intended Hospital, the Plan of which was commodiously designed by the Direction of the Dean, and the first Stone thereof laid by him, assisted by the Bishop of <HI>Exon,</HI> Sir <HI>William Courtenay,</HI> Knight of the Shire, Sir <HI>Henry Northcote,</HI> and <HI>Hum∣phry Sydenham,</HI> Esquires, the Citizens in Parliament, the Honourable <HI>Henry Rolle,</HI> and <HI>John Tuck∣field,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> attended by a great Number of Clergy and Gentry, that are Subscribers, and Thousands of joyful Spectators, on the Twenty-seventh of <HI>August,</HI> 1741. The Building contains upwards of Three Hundred Feet in Length, and is already in a good Forwardness.</P></NOTE></P>

THE Increase of poor diseased Foreigners and others, settled in the distant Parts of this Province, where regular Advice and Assistance cannot be procured, but at an Expence that neither they nor their Townships can afford, has waken'd the At∣tention of sundry humane and well disposed Minds, to procure some more certain, effectual and easy Methods for their Relief than have hitherto been provided; and having represented the Affair to the Assembly, a Law was passed, without one dissenting Voice, giving <HI>Two Thousand Pounds</HI> for building and furnishing a Pro∣vincial Hospital, on Condition that <HI>Two Thousand Pounds</HI> more should be raised by private Donations, to be put out to Interest as Part of a perpetual Fund for supporting it; and the Contributors were made a Body Corporate, with all the Pow∣ers necessary on the Occasion. Since which, People of all Ranks in this City have united zealously and heartily in promoting this pious and excellent Design, and more than the Sum stipulated was subscribed in a few Days only, and a much larger Sum will probably be raised here, if the Country chearfully contributes to the Capi∣tal Stock▪ which 'tis not to be doubted they will do, when they consider how much they are interested in it.</P>
<P>THE Difference between nursing and curing the Sick in an Hospital, and sepa∣rately in private Lodgings, with Regard to the Expence, is at least as ten to one. For Instance, suppose a Person under the Necessity of having a Limb amputated, he must have the constant Attendance of a Nurse, a Room, Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which can∣not for the first three or four Weeks be procured at less Expence than <HI>Fifteen Shil∣lings</HI> a Week, and never after at less than <HI>Ten:</HI> If he continues two Months, his Nursing will be <HI>Five Pounds,</HI> his Surgeon's Fee, and other accidental Charges, commonly amounts to <HI>Three Pounds,</HI> in the whole near <HI>Ten Pounds;</HI> whereas in an Hospital, one Nurse, one Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will be sufficient for ten Patients, the Extra Expences will be inconsiderable, and the Surgeons Fees taken off, which will bring the above Calculation within the Limits of Truth.</P>
<P>BUT the Difference with regard to the unhappy Sufferer is still greater. In an Hospital his Case will be treated according to the best Rules of Art, by Men of Experience and known Abilities in their Profession. His Lodgings will be com∣modious, clean and neat, in an healthy and open Situation, his Diet will be well chosen, and properly administred: He will have many other necessary Convenien∣ces
<PB N="22" REF="007197_0021_102B395499A12458"/>
for his Relief, such as hot and cold Baths, Sweating-rooms, Chirurgic Ma∣chines, Bandage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which can rarely be procured in the best private Lodgings, much less in those miserable loathsome Holes, which are the common Receptacles of the diseased Poor that are brought to this City.—In short, a Beggar, in a well regulated Hospital, stands an equal Chance with a Prince in his Palace for a com∣fortable Subsistence, and an expeditious and effectual Cure of his Diseases.</P>
<P>IT is hoped therefore, that whoever will maturely consider the inestimable Blessings that are connected to a proper Execution of the present Hospital Scheme in this City, can never be so void of Humanity, and the essential Duties of Re∣ligion, as to turn a deaf Ear to the numberless Cries of the Poor and Needy, and refuse, for their Assistance, a little of that Superfluity, which a bountiful Provi∣dence has so liberally bestowed on them.</P></Q>
<P>ON the Sixteenth of <HI>August</HI> it being made appear, to the Satisfaction of the Assem∣bly, that the Contributions amounted to upwards of <HI>Two Thousand Pounds,</HI> an Order was obtained for the <HI>Two Thousand Pounds</HI> that had been conditionally granted by the Act, <HI>One Thousand Pounds</HI> to be paid immediately, the other in Twelve Months. The Money, when received, was lett out at Interest on good Security, that it might be improving till it should be wanted for the Building, which the Managers were obliged to postpone till a Piece of Ground could be obtained that would afford suf∣ficient Room in an airy, healthy Situation, and yet so nigh the built Streets of the City, as that the Managers, Physicians and Surgeons, might readily and conveniently visit the House on every Occasion. But that some Good might be doing in the mean Time, the Managers concluded to hire a House, and take in some Patients for a Beginning; but some Doubts arising concerning the Power and Duty of the Managers, a general Meeting of the Contributors was called to settle the same, and the following Law was passed for those and other Purposes, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="law">
<HEAD>A LAW for regulating the Elections of the Managers and Treasurer of the Pennsylva∣nia Hospital, and declaring their Trust, Duty and Authority.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS by an Act of the General Assembly of the Province of <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> intituled, <HI>An Act to encourage the Establishing of an Hospital for the Relief of the Sick Poor of this Province, and for the Reception and Cure of Lunaticks▪</HI> the Contributors to the said Hospital are made a Body Corpo∣rate, and impowered to meet, and to make such Laws, Rules and Orders, as shall appear to them the said Contributors met, or the major Part of them, to be good, useful and necessary, for the well governing and regulating the said Hospital, and for the Regulation of the Elections of Managers, a Treasurer, and other ne∣cessary Officers and Ministers thereof, and for limiting and appointing their Num∣ber, Trust and Authority.</P>
<P>AND whereas, in Pursuance of the said Law, the Contributors have met, and have chosen twelve Managers and a Treasurer, which Treasurer hath received con∣siderable Sums of Money for the Use of the said Hospital, and it is now become necessary, for the more orderly Disposition and Application of the said Monies, and
<PB N="23" REF="007197_0022_102B39569138CC58"/>
of such Sums as may hereafter be received, and for the more sure Direction of the Managers and Treasurer therein, to declare and appoint their Trust, Authority and Duty: Therefore it is enacted by the Contributors to the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Hospi∣tal, in general Meeting duly assembled, That the Managers of the said Hospital for the Time being, shall have the Power of disposing of all Monies paid to the Treasurer for the Building, Furnishing, Support, Use and Service of the Hospi∣tal, and for the Hiring and Furnishing a House or Houses for the Reception of Patients, until the said Hospital shall be built, under the Limitations and Restric∣tions of the before-mentioned Act of Assembly. And the said Managers shall likewise have the Power to direct the Manner and Terms of receiving and dis∣charging of Patients; and all Officers and Servants belonging to the Hospital, other than the Treasurer, shall be in the Choice, and under the Direction of the Managers, who shall allow and order their respective Salaries, and may displace them, and appoint others, as often as they shall think fit. And the said Managers shall have the Power of calling general Meetings of the Contributors, as often as they judge it necessary for the Service and Advantage of the Hospital; and shall cause due and publick Notice to be given of the Time, Place, and Design or Purpose of such occasional Meeting, at least ten Days before the same is to be held, and shall nominate some discreet Member to preside therein, and regulate the De∣bates thereof. And the said Managers shall have the Keeping, and Power of af∣fixing, the Seal of the Corporation, which Seal shall be made nearly agreeable to the Form or Draught hereunto annexed; and they shall settle the Accounts with the Treasurer from Time to Time, and take Care that all Laws, Rules and Orders made by the Contributors, and legally approved, be duly and faithfully executed; for all which, or any other Services relating to the Hospital, they shall not claim, receive, or retain, any Fee, Gratuity or Reward whatsoever.</P>
<P>AND for the more orderly Execution of their Duty and Trust, the Managers are hereby required to meet at least once a Month at the Hospital, or some other fit Place in the City of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to confer and conclude concerning the Mat∣ters hereby committed to them; and shall cause fair Minutes of their Proceedings to be kept by their Clerk, in a Book to be provided for that Purpose: In every of which Meetings of the Managers aforesaid, eight of their Number met shall be a Quorum, capable to consult, confer and conclude of and upon all Matters appertaining to their Trust, according to the aforesaid Act of Assembly, and the Laws of this Corporation; and whatsoever seven of the Number so met shall so conclude, shall be deemed and taken for and as the Resolution of the Managers for the Time, and accordingly enter'd in their Minutes. To which Minutes, and also to the Treasurer's Accounts, all Persons concerned shall have free Recourse at all seasonable Times.</P>
<P>AND it is further enacted by the Contributors aforesaid, that every Treasurer hereafter chosen shall, before he take upon himself the Execution of his Office, en∣ter into an Obligation, with one sufficient Surety, in double the Value that doth, or probably may come into his Hands, during the Continuance of his Office, as near as can be estimated by the Managers, unto the Contributors of the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Hospital; conditioned, that he will, once in three Months, or oftener if required,
<PB N="24" REF="007197_0023_102B395922614118"/>
render his Accounts to the Managers of the said Hospital, and well and truly ac∣count, adjust and settle with them when required, for and concerning all Monies that are or shall come into his Hands belonging to the said Contributors, and pay the Ballance that shall appear on such Settlement to be in his Hands, unto such Person, or for such Service as a Board of Managers for the Time being shall or∣der and appoint, and not otherwise; and that he will at the Expiration of his Of∣fice, well and truly deliver up and pay the Ballance of the Monies then remaining in his Hands, together with the Books of Accounts concerning the same, and other the Papers and Writings in his Keeping belonging to the Contributors, unto his Successor in the said Office; and that he will do and execute all other Things as Treasurer to the Contributors aforesaid, according to the true Sense and Meaning of this Law. And he is hereby authorised immediately upon entring into his Office, to demand and receive of the preceding Treasurer, his Heirs, Execu∣tors or Administrators, the Cash, Books of Accounts, Writings and other Effects belonging to the Corporation, giving his Receipt for the same.</P>
<P>AND for the more regular and satisfactory conducting of future Elections, and the Preventing of Disputes and Misunderstandings among the Contributors, con∣cerning the same, it is hereby farther enacted, That the Place and Hour of the Election shall be appointed by the Managers of the current Year, and notified by their Clerk, at least twenty Days before the Election, by printed Advertisements: And the said Managers shall and are hereby required and impowered to nominate three discreet Members of this Corporation to inspect and judge of the said Election, and declare who are the Persons elected; and the Managers shall cause their Clerk to enter in their Book of Minutes the Names of the Persons elected, according to the Tickets.</P>
<P>AND if any Person elected Manager, shall refuse or neglect to act, or shall be absent from three successive Monthly Meetings of the Managers, in any of the first ten Months of the Year for which he shall be elected Manager; or if within the same Year or Term of his Office, he shall be confined by Sickness, or otherwise render'd incapable of executing the Office of a Manager, according to the true Meaning of this Law, or shall die, the rest of the Managers, as often as Occasion shall require, in any of the Cases aforesaid, shall proceed in their Duty and Office without him; or if they think fit they shall nominate another of the Contributors to supply his Place of a Manager until the then next ensuing Election.</P>
<P>AND if any Person so elected Treasurer, shall absent himself from his said Of∣fice for the Space of thirty Days, or shall be otherwise render'd incapable, or ne∣glect his Office or Duty of Treasurer, it shall and may be lawful for the Mana∣gers for the Time being, to displace him from the said Office; and the Managers causing their Clerk to make a Minute for the Purpose, containing their Reasons for displacing him, he shall thereupon, and from thenceforth, cease to be the Treasurer aforesaid, and shall, upon Notice thereof, adjust and settle with the Managers, and pay and deliver the Money, Books, Writings, Accounts, and all other Effects whatsoever in his Hands belonging to this Corporation, to such Person or Persons as the Managers shall order and appoint; and in that Case, and so often, and also if the Treasurer shall depart this Life, the Managers shall no∣minate

another of the Members of this Corporation, but not of their own Num∣ber, to be Treasurer until the next Meeting for the annual Election, or other ge∣neral Meeting of the Contributors.</P>
<P>PROVIDED always, any Thing herein contained to the contrary notwithstand∣ing, That before the Managers for the Time being proceed to erect any Building for the said Hospital, a Plan of such proposed Building, with an Estimation of the Expence, shall be prepared and laid before a general Meeting of the Contributors for their Consideration; and their Approbation shall be obtained before the same is carried into Execution.</P>

<P>FROM this Bounty the Managers have since been enabled to furnish Medicines to many poor Out-patients, who, at their Request, have been kindly visited by the Phy∣sicians <HI>gratis,</HI> besides the Service of them to those in the Hospital.</P>
<P>ABOUT the Beginning of this Year twelve Tin Boxes were provided, on which were written these Words in Gold Letters, <HI>CHARITY FOR THE HO∣SPITAL.</HI> One Box for each Manager, to be put up in his House, ready to re∣ceive casual Benefactions, in Imitation of a good Custom practised in some foreign Countries, where these Kind of Boxes are frequent in Shops, Stores, and other Places of Business, and into which the Buyer and Seller (when different Prices are proposed) often agree to throw the Difference, instead of splitting it: In which the Successful in Trade sometimes piously deposite a Part of their extraordinary Gains, and Magistrates throw their petty Fees; a Custom worthy Imitation! But these Boxes among us have produced but little for the Hospital as yet, not through want of Cha∣rity in our People, but from their being unacquainted with the Nature and Design of them.</P>
<P>IN <HI>March,</HI> 1753, Doctor <HI>Lloyd Zachary,</HI> who had diligently attended the Ho∣spital from the Beginning, being disabled by a paralytick Disorder, Doctor <HI>William Shippen</HI> was about this Time chosen, by the Managers, to supply his Place.</P>
<P>IN <HI>May,</HI> 1753, the Committee of Managers appointed to settle the Accounts of the Hospital, made a Report of them, of which the following is an Abstract, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> THE Majority of the Lunaticks taken in had been many Years disorder'd, and their Diseases become too habitual to admit of Relief; others whose Cases were recent, and might probably have been cured, being put in at private Expence, were so hastily taken away by their Friends, that suffi∣cient Time was not allowed for their Recovery: The Managers have therefore, as well for the Sake of the Afflicted, as the Reputation of the Hospital, resolved to admit none hereafter, who are not allowed to remain twelve Months in the House, if not cured sooner, or judged by the Physicians to be incurable.</P>
<P>THE Choice of the Sick to be supported on the publick Stock, was confined to such only whose Cases could not be healed properly in their respective Habitations, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quired the extraordinary Conveniences and Advantages of an Hospital; amongst these, several, for want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> noble Charity in Time, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too long to receive any other Advantage from it than the Relief of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Poverty, and the Sa∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>faction of being convinced they had every Chance for Recovery that Care and Tenderness could afford.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="007197_0036_102B3974218F81C8"/>
FROM the foregoing Accounts it appears, That from the Tenth of <HI>February▪</HI> 1752, to the Twenty-seventh of <HI>April,</HI> 1754, which is but about two Years and two Months, sixty Persons, afflicted with various Distempers, have been cured, be∣sides many others that have received considerable Relief, both In and Out-patients; and if so much Good has been done by so small a Number of Contributors, how much more then may reasonably be expected from the liberal Aid and Assistance of the Well-disposed who hitherto have not join'd in the Undertaking? Experience has more and more convinced all concerned, of the great Usefulness of this Chari∣ty.—The careful Attendance afforded to the Sick Poor; the Neatness, Cleanness, and Regularity of Diet with which they are kept in the Hospital, are found to contribute to their Recovery much sooner than their own Manner of Living at Home, and render the Physick they take more effectual. Here they have the best Advice, and the best Medicines, which are Helps to Recovery, that many in better Circumstances in different Parts of the Province do not enjoy. In short, there is scarce any one Kind of doing Good, which is not hereby in some Manner pro∣moted; for not only the Sick are visited and relieved, but the Stranger is taken in, the Ignorant instructed, and the Bad reclaimed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The kind Visits and Conversation of some serious Persons, and the pious Books that have been left in the Hospital, recommended to the Perusal of the Patients, together with the exact Regularity kept in the House, have been attended with a Blessing in these Respects.</NOTE>; present Wants are supplied, and the future prevented, and (by easing poor Families of the Burthen of supporting and curing their Sick) it is also the Means of feeding the Hungry, and cloathing the Naked.</P>
<P>IT is therefore hoped, that by additional Benefactions from pious and benevolent Persons (an Account of which will be published yearly according to Law) this Cha∣rity may be farther extended, so as to embrace with open Arms all the Sick Poor that need the Relief it affords, and that the Managers will not, in Time to come, be under a Necessity, from the Narrowness of the Funds, of refusing Admittance to any proper Object. <Q>It is hoped that a deaf Ear will not be turn'd to the Cries of those, in whose Favour both Religion and Humanity strongly plead; who are recommended by the great Pattern of human Conduct; who in Sickness are lost to Society; who contribute greatly to the Instruction of those Youth to whom the Lives of High and Low may hereafter be entrusted, whose Prayers are to be sent up for their Deliverers; but that all will assist to render the Funds of this Hospital answerable to the Necessities of the Poor.—Incapacity of contributing can by none be pleaded; the Rich only indeed can bestow large Sums, but most can spare something yearly, which collected from many, might make a handsome Revenue, by which great Numbers of distress'd Objects can be taken Care of, and relieved, many of whom may possibly one Day make a Part of the blessed Company above, when a Cup of cold Water given to them will not be unrewarded. Let People but reflect what unnecessary Expences they have been at in any Year for vain Superfluities or Entertainments, for mere Amusements or Diversions, or per∣haps in vicious Debauches; and then let them put the Question to themselves, Whether they do not wish that Money had been given in the Way now proposed? If this Reflection has Influence on their future Conduct, the Poor will be pro∣vided

The least Mite may be here given without a Blush; for what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would not chuse to give the Treasurer, or any Manager, the Trouble to rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> may be put into their Charity-boxes, or into the Box which is fixed in the Entry of the Hospital: Where Money cannot so well be spared, Provision or Linen, Blan∣kets, and any Kind of Furniture, Herbs and Roots for the Kitchen, or the Apo∣thecary, or other Necessaries of a Family, may be delivered to the Matron or Go∣verness; old Linen, and even Rags, for Lint, Bandages, and other chyrurgical Dressings, are acceptable, being scarce to be purchas'd sometimes for Money; and tho' they are of little or no Value to those who have them, they are absolutely necessary in such an Hospital, and will be thankfully received.</Q></P>
<P>IT ought in Justice to be here observed, that the Practitioners have not only gi∣ven their Advice and Attendance <HI>gratis,</HI> but have made their Visits with even greater Assiduity and Constancy than is sometimes used to their richer Patients; and that the Managers have attended their Monthly Boards, and the Committees the Visitations of two Days in every Week, with greater Readiness and Punctuality than has been usually known in any other publick Business, where Interest was not imme∣diately concerned; owing, no Doubt, to that Satisfaction which naturally arises in humane Minds from a Consciousness of doing Good, and from the frequent pleasing Sight of Misery relieved, Distress removed, grievous Diseases healed, Health re∣stored, and those who were admitted languishing, groaning, and almost despairing of Recovery, discharged sound and hearty, with chearful and thankful Countenances, gratefully acknowledging the Care that has been taken of them, praising GOD, and blessing their Benefactors, who by their bountiful Contributions founded so ex∣cellent an Institution.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>All Persons who shall be disposed to contribute to the Support of this Hospital by Will, are advised to do it in the following Manner.</HI></P>
