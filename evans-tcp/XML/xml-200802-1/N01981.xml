<Q><BIBL><HI>JOHN VI. 67, 68.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Then said JESƲS unto the Twelve, Will Ye also go away?</P>
<P>Then <HI>Simon Peter</HI> answered Him, <HI>LORD, TO WHOM SHALL WE GO</HI>? Thou hast the Words of Eternal Life.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE find in the 66<HI>th.</HI> Verse of this Chapter, That many of CHRIST's fol∣lowers forsook him, and went away; they turn'd their backs upon him &amp; became Apostates; The occasion thereof we find in the forego∣ing Verses; they stumbled at his Doctrine:
<PB N="2" REF="002351_0003_0FDB2E9227D41738"/>
they were prejudiced at his Sermon: He had told them in the foregoing Verses, that <HI>He was the Bread of life</HI>; and that unless <HI>they ate His Flesh and drank His Blood, they had no life:</HI> That is, they neither had any Spiritual Life then, nor should they have Eternal Life here∣after. They taking these words to be meant Carnally &amp; Literally, not Spiritually, stumb∣led thereat. And when Jesus saw that some of His own Disciples misunderstood him, He proceeds to Enlighten them, v. 61. telling 'em He meant eating of His Flesh &amp; drinking of His Blood, to be after a <HI>Spiritual manner, Ver.</HI> 63. That it is <HI>the Spirit that quickneth</HI> and not the Flesh; and His words were Spiritual, <HI>i. e.</HI> to be understood after a Spiritual manner. After which He told them he knew well that there were some that did not receive the Truth, and would not Believe, <HI>Ver.</HI> 64. And in <HI>Ver.</HI> 65. He gives one reason of it, <HI>viz.</HI> It was not given them of the Father; telling them if the mighty Power of God did not Enlighten their Understanding, quicken their dead Souls, draw them with a sweet, yet holy Violence (as it were) they would not, could not come unto the Son; which was farther offensive still, as the like Doctrine is to <HI>Arminians</HI> to this Day. Upon this they Revolted, and this was the occasion of their Backsliding; therefore it is said, <HI>From
<PB N="3" REF="002351_0004_0FDB2E938C853728"/>
that time many of His Disciples went back and walked no more with Him</HI>; forsook Him, and never returned to follow Him any more.</P>
<P>Upon this the Lord JESUS took occasion to speak to His Disciples, that is <HI>the Twelve</HI> (being full of Pity and Compassion,) He seeing many turn their backs, turned about to those who remained; and in a very pa∣thetical Heart-affecting manner, saith, <HI>Will ye go away also</HI>? Ye that are my Disciples! It is no great wonder to see such and such go away, but will YE also go away that have been so near and so dear to me? Will ye go away from Me that am your Saviour and Re∣deemer? <HI>Simon Peter,</HI> partly being a forward man to speak, partly because the Lord's words reached &amp; deeply affected him, makes Reply, <HI>Lord, whither shall we go</HI>? The words note a Vehemency, and imply,
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) That <HI>they would not go.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) That <HI>they had no where else to go.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As if they should say; Lord, We have no where else to go; we cannot better &amp; mend our selves, therefore we will not go: Whither shall we poor needy Sinners go for help, if we should leave and forsake Thee?</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> That there is no help to be had for poor needy Sinners, but in JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Act 4.12.</HI> Salvation is to be had in no other.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002351_0005_0FDB2E950C221058"/>There are Two PROPOSITIONS.</P>
<P>PROP I. <HI>Sinners are Poor Needy Creatures.</HI> I intend Unconverted Sinners: All men are such by Nature; the condition of all and every man by Nature is, POOR, MISERA∣BLE, BLIND, AND NAKED.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Men stand in need of Pardoning Mercy.</HI> They have need to have their Sins Pardoned. Sins are called <HI>Debts, Mat.</HI> 6.12. What <HI>Luke</HI> calls <HI>Trespasses</HI> or Sins, in <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.4. <HI>Matthew</HI> calls <HI>Debts</HI>; to note that Sin is a Debt. How many Sins a man is guilty of, so many are his Debts: and poor Man is miserably Bank∣rupt, and not able to pay so much as one of the least of them! So likewise man is a poor guilty Criminal &amp; Malefactor, Condemned to die; Joh. 3.18. <HI>He that believeth not is con∣demned already.</HI> And there is no way to escape but by Pardoning Mercy: They stand in need of Justifying Grace to Absolve, Ac∣quit and Discharge them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Men stand in need of Renewing &amp; Sancti∣fying Grace.</HI> Natural men are Carnal, Cor∣rupt, Unholy ones, such as God can have no pleasure in, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.4. Sin is abominable in the sight of the Lord; God hates it, &amp; man because of Sin is such in the sight of God too, Job 15.6. — <HI>Much more abominable is man.</HI> Hence they stand in need of Cleansing and
<PB N="5" REF="002351_0006_0FDB2E97502ADAE0"/>
Purifying, which is done by Converting and Sanctifying Grace; which is wrought by the Operation of the Spirit &amp; Application of the Blood of Christ Therefore you read of be∣ing washed in His Blood, Rev. 1.5 <HI>Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our Sins in His own Blood.</HI> And 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.7, 9. He not only <HI>Forgives,</HI> but <HI>Cleanses from Sin.</HI> This is done by the Blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God. Men stand in need of being Purified &amp; made Holy, without which they cannot enter into the Beatifick Presence of God; Heb. 12.14. <HI>For without Holiness no man shall see the Lord.</HI> As it was of old, a man Ceremonially Un∣clean might not enter into the Camp and Congregation of God's People, <HI>Deut</HI> 23.10. So men Spiritually Unclean cannot enter Heaven, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.5. No unclean thing enters there.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Sinners stand in need of Peace, true Peace &amp; Comfort.</HI> A Peace and Security many of them have; Amos 6.1. <HI>Sinners in Zion are at ease</HI>: they cry, <HI>Peace, peace to themselves</HI>: but this is a Peace that they were better without than with: Tis a false Peace, a carnal Peace;</P>
<P>Peace that must be broken and taken away from them, else <HI>Wo to them</HI>; Tis a Peace that's from a spirit of Self-flattery &amp; from Satan, (he blinds mens Eyes and keeps them under Delusion) and not a Peace that comes
<PB N="6" REF="002351_0007_0FDB2E98D30F8C10"/>
from God. GOD is <HI>angry with them,</HI> (<HI>Psal.</HI> 7.11.) and saith, that <HI>there is no Peace for them,</HI> Isa. 57 <HI>ult.</HI> There is no true Peace &amp; Comfort but what is from God, and is a fruit of the Spirit; Joh. 14.27 <HI>My Peace</HI> (says our Saviour) <HI>I give you</HI>; who sends the Comforter to speak Peace. Christless Souls can have no good well-grounded Peace, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16. <HI>ult. Isa.</HI> 57.19 God causes Peace, but God never speaks Peace to such who are Un∣converted, Impenitent Unbelieving Sinners. Sinners, many of them don't need Ease and Security, but they need Peace: Peace they have, but then not a sound, solid, durable &amp; lasting, Peace.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Men stand in need of the Precious Indwell∣ing Presence of the Spirit of God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>This is needful to Enlighten and Teach them the way they should go.</HI> Men are natu∣rally Blind, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17. Full of Spiritual Darkness and Ignorance, Eph 4 18 <HI>Having their understandings darkned through the igno∣rance that is in them.</HI> Eph. 5.8. They are <HI>Darkness</HI> it self, having no Spiritual light &amp; knowlege▪ 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.14. They neither do no can discern <HI>Spiritual things,</HI> because they <HI>are Carnal</HI>; nor do they understand the way to Jesus Christ. When men fall under Con∣victions and Awakenings, they are wont to calculate and lay out to themselves the way
<PB N="7" REF="002351_0008_0FDB2E9A497DA448"/>
to Conversion, the way to Peace with God; but they are at length made to see that their wisdom is but foolishness. God is wont to let them try, &amp; they try one method &amp; find that fails them, &amp; another &amp; that fails; till at last the Soul comes to see it self Lost &amp; Bewildred: Oftentimes the Sinner is brought to a stand, he is non-plush'd, knows not whether to look or what to do! He finds the way quite contrary to what he expected, he finds 'tis not with him to <HI>direct his own steps.</HI> Much so is it with men after Conver∣sion: they are many times sensible that they must sink and perish if God undertakes not for them; if they have no higher wisdom than their own they shall surely fail of Sal∣vation, miss the Harbour &amp; Haven of Rest, and so Perish for ever. Mans own wisdom will not guide him aright one step: There∣fore you read, Isa. 42.16. GOD <HI>leads the blind in ways that they little thought of, makes darkness to become light, &amp;c.</HI> quite contrary to what they once expected. The Psalmist was sensible of his own darkness &amp; want of wisdom, which made him Pray, as in Psal. 25.4, 5 <HI>Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, &amp; teach me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>They need the Spirit of God to quicken and strengthen them unto Duty.</HI> Naturally men are <HI>without strength,</HI> as well as light, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.6.
<PB N="8" REF="002351_0009_0FDB2E9E65151A60"/>
Not one Duty but the poor Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in need of aid and the help of the Spirit, in order to the right discharge of it; he an't able to move one step aright towards Mercy, nor take one step in the way to Heaven; nay, not so much as to receive Mercy, when and though offered and held out in the Offers &amp; Tenders of the Gospel. Men are by nature not only void of strength, but <HI>deal in tres∣passes and Sins,</HI> (<HI>Eph.</HI> 2.1.) and need there∣fore to be Enlightened and Quickned And after Conversion they need daily Influences from the Spirit, <HI>Psal.</HI> 80.18. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 119.25.

<P>PROP. II. <HI>There is no help to be bad for poor needy Sinners, but in and through JESUS CHRIST.</HI> He and He only can deliver the Needy, the Poor, and him that hath no Helper. <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.12.</P>

himself may Plant, and <HI>Apollos</HI> Water, and yet be unsuccessful, if God deny His Bles∣sing Many lay the fault of their being not Converted upon the Means, and think if they had better Means, they should be and do better. Alas! had <HI>they</HI> the Means and Advantages that such &amp; such have. Oh! If they did but sit under such and such a Mini∣sters, they think they should do well—When alas, Ministers cannot Convert men &amp; &amp; Save them: They may Pray for them, and Weep over them; They may tell them their Misery and their Duty, but they cannot Convert men. Multitudes live and die in their Sins, and are not so much as throughly Convinced under a Painful and Faithful Ministry: Isa. 53.1. <HI>Who hath believed our report? and to whom in the arm of the Lord revealed?</HI> If Ministers could Save their Hearers, they would not suffer so much as One to Perish and go to Hell; not one should go out of the Assembly before they are Converted.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Godly Friends and Relations cannot Save.</HI> All that they can do is to Instruct, Teach, Counsel, Direct, Warn, &amp; Pray for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence the Word of God alone cannot Save.</HI> Psal 19.11. <HI>The Commandments of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes.</HI> It has a Convincing Power &amp; Efficacy, but not in it self, only as it is in the hand of God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.12. 'Tis
<PB N="10" REF="002351_0011_0FDB2EA7DB929800"/>
<HI>the Sword of the Spirit, Eph.</HI> 6.17. But if it be not wielded by the Spirit of God, it is like a <HI>Sword in the Scabbard,</HI> that neither wounds nor pierces; it is as the Spirit and mighty Power of God makes it. Hence multitudes who fit all their Days, live and die under the most likely Means and Advantages, such as Preaching of the Word, go to Hell when they Die &amp; so Perish for ever notwithstand∣ing all: They did so of old in the Days <HI>of the Prophets,</HI> in the Days of <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> under the Ministry of our SAVIOUR Him∣self, and in the Days of the <HI>Apostles</HI> likewise, and ever since even <HI>to this Day.</HI> We must indeed attend to the Word, but after all look to GOD, who alone gives Success.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Dependance on a mans own Righteousness, that cannot Save a man.</HI> All that a man can do, cannot recommend him to God's Favour, or lay God under any Obligation to take Pity on and Save him. Such as build their Hopes upon their <HI>Doings,</HI> build but upon the <HI>Sand.</HI> Man cannot Merit at the Hands of God, any thing but Misery. Mans Righte∣ousness is but as <HI>filthy Rags, Isa.</HI> 64.6. There∣fore does pollute and defile him: They do but Condemn him being imperfect and sinful. The <HI>Pharisee</HI> had his dependance upon his own Righteousness, but what got he by it▪ he lost his Life, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18 <HI>from Ver.</HI> 9 <HI>to the</HI> 15<HI>th.</HI>

Men are wont to have a great deal of depen∣dance upon their Repentance and Reforma∣tion, their Prayers &amp; their Tears, and really think God is bound to have regard for them. Hence they are oft times wont to have hard thoughts of God, when they don't find ex∣pected Success in performing Duty, Isa. 58.3. <HI>Wherefore have we Fasted, say they, and thou seest not? — Tis in vain to serve God,</HI> Mal. 3.14 Job 21.15. <HI>To what purpose and to what profit is it to Pray to God</HI>? All this is the Language of a Self jusstifying Sinner and Merit-monger. But, alas! he that has no better Foundation to build upon, is sure to sink: Such a depen∣dance won't keep men out of Hell, Psal. 49.7, 8 <HI>None can by any means redeem</HI> a Soul, <HI>nor give to God a Ransom for him: For the Redemption of the Soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever.</HI> The Price necessary for the Redemption of the Soul out of the Hands of God's Justice, is so great, that for all a man can do, there is no hope of Redeeming it; Isa. 40.16 <HI>Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.</HI> Thousands of Rams, or ten thousands of Rivers of Oil, nay the Fruit of the Body, tho' it should be the First-born, cannot appease the Anger of God &amp; Redeem the Soul, <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.7. Could we water our Couch, &amp; weep tears of Blood, it wou'd not commend us to God or give satisfaction to <HI>injured Justice.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="002351_0013_0FDB2EAD739060E0"/>5 <HI>There is us depending upon Absolute Mercy▪ neither.</HI> To look to that and think that Mercy shall save us without Gospel-condi∣tions, &amp; complying with the Terms, Offers, and senders of Grace, is but the ready way to Perdition. Yet men must depend on <HI>Ab∣solute Mercy</HI> to work Gospel-conditions in them. This is the case of abundance of men. Ask them, <HI>Do they hope to be Saved? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hell?</HI> They'll say, Oh! <HI>Yes.</HI> Ask them, <HI>Why do you hope so? Why,</HI> say they, <HI>GOD is a Merciful God!</HI> That's true, and that's no more than the Damned in Hell may save Tis a precious truth, GOD is rich in Grace, abundant in Mercy, plenteous in Redemp∣tion: Read Psal 86.15. <HI>Thus, O Lord, are a God full of Compassion, Gracious, &amp; Long suffering.</HI> And Psal 130.7. <HI>With the Lord is Mercy &amp; plenteous Redemption.</HI> But notwithstanding this, multitudes Perish for ever. God never bestows Mercy upon any, but in and through Jesus Christ. And such as look not for the Grace of Faith, Repentance, and Holiness, here, are sure to Perish notwithstanding all the Provision that Mercy has made for Poor Sinners. Tis in vain to plead Mercy, if Mercy don't win us over to a Compliance with Gospel Terms, it will not save us at last from Hell.</P>

His Blood alone is able to quench the Flames of God's burning Ire, which otherwise burns down to the lowest Hell. <HI>Again,</HI> He must be Man, that so He might be able to Suffer; for God only suffers in the Humane and not Divine Nature. He must be Man as well as God, that He might be fit to become the Redeemer of man. Man Sinned, and Man must Die. You read, under the Law in case a man Sold himself, and was not able to work his own Redemption, then he must be Re∣deemed by a Brother, or of one near of Kin. See <HI>Lev.</HI> 25 47.48.

But JESUS CHRIST is an alsufficient Physician, Saviour, and Redeemer; Heb. 7.25 <HI>He can Save to the uttermost.</HI> Oh! What Encourage∣ment is there then to go to Him, since He can, and none other can, help you.</P>
<P>Motive. 2. <HI>He is a Ready &amp; a Willing Saviour.</HI> He is as willing as He is able: He is more ready to help poor Sinners, than they are to be helped by Him. Mercifulness is one of the Glory's of God's Nature. We reckon it a very Amiable thing in man to be Pitiful: And this doth more abound in the Lord, than in any Creature whatsoever. <HI>There is no man in the world</HI> (as Dr <HI>Preston</HI> Expresses it) <HI>so ready to forgive as GOD is.</HI> If our Sins be exceeding many &amp; exceeding great, yet the Lord is Merciful &amp; exceeding ready to forgive. He graciously invites men to come, Mat. 11.28, 29. <HI>Come to Me,</HI> poor, burthened,

tyred Soul. Rev. 22.17. <HI>Come: The Spirit says Come, and the Bride says Come. And who∣soever will let him</HI> (come and) <HI>take of the Water of Life freely.</HI> Joh 6.37. <HI>He that comes I will in no wise cast out,</HI> says the Lord. Isa. 45.22. <HI>Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth.</HI> Why do you Object your own Unworthiness? Isa. 55.1. <HI>Come and buy with∣out money,</HI> — Tho' you have no Worthiness, yet come. If Naked go to Him for Cloathing, Read <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.18. You think your wants are too great to be supplied! why go freely, and ask liberally: You cannot ask too great Blessings. Psal. 81.10. <HI>Open thy mouth wide, &amp; it shall be filled.</HI> Be not strait-handed in asking, if you would have God liberal in bestowing. You see the readiness of God to accept Penitent, Returning Prodigals. In the Parable of the Prodigal, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.20. <HI>The Father saw him afar off &amp; ran to meet him.</HI> You don't read that the Son ran to meet the Father; but that the Father he ran to meet his Son. All which is to shew the Readiness of God to receive and help poor needy Souls; His Arms are stretch'd out, He stands with open Arms ready to receive the Sinner, <HI>Job.</HI> 6 36, 37. Oh! Be perswaded to fly to Jesus Christ for help for thy poor needy Soul.</P>
<P>Motive 3. <HI>Consider the great Necessity you lie under.</HI> If you don't go, you Perish, if you fit
<PB N="19" REF="002351_0020_0FDB2EBA8DF18CB0"/>
still you are sure to Die: As they said, 2 King. 7.4. <HI>If we fit still we die.</HI> So I say, JESUS CHRIST is the City of Refuge, thither you may flee and be safe; but if you fit still you must die; and it will be a great aggravation of your Misery, to fit still &amp; die, when there is help to be had, especially having so great Encouragement to seek it.</P>
<P>Motive 4. <HI>Your Time is short &amp; uncertain too.</HI> Therefore don't delay; nor don't dally and trifle; up and be doing; be in good earnest and maste haste; Fly, fly, Oh! Flee to the City of Refuge; Heb 6.18. <HI>Flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope that is set before you.</HI> It has reference to the City of Refuge, of old appointed for Man-slaughter; but not to save wilful Murderers: And if the Man-slayer was slow, slack, negligent, the Avenger of blood might overtake him, and so he Perish; therefore he was to flie and make hast. So says the Apostle here. Man must flie as from an Enemy, flie as a Bird from the Fowler or Hawk; flie as for Life; make haste, left the Justice of God (the Avenger of blood) over∣take you. Give your selves no rest till you have got into <HI>the City of Refuge</HI>; if you fall short and sit down, tho' at the gate, tho' at the door of Heaven, yet you'l Perish. You may go far, yet you'l Perish for ever, if you rest short of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002351_0021_0FDB2EBCDFCE1700"/>To Conclude with some Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Get pinched with the sense of your Wants.</HI> The Prodigal never comes to any serious Thoughts of returning to his Fathers house, till pinched with Hunger, <HI>Luke</HI> XV. So here, Whatever men thinks of it, they will never be truly willing to go to Christ for help in a right way, till they are starved out of house and home. So long as they can live with∣out Christ, they will. Oh! Study your own Hearts, Reflect upon your Lives, dwell much in Meditation upon your Natural miserable State and Condition, till you feel that sense <HI>That there is no Hope,</HI> you'l never go to Christ for help upon Gospel Terms, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.12 The <HI>Israelites</HI> look'd not to the <HI>Brazen Serpent,</HI> till they found themselves stung by the <HI>Fiery Ser∣pents.</HI> Now, Oh! Now 'tis that a Saviour is Precious! Men that before slight Jesus Christ and the Offers of Mercy, when they come to feel themselves sinking, Oh! What would they give for a Saviour? A drop of that Blood which once they could trample under foot, is more worth than the whole World to them now. Sense of Sin, Misery, Danger, &amp; Fear of Hell, will make a saviour Precious.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Go Humbly if you would go Acceptably.</HI> Go Poor, &amp; Wretched, and Empty. Oh! Don't think to carry any thing with you that will Recommend you to God: Isa. 55.1. Go <HI>without
<PB N="21" REF="002351_0022_0FDB2EBE562599F8"/>
Money &amp; Price.</HI> Go Empty, that so you may Receive freely. Go Empty, sensible that you are so, and then you'l be Welcome. Be willing to set the Crown upon the Head of Jesus Christ, that <HI>He</HI> shou'd have all the Praise and Glory of your Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Look earnestly to God to Prepare &amp; Lead you.</HI> If He don't undertake and lead you, you'l never find the way to Jesus Christ, <HI>Isa.</HI> 42.16 Tell the Lord, He can do it, He has done it for others, and He can do it for you. Plead hard Night &amp; Day: 'Tis a matter of greatest Moment, highest Consequence. Your poor Souls and all lies at stake. Don't think that God will bestow Grace upon the Negligent and Careless Sinner, or upon the Cold▪ and Indifferent Seeker. The little Pains that some men take, is an Argument that they are like to miss of God's Grace &amp; Mercy.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Wait on GOD in the diligent Ʋse of all Means.</HI> Neglect no Duty, beware of all Sin, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.30 Don't do any thing wilfully that may grieve the Spirit of God, lest you pro∣voke Him and He forsake you Have you waited long? Yet be not discouraged, but hold out and wait still. A Ship that beats long upon the Coast, may at last arrive safe in the Harbour: So a Soul that has many Years been Seeking and Waiting, may at last obtain Mercy.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="22" REF="002351_0023_0FDB2EC32A82E388"/>5. Lastly, <HI>Realize the Advantage that you will gain by a Gospel Compliance with Duty</HI> If you once get safe into Jesus Christ, you are made for ever: It will make you rich amends for all your Pains. You will never Repent, &amp; say that you have been too Speedy, or too Early, or too Painful, nor for the whole World be out of Jesus Christ again, so much as for <HI>one Hear.</HI> Oh! Believe it, <HI>It would be worth a while to swim through whole Seas of Blood to get to JESƲS CHRIST</HI>: (As one said.) When you come to Heaven, <HI>one Hour</HI> in the Presence of GOD, where is fulness of Joy unspeakable, (<HI>Psal.</HI> 16 <HI>ult.</HI>) will swallow up and make you forget your Sorrows and your Tears, here. Oh! It is well worth your while to be at utmost, yea at all Pains, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Interest in JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
