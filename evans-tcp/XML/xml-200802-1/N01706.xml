<HEAD>A PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS 'tis Man's <HI>Sin, Shame</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI> to be estrang'd and alienated from God; so it's his <HI>duty, honour</HI> and <HI>interest</HI> to return to God, be acquainted with Him, conform'd to His Image and possess'd of His special favour in Christ. Men consider'd as Fallen &amp; Apostate (as they derive from rebellious Adam) are running away from God, and posting on in the broad way to destruction; but the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the Devil, to reduce sinful Men, and bring them back to the only Author of their being and blessedness. He suffered, the just for the unjust, <HI>that He might bring us to God. He gave himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us to Himself for a peculiar People zea∣lous of good works.</HI> And His <HI>Holy Word,</HI> the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> are the grand Means or <HI>Instrument</HI> of <HI>purifying</HI> Sinners: they're able to make Men wise to Salvation, thro' Faith in Christ Jesus. The Scope and tendency of them is, to turn Men from darkness to light, from the power of Satan
<PB REF="002024_0003_0FBA810BB81D43D0"/>
unto God. <HI>Sanctify them thro' thy truth, thy word is truth.</HI> The <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit,</HI> does not go without the <HI>Belief of the Truth.</HI> All therefore who enjoy the <HI>Word of God,</HI> should diligently <HI>Read, Hear, Study</HI> the same, meditating on it Day and Night: they should endeavour &amp; pray that they may rightly understand it, and univer∣sally and continually conform their hearts and lives unto it. All under the Gospel should do so, and the <HI>sooner</HI> they begin, and the more constant and vigorous they are in such a course, so much the better; so much the more 'twill be for God's Glory and their own Advantage. <HI>Young</HI> Ones therefore should be most <HI>speedy, hearty,</HI> and also <HI>unmoveable</HI> and <HI>diligent</HI> in conforming to God's holy revealed Will. A serious reading the fol∣lowing <HI>Sermons,</HI> must needs be proper to move and quicken them to such a Life. They contain such <HI>strong Arguments, weighty Motives,</HI> lively and <HI>cogent Inculcations of Duty,</HI> plain representa∣tions of the <HI>danger of careless sloth &amp; negligence,</HI> and such <HI>suitable Directions</HI>; as that a serious, healty, attending to them, and regarding of them, must needs be very useful and profitable to <HI>all Young Persons</HI> whatsoever. Indeed a serious, de∣liberate perusing of them, can't but be profitable to all Persons whatsoever, even the Oldest, and those that have made most proficiency in the practice of Piety: here they may find fresh oc∣casion, to bewail their deficiences &amp; short comings, as well as to praise the God of all Grace for the great things He has done for their Souls. They're profitable for <HI>Old Sinners,</HI> that by considering how they have trifled away their precious Opportu∣nities, abus'd Divine Patience lengthen'd out to

long-suffering, practically despis'd the <HI>Precepts, Promises, Threatnings</HI> of the Glorious God, and thereby render'd themselves grievously obnoxi∣ous to His most terrible Vengeance; they may be mov'd and quicken'd, to the most speedy vigo∣rous endeavours to get their peace made with God, before their near approaching Death over∣takes them. They're profitable for those who have Young Ones under their Care, that they may be mov'd hereby to do their utmost for their spiritual good and benefit. But as these <HI>Sermons</HI> were more especially design'd, for the benefitting of <HI>Young Persons,</HI> so to such I would hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tily recommend the serious reading of them, that thereby (thro' the Blessing of God) they m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be <HI>enlightened, awaken'd, convinc'd</HI> of their <HI>sin, guilt, danger,</HI> and of their <HI>absolute need of Christ,</HI> of His <HI>Righteousness</HI> to justify them; of His <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> to <HI>renew</HI> and <HI>sanctify</HI> them, and <HI>lead them in paths of righteousness for His Name sake.</HI> That the <HI>Laborious Endeavours</HI> of the <HI>Worthy Author</HI> of these Sermons, (My Fellow-Labourer in the Gospel, and in the same Church) may be follow'd with God's efficacious Blessing, &amp; made instrumen∣tal of spiritual saving Good to those who partake of them; is the Prayer of a mean unworthy Ser∣vant of JESUS CHRIST,</P>

<HEAD>THE Author's EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Abounding of Iniquity</HI> in a Christian Land, is just matter of Lamentation, and is a daily Grief to such as have at heart the Concerns of God's Glory, and the best Interests of this People. And it is the un∣questionable Duty of All, to endeavour in our several Stations, according to the Talent committed to us, to promote an happy <HI>Reformation.</HI>— And if the <HI>Rising Generation</HI> among us might be induced to <HI>Cleanse their Way,</HI> This wou'd be one glorious ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd afford a most hopeful prospect of the desir'd Blessing.—A serious view p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culiarly at the benefit of our <HI>Young People</HI> produced the subsequent <HI>DISCOURSE</HI>: which is the Substance of sundry <HI>Sermons,</HI> first delivered from the Pulpit in the Course of my Ministry about a Year &amp; Half since, and more lately (at desire) in Sum <HI>repeated</HI> to a <HI>Society of Young Men,</HI> meeting privately for Religious Exercises on <HI>LORD's</HI>-Day-Evenings.— And at their <HI>repeated Request,</HI> (Not without the Sollicitation &amp; Approbation of some <HI>worthy Friends,</HI> whose Judgment and Importunity not to hearken unto in such a Case should seem not altogether De∣cent,)
<PB REF="002024_0006_0FBA811348BE9DF0"/>
I have at length suffer'd this small Tract to appear abroad; n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t daring to run the Risque of incurring Guilt, by obstinately rejecting the pious desires of Any, and utterly refusing an Opportunity of <HI>doing Good,</HI> (which none should be backward to) tho' in never so inferior degree.— Indeed I con∣fess, (what has been an objection of no little weight with me,) that the World is full of Elaborate Treatises on all Points of practical Divinity: and particularly the Subject of the following Composure has been al∣ready handled by sundry superior Pens. And from imagining, that, after their Excelling Labours upon it, any <HI>new</HI> Light cou'd be added thereunto by the Essay of so poor a Scribe, I am abundantly checkt by an apprehension of my insufficiency.—But there are Multitudes of Readers, and many of them doubtless not owners of those Writings, and besides among them there is a great diversity of Genius, Incli∣nation, &amp; Relish; and hence a variety of Tracts on the same Head by different Hands is but convenient; according to that known saying of One of the Ancients, <HI>Utile est Plures Libros a Pluribus fieri. To have the same Argument treated divers ways is use<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul.</HI> In a <HI>Variety,</HI> 'tis probable, every one may find what will please and profit him.—Therefore with all due deference to the Excellent Writings of Others, I humbly offer th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ensuing Pages particularly to the Perusal of Young People, hoping they may be of some <HI>Service.</HI> And if this End be answer'd in any measure, I have enough to satisfy me, that I have done but my Duty in making Publick these few Sheets.—And I am (perhaps <HI>too</HI>) prone to think it savours of little less than <HI>Pride,</HI> to be <HI>invincibly</HI> averse to speaking to the World from the <HI>Press,</HI> in pursuance of our Office, when there is a probable
<PB REF="002024_0007_0FBA8114B5045788"/>
Prospect of doing some <HI>Good,</HI> altho' our performances may come vastly short of others for Light and Force.</P>
<P>And it cannot be thought, but that in Discoursing on such a common Theme, I may have adopted some Hints from Others: and indeed sometimes I have <HI>chosen</HI> to speak my own sense in <HI>borrow'd Language</HI>: where I have taken this Liberty, the Reader may observe, I have constantly <HI>comma'd</HI> the same, or marked it thus (") unless possibly some few Senten∣ces may have slipt me.—Many, I am very ap∣prehensive are the defects in these few Papers: But the Performance▪ such as it is, (Humbly leaving the Event with GOD as to it's <HI>Entertainment</HI> &amp; it's <HI>Success,</HI> &amp; Earnestly begging that it may be servi∣ceable to His Glory, &amp; the Good of Souls,) I present it to you, relying on your Candour for the Allowance, you will easily discern it needs; &amp; now requesting your Prayers for me, <HI>I commend you to God, &amp; to the Word of His Grace, which is able to build you up &amp; to give you an Inheritance among all them which are sanctify'd, through Faith that is in Christ Jesus. Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Cleansing our Way in YOUTH Press'd, As of the Highest Importance▪ AND Observing the Word of GOD Recommended, As the Only Means.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSAL. CXIX.9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wherewith shall a Young Man cleanse his Way? By taking heed <HI>thereto</HI> according to thy Word.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Divinely Inspired <HI>Author</HI> of this long and copious Psalm was doubtless King <HI>David,</HI> the sweet Singer of Israel; The <HI>Matter</HI> of it is of the highest impor∣tance; the <HI>Composition</HI> of it is most accurate and artificial; The <HI>Scope</HI> and Design of it is to adorn the Character, and celebrate the Glories of God's <HI>Word,</HI> to declare the Psalmists own great &amp; long Experience of the admirable sweetness, and use∣fulness of it, and to recommend it to every ones devout study, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief, &amp; practical observation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002024_0009_0FBA81201BDA4F60"/>IN our <HI>Text,</HI> The Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God is prescrib'd and commended to <HI>Young Men,</HI> as the Rule and Means of Spiritual Purification. <HI>Wherewith shall a Young Man</HI> &amp;c. This is call'd by some, <HI>The Young Man's Practical Catechism,</HI> set down by way of Question and Answer. Others indeed take the whole Verse to be <HI>one intire</HI> Question, standing thus, <HI>Where∣with shall a Young Man cleanse his way, to take heed to thy Word?</HI> The Original will admit this Con∣struction, and some Ancient Versions (as Mr. <HI>Shower</HI> on our Text observes) do countenance it. The sense (says He) accordingly is, "How shall Young Men be purged by Divine Grace, so as thereby to be qualify'd for Obedience to (the Word of) God. It is a kind of Prayer (in a Poetic strain) for that Grace, which is necessary to holy walking." So <HI>Cleansing the Way of Youth</HI> is considered as a <HI>Means</HI> to promote their practical <HI>conformity</HI> to God's holy <HI>Law.</HI> Psal. 119.101. <HI>I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</HI></P>
<P>BUT most Interpreters understand the latter Clause to be <HI>distinct,</HI> and to come in by way of <HI>Reply</HI> to the former; so directing Youth to a careful observation of God's Word, as a necessary and useful means to rectify and cleanse their way. Psal, 119.11. <HI>Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.</HI></P>
<P>WE may here observe, that the Word [<HI>thereto</HI>] is not in the <HI>Original,</HI> but is a <HI>Suppletive</HI> of the <HI>Translators,</HI> and I shall presume to leave it out.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Terms</HI> in the Text are all obvious and easy. By [<HI>a Young Man</HI>] is meant Youth <HI>Lite∣rally,</HI> altho' some interpret it of a "<HI>Child of God, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the New man,</HI> according to the Phrase of the Gospel"; Youth <HI>Indefinitely,</HI> all Persons in their
<PB N="3" REF="002024_0010_0FBA8121C6FB3F28"/>
<HI>Early Days,</HI> not any appropriate Sex or Indivi∣dual; Youth <HI>Irrestrictively,</HI> It is not to be look'd upon as Exclusive of, or in contradistinction to other Ages; Elder and Younger are under the Direction of the same Rule, and the Obligation of the same Law.</P>
<P>BY [<HI>cleansing his way</HI>] is meant a rectifying his inward Principles and temper of mind, and a reforming his outward practice and tenor of Life, which are defiled by Sin; a recovering himself and cleansing his way from moral pollution, a breaking off from Sin, the <HI>unclean thing, which de∣fileth a Man,</HI> a washing off this filth with the Tears of Repentance; purifying his Soul in obey∣ing the Truth. There is indeed another <HI>Purging our Sins,</HI> which sounds the same with <HI>Pardon</HI> and <HI>Justification, He is faithful to forgive us our Sins and to cleanse us, &amp;c. The Blood of Christ cleanseth from all Sin.</HI> But this belongs wholly unto God, <HI>(Who can forgive Sins, save God only?)</HI> and is not the Cleansing intended in our Text. The Clean∣sing here spoken of relates to the work of <HI>Sancti∣fication,</HI> and implies <HI>the Mortification of our Lasts, and the Reformation of our Lives.</HI> In this work <HI>we</HI> are subordinate <HI>Agents,</HI> working together with God and in the strength of his Grace. 'Twas <HI>Naamans</HI> pride and folly, when he came to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lisha</HI> to be cleansed from his Leprosy, He wou'd have had the <HI>Prophet</HI> do <HI>all,</HI> and <HI>Himself nothing</HI>; This is the error of the wicked; the Prophets direction is that, <HI>Go unto Jordan, wash thy self seven times in it, and thou shalt be clean.</HI>—Up and be doing and the Lord shall be with thee.</P>
<P>BY [<HI>thy Word</HI>] is meant the <HI>Oracles of God,</HI> even <HI>All Scripture that is given by Inspiration of
<PB N="4" REF="002024_0011_0FBA812306C93A78"/>
God.</HI> Indeed the Writings of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> are here particularly refer'd to, these only, (and that but part of them) being extant in <HI>Davids</HI> time. But the rest of the Old-Testament, and the whole of the New-Testament, being Divinely inspir'd, and profitable to make Men wise unto Salvation, they are also to be considered as imply'd in the <HI>Word</HI> spoken of.</P>
<P>BY [<HI>taking heed</HI>] to the Word of God, is meant a diligent <HI>observing</HI> or <HI>keeping</HI> of it. This is the genuine import of the Original Word [<HI>Shamar.</HI>] It is variously translated; Sometimes to <HI>observe, Gen.</HI> 37.11. His Father <HI>observed</HI> the saying; So, <HI>Josh.</HI> 1.7. Be courageous, that thou mayst <HI>observe</HI> to do according to all the Law. Sometimes to <HI>take heed to,</HI> sometimes to <HI>keep</HI>; It is thus diffe∣rently rendred in one and the same Verse. <HI>Psal.</HI> 39.1. I said, I will <HI>take heed to</HI> my ways,—I will <HI>keep</HI> my mouth. So, <HI>Dan.</HI> 7.28. I <HI>kept</HI> the matter in my heart. So in the Verse before our Text, I will <HI>keep</HI> thy Statutes,—and in 17 Verse— that I may live and <HI>keep</HI> thy Word. Again, Sometimes to <HI>preserve,</HI> Psal. 116.6. The Lord <HI>preserveth</HI> the simple. Again, to <HI>mark,</HI> Psal. 130.3. If thou shouldst <HI>mark</HI> iniquities—</P>
<P>IF Young Men wou'd Cleanse their way, they must take heed to God's Word, sollicitously study, critically observe, and seriously ponder it, care∣fully apply it, and diligently conform to it.</P>
<P>THE General DOCTRINE from the Words, is This, <HI>Viz.</HI>
<Q><HI>THAT,</HI> For Young Men to take heed to the Word of God, is the most proper and effectual method to purify and preserve their way from sinful Pollutions.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002024_0012_0FBA81249355C888"/>IN this DOCTRINE there are several Things supposed and asserted. As —

<ITEM>(1.) THE Way of Youth is defiled.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>The Way of Youth is defiled</HI>; and that in respect of Natural Corrupt on, and Actual Pollutions. <HI>Cleansing</HI> is an Act, which in its nature speaks the object <HI>impure,</HI> and implies a Change from loathsome <HI>defilement</HI> to delightful <HI>purity.</HI> The way of Youth is polluted, and needs a purifying Change. Here consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Humane Nature was Universally de∣praved, and defiled upon the first Apostacy, and this Universal Corruption descends to the whole Natural P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sterity of Fallen Adam in all succeeding Genera∣tions.</HI> It is a Truth too palpable and notorious to be disputed, that the <HI>Nature</HI> of Man is lamentably disrob'd of it's primitive unblemisht purity &amp; per∣fection, and is now cloath'd with a most shameful abiding pravity &amp; pollution. The natural Consci∣ence and daily Experience of every Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re a Cloud of Witnesses: The Ordinance of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sm</HI> does evidently suppose it, and the unerring Ora∣cles of God do plainly and peremptorily assert it. I need only mention two Places; Gen. 6.5. <HI>God saw, that every imagination of the thoughts of Mans heart was only evil continually.</HI> Here is a sad im∣putation upon Man, His <HI>Heart</HI> is <HI>Evil,</HI> (his Nature corrupted,) the <HI>Thot's</HI> of his Heart are <HI>Evil,</HI> (The settled apprehensions, &amp; inclinations of the Heart
<PB N="6" REF="002024_0013_0FBA812A5480DB08"/>
are by nature falsely byass'd, &amp; greatly infected,) The <HI>Imagination</HI> of the Thot's of his Heart is <HI>Evil,</HI> (the careless rovings, as well as deliberate work∣ings of the Mind are vicious and sinful,<HI>) Every</HI> Imagination is evil, is <HI>only</HI> evil, and that <HI>conti∣nually.</HI> This is the Indictment exhibited against Man, &amp; the Witness is infallible, unexceptionable. <HI>God saw it,</HI> — and God has said it, <HI>that</HI> God who judgeth righteous judgment, and whose Word is instead of a Thousand Witnesses, seeing it is im∣possible for God to lie. God is an <HI>Eye-Witness,</HI> He <HI>saw</HI> it. It is said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 53.2. God <HI>looked down</HI> from Heaven upon the Children of Men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God: and it follows in the 3d ver. <HI>They are altogether become filthy</HI>; so in the 1st ver. <HI>Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity.</HI> Men are by Nature <HI>corrupt,</HI> their noble Faculties are vitiated, and degenerated from their Original Constitution. The whole head is sick, the whole heart is faint, there is no soundness in them, nothing but bruises and putrifying sores. Their wounds stink and are corrupt▪ They are all over an unclean thing, and as for their Nativity, in the day they were born, they were cast out in the open field to the loathing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Persons, weltring in their own Blood, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole Spirit, Soul and Body filled with a loathsome Disease; They are altogether become filthy, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; <HI>stinking,</HI> as it might be translated. Whatsoever e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ternal neatness, or spiritual purity some pretending Sinners may boast of, it is certain, their Nature is so overspread with abominations of desolation, that they are a loathsome stench in the Nostrils of the holy God, and an odious Spectacle to Angels. They are abominable and to

every good work reprobate. Their whole Man is defiled, They are full of Sin against the Holy One of Israel, full of the abominable thing, which His Soul hateth. The rational Powers have lost their moral rectitude, simplicity and order, and are under a deplorable Metamorphosis, miserably dis∣figur'd and degraded. The <HI>Understanding,</HI> the Eye of the Soul, has lost its Divine Light and Influence, and is benighted under a Vail of thick Clouds and Aegyptian darkness. The <HI>Will</HI> having lost its first governing principle and true native liberty, is contracted and confined to debasing and defiling objects, fastned &amp; fetter'd in the most ignominious servitude, is impotent &amp; repugnant to that which is Good, but strongly inclin'd to that which is Evil. The <HI>Affections</HI> &amp; <HI>Passions</HI> have broke the restraints of Reason, &amp; cast off the reins of the Divine Law, are impetuous, imperious, &amp; rove with∣out controll.

means of them, the Soul is often taken in the Snare of the Devil, wounded by his fiery Darts, and led Captive in the paths of the Destroyer. And which is the emphasis of this infamous misery, the Sinner is contented in it, and pleased with the bondage of Corruption.</P>
<P>NOW the Foundation of this deplorable Change in Mans Nature was laid in the first and grand Apostacy. The deadly poison of the first Sin has shed a virulent tincture, an impure taint into the blood of all Nations, and Persons on the face of the whole Earth. This doleful defilement and deformity was brought on our Nature by the first Transgression, which was a common guilt, &amp; of universal influence, reaching all Mankind, and transmitting an unavoidable, and habitual stain to the whole humane Race. And this arises from the <HI>Relation,</HI> which we all bear to the first Sin∣ner, i.e. <HI>Adam.</HI> We derive Original Sin, consider'd as a <HI>Disease,</HI> from him, <HI>naturally,</HI> as he was our common <HI>Parent:</HI> and consider'd as part of the <HI>Curse, meritoriously,</HI> as He was our common <HI>Repre∣sentative.</HI>—Adam was the Protoplast, and the Root of humane Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid.

Spring, no more do a pure Seed derive from im∣pure Progenitors. This is as impossible, as to gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles. <HI>A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruits,</HI> Mat. 7.18. <HI>Whatsoever is born of the flesh, is flesh,</HI> Joh. 3.6. Corruption and carnality is fast rooted and woven into the very Being of Man, and toge∣ther with that descends to us by natural conse∣quence▪ and necessary succession. We are born of the flesh, and of the flesh we reap corruption. With our natural Body, we receive from our Parents the Body of Sin and Death. Original Corruption is called the <HI>Body</HI> of Sin, because 'tis derived with our <HI>Bodies</HI> to us, and chiefly reigns in the members of the Body; and it is termed <HI>Flesh,</HI> partly, and principally because it is convey'd by <HI>carnal</HI> propagation. It is called the <HI>Old-Man,</HI> because 'tis primitively deriv'd from Adam, the <HI>First Man,</HI> and in the way of natural Generation devolves even upon latest Posterity. It is one immutable and eternal Rule in Nature, that <HI>Every Creature beget its like,</HI> and that not only in regard of the same <HI>Genus</HI> or <HI>Species,</HI> but also of the par∣ticular <HI>Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions</HI> that are appropriate and prae∣dominant. This is obvious in the various sorts of Animals in the World, they all hold the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stin∣guishing complection of their princip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d "retain the <HI>vein</HI> of their Original, the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty</HI> of their Extraction". Thus a Leopard does not only convey its general nature, (and so beget in∣differently any Brute-Creature,) but also conveys its own <HI>peculiar</HI> properties, and eminent cha∣racters, which make it Offspring like unto itself. So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man conveys to his Posterity not meerly the humane Nature in general, but also the adven∣titious
<PB N="10" REF="002024_0017_0FBA813185A1A680"/>
qualities, and impressions, that eminently affect it. A <HI>sinful</HI> Man produces not only a <HI>Man,</HI> a <HI>rational Animal</HI> like himself; but a <HI>sinful</HI> Man, like himself, corrupt and depraved. Hence we are told, <HI>Gen.</HI> 5.3. That Adam begat a Son in <HI>his own Likeness,</HI> after <HI>his Image</HI>; and call'd his Name Seth. By this here is not to be understand barely a likeness in respect of <HI>natural frame,</HI> and external form; This is too trivial a Thing to be bro't in so solemnly as 'tis here, and besides, it should seem more proper to have made this remark at the Nativity of <HI>Cain,</HI> or <HI>Abel,</HI> the first born of <HI>Adam,</HI> rather than of <HI>Seth,</HI> betwen whom and them, many Births (no doubt) inter∣ven'd: it must therefore be understood of the <HI>corruption</HI> of Adams Nature, and the aim of the Holy Ghost in this observation was to acquaint us with the <HI>Entail</HI> of this infection upon the na∣tural Descendents of Adam; Hence, it was reserved 'till the birth of <HI>that</HI> Son, in whose Progeny the <HI>Species</HI> was to be continu'd, and the Covenant to be entail'd, and this was <HI>Seth,</HI> thro' whom the Line went down to <HI>Noah,</HI> who after the Flood (in which all the Old World perisht, except his Family, con∣sisting of Eight Persons) was the Primogenitour of Mankind, and from whose Son <HI>Shem</HI> the Church of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was propagated, and the <HI>Promised Seed</HI> ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y lineal Descent. Of that Great and Holy M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Seth,</HI> 'tis observ'd, he was <HI>born in Sin,</HI> even as <HI>Cain,</HI> that wicked one, (the Sanctifying Grace of God alone making a difference) and that "this meaning of the words might not be over∣look't, there is an emphatical repetition of the same thing; Adam begat a Son <HI>in his own Like∣ness, after his Image</HI>". The Image wherein <HI>Seth</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="002024_0018_0FBA8132EC9FBC90"/>
was begotten, the Image of <HI>Adam,</HI> seems p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly to be spoken of by way of Antithesis or opposition to the Image wherein <HI>Adam</HI> was created, the Image of <HI>God.</HI> The <HI>Divine</HI> Image chiefly consisted in knowledge, and true holiness, but he lost these moral qualities, &amp; contracted the Reverse, which the Holy Ghost here calls <HI>his own Likeness</HI>; in <HI>this</HI> Image <HI>Seth</HI> is said to be begotten, intimating his receiving a corrupt Nature from Adam, and this being particularly observed of <HI>Seth,</HI> who was the common Progenitor of the whole succeeding Race of Mankind, intimates that the Contagion would spread, and the depravation, in which he himself was born, would be <HI>haereditary,</HI> and as a walking Pestilence hand down it's malignity from Father to Son, even to the End of the World.</P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>Moral Head</HI> of all Man∣kind, descending from him by ordinary Genera∣tion. He was our common Proxy or Deputy, and had a power to chuse &amp; act, not only for himself, but for his universal Progeny. All Mankind were radically in him as their natural Original, and virtually in him as their Surety, Surrogate, or Vicegerent; By him they were all to stand, or in him to fall.</P>
<P>HERE we must note, that <HI>Adam</HI> tho' created in a state of <HI>Innocency,</HI> yet was not fixed in a state of absolute <HI>impeccability.</HI> Tho' perfect Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess was a <HI>natural</HI> and concreate excellency, and he had an innate power necessarily consequent upon his primitive constitution, as well as superna∣tural ability to have perform'd compleat obe∣dience, and have prevented his Apostacy, yet it was such as properly belong'd to a rational free Agent, in a state of probation, and was no ways,
<PB N="12" REF="002024_0019_0FBA81346C040D18"/>
inconsistent with that moral freedom of will, which put him into a state of mutability, and ex∣posed him to the efficacy of sinful temptations, and render'd him capable of rewards &amp; punishments.</P>
<P>AND accordingly it pleased God to treat him, <HI>as such,</HI> in a <HI>Faederal</HI> way; entering into a Co∣venant with Adam, as standing in a publick capacity and personating all his Descendents, wherein He promised Life, and threatned Death. And besides the invariable <HI>moral</HI> Law, internal and subjective to his reasonable nature, it pleased God to make trial of Adams obedience by a par∣ticular <HI>positive</HI> external Prohibition, in a matter of pure indifference antecedently to the Divine Precept, but becoming obligatory meerly by the will of the Lawgiver. This prohibition was, that he shou'd <HI>not eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> Gen. 2.16. And this special Command was of the same obligation, &amp; guarded with the same Sanctions, as the Eternal Law of Creation. The <HI>giving</HI> of it, was a mark of <HI>Sovereign</HI> Dominion, and the <HI>observing</HI> of it would have been a reasonable Service, &amp; most <HI>refin'd</HI> obedience.</P>
<P>BUT Adam (to the just astonishment of Heaven and Earth) thro' unaccountable carelesness was decoy'd by the insinuating Tempter into rebellion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruin. Being drawn by Satans Lures, he strangely revolted from God, leap'd the boundaries of the Divine Law, and brake thro' all restraints and preservatives, and did voluntarily eat of the forbidden Fruit. Now this rebellious transgression in its nature contain'd a violation of the whole Law, an entire renunciation of God, &amp; embracing the Creature as the chief Good, and Satan as the best Master. Hence the habit of Original righte∣ousness
<PB N="13" REF="002024_0020_0FBA8135DF5A9C80"/>
was lost, &amp; all moral excellencies effaced and extinguisht, and an universal permanent corruption and foul deformity introduced, by a judicial act of God as a part of the Curse, and punishment of the first Sin. And now this Ori∣ginal corruption and degeneracy, consider'd as a punishment, is <HI>meritoriously</HI> derived from Adam, and "falls under the ordination of divine Justice". It is not only a fatal Legacy left us by our First Parents, but a <HI>Divine Curse</HI> entailed upon us. All Mankind were legally Parties in the faederal transaction with Adam in innocency, and were understood to be virtually Accomplices in his Rebellion; hence his transgression was not ap∣propriate and meerly personal, but a common Guilt, a Sin of the whole Nature and universal Race; And the Punishment has a proportionable extent and adaquate comprehension. Hence <HI>Spiritual Death</HI> which is one part of the Curse, and the wages of Sin, is the unavoidable Lot of all the Children of Adam, thro' the righteous Judgment of God. Our First Parents sinned and are not, and we have born their iniquity; God visits the iniquity of the Father upon the Children from Generation to Generation. All the unhappy Descendents of Adam do taste the sowre fruits of his Apostacy, and inherit the foul impurity of his Nature; and that <HI>justly,</HI> without any breach upon the Laws of common Equity: For, That which is allowable and unrebukable in the Gods of the Earth, is much more so in the Great GOD of Heaven, whose Kingdom ruleth over all, and a Scepter of righteousness is the Scepter of His Kingdom. There can be no colour of pretence to impeach the Government of Injustice barely
<PB N="14" REF="002024_0021_0FBA813D797F6BE0"/>
for permitting Children to suffer such Evils, as are but the punishment of their Fathers Sins, wisely and justly allotted to them by the Laws, which they are subject unto. The Publick Authority is not satisfy'd (for instance) with the punishment of <HI>Treason</HI> in the single Person of the Rebel alone, but his Estate is confiscated, his Dignities forfeited, his Blood stain'd, and nothing but ignominy and poverty descends to the uncon∣senting Heirs, by virtue of some humane Consti∣tution. And after this, what can we object, what room have we to dispute the Divine Justice in the communication of Original Sin, to the Posterity of Adam, since they, being in his Loins as their Parent, and in his Covenant as their Represen∣tative, are interested in the guilt of his first Transgression? Being thus <HI>entitul'd</HI> to the Penalty, it is <HI>justly inflicted</HI> upon them. Therefore with the Apostle we must believe with our hearts, and confess with our mouths, That <HI>in Adam all die, By one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all have sinned. By the offence of one, judgment came upon all Men to condemnation, and by one Man's disobedience, many were made Sinners,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.22. Rom. 5.12, 18, 9. We must every one acknow∣ledge with the Psalmist, (Psal. 51.5.) <HI>Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> All Mankind agree in their native pravity, "whatsoever difference there may be in their Climates, Colours", and outward Circumstances. This Spiritual Death not only reigned from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> but it is an Epidemical Plague, that reaches all Men to the latest period of the World.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="002024_0022_0FBA8142D3A50D80"/>2. <HI>THIS Original Corruption is the Seminary and Principle of all Actual Sins.</HI> This is the Womb that conceiveth vanity, &amp; bringeth forth iniquity, Mat. 15.18, 9. <HI>Out of the heart,</HI> i.e. as depraved, <HI>pro∣ceed evil tho'ts, murders, adulteries,</HI> and every evil work.

They are <HI>the works of the Flesh,</HI> (Gal. 5.19.)

<P N="3">3. <HI>THIS Corruption stains and defiles every Age of Life.</HI> It is a principle that is always stirring, never still; a Fountain ever flowing, and foaming out impurities.

<P>THERE is a Generation that have no sense of their Filth derived or contracted; They walk in the way of their own hearts, and In the fight of their own eyes; They are like the Swine that love to grovel in the dirt, and tumble in every filthy Kennel, They wallow in muddy sensuali∣ties as their Element, without desires of Purifi∣tion, and having no fear of God before them.</P>
<P>THERE is also a Generation, that are pure in their own eyes, and yet they are not cleansed to this day.

<P>PROP. II. <HI>IT greatly concerns Men in their Youth to get their Way Cleansed.</HI> This Proposition is grounded on the <HI>Psalmists</HI> great concern and sollicitous <HI>Enquiry, How Young Men might Cleanse their Way?</HI> Which shows the importance and necessity of it's being done. We may here Enquire into Two Things.</P>
<P>QUES. I. <HI>HOW</HI> are we to Cleanse our Way?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. <HI>UNIVERSALLY &amp; Intirely.</HI> Thus we're exhorted, 2 Cor. 7.1. <HI>Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit.</HI> So, <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.8. <HI>Cleanse your hands, and purify your hearts,</HI> i.e. all external actions, and internal motions— Our <HI>Language</HI> should be purify'd; our Mouth a Well of Life, affording sweet and pure waters. No <HI>corrupt communication</HI> may proceed out of our Lips, but <HI>our Speech should be with Grace, good to the use of edifying,</HI> that it may manifest Grace in us that speak, and minister Grace unto others that hear, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.29. —Yea, Our <HI>whole</HI> external <HI>Behaviour</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="002024_0026_0FBA814938A36F78"/>
should be purify'd; we s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould abandon every evil and false way, and become <HI>holy in all manner of conversation</HI> civil and religious; <HI>walking in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the Lord,</HI> in all duties Personal &amp; Relative, <HI>blameless as the Children of Light.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>above all,</HI> We shou'd see to it that the <HI>Spring</HI> of all be Cleansed, that we get a <HI>clean heart</HI> and a <HI>right spirit</HI> renewed within us. Pure Religion is founded in a pure Heart. We must <HI>purify our Souls</HI> in obeying the Truth—(1 Pet. 1.22.) If the Fountain be muddy all the Streams must needs partake of the infection. The Rule is, (Mat. 23.26.) <HI>Cleanse first that which is within, that the outside may be clean also.</HI> Unregenerate Mo∣rality is but <HI>the Leaven of the Pharisees, which is</HI> vile <HI>Hypocrisy.</HI> We are still in the state of carnal nature, and are but <HI>painted Sepulchres,</HI> unless all the powers of our Souls are washed in the Laver of spiritual Regeneration. We must not only cast away our <HI>Filthy rags,</HI> and put off the <HI>Garment spotted by the flesh,</HI> and cleanse our selves from outward visible pollutions, but must disgorge all carnal Lusts (those <HI>sweet morsels)</HI> in our foul Stomachs, and must put on the <HI>beauties</HI> of true <HI>holiness,</HI> and be moulded into the Image of Hea∣venly purity, else we are a loathsome stench, and abhorred spectacle to the <HI>Holy One of Israel.</HI> The <HI>way of the Heart,</HI> as well as the ways of the Lip and Life, is to be cleansed. Thus the work of self-purification must be Universal. The cleansing must be proportionable to the defilement; The Plaister as broad as the Sore. One filthy Lust, re∣maining in it's power, will be as <HI>a dead fly in the precious ointment,</HI> and make all unsavory.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002024_0027_0FBA814C2B9D8ED0"/><HI>A.</HI> 2. <HI>CONSTANTLY</HI> and <HI>Perseveringly.</HI> It is a work of daily revolution, and perpetual du∣ration. Undefiled Religion is attained gradually and by tract of time. Our brightest Graces, and best Duties have some alloy, some mixtures of impurity; and we contract much pollution in our daily walk through this defiling World, by unhappy falls and stumbles, and even they that are <HI>washed</HI> and made <HI>clean every whit,</HI> yet <HI>have need to wash their feet,</HI> (Joh. 13.10.) And it shou'd be the daily care even of the Regenerate, to be cleansing themselves from the remains of carna∣lity, and pressing after a more perfect purity.</P>
<P>THUS "the <HI>Extent</HI> of this purifying is com∣prehensive of the outward and inward Man, from sinful inclinations and vitious acts; and the <HI>Con∣tinuance</HI> of it must be, 'till we are cleansed from <HI>every spot, and become glorious in Holiness</HI>". Progress and Perseverance in this work is an invariable Character of Sincerity, and "the Crown of Christianity". We read, (Job. 17.9.) <HI>The righteous shall hold on his way, and he that bath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</HI> We have not only that Precept, (Isai. 1.16, 7.) <HI>Wash ye, make you clean, cease to do evil, learn to do well:</HI> but also that, (1 Tim. 5.22.) <HI>Keep thy self pure;—Continue in the way of well doing.</HI> The days of our Purification indeed must run parallel with the days of Life.</P>
<P>QUES. II. <HI>WHY</HI> do's it concern Men <HI>in their Youth</HI> thus to Cleanse their Way? To clear this Head, let us consider the following Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I. Consider, THAT <HI>Cleansing our Way is a Work of absolute necessity and everlasting conse∣quence.</HI> It is necessary in order to our acceptance with God here, and enjoyment of God hereafter.
<PB N="21" REF="002024_0028_0FBA814DB78CB400"/>
There is a firm and indissoluble connection be∣tween Holiness and true Happiness, which consists in the favour &amp; fruition of God, the Chief Good.</P>
<P N="1">(1) THERE is a <HI>Legal</HI> Necessity of Cleansing our Ways. A Necessity from the indispensable obligation of a Divine <HI>Precept,</HI> and the inviola∣ble constitution of the <HI>New Covenant. This is the will of God, even our Sanctification; God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness,</HI> (1 Thes. 4.3, 7.) This is prescrib'd and imposed, as the invariable Term of Salvation. <HI>Touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you,</HI> (2 Cor. 6.17.) <HI>Follow holiness without which no man shall see the Lord,</HI> (Heb. 12.14.) And this is a wise and just Establishment, necessary to secure the honour of God's Government, to <HI>magnify his Law, and de∣clare his righteousness.</HI> Who then may <HI>resist His Will?</HI></P>
<P>Again, (2.) THERE is a <HI>Moral</HI> Necessity. A Necessity from the Nature and Reason of the thing. The <HI>Unclean Sinner</HI> (while such) is ab∣solutely <HI>unfit</HI> for the Divine Favour, and utterly <HI>uncapable</HI> of Divine Blessedness. <HI>What fellowship can righteousness have with unrighteousness? What communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial?</HI> (2 Cor. 6.14.) The happiness of Man lies in communion with God, and the enjoyment of Him. But now the Sinner and Ungodly are excluded from this happiness by a moral incapacity. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w can Two walk together, except they be agreed?</HI> How can Two <HI>opposite</HI> tempers subsist together, without Eternal Jar∣rings? Mutual Endearments, and happy Corres∣pondence between one and another, are founded in a congruity of Natures, and a conformity of
<PB N="22" REF="002024_0029_0FBA8152D1C12698"/>
Inclinations. Unless then we are made <HI>Parta∣kers of the Divine Nature,</HI> it is utterly impossible for us to <HI>enjoy</HI> God, or <HI>stand in His sight</HI> with any contentment or satisfaction. And were we <HI>translated</HI> in a state of <HI>polluted</HI> Nature into the immediate <HI>presence</HI> of God, in which is <HI>the ful∣ness of Joy,</HI> it would be no better than an <HI>Hell</HI> unto us. The <HI>Entertainments</HI> of Heaven wou'd be nauseous and distasteful to us, not suiting the false relishes of vitiated Sense; The <HI>Employments</HI> of Heaven wou'd be a disagreeable and uneasy Task to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indisposed Powers. In a Word, The most irreconcileable contrarieties may as soon compromise or incorporate, as an unregenerate polluted Sinner obtain and enjoy the undefiled Inheritance in Light. Heaven <HI>moral</HI> (as one speaks) is an indispensable Qualification for Hea∣ven <HI>local.</HI> Into Jerusalem, which is above, that Holy City, <HI>enters nothing that defileth,</HI> (Rev. 21.27.) <HI>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place?

Consider this ye that forget God, and let no Man deceive you with vain words: <HI>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived,</HI> (1 Cor. 6.9,) The Cleansing of our Way is a matter (we see) of the highest Importance, and the last Ne∣cessity; <HI>Holiness</HI> ought then to be the subject of our <HI>principal</HI> and most serious care, and the ob∣ject of our most vigorous and <HI>early</HI> pursuits. <HI>This is the One Thing needful.</HI> Eternity depends upon it, an Eternity of weal or woe. A matter of this <HI>infinite</HI> concernment surely challenges our <HI>first</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="002024_0030_0FBA8155C1BBF070"/>
and chief regards. The <HI>great</HI> Interests of Eternity claim and deserve a <HI>prior</HI> consideration and <HI>su∣periour</HI> labour to secure them, than the <HI>low</HI> and <HI>little</HI> concernments of this transitory Life. How <HI>foolish</HI> then are they, how wildly do they act, who mispend the <HI>best</HI> of their Time in <HI>serving di∣vers Lusts,</HI> and terminate the Cares of their blooming Youth on this perishing World, <HI>who mind Earthly things,</HI> and <HI>neglect the Great Salva∣tion?</HI> But how <HI>wise</HI> are they, that <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God, and his righteousness,</HI> That make it their <HI>first</HI> and great care and endeavour to <HI>work out their own Salvation,</HI> That employ the <HI>first</HI> opportunities of Life to <HI>make their Calling and Election sure?</HI>—Who then among you is willing to <HI>consecrate his Service this Day</HI> unto the Lord? These things should quicken all <HI>from the womb of the Morning,</HI> even the beginning of their days, to devote the <HI>Dew of their Youth,</HI> their earliest affections to the Lord, and to begin <HI>betimes</HI> to Cleanse their ways. Is it not a work of the greatest weight and moment? What Business or Con∣cern is there that may be set in opposition to, or stand in competition with it? Say not then, <HI>I pray thee have me excused,</HI> on any pretence whatsoever. The <HI>necessity</HI> and <HI>excellency</HI> of the work, speaks the <HI>unreasonableness</HI> and <HI>baseness</HI> of delays.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> II. Consider, <HI>THIS Life is the only space, or season for the accomplishment of this Work.</HI> "This World is the great Laboratory for perfecting Souls for Heaven", the only state of prob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion and preparation for Eternity. If <HI>ever</HI> we Cleanse our ways, it must be <HI>now. There is no wisdom, nor device in the Grave, whether we are going,</HI> (Eccl. 9.

10.) <HI>The Night cometh, wherein no man can work,</HI> (Joh. 9.4.) <HI>This is the day of Salvation,</HI> (2 Cor. 6.2.) <HI>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for the truth; the Living, the Living they shall praise thee,</HI> (Isai. 38.18, 9.) <HI>To him that is joyned to the Living, there is hope,</HI> To him only. — <HI>Death</HI> puts an <HI>irre∣vocable</HI> period to the Day and Means of Grace, to the Strivings of the Holy Spirit, and the Offers of Salvation: It seals us up among the <HI>irrepa∣rable</HI> Ruins of the Apostacy, and fixes us under an <HI>Eternal impossibility</HI> of Recovery. <HI>As the Tree falls, so it must lye.</HI> The Spirits in Prison, shall not come forth, until they have paid the utmost Farthing. They are bound in Chains of darkness, which cannot be broken; They are under a Yoke of Bondage, that can't be shaken off.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> III. Consider, <HI>THE Work is Great, and the longest Life is not more than proportionable to it.</HI> Cleansing our Ways is <HI>not</HI> some <HI>light</HI> and <HI>easy</HI> Business, the work of an <HI>hour</HI> or a <HI>day.</HI> It is a <HI>Complication</HI> of <HI>great Services</HI> to be done, and of <HI>great Difficulties</HI> to be overcome. It is an <HI>hard</HI> work, <HI>many</HI> acts, <HI>many</HI> exercises are imply'd in it, <HI>enough</HI> to employ the <HI>whole Man</HI> in its <HI>best</HI> vigour, and to fill up the <HI>whole Life</HI> in its <HI>longest</HI> duration. In order to pure Religion, we must <HI>search and try our ways,</HI> and be much in <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> We must act <HI>Repentance</HI> towards God, and <HI>Faith</HI> towards our Lord Jesus Christ, which are <HI>laborious</HI> as well as constant Exercises; And we must lay out our selves in the work of <HI>Mortification</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> the <HI>well-doing</HI> of which will require our <HI>utmost</HI> Industry, Vigilance, and Resolution, and challenge some <HI>Tract</HI> of Time. Solemn <HI>Resolutions</HI> are to be <HI>form'd</HI> and <HI>fixt,
<PB N="25" REF="002024_0032_0FBA8159039075D8"/>
Knowledge</HI> to be <HI>digg'd</HI> for, strong <HI>Prejudices</HI> and <HI>Corruptions</HI> to be <HI>conquer'd,</HI> ill <HI>Customs</HI> to be <HI>re∣nounc'd,</HI> subtil <HI>Temptations</HI> to be <HI>resisted,</HI> and strong <HI>oppositions</HI> to be <HI>encounter'd.</HI> Finally, Many and divers <HI>Duties</HI> to be put in practice, and acts of positive obedience performed, A large Field of work to be gone thorow, and many a weary step to be taken. We had need then enter into it <HI>be∣times,</HI> rise <HI>early, take the wings of the Morning,</HI> and go forth to labour until the Night, rejoycing with the Sun to run our race. The Task is hard, and many holy Christians that have <HI>fear'd the Lord from their Youth,</HI> spent their <HI>Vigorous</HI> Age in this work, and <HI>continued</HI> in it, even unto <HI>Length of Days,</HI> have <HI>after all</HI> their Toil &amp; long Labours, <HI>not counted themselves to have apprehended, neither to be already perfect,</HI> but have professed to <HI>reach towards things before,</HI> and confessed very humbling <HI>Remains</HI> of impurity both of Flesh &amp; Spirit behind still to be cleansed away. They that begin <HI>soonest</HI> are but <HI>scarcely saved.</HI> We must confess then, that great is the <HI>guilt</HI> and <HI>folly</HI> of such as <HI>delay</HI> this most necessary and difficult work, flattering them∣selves that they shall have <HI>Time enough hereafter.</HI> Most are apt to dream, they've a <HI>long Day</HI> before 'em, and so may safely give a loose for the <HI>pre∣sent</HI> to their Youthful Lusts, and hope to do this work, <HI>at their Leisure,</HI> in more <HI>advanced</HI> Years:— But alas! the <HI>entire</HI> Life of Man is but a <HI>little</HI> space for such a Business of <HI>Eternal</HI> consequence, and <HI>Infinite</HI> difficulty. Not but that the Time allow'd is <HI>sufficient,</HI> if we had but wisdom to Husband our opportunities aright: yet it is not <HI>more</HI> than is requisite in order to do this work to the <HI>lest ad∣vantage.</HI>—Is it not then most egregious folly
<PB N="26" REF="002024_0033_0FBA815B58603C00"/>
to think of crowding that into a <HI>narr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w corner</HI> of our Day, which will take up the <HI>whole.</HI> O think of the greatness of your Work, and the shortness of your Day, and judge whether it be not time to begin, and folly to defer.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IV. Consider, <HI>Youth is the fittest and most advantagious Season to begin this workin.</HI> Consider, <HI>Now the work it self is really less, than it will be afterward.</HI> The work is <HI>always</HI> great and difficult, but by <HI>Age</HI> it <HI>grows</HI> upon us; <HI>more</HI> work is made for <HI>Self-Examination, Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Mortification.</HI> Sins are multiply'd, Corruptions are strengthned, the Understanding more darkned, the Heart more hardned thro' the deceitfulness of Sin, the sen∣sual Appetites &amp; Passions grown more headstrong by customary indulgence, the Cords of Iniquity twisted harder, the black Chains of Lust fastned and more difficult to be dissolved, the Conscience more defiled with dead works, deeper pollutions con∣tracted, and more heavy loads of filth to be dis∣burthen'd, when we have lain long soaking in our corrupt state; Spiritual Diseases more putrify'd and harder to be cured. By long and inveterate <HI>Custom</HI> Sin grows more <HI>natural</HI> to us, &amp; we are re∣duc'd almost to an impossibility of recovery. Hence the Scripture saith, (Jer. 13.23.) <HI>Can the Aethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? Then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</HI> When ill Habits are obstinately <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oted</HI> by frequent and continu'd repetition of Sin, there is <HI>unspeaka∣ble difficulty</HI> attending the extirpation of them. How <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>painful</HI> a work to repent of them and subdue them! In <HI>this Case</HI> we may very aptly apply those sayings of our Saviour, <HI>It is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of the Needle;
<PB N="27" REF="002024_0034_0FBA815D65506DE0"/>
Straight is the Gate; With Men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible!</HI> Thus the <HI>Work</HI> is made greater and more difficult by delays. Moreover, <HI>in Youth our advantages are greater; then</HI> we have <HI>special</HI> Helps, Opportunities and Conveniencies. If we <HI>now</HI> begin our work, we have in an ordinary way <HI>more Time</HI> before us to do it in. And <HI>now</HI> the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> is peculiar∣ly striving with us; the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Lord most forward to come to the <HI>Pool,</HI> and <HI>move the Waters</HI> of healing; And <HI>Youth</HI> is the <HI>Age of Discipline,</HI> most capable of Instruction, most flexible to Convictions, most susceptible of Impressions. Now the Understanding is ordinarily most ready and perceptive, the Will most obsequious, the Affecti∣ons and Passions most governable, the Memory most deeply receptive as well as strongly reten∣tive, and all the Faculties of Life most apt and able for Service and Employment. For <HI>Youth</HI> is the Age of <HI>Business,</HI> (as well as tractableness,) the Morning of our day, the Excellency of our strength, the Spring of Life, most <HI>free</HI> and <HI>vigorous</HI> for <HI>La∣bour,</HI> dispos'd to Action, and admirable at dis∣patch. Now the Faculties of Soul and Body are in their prime, most capable of bearing the diffi∣culties and doing the duties, that attend the work of Sanctification.—Is it not besotting <HI>folly</HI> then, to <HI>defer</HI> cleansing our ways, and <HI>let slip</HI> this <HI>Golden</HI> Opportunity, and make that the task of drooping Sickness, or supine tottering Age, which demands the most sanguine Efforts of sprightly Health and active Youth? But further, <HI>Youth</HI> is more under the checks of <HI>Conscience,</HI> and the restraints of <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Modesty,</HI> which are a good <HI>Barrier</HI> to secure us <HI>against</HI> Sin, and a mighty
<PB N="28" REF="002024_0035_0FBA815E484B5638"/>
<HI>Help</HI> to reclaim us <HI>from</HI> it. And moreover, in <HI>Youth</HI> we have commonly <HI>fewer Incumbrances</HI> &amp; <HI>less im∣pediments</HI> to clog us in doing our work. <HI>Now</HI> we are not so enslav'd to the <HI>Prince of Darkness</HI>; the <HI>soul Spirit, that works in the Children of Disobedi∣ence,</HI> has not ordinarily such a <HI>full</HI> possession of us, nor <HI>absolute</HI> dominion over us as yet, and now his Temptations have not so easy access, and his assaults may with less difficulty be warded off, by the discrete, vigilant and resolute Youth; And further, <HI>Now</HI> we are not ordinarily <HI>so far</HI> plung'd into the <HI>World</HI>; we are not so much ex∣pos'd to the <HI>Cares</HI> of discouraging <HI>Want,</HI> nor the <HI>Snares</HI> of treacherous <HI>Affluence,</HI> nor the <HI>burries</HI> of perplexing <HI>Business.</HI> And by an <HI>Early</HI> Conver∣sion and Consecration of our selves to <HI>God,</HI> we shall greatly <HI>forestall</HI> our tempting <HI>Adversaries,</HI> and <HI>save</HI> our selves many Conflicts, <HI>recover</HI> our selves from the Snare of the Devil, and <HI>escape</HI> the Corruptions that are in the World thro' Lust.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> V. Consider, <HI>THE Time of Youth, the present Time, may, for ought we know, be the only Season allow'd us for this work.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Arrests of <HI>Death</HI> may <HI>soon</HI> irrecoverably <HI>terminate</HI> all our <HI>Opportunities. The Time is short,</HI> and very <HI>uncertain</HI>; Death <HI>will speedily,</HI> He <HI>may suddenly,</HI> serve the Execution upon us: And Death's Commission is not dated by <HI>Seniority</HI>; Mortality is not govern'd by the course of Nature, but the Ordination of Heaven. The warm Blood and vigour of healthful Youth is no protection against the King of Terrors. When <HI>the Decree brings forth, None can stay his hand, No Man hath power over his Spirit to retain it.</HI> How often do we see invincible Death making a <HI>Prey of the mighty,</HI>

Some unkindly Breath of Air may <HI>in an instant</HI> extinguish the light of Life, when it is like to burn a long while yet. Unnumber'd <HI>Dis∣eases,</HI> we are subject to, that may speedily stop our breath; we know not but some <HI>fatal</HI> Distem∣per is <HI>now</HI> latent in our Bodies, however hale and lusty we may seem, which will <HI>shortly</HI> break down the clayey Tabernable, and gather us again unto the Dust; and a Thousand <HI>Disasters,</HI> many unforeseen Casualties we are obnoxious to, any <HI>one</HI> of which may <HI>quickly</HI> dispatch our unwilling Souls into an awful Eternity, and <HI>in a moment</HI> bury us in despairful horror! And most surely they, <HI>Whose Life is among the Unclean,</HI> may ex∣pect to <HI>Die in Youth,</HI> and not to <HI>Live out half their Days!</HI> By their Lusts and Vices they are <HI>hasten∣ing</HI> their end, jogging the Glass, and preparing the <HI>Instruments of Death</HI> for themselves; and a Thousand to One if they are not <HI>snar'd in the work of their own hands,</HI> or snatcht away in an awful manner by some surprizing &amp; unexpected Providence!</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Dangerous</HI> then are <HI>Delays</HI> of our Great Work! To depend on <HI>Hereafter</HI> is to "presume meerly on a remote possibility", and to hazard our Eternal safety on the most precarious bottom in the World, and if this sandy Foundation fail us, we sink into irretrievable Misery. Let us no longer then trifle away our pretious and hasty moments. Let us not flatter our selves with the

<P N="2">2. OR, Some <HI>Distemper</HI> may utterly <HI>bereave</HI> us of our <HI>Capacity</HI> for this work.

May not an <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> or, <HI>Lethargy,</HI> a <HI>Delirium</HI> or <HI>Stupor,</HI> suddenly seize us, that we shall become as 'twere <HI>Dead, while we Live?</HI> May we not be bewildred with <HI>Melancholy,</HI> or distracted with <HI>Madness?</HI> May we not be harrass't with tor∣menting <HI>Pains,</HI> and restless <HI>Agonies,</HI> that shall

And now what claim have <HI>we</HI> to a <HI>priviledge</HI> from this awful Judgment?

punish us with <HI>a Famine of the word of the Lord, remove his Candlestick,</HI> pull down his Tabernacle, and leave us to <HI>perish</HI> for <HI>lack of Vision.</HI> Or, if God <HI>continues</HI> the external <HI>Means,</HI> yet He may be provok'd to <HI>with-hold</HI> the influences of His <HI>Spirit</HI>; and so we shall <HI>receive the Grace of God in vain,</HI> and enjoy the Means but in Judgment.

And hence the Apostle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> exhorts them, (Heb. 3.7, &amp;c,) <HI>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as your Fathers tempted me, with whom I was grieved, and so I sware in my wrath, they should not enter into my r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.</HI>— But why <HI>to Day?</HI> Is it only because our <HI>Lives</HI> are <HI>uncertain,</HI>

and we may die before to Morrow? <HI>No,</HI> but <HI>lest we provoke God to swear in his Wrath, that we shall not enter into rest.</HI> It shou'd engage us to a speedy Repentance, to consider, that we may provoke God to such a degree, that He may pronounce the final Sentence on us, That we shall never enter into Heaven; <HI>long before</HI> we leave this World.</Q></P>
<P>THE Day of God's <HI>Forbearance</HI> often survives the Day of His <HI>Mercy.</HI> Sometimes He <HI>endures with much long suffering the Vessels of Wrath</HI>; but frequently He <HI>cuts short His Work in Righteousness</HI>; and the <HI>brighter</HI> any One's Day of Grace is, (it's observed) 'tis usually the <HI>shorter.</HI> The <HI>Old World</HI> God spared an Hundred &amp; Twenty Years, but <HI>Israel,</HI> whom He had favour'd above all the Fa∣milies of the Earth, giving His Word unto Ja∣cob, He endured their manners but Forty Years in the Wilderness. The Lord do's gradually with∣draw His grieved Spirit and neglected Grace from rebellious Sinners, and finally abandons them to a reprobate sense, intumulates their forsaken Souls under judicial blindness and hardness in their frozen Grave; That is the fatal Sentence passed against them, <HI>Let him that is filthy, be filthy still,</HI> (Rev. 22.11.) <HI>Because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, Thou shalt not be purged any more from thy filthiness, 'till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee,</HI> (Ezek. 24.13.)

We read but of One that was call'd at the Eleventh hour. If a Tree do not blossom in the Spring, it is commonly dead all the Year after; So they that are not Converted in the Spring of their Age are rarely Converted at all. Now &amp; then</HI> One <HI>is Converted in Old Age, but such Examples are exceeding rare; especially it is true with respect unto those that have in the Days of their Youth lived under the Means of Grace, heard

many Sermons, experienced frequent Strivings of the Spirit of God with their hearts: if they remain Unconverted until the Days of their Youth are past and gone, the Lord usually giveth them up to judicial hardness of heart that they shall never be Converted, never Saved. Young Men think sadly of it in the fear of God".</HI> O hearken to this solemn warning, consider &amp; improve it; Beware of Delays; <HI>Quench not the Spirit, Resist not alway the Holy Ghost,</HI> Do not at any time say unto Him, <HI>Go away and come again to Morrow,</HI> lest you Sin away the Influences of the Spirit; <HI>O do not this abominable thing which the Lord hates,</HI> lest <HI>the Spirit of the Lord depart from you, and an evil Spirit from the Lord trouble you. Be instructed,</HI> O Seed of Jacob, <HI>lest his Soul depart from you, lest be make you desolate</HI>; lest you un∣happily incur the condemnation of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> He <HI>is joyned to Idols, let him alone.— O seek the Lord while he may be found,</HI> (Isai. 55.6.) <HI>They that seek him early shall find him,</HI> (Prov. 8.17.) <HI>But if thou for∣sake him</HI> in the time of Youth, perhaps <HI>He will cast thee off for ever,</HI> (1 Chr. 28.9.) It is a <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>bloody adventure</HI> in sinful Youth, a <HI>dreadful risque</HI> they run, to forego the <HI>present</HI> Opportunity upon the false presumption of <HI>a mere convenient Season</HI> hereafter. We are all of Us probably <HI>within</HI> our limited Day of Grace: But how <HI>soon,</HI> how <HI>sud∣denly</HI> our <HI>Sun</HI> may <HI>set,</HI> God only knows. The <HI>present</HI> time may be our <HI>last</HI> Opportunity; and to expect <HI>renew'd</HI> offers of Grace upon the least <HI>re∣fusal</HI> or <HI>delay</HI> to accept, is not founded in any Di∣vine <HI>Promise</HI> and is repugnant to the universal Tenor of the Divine <HI>Threatnings.</HI> We stand every moment upon the <HI>Brink</HI> of perdition, <HI>nigh unto Cursing</HI>; How know we, but that our <HI>Eternal</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="002024_0043_0FBA8171D170EF70"/>
concernments <HI>depend</HI> upon what we are this <HI>E∣vening,</HI> this <HI>Instant</HI> a doing? How know we, but that the revolution of a few hours or minutes will irreversibly conclude our day of probation? — It is <HI>high time to awake unto Righteousness, to consi∣der our ways and turn our feet unto God's testimonies.</HI> Young Men, my Brethren, <HI>hearken to the voice of God, and no longer harden your hearts</HI> against the impressions of His Grace, and the solemn Invita∣tions of His <HI>Word, which speaks to you,</HI> to each of you, <HI>My Son, give me thy heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways,</HI> (Prov. 23.26.) <HI>Wash thy heart from thy wickedness, that thou mayest be saved, how long shall thy vain tho'ts lodge within thee?</HI> (Jer. 4.14.) <HI>Do this now my Son, and deliver thy self, Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eye-lids; if thou save not thy life to night, perhaps to morrow thou shalt be slain.</HI> Procrastination is infinitely dangerous. The least delay may cost us our Souls. <HI>Let us fear lest we c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me short, and look diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God,</HI> (Heb. 12.15.)</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VI. Consider, <HI>TO begin this work in our Youth, is what the Great God requires of us, and is infinite∣ly pleased with in us.</HI> God is our Creator, Pre∣server, and Sovereign Ruler. We owe Him all possible Homage. We are under the most invio∣lable Bonds of obedience to His revealed Will. <HI>Now God commandeth all men every where to repent,</HI> (Act. 17.30.) And by virtue of this <HI>general</HI> Precept we are obliged to repent <HI>immediately,</HI> without delay. <HI>It is a Maxim in Law,</HI> (as One in a certain place testifyeth) <HI>that where no day of Payment is limited, the Debt is presently due.</HI> The Debt of <HI>Repentance toward God</HI> is according to this just principle to be paid <HI>forthwith,</HI> tho' there were
<PB N="37" REF="002024_0044_0FBA817367CF8B28"/>
not any express and direct specification of the time of Youth. But we have the most plain and peremptory injunctions of <HI>Early Obedience.</HI> We are not left to our liberty as to the <HI>time,</HI> any more than as to the <HI>thing.</HI> He that has bidden us to repent and amend our ways, has also bid us do it <HI>now, betimes</HI>; and there is the same obligation upon us to take the <HI>Time,</HI> as to do the <HI>Work,</HI> He hath set us. Well then, Young Men are indis∣pensably bound to regard and obey those Precepts, wherein they are positively and strictly com∣manded <HI>to be sober &amp; pious betimes:</HI> As, Psal 148.12, 3 <HI>Young Men, and Children, Let them praise the name of the Lord.</HI> So, Prov. 8.32, &amp;c. <HI>Now hearken unto me, O ye Children; Hear instruction, and be wise.</HI> So, Eccl. 12.1. <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</HI> So, ver. 12, 3. <HI>And further, by these words of truth, my Son, be admonished</HI> of the vanity of the World, and the evil of Sin, and <HI>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter, Fear God &amp; keep his commandments: for this is the whole</HI> duty and happiness <HI>of man.</HI> And to mention but one instance more; 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2— The Apostle exhorts <HI>Timothy</HI> and in him all other Young Men, in this wise, <HI>Flee youthful lusts, but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with all them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Thou therefore my Son, be strong in the Grace, that is in Christ Jesus. Study to shew thy self approved unto God.</HI> Thus <HI>Early</HI> Religion is enjoyned upon Us by the Commands of God. And as it is a necessary <HI>compliance</HI> with His Preceptive will, so it is most highly <HI>pleasing</HI> and infinitely delightful unto Him, which consideration should excite us to it. <HI>Behold, now is the accepted Time, now is the acceptable Year of the Lord.</HI> It was an
<PB N="38" REF="002024_0045_0FBA817D6ED17558"/>
Ordinance of Old, Exod. 22.29. <HI>Thou shalt not de∣lay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, The first born thou shalt give unto me.</HI> The first-ripe Fruits (in kind) are ordinarily among Men most valued, and most eagerly embrac'd. The First-born is the pride of nature, the beginning of strength, and the ex∣cellency of dignity. These God expected should be dedicated to Him, and that <HI>without delay:</HI> which under a Typical consideration do's plainly intimate, that Young Men should <HI>not delay</HI> to consecrate the <HI>First Fruits</HI> of their Time, the <HI>prime</HI> and <HI>best</HI> of their <HI>strength</HI> to the Lord. <HI>With such sacrifices God is well pleased, The Lord accepts them with a sweet savour.</HI> The <HI>kindnesses of our Youth</HI> (the Flower of Age) are what He takes infinite complacency in. The Blossoms of Early Piety how lovely, how fragrant are they to Him! The <HI>tender Plants</HI> that are <HI>growing up before the Lord,</HI> what a grateful and pleasant sight▪ The Delight of Heaven, and the Hope of Israel! Such as fear the Lord in their Youth are <HI>acceptable to God,</HI> and <HI>approved of Men. Good Men</HI> have <HI>no greater joy</HI> than to see their <HI>Children walking in the truth. There is joy in the presence of the Holy Angels over</HI> such. The <HI>Lord of Glory</HI> takes pleasure in them; <HI>His delights are with the Sons of Men.</HI> He was well pleased (in the days of His Flesh) with the <HI>Ho∣sannahs</HI> of <HI>Children,</HI> and took particular notice of them, giving Glory to God, who <HI>Out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings had perfected praise.</HI> He was <HI>pleased,</HI> to have <HI>Little Children come unto Him, and He took them up in His Arms and blessed them. As a good Shepherd He gathers the Lambs with His Arms, and carries them in His Bosom,</HI> the Seat of Love. What an affectionate Concern did He express, and
<PB N="39" REF="002024_0046_0FBA81800478FD30"/>
what a compassionate Charge did He give to <HI>Peter,</HI> about <HI>the Lambs of the Flock?</HI> Of the <HI>Young Man</HI> in the Gospel which came to Him with some good inclinations, it is said, <HI>Jesus beheld him, and loved him. John,</HI> suppos'd to be the <HI>Youngest</HI> among the first Disciples, was emphatically <HI>The Disciple whom Jesus loved, which also leaned on His Breast</HI> at Sup∣per, the <HI>Favourite</HI> place. Young Converts are pe∣culiarly <HI>set as a Scal on His Heart,</HI> and <HI>as a Sig∣net on His Right Hand.</HI> They are <HI>near and dear to Him,</HI> and <HI>pretious in His sight.</HI> The godly Young Man <HI>Daniel</HI> had that testimony, <HI>A Man Greatly Beloved.</HI> Prov. 8.17. <HI>I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me.</HI> Such as honour Him with their <HI>First</HI> Love, are repay'd &amp; crown'd with his <HI>special</HI> Love. <HI>The Kings favour is toward such a wise Servant.</HI> But <HI>such</HI> whose <HI>Childhood and Youth are vanity,</HI> who give themselves to Youthful Lusts, are <HI>the abhorred of the Lord,</HI> odious to the pure Eyes of His Holiness, and obnoxious to the severe Revenges of His Justice; and while they <HI>go on in their trespasses, the Wrath of God abides upon them.</HI> It is a base <HI>indignity</HI>; and most un∣sufferable <HI>provocation</HI> to the Holy God, to <HI>deny</HI> Him the <HI>reasonable Service</HI> He requires of us, to <HI>misemploy</HI> the noble <HI>Powers</HI> we've receiv'd from Him, and <HI>yield them as instruments of unrighte∣ousness unto Sin,</HI> to pervert His Gifts to His disho∣nour, and practically to prefer Sin, Satan &amp; the World (our great Enemies) to God and Christ our great Benefactor and only Saviour. This is high handed contempt of the Blessed God; and those simple and foolish Youths that offer this base and insolent affront to the God of all their Mercies, are the objects of His just displeasure,
<PB N="40" REF="002024_0047_0FBA81822BB25720"/>
and holy indignation. <HI>God is angry with the wick∣ed every day. He despiseth them that despise Him. The face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</HI> All the Attributes of God are arm'd with terror, and charg'd with vengeance against the workers of iniquity. If then we desire to be <HI>accepted and owned of God,</HI> we must now <HI>break off from our iniquities</HI> by Repentance. The <HI>awful</HI> tho't that while we continue impure and impenitent, we are under the wrath and curse of God, This shou'd rouse us out of our security; and the <HI>joyful</HI> tho't that by Early Religion we <HI>prove what is that good and acceptable will</HI> of God, and <HI>walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleasing,</HI> this shou'd encourage and quicken us now in the Days of our Youth to <HI>yield our members instruments of righteousness unto God.</HI> This is the will and pleasure of <HI>God,</HI> who has Sovereign <HI>Authority</HI> to determine the Time, who is infinitely <HI>Wise, Just</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> and there∣fore knows and chusest the <HI>best</HI> Time. Let <HI>God's</HI> Time be <HI>Our's. Every thing is beautiful in its sea∣son,</HI> The work of the Day in it's Day. The <HI>Manna</HI> was to be gathered in the <HI>Morning,</HI> then it was <HI>sweet</HI> and agreeable, but if <HI>neglected,</HI> it became <HI>loathsome</HI> and distasteful.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VII. Consider, <HI>YOUNG Men that are Bap∣tized, are under the most solemn Engagements now to Cleanse their Ways.</HI> Baptism is a <HI>standing</HI> Or∣dinance of the Gospel, which <HI>All</HI> shou'd be Par∣takers of; and none shou'd dare, as they wou'd not <HI>wrong their own Souls,</HI> to live in the contemp∣tuous <HI>neglect</HI> of it. But I presume, that every one here present hath passed under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat blessed Ordinance. If so, you are <HI>obliged</HI> then to Cleanse your Way, as you wou'd <HI>answer</HI> the Sacred <HI>Ends</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="002024_0048_0FBA8183087F5E88"/>
and <HI>Bonds</HI> of your <HI>devoted</HI> state, and act <HI>agreeably</HI> to your <HI>Character</HI> &amp; <HI>Profession.</HI> Baptism is a Sign and Seal of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which obliges to uni∣versal purity. <HI>As many then as are Baptized into Jesus Christ, are Debtors to the whole Law of Faith.</HI> In Baptism we renounce all our Sins and Lusts, <HI>Earthly, Sensual, &amp; Devilish</HI>; we profess and promise to <HI>live Godly in Christ Jesus,</HI> to <HI>walk according to God in the Spirit.</HI> If then we prostitute our selves to any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase lust or wicked practice, and alienate our selves from the life of God, we <HI>retract</HI> our Baptismal Stipulation, we trample on the most sacred Vows, we reproach that <HI>worthy Name where∣by we are called,</HI> and renounce our Interest in the blessed Promises. And what Man do's not trem∣at the tho't of this <HI>prophane, treacherous, &amp; impious</HI> dealing with God and our own Souls? Verily our Baptism will profit us nothing, without newness of Life. <HI>Baptism saves us, not by putting away the filth of the flesh, but by the answer of a good Conscience toward God,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.21. What will the outward washing with Water avail, without the inward <HI>washing of Regeneration.</HI> If we still <HI>walk after the Flesh,</HI> and wallow in filthy lusts, our Baptism will no ways be serviceable or beneficial to us; nay, it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a <HI>witness against</HI> us. He that is Bap∣tized, and believeth not, is <HI>condemned already,</HI> condemned <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his own mouth.</HI> Ungodly Christi∣ans are <HI>Sinners above all Men.</HI> The <HI>Heathen</HI> World Sin at a <HI>cheaper</HI> rate than they. <HI>Double</HI> Guilt and an <HI>aggravated</HI> Ruin belong to such.</P>
<P>AND let not any think to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lude</HI> this Argu∣ment by flattering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemselves, <HI>It will be soon enough hereafter to think of fulfilling their Baptis∣mal Engagements.</HI> O deceive not your selves by
<PB N="42" REF="002024_0049_0FBA8184995634C0"/>
this vain pretence into sinful delays. The Bap∣tismal Covenant binds to <HI>present</HI> and <HI>perpetual</HI> obedience. It is of the nature of an <HI>Espousal</HI>; where∣upon one is oblig'd <HI>immediately</HI> to forsake all others, and be <HI>entirely</HI> devoted to her Husband. —The Promise in Baptism has the nature of a <HI>Vow.</HI> Therein we take the <HI>Oath</HI> of Allegiance to God, and <HI>bind our Souls with a Bond,</HI> professing to <HI>give our own selves to the Lord</HI>; &amp; having <HI>open'd our mouth, we cannot go back,</HI> nor put off. The Rule is, (Eccl. 5.4.) <HI>When thou vowest a Vow unto God, de∣fer not to pay it: for He hath no pleasure in fools; Pay that which thou hast vowed.</HI> Pay it <HI>fully,</HI> pay it <HI>presently.</HI> Consider this, <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>fear:</HI> Are you under the <HI>Bonds of Baptism?</HI> Then you have <HI>vow'd</HI> to God the <HI>Service of your Youth</HI>; and if you <HI>neglect</HI> to perform the Vow, you incurr the guilt of <HI>Perfidy,</HI> and the most abhorred <HI>Perjury.</HI> To vow and not to pay is a <HI>mocking of God, and lying to the Holy Ghost.</HI> And these Fools in Israel are an abomination unto the Lord. <HI>Take heed</HI> there∣fore <HI>to your selves, lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your God; for the Lord your God is a con∣suming Fire, even a jealous God,</HI> (Deut. 4.23, 4.) I beseech you, <HI>immediately</HI> come into that necessary and noble <HI>Resolution,</HI> (Exod. 15.2.) <HI>The Lord is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my Fa∣ther's God, and I will exalt Him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VIII. Consider, <HI>BY Cleansing our Way in our Youth, a present Tribute of peculiar Honour is paid to God, and the Foundation lay'd for illustrious Re∣venues of Glory to His Great Name.</HI> The <HI>Earli∣ness</HI> of our Repentance and Obedience is <HI>highly Honorary</HI> to God, as it intimates a peculiar <HI>sin∣cerity, voluntariness,</HI> &amp; <HI>fervency</HI> in our hatred of Sin,
<PB N="43" REF="002024_0050_0FBA818609FEFD90"/>
and love to God; an high <HI>Esteem</HI> of the Divine <HI>Laws,</HI> and the <HI>vigour</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> in our Souls ena∣bling us to break thro' the many <HI>difficulties</HI> &amp; <HI>strong temptations</HI> of the Youthful Age, and in the face of alluring <HI>Pleasures,</HI> against the general stream of <HI>Custom</HI> and <HI>Example,</HI> &amp;c. to <HI>amend our ways,</HI> and <HI>Exercise our selves unto Godliness,</HI> To give <HI>that</HI> the first of our Time, &amp; the strength of our Days.— These things tend much to the honour of God. Their <HI>Singularity</HI> offers praise, such things in Youth are a pretious <HI>Rarity,</HI> which gives them a peculiar Charm &amp; Beauty, and makes them more <HI>to the Praise of the Glory of His Grace. They are abun∣dant also by many thanksgivings to God; whiles</HI> others <HI>beholding the good Conversation of such, Glo∣rify God for their professed subjection to the Gospel of Christ, and for the exceeding Grace of God in them.</HI> The rising flourishing Plants are the bright Ornaments of the Garden of Christ <HI>at present,</HI> and they afford a <HI>prospect</HI> of yielding <HI>hereafter much fruit whereby our Heavenly Father is glorify'd.</HI> An Early Conversion <HI>prevents</HI> much <HI>dishonour,</HI> which <HI>otherwise</HI> wou'd be done to God by the iniquities of Youth, and upwards; and it also tends to <HI>bring</HI> much <HI>positive Honour</HI> to God, in a vigorous and long exercise of Grace and practice of Duty. The warmth and activity of Youth un∣der the direction of a gracious principle within, renders us <HI>Vessels unto Honour</HI> peculiarly <HI>meet for our Masters use</HI>; we are at present more inclin'd to action, and more fitted for service, and we are like in an ordinary way to have a longer time of Labour, to contract a stronger disposition and affection to God's Glory, and to meet with better and greater Opportunities to promote His King∣dom
<PB N="44" REF="002024_0051_0FBA81882AC9BC40"/>
and Interest in the World than others. The sooner we rise in the Morning, the more Time we have before us, and the more work we shall probably get done by the Evening.</P>
<P>AND now has the <HI>Early</HI> Cleansing of our Ways such an Aspect upon the Glory of God? Surely then we are oblig'd by all the tyes of <HI>Duty, Justice,</HI> and <HI>Gratitude, forthwith</HI> to engage in this work, <HI>Giving Glory unto God. Not</HI> to do this, is the highest <HI>injustice,</HI> a robbing our rightful Lord of His due; and the blackest <HI>ingratitude,</HI> an un∣worthy return to our Great Benefactor. And shall we <HI>thus requite the Lord? O foolish &amp; unwise!</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IX. Consider, <HI>GREAT, and manifold are the Advantages and Priviledges, which by Early Piety, we secure unto our selves.</HI> There are not only great Revenues of Glory accrueing from it unto God, but the <HI>richest Vintage of Good</HI> redounding unto <HI>us.</HI> It is both Glorious to God, and auspi∣cious to Man. Lam. 3.27. <HI>It is good for a man, that he bear the yoke in his youth.</HI> The Yoke of Christ, if we take it upon us <HI>Early,</HI> we shall bear it more <HI>easily,</HI> more <HI>honourably,</HI> more <HI>profitably,</HI> and shall reap many happy advantages in Life, at Death, and in the Eternal World. Let me say here,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>sooner</HI> we begin to Cleanse our Ways, we shall obtain the <HI>greater Honour.</HI> Pure Religion is a Crown of Glory to any one, and makes a Man <HI>more Excellent than his Neighbour</HI>; But it shines with a <HI>peculiar</HI> beauty and lustre in the ruddy <HI>Youth,</HI> and makes him <HI>more honourable even than his Brethren.</HI> There is an <HI>Excellency</HI> of <HI>Dignity</HI> in <HI>Early</HI> Religion, and <HI>Double Honour</HI> belongs unto it.</P>
<P>CONSIDER here, This Work <HI>puts real Ex∣cellency upon us</HI>; hence the <HI>sooner</HI> we begin, the
<PB N="45" REF="002024_0052_0FBA818916970138"/>
<HI>greater Degrees</HI> of Dignity we are like to arrive unto. This Employment do's <HI>Exalt,</HI> as well as <HI>Exer∣cise,</HI> our reasonable Powers, It polishes &amp; ennobles our best Faculties, and tends to the recovery of our degraded Nature from its present vile con∣dition to it's pristine glory and perfection. Here by we put on the most bright and lasting Beauties, and cloath our selves with Honour. Hereby we attain the blessed <HI>End, for</HI> which we were created, the <HI>Glory of God</HI>; and hereby we are made Par∣takers of the blessed <HI>Image,</HI> in which we were created: and inasmuch as it is thus <HI>perfective of our Nature</HI> it is really honourable True Holi∣ness is true Honour. "Serious Piety sows the seeds of the most solid Greatness." An Heathen could say, <HI>Vertue is the only true Nobility.</HI> Hence the Apostle puts them together, (1 Thes. 4.4.) Possess your Vessel in <HI>Sanctification</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI> The <HI>Holy of the Lord, Honourable,</HI>—are Characters, which God the infallible Judge of Excellency has inseperably connected, and <HI>what God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder.</HI> Holiness is the mark of <HI>distinction</HI> between <HI>the pretious and the vile.</HI> The <HI>Saints</HI> are <HI>the Excellent in the Earth,</HI> (Psal. 16.3.) And the <HI>Young</HI> Saints appear among them as Stars of the first Magnitude. They are the <HI>First-born among many Brethren,</HI> the most <HI>Precious Sons of Zion,</HI> in whom <HI>the Beauties of Holiness</HI> are most <HI>conspicuous,</HI> and are like to be most <HI>illustrious.</HI> The <HI>sooner</HI> we begin to purify our selves, the <HI>nearer approaches</HI> we are like to make to <HI>the per∣fection of beauty,</HI> and the <HI>nearer conformity</HI> we shall attain to the most <HI>bright</HI> and <HI>blessed</HI> Being. The Work is <HI>Honourable and Glorious,</HI> and the <HI>more so,</HI> the <HI>sooner</HI> it is <HI>begun,</HI> and the <HI>longer</HI> 'tis <HI>continu'd</HI> in.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002024_0053_0FBA818FAEFDD4B8"/>AGAIN, Consider, As the Work it self <HI>puts</HI> real Excellency <HI>on</HI> Us, so the <HI>early</HI> beginning of it <HI>mani∣fests</HI> many Excellencies <HI>in</HI> Us, that are highly <HI>ho∣nourable in all.</HI>—Is <HI>Sincerity</HI> honourable? This ho∣nour have those that are Religious betimes. The Religion of such seems to be more <HI>chosen, free, willing</HI> and <HI>Cordial.</HI> They seem to be led by a ge∣nerous and ingenuous Principle of <HI>Love</HI> to God and His ways; while others in the views of approach∣ing Death and Hell are awed by the terrors of Conscience, and acted by the involuntary &amp; servile principle of <HI>Fear.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, Is <HI>Gratitude</HI> honourable? This honour also hath the Pious Young Man. A Principle of Gratitude is truly <HI>great</HI> and <HI>excellent</HI> in any. Now this appears with <HI>most lively</HI> Cha∣racters in the Religious <HI>Young Man</HI>; Such an One gives an undoubted testimony of His thankful resentment &amp; high esteem of the Divine Favours, <HI>He makes the speediest and noblest returns,</HI> even the service of his <HI>best</HI> days, and of the <HI>Years where∣in</HI> He finds <HI>pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, Is <HI>Courage</HI> &amp; <HI>Magnanimity</HI> honourable? This honour also belongs to Early Penitents. It shews an admirable <HI>greatness</HI> of Soul and <HI>Forti∣tude</HI> of mind in <HI>Young Men,</HI> (whose age is ordinari∣ly inclin'd to <HI>softness</HI> and <HI>pleasure)</HI> to be able to withstand the Charms and despise the Smiles of an enticing World, to overcome the Temptations of a flattering Heart, and a tempting Devil, &amp; mau∣gre all the Discouragements that surround them▪ to break off from their Sins, and enter into Leag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e against the works of darkness &amp; the powers of darkness, and bind themselves out to the ser∣vice of God, resolving to keep His righteous Judg∣ments;

This, I say, shews signal <HI>vigour</HI> and <HI>valour</HI> of Mind, which is a <HI>Garland of Glory</HI> to pious Youth.</P>

this World: Pleasures that will infinitely out∣bid our biggest expectations, and out-reach our present most rais'd conceptions: Pleasures that will never sower nor wither: Pleasures inde∣fective and undecaying. — In Heaven we shall be admitted to the open Vision and full Fruition of <HI>God, our exceeding Joy</HI>: and there we shall emphatically <HI>rejoyce in Christ Jesus</HI>; there we shall most intimately solace our Souls in happy Communion with the Royal <HI>Bridegroom</HI>; There will be the utmost <HI>Heights</HI> of mutual affection, com∣placency and endearing intercourse: and there we shall enjoy the delightful Society of the <HI>An∣gels</HI>; and <HI>Just Men made perfect</HI>; and with them we shall joyn in admiring, adoring and magnify∣ing our Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier, having our Hearts fill'd with Ecstasies of Gladness, and our mouths with chearful Songs of Praise.

<P>THUS we see how Early Religion tends to promote our peace and comfort in this World, and our joy and bliss in the next World. It is a

never-failing Spring of the noblest, the most gene∣rous and sublime Delights; which the sanctify'd Soul in this Life relishes a satisfaction in, that the whole confluence of Earthly comforts and the sweets of Sense cannot afford, nor the absence of them can ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e away; and which the glorify'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul in the other Life will be fill'd with unknown Transports and Raptures in the complete enjoy∣ment of.</P>
<P>AND now what a forceable Argument is this to engage Men in their Youth to cleanse their ways? Youth is the Age of Pleasure: Delight is the peculiar bait or temptation to draw and allure Young Men. Let the Pleasures of Religion then powerfully recommend unto them the practice of Religion. Hearken to the counsel of God by the wise Man; <HI>My Son forget not my l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w; but let thine heart keep my commandments: for length of days,</HI> and <HI>peace shall they add to thee. Bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thine heart. Get wisdom, get understanding, All her ways are ways of pleasantness, and happy is every one that retaineth her.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER Advantage of cleansing our ways in Youth is, that <HI>it will be more for our in∣terest, profit &amp; benefit.</HI> The Apostle tells us, <HI>Godli∣ness with contentment is great gain,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.6. So in the 4th Chapter, 8th. ver. <HI>Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.—Blessings are on the head of the just. In</HI> keeping of the Command∣ments they have a <HI>great</HI> Reward, and <HI>after</HI> this an <HI>exceeding</HI> great Reward. Behold, the Righteous shall be <HI>recompenced in the Earth,</HI> and <HI>much more in the Holy Heaven.</HI> Let me say here briefly;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="75" REF="002024_0082_0FBA81D3AE196C10"/>1. IF we cleanse our Way in Youth, <HI>We are like to obtain greater Blessings in this Life,</HI> both Secular and Spiritual.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>SECULAR and External</HI> Blessings. As <HI>Temperance</HI> has a natural tendency to secure our <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Ease,</HI> and <HI>Humility</HI> to exalt us to <HI>Honor</HI>; so <HI>Frugality, Fidelity, Justice,</HI> and the like Virtues are the surest method to promote our outward <HI>Prosperity.</HI>—Art thou <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Low</HI> in this World? Religion will contribute to your Advancement. <HI>The diligent Hand maketh rich</HI>; and Religion tends to promote Industry: <HI>The Blessing of the Lord mak∣eth Rich</HI>; and the promise of this, is only to the Righteous, to them who <HI>seek first the Kingdom of God,</HI> and seek this World <HI>after a Godly sort.</HI> Further, to be conscientious, upright, and honest, is the way to <HI>find favour and good under∣standing in the sight of Men</HI>; By undisguis'd hu∣mility and unaffected piety Men ingratiate them∣selves with all thinking sober People; every one will be ready to pay respect to them, to put con∣fidence in them, and put them into business and employment, &amp;c. because they are <HI>true Men, the faithful in the Land.</HI> All which Articles conspire to promote the Poor among the Brethren. <HI>Or,</HI> art thou <HI>Rich in this Worlds Goods</HI>? Your Religion will still serve your temporal Interest, as it <HI>teaches you how to abound,</HI> directs &amp; influences the enjoyment and improvement of your Estate, so as tends to se∣cure and increase it. — And sometimes Good Men, especially such as have feared God from their Youth, have met with signal Prosperity▪ in the World, have been the visible Favorites of Pro∣vidence, and remarkably distinguisht on outward accounts. We've many Instances on Scripture re∣cord:

No; Many that are the <HI>Holy of the Lord, are the Poor of this World.</HI> God do's not give to all his Children a rich abundance of outward Enjoyments, nor may any expect this but with great submission; yet all have the undoubted Se∣curity of His inviolable Promise for a present sufficiency. Hence in the Inventory of the Believ∣ers privileges (1 Cor. 3.22.) the Apostle inserts <HI>the World and Things present.</HI> They have a just Ti∣tle to so much of the World as may be truly for their Advantage, and verily <HI>they shall not want a∣ny thing, that their Heavenly Father knows they have need of,</HI> Mat. 6.32, 33. <HI>The Lord is a Sun &amp; Shield, He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</HI> (Psal. 84.11.)

any of the Saints may be in their outward Cir∣cumstances, tho' they are <HI>wretched and miserable and poor, and blind, and naked,</HI> yet they are <HI>rich &amp; increased with Goods, &amp; have need of nothing</HI>; they have the fear and favour of God, <HI>the Merchandize whereof is better than the Merchandize of Silver; &amp; the gain thereof than fine Gold, more pretious than Rubies, and all things thou canst desire are not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> compared thereunto.

This is the great security of the Saints, that they are <HI>kept by the power of God</HI>: &amp; this consideration may establish their hearts against the fears of a final mis∣carriage.
<Q>Provided we be sincere, <HI>(saith a Great Di∣vine)</HI> He will not suffer us to be set upon by temp∣tations that are too big for us.

For the Providence of God may sometimes, for wise ends and reasons, see it fit to leave good Men to their own frailty, and to faint and fall shamefully, &amp; this sometimes in order to their more glorious Recovery, &amp; the greater triumph o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Faith and Constancy afterward; some∣times to punish their vain Confidence in them∣selves, as in the case of <HI>Peter,</HI> who declared more resolution, and bare it out with a greater confidence than any of the Disciples, when he said to our Saviour, <HI>Tho' all Men forsake thee, yet will not I</HI>; and yet after this He fell more shamefully than any of the rest, so as to deny His Master with horrid Oaths and Imprecations, and <HI>this,</HI> tho' our Saviour had pray'd particu∣larly for Him, <HI>that his Faith might not fail.</HI> From which Instance we may learn, that God doth
<PB N="80" REF="002024_0087_0FBA81DC2D92F248"/>
not engage Himself absolutely to secure good Men from falling, in case of a great temptation and trial; but if they be <HI>sincere,</HI> He will not permit them to <HI>fall finally,</HI> tho' He may suffer them to <HI>miscarry grievously for a time,</HI> to con∣vince them of the vanity of their confidence in themselves and their own Strength. The Promise of God is not absolute, that good Men shall be preserv'd from falling; but that <HI>the Temptation shall have a happy Issue,</HI> and that they shall not <HI>finally</HI> miscarry. For Promises of this Nature are to be interpreted by us, and under∣stood, as we do our Saviours <HI>Prayer</HI> for <HI>Peter</HI> be∣fore his Fall, <HI>that his Faith should not fail</HI> finally; but tho' he fell through too much Confidence in Himself, He should thro' the grace of God assisting Him be enabled to recover by Repen∣tance.</Q></P>
<P>INDEED it has sometimes been awfully seen, that Persons have declin'd from good beginnings, and their <HI>latter end</HI> has been <HI>worse than their be∣ginning</HI>: But it must be said concerning such, They <HI>had not root in themselves,</HI> (Luk. 13.21.) They had only the external <HI>form of Godliness,</HI> &amp; were destitute of any <HI>vital Principle within</HI> to perpetuate their Obedience, and by the just judg∣ment of God for their hypocrisy and prevarica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion were left to the lusts of their own heart, and the power of Satan. This was particularly the Case of <HI>Simon Magus.</HI> The Promise of God do's not engage him to prevent Hypocrites disco∣vering themselves; but <HI>their</HI> guilt exposes them to his righteous Judgments.</P>
<P>AND on the other hand, it has been joyfully seen that such, <HI>whose hearts were right with God,</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="002024_0088_0FBA81DDB6499158"/>
and <HI>sound in His Statutes,</HI> have been <HI>stedfast in His Covenant,</HI> and <HI>continued in the ways of well-doing</HI> to the End. That of the <HI>Wise Man</HI> has often been exemplify'd, (Prov. 22.6.) <HI>Train up a Child in the way he shou'd go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI> How <HI>true</HI> is that Observation con∣cerning the <HI>godly Man?</HI> (Psal. 1.3.) <HI>He shall be like a Tree planted by the rivers of water, that bring∣eth forth fruit in his season; his leaf shall not wither.</HI></P>
<P>AND as the truly Religious will <HI>persevere</HI>; so they will <HI>improve</HI> in holiness. It is one Cha∣racter of <HI>Sincerity,</HI> to <HI>reach forth to the things which are before, pressing toward the mark.</HI> Hence, such, as are sincerely religious in <HI>Youth,</HI> are like to make <HI>great proficiency</HI> in the Christian Life.

which do not at all touch the merit of the cause,) <HI>This</HI> would be <HI>Partiality</HI> and <HI>accepting of Persons,</HI> from which the Divine Nature is at an Eternal distance.

Can it become the wise Ruler of the World to act so repugnantly to the great ends of His Government, as to licence the villanies and frenzys of Youth? When this is the Age most flexible and governable; the Age of hopes and of leisure, and the critical Age which ordinarily determines the byass of the mind, and forms the character of our after-Life in this World. For God to loose the reins to this important Age, and not pre-engage it to his own Service, and antidote it against the tempting Lures of the God of this World, by the fears of Eternal Judgment, (which only can weaken the

<P>I shall speak to this Head under two Articles. As, (1) The <HI>Word</HI> of God <HI>has</HI> a <HI>Cleansing</HI> Influence. (2) If we <HI>observe</HI> the Word of God, we shall <HI>experience</HI> it's <HI>Cleansing</HI> Virtue.</P>
<P>Artic. I. <HI>THE Word of God has a Cleansing In∣fluence,</HI> or an efficacy to cleanse our Way.</P>
<P>TO clear this Head, Let us attend to the fol∣lowing Particulars. — (1.) The Word was given to us for this End. (2.) It is excellently fitted for this End. (3) It is the Instrument, which the Sanctifying Spirit ordinarily makes use of.—</P>
<P N="1">I. Consider; <HI>THE Word was given to us for this blessed End.</HI> The high and gracious <HI>design</HI> of God in giving us His Word was, that it might be a <HI>Well of Salvation</HI> to us, out of which to <HI>draw water with joy, living water, the water of puri∣fication,</HI> to <HI>cleanse us from all unrighteousness,</HI> from the pollutions of carnality and <HI>many foolish filthy Lusts, which drown the</HI> Soul <HI>in perdition.</HI> This <HI>Fountain was open'd for the Inhabitants of Jerusa∣lem to wash in</HI> from all Sin, and from all Unclean∣ness, that they may be <HI>sanctify'd and cleansed with the washing of water by the word,</HI> (Eph. 5.26.) This <HI>River</HI> was not <HI>created</HI> for us to <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort</HI> our selves
<PB N="99" REF="002024_0106_0FBA791DB2A44B60"/>
in &amp; make the divertisement of a few idle hours, as <HI>Leviathan (the King over all the Children of Pride</HI>) sports himself in the hoary deep: but for us to <HI>wash</HI> our selves in; and that not only our <HI>Heads,</HI> (cleansing them from the defilements of Error,) and our <HI>Hands,</HI> (cleansing them from the impurities of open Vice,) but also our <HI>Hearts,</HI> purifying them from the defilements of Hypo∣crisy, and secret Lusts,) and our <HI>Feet,</HI> (cleansing them from the dirt and pollution, they contract at any time by false steps and unwary slips, when running the way of God's Commandments,) yea, our <HI>whole Man,</HI> Spirit, Soul and Body, cleansing our selves from <HI>all filthiness of flesh and Spirit, perfecting holiness</HI> thro' the Word of Sanctifica∣tion. Thus saith the Apostle, (2 Tim. 3.16, 7. <HI>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,—that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnisht unto all good works</HI>; and that foul Sinners may be transformed into <HI>Vessels of honor, sanctify'd and made meet for the Master's use.</HI> This is the great and good <HI>end,</HI> which God propounded in giving His Word. And <HI>Infinite Wisdom</HI> wou'd not have so done, if the Word had not an aspect upon, and some relation and proportion to that blessed End. Inasmuch then as the Word was given to us with this view, and upon this design, by the <HI>only Wise God,</HI> we may hence infer, that the Word has a proper influence to cleanse our ways. And if this End be not eventually obtained on All that enjoy the Word, it is owing to the Sinners contemp∣tuous neglect of the Word, or resolved opposition to it, which converts the Sovereign Balsam into killing Poison: and is no ways owing to any weakness, or u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptness in the Means. <HI>For in the next place▪</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="100" REF="002024_0107_0FBA7920ED9E4C88"/>II. Consider, <HI>THE Word is in its own Nature (as a Means) excellently adapted and accommodated to this Design.</HI> It has a perfect aptitude and direct tendency to this E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and is every way calcu∣lated to help us in the work of self-purification. Consider Two Things; It is full of Light, and it is full of Power.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IT is full of <HI>Light</HI>; both to detect, &amp; to direct.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is full of <HI>detecting</HI> Light. It is a Light, which <HI>maketh manifest.</HI> It brings many <HI>hidden</HI> things out of <HI>Darkness,</HI> and illustrates many <HI>known</HI> things, <HI>elightening the Eyes, &amp; making w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se the simple. (Psal.</HI> 19.7, 8.) It discovers to us the primitive purity, &amp; innocence of humane Nature. It discovers to us its present depravation &amp; pollution: It disco∣vers the reality &amp; original, the nature, extent, and various workings of corruption in Man; Hereby the Body of Sin is anatomized, The plague of our hearts and the evil of our ways made known unto us; It discovers all the secret spots and deformities of the Soul, and all the defilements and irregularities of the Life, and shews us how <HI>evil a thing and bitter it is, that we have forsaken God.</HI> And it discovers the Ground or meritori∣ous Cause, and the Author or efficient Cause, of our Sanctification, together with the usual method, the appointed means, the absolute necessity, the possibility and glorious advantages, and different degrees, of Spiritual purification. It paints out the <HI>Sinner</HI> in his true colours, and exact features, and it draws the <HI>Saint</HI> in His full proportion and distinct complexion. So that <HI>whoso looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, searching and trying his ways,</HI> may there <HI>beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld his own natural face as in a Glass</HI>; may discern <HI>what manner of Man he
<PB N="101" REF="002024_0108_0FBA792500E7B468"/>
is,</HI> and what the <HI>way that he takes,</HI> whether it be <HI>the way of Sinners,</HI> or <HI>the path of the Just</HI>; and <HI>how far</HI> he is advanced: What are the <HI>evil ways</HI> that must be forsaken, and what are the <HI>right ways,</HI> that must be walked in. Which leads me to the next thing; That is,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Word is full of <HI>directing</HI> Light. <HI>It is profitable for instruction in righteousness,</HI> (2 Tim. 3.16.) It is useful to lead us <HI>into</HI> and guide us <HI>in</HI> the <HI>good way.</HI> It is a Light to our Eyes for disco∣very, and a Lanthorn to our Feet for direction. It is the <HI>Wisdom of God, profitable to direct, to be desir'd to make one wise, able to make us wise unto Salvation,</HI> (2 Tim. 3.15)—<HI>All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way,</HI> and are naturally wandring on <HI>the mount of Cor∣ruption and in the wilderness of Sin</HI>; We <HI>have gone from mountain to hill, and have forgotten our resting-place</HI> the Holy Hill of Zion, and know not the way thither; and we shou'd have wander'd endlesly in the Regions of the <HI>Shadow of Death,</HI> if the <HI>Day-Spring from on high</HI> had not visited us, and a <HI>sure word of Prophecy</HI> been given to us, which is <HI>as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shining in a dark Place, a Light to our feet, and a Lamp to our paths,</HI> (Psal. 119.105.)</P>
<P>HERE Let me say concerning this Gloriuos Light,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT directs our feet into the way of peace.</HI> It gives <HI>knowledge of Salvation, by the remission of Sins, thro' the tender mercy of our God,</HI> (Luk. 1.77.8, 9.) and <HI>the Righteousness of Christ therein re∣vealed, from saith to faith,</HI> (Rom. 1.16.) Herein are made known to us the Things which belong to our Everlasting Peace: Herein we are directed to the <HI>God of Peace,</HI> as our <HI>End,</HI> and only satis∣fying Portion; and to <HI>Christ,</HI> as the <HI>Way,</HI> which
<PB N="102" REF="002024_0109_0FBA79268C235490"/>
<HI>way of Peace, we had</HI> never <HI>known</HI> without the help of Divine Revelation. The Lord Jesus Christ speaks of Himself, as <HI>The Way, the Truth, and the Life,</HI> (Joh. 14.6.) The true way of Life, the living and true way. He is the <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> where∣by we <HI>enter into Peace, The new and living way into the holiest, which He hath consecrated for us thro' the Vail, that is to say, his flesh,</HI> (Heb. 10.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) This is the <HI>way of God,</HI> and <HI>No Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ometh to the Father but by Christ,</HI> i.e. <HI>to God as a Father.</HI> This <HI>way of God</HI> is in His Word <HI>expounded to us perfectly. The Scriptures are they which testify of</HI> Christ, (<HI>Job.</HI> 5.39.) and they <HI>alone.</HI> The <HI>great mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh,</HI> Those <HI>faith∣ful sayings, (worthy of all acceptation,) that Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners</HI>; &amp; that <HI>we have peace with God thro' His Blood,</HI>— These Glorious Truths shine forth <HI>only</HI> in the Gospel. In all the admirable Volumes of the Celebrated <HI>Ethnick</HI> Philosophers, there is not the least hint, or tittle of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of <HI>Salvation</HI> thro' Him. "The work of Redemption is not engraven on the work of Creation, nor of Providence". Apostate Man's <HI>Salvation</HI> is not a Thing necessa∣rily inferr'd from the Being and general Good∣ness of God, <HI>of which He never left Himself with∣out witness.</HI> (Act. 14.17.) The Heathen World had but a very weak and wavering apprehension of the Mercy of God. And the <HI>Method</HI> of this Salvation, is mysterious, and sublime, above the flight of humane reason, how highly soever ex∣alted, and no doubt it was a surprize to <HI>the Angels of Light</HI> and <HI>the Spirits of Darkness,</HI> that the <HI>Only begotten Son of God</HI> shou'd assume our Nature and therein be <HI>obedient</HI> even <HI>to the cursed Death of the
<PB N="103" REF="002024_0110_0FBA7928CE602148"/>
Cross</HI>; and that in <HI>Christ crucify'd</HI> God shou'd be <HI>reconciling the World unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses.</HI> This way of Reconciliation is above the ken of the most penetrating natural understand∣ing, &amp; is <HI>brought to Light</HI> only in the <HI>Gospel of Peace.</HI> And without this, it might have remain'd a se∣cret for ever. Christ is the Light of the World, and the Word of God is the only Telescope to discover this great Luminary to the World. <HI>Flesh and Blood cou'd never have revealed</HI> Christ <HI>unto us,</HI> (Mat. 16.17.)</P>
<P N="2">2. IT directs our feet into <HI>the Way of Holiness.</HI> The Word describes to us the <HI>good old Way,</HI> the <HI>way to Zion,</HI> and <HI>directs all our steps.</HI> Here is a sufficient directory for the whole Duty of Man. It propounds the right <HI>Principles,</HI> exact <HI>Mea∣sures,</HI> and true <HI>Ends</HI> of Obedience.</P>
<P>GOOD <HI>Principles</HI> are essential to pure Reli∣gion; such as <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, the <HI>Fear</HI> &amp; <HI>Love</HI> of God, <HI>Hope</HI> in His Mercy, &amp;c. These are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessary Ingredients of sincere Goodness, prescribed in the <HI>Word of God</HI>; concerning some of which the <HI>Philosophers</HI> of old knew nothing, and of the others they took but little notice.</P>
<P><HI>WITHOUT Faith it is impossible to please God,</HI> (Heb. 11.6.) <HI>Whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin,</HI> (Rom. 14.23.) "By Faith Christians may derive a worthiness and virtue to their meanest performances,"—but with∣out the vital efficacy of this Grace all their glitter∣ing duties are but <HI>dead works,</HI> &amp; lifeless shadows, unacceptable to God, and unavailable to Salva∣tion. But now without the Scriptures, we shou'd be entirely at a loss, as to this super-natural Grace. Hence it is said, Joh. 20.31. <HI>These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ
<PB N="104" REF="002024_0111_0FBA792A5C215EC8"/>
the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life thro' his name.</HI> The <HI>Object</HI> of Faith is only reveal'd in the Scripture, and so the <HI>ground</HI> of Faith depends on the Scripture. True Faith is built on the Testimony of God, and is resolv'd into the authority and veracity of God speaking in His Word. But how shall any one believe, without knowing the testimony that is given? How is it possible for any to believe aright con∣cerning the Redeemer, either as to matter or manner, without revelation?—and this is to be found no where but in the written Word, or <HI>Bible,</HI> (Rom. 10.14, 17.) This is the alone adaequate Rule and Foundation of Faith; and that Faith (whatever it relates to) is not <HI>Divine,</HI> but mere∣ly <HI>Humane,</HI> which arises barely from natural Light.</P>
<P>AGAIN, As to the Grace of filial <HI>Fear,</HI> we shou'd also be at a loss without the Scriptures. We may indeed be struck with a trembling <HI>horror,</HI> and servile <HI>dread</HI> of God, from some amazing displays of His terrible Greatness, and awful Holiness in the works of Creation and Providence; but that is no <HI>gratious</HI> passion, which is only tormenting to sense, and throws the mind into a storm and confusion It is only the Scriptures that bring to light those ingenuous considerations, that are proper and apt so to temper and purify this affection, as to render it an <HI>acceptable reverence, and godly fear.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, As to the Grace of <HI>Love</HI>; in this we shou'd be very defective without the knowledge of the Scriptures. Love is the generous principle of willing obedience to God, the substance of univer∣sal Religion, &amp; the perfective character of moral Vertues. Now the writings of the wisest Heathen say
<PB N="105" REF="002024_0112_0FBA792C884E1558"/>
little or nothing of this affection. The Scrip∣tures only recommend, and enjoin this Principle; and they only furnish us with suitable and suffi∣cient excitations to enliven and actuate it. Love has a great many incentives from the Goodness of God Essential, Creating, and Providential; But this Grace "never breaths like it self", 'till animated and warmed by motives of a <HI>superior</HI> strain. Unless the <HI>Love of God in Christ constrain us</HI> and inflame our affections, <HI>when we thus judge that Christ by the grace of God tasted Death for every man,</HI> our Love is not genuine, &amp; true; but where is the Love of God in Christ revealed, save in the Scriptures?</P>
<P>Lastly, THE knowlege of the Scriptures is necessary to the constitution of a regular <HI>Hope.</HI> As Hope is the Anchor of the Soul, so the Pro∣mises of God are the Basis of Hope; But these are revealed in the Scriptures only. It is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>through comfort of the Scriptures that we have ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> (Rom. 15.4.) Without Scripture-foundation our Hope is nothing but Dream, and presumption, and <HI>a thing of nought.</HI>—Thus as to the <HI>Principles</HI> of Obedience.</P>
<P>AGAIN, As to the <HI>Parts</HI> of Duty, what a mi∣serable loss shou'd be at without the conduct of Scripture-Light? The whole World indeed, <HI>even the People that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it in darkness,</HI> have some confus'd notion of a Supreme Being, are touch'd with some slight impressions of that homage we owe to God, from the dictates of natural rea∣son: but they run into an unaccountable variety of the rankest Errors and Superstitions. Religion changes with every Air, and puts on a new face <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every Climate, where the Light of God's
<PB N="106" REF="002024_0113_0FBA792E3748E0B8"/>
Word does not shine. Every one walketh <HI>in the way of his God, in the way of his own heart, and in the sight of his own eyes. There are that follow after lying vanities, and do service to them, that are by nature no God's.</HI> (Gal. 4.8.) There are <HI>that know God, but glorify Him not as God, being vain in their imaginations.</HI> (Rom. 1.21.)</P>
<P>AS for the <HI>Positive</HI> Institutions of the Worship of God, <HI>(agreeable to what One observes)</HI> they re∣sulting immediately from His arbitrary &amp; absolute Will, Hence such as are strangers to the written Word, must undoubtedly be unacquainted with their nature, number, ends &amp; uses. And for want of a careful regard to the Word of God, what fopperies and follies do such, as enjoy it, many times bring into the Worship of God? What <HI>vain Oblations</HI> do they offer, and what <HI>corrupt things do they Sacrifice to the Lord,</HI> who take their measures from a luxu∣riant Invention, and not from divine Revelation?</P>
<P>AND then, as to those Duties that are <HI>Moral,</HI> of immutable reason, and perpetual obligation, the Word of God is a most necessary &amp; sufficient Guide unto us. It gives us a complete System of natural Religion &amp; moral Vertues, such as the best Masters of Morality in the Heathen World cou'd never afford. <HI>Their</HI> purest Ethicks were stain'd with impure mixtures, with corrupt Precepts, or false permissions; &amp; the greatest Length that ever any attain'd by the help of their most excellent rules, was only a negative purity, moral honesty, and su∣perficial civility, justice, kindness and honor; all which is vastly short of our just obligations. The <HI>School of Nature</HI> was never so illuminated, as to be able to teach us our universal Duty. But the <HI>Word</HI> of God "sets before us a Rule of Life
<PB N="107" REF="002024_0114_0FBA793064DD9B58"/>
pure and perspicuous, in nothing superfluous or defective, but comprehending the entire duty of Man". <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</HI> (Psal. 19.7.) The Scripture contains <HI>all the Ordinances, and Com∣mandments of the Lord.</HI> It tells us <HI>what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God</HI>; It shews us <HI>what is good, and what the Lord our God doth require of us,</HI> and that in it's full latitude, and extent. It describes all those works of <HI>Sobriety,</HI> (which more immediately respect the govern∣ment of <HI>our selves</HI>) and all those works of <HI>Righ∣teousness,</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> (which do principally respect our carriage towards our <HI>Neighbour</HI> (and all those works of <HI>Piety,</HI> (that chiefly respect our behaviour towards <HI>God)</HI> which general Heads comprize the sum of our Duty, and are the E∣pitome of that Holiness, which is the appointed condition of Salvation. The Precepts of the Word extend to the <HI>whole Man,</HI> direct all the Powers of the Soul, and preside over the senses and members of the Body. They reach to <HI>all Cases,</HI> and <HI>Times,</HI> and instruct us how to behave our selves in every station and relation, in every state and condition of Life. The Word of God▪ prescribes the most perfect Law &amp; consummate indefective Rule to <HI>order our Conversation</HI> by, that ever the World heard of. <HI>Blessed</HI> therefore are they, and <HI>highly favour'd of the Lord,</HI> unto whom <HI>He has written the great things of his Law.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, The Word of God states the true <HI>Ends,</HI> which shou'd influence &amp; governs us in all our acti∣ons, in order to their rectitude. Purity of intention is a necessary qualification, yea, the very Life &amp; Soul of a good work. And be an act never so specious and
<PB N="108" REF="002024_0115_0FBA7931B62A7480"/>
commendable for the substance and manner, un∣less it be directed to a right end, the beauty of it is spoiled and the reward forfeited. A wrong end is <HI>a dead fly in the pretious ointment</HI>; This <HI>cor∣rupts</HI> &amp; <HI>vatiates</HI> our best performances. A great part of our Duty then lies in fixing right aims, and proposing regular ends. Now there are inferior and subordinate ends, as the real felicity of our own Souls, and the true Good of our Neighbours, and there is also a principal, or ultimate end, as the Glory of God, to which our actions shou'd be directed. Our duty is not perfect, unless we therein aspire after the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> as our su∣preme end. Nothing is more reasonable, than that <HI>we do all for the Glory of God</HI>; seeing we <HI>derive</HI> all our powers and enjoyments <HI>from</HI> Him, we shou'd <HI>improve</HI> all <HI>for</HI> Him; "we do all <HI>by</HI> Him, therefore we shou'd do all <HI>to</HI> Him": Besides, this is the same end, which God Himself acts for; Hence it must needs be the best &amp; highest, and challenges the priority of all other ends in our intentions.</P>
<P>NOW this noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd is no where prescribed, but in the Word of God. That enjoyns an habi∣tual, and implicit designation of this in all our actions, and an actual or express intuition and volition of it in more weighty cases. See, <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 15.16. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.19, 20. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.11. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31.— But where else is it propounded? As for the Pagan Philosophers, they were most notoriously deficient in this matter. In their most <HI>refined Morals,</HI> they never mentioned it. They chiefly recommended vertue, only as the way to honor and ease in the World, or a means of pleasure, and internal Peace; And the utmost pitch they
<PB N="109" REF="002024_0116_0FBA793589638C98"/>
ever came to, was to propose the reasonable∣ness, the amiable rectitude and inherient excellency of virtue: But this is still too low and mean a motive. "For Vertue is but a Ray of the Deity", and we are not perfect in any good work, "unless it be finally referr'd to His Glory who is the Principle and Pattern of it". It is then the distinguishing character of God's Word, It's peculiar dignity above all humane Writings, that it directs our performances to the most wor∣thy end, the Glory of God.— Thus the Word of God, directs us into the way of Holiness. It is a <HI>Light to the paths of righteousness, The way∣faring Men, though fools, shall not err therein.</HI> (Isai. 35.8.) To enjoy the Word is then a great mercy and benefit to a People. <HI>What advantage hath the</HI> Christian? <HI>much every way: chiefly because that unto them are committed the Oracles of God,</HI> (Rom. 3.1, 2.) Psal. 147.19, 20. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation, and as for his judgments they have not known them. Praise ye the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I've shewn, that the Word is <HI>full of Light, discovering</HI> what is necessary for us to know and believe, and <HI>directing</HI> us in what is necessary for us to do and practice, that we may be saved. And thus the Word operates <HI>objectively</HI> in the work of Sanctification.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THE Word is full of <HI>Energy,</HI> and <HI>Active Virtue.</HI> Thus, saith a Judicious and Learned <HI>Divine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Charnock,</HI> 2d. Vol. pag. 235, 6.</NOTE>
<Q>The Word seems to have an active force upon the Will, tho' the manner of it be very hard to conceive. 'Tis <HI>operative</HI> in the hand of
<PB N="110" REF="002024_0117_0FBA793C44A83320"/>
God for Sanctification. The Petition of our Saviour, (Joh. 17.7.) <HI>Sanctify them thro' thy truth, thy word is truth,</HI> seems to intimate more than a bare objective relation to this work; it both <HI>shows</HI> us our spots, and <HI>cleanses</HI> 'em. It is a Seed: Seed tho' small, is active. 'Tis a Glass, that not only represents the Image of God, but <HI>by the Spirit changeth us into it,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.18. How powerful is that Word, which changeth a Beast into a Man, a Devil into an Angel, a Clod of Earth into a Star of Heaven! 'Tis above the power of all moral Philosophy, and the Political Government ef the best States. It's power ap∣pears in the <HI>Subjects</HI> it hath been instrumental to change, (Hearts full of the filthiest lusts, have thereby been transform'd into Vessels of purity.) And in the <HI>suddenness</HI> of it's operation (How have Troops of unmaster'd Lusts fled at the Voice of the Gospel-Trumpet, like a Flock of frightned Birds, and left their long possessed Mansion!) and <HI>one part,</HI> one particle of the Word hath wrought wonders many times.— A single sentence, one plain Scripture has kill'd a Man's Sins, and erected an Heavenly Trophy in a Soul; which shews the power and effica∣cious virtue of the Word, acting more vigorously than all humane Reason in the World. This the experience of every Age can testify. Tho' the Word be not a natural Instrument to work necessarily, yet it is liken'd to natural Instru∣ments, which are active under the efficiency of the Agent, which manages them. And an <HI>Activity</HI> seems to be ascrib'd to it by Scripture-<HI>Meta∣phors</HI></Q>.
A few of which if we now consider, they will clearly represent the effective influence
<PB N="111" REF="002024_0118_0FBA793E7033B0F0"/>
and active power of the Word to Cleanse our Way.</P>
<P>THE Word is compared to <HI>Light</HI>; which is of an undefilable quality in it self, and a purifying influence as to other things: Hence it is call'd the <HI>refining pot of Nature</HI>; The World wou'd be an unwholesome Pest-house without it. Light and Purity go together. Where the Word truly irradiates the dark mind, it also purges the de∣filed Conscience.</P>
<P>AGAIN, It is likened to an <HI>Hammer,</HI> (Jer. 23.29) The Word often breaks in pieces the <HI>hard hearts</HI> of Men, these rocks within us; it beats down the nest of filthy Lusts in the Soul: It drives home convictions, <HI>reproofs, &amp; instructions in Righteousness,</HI> and fastens good impressions on the Conscience, <HI>as Nails in a sure place.</HI> Hence while <HI>Peter</HI> Preach'd his Hearers <HI>were pricked in their hearts,</HI> Act. 2.37.</P>
<P>AGAIN, It is likned unto <HI>Fire</HI>; (Jer. 20.9.— 23.29. Luk. 12.49.) This Holy Fire purifies the Soul, it consumes the stubble and chaff of Corruption, purges away the dross of Earthly affections, &amp; re∣fines the Gold, Silver &amp; pretious stones of Grace and Sanctity, it warms the Soul, &amp; softens it as wax, to receive an Heavenly impress; it enlivens the chill'd affections, &amp; it unites the heart unto God.</P>
<P>AGAIN, It is compar'd to a <HI>Sword,</HI> (Heb. 4.13. Eph. 6.7.) By this <HI>the Captain of our Salvation,</HI> when here on Earth, kept off and vanquisht the unclean Spirit, saying, <HI>It is written</HI>—. By this we de∣fend our selves against <HI>the strong Man armed,</HI> who meets us in our way, as a roaring Lion, and if 'twere not for this victorious Weapon, the least he'd do, wou'd be to throw us down, and worry us in the mire of carnal pollutions. Further, the Word, as a Sword, also is <HI>sharp, quick and
<PB N="112" REF="002024_0119_0FBA793F3903E2E0"/>
powerful,</HI> it peirces deep, shows to the Sinner his inward unsoundness, touches him to the quick, and opens a passage for the putrid virulent hu∣mours to issue forth.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The Word is compared to <HI>Honey</HI>; and that not only for it's sweet relish, but it's purging quality.</P>
<P>AGAIN, To <HI>Milk</HI> (Heb. 5.13. 1 Pet. 2.2.) which has a clarifying, cleansing property, apply'd out∣wardly, and a restorative, corroborating vertue, taken inwardly: Even so <HI>the Commandment of the Lord is pure, the Law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the Soul,</HI> (Psal. 19.7, 8.)</P>
<P>AGAIN, To <HI>Food</HI>; It is the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> and <HI>Meat which perisheth not.</HI> The Christian that eateth thereof, that <HI>eateth to satisfy his Soul,</HI> shall <HI>walk, and not faint,</HI> so as to fall into the miryclay; shall <HI>run and not be weary,</HI> so as to <HI>sit</HI> down in the dirt, or <HI>stumble</HI> down, and <HI>be entangled again in the pollutions of the World.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, To <HI>Leaven,</HI> (Mat. 13.33.) which works in a secret powerful manner, producing qualities like it self. Such an assimilating power there is in the Word. It <HI>is very pure,</HI> and when <HI>hid in the heart,</HI> it changes the foul qualities, &amp; trans∣forms us into the image of it's own purity.</P>
<P>LASTLY, To <HI>Water</HI>; This Holy Water serves to quench the fiery darts of the Unclean Spirit, and to wash away our defilements, and make us <HI>whiter than the Snow.</HI> Hence, 'tis said, (Joh▪ 15.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) <HI>Now are ye clean thro' the Word.</HI> So (1 Cor. 6.9, 11.) <HI>Some of you</HI> were the chief of Sinners, <HI>but ye are washed, but ye are sanctify'd.</HI>—So (Eph. 5.26.) <HI>That He might sanctify and cleanse us, with the washing of water, by the word.</HI> So the Waters in the Pro∣phet's

Vision, are to be taken in a <HI>mystical</HI> sense, to signify the Gospel of Christ, (<HI>Ezek.</HI> 47.) tho' in the <HI>Letter</HI> they may mean the Waters, that by Aqueducts, or Conduit-Pipes lay'd under ground, were convey'd from the Fountain <HI>Etam</HI> (as some observe) into the Temple for the cleansing of the Sacrifices, and for other Temple-uses.—</P>
<P>THE Word is particularly compared to <HI>Rain,</HI> (Deut. 32.2.) <HI>Showers</HI> of Rain serve (among other things) to cleanse our Streets; the sweeping streams carry off the filth and dirt, that we may walk and keep our feet clean. And so the <HI>small Rain</HI> lays the dust, and mightily befriends a pleasant walk or Journey. Even so the <HI>Waters of the Sanctu∣ary</HI> sometimes come in an impetuous manner, and powerfully bear down our filthy Lusts and cleanse our ways: and sometimes the small droppings of the Word gently distill, and so lay our cor∣ruptions, which otherwise the wind of Tempta∣tion wou'd blow up to defile us, and to blind our eyes, and stop us in our course, or turn us out of the path, and run us upon boggs, and into sloughs and miles.—It might be further observed here, that <HI>Rain</HI>-water is the most cleansing, if we use it to wash our selves with; in this the <HI>Word</HI> is like unto it.</P>
<P>HITHERTO I have spoken of the Word only in it's <HI>general</HI> notion: We may now view the several more eminent <HI>Parts</HI> of it <HI>distinctly,</HI> which seem to be these, viz. <HI>Truths, Precepts, Threatnings, Promises, Histories, Examples,</HI> and consi∣der how all and each do operate to purify the heart, and promote the Sanctification of the whole Man.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Word have a cleansing
<PB N="114" REF="002024_0121_0FBA7942F5237848"/>
efficacy. The Dogmatical, or Doctrinal part of Scripture, or those <HI>Truths,</HI> that are the ob∣ject of Faith, have a rational tendency, and moral influence to promote our holy living. 'Twas the reproach of the <HI>Heathen</HI> Theology, that on many accounts it was the instrument of vice; it ascribed not only the weak passion, but odious vices of Men to the God's, representing <HI>Jupiter</HI> as an Adul∣terer, <HI>Bacchus</HI> as a Drunkard, &amp;c. And many of their sacred Mysteries, as well as solemn Ceremonies, (as one observes) <HI>were of such a Nature, that instead of refining and elevating, they rather corrupted and debased their Votaries,</HI> and immerst them in all those abominable pollutions, which sober Nature abhorr'd, and which render'd 'em more vile than than the filthiest Brutes. But now the Prin∣ciples, and Truths, and Mysteries in the Word of God, have a proper influence towards the spi∣ritualizing and purifying of us, and perfecting our Natures. The Apostle calls the Doctrine of the Gospel a <HI>Form of sound Words,</HI> (2 Tim. 1.3.) <HI>Whole∣some Words,</HI> (1 Tim. 6.3.) i.e. pure and incorrupt in themselves, &amp; tending to prevent spiritual distem∣pers, or restore to the Soul it's spiritual health: <HI>and a Doctrine according to Godliness,</HI> i.e. tending to the advancement of practical Piety. So the Apostle styles it, (Tit. 1.1.) <HI>The Truth which is after Godliness,</HI> i. e. productive of Godliness. "Lusts grow from Error and Deceit; hence they are call'd <HI>Lusts of Deceit:</HI> and Holiness grows up from Truth; hence it is call'd, <HI>The Holiness of Truth.</HI> (Eph. 4.22.4.) This is the triumphal Chariot, wherein Christ rides Majestically to the conquest of Hearts. Psal. 45.4. <HI>And in thy Majesty ride prosperously, because of Truth or</HI> upon thy Truth".
<PB N="115" REF="002024_0122_0FBA79446E4CF378"/>
Hence, the Apostle calls the Doctrine of the Gospel <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r most holy Faith</HI> (Jud ver. 20.) as being the means of promoting holiness in us. So we read of being <HI>purify'd by Faith, and sanctify'd by Faith,</HI> (Act. 13.9.—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) i.e. The Christian Doc∣trine suitably entertain'd and apply'd by the be∣lieving Soul. So we read, (Joh. 17.17, 19.) of being <HI>sanctify'd thro' the Truth,</HI> and <HI>of purifying our Souls in obeying the Truth,</HI> (1 Pet. 1.22.) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.e. in subjecting our selves to the Truth of the Gospel. The A∣postle tells us, (1 Tim. 1.5.) <HI>The end of the Command∣ment</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which some say signifies properly a <HI>Declaration) is Charity, out of a pure heart, and a good Conscience, and Faith unfeigned.</HI> All the Ar∣ticles of the Creed are designed and adapted to lead us into the exercise of Godliness, &amp; to make us Partakers of Holiness; to abstract us from material &amp; sensible objects, and to cleanse us from our fleshly impurities. — Here we are led into the most just apprehensions of the Blessed God, His Nature, Perfections, and Works, so sublime, as to strike us into a reverential Awe of Him, and yet so endearing as to inflame our Love, and charm us into an imitation of His moral and imitable Excellencies. Here we have represented to us the dignity of the Divine Image, and our present capacity or susceptibleness of it, &amp; this tends to fire us with a generous ambition of assimilation to God. Here we have an account of the guilt, and filth and misery of our natural estate, and this tends to check the tumor of pride and ar∣rogance, and to make us low in our own Eyes: Here we are taught the vileness, deformity and malignity of Sin, that it is loathsome and pro∣voking to God, and injurious to our own Souls,
<PB N="116" REF="002024_0123_0FBA79472CC27730"/>
and this tends to incense us against Sin, and ex∣cite our penitential sorrow for it: Here we have the infinite advantages, and ineffable beauties of holiness displayed, and this tends to enamour us with Religion: Here we are told the vanity of the World, which tends to take off our thot's and affections from things below: and here Life and Immortality are brought to Light, and the Glories of the future state emblazoned, which has a happy tendency to make us <HI>set our affections on Things above, and labour for the Meat which pe∣risheth not</HI>; and here the Terrors of Death, and the Horrors of Hell beneath are set before us, which tends to quicken us to <HI>flee from the Wrath to come,</HI> and to <HI>lay hold on Eternal Life.</HI> And the great Gospel-Doctrines, <HI>that Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners,</HI> that <HI>He gave Himself to redeem us from all iniquity,</HI> and <HI>to destroy the works of the Devil,</HI> and to bring us into the <HI>Glo∣rious Liberty of the Sons of God, &amp;c.</HI> These Truths are a means to create in us an aver∣sion and indignation against <HI>Sin,</HI> (which was the meritorious and procuring cause of Christ's Death and Sufferings, and which in the Cross of Christ appears so exceeding sinful, &amp; exceeding hurtful,) and tends to excite our desires and endeavours to obtain that <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit,</HI> which is the blessed purchase of Christ's Death, and to get our <HI>Consciences purged from dead works by his Blood,</HI> and <HI>the Old Man</HI> in us <HI>crucify'd with Him,</HI> and <HI>the Body of Sin destroy'd by His Cross.</HI>—The Mystery of Christ is call'd the Mystery of <HI>God∣liness,</HI> (1 Tim. 3.16.) partly and principally because it tends to encourage and enforce the practice of Piety. Hence the Apostle puts these two things
<PB N="117" REF="002024_0124_0FBA794B5846DBE8"/>
together, <HI>growing in Grace, and in the Knowledge</HI> of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, (2 Pet. 3.18.) So (<HI>Chap.</HI> 1.2, 3.) He speaks of <HI>Grace being multiply'd thro' the knowledge</HI> of God and of Jesus our Lord, and says, that <HI>all things are given to us,</HI> that <HI>per∣tain to life and godliness,</HI> (i.e. that tend to cherish the life of Godliness, or promote holy Living) <HI>thro' the knowledge of Him that hath called us to Glory and Vertue.</HI> And <HI>in a Word,</HI> there is no Mystery in Scripture, that is like the <HI>Tree of Knowlege; only pleasant to the Eye, and a Tree to be desired to make one wise</HI>; but every mystery, if pursued in its just and genuine consequences, is to us as the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> from whence we may gather the fruits of righteousness. There is no Doctrine of natural or revealed Religion so ab∣struse and speculative, but some practical appli∣cation may be made of it. Some Articles at <HI>first</HI> view indeed seem to be altogetheri sipid &amp; barren, as to Piety and Devotion, and to receive their end in Theory; but "as the Licorish stick, at first, looks like any Weed, but chew it and you suck sweetness; so those <HI>Mysteries,</HI> that seem to be most contemplative &amp; remote from practice", have a vein of Piety running thro' 'em and en∣riching them, and a sacred vertue may be ex∣tracted from 'em, to promote vital practical God∣liness, &amp; cherish the true spirit of Devotion. Hence we are said to <HI>adorn the Doctrine of God our Sa∣viour in all things,</HI> (Tit. 2.10.12.) when thereby we are influenced to <HI>deny ungodliness &amp; worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in the present world,</HI> and we blemish the Gospel, and give occasion for the <HI>way of truth to be evil spoken of,</HI> (2 Pet. 2.2.) when we do not <HI>hold the mystery of Faith in a pure Conscience.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="002024_0125_0FBA79504843E3F8"/>SUCH is the Genius and transcendent Excel∣lency of Scripture-truths, they tend to make us holy, <HI>working effectually in them that believe</HI>; (1 Thes. 2.13.) and they carry with them a peculiar at∣tractive power to <HI>engage</HI> our <HI>belief</HI> of them. There is a visible stamp of Divinity upon them, and a mighty evidence, and force of reason &amp; majesty shining in them; There is an unparallel'd strain of Rhetorick in the Word, (<HI>The Truth as it is in Jesus,</HI>) far above the art and insinuations of the most celebrated Orators. It sets off all it's <HI>faith∣ful sayings,</HI> with an uncommon Life, with a charm∣ing beauty, and agreeable simplicity &amp; perspicuity, (which is voted by the best Masters of Oratory to be the <HI>truest</HI> Eloquence) so as to render them <HI>worthy of all acceptation,</HI> and to work the mind into a religious prostration and succumbency. Scripture-Truths come recommended with all the motives of credibility, and adorned with the Authority and majesty of God, and are wisely calculated to convey information to the Under∣standing, and conviction to the Mind, to awe us into a belief of them, and to make good impressi∣ons on the Conscience, and influence the practic Powers. Hence it is said, (Psal. 19.7.) <HI>The Doctrine of the Lord is perfect, restoring the Soul</HI>; [as the Margin of some of your Bibles renders it.]</P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Precepts</HI> of the Word have a cleansing efficacy. Consider here,</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY <HI>oblige to the most exact and exalted purity.</HI> The Word of God gives us a most <HI>strict,</HI> as well as <HI>sure</HI> rule of Life. It has not only re∣duc'd our "duty to a greater <HI>certainty,</HI> but rais'd it to a greater <HI>perfection</HI>", than any other Insti∣tution in the World. The Gospel supplys the
<PB N="119" REF="002024_0126_0FBA7952006FCD18"/>
defects of the Jewish Law, and corrects the Er∣rors of the Heathen Philosophy. It forbids all Sin of every denomination &amp; degree; It strictly enjoins universal Holiness, and commands that we labour after the most critical &amp; consummate obedience in all instances of duty. 'Tis true indeed, that personal complete obedience, <HI>as the Condition of the Covenant, or Term of Salvation,</HI> is not expected nor demanded under the Gospel, which makes allowance for our infirmities and short-comings; if <HI>that</HI> had remain'd, we must have perish't for ever: But notwithstanding, the Law, <HI>as a Rule,</HI> obliges without abating at all of it's bind∣ing force, or contracting it's genuine extent.— There are not in the Word of God any impure indulgences, it gives no countenance to Sin in the least. It prohibits not only <HI>outward</HI> gross acts of pollution and sensuality; but all <HI>inward</HI> irre∣gularity of thou't, and carnality of affection: It requires the real and internal mortification of every Lust, every favourite-Lust, without excep∣tion. <HI>The Commandment is exceeding broad,</HI> Psal. 119.96. It reaches to the whole Man &amp; to our whole behaviour under all circumstances: And <HI>the Law is spiritual,</HI> (Rom. 7.14.) exceeding spiritual, and very pure. It commands us to abandon every evil way, to stifle Sin in it's very first invisible conception in the heart, to fly the instruments or occasions of it, to abstain from all appearances of evil, and approaches to it: In a Word, whatso∣ever looks like Sin, or leads unto it, is to be dreaded and avoided, as interfering with pure Religion: it forbids even a <HI>lustful tho't,</HI> and a <HI>covetous desire</HI>; it lays a restraint on the most re∣tir'd motions of the Soul, and corrects those se∣cret
<PB N="120" REF="002024_0127_0FBA7952B4B09620"/>
risings of rebellion within, in which the most inquiring Philosophers cou'd discern nothing of vitiosity or impurity. By the tenor of the Divine Law we are unclean, if we do not study to avoid even the least pollution in heart &amp; life; "Yea, by the measures of the Gospel, we are unclean, unless we <HI>have active purities</HI>". We must follow after all positive substantial Holiness, and exer∣cise real Grace, and not only so, but endeavour to <HI>excel in Vertue,</HI> and <HI>grow in Grace</HI>; and we must not only comply with all matters of abso∣lute Duty, but <HI>whatsoever things are honest,</HI> or be∣coming our Profession, <HI>lovely and of good report,</HI> desireable, commendable, and justly <HI>approved of Men,</HI> even these Things must be consider'd and drawn into practice. <HI>We must exercise our selves to have always Consciences void of offen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e both to∣ward God, and toward Man,</HI> (Act. 24.16.) We must walk <HI>circumspectly,</HI> (Eph. 5.15.) accurately, exactly, unrebukably. We must endeavour to <HI>live in all good Conscience,</HI> and to <HI>walk in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the Lord, blameless,</HI> (Luk. 1.6.) We must <HI>ever follow that which is good both among our selves and to all Men,</HI> (1 Thes. 5.15.) and be <HI>perfect in every good work,</HI> (Heb. 13.21.) and <HI>stand complete in all the will of God,</HI> (Col. 4.12.) and <HI>be holy in all manner of conversation,</HI> (1 Pet. 1.15.) we must endeavour to <HI>walk worthy of the Lord,</HI> (1 Thes. 2.12.) we must strive and aim to recover our <HI>pri∣mitive</HI> innocence, yea to attain <HI>Angelical</HI> Sanctity, yea a <HI>Divine</HI> Purity. Tho' we <HI>come short,</HI> yet we must <HI>follow after.</HI> (Phil. 3.12.) We must <HI>be Followers,</HI> Imitators, <HI>of God us dear Children,</HI> (Eph. 5.1.) We must aspire <HI>to be holy, as He who hath called us is holy,</HI> to <HI>purify our selves, even as Christ is pure,</HI>
<PB N="121" REF="002024_0128_0FBA79554C01B330"/>
(1 Joh. 3.3.) and to be <HI>perfect, as our Heavenly Fa∣ther is perfect,</HI> (Mar. 5.48.) We must <HI>press toward the work,</HI> (Phil. 3.14.) and <HI>be always abounding in the work of the Lord,</HI> (1 Cor. 15.58.) <HI>if by any means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may attain unto the resurrection of the Dead,</HI> the purity of the Resurrection state. — Unto such an height of holiness (we see) the Law of God ob∣liges us. Well then might the Psalmist say, <HI>The Commandment of the Lord is pure, the Judgments of the Lord are righteous altogether:</HI> (Psal. 19.8, 9.) and surely they that <HI>walk according to this rule,</HI> must needs be <HI>blameless and harmless, and unrebukable in holiness, shining as Lights in the World.</HI> They that <HI>keep these Precepts diligently,</HI> must needs <HI>perfect holiness,</HI> and be remov'd from that <HI>which desileth and worketh abomination &amp; that maketh a lye.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE Precepts of the Word <HI>carry in them the highest Equiry and most evident Reason.</HI> They are founded in the Divine Nature, and are the visible Image of God's Holiness.—They are also commended to us by the Example of Christ; and require nothing of us, but what He who is the wisdom of God, tho't fit Himself to do.—And they are every way becoming the dignity and perfectly suited to the Nature and Condition of Man. They contain nothing, but what is entirely agreeable to the genuine dictates of natural Rea∣son, and the regular inclinations of the humane Will, and what has ever been approv'd, consented to and conform'd to by the wisest and best of Men. Obedience to them is the <HI>exercise</HI> of our reasonable Powers, and the <HI>exaltation</HI> of our rational Nature. (The Law of God tends to the perfection of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Galai I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gia, <HI>&amp;c. pag. 179.</HI></NOTE> as <HI>it orders and directs all

Hence the Apostle calls the Law of God <HI>a perfect Law of Liberty,</HI> (Jam. 1.25.) And hence the Psalmist makes that profession, (Psal. 119.45.) <HI>I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy Pretepts.</HI> And hear how <HI>Moses</HI> challenges all the World to shew a Body of Laws so wise and equal, so honorable and good—Deut. 4.6, 8. <HI>What Nation is there so great</HI> or famous, <HI>that hath statutes and judgments so righ∣teous, as all this Law which I set before you this day? Keep therefore and do them, for this is your wisdom, and for your good,</HI> (Deut. 10.13.) And hear how the Apostle magnifies the Law, telling us that <HI>the Commandment is holy, just and good,</HI> (Rom. 7.12.) that the <HI>obedience of Faith is a reasonable service,</HI> &amp; that to <HI>prove the will of God,</HI> is to prove <HI>what is good, acceptable and perfect,</HI> (Rom. 12.1, 2.) And do we not read, (Isai. 46.8.) that to <HI>turn our feet unto God's Testimonies,</HI> is to <HI>shew our selves Men?</HI> When we <HI>keep</HI> the Commandments of God, <HI>we walk as Men,</HI> we act like <HI>reasonable</HI> Crea∣tures: This is worthy the noble and exalted powers, which set Man above the common level of the visible Creation; and by this we attain the great end of our Being, and secure our high∣est interests: whereas to <HI>violate</HI> the Divine Pre∣cepts is to cross the design of our Creation, to prostitute our excellent Nature, and render our selves <HI>more vile</HI> and miserable <HI>than the Beasts that perish. Sin is a reproach,</HI> and Lust a hard Master: but the Service of God is the truest Freedom, and puts the noblest Character upon us. It is the
<PB N="123" REF="002024_0130_0FBA795809245CD0"/>
employment of our best powers for the best ends. — Let none then <HI>charge God foolishly,</HI> as if His <HI>Ways were unequal,</HI> or traduce His <HI>Commandments as grievous</HI> Impositions. Verily all the wit of Angels and Men cou'd never have drawn up such a com∣plete, unerring and unexceptionable System of Laws as those of God. Upon an exact calculati∣on and due consideration of things we shall find, that the Divine Laws both moral and positive are the most wisely chosen, the most equitable, condescending &amp; beneficent, the most excellently adapted to the nature and circumstances of Men, and so every way fitted to court our love, to capti∣vate and engage every one's rational choice, and religious observation. They are <HI>faithful sayings and worthy of all acceptation. — More to be de∣sired than Gold.</HI> They have no <HI>Pefect</HI> in them that shou'd demand any <HI>Additions,</HI> nor <HI>Error</HI> that shou'd call for <HI>Correction,</HI> nor <HI>Rigour</HI> that shou'd require <HI>Moderation:</HI> But they have such an undeniable fulness, purity, perspicuity and reasonableness, as challenges our <HI>observation,</HI> and must needs recommend them to all Men of impartial judg∣ment &amp; unprejudic'd reason.— And it is owing to the ignorance and malignity, pride and per∣verseness of Men's hearts, if they live in the transgression and contempt of God's righteous Judgments. They are the <HI>froward in heart</HI> and <HI>the Fools in Israel</HI> that despise and break the Com∣mandment. Such are at war with their own Con¦sciences, and bid defiance to their own reason, and the avowed principles of Mankind. <HI>There is no judgment in their goings; Their way is their folly.

THE Precepts of the Word carry in them <HI>the most Sacred and Sovereign Authority.</HI> The <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> God, shines in them with the strongest light, which gives them the most awing and governing authority over the Con∣sciences of Men, &amp; on this depends their cleansing efficacy.—Under the notion of <HI>were Rules,</HI> the Precepts of the Word only <HI>direct</HI> us to cleanse our way; and consider'd as <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>good</HI> Rules they are apt to <HI>perswade</HI>: but consider'd as the <HI>will of God,</HI> our King and Judge, they carry with them a transcendent <HI>power</HI> and <HI>authority</HI> to <HI>oblige</HI> and <HI>constrain</HI> us to universal Purity.— <HI>Authority</HI> it is, that gives <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>influence</HI> to any Rules or Constitutions.

They bear the most palpable and indelible impresses of a Divine Authority. Here are visible the bright footsteps of infinite Wisdom, Justice, Holiness and Goodness. The Precepts of the Word are an authentic Copy of the Divine Perfections and an uncounterfeit Instrument of God's revealed Will. They bear the royal Stamp, and carry in them such an uncontestible and irresistible <HI>Authority,</HI> as produces (at least) an <HI>intellectual</HI> veneration and submission in the most harden'd Rebels. <HI>Where the word of a King is, there is power.</HI> Surely every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of <HI>God,</HI> the King of Kings, must come armed with un∣controllable authority and majesty: and who is <HI>able to resist the wisdom and spirit of power,</HI> which breaths in His universal Law? Therein the great Lawgiver speaks to us <HI>as One having Authority. The Word of God is quick and powerful</HI> (vital and eperative) <HI>and sharper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the joynts and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd is dis∣cerner of the thought &amp; intents of the heart,</HI> (Heb. 4.12.) The Precepts of the Word pierce to the hid∣den and most intimate parts of the Sinner, they go to the very Well Head &amp; first springs of motion, and take cognizance of the most secret initial workings of Lust, &amp; powerfully strike conviction into the brawny Conscience, breaking thro' all
<PB N="126" REF="002024_0133_0FBA795FDBA963F0"/>
opposit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and "bind down a sense of guilt" on the mind, admonish, accuse and condemn even where the most accurate Precepts of Philosophy cou'd never reach, &amp; where the strictest methods of humane Discipline have no influence. — Hence the Law of God is very justly call'd <HI>the royal Law,</HI> (Jam. 2.8.) It is the chief and sovereign Law, &amp; it carries a <HI>most Kingly Power, Grandour</HI> and <HI>August Majesty,</HI> that when it <HI>speaks,</HI> every atten∣tive mind cannot but hear the <HI>Voice of God,</HI> which strikes with awe &amp; commands reverence. And this is the peculiar advantage of the Divine Law, which gives it superior influence above all other Laws. This <HI>magnifies it, and makes it ho∣norable,</HI> and powerful. The dread Majesty of God, so conspicuous in the Divine Precepts, gives them a far more exceeding imperative authority and impressive power.</P>
<P>NOW (to conclude this Head) Do the Precepts of the Word aim at such <HI>high Purity,</HI> and do they carry in them such uncontestible <HI>Reason</HI> to re∣commend them, &amp; such uncontrollable <HI>Authority</HI> to enforce them: Then they are extremely fitted to make their own way into the hearts of Men; &amp; where they find suitable entertainment, will be an efficacious means to cleanse our way. They are of such a <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>complexion,</HI> and so <HI>qualify'd,</HI> as that they are very apt to draw Men's regards, and win us over to the observance of them; and <HI>as many as walk according to these Rules,</HI> must needs <HI>be undefiled in the way, and without rebuke.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. THE <HI>Threatnings</HI> of the Word have a cleansing efficacy. The wise Legislator has seen meet to annex a <HI>minatory</HI> Sanction to His Law;
<PB N="127" REF="002024_0134_0FBA7961AF8B6EB8"/>
to be a Guardian of it's Authority and Honor, to be a <HI>Terror to Evil-Doers,</HI> and a dissuasive from <HI>Sin</HI> which is the <HI>Transgression of the Law.</HI> And the Divine Threatnings are every way fitted to subserve the designed end.</P>
<P>THIS I'll endeavour to clear under the following Conclusions. —</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>FEAR is a Passion, rooted in the Nature of Man.</HI> An Aversion to Misery is natural to every one. No Man is <HI>made without fear.</HI> — The Report of the Understanding is the Rule of the Will, in all regular motions of the Soul. What that represents as evil, and apprehends as future, this abhors and flies from. — Hence, The Threatnings of the Word which are messages of Evil to guilty Sinners, are a proper medium to use with them to restrain them from Sin, inasmuch as they address one of the Passions of humane Nature, and are a just Alarm to the Fears of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>FEAR is the most powerful Principle of Action.</HI> Hope &amp; Fear are the two great springs of motion in humane nature. But <HI>Fear</HI> is the <HI>more violent</HI> and <HI>vigorous</HI> Passion, "Usually the fear of Evil more deeply and strongly affects, than the hope of Good". And Fear is also more <HI>easily touch't.</HI> It is easier of access, as well as more impetuous in exercise. It has a <HI>quicker,</HI> as well as <HI>deeper,</HI> resentment. Fear is a tender, a zealous, and restless Passion. When <HI>struck</HI> with an object, it is more speedy and pressing in its flight, than Hope, when drawn by an object, is in it's pursuit. "Therefore Laws are secur'd by Punishments, not by Rewards". Hence the Threatnings of the Word are a most suitable Argument to make im∣pression
<PB N="128" REF="002024_0135_0FBA7963F5A801F8"/>
on Mankind, in that they are apt to work upon one of the <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st powerful</HI> and <HI>active</HI> Passions of Humanity.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE Divine Threatnings are completely fitted to be the most forceable excitations to Fear.</HI> They are every way excellently calculated to work <HI>powerfully, most</HI> powerfully, on the Fears of Men.</P>
<P>This will appear,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF we consider the <HI>Cleanness</HI> and <HI>Plainness</HI> of them. They are as full and express as possible. They are not given in <HI>dark hints:</HI> But are drawn in the <HI>clearest Colours.</HI> We have <HI>fair</HI> warning, <HI>sufficient</HI> notice of our danger, &amp; there is no room left for <HI>Doubts,</HI> that shou'd weaken the impression or lesson the terror of the Threatning. The Law of God <HI>Thunders</HI> out the dire Anathema, that, unless we stop our Ears, we cannot but <HI>hear the Words of the Curse</HI>: It <HI>lightens</HI> and <HI>flashes</HI> in our face, that unless we wilfully shut our Eyes, we cannot but see our fearful doom. — Now this is a great advantage to the Divine Threatnings. For the motive of Fear is an apparition of some Evil. And the clearer the report of danger is, so much the higher does our fear rise in proportion. Hence the Divine Threatnings, speaking so <HI>plainly,</HI> do speak the more <HI>sensibly,</HI> and the more effectu∣ally reach the Fears of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF we consider the <HI>infallible</HI> and <HI>inflexible Truth</HI> of them. The Evils, they denounce, are undoubted Realities: and the Comminations themselves are plainly revealed, and are <HI>accom∣pany'd with the strongest Motives of Credibility.</HI> They are delivered in the most preremptory Terms imaginable, and we've the highest assu∣rances of their certainty. The <HI>God of Truth (whose
<PB N="129" REF="002024_0136_0FBA7969EEB83098"/>
words endure forever</HI>) has <HI>revealed</HI> them <HI>from Hea∣ven,</HI> and hath added <HI>an Oath for confirmation,</HI> which <HI>is an end of all strife. Wherein God willing more abundantly to shew unto</HI> Sinners <HI>the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an Oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lye, we might have</HI> a <HI>strong</HI> perswasion, &amp; that there might be no room to dispute or question the Execution of His Threatnings. How con∣stantly are the Divine Menaces introduc'd with the solemn Preface—<HI>Thus saith the Lord</HI>— and, <HI>As I live, saith the Lord</HI>—? And how awfully do's the Lord <HI>swear in His Wrath</HI> against the obsti∣nate Sinner, where He saith, <HI>As I live, surely mine Oath, that He hath despised, even it will I recompence on his own head.</HI>— And this is one great Advantage to the Divine Threatnings, and gives them great power over Men's Fears. For the just Object of Fear is <HI>Evil apprehended as fu∣ture.</HI> The immediate ground of Fear is the <HI>ap∣prehension</HI> of an approaching Evil. 'Tis the <HI>sense</HI> of danger, that moves fear: and the stronger the apprehension of an Evil is, the stronger is the passi∣on against it. Hence the Divine Threatnings, giving us such <HI>full assurance</HI> and convincing evidence of the real futurity of the unseen Plagues &amp; Punish∣ments of the Wicked, must needs have a mighty force, to awaken and actuate the Fears of Sinners.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF we consider the superlative <HI>Greatness</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of them. The Threatned Evils are great, exceeding great, beyond expression, and above all conception. The Threatnings address us with a most formidable scene of Miseries, such as <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard of.</HI> Sinners are
<PB N="130" REF="002024_0137_0FBA796B4AB3F5B0"/>
threaten'd with extreme and everlasting punish∣ment, —a punishment, as intollerable as the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God cou'd <HI>invent</HI>; as severe, as the <HI>Holiness</HI> of God cou'd <HI>excite</HI> Him unto; as heavy, as the <HI>Power</HI> of God can <HI>inflict</HI>; and <HI>who knoweth the Power of His Anger? Strong is the Lord that judgeth, mighty in strength, wise in heart, and glorious in holiness.</HI> —The Divine Threatnings denounce <HI>infinite</HI> Evils, the most dreadful &amp; devouring, which the stout∣est atlas must tremble &amp; sink under, &amp; the weight whereof the most hardy Sinner has not patience nor power to endure.—The Scripture represents to us the <HI>Everlasting Punishment</HI> under a variety of Names, that speak terror &amp; amazement to every considering Soul. It is described by <HI>Death</HI>; by <HI>Slaughter</HI>; by <HI>Perdition and Destruction</HI>; by a <HI>Loss of the Soul</HI>; by a <HI>Destruction of Soul and Body in Hell</HI>; by <HI>Departing from God</HI>; by being <HI>cast into utter darkness</HI>; by <HI>Dwelling with devouring Fire and everlasting Burnings</HI>; and (which is the Sum of all) by <HI>abiding under the Wrath of God</HI>; and finally (which is the effect of all) by <HI>wailing and gnashing of teeth,</HI> and <HI>being in torments day &amp; night, for ever and ever.</HI> The threatned Punishment in∣comparably exceeds all the terrors of sense. The <HI>Sufferings of the present time,</HI> in their full Col∣lection and highest Degree, <HI>are not worthy to be compared with the</HI> misery to be inflicted on the Damned. It is <HI>worse than Death</HI>; it infinitely outweighs the utmost evils we can imagine, and infinitely out-reaches our most unbounded fears. <HI>Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath,</HI> and in∣finitely more, <HI>Psal.</HI> 90.11.— "One spark of God's Wrath firing the Conscience, is more ter∣rible, than the most fearful Evils in the World",
<PB N="113" REF="002024_0138_0FBA796D050C05D0"/>
to affect, and excite the fears of Men. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. The Damnation of Hell</HI> is infinitely terrible. <HI>The Sinners in Zion</HI> may well be <HI>afraid, and fear∣fulness surprize the Hypocrite,</HI> when they think of the <HI>Fire and Brimestone, and the horrible Tem∣pest,</HI> that will be <HI>the Portion of their Cup.</HI>—The expected Evil must be look'd upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great, pon∣derous and powerful, and not (<HI>easily,</HI> at least) to be grapled with, in order to it's creating fear and causing fright. And the degree of Fear is ordinarily correspondent to the apprehended bigness and weight of the object. Therefore the Divine Threatnings which are charg'd with Evils of such an huge bulk and tremendous aspect, and which make so big a Thunder, must needs (if they be duly consider'd and attended to) work most prevalently on the passion of Fear, &amp; raise it to the highest pitch. <HI>Destruction from God</HI> must needs be <HI>a Terror to us. Our flesh</HI> may well <HI>trem∣ble for fear of it.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Consider, THE <HI>imminent danger</HI> Sinners are <HI>daily</HI> in of the <HI>Execution</HI> of the Divine Threat∣nings upon them. The wicked &amp; impenitent are every day obnoxious to revenging Justice. Black Clouds of Divine Wrath <HI>hover</HI> over <HI>their heads,</HI> and threaten bitter desolations; and who knows how <HI>soon</HI> Almighty Vengeance may like Thun∣der <HI>surprize</HI> careless Sinners, <HI>and in a moment utterly consume them? When they are saying, peace and safety; then sudden destruction</HI> may <HI>come upon them, and overtake them as a thief,</HI> and they <HI>shall not escape,</HI> (1 Thes. 5.3, 4.) God in His long-suffer∣ing waits to be gracious; but His patience will sooner or later have had <HI>its perfect work,</HI> &amp; His
<PB N="132" REF="002024_0139_0FBA796E8BA31870"/>
Threatnings will surely one day have their com∣plete accomplishment on rebellious Sinners. <HI>The Vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: tho' it tarry, it will surely come, it will not tarry,</HI> (Hab. 2.3.) And, for ought any one knows, the appointed time of <HI>forbearance</HI> may be just <HI>expiring</HI>; and the time of <HI>vengeance</HI> may be <HI>hast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> upon him, even the sad time when Justice shall triumph in the sudden execution of the Curses, written against the Ungodly.— Hence, the Divine Threatnings must needs deep∣ly touch the Spirits of every considering Sinner. For as the bigger the Evil, the greater the Terror: so the <HI>nigher</HI> an Evil approaches, the <HI>higher</HI> our dread rises in proportion. Apprehended nearness gives us a quicker and stronger resent∣ment of danger. It is then a great advantage to the Divine Threatnings, that the Scripture leaves the particular time of their Execution uncertain, and in general represents it as <HI>near at hand, even at the Door.</HI> And it exposes the mad presumption of that evil Servant, that saith — <HI>My Lord delayeth his coming.</HI> It tells us the fearful danger there is in <HI>putting far from us the evil Day,</HI> and warns us not to flatter our selves with the vain hopes of a long indulgence; and <HI>exhorts</HI> us to <HI>flee from the wrath to come,</HI> and <HI>so much the more, because the day approacheth.</HI> The Word of God represents Sinners, as standing on the very <HI>brink</HI> of misery, as hanging over the <HI>mouth of the pit,</HI> and being <HI>in danger of Hell-fire.</HI>—And is not this matter of <HI>trembling</HI> consideration? What <HI>more fearful</HI> Lesson of horror cou'd be read to secure Sinners to awaken them? This redoubles the terror of the Threatning.—We read, that <HI>Sampson,</HI> when
<PB N="133" REF="002024_0140_0FBA79700CFD16A8"/>
asleep in the embraces of his beloved <HI>Delilah,</HI> awoke immediately on that cry,—<HI>The Philistines be upon thee, Sampson.</HI> But that is a more <HI>dreadful sound, —The Wrath of God is upon thee, Sinner, and the pains of Hell, and the horrors of an Everlasting Darkness, are getting hold upon thee!</HI>—And surely if Men are not deaf, they can't sleep out these terrible Claps of Thunder, it must needs startle their Consciences, and <HI>put them in fear,</HI> chill their Lusts, and awaken very careful thot's how they may escape the impending Evils. "Do but <HI>believe,</HI> and you must <HI>tremble,</HI> were you a Devil". God hangs the Sinner over the flames of Hell, and causes the devouring Fire to sparkle and flash in his Eyes; and if this doth not daunt and scare him, what can God do more to terrify the audacious Wretch?</P>
<P N="5">5. Consider; THE Divine Threatnings <HI>are pro∣portioned to the Sinners Provocations.</HI> There is an exact harmony or correspondence between our Guilt and Doom. All the impenitent are under the condemning Sentence of the Law,—a Sentence big with frightful horrors. But some do not Sin under so easy circumstances as others, their Sins are loaded with peculiar aggravations; as being committed against clearer Light, more endearing Love, and stronger Bonds, longer con∣tinu'd in, and oftner repeated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now as these things and the like, do enhance their Guilt, so they do entitle Sinners to a <HI>greater Damnation,</HI> and fill their Sentence with more heavy and ghasdy woes. By every Sin addition is made to the number of our deserved stripes, &amp; the weight of our future punishment. And thus the sma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a Rod gradually arises to the torment of
<PB N="134" REF="002024_0141_0FBA7973C62574B0"/>
a Scorpion.— And this Consideration adds to the terror of the Divine Threatnings, makes them to appear with a most grim and dreadful face, to speak in a whirlwind with the loudest and most moving accents, and to shoot their ar∣rows with fiery indignation.</P>
<P N="6">6. Consider; THE Threatnings are <HI>back'd with the most pathetical and powerful Expostulations.</HI> God, who is <HI>the God of Patience,</HI> spares the wick∣ed, suspends the infliction of condign punishment, stretches out His Hand all the day to gain saying Rebels, and warns them of their danger, meets them in their mad carriere, sets the point of His glittering Sword against them, and the terrors of Death in battel-array before them to check their presumption, and offers all the dear dissuasives of Love to bank up their way, and with many compassionate Calls beseeches them to <HI>depart from the snares of Death,</HI> and with the tender sympathy of a Friend and Father He rea∣sons the case with perishing Sinners,—<HI>O Genera∣tion, ye have not obeyed my voice, why have ye done this? Wherefore say ye, we are Lords, we will not come unto thee? What iniquity do you find in me? Why will you contend with me? Who ever harden'd himself against Me and prosper'd? Cannot I do with you even as this Potter? Do ye provoke me to jea∣sousy? Are ye stronger than I? Turn ye, turn ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for why wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ye die? Why shouldst thou destroy thy self?</HI> And He upbraids their folly, &amp; laments their obstinacy, <HI>How long ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Fa∣ther, thou art the guide of my Youth? Wee unto thee, wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be? How long will thy vain tho'ts ledge with∣in
<PB N="135" REF="002024_0142_0FBA7975DB979940"/>
thee? Circumcise your selves unto the Lord; lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong in the day that I shall deal with thee? And what will ye do in the day of visitation, when I shall blow upon you in my wrath? To whom will ye flee for help? And where will ye leave your glory?</HI>—Thus do's the Lord, who might instantly in Justice let fly at Sinners, mercifully stoop to debate with them, &amp; to argue the case with bleeding bowels. And these gracious Expostulations and Expro∣brations speak with the most piercing conviction to guilty self-destroying Souls. There is a pe∣culiar emphasis in these solemn Appeals and affectionate Interrogations: They prick the Heart, and stab the Conscience; they are as so many pointed darts, or piercing stings.</P>
<P>THUS we see, that the Threatnings of the Word are every way <HI>a most powerful</HI> argument to excite the fears of Men; enough to shake the proudest Cedars, and strike the stoutest Sinners into trembling horror.—<HI>Which was the 3d Thing.</HI></P>
<P>Pass we now to the Last Particular; which is.</P>
<P N="4">4ly. <HI>FEAR is a very strong Dissuasive from Sin, and the ordinary initial Motive to Religion.</HI> It is the <HI>foundation of Repentance from dead works,</HI> and <HI>of Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Conviction of Guilt, and Fear of the Wrath of God, are the first steps to Conversion, and the ground-work of Reformation. Sinners generally will not be bro't to Repentance, nor entertain a serious tho't of Heaven, till they meet with a rough Sea, and an horrible Tempest; 'till they are stormed with
<PB N="136" REF="002024_0143_0FBA7976B751D5B0"/>
black and dismal terrors, they will never quit the embraces of their beloved Lusts; 'Till tor∣tur'd on the rack of a wounded Conscience, they will not confess &amp; give glory to God; 'Till they are bro't to a sense of their danger &amp; perishing condition, they will not be perswaded to repair to the Great Physician; 'Till stung with the ar∣rows of God, they will not look to the brazen Serpent; they will not fly to the City of Re∣fuge, 'till driven by the Avenger of Blood. Sin will not be a burthen, nor Christ pretious to them, 'till Destruction from God be a terror to 'em. But when the Divine Threatnings strike a dread upon the Conscience, and awaken an affecting sense of Danger, This tends to produce a flight from the ways of wickedness, &amp; a disposition &amp; application unto serious Godliness. The pressures of fear are a damp to the pleasures of Sin, and tend to make the bond of iniquity to be the gall of bitterness to us. Prevailing fear tends to embitter Sin and to cool the heat of Lust, to check the power of corruptions within, and to disarm, controll and conquer temptations with∣out; For as the Wise Man observes, (Prov. 1.17.) <HI>Surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird</HI>: perceiving the snare, it will fly the bait. And when Men <HI>know</HI> and feel <HI>the terrors of the Lord,</HI> This tends to put them upon <HI>working out their Salvation with fear &amp; trembling.</HI> When they are <HI>afraid of his Judgment,</HI> this incline them to <HI>hearken to reproof,</HI> &amp; and <HI>receive instruction,</HI> to <HI>learn righte∣ousness,</HI> &amp; <HI>break off from their sins by repentance.</HI> Solo∣mon tells us, Pro. 166. <HI>By the fear of the Lord, Mende∣part from Evil.</HI> So (Ch. 8.13.) <HI>The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.</HI> The Psalmist observes, (Ps. 19.9.) <HI>The fear
<PB N="137" REF="002024_0144_0FBA797838E72F38"/>
the Lord is clean,</HI> (as in it's own nature, so) in it's effects. It is preliminary and introductory to pure Religion. It is a strong curb of restraint, to keep us back from the soul ways of Sin; and a sharp spur of constraint, to excite us to obedience, and quicken us in the way of righteousness. Fear will put the Sinner upon Expostulating, with tempted <HI>Joseph, — How can I do this great wick∣edness, and sin against God?</HI>—and upon enquir∣ing with the trembling <HI>Jaylor,—What must I do to be saved?</HI>— It will put the Sinner upon considering with the repenting Prodigal,—<HI>How many hired Servants of my Father have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger:</HI> and upon resolving with him,—<HI>I will arise and go to my Father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son; make me as one of thy hired Servants.</HI>— Repentance ordinarily takes it's <HI>first rise</HI> from a sense of the guilt, misery and danger of a natural state. Legal Terrors <HI>open the ear to</HI> the Spirit's <HI>discipline,</HI> and <HI>prepare the way of the Lord.</HI> When a Man sees <HI>Evil pursuing</HI> him, and his <HI>heart meditates terror,</HI> how willing will he be to hearken to any probable Methods of <HI>Escape,</HI> and how welcome the views of some sure <HI>Sanctuary</HI> at hand, to retreat unto? So, the Sinner, when <HI>warned of God, and mov'd with fear</HI> at the dreadful reports of Wrath in the Threat∣nings of the Law, how does this dispose him to entertain the blessed reports of Mercy, and em∣brace the offers of Life in the Promises of the Gospel? The Terrors of Everlasting Death pre∣pare him to receive the <HI>glad Tidings of Salvation</HI> by Christ, and to <HI>fly for refuge to lay hold on the
<PB N="138" REF="002024_0145_0FBA797FE9FC7D48"/>
hope set before him.</HI>
<Q>The fear of Hell at first disposes us for the love of Heaven: to escape the one, we fly to the other. Were it not for the Torments of Hell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> Fol. pag. 227.</NOTE> (which are more easily conceiv'd by us, whilst we are cloathed with Flesh, than Coelestial Joys, and therefore more strongly affect us) Heaven wou'd be neglected, and be as empty of Saints, as 'tis full of Glory. To awaken us out of the deep lethargy of sensual Lusts, (the most pleasant musick is ineffectual,) nothing less is requisite than cutting &amp; scari∣fying</Q>.
Sinners will "break thro' the hedge of the Law, unless they feel those wounding Thorns, the fearful Threatnings in it". The fear of God is <HI>the beginning of wisdom,</HI> the <HI>first</HI> piece of the <HI>Armour of Light,</HI> the <HI>commencing essay</HI> of repentance, and <HI>initiative</HI> to holiness of Life. The <HI>Spirit of bondage to fear,</HI> which comes in by the application of the Threatnings, prepares the way for the <HI>Spirit of Adoption,</HI> which comes in by the application of the Promises. <HI>The Law is a Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ,</HI> (Gal. 3.24.) And when Legal Terrors are ballanc'd &amp; brigh∣ten'd with Evangelical Hopes, we shall rise to a blessed perfection in holiness. <HI>Fear alone</HI> is not of sufficient efficacy to cleanse our way: Hence God hath added many gracious <HI>Promises</HI> in His Word, to work upon us by the principle of <HI>Hope.</HI> Which leads me to another Head.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE <HI>Promises</HI> of the Word have a cleansing efficacy. It has pleased the Great Lawgiver to annex (not only a minatory, but also) a <HI>Promiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry</HI> Sancti∣on to His Law, which is every way fitted to draw forth our Hope, to endear and sacilitate our
<PB N="139" REF="002024_0146_0FBA7982C94B45C0"/>
duty, and excite to obedience. The great design and manifest tendency of the Divine Promises is to allure and engage us to cleanse our way. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, (2 Pet. 1, 4.) That they <HI>are given to us, that by these we might be partakers of the Divine Nature,</HI> i. e. transform'd into the image of Divine purity. And another Apostle uses them as an argument or incentive unto ho∣liness, (Rom. 12.1, 2.) <HI>I beseech you by the mercies of God, that ye present your selves a living sacri∣fice, holy, acceptable unto God; and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renew∣ing of your mind.</HI> So likewise (2 Cor. 7.1.) <HI>Having these promises, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit.</HI> q. d. Having such <HI>a price in our hands to get wisdom, the wisdom that is pure,</HI> having such a blessed motive and means to animate and assist, induce and enable us to cleanse our ways, as the Promises. Let us improve our happy advantage. — These Scriptures plainly show, that the <HI>end &amp; office, &amp; proper in∣fluence of the Divine Promises is to make us pure and holy.</HI>—And this is the Point, which I am now to <HI>illustrate.</HI> And here a very large Field of Discourse opens before us: But I shall content my self with these following Hints.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THE Promises have a purifying influence upon us, <HI>from the kind &amp; quality of the subject-matter, or Things offered in them.</HI> The Goods contained in the Promises are—</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>INFALLIBLY Real.</HI> They are not some illusory and imaginary Things, the <HI>shadows of a Dream,</HI> and the wild visions of luxuriant fancy that have no Being like <HI>the lying Vanities</HI> (which our <HI>deceitful Lusts</HI> do often promise us: but they

are substantial realities, <HI>bro't to light by the Gospel</HI> of Jesus Christ, who as He purchas'd them by His Death, so <HI>he has given assurance to all Men</HI> of the certainty and truth of them <HI>by his re∣surrection from the Dead.</HI> Now this thought lays a sure <HI>foundation</HI> for Desire and Hope; &amp; obliges us to cleanse our ways from a principle of self-love.</P>
<P N="2">2. ABSOLUTELY <HI>Necessary.</HI> The Contents of the Divine Promises are not indifferent and insignificant matters, of little or no concern to us, which we may be without or enjoy, and our case be much the same: No; but they are of infinite weight and indispensable necessity, the true foundation of humane felicity, <HI>the One Thing needful,</HI> upon which our <HI>All</HI> depends; To miss of which is utter ruin, but the enjoyment is our making for ever.—Now this Consideration has a mighty tendency to kindle desires, &amp; awaken endeavours to secure an interest in the blessed Promises.</P>
<P N="3">3. SUPERLATIVELY <HI>Excellent.</HI> Hence the Promises are call'd <HI>exceeding great and pretious Promises.</HI> (2 Cor. 7.1.) The Blessings, treasur'd up in them, are the most sublime and valuable; <HI>Better than Thousands of Gold and Sil∣ver; more sweet also than honey, and the honey-comb:</HI> unspeakably preferrible to the whole confluence of earthly Beatitudes; every way proportionable to our various necessities, equal to our cravings, and adaequate to our capacities, enough to satisfy our desires, satiate our hopes, and complete our happiness. Hence the Pro∣mises are suited to attract our affection &amp; tempt our ambition.—In every Man there is an un∣quenchable
<PB N="141" REF="002024_0148_0FBA7985B329A030"/>
thirst after felicity, altho' we pur∣sue various objects according to our different resentments of happiness; and when the object is consider'd as attainable, this begets hope, and hope produces endeavour. Hope is an operative and industrious Principle; 'tis the grand incen∣tive and instrument of active diligence; and it draws forth the practic Powers and invigorates our endeavours in <HI>proportion</HI> to the apprehended <HI>worth</HI> and importance of the desir'd Good. The greater and more excellent the object hoped for, the stronger influence will the hope of it have upon us, and the more powerfully will it wing and animate our endeavours, and draw us to use the means of obtaining it.— Now the Divine Promises engage the highest satisfactions, and propound the most desireable objects of Hope: and hence they must needs (if duly realiz'd and consider'd) have a very attractive influence on Men; for they address in the most <HI>powerful</HI> manner to the fundamental principle of self-love, which breeds insatiable <HI>Desires</HI> to promote our own happiness, and to the praedominant passion of Hope, which produces indefatigable <HI>Industry</HI> in the pursuit thereof. And those must be <HI>un∣reasonable Men,</HI> and divested of humanity, whom a belief of the Promises of God hath no influence upon, to induce 'em to serious Religion, which entitles to the highest happiness.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>SPIRITUAL and Rational.</HI> The Goods pre∣sented in the Promises <HI>are not carnal but spiritual</HI>; They are not the sordid trash of this vain pe∣rishing World, visible, material and sensual en∣joyments, <HI>Provision for the flesh,</HI> only suited to pamper the <HI>Body:</HI> But they are ghostly, imma∣terial,
<PB N="142" REF="002024_0149_0FBA7987AFCA0628"/>
supernatural, Angelical felicities. They are <HI>Spiritual Blessings,</HI> and <HI>Heavenly Things,</HI> (Eph. 1.3.) Manna from Heaven, fitted to refresh and ravish, to feast and solace the <HI>Soul,</HI> the great Soul of Man.— Indeed the <HI>Body</HI> is not utterly overlook'd. The Promises secure <HI>external Ne∣cessaries</HI> to the Godly in ordinary cases. <HI>Godli∣ness hath the promise of the Life that now is,</HI> (1 Tim. 4.8.) So we read, (Mat. 6.33.) <HI>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</HI> What Things? We are told in the foregoing verse; <HI>All these Things</HI> which <HI>your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of.</HI> Bread to eat and Raiment to put on.— But this provision for the Body is made with a remote view to the <HI>Soul,</HI> to ease and accommo∣date that. And the <HI>Capital</HI> Promises relate <HI>im∣mediately</HI> to the <HI>Soul:</HI> These are spiritual, in that the Goods they tender are of a spiritual nature, and the Recipient is the Spirit of Man.</P>
<P>NOW this <HI>Spirituality</HI> of the Promises doth tend by a sort of natural efficacy to dispose and engage Men to <HI>walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.</HI> Hence the Apostle observes, (1 Joh. 3.3.) <HI>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifyeth him∣self.</HI> If a Man have a firm belief of the Pro∣mises, a realizing view of the spirituality of the Goods promised, and any hope to obtain them, he must needs be concerned to get his vitiated appetite purged and his carnal mind spiritualiz'd, that he may be a meet subject of these refin'd and immaculate fruitions.</P>
<P>THUS I've argued from the Nature &amp; Quality of the Promises <HI>in general.</HI> I might now illustrate the Truth before us by an induction of <HI>Particu∣lars</HI>; And say,—</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="143" REF="002024_0150_0FBA7988B1278EA0"/>1. THE Promise of <HI>Pardon</HI> does manifestly and mightlly tend to animate and excite us to cleanse our ways. By this Promise the great impediments &amp; discouragements to Repentance are removed. Hereby our <HI>Unbelief is helped,</HI> and suspicious diffidence concerning God's reconcila∣bleness to Sinners superseded. The <HI>uncovenanted Goodness</HI> of God wou'd have been but a very uncertain foundation of Hope, and a very weak inducement to Repentance. But now the <HI>Promise</HI> of Pardon is a firm ground of Hope, and an en∣couraging motive to Repentance. And such a Promise the Word of God sets before us. The Gospel <HI>sets forth the Lord Jesus Christ as a Pro∣pitiation for Sin, and Preaches remission of Sins thro' his Blood</HI>; and it proclames the Name of God, <HI>the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merci∣ful, slow to anger, ready to forgive</HI>; and abounds with Promises of Pardon. Hence, the Gospel is call'd the <HI>Gospel of Peace, the Word of Reconcili∣ation,</HI> &amp;c.— Now by the Promise of Pardon, Sinners have their doubts resolved &amp; their fears relieved touching the Divine Mercy: And this greatly tends
<Q>to overcome our guilty disaffecti∣on to God. For while terrible apprehensions of the Deity possess the heart, 'tis frozen with a stony rigor, which the hope of Mercy only can dissolve</Q>.
Despair chills and cools all essays to repent, and hardens Men in the love and practice of Sin. A hopeless mind and a care∣less temper are common Companions. Faith and Hope are the root and principle of Repentance and Obedience. The prospect of recovering the lost favour of God strongly invites Sinners to cleanse their ways. — Besides the Promise of
<PB N="144" REF="002024_0151_0FBA798B11EEAED8"/>
Pardon is such an endearing expression of God's Love and Good-will unto self-ruin'd Man, as most powerfully <HI>leadeth to Repentance:</HI> This is a mighty dissuasive from Sin, and a forceable perswasive unto Duty. A believing view of the free Grace and rich mercy of God in the Redemp∣tion by Christ, tends to beget in us kindly re∣lentings and remorse for Sin, to warm &amp; soften our hearts, and dissolve them into a current of penitential tears and religious affections.— To consider how we have forfeited the favour of God; To consider, that we may now obtain a Pardon, that the most heinous Sins, and the chief of Sinners may obtain mercy of the Lord; To consider, that God offers freely and irreversibly to bestow pardoning mercy on us, <HI>on us,</HI> who indis∣pensably need it, and are infinitely unworthy of it,—surely, if there be any principle of Honor, any spark of ingenuity, or gratitude re∣maining in us, we must be <HI>drawn by these hands of Love</HI> and perswaded <HI>by the Mercies of God to present our Bodies a living sacrifice, holy and ac∣ceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</HI> What can be more welcome to a condemned Criminal than a Par∣don? God offers this to an obnoxious World. Surely these glad Tidings of great joy shou'd not only check our desponding fears, but melt our congeal'd affections, excite in us Repentance towards God, ravish our love, and inspire our Souls with flaming desires, and firm resolutions, in all things to obey and please a God, so abun∣dant in Goodness and plenteous in Mercy. And surely if the consideration of the Promise of Pardoning Mercy has not this effect upon us, we must be base and ungrateful to the last degree,
<PB N="145" REF="002024_0152_0FBA798C8AAA2210"/>
and have hearts more insensible than the Rocks.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Promise <HI>of the Holy Spirit</HI> is another very engaging motive to cleanse our ways. The Word of God promises us the Spirit of Grace to be our Teacher, Guide, Sanctifier and Com∣forter. And what good News must this needs be to a lost and disconsolate, perishing World, a World that lyes in wickedness, and in dark∣ness! What a suitable and needful Blessing is the Spirit of God? <HI>Thro' the supply of the Spirit,</HI> we who are naturally <HI>without strength,</HI> shall be enabled to <HI>perfect holiness,</HI> and <HI>to work out our Salvation.</HI> But without the Divine Spirit we must have languisht in fruitless attempts, and <HI>perisht</HI> for ever <HI>in our corruption.</HI> There is no∣thing else is able to revive and recover us out of our natural state of carnality. The most happy constitution of Body and the most excellent natural temper of mind, with the most perfect rules of living, the highest motives and the best patterns are not sufficient Restoratives. There is no principle of recovery in our degene∣rate Nature, and as well may a dead Carcase revive and act of it self, or the lifeless Clay form it self into a Vessel of Honor, as Apostate Man by his own single efforts, or with the uni∣versal confederacy of Creature aids, sanctify himself and perform <HI>obedience unto righteousness.</HI> If we have not some superior Power to <HI>help our infirmities,</HI> we must for ever despair of <HI>possessing our Vessel in sanctification and honor.</HI>— Now the Promise of God offers the Holy Spirit, whose <HI>Grace is sufficient for us,</HI> a perfect Salve for our impotence. So that the consideration of our own inability, or of the powerful opposition of
<PB N="146" REF="002024_0153_0FBA798EFB48F8B0"/>
our conspiring Adversaries, need not damp nor discourage our endeavours to <HI>do the will of God,</HI> and to <HI>make our calling and election sure.</HI> The Spirit, who is promis'd us, is a <HI>Spirit of might and power,</HI> of <HI>Wisdom</HI> and of <HI>Grace</HI>; every way more able and willing to help us, than our Ene∣mies to hinder us.—Now to consider, that with∣out supernatural influences we must necessarily and unavoidably perish; To consider, that the Divine Spirit is offer'd to us, and that by His effectual energy we shall be <HI>able to do all things,</HI> shall be fortify'd against all Difficulties, and furnisht unto all Duties; and <HI>by the power of His might</HI> we shall be enabled to <HI>purify our Souls in obeying the Truth</HI> unto the end.— What per∣suasive considerations are these? What powerful incentives to <HI>provoke us to Good Works?</HI> What can tend more to elevate our drooping spirits, to enliven and actuate our diligence, and make us to excite and exert our selves (with a due dependence on the Holy Spirit) in the mortifi∣cation of our Lusts, &amp; the purification of our Lives?</P>
<P N="3">3 THE Promise of <HI>Heaven</HI> is likewise a powerful motive to cleanse our way. <HI>This is the Promise, which God hath promised us, even Eternal Life</HI> (1 Joh. 2.25.) an happiness becoming His in∣finite sufficiency to confer, and us to seek after: a pure and perfect Blessedness. "So glorious and attractive (<HI>says One</HI>) that if duly consider'd, no Man can possibly refuse it". — This Happi∣ness is <HI>Great,</HI> Unsearchably Great. None can comprehend the just <HI>measure,</HI> the exact <HI>number,</HI> and <HI>weight</HI> of the Treasures and Glories of Hea∣ven. They <HI>pass understanding.</HI> And this considera∣tion tends to dash all enticements to Sin, and to
<PB N="147" REF="002024_0154_0FBA799088D19568"/>
animate us (against all intervening difficulties) in the pursuit of this glorious Prize.— And it is <HI>Holy,</HI> as well as Great: Pure and Spiritual. It is what <HI>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit.</HI> Our Bodies must be spiritualiz'd and our Souls pu∣rify'd, in order to a capacity for and enjoyment of it. Now what a sovereign attractive must this consideration be unto holiness? And how will the serious contemplation of Heaven by a kind of natural influence spiritualize our tho'ts and purify our affections? They, that have a belief and hope of Heaven, will desire to <HI>anti∣cipate</HI> their expected Blessedness; and therefore will the often <HI>looking at the things that are unseen and eternal:</HI> and by thus <HI>having their conversa∣tion in Heaven,</HI> the <HI>Holy</HI> Heaven, by thus <HI>beholding the Glory of the Lord,</HI> they will be gradually <HI>changed into the same Image from glory to glory.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we see in some measure, how the <HI>Promises</HI> have a cleansing efficacy in respect of the <HI>Subject-matter.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) THE Promises have a cleansing efficacy <HI>from the Tenor and Manner of their Constitution and Proposal.</HI> Here it may suffice to say,</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY are <HI>Deliver'd in the fullest and clearest Terms.</HI> "They are not wrapt up in Clouds and dark <HI>Aenigmatical</HI> Insinuations, wherein Men must exercise their <HI>Sagacity</HI> as well as their Faith". But they shine out with the clearest Light, and we all <HI>with open face behold</HI> in them, <HI>as in a Glass, the great Things, which God hath laid up for them that love him.</HI> Here the recom∣pences of pure Religion lye fair &amp; open to prospect. The Messages of Peace are most plain, express and explicit, &amp; give us a true conception &amp; full convic∣tion
<PB N="148" REF="002024_0155_0FBA7994E27BFCD8"/>
of those glorious unseen Realities, of which such as enjoy not Gospel-revelation can have but very loose &amp; obscure apprehensions. And this gives the Promises of the Word an attractive influence.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY are <HI>Confirmed with the most inviolable Securities.</HI> If the Promises were doubtful or uncertain, the encouragement to seek an interest in them wou'd be but weak and faint: But they are stable as the Ordinances of Heaven. They are ratify'd with the strongest assurances. They are <HI>sure Words of Prophecy,</HI> most evident and certain, <HI>proceeding out of the mouth of God, the God of Truth,</HI> and sealed by an <HI>Oath, to shew the immutability of his counsel,</HI> (Heb. 6.17.) Now this is an excellent character that must needs greatly recommend them to us, and <HI>beget us to a lively hope. This World's Goods</HI> are <HI>uncertain Riches:</HI> But the Blessings offered in the Promises are <HI>sure Mercies.</HI> And what more prossing incentive to Religion, than this? It is the Apostle's chosen Argument, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.58.) Therefore my beloved Brethren, Be ye stedfast, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, <HI>forasmuch as ye know that your labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THEY are <HI>altogether free, gracious and gra∣tuitous.</HI> They are the pure result of free Grace and sovereign Mercy. As to the <HI>Blessings</HI> them∣selves contained in the Promises, it is owing to the rich Love and mere Mercy of God, that they are obtainable. The Redemption by Christ was the production of free Good-will, and most vo∣luntary self-moving Grace. God has shewn <HI>ex∣ceeding riches of Grace in his kindness towards us by Christ Jesus,</HI> (Eph. 2.7.) God was under no ne∣cessity,
<PB N="149" REF="002024_0156_0FBA79994A649948"/>
nor obligation to save Sinners. Nay, He might without any impeachment of His Justice have caused His fury to rest upon the whole race of sinful Man, and have punish'd as with swift destruction, and that without remedy, as He did the whole Crew of Apostate Angels, who immediately on their revolt were clapt in Chains, and are reserv'd as Prisoners of Justice unto the day of Perdition. Nay, the Righteousness &amp; Holiness of God <HI>demanded</HI> this, and <HI>call'd for Vengeance</HI> to consume us utterly: But <HI>Mercy rejoyced over Judgment,</HI> and triumph'd over our Unworthiness, and provided <HI>a Saviour</HI> for us; <HI>in and thro' whom God is reconciling the World unto Himself,</HI> and magnifying His Mercy towards Penitent Sinners, without any detriment to His Justice, or defile∣ment of His Purity. Here is Love, unmerited, unasked, unforced; Love without Example and beyond Expression! Love which we are as un∣capable to conceive of, as we were unworthy to be the objects of! And surely this Love of God (if duly consider'd) must <HI>constrain us,</HI> must strongly and sweetly draw our hearts, &amp; warm our cold affections, and kindle in our Souls a flaming Love; Love sincere and pure, which will be in us a perpetual spring of obedience, and a living principle of undefiled Religion. But, as the Love of God, His great and free Love, is seen in the <HI>Blessings</HI> procured for us and offered to us: So it is seen also in the <HI>Promises</HI> them∣selves. It is a further instance of His Free Grace, that He shou'd <HI>make Promise</HI> of the Blessings unto us, That He shou'd not only invite us, but indent with us▪ and <HI>make an everlasting Covenant in all things well ordered and sure</HI>; Here is free
<PB N="150" REF="002024_0157_0FBA79A231BE9E80"/>
and condescending Goodness. God might have ruled us in a way of arbitrary Sovereignty, and have offer'd His Blessings in a way of mere <HI>Bounty:</HI> But He has humbled Himself to enter into <HI>Bonds,</HI> and engage them to us by way of <HI>Contract,</HI> passing His Roya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Word, and confirming it with a so∣lemn Oath, that we might have strong Conso∣lation, and strong encouragement unto Duty.— What Riches of Goodness are here! What an obliging and endearing method of Grace is this! And how does the consideration of God's free and generous Goodness in His Promises tend to conquer the Sinners obstinacy, and melt him into grateful Resentments, and work up his heart to a kindly Repentance.</P>
<P N="4">4. THEY are <HI>Conditional.</HI> Some indeed assert, that the Covenant of Grace is absolute and un∣conditionate: but this is contrary to the univer∣sal strain, and tends to subvert the whole design, of the inspired Scriptures. The Word of God in∣violably connects the Precepts and Promises, Duties and Blessings. The latter are manifestly and unalterably entail'd upon the former.— As to the Promise of <HI>Pardon</HI>; how evident is it, that we can never receive it, unless we have <HI>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> a Faith <HI>which worketh by Love, and which purifyeth the heart?</HI>— Again, As to the Promise of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> if we wou'd obtain it, 'tis requir'd that we invite Him by Prayer, that we cherish His holy motions, conspire with Him in our endeavours, and improve the Means. "<HI>There is a common Grace</HI> (saith a famous Divine) <HI>which God deny∣eth to no Man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>John Colliges,</HI> of Provid. pag. 476.</NOTE> <HI>by vertue of
<PB N="151" REF="002024_0158_0FBA79A39139F920"/>
which Men may Read, Hear, Pray, live a civil Life, leave gross and flagitious courses of Sin,</HI> and thou hast no reason to <HI>complain of God for not giving thee his special distinguishing Grace, while thou dost not do what in thee lyes to amend thy ways, and turn to God. Let us leave our disputing questions —and apply our selves to our own duty, and do what God commandeth us, for which we have encou∣ragement enough. I dare assure thee, that God, nei∣ther ever yet was, nor ever will be wanting in His further Grace unto those Souls, that have made a due improvement of His common Grace, &amp; done what in them lay towards their own Salvation".</HI>— And to the same purpose speaks a very Aged and Judicious Divine among us; — "<HI>Sinners</HI> (saith he) <HI>can do more towards their own Conversion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. Increase Mather. <HI>Awakening Truths, tending to Conver∣sion.</HI> pag. 71, &amp;c. And, <HI>Now or Never.</HI> pag. 93, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>than they do or will do. They have power to avoid those things which are an hindrance of Conversion, and they have power to wait on God in the use of means, which has a tendency to pro∣mote Conversion. And most certainly if Men im∣prove their natural abilities as they ought to do, there will not one Sinner in all the reprobate World stand forth at the Day of Judgment, &amp; say, Lord, Thou knowest, I did all that possibly I cou'd do; for the obtaining Grace, and for all that thou didst with∣hold it from me.</HI> And as to such as <HI>do not give diligence</HI> to do what they can in order <HI>to obtain Grace, This their slothfulness is the death of their Souls.</HI> Prov. 21.25. <HI>The desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands refuse to labour.</HI> Prov. 13.4. <HI>But the Soul of the diligent shall be made fat".</HI>— We must exert our natural powers, we must use the means
<PB N="152" REF="002024_0159_0FBA79A48BABE270"/>
and be found in the way of Duty, and <HI>frame our doings to turn unto the Lord,</HI> (Heb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.4.) else it is presumption to expect special Grace, and depend on obtaining supernatural assistances. We must use well the advantages we at present enjoy, as ever we expect to have more and better given us. For so runs the Promise, (Luk. 19.26.) <HI>Unto every one which hath</HI> (improved what He has al∣ready received,) <HI>shall be given</HI> (increase of Grace:) <HI>and from him that hath</HI> (i. e. improveth) <HI>not, even that be hath shall be taken from him.</HI>—Lastly, As to the Promise of <HI>Heaven</HI> and Eternal Life; How plainly and peremptorily are we told, that <HI>Except a Man be born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</HI> that <HI>without holiness no man shall see the Lord,</HI> and that only the <HI>pure in heart shall see God?</HI> It is not more certain that Christ is the only Saviour, than that He is the <HI>Author of Salvation to</HI> none but <HI>them that obey Him.</HI> These Considerations are of excellent efficacy to dash the vain presumption of careless Trans∣gressors, to arm and antidote us against Temp∣tations, to restrain from Sin and quicken unto Duty.
<Q>The Conditionality of the Promises is a circumstance, which gives life to all the rest, and makes them operative towards the produ∣cing a good Life. It is a great advantage to the Promises, that God has linkt our <HI>hopes</HI> and our <HI>duty</HI> together. And indeed when we consider the infinite disproportion between the <HI>Reward</HI> and our <HI>Service</HI>; we must resolve, that he had no other design in making His Pro∣mises Conditional, than to engage us by our <HI>Interest</HI> to that holiness unto which he saw our <HI>Inclinations</HI> did not bind us; that it was
<PB N="153" REF="002024_0160_0FBA79A914AC9270"/>
the Artifice of His Love to ensnare us into two <HI>Pelicities</HI> by proposing of one, to enforce us to take one Good in the way to another, <HI>Vertue</HI> in passage to <HI>Glory.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="5">5. And Lastly. THE Promises are <HI>backt with the most moving Exhortations and Expostulations.</HI> The Great God, <HI>because He delights to shew mercy,</HI> descends to <HI>reason the case</HI> with secure Sinners, who <HI>forsake their own Mercies,</HI> and <HI>beseeches them</HI> to embrace His glorious Offers. Thus, (Isa. 55.1, 2, &amp;c.) <HI>Ho, every one that thirsteth, Come ye to the waters, and be that hath no money: Come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfyeth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your Soul delight it self in fatness. Incline your ear and come unto me; hear and your Soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</HI> So, (Isai. 1.18, 9.) <HI>Come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord, tho' your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow,— If ye be willing and obedient.</HI>— So also, (Prov. 1.22, 3.) <HI>How long will fools hate knowlege? Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you.</HI> So likewise, (Hos. 10.12.) <HI>Sow to your selves in righteousness, reap in mercy: Break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</HI> And so, (2 Cor. 5.20 —6.1, 2.) <HI>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as tho' God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye recon∣ciled
<PB N="154" REF="002024_0161_0FBA79AAF440B580"/>
to God. As workers together with him we be∣seech you, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. For he saith, Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of Salvation.— Let us fear, lest stighting the promise of entring into Rest, any of you shou'd seem to come short of it. How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation?</HI> (Heb. 2.3.—4.1.) —Now what winning Oratory, what ravishing Suasion do these generous Invitatious, these condescending Intreaties, and convincing Ex∣postulations carry in them? What an edge do they put on the Promises, and how strongly do they tend to perswade the Will, and inflame the affections, and engage us in the love and practice of that Holiness, without which we cannot in∣herit the Blessed Hope? <HI>But Thus much for the Promises.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. THE <HI>Histories</HI> in the Word have a clean∣sing efficacy. A great part of the Bible is Histo∣rical; giving us an account of many memorable matters of Fact, relating to past Actions of Men and Events of Providence. The Reading where∣of must needs be very <HI>entertaining</HI> to all, and very <HI>edifying</HI> to them that will be at the pains, when they read, to reflect seriously and apply wisely. Of such a nature and tendency is the Account we have in Scripture, Of the <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> of Man; Of <HI>Judgments</HI> executed on the <HI>Wicked</HI>; Of <HI>Miscarriages</HI> of Good Men, and <HI>Chastisements</HI> inflicted on them therefor; Of great outward <HI>Afflictions,</HI> and inward <HI>Temptations,</HI> and Difficulties the <HI>Children of God</HI> have been exer∣cised withal; Of the <HI>Conversion</HI> of great Sin∣ners;
<PB N="155" REF="002024_0162_0FBA79AD83C7AE90"/>
Of the wonderful <HI>Appearances</HI> of God for His <HI>Church,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Subject is fully handled by a Worthy Writer, in a Treatise Entituled, <HI>Observa∣tions on the Holy Scriptures.</HI> Chap. 2. To which I must re∣fer the Reader.</NOTE> and for <HI>particular</HI> Saints in times of danger or distress.— The Narratives of those, and other things, which the Scriptures present us with, are very instructive and a most profitable improvement may be made of them. They have a very propitious aspect upon holy Living. They were written for our spiritual profit, &amp; are <HI>good to the use of edifying, to minister Grace</HI> unto us. Thus the Apostle wit∣nesses, (Rom. 15.4.) <HI>Whatsoever things were writ∣ten aforetime, were written for our Learning.</HI> So, (1 Cor. 10.11.) <HI>All these things happen'd unto them for Ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</HI> And agreably we are told, (2 Pet. 2.6. &amp; Jude ver. 7.) That the Judgments executed on the wicked Sodomites <HI>are set forth for an example unto those that should after live ungodly.</HI> And on the other hand, the Apostle Paul tells us, (1 Tim. 1.16.) <HI>For this end I obtained mercy, that in me, the first</HI> or <HI>chief</HI> Sinner, <HI>Jesus Christ might shew sorth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on Him.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. THE <HI>Examples</HI> of pure Religion, upon Scrip∣ture-record have a cleansing efficacy. Example is the most powerful attractive to Practice. It affords superior Light to direct, and carries in it a pe∣culiar charm to perswade. Good Examples teach us our Duty with a much fuller emphasis, than bare Precepts. Example is most compendious, most pleasant &amp; efficacious method of instruction. It is most informing and affecting. It speaks most
<PB N="156" REF="002024_0163_0FBA79B26AD020F8"/>
convincingly and strikes us most sensibly. The holy Lives of the Saints are a silent and most effectual reproof of Sinners, and greatly tend to cover them with shame. And they are a liv∣ing incentive to the Penitent; they tend to cherish their hopes, by representing their Duty as practicable, &amp; they tend also to tempt their am∣bition, &amp; provoke them to a laudable Emulation.</P>
<P>NOW the Word of God furnishes us with the best and brightest Patterns of Holiness. There is the grand Example of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> which is eminently recommended to our regards. This is a most <HI>perfect, full,</HI> and <HI>infallible</HI> Example, affording complete, universal and unerring di∣rection.—And it is also most <HI>obvious</HI> and <HI>fami∣liar,</HI> excellently accommodated to our present imperfect state, and to the different circumstan∣ces and capacities of Men, <HI>making our way straight before our face, and leading us in a plain path.</HI>— And it is cloathed with such respects, as can't but powerfully perswade us to imitation. 'Tis the Precedent of Him, who is our <HI>Sovereign</HI>; and carries a binding force with it, &amp; challen∣ges our conformity thereunto as matter of <HI>Duty.</HI> Again, It is the President of One, who is the <HI>Chief among Ten Thousand</HI>; and invites us to study a resemblance from the motive of <HI>Honour.</HI> And moreover, 'Tis the Example of Him, who is our compassionate <HI>Saviour, who subsisting in the former nature of God, thought it not usurpation to be al∣together equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant; and being found in fashion as a Man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto Death</HI>; &amp; this to <HI>purchase</HI> Heaven and Happiness for us, (Sinners
<PB N="157" REF="002024_0164_0FBA79B3A43E2320"/>
and Enemies against Him,) and to <HI>leave us an Example,</HI> to lead us in the way thereunto. Now what an endearing and unparallel'd instance of Condescension, Kindness and Mercy is here? And how shou'd we be induced from the in∣genuous principles of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> to fol∣low the steps, and imitate the virtues of our dearest Friend, and most generous Benefactor.</P>
<P>BUT further, besides the perfect Example of <HI>Christ,</HI> we have the Examples of the <HI>Saints</HI>; which tho' imperfect, yet are not superseded by the former: But also have their singular use in the Christian Life, even as the Stars are some∣times <HI>profitable to direct</HI> as well as the Sun. Hence we are call'd upon, not only to <HI>look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our Faith,</HI> and to <HI>consider Him:</HI> but also to be <HI>Followers of them who thro' faith and patience inherit the Promises.</HI> And indeed, tho' the Example of <HI>Christ,</HI> in respect of it's perfect <HI>purity</HI> is more sure to direct us: yet on some accounts the Examples of the <HI>Saints</HI> (they being <HI>Men of like passions with us,</HI> of like moral infirmities, and not only <HI>in all points tempted like as we are,</HI> even as Christ was, but also, as <HI>He</HI> was not, sometimes overcome by the power of Temptations and <HI>overtaken with faults,</HI>) may seem more suited to encourage us. They seem to come nearer, and to be more equal and level to us. And for this reason, The Lives of many Holy Men are written and registred in the sacred Pages; And we are bidden to <HI>follow them as they followed Christ</HI>; to observe their Vertues and take Example by them, as well as to observe their Falls and take warning from them.</P>
<P>SO that, (we see) if there be any force in
<PB N="158" REF="002024_0165_0FBA79B5099093F0"/>
Example to tempt and allure us unto holy Liv∣ing, the Word of God must needs have a very powerful influence upon us.</P>
<P>THUS I've (in some measure) made it appear, that the Word of God <HI>in it's own nature as a Means,</HI> is excellently fitted and greatly tends to purify our way: and have consider'd the whole Frame of the Word, and shewn how all the parts of it do admirably conspire and har∣monize in promoting our Sanctification.— <HI>Which was the Second Thing.</HI> Pass we now to the Last Particular, which is—</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THE Word is the chosen Instrument of the Holy Spirit, and is ordinarily accompany'd with His Influence.</HI> The Word has a perfect natural con∣gruity and aptitude, &amp; an instrumental causality, to cleanse and sanctify us. It has so much and no more <HI>in it self.</HI> But <HI>over</HI> and <HI>above</HI> what virtue the Word carries in it's own nature ab∣stractly consider'd, there is an additional co∣operating influence of the Divine Spirit. Indeed what Help we have by the Word itself is <HI>the fruit of the Spirit</HI>; but <HI>this</HI> is not <HI>the whole</HI> of the Spirit's influence in the work of Sanctification. Besides this, There is an internal agency of the Holy Spirit upon the Heart, a secret Divine Power, which accompanying the Word, gives life and efficacy thereunto.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>Common Grace,</HI> or general assist∣ence of the Spirit, always attending the Word, and dispensed to all, tho' not in an equal degree, and proportion, which has a tendency to Con∣version, and is sufficient to take off the idle pre∣tence of <HI>spiritual impotence,</HI> and renders all those
<PB N="159" REF="002024_0166_0FBA79B6DE790E50"/>
inexcusable, that under the Gospel remain carnal and disobedient. Hence such are said to <HI>receive the Grace of God in vain,</HI> and <HI>to resist the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>AND there is a more <HI>Special Grace,</HI> or parti∣cular Assistence, accompanying the Word unto the Souls of some, <HI>which worketh effectually in them,</HI> and <HI>these</HI> are <HI>ordinarily</HI> such as have im∣proved former and lesser Assistences. Those who are humbly and diligently using the Means, praying for the Spirit, concurring with His holy Motions, and abandoning their evil ways, it is the usual method of the Spirit, to derive unto them higher and more peculiar Assistences, to <HI>create in them a clean heart,</HI> and <HI>make them Partakers of the Divine Nature,</HI> to <HI>make them perfect in every good work, to do the will of God, working in them that which is well pleasing in his sight.</HI> This is the standing method of the Spirit's proceeding with those, who enjoy the Means of Grace, from which He doth not ordi∣narily vary. Indeed "the Apostle Paul, before his Conversion, was so far from being under any preparatory disposition, that he was employing his strength to destroy the Faith of Christ, at that time, when he was effectually call'd by him". But this is an <HI>extraordinarry</HI> instance, to shew the sovereignty and power of Divine Grace. And they that take encouragement from it to neglect and slight the use of Means, under a shew of waiting for the Spirit, and do <HI>magnify</HI> this, and <HI>nullify</HI> that, are Men of strange pre∣sumption, and do cast a foul indignity on the wise appointments of Heaven, and offer violence to the establisht method of Grace.—The Word and Spirit (in ordinary cases) have a concomi∣tant,
<PB N="160" REF="002024_0167_0FBA79BD3383B6B0"/>
tho' not equal, Agency in our Conversion and Sanctification; The Spirit as the Efficient, the Word as the Instrument. The Spirit ordi∣narily works <HI>by</HI> and <HI>with</HI> the Word. Hence, we find <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth</HI> put together, (2 Thes. 2.13.) Hence, the Gos∣pel is call'd, <HI>The Ministration of the Spirit, The Sword of the Spirit, The Law of the Spirit of Life, The Power of God unto Salvation.</HI> Hence, when the Gospel comes <HI>in power,</HI> it is said to come <HI>in the Holy Ghost,</HI> (1 Thes. 1.5.) Hence, The Saints are said to <HI>purify their Souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit,</HI> (1 Pet. 1.22.) and to be <HI>the Epistle of Christ, ministred by the ministers of Christ, writ∣ten not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God</HI>; and <HI>beholding</HI> in the Word <HI>as in a glass the Glory of the Lord, to be changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</HI> (1 Cor. 3.3, 18.) Hence, The Apostle makes that appeal to the Galatians, <HI>Received ye the Spi∣rit</HI> by the works of the Law, or <HI>by the hearing of Faith?</HI> (Gal. 3.2.)—These Scriptures make it sufficiently evident, that the Word is the ordi∣nary instrument of the sanctifying Spirit, and accompany'd with His sacred Presence. It is the Chariot in which He rides forth conquering and to conquer; The Wings, by which He descends into the Soul; the Channel in which He conveys the waters of Purification. And we have a gra∣cious Promise, (<HI>Isai.</HI> 59.21.) that the Word and Spirit shall always be concomitant.</P>
<P>THUS I've somewhat largely Discours'd on the <HI>First Article</HI> propos'd to consideration, which was, that <HI>The Word of God has a cleansing influ∣ence.</HI> I proceed now to say something very briefly to—</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="002024_0168_0FBA79C658CAAA18"/>Artic. II. Which is this; namely, <HI>IF we take heed to the Word of God, we shall experience it's cleansing efficacy.</HI></P>
<P>HERE I might premise; That, If ever we ex∣pect the Word of God shou'd cleanse us, we must necessarily <HI>take heed</HI> unto it. The Word indeed is a means of Sanctification, &amp; a most fit &amp; powerful means; but we can never reap any saving benefit from it, without a due regard to it, &amp; improvement of it. Therefore the Young Man in order to <HI>cleanse his way,</HI> is directed in our Text, to <HI>take heed</HI> to the Word of God. We must <HI>observe</HI> it <HI>strictly,</HI> as the Original imports. We must carefully <HI>mark it, and set our heart to it.</HI> We must <HI>search the Scriptures</HI> for knowlege, as for <HI>precious sub∣stance,</HI> and must <HI>hide it in our hearts,</HI> and there pre∣serve it as a Treasure. We must <HI>incline our ear to wisdom and apply our heart to understanding.</HI> We must <HI>meditate in the Law of God day and night,</HI> and <HI>have respect to all his ways.</HI> We must receive and reverence the Word, <HI>as the Word of God:</HI> We must acknowledge it's authority, yield our selves up to the power, and acquaint our selves with the contents of it. We must be much in con∣versing with the <HI>Word Written,</HI> and frequent in attending on the <HI>Word Preacht:</HI> We must <HI>take heed</HI> also <HI>how we hear</HI> and how we read.</P>
<P>WE must take heed to the <HI>Truths</HI> of the Word, as the Standard of our Faith, and <HI>hold fast the form of sound words, in saith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</HI> So likewise we must take heed to the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the Word, as the Directory of our practice, and observe them as Sailors do the Compass whereby they steer; We must inform our selves of the Rule, and conform our selves
<PB N="162" REF="002024_0169_0FBA79C8C52FD5C8"/>
unto it. Again, We must take heed to the <HI>Threatnings,</HI> to learn our danger and quicken us to avoid it, as the Traveller is circumspect and careful to spy and shun Praecipes, Sloughs and By-paths. Again, We must take heed to the <HI>Pro∣mises,</HI> to learn our happiness, and animate us to pursue it, as the Racer locks to the Prize that is set before him: And further, we must take heed to the <HI>Examples</HI> in the Word to imitate them, as a <HI>Painter</HI> looks on the Object, as the Writer observes his Copy, or the Workman his Pattern. <HI>In short,</HI> We must take heed to the <HI>whole</HI> Word of God. We must <HI>set our hearts to all things whatsoever it testifies unto us,</HI> (Deut. 32.46.)</P>
<P>WE must take heed to the <HI>Design</HI> and <HI>Use</HI> of the holy Word, keep that in our eye, affect our hearts with it, and always use the <HI>means</HI> with serious views to the blessed <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, We must take heed to the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> by whose Inspiration the Word was written, and by whose Blessing it is succeeded; we must realize the necessity of His presence with the Word, we must implore His special Influence to accompany it, rely on His powerful Grace to render it efficacious, lay our Souls open there∣unto, observe His workings in us, cherish con∣victions, and improve every good impression He makes on us by the Word at any time.</P>
<P>AND if we thus take heed to the Word, we shall find it an <HI>effectual</HI> method to cleanse our way. This Truth is evident as from other Con∣siderations, so especially from <HI>the Promise of God,</HI> and <HI>the Experience of the Saints.</HI>—The <HI>Promise</HI> is unto such. Thus we read, (1 Jam. 1.25.) <HI>Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
<PB N="163" REF="002024_0170_0FBA79CB75E9A2C0"/>
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</HI> So, (Mar. 4.24.) <HI>Take heed to what ye hear: And unto you that hear shall more be given.</HI> So (Isai. 55.1.) <HI>Hear, and your Soul shall live.</HI> — These blessed Promises unto those that hear, or ob∣serve and take heed to the Word, are a sufficient ground of assurance, that such shall not <HI>fail of the Grace of God.</HI>— And the universal <HI>Expe∣rience</HI> of the <HI>Saints</HI> is an abundant confirmation of this Truth. 'Twas in this way they all <HI>escaped the pollutions of the world</HI>; they <HI>purify'd their Souls in obeying the Truth.</HI> To which of the Saints wilt thou turn? If we appeal to <HI>the Saints in Light,</HI> they will with one voice tell us, that <HI>by observing the Word of God</HI> they were <HI>made meet</HI> for their Inheritance. If we enquire of <HI>the Saints that are in the Earth,</HI> they will pro∣fess with the Psalmist, <HI>By the Word I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. The Word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against God. Salvation is far from the wicked, for they seek not his statutes. But my heart standeth in awe of his word. I have hoped for his salvation and done his commandments. I will never forget his precepts, for his word hath quicken'd me. I will walk at liberty, for I seek his precepts.</HI></P>
<P>OBSERVING the Word is then a most sure and infallible method of cleansing. <HI>The Word of the Lord is try'd.</HI> It is a means, that never <HI>has</HI> fail'd such as have diligently improv'd it; and this is sufficient Argument, <HI>it never will.</HI> And <HI>as many as take heed unto the Word of God,</HI> must needs be <HI>undefiled in the way,</HI> and <HI>also do no ini∣quity. Whosoever is born again, not of corruptible
<PB N="164" REF="002024_0171_0FBA79CE137D78B0"/>
seed but incorruptible, by the word of God, he doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin,</HI> (1 Pet. 1.23. &amp; 1 Joh. 3.9. compa.)</P>
<P>THESE few Hints may suffice for this Last Article.</P>
<P>AND thus I've finisht the <HI>Doctrinal</HI> Handling of the Text, and in some sort cleared the Three Points propos'd to be spoken to; Namely, <HI>That the way of Youth is naturally defiled: That it great∣ly concerns Persons in their Youth to get their way Cleansed:</HI> And Lastly, <HI>That if Young Men</HI> (or any others) <HI>duly observe the Word of God, they take a most direct and effectual method to cleanse, and keep, their way from sinful defilements.</HI></P>
<P>AND now I proceed to make some brief APPLICATION of these Things distinctly.</P>
<P>USE. I. IS the way of Youth defiled, <HI>What ground of Self-abasement is here?</HI> How should this shame and humble us? How shou'd it correct the vanity and mortify the levity of Young Men, to consider their <HI>natural depravation &amp; contracted defilements?</HI> Consider this, ye that forget God; and <HI>Be not high-minded, but be ye clothed with hu∣mility.</HI> Pride not your selves in any Privileges of Birth or Education, in any accomplishments of Body or Mind, in any temporal enjoyments or external advantages of Life, and the like; for so long as your <HI>way is defiled,</HI> this tarnishes the glory of all, and sheds a fatal taint into all the Blessing you enjoy, renders your Persons odious in the Eyes of the Holy God, and exposes you to all the Curses which His infinite Wisdom can invent, or His infinite Power inflict, <HI>which is shame and terror enough.</HI> It is owing to igno∣rance
<PB N="165" REF="002024_0172_0FBA79CF466FE748"/>
and inconsideration of these things, that so many Young Men, as well as others, are <HI>vainly p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fft up by their fleshly mind,</HI> and walk in the lust of <HI>Pride.</HI> They wou'd rate Themselves and their Accomplishments a little lower, did they but consider what black &amp; filthy feet these proud Plumes walk upon; or what roots of bitterness they are, which bear these gawdy flowers, what corrupt Trees they are, which bear these painted fruits. Our original Corruption and actual Pol∣lutions are sufficient matter of humiliation to us, and a just allay of swelling arrogance. We may well bemoan our selves as <HI>wretched Men,</HI> 'till we are <HI>deliver'd from the Body of this Death,</HI> however happy we may be as to Bodily or Men∣tal Endowments, or Worldly Enjoyments. And we should temper the tho'ts of the one, by sui∣table reflections on the other, to make us lowly in our own Eyes, and to keep us from <HI>thinking more highly of our selves, than we ought to think.</HI></P>
<P>USE. II. DOES it greatly concern Men in their Youth to get their way cleansed? This might be improved —</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO detect the Folly, and show the Misery and Danger of all Young People,</HI> (and much more of Elder People) <HI>who contentedly abide in the state of polluted nature, and resolvedly go on in their ways of iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>TO rebuke the madness and wickedness of those Sons of Belial, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Children of the Devil,</HI> and <HI>Factors for Hell, who try to corrupt and defile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oung Persons: who not only do iniquity themselves, but also take pleasure in them that do the same,</HI> and take pains <HI>to hearten</HI> &amp; <HI>harden deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cht Youths in sin∣ful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> and by cursed Example sollicitation, or
<PB N="166" REF="002024_0173_0FBA79D18895A990"/>
otherwise try to <HI>pervert the way of the innocent,</HI> and tempt them to <HI>practise wicked works</HI> with themselves, and so to betray them into <HI>the snare of the Devil,</HI> and the miseries of Hell.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>TO move and quicken all to serious Self-Ex∣amination, How they are spending, or have spent, their Youth,</HI> whether in the dangerous Omission, or diligent Prosecution, of so weighty a concern, as <HI>cleansing their way.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>TO Lament and Mourn over the unhappy growth and prevalence of carnality in the rising Generation among us.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>TO Exh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt and Warn all lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and careless Young Men, with diligence and without delay to set about the great Work before them,</HI> even to cleanse their hands and purify their hearts.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>TO Exhort and Excite Parents, Masters, Tutors, Guardians, and all such as have any inspection or influence over Young Ones,</HI> to a <HI>Zealous Concern, and Seasonable Endeavours to promote purity and holiness in them,</HI> by wholesome Instructions, and solemn Charges, by wise Reproofs, and autho∣ritative Restraints, &amp; due Corrections, by good Ex∣amples, by fervent Prayers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Unto the neglect of which vigilant Care over Youth, are very much owing the wickednesses of this Degenerate Day.</P>
<P N="7">7. IT might further be improv'd, <HI>To commend and encourage those Young People, who are seriously and seduously engag'd in the important work of cleansing their way,</HI> as thro' the Grace of God there are some, however dissolute the present Time is.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>TO shew how deeply indebted, and what b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds of gratitude such are in, unto the God of all Grace, whom He has blessed with an early Conversion, and a pious Youth,</HI> while multitudes of others are pe∣rishing
<PB N="167" REF="002024_0174_0FBA79D31A2177E8"/>
in their chains of filth, and by Youthful lusts are ruin'd for ever.</P>
<P>THESE Things afford matter for a large Dis∣course: But it is the Application of the <HI>Last Preposition,</HI> that I intend to speak <HI>most</HI> and yet but briefly unto. Let us therefore come to—</P>
<P>USE. III. IS the Word, if duly observed, such an effectual means to cleanse our way? <HI>Hence,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WE have one very good Argument for the Divinity of the Word.</HI> It is no mean Argument, that the Word Written is of Divine Inspiration, and the Word Preacht of Divine Institution, That they are instrumental of the most Divine Effects, the most Honorary to God, and Benefi∣cial to Man; such Effects as all the Philosophy of the sagest humane Writers cou'd never pro∣duce. By the Word, Dead Souls are quicken'd, Hard Hearts soften'd, Defiled Consciences purged, and the whole Spirit, Soul, and Body sanctify'd, <HI>turned from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI>— Surely, Here is the Wisdom and the Power of God. These illustrious Effects and Triumphs of the Word, evidence it to be the <HI>Word of God, &amp; not the Word of Man.</HI> And he must be strangely blind &amp; stupid, that does not in these Things read it's Divine Authority and Original.</P>
<P N="2">2. HENCE, <HI>It is an invaluable Privilege to enjoy the Word, &amp; what bespeaks our thankful Praises.</HI> To have the <HI>Scriptures to search,</HI> and <HI>the Word Preached</HI> to hear, is a <HI>Great</HI> Favour of God; a Blessing that cannot be sufficiently valu'd. 'Tis the greatest outward Privilege. The Apostle declares the <HI>Jews</HI> of old had <HI>manifold peculiar Advantages</HI> in the enjoyment of the Divine Ora∣cles. (Rom. 3.1, 2.) And our Saviour tells His
<PB N="168" REF="002024_0175_0FBA79D5C43AB7C8"/>
Disciples, what a great Blessing they enjoy'd in the Gospel, how much greater than they of old; (Luk. 10.23, 4.) <HI>Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see.</HI> For <HI>I tell you, that many Pro∣phets and Kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them.</HI> We that enjoy the <HI>Gospel,</HI> are <HI>highly favoured</HI> indeed. Unto such may well be apply'd that (in Deut. 32.29.) <HI>Happy art thou; who is like unto Thee, O People saved by the Lord?</HI> Dignify'd &amp; blessed even <HI>above</HI> the <HI>darling</HI> Saints in the Old Testament-Times; how <HI>much more</HI> then above the Great Ones in the Earth, who have not the Word? Verily, To live under the Light of the Glorious Gospel, tho' in the meanest Cottage or Hovel, is a greater Happiness, a <HI>goodlier Heritage,</HI> than without it to live in King's Palaces and the high Places of the Earth. How then should we prize the Gos∣pel, and be thankful for the Word of Life!</P>
<P>AND it is a <HI>Distinguishing</HI> Favour, as well as <HI>Great.</HI> For there be many Persons, yea Nations in the World, who have the same necessity and occasion for the Word as we, and we as they, and they are Originally no more unworthy than our selves, and as capable of the Benefits of the Gospel, and yet are destitute of the Word, and are left to the guidance of Nature's faint confused Light, and have no better Instructors than the Sun, Moon and Stars; while we have a <HI>more sure word of Prophecy, which is as a shining Light,</HI> and have <HI>Pastors and Teachers,</HI> to <HI>feed us with un∣derstanding,</HI> and to <HI>teach us the good knowlege of the Lord.</HI> In this case we must say, (as in, Rom. 3.9.) <HI>What then? are we better than they? no, in n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="169" REF="002024_0176_0FBA79D6CA44D478"/>
wise.</HI> And as in Luk. 10.21. <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise, &amp; hast revealed them unto babes: Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.</HI> The uncontrollable Liberty and unaccountable Sovereignty of God is to be seen and own'd in this conduct of Divine Providence. And surely a Favour, so incomparably great and ineffably gracious, as the Dispensation of the Gospel, is what challenges the highest gratitude. O Let us ever be fill'd with admiring th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's and the most thankful resentments of the great and discrimi∣nating Goodness of God unto us a giving us His Word. The Psalmist admonishes us of this our duty; Psal. 147.19, 20. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, He hath not dealt so with</HI> every <HI>Nation.— Praise ye the Lord.</HI>—And Let us adore the Pa∣tience and Forbearance of God towards us, and His sovereign Grace, in <HI>continuing</HI> to us His Word, notwithstanding the visible contemt shown unto it by multitudes among us, and the innumerable Forfeitures we have made of this Privilege. There are many <HI>Places</HI> in the World, where the Word was once sent and <HI>prevailed mightily,</HI> but having abus'd their liberty, and <HI>rebell'd against the Light, The Candlestick</HI> was just∣ly <HI>rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> from them, and <HI>the fruitful Field</HI> is become an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owling Desert</HI> and a <HI>desolate Wilder∣ness.</HI> And this also had long since been our mournful Doom, if God had dealt with us accor∣ding to our just desert. Astonishing is the Patience of God towards a sinful Land!—And further, Many <HI>Persons,</HI> who once enjoy'd the warm Sun∣shine of the Gospel, are laid in their cold Graves, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld up in the bottomless Pit, are gone

<P N="3">3. HENCE, <HI>We learn the Reason and Motive of that Opposition which the Word of God meets with from Satan.</HI> The Word of God is a Well of Salvation, a Fountain of Truth and Purity.

And thus it crosses his designs, and thwarts his interests, clouds the glory and weakens the nerves of his Government, lessens the number of his Subjects, and threatens the the destruction of his Kingdom. — And this is the ground of his spite and spleen, malice and malignity against the Word. Hence it is, that <HI>the God of this World,</HI> whose Kingdom lyes in dark∣ness &amp; wickedness, sets himself to oppose the Gos∣pel &amp; blast the endeavours of Ministers, &amp; by many subtil stratagems &amp; with indefatigable industry labours to undermine and invalidate the Word, to bring it into contemt, to foment prejudices against it, and bar it's good Entertainment, to stifle Convictions and damp pious Affections kindled in any awaken'd Soul, and to enliven and enrage the Corruptions, that have been chill'd and cool'd, by the Word. That wicked One endeavours to rob us of the good Seed, to shake

<P N="6">6.

<P N="7">7. <HI>IT is a happy Symptom, and bodes well to a People, when the Word is sent unto them.</HI> The Word is design'd and adapted to purify and pro∣fit Souls: That is the great End and genuine Efficacy of it.

the great Design of the Word, even the <HI>Conversion</HI> and <HI>Sanctification</HI> of Souls. Those are true Gospel-Ministers who <HI>speak forth the words of Truth,</HI> and <HI>declare the Counsel of God,</HI> His <HI>whole</HI> Counsel, who <HI>labour in the Word and Doctrine</HI>; who do not spend their Ministry on little <HI>matters of doubtful Disputation,</HI> or barren Speculation, but adapt it to <HI>the use of godly Edifying,</HI> and preach those substantial Truths, that are <HI>according to Godliness</HI>; who <HI>study to shew themselves approved unto God, Workmen that need not to be ashamed; rightly dividing the Word of Truth</HI>; but <HI>shun vain Bablings,</HI> and endeavour to <HI>commend themselves to every Man's Conscience in the sight of God; Not as pleasing Men, but seeking the profit of many, that they might be saved</HI>; whose Aim and Study is, to <HI>purify a peculiar People unto God, zealous of good Works,</HI> and who draw the <HI>Waters of the Sanctuary,</HI> which they dispense, out of <HI>the Well of Salvation,</HI> the Holy Scriptures.— These are <HI>Good Ministers of Jesus Christ,</HI> and <HI>in doing this,</HI> they take the best Method to <HI>save themselves, and those that hear them.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9.

And how great is the guilt and folly of those, who undervalue this holy and blessed Ordinance, and discard it from a pretence of the sufficiency of the written Word, or from any corrupt motive whatsoever? And how great is the injustice and impiety, the wickedness and baseness of those, that villify, abuse and discourage the Faithful Ministers of the Word, and endeavour to stop their mouths and break their hearts, by cruel Mockings, by insulting Cham-ism, by insolent Korah-ism, or by sacrilegious Niggardliness, and the like? And how little love to Christ or concern for His Interest may those pretend to, who can behold or hear of such unsufferable indignities, and not manifest any Tenderness or Resentment?— But how may it hearten and animate Faithful Mi∣nisters under such unworthy Treatment, to con∣sider, whose Servants they are, what Divine Work they are engag'd in, and what an exceeding great Reward is reserved for them in Heaven?

HENCE, <HI>We see, what Obligation lies on a Professing People to encourage the Means of Educa∣tion.</HI> The Word Written and Preacht is the ordinary Medium of Conversion and Sanctifica∣tion. Now in order to obtaining these Benefits by the Word, it is requisite, that Persons be diligent in <HI>Reading &amp; Hearing</HI> of it; And in order to these, how expedient and necessary is it, that there be Schools of Learning; those of a Lower Character, for the instructing of Youth in Read∣ing, and those of an Higher, for the more Liberal Education of such, as may be devoted to the Work of the Ministry? The Religious Concerns of a People demand the Publick Care and the common Regards of All towards the Means for Educating of Youth, especially to the <HI>Schools of the Prophets.</HI> These things must be up∣held and encouraged, or else Religion will soon bid us farewell, our Glory fade away, and a Flood of Evils break in upon us. The rising Youth are the hopes of a People, and an instructed Seed, a godly Seed, are a Crown and an happy Omen to them. It stands them in hand therefore to promote and pursue all proper methods for the propagation of knowlege, purity, and good order among the rising Generation. And such as do this are to be commended, as truly wise &amp; faithful to their own Interests, &amp; doing that which has an eminent relation to the Honour of God. And so are they, who having at heart the Concerns of Posterity, are training up <HI>their Sons for Pro∣phets,</HI> and taking a pious care for the succession of a Learned and Godly Ministry among them, which is of so great necessity, importance and advantage to Mankind.</P>

HENCE, <HI>It should be the Care of Parents, and all Superiors of whatever character, to bring the Young People under their inspection, into an early acquaintance with, &amp; affection to, God's Holy Word.</HI> Parents, Masters, Mistresses, and the like, have the Souls of their Young People in part com∣mitted to their Charge, and it is their necessary Duty to <HI>bring them up in the Nurture and Admo∣nition of the Lord.</HI> Since the Word is so profi∣table to Souls, they should do their endeavour wisely and diligently, that the purifying Truths and holy Laws of God may be written on their minds with fair &amp; lasting characters. They should begin early with them, Teach them to Read, Catechize 'em, Hear 'em read the Bible &amp; other pious Books, Explain and Inculcate the Doctrines and Duties of Christianity, <HI>Giving them Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept, here a little and there a little</HI>; and bring them to the House of God to attend the Publick Preaching of the Word, Endeavour to possess them with a just Veneration for the Word Preacht, Take an ac∣count of the Sermon from them afterward, &amp; press it upon them in the most solemn and pathetical manner to affect their Souls and <HI>incline their hearts to wisdom.</HI>— Thus to do, Superiors are bound by all the Tyes of Duty, Interest, Comfort and Honour.

HENCE, <HI>We should all examine our selves and enquire, what improvement we have made of the Price, that is in our hands:</HI> What entertain∣ment we have given to the Word of God; what influence it has had upon us; what benefit we've reaped from it. Let us make serious inquisition into this matter. To move hereunto, consider; This is an Enquiry of the last moment; of such consequence, that those must be charg'd with astonishing stupidity, who can live easily and calmly without endeavouring to get the impor∣tant Case comfortably resolv'd. Again, consider; Multitudes, that enjoy the Word, do miss of the purifying and saving effects of it; They are <HI>planted by Rivers of Water,</HI> and fit under the droppings of the Sanctuary, and yet are perfect strangers to spiritual purity. To profit by the Word is not the common &amp; infallible Lot of all that en∣joy it. Further, Many deceive themselves with gross mistakes about this matter. They take up with a <HI>mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Orthodox</HI> Faith, which is but the Faith of Devils, instead of that <HI>Faith which puri∣fyeth the heart</HI>: They take up with a transient delight in the Truth, and have not root in them∣selves; As those, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20.-They rest in some partial reformation and seeming appearances of Grace.

to be Regenerate, in order to know the truth of their Conversion, must enquire, whether the Change, they conclude themselves to have experienced, were wrought <HI>by the Word</HI> or not. If the Word has had no influence in their ap∣prehended Conversion, there is sad ground to supect the reality of it. They that are <HI>born of God,</HI> are <HI>begotten by the Gospel</HI>; they that are <HI>sanctify'd in Christ Jesus,</HI> are <HI>sanctify'd by the Truth, the word of Truth.</HI>—And such, as may have for∣gotten by what means the first impression was made on their Souls, Such as drew in the breath of Life insensibly in Youth, should now enquire what conformity or correspondence there is between the frame of their Souls and the form of sound Words; shou'd see what characters or footsteps there are in them of the sanctifying Word of God, and whether they are chang'd into the image of it's purity. And if so, then they may be assured of the certainty of their Conver∣sion, and that the <HI>Gospel is the power of God to their Salvation,</HI> altho' (it may be) they can't call to mind the particular Word, that was the means of their Conversion.</P>
<P N="14">14. HENCE, <HI>We learn the great Reason and Occasion of Men's not profiting by the Word, to wit, because they don't duly observe and take heed unto it.</HI> If Men wou'd get their way cleansed, they must <HI>take heed to the Word.</HI> But the Gene∣rality neglect, disregard, and dispise the Word. They take little or no care to get a good under∣standing of it; they don't give due credit unto it; they take no pains to lay it up in their minds and charge their memories with it; They seldom or never meditate in God's Law; they are little

or nothing affected with the Word: They don't re∣verence &amp; love &amp; delight in it. <HI>The great Things of God's Law are counted</HI> &amp; treated by them <HI>as a strange Thing.</HI> And now unto this neglect of, and dis∣respect unto, the Word of God, is owing the <HI>Unprofitableness</HI> of many under the Gospel. <HI>The Word does not profit them, not being mixed with Faith,</HI> nor duly attended to.</P>

<P>TO move hereunto consider,—</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THRO' the forbearance of God you have still an opportunity prolonged to you.</HI> God might justly before now have put an utter end to all possibi∣lity of your Conversion and Salvation, and have appointed you your portion among the unclean Spirits in Prison: but thro' the riches of His Pa∣tience you are yet spar'd, and your day of Grace lengthen'd out; the Spirit striving with you, and the Means of Grace continu'd to you.

(a Text repeated no less than 6 or 7 times in the New-Testa∣ment, to declare it's extraordinary importance &amp; draw your attentive consideration,) &amp; also on that, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.10.—Meditate on these Texts. <HI>Me∣ditate Terror,</HI> &amp; Let your hearts tremble, lest there be written your mournful Case &amp; fearful Doom.— But let not any <HI>humble contrite</HI> Soul pervert those Scriptures to his <HI>discouragement.</HI> Let them be improv'd to quicken you to <HI>work out your Salva∣tion with fear &amp; trembling,</HI> &amp; <HI>give diligence lest any Man sail of the Grace of God.</HI>— This is the End of all the foregoing Considerations, And, Oh! that they may have this effect upon you. Seriously ponder them, &amp; let 'em excite you to <HI>cleanse your way by observing the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>AND if <HI>this</HI> be the Desire &amp; Resolution of your Soul, Let me for your encouragement add, that <HI>God is ready to assist you</HI>: and for your help let me offer these Hints by way of Direction.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>MOURN over, &amp; be afflicted for, all your past neglects &amp; abuses of the Word.</HI> Consider what an <HI>evil &amp; bitter thing it is,</HI> that you have been des∣pising the Word, &amp; breaking the Commandment. Consider what indignities you have been offering herein to the Blessed God, what affront to our gra∣cious Saviour, what outrage against the Holy Spi∣rit. Consider the ingratitude, the injustice, and many heinous aggravations of your past guilty deportment. And let your Soul be humbled in you, when you remember these things; spread your case before God, pour out your heart in peni∣tent confessions of your great guilt, &amp; ardent suppli∣cations
<PB N="186" REF="002024_0193_0FBA7A138C7CCAE8"/>
for Mercy to pardon, &amp; Grace to help you.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>FOR the Future improve this blessed Mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Grace, the</HI> Word <HI>of God, with all Diligence &amp; Care.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. BE <HI>frequent</HI> in the Duties of Reading and Hearing. Converse <HI>much</HI> with the Holy <HI>Scriptures</HI>▪ and be often waiting on God in His Holy <HI>Sanctu∣ary.</HI>—Imitate the noble <HI>Bereans</HI> in searching the Scriptures <HI>daily:</HI> and as the <HI>Kings of Israel</HI> were enjoyned, Read in this Book of the Law <HI>all the days of your life.</HI>—And further, (as the Apostle di∣rects, Jam. 1.19.) <HI>Let every man</HI> also <HI>be swift to hear.</HI> Wait daily at Wisdom's Doors, <HI>in season &amp; out of season.</HI> Seek for convenient opportunities of Hear∣ing; embrace 'em readily; improve 'em diligently. If you neglect &amp; omit any occasion needlesly and wilfully, perhaps you may then miss an <HI>accepta∣ble Time &amp; a good Day</HI> for your Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. ENTER on these <HI>Exercises</HI> with due <HI>Prepa∣ration.</HI> Dismiss the cares of this World, &amp; the pleasures of sense, which choke the Word, which stop your ears, shut your eyes, &amp; harden your heart against it. Awaken &amp; summon together your most serious Thoughts, &amp; labour by holy musing to warm your Souls, and work 'em into the most solemn Frame. Come to the Word with a <HI>free</HI> spirit, with a <HI>good &amp; honest</HI> heart, with humility, meekness &amp; teachableness, suppressing all Pride and Passion, all Prejudices &amp; Prepossessions with respect both to Doctrines &amp; Persons. Come with the disposition of serious Learners, &amp; not of cen∣sorious Carpers.—Come also with sincere views and unfeigned aims at the great End of the Word. Let not Curiosity, Custom, Company, Reputation, Interest, or the clamours of a rebuking Conscience, or any corrupt motive, be your inducement to
<PB N="187" REF="002024_0194_0FBA7A1552DE0848"/>
Read or Hear the Word at any time; But let a <HI>Desire to please &amp; honour God, &amp; profit your own Souls,</HI> be your governing principle. This is the End, which God propounds in giving us His Word; and this is answerable to the nature of the Word, and becoming the dignity of rational Creatures. And if you come with this good intention, you may hope that God will add His Blessing; but otherwise you have no ground for any such ex∣pectation. And further, you must by previous Prayer invoke &amp; engage the promised Assistences of the Holy Spirit. <HI>The preparation of the heart in Man is from the Lord,</HI> &amp; from Him comes down the Blessing. God can put your Hearts into, and keep them in, a right Temper, &amp; <HI>can teach you to profit.</HI> And He hath said, <HI>He will be enquired of by the House of Israel, to do this thing for them.</HI> Therefore ply the <HI>Throne</HI> of Grace, &amp; <HI>Give your selves to Prayer,</HI> when you apply your selves to the <HI>Word</HI> of Grace, &amp; <HI>give attendance to</HI> private <HI>Reading,</HI> or to Publick Hearing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>ATTEND Diligently,</HI> and with the whole bent of your Soul, when actually engag'd in these devout Exercises. Be not trifling, perfunctory, heedless, remiss, inadvertent. But experect, vigi∣lant, earness, constantly &amp; universally attentive. Beware of drowsy sloth, and sleepy negligence. Beware of a clouded Eye, a closed Ear, and a roving Mind. As ever you would profit by the Word, yield the most wakeful, steddy and lively atten∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion unto it. Consider, who speaks to you in the Word, even the Great God; Consider what is spoken to you, even Things of the greatest Con∣cern; &amp; let these tho'ts strike an awe upon your mind, &amp; awaken you to <HI>give earnest heed</HI> unto the Word.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="188" REF="002024_0195_0FBA7A1690953188"/>4. ENDEAVOUR to <HI>Apprehend readily.</HI> Be not slow of apprehension, &amp; <HI>dull of bearing, a People of no understanding.</HI> But <HI>let him that readeth, and him that beareth, understand.</HI> Employ your best reason &amp; consideration, &amp; <HI>set your heart</HI> to know &amp; understand the words of the Lord. We must read &amp; hear <HI>with the Spirit &amp; also with understanding.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>BELIEVE freely &amp; fully.</HI> Realize it, that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> are of <HI>Divine Inspiration,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yield a ready and firm assent unto the Truth of all you find written there. And the <HI>Word of Hearing,</HI> let that also be <HI>mixed with Faith,</HI> without which it cannot profit you. Whatsoever Doctrine the Mi∣nisters of the Word preach unto you, <HI>if they speak according to the Law &amp; the Testimony,</HI> you must <HI>re∣ceive it not as the word of Man, but as it is indeed the word of God,</HI> &amp; that without delay &amp; without reluctance. Be not <HI>faithless,</HI> neither be <HI>slow of heart to believe.</HI> If you <HI>believe not our Report,</HI> you will not have <HI>the Arm of the Lord revealed to you.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>RECEIVE the Word affectionately &amp; submissively. Receive the Truth in the love of it.</HI> Esteem every Word of God <HI>highly in Love, as a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. Delight in the Truth after the inward Man.</HI> What is said, however it thwarts your Opinions, Lusts or Interests, <HI>Receive it with meekness. God will give Grace to the hum∣ble, and the meek He will teach in His way.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>APPLY faithfully and wisely.</HI> The neglect of prudent &amp; impartial self-application is the ruin of multitudes. It is the misery &amp; folly of not a few, they <HI>shift off</HI> what they read &amp; hear upon <HI>others,</HI> &amp; do not discern or consider it's relation to <HI>themselves,</HI> nor <HI>apply</HI> it to their <HI>own</HI> Souls. And it is the unhappiness of others, they apply <HI>all</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="002024_0196_0FBA7A1B62C4C990"/>
to <HI>themselves</HI> right or wrong, without <HI>discerning be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wixt things that differ,</HI> and so often <HI>pervert the Scriptures to their own destruction.</HI>—You must be ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eful to avoid both these Errors. You must be vigilant to spy what touches &amp; affects your own Condition, &amp; readily take the Portion carved for you, whether it be an Instruction, Rebuke, Ad∣vice or Consolation. Critically remark what points at your case, and with all impartiality take it home, and hide it in your heart. Judicious and serious Application is the Soul of Hearing and Reading, as well as of Preaching.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>FORM suitable Resolutions, mixt with pious Ejaculations.</HI> Submit to every Word of God, and resolve on future conformity thereunto: and let that be the secret language of your Souls,—<HI>Good is the word of the Lord.—Teach me thy way O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: I believe, Lord, help mine unbelief.—Thou hast commanded us to keep thy Pre∣cepts diligently. O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! I will run the way of thy com∣mandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</HI>— Let these in general be the pious breathings of your Souls under the Word. And moreover, form devout Resolves and Petitions agreeable to the Tenor and Quality of every particular Truth.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>TREASURE up the Word in your Memories. Be not forgetful Hearers. Let the Word of God dwell in you richly. Hold fast the form of sound words,</HI> which you read; &amp; <HI>keep in memory what is preached to you.</HI> This is your Duty, &amp; will be much for your advantage every way, to enrich you with know∣lege, to fortify you against Error &amp; Sin, &amp; to furnish you unto every good Thought Word and Work.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>MEDITATE on the Word seriously and intensely.</HI> Digest what you hear &amp; read, by d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vout After-consideration and close Reflection. Ponder upon it, and <HI>commune with your hearts</HI> about i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> This will have a happy tendency not only to fasten it in your Memories, but also to fix and further its
<PB N="190" REF="002024_0197_0FBA7A1CA56C5280"/>
efficacy on your Souls, and to invigorate and perpetuate it's influence on your Lives. Better read <HI>one</HI> Chapter or hear <HI>one</HI> Sermon, and <HI>carefully ruminate upon it,</HI> than <HI>several</HI> in the <HI>neglect</HI> hereof. Meditation is the best Friend and Help to <HI>Knowlege</HI> &amp; <HI>Grace.</HI> 1 Joh. 2.14. <HI>I have written unto you Young Men, because ye are</HI> strong, <HI>and the word of God</HI> abideth <HI>in you.</HI>—Therefore <HI>Give thy self to meditation, that thy profiting may appear to all.</HI> Dwell on the Word by After-thought, revolve it in your mind, press and urge it on your heart, and never leave till some warm impression be made, Some religious passion drawn into vigorous exercise.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>FOLLOW the Word with earnest Supplications.</HI> Labour always fervently in Prayer, that God wou'd <HI>sanctify you thro' the Truth,</HI> &amp; <HI>teach you to profit by his Word</HI>; That He wou'd write every Truth you hear or read, by the Finger of His Spirit on your heart, with deep and indelible Characters; that He wou'd <HI>seal instruction</HI> to you and make every Word an <HI>in∣grafted Word.</HI>—And you will find it a most wise and be∣neficial practice, to <HI>pray over,</HI> as well as think over, the <HI>Particulars</HI> of the Sermon you've heard, or the portion of Scripture you've read, especially if accommodated to your case. <HI>Repeat</HI> them not only to <HI>your selves,</HI> by <HI>Meditation</HI>; but also to <HI>God,</HI> by <HI>Supplication.</HI> Turn all into <HI>Prayer.</HI> Use your best skill to Form them into an Address to God. No Scripture is so Speculative and Doctrinal, but that it is also Practical and Devotional. — And when you Pray, <HI>Pray in Faith,</HI> relving on the efficacious Spirit, and meritorious Blood of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for Assistence and Acceptance.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>WATCH against all that tends to damp &amp; destroy the influence of the Word.</HI> Keep down <HI>Lust,</HI> which wars against the Soul, and <HI>rebells against the Light</HI>; which resists the Convictions and repels the Dictates of the Word. Take heed l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st you be <HI>harden'd thro' the deceitfulness of Sin.</HI>— Keep out the <HI>World</HI>; watch against the Inroads of Worldly Cares and Fears, and beware of sinful Company, and watch against Worldly Enticements &amp; Satisfactions; all which tend to chill the influence and quench the efficacy of the Word.— And keep off the <HI>Tempter</HI>; who with many wiles and un∣wearv'd labour seeks to <HI>choke the Word,</HI> and steal away that <HI>Good Thing that is committed to us,</HI> &amp; to inspire vain Tho'ts &amp; inkindle vile Affections &amp; Desires in us. Stand therefore upon your guard, keep up a lively Care &amp; holy Jealousy over your selves; Keep an eye upon the Enemy, Acquaint your selves with His Devices, Watch all his Motions, Resist him stedfastly; and <HI>Keep your hearts with all Diligence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="002024_0198_0FBA7A21F4031BF8"/>In the <HI>Last</HI> Place, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>HERISH every good Motion begotten in you by the Word, &amp; pursue ev'ry pious Inclination quickly into exercise.</HI> Carefully observe &amp; preserve every Beam of Light and Spark of Fire, that drops in upon you. Study to maintain and improve every Heavenly Impression, &amp; to nourish good Be∣ginnings. <HI>Strike while the Iron is Hot.</HI> Take the first oppor∣tunity, while your Heart is under the <HI>warm</HI> sense &amp; influence of the Word, to answer the Call of God &amp; <HI>obey that form of sound Doctrine, which is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liver'd you.</HI>
<Q>The <HI>Primus Impetus</HI> (as One observes) affords a great advantage, if it be improved; Possibly in the vigour of it, you may overcome those great dif∣ficulties &amp; oppositions which have been too hard for you for∣merly, &amp; may otherwise give you imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diment hereafter; and these being mastered, your pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress will be easier.</Q>
Therefore <HI>immediately</HI> set your self to comply with every Direction of the Word, &amp; <HI>presently</HI> reduce every gracious disposition into Act. Do's the Word convince you of any <HI>Error? Immediately</HI> retract the same. Do's it reprove you for any <HI>Sin? Immedi∣ately</HI> forbear &amp; repent of it. Do's it condemn you for any in∣dulged <HI>Lust? Immediately</HI> set about the mortification of it. And whatsoever <HI>Grace</HI> or <HI>Duty</HI> has been recommended to you, <HI>Immediately</HI> come into the Exercise &amp; Practice of it. Grieve not the Spirit by <HI>Delays.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee to it, that you endanger not your Souls by <HI>Partiality.</HI> Let your obedience to the Word be not only <HI>Speedy,</HI> but also <HI>Universal.</HI> Let all the Powers of your whole Man pay their homage to the Word; &amp; let all the words of the whole Law receive your homage &amp; regards, <HI>that you may be perfect &amp; intire, wanting nothing.</HI> You know what was the <HI>Condemnation</HI> of the <HI>Young Man</HI> in the Gospel, — <HI>One Thing thou lackest</HI>—. Take heed lest you <HI>fall after the same Example of unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>THUS much for the first Brach of the Exhortation. In the next place,—</P>
<P N="2">2. I am to Address the <HI>Saints,</HI> or those that have felt the Divine power and efficacy of the purifying Word. Receive <HI>the Exhortation which speaks unto you in a few words.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>LET God have the Praise and Glory of all the pu∣rifying Effects of the Word.</HI> Eye and Adore the Hand of God, in the cleansing Efficacy of the Word upon you. Don't <HI>burn Incense to your own Drag,</HI> nor raise a Trophee to the power of <HI>Means,</HI> and the skill of <HI>Instruments.</HI> But <HI>Let him that gloryeth, glory in the Lord.</HI> Set the Crown on the Divine Efficiency, which <HI>worketh all in all.</HI> And magnify the Divine Mercy. See the exceeding <HI>Grace</HI> of God, in <HI>what He
<PB N="192" REF="002024_0199_0FBA75F367310CF0"/>
has done for your Soul</HI>; and pour out your thankful Praises.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>WALK humbly in the sense of your remaining Impu∣rities and Deficiencies.</HI> Give to GOD <HI>the Glory</HI> of His <HI>Grace</HI>; and take to your <HI>Self</HI> the <HI>shame</HI> of your <HI>imperfections.</HI> Consider your many defilements, and defects, and contrarieties to God's holy Word, mourn over 'em, blush for 'em, and <HI>Be not high-minded, but Fear. Rejoyce with Trembling.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>HIGHLY Prize the Word, as one of your best Pri∣vileges, and constantly improve it.</HI> It has been the Means under God of producing the most noble and excellent Effects in you; has translated you out of your natural state of Dark∣ness, Uncleanness and Misery, into an Heavenly state of Light, Purity, and Peace. And surely this consideration shou'd strongly commend and endear it to you, as it did to the holy <HI>Psalmist,</HI> who said, (Psal. 119.140.) <HI>Thy Word is very pure: Therefore thy Servant loveth it.</HI>—Maintain a high Value for it, pay a great Regard unto it. Account the Enjoyment of it one of the most desireable Articles of your pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent hap∣piness. Look on the Word as a <HI>Treasure, better than Thou∣sand of Gold &amp; Silver. Keep it in the midst of thine heart.</HI> Let it never <HI>depart out of thy mouth,</HI> nor <HI>from before thine eyes.</HI> Be much in meditation upon it. Be diligent in the improve∣ment of it. <HI>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck, write th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m upon the table of thine heart.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>STUDY to adorn the Doctrine of God your Saviour in all things. Let your conversation be as becometh the Gospel.</HI> Let your Actions be a continual Comment on the Word, &amp; so a bright Ornament to your Profession. As you expe∣rience the efficacy of it in your Hearts, let others observe the influence of it in your Lives. Let the Purity of the Word be visibly exemplify'd in your universal behaviour, and <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> be written on your whole Conduct. <HI>See that you walk circumspectly, giving no offence, giving no occasion to the Adversary to speak reproachfully, and to blaspheme the Name of God and His Doctrine. But let your Light so shine before Men, that others seeing your good works may be brought to glorify God in the day of visitation.</HI></P>
<P>I Shall now shut up all with that of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> (Phil. 2.15, 16.) <HI>Be blameless and harmless, the Sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse Generation; among whom shine ye as Lights in the World: Holding forth the word of Life; that I may rejoyce in the Day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</HI></P>
