<P>SIR MATTHEW HALE's Affectionate EPISTLES to his CHILDREN. With DIRECTIONS concerning the RELIGIOUS OBSER∣VATION of the LORD's DAY.</P>
<P>TO WHICH IS ADDED THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR. A NEW EDITION.</P>
<P>THE Editor, in presenting this work to the public, avails himself of the prevalent good sense of parents, and a consciousness of the importance of putting books of virtuous tendency in the hands of youth in general: in this view, to doubt appro∣bation—would perhaps be ignorance. He professes himself influenced by no motive, but the satis∣faction and desire of <HI>pointing to that which is good.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>CORNELIA, daughter of Scipio Africanus, and mother of the Gracchi, was not more distinguished by the nobility of her rank, than by the lustre of those virtues which adorned her character—a most amiable trait of which shines in that little incident recorded to her immortal ho∣nor. A lady of Ionia coming one day to visit her, impatiently expected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be shown the splendor and magnificence of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> toi∣lette, which she supposed, from her rank and fortune, to be very superb. The il∣lustrious Roman prolonged the conversa∣tion till her children were at hand, and then introducing them to her visitor:—"These, says she, are my jewels."</P>
<P>The writer of these letters had so great a veneration for the domestic character of
<PB N="iv" REF="022756_0004_0FBA5DEB78FE64A0"/>
that lady, that she thinks she cannot do bet∣ter than give them to the public, under th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the signature of Cornelia. And whatever their other defects may be, they have this at least to recommend them, that the same sentiments of maternal tenderness which influenced the Roman Matron, gave rise to these epistles, and prompted a fond mo∣ther to become an Author.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>A DESIRE of happiness is the first propensity of the heart.—It is born with us, and to attempt its suppression were equally fruitless and wrong; for the Author of Nature has done nothing in vain, and the happiness he has imprinted on the mind so clear an idea of, has some∣where an existence.</P>
<P>Hitherto you have obeyed the impulse of nature in the artless pursuits of child∣hood; but the time is at hand, when this sweet tranquillity will be interrupted by the bustle of the world, which will not longer permit you to repose in the simple amuse∣ments of dressing dolls, pursuing butter∣flies, or plucking daisies. Sweet dear de∣lights of innocence; on which, as you
<PB N="2" REF="022756_0006_0FBA5DEE3318FE60"/>
climb the rugged heights of life, you will look back with fond regret.</P>
<P>But we are not born for ourselves alone; and therefore have duties to perform, obli∣gations to discharge, and difficulties to en∣counter; in the course of which, many a severe check is given to this happiness which we all so ardently seek: yet the de∣sire of it will even acquire strength by the repulse, and there was never yet a wretch who had found it diminished by misfortune. I wish the success of this passion could be shown as demonstrable as its existence.</P>
<P>But the truth is, all mankind are run∣ning after the same object, though in such opposite directions, that if it were not for their concurrent testimony, it would be scarce credible that they had each the same view. Yet it is the fate of most of them to sit down at last in the very same disposi∣tion which Solomon was in when he com∣plained, rather peevishly it must be owned, that all was vanity and vexation of spirit. Man walks indeed in a vain shadow, and it is pitiable to reflect that a being of so transient a duration should yet waste the trifling portion of time allotted him in vain and fruitless pursuits, and after all the
<PB N="3" REF="022756_0007_0FBA5DEFB3A82AB8"/>
schemes of the sanguine, and the labours of the active, to find the desired attain∣ment as far off as ever.</P>
<P>But this has been the case of millions, and I am afraid will still continue to be so, at least till we are unanimous in deciding on that grand point wherein this good, of which we have all so high an idea, con∣sists: an agreement from which, alas, we are at the farthest distance imaginable. And here, my dearest girls, lies the whole of the mistake. The Creator has not been wanting to provide a happiness exalted as the mind itself can conceive, but man him∣self errs in the pursuit of it; some placing it in riches, some in power, scarcely on in an age supposing it to be where it really is—in the practice of virtue.</P>
<P>But while the human heart is set on ac∣quirements, in which it can find no satis∣faction if attained, the span of life must necessarily be passed in restless anxieties and melancholy disappointment. It was the aim of philosophy, to draw just esti∣mates of things, and to prevent its pupils from being dazzled with the splendor of wealth and power: it taught that the sove∣reign good was to be found in rectitude
<PB N="4" REF="022756_0008_0FBA5DF504D457E8"/>
of will. It would be a shame for us to be at a loss on such an important subject, who have received lessons from a much better master than ever gave lectures in the schools of Athens.</P>
<P>Rest assured that in the exercise of social and religious duties, the mind will find her solid happiness. Wandering in rest∣less search, like Noah's dove, 'tis here she finds at length the welcome olive, the branch whose verdure blooms for immorta∣lity. Should you doubt the assertion, be prevailed on at least to try the experiment.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>PLEASURE has something so al∣luring in the very name, that it is not surprizing it finds so great a number of votaries. On no account would I have you insensible to its attractions, but rather lead you to its flowery paths, and conduct you to the most refined delights. These how∣ever you can never obtain, except you are guided in the choice by taste and judgment.
<PB N="5" REF="022756_0009_0FBA5DF72AECE440"/>
A taste in pleasure is necessary for the se∣lection of such as are above the enquiries of the vulgar, suitable to delicate and re∣fined minds, and correspondent to the no∣blest sentiments: of course dependant more on intellectual, than on corporeal fa∣culties. Taste never fails to reject whatever is gross and sensual; yet even among the more refined pleasures, a found judgment is wanted, to discriminate the solid and rational, from the frivolous and fastidious. The elegant hand of fashionable dissipa∣tion has often given a polish to what, in its own nature, can never deserve the name of pleasure.</P>
<P>Under this head must be comprehended the various species of fashionable amuse∣ments, which are injurious either to health or fortune. One would scarcely suppose such pursuits as these should ever be digni∣fied with the name of pleasure. Yet when numbers are daily seen hazarding, not only extravagant sums, but peace of mind also, at the gaming-table.—When the or∣der of nature is inverted, and the refresh∣ments of repose are bartered for midnight routs, we must conclude that such valuable sacrifices are not made but with the ex∣pectation
<PB N="6" REF="022756_0010_0FBA5DF7FABA6C80"/>
of some supreme pleasure to re∣ward them: how seldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rewards are found, can best be determined by the tes∣timony of the dissipated and gay, who af∣ter they have wasted the most valuable bles∣sings of life, as time, health, spirits, &amp;c. will generally confess that they have never found the satisfactions they sought after.</P>
<P>To be able to divest real enjoyment from the false glosses the world has put upon it, is a piece of wisdom becoming a philoso∣pher; but it is a piece of wisdom, you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny dear girls, must also acquire, if you expect to be happy. Fashion has arro∣gated to itself the prerogative of fixing the criterion of pleasure; but fashion is often a dangerous director, and is at best an imperfect one; for who has a power of effectually biassing the natural disposition of another: if therefore what is called amusement, be not agreeable to the real-turn of the mind, it ceases to be viewed in that light, and can only be considered as an irksome conformity to the tastes of others.</P>
<P>Yet, abject as such a submission undoubt∣edly is, there are thousands who volunta∣rily yield to it, who are content to live, move, and act, not as they like themselves,
<PB N="7" REF="022756_0011_0FBA5DF98472A430"/>
but as the polite world thinks fit to dictate. I am no advocate for affected singularity in things merely indifferent; but when the idol fashion breaks in upon the rules of virtue (as it too often does) or the true enjoyment of life, this is so mean a slavery that a rational being might be expected to despise it.</P>
<P>When therefore reason and religion have given the clue to your pleasures, resolve always to have them of your own choosing, and not of other people's. The sanction of numbers is the cause that draws youth from virtue and happiness: reason, when aided by a proper education, would if left to herself, point out the way to both.</P>
<P>There are pleasures, my dear girls, to be met with in this journey of life, pure and sublime ones too, if we look for them through the medium of unvitiated taste. Did you ever discharge a social duty, but upon looking into your heart, you there perceived a glow of satisfaction? But if you aim at more exalted, more rapturous sensations, give full scope to the impulses of benevolence: try what it is to heal the broken-hearted: diffuse joy through the mansions of sorrow, and rescue merit from
<PB N="8" REF="022756_0012_0FBA5DFAF3FFEB90"/>
the pressure of indigence and misfortune.—These employments are capable of yield∣ing pleasures suitable to the most exalted capacities, boundless as the most sanguine imagination can paint them.</P>
<P>But if so vast a multitude has erred in the pursuit of pleasure, through levity, not an inconsiderable number, of a very opposite temper, are at equally as great a distance from it: these are the morose and cynical, who will not condescend to the sober satisfactions that are to be found in a domestic circle, where the social affections are cultivated; if the gay and volatile mis∣take the nature of pleasure, these seem to question its very existence, and pass through life without stooping to pick up one of the fair blossoms which nature has scatter∣ed in the way.</P>
<P>Ever be your hearts open to the sweet emotions of social love, and you will not have cause to complain that the path of hu∣man life affords nothing but briars and thorns.</P>
<P>Nor is it from the relative duties alone we can derive happiness: the amusing, the interesting book of nature is open to all who can read it: here you meet with eter∣nal
<PB N="9" REF="022756_0013_0FBA5E00B1225A98"/>
variety, order, and beauty; a thou∣sand charms await the mind which possesses a taste for simple pleasures; to such the whole creation is a boundless source of rational amusements. Happy, ineffably happy, they who can be pleased with art∣less nature, and contemplate with delight, the noble imagery with which she abounds. For my part, I should desire no greater proof of the purity and elegance of your taste, than to hear you speak in raptures of the graceful foliage of a wood, the beauty of a lawn, or any of those charm∣ing rural scenes which are so often over∣looked for the far less nobler productions of art.</P>
<P>Esteem me ever the most affectionate of your friends.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY one knows that human life is exposed to various miseries; but every one does not know, at least does not consider, that the far greater part of these
<PB N="10" REF="022756_0014_0FBA5E0294783818"/>
miseries spring from the passions: yet the passions, you reply, are implanted in us by nature—we cannot eradicate them.</P>
<P>That is true; you cannot eradicate the passions, nor is it expedient you should; for as we are the workmanship of Infinite Wisdom, so doubtless the propensities He has formed us with, are in themselves very good: but then their good or ill tendency must be determined by this single question, Whether they govern us, or we govern them? In the latter case they resemble those salutary breezes, which waft health and sweetness on their wings: in the for∣mer they may be compared to certain hur∣ricanes, which tear up all before them, and deform the beauteous aspect of the most luxuriant climates. There is more felicity to be found in the world than is often supposed; but never let us pretend to look for it before we have silenced the passions, the perpetual contention we must have with them will else interrupt our successful search.</P>
<P>Pride, my dear girls, is a vice that springs up in the mind, almost without her attend∣ing to it: its character are an immode∣rate self-love, conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ness, an arrogance,
<PB N="11" REF="022756_0015_0FBA5E04088F2D68"/>
with a profound contempt of every other person; ever insatiable in its desire of respect, extremely susceptible of the slightest af∣fronts, and jealous of the least tribute of applause paid to another. Persons of this cast cannot in the nature of things be hap∣py, as they may be said to live in a state of hostility with all the world: like Ish∣mael, they have their hands against every man, and every man's hand is against them.</P>
<P>Ambition condemns its wretched votary to forego the sweets of content and present case, for the uneasy dreams of rank and and power. It is happy for the world, when fate denies to the ambitious that power to which their desires are perpetu∣ally aspiring. Innumerable are the hor∣rid deeds, which the historic page records, that have been perpetrated by the impulse of this restless passion; yet if in pity to mankind, its direful effects are restrained, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ill the bosom where it rages, must be a prey to inexpressible agonies.</P>
<P>Envy is a natural attendant on pride and ambition: it has very aptly been compar∣ed to a vulture preying on the vitals, and there could not possib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have been devised a more expressive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tude. That mind
<PB N="12" REF="022756_0016_0FBA5E0573968718"/>
which is capable of regarding with the least degree of regret, the more fortunate acquirements of another, has a perpetual source of disquietude, and must for ever pine beneath the inexpressible misery, which is both the consequence and the pu∣nishment of so base a propensity: as envy is the meanest of all the pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, so in its own nature it is the most opposite to hap∣piness.</P>
<P>Covetousness is a vice that absorbs every finer feeling of the soul. Whatever sordid satisfaction the miser may feel in amassing his treasures, yet the cares which unavoid∣ably attend it, and the solicitude the pre∣servation of it demands, more than ba∣lance the selfish gratification.—He knows nothing of the sweet emotions of charity and benevolence, and must be ever a stran∣ger to the noble sensations they excite. It is well if the suggestions of his boundless avarice do not prompt him beyond the bounds of integrity. The honesty of a covetous person can be but doubtful at the best.</P>
<P>A revengeful disposition is as dreadful to society as burdensome to itself: it is the whirlwind of the soul, which under its do∣minion
<PB N="13" REF="022756_0017_0FBA5E0705B92A08"/>
resembles a fury of the infernal regions. What sad catastrophes have been effected by revenge! what inexpressible torment overwhelms the heart, where that dreadful venom operates!</P>
<P>It is easy to perceive by the slightest glance, that every one of the passions here enumerated are totally destructive of peace: there can be no such thing as tranquillity in the breast which they inhabit: let it then be the care of my dearest girls, to guard against the fatal ascendancy of either of them. There cannot be a more la∣mentable object than a human being who submits to become the sport of passions: a bark in a storm driven by winds, and shattered by the tempest, exhibits but a faint picture of such a wretch, whose days pass in continual anguish; he looks for peace, but finds despair; casts oblique re∣flections on the wisdom and goodness of Providence; distrusts his attributes; curses his own being, and dies if possible more wretched than he lived.</P>
<P>The infinitely wise and good Creator saw the abundant evils that would accrue to mankind from the degeneracy of the passions, and therefore in his goodness de∣termined
<PB N="14" REF="022756_0018_0FBA5E08870F9248"/>
at an appointed time to promul∣gate a religion, the aim of which should be to regulate the passions, and direct them to their proper channel: such is the christian revelation; in its end and nature an anti∣dote to moral evil.</P>
<P>Perhaps the natural passions of the hu∣man mind may be reduced to two—the love of pleasure and the love of praise, and from the corruptions of these may be traced every irregular affection of the heart—when men no longer knew the true source from whence to look for happiness, or ap∣probation, it is not much wonder it should be fought in power, riches, and pre-emi∣nence; nor that the love of these should branch into self-love, vain glory, and all the other evil passions, which cause so much misery in the world.</P>
<P>The regulation of the heart and its de∣sires, is a point then of the utmost import∣ance, since on it depends your present peace and eternal glory. "Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life." And when you have repelled the approach of any passion, guard still more effectually against its entrance, by endea∣vouring to establish in your mind the con∣trary
<PB N="15" REF="022756_0019_0FBA5E0A5B388950"/>
virtue;—as for instance, subdue pride and cherish humility; guard against the desire of power and riches, by attaining that poverty of spirit which is content with little, and desires no applause but that of Heaven.</P>
<P>Never lose sight of this truth—that there is no happiness adequate to the capacities of the human soul, but what is found in the exercise of piety and virtue; nor any praise worthy her regard, but what results immediately therefrom. Adieu,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE most glorious conquest you can possibly obtain is that of yourselves. Solomon was of opinion, that he who could govern his own spirit, had attained a much higher point of dominion, than if he should rule a kingdom. It is cer∣tainly much easier to give wise and upright laws to others, than to obey them our∣selves; and when you can controul your
<PB N="16" REF="022756_0020_0FBA5E0BAECAC668"/>
own inclination, you will have learned the whole essence of moral philosophy.</P>
<P>But a negative virtue is not all that is to be attained, although thousands content with it, maintain through life the charac∣ter of good sort of people. The epithet, however, contains no very high eulogium, those good kind of folks seldom getting above a mediocrity in goodness. It cer∣tainly is not sufficient to abstain from evil, a christian must be distinguished by active virtue.</P>
<P>The christian religion is a beautiful com∣ment on the moral law. The priest who passed by the wounded Jew, was for aught we are told to the contrary, a very good sort of man, and had some sentiments of compassion, for he went and <HI>looked</HI> on the poor creature, and no doubt kindly <HI>wished</HI> it had been in his power to relieve him; but the good, the benevolent Samaritan, was the generous, <HI>active</HI> friend, whose character will never be read without being admired. The Lawyer also possessed a to∣lerable share of negative merit, having al∣ways kept the commandments; yet says our Saviour, thou lackest one thing—that heroic benevolence, which disregards all
<PB N="17" REF="022756_0021_0FBA5E0E45B48E58"/>
attention to selfish gratification, in the no∣ble ardour with which it contributes to the necessities of mankind.</P>
<P>These instances are fine illustrations of the Mosaic dispensation, and eminently tend to exalt human nature to the highest possible perfection. Is it not enough, say the gospel tenets, that ye refrain from ac∣tual violence to any one—you shall love your enemies, and do good to those that hate you. Severe injunction!—yet you see by it, to how refined a pitch the virtue of a christian must aspire.</P>
<P>Do not then rest satisfied with being as just or kind as the letter of the law exacts—be actively good, and seek occasions of ex∣ercising your kindness and charity—to ad∣minister as far as we are able to the wants of our fellow creatures—to reclaim the vi∣cious—to vindicate the character of the injured—assert the claims of the friendless and oppressed—reconcile differences, and be indefatigable in the promotion of peace and happiness to all within the compass of our ability, are employments worthy of a rational being.</P>
<P>There are many cases that occur in life, wherein those who will obey only the rules
<PB N="18" REF="022756_0022_0FBA5E11C0D4B520"/>
of legal justice, must fall short of those notions of honesty, which natural reason and conscience suggest; as a good mind wants not the bonds of human laws, so on some occasions it rises to a generosity that is superior to their narrow limits. Obey the innate ideas of rectitude which God himself has stamped on the human soul—and think it not sufficient to be just, ex∣cept you are generous also.</P>
<P>Let your conduct be regulated by the nicest rules of propriety and prudence; and let your bosoms glow with the enthu∣siasm of virtue, that you may ever shine forth the steady zealous friend, the bene∣volent active neighbour, and the truly useful member of society; considering yourselves as citizens of the world, whose only business in it, is to do good.</P>

<P>BUT so exalted and refined a turn of sentiment is never the production of ignorance. It is only in cultivated minds
<PB N="19" REF="022756_0023_0FBA5E14813BB838"/>
we must look for it; for the prime fruits of virtue grow not in the soil that has ne∣ver been broken up by moral instruction. A virtuous and intelligent friend is per∣haps the most valuable acquisition a young person can make; but as one of this descrip∣tion may never fall to your lot, supply the want thereof, as well as you can, by books.</P>
<P>By all means cultivate a taste for reading, but take care that your taste be a just one—that is, be more desirous of instruction than amusement, or you will profit but little by literary pursuits. Those who read merely to please the imagination, may be sure of not reading to advantage, and do seldom acquire a relish for works of so∣lid merit and utility. I have never known a young person who was fond of novels capable of relishing any thing superior to them. For my own part, I had rather see a girl wholly ignorant of the alphabet, than attached to that species of writing; for I am convinced that infinitely more have erred in the conduct of life from that cause, than from any other. The sentiments and ideas they impress, are fatal illusions to mislead the poor reader, who, after wast∣ing days and years in the study, is still an
<PB N="20" REF="022756_0024_0FBA5E1615DD61B0"/>
utter stranger to the world she lives in—and, what is worse, inspired with the most erroneous notions of it, which commonly lead to some false step, or ill-judged con∣nection, that secures her a wretch for life. It cannot be otherwise—for the scenes, cha∣racters, and incidents, these books describe, are to be found no where but in the au∣thor's romantic fancy. They have nothing to do with the real knowledge of the world; and, consequently, those who think to steer through it by such guides, must, in the end, find themselves mistaken. Just as well may a traveller think to make the tour of Europe by a chart of Asia.</P>
<P>If curiosity must be amused, and the imagination pleased, why may not the understanding be improved at the same time? This is very practicable, for there are many works of genius extremely well calculated to answer each of these ends; but they are not the histories of Sir such-a-one, Miss what d'ye call <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, or any of those futile productions, which the press daily emits, to vitiate the taste, and cor∣rupt the principles of the age.</P>
<P>There is a certain mental vigour neces∣sary to virtue as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o happiness, but
<PB N="21" REF="022756_0025_0FBA5E1780515C20"/>
modern novels, under the specious mask of refined sentiments, introduce a dangerous softness that has often destroyed both. True refinement is the glory of a rational creature, but whatever enervates the mind, must debase it. Lycurgus thought so, I suppose, when he banished the poets from his commonwealth; yet surely he lived near enough to Athens to have learned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> draw a proper line between ferocity and ef∣feminacy.</P>
<P>The passion for novelty, so inherent in youth, may be abundantly gratified, by the study of history. Here you meet with new and uncommon events—become ac∣quainted with a variety of characters, and are enabled to form a just estimate of man∣kind; for, except allowing for a few local customs or prejudices, human nature was the same two thousand years ago as at this time. There is something extremely agree∣able to the mind in weighing and examin∣ing the actions of celebrated p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>onages, who, in their day, made the mighty trem∣ble—in marking the rise or fall of em∣pires, and to be able to determine the se∣cret causes of those revolutions which once astonished the world.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="022756_0026_0FBA5E19015A67B0"/>
The ages appear as inconsiderable points, to those who are acquainted with history—they see the various nations of the earth pass in review before them, and trace a more than human power busy in the af∣fairs of men—by taking in at one compre∣hensive view so vast a tract of time, they discern the nice connections of that scheme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Providence, which often appears broken and irregular, when contemplated only through the medium of a few years.</P>
<P>It is almost impossible to be well versed in the characters of the politer nations of antiquity, without catching something of that magnanimity which distinguished them; and I know not why an acquaintance with their manners should not be thought as ne∣cessary in the system of female education, as it usually is in that of the other sex. If the Greek and Roman veterans displayed qualities which the heroes of the present day would be proud to imitate, their wives and daughters were often patterns of such virtues, as would be allowed to dignify a lady of the eighteenth century.</P>

and interesting—the heart, too, may be the better for it—narrow prejudices are removed, and the better mankind become acquainted with each other, the more the divine principle of philantropy must be extended.

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>AS long as curiosity continues a lead∣ing feature in the human character, biography will form a favourite species of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ding. Every body is eager to pry into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> private character of a celebrated per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>age, and are better pleased to know, how such an one acts in domestic life, than in the senate, or the field. And, indeed, it is there that the best estimate of the real description can be formed.</P>
<P>The private lives of famous persons afford much edification to the reader; the vice or meanness too often there displayed, teaches us not to be dazzled by the blaze of po∣pularity or power; and to contemn that virtue which is built on the desire of fame alone. If on the other hand, by follow∣ing these darlings of fame to the closet, or the fire-side▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> discover the same nobleness of heart that distinguishes them with the mul∣titude, justly they become patterns for our example; the mind rejoices to find some∣thing about them that is <HI>imitable,</HI> for tho'
<PB N="25" REF="022756_0029_0FBA5E21F3F3E570"/>
few are called forth as distinguished actors on the theatre of the world, all may, if they please, be <HI>great</HI> in private life; that is, may acquire those amiable qualities of mind, which can only constitute real great∣ness; without which the hero is no more than a hypocrite, and even the robe of roy∣alty, but a tinsel ornament to cover real meanness.</P>
<P>Your chief aim should be the knowledge of the human heart, and that is in general more fully discovered in trifling traits and circumstances, than by important actions performed under the public eye. But you no where find human nature so impartially delineated, as in the sacred writings. There the historians neither influenced by passion or prejudice, relate both actions and their secret springs with unerring can∣dour; never calumniating enemies, or stooping to flatter the favourites of their nation.</P>
<P>The Jewish writers had the fairest op∣portunities imaginable for exaggerating the virtues of their heroes, considering the mi∣raculous powers so often exerted in their behalf. Such an adventure as that of Da∣vid with Goliah, would have been thought
<PB N="26" REF="022756_0030_0FBA5E349E7D2D00"/>
by a pagan writer, sufficient grounds for exalting his favourite to a God; yet the inspired Biographer has drawn that Prince with all his frailties about him; all the in∣equality of humanity; sometimes glowing with the rapturous devotion of a Sera∣phim;—at others, enslaved by the mean∣est passions. Such instances of candour, considered with the national pride of the Jews, leave no room to doubt the vera∣city of the sacred penman on any occasion.</P>
<P>The scriptures also finely illustrate many parts of profane history: we are told of embattled armies, and cities levelled with the dust; but it is only in holy writ we find those armies prophetically marshalled, and that destruction denounced perhaps an hundred years before the event. These are instances which impress the mind with reverence for the sacred records, and fill it with august ideas of the eternal Provi∣dence.</P>
<P>The works of our best moralists will not be unentertaining to you, if your taste for reading be as good as I wish it. Amongst the productions of this kind are the Spec∣tator and the Rambler; as conspicuous for the elegance of their language, as the soundness of their morality. But there
<PB N="27" REF="022756_0031_0FBA5E3588D7E2B0"/>
are no better rules for the moral conduct of life, than are found in the writings of Solomon, and the Son of Sirach; which, though composed so many ages ago, may yet be read to much advantage, by those who would pass through life happily and respected.</P>
<P>If you are fond of poetry, be careful to read only what is good of it. There is a kind of versification that tends to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> the mind;—wherever immorality or inde∣licacy is found, such must ever be the ef∣fect. Elegance of numbers, though a re∣quisite, is yet the lowest recommendation of good poetry;—its characteristics are dignity of thought, purity of expression, and, above all, the best principles of piety and morality. For this reason, those poet∣ical pieces extant in the Bible are by good judges allowed to be truly sublime. Poe∣try in its original state, being only the har∣monious effusions of a mind glowing with elevated sentiments of generosity, gratitude and devotion. Many of the Psalms are no∣ble compositions, and neither for beauty of figure, or energy of expression, have ever been excelled.</P>
<P>Natural history affords a delightful study—it
<PB N="28" REF="022756_0032_0FBA5E37008EFD78"/>
is not however expected that you should have a systematic idea of every vegetable, animal, or infect; but it is unpardonable, for one who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blest with leisure and op∣portunity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have at least a general knowledge of the most conspicuous of Nature's works;—to be ignorant of the beauty and properties of those, is to wan∣der over the fair creation, as Thomson ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sses it, "with brute unconscious gaze." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> curious and intelligent spectator finds the variegated face of nature, a source of rational amusement, and reads in glowing characters the wisdom of the Deity. It is not in such pursuits that the human mind acquires those illiberal sentiments which so often disgrace it;—all it here finds is no∣ble and beneficent, worthy that Divine Author, whom to know and adore, is the proper glory of an intelligent being.</P>
<P>Akenside has so elegantly expressed the pleasures attending a taste for the study and beauties of nature, that I will relieve you from the tediousness of this epistle, by transcribing a few of his admired lines.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the accomplishments ne∣cessary to the female character, I think needle-work may claim the first place, it having so close a connection with neat∣ness, which is indisputably requisite to ren∣der you comfortable to yourselves, or ami∣ble in the esteem of others. The ladies of the last century certainly held needle work in much greater estimation than those of the pre∣sent; witness the many laborious performances that yet remain as proofs of their amazing industry in this respect—but the world is ever prone to extremes, and because this art was then pursued to the exclusion of every intellectual accomplishment, there
<PB N="31" REF="022756_0035_0FBA5E3C1DB01CE8"/>
are many in our days who seem to thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beneath their study or ambition.</P>
<P>The Mahomet an sentiment which prevailed some years ago, of the inferiority of the female mind, seems exploded in this age <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> universal refinement; and a woman of cul∣tivated understanding is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> longer a ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eno∣nomenon. The path<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of knowledge are rendered accessible—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> stooped from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to accelerate the improvements <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the other sex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, explain for their assistance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in polite literature.</P>
<P>Make all the use you possibly can of such advantages, and be convinced that the cul∣tivation of the mind will exalt you in the estimation of rational beings—will open to you exhaustless sources of amusement and delight, of which the ignorant can have no conception—yet be careful my dear girls, never to overlook one feminine grace or accomplishment. There is a line of cha∣racter drawn between the sexes, which nei∣ther can pass without becoming contempti∣ble. It is not to make you despise those acquirements which have ever been appro∣priated to the female sex, that you are in∣cited
<PB N="32" REF="022756_0036_0FBA5E27841E36E8"/>
to mental attainments, but to render you still more valuable as women; and the better your minds are cultivated, the more you will see the propriety of attending to those minutiae which become the condi∣tion in which Providence has placed you.</P>
<P>I do not see how you can acquit yourself tolerably in domestic life, without a know∣ledge of needle-work; but granting your rank and fortune may pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you above the absolute necessity of learning that part of it which is called plain-work—yet consider how far the ornamental kinds may be of use to amuse the intervals of pleasures, or other pursuits, as well as to promote the display of an elegant taste. Even our in∣nocent amusements require variation, and the mind may be agreeably relieved, by imitating with the needle the beautiful pro∣ductions of nature—but there is something which places a skill in needle-work in a much more important point of view, and that is, the inconstancy of fortune, which in her capricious moods has been often known to compel those, whom once she smiled on, to procure their subsistence by those very arts which were acquired only for amusement. Whatever may be a resource
<PB N="33" REF="022756_0037_0FBA5E3D23EB9E20"/>
against that mutability which marks all human affairs, becomes an object of im∣portance.</P>
<P>A proficiency in the arts of domestic ma∣nagement and oeconomy, ought justly to be ranked among the accomplishments of a young lady. You must be unacquainted with nothing that appertains to good house∣wifery. Some girls have I known profess so violent an attachment to literary pursuits, that they are content to remain ignorant of common attainments. This shows a pi∣tiable weakness—elevated minds are atten∣tive to every thing; and, believe me, it is very possible to possess a competent know∣ledge of polite literature, and be well vers∣ed in the methods of well governing a house at the same time—the latter qualifi∣cations have of themselves constituted ma∣ny an useful character in female life, which is more than can be said of the former. Blend therefore, my beloved girls, <HI>polite</HI> with <HI>useful</HI> acquirements, and you will be what I wish you.</P>
<P>In writing, acquire, if possible, a good hand; yet that is not so essentially necessa∣ry as the being able to write grammatically—the violation of the <HI>common</HI> rules of grammar is an indisputable mark of low
<PB N="34" REF="022756_0038_0FBA5E3EDC5D4E88"/>
breeding; and although my Lord Chester∣field sarcastically said, that bad spelling was only allowable in a woman, it certainly is not in any one, who pretends to an edu∣cation above the vulgar. Could you write as fine a hand as even A—n himself, bad spelling would disgrace the whole. The substituting <HI>have</HI> for <HI>has, are</HI> for <HI>is,</HI> &amp;c. infallibly sinks you in the estimation of well bred persons. In order to avoid errors of this kind, habit is to be particu∣larly guarded against. If in your early years you are not careful to write and spell correctly, it is a thousand to one if you ever do. You see, therefore, of what con∣sequence it is that you pay a present at∣tention to these points.</P>
<P>I reckon among the useful attainments, the ability of penning an epistle with pro∣priety and elegance—many fortunate cir∣cumstances in life may be facilitated there∣by—a well wrote letter has often effected what verbal requests have sought in vain—besides this consideration, how greatly must the sweet intercourse of friendship be im∣proved by a free and intelligent correspon∣dence! Two friends, though placed at the extremities of the globe, may thus enjoy
<PB N="35" REF="022756_0039_0FBA5E4018C051A8"/>
all the pleasures of such a connection; but except you attain the desirable habit of expressing your sentiments without em∣barrassment, hope not to enjoy any thing of so delicate a satisfaction. Letters should be the pictures of the soul; and so they al∣ways would be, if people acquired only the knack of expressing their thoughts just as they arise. Write as you would speak, were the persons you address immediately before you. There is no more than this necessary to establish that easiness of style which is the chief beauty of epistolary correspondence. That good breeding which I hope will be habitual to you, will dictate those terms and forms of address the condition of those you write to require—We do not always find the most learned people write the most agreeable letters—perhaps for no other reason than that they take too much trouble about it, and like the good Archbishop of Benevento, reject the first thought that occurs. Some that I have known indite an epistle in such a stiff and formal style, and load it so disgustfully with tautology, that one would almost
<PB N="36" REF="022756_0040_0FBA5E418B36B658"/>
take it for an act of parliament. When you write a letter, my dear girls, forget the idea of pen, ink, and paper—suppose only you are speaking to the person, and you will write an <HI>agreeable,</HI> if not a <HI>fine</HI> letter—to effect the latter, some∣thing must have been done by dame Nature—howewer, this I know, that the most ele∣vated sentiments would not look graceful in such compositions, except accompanied by perfect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase and expression, and have the appearance of flowing spontaneously from the heart. Many excellent models of epistolary writing have been recommended to young proficients. You cannot have better than those ascribed to Pope Gan∣ganelli;—whoever was the author, he has certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it on that ease, sprightliness, and elegance, which it is my earnest wish may characterise whatever falls from your pen.—Would to Heaven that all the world possessed the same candour and liberality of sentiment which breathes through every one of those elegant epistles.</P>

<P>WHEN you compare the aukward motions of a rustic, with the gen∣teel and graceful movement of a person of education, you cannot but be assured of the utility of dancing: but it should never be forgotten, that to give this superiority of mien and air is the chief end of that po∣lite accomplishment;—to lose sight of this idea is to take away the real worth of that branch of genteel education;—to reduce it to an unimportant, if not pernicious attainment. However a knowledge of dancing may sometimes conduce to social pleasure, and in that light be esteemed an agreeable and innocent recreation, I can∣not help thinking, that the same applica∣tion that is requisite to form an opera dancer, may very well be dispensed with in a young lady of a different character. The extra∣vagant leaps and gestures of some fashion∣able females, make me think of the speech of Philip of Macedon to his son, on another occasion—I am ready to ask if they "are not ashamed to <HI>dance</HI> so well."</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="022756_0042_0FBA5E2990AC3810"/>
There is scarce a human soul, however apparently dead to sensibility, but is in some measure alive to the extatic charms of music. The story of Orpheus is more than a fable—minds almost as inert and in∣animate as trees themselves, have been moved by the power of harmonious sounds;—why else does the gaping rustic follow with such manifest delight the itinerant musician? and why, but that the effect of music on the passions is so incontestibly proved, has the army adopted the sons of Apollo with those of Mars?—Since then this science has so great an influence on the feelings of the soul, is it not surprising that the polite world should not be more ambitious of enjoying those sublime sen∣sations, which the best pieces are so abun∣dantly capable of exciting, and not rest poorly satisfied with the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke warm plea∣sures of sing-song, while the noble com∣positions of great masters, lie by totally disregarded. Indulge, my dear girls, a turn for music, if nature has given you such; but do not permit a song <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or an opera air, to be the limits of your ex∣cellence in that enchanting science.</P>
<P>Drawing, painting, &amp;c. justly form a part of polite education, because they fur∣nish an agreeable, as well as rational amuse∣ment.
<PB N="39" REF="022756_0043_0FBA5E448495C848"/>
They lead to a familiarity with the beauties of nature, and that can scarcely fail to advance the mind a degree higher, even to the contemplation of her Divine Au∣thor. But if it had not this happy tendency, drawing is still a laudable amusement, be∣cause an innocent one; and whatever fur∣nishes a recreation of that nature, may certainly be deemed an auxiliary to virtue.</P>
<P>An acquaintance with the languages of polite nations greatly enlarges the mind. It is the property of ignorance to esteem nothing valuable that a foreign country produces; and scarcely to allow that its in∣habitants are human. Nothing tends more immediately to remove such illiberal preju∣dices, than studying the language of the people thus despised. The supercilious contemner is surprised to find them rational, and expressing similar ideas with those of his own country.</P>
<P>If necessity or inclination ever leads you from your native land, a previous acquain∣tance with the language of those you re∣side among, would much facilitate your pleasure and convenience; would open to you the avenues of social love and friend∣ship, and take off much from those com∣fortless sensations the mind is apt to feel in
<PB N="40" REF="022756_0044_0FBA5E4A9EC1B010"/>
the idea of being amongst a people it knows not. For this end, perhaps it may be suffici∣ent to acquire the knowledge of the French tongue, that being generally understood by intelligent persons of every European na∣tion. But there is another advantage at∣tending this branch of polite education, and which probably to you, my dear girls, will be the most useful—I mean the being able to read in their original, those beautiful compositions which lose many of their excellencies by translation. For this reason become acquainted also with the Italian; but Homer and Virgil, you tell me, have beauties that can never be translated—true, yet these I fancy you must be con∣tent to taste as pure as the labours of the learned afford them; the Greek and Latin tongues, forming no part in the polite sys∣tem of female education at present, nor certainly ever can in the <HI>useful.</HI></P>
<P>Arithmetic is a dry study, yet certainly a very useful one, to those who would ma∣nage their affairs with oeconomy and pru∣dence;—a thorough knowledge of the four first rules is sufficient to enable you to do it.</P>
<P>From a total ignorance of letters in female life, we are advanced to an age which requires
<PB N="41" REF="022756_0045_0FBA5E4BFA6ECD20"/>
every girl to be made a grammarian; yet it unfortunately happens, that of the numbers who profess to have studied the grammar of their native tongue, few speak or write it with that accuracy which could be wish∣ed; indeed the progress that women usually make in that science, is seldom of itself sufficient to give an habitual elegance of expression; they are more indebted for it to frequent reading of the best authors, and the conversation of those who have themselves acquired it perfect. What you can, acquire of grammar by such assistances as these. There is an indispensable ne∣cessity for you to write and speak English correctly: acquire that qualification as ea∣sily as you can, but nothing will more fa∣cilitate it, than the methods I have men∣tioned.</P>
<P>Geography is a study that will please you an hundred times better,—this is not like the former, a set of dry rules, but almost every advance you make therein, will abun∣dantly repay your pains by the novelty of the information it produces. Besides, I cannot imagine, how the frequent relations that occur in common discourse, will be intelligible, without some acquaintance with this study. I am sure if you are no
<PB N="42" REF="022756_0046_0FBA5E4D7AB3C948"/>
geographer, even a newspaper will be as in∣explicable as an Egyptian hieroglyphic. Attain a competent knowledge of the globe on which you live, that your apprehension of infinite wisdom may be enlarged; which, it will be in a much higher degree, if you take care to acquire a general idea of the struc∣ture of the universe. It is not expected you should become adepts in astronomy, but a knowledge of its leading principles, you may, and ought to obtain. The French, with their usual attention to the sex, have procured them a gentleman usher, if I may so speak, to the planetary orbs—Fonte∣nelle introduces them to an acquaintance with that brilliant assembly—it is not the first instance, in which our agreeable neigh∣bours have blended the researches of the scholar, with the politeness of a fine gentle∣man.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>AN accomplished character has so ma∣ny charms, that nothing needs be said to induce you to <HI>wish,</HI> at least, for its
<PB N="43" REF="022756_0047_0FBA5E4F1EE47A50"/>
attainment. Yet painful application must render that wish effectual—a reflection howe∣ver that should excite your emulation, rather than despondency—trivial acquirements may content the indolent and timid, but the arduous and difficult are the proper aim of elevated minds. Courage belongs not to the warrior alone,—it is as often found in the closet, as the field.</P>
<P>That resolution which is necessary for every valuable purpose of life, is the fruit only of active minds, and was never found with indolence and sloth;—determine there∣fore to conquer every tendency to an inac∣tive temper. Whenever you feel in your∣selves an inaptitude for doing what neces∣sarily ought to be done, rouse that mo∣ment, or you will give ground to an ene∣my the most destructive to happiness and virtue; and who once entrenched is hard to be dislodged. Never defer to the next hour, that which should be the business of the present. "Whatever thy hand find∣eth to do, do it, with all thy might," said a very wise man many hundred years ago; indeed there is no precept throughout the sacred writings, inculcated with greater energy than this of diligence. It is the
<PB N="44" REF="022756_0048_0FBA5E507169D378"/>
soul of virtue—the foundation of honor and affluence.</P>
<P>Many a bright and shining talent lies hid in a napkin, for want of activity to un∣fold it; nor do we unfrequently meet with persons struggling with distresses, which require only their own exertions to remove. Indolence takes hold of the disposition much oftener than is acknowledged; it is possi∣ble to be wholly under its dominion, and yet suspect nothing of it: and, what is yet more strange, to believe one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s self to be the most diligent person in the world at the very time. You have seen numbers of bud∣ling people, who are always in a hurry, and so perplexed do they appear with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as never to be able to enjoy a friend or them∣selves. It would seem hard at first sight to accuse them of indolence, and yet they are of all people most commonly under its power; for an habitual diligence would so comfort∣ably arrange the affairs of life, that none would be found to intrude on another. Consider the surprising dispatch with which some in public stations, manage a multi∣plicity of the most important concerns;—to contemplate them, one would almost con∣clude nothing too extensive for the com∣pass
<PB N="45" REF="022756_0049_0FBA5E543A650D08"/>
of the human mind;—diligence is the charm which effects it all.</P>
<P>In that dismal catalogue of diseases which imbitter mortality, not a few owe their ex∣istence to indolence. The indigent labour∣er who toils for daily bread, knows no∣thing of that sad train of nervous disorders which render life itself burdensome to the wealthy. In some cases, poverty might justly be called a blessing. Great are the atchievements which resolution and diligence can effect:—in nothing is their power more conspicuously seen, than in the culti∣vation of the mind: to reflect on the pro∣gress of the human understanding—to com∣pare the refinements of philosophy with a state of savage nature—a Newton, with an inhabitant of New Holland—we should al∣most conclude some supernatural power must have contributed to give the former so infinite a superiority in the scale of beings. Without the quality I have recommended, it could never have been attained, for though much be owing to accidental ad∣vantages, such as the being born in an enlightened kingdom affords, yet no incon∣siderable portion of diligence is required to render these advantages personally effec∣tual. It is this, my dear girls, that makes
<PB N="46" REF="022756_0050_0BFA5E55B41F5E58"/>
them yours, and without it, the soul will remain as uninformed as if destined to a land where science never darts a cheering beam.</P>
<P>It may seem strange to tell you of old age, before you have scarce passed your in∣fancy; yet I must not conceal from you, that a period will arrive, when exterior attractions will be no more;—when mental acquirements will prove your highest lustre and sublimest comfort. However despica∣ble an ignorant woman appears at any part of her life, in the decline of it she is sure to become far more contemptible; at that time, it is the improvements she has made in early days, that give dignity of character. An old age of cards necessarily succeeds a youth of folly. Pope could not have said any thing more destructive of the insignifi∣cancy of those ancient habits, than he has expressed in that concise satire. If you would avoid the contempt which never fails to attend a frivolous old age, you must pass a youth of diligence and application.</P>
<P>But then the pleasures resulting from it surpass description; the satisfactions of a rich cultivated mind are only fully known to the happy possessor; one of them, we are assured, is a noble independence, which
<PB N="47" REF="022756_0051_0FBA5E573A7D86A8"/>
creates, if I may so speak, its own hap∣piness; is not indebted to dissipation, or the caprice of others; but can derive from itself exhaustless resources for solitude or society. Ordinary persons are obliged to fly from <HI>Ennui</HI> to the regions of amusement, but superior beings, who have traversed the fields of useful and polite knowledge, can from themselves select materials for the most exquisite enjoyment.</P>
<P>Do you think this an acquisition worth desiring—then never forget that it can be obtained only by diligence and active in∣dustry. Habits of indolence are destruc∣tive of every valuable attainment, and they are as much so of happiness, as they are known to be of virtue.</P>

<P>CULTIVATED minds have pleasures which surpas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the vulgar apprehension. They have their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> as well—for there is an evil peculiar to refined feeling, which the untaught rustic is happily ignorant of. This happens when refinement, or at least
<PB N="48" REF="022756_0052_0FBA5E58C4BDC690"/>
the affectation of it, is carried to such an extreme, that it degenerates into false de∣licacy. The symptoms of the malady are a kind of secret dissatisfaction with every thing—the common blessings of life are despised, as inadequate to the refinement of their ideas, and every petty slight aug∣mented by such a quickness of perception, as leads them to see affronts, when none perhaps have been intended. And this peevish irritable temper they are pleased to dignify with the name of sensibility, and pique themselves on a disposition that dis∣qualifies them for social virtue, or social happiness. What pity that a quality meant to heighten every real blessing, should be ascribed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mere chimera of a sickly brain! Never may you, my girls, by in∣dulging these fictitious feelings, refine away the felicity which a kind Providence scat∣ters in your path of life. Nourish in your bosoms humility and good-nature—these will teach you to make the best of your lot, whatever it be, and give a relish to every enjoyment—all is serene where they reside. Humility, by arrogating nothing to herself, remains unhurt at the superci∣lious scorn of ignorance or pride; and good-nature, by casting a veil over the
<PB N="49" REF="022756_0053_0FBA5E5A67AA8E68"/>
foibles of others, presents to our view the best side of this motley scene.</P>
<P>Without doubt, superior minds have a quicker sense of what is beautiful in nature, or desirable in life, than a peasant, whose ideas extend not beyond his daily occupa∣tions perhaps they feel more acutely the evils of their condition; yet the persons who suffer most by this affected sensibility are not they who have the greatest share of afflictive events, but the idly speculative, who being employed to no good purpose, have time to nourish those artificial feel∣ings which Nature knows nothing of.</P>
<P>Sensibility!—What is it?—Is it not that delicate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> natural and moral beauty, which the Creator has im∣planted in the soul to exalt its happiness, and awaken its noblest passions? How great∣ly, then do they err, who substitute in the room of this best gift of Heaven, that which is the very weakness of humanity, pride and peevishness!</P>
<P>It is paying a very poor compliment to literary pursuits, to suppose they are pro∣ductive of that softness which unfits the mind for enduring the common accidents of life. And those attainments are of lit∣tle value that serve no better purpose than
<PB N="50" REF="022756_0054_0FBA5E60203112D8"/>
to barb the arrows of misfortune with stings which the enlightened never feel. But probably they who dream of such ef∣fects are the superficial, who never dived beyond the surface of literature, and whose feeble intellects are unable to digest even the little they have imbibed.</P>
<P>If you have really made any advancement in mental improvement, it will invigorate the powers of the soul, and inspire her with that magnanimity which is certainly necessary to the happiness of a being, who is every moment exposed to sorrow and disappointment. Value not yourselves on any refinements that are short of this ef∣fect.</P>
<P>Some, I know, are even restrained from the exercise of benevolence by this affec∣tation of sensibility; their feelings are too tender to bear with scenes of distress, and too refined for the duties of social life; they therefore keep at an unfriendly dis∣tance from society, lest the ignorance or rudeness they there may meet with, should wound their excessive delicacy; but how is this obeying the injunction of the Apos∣tle, who exhorts us to be kindly affection∣ed one to another, bearing with each others infirmities?</P>

<P>I have often thought that the great prevalence of vice arises chiefly from a culpable weakness of temper—for there is nothing so amiable in it, that it should be followed for its own sake. It is the mere want of resolution that betrays such num∣bers into the dreadful abyss of sin and misery.</P>
<Q><L>The world's dread laugh</L>
<L>Scarce e'en the firm Philosopher can bear.</L></Q>
<P>But, in my opinion, he must be a poor philosopher who cannot, and would have made but a sorry figure in the Portico or Lyceum.</P>
<P>It is not meant to inculcate to you a boisterous, imperious carriage. May my girls possess every feminine grace and vir∣tue:
<PB N="52" REF="022756_0056_0FBA5E62823C4BD0"/>
but these cannot be supported with∣out some portion of resolution. There is a proper firmness, without which neither virtue, happiness, or dignity of charac∣ter, can be long maintained. Distrust those who extol the soft irresolution of the sex—it is the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock on which thousands of deluded females have been lost.</P>
<P>Be possessed of the true principles of honor and rectitude, and dare to adhere to them in spite of solicitation, or that still more powerful means of temptation, ridicule. Establish your opinions on truth and reason, and maintain them, when ne∣cessary, with firmness;—some people give up both their faith and their friends, for want of resolution to defend them—
<Q><L>Too weak to think, too indolent to choose.</L></Q></P>
<P>In business, and the affairs of life, a proper firmness is indispensably necessary. Those who can be influenced by every ad∣viser or intimidated at every appearance of difficulty, must of course be desultory and unsettled. They effect nothing of conse∣quence, because they know not how to persevere in any undertaking. Obstacles will attend the best concerted schemes, and mankind will ever think differently
<PB N="53" REF="022756_0057_0FBA5E66C6F70138"/>
about them; but the truly wise will await with steady patience the issue of those measures they have been careful to found in prudence and the moral fitness of things. Some will undertake nothing, till they see the path smooth before them, and attain almost a certainly of success. Such will find their lives waste, before they have deter∣mined on the plan of it. Those who best know the state of humanity, will be con∣vinced, that to design prudently and act firmly, is all that can be done by mortals.</P>
<P>Without resolution, it will sometimes be impossible to act agreeably to the dic∣tates of right reason, and virtue; for these are not always the <HI>ton;</HI> and when that is the case, no inconsiderable share of forti∣tude is requisite to repel the attacks of ri∣dicule or amusement—nor can the treasures of knowledge be explored, without a por∣tion of it—for "there is nothing truly va∣luable to be attained without pains and labour." Dismayed at the prospect, the indolent, as described by Solomon, cry, "a lio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is in the street."—Rather may my dear girls be animated with a noble ar∣dour, to surmount every difficulty which would retard their acquisition of merit and felicity. Parnassus itself was a craggy
<PB N="54" REF="022756_0058_0FBA5E69E50D3AC0"/>
rock, but then the Muses dwelt on its top.</P>
<P>But if resolution be necessary to the at∣taining whatever is valuable or desirable in life, it is no less so to the supporting us under a deprivation of it. The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong—hence it follows, that the wisest measures do not always meet with success, nor can virtue itself prevent the encroachments of affliction—in such circumstances fortitude gives a dignity to suffering, and tends also to alleviate the weight of it. Every one knows the sentiment of the Philosopher—<Q>that a good man struggling with adver∣sity, is a sight on which the Gods them∣selves might look down with delight.</Q> However that be, it is certain that such a character never fails to command the re∣spect and veneration of mankind. Mag∣nanimity, of all the qualities of the mind, seems most secure of admiration. The Saviour of the world inculcated it, when having forewarned his disciples of their ap∣proaching sufferings, he enjoined them to possess their souls in patience. Patience is amongst the Christian duties, what mag∣nanimity is in the list of heroic virtues. They are synonymous terms—both imply that calm, unshaken fortitude, which is at
<PB N="55" REF="022756_0059_0FBA5E6AB6756BE8"/>
once characteristic of the hero and the Christian.</P>
<P>But do not conclude this firmness of mind—this laudable resolution, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> calculated only to be admired. It is of the highest actual service to the unfortunate, not only by enabling them to sustain the burden of their sufferings, but by opening a way to better prospects. The timid and irresolute sink, at the approach of adversity, into a despondency the most unfriendly to their affairs, by precluding that courageous in∣dustry which might render them more to∣lerable; and therefore, by the nature of things, augment the very evils of which they complain.</P>
<P>Cultivate in all circumstances this innate constancy—it will aid you in the attain∣ment of every good and valuable end,—in prosperity, will secure you from the cor∣ruptions of vanity,—impart dignity and serenity to adversity. In fine, you cannot, I think, but be steady in the practice of virtue, if you are firm in the expectation of its rewards.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>MY epistles to you, my dear girls, are written without the least attention to method; their respective subjects have more the appearance of chance, than de∣sign; and therefore, may be justly called cursory thoughts on various subjects. Young folks, I know, do not love precise rules, and perhaps you deem the irregularity of my letters their chief merit. Allow them, however, one more—that of sincerity: and believe that the sentiments they contain, flow from the heart; I believe, I need not add the word <HI>spontaneously.</HI></P>
<P>As I disclaim all methodical arrangement of my subjects, I will here give you my thoughts on that very important part of female study, dress. Be not afraid that I am about to confine you to a primitive plainness, though probably, such a mode may be found more advantageous to beauty and elegance, than modern finery; yet I shall recommend that which is at once agreeable to fashion, and your own rank and circumstances. To reconcile these
<PB N="57" REF="022756_0061_0FBA5E6DC2D910A0"/>
three conditions, is no easy task, yet herein lies a chief perfection of the female cha∣racter; few women possess the happy art;—yet those who do, must be allowed a very superior degree of merit. It is no inconsi∣derable trait in the character of an amiable young lady, that she knows how to support a genteel appearance; and yet pay a just regard to the frugality, which probably her limited circumstances require.</P>
<P>A fantastical and expensive turn in dress, is the certain mark of a little mind; but that attention to it, which principally re∣gards neatness, is undoubtedly extremely laudable. Resolve to be always neat, or you can never be well-dressed;—a dirty ruffle, a torn apron, &amp;c. are sufficient to disgrace the most splendid apparel. Neat∣ness is always within your power, and will always render you respectable in whatever rank of life you are placed; but finery, without it, is nothing more than a ridicu∣lous glare, which is never seen but with disgust.</P>
<P>Fashion has imposed some general rules, which may innocently be followed under the restrictions I have mentioned. Your clothes may be made according to the mode, though the materials which compose
<PB N="58" REF="022756_0062_0FBA5E2B231F6CB0"/>
them, be less costly than if they belonged to a Dutchess. An uncouth, ill-fashioned habit, derogates even from the importance of a philosopher; and it is not till after a near acquaintance, that merit is discovered through a shabby garment—so much are mankind governed by appearance.</P>
<P>"Prithee good Xenocrates (said Plato to his pupil) sacrifice to the graces." That great man knew how much the mental ac∣complishments might be illustrated and adorned by a polished exterior;—a wise person, it is true, would not make this al∣together the criterion of merit, yet perhaps, would not readily look for worth beneath an ungraceful exterior.</P>
<P>After all, my dear girls, esteem the fri∣volous, though often troublesome arts of dress, but as a tax you are in some sort obliged to pay to the folly of the age. Remember on all occasions, that external ornaments cannot make you better or hap∣pier women. Great minds, however they may have judged it necessary to conform to insignificant customs, have always regarded them in their proper light. The attention such are seen to show to the idol fashion, is only a good natured condescension to the weakness of mankind, in points they judge of an indifferent nature, and much too tri∣fling
<PB N="59" REF="022756_0063_0FBA5E6F88814AB8"/>
to become the objects of their serious cares. The silly and ignorant are they who love dress for its own sake.</P>

<P>NEXT to our own principles, we are to regard those of our companions; for they are almost of as much importance to us, as by long and intimate acquain∣tance they generally become our own. Virtuous habits are strengthened by ex∣ample—so are vicious ones, but in a much higher degree; nothing therefore can be a point of greater consequence than the choice of companions.</P>
<P>A great deal has been written on the subject, and every one who has the care of youth, fails not to inculcate the keep∣ing good company;—the only misfortune is, that the term has seldom been suffici∣ently explained, and the young mind is left to annex to it the ideas of birth and fortune, till by degrees the expression is supposed to imply both these qualifications.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="022756_0064_0FBA5E70C0AFDB88"/>
The result has been the disturban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> all order in social life;—each class of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> quitting their own sphere to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with those of superior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> again, inspired by the same sentiment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> with scorn the ambitious attempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> only to attract the notice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greater folks than themselves. Thus in the room of that social amity with which the human heart should overflow, it is un∣happily divided between the throbbings of ambition, and the pangs of offended pride.</P>
<P>It is evident, that in this bustle, greater attention is paid to the accidental circum∣stances of rank and affluence, than to real merit; we should not else so often see peo∣ple of the middling rank, when flattered by the notice of a superior, so elated with the honor of keeping, what they call good company; when perhaps, that superior is conspicuous for almost every vice and meanness. This is a grand mistake surely—as fatal to happiness as to morals.</P>
<P>Good company can only mean persons of noble sentiments, refined manners, and enlightened understandings. But these qualities are not to be expected, where the scantiness of fortune has absolutely exclud∣ed the means of education; for the human
<PB N="61" REF="022756_0065_0FBA5E7230FD5DD8"/>
mind becomes every thing by culture. It is therefore found, that in the lower ranks of society, where poverty has denied time and abilities for that happy employ, the worst habits, and most depraved morals prevail; for this reason you are not to choose companions from such a class.</P>
<P>In fine, your associates must be those of a liberal and virtuous education. It may happen you may find a friend of this de∣sciption, whose relative or necessary con∣nections may not be eligible for you. In this case she is by no means a proper com∣panion, as her own merit, however great, will not compensate for the danger you in∣cur in frequently mingling with persons of improper character.</P>
<P>A cultivated mind is the proper soil for every moral and social virtue—it is most likely to be found where Heaven has be∣stowed an easy fortune, consequently the genteeler ranks of life will be most likely to afford you proper companions. But here let merit alone, and not adventitious cir∣cumstances, influence your selection—de∣spise that contemptible weakness which piques itself on the rank, rather than the mental value of an acquaintance; and ne∣ver let a principle of vanity lead you to
<PB N="62" REF="022756_0066_0FBA5E2C7638CC60"/>
the servile imitation of vice or folly, how∣ever sanctioned by wealth or titles. Little minds are ever dazzled by show and splen∣dour—it is the property of the enlight∣ened only to distinguish personal worth from external advantages. I should think you disgraced by an acquaintance with an empress, if she was not as much distin∣guished by virtue as power.</P>
<P>Be careful not to form an acquaintance too hastily—many a virtuous girl has sunk for ever in the esteem of the world, by being seen in company with those of doubt∣ful reputation. In vain she declares her ignorance of the real character of her com∣panions. She having admitted them to her society, without the requisite investi∣gation of that point, infallibly renders her own prudence suspected.</P>
<P>A very extensive acquaintance is not ne∣cessary to social happiness. A few select friends will most conduce to that end; and it is among these, that 
<Q> The free full converse of the friendly heart</Q>
flows with uninterrupted delight—un∣feigned cheerfulness and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> enjoyment ex∣ist much oftener in these little circles, than
<PB N="63" REF="022756_0067_0FBA5E740086D788"/>
in large and ceremonious assemblies. But should your station in life render <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> large acquaintance unavoidable, you will observe to all, a free unrestrained politeness, with∣out admitting every one indiscriminately to your confidence. Be ever frank and easy, without revealing your own secrets, or those of your friends, and make none your intimates, but those of worth and honor.</P>
<P>Much, very much of human happiness depends on the proper choice of acquaint∣ance—an ill-chosen friend has power to mar our felicity as much as an amiable and faithful one contributes to it. The heart is formed for social intercourse; and when that intercourse is founded on the moral and religious virtues, it gives a zest to the other enjoyments of life.</P>

<P>THERE are certain restrictions ne∣cessary to render the gift of speech what the great Creator designed it—a
<PB N="64" REF="022756_0068_0FBA5E78B529B208"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> means of happiness to his rati∣onal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The first of these is an habitual care never to violate the laws of truth. The pleasures resulting from mu∣tual conversation vanish entirely, when no dependance can be placed in the speaker's veracity. Those who speak merely from the suggestions of imagination, or, what is worse, malignity, are justly chargeable with half the strife that disturbs the peace of society. Such persons are the most dangerous companions, and need only be known to be generally despised and avoided. Indeed so high a regard veracity obtains among people of refinement, that you can∣not offer a more gross affront than to ac∣cuse them of the violation of it.</P>
<P>Of all that has been said in admiration of Cato's character, nothing reflects so great a lustre on it, as that striking, though tacit eulogium, bestowed on him in one of the Roman courts of judicature, where a cause being to be tried which required two witnesses, and one only appearing, the judge declared he could not dispense with the law, even <HI>though Cato himself were the witness.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, as Archbishop Tillotson finely observes, a constant adherence to truth has
<PB N="65" REF="022756_0069_0FBA5E7A8173E708"/>
the least trouble and difficulty in it, it sits always upon the lips; whereas a lie is troublesome, and needs a great many more to make it good.</P>
<P>Next to the character of a liar, that of the detractor is the most odious—a habit of traducing the reputation of others, by speaking all the ill we have heard of them, or putting the worst constructions on their actions, is totally opposite to the spirit of Christianity, which breathes nothing but candour and charity. There is also some∣thing extremely mean in the practice, as the accused persons have seldom an oppor∣tunity of refuting the charge. The cruel aspersion is borne on the wings of scandal from circle to circle, nor perhaps reaches the injured party till the wound given to his reputation is too deep for cure.</P>
<P>Barbarous as such a custom is, I need not say how greatly it prevails in almost all companies. I have, however, the charity to believe it does not always proceed from malice or envy. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> no knowledge has been treasured up in the mind—no useful information acquired, conversation cannot receive aid from intellectual stores—what then, must become of it?—must it flag, and silence—dreadful silence reign?—No,
<PB N="66" REF="022756_0070_0FBA5E2E4D6B16D0"/>
something must re-kindle it; and when no rational subject arises, that something must be scandal. This, though it may may be a palliation of the crime, is yet no excuse; for the wounds given by unmeaning igno∣rance are as deep as those inflicted by pre∣meditated rancour. How shameful is it that an impertinent eagerness for talking should thus wantonly explore the secret re∣cesses of domestic life, and presume to judge of actions, the motives of which cannot be scanned by these ignorant prat∣tlers!</P>
<P>The most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ectual way to secure your∣selves from the commission of this vice, will be the adorning your minds with such acquisitions of knowledge, and useful intelligence, as will enable you to furnish subjects for conversation, without descend∣ing to frivolity or detraction. But should you not be so happy as to possess these de∣sirable resources, I hope you will have so much candour and good-nature, as to be content with being accounted dull and lifeless companions, rather than indulge an eagerness for talking at the expense of other people's good name.</P>
<P>Detraction is not only a violation of the rules of religion, but it is also so impolitic
<PB N="67" REF="022756_0071_0FBA5E7C033DC5E0"/>
a crime, as no one who wishes to be well received in the world would ever commit;—for a person who is addicted to scandal, is a terror to society; the respect he re∣ceives, resembles the homage the Indians are said to pay to the Devil, rather to evade his malignity, than to procure his love. And however curiosity may, for a while, listen to an ill-natured anecdote, yet, be assured, the relator is regarded with a secret disgust by every benevolent person, who naturally expects to meet the same cen∣sorious fate, when opportunity serves.</P>
<P>Good policy will therefore correct a cen∣sorious disposition; yet, I trust, your re∣straint will be derived from a superior mo∣tive, namely, the obligations of religion, which forbid to speak evil of any, or to judge uncharitably of another. The con∣sciousness of having always obeyed these divine injunctions, will afford the best con∣solation, under the pain you may perhaps feel from the unjust aspersions of others—for such, probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will meet with in your journey of life, as no innocence can always be a defence from unmerited cen∣sure; and when this chances to be your case, you will derive unspeakable comfort, from the reflection of having treated the
<PB N="68" REF="022756_0072_0FBA5E7D999466A0"/>
world more generously than it has treated you.</P>
<P>Whatever you say, should be meant for the entertainment or instruction of the company, rather than the gratification of vanity. Many are so much actuated by self-love, that they never speak or act, but to be applauded. Hence arises affectation—the most disgusting quality in nature. Deliver your sentiments as they occur, without affecting more graces in your tone or gestures than are your own—these, well managed, will be enough to render you amiable. All may be agreeable in their natural sphere, but when they innovate on that of others, the attempt is commonly frustrated.</P>
<P>Above all, never affect that kind of wit which aims at severe retorts and repartee—it has generally ill-nature for its basis, and seldom makes a sally but it procures an ene∣my, if it does not lose a friend. There is nothing in it to be admired but the readiness of thought, which gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts birth—but when the quality seems <HI>aimed</HI> at, rather than <HI>pos∣sessed,</HI> it is absolutely contemptible.</P>
<P>In fine—sincerity, candour, and good sense, must be the ornaments of your con∣versation. Politeness will give an agreea∣ble

<P>"HAIL politeness, power divine!" says the sonnet, and surely no unnecessary invocation; for politeness, dear girls, is the friend of social happiness and domestic peace; if it was the fashion, in this age, to have household gods, I would surely give it a pre-eminent place amongst them.</P>

<PB N="70" REF="022756_0074_0FBA5E7EF54ACE98"/>
flowing through all the minutiae of human life. Education may improve, but can ne∣ver give it, for it must be founded in the soul, or is never seen in full perfection. A painter may learn the rules of design, and the compendium of colours; but if he pos∣sesses not the enthusiasm of the art, his pictures will be lifeless and insipid.</P>
<P>Politeness is that amiable disposition, which delights in the happiness of others—consults their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase—prevents their wants—and yields them every possible convenience. This is the source of those civilities and at∣tentions, which distinguish a well bred per∣son—without it, etiquette dwindles to un∣meaning ceremony.</P>
<P>You perceive then, that not only an at∣tention to external graces, but a regulation of the disposition is necessary to constitute a polite person. Acquire the amiable tem∣per I have described, and you will infalli∣bly please with that native <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase which is thought so requisite to be attained, that the world has substituted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its room its wretch∣ed resemblance, effrontery;—but no more like the amiable original, than an ordinary statue to the Venus of Medicis.</P>

person. This is an assertion you have not been used to hear, yet may well enough be warranted by the tenor of the gospel pre∣cepts, which inculcate the being tender of another's weakness—to prefer each other in honor—to give respect where due—with others to the like purpose. Now if these excellent lessons contain (as I think will be allowed) the substance of what, at this day, is termed good breeding, St. Paul must be a better teacher than my Lord Chesterfield himself, since he breathes the enlivening spirit, without which the cere∣monial code is a lifeless system, calculated perhaps to disguise the heart, but not to add one iota to the real happiness of social life.—</P>

<P>NOTHING is more talked of than religion—nothing less understood. Without comprehending what it really is, the spirit of bigotry would arrogate the
<PB N="72" REF="022756_0076_0FBA5E81F707E018"/>
whole, nor allow of its being without the contracted pale of a particular sect.</P>
<P>I have juster notions of religion—see it as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s—not a mode of ceremonies, but a divine principle influencing the whole moral conduct; its simple, fixed and determinate sense, is briefly love of God, and good will to mankind. This, dear girls, is the sum of all religion; without it, vain were the oblations of the Jewish church—vain are the ceremonials of the Christian.</P>
<P>The "love of God," is an expression, that of late years has been as grossly abus∣ed, as the word religion. Strange as it may appear, there have been those, who leading the most immoral lives, have styled themselves lovers of the God of purity—whose tongues could utter a pious ejacula∣tion, while their hands were committing the most flagitious crimes. But be not deceived—this exalted character belongs neither to bigotry nor enthusiasm. The love of God is not a passion, but a rational principle; it is those sentiments of reverence and gra∣titude, which naturally arise in a generous mind▪ when reflecting on one supreme bene∣ficent power, who is the immediate author of all good, and the fountain of all per∣fection. This conviction is the parent of
<PB N="73" REF="022756_0077_0FBA5E83802ECC78"/>
unaffected piety; the soul cannot but adore the Being she believes to be all wise, all mighty, and eternal;—she cannot but love him who is the source of unnumbered blessings;—nor choose, but dread to offend him whose nature she believes to be holiness. Hence the source of moral virtue—sin is avoided, because displeasing to the will of the Deity; and virtuous are dispositions are acquired, because agreeable to a power who is able to reward every endeavour to please him, with eternal and unspeakable happi∣ness.</P>
<P>Such a filial rational lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, must be the fruit of every mind that is not ignorant of the be∣ing and attributes of God;—or that has not received from bigotry or superstition, any mistaken notions of him. To prevent be∣ing disturbed by the spiritual pride of hy∣pocritical fanatics, remember there is an invariable test by which you may know if you have the love of God. Ask your own heart, if it seeks the favour of the Deity above every other consideration? if it va∣lues this more than its dearest interests, and even life itself, a ready affirmative puts the question out of all doubt.</P>
<P>I have been always of opinion, that re∣ligion owes the abuses that have been put
<PB N="74" REF="022756_0078_0FBA5E8586F1C178"/>
on her, more to the weakness than the knavery of mankind; perhaps it would be no hard task to prove, that all the absurd doctrines which at this day disgrace her in certain sects, originated with persons, the warmth of whose imagination exceeded the strength of their understanding; but waving whatever tends to controversy, I shall only hint that the practice of piety has received considerable injury by devotees of the above-mentioned class. Forgetful of what was just now advanced, that reli∣gion is not a passion, but a principle, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se people have made it all consist in incoherent rhapsodies, and senseless jargon of devout impulses—holy consolations, and such like, which I believe they are more indebted for to particular tempers and constitutions than any revolution of divine favour. Per∣sons of solid sense, have with reason been disgusted at this affected piety—but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world loves to run into extremes, and therefore it happens, that because the cant of hypocrisy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, has been judg∣ed injurious to the dignity of religion—modern manners disclaim any acquaintance with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>But be assured, my dear girls, that no∣thing so highly elevates and adorns the hu∣man
<PB N="75" REF="022756_0079_0FBA5E88C9CB5300"/>
character, as a steady rational piety—nor is any thing capable of yielding so pure and exalted a happiness to the soul, as an habit of devotion. No one who has expe∣rienced the vicissitude of sublunary things, but must highly value the privilege of pos∣sessing a friend that would at all times be acceptable—ready to hear the complaints of affliction, and all powerful to relieve them.</P>
<P>Such a friend you may enjoy in the Di∣vine Being; of what consequence is it then that you acquire a taste for the exercises of devotion;—that you cultivate a friendship with Heaven, and accustom your hearts to to talk with God! This is an emphatical expression of David, and gives you an idea of rational and sincere prayer—which con∣sists not in formal addresses, but is the genuine language of the heart. Such a divine intima∣cy, has something in it extremely suitable to the noblest sensations of the soul; and therefore may well be sought after as a source of refined and exquisite felicity. In trou∣ble you will find it more precious than the balm of Gilead—it will shed a ray of sa∣cred peace, when the dark clouds of adver∣sity obscure your path—in death. But here my pen must s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op—there can be no

<P>THE generality of people style them∣selves christians, without understand∣ing the value or the necessity of christianity; and perhaps, neither the one or the other, can be seen in a proper light, without tak∣ing a comparative view of the human soul before and after the fall.</P>
<P>It is not for my humble pen to illustrate the excellency of a system which has God himself for its author—nor is it my design to attempt a task so far above my abilities; yet that you may not wholly take your re∣ligion upon trust, I would call your atten∣tion to what man was when first created.</P>
<P>But a little inferior to angels—his reason was clear, his soul all purity, and his mind all intelligence—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it companion for natures wholly spiritual, and enjoying the most fa∣miliar

intercourse with them. That grand question which has since agitated the schools of philosophy, of what was the chief good of man, was all apparent to the first of the human race:—he saw perfectly clear, that it consisted in the entire assimilation of his will to that of the Deity—and in the pur∣suit found a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll unmixed felicity. But he was created with the power of doing other∣wise, or where would have been the merit of obedience? The duty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> agency, must be far preferable to that which arises from blind necessity.</P>
<P>Adam continued a happy being as long as his will remained consonant to that of his Maker; but at the instant it deviated therefrom, her fell from happiness and per∣fection. The conciseness of the scripture history, leaves unthinking minds in doubt as to the nature of Adam's transgression, but undoubtedly it originated in the mere desire of doing contrary to the divine com∣mand;—he forgot that the Deity was his happiness, and he sought it in his own will. It was herein he sinned, and not simply by eating the forbidden fruit, for at the very moment Adam be∣came capable of imagining there might be
<PB N="78" REF="022756_0082_0FBA5ED28D357070"/>
a good abstract from the favour of God—that moment he fell.</P>
<P>The Creator saw at one comprehensive view, the miseries which would accrue to mankind, from the voluntary perversion of the intellectual and moral powers;—then was the scheme of Christianity devised, as an effectual means of restoring human na∣ture to the happiness and perfection it ori∣ginally possessed.—The purposed blessing was graciously announced in that prediction, that the posterity of Eve should crush the serpent's head.</P>
<P>The human reason thus clouded, it is al∣most surprising to reflect by what rapid steps the world bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me immersed in the worst of ignorance and vice. Those who still retained some idea of the Sovereign Creator, had recourse to a visible symbol of his Majesty; for their intellectual fa∣culties were too gross to apprehend an im∣material Deity—it soon happened that the symbol itself was made the object of divine worship; and hence, doubtless, the origin of idolatry, which in the time of Abra∣ham had so generally spread over the earth, that it appeared necessary to the Supreme Governor of the Universe to call that good man from his country and his kindred to
<PB N="79" REF="022756_0083_0FBA5ED56A6F28C0"/>
ordain him the father of a nation; who being by numerous and peculiar laws, se∣parated from the rest of the world, might preserve, uncorrupt the knowledge of the Divine Nature. The Bible will convince you how ineffectual, not only these laws, but the frequent and signal manifestations of Almighty Power were to secure that people from the grossest idolatry, the rites of which were now become so terrible to the imagination, that they even burnt their children alive, in sacrifices to their horrid idols.</P>
<P>What a picture is here of human nature! that nature which once so nearly approach∣ed the angelic! Do you not begin to see the necessity of a Redeemer? Let us pur∣sue the thread of history, and take a super∣ficial view of the most celebrated nations which peopled the earth before the glorious aera of his appearance.</P>
<P>The Egyptians were very early esteem∣ed for learning, laws and arts—they were a numerous, powerful, and wealthy people, but so grossly idolatrous, that they not only worshipped images, but beasts, in∣sects, and even vegetables. The manufac∣tures and extensive commerce of Phoenicia, suppose some advance in refinement—but
<PB N="80" REF="022756_0084_0FBA5ED6F8103410"/>
national intercourse in those wretched times served but to promulgate national idola∣tries. Babylon, that mighty seat of empire, surpassed most other nations in the superb materials of her Gods. Astronomers there observed the motions of the Heavens, and bowed in adoration to the splendid hosts that adorned them. Cyrus, who erected the Persian on the ruins of the Babylonish Monarchy, knew nothing of the Almighty Being, who named him, an age before he had existence, as the instrument of liberty to his captive people. Alexander, who in his turn subverted this extensive empire, could only blend his Grecian idols with the Persian—for dark, deplorably dark, was every corner of the habitable earth, except the inconsiderable land of Judea, where only a few despised, enfeebled tribes, pos∣sessed the light of sacred knowledge.</P>
<P>What a spectacle for the Father of the Universe! who produced a world to know him and be happy! How much must his divine compassion be excited, on contem∣plating his glorious work in ruins!—to re∣deem it was an effort worthy of himself.</P>
<P>We now come to the enlighted ages of Greece and Rome—a period when I fancy I see the human soul like a brilliant gem,
<PB N="81" REF="022756_0085_0FBA5EDA28ABF8D8"/>
illustrious in the dust. What noble strug∣gles did then the human reason make to free itself from the incumbent load of dark∣ness and error! Then lived those numerous worthies, whose names are yet precious to posterity. What greatness of soul—what a taste for solid glory—what elevated sen∣timents did they not discover? Yet these men, so far superior to the rest of their species, acknowledged a multiplicity of Deities, whose moral characters were in∣finitely inferior to their own, and to whom they scrupled not to ascribe actions which themselves would have blushed to acknow∣ledge. Every passion of the human mind was personified, and deified; statues gra∣ced every corner of their streets. Yet were there not wanting some among them who made bold advances in search of better in∣formation—like benighted travellers they followed the most distant gleam of light, yet all they could obtain was doubt and obscurity.</P>
<P>At th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> period, when reason had done all it could do to regain its native rights and privileges—the Saviour of the world appeared, at whose sacred presence idolatry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, and the knowledge of the one true God began to enlighten mankind. They
<PB N="82" REF="022756_0086_0FBA5EDC14FFAFC8"/>
were no longer compelled to enquire "Where is God our Maker?" They knew him, and were instructed in his divine wor∣ship. The doctrines which the divine Messiah taught, eminently tended to restore human nature to the rectitude and happiness it had lost—they were calculated to harmo∣nize the passions—regulate the affections, and exalt the soul to a sense of her own dignity, by revealing, in the clearest terms, the immortality of her nature—a point which philosophy had long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought to explore through the dim veil of probable conjecture.</P>
<P>A cursory view of the tenets of Chris∣tianity is sufficient to evince, that they are designed to establish the happiness of man∣kind even in the present life. Consider the benevolence and charity they inculcate—the patience, meekness, moderation, con∣tempt of worldly pleasures and enjoyments, the generous clemency to enemies; with the rest of that bright assemblage of vir∣tues they enjoin, and you will confess it a matter of wonder that the felicity of Eden is not already restored to those countries where the religion of Christ is professed—and the reason it is not so can be no other than that of the thousands who daily mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

profession of it, so few have a competent knowledge of its nature and design. Born in a Christian land, they think such a scru∣tiny superfluous. Thus they call themselves Christians without having any thing of the spirit of Christ.—And thus the human race is still obnoxious to a thousand miseries, for want of applying to themselves the remedy which alone could put an end to moral evil.</P>
<P>May you, my dear girls, be effectually convinced of the inestimable value of this divine dispensation, and think with Dr. Young, that

<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>I Undertake this little work, under the supposition, that those for whose benefit I write it, have been well educated; if it shall fall into the hands of such as are unblessed with this advantage, I will still presume to hope, the counsels it contains, may in some degree correct, if not totally eradicate, such errors as are the fruits of early neglect. On the other hand those to whom their parents, guardians, or distant relations, shall have acquitted themselves of this first of impor∣tant duties, will find my precepts more easy to pursue. The subject has been so frequently and so ably treated. I am conscious that with inferior talents, it carries an appearance of temerity in me, to attempt to point out something new, in so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaten a path of instruction. But it is my intention to treat of such minute follies and blemishes, on the first entrance of young persons into the great and critical world, as are the less avoidable, as their consequences do not strike at first sight. There are, among these mistakes, (they do not all merit a sharper epithet) some so blended with engaging quali∣ties that they too often attract and dazzle the eyes of innocence, so as to excite a desire of imitation; and thus, by their pleasing, but false colours, insensibly prove dangerous and fatal examples. These maxims have been written at different periods, and were originally destined for the perusal of a few, either relations, or acquaintances, on whose indulgence I presumed to dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>▪ beyond that line they may appear frivolous, but experience and observation has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aught me, that every species of affectation, awkward habits, and even involuntary omissions, when cast up by the strict hand of censure and nice criticism, have so swelled the ac∣count, that persons guilty of no capital indiscretion, have been, in the decline of youth, and its attendant char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, treated with a severity unexpected by those accustomed to a lenity that beauty, prosperity, and fashion had obtained from the public.</P>

<P>HABITUATE yourself to that way of life, most agreeable to the person, to whom you are united; be content in re∣tirement, or with society, with the town, or the country.</P>

<P>Should he be neglectful of his family interests, supply his place with redoubled attention.</P>
<P>If public employment demand frequent absences from home, make his supposed in∣tentions there to be as much respected, as if he were present, by your own deference to them.</P>
<P>If the contagion of example gain too strong an empire over him, if misled by pleasures, or hurried by passion, let not your impatience prevent his return to rea∣son.</P>
<P>Let an early examination of his temper, prepare you to bear with inequalities, to which all are more or less subject.</P>
<P>Do not attempt to destroy his innocent pleasures, by pretexts of oeconomy; re∣trench rather your own expenses, to pro∣mote them.</P>

<P>Watch for, and profit of such moments of his leisure, as will allow him, without pain or chagrin, to redress them.</P>
<P>Let your attentions be so continued, ac∣companied by no affectation, yet so easy, as may prove they flow from the heart.</P>
<P>The least appearance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> min∣gled with assiduity, conveys a suspicion of interest.</P>
<P>If absolute necessity, or free choice, call him often from home, (suppose it to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> often) when he shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e visit that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make it so agreeable, that it shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquire the preference.</P>
<P>Show the greatest respect to his near re∣lations; observe a constant civility towards the more distant; let there be no ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d distinction between these, on either side, in your own breast; natural affection may, nay ought to prevail.</P>
<P>Should you be so unfortunate as to be connected with a family, divided by dissen∣tions, or of various tempers, by studying them early, you will distinguish such among them, as merit cultivation, and are open to friendship—you will consequently be ac∣quitted by the world, for want of success,
<PB N="90" REF="022756_0094_0FBA5EF34E1EEDE0"/>
with that part, to whom kindness would prove ineffectual.</P>
<P>During the education of men in schools, colleges, academies, friendships are form∣ed, perhaps too early sometimes to be ju∣dicious, but equally hard to dissolve:—if in consequence, you behold such with pain, do not attempt to break them with precipitation.</P>
<P>When a person shall see his friends coolly received in his own house, he will natural∣ly seek occasions to meet them abroad;—maintain therefore your interest with him, by a polite behaviour to those he so prefers, though you may not.</P>
<P>From the moment you shall have formed an indissoluble engagement, avoid every path which leads to jealousy; harbour not the dangerous guest with you; and, by every prudent caution, suffer it not to fix near you.</P>
<P>Unbounded demonstrations of tender∣ness, though authorized by sacred ties, are oft as productive of inconveniencies, as the most unwarrantable aversions.</P>
<P>Should you have too just cause for suspi∣cion of a change of affection, and its diver∣sion to another object, let a ready and obliging indulgence attempt the work of
<PB N="91" REF="022756_0095_0FBA5EF69C1B7AF8"/>
reformation;—it promises better success, than discontent and clamorous grief.</P>
<P>Jealously is oft ideal; it is capricious; its dictates inconsiderate; its suggestions fatal to mutual repose.</P>
<P>The allowed superiority of the other sex—the liberties of their education—de∣mand abundance of allowances from ours; if we aspire at esteem and influence.</P>
<P>It would be equally mean to dissemble in a manner, that could increase the con-contempt of those, who are the cruel cause of your sufferings, by hurting your fortune, or by bereaving you of a friend.</P>
<P>If you discover, on the other side, a disposition to this unhappy passion; treat the phantom as if it were a reality; try to remove the apparent cause, by every sacrifice in your power, were it even to ap∣pear ridiculous in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>The most dangerous position for a young person to be thrown into, is for the world to be apprized of her harsh treatment; it exposes her to every mode of seduction, that interested pity can devise; and re∣quires infinite virtue and fortitude, to guard her against its insinuations.</P>

<P>If a rooted aversion shall appear to be directed to any one object, abandon the connection with decency and good breed∣ing, in order that it may escape observati∣on; and, at the same time, exert all your endeavours, to erase that object from your own memory.</P>
<P>Should your union be attended with greater felicity th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n is the usual lot of our sex, govern your just affections to preserve it;—by too much anxiety, you may de∣stroy it.</P>
<P>It is natural, in our uncertain state, to dread th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the changes it is liable to; but our apprehensions, should be seldom repeat∣ed; as to easy natures it is painful, to a harsher turn importunate.</P>
<P>Sufficient are the real difficulties we have each to encounter, in the course of our lives; create none therefore; use your rea∣son in combating the former; and be si∣lent, if the weakness of your frame pre∣vents

<P>The satisfaction of those on whom you depend, requires now and then some de∣gree of self-denial in you;—amongst the happiest connexions, there will be diversity of opinions; and it has of old been de∣creed, that those of the female part of the creation should give way to their su∣periors.</P>
<P>Whatever dissentions may arise, how much soever your conduct and understand∣ing may justify the part you take in them, suffer the interference of no third person, especially if you suppose their partiality would lead them to decide in your favour.</P>
<P>Do not permit your nearest intimates to disturb your peace at home, by oblique

<P>Female friendships are but too frequent∣ly bars to domestic peace; they are more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the communication of mutual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the desire of amending them.</P>

<P>In making a just estimation of the ex∣treme value, and extensive duties, the sa∣cred name of friendship demands, you will not too precipitately embark in such an en∣gagement.</P>
<P>The friendships between two very young women; early produced in the theatre of the great world, and both equally engaged in all the frivolities of fashion, are usually but slightly cemented, and they are as briefly dissolved.</P>
<P>In the choice of a friend, prefer a per∣son less young than yourself;—her expe∣rience will supply your ignorance, and a single word of seasonable advice, skreen you from the blame of multitudes.</P>
<P>If your friendship can hold good against

the superiority of beauty and talents, that friendship will deserve its name.</P>
<P>Suffer not any, unauthorized by affinity, to be frequently repeating the criticisms of the world on your conduct;—on trifling occasions it is seldom corrective, but it ne∣ver fails to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our the temper.</P>
<P>There are but too many, who seek ra∣ther to gratify their own malignity, under the cloak of friendship, by the circulation of sarcasm, than to operate your reforma∣tion.</P>
<P>Be, on your side, as little liberal of your counsels, as you are patient in receiving them.</P>
<P>But if convinced, that, to impart your opinion is to save your friend, set complai∣sance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interest, and policy aside; your im∣partiality will ensure success.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> confidences are, in general, better avoided; but if you be entrusted with important secrets, endure every re∣proach, even the world's censure, rather than reveal them.</P>
<P>Various are the artifices, employed, for the gratification of curiosity, against the young and unguarded, according to the dispositions; the pride of some, the ge∣nerosity of others, is worked on; and

<P>Listen neither to the suggestions of pleasure nor interest, where the felicity or security of a friend is concerned.</P>
<P>There are favorable moments, that active friendship may seize, which present them∣selves in the course of almost every one's life, never to be recovered, if once lost sight of.</P>
<P>Half the worthy intentions, flowing from a good but unexperienced heart, are ren∣dered ineffectual by procrastination, or the interposition of alluring trifles.</P>
<P>Do not say to yourself, 'I write to-mor∣row; I will even supplicate the next week in behalf of a friend;' if you can actually and usefully employ the present hour in the same service.</P>
<P>If, from your situation in life, you are destined to pass it among those who are cal∣led fashionable, <HI>bon ton,</HI> &amp;c. arm yourself with a strong preparation of reason and re∣solution.</P>
<P>Adopt as few as possible of the modish follies this state will expose you to.</P>

<P>It is almost impossible to escape the influ∣ence of some prejudices, from the continu∣al adherence to the same society:—such have a mutual interest in defending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> failings;—it were therefore safer to be more diffusive, perhaps to be less pleased, but certainly less calumniated.</P>
<P>It is more advantageous to live with our superiors or equals, than with those of an inferior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it being less the interest of such to flatter our foibles.</P>
<P>Let no such expression fall from your lips, as <HI>low company, no body,</HI> because your rank in life may separate you in general from society of lower degree, but perhaps possessing superior merit to that you are connected with</P>
<P>Be extremely cautious in the choice of those who are to be your attendants. Let none in your service be permitted a levity or licentiousness of behaviour, however in∣sinuating in speech.</P>
<P>Shut your ears against every prejudice,

which the long services of persons about you may encourage them to attempt inspiring you with.</P>
<P>Do not suffer your partiality to one do∣mestic to occasion a harsh treatment of the rest. We daily experience, that the want of education, among those even in your own sphere, is productive of numberless errors; it will of course be our own fault, if we de∣legate too much power to such as have not judgment to use it.</P>
<P>Rule, as far as you are able, with an even hand; and steer between pride and famili∣arity.</P>
<P>Let our own example discountenance small irregularities, that they may not aug∣ment.</P>
<P>Treat no kind of misconduct among your friends with indifference, much less with mirth or applause, in the hearing of your servants; as they will not fail to take an advantage of it at some moment or other.</P>
<P>Scorn to employ them, at any juncture, in mean researches for the gratification of your curiosity:—it will entitle them to in∣dulge their own at your expense. Teach them, by your own steady adherence to truth, and a becoming abhorrence of the

least deviation from it, a strict observance of its dictates.</P>
<P>On the first discovery of a fault, obstruct not a free confession of it, by excessive se∣verity.</P>
<P>Prevent your servants from interfering with or revealing the embroilments in other families.</P>
<P>Wherever your influence shall be establish∣ed, let not a word or look contribute to the distress or disgrace of dependent persons: save them, if your humane interposition can effect a work of such justice.</P>
<P>Incline ever to the merciful side, in re∣proof or condemnation of your domestics: if the offender shall be lost to repentance, afterwards you will have nothing to re∣proach yourself with.</P>
<P>There are moments of uneasiness, from which none on earth can always be exempt; but let it not fall, in sallies of peevishness, on your servants.</P>
<P>If hurried, by a natural harshness of temper, into some sudden passionate expres∣sion, be not ashamed, on due reflection, to apologize for it:—few minds are so base, as not to feel the condescension.</P>
<P>It is a justifiable pride, if any may be deemed such, to conceal our joys or our
<PB N="100" REF="022756_0104_0FBA5F095F0D10F0"/>
sorrows from those who are incapable of un∣derstanding their causes.</P>
<P>Allow your servants certain hours of in∣nocent relaxation, when their daily task is well performed.</P>
<P>Rigorously correct all propensity to gam∣ing; but, to enforce the precept, observe it yourself.</P>
<P>Furnish them with a constant series of oc∣cupation; pay their acquirement of a use∣ful talent, if you shall perceive their dispo∣sition towards learning; if inclined to read, give them books adapted to their capacity; and prohibit such as may endanger their principles.</P>
<P>Take care that they diligently perform their religious duties, even if of a different persuasion from your own. It is impossible that those, who neglect the first of all ser∣vices, should serve you well.</P>
<P>Take tender care of them in sickness: give them suitable consolation in distress; and, at such periods, put away the superior, to assume the Christian alone.</P>
<P>Demonstrate, by the justice of your or∣ders, your perfect knowledge of all that concerns your family affairs.</P>
<P>You will in no wise demean yourself by
<PB N="101" REF="022756_0105_0FBA5F0A847EB9F0"/>
examining minutely into all the detail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of your household at proper seasons.</P>
<P>Your sudden and unexpected appearance will awaken that diligence among your ser∣vants, which too frequent and familiar com∣munication will lay asleep.</P>
<P>Inspections, diligently and judiciously made, will maintain probity among your agents; but a suspicious temper will only encourage hypocrisy, and teach craft and treachery.</P>
<P>Conceal, from the indifferent spectator, the secret springs, which move, regulate, and perfect the arrangements of your house∣hold.</P>
<P>A good manager and a notable woman proves but too often to be a very unpleasant being in society. These duties should be performed in the circle of their own domes∣tic sphere, and are never to be boasted of out of it.</P>
<P>If your fortune be moderate, oeconomy is absolutely necessary: if considerable, me∣thod and prudence will render it doubly beneficial.</P>
<P>Observe the utmost regularity in the keeping of your household accounts:—it is tranquillity to you, and justice to your dependants.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="022756_0106_0FBA5F0DA14B0688"/>
Young persons, unacquainted with the vicissitudes of fortune, live mostly accord∣ing to the nominal, not the effective value of their estates. But those, who allow themselves hours of reflection, must expect changes, and prepare for accidents.</P>
<P>Suffer not avaricious principles to deceive you in the shape of oeconomy, nor a desire of augmenting your fortune to render you oppressive.</P>
<P>Exert the powers of persuasion on the person you depend on, to make those, who depend on you, happy.</P>
<P>By examples of pity in your own breast, prevent and discourage the unfeeling tho' warranted pursuits of rapacious emissaries in collecting your due from your estate.</P>
<P>If, in order to live yourself, you are com∣pelled to trouble the existence of others, endeavor, by some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of lenity and charity, to compensate for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir present distress.</P>
<P>The luxury of this age exacts from the mistress of a great house, or indeed a small∣er, some attention to a table. Disdain not therefore to give a proper application to that study.</P>
<P>Neatness and elegance should be joined to each other:—ostentation and profusion are in general equally united, and equally to be avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="022756_0107_0FBA5F0F693A90C0"/>
Those, who suddenly arrive at affluence in dependent stations, are subject to neglect the interests of their superiors.</P>
<P>The pretext of doing you honor is the common excuse for extravagance, among such as are attached to you only from mo∣tives of interest.</P>
<P>Superfluities in a great family, well di∣rected, would save a multitude of objects from distress:—devote them therefore only to that worthy purpose.</P>
<P>Let your attention at your table <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> uni∣versal; nor sit down to it, like a manger, yourself.</P>
<P>There should be no marked preferences shown, where popularity may essentially contribute to the welfare of a family.</P>
<P>It is not hypocrisy, to conceal just dis∣like at certain periods.</P>
<P>Avoid whispering in mixed societies:—it is alarming to the suspicious, mortifying to the humble, and, in itself, a habit of great impropriety.</P>
<P>Loud speaking, and excessive laughter, the latter either pointed or unmeaning, are both unbecoming. These unguarded cus∣toms, contracted among intimates, are ne∣ver pardoned by the world.</P>
<P>Assume no masculine airs. To support
<PB N="104" REF="022756_0108_0FBA5F10CE3E0EA0"/>
necessary fatigue is meritorious; but real robustness, and superior force, is denied you by nature—its semblance, denied you by the laws of decency.</P>
<P>On no occasion relax in the article of cleanliness regarding your own person; nor suffer indolence or sickness to destroy a habit, which is as much connected with health, as it is with decorum.</P>
<P>With regard to dress, do not aspire to be a leader in fashions, nor excessive in point of ornament.</P>
<P>Follow fashions at a moderate distance; nor blindly adopt such as may expose you to ridicule; for servile imitation makes no distinctions.</P>
<P>Age, beauty, and fortune, should be si∣milar to make the same ornaments suitable to different persons: pursue therefore your own path of propriety, and consult your reason more than your glass.</P>
<P>Give up every favorite opinion, in point of dress, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that of those whom it is your duty to please.</P>
<P>While young, you have little need of or∣naments—when old, they are ineffectual.</P>

applause, however flattery may have en∣couraged you in the enterprise.</P>
<P>Those of our sex, endowed with rare talents, are sometimes too negligent of personal advantages. Science and neatness are no natural opponents.</P>
<P>A superior understanding will exclude the little vanities habitual to our sex: but it must not extinguish that complaisance, due to the customs of a world we are de∣stined to live with, provided it leads us not beyond the limits of our fortune.</P>
<P>There are societies so critical in dress, as to render their access terrible to sensible and modest persons; whose consciousness of their bodily defects, or of the smallness of their revenues, ill prepare them to encoun∣ter contemptuous examination.</P>
<P>Should those you are the most intimate with, fall inadvertantly into mistakes that may expose their dress or manner to ridi∣cule, it will be as kind to give them pri∣vate admonition, as it would be inhuman to join in the public censure.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the graces of the per∣son give favorable impressions of the mind—which reflection should be a monitor to correct all awkward habits and gestures.</P>
<P>Too great a degree of timidity is pro∣ductive
<PB N="106" REF="022756_0110_0FBA5F16E1234AA8"/>
of the very inconveniencies that real modesty would urge us to avoid: look around in society, on the conceited and ig∣norant; and cease to blush and tremble among them.</P>
<P>Be neither vain of your birth, nor your present rank: they are accidents, not al∣ways acquired by merit; perhaps, in the issue, to be lamented.</P>
<P>If elevated by alliance beyond your ex∣pectance, endeavour to support that advan∣tage by the dignity of your actions.</P>
<P>Give no one, by arrogance, or ill-timed haughtiness, title to enquire into your ori∣gin, or to wish your return to that station you have been elevated from.</P>
<P>Let no unexpected exaltation abate your love or veneration for your parents.</P>
<P>Dare to testify public respect to perhaps obscure relations, whom fortune has ne∣glected, while she has smiled on you.</P>
<P>Let neither time, change of place, nor prosperity, diminish your gratitude tow∣ards those from whom you have once re∣ceived an obligation.</P>
<P>There is a certain forced humility, as offensive to delicate feelings, as a revealed pride; in acting this part, you may de∣ceive
<PB N="107" REF="022756_0111_0FBA5F17F6DF60E8"/>
yourself, but you will not those whose good-will you would wish to conciliate.</P>
<P>Should accident throw in your way some former acquaintance of your youth, whom misfortune has pursued, and whom afflictions have driven from your more flow∣ery path of life, endeavour to obliterate their humiliating remembrance of those happier times, by unaffected kindness.</P>
<P>Redouble even your attention to the un∣fortunate; avoid every subject that may awaken or increase distress.</P>
<P>Let no false shame induce you to check an exertion of pity, nor think it great to seem unfeeling.</P>
<P>Sustain patiently a very common, but false imputation of a want of understand∣ing, rather than avow a want of good na∣ture.</P>
<P>Be undauntedly courageous in the de∣fence of your neighbour's character, when you have just foundation to think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in∣jured.</P>
<P>Be sparing of censure at all times, and liberal of applause.</P>
<P>Guard your tongue and your pen against bitterness; above all, when the object may ever have offended you.</P>
<P>The strongest proof we can give of the
<PB N="108" REF="022756_0112_0FBA5F19C2772250"/>
excellency of our principles, is the pardon of injuries, as it is that of our victory over our passions.</P>
<P>During your youth, be cautious of your manner of speaking of the beauty of your own sex; of their characters, when you grow old.</P>
<P>Should heaven have bestowed much per∣sonal perfection on you, take redoubled care of your mind.</P>
<P>Consider a more than ordinary share of beauty, rather as a trial than a gift.</P>
<P>You have only to contemplate the scenes this world daily presents you with▪ of the fragility and brevity of youth and beauty, to prevent all comparisons from hurting you.</P>
<P>Exert your candor, and show your com∣passion towards those, whose beauty may have exposed them to error and misfortunes.</P>
<P>If sure of your own conduct, you can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to protect unhappy victims of slan∣der, you risk to incur your portion of cen∣sure; but guarded by conscience, and di∣rected by humanity, these arrows will only glance, and not wound you.</P>
<P>There is a distinction to be observed be∣tween countenance and pity.</P>
<P>Be never lukewarm in the praise of co∣temporaries. It is surely a pleasing task to

being that merit to light, which has bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obscured by adversity, or concealed by modesty.</P>
<P>There is a style of praise so blended with <HI>Buts,</HI> and <HI>Ifs,</HI> that it loses its energy be∣fore it reaches the object.</P>
<P>From your manner of joining in com∣mendation of the absent, your sincerity will be judged, and discernment will pene∣trate the veil of reluctant approbation.</P>
<P>Call on your pride, to suppress those emotions of envy, that charity cannot can∣quer.</P>
<P>Reflect on the perpetual vicissitudes, the most beautiful, the most prosperous are sub∣ject to: you will soon exchange the look of disdain, for that of pity, and the mur∣murs of comparison, for expressions of gratitude, on your security from similar ac∣cidents.</P>
<P>Let the virtues and graces of those of your own age serve as incentives to your e∣mulation.</P>
<P>Shut your eyes to the personal blemishes of your acquaintance, and open your ear to the sound of their virtues.</P>
<P>At that age when vanity reigns the most despotically, call generosity and good-nature to your aid: at least prevent its ill∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ects

<P>Should there, among your connexions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e some one, from inevitable and remote causes, plunged into distress, or even from misconduct; deny yourself a superfluous ornament privately, to relieve them.</P>
<P>Should a plentiful fortune enable you to indulge a disposition to give, complete the happiness of the receivers by the manner of bestowing.</P>
<P>The language of contempt, flowing from a conscious superiority, arises from the mistake, that accidental gifts of fortune are the portion of merit: avoid ever to use it to an unhappy inferior.</P>
<P>There is a particular grace appropriated to the exertion of each virtue; and cha∣rity has its claim: you may bestow millions with awkwardness and insensibillity; re∣fuse, yet not displease.</P>
<P>You will hardly be able to compensate, by a long expected gift, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your hesitation may have occasioned.</P>
<P>If ever you should have been a sufferer from ingratitude, (and who has not more or less?) do not permit the recollection to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den your heart.</P>
<P>Of all the delicate sensations the mind
<PB N="111" REF="022756_0115_0FBA5F1F3A32AA98"/>
is capable of, none perhaps will surpass <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which attends the relief of an avowed enemy.</P>
<P>Be fearless of the effects of revenge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you are compelled, by the worthlessness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an object, to refuse your assistance.</P>
<P>Let not your love of popularity impose on your innate principles of justice, so far as to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t you countenance dishonor, to pur∣chase adulation.</P>
<P>Attend to the age and character of those who solicit your favours; encourage youth in industry; procure the aged repose.</P>
<P>Observe a constant respect towards the advanced in age of every condition; ex∣cuse their infirmities, indulge their fancies, and mitigate the pains of decay.</P>
<P>Suffer no harsh expression to mark your impatience, ocasioned by the misapprehen∣sion of decayed faculties.</P>
<P>Do not consider, during your youth, the aged, as distinct beings from yourself: your journey, if you live, will be more speedy, than you imagine, to the same period, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> render you equally dependant on the com∣passion and patience of a younger race.</P>
<P>It is not always necessary for different ages to assort with each other; but when circumstances demand it, be assured, the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enefit will be on the younger side, whose knowledge must be inferior, and conse∣quently their power of amusing less.</P>
<P>You will reap more satisfaction from con∣ferring obligations on persons of a certain age, than on those on a younger date; there is a certain attendant pride on hope, at the beginning of life, that experience, on the decline of it, contributes to sup∣press.</P>
<P>It is not an ostentatious gift, that will excite real gratitude.</P>
<P>A friendly word, a seasonable recom∣mendation may, at some juncture, procure as much advantage, as a pecuniary kind∣ness at another.</P>
<P>Be mindful to avoid making rash pro∣mises: your professions, without reason to imagine you can render them effectual, are an injustice time must reveal.</P>
<P>It is better to occasion an agreeable sur∣prise than a painful disappointment: a mo∣dest activity will produce the one, a pre∣sumptuous confidence the other.</P>
<P>When you shall contemplate necessity struggling with modesty: endeavor to oblige, in a manner that shall meet the wish half-way, and save the blush of re∣quest.</P>

Let not your delicacy repose at the mo∣ment of conferring a benefit: continue to employ it in restraining the vanity of a re∣cital, or even of a remoter hint of that ac∣tion, which the laws of religion and mora∣lity prescribe, to all Christians particularly.</P>
<P>Do not expect an equivalent for a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kindness, where there shall be the means; for generosity ceases to merit the name, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is to become an exchange.</P>

<P>Of all the pernicious customs, to which the unthinking opulent are subject, that of suffering trades-people to languish at your door, or in your ante-chamber, is one of the most insolent and prejudicial.</P>
<P>Content yourself, in making purchases, with less than the exact return, rather than to be eternally disputing for more: on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other hand, it is unjust to yourself and your connexions, to allow of glaring impositions.</P>

<P>If your choice and taste meet with ap∣probation, let those, who have executed your designs in furniture, dress, or equi∣page, share the praise and profit of the world's opinion, by a circulation of their talents.</P>

<P>Permit no foolish insinuations or ill-bred examples ever to involve you in the disgrace of improper behavior in public or in private.</P>
<P>To be exact in the rules of good breed∣ing, is, in the eyes of fools of fashion, deemed awkwardness and ignorance. Sustain these interpretations without emotion; and persist intrepidly, with your usual polite∣ness, to keep impertinence at a distance.</P>

<P>You cannot inflict a juster punishment on the mis∣trustful or malicious, than to resist your wish for expla∣nation of mysterious insinuations.</P>
<P>Intermix no peevishness with your answer to idle and improper questions. A distant complaisance will sooner protect you against repeated attacks of that na∣ture, than impatience.</P>
<P>Endeavour to correct a disposition to absence of mind—its effects are various—some amusing, some ridiculous, but all unprofitable.</P>
<P>Absence of mind has, in some instances, been con∣tracted from a desire of imitating persons, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame in other respects has veiled their errors.</P>
<P>By permitting your reflections to carry you from your society, you expose yourself to very hazardous mistakes.</P>

<P>If you can accuse yourself of having touched some tender string by an unguarded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally, make the earliest atonement you can.</P>
<P>Do not ever allow yourself to exaggerate in praise or in censure.</P>
<P>Truth is sometimes out-run by an ambition to shine; this throws the speaker into the superlative, and leaves reality behind.</P>

In relating an event, confine yourself to facts and simplicity.</P>

<P>Above all, when your personal interest comes i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> question, lay aside pride, avarice and revenge.</P>
<P>Be on your guard against misrepresentation, and be certain before you hazard repetition.</P>

<P>Be not prone to imagine, that the arrows of sarcasm, so often and so heedlessly thrown out in mixed com∣panies, are always pointed at you It is absolutely ne∣cessary to assume a decent courage in numerous socie∣ties; for too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a sensibility deprives the owner of a∣ny degree of defence against insult and arrogance.</P>
<P>Do not embitter the chearfulness of conversation by gloomy reflections.</P>
<P>Whether from momentary or lasting causes you labor under uneasiness of mind, society must not share it.</P>
<P>It is wrong to diminish innocent satisfaction by dis∣contentment and gloom. Seek and nourish content when it approaches; nor suffer yesterday or to-mor∣row to poison the present moment.</P>
<P>Were we to dive too deeply into the sources and motives of the most laudable actions, we may, by tar∣nishing their lustre, deprive ourselves of a pleasure.</P>

<P>Be well assured of the strength of your own mind, and calmness of your temper, before you consult any one, on matters of consequence to yourself.</P>
<P>In telling the truth, and exposing facts, you may ex∣cite and even merit contradiction. Examine previous∣ly, how far you are prepared to bear it.</P>

<P>Where taciturnity and cold reserve is absolutely ne∣cessary, it is at the moment, when raillery, however genteel, and criticism equally brilliant, shall be the favorite topic of conversation.</P>
<P>The only real benefit to be derived from poignant censure, is the application to the errors our conscience shall accuse us of; never to the condemnation of others.</P>
<P>The characteristics of real virtue are humility, com∣passion, and benevolence: the assumed, are pride, hardness to the world's imperfections, blindness to our own.</P>

<P>In every situation it is proper to pay due attention to your family concerns. That du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y acquitted, consider all supernumerary employment, as relaxation.</P>
<P>Despise no occupation, as vulgar or trifling, that can contribute to any general benefit.</P>
<P>There have been, and there still exist, many sensible persons, who lead the life of romance, that can stoop to no vulgar cares.

<P>Do not mistake the omission of any proper atten∣tion, for elevation of sentiment.</P>

<P>Keep up your politeness—your neatness:—contract no formality; but pursue the rules you have laid down, with firmness, yet with case.</P>
<P>Receive your inferior neighbours with good humor and complacency, nor sigh nor sicken at conversation that situation must furnish.</P>
<P>An unpolished expression or an unfashionable dress

should never excite anger or contempt in you, pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ded the hearts of your society are untainted.</P>
<P>Put yourself, as much as you can, on a level wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your neighbours, nor draw the younger part, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fortunes will not admit of it, into frivolous expen∣ses, and idle imitation of changeable fashions.</P>
<P>Do not continually quote the magnificence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> earlier days, nor those pleasures impossible to share in your present situation.</P>
<P>Consider, your judgment of persons and their qualities, may be somewhat influenced by age, sickness, or disappointments; imperfection did, and will exist, as long as this world shall last.</P>
<P>Your society will more respect you for your pro∣priety of conduct, after all the vicissitudes of for∣tune you may have experienced, than for the vain descriptions of beauty or of grandeur that are past.</P>
<P>Listen to the distresses, attend to the maladies of the poor; endeavour to mitigate the one, and heal the other.</P>
<P>Not only administer to the health of poor people, but encourage their industry</P>
<P>Superintend the instruction of the poorer sort; intermix nothing of magnificence in your support of them.</P>
<P>Encourage reading among the younger poor, no farther than as it shall inform them of their duty to God and man.</P>
<P>A very few precepts, and much good example, to persons without education, are the surest me∣thods of encouraging virtue among them.</P>
<P>Let your pecuniary aids be distributed with dis∣cretion.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="022756_0138_0FBA5F50B5BE6088"/>
In the payment of labor, consider the limits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ers' fortune, should your own be superior.</P>
<P>Let none share your bounty, whose conduct and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>racter do not merit it; but abandon them not, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you can hope for their reformation.</P>
<P>There is a pious kind of anger, that does some∣times so blend itself with female charity, as is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heck to gratitude, even in the acceptance of gifts.</P>
<P>Experience in the use of drugs may much contri∣bute to the safety of poor objects, above all, those who have slight indispositions; but a smattering in physic is rather a dangerous tool in female hands.</P>
<P>Apply to the mind, as well as body, of such in∣digent persons who shall implore your assistance: examine into the causes of their unhappy state; a small donation and a kind expression will save many a sufferer from sickness and despair.</P>
<P>Let each year, which shall steal a charm or a grace, the companions of your youth, add a virtue in return.</P>
<P>The decay of beauty is perhaps one of the most sensible trials that female temper can experience; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>early endeavour to prevent its consequences, by throwing your thoughts on mental acquirements.</P>
<P>Substitute extreme neatness to ornament, in ad∣vanced age, gentleness to vivacity, humility to va∣nity.</P>
<P>The beauties of nature, a healthful walk, a ri∣sing and setting fun, the prosperity and perfections of your descendants, will amply replace, in your mind, the pleasures and pursuits of your younger years, too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> checked by misfortune, and destroy∣ed by disappointments.</P>
<P>Let those hands, once perhaps too much occu∣pied
<PB N="135" REF="022756_0139_0FBA5F52AA5952E8"/>
in arranging and placing personal ornam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> busy themselves in forming raiment for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in spinning and knitting for such ends, consolat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> reflections will attend your labors.</P>
<P>Encourage every innocent amusement among those yet capable of tasting them; exclude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> music or the dance from your society, particular in the country.</P>
<P>Be sparing of your reflections in youthful societies they are often misinterpreted, and ascribed to re∣gret and envy.</P>
<P>When ready to censure the present day call over your own conduct in a former one; and candid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> examine your title to decisive condemnation of tri∣fling indiscretion.</P>
<P>Persuasion will hang on the voice of good nature and benevolence: employ no other means to influ∣ence and lead young persons to prudence and virtue.</P>
<P>Render yourself the confidant, and not the ty∣rant, of your acquaintance; they will fly from seve∣rity: humanity will attract them.</P>
<P>If in any wise entitled to counsel, or to correct, make use of some recent and forcible example, which are the production of almost every day.</P>
<P>Be not arbitrary on the point of dress among your female society: it suffices, if you observe a proper decorum yourself in that article.</P>
<P>Lament not the desertion of certain persons, whose friendship and opinion you once relied on; you are better without them, if their former atten∣tions were derived from your opulence or connex∣ions.</P>
<P>That too common and illiberal behaviour, among the young and unthinking, towards the old and un∣happy, which, in large companies, it may be your
<PB N="136" REF="022756_0140_0FBA5F546DFB7C00"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to encounter, is only to be avoided, by contract∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the circle of your acquaintance; and surely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cannot be deemed a hardship by good sense and experience.</P>
<P>Do not shun the afflicted; there are dispositions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the world, who, looking on sorrow as contagious, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>come inhuman through fear.</P>
<P>Listen to tales of wo, with gratitude on your own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccount, compassion for the sufferers.</P>
<P>Profit of others misfortunes or mistakes, as a cor∣rection to your pride, and a guard to your steps.</P>
<P>Abstain from all uncharitable comments on the reports of the misconduct of the world; be grate∣ful to that Providence which hath conducted you into the harbour; and commiserate the storms your fellow-creatures are exposed to.</P>
<P>Endeavour to put a favourable interpretation on all uncertain rumors, when to the disadvantage of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>temporaries: in such obscurity, it appertains only to omniscience to discover, omnipotence to judge.</P>
<P>Use your strongest efforts, to detach yourself from, and, in a certain degree, to abate in your affections towards all perishable objects.</P>
<P>Vanity, in declining years, is often substituted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passions: support of family, the pride of name, are shadows that will dissolve and vanish like yourself.</P>
<P>When real affection reigns, no mode of reasoning will be more prevailing for consolation, than this of the certainty, that the object of it is doomed to submit to the general laws of God, and nature.</P>
<P>To young persons, the death of cotemporaries is the most speaking lesson they can receive</P>
<P>If you lose your companions late in life, if they
<PB N="137" REF="022756_0141_0FBA5F5689E0D6D0"/>
shall have merited the esteem of good people, pur∣sue their paths in order to rejoin them.</P>
<P>During such afflictions as are confined to yourself seek not relief from the dissipated and unfeeling world; nor, till you can control your sorrows, ex∣pose them to insensibility, if not derision.</P>
<P>The most probable diversion to acute afflicted will be your exertions in the service of your fellows creatures.</P>
<P>Suffer no peevishness to intermix itself with trou∣ble; it is a species of revolt against the decrees of Providence.</P>
<P>Betray no kind of impatience at the aukward efforts of unskilful acquaintance, in the article of consolation.</P>
<P>You will meet, among indifferent spectators of misfortune, a certain hard and prying look, which seems to seek for such causes of it, as may save their compassion, and authorize their censure.</P>
<P>The only disappointment you can inflict on im∣pertinent curiosity, is the concealment of your sen∣sations.</P>
<P>Mention death neither with horror nor contempt.</P>
<P>By beginning early to permit the intrusion of the subject of mortality some few moments in each day, you will meet death with more serenity.</P>
<P>It is great temerity to be calling for that, the sud∣den approach of which may not find you prepared, or obstruct your preparation.</P>
<P>To wish for a cessation of pain, or mental misery, is surely allowable; but it is presumption to use im∣portunity in requesting it.</P>
<P>It is too customary, with the soothing voice of
<PB N="138" REF="022756_0142_0FBA5F5C360F1C80"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and among the companions of youth, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> silent on a subject that cannot continue a secret, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of which too sudden a revealment must strike <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> redoubled terror.</P>

<P>Collect together each virtue of the dead; and, when the remembrance of their faults will arise, think of your own.</P>
<P>If conviction and conscience will not allow of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, keep silence.</P>
<P>When it is in your power to soften the harsh co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> wont to be bestowed by cowardly minds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> characters of the dead, pursue the dictates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christianity with firmness, should they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> merely acquaintance.</P>
<P>When the reputation of a worthy and departed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd shall be attacked, repel the assault with co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>; those have, alas! few champions, who can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> longer reward, no longer punish.</P>
<P>If it were ever justifiable, a breach of promise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uld become so, which would release you from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing any circumstances a secret in the life of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> friend, which their modesty had exacted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you to conceal, but which could erase suspicion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wipe away reproach by revealment.</P>
<P>Extend your kindness, and continue your affec∣tion to all that shall remain of those you loved; if worthy, it is the only sure mode of consolation you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an have recourse to.</P>
<P>That natural repugnance, which attends the

thoughts of death, has surely been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> our minds, in order to inspire us with prudent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the conduct of our lives: accompany your at∣tention to the one, by a calm submission to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other.</P>
<P>When you, in your day, shall be compelled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> submit to the universal law, the recollection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> having contributed to mitigate others sufferings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soften your own.</P>
<P>In grief, sickness, and danger, make your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and constant application to that power, which al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> can relieve and save.</P>
<P>Let your conduct be such to all around you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall lead them to the same path without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>If your strength of mind subsists, during your malady, if it gives you time for the exertion of ra∣tional power, let it check, as much as possible those encroaching indulgencies which sickness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> exact.</P>
<P>The ceremonies, which friendly zeal usually ob∣serves, and respectful decency requires about the sick, are oft as terrific as the sickness itself; those of religion excepted, which will prove your only safe support and consolation.</P>
<P>Be assured, that when able to exert your chearful∣ness, it is in no wise contrary to the precepts of re∣ligion.</P>
