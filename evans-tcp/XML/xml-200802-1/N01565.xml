<HEAD>RULERS Feeding AND Guiding their PEOPLE, WITH Integrity and Skilfulness.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PLALM LXXVIII. 72.</BIBL>
<Q>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart: and guided them by the Skilfulness of his bands.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GREAT Accomplishments are needful, for the right managing of Great Affairs. The <HI>well Go∣verning</HI> of a <HI>Professing People</HI> of God, is a very great Affair in∣deed; and very eminent Qualifications are needful for it. Our Text gives an Instance, of the well Governing of a Professing Peo∣ple of God; and of the Qualifications need∣ful
<PB N="2" REF="001861_0008_0FB91EF32D01F518"/>
thereto, and exerted therein. For it tells us concerning <HI>David,</HI> who was <HI>King</HI> over <HI>Israel</HI> God's Professing People, that <HI>he fed them according to the Integrity of his heart, and guided them by the Skilfulness of his hands.</HI> This <HI>Psalm</HI> whereof our Text is the close, gives us an account of God's wonderful Appearances for, and merciful Dealings with, His People Is∣rael in Egypt; of His Mercy in bringing them thence, protecting and supplying them in the Wilderness, bringing them into <HI>Canaan</HI> and possessing them of that good Land; and of His kind Dispensations to them for a con∣siderable time after. It also gives an ac∣count, of the unsuitable returns which Israel made, to the God and Giver of all their Mer∣cies: it relates their ungrateful, disobedient carriage to God. This History, which briefly relates sundry Grand Articles of Divine Con∣duct towards Israel, and of their behaviour towards God, for the space of <HI>between Four and Five Hundred Years,</HI> (1 King. 6. 1.) I say, this History seems to present us, with a sort of <HI>Contest</HI> between the Bounty, Mercy and Kindness of God; and the Ingratitude and Disobedience of His People, as tho' there were a strife which should overcome. And if we may look on this matter as a sort of <HI>Contest,</HI> then God (<HI>who is merciful and gracious,
<PB N="3" REF="001861_0009_0FB91EF655C7A730"/>
slow to anger &amp; plenteous in mercy,</HI> Psal. 103. 8) comes off Conqueror at last. For tho' He several times sorely and sharply chasten'd them, and in His Providence plainly testify'd against their gross Transgressions; yet on the other hand, <HI>He being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not; yea</HI> MANY <HI>a</HI> TIME <HI>turned be his anger away, and did not stir up all his Wrath.</HI> ver. 38. Tho'God often made them smart for their ill carriage, yet their Punishments were not so severe as their Sins deserved. <HI>He dealt not with them after their Sins, neither rewarded them according to their Ini∣quities,</HI> Psal. 103. 10. He did not yet utter∣ly cast them off from being His People, nor utterly take His loving kindness from them; but His Mercy triumphed over their unwor∣thiness. For the History in this Psalm is clos'd, in relating a great and remarkable In∣stance of God's kindness to His People; even in setting an <HI>Able, Faithful and Godly Ruler ever them.</HI> This is mention'd (and that very justly) as a plain, evident Instance of his a∣bundant care of, and goodness to, his People, <HI>ver.</HI> 70, 7I. <HI>He chose David also his Servant, and took him from the Sheep folds; from following the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great with young, he brought him to feed Jacob his People, and Israel his Inheritance.</HI> The Person <HI>chosen</HI> was <HI>David,</HI> here call'd <HI>God's Ser∣vant</HI>;
<PB N="4" REF="001861_0004_0FB91EE514F9FAD8"/>
and an <HI>eminent</HI> Servant of God he was, to whom God himself gave testimony saying, <HI>I have found David the Son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all my will,</HI> Act. 13.22. Note by the way,</P>
<P>The more any Person <HI>is after God's own heart,</HI> the more Inclin'd <HI>to fulfil his will</HI>; so much the more fit he is to be a <HI>Ruler.</HI> This <HI>David,</HI> had been a <HI>Shepherd</HI> in a proper and literal sense, he had kept his Father's Sheep, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.11, 19. &amp; 17.15. God calls him from this work, to be a <HI>Political Shepherd</HI> to <HI>Israel</HI> his co∣venant Professing People. God's People, are sometimes compar'd to <HI>Sheep,</HI> to a <HI>Flock</HI> of them, (2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.17. Psal. 80.1.) and so <HI>David's</HI> be∣ing call'd to <HI>govern them,</HI> is call'd a <HI>Feeding</HI> of them. And whom must <HI>David, Feed?</HI> Why <HI>Jacob, Israel, God's People, God's Inheritance.</HI> They were a People near and dear to God; in a peculiar, fingular, distinguishing man∣ner <HI>God's special Propriety,</HI> His <HI>Inheritance, Posses∣sion,</HI> his <HI>Peculiar treasure above all People,</HI> Exod. 19.5. <HI>For the Lord's Portion is his People; Jacob is the Lot of his Inheritance,</HI> Deut. 32.9. <HI>Psal.</HI> I.35.4. It was an high and honourable, weighty and important work, to govern a People thus distinguishingly <HI>near to God</HI>; <HI>His</HI> peculiar trea∣sure, portion and inheritance. Well, our Text tells us, <HI>how, David</HI> manag'd himfelf in
<PB N="5" REF="001861_0005_0FB91EE6955808F8"/>
governing this People; he <HI>fed &amp; guided</HI> them. The Phrase is Metaphorical, it alludes to the practice of <HI>Shepherds</HI> who consult the <HI>good of their Sheep</HI>; and therefore indeavour to <HI>lead</HI> and <HI>guide</HI> them in right ways, to keep them from stragling and straying, from walking in paths that would be dangerous and hurtful to them. This <HI>feeding</HI> them, signifies also a kind, tender care to see them <HI>well provided for</HI>; a <HI>making them to lye down in green pastures, a lead∣ing them by still waters,</HI> (Psal. 23.2.) a taking care, that they may <HI>go in and out, and find Pasture,</HI> Job. 10.9. <HI>Feeding</HI> and <HI>Guiding</HI> them imports, a thoughtful, sollicitous, industrious care, for the good &amp; welfare of God's Sheep, his professing People. Further still <HI>David</HI> did thus <HI>Feed</HI> and <HI>Guide</HI> them,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>According to the integrity of his heart.</HI> It seems his <HI>Heart</HI> was ingag'd in the work, the weight and importance of it came home to his <HI>heart,</HI> it lay close and near to his Spirit. He look'd not on it as a work by the by, as a trivial business of small concern; but his very. Soul was indeed ingag'd in it. And truly, since such a valuable <HI>Depositum,</HI> such a <HI>peculiar Treasure</HI> as <HI>Gods Covenant People</HI> were commit∣ted to him, and betrusted with him; 'twas highly reasonable and needful, that his very <HI>heart,</HI> his Soul should be diligently imploy'd in
<PB N="6" REF="001861_0006_0FB91EEA5D74C968"/>
caring for them, and in promoting their wel∣fare. Rich Jewels and Treasures, should be diligently and carefully look'd to, that they may be kept well and safe; but there are no Jewels or Treasures in the World, of so high a price and value as God's Covenant People are. They are dear to God as the <HI>Apple of his Eye,</HI> Zech. 2.8 Well, <HI>David</HI> imploy'd his Heart, yea <HI>Integrity</HI> of heart in <HI>feeding</HI> God's Peo∣ple in governing of them. <HI>Integrity,</HI> the word signifies (as <HI>Criticks</HI> observe) <HI>Upright, Perfect, Sincere, Honest</HI> and <HI>without Guile</HI>: such was his <HI>Heart</HI> in Feeding them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>According to the Skilfulness of his Hands, Skilfulness,</HI> The Word signifies <HI>Knowlege, Un∣derstanding, Prudence Tebunoth,</HI> The Hebrew Word here rendred <HI>Skilfulness,</HI> is in the <HI>Plu∣ral</HI> Number; and may Intimate the very great or <HI>manifold</HI> Skilfulness which <HI>David</HI> had, and exercised in Governing Israel. He had great Skill and Understanding in <HI>Reli∣gious, Civil</HI> and <HI>Military</HI> matters: he was <HI>quick Sighted, very knowing, Wise, Judicious,</HI> he had a very penetrating Thought and Saga∣city. The Woman of <HI>Tekoa</HI> said to him, 2 Sam. 14.20. <HI>— My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an Angel of God, to know all things that are in the Earth. David</HI> was very <HI>Skilful</HI> and our Text ascribes this <HI>Skilfulness</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001861_0007_0FB91EEBD69D2B58"/>
to his <HI>Hands,</HI> because the <HI>Hands</HI> are the com∣mon Instruments of <HI>Action</HI>: he manifested great Skill, Wisdom, Prudence in his <HI>Admi∣nistrations. Hands,</HI> 'Tis in the <HI>Plural</HI> Number, he laid <HI>both hands too</HI>; he had work e∣nough to fill them both. It may also Inti∣mate, that he was <HI>Laborious</HI> in his work, <HI>spared no pains,</HI> was willing to exert <HI>all his Powers and Abilities</HI> to make his People <HI>easy and happy. David</HI> was remarkable for his <HI>Skill,</HI> his <HI>Wise, Judicious</HI> Conduct, even while his Predecessor <HI>Saul</HI> was living, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18.5. 14, 30 And the main course of his Conduct after he came to be <HI>King,</HI> was not less remarkable for the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> of it; only there must be a <HI>saving</HI> as to the <HI>matter of Uriah the Hittite,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 15.5. What our Text relates about <HI>Davids</HI> Conduct as a <HI>Civil Ruler</HI> among God's professing People; is recorded as an Instance of God's <HI>great Favour</HI> in setting such an one to Rule them; and also as an <HI>Example</HI> to be Imitated by those, who may be concern'd in Governing such a People. Our Text there∣fore may afford us this,</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
Those who are in Civil Government among a Pro∣fessing People of God, should Feed and Guide them with Integrity and Skilfulness.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001861_0010_0FB91EF7D65CB370"/>There are Three Propositions contain'd in this Doctrine. viz. (I.) <HI>Those who are in Civil Government among a Professing People of God should Feed and Guide them.</HI> (2.) <HI>They should do it with Integrity.</HI> (3.) <HI>They should do it with Skilfulness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PROP. I.</HI> Those who are in Civil Govern∣ment among a Professing People of God, should Feed and Guide them.</P>
<P>Here it would be easy (and possibly, not altogether unnecessary) to premise,</P>
<P>That there are various forms of Civil Go∣vernment among Men, as <HI>Monarchical, Aristo∣cratical, Democratical,</HI> and some of a mixed na∣ture. I shall add nothing by way of <HI>Comparison,</HI> to say which of these is most or least eligible.</P>
<P>Persons concerned in the Government of a People, may have <HI>various or different business</HI> assign'd to them: some may be concern'd in the <HI>Ligislative</HI> part, to <HI>make Laws</HI> for the good of a People, and some in the <HI>Executive</HI> part, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Laws <HI>well Executed</HI>: and some, possi∣bly; (tho' under different considerations) may be concern'd in both. Again,</P>
<P>There are different <HI>Posts</HI> or <HI>Stations</HI> in Go∣vernment, some <HI>Superior</HI> and some <HI>Inferior.</HI> Thus we read of the <HI>King</HI> as <HI>Supream,</HI> and of <HI>Governours as sent by him,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14.
<PB N="9" REF="001861_0011_0FB91EF9568774C0"/>
So, there are other different Ranks, Stations, Degrees besides <HI>these two</HI> here mentioned. Consequently.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Abilities</HI> or <HI>Endowments</HI> may compe∣tently fit or <HI>qualify</HI> a Person, <HI>for one Part or Sta∣tion</HI> in Government, which may <HI>not for another.</HI> There were in Israel, <HI>Rulers of Thousands, Rulers of Hundreds, Rulers of Fifties, and Rulers of Tens,</HI> Exod. 18 22, 25, 26. Those may possibly be qualify'd for some <HI>Inferior</HI> place in Govern∣ment, which are not for a <HI>Superior.</HI> The like degree of Skill, Wisdom, Prudence is not need∣ful to qualify a Person for one Station or Bu∣siness in Government, which is needful for another that is much Superior &amp; more difficult.</P>
<P>Therefore what I shall say concerning the <HI>Qualifications</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> of those in Authority, is to be understood generally &amp; extensively; and so to be particularly applied according to the different Stations any sustain in Govern∣ment: for that may be the proper business of some, which others are not immediately at all concern'd to meddle in.</P>
<P>These Things being premised, we may a∣gain assert,</P>
<P><HI>Those who are in Civil Government among a professing People of God, should Feed and Guide them.</HI> This <HI>Feeding</HI> and <HI>Guiding</HI> of them, must needs signifie and comprehend in it (as was hinted
<PB N="10" REF="001861_0012_0FB91EFC58023D80"/>
in opening the Words) their <HI>indeavouring the true Good Welfare</HI> and <HI>Prosperity of their People. Plato</HI> could say, <HI>The People were not made for the Governour, but the Governour for the People.</HI> And this seems agreable to Rom. 13.4. <HI>He is the Minister of God to thee Good.</HI> Those who Govern among a prosending People, should very carefully indeavour the true Welfare of their People. Therefore they should in∣deavour, (I.) <HI>That their People may do Good.</HI> (2) <HI>That they may injoy Good.</HI> (3) <HI>They should indeavour to make Good Laws, and to see them well Executed, in order hereunto.</HI> Rulers should In∣deavour,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That their People may do Good.</HI> Their <HI>do∣ing Good,</HI> I here take in a general comprehen∣sive sense, to signifie their <HI>Living obediently to God's revealed preceptive will</HI> (as the Gospel teaches, Tit. 2.12.) <HI>their denying ungodiness and worldly lusts; and living soberly, righteously, godlily in this present world.</HI> Mic. 6.8. <HI>He hath shewed thee, O man what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</HI> It is good for Persons, to turn from Sin to God in Christ Jesus, to live holily: this is <HI>good</HI> in a <HI>moral</HI> sense, it's the duty of all under the Gos∣pel, 'tis what God requires of them. And their thus doing duty, their being sincerely and
<PB N="11" REF="001861_0013_0FB91F02BB572598"/>
practically religious and vertuous; has a di∣rect <HI>natural</HI> tendercy in many regards, to promote their outward good &amp; welfare (as well as their inward comfort and joy) here in this present World. And further still, their obedi∣ence to the Gospel, their conforming to God's revealed preceptive will, has a <HI>moral</HI> or fede∣ral tendency to promote their truest Welfare, both in this World &amp; in the next. Isai. 3.10. <HI>Say to the righteous, that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</HI> 1 Tim. 4 8. <HI>Godliness is prositable to all things, having the promise of the life that now is and of that which is 'to come.</HI> He that is wife, is prositable to him∣self. If a Person or People heartily obey God, the advantage will be their own. <HI>Moses</HI> said to Israel, Deut. 6.24. <HI>And the Lord commaded us to do all thise Statutes: to fear the Lordour God, FOR OUR GOOD always, that he might preserve us alive as it is this day.</HI> And God said of them, Deut. 5.29. <HI>Oh that there Were such an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my com∣mandments always, that is might be well with them, and with their children forever.</HI> The Prophet said to God's People, 2 Chron. 15.2,— <HI>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; if ye seek him, he will be found of you: but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</HI> For a People to be Pious, is the way to be Prosperous. Deut. 29.19. <HI>Keep
<PB N="12" REF="001861_0014_0FB91F06610E2C68"/>
therefore the words of this Covenant, and do them that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</HI> 2 Chron. 24.20.—<HI>Thus saith God, why transgress ye the com∣mandment of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper? be∣cause ye have for saken the Lord, he also bath forsa∣ken you. When a mans ways please the Lord, be maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him,</HI> Prov, 16.7. This is as true of a <HI>People</HI> as of a <HI>Person.</HI></P>
<P>It's undeniably evident from these things, that it's <HI>Good, Prositable, Advantagious</HI> to a pro∣sessing People, to live obediently unto God. God Is the Supream, Soveraign Maker, Owner and Ruler of all things. <HI>His Kingdom ruleth over all;</HI> and His Dominion is an Everlasting Dominion. Nothing but his bounty &amp; kind∣ness, can make a Person or People easy and comfortable, in Body or Soul, in Time or to Eternity. It's therefore <HI>Heathenish,</HI> or rather <HI>Atheistical,</HI> to deny that it's prositable for a People to obey God. That <HI>cuning</HI> or <HI>policy,</HI> those <HI>contrivances</HI> or <HI>alliances</HI> which put them upon doing things provoking to God; will sooner or later appear to be, <HI>senseless folly,</HI> or <HI>mischievous craft</HI> (like <HI>Gideons</HI> Ephod, <HI>Judg.</HI> 8.27.) 'twill prove a <HI>Snare</HI> to them. For what∣ever Mens cuning or policy may suggest, yet <HI>their iniquities will separate between them &amp; their God: their sins will bide away his face that he will
<PB N="13" REF="001861_0015_0FB91F07972C0D78"/>
not bear,</HI> Isai. 59.2. <HI>Righteousness exilteth a Nation, but sin is a reproach to any People,</HI> Prov 14.34. Now inasmuch as it is for the good and advantage of a prosessing People, to <HI>do God, to know &amp; do God's Will</HI>; therefore those in Authority should endeavour, to incourage and further such <HI>Knowlege &amp; Obedience</HI> in them. They are true <HI>Feeders</HI> and <HI>Leaders</HI> of their Peo∣ple, when they do their utmost to make them <HI>know</HI> and <HI>obey God.</HI> Those in Authority there∣fore should incourage those things, which tend to promote in their People, the <HI>Knowlege</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of God's holy Will I might briefly Instance in a few things having such a ten∣dency among us, <HI>viz</HI> The incouraging (I.) <HI>Good Order in Families.</HI> (2.) <HI>Schools.</HI> (3)<HI>The Colledge.</HI> (4) <HI>A Learned and Godly Ministry.</HI> (5.) <HI>A Sanctifying the Sabbath.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Good Order in Families.</HI> Heads of Fami∣lies, should instruct their young ones in Holy Scripture Truths and Precepts; <HI>diligently teach</HI> them <HI>God's Law,</HI> (Deut. 6.6, 7.) and <HI>com∣mand</HI> them to <HI>keep the way of the Lord,</HI> Gen. 18.19. They should <HI>bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</HI> (Eph. 6, 4.) <HI>Train</HI> them up in those ways of vertue they ought to walk in as long as they live, tho they should live to be <HI>Old,</HI> Prov. 22.6. They should bring them up religiously, vertuously, diligently;
<PB N="14" REF="001861_0016_0FB91F0914F80EA8"/>
govern them well, keep them under proper restraints and discipline. Children should not be left ro their own giddy unbridled humours, but should be under <HI>Tutors</HI> and <HI>Governours,</HI> (Gal. 4.I, 2.) for they need a <HI>Guide for their Youth.</HI> Children should be brought up, not <HI>Idly,</HI> but <HI>Diligently.</HI> <Q>Twas once a Law in <HI>E∣gypt</HI> &amp; afterwards in <HI>Athens</HI>: that every Man should once a Year give a Satisfactory Ac∣count, what Course he took for a livelihood, else he should be put to Death</Q>. This shows how necessary they thought <HI>Industry</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> were, for the good of the Publick. And further, <HI>Family Prayer</HI> should be constantly at∣tended <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Evening</HI> in our Houses. Heads of Families should resolve like <HI>Joshua, As for me and my house we will serve the Lord,</HI> Josh. 24.15.</P>
<P>These things in their place and order, tend as directly as any thing can do, to promote good knowlege and holy obedience in a pro∣sessing People. And on the other hand, the neglect of Family Instruction, Religion and Government, tends directly to introduce in a shourt time, an <HI>overflowing deluge of Ignorance, Wickedness,</HI> and <HI>wasting Judgments.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>School.</HI> A Person or People can't <HI>do</HI> God's Will, unless they <HI>know</HI> it: if the Under∣standing does not see the right way, the Will
<PB N="15" REF="001861_0017_0FB91F0C63D66488"/>
cannot chuse and walk in it. <HI>That the Soul be without knowledge it is nor good,</HI> Prov. 19.2. There∣fore (besides family Instruction but now hin∣ted at) <HI>Schools</HI> for the Instructing of Children in <HI>Reading</HI> (that they may <HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> the only rule of Faith &amp; Life) <HI>Writing, Cyphe∣ring,</HI> are very needful to promote a Peoples <HI>well doing</HI> &amp; <HI>well being. Grammar Schools</HI> also, for the fitting and training up Persons for the <HI>Colledge,</HI> are very needful to promote <HI>Knowledge</HI> and holy <HI>Obedience</HI> among a prosessing People. It seems needless so much as to <HI>Essay a Demon∣stration</HI> of these things. Any one that seriously considers the State of a People, that the grown∣up Generation are dying and droping off; and that the Children growing up, must soon bear all the sway and influence in all Publick Affairs, I say, any one that seriously weighs these matters, can't but see, That <HI>Good Order in Families,</HI> and <HI>Schools</HI> for the <HI>well Educating of Children,</HI> are unspeakably useful and needful for a Peoples welfare. Every Child that grows up will be a <HI>useful</HI> or <HI>hurtful</HI> Member of the body Politick. And persons thus growing up, are most likely to prove <HI>useful</HI> or <HI>hurtful,</HI> according to the good or bad Methods taken in their Education. Those well <HI>Instructed Go∣verned, Imployed</HI> in their Youth; are most likely to be <HI>harmless and sericeable</HI> in their Genera∣tion.
<PB N="16" REF="001861_0018_0FB91F0D9689BEB0"/>
Those brought up in <HI>Ignorance</HI> &amp; <HI>Idle∣ness, Pride</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI>; are likely to prove Vi∣cious themselves, and to be <HI>Personous, Infectious Plagues</HI> to the Publick. A little Leaven, Lea∣vens the whole lump; what will one <HI>Scabby Sheep</HI> do? Those who thro' coveteousness or, bruitish carelessness, are unwilling ta Incou∣rage <HI>Schools</HI> &amp; the well Educating of Children; seem really to be Enemies to Christ's King∣dom, and friends to the kingdom of darkness and wickedness. Since the well Educating of Children, tends so much and so directly to a Peoples <HI>well doing</HI> and <HI>well being,</HI> surely those in Authority should by all proper Methods Incourage it. And whether Authority, besides providing proper Laws for the Incouragement of <HI>Schools,</HI> should not also appoint <HI>Inspectors,</HI> to see whether Children hare such Education as tends to render them Pious &amp; Useful Mem∣bers of the body Politick; is a thing (as I humbly concieve) not unworthy of conside∣ration.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Colledge.</HI> Our Fathers shewed great regard to the Glory of God, to the Spiritual and Temporal good of their Posterity in early <HI>Founding a Colledge</HI> in this Wilderness, to Edu∣cate &amp; qualify Persons (so far as such Indea∣vours can do it) for special &amp; eminent Sta∣tions and Services both in Church and State.

Not∣withstanding our <HI>cold Climate, severe Winters,</HI> and <HI>hard Labour</HI> for a livelihood; yet I reckon our <HI>Colledge</HI> has been a greater blessing, a more in∣riching Fund and Treasure to us, than all the <HI>Gold and Silver Mines</HI> of the <HI>Spanish West Indies,</HI> have been to those that possess'd them. May God long continue the <HI>Colledge,</HI> and make it a greater blessing than ever to His People. All proper Methods to countenance &amp; incourage it, agreably to the Pious purposes for which it was Founded; I think must needs be reckon'd very beneficial to this People, by all who de∣sire that they may <HI>know</HI> and <HI>do</HI> God's will.</P>

God's Will and Mens Duty, and with the strongest Arguments &amp; Motives urging Men to a compliance therewith; to hate them duly administring the Seals of God's Covenant, and maintaining the holy Discipline of His House according to the rules of his Word, tends great∣ly to the welfare of a prosessing People. It therefore tends much to their advantage, that such a Ministry should be Incourag'd Coun∣tenanc'd, and suitably Maintain'd &amp; Suppor∣ted. The granting unto faithful Ministers, such an outward Support, as that they <HI>need not Intangle themselves</HI> in the Affairs of this Life, (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2 4.) but may give themselves <HI>wholly</HI> to their Evangelical work, (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.15.) is not a matter of <HI>Almes</HI> or <HI>Charity,</HI> but a piece of <HI>Justice,</HI> a plain commanded duty. Gal. 6.6. <HI>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</HI> 1 Cor. 9.14. <HI>So hath the Lord ordained, that they which Preach the Gos∣pel should live of the Gospel.</HI> To with-hold a suf∣ficient Support from Ministers, unless where Inability is the real cause, might easily be prov'd to be <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riledge.

<P N="5">5. <HI>A Sanctifying the Sabbath.</HI> God expresly says, Exod. 20. 8. <HI>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</HI> So to improve the <HI>Sabbath</HI> as God directs, is it self one evident part or instance of holiness, and it greatly tends to promote holiness in other regards too. It has been long since remark'd, that Religion commonly thrives or decays among a People, according as the Sabbath, the Lords Day, is strictly Ob∣served &amp; Sanctifyed, or basely neglected and profaned. To keep holy the Lords Day, and to take all proper measures to prevent the Pro∣fanation of it, tends much to promote the ho∣liness &amp; happiness of a prosessing People. For the divine Oracles plainly testifie, That a Peo∣ple are expos'd to heavy Judgment, by abusing and prosaning Gods holy day. Neh 13, 17, 18. <HI>— What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day? did not your Fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by pro∣faning the Sabbath,</HI> Jer. 17.21—27. I think these things that have been mention'd, evi∣dently tend to promote <HI>good Knowledge</HI> &amp; <HI>holy Obedience,</HI> in a prosessing People. And as Ru∣lers should indeavour, that their People may <HI>do Good,</HI> may <HI>Obey &amp; please God.</HI> So they should Indeavour,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="20" REF="001861_0022_0FB91F1557AC5938"/>2. <HI>That they may Injoy Good.</HI> That is, they should Indeavonr that their People may be safely protected in their Persons Liberties, Pro∣perties; that they may not be Molested, Dis∣turbed, Injured in any of the Rights. Possessions, Comforts belonging to them. They should Indeavour, that they may be thus Protected, not only from open and <HI>Common Enemies</HI>; but also from being <HI>Injur'd by one another.</HI> It was sad with Israel, when <HI>there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the Inhabitants of the Coun∣tries,</HI> 2 Chron.15.5. On the other hand, it's mentioned as a great blessing of wise King <HI>So∣lomon</HI>'s Reign: 1 King.4.25. <HI>And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his Vine and under his Fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>a, all the days of Solomon.</HI> Thro'out the whole King∣dom, the People dwelt in Peace and Safety; under their <HI>Vines and Fig-trees,</HI> that is, they peaceably follow'd their own business, Im∣proved and Injoy'd their own Estates, none disturbing them in any of the Rights &amp; Privi∣ledges belonging to them. Long after this, 'twas Prophesi'd &amp; Promised as a great blessing, Mic.4.4. <HI>They shall sit every man under his Vine and under his Fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid.</HI> Indeed, civil Rulers should Indeavour, that their People may be thus safe &amp; quiet:
<PB N="21" REF="001861_0023_0FB91F16EC9D3420"/>
<HI>That they may lead a quiet &amp; peacealle life; in all Godliness &amp; Honestly,</HI> 1 Tim.2.1. Rulers should Indeavour, that their People may live <HI>in all Godliness &amp; Honesty,</HI> ('tis their duty so live,) and that they may Injoy <HI>Peace &amp; Quietness</HI> (be undisturb'd, unmolested) in their so living, this is a benefit &amp; priviledge that of right belongs to them.</P>
<P>And as Rulers should Indeavour, that their People may both <HI>Do good</HI> and <HI>Injoy good</HI>; so,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They should Indeavour to make good Laws, and to see them well Executed, in order here-unto.</HI> The having and well executing of good Laws, is absolutely necessary in order to a Peoples welfare.

to be some few days without any Govern∣ment at all, every one doing what he pleased; that by the great Villanies committed by the more prosligate in that short space, the Peo∣ple might the more highly prize Order and Government, and the more readily submit thereto</Q>. Tho' <HI>Tyranny</HI> is burden some and <HI>bateful,</HI> yet it's counted a <HI>smaller evil</HI> than meer <HI>Anarchy,</HI> and confusion. Such are the Lusts and Corruptions of Mens hearts, that 'tis not to be suppos'd any considerable number of them, should live peaceably and vertuosly in Society, without having good Laws and them well Executed. It's therefore much for the good and welfare of a processing People to have good Laws, and to have due care taken to see them well Executed; even Laws, (I) <HI>To Incourage Piety &amp; Vertue.</HI> (2) <HI>To discounge all manner of Vice &amp; Wickedness.</HI> (3) <HI>To maintain Justice &amp; Equity between man &amp; man.</HI> (4.) <HI>To protect the Subject, in their Liberties &amp; Properties.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>To Incourage Piety &amp; Vertue.</HI> It's the un∣deniabie Duty &amp; Interest of particular Per∣sons, and so of an whole prosessing People (as we shew'd before) to understand Gods revea∣led preceptive Will, and heartily &amp; practically to conform thereto. Humane Laws therefore among such a People should Countenance &amp; Incourage, the spreading of good Christian

Knowledge, the owning &amp; prosessng of Gods Truths and Ways; the Serving &amp; Worshipping of God in all the Ways, Means. Ordinances of His appointment. The Laws should coun∣tenance and incourage, the duties of <HI>Sobriety, Temperance Chastity, Deligence &amp; lndustry, Honesty, Justice, Righteousness, Charity</HI>; Indeed they should countenance <HI>every thing that's various &amp; praise∣worthy</HI>: every thing that's <HI>Holy, Just &amp; Good.</HI> The Apostle speakjng of <HI>Civil Rulers, says,</HI> 1 Pet. 2 14. <HI>They are for the praise of them that do well.</HI> Rom. 13 3, 4. <HI>Do that which it good and thou shalt have praise of the same, for he is the Mi∣nister of God to thee for Good.</HI> The <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> is call'd <HI>God's Minister,</HI> God be trust him with Power; surely then such Power, should be Imploy'd for God, to promote His Interest and Glory; and therefore to promote Goodness, Piety, Vertue in Men. Vertuous actions, and the doers of them, are to be countenanc'd, prais'd, commended. <HI>The King's favour is to∣ward a wise Servant: but his wrath is against him that canseth shame,</HI> Prov. 14.35. <HI>David</HI> said, Psal. 101.6. <HI>Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful in the Land, that they may dwell with me: he that walk∣eth in a perfect way he shall serve me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To discourage all manner of Vice &amp; Wicked∣ness.</HI> Men can't look immediately, into one another hearts, and so can't punish the sins that
<PB N="24" REF="001861_0026_0FB91F1C958B78F0"/>
are there, unless they break forth in Words of Actions. But humane Laws among proses∣sing People, should as much as possible; dls∣courage all known Vice and Wickedness in Words &amp; Actions, Such as <HI>prosane Cursing and Swearing, Blasphenning God's Holy Name prosaning His Holy Day; Disobedience, Parents, Masters and other lawful Superiors; Murders, Adulteries, For∣nications Drunkenness, Thests Robberies, Injustice, Opression, Ejing, Slandring, Perjuries,</HI> &amp;c In∣deed every thing that's Vicious and Wicked, should to the utmost be Discourag'd by Au∣thority. If gross Offenders are not suitably punished, this neglect is dangerous to them and others. Eccl. 8.11. <HI>Because sentence against an evil work, is not executed speedily, therefore the bears of the sons of the men is fully set in them to do evil.</HI> And a <HI>little Leaven, Leavens the whole lump.</HI> God's Word says concerning the Civil Magistrate, <HI>He is for the punishment of evil Doers,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.14. <HI>He is a terror to evil works—for it thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for be beareth not the Sword is vain: for he is a Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil,</HI> Rom. 13.2, 4. The Civil Magistrate is God's Minister, God has put a <HI>Sword</HI> of Power and Justice in∣to his hand, to protect Well doers, and execute Wrath and Vengeance on evil doers. Surely he that has this Sword of God in his hand,
<PB N="25" REF="001861_0027_0FB91F1E14EE5660"/>
should imploy it against God's Enemies, against the works of the Flesh &amp; of the Devil; against all open Vice &amp; Wickedness, which are Ene∣mies to God's Authority, Crown and Dignity. <HI>A King that sitteth in the throne of judgment, scat∣tereth away all evil with his eyes. A wise King scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them,</HI> Prov. 20.8, 26. <HI>Moses</HI> once said, Exod. 32.26. <HI>—Who is on the Lords side</HI>?

Verily, those who are arm'd with God's Sword, should help a∣gainst His Enemies, against the works of Dark∣ness and Wickedness; and they'l greatly en∣danger themselves if they do not. For <HI>Cursed is he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully,</HI> Jer. 48.10.

Thou art false to the charge God gives, and to the trust He reposeth in thee, if thou dost not im∣ploy <HI>his Sword</HI> against His <HI>daring Enemies,</HI> even <HI>gross Transgressions.</HI> Indeed the primary intent of <HI>Penalties</HI> threaten'd in the Law, is not that they should be Executed, but to <HI>Prevent</HI> the Crimes which deserve them; but if Persons won't be afraid of the Civil Power, (Rom. 13 3. <HI>Wilt thou not then he afraid of the Power</HI>?) but will dare to Transgress; then the Sword is to be unsheath'd to punish them. Such Pu∣nishments on Offenders, are needful for the Publick good; that others may <HI>hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly,</HI> Deut. 13.10, 11. Unpunish'd Crimes are hardening to the Guilty, insnaring to the Innocent.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To maintain Justice &amp; Equity between Man and Man.</HI> Good Laws and a due Execution of them, are needful for this end. Right &amp; E∣quity should be maintain'd between Man and Man, none should be suffer'd to wrong or in∣jure others. The Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> said to <HI>So∣lomon,</HI> 1 King. 10.9,—<HI>Because the Lord loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee King, to do Judgment and Justice.</HI> It's a token of God's fa∣vour to a People, when He sets over them such as will see Judgment and Justice executed a∣mong them.

In matters of dispute &amp; controversy, Justice and Equity should take place, without any partial regards to high or low, rich or poor. <HI>Doing nothing by partiality,</HI> 1 Tim. 5.21. The <HI>Wisdom</HI> which is from above, <HI>is without partiality,</HI> Jam. 3.17. <HI>Ye shall do no unrighteousness in Judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou Judge thy neighbour,</HI> Lev. 19.15. When matters come to be try'd, a rich or mighty Man should not be favour'd for fear of displea∣sing him, nor injur'd or fin'd because he's bet∣ter able to bear it than some others; nor should a poor Man be crush'd, because he's weak &amp; possibly uncapable of revenge, nei∣ther should he be pitied &amp; irregularly favour'd because he is low: no, but Justice &amp; Equity should run in a right line. There should be no respect had to persons, but only to causes, in matters of Judgment. Deut. 1.16, 17. <HI>—Hear

the causes between your Brethren, and Judge righte∣ously between every Man and his Brother, and the Stranger that it with him. Ye shall not respect per∣sons in Judgment, but you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the Judgment is God's.</HI> Prov 18.5. <HI>It is not good to accept the person of the wicked</HI> (whe∣ther he be high or low) <HI>to overthrow the righ∣teous in Judgment. He that Justifieth the wicked, and be that Condemneth the Just, even they both are an abomination to the Lord,</HI> Prov 17.15. Amos 5.24. <HI>Let Judgment run down as waters, &amp; Righ∣teousness as a mighty Stream.</HI> Justice, Righteous Judgment, should be as a mighty Scream or Torrent of waters, that bears down all before it; that wont be stop'd or diverted in it's course.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>To protect the Subject in their Liberties and Properties.</HI> Such Protection (as we've shew'd already) is imply'd in <HI>Feeding</HI> &amp; <HI>Guiding</HI> them; and good Laws &amp; the due Execution of them, are needful in order to it. All should be pro∣tected in the Liberties, Priviledges, Properties belonging to them; if any are Injur'd therein, the next best thing is, to have them righted &amp; relieved as far as possible. Therefore those who craftily or violently wrong others, should be punish'd; &amp; the Injured should be relieved. God said to Civil Rulers: Psal. 82.2, 3, 4. <HI>How long will ye Judge unjustly; and accept the persons
<PB N="29" REF="001861_0031_0FB91F2654CB68F8"/>
of the wicked? Defend the poor &amp; fatherless: do Justice to be afflicted &amp; needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</HI> Isai. 1.17. <HI>Learn to do well, seek Judgment, relieve the Oppressed, Judge the Fatherless, plead for the Widow.</HI> Jer. 22 3. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, execute ye Judgment &amp; Righteousness, and deliver tie spoiled out of the band of the Oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the Stranger, the Fatherless nor the Widow, neither shed Innocent blood in this piece.</HI> Agreably hereto, we find that <HI>Job</HI> speaking of himself as <HI>Judge,</HI> say, Job 29.17. <HI>I brake the Jaws of the wicked, and pluck'd the spoil out of his teeth.</HI> He compares Injurious Oppressors to <HI>Beasts of prey,</HI> and declares that he brake their strong Jaws, and so rescu'd those that were likely to be devoured by them. Deut. 27.19. <HI>Cursed he be that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless and widow, and all the People shall say, Amen.</HI> But there is a <HI>Blessing for the</HI> contrary: <HI>The King that faithfully judgeth the poor, hit throne shall be established for ever,</HI> Prov. 29.14</P>
<P>These things may suffice for the First Pro∣position, viz. <HI>Those who are in Civil Government among a Professing People of God, should Feed and Guide them.</HI> They should do their utmost, to promote their good and welfare. When <HI>Ne∣hemiah</HI> was come as <HI>Governour</HI> over the <HI>Jews,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="001861_0032_0FB91F27D5079738"/>
after their return from <HI>Babylon,</HI> 'tis said, Neh. 2.10. <HI>— There was come a man to seek the wel∣fare of the children of Israel.</HI> So when <HI>Mordecai</HI> the Jew had great Power and Authority, 'tis said, <HI>he was accepted of the multitude of his Bre∣thren, seeking the Wealth of his People,</HI> Esth. 10.3.</P>

<P>This refers to the <HI>Internal Qualifications</HI> of those in Authority, and plainly Imports, that they should Sincerely, Heartily, Unseigned∣ly Endeavour so to Govern their People; as to promote their true Obedience to God, and so their Safety and Happiness in His Fa∣vour. For <HI>happy is that People whose God is the Lord,</HI> Psal. 144.15.

The great Creator, the supream Lawgiver and Judge of all requires, that those who Rule Men, should do it in the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> Tho' they are as Gods, being Superiours among Men (<HI>Psal.</HI> 82.1. <HI>Job.</HI> 10.34, 35) yet they are Inferiour to God, Impower'd by Him, Act for Him, are Accountable to Him; therefore they should act agreably to the Rules He gives, and should <HI>Fear</HI> to Transgress them.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Reinolds</HI> says, <Q><HI>Plato</HI> would have the <HI>Palaces of Princes</HI> joined unto <HI>Temples,</HI> to note, that Government and Religion, Prayer and Justice, the Word and Sword should never be severed</Q>.</P>
<P>We find that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> advanc'd a Person to a considerable Trust and Charge, because <HI>he was a faithful Man, &amp; feared God above many,</HI> Neh. 7, 2. The more any have of the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in their Hearts, so much the more Faith∣fully they will discharge the Trust, and per∣form the Duties of the Post or Station they are placed in. Serious and Solemn were the Words of that Godly King <HI>Jehosaphat,</HI> to those ap∣pointed to be <HI>Judges</HI> among the People, 2 Chron. 19 9, 10. <HI>And be charged them saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

and Commandment, Statutes and Judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the Lord, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your Brethren: this do and ye shall not trespass.</HI> He urges them to <HI>Fear God,</HI> as the best Motive to make them <HI>Faithful</HI> to Men. Our Saviours Parable tells of a Judge, who <HI>feared not God, neither regarded Man,</HI> Luk. 18.2. If he did not <HI>Fear God,</HI> fear his own Supream Judge, it's no wonder that he did not <HI>Regard Men,</HI> so as to do Justice unto them. You that have any thing to do in this Days <HI>Election,</HI> in this Session of the <HI>General Court,</HI> or in any Station of Government at any time; See that you do it in the <HI>Fear of God</HI>; heartily aim at his Glory, and His Peo∣ples Good, for he observes all your <HI>Actions,</HI> your <HI>Aims</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> in them, and you are Ac∣countable to Him therefor. Rulers then should be <HI>Fearers of God,</HI> Men of Religion, Men of Principles and Conscience; such as by the holy Awe and Fear of the Great GOD, are restrained from gratifying their own Lusts and Humours, though they have Power in their hand to do it. They should be as much for <HI>Ethicks</HI> as <HI>politicks.</HI> That Godly Gover∣nour <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> did not follow the <HI>Ill Examples</HI> his Predecessors had set before him; and he gives this Account of the matter, Neh. 5.15. <HI>—So did not I, because of the Fear of God.</HI></P>

So, they should be Men of <HI>Truth,</HI> that is, Men of <HI>Fidelity and Veracity</HI>; not so False and De∣ceitful in their Words, as that there's no de∣pending on what they say. <HI>David</HI> was such a Man of Truth, such a Lover of Honesty, Fidelity, Veracity, that he said, Psal. 101.7. <HI>He that worketh Deceit, shall not dwell within mine house: he that telleth Lies shall not tarry in my sight.</HI> He would not have such paltry Fellows about him. <HI>Solomon</HI> says, Prov 29.12. <HI>If a Ru∣ler hearken to Lyes, all his Servants are wicked.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Their being Sober and Temperate.</HI> Intem∣perate or Excessive Drinking, renders Persons unfit indeed for any rational Managements or Undertakings; especially for such Weigh∣ty and Important ones, as those of Rule and Government are. Persons had need be intire∣ly in their Wits, in the most lively, vigorous use of right Reason, who are engag'd in the weighty Affairs of Government. <HI>Gluttony &amp; Drunkenness</HI> must needs unfit Persons for such Business. Part of the Advice of King <HI>Lemu∣el</HI>'s Pious Mother, was that, Prov. 3I.4, 5. <HI>It is not for Kings, O Lemuel, it is not for Kings to drink wine, nor for Princes, strong drink; left they drink and forget the Law, and pervert the Judg∣ment of any of the Afflicted.</HI> So Eccl. 10.16, 17. <HI>Wo to thee, O Land, when thy King is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the morning. Blessed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due season, for strength and not for Drunkenness.</HI> It's mention'd as a great Un∣happiness and Wickedness, Hos. 5.7. <HI>In the day

of our King, the Princes have made him sick with bottles of wine, he stretched out his hand with Scorners.</HI> If Rulers (of what Rank or Degree soever) indulge themselves in Excessive Drinking, no wonder if they soon act as Scorners, Proudly, Foolishly, Wickedly, as mean, base and vile Creatures. <HI>Intemperance</HI> unfits Persons not only for the Pulpit, but also for the Council Board, the Seat or Trybunal of <HI>Justice,</HI> and indeed for every thing that's Great, Noble and Generous.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Their being Just, and hating of Covetousness.</HI> I put these two together, as being necessarily connected; for it's almost, if not altogether impossible, for Men to be Just and Righteous in Ruling and Governing, unless they are Self-denying, and haters of Covetousness. These Qualifications in Rulers, are abundant∣ly Recommended and Required in Scripture, <HI>Exod.</HI> 18.21.— Men of Truth, <HI>hating Cove∣tousness.</HI> If Men don't <HI>hate Covetousness,</HI> it's not to be expected they'll be <HI>Men of Truth,</HI> Just and Faithful to <HI>their Word</HI>; for they'll Trick, Falsifie and Deceive, for the sake of <HI>Money</HI>; the <HI>love</HI> of which is the <HI>root of all Evil,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.10. <HI>He that rulethover Men must be Just,</HI> 2 Sam. 23.3. <HI>The Prince that wanteth understanding, is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth Cove∣tousness, shall prolong his days.</HI> Prov. 28.16. <HI>Job</HI>

speaking of himself as <HI>Judge</HI> says, Job 29.14. <HI>I put on Righteousness and it cloathed me: my Judgment was a Robe and a Diadem.</HI> Righte∣ousness Cloath'd and Encompass'd him, ap∣peared in his whole Conduct as a Ruler; it was as conspicuousin his Conduct, as the Rai∣ment he wore; he reckon'd it his <HI>Crown and Diadem,</HI> Honour and Glory, to do <HI>Justice and Judgment</HI> impartially, in all Cases he had to do with. But if Rulers are Covetous, gree∣dy of Filthy Lucre, hungring and thirsting after all they can get of the World; this will probably prompt them, to various methods of Injustice and Unrighteousness. What vile, griping oppressive <HI>Tricks</HI> are often us'd by <HI>Officers</HI> (in various Stations) when they have no Principle of <HI>Justice</HI> to sway them? The Scripture is abundantly plain in this matter, Exod. 23.6.-8. <HI>Thou shalt not wrest the Judgment of thy poor in his Cause. Keep thee far from a false matter: and the Innocent and the Righteous slay thou not; for I will not justify the wicked</HI> (and that they might comply with these Precepts, God further says to them) <HI>and thou shalt take no gift, for the gift blindeth the wise, and pervert∣eth the words of the righteons;</HI> Prov. 17.23. <HI>Samu∣el,</HI> as a <HI>Ruler and Judje,</HI> observ'd these things, and Appeal'd to the People, and was Justifed by them. 1 Sam, 12.3, 4. <HI>Behold, here I am, wit∣ness

They soon made the People Justly weary of their Managements, And no won∣der, when they acted so plainly contrary to God's express Commands: Deut. 16.18—20. <HI>Judges and Officers shalt thou make thee in all thy Gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thro'cut all thy Tribes: and they shall judge the People with just Judgment. Thou shalt not wrest Judgment, thou shalt not respect Persons, neither take a Gift; for a Gift doth blind the eyes of the Wise, and per∣vert the words of the Righteous. That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayst live and inherit the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</HI> Their not taking <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Bribes,</HI> their doing Justly and Righteously, was pro∣posed as a method to <HI>prolong their Prosperity;</HI>

but the contrary hereto, procures Judgments. It was part of God's Charge against his Pro∣sessing People the Jews, Isai. 1.23. <HI>Thy Prin∣ces are Rebellious and Companions of Thieves; every one loveth Gifts, &amp; followeth after Rewards: they judge not the Fatherless, neither doth the Cause of the Widow come before them.</HI> The <HI>Poor,</HI> the <HI>Fatherless</HI> and <HI>Widow,</HI> that could bring no Bribes or Gifts, could have no Justice done them. There's much the like Charge, Amos 5.12. <HI>For I know your manifold Transgressions, and your mighty Sins: they affict the Just, they take a Bribe, and they turn aside the Poor in the Gate from their right.</HI> These things provoke God's Wrath, but the contrary leads to the obtaining of His Favour. Prov. 15.17. <HI>He that is greedy of Gain, troubleth his own house: but he that hateth Gifts shall live. It is an abominati∣on to Kings to commit wickedness: for the Throne is established by Righteousness,</HI> Prov. 16.12. Prov. 24 4. <HI>The King; by Judgment stablisheth the Land: but he that receiveth Gifts overthroweth it.</HI> Isai. 33.15, 16. <HI>He that walketh righteously, and speak∣eth uprightly, he that despiseth the Gain of Oppressi∣ons, that shaketh his hands from holding of Bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of Blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing of Evil, he shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the Munitions of Rocks, Bread shall be given him, his Waters fall be sure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="001861_0041_0FB91F3EB400AEE0"/>It seems needless to add any thing further on this Head, only just to hint; That the more Just and Righteous Rulers are, so much the more likely the People will be, <HI>to fear and obey</HI> (as well as love) <HI>them.</HI> When <HI>Solomon</HI> acted <HI>Justly</HI> as well as <HI>Wisely</HI> in the contest between the <HI>Two Harlots,</HI> 'tis said, 1 King. 3.28. <HI>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the King had judged, &amp; They</HI> FEARED <HI>the King: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.</HI></P>

King <HI>David</HI> by his <HI>Example</HI> as well as <HI>Counsel,</HI> shewed regard to the <HI>Ark</HI> (and to the <HI>Worship</HI>) of God, (2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6.14, 17.) and also furthered <HI>the building of the Temple,</HI> 1 Chron. 29 <HI>chap.</HI> If Rulers are vicious in their Practice, it's not very probable that their good Laws should do much good; they should set <HI>good Examples</HI> as well as make good Laws. <HI>Alphon∣sus</HI> was wont to say, <Q>Those who Govern, ought to be as much <HI>better</HI> than <HI>Private Persons,</HI> as they are <HI>above</HI> them in <HI>Honour and Dignity</HI>; reckoning, that then the Man∣ners of the People would be well formed, when <HI>Rulers</HI> are of a <HI>blameless Behaviour,</HI> and are a <HI>living Example of all Vertue</HI></Q>.</P>

<P N="1">I. <HI>Their being well acquainted with the Religious Interests of their People.</HI> We have plainly prov'd already, that it's both the Duty and Interest of a Professing People, to obey God, to walk in His Wayes, to serve and worship Him ac∣cording to the Directions He has given in His Word. Rulers should quicken and further their People, in thus Serving and Worshipping God; therefore they themselves had need be well acquainted, with what God's Word re∣quires as to the Worship &amp; Service to be yield∣ed to Him. God therefore required, that the King of Israel should <HI>write out a Copy of the Di∣vine Law, and read therein all his days</HI>; that he might <HI>learn to fear the Lord, and keep all the words of his Law,</HI> Deut. 17.18. <HI>Joshua</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> were required(the former immediately by God, the latter by <HI>David</HI> the Man after God's own Heart) to <HI>act according to what written in the Law of Moses,</HI> that so they might prosper, <HI>Josh.</HI> I.6—8. 1 King, 2.I.—3. The more strictly a professing People adhere to the Rules of God's giving (and not of Mens) in Wor∣shipping God (as well as in other parts of their

conduct) so much the more they're like to prosper. Rulers therefore should be well ac∣quainted with the true Religious Interests of their People, and should encourage and pro∣mote them as much as they can. It's well known, that <HI>the main design of our Fathers coming into this Wilderness was, that they might peaceably and quietly Worship God, and manage the affairs of His House,</HI> (as to <HI>Particular Churches, Councils, Synods,</HI>) <HI>according to their best understanding of the Rules of His Word</HI> (<HI>without humane Inventions and Impositions</HI>) <HI>and that their Posterity might do so af∣ter them</HI>: and I verily believe, that the more closely we adhere to the plain Rules of Scrip∣ture in these things, so much the more God will bless us; &amp; that the more we deviate here∣from, so much the more God will depart from us. And here, whether on some General Yearly <HI>Fast</HI> or <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> a General <HI>Contribution</HI> thro' the Province, to promote the Gospel, in <HI>Small, Poor</HI> or <HI>Destitute</HI> Places, would not be for the glory of God, for the honour and furtherance of our holy Religion, I humbly submit to se∣rious Consideration. And will yet say, Mo∣nies so Collected, wisely Imploy'd, and faith∣fully Accounted for, would be no burthen on voluntary Contributors, but might probably do abundance of good.</P>

They should be well acquainted with the various sorts of <HI>Trade, Business, Imployment</HI> to be follow∣ed by the People; that so the same may be the better <HI>Directed, Protected, Encouraged.</HI> And the more they know of the <HI>Scituation, Strength, Trade, Designs</HI> of <HI>Neighbouring Nations or People</HI>; so much the better able they'll be, to care for and promote, the good &amp; welfare of their own People. Indeed the more thro'ly acquainted they are with all the Circumstances of their People; so much the more easily they may observe, what would be for their Publick and General Advantage or Disadvantage. For Ru∣lers should always consult the <HI>Publick and Ge∣neral good</HI> of their People; and prefer it to the consideration of all <HI>particular, private, or perso∣nal Interests</HI> whatsoever. <HI>Topping Favourites</HI> or <HI>Particular Interests,</HI> should never be cherish'd in any regard, to the Damage of the Publick. He that prefers any private advantage to the Publick good, deserves rather to be called <HI>Pro∣ditor,</HI> than <HI>Pater patria,</HI> he's rather a <HI>Traitor</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="001861_0052_0FB91F52949DC948"/>
than a <HI>Patron,</HI> a <HI>Betrayer</HI> than a <HI>Father</HI> of his <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Their due observing the general Temper, Dis∣position &amp; Behaviour of their People.</HI> The <HI>know∣ing of Men,</HI> the observing their usual Temper, Inclinations, Abilities, Practices; renders it the more easy to take proper steps to promote their true Welfare and Advantage.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Their being Studious, Wakeful, Watchful to promote their Peoples Welfare.</HI> Rulers are called <HI>Gods,</HI> (Psal 82.6.) and surely they should <HI>not slumber nor sleep,</HI> so as to neglect their Duty or their Peoples Good. Indeed thePublick Wel∣fare should lie upon their <HI>Hearts,</HI> their <HI>Minds,</HI> they should <HI>study, think, contrive</HI> how to promote it. They should be wakeful, &amp; watchful as far as may be to <HI>foresee Evils</HI> and <HI>prevent</HI> them. (This is one Instance of <HI>Prudence,</HI> Prov. 22.3.) to <HI>foresee Advantages</HI> for the Publick Good, and to lay hold of them. They should be watch∣ful, when a <HI>Gap</HI> is made (in one regard or o∣ther, as to the Peace and Welfare of the Peo∣ple) to have it well stop'd as soon as may be, least it grow wider. Watchful in a time of Peace, and when they have leisure, to prepare and provide for their own safety, if War should arise. King <HI>Asa,</HI> thought 'twas good Policy to do so, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 14.6, 7. Rulers should be <HI>Watchmen,</HI> &amp; keep a constant careful look out,
<PB N="51" REF="001861_0053_0FB91F541496B4C8"/>
to prevent the damage &amp; promote the advan∣tage of the Publick They should be skilful wary Physicians, to observe what Symptoms attend the Body Politick; to observe critical Junctures, that they may make proper Appli∣cations.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Their being Cautious, Inquisitive, ready to ask and take good Advice.</HI> Tho' it's good to have a great presence of Mind, wife &amp; proper some∣times to act speedily upon sudden Emergen∣cies; yet nothing should be done rashly. Our Saviour plainly intimates (instancing in the matters of <HI>Building</HI> and <HI>Warring</HI>) that <HI>serious deliberation</HI> should preceed <HI>great undertakings,</HI> Luk 14 28.—32. Therefore to <HI>ask, inquire, hear</HI> what can properly be said in weighty mat∣ters, seems one wife &amp; good step towards the right managing of them. <HI>With the well-advised is wisdom,</HI> Prov. 13.10. <HI>He that hearkeneth un∣to counsel is wise,</HI> Prov. 12.15. <HI>Better is a poor and wise Child, than an old and foolish King who will no more be admonished,</HI> Eccl. 4.13. <HI>Without counsel, purposes are disappointed: but in the multi∣tude of counsellours they are established,</HI> Prov. 15.22. <HI>Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make War,</HI> Prov. 20.18. And as 'tis wisdom in Rulers, to ask &amp; take good ad∣vice; so 'tis weakness &amp; folly to follow wicked advice and counsel. It's said of <HI>Ahaziah</HI> King
<PB N="52" REF="001861_0054_0FB91F5695853760"/>
of Judah, <HI>his Mother was his counsellor to do wick∣edly. Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord, like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his Father, to his destruction,</HI> 2 Chron. 22. 1, — 4</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>Their Praying to God for Direction, as well as for Assistance and Success in their Affairs.</HI> Such Prayerfulness, shows their <HI>Skill</HI> as well as <HI>Inte∣grity.</HI> God is the Father of Lights, Wisdom and Counsel are His; and He has said, Jam. 1. 5. <HI>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally &amp; upbraideth not: and it shall be given him.</HI> Rulers therefore (as well as others) should Pray, that God would Counsel, Direct and Guide them in all their Affairs; especially in such as are most weigh∣ty, intricate and difficult: when <HI>they know not what to do, their eyes</HI> (like King <HI>Johosophat</HI>'s) <HI>should be unto God,</HI> 2 Chron. 20. 12. We find that Skilful <HI>David,</HI> in his arduous and difficult cases, pray'd to God for direction, for lead∣ing and guidance; so he did concerning his <HI>danger</HI> at <HI>Keilah,</HI> 1 Sam. 23. 10, — 12. So he pray'd, that God would show him what course he should take, when he had heard of <HI>Saul</HI>'s Death, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 1. So, again &amp; again he pray'd to God for direction, about fighting against the <HI>Philistines,</HI> 2 Sam. 19. 22, 23. If Rulers would act Skilfully, then let them fer∣vently
<PB N="53" REF="001861_0055_0FB91F57D4AC9658"/>
Pray to God for guidance &amp; assistance, in all their managements; more especially in those most weighty &amp; perplex'd.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Their being sollicitous to maintain the Honour of Government.</HI> If Rulers by their own vicious and <HI>Scandalous practices,</HI> or by knowingly <HI>indul∣ging the like in others</HI>; if by their <HI>Supine sloth</HI> and <HI>negligence,</HI> their <HI>unwatchfulness</HI> their <HI>ungovern'd passions,</HI> their <HI>partiality,</HI> their <HI>trampling on the Poor,</HI> and <HI>fawning on the Rich,</HI> their severely <HI>punishing those Crimes in the Small</HI> which they <HI>wink at in the Great</HI>; their <HI>suffering the Laws to be violated, themselves tamely to be buff'd &amp; insulted</HI> by bold, daring, insolent Transgressors; I say, if by these or any such Methods, they lay themselves open to <HI>despis'd, contemn'd</HI> &amp; meanly esteem'd of, then indeed they show but little Skilfulness in their Station. If Rulers once come to be generally despis'd amp; slighted, then the whole Fabrick totters, &amp; forebodes a total overthrow and universal confusion then (like the <HI>croak∣ing Frogs</HI> in the Fable) every <HI>huffing Bullie</HI> will strive to get <HI>uppermost,</HI> fearless of any check or danger. Those therefore in Authority (how∣ever meek &amp; humble personally as Christians) should endeavour to keep up the Honour, Dignity and Reverence due to the Character they wear, and to the Post &amp; Station they're fixed in. And the best way to do this, is by
<PB N="54" REF="001861_0056_0FB91F5A239B6310"/>
a religious, sober, vertuous life; by shewing great and steady prudence, zeal, justice, up∣rightness, and vigorous Application in the work of those Stations they're fixed in. To keep a strait rein, and a steady moderate pace, is the likeliest method to avoid stumbling and to bring the Traveller seasonably to his Jour∣ney's end. If they would be rightly Honour'd in their place, then they should <HI>despise vile Per∣sons</HI> (frown on, not so much as Company with the lewd vicious &amp; profane tho' never so great or rich) <HI>and honour them that fear the Lord,</HI> Psal. 15.4. They should <HI>Honour God,</HI> then <HI>He'l Honour them</HI>; but if they <HI>despise Him, they shall be lightly esteemed,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.30.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Their being Sollicitous to prevent Parties, Factions, Divisions among their People</HI> Rulers should consuly the good of the whole, the Pub∣lick Universal welfare of their People; and therefore should endeavour to prevent what they can, <HI>Siding, Party making Factions &amp; Di∣visions</HI> among them, because these greatly <HI>weaken</HI> a People, &amp; expose them to great in∣conveniences. <HI>Vis unita fortior.</HI> Good Union and Agreement in a Body Politick, is their Strength and Glory; and renders them more formidable to their Adversaries. Our Blessed Redeemer tells us, that a <HI>Kingdom, City,</HI> or <HI>House divided against it self, is not like to stand,
<PB N="55" REF="001861_0057_0FB91F5C54C477A0"/>
but come to desolation,</HI> Mat. 12.25 When Par∣ties and Divisions prevail among a People, that time, strength, vigour (and often <HI>Money</HI> too) which should be imploy'd for the good of the whole; are imploy'd to weaken, cross &amp; dis∣appoint one another, and so the Publick is hurt, 'tis threatned with great damage if not utter desolation. <HI>If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another,</HI> Gal. 5.15. <HI>Be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love &amp; peace shall be with you,</HI> 2 Cor. 13.11.</P>
<P>USE.</P>
<P>We may now proceed to some Use of these things, in a few Inferences. From what has been said, we may Infer,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>These concern'd in chusing or appointing Ru∣lers among a Professing People, should Conscientiously indeavour to chuse &amp; appoint Persons of Integrity and Skilfulness.</HI> All by and finister ends, should be intirely rejected and laid aside in these mat∣ters. Persons should not be promoted or ad∣vanced, to Places of Trust or Power meerly because they're <HI>nearly Rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed,</HI> or because of <HI>special Intimacy or Friendship,</HI> or because they're <HI>of this or that particular Party</HI> in any Affair; but the thing aim'd at should be, to get Persons that are <HI>most Able and Capable, most Faithful and Upright,</HI> most likely to promote the <HI>Glory of God and the good of His People</HI>; I say, the thing aim'd
<PB N="56" REF="001861_0058_0FB91F5DD4C07060"/>
at should be, to get <HI>such Persons</HI> into those Posts of Stations that are to be fill'd up. It's dange∣rous to put Power into the hands of vicious Persons. Psal. 12.8. <HI>The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. Pythagoras</HI> (an Heathen) could say, <Q>Its as dangerous to commit Power to a wicked Man, as to put a Sword in a mad Man's Hand</Q>.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Those in Authority among a Professing People, should make Conscience of rightly imploying the Power betrusted with them.</HI> God has put <HI>Honour</HI> on them, (Psal. 75.6, 7.) in betrusting <HI>His People, His Sheep, His Jewels, His peculiar Treasure, His Chil∣dren,</HI> to their <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Government</HI>; and they can't make returns suitable to this Honour put upon them, unless they do their utmost that the People under them, may both do and enjoy Good. They're oblig'd to such endeavours from that general Precept, that <HI>as they have op∣portunity, they should do good to all men; but espe∣cially to those of the houshold of faith,</HI> Gal. 6.10. They're oblig'd to it by their <HI>Office,</HI> for they are <HI>God's Ministers for good</HI> to a People; and have the <HI>Sword of Power</HI> from God betrusted with them, to promote the Peoples welfare, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4. Notwithstanding their high Sta∣tion among Men, yet they are but <HI>Stewards</HI> under God (Mortal ones too) and must <HI>give an account to Him of their Stewardship.</HI> And happy
<PB N="57" REF="001861_0059_0FB91F5F54976490"/>
and joyful will their account be, if they wisely and faithfully imploy their Talents and Betrust∣ments, for the furthering of God's Glory, and the true welfare of His People: but dolesul and dreadful will their account be, if instead of minding these things, they neglect their Duty, and chiefly aim at gratifying their own Lusts and Corruptions.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Good Rulers among a Professing People, are a great Blessing to them.</HI> To have Persons of <HI>In∣tegrity &amp; Skilfulness, Feeding &amp; Guiding</HI> of them; must needs be much for their advantage. <HI>When the righteous are in Authority, the people rejoyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn,</HI> Prov. 29.2. It was a token of God's <HI>Love</HI> to Israel, that He made <HI>Solomon</HI> their King, <HI>to do Judgment and Justice</HI> among them, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 10.9. It was Prophesi'd and Promis'd as a <HI>Favour</HI> to God's People, Isai. 1.26. <HI>I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellours as at the begin∣ning: afterwards thou shall be called the city of righ∣teousness, the faithful city.</HI> On the Other hand, the case of a People is set forth as very deplo∣rable and wretch, when evil Men are their Rulers. <HI>When there are thrones of iniquity which frame mischief by a law, and decree unrighteous de∣crees,</HI> Psal. 94.20. Isai. 10.1. Eccl. 10.16. <HI>Wo unto thee O Land, when thy King is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the morning.</HI> In the very
<PB N="58" REF="001861_0060_0FB91F61966E2C18"/>
<HI>sinful and miserable times</HI> of the Jewish state, we read of their <HI>Princes which devis'd mischief, and gave wicked counsel,</HI> Ezek. 12.2. So Mic. 3.1.—3. <HI>—Hear I pray you, O Heads of Ja∣cob, and ye Princes of the house of Israel; is it not for you to know judgment? Who hate the good and love the evil, who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones: who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and they brake their bones, and chop them it pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the Cauldron.</HI> Surely these were sad and sorrowful times in∣deed, when they were under such wicked and cruel Rulers. It was threatned as a sore Judg∣ment, <HI>They that hate you shall reign over you,</HI> Lev. 26.17. It was another terrible threatning, <HI>Behold the Lord of Hosts doth take away from Je∣rusalem and from Judah—the Mighty man, the man of War, the Judge and the Prophet, and the Prudent &amp; the Ancient; the Captain of Fifty, and the Honourable man, &amp; the Counsellour, &amp; the cunning Artificer, &amp; the eloquent Orator. And I Will give Children to be their Princes, &amp; Babes shall rule over them. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour,</HI> Isai. 3.1.—5. When this is the case of a People, it is very wretched, wosul &amp; misera∣ble indeed. And therefore <HI>good Rulers,</HI> Per∣sons of <HI>Integrity</HI> and <HI>Skilfulness,</HI> must needs be reckon'd <HI>great Blessings</HI> to a People.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="59" REF="001861_0061_0FB91F6314A2E1F8"/>4. <HI>People should highly value, &amp; carry it well to such Rulers.</HI> They should highly value them because they are Ministers of God to them for good; and they should carry it suitably and becomingly to them. And therefore,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>They should Honour their Rulers.</HI> Rulers are <HI>Political Fathers,</HI> as such, Honour is due to them from their People. <HI>Render therefore to all their dues—Honour to whom honour,</HI> Rom. 13.7. <HI>Fear God, Honour the King,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.17. Dutiful Respect, Honour, Reverence are to be paid to them; nor should they by any means be Reproach'd, Slandred, Reviled, Exod. 22.28. <HI>Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.</HI> Eccl. 10.20. <HI>Curse not the King, no not in thy thought.</HI> God himself look'd on it as a daring Crime in <HI>Aaron &amp; Miriam,</HI> that they vented their <HI>hard words</HI> against <HI>Moses</HI> who was King in <HI>Jesurum,</HI> He said to them, Numb. 12.8. <HI>—Were ye nut afraid to speak against my servant Moses?</HI> The Spirit of God numbers among very <HI>great and heinous Transgressors,</HI> those who <HI>despise Government, &amp; speak evil of Dignities,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.10. It's very criminal to lay false charges on any, especially on those in Authority; this is very criminal in its self, and tends to do a∣bundance of mischief. Nay further still, those in Authority are but Men (tho' called <HI>God's,</HI> they shall <HI>die like Men,</HI> Psal. 82.6, 7.) they're
<PB N="60" REF="001861_0062_0FB91F6494ACE478"/>
liable to failings and infirmities; and if thro' inadvertency they do slip, &amp; take some wrong step, yet if it's evident that their main ende∣avour is to promote the Peoples good, &amp; not to hurt them in any thing; even such <HI>slips</HI> should not be needlesly publish'd or aggrava∣ted: Children should rather strive to cover, than expose their Fathers nakedness.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>People should obey the lawful Commands of those in Authority over them.</HI> God is the God of Order and not of Confusion: Civil Go∣vernment is of Divine Institution; I don't now mean any one particular form of it, so as to ex∣clude others. But it's necessary for the good of Mankind, that Civil Government be up∣held among them: and God requires, that Ci∣vil Authority should be Obeyed. <HI>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist, shall receive to themselves Damnation. — Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath but alfo for conscience sake,</HI> Rom. 13.1, 2, 5. <HI>Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the King as Supream, or unto Governours as to them that are sent by him,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. <HI>My son, fear thou the Lord and the King; &amp; meddle not with them that are given
<PB N="61" REF="001861_0063_0FB91F688BADCEA0"/>
to change,</HI> Prov. 24.21. A <HI>Mutinous, Mobbing, Rebellious</HI> spirit, is hateful in any, and should be hateful to all, Christians. Yea, Ministers of the Gospel should Exhort their People, to such an obedient carriage and behaviour to∣wards their Rulers. Tit. 3.1. <HI>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities &amp; powers, to obey Ma∣gistrates, to be ready to every good work.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>People should readily grant an honourable Re∣ward, to Rulers who faithfully &amp; diligently indea∣vour their good &amp; welfare.</HI> When Rulers faith∣fully exert themselves, imploy their time and abilities for the good of the Publick; it is but a piece of natural Justice and Equity, that the People should give them an <HI>Honourable Reward</HI> for it. It's true in this case, as well as in o∣thers, <HI>the Labourer is worthy of his reward,</HI> 1 Tim. 5.18. <HI>Render therefore unto Caesar, the things that are Caesars,</HI> Mat. 22 21. <HI>For this cause pay you Tribute also, for they are God's Ministers attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom,</HI> Rom. 13.6, 7.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>People should make Conscience of Praying for their Rulers.</HI> The work of Rulers, is Great, Weighty, Important; 'tis hard and difficult, often attended with many Discouragements, as well as with dangerous Snares &amp; Temptati∣ons; indeed much Wisdom &amp; Grace, <HI>Integrity</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="001861_0064_0FB91F69D4DC0AC8"/>
and <HI>Skilfulness</HI> are needful for them, in order to their right imploying the Power betrusted with them. Sometimes, wrong steps, misma∣nagements in Rulers, may bring great incon∣veniences, yea heavy Judgments upon the whole People. King <HI>Saul's</HI> slaying the <HI>Gibeo∣nites,</HI> procur'd a <HI>Famine</HI> on the Land, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21.1. <HI>David's</HI> numbring the People, procur'd a <HI>Plague</HI> that destroy'd <HI>Scores of Thousands</HI> of them, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.15. Yea the <HI>Sins of a People,</HI> may provoke God to leave their Rulers to take such unhappy steps. <HI>The Anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, &amp; he moved David a∣gainst them, to say, go number Israel &amp; Judah,</HI> 2 Sam. 24.I. Seeing these things are so, surely People should make Conscience of Praying for their Rulers, that God would not leave them to any wrong steps or manage∣ments; but that He would fill them with Wis∣dom, Courage, Conduct, with <HI>Skilfulness</HI> and <HI>Integrity,</HI> with great steadiness of Mind; and that He would help them rightly to imploy their betrusted Powers; that He would Bless them, and make them great Blessings to their People. If there were less Reviling of, &amp; more servent Praying for, Rulers; 'twould often be much better for a People. 1 Tim. 2.1, 2. <HI>I will therefore that first of all, Supplications, Prayers, In∣tercessions &amp; giving of thanks be made for all men:
<PB N="63" REF="001861_0065_0FB91F6B5586B630"/>
for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet &amp; peaceable life, in all godli∣ness &amp; honesty.</HI></P>
<P>And as People should make Conscience of Praying for their Rulers, so, which is another Inference,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>They should make it their chief care to please and obey God, that He may always favour them with good Rulers.</HI> Such Rulers are truly a great Blessing, and none but God (<HI>the giver of every good Gift</HI> Jam. 1.17.) can bestow or continue such a Blessing. 'Tis God alone who can <HI>qua∣lifie</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssist</HI> Persons to Rule well; or in His Providence vest them with <HI>Authority</HI> therefor. It is by Him <HI>that Kings reign &amp; Princes decree justice,</HI> Prov, 8.15. <HI>Promotion comes not from the East, West or South; but God is Judge, he puts down one &amp; sets up another,</HI> Psal, 75.6, 7. <HI>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water; he turneth it whither soever he will,</HI> Prov. 21.1. <HI>He changeth the times &amp; seasons: he re∣moveth Kings, &amp; setteth up Kings: he giveth wis∣dom to the wise, &amp; knowledge to them that know understanding,</HI> Dan. 2.21. Indeed 'tis with God in His Sovereign Providence, to bring whom He will into Authority and Govern∣ment; He also can cause the Wisdom of the Wise to perish, and make them grope at noon day as in the dark; or He, can give Wisdom
<PB N="64" REF="001861_0066_0FB91F71555EB400"/>
and Grace for the right discharge of incum∣bent Duties. Surely then, if People would injoy the great Blessing of good Rulers, they should strenuously indeavour to obey &amp; please God, who alone can favour them with so rich a Mercy. Whatever Rulers are whether good or bad; yet if the People generally are stub∣born, disobedient, rebellious against God, un∣reclaimable in ways of Wickedness; they may then expect destroying desolating Judgments from God. Tho' <HI>Noah, Daniel</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> were among them; they could not deliver or pro∣tect them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.14, 20. If they had <HI>An∣gels</HI> to Govern them; yet if they obstinately transgress; they may expect <HI>that God will re∣veal his wrath from Heaven, against their ungod∣liness and unrighteousness,</HI> Rom. 1.18. The Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI> said to Israel, 1 Sam. 12.25. <HI>If ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your King.</HI> Therefore let this whole People be Exhorted, to fear God &amp; keep His Command∣ments; this is the best Method they can possi∣bly take for their own Welfare on all ac∣counts. Isa. I.I9, 20. <HI>If ye be willing &amp; obe∣dient, ye shall eat the good of the Land. But If ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the Sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</HI></P>
<P>I shall add but one thing more, and that is,</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="65" REF="001861_0067_0FB91F7515EBF810"/>6. <HI>When a Prosessing People are favour'd with good Rulers, they should Bless God for it.</HI> Such Rulers are Gods Gift, the Receivers therefore of the Blessing, should thank God for it. Then surely, our whole Nation should hear∣tily Bless and Praise God, in that He did so <HI>Seasonably, Wonderfully, Mercifully</HI> place our Soveraign Lord KING GEORGE on the <HI>British Throne</HI>; A Prince of such Su∣perior. Distinguishing, Excelling Wisdom, Justice and Equity; so true, powerful, steady and resolute a Friend to, and Protector of, the <HI>Protestant lnterest</HI>; a Prince firmly and servently tender (of the just Liberties of Mankind, and) of the true Liberties, Safety and Prosperity of His Subjects. We should Bless GOD for setting such a Good &amp; Great KING over us, and for continuing Him on the Throne, notwithstanding the Cursed Re∣bellion rais'd against Him. When we in these remote Parts first heard of that Re∣bellion, we Pray'd (and continu'd to do so) that God would Blast and Suppress it; <HI>That He would bring the wickedness of the wicked to an and, but establish the Just</HI>; and now God has so far heard our Prayers in that matter, we should offer (as indeed we have often done already) Praises &amp; Thansgivings to Him for it. Pray GOD Establish and Long continue our
<PB N="66" REF="001861_0068_0FB91F7A38CA48C8"/>
Soveraign Lord KING GEORGE on the British Throne, as a Great &amp; Rich Blessing to all His good Subjects, and to the whole Protestant Interest; and let His remaining Enemies be cover'd with Shame and Confu∣sion. And Pray GOD <HI>Confirm the Succession</HI> as by Law Established, in the <HI>Illustrious House of HANOVER,</HI> that His Majesties Royal Issue may from Age to Age in their several Generations, be rich Blessings on the Throne, and to the Subjects, of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> We also in this Land, should be Thankful to GOD, for the good Government and Rulers we are (thro' His good Hand upon us) favoured with.
