<HEAD>A LETTER From the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Brethren in Christ,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Apostle in his Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> Chap. x. 23. Exhorts them <HI>to hold fast the Profession of their Faith without wavering;</HI> and im∣mediately adds, as a most effectual means for pro∣ducing so desirable an end, <HI>Let us consider one ano∣ther, to provoke unto Love and good Works, not for∣saking the Assembling of ourselves together.</HI></P>
<P>As Christianity was not then the National Religion, I suppose by Assembling themselves together, the Apostle does not understand open Assemblies, such as our publick Congregations, but rather little and private Societies, as was the Custom of the Primi∣tive Christians, who we are told <HI>continued in Fel∣lowship.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Apostle's Exhortation to the Christians of those Times, and I am fully perswaded there was never more occasion for renewing it than in the Age wherein we live: For nothing has of late more alarmed the Enemies of the Cross of Christ, than the Zeal which God has stirred up in the Hearts of many, to put in Practice this Apostolical Injunction.—Balls, Plays, Horse-Races and such
<PB N="4" REF="004455_0003_100DA076C8E18B58"/>
like Diabolical Entertainments are countenanced and supported by publick Authority.</P>
<P>Few if any (publickly at least) now dare to speak, preach, or write for Suppressing them so explicitly as they ought. But if the Children of God meet, as they are required, to build up each other in their most holy Faith, almost every one's Mouth is opened a∣gainst them. Nay (with grief, God is my Judge, I speak it) even most of our Masters in <HI>Israel,</HI> who ought to be Patterns and Promoters of every good Word and Work, are not content with Counte∣nancing the sinful Diversions and polite Assemblies of the Age by their Presence and Approbation, but are generally most bitter in their Invectives against Religious Societies, continually crying them down (especially if any life or divine Power appear a∣mongst them) as Schismatical and Seditious, and as Meetings which have a tendency to weaken the present established Constitution.</P>
<P>For these, and many such like Reasons, as pre∣sent with you in Spirit, tho' absent in Body, I thought it my Duty to put you in mind zealously to persist in Practising the 'forementioned Injunction once de∣livered to the Saints, and so much the more as in all probability the Day of Persecution nearer and nearer approaches.</P>
<P>There has been a gathering, undoubtedly a winnowing Time will come.—God's Fan is already in his Hand, yet a little while, and if the Work lately begun be carried on, I am persuaded he will thoroughly purge his Floor. The Shepherds first must be smitten; next endeavours exerted to scatter the Sheep. The Religious Societies, Satan no
<PB N="5" REF="004455_0004_100DA07950FE1CE8"/>
doubt has desired to have, that he may sift them as Wheat. <HI>My Brethren,</HI> Watch and Pray, that you may be counted worthy to stand in such an Hour of Temptation.</P>
<P>Religious Society is of a Divine Extraction. As God first made Man, so God first said, <HI>It is not good that Man should be alone,</HI> I <HI>will make a help meet for him.</HI>—Meet, as I take it, not meerly for his Body (Man had but few Corporal wants in Paradise) but chiefly and primarily for his better Part, the Soul, viz. <HI>that he might have one to converse with of his own Species, Bone of his Bone and Flesh of his Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>It's true, Man is now a fallen, but yet a social Creature. And as the End of his coming into this World, was to prepare himself for a better, so with∣out doubt the chief End of Society in general, and Religious Society in particular is, that we may be helps meet for each other, in the great Work of our Salvation.</P>
<P>Upon this account, the first Christians so frequently Assembled themselves together, tho' oblig'd to shut the Doors for fear of the <HI>Jews.</HI> And their conti∣nuing in Fellowship with each other, was one main Reason why they continued steadfast in the Apostles Doctrine.—No doubt they went up to the Tem∣ple at the Hour of Prayer, whilst the Temple stood, but then they thought that no excuse for their meeting from House to House to edify each other in Love.</P>
<P>The Societies of which you are Members, I hope, are of this Nature. Take then, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> the
<PB N="6" REF="004455_0005_100DA07AE13910E0"/>
Primitive Christians for your Ensamples. Their Practices were Recorded for our Learning. No Power on Earth can lawfully disanul or prevent out imitating them.—In all such Cases we must obey God rather than Man. Otherwise we so far deny our holy Profession, and are Enemies to the Cross of Christ, and tho' because you are got a little out of the usual formal way, some blind Zealots may brand you as Schismatical and Seditious, yet if you fear God, truly Honour the King, and are of the Number of those who are quiet in the Land, there's no one Reason can be urged against your Societies, which will not equally hold good against all the Societies in the two great Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P>In this Respect a private Prelate has no more Authority than a private Presbyter. If it be lawful for more than five to meet in a private Vestry, it is equally lawful to meet in a private House, as is the Practice of some of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Societies who are under the Government of the Twelve Stewards. If they ask you by what Authority you sometimes use Extempore free Prayer? You may ask them again, by what Authority they use the Church forms any where but in the Church? If they reply they use Dr. <HI>Woodward'</HI>s Form. You may answer them with this Question, what difference is there between a Persons reading a Form which few knew before they heard it, or a Persons praying Extempore as the Holy Spirit give him utterance? If they laugh at all Pretensions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Praying by the Spirit, Brethren, I hope you know better. Stand fast therefore in the Liberty where with Jesus Christ hath made you free. The Church of <HI>England</HI> confines none to forms but in the House of God. In private Assemblies, such as yours, all are lest to their Liberty. Whoever make it their
<PB N="7" REF="004455_0006_100DA07D49339F10"/>
Business to prevent you, discover a Spirit too like the <HI>Pharisees</HI> of old. They are Strangers to the Liberties of the Gospel themselves, and those that are Partakers of them they hinder.</P>
<P>Many trifling Objections were made against your Conduct in this particular when I was last in <HI>England.</HI> But they were generally urged with so much Bigotry and Passion, and were so weak in themselves, that I seldom thought they deserved an Answer. I com∣monly shewed my contempt of them by saying no∣thing at all about them.</P>
<P>But I trust, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> you have not built your House upon so Sandy a Foundation, as to suffer it to be thrown down by a few high swelling Words of Vanity. I am persuaded you think it meet, right, and your bounden Duty, not only to Assemble your∣selves together, but also to make use of your Chris∣tian freedom, and not again to be entangled in a Yoak of Bondage, for God hath called you to Liberty.</P>
<P>How to improve your Meetings so as best to pro∣mote God's Glory and the Good of your own Souls, ought to be your constant and chief Concern. For as Christians in general, so Members of Religious Societies in particular, are as Cities built upon a Hill, and therefore it more highly Concerns them, <HI>so to let their Light shine before Men, that they seeing their Good Works, may glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Not that a perfect Communion of Saints is to be expected here on Earth; or that you ought to be immediately offended, if some of your Brethren
<PB N="8" REF="004455_0007_100DA080609C1948"/>
should be over taken with a fault. In this World Tares will be always Springing up amongst the Wheat. Many that are first will be last and the last first. Nay it is well, if some, <HI>Judas</HI> like, do not at length lay aside their Profession and openly betray their Master. In all such Cases, every one that standeth should take heed lost he fall, be ex∣ceeding jealous of his own Heart, and not say, <HI>Lord is it my Brother;</HI> but, <HI>is it I that shall deny thee next.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent such fatal miscarriages, you ought to be very Cautious, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> whom you admit into Fellowship with you.—Examine them again and again whether they be in the Faith. Set them upon proving their ownselves, and by no Means re∣ceive them into your Brotherhood, unless they can produce sufficient Proofs of their having tasted the good Word of Life, and felt the Powers of the World to come in a special and saving Manner. This some may object is not a very good way to en∣crease and multiply you as to Number: But it is the best way my Brethren, to encrease Piety amongst those that you have. And a Society consisting of a few solid Christians, is far preferable to one that is filled with a great Number of such who do not <HI>bring forth Fruit unto Holiness, but have only the Fig-leaves of an outward Profession.</HI> Formal Hypo∣crites will do you more harm than good; and how∣ever they may endure for a while and receive the Word with Joy, yet having no Root in themselves, in time of Temptation they will shamefully fall a∣way.—<HI>From all such, Good Lord, deliver thy Church.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004455_0008_100DA08283F3B030"/>
Next to your Care about admitting others, I think it highly concerns you whenever you do assemble, to remember the End of your Meeting, and then to use the Words of the wise Son of <HI>Sirach,</HI> on another Occasion, you will never do amiss. Now the End of your Meetings, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> is not that you may think yourselves more Holy than your Neigh∣bours, much less to form a Party, or promote a Schism or Sedition in the Church or State. No! such Thoughts I trust are far from you: For they are Earthly, Sensual, Devilish! And if ever any such Designs should be set on foot, I earnestly pray God, the Abettors of them may be immediately detected, and all their Schemes, tho' ever so plausibly concerted, fall to the Ground. The only End I hope you all propose by your Religious Assemblies, is the same for which you were Created, viz. <HI>The renewing of your depraved Natures and promoting the hidden Life of Jesus Christ in your Souls.</HI> These Terms howe∣ver they may seem foolishness to others, I trust, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> are not so to you.—I take it for granted, you not only are desirous of, but already, in some measure, are blessed with a saving, experimental Knowledge of Jesus Christ in your Hearts. For un∣less a Man be born again from above and is made a partaker of the Indwelling of God's Holy Spirit, he shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of God.—Whoever denies this to be true in the most literal, real, and absolute Sense of the Words, knows no∣thing yet as he ought to know.—For it is grounded on a self-evident Truth, viz. <HI>That we are all fallen from God in</HI> Adam, <HI>and must be renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, ere we can be restored to a bliss∣ful Communion with him again.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004455_0009_100DA085C915FD20"/>
The only way to this is <HI>Faith in Christ Jesus.</HI>—Faith, in Contra-distinction to, tho' necessarily pro∣ductive of Good Works. <HI>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, Whosoever believeth on me, tho' he were dead</HI> (as we all are by Nature) <HI>yet shall be live,</HI> says Christ himself.—And I think it my bounden Duty to exhort you to contend earnestly for the Doctrine of Justification by Faith alone, because so many blind Guides are lately gone out into the World.—It is much to be feared, that the gene∣rality of our present Preachers are no better than Doctrinal Papists.—And however this, to those who having Eyes, see not, may be judged an un∣charitable Censure, yet surely they cannot justly blame me for want of Candour, if they consider how one of the most Orthodox Prelates in the Kingdom in a late Pastoral Letter, advises his Clergy <HI>so to ex∣plain the Doctrine of Justification in the sight of God, by Faith alone, as to make Good Works a necessary Condition of our Justification.</HI> Such Advice from a <HI>Roman Cardinal</HI> would be no more than we might expect, but coming from a Bishop of the <HI>Church of England</HI> is surprizing and much to be la∣mented.!</P>
<P>God forbid, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> that you should so learn Christ.—If the Scriptures be true, such Doctrine is absolutely false. The lively Oracles of God no where declare, <HI>Good Works to be a necessary Condition of our Justification in the Sight of God.</HI> On the contrary, they every where affirm, <HI>that Salvation is the free Gift of God, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI>—<HI>that we are saved by Grace thro' Faith</HI>—<HI>that it is not of Works, lest any Man should Boast.</HI>—No! <HI>my Brethren,</HI> in the great Scheme of Mans Salva∣tion by Jesus Christ, Boasting is entirely excluded.
<PB N="11" REF="004455_0010_100DA08818E7CB20"/>
We must not expect to be saved, or any ways to re∣commend ourselves to God's Favour, by any or all the Works of Righteousness which we have done, or shall, or can do.—<HI>The Lord Christ is our Righ∣teousness</HI>—His must be imputed to us instead of our own.—<HI>We are compleat in him,</HI> says the Scripture—<HI>We are accounted Righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord Jesus Christ by Faith,</HI> says the Eleventh Article of our Church. And if so, how are Good Works, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> a necessary Condi∣tion of our being Justified in the Sight of God? If this was to be the Case, no Man living ever was or ever will be Justified in the Sight of God.—The Law indeed says, <HI>Do and Live.</HI>—But the Gospel brings us the Glad Tydings, <HI>that Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that be∣lieveth.</HI>—Christ by his Obedience has every Way fulfilled the Law for us,—and God will not desire to be paid twice.—Christ bought our Justification. It comes to us free, without any regard to works, past, present, or to come.—<HI>That we may under∣stand,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>that which is freely given us of God.</HI> Wherefore to use the Words of the fore∣mentioned Article, <HI>that we are justifyed by Faith a∣lone is a most wholesome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Observe my Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By or through, and not for Faith.—For Faith is only the Mean or Instrument whereby the whole Righteousness of Jesus Christ is apply'd to the Sinners Soul. And whosoever does thus believe in their <HI>Hearts,</HI> may be assured their Pardon is sealed in Heaven, notwithstanding they may have lived in an open Breach of God's Commandments all the Time
<PB N="12" REF="004455_0011_100DA089AF8BEBB8"/>
before their Conviction. <HI>Believe,</HI> says the Apostle to the trembling Jaylor, <HI>and thou shalt be saved.</HI></P>
<P>Not that this Faith if True will be Dead, Idle or Inactive.—For it is not a Faith of the Head <Q>An assenting to things Credible as Credible, as 'tis commonly defined.</Q> The Devils thus Believe and Tremble.—But it is a Faith of the <HI>Heart,</HI> a living Principle wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of God, applying that inwardly which was wrought out for him outwardly by Jesus Christ upon the Cross, and continually exciting the Possessor of it, <HI>to show it forth by his Works,</HI> not as necessary Conditions of his Justification, but as Proofs of his having a living Faith, and as so many tokens of his Gratitude and Love for what God has done for his Soul. This is what the Apostle stiles <HI>a Faith working by Love.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot conclude this better than in the Words of a truly Evangelical Writer now by me.—<HI>The Law</HI> (sayest thou) <HI>must be obeyed. I answer, Christ Jesus hath done that in his own Person, and Justified me thereby; and for my own part, I will not labour now to fulfil the Law for Justification, lest I should undervalue the Merits of the Man Christ Jesus, and what he hath done without me; and yet will I labour to fulfil, if it were possible, ten thousand Laws, if there were so many: And Oh! let it be out of Love to my sweet Lord Jesus</HI>—<HI>For the Love of Christ constrains me.</HI></P>

Letter sent over a Sermon on this important Subject, entituled, <HI>What think ye of Christ?</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed.—A Catholick Spirit of Univer∣sal Love, is what I would earnestly recommend as worthy the Name whereby you are called. Why should Bigotry or Party Zeal be so much as once named amongst the Followers of Jesus Christ? Our Lord was a Stranger to it. <HI>Whoever did the Will of his Father, the same was his Brother, his Sister and his Mother.</HI> Wherever he saw the Marks of a true Faith tho' in a <HI>Centurion,</HI> a <HI>Syrophenician, Aliens</HI> to the common Wealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> and Strangers to the <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Promise,</HI> how did he publish and com∣mend it? Be followers then of him my Brethren as dear Children, and love all (however in every thing they follow not with us) who love our Lord Jesus in sincerity and Truth. Thus it will be in Heaven. Why should not our Heaven begin on Earth? <HI>Pha∣risees</HI> and <HI>Saducees</HI> the <HI>Self-Righteous</HI> and <HI>Free-Think∣ers</HI> of this Generation, all the Children of the De∣vil whether rich or poor, high or low, however different in other respects yet agree in this one Thing, <HI>viz. To conspire against the Lord, and against his Christ.</HI> Why should not the Children of God, notwithstanding their little Differences unite in one common Interest against the Powers of Darkness. Oh that all that call themselves Christians were thus minded! How should we see the Kingdom of Christ come with Power, and Satan like Lightning fall from Heaven. From the beginning it has been his Poli∣cy to divide Professors into Sects and Parties, hope∣ing thereby not only to weaken their Interest, but to make them believe Religion wholly consisted in being of this or that particular Communion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004455_0013_100D8283DB6E27E0"/>
And his serpentine Subtiety has so prevailed that tho' we all profess to hold one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, yet numbers look upon all that differ from them almost as Creatures of another Species, and forbid us with such even to Eat. This was once the State of the Jewish, as it is now of the Christian Church, but God shewed his dislike of such a Temper, by telling <HI>Peter</HI> in a miraculous Manner, <HI>That he was henceforward to call nothing that God had cleansed common or unclean, but freely to converse with all who feared him and worked Righteousness for such were accepted of him. My Brethren</HI> be not you disobe∣dient to this Heavenly Vision—For oursakes no doubt it was written, many hereby will call your Conduct in question (as the Brethren did <HI>Peter</HI>) when they spy out your free Conversation in Christ—But <HI>Peter</HI> has furnished You with an Answer. <HI>For as much as God has given them the like Gift as to us, who believed on Jesus, what are we that we should withstand God? How dare we make a difference when God has made none? How dare we not freely converse with those, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</HI></P>
<P>Further, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> content not your selves with reading, singing, and praying together, but set some time apart to confess your Faults and com∣municate Experiences to one another. For want of this (which I take to be one chief Design of pri∣vate Meetings) most of the <HI>London</HI> Societies I fear are sunk into a dead Formality, and have only a Name to live. They meet on a Sunday Evening, read a Chapter, sing a Psalm, but seldom if ever ac∣quainteach other with the Operations of Gods Spirit upon their Souls. Hence it is that they have only
<PB N="15" REF="004455_0014_100DA0918A8F1448"/>
the Form of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> amongst them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> utter Strangers to the State of one anothers Hearts. How little Love or Power of Religion may be kept up by such a low superficial Way of proceed∣ing, is not difficult to suppose. <HI>My Brethren,</HI> do not you go on in such a Formal round of Duties, but frankly and freely tell one another what God has done for your Souls—For this End you would do well to form yourselves into little Bands, and without reserve tell each other what is in your Hearts. None but those that have Experience can tell the unspeakable Advantages of such an union of Souls—By this Means, brotherly Love will be excited and kept up amongst you; and you will learn to watch over one another for Good: This will teach you the better, how to pray for each other in your private retirements, and put off, if not totally pre∣vent many Snares of the Devil: For Satan loves solitary Virtue, but cares not to tempt him, who he knows will discover his Devices to his Bre∣thren. Besides, this is a most effectual Means for each to try the sincerity of his own Heart, as well as anothers. No one I think that truly loves his Soul and his Brethren will be shy of opening his Heart, in order to have their Advice, Reproof, Ad∣monition and Prayers as his Occasions require. A sin∣cere Person will esteem it one of the greatest Blessings; nor do I know a better Means in the World to keep Hypocrites out from among you. <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Unbelievers</HI> will pray, read and sing Psalms, but none save an <HI>Isrealite</HI> indeed, will endure to have his Heart searched. <HI>He that hath Ears to hear let him hear.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> expect a great deal of con∣tempt: For Christs Servants were always the World's
<PB N="16" REF="004455_0015_100DA0948C7A3AA8"/>
Fools—As for this <HI>Sect,</HI> said the <HI>Jews</HI> to <HI>Paul, we know it is every where spoken against.</HI> And again, <HI>Paul</HI> had Authority from the chief Priests to bring as many as he found of <HI>this Way</HI>—Thus were the Disciples of the Lord treated in the infancy of the Church; and as it was formerly, so it is now in our Days. To be a true Christian, is realy to be scan∣dalous: If you were of the World, the World would love its own, but if you are not of the World, and are in the Number of those whom Christ has cho∣sen out of the World, <HI>My Brethren</HI> the World will hate you: However it may seem a Paradox to the natural Man, yet there was never a true <HI>Saint</HI> who was not accounted a mad Person; and they that will live Godly in Christ Jesus must to the End of Time suffer Persecution.</P>
<P>But God forbid, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> that a little, nay that all the contempt in the World, should any Ways move you from your Profession of the Gospel. Our Lord was despised before us; and you know the Ser∣vant must not be above his Master. No, it is suffici∣ent if he be as his Master, made perfect by Suffer∣ings like unto him—Be stedfast therefore, <HI>My Bre∣thren</HI> quit yourselves like Men, be strong, be not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; but follow your-Master without the Camp, bearing his reproach. When you are reviled, revile not again, bless my <HI>Brethren</HI> but curse not, be true Followers of the meek and dear Lamb of God, never entertain the least Thought of resisting the higher Powers upon any pretence whatever: The Powers that be, are ordain'd of God; whosoever therefore resisteth the Power; especially because he will not patiently suffer
<PB N="17" REF="004455_0016_100DA0962BC3D798"/>
for the Truth sake, justly receives Condemnation to himself. <HI>Brethren</HI> I am jealous over you, with a Godly jealousy. In troublesome Times many that make a fair shew of Religion in the Flesh, are apt to turn Religion into Faction. I beseech you by the Mercies of God in Christ Jesus our Lord, be∣ware of all such who would turn Religion into a Party. O let me once more entreat you never suffer any such thing to subsist amongst you, shew that you truly fear God by paying all due honour, tribute and obedience to the King as Supreme, and to Governors, as to such who are sent by him, remember again and a∣gain that our Weapons are not Carnal—And that they who take the Sword shall perish by the Sword. Christians are to expect Sufferings, and tho' they must obey God rather than Man, yet they are pa∣tiently if need be to suffer for so doing, but not to resist in any wise. <HI>May God make you all thus mind∣ed, and then the Spirit of Christ and of Glory will rest upon your Souls.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> out of the fulness of my Heart, I have wrote unto you. Many of you I ne∣ver yet saw, and perhaps never may see in the Flesh. However I love you in the Bowels of Jesus Christ, and heartily beseech God to bless what his Spirit has enabled me to send unto you.</P>
<P>You see, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> I have confined my self only to such Things which chiefly concern you as Members of <HI>Societies.</HI> I take it for granted you will take heed to your Ways in common Life and never give the Adversary room justly to speak reproach∣fully of your Conduct. <HI>My Brethren,</HI> the Eyes of all Men are upon you—Indeed it highly concerns you
<PB N="18" REF="004455_0017_100DA098A4527E10"/>
to walk exceeding circumspectly to those that are without—I am sure you will not be oftended, if out of Love I remind you to perform all relative Duties to Men, with the utmost chearfulness, and a single Eye to the Glory of God. Let your Obedience, be constant universal, and uniform, founded on a li∣ving Faith in Christ Jesus your Saviour, that by well doing ye may put to silence the Slanders of evil Men—Let your Speech and every Thing you do betray whose Disciples you are. Confess your Lord publickly before Men, and be not afraid to tell those that have Ears to hear what God has done for your Souls. It is good to keep close the Se∣crets of a King, but it is honourable to reveal the the Works of God—Above all Things, <HI>My Bre∣thren,</HI> have fervent Charity among yourselves—Bear ye one anothers Burdens and so fulfil the Law of Christ—Be pitiful, be courteous, be tender hearted, and when a Brother is overtaken with a Fault, shew that you are spiritual by restoring him in the Spi∣rit of meekness.
