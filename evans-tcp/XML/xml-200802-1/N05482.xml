<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the Sake of Those who live at a Distance and knew not the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>following Tracts,</HI> I would observe; That he had his Education at <HI>Harvard-College,</HI> and studied <HI>Chymistry</HI> and <HI>Physick,</HI> under his Uncle the Learned Dr. <HI>James Oliver</HI> of <HI>Cambridge;</HI> one of the most esteemed <HI>Physicians</HI> in his Day; who had a singular Help in the Art of Chymistry by the ingenious Dr. <HI>Lodowick</HI> a <HI>Ger∣man,</HI> who was also accounted an excellent <HI>Physician,</HI> and the most skilful <HI>Chymist</HI> that ever came into these Parts of <HI>Ame∣rica.</HI> And Dr. <HI>Williams</HI> lived and practiced in <HI>Boston</HI> with great Success and Reputation for near <HI>thirty seven</HI> Years, to the Time of his <HI>Death,</HI> which was on <HI>Jan.</HI> 10. 1737, 8, in the 63d Year of his Age.</P>
<P>He was well vers'd in the most valued <HI>Authors,</HI> especially those who wrote on <HI>Experimental Cases,</HI> carefully comparing them with <HI>his own Observations.</HI> He made the Case of his Patients as his own: and where he apprehended Danger, ap∣plied himself with great Concern and Diligence, and seem'd to bear them on his Mind continually. In some Cases he has consulted with Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> and <HI>other principal Physicians</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for Advice and Help.</P>
<P>In every thing he was exceeding <HI>Cautious;</HI> especially in the Preparation of his <HI>more important Medicines</HI> for his own Practice, that he might more surely judge of their Operati∣ons: And his established Character for Piety, Skill and Cau∣tion, made his Patients entirely satisfied in all his Manage∣ments.</P>
<P><PB REF="006947_0003_102AD1C55DABFE38"/>
It was his Method to reduce to <HI>Writing</HI> the <HI>more remarka∣ble Cases</HI> with the various Symptoms occuring, and the Course he took; that he might form his own Practice in like Cases afterwards. And by this Means we are favoured with the <HI>following Tracts;</HI> which appear to be wrote with great Judgment and Conciseness; tho' without the least Thought of their being ever published.</P>
<P>The <HI>former</HI> Part seems to have been drawn up for <HI>some special Friend,</HI> by Way of Direction; the <HI>latter</HI> is a <HI>more par∣ticular Account</HI> of <HI>his own Practice,</HI> in which the <HI>Prescriptions</HI> are here rendred into <HI>English</HI> for their being of more extensive Use.</P>
<P>I hope this will suffice to recommend them to those who were not acquainted with him: for as to those who knew him, I apprehend it needless.</P>
<P>In the little Knowledge I have of <HI>Physical Authors</HI> and of <HI>this Distemper,</HI> I cannot but judge <HI>these small Tracts</HI> of <HI>great Value.</HI> And as my divine and merciful MASTER declared, that He came not to destroy Men's Lives, but to save them; and in tender Pity to all about Him, and a perfect Consist∣ence with his saving Office, employed his Power to <HI>heal</HI> their <HI>bodily</HI> as well as <HI>spiritual</HI> Maladies: I cannot but judge it consistent with my <HI>Imitation</HI> of Him, to promote the Publish∣ing <HI>this excellent Method</HI> of <HI>Healing,</HI> and recommend it to all around me. And in Hopes of its being a Mean in his Hand of saving the Lives of many, especially in our <HI>Coun∣try Towns,</HI> as well as in <HI>This</HI> where the <HI>Physicians</HI> have not <HI>now</HI> Time to attend <HI>all</HI> the Sick; I humbly commit it to his sovereign Blessing.</P>

<HEAD>General RULES to be observed.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHen the Air is infected</HI> and <HI>Danger arises</HI> from thence—</P>
<P>Let those that are liable to the Distemper live <HI>temperate</HI> in <HI>all Things:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>viz,</ABBR> in <HI>Eating, Drinking, Care, Exercise</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> for nothing more exposes to it or makes it more mortal than <HI>In∣temperance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To guard against the Infection</HI> and <HI>render the Distemper more favourable</HI> when it seizes; Let a <HI>Scruple</HI> of <HI>Brimstone</HI> very finely powder'd be taken twice a Day; first in the <HI>Morning,</HI> and about six o'Clock at <HI>Night,</HI> in a <HI>Spoonful</HI> of <HI>Water;</HI> and drink after it 40 <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>Elixir Proprietatis</HI> in a Glass of <HI>Water,</HI> or any generous <HI>Wine;</HI> or where <HI>that</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>Elixir.</HI></NOTE> can't be ob∣tain'd, let a Glass of <HI>Cyder</HI> with <HI>Rue</HI> and <HI>Gentian</HI> steep'd in it be taken in its Stead.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When the Symptoms</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox appear</HI> (which are very various, Pains in the Head, Back, Limbs, Stomach, Belly, Sickness &amp;c. with a Fever, which always accompanies what ever other Symptoms there are.)</P>
<P>If <HI>now</HI> there be any Signs of a <HI>foul Stomach,</HI> or its being <HI>clogg'd with Phlegm;</HI> Let there be a <HI>Vomit</HI> given <HI>as soon as may</HI> be <HI>before the Eruption</HI> or Appearance of the Pock. When it has done working, let something <HI>Cordial</HI> be given, as <HI>Mint-water</HI> sweetned with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron;</HI> or a <HI>Toast</HI> and <HI>Canary Wine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006947_0005_102AD1C9F08E9A60"/>
Let the <HI>Blood</HI> be now well diluted with some <HI>small Tea</HI> made of <HI>Baum, Sage,</HI> or <HI>any other temperate Herb;</HI> which let be sweetned with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron,</HI> &amp; given 3 or 4 Times a Day 'till the Pock is all out. <HI>Small Beer</HI> with a <HI>Toast,</HI> or <HI>Fair Water</HI> with a <HI>Toast,</HI> may be allowed now and then, if desir'd.</P>
<P><HI>To bring out the Pock,</HI> it is necessary that there be <HI>some Fever</HI> which must carefully be minded: If <HI>too high,</HI> it must be <HI>suppressed,</HI> and nothing must be allowed but what is <HI>cooling;</HI> if <HI>too low,</HI> it must be <HI>raised</HI> by warm <HI>Cordials,</HI> 'till the Heat of the Flesh be something beyond what is common: but yet great Care must be taken that it be not raised too high. A <HI>moist Skin</HI> is <HI>best,</HI> but <HI>profuse Sweats</HI> are <HI>destructive,</HI> and to be <HI>checked,</HI> by keeping the Hands out of Bed, and lessening the Bed Cloaths. Let the <HI>Throat</HI> be early guarded by a <HI>Plaistor</HI> of <HI>Paracelsus,</HI> or a <HI>Saffron Stay.</HI> If <HI>before Eruption</HI> (or <HI>any Time after</HI>) the Person be <HI>Delirious</HI> or <HI>Raving;</HI> apply a <HI>large Blister</HI> to the <HI>Nape of the Neck;</HI> and <HI>strong Attractives</HI> to the Soles of the <HI>Feet</HI> of <HI>Salt Beef,</HI> or <HI>Salt Mackrill,</HI> or <HI>Beef Kidneys.</HI></P>
<P>If there happen a FLUX, <HI>before Eruption</HI> (or <HI>at any other Time;</HI>) Let it be <HI>immediately stop'd</HI> by a <HI>Drahm</HI> of <HI>Diascordiam</HI> in <HI>Mint-Water;</HI> which may be repeated once in six Hours, if Need be.</P>
<P>If <HI>excessive Vomiting</HI> happen <HI>now</HI> or at <HI>any other Time;</HI> give <HI>Venice Treacle</HI> a <HI>Drahm</HI> in <HI>Mint-Water,</HI> or <HI>hot Wine</HI> if very violent, if Mint-Water with Syrup of Saffron will not stop it. However, if it be <HI>moderate,</HI> it may be serviceable; and therefore <HI>not to be stop'd too soon.</HI> The <HI>same</HI> may be said of <HI>Bleeding</HI> at the <HI>Nose.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When the Eruption is over,</HI> which is generally in 3, or 4 Days at farthest;—Let the <HI>same Rules</HI> be observed about the <HI>Drink</HI> as before. The <HI>Fever</HI> ought now to <HI>cease:</HI> but yet a <HI>natural Warmth</HI> must be maintained, and the Govern∣ment of the Person be accordingly; <HI>otherwise</HI> the <HI>Pock</HI> will <HI>not fill;</HI> which is the Thing now to be expected.</P>
<P><HI>If the Pock do not grow and fill</HI> by the <HI>forementioned Regi∣men;</HI> Let a <HI>handful of Sheeps-Dung</HI> be steeped in <HI>hot Water</HI> 3 or 4 <HI>Hours,</HI> and then strain'd off, and be given to the Quan∣tity
<PB N="3" REF="006947_0006_102AD1CB734AFF28"/>
of 3 or 4 <HI>Spoonfuls</HI> every 3 Hours: this continue, 'till the <HI>Maturation</HI> of the Pock, if Need be.</P>
<P><HI>If they strike in;</HI> apply <HI>Blisters</HI> to the <HI>Wrists</HI> and <HI>Ankles,</HI> and give the <HI>temperate Cordials</HI> as oft as needful, to make them appear again: a <HI>Glass</HI> of <HI>Canary</HI> with <HI>Saffron</HI> in it, or two <HI>Scruples</HI> of <HI>Venice-Treacle</HI> in <HI>Mint-water.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If the Throat be sore;</HI> gargle it with <HI>Water</HI> sweetned with <HI>Honey</HI> of <HI>Roses;</HI> or hold in the Mouth a little <HI>Conserve</HI> of <HI>Roses</HI> made a little tart with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Vitriol;</HI> or a little <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Black-berries,</HI> or <HI>Srawberries,</HI> or <HI>Mulberries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If the Urine be stop'd,</HI> as it many Times is; Let the Person be raised up: and if that do not answer, let him take a <HI>De∣coction</HI> of <HI>Pompion</HI> and <HI>Parsley-Seed</HI> for his <HI>Drink,</HI> 'till he be relieved.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>Food</HI> be <HI>Oatmeal-Caudle, Milk-porrage, Sack-whey;</HI> the one or the other, according as the <HI>Fever</HI> allows.</P>
<P><HI>If there be a Flux or loose Body;</HI> boil'd <HI>Rice</HI> may be eaten, and the <HI>Water</HI> of it drank: or the white <HI>Decoction</HI> made of <HI>Burnt-Hartshorn</HI> and <HI>Bisket,</HI> of each <HI>an Ounce</HI> boil'd in <HI>two Quarts</HI> of Water, 'till a Pint be consumed; let the <HI>Dregs</HI> be poured out with the rest in a Vessel wherein it is kept; and when it is drank, let it always be <HI>stirred up</HI> 'till it looks <HI>thick</HI> like Milk.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When they come to turn,</HI> which is on the 7th or 9th Day commonly after Eruption; Let <HI>Cordials</HI> be often given, and a more <HI>cordial Diet</HI> be allowed.</P>
<P><HI>If the Phlegm be tough or viscid,</HI> and <HI>Raising stop'd;</HI> Let it be thinned by a little <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Vinegar</HI> made with <HI>Honey;</HI> or a <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Urine,</HI> made with two <HI>Spoonfuls</HI> of <HI>Urine</HI> and one of Honey, with a little Nutmeg.</P>
<P><HI>If there be any Signs of an approaching Fever upon the Turn∣ing of the Pock,</HI> or <HI>the Person be delirious;</HI> Let there be <HI>strong Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet,</HI> and a <HI>Blister</HI> to the <HI>Neck,</HI> and <HI>Arms</HI> also if Need be; which must be <HI>kept, running,</HI> 'till the Dan∣ger is over.</P>
<P><HI>If the secondary Fever arises;</HI> it must be treated like a <HI>com∣mon putrid Fever.</HI> The <HI>Balsam</HI> of <HI>Fennel</HI> in <HI>Fountain</HI> Water excels here.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006947_0007_102AD1CF50EB0248"/>
<HI>When the Pock is thoroughly turned;</HI> the Body may be kept open with a loosning Diet of <HI>Plumb-porrage,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>If a Fever arises or is heightned</HI> for want of a Stool; a <HI>Suppositor</HI> or <HI>Clister</HI> may be us'd of <HI>Milk &amp; Sugar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cold chilly Fits with Sickness and Faintness</HI> often happen at the <HI>Turning;</HI> which must <HI>carefully</HI> be <HI>watched</HI> and <HI>speedily relieved,</HI> by something <HI>Cordial;</HI> as <HI>Toast &amp; Wine;</HI> or <HI>Elixir Proprietatis</HI> in a Glass of <HI>Canary</HI> Wine.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>After the Pock is dried away</HI> and the <HI>Strength recruited;</HI> Let the Body be well <HI>purged;</HI> 3 or 4 Times at least, at due Intervals, after the <HI>Confluent</HI> Sort; <HI>once</HI> or <HI>twice</HI> may suffice after the <HI>Distinct.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="rules">
<HEAD>Some more general RULES.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Cold Regimen</HI> in a <HI>flegmatic Constitution</HI> and where <HI>native Heat</HI> is <HI>wanting,</HI> often proves <HI>fatal;</HI> tho' in a <HI>san∣guine Constitution,</HI> where <HI>innate Heat</HI> is <HI>strong,</HI> it is <HI>necessary.</HI> Many are lost by not observing <HI>this Difference.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bleeding</HI> in <HI>some Cases</HI> may be <HI>necessary;</HI> but let it be directed by a <HI>judicious Physician,</HI> and never else admitted. <HI>Opiates</HI> are also to be under the same Direction.</P>
<P><HI>Too many Medicines</HI> often do much <HI>Hurt.</HI> More People are lost thro' a <HI>preposterous Use</HI> of <HI>needless Remedies,</HI> than thro' the <HI>Force</HI> of the <HI>Disease.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Looseness</HI> happening <HI>before the Suppuration</HI> of the Pustules, must be <HI>stop'd;</HI> but <HI>after,</HI> may be <HI>allowed.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Medical Observations on the SMALL-POX. Anno 1730.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Method</HI> I took in treating this Distemper; and which I found <HI>most successful,</HI> was as follows:</P>
<P>I advised my <HI>Patients,</HI> for whom I thought I should be concerned, to <HI>Temperance</HI> in all Things, as the <HI>best Preparation</HI> for the Small-Pox; and to take <HI>Morning</HI> &amp; <HI>Evening</HI> 20 or 30 <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>my Small-Pox Drops;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>Tincture</HI> drawn from <HI>Sulphur,</HI> to which add, <HI>Elixir Pro∣prietatis,</HI> so as to make a pleasant Mixture.</NOTE> or where those will not go down, 30 or 40 <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>Elixir Proprietatis</HI> This Me∣thod I found in many Instances both this Year &amp; in 1721, <HI>very successful</HI> to render the Distemper <HI>favourable.</HI> Those who were <HI>constant</HI> in taking it, I observed <HI>escaped a long Time</HI> before they were seized, and had generally the most favourable Sort and <HI>many escaped it altogether</HI> without any Complaint, tho' greatly exposed. I found also a <HI>Scruple</HI> of <HI>Flower of Brimstone,</HI> in <HI>Milk</HI> or <HI>any Vehicle,</HI> to answer this End very well, taken <HI>once,</HI> or <HI>twice a Day.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="stage of illness">
<HEAD>Before the Eruption.</HEAD>
<P>When the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of this Distemper appeared, if they were favourable, I did little or nothing, but advised to dilute the Blood with some <HI>small Tea</HI> of <HI>Baum,</HI> or <HI>what pleased the Appetite;</HI> and keep to a Diet of <HI>Water-Gruel</HI> for Food; <HI>Milk</HI> one Part, and <HI>Water</HI> three Parts, boil'd together for Drink; and <HI>wait</HI> for the <HI>Eruption:</HI> which if it <HI>appeared not the third Day.</HI> I endeavoured to promote, with this Mixture,</P>
<P><HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron</HI> 1 Ounce, <HI>Treacle Water</HI> half an Ounce, <HI>Carduus Water</HI> 2 Ounces, mixt, 3 or 4 Spoonfuls for a Dose: To be repeated once in six Hours; observing in the mean time to drink <HI>plentifully</HI> of <HI>small Tea</HI> or <HI>Milk and Water.</HI></P>
<P>If there were any <HI>Signs of a foul Stomach;</HI> I gave a <HI>Vomit</HI> as <HI>soon as I had Opportunity, before the Eruption:</HI> and I scru∣pled not to give it even <HI>when the Eruption was made,</HI> where the <HI>Signs</HI> of <HI>Foulness</HI> were manifest. For want of the Help
<PB N="6" REF="006947_0009_102AD1D4C460A2D0"/>
of this, I found great Danger arising, and a Necessity often times to give it, even at the very Height of the Distemper. I never gave any but <HI>Ipecacuanha,</HI> for fear of over-working, and weakning my Patient; who had now a dangerous Distem∣per to go thro', that <HI>required the greatest Strength</HI> to carry him thro'.</P>
<P>If there were <HI>great Fulness of Blood, Aptness to Bleed at the Nose.</HI> or <HI>Blood</HI> over-heat with <HI>Drinking,</HI> or its Passages ob∣structed with taking <HI>Cold;</HI> in these Cases I opened a <HI>Vein,</HI> and took away 8 or 10 <HI>Ounces</HI> of <HI>Blood:</HI> This I found a good <HI>Preparatory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Case of Delirium</HI> or <HI>obstructed Menses;</HI> I chose to <HI>bleed</HI> in the <HI>Feet.</HI></P>
<P>After the Bleeding was over, I endeavoured to promote a Breathing with some <HI>small Tea;</HI> which much facilitated the Eruption.</P>
<P>Sometimes <HI>before the Eruption,</HI> I have found <HI>excessive Vo∣miting:</HI> This I endeavoured to carry off by a <HI>Vomit,</HI> if there appeared any <HI>Symptoms</HI> of <HI>Foulness</HI> of the <HI>Stomach:</HI> if not, I endeavoured to settle it by an <HI>Anodyne</HI> in some <HI>Alexiphar∣mic Julep,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P><HI>Mint Water, Black Cherry Water,</HI> of each 2 <HI>Oz. Epidemic Water, Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron,</HI> of each half an Oz. <HI>Liquid Lauda∣num</HI> 15 Drops, more or less, according to the Age of the Patient; 3 or 4 Spoonfuls for a Dose, and repeated if Occa∣sion required. This often answered the Intention of Nature: which was now strugling with the Malignity fix'd upon the Nerves of the Stomach, and threw it out to the Skin, which was the Thing aimed at.</P>
<P>If there were a <HI>Coma</HI> or <HI>Delirium,</HI> or <HI>Raving,</HI> if there were <HI>no Signs</HI> of <HI>Overfulness</HI> of the Blood, or Humours of the Body, or Foulness of <HI>the Stomach;</HI> I now judged these Symptoms to arise from the variolous Matter fixed on the <HI>Nerves;</HI> and did little to remove them, but only <HI>diluted</HI> the <HI>Blood,</HI> and gave some <HI>gentle Alexipharmic:</HI> and if they remained <HI>obsti∣nate.</HI> I applied <HI>Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet;</HI> and <HI>Blisters</HI> to the <HI>Wrists</HI> and <HI>Ankles;</HI> and if Need required, behind the <HI>Ears:</HI> This I found most commonly to succeed.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006947_0010_102AD1D688343840"/>
A <HI>Purging</HI> has happened sometimes <HI>before the Eruption:</HI> which I was always <HI>very cautious of stopping,</HI> notwithstanding the common Practice to the contrary. For where I have found this, I generally found the <HI>Confluent</HI> Sort to follow, especially in <HI>Children.</HI> I therefore rather chose to carry it off, with <HI>Rubarb</HI> in small <HI>Doses</HI> repeated; a <HI>third Part</HI> of a Dose in <HI>Powder,</HI> repeated every six Hours, in a little <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron,</HI> or the <HI>same Part</HI> of a <HI>Dose</HI> in <HI>Infusion,</HI> sweetned with the <HI>same Syrup.</HI> However, if it caused <HI>Coldness</HI> in the <HI>extream Parts</HI> (and was very severe) or any <HI>great Faintness;</HI> I endea∣voured to <HI>check</HI> it by <HI>Oil of Cinnamon;</HI> or if that would not answer, with an <HI>Anodyne</HI> in some <HI>Alexipharmic Julep.</HI> The Mixture I used was, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>Mint-water</HI> 2 Oz. <HI>Diascord:</HI> one Drahm, <HI>Syrup Saffron</HI> 1 Oz. mixt, to be repeated every six Hours, if Occasion. And the <HI>Diet,</HI> the <HI>white Decoction,</HI> with <HI>Cloves, Cinnamon</HI> and <HI>Nutmegs</HI> with it, as the Patient liked best.</P>
<P><HI>Bleeding at the Nose</HI> often happened, and that to a very great Degree. This I endeavoured <HI>not to stop</HI> 'till it <HI>fainted</HI> the Patient. I have found great <HI>Damage</HI> ensue upon <HI>stopping it too soon.</HI> I endeavoured to <HI>cool</HI> the <HI>Blood</HI> by <HI>cooling Teas, Milk &amp; Water</HI> &amp;c, which was now ordinarily over-heat; and lay <HI>warm Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet,</HI> which would often be <HI>very cold</HI> at this Time. I never did bleed to turn the Blood, but always found the Method above-mentioned to succeed.</P>
<P><HI>Convulsion-Fits</HI> often happen, in <HI>Children especially.</HI>—If there were any <HI>manifest Signs</HI> of <HI>Foulness</HI> of the <HI>Sto∣mach</HI> and <HI>Fulness</HI> of <HI>Blood,</HI> I both bled them, and af∣ter that gave a <HI>Vomit;</HI> after which was over, I applied <HI>Blisters</HI> and <HI>Attractives,</HI> and ordered some <HI>Alexipharmic Julep</HI> to be repeated as the Symptoms called for. If the <HI>Fever</HI> was <HI>high;</HI> I endeavoured to lower it by <HI>Milk and Water, Water</HI> with a <HI>Toast</HI> in it, <HI>Small Beer</HI> &amp;c: if <HI>too low,</HI> I raised it by some generous <HI>Alexipharmic.</HI> Here I have found <HI>Anodynes</HI> necessary and very successful, after <HI>proper E∣vacuations,</HI> given in some <HI>Alexipharmic Julep.</HI> To a <HI>Child</HI> of
<PB N="8" REF="006947_0011_102AD1D9DFF0C5E8"/>
two Years old after <HI>bleeding</HI> and <HI>vomiting,</HI> I gave <HI>Pow∣der of Contrayerva Root</HI> 5 Grains, <HI>Black Cherry-Water</HI> 1 Oz. <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron</HI> half an Oz. <HI>Liquid Laudanum</HI> 4 Drops, often, with good Success. This both composed the Spirits which were <HI>now</HI> enraged, settled the over tension of the Fibres, and threw off the variolous Matter to the Skin. This I have found succeed, even when the <HI>Limbs</HI> have been left <HI>stiff</HI> and could not be bent without breaking, when the <HI>Fit</HI> seemed to be over.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="stage of illness">
<HEAD>When the Eruption is made.</HEAD>
<P>I Was careful to observe what <HI>State</HI> the <HI>Fever</HI> was in: whether there was <HI>enough</HI> to carry on the Maturation, or <HI>too much</HI> to hinder, or precipitate it; and accordingly applied.</P>
<P>Some were <HI>so hot,</HI> as to allow of nothing that was the least Cordial, but called for the most temperate <HI>cooling</HI> Regi∣men.</P>
<P>These I treated with <HI>Milk and Water,</HI> which I allowed and perswaded them to drink <HI>plentifully</HI> of; and <HI>Panada,</HI> or <HI>Wa∣ter-Gruel</HI> for their Food. <HI>This</HI> for the most Part <HI>ripened</HI> and <HI>filled</HI> the <HI>Pustules.</HI> If it did not, I gave <HI>Gascoign Powder,</HI> Morning and Night, in a little <HI>Carduus-Water,</HI> sweetned with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron,</HI> or a little <HI>Epidemic</HI> W<HI>ater,</HI> diluted with <HI>Carduus-water,</HI> and sweetned with some <HI>cooling Syrup,</HI> as <HI>Strawberries</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Others were apt to grow <HI>cold,</HI> and <HI>want</HI> a <HI>Fever.</HI> These I treated with a <HI>Julep</HI> of <HI>Carduus Water,</HI> 4 Oz. <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron</HI> 1 Oz. <HI>Treacle Water,</HI> or <HI>Epidemic Water,</HI> half an Oz. <HI>Contrayerva Stone</HI> two Drams, mixt: of this I gave a Spoon∣ful every Morning till the <HI>Warmth</HI> came on and the Pock ap∣peared bright and full, and so continued as this Intention required: Being careful <HI>in the mean Time</HI> to dilute the Blood with good Store of <HI>Drink.</HI> Here I allowed <HI>Sack-whey, Wine</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> and now and then a little <HI>Phlip.</HI> I found a Drink made of <HI>Sheeps Dung</HI> boiled in Water to answer well here: This drank plentifully, filled the <HI>Pustules,</HI> and raised the Swelling, and carried on the Maturation to Expectation.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006947_0012_102AD1DD5CE71BE0"/>
I found a <HI>Necessity</HI> of observing <HI>this Difference</HI> in treating my Patients. I observed many to die in keeping to the <HI>cooling Method</HI> without allowing them <HI>Cordials</HI> at due Intervals, as is now the common Method in Imitation of Dr. <HI>Sydenham;</HI> and this even in the <HI>distinct</HI> Sort of Pock.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Confluent</HI>—I found a Necessity of watching this carefully and varying as the Symptoms directed. If I saw it coming; I endeavoured to <HI>cleanse the Body</HI> well both <HI>upwards</HI> and <HI>downwards</HI> as soon as I could, and <HI>bled</HI> them also if there were proper Indications for it. If a <HI>Purging</HI> attended it at the Beginning or Progress; I endeavoured only to sup∣press and moderate it, and not wholly to <HI>check</HI> it. In the <HI>Be∣ginning</HI> I gave <HI>Rubarb</HI> in small Doses every <HI>six Hours,</HI> which answered well, and ordered the <HI>white Decoct:</HI> for <HI>Food.</HI> I ordered for <HI>Drink,</HI> Milk and Water: and if the Fever was high, a <HI>Julep</HI> of <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Elderberries</HI> well acidulated with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Vitriol</HI> in all their <HI>Drink.</HI></P>
<P>If a <HI>Cordial was wanted,</HI> or the <HI>Pustules did not fill</HI> well; I ordered <HI>Powder</HI> of <HI>Gascoign,</HI> Morning and Night, or oftner if Need required, in some <HI>temperate Vehicle;</HI> being careful in the mean Time to dilute and temper the <HI>Blood</HI> with good Store of <HI>Liquid;</HI> nothing answered which Intention like <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Water</HI> in great Quantities. This <HI>cooling, diluting</HI> Method kept from <HI>Delirium</HI> and <HI>Raving;</HI> and followed close∣ly, was the best Remedy to cure it. <HI>Bleeding</HI> I never found succeed <HI>after the Eruption was thoroughly made,</HI> even in <HI>Distraction</HI> it self; but <HI>sunk</HI> the <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Pustules</HI> too; and I ever found it difficult to save Life after it.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Pustules</HI> seem to <HI>strike in;</HI> I have found a <HI>Decoction</HI> of <HI>Snake-root,</HI> sweetned with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron</HI> given hot, to answer well. If that does not answer immediately; I or∣ordered <HI>Blisters</HI> to the Wrists and Ankles, and a <HI>Julep</HI> of the <HI>Contrayerva-Stone</HI> in <HI>Carduus Water, Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron,</HI> and <HI>Epidemic Water,</HI> to be followed every two Hours 'till the <HI>In∣tention</HI> was answered. In the <HI>mean Time, diluting</HI> the <HI>Blood</HI> well with some <HI>temperate Liquors,</HI> as the Heat and Temper of the Person required.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="006947_0013_102AD151202EEFF8"/>
If the <HI>Throat</HI> be <HI>sore</HI> with the Pock, I found a <HI>Saffron-Stay,</HI> or a Plaister of <HI>Paracelsus</HI> imbued with <HI>Oil</HI> of <HI>Mint,</HI> to relieve much. A Spoonful of the following <HI>Julep</HI> help in the Mouth &amp; gradually swallowed, has been very serviceable; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Hysop-Water</HI> or <HI>common Water,</HI> three Ounces; Syrup of <HI>Elderberries, Strawberries, Mulberries,</HI> or <HI>Honey</HI> of <HI>Roses,</HI> two Oz; <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> so much as to make it very tart, mixt. If very much <HI>stuffed</HI> with <HI>Phlegm,</HI> I have applied a <HI>Blis∣ter</HI> to the <HI>Nape of the Neck,</HI> and sometimes given a <HI>Vomit,</HI> to save Life at any Time of the Pock.</P>
<P>I have found great Advantage in an <HI>open Body,</HI> one Stool in a Day in the whole Course of the Distemper; contrary to the common Observation, in <HI>any</HI> Sort, especially the <HI>Con∣fluent:</HI> and when there has been a great Load of Humours, have promoted it by a <HI>Suppositor,</HI> or <HI>loosening pectoral Decoction;</HI> tho' <HI>not by Purges. Sometimes</HI> I have allowed them to eat <HI>Figs</HI> and <HI>Raisins,</HI> which both brought on the ripening of the Pustules and kept the Body open sufficiently.</P>
<P>In <HI>raving Distraction,</HI> I have found Applications to the <HI>Feet,</HI> with <HI>strong Attractives, Blisters,</HI> and a <HI>cooling, diluting Diet</HI> taken plentifully, to answer best. <HI>Bleeding</HI> I never found to succeed here; except there were <HI>plain Indications</HI> for it from over fulness of <HI>Blood,</HI> and some Stagnation from <HI>taking Cold.</HI> If the <HI>Pustules filled well,</HI> I was not over-busy with Remedies; but I have found it to cease of it self, when the <HI>Pock</HI> had <HI>turned.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Pock turning.</HEAD>
<P>When the Pock is ripe and begins to turn, great Care must be taken to prevent the <HI>second Fever.</HI> A <HI>loose Body</HI> is of great Service here, in every Sort of Pock. I therefore early ordered a <HI>Suppositor</HI> or <HI>Clister.</HI> If this answered not, I gave a <HI>Pectoral Decoction</HI> with good Success. The <HI>Hierapicra</HI> has been very serviceable where it could be taken. And this I continued as often as I saw a <HI>Fever</HI> inclining to rise. However I took Care to guard the Vitals by <HI>repeated Doses</HI> of <HI>fixed</HI> or <HI>volatile Cordials,</HI> as the Symptoms required.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006947_0014_102AD1E0AD5C03C8"/>
If upon <HI>the Turning</HI> they were <HI>much oppressed</HI> in the <HI>Breast,</HI> or <HI>stuffed</HI> with <HI>Phlegm</HI> in the Organs of Respiration; I have found a <HI>Vomit</HI> to succeed, of <HI>Ipecacuanha</HI> or <HI>Vinum Emeticum</HI> and <HI>Pectoral Syrup,</HI> diluted with <HI>Hysop Water,</HI> with a <HI>Blister</HI> to the <HI>Nape of the Neck.</HI> After this, the <HI>Pectoral De∣coction,</HI> and that with a little <HI>Sena,</HI> to make it more purging, if Need require.</P>
<P><HI>Cold chilly Fits</HI> are very apt to come <HI>at the Turning;</HI> which are prevented by a <HI>Cordial</HI> duly repeated, especially <HI>Gascoign-Powder,</HI> and helped by a <HI>Cordial</HI> given immediately when they come.</P>
<P>If the <HI>second Fever arise, </HI> if it be attended with <HI>great Op∣pression</HI> and <HI>Difficulty of Breathing,</HI> and <HI>Stagnation</HI> of the <HI>Blood;</HI> I have found <HI>Bleeding</HI> succeed; but not else. If it be <HI>mo∣derate,</HI> a <HI>loose Body</HI> suffices; if <HI>not, Blisters</HI> and <HI>Purges</HI> of the <HI>gentle Sort</HI> have carried it off best, with a cooling, diluting <HI>Diet;</HI> not forgetting to intermix a <HI>Cordial</HI> fix'd or volatile, as the Symtoms called for.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Purples, Petechiae,</HI> and <HI>Indigo Pock;</HI> I have found the aforesaid <HI>Rules</HI> to be most serviceable. The most <HI>smoothing, diluting Diet,</HI> and large Quantities of them, answer best: not forgetting <HI>Cordials,</HI> especially <HI>fix'd Bezoardics;</HI> with∣out which the most cooling Regimen signifies but little. <HI>Bleeding</HI> I have found of <HI>no Service</HI> here; except the common <HI>Indications</HI> for it were <HI>apparent.</HI> I have seen it repeated to a third Time, but to no Advantage, but apparently hastned the Death of the Patient. Many have lived to the 9th <HI>Day,</HI> that have <HI>but few Remedies</HI> used; and some have <HI>recovered</HI> to a Surprize, that have been given over; tho' it has been very rare.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>H.</HI> recovered of the <HI>Purple</HI> Sort in the Use of <HI>diluting Diet</HI> and <HI>great Quantities</HI> of <HI>Elixir Proprietatis.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>R.</HI> recovered of the <HI>Indigo</HI> Pock in the Use of the <HI>diluting Diet,</HI> with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron, Treacle-Water,</HI> and <HI>Carduus-Water,</HI> and Morning and Night a Dose of <HI>Gascoign Powder.</HI> I opened one of the <HI>Indigo</HI> Pock with a Lancet, found con∣gealed hardned <HI>Blood,</HI> a quarter of an Inch deep: I dare not proceed deeper with it for fear of an <HI>Haemorage.</HI> I
<PB N="12" REF="006947_0015_102AD1E4A14935B0"/>
<HI>generally</HI> found the Pulse much depressed; and <HI>sometimes</HI> but few Complaints, the Patients commonly thinking them∣selves well 'till Death came on.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Anodynes;</HI> I have found them absolutely necessary, and very serviceable to subdue the <HI>great Pain &amp; Fever</HI> that arises from thence from the <HI>Smart</HI> of the <HI>Pock.</HI> These I <HI>seldom</HI> gave, 'till the Pustules were thoro'ly out, and they began to complain of <HI>Soreness</HI> and <HI>Restlesness</HI> thereby; except in Case of <HI>Convulsions,</HI> and then not 'till due <HI>Evacuations</HI> have been made. A <HI>swelling</HI> of the <HI>Face</HI> commonly followed it; and it would raise this Swelling when no other Remedies would. It often took away a <HI>Delirium &amp; Raving,</HI> &amp; composed the Patient to rest. I <HI>ordinarily</HI> gave them but <HI>once</HI> in 24 <HI>Hours</HI> at Night; tho' sometimes in <HI>great Restlesness</HI> have given them <HI>oftner;</HI> and in the <HI>Confluent</HI> Sort, <HI>once</HI> in <HI>eight Hours.</HI> I commonly mix'd them in some <HI>cordial Julep,</HI> according to the Temper and Circumstances of the Patient. In <HI>great Stuffage</HI> of the Lungs &amp; Breast, I gave them in some <HI>pectoral Mixture:</HI> Tho' sometimes they checked the <HI>Salivation</HI> in the <HI>Confluent</HI> Sort, yet it returned soon with <HI>diluting Diet.</HI></P>
<P>As to <HI>purging the Body after the Small-Pox;</HI> I have found it generally necessary. For want of it, many break out in <HI>Boils</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have found a <HI>Vomit</HI> more serviceable than a <HI>Purge.</HI> For want of it, many times <HI>Purges,</HI> tho' very strong, work not at all: tho' on the same Persons the same <HI>Purge</HI> would work much in a much less Dose.</P>
<P>If the Patient was <HI>weak,</HI> I <HI>began</HI> with <HI>Rubarb</HI> or <HI>Pill Ruffi:</HI> and <HI>then</HI> after some Time, gave <HI>Jallap</HI> or <HI>Pill Cochiae Minor.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Small Pox by Inoculation. in 1730.</HEAD>
<P>I Entred upon it with the utmost <HI>Caution,</HI> and was careful to use it by the best <HI>Rules</HI> I could find prescribed.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Matter</HI> I made use of; I endeavoured to take it of a <HI>wholsome Person,</HI> of a <HI>favourable distinct Sort</HI> of <HI>Pock,</HI> well <HI>ripe, white,</HI> and of a <HI>due Consistence,</HI> and <HI>without Smell.</HI> This, as long as it would keep thus, I made use of; having kept it in the Month of <HI>March a Fortnight,</HI> and us'd it with as good Success as any just taken. I always kept it in <HI>a cool Place,</HI> contrary to the common Precepts about it, to keep it warm 'till it was used. When I could get it from an <HI>inoculated Person</HI> I chose it; having by Experience found it to yield the <HI>most favourable Pock.</HI> I have used the <HI>third Produce</HI> with the best Effect.</P>
<P>If the Patient was <HI>very full of Blood</HI> and liv'd <HI>intemperate∣ly;</HI> I bled him before the Incision was made. And if there were any Signs of <HI>Foulness</HI> at the <HI>Stomach</HI> or <HI>Bowels;</HI> I <HI>vomited,</HI> or <HI>purged</HI> them, and ordered them <HI>Temperance</HI> in <HI>Eating</HI> and <HI>Drinking. Meat</HI> I allowed of the <HI>easiest Digestion,</HI> but <HI>once</HI> a Day, and that in Moderation. <HI>Strong Drink</HI> I forbad, save a <HI>Glass</HI> of <HI>Wine</HI> at <HI>Meals.</HI> Above all, I charged them to <HI>keep out of the Way</HI> of receiving the <HI>Infection</HI> in the <HI>common Way</HI> as much as possible.</P>
<P>I made the <HI>Incisions</HI> in <HI>each Arm only,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> in a <HI>Legg;</HI> having observed <HI>great</HI> Inconvenience to arise from an Inci∣sion made in the <HI>Leg</HI> by the <HI>Humours</HI> falling down into it.</P>
<P>I made the Incision <HI>not</HI> in the <HI>upper Side</HI> of the <HI>Arm,</HI> where <HI>Issues</HI> are made; having found great Inconvenience by that Method: for this Way, a <HI>Pond</HI> was made after a while, which <HI>contained</HI> the Matter 'till it was dressed; so that the Orifice was made much larger, and a <HI>Sinus</HI> often produced where the Humours were very sharp.</P>
<P>I therefore chose to make it in the <HI>lower Part</HI> of the <HI>Arm above</HI> the <HI>Elbow;</HI> where the Matter vented itself as
<PB N="14" REF="006947_0017_102AD1E8C5320460"/>
soon as it was made, and remained not in a Body in the Place of Incision. This Way I found they run more freely, and yet corroded the Flesh not so much.</P>
<P>I chose <HI>not</HI> to dress my Patients Incisions <HI>my self,</HI> for fear of carrying the Infection to them, 'till they began to com∣plain of the Symptoms of the Small-Pox; but directed them to dress them themselves, or <HI>some</HI> Body else for them that would no Ways <HI>endanger</HI> them. I took Care <HI>not</HI> to bind the <HI>Roller</HI> too hard; having found a <HI>Tumour</HI> to arise often upon too strict a Bandage, which needed <HI>Poulticing</HI> with <HI>white Bread and Milk</HI> to abate it.</P>
<P>I saw <HI>no</HI> Need of making the <HI>Incisions large</HI> or <HI>deep,</HI> or putting <HI>much</HI> of the Matter in; having found upon Trial, the <HI>least Incisions</HI> if deep enough to make the <HI>Blood come,</HI> to answer as well as the largest; and the very <HI>least Part</HI> of Matter to answer as well as a <HI>great deal.</HI></P>
<P>I have found <HI>two Incisions</HI> in grown Persons to answer much better than <HI>one only.</HI> I observed those that had <HI>but one,</HI> had the most Pock, and the most troublesome Symp∣toms of Pains. Swellings &amp;c. Tho' in <HI>Infants,</HI> I have found <HI>one</HI> to answer very well.</P>
<P>The <HI>first Dress</HI> was with a <HI>simple Diachylon Plaister.</HI> When the Incision was made, I carefully laid a Bit of <HI>Lint</HI> im∣bibed well with the Matter, over or in the Incision: and hav∣ing put the Plaister over it, I bound it on, and let it lie 24 <HI>Hours;</HI> and then took off the Plaister and Lint, and having wiped the Plaister clean, laid it on again, throwing away the Lint; and so continued to dress daily till the <HI>third</HI> or <HI>fourth Day,</HI> when the Incision began to open and be a little inflamed; and then I dressed it with a <HI>Pledget</HI> arm'd with <HI>Basilicon</HI> laid over the Incision, and the same Plaister laid over it. This I found the best Dress; it both draw'd and digested, and kept the Arm easy.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Incisions</HI> were <HI>much inflamed,</HI> I found nothing so effectual as a <HI>Poultice</HI> of <HI>white Bread &amp; Milk</HI> apply'd warm, and renewed <HI>twice a Day,</HI> and oftner if Need called for it. Sometimes when it was apt to breed a <HI>Fungus,</HI> I dress'd it with <HI>Liniment: Areaei,</HI> which answered well.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="006947_0018_102AD1EA97E94AC8"/>
If the Incisions are <HI>not</HI> dressed <HI>twice a Day</HI> at least, and sometimes <HI>three Times;</HI> when they come to run much, they are very apt to be <HI>much inflamed;</HI> and I have seen a <HI>Morti∣fication</HI> soon gather. When the Incisions do <HI>not</HI> run well; I fear a <HI>troublesome</HI> and <HI>full Pock,</HI> and have often seen many <HI>Swellings</HI> to arise about the <HI>Arm</HI> especially; which if taken in Time would quickly yield to a <HI>Poultice</HI> of <HI>white Bread and Milk</HI> better than any Thing else; and when <HI>those</HI> are gone, <HI>others</HI> to arise and create much Trouble.</P>
<P>I always observed the <HI>Incisions</HI> to run <HI>much</HI> at the <HI>Turning,</HI> and more <HI>now</HI> than at any Time else.</P>
<P>I <HI>never</HI> endeavoured to <HI>stop</HI> the Running of the <HI>Incisions</HI> by Restringents; but continued in the Dress of <HI>Basilicon</HI> or <HI>Liniment: Areaei,</HI> with the <HI>Plaister</HI> over it; and with <HI>this Dress</HI> I encouraged them to Dress, 'till they run exceedingly.</P>
<P>When there appeared a <HI>large Sinus</HI> all round under the Skin; be not forward to cut it, but dress it carefully by filling it full of <HI>fresh white Break and Milk.</HI> This I have seen cure a <HI>very large one,</HI> in which I could carry my Finger clear round half an Inch under the Skin. If it must be cut, dress it with a little <HI>Liniment:</HI> with a <HI>few Grains</HI> of <HI>Mercurius Dulcis,</HI> and wash it with <HI>Lime Water.</HI></P>
<P>I found the more the <HI>Incisions run,</HI> the more favourable the Pock and all the Symptoms were. I therefore encou∣raged the <HI>Running</HI> as much as I could: but <HI>not</HI> by <HI>corrosive, pungent</HI> Plaisters, as <HI>Hat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase</HI> &amp;c; but only by <HI>Basilicon, Lini∣ment: Areaei, Cabbage-Leaf</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The most troublesome Symptoms of <HI>Fever, Coma,</HI> and <HI>Tumours</HI> in the <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Glandulus Parts,</HI> was in a Negro Girl; whose <HI>Incision</HI> run but very <HI>little.</HI> I gave lit∣tle or no Medicine, 'till the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of the Small Pox appeared, but <HI>Elixir Proprietatis,</HI> which I order'd to be drank often in Water; and to abstain from <HI>Meat;</HI> and to live upon a <HI>smoothing, diluting Diet.</HI></P>
<P>When I saw the <HI>Spmptoms</HI> of the Small Pox beginning, I was very watchful to observe them. If the <HI>Fever, Pains,</HI> and <HI>Sickness</HI> were <HI>favourable;</HI> I chose to do nothing, but <HI>leave the Work to Nature.</HI> If the <HI>Fever</HI> was <HI>very high;</HI> I chose to lower it with a <HI>cooling diluting</HI> Diet, of <HI>Milk and Water, Water</HI> with a <HI>Toast</HI> in it, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="006947_0019_102AD1EC1CC7B0E8"/>
I <HI>never</HI> yet saw a Necessity of <HI>Bleeding</HI> any of my Pa∣tients, but <HI>one;</HI> who had taken <HI>cold,</HI> and thereby fix'd a <HI>great Pain</HI> in his <HI>Side.</HI> Neither did I ever observe any Advan∣tage by <HI>Bleeding,</HI> but the contrary. The <HI>Pock</HI> was <HI>retarded,</HI> and the <HI>Patient</HI> much weakned.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Fever</HI> continued 'till the <HI>third Day</HI> of Complaint, and no <HI>Eruption</HI> appeared; I applied <HI>Blisters,</HI> which answered for the most Part to draw forth the Pock, and abate the Fever; and if Need required, <HI>Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet.</HI> If there were any Signs of <HI>Foulness</HI> of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> I gave a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Ipecacuanha.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes <HI>Convulsions</HI> arose in <HI>Children</HI> before the Eruption, which went off themselves, or with <HI>Blisters &amp; Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet.</HI> Sometimes they lay <HI>comatous</HI> and <HI>restless,</HI> which I relieved by <HI>Blisters &amp; Alexipharmic Julep<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to drive out the Pustules. When once the <HI>Eruption</HI> was made, the <HI>troublesome Symptoms</HI> went off for the most Part. However I endeavour∣ed by some <HI>gentle Alexipharmic Julep</HI> to forward the Growth and Ripening of the Pock. I found <HI>little Need</HI> of <HI>Anodynes:</HI> tho' if they were <HI>very sore</HI> and <HI>restless,</HI> I always gave them. If they were <HI>very full</HI> of the Pock, I treated them in all Respects as in the <HI>common Small Pox.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>most of my Patients</HI> were <HI>very favourably</HI> dealt with: more than 50 out of 65; were sitting up and walking about the Room soon after the Eruption was well made.</P>
<P><HI>But one died</HI> that I inoculated: which was a <HI>Child</HI> 8 <HI>Weeks old,</HI> and under the Disadvantage of <HI>losing a full Breast,</HI> and put to <HI>one</HI> that was <HI>very disagreable before</HI> to the Child, and <HI>now much more</HI> so by the <HI>Distress</HI> of the <HI>Nurse</HI> (who was the Mother) not only with <HI>that</HI> Child but with <HI>three more</HI> Chil∣dren in the same Room. The Pock had its Course <HI>favoura∣bly enough;</HI> appear'd the 9th <HI>Day,</HI> and turned the 15th: but the <HI>Bowels</HI> fill'd daily with <HI>Wind,</HI> for want of proper <HI>Nou∣rishment,</HI> and at length threw the Child into <HI>Convulsions,</HI> of which it died on the 22d. <HI>Two</HI> more were <HI>very full</HI> but <HI>not dangerous. One</HI> had a <HI>flat Pock;</HI> which was also <HI>full,</HI> and did not turn 'till the <HI>ninth Day;</HI> followed with hard <HI>Tumours</HI> in the <HI>Arms</HI> for many Days, which were all dissipated with the <HI>white Bread Poultice</HI> only.</P>
