<HEAD>An Essay, concerning Silver and Paper Currency.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>APER Currency at a great Dis∣count,</HI> has prevailed for several Years in many of our <HI>Colonies,</HI> and by Ad∣vocates for it both in Conversation and Print, deluding the People with false Appearances and Repre∣sentations; it is likely to continue and multiply amongst us to greater Disadvantages than ever: As ap∣pears by the late large labouring Emission of 90,000 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>Maryland,</HI> the enacted but not as yet current Emission of 48,300 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>New York,</HI> the printed Projection for 180 000 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>this Province,</HI> and by the Apprehensions we are under of a further <HI>Rhode Island</HI> Emission.</P>
<P>In Affairs of this Nature, a true historical Account of Facts and their Consequences, is called <HI>political Experi∣ence</HI>; and as Things are more naturally understood by their Eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts, than by their Principles: I shall endeavour, by relating bare historical Facts, concerning <HI>Currencies,</HI> with some short Remarks upon the same; to set our <HI>Plantation Paper Currencies,</HI> more especially with Regard to this Province, in a true Light.</P>
<P><HI>Silver</HI> be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng a staple Merchandize all over the World, as well as an adequate Pledge, did naturally, and by the Consent of all trading Nations, become the <HI>universal Currency</HI> or Medium, by which Goods are bartered and Contracts m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de: Therefore <HI>Silver</HI> (ascertained in Weight

and Fineness) <HI>Coin</HI> ought to be the only legal Tender in the Trade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all Countries. The Varieties of compu∣tative or <HI>nummary Denominations</HI> of different Countries, are no Hindrance; they are reconciled or adjusted by, what is called, the <HI>Par of Exchange.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Par of Exchange,</HI> is the intrinsick Value (in Weight and Fineness) of the <HI>Silver Coin</HI> or Denominations of one Country, reduced to the like Value of Denomina∣tions of another Country. Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Table of the Assays, Weights, and sterling Values of foreign Coins, published by Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot,</HI> A 1727, is a proper Standard. From this no Country swerves, excepting by a small Variation, called, the <HI>Difference of Exchange.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Difference of Exchange,</HI> is a small <HI>Premium</HI> allowed for the Trouble and Risque of having Silver (that uni∣versal Staple and Medium of Trade) remitted to answer the <HI>Ballance of Trade</HI>; according as the Imports and Ex∣ports of Countries in other Goods, do exceed one the other. The printed <HI>Prices current</HI> of several trading Towns, from Time to Time informs us of this.</P>
<P>Originally the <HI>nummary Denomination of Silver,</HI> seems to have been the same as its Weight or <HI>ponderal Deno∣mination</HI> It would have been happy and <HI>facile</HI> for the World, if it had so continued; but from the <HI>corrupt civil Administrations</HI> (not from the Ballance of Trade) from Time to Time, in all Countries, the Value of the Num∣mary from that of the ponderal Denomination has been altered, <HI>to Defraud Creditors,</HI> and more especially to cheat the Creditors of the publick.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> for many Ages before the 14th <HI>Century,</HI> the <HI>nummary Pound</HI> was the same with the Pound weight of Silver (this was in a proper Sense the <HI>natural Pound</HI>) that is a computative <HI>Pound</HI> Sterling was 12 <HI>Oz</HI> of Silver, a <HI>Mark,</HI> or 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s 8 <HI>Oz</HI> of Silver. <HI>Iniquitous Ad∣ministrations</HI> since the Beginning of the 14<HI>th</HI> Century, have from Time to Time, reduced the nummary Deno∣minations to a less Value than its Weight, and cheated Creditors of some Part of their just Dues and Demands: For the Space of about 250 Years the Weight of Silver in the several nummary Denominations, has at Times, been lessened (that is the nummary Denominations de∣preciated) excepting in the Minority of <HI>Henry</HI> VI. when the <HI>Denomination call'd a Shilling</HI> rose from 142 <HI>Gr</HI> to 176 <HI>Gr.</HI> of fine Silver; but during the Confusions occasi∣oned by the hot Disputes, between the Families of <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="004238_0004_10042a5539b59710"/>
and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> it fell again to 142 <HI>Gr</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it continued un∣til the arbitrary Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, it fell more and more, and <HI>A</HI> 1546 it was only 40 <HI>Gr; A</HI> 1551 by the bad Administration of the <HI>Duke of Somerset</HI> Lord Pro∣tector in the Minority of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. it was reduced to 20 <HI>Gr.</HI> but immediately after the <HI>Duke of Somerset's</HI> be∣ing beheaded, it rose to 88 <HI>Gr.</HI> and remained so, until <HI>A.</HI> 1601 it suffered a small Reduction to 86 <HI>Gr.</HI> where it continues to this Day. Thus <HI>our present nummary Pound</HI> contains only about 4 <HI>Oz. of Silver,</HI> that is only one Third of what it originally contained.</P>
<P>In all other Nations the like has been done in bad Administrations. The <HI>Dutch Pond Ulams</HI> (6 Guilders) which originally contained 12 <HI>Oz Silver,</HI> at present is 2 <HI>Oz Silver.</HI> The <HI>French Livre</HI> originally was a Pound or 12 <HI>Oz. Silver,</HI> at present it is reduced to 4 <HI>Penny weight of Silver.</HI></P>
<P>These almost incredible Depravations of the several <HI>nummary Denominations,</HI> had not the least Relation to the <HI>Ballance of Trade,</HI> and the most considerable of them happened in Times prior to their several Nations being much concerned in Trade; excepting what happened in <HI>France</HI> in the End of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and Beginning of <HI>Lewis</HI> XV. Reigns; <HI>Silver from a Mark or</HI> 8 Oz <HI>at</HI> 27 Livres <HI>was at length</HI> A. 1719 <HI>imposed upon the People at</HI> 120 <HI>Livres:</HI> The Iniquity of the Administration, not the Ballance of Trade was the Cause. Trade has quite a different Operation, and in Fact ever since Trade be∣came extensive in <HI>England,</HI> that is, in the last 180 Years, the nummary Denominations have lost only 2 <HI>in</HI> 88 <HI>Gr.</HI> The Credit of <HI>Merchants</HI> in the commercial World is be∣come more sacred, than the Probity of <HI>Ministers</HI> in the civil Administration, and is a Check upon them Ever since the <HI>French</HI> began to have Commerce truly at Heart, which at present they seem to have as much, if not more, than their Neighbours; that is, ever since the Beginning of <HI>Cardinal Fleuri</HI>'s Administration, there has been no Alteration in their Coin and Denominations.</P>
<P>In <HI>Europe</HI> all Nations have had the Ballance of Trade sometimes in their Favour, sometimes against them; and each of them more or less at different Times; foreign Wars, civil Wars, Loss of Trade, Increase in Trade; without altering the Value of their <HI>nummary Denomina∣tions</HI> in Respect of standard Silver.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004238_0005_10042a5a26e5a058"/>In all the <HI>American Colonies</HI> at their first Settling, and from some Years thereafter, their <HI>Currency</HI> was the same, with that of their Mother-Country: But by the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of some Administrations, all of them have <HI>cheated</HI> their Cre∣ditors at Home, in lessening the Value of their <HI>nummary Denominations</HI>: Thus the <HI>Dutch Colonies</HI> have cheated 20 <HI>per Cent</HI> a <HI>Holland Guilder</HI> passes with them for 24 <HI>Stivers</HI>: The <HI>French Settlements,</HI> have defrauded their Principles at Home 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>British Plantations</HI> originally an <HI>English Crown</HI> was 5 <HI>s.</HI> Denomination; in Process of Time, they re∣mitted to their Creditors at Home a <HI>Piece of Eight,</HI> which is only 4 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> Sterling, at the Rate of 5 <HI>s.</HI>; some Time after that in most of our Colonies this <HI>Piece of Eight</HI> was paid away to their Creditors at 6 <HI>s.</HI> and would have gone further, by <HI>Persons in Debt</HI> getting into the Administra∣tion or Power of defrauding their Creditors; if the Mer∣chants at Home had not procured an Act of Parliament called the <HI>Plantation Act,</HI> whereby a <HI>Piece of Eight</HI> in all our Colonies was fixed at 6 <HI>s.</HI> for 6 <HI>s.</HI> 10 <HI>d., per Oz. Silver</HI>: In these Colonies, who upon this Act passed their Silver by Weight only as a Currency (<HI>Barbados, Ber∣mudas,</HI> &amp;c.) it continues so to this Day, being 33 <HI>per Cent. Exchange</HI>: But in some of the Colonies <HI>(Leeward West India Islands, New York, New England)</HI> not using Weight, they continue to carry on the Cheat by passing a light clipt Piece of Eight for 6 <HI>s.</HI> which is about 8 <HI>s. per Oz Silver</HI>; there being no Bounds to their Clipping, they were obliged to come into the Use of Weights, but continued the Ounce of Silver at 8 <HI>s.</HI> Denomination, is 50 <HI>per Cent Exchange.</HI> In many of our Colonies they have gone greater Lengths, and by Floods of <HI>provincial Paper Credit</HI> or Money, they have made vile Work of it; <HI>so that Exchange with Sterling is at present in</HI> Jersies <HI>and</HI> Pensilvania 60 <HI>or</HI> 70 per Cent. <HI>Advance</HI>; Maryland 100 <HI>per Cent.; the</HI> New England <HI>Colonies and</HI> Nova Scotia 400 <HI>per Cent</HI>: South Carolina, 700 <HI>per Cent; and</HI> North Caro∣lina <HI>still worse. (Virginia</HI> have gone astray the least, be∣ing at present only 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> worse than Sterling) thus that salutary <HI>Proclamation Act</HI> was frustrated: seeing the late Instruction relating to this Affair, to his Governours is not regarded, <HI>we could not complain if the British Parliament should take Cognizance of the same.</HI> This leads me to the Article of Paper Currency.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004238_0006_10042a6095331bd8"/>Because in common Equity, nothing ought to be a <HI>Tender in Trade</HI> in any particular Country, but what is a general Tender all over the commercial World, Trans∣fers in the <HI>Bank of Amsterdam</HI> are an Exception, because of their universal commercial Credit, and their being bet∣ter than common Currency) the Wisdom of the <HI>British</HI> Legislature, have not thought it convenient to make our Paper Effects; that is <HI>Bank, East India and South-Sea Trans∣fers; Bank Notes, East India and South Sea Company Bonds,</HI> a legal Tender: Notwithstanding of their being better than Silver, being at any Time reducable to Silver; so that they are as <HI>Cash bearing Interest</HI> (Bank Notes excepted) which Silver Cash does not: Hence it is that in Exchange for (Silver) Currency they bear a <HI>Premium.</HI></P>
<P>I shall, here give some <HI>Instances of the bad Effects of Paper Currency made a legal Tender.</HI> The Arbitrary Go∣vernment of <HI>France,</HI> after much Damage done to the Subjects in depreciating their nummary Denominations by <HI>recoinages</HI>; did <HI>A.</HI> 1719, to compleat their Misery, em∣brace Mr. <HI>Law</HI>'s Project of a <HI>Paper Currency</HI>; Silver was banished by severe Penalties, Paper was made the only legal Tender. The Operation was; the Nation reduced to the utmost Confusion, Mr. <HI>Law</HI> and his Abettor Mr. <HI>D'Argenson</HI> were disgraced; Silver again introduced as a Currency, and the only legal Tender.</P>
<P>Baron <HI>Gortz</HI> about 20 Years ago, had reduced <HI>Sweden</HI> to extreme Misery, by imposing <HI>Government Notes</HI> instead of Specie. Upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Death, the <HI>Baron</HI> suffered capital Punishment, this being one of the prin∣cipal Crimes alledged against him. The Paper Currency was called in; the Silver and Copper Currency was re∣stored, upon the same footing as before <HI>Charles</HI> XII. Ac∣cession.</P>
<P>We have a very good Instance in one of our own <HI>Co∣lonies. Barbados A.</HI> 1702 emitted 16,000 <HI>l. Bills</HI> of Credit on <HI>Funds,</HI> to be brought in again by a <HI>Tax of</HI> 3 s. 9 d. <HI>on Negroes:</HI> At first they passed at a Discount, but no more being then emitted, and the Time of the coming in being at Hand, they rose again to near Par. Encouraged by this, they made a large Emission of 30,000 <HI>l. Bills on Land security</HI> at 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> payable after 5 Years: These Bills immediately fell to 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> below Silver; but by an Order from Home they were all called in soon, and their Currency became Silver Value as before. <HI>Ballance of Trade</HI> had not the least Concern here.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004238_0007_10042a641dddb4c8"/><HI>A Paper Credit</HI> well founded and under good Regu∣lations, and not larger than what the Silver Specie Cur∣rency will bear; has been found to be a very good Ex∣pedient in Business, and it leaves the <HI>Silver Species</HI> at more Liberty to be used as Merchandize, and for petty Occasi∣ons. In <HI>Holland</HI> all large Transactions are in <HI>Bank Transfers of Amsterdam,</HI> their Credit being better than that of the Government, and their Bank Money 3 a 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than the common Currency. The Use and Credit of the <HI>Bank Notes in England</HI> we all know, their Fund being a valuable Depositum, a Call upon Oc∣casion on the Proprietors, and about <HI>Ten Millions</HI> Sterling in the Government's Hands; yet their Notes are no le∣gal Tender. <HI>If Paper Credit exceeds a certain Proportion of the concomitant Silver Currency, its Effects are bad, and ruinous</HI>; by its precarious Loss of Value. The <HI>Bank of Venice</HI> was originally two Millions of <HI>Ducats</HI> given in, and Bills to a limited Sum given out, upon the Security of the same: This Scheme was so good that their Bank Money became 28 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than common Curren∣cy: from this good Success the Government allowed them to issue out more Bills, only to the Value of 300,000 <HI>Ducats</HI>; this small Addition brought down their Bills to 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Advance. <HI>N. B.</HI> By continued Additions they might have brought them down to Par, and from thence to a Discount, even so low as 400 <HI>per Cent,</HI> as is our Case at present.</P>
<P><HI>Our Province Bills from the various Operations of fre∣quent large Emissions, distant Periods, and Periods postpon'd; are become</HI> 400 per Cent. <HI>worse than Sterling, and above</HI> 200 per Cent. <HI>worse than themselves</HI> 25 <HI>Years ago.</HI></P>
<P>All well regulated Corporations are restricted, to issue Bills or Notes not exceeding a certain Value: Thus it is with <HI>English Bank Notes, East-India and South Sea Com∣panies Bonds</HI>; lest by too large Emissions, they might de∣preciate their Notes and Bonds, to the Damage of the So¦ciety itself, and Creditors. The <HI>King</HI> by an Instruction to his <HI>Governour</HI> of this Province, limits us to 30,000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> (to be understood Proclamation Money or its Value) for extraordinary Charges of Government.</P>
<P>The principal Design of a Currency or <HI>Medium</HI> of Trade, is to avoid the Inconveniencies of <HI>Barter:</HI> Paper Currency in large Quantities does not answer this End; because of its Fluctuation, or rather progressive less Value; which obliges the Merchant at length to return to <HI>Bar∣ter</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="004238_0008_10042a6d690deef8"/>
again, as being safe and better. In <HI>South Carolina,</HI> the Quantity of Paper Currency has so depreciated itself, that all considerable Contracts, are made, not in Pro∣vince Bills, but in their Produce <HI>Rice.</HI> In <HI>North Caro∣lina</HI> their Produce, they call <HI>Specie,</HI> is 50 to 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better than their Paper Currency.</P>
<P><HI>Silver</HI> is a staple Merchandize, an adequate Pledge, and an universal commercial <HI>Medium.</HI> Our <HI>Province Bills</HI> have no intrinsick Value, and as a Depositum, are no better than waste Paper; they are no exportable Mer∣chandize, and receivable no where but in <HI>New England,</HI> being only an ill contrived provincial or <HI>municipal Medi∣um. Barter</HI> is Merchandize (not so staple, and more bulky and perishing than Silver) exportable, and upon that Account preferable to Province Bills as a <HI>Medium.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Virginia, Tobacco</HI> is their <HI>Medium,</HI> and answers bet∣ter than Paper, because it is an exportable staple Merchandize. Let us suppose, that at any Time it should become (as are our Bills) not exportable, and that Laws should be made there from Time to Time, for planting of greater Quantities, to increase their Medium; it would become in Course such a <HI>Drug,</HI> that more and more of it would be given, for a certain Quantity of Silver or any other Goods, and at length be of no Value; but if their Government being sensible of their Error, should forbid planting above such a Quantity, their <HI>Me∣dium</HI> would become good as before.</P>
<P>As to the Quantity of Paper Currency which the Sil∣ver Currency will bear, without depreciating its Deno∣minations; it is only to be learnt by Experience. In <HI>New England</HI> we found that <HI>A.</HI> 1713 there were 194,000<HI>l.</HI> in Province Bills at <HI>Par</HI> with Silver at 8 <HI>s. per Oz.</HI> When we began to exceed that Sum, our Paper began to loose of its Value: Here we ought to have stopt and kept within that Sum in our future Emissions. <HI>New York</HI> never exceed 40,000 <HI>l.</HI> in Province Bills (at present only about 37,000 <HI>l.</HI>) and so kept up their Value at 8 <HI>s. per Oz. Silver.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The larger</HI> the Paper Currency of any Country, <HI>the more it labours,</HI> and is circulated to the greater Disadvantage. The greatest Quantity of <HI>Exchequer Bills in England</HI> (never were made a legal Tender but in Taxes) at one Time extant was <HI>A.</HI> 1716, being a 4,596,184 <HI>l.</HI> Debt, much of it contracted in the bad Administrations of the latter End of Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s Reign; Notwithstanding of their
<PB N="8" REF="004238_0009_10042a70e63255e8"/>
being above one Fourth of the Nation's Currency their being receivable in <HI>Taxes</HI> and all Treasury Affairs, and bearing Interest 3 <HI>per Cent. per Annum</HI>; they began to depreciate, and the Government was obliged to allow the <HI>Bank</HI> an Annuity to cancel <HI>Two Millions</HI> Sterling Value of them, and 3 <HI>per Cent. Premium</HI> to circulate, and specify the Remainder while above One Million, and afterwards only 1 <HI>per Cent. Premium. Anno</HI> 1702 there were extant <HI>Two Millions Sterling Value in Exchequer Notes,</HI> the Government allows the Bank 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> to circulate them while above One Million, and 1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> when not exceeding One Million. Since that Time, if <HI>Exchequer Notes</HI> are at any Time used towards defraying the Charges of Government, they are honestly paid off next Sessions of <HI>Parliament.</HI> The last Emission of <HI>Ex¦chequer Notes</HI> was <HI>A</HI> 1730, being 510,000 <HI>l.</HI> towards the Charges of that Year, and were paid off <HI>A.</HI> 1731, the Year following.</P>
<P>If <HI>Paper Credit upon future Taxes or upon Loan,</HI> would answer as a <HI>Medium</HI>; how is it that the Govern∣ments in <HI>Europe,</HI> find it so intricate an Affair to raise Mo∣ney for publick Charges in Time of War,or other extra∣ordinary Occasions? When attempted by arbitrary Go∣vernments, they always tend to the Ruin of the Subject: The State Bills of <HI>France</HI> in King <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. last War, were sold at 50 or 60 <HI>per Cent. Discount.</HI> Baron <HI>Gorz</HI>'s State Bills in <HI>Sweden</HI> were Part of the Crimes for which he suffered Death.</P>
<P>Upon any extraordinary Emergency or Charge incur'd by the Government (we were by the King's Instructi∣on allowed to emit, not exceeding 30,000 <HI>l. Proclamati∣on Value per Ann.</HI>) it may be proper to satisfie it, by publick Bills of Credit, to be received again next Year in <HI>Taxes.</HI> This is only good Oeconomy, to lay Part of the extraordinary Charge of a preceeding Year, upon the Taxes of the Year following; they will be as good as Silver Cash, or better, if the Circulation is encouraged by a 5 <HI>per Cent. Premium</HI> or advance Allowance in the Treasury. By this good Management of cancelling the Bills in a Year or two, we kept up their Credit till <HI>A</HI> 1713.</P>
<P>To emit large Sums of Paper Money, upon Funds of <HI>Taxes</HI> payable after many Years; or upon <HI>Loans</HI> not to be paid in until after 10, 20, or 45 Years, as are the last Payments in <HI>Maryland,</HI> is leaving a heavy Debt of
<PB N="9" REF="004238_0010_10042a7a217a3c78"/>
Funds and Loans, contracted by our own Extravagancies and perverse Humours; as a Burden, to be discharged by the succeeding Generation. As it is a natural Instinct in Animals to provide for Posterity, it must be deem'd very <HI>unnatural and wicked</HI> in us, instead of doing so, to contribute to their future Misery.</P>
<P>So much Paper as is current in a Province, <HI>so much re∣ally is that Province in Debt</HI>; for the <HI>Funds</HI> Part, the Publick is in Debt; for the <HI>Loans</HI> Part, private Persons are in Debt: It is a Contradiction co assert that a Coun∣try my <HI>grow rich by</HI> (Paper Money) <HI>running in Debt?</HI> As neither Publick nor Private are now ashamed to con∣tinue in Debt, we may say of those Paper-Money Coun∣tries, with Regard to their Mother-Country; what is commonly said, and is in Fact true of many of our Shop∣keepers with Regard to the Merchants; if they would be rich they must run boldly in Debt, and not be asham'd of being dunn'd.</P>
<P>If a private Man's Notes or Bonds are negotiated at a Discount, he is deem'd a <HI>Bankrupt</HI> capable of paying only — in the Pound. So it may be said of our Colonies, with Paper Currencies at a great Discount; and the Discount encreasing daily, they are in a State of <HI>lawless Bankrupcy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Private Credit</HI> or Notes on a good solid Foundation, are <HI>better than publick Bills</HI>; the former cannot, <HI>impune,</HI> break their <HI>Faith</HI>; they are under Coercion: The pub∣lick is the Dernier resort and in bad Administrations fre∣quently break their <HI>publick Faith.</HI> Hence, the Credit of a well regulated Commerce or Corporation, is bet∣ter than that of the civil Administration; <HI>the Bank Money of</HI> Venice <HI>is</HI> 20 <HI>per Cent. of</HI> Hamburg 12 <HI>per Cent. of</HI> Holland 5 <HI>per Cent. better than common</HI> Currency.</P>
<P>This private commercial Credit in all polite Nations, is so sacred at present, that the <HI>civil Government stand corrected by it.</HI> The Generality of the <HI>united Provinces</HI> did <HI>A</HI> 1693 coin alloy'd Pieces called <HI>quaad Schellings</HI> at 6 <HI>Stivers,</HI> being near 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> above their intrinsick Value. The <HI>Bank</HI> retain'd their Integrity, and it again rose to 13 or 15 <HI>per Cent.</HI> this obliged the Government to reduce these <HI>Schellings</HI> to 5 and an Half <HI>Stivers</HI> their intrinsick Value, and have continued so ever since, and the Agio of the Bank fell to 3 or 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> as formerly. <HI>A</HI> 1720, <HI>France</HI> being in the most dismal Confusion, by their Paper Currency, their Court was obliged to apply
<PB N="10" REF="004238_0011_10042a7bdcb6ccb0"/>
to the Merchants and Bankers for their Advice, concern∣ing a Method to be used to find out the natural Pro∣portion between publick Bills and Silver Species, and to <HI>limit their Paper Effects</HI> to a certain Sum.</P>
<P>A plain Illustration, that Private is better than publick Credit, we have amongst ourselves. Our <HI>Merchant's Notes,</HI> so called, being well founded, were 11 and an Half <HI>per Cent.</HI> in <HI>Decemb</HI> 1737, will be 18 <HI>per Cent.</HI> in <HI>Decem.</HI> 1738, 12 and an Half <HI>per Cent.</HI> (3 7ths of them then paid off) in <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1739, 19 and an Half <HI>per Cent.</HI> in <HI>Decem.</HI> 1740, 26 and an Half <HI>per Cent.</HI> in <HI>Decemb</HI> 1741, and 34 <HI>per Cent.</HI> in <HI>Decemb</HI> 1742, better than the present Value of our Province Bills at 27 <HI>per Cent.</HI>; because they are continually growing better, until they come to their fixed Value, at which they are to be paid off.</P>
<P>The Scheme for emitting of 60,000<HI>l. Bills of the new Tenour,</HI> equal to is 180,000<HI>l</HI> of the common <HI>New England</HI> Bills, by Undertakers or Subscribers, probably will drop, and therefore requires no Disquisition: Only we may observe 1<HI>st.</HI> The Emission is too large, and the Periods too distant. 2<HI>dly.</HI> The Subscribers or Circulators require a good <HI>Premium</HI>; because if let go, at the Rate of 27 <HI>s. per Oz. Silver,</HI> the present Value of our Currency, and it is paid in again 1 10th yearly, at 20 <HI>s. per Oz.</HI> Value, al∣lowing for their Profits by Interest; every 1000 <HI>l. new Tenour, that is</HI> 3000 <HI>l. common Currency, will loose</HI> 262 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.:</HI> If Silver rise higher, as it naturally does upon all large Paper Emissions, the Loss will be proportionably greater, after the Rate of 150 <HI>l for every Shilling advance upon the Ounce of Silver.</HI> 3<HI>dly.</HI> If the <HI>Assembly</HI> our Le∣gislature, being under no Coercion as private Banks are, should <HI>postpone</HI> the Periods of paying the Possessor; the Value of these Bills will further depreciate very much. 4<HI>thly.</HI> The grand Deformity of the Scheme is; that this Money shall <HI>answer all Specialties,</HI> past, present, and to come: The like was never imposed (seeing it is ordered to be printed, it may with Freedom be canvassed) upon the Subject, by the most arbitrary and iniquitous Govern∣ments in the World; particularly it is equivalent to a <HI>Bill of Attainder,</HI> against every one of the Committee or Subscribers of the <HI>Merchant</HI>'s <HI>Notes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Uncertainty and Confusion of Paper Currency</HI> in our several <HI>Colonies,</HI> and in the same Colony at different Times; might be illustrated by the History of the various Paper Currencies of our Colonies; but to avoid Prolixity▪ we
<PB N="11" REF="004238_0012_10042a7d67601018" MS="y"/>
shall only observe, That <HI>Massachusetts Bay</HI> in <HI>New Eng∣land</HI> led the Way, by an Act of <HI>Assembly</HI> in <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1690, emitting a small Sum in <HI>Province Bills</HI> or Deben∣tures, to satisfy some extraordinary Charges incurr'd by the expensive and fruitless Expedition to <HI>Canada</HI> that Year; afterwards more were issued towards the Charges of the succeeding Years: But were no legal Tender, on∣ly receivable for Taxes, and cancelled after a Year or two: Thus they kept up their Credit, and were <HI>at Par</HI> with Silver until <HI>A.</HI> 1713: From that Time, by Funds and Loans in large Sums they lost their Credit, and are at present 27 <HI>s. the Ounce of Silver.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Barbados</HI> followed our Example <HI>A.</HI> 1702, and by a large Emission upon Loan they run into Confusion; but by an Order from <HI>England</HI> they were cancelled, and the Island came immediately to rights again. <HI>South Carolina</HI> upon their Expedition against St. <HI>Augustine, A.</HI> 1702, began to issue Paper Money; by their subsequent large Emissions on Funds and Loans, and by their vile Breach of publick Faith in Postponings, have arrived to 42 <HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per Oz. Connecticut</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> their first Emission was <HI>A.</HI> 1709. <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> came into it <HI>A.</HI> 1710, as did <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> about the same Time; they are all over <HI>New-England</HI> 27 <HI>s. per Oz.</HI> Silver. <HI>New-York</HI>'s first Emission was <HI>A.</HI> 1734, as their present Currency does not exceed 37,000 <HI>l.,</HI> Silver with them is only 8 <HI>s.</HI> or 8 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per Oz. Jersey</HI>'s Bills are at the same Price. <HI>Pensylvania</HI> begun <HI>A.</HI> 1723, but do not exceed 69,000 <HI>l.</HI> and are at 8 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d</HI> to 9 <HI>s. per Oz</HI> of Sil∣ver. <HI>Maryland</HI>'s first Emission <HI>A.</HI> 1754, was of 90,000 <HI>l.</HI> at long Periods, and are at 10 <HI>s.</HI> to 11 <HI>s. per Oz</HI> of Silver.</P>
<P>A Glut of this Provincial confused Paper Currency, by frequent and large Emissions, did naturally make it a <HI>Drug,</HI> and cheaper than Silver the general Standard of Merchandize: So that the <HI>Merchant</HI> was obliged to ad∣vance upon his Goods, bought for Silver, &amp; sold for this Pa∣per; and in Consequence the Consumer of them obliged to raise the Price of <HI>his Labour and Country Produe,</HI> paid in Paper.</P>
<P>When <HI>Paper Money</HI> is in a continued Course of <HI>depre∣ciating,</HI> all Debts and other <HI>Contracts</HI> are paid in a less Value than they are contracted for; which is an unjust but natural Operation of this false <HI>Medium</HI>; the generous foreign Adventurer or <HI>Merchant,</HI> and consequently Trade in its genuine Sense, is hurt; the Gainers are the <HI>Shop∣keepers</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="004238_0013_10042a84b6017080"/>
and <HI>Merchant Hucksters,</HI> who have a long Credit from their Merchant, and abuse this Credit.</P>
<P>Large Emissions of Paper Currency, have <HI>encouraged the unwary Merchant</HI> at Home to send large Quantities of Goods, supposing our Money to be good: And therefore has a natural Tendency to make the Ballance of Trade against us, by increasing our Imports</P>
<P>A large Emission of publick <HI>Paper Credit on Loan,</HI> to be paid at a distant Period or long Credit; gives the despe∣rate and unthinking Borrowers or Subscribers, an Oppor∣tunity of <HI>ruining themselves,</HI> by taking up this Money and spending it extravagantly: <HI>Industry and Frugality</HI> (the only Means of becoming rich) are turned aside▪ In Place of being industrious, our young Men called Gen¦tlemen, follow no other Business but <HI>Drinking and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ming</HI>; many in Quality of Shopkeepers become <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Tradesmen of all Occupations in <HI>Boston, loi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> away much of their Time; the Husbandmen in the Country spend many idle Days in their little <HI>Rum Taverns.</HI> Frugali∣ty is superseeded by Prodigality and Extravagance, as is too aparent in our fine Houses and Furniture, Chaises and other Equipages, Velvets and Scarlets, rich Silks and Laces, &amp;c. The Parliament of <HI>Bretagne</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> in their Remonstrance to the Court of <HI>France, A.</HI> 1719, say,
<Q>That many of their Families are ruined by Paper Money, it gives an unbounded Loose to Excess in Ap∣parel and other Extravagancies</Q>
This is the natural Consequence of large Quantities of Paper Credit in all Countries.</P>
<P>These <HI>Extravagancies</HI> the Consequencies of our Paper Cur∣rency, hurt us as to the <HI>Ballance of Trade</HI> in both Respects: They encourage a Consumption of foreign Commodities, that is, they increase our <HI>Imports</HI>; instead of employing our Paper Credit to procure Exports, and to set up <HI>Ma∣nufactures</HI> and other Improvements; it is expended in fine Houses, Equipages, and Apparel, or to pay Debts contracted by a long Credit: The Hands employ'd in fitting out these Extravagancies, would have been more profitably employ'd, about Things for <HI>Exports,</HI> or in manufacturing such Things, as would have lessened our <HI>Imports.</HI></P>
<P>This leads us, to an <HI>Argument</HI> much used by some, in Favour of Paper Credit▪ <HI>viz. The fine Figure Boston now makes,</HI> in Houses, Equipages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is owing to it. This is Truth, but not to be boasted of, no Man is the richer
<PB N="13" REF="004238_0014_10042a8935cbce08"/>
for these Extravagancies, he thereby starves his Trade, and disappoints his Merchants and other Creditors: We are not to judge by Appearances only; <HI>Boston</HI> never was more extravagant and gay than at present, but never were more in Debt, never more incapable and back∣ward in paying Debts. From the repeated large Emis∣sions of Paper Credit, the Value of our <HI>nummary Deno∣minations</HI> did continually become less, and the Mer∣chants at Home were from Time to Time paid a less Va∣lue than they contracted for; thus, for a Debt contrac∣ted 25 Years ago, he now receives only 7 <HI>s. in the Pound,</HI> that is the Debtor (defrauds) retains 13 <HI>s.</HI> in the Pound of the Merchant's Money, and with this he builds fine Houses, makes Purchases, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>: Let us not boast of these Things, lest it may be said of our Posterity, and of those who are to enjoy them: <HI>Happy is the Child whose Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Devil</HI></P>
<P>Seeing then a Creditor paid in these <HI>depreciating De∣nominations,</HI> does not receive the Value he contracted for: is it possible that any Man (if in his right Senses) of a monied Estate, that is, in Cash, or out upon Bond or any other kind of Debt, can desire such a Moth of a Cur∣rency. Every Act for Emissions of large Sums of Paper Credit, unless upon a solid Fund, or to be cancelled in a Year or two by Taxes; may properly be called <HI>An Act for the Relief of insolvent Debtors</HI>; or rather, An Act to encourage and enable Debtors to defraud their Creditors, by com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unding at — <HI>Shillings</HI> in the Pound, and every Creditor looses thereby a certain Portion of his Estate. This is one of the most pernicious <HI>Operations</HI> of this Paper Credit, <HI>viz.</HI> That all who have the Art and Assurance of running in Debt, and postponing Payments from Time to Time, are in a certain Way of getting an Estate; to the Damage, or Ruin of their Creditors and Benefactors</P>
<P>In all Countries where there have been several sorts of Currencies at a Time; <HI>the basest only remains for com∣mon Currency:</HI> In <HI>Holland, quaad Schellings</HI> are now their common Currency. In our <HI>Leeward-Islands</HI> are two Currencies▪ <HI>viz</HI> Silver and Gold, upon unequal footing; Silver being upon the best footing is shipt off, Gold re∣mains; and in changing of Gold for Silver, there is an Advance upon the Silver. Where there have been good and bad Currencies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the same Place; all the good, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as is Silver and Gold; if not

Merchandize, but upon a fixed Foundation as to Value and Period of Specification or Payment, they are <HI>hoarded up,</HI> because daily growing better as these Periods approach; as is the Case of our <HI>Merchant's Notes.</HI></P>
<P>We have no Reason to fear <HI>Want of a Medium,</HI> if the Grievance of publick Paper Credit were gradually re∣moved. Trade will find its own <HI>natural proper Medium,</HI> viz. <HI>Silver and Gold</HI>: They are imported here from Time to Time; when we have no other Cash, the Merchant must retain some of it to serve as Cash; Cash is a <HI>Mer∣chant's Tool</HI> or Instrument of Trade, by which he carries on his Trade and Business; and therefore will require no Laws, to hinder its Exportation.</P>
<P>Our Government of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> from the Inconveniencies, in their own Experience, and from the notorious bad Consequences of the like Practices in other Colonies; are now beginning to reform this Er∣ror of a <HI>vague Paper Currency,</HI> by reducing it to a certain <HI>Silver Standard</HI> and Fund. Upon this Occasion I beg Leave to observe; that in our Bills of the <HI>new Tenour,</HI> if <HI>Gold</HI> had been put at 5 <HI>l.</HI> (instead of 4 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.) per Oz.</HI> it would have been nearer at Par with Silver at 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d. per Oz.</HI>; and the Gold Penny-weight, being thus at 5 <HI>s,</HI> would have been without a Fraction, as is the Silver Pen∣ny-weight at 4 <HI>d.</HI> The <HI>Leeward Islands</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> have erred on the other Side, <HI>viz.</HI> Silver at 8 <HI>s. per Oz.,</HI> and a Pistole at 28 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>Some harsh sounding Words, are not designed as a <HI>Re∣flection</HI> upon this Country in general (the Country is not without its Merit, and their People in their natural <HI>Ge∣nius</HI> do excel) the Errors of all Countries in bad Admi∣nistrations, are to be imputed, to the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of Admi∣nistration, but not to the People in general.</P>
<P>There has lately appeared here in print a small Piece (<HI>Some Observations,</HI> &amp;c.) in Favour of a Paper Curren∣cy: But unluckily for the Author and his Cause, most of his Arguments, when cleared of unnatural Incumbrances, recoil upon himself, and they point out the many Incon∣veniencies which attend a large publick Paper Credit. As it seems designed for the Vulgar great and small; not∣withstanding, what I have already related, is a full An∣swer to the whole; I must by a closer Application, re∣tort his Arguments. I shall forbear any <HI>idle Criticism</HI> upon his Calculations, Figures, and <HI>technical</HI> commercial Words, as being out of the Question. Here I cannot but
<PB N="15" REF="004238_0016_10042a94f2d76180"/>
observe, that in all his spacious Calculations, he is obli∣ged to make Use of Silver at a certain Value, and recei∣vable at certain Periods, as a <HI>Basis</HI>; neglecting his dar∣ling Paper Currency's Uncertainties, as not qualified for a proper Foundation.</P>
<P>He introduces these Words, <HI>Ballance of Trade,</HI> upon all Occasions, with no true Meaning and Application.</P>
<P><HI>Ballance of Trade</HI> is Cash (Silver and Gold) impor∣ted to, or exported from a Country, according as the general Exports or Imports of Merchandize exceed one the other. The Silver and Gold which we send to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> are no Part of the Ballance of Trade against us, being truly, as Merchandize only. <HI>England</HI> sometimes exports <HI>Two Millions</HI> Sterling Value of Silver and Gold <HI>per Ann.</HI> to <HI>Holland, East Indies,</HI> &amp;c. by way of Merchan∣dize; the Ballance of Trade continuing in Favour of <HI>England</HI> notwithstanding. <HI>Ballance of Trade</HI> is also a∣gainst a Country, not only when they export their Me∣dium, but also when the Country runs in Debt, by ex∣pending in fine Houses, Apparel, <HI>&amp;c</HI> that which ought to have purchased Exports; this is our present Case.</P>
<P>The whole of his Book may be summ'd up in this Sentence, <HI>The sinking Value of our Bills is from and in Proportion to the Ballance of Trade being against us.</HI> Is it possible that a Country should continue to trade, or be capable of trading, when by the <HI>Ballance of Trade</HI> be∣ing against them, should meerly upon that Account in 25 Years Time, loose two Thirds of their Substance, as our Bills have lost above two Thirds of their Value. In any Country if the <HI>Ballance of Trade,</HI> is very much against them for a Series of Years; their Merchants na∣turally become Bankrupts, to the Damage of their fo∣reign Creditors; the Country looses its Credit, and is no more a Place of Trade. <HI>Paper Money cannot satisfy a Ballance of Trade,</HI> it is not exportable or to be negotiated abroad.</P>
<P>If we find that in all our Colonies where is no Paper Credit, that, the Value of their <HI>nummary Denominations,</HI> continues the same; and in all Colonies where Paper Currencies has prevailed, their Denominations have de∣preciated; Hand in Hand with their repeated Paper E∣missions, ought we to have Recourse to any other Con∣ceit (as Ballance of Trade) for its Cause, but only to the Operation of these Bills, would he not be reckoned <HI>a wrong Head,</HI> who should asign any other <HI>Regulator</HI> of

the <HI>Tides</HI> but the <HI>Moon,</HI> seeing at all Times and every where they vary <HI>pari passu, Barbados</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s had its Visici∣tudes of good and bad Crops; their Planters sometimes rich, sometimes much in Debt: But having no Paper Credit, their nummary Denominations are constantly of the same Value. <HI>Pensylvania</HI> (I mean the three upper Counties) has ever been in a progressive growing Con∣dition: Their nummary Denominations continue of the same fixed (<HI>Proclamation</HI> 6 <HI>s</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> half-penny <HI>per Oz</HI>) Value; until their Emissions and Re-emissions of Paper Money <HI>A.</HI> 1723, 1724, 1726, and 1729, raised Silver to 9 <HI>s. per Oz.,</HI> tho' at present their whole Paper Currency does not exceed 69,000 <HI>l. Maryland</HI> the last of our Co∣lonies, that has fallen into this Expedient of Debtors cheating their Creditors (a Debt of 100 Weight of <HI>To∣bacco,</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> Denomination before, is now paid by 10 <HI>s.</HI> Denomination of this Paper, which purchases only, and consequently is worth no more that 50 Weight of <HI>To∣bacco) A.</HI> 1734 they emitted 90 000 <HI>l.</HI> on a Silver, or <HI>Pro∣clamation</HI> Bottom; but the Emission being too large, and the Payments to the Possessors at too distant Periods (15, 30, <HI>and</HI> 45 <HI>Years</HI>) not being receivable in the Proprietors Quit-Rents, nor in Taxes, and being made a legal Tender; <HI>Exchange</HI> rose directly from 33 to 100 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Where the natural Causes of this Rise are so plain, is it reasona∣ble to introduce some <HI>chimaerical</HI> invisible Ballance of Trade, opperating so suddenly and so violently, while their Trade (Imports and Exports) in Appearance is still the same. In <HI>New-England,</HI> by unlucky incident, <HI>in the Fall</HI> A. 1733 <HI>Massachusetts Bay emitted</HI> 70,000 <HI>l. Rhode-Island</HI> 104 000 <HI>l., Connecticut</HI> 50,000 <HI>l.:</HI> The Ope∣ration of these Emissions was exactly the same; <HI>Exchange</HI> rose from 275 to 440 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Imports exceeding the Exports in Trade, is therefore not the true adequate Cause of the <HI>Minoration</HI> of the Value of our <HI>nummary Denominations.</HI> In <HI>South-Carolina</HI> where the Paper Cre∣dit is the lowest, 42 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per Oz</HI> Silver; their <HI>Rice</HI> and <HI>Deer-Skins</HI> or Exports are of much greater Value than their Imports, being now fully stockt with <HI>Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>He says, <HI>That Province Bills ought to be emitted from Time to Time, and postponed; until the Quantity exceeds the Demand.</HI> This is impracticable in the Nature of the Currency: By Experience we find, that the more Emis∣sions from Time to Time, the Value of these Bills is the less, and consequently the greater Quantity of them is re∣quired
<PB N="17" REF="004238_0018_10042a9f3ad25980"/>
(that is the Demand is the greater) to carry on the same Business. <HI>A</HI> 1713, when our Bills began to depreciate, there was current in all <HI>New England</HI> 194,000 <HI>l.</HI> in publick Bills of Bredit, at 8 <HI>s. per Oz.</HI> (the Value at that Time) is 485,000 <HI>Ounces</HI> Silver Value, besides a considerable concomitant Silver Currency: Our Paper Currency at present (Merchant's Notes not in∣cluded) is about 580,000 <HI>l.</HI> (triple the former) at 27 <HI>s. per Oz.</HI> Silver Value, is only 429,629 <HI>Oz.</HI> without any concomitant Silver Currency; so that our real Medium of Trade or Currency is considerably less at present, than it was <HI>A.</HI> 1713; notwithstanding the emitted large Sums, of this imaginary fallacious nominal Currency. This is the certain and constant Operation of a publick Paper Currency in large Quantities, over all our Colo∣nies; that is, when it exceeds a certain Proportion; the more that is emitted the more it depreciates, and by continued multiplied Emissions, at length, <HI>Province Bills may become in Value equal to Waste Paper.</HI></P>
<P>He says, <HI>A</HI> 20 <HI>s. Bill is the natural Pound of New-England.</HI> This ought to be understood no otherways, than as a <HI>Banter</HI> upon our publick Bills, because they are continually fluctuating; and may be compared to the Inscription, <HI>semper eadem</HI> upon a Vane in <HI>Camb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dige,</HI> in the Time of the Administration latter End of Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s Reign. Or in a more familiar Comparison, of the Loads of Hay brought to <HI>Boston,</HI> which originally were design'd and understood to be 20 <HI>Hund. Wt.</HI> or a Tun, at present if a Country Man's Load is reduced to a Standard Weight, and found to be only 12 <HI>Hund. Wt.</HI>; would it satisfy the Buyer of this Load or Tun of Hay, the Country Man's saying, it is all right, this is my natural Tun or Load: This is what our Author in another Place says, that every Man may have his own natural Pound: Which cannot possibly be, until Society is dissolved.</P>
<P>'<HI>Silver falling in infinitum, and Bills growing better in infinitum</HI>' This is a <HI>Delirium,</HI> without any Connec∣tion or Meaning; as are sundry other Passages in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Book, which I do not understand, and therefore cannot presume to explain.</P>
<P>'<HI>The Ballance of Debt against us, will fall our Bills ad infinitum.</HI>' I suppose he means not below the Value of Waste Paper. Where is then the Value of these Bills? Is it not a <HI>Burlesque</HI> upon us, to call a 20 <HI>Shilling Bill</HI> not fix'd, but left free to its Course in the Marker, and
<PB N="18" REF="004238_0019_10042aa31e8dee10"/>
at length become equal to Nothing; <HI>New England</HI>'s <HI>na∣tural Pound Value</HI>? Are those natural Pounds in any Country, which in the Space of 25 Years have fluctuated or rather sunk from 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Exchange to 400 <HI>per Cent,</HI> and may still sink <HI>in infinitum</HI>?</P>
<P>What he calls <HI>Buying with our Bills Silver at a Mar∣ket Price</HI>; is, in a mercantile Phrase, discounting our Bills at a Market Price, with Silver, which is the fixed universal commercial <HI>Medium</HI>; thus he endeavours to per∣swade us, that our Bills are of a fixed Value, and that Silver fluctuates; after this same Manner, as if aboard of a coasting Vessel under Sail or fluctuating, he should endeavour to perswade Passengers, that the <HI>Ship</HI> stands still, and the Land fluctuates or alters: He might per∣haps from Appearances perswade one who had not the right Use of his Reason. To say this Bill shall be in Value equal to Money without fixing any standard Va∣lue, is only saying, <HI>Valeat quantum valera potest. Qui vult decipi, decipiatur</HI></P>
<P>Of the same Nature is his Assertion, That <HI>when Goods rise or fall in our Market, the Change must be in our Goods, but not in Paper Credit.</HI> Whereas in Fact Goods and Produce in this Place, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> have nearly re∣tain'd the same Price (or rather of late are cheaper) for many Years, with Regard to Silver the universal com∣mercial Medium: That is, the same Quantity of Silver will buy the same Quantity of Cloth, Woollens and Lin∣nens of any particular Sort, and build the same Tunnage of Vessels (when Silver was at 8 <HI>s. per Oz</HI> Ships from 200 to 300 Tun to the Builder, cost about 4 <HI>l per Tun,</HI> and 10 <HI>s.</HI> for Extras as was the Custom at that Time; at present 15 <HI>l. per Tun,</HI> Extras included.) <HI>Labour</HI> is rather cheaper, a Ship-Carpenter when Silver was 8 <HI>s.,</HI> had 5 <HI>s.</HI> a Day, or 5 8ths of an <HI>Oz</HI>; at present he has only 12 <HI>s.</HI> a Day, which is not Half an <HI>Oz.</HI> at 27 <HI>s. per Oz</HI></P>
<P>The Author is a Stranger to the Affairs of <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> He compares the continued great Falls of our Province Bills from 50 to 400 <HI>per Cent.</HI> (I suppose he means the <HI>Bubles A</HI> 1720) to the Changes in the <HI>Stocks</HI> negotiated there, which is only a small Fluctuation, pro∣ceeding not from Ballance of Trade, or Variations in nummary Denominations, or Addition of more Stock on the same Fund; but from some <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck jabbing</HI> little Arts or Tricks. He is not acquainted with the Nature of <HI>East-India Bonds</HI>: He says they are not fit for a Market, be∣cause
<PB N="19" REF="004238_0020_10042aa95e33f6d0"/>
they promise Money only at a distant Time, and a supposed Interest of 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Whereas the Possessor or <HI>Bond-Holder</HI> may demand at Pleasure (or be allowed in any of their Sales as ready Money) but the <HI>East-In∣dia Company</HI> cannot oblige the Bond-Holder to quit (have it discharged) his Bond, but at half Years Notice. Hence it is, that they bear an Interest lower than the common Interest (3 or 3 and an Half <HI>per Cent.</HI>) and sell for a <HI>Premium</HI>; because they are as Cash bearing Interest, which Silver Cash does not.</P>
<P>'<HI>Paper Money not being emitted in Quantities, is the Reason why the natural Interest amongst us rises.</HI>' This unnatural <HI>Medium</HI> in Quantities, has a quite different Ope∣ration; from that of the natural <HI>Medium</HI> Silver in Plenty, which effectually lowers the Interest of Money. The Quantity of Paper Credit sinks the Value of the Princi∣pal, and the Lender to save himself, is obliged to lay the growing Loss of the Principal, upon the Interest. <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> who have much exceeded us in their Emissions, have for some Time rose their Rate of Interest to 10 or 12 <HI>per Cent</HI> and give this very Reason for so doing.</P>
<P>'<HI>No Man can say, but that his Money will now bring him in, as much Interest as ever.</HI>' The Matter of Fact is, 100 <HI>l.</HI> in Province Bills 25 Years ago, brought in 15 <HI>Oz.</HI> of Silver <HI>per Ann.</HI>; the same 100<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>l,</HI> at present does not bring in 5 <HI>Oz,</HI> is 5 equal to 15, or 1 to 3.</P>
<P>His <HI>tacit Consent of the Multitude to the Schemes of Pa∣per Money</HI>; is a weak Argument in its Favour. I re∣member some Years ago, when we had got into the Hu∣mour of <HI>Lotteries:</HI> Notwithstanding the Discount upon the benefit Tickets for Charges, and other great Frauds (<HI>v. g.</HI> in one of the First of these <HI>Lotteries,</HI> a House was set at 1600 <HI>l,</HI> the Proprietors of this benefit Ticket, after this House had been upon Sale many Months, could get no more than 100<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (for it, which is a Discount of 37 <HI>per Cent.</HI>) yet without Imputation of <HI>Knavery</HI> on the one Side, or <HI>Folly</HI> on the other; People did continue in sub∣sequent <HI>Lotteries</HI> to sink their Substance, and would have continued longer in the same Manner; if the Wisdom of our <HI>Legislature</HI> had not put a Stop to it.</P>
<P>He alledges that <HI>long Credit (our great Grievance) is from the Scarcity of Paper Money.</HI> No. It is from too great Imports, encouraged by large Emissions. The Mer∣chant or Factor cannot dispose of so much, at a reasonable ready-money Price, and therefore, that their Goods may
<PB N="20" REF="004238_0021_10042aaf2c3d7080"/>
not lay long upon Hand, are obliged to give a long Credit.</P>
<P>I canot avoid, by way of Digression, to make some Re∣marks on <HI>long Credit.</HI> It makes the Unthinking buy profusely. Whereas ready Money, or a short Credit, would not allow a Man to buy and spend more, than his present Earning could afford, consequently he would live frugally, and keep clear of Debt: Foreign Com∣modities would not be imported in such Quantities, be∣cause they could not be consumed faster than our Earn∣ings (our Returns) would admit of; and would answer the Intention of <HI>sumptuary Laws,</HI> which our stated De∣pendance on a trading Mother Country cannot allow of. Ready Money or a short Credit, makes a quick Circula∣tion; the quicker the Circulation, the less Quantity of a Currency or <HI>Medium</HI> is required to carry on any Trade and Business. This would be an effectual Method, and equivalent to enlarging our Currency.</P>
<P>He alledges also, that <HI>Shop Notes (another great Grie∣vance) were introduced from the Scarcity of Paper Curren∣cy.</HI> This is ill judged. Because the <HI>Merchant</HI> to pro∣cure a greater Advantage upon his Goods, than if sold for Cash; contracted with the <HI>Shop-keeper,</HI> to take it out in his Way by <HI>Tradesmen's Notes</HI>: The Shop-keeper by imposing upon the Tradesmen and Labourers, Possessors of these Notes, found their Profit in it; this made the Shop keepers chuse to buy, to be drawn out in Notes. The Factor also found his Advantage in it, by dazling his Employer with a large Account of Sales, &amp; by encreasing his Commissions. This is become an <HI>Iniquity</HI> as it were by compact.</P>
<P>He encourages the <HI>Rhode Islanders</HI> to more Emissions of Bills, '<HI>And they will find their Account in it, if they go on to emit a sufficient Quantity of Bills.</HI>' He advises this Province to follow their Example, <HI>in emitting a great Quantity before it be too late.</HI> He does not consider that if this Province were to emit a Quantity of Bills in pro∣portion to what <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> have emitted, (<HI>Massachu∣sets Bay</HI> Colony being to that of <HI>Rhode Island</HI> nearly as 6 is to 1) they would be so depreciated by their Quan∣tity, as not to answer the End of a Currency, and oblige us to a <HI>Truck Trade</HI>; as in <HI>North Carolina,</HI> where their Truck call'd Specie, passes at a great Advance above their Province Bills; and in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> by reason of their large Emissions, all considerable Contracts are made
<PB N="21" REF="004238_0022_10042ab54bad9408"/>
in their Produce Rice, not in Bills. A Man of a landed Estate perswades some Merchants his Neighbours and and Friends to accept his Notes for Goods and other Necessaries payable after 10 or 20 Years, and to circulate them all that Time without any <HI>Premium</HI>: And this Man a trading with these Goods to his own private Profit. It is scarce credible that there could be such <HI>Infatuation</HI> on the one Side, and such <HI>bare fac'd Impo∣sition</HI> on the Other. This is the very Case between this Province and <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI> It is in vain to think, that we may follow their Example; it is impracticable so to multiply Bills to our Advantage, unless we could per∣swade (it is <HI>Folly</HI> to imagine it) all our Continent Plan∣tations, to circulate them; <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> bears no greater a Proportion to this Province, than this Province does to all our other Colonies upon this Continent.</P>
<P>He is an inexorable Enemy to Silver, for the following Reasons, as he says.</P>
<P><HI>Silver has been and may be greatly depreciated by the Excess of its Quantity.</HI> Silver is of so universal Demand all over the World; that the continued Additions to it is like throwing of Water into the Ocean, making no sensible Alteration: But a continued Emission of any pe∣culiar provincial Paper Money, above a certain Sum, is like continued Pourings of Liquor into a Cask, which is soon full, runs over, and the Additions are lost. In Fact, the computative or <HI>nummary Denominations,</HI> instead of containing more Silver, as it might be imagined from its Excess, do contain considerably less, <HI>v. g</HI> in <HI>England</HI> instead of 12 <HI>Oz to a Pound Sterling,</HI> as it was when Sil∣ver was scarce, it is at present only 4 <HI>Oz</HI> when Silver a∣bounds: But, as we have already proved, this proceeds from none of the Qualities of Silver; it is meerly from the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of civil Administrations. The Silver Mines of <HI>Potsio</HI> are said to have been first discovered <HI>A.</HI> 1545, the nummary Denominations, as to Quantity of Silver, varied much before that Time, and since <HI>Anno</HI> 1552 (prior to this our Import of Silver was inconsiderable) in <HI>England</HI> they have altered or varied only Two, in Eighty Eight.</P>
<P><HI>Bills are a Commodity, not as a Pledge given but as Value paid, and therefore preferable to Silver.</HI> Is it not more natural to say, Silver is as a certain Value paid, as a Pledge, and as Returns or Merchandize; therefore it is prefera∣ble to publick Bills, which are only as a precarious Va∣lue
<PB N="22" REF="004238_0023_10042abac479a910"/>
paid, but no Pledge, and no Returns or Merchan∣dize.</P>
<P><HI>Bills are less bulky and more handy than Silver.</HI> Is a Shop-keeper's (whose Notes are already at a great Dis∣count) promisary Note of Hand, better than a Bag of Silver.</P>
<P><HI>Notes on a fixed real Fund, are worse than Notes that have no such Fund</HI>; because the former cannot grow bet∣ter beyond that fixed Standard: But the others being bad, may grow better <HI>in infinitum.</HI> This is ludicrous. I can answer only by a like Story: A certain <HI>Quack</HI> in the Cure of a sick Person, being told that by his Ma∣nagement, the Patient did grow worse and worse: So much the better, answered the Quack, because when Things are come to the worst, then they will mend. The Truth of the Case is, the first can be no worse, than the just Discount for the Distance of the Time of Pay∣ment; but the Others may grow worse and worse, <HI>in infinitum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If we make Bills promising Silver or any Thing of a cer∣tain Value, it will occasion their being hoarded up.</HI> It will be so, where there are also current Bills, promising a precarious or no Value; because such will be hoarded up by no Body, but be gladly parted with, even at a Discount, and Discount upon Discount, until we discount near the whole, that is until they are of no further Cur∣rency or Value: Accordingly in this Province, we are now arrived to a <HI>Discount of more than two Thirds</HI> of what these Bills were first emitted for. That a Bill without Limitation of Value or Period, and continually growing worse, should be preferable to a Bill with the Advan∣tage of Period, and Value certain, and yearly meliorating, as are Bills on a fixed Silver Bottom; is a <HI>strange Para∣dox.</HI> Some keep up the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bills and pass away the <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Bills; are the <HI>Rhode Island</HI> Bills there∣fore better than the <HI>Massachusetts</HI>? Amongst our pre∣sent publick Bills, what are tore and defac'd, or suspect∣ted, are passed away first; are they therefore a better Currency, than a good fair Bill?</P>
<P><HI>There ought to be no Silver Fund for Bills, because it will rise the Price of Silver, to make good this Fund.</HI> That is, all our Banks in <HI>Europe</HI> are ill founded, both Pub∣lick and Private; because they are all upon a Silver Bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004238_0024_10042ac52bad36a0"/><HI>To pay Contracts according to a fixed Weight of Silver; would have an unavoidable Tendency to raise the Price of it.</HI> It does not happen so in <HI>Europe,</HI> where Silver is their only legal Tender. In <HI>New England,</HI> paying of Contracts in Province Bills, does not rise the Price of them.</P>
<P><HI>Our Bills are better than Silver, because they are by our Acts of Assembly a Tender, and consequently must pass: Silver passes only by Consent, which may be withdrawn.</HI> That is, a forced provincial Tender, passable no where else, is better than a natural, universal, and legal (<HI>Pro∣clamation Act</HI>) Tender, from which no trading Consent ever was or will be withdrawn: And 27<HI>s.</HI> in Bills the present Value of One <HI>Ounce</HI> of Silver, is better than 27 <HI>s.</HI> which was the Value of Three <HI>Ounces and an Half</HI> Silver Twenty Five Years ago; or in plain Words, One is more than Three.</P>
<P>The following Clauses in his Book I cannot under∣stand, <HI>viz. Province Bills may be fixed to an assigned In∣terest, and so be made a just Measure or Standard of the Va∣lue of all Things bought or sold, which Silver cannot be. —When Silver falls the Government may stop it at any fixed Rate, and make that the Silver Pound or legal Tender. Why not also when Silver rises if it were practicable. —Lowering the Price of Silver in</HI> England, <HI>where the nummary Denomination continues of the same Weight in our Coin,</HI> it is a Contradiction in itself. — <HI>By Means of a Paper Currency, to introduce Silver to pass current.</HI></P>
<P>He concludes thus. That he might now shew, how the Bills of the old Tenour, might be qualified, for the true Ends and Uses thereof; and the like of private Notes of the same Nature, but having exceeded the Bounds of a Letter, he must forbear. <HI>Cui bono</HI> is the whole, since he concludes without entring upon the main and only Affair?</P>
<P>Most <HI>political</HI> Affairs have some Resemblance, to na∣tural <HI>oscillatory</HI> Motions, when got to their Extent on the one Side; they must return gradually and in the same Path to the other Side. Large Emissions of a bad Currency, long Credit, Insensibility of Discredit, Idle∣ness, Extravigance, and Intemprance, have carried us to the Extent of bad Circumstances: We must return by
<PB N="23" REF="004238_0025_10042ac8b5a07078"/>
gradually cancelling our bad Medium, by shortning our Credit, by being more upon the Punctos of Honour and Honesty, by being more industrious, by being more Fru∣gal, and by abandoning the plentiful Use of <HI>Rum,</HI> that execrable Bane of all our Plantations, and perniciously recommended by some of our Practitioners in <HI>Physick,</HI> as more wholesome than Wine.</P>
