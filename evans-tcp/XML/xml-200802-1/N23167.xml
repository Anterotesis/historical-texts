<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time when the nobility of Britain were said, by the Poet Laureat, to admire and protect the arts, and were known by the whole nation to be the patrons of music,—William and Henry, youths under twenty years of age, brothers, and the sons of a country shopkeeper who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d lately died insolvent, set out on foot for London, in the hope of procuring by their industry a scanty subsistence.</P>
<P>As they walked out of their native town, each with a small bundle at his back, each ob∣served the other drop several tears; but, upon the sudden meeting of their eyes, they both smil∣ed with a degree of disdain at the weakness in which they had been caught.</P>
<P>"I am sure," said William (the elder) "I don't know why I cry."</P>
<P>"Nor I neither," said Henry: "for though
<PB N="4" REF="030623_0004_0FE7ED561C5CAE60"/>
we may never see this town again, yet we leave nothing behind us to give us cause to lament,"</P>
<P>"No," replied William; "nor any body who cares what becomes of us."</P>
<P>"But I was thinking," said Henry, now weeping bitterly, "that if my poor father were alive, <HI>be</HI> would care what was to become of us:—he would not have suffered us to begin this long journey without a few shillings more in our pockets."</P>
<P>At the end of this sentence, William, who had with some effort suppressed his tears while his brother spoke, now uttered, with a voice al∣most inarticulate,—"Don't say any more; don't talk any more about it. My father used to tell us, that when he was gone we must take care of ourselves: and so we must. I only wish," continued he, giving way to his grief, "that I had never done any thing to offend him while he was living."</P>
<P>"That is what I wish too," cried Henry. "If I had always been dutiful to him while he was alive, I would not shed one tear for him now that he is gone: but I would thank heaven that he had escaped from his creditors."</P>
<P>In conversation such as this, wherein their sorrow for their deceased parent seemed less for his death, than because he had not been so happy
<PB N="5" REF="030623_0005_0FE7ED57B7C99208"/>
when living, as they ought to have made him; and wherein their own outcast fortune was less the subject of their grief, than the reflection "what their father would have endured, could he have beheld them in their present situation;" in conversation such as this, they pursued their journey till they arrived at that metropolis, which has received for centuries past, from the provincial towns, the bold adventurer of every denomination; has stampt his character with experience and example; and, while it has be∣stowed on some coronets and mitres <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some the lasting fame of genius—to other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dealt beggary, infamy, and untimely death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a trial of three weeks passed in London, a year followed, during which, Wil∣liam and Henry never sat down to a dinner, or went into a bed, without hearts glowing with thankfulness to that Providence which had be∣stowed on them such unexpected blessings; for no longer did they presume to expect (what still they presumed they deserved) a secure pit∣tance for themselves in this world of plenty.
<PB N="6" REF="030623_0006_0FE83B34B7FE1758"/>
Their experience, since they came to town, had informed them that, to obtain a permanent live∣lihood, is the good fortune but a part of those who are in want of it: and the precarious earn∣ing of half a crown, or a shilling, in the neigh∣bourhood where they lodged, by an errand, or some such accidental means, was the sole sup∣port which they at present enjoyed.</P>
<P>They had sought for constant employment of various kinds, and even for servants' places; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>acles had always occurred to prevent their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. If they applied for the situation of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a man of extensive concerns, their qualifications were admitted; but there must be security given for their fidelity:—they had friends, who would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem a character, but who would give them nothing else.</P>
<P>If they endeavoured for the place even of a menial servant, they were too clownish and awkward for the presence of the lady of the house;—and once, when William (who had been educated at the free grammar-school of the town in which he was born, and was an excel∣lent scholar) hoping to obtain the good opinion of a young clergyman whom he solicited for the favour of waiting upon him, acquainted him, "That he understood Greek and Latin," he
<PB N="7" REF="030623_0007_0FE83B3B4E8BCCF8"/>
was rejected by the divine, "because he could not dress hair."</P>
<P>Weary of repeating their mean accomplish∣ments of "honesty, sobriety, humility," and on the precipice of reprobating such qualities,—which, however beneficial to the soul, gave no hope of preservation to the body,—they were prevented from this profanation by the fortu∣nate remembrance of one qualification; which Henry, the possessor; in all his distress, had ne∣ver, till then, called to his recollection: but which, being once remembered and made known, changed the whole prospect of wretch∣edness placed before the two brothers; and they never knew want more.</P>
<P>Reader, not to keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in suspense concern∣ing this attribute—Henry c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld play upon the fiddle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<P>NO sooner was it publicly known that Hen∣ry could play most excellently upon the violin, than he was invited into many companies where no other accomplishment could have introduced him. His performance was so much admired,
<PB N="8" REF="030623_0008_0FE83B3CF1673780"/>
that he had the honour of being admitted to se∣veral tavern feasts, of which he had also the ho∣nour to partake without partaking of the ex∣pence. He was soon addressed by persons of the very first rank and fashion, and was once seen walking side by side with a peer.</P>
<P>But yet, in the midst of this powerful occasion for rejoicing, Henry, whose heart was particu∣larly affectionate, had one grief that eclipsed all the happiness of his new life:—his brother Wil∣liam could <HI>not</HI> play on the fiddle!—consequent∣ly, his brother William, with whom he had shared so much ill, could not share in his good fortune.</P>
<P>One evening, Henry, coming home from a dinner and concert at the Crown and Anchor, found William, in a very gloomy and peevish humour, poring over <HI>De Oratore</HI> of Cicero. Henry asked him several times "How he did;" and similar questions, marks of his kind dispo∣sition towards his beloved brother: but all the endeavours, he perceived, could not soothe or soften the sullen mind of William. At length, taking from his pocket a handful of almonds, and some delicious fruit (which he had purloin∣ed from the plenteous table, where his brother's wants had never been absent from his thoughts)
<PB N="9" REF="030623_0009_0FE83B454DCBC8B8"/>
and laying them down before him, he exclaimed with a benevolent smile, "Do, William, let me teach you to play upon the violin."</P>
<P>William—full of the great orator whom he was then studying, and still more alive to the impossibility that <HI>his</HI> ear, attuned only to sense, could ever descend from that elevation, to learn mere sounds—William caught up the tempting presents which Henry had ventured his reputa∣tion to obtain for him, and threw them all indig∣nantly at the donor's head.</P>
<P>Henry felt too powerfully his own superiority of fortune, to resent this ingratitude; he only picked up the repast, and laying it again upon the table, placed by its side a bottle of claret, which he held fast by the neck, while he assur∣ed his brother, that, "although he had taken it while the waiter's back was turned, yet it might be drank with a safe conscience by them; for he had not himself tasted one drop at the feast, on purpose that he might enjoy a glass with his brother at home, and without wronging the company who had invited him."</P>
<P>The affection Henry expressed as he said this,—or the force of a bumper of wine, which Wil∣liam had not seen since he left his father's house,—had such an effect in calming the displeasure
<PB N="10" REF="030623_0010_0FE83B46D4E2E4B0"/>
he was cherishing, that, on his brother's offer∣ing him the glass, he took it; and he deigned even to eat of his present.</P>
<P>Henry, to convince him that he had stinted himself, to obtain for him this collation, sat down and partook of it.</P>
<P>After a few glasses had passed, he again ven∣tured to say, "Do, brother William, let me teach you to play on the violin."</P>
<P>Again his offer was refused; but though with less vehemence, at length they both agreed the attempt could not prosper.</P>
<P>"Then," said Henry, "William, go down to Oxford, or to Cambridge. There, no doubt, they are as fond of learning, as in this gay town they are of music. You know you have as much talent for the one as I for the other: do go to one of our universities, and see what din∣ners, what suppers, and what friends <HI>you</HI> will find there."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>WILLLIAM <HI>did</HI> go to one of those seats of learning, and would have starved there, but
<PB N="11" REF="030623_0011_0FE83B4B6197DA80"/>
for the affectionate remittances of Henry, who shortly became so great a proficient in the art of music, as to have it in his power not only to live in a very reputable manner himself, but to send such supplies to his brother, as to enable him to pursue his studies.</P>
<P>With some, the progress of fortune is rapid. Such is the case when, either on merit or deme∣rit, great patronage is bestowed. Henry's vio∣lin had often charmed, to a welcome forgetful∣ness of his insignificance, an effeminate lord; or warmed with ideas of honour, the head of a duke, whose heart could never be taught to feel its manly glow. Princes had flown to the arms of their favourite fair-ones, with more rap∣turous delight, softened by the masterly touches of his art: and those elevated personages, ever grateful to those from whom they derive bene∣fits, were competitors in the desire of heaping favours upon him. But he, in all his advan∣tages, never once lost from his thoughts the hope of some advantage for his brother William: and when at any time he was pressed by a patron to demand a "token of his regard," he would constantly reply:</P>
<P>"I have a brother, a very learned man, if your lordship (your grace, or your royal high∣ness) would confer some small favour on him—"</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="030623_0012_0FE83B4F47DC2178"/>
His lordship would reply, "He was so teaz∣ed and harrassed in his youth by learned men, that he had ever since detested the whole frater∣nity."</P>
<P>His grace would inquire "If the learned man could play upon any instrument."</P>
<P>And his highness would ask "If he could sing."</P>
<P>Rebuffs such as these poor Henry met with in all his applications for William, till one for∣tunate evening, at the conclusion of a concert, a great man shook him by the hand, and pro∣mised a living of five hundred a year (the in∣cumbent of which was upon his death-bed) to his brother, in return for the entertainment Henry had just given him.</P>
<P>Henry wrote in haste to William, and began his letter thus: "My dear brother, I am not sorry you did not learn to play upon the fid∣dle."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE incumbent of this living died—Wil∣liam was ordained: and in a few weeks came to town, to take possession of the gift, which his brother's skill had acquired him.</P>
<P>William had a steady countenance, a stern
<PB N="13" REF="030623_0013_0FE83B5644E65178"/>
brow, and a majestic walk; all of which this new accession, this holy calling to religious vows, rather increased than diminished. In the early part of his life, the violin of his brother had rather irritated than soothed the morose dis∣position of his nature: and though, since their departure from their native habitation, it had frequently calmed the violent ragings of his hunger, it had never been successful in appeas∣ing the disturbed passions of a proud and a dis∣dainful mind.</P>
<P>As the painter views with delight and won∣der the finished picture, expressive testimony of his taste and genius: as the physician beholds with pride and gladness the recovering invalid, whom his art has snatched from the jaws of death: as the father gazes with rapture on his first child, the creature to whom he has given life—so did Henry survey with transporting glory, his brother, drest for the first time in his canonicals, to preach at his parish church. He viewed him from head to foot—smiled—viewed again—pulled one side of his gown a little this way, one end of his band a little that way—then stole behind him, pretending to place the curls of his hair, but in reality, to indulge, and to conceal, tears of fraternal pride and joy.</P>
<P>William was not without joy: neither was
<PB N="14" REF="030623_0014_0FE83B57CB07EDC8"/>
he wanting in love or gratitude to his brother—but his pride was not completely satisfied.</P>
<P>"I am eldest brother," he thought to himself, "and a man of literature; and yet am I obliged to my younger, an illiterate man."—Here he suppressed every thought that could be a re∣proach to that brother. But there remained an object of his former contempt, now become even detestable to him—ungrateful man! the very agent of his elevation was now so odious to him, that he could not cast his eyes upon the friendly violin, without instant emotions of dis∣gust.</P>
<P>In vain would Henry at times endeavour to subdue his haughtiness, by a tune on this won∣derful machine.—"You know I have no ear," William would sternly say, in recompense for one of Henry's best solo's. Yet was William enraged at Henry's answer, when, after taking him to hear him preach, he asked him "how he liked his sermon," and Henry replied (merely with pleasantry, and in the technical phrase of his profession) "You know, brother, I have no ear."</P>
<P>Henry's renown in his profession daily in∣creased; and with his same, his friends. Pos∣sessing the virtues of humility and charity, far above William, the profest teacher of those vir∣tues,
<PB N="15" REF="030623_0015_0FE83B5EB21BD1E0"/>
his reverend brother's disrespect for his vo∣cation, never once made him relax for a moment in his anxiety to advance him in <HI>his.</HI>—Within a year or two, he had the gratification of present∣ing him to a deanery; and at once placed be∣tween them an insurmountable barrier to all friendship, that was not the effect of condescen∣sion, on the part of the dean.</P>
<P>William would now begin seriously to re∣monstrate with his brother "upon his useless occupation," and would intimate "the degra∣dation it was to him, to hear his frivolous ta∣lent spoken of in all companies." Henry be∣lieved his brother much wiser than himself, and suffered shame that he was not more worthy of such a relation. To console himself for the fa∣miliar friend, whom he now perceived he had entirely lost, he searched for one of a softer na∣ture—he married.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>AS Henry despaired of receiving his bro∣ther's approbation of his choice, he never men∣tioned the event to him: but William, being told of it by a third person, inquired of Henry, who confirmed the truth of the intelligence, and
<PB N="16" REF="030623_0016_0FE83B6037F01950"/>
acknowledged, that, in taking a wife, his sole view had been, to obtain a kind companion and friend, who would bear with his failings, and know how to esteem his few qualifications; therefore, he had chosen one of his own rank in life, and who, having a taste for music, and, as well as himself, an obligation to the art—</P>
<P>"And is it possible," cried the dean, "that what has been hinted to me is true? Is it possi∣ble that you have married a public singer?"</P>
<P>"She is as good as myself," returned Henry: "I did not wish her to be better, for fear she should despise me."</P>
<P>"As to despise," (answered the dean) "hea∣ven forbid that we should despise any one—that would be acting unlike a christian—but do you imagine I can ever introduce her to my intend∣ed wife, who is a woman of family?"</P>
<P>Henry had received in his life many insults from his brother: but, as he was not a vain man, he generally thought his brother in the right, and consequently submitted with patience—but, though he had little self-love, he had for his wife an unbounded affection: on the present occasion, therefore, he began to raise his voice, and even (in the coarse expression of clownish anger) to lift his hand—but the sudden and af∣fecting recollection of what he had done for the
<PB N="17" REF="030623_0017_0FE83B69DE575D50"/>
dean—of the pains, the toils, the hopes, and the fears he had experienced when soliciting his pre∣ferment—this recollection overpowered his speech—weakened his arm—and deprived him of every active force, but that of flying out of the dean's house (in which they then were) as swift as lightning, while the dean sat proudly contemplating—"that he had done his duty."</P>
<P>For several days Henry did not call, as was his custom, to see his brother: William's mar∣riage drew near, and he sent a formal card to in∣vite him on that day; but not having had the condescension to name his sister-in-law in the invitation, Henry took no notice of it; and the joyful event was celebrated without his pre∣sence. But the ardour of the bridegroom was not so vehement as to overcome every other sensation—he missed his brother—that heart∣felt cheerfulness with which Henry had ever given him joy upon every happy occasion—even amidst all the politer congratulations of his other friends—seemed to the dean mournful∣ly wanting. This derogation from his felicity he was resolved to resent—and for a whole year these brothers, whom adversity had entwined closely together, prosperity separated.</P>
<P>Though Henry, on his marriage, paid so
<PB N="18" REF="030623_0018_0FE83B6B655023A8"/>
much attention to his brother's prejudices, as to take his wife from her public employment, this had not so entirely removed the scruples of William, as to permit him to think her a wor∣thy companion for Lady Clementina, the daugh∣ter of a poor Scotch earl, whom he had chosen, merely that he might be proud of her family; though, in return, he should suffer that family to be ashamed of <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>If Henry's wife was not fit company for La∣dy Clementina, it is to be hoped she was com∣pany for angels—she died within the first year of her marriage, a faithful, an affectionate wife and a mother.</P>
<P>When William heard of her death, he felt a sudden shock—and a kind of fleeting thought glanced across his mind, that</P>
<P>"Had he known she had been so near her dis∣solution, she might have been introduced to Lady Clementina: and he himself would have called her sister."</P>
<P>That is (if he had defined his fleeting idea) "they would have had no objection to have met this poor woman for the <HI>last time;</HI> and would have descended to the familiarity of kin∣dred, in order to have wished her a good journey to the other world."</P>
<P>Or, is there in death something that so raises
<PB N="19" REF="030623_0019_0FE83B72593D8C40"/>
the abjectness of the poor, that, on their ap∣proach to its sheltering abode, the arrogant believer feels the equality he had before denied, and trembles?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE wife of Henry had been dead near six weeks before the dean heard the news: a month then elapsed in thoughts by himself, and consul∣tations with Lady Clementina, how he should conduct himself, on this occurrence. Her ad∣vice was,</P>
<P>"That as Henry was the youngest, and by their stations, in every sense, the dean's inferior, he ought first to make overtures of reconcilia∣tion."</P>
<P>The dean answered, "He had no doubt of his brother's good will to him: but that he had rea∣son to think, from the knowledge of his temper, he would be more likely to come to him upon an occasion to bestow comfort, than to receive it: for instance, if I had suffered the misfortune of losing you, my brother, I have no doubt, would have forgotten his resentment, and—"</P>
<P>She was offended that the loss of the vulgar wife of Henry should be compared to the loss of her—she lamented her indiscretion in forming
<PB N="20" REF="030623_0020_0FE83B73DD594288"/>
an alliance with a family of no rank, and im∣plored the dean to wait till his brother should make some concession to him, before he renewed the acquaintance.</P>
<P>Though Lady Clementina had mentioned on this occasion her <HI>indiscretion,</HI> she was of a pru∣dent age—she was near forty—yet, possessing rather a handsome face and person, she would not have impressed the spectator with an idea that she was near so old, had she not constantly at∣tempted to appear much younger. Her dress was fantastically fashionable, her manners af∣fected all the various passions of youth, and her conversation was perpetually embellished with accusations upon her own "heedlessness, thoughtlessness, carelessness, and childishness."</P>
<P>There is perhaps, in every individual, one parent motive to every action, good or bad: be that as it will, it was evident, that with Lady Clementina, all she said or did, all she thought or looked, had but one foundation—vanity.—If she was nice, or if she was negligent, vanity was the cause of both; for she would contem∣plate with the highest degree of self-compla∣cency "what such a one would say of her ele∣gant preciseness, or what such a one would think of her interesting neglect."</P>
<P>If she complained she was ill, it was with
<PB N="21" REF="030623_0021_0FE83B7A4AF874D8"/>
the certainty that her languor would be admi∣red; if she boasted she was well, it was that the spectator might admire her glowing health; if she laughed, it was because she thought it made her look pretty; if she cried, it was be∣cause she thought it made her look prettier still. If she scolded her servants, it was from vanity, to show her superior knowledge to theirs; and she was kind to them, from the same vice, that her benevolence might excite their admiration. Forward and impertinent in the company of her equals, from the vanity of supposing herself above them, she was bashful even to shamefa∣cedness in the presence of her superiors, because her vanity told her she engrossed all their obser∣vation. Through vanity she had no memory; for she constantly forgot every thing she heard others say, from the minute attention which she paid to every thing she said herself.</P>
<P>She had become an old maid from vanity, believing no offer she received worthy of her deserts; and when her power of farther conquest began to be doubted, she married from vanity to repair the character of her fading charms. In a word, her vanity was of that magnitude, that she had no idea but that she was humble in her own opinion; and it would have been impossi∣ble to have convinced her that she thought well
<PB N="22" REF="030623_0022_0FE83B7BD1D39D28"/>
of herself, because she thought <HI>so well,</HI> as to be assured, that her own thoughts under valued her.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THAT, which in a weak woman is called vanity, in a man of sense is termed pride—make one a degree stronger, or the other a degree weaker, and the dean and his wife were infected with the self-same folly. Yet, do not let the reader suppose that this failing (however des∣picable) had erased from either bosom all traces of humanity. They are human creatures who are meant to be pourtrayed in this little book, and where is the human creature who has not some good qualities to soften, if not counter∣balance his bad ones?</P>
<P>The dean, with all his pride, could not wholly forget his brother, nor eradicate from his remem∣brance the friend he had been to him—he re∣solved therefore, in spite of his wife's advice, to make him some overture, which he had no doubt but Henry's good nature would instantly accept. The more he became acquainted with all the vain and selfish propensities of Lady Cle∣mentina, the more he felt a returning affection for his brother: but little did he suspect how
<PB N="23" REF="030623_0023_0FE83B82AD629F30"/>
much he loved him, till (after sending to va∣rious places to enquire for him) he learnt—that on his wife's decease, unable to support her loss in the surrounding scene, Henry had taken the child she brought him in his arms, shaken hands with all his former friends—passing over his bro∣ther in the number—and set sail in a vessel bound for Africa, with a party of Portuguese and some few English adventurers, to people there the uninhabited part of an extensive island.</P>
<P>This was a resolution, in Henry's circum∣stances, worthy a mind of singular sensibility: but William had not discerned, till then, that every act of Henry's was of the same descrip∣tion; and more than all, his every act towards him.—He staggered when he heard the tidings; at first thought them untrue; but quickly re∣collected that Henry was capable of surprising deeds! He recollected, with a force that gave him torture, the benevolence his brother had ever shown towards him—the favours he had heaped upon him—the insults he had patiently endured in requital!</P>
<P>In the first emotion, which this intelligence gave the dean, he forgot the dignity of his walk and gesture—He ran with frantic enthusiasm to every corner of his house where the least ves∣tige of what belonged to Henry remained—He
<PB N="24" REF="030623_0024_0FE83B8432CDCC60"/>
pressed close to his breast, with tender agony, a coat of his, which by accident had been left there—He kissed and wept over a walking-stick which Henry once had given him—He even took up a music-book of his brother's with de∣light—nor would his poor violin, had it been there, have then excited anger.</P>
<P>When his grief became more calm, he sat in deep and melancholy meditation, calling to mind, when, and where he saw his brother last. The recollection gave him fresh cause of regret. He remembered they had parted on his refusal to suffer Lady Clementina to admit the acquaint∣ance of Henry's wife.—Both Henry and his wife he now contemplated beyond the reach of his pride; and he felt the meanness of his tri∣umph.</P>
<P>To add to his self-reproaches, he beheld in his tormented memory the countenance of his brother at their last interview, as it changed, while he censured his marriage, and treated with disrepect the object of his conjugal affection. He remembered the anger repressed, the tear bursting forth, and the last glimpse he had of him, as he left his presence for ever.</P>
<P>In vain he now wished, that he had followed him to the door—that he had once shaken hands and owned his obligations to him before they
<PB N="25" REF="030623_0025_0FE83B8B288590D0"/>
had parted. In vain he wished too, that, in this extreme agony of his mind, he had such a friend to comfort him, as Henry had ever proved.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE avocations of an elevated life erase the deepest impressions—the dean, in a few months, recovered of those which his brother's departure first made upon him; and would now at times even condemn, in anger, Henry's having so hastily abandoned him and his native country, in resentment, as he conceived, of a few mis∣fortunes which his usual fortitude should have taught him to bear. Yet, was he still desirous of his return, and wrote two or three letters ex∣pressive of his wish, which he anxiously endea∣voured should reach him. But many years elapsing without any intelligence from him, and a report having arrived that he, and all the party with whom he went, were slain by the sa∣vage inhabitants of the island, William's de∣spair of seeing his brother again, caused the de∣sire to diminish; while attention and affection to a still nearer and dearer relation than Henry ever was to him, now chiefly engaged his mind.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina had brought him a son, on whom, from his infancy, he doated—and the
<PB N="26" REF="030623_0026_0FE83B8CAEC43E88"/>
boy, in riper years, possessing a handsome per∣son, and evincing a quickness of parts, gratifi∣ed the father's darling passion, pride; as well as the mother's vanity.</P>
<P>The dean had, besides this child, a domestic comfort highly gratifying to his ambition: the bishop of **** became intimately acquainted with him soon after his marriage, and from his daily visits had become, as it were, a part of the family. This was much honour to the dean, not only as the bishop was his superior in the church, but was of that part of the bench whose blood is ennobled by a race of ancestors, and to which all wisdom on the plebeian side crouches in humble respect.</P>
<P>Year after year rolled on in pride and gran∣deur; the bishop and the dean passing their time in attending levees and in talking politics; La∣dy Clementina passing hers in attending routs and in talking of <HI>herself,</HI> till the son arrived at the age of thirteen.</P>
<P>Young William passed <HI>his</HI> time, from morn∣ing till night, with persons who taught him to walk, to ride, to talk, to think like a man—a foolish man, instead of a wife child, as nature de∣signed him to be.</P>
<P>This unfortunate youth was never permit∣ted to have one conception of his own—all was
<PB N="27" REF="030623_0027_0FE83B93C11DB0B8"/>
taught him—he was never once asked "what he thought? but men were paid to tell him "how to think." He was taught to revere such and such persons, however unworthy of his reverence; to believe such and such things how∣ever unworthy of his credit; and to act so and so, on such and such occasions, however unwor∣thy of his feelings.</P>
<P>Such were the lessons of the tutors assigned him by his father—Those masters whom his mother gave him did him less mischief; for though they distorted his limbs and made his manners effeminate, they did not interfere with the internal.</P>
<P>Mr. Norwynne (the family name of his fa∣ther, and though but a school-boy, he was cal∣led <HI>Mister</HI>) could talk on history, on politics, and on religion; surprisingly to all who never listened to a parrot or a magpie—for he merely repeated what he had heard, without one reflec∣tion upon the sense or probability of his report. He had been praised for his memory, and to con∣tinue that praise, he was so anxious to retain every sentence he had heard or he had read, that the poor creature had no time for one native idea, but only re-delivered his tutors' lessons to his father, and his father's to his tutors. But, whatever he said or did, was the admiration of
<PB N="28" REF="030623_0028_0FE83B9547F8A258"/>
all who came to the house of the dean, and who knew he was an only child—Indeed, considering the labour that was taken to spoil him, he was rather a commendable youth; for, with the pe∣dantic folly of his tutors, the blind affection of his father and mother, the obsequiousness of the servants, and flattery of the visitors, it was some credit to him that he was not an ideot or a brute—Though, when he imitated the manners of a man, he had something of the latter in his appearance—for he would grin and bow to a lady, catch her fan in haste if it fell, and hand her to her coach, as thoroughly void of all the sentiment, which gives grace to such tricks, as a monkey.</P>

<P>ONE morning in winter, just as the dean, his wife, and darling child, had finished their breakfast at their house in London, a servant brought in a letter to his master, and said "The man waited for an answer."</P>
<P>"Who is the man?" cried the dean with all that terrifying dignity, with which he never fail∣ed to address his inferiors, especially such as wai∣ted on his person.</P>
<P>The servant replied with a servility of tone
<PB N="29" REF="030623_0029_0FE83B9C49DD5078"/>
equal to the haughty one of his master "he did not know, but that the man looked like a sai∣lor, and had a boy with him."</P>
<P>"A begging letter no doubt," cried Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>"Take it back," said the dean, "and bid him send up word who he is, or what is his errand."</P>
<P>The servant went; and returning said, "He comes from on board a ship, his captain sent him, and his errand is, he believes, to leave a boy he has brought with him."</P>
<P>"A boy!" cried the dean, "what have I to do with a boy? I expect no boy. What boy? What age?"</P>
<P>"He looks about twelve or thirteen," repli∣ed the servant.</P>
<P>"He is mistaken in the house," said the dean. "Let me look at the letter again."</P>
<P>He did look at it, and saw it was directed plainly to himself—Upon a second glance, he had so perfect a recollection of the hand as to open it instantaneously; and, after ordering the servant to withdraw, he read the following.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Zo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tora Island,</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR BROTHER WILLIAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a long time since we have seen one another, but I hope not so long that you have quite forgotten the many happy days we once passed together.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="030623_0030_0FE83B9DCF777CE8"/>
I did not take my leave of you when I left England, because it would have been to much for me—I had met with a great many sorrows just at that time, one of which was, the misfor∣tune of losing the use of my right hand by a fall from my horse, which accident robbed me of most of my friends; for I could no longer entertain them with my performance as I used to do; and so I was ashamed to see them or you; and that was the reason I came hither to try my fortune with some other adventurers.</P>
<P>You have I suppose heard, how the savages of the island put our whole party to death except myself. I was heart-broken for my comrades, but yet upon the whole I do not know that the savages were much to blame—we had no busi∣ness to invade their territories, and if they had invaded England, we should have done the same by them.—My life was spared, because, having gained some little strength in my hand, during the voyage, I pleased their king, when I arrived there, with playing on my violin.</P>
<P>They spared my child too, in pity to my la∣mentations, when they were going to put him to death.—Now, dear brother, before I say any more concerning my child to you, I will first ask your pardon for any offence I may have ever given you in all the time we lived so long toge∣ther
<PB N="31" REF="030623_0031_0FE83BA5142B44E0"/>
—I know you have often found fault with me, and I dare say I have been to blame very often; but I here solemnly declare that I never did any thing purposely to offend you, but most∣ly all I could to oblige you—and I can safely declare, that I never bore you above a quarter of an hour's resentment, for any thing you might say to me which I thought harsh.</P>
<P>Now, dear William, after being in this island eleven years, the weakness in my hand has unfortunately returned, and yet there being no appearance of complaint, the uninformed islan∣ders think it is all my obstinacy, and that I <HI>will not</HI> entertain them with my music, which makes me say that I <HI>cannot;</HI> and they have imprison∣ed me, and threaten to put my son to death if I persist in my stubbornness any longer.</P>
<P>The anguish I feel in my mind takes away all hope of the recovery of strength in my hand, and I have no doubt but that they intend in a few days to put their horrid threat into execu∣tion.</P>
<P>Therefore, dear brother William, hearing from my prison of a most uncommon circum∣stance, which is, that an English vessel is lying at a small distance from the island, I have en∣trusted a faithful negro to take my child to the ship, and deliver him to the captain, with a re∣quest
<PB N="32" REF="030623_0032_0FE83BA699CF50A8"/>
that he may be sent (with this letter) to you, on the ship's arrival in England.</P>
<P>Now my dear dear brother William, in case the poor boy should live to come to you, I have no doubt but you will receive him; yet, excuse a poor fond father, if I say a word or two that I hope may prove in his favour.</P>
<P>Pray, my dear brother, do not think it the child's fault, but mine, that you will find him so ignorant—he has always shown a quickness and a willingness to learn, and would, I dare say, if he had been brought up under your care, have been by this time a Greek scholar—but you know I am no scholar myself. Besides, not having any books here, I have only been able to teach my child by talking to him; and in all my conversations with him I have never taken much pains to instruct him in the man∣ners of my own country; thinking, that if ever he went over, he would learn them soon enough; and if he never <HI>did</HI> go over, that it would be as well he knew nothing about them.</P>
<P>I have kept him also from the knowledge of every thing which I have thought pernicious in the conduct of the savages, except now and then pointing out a few of their faults, in order to give him a true conception and a proper dis∣taste of them. At the same time I have taught
<PB N="33" REF="030623_0033_0FE83BAD5A6DF5F0"/>
him to love, and to do good to his neighbour, whoever that neighbour might be, and whate∣ver might be his failings. Falsehood of every kind I included in this precept as forbidden; for no one can love his neighbour and deceive him.</P>
<P>I have instructed him too, to hold in con∣tempt all frivolous vanity, and all kinds of in∣dulgences which he was never likely to obtain. He has learnt all I have undertaken to teach him, but I am afraid you will yet think he has learnt too little.</P>
<P>Your wife, I fear, will be offended at his want of politeness, and perhaps want of proper respect for a person of her rank; but indeed he is very tractable, and can, without severity; be cured of all his faults; and though you will find he has many, yet, pray my dear brother, pray my dear brother William, call to mind he has been a du∣tiful and affectionate child to me; and that, had it pleased heaven we had lived together for many years to come, I verily believe, that I should never have experienced one mark of his disobedience.</P>
<P>Farewel for ever, my dear dear brother William—and if my poor, kind, affectionate child should live to bring you this letter, some∣times speak to him of me; and let him know, that for twelve years he was my sole comfort;
<PB N="34" REF="030623_0034_0FE83BAEE1061DE8"/>
and that, when I sent him from me, in order to save his life, I laid down my head upon the floor of the cell in which I was confined, and prayed that heaven might end my days before the mor∣ning.</P>
<P>This was the conclusion of the letter, except four or five lines which (with his name) were so much blotted, apparently with tears, that they were illegible.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the dean was reading to himself this letter, his countenance frequently changed, and once or twice the tears streamed from his eyes. When it was finished, he exclaimed,</P>
<P>"My brother has sent his child to me, and I will be a parent to him." He was going to∣wards the door when Lady Clementina stopped him.</P>
<P>"Is it proper, do you think, dean, that all the servants in the house should be witnesses to your meeting with your brother and your ne∣phew in the state in which they must be at pre∣sent?—send for them into a private apartment."</P>
<P>"My brother!" (cried the dean) "Oh that it <HI>were</HI> my brother! The man is merely a person from the ship, who has conducted his child hither."</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="030623_0035_0FE83BB657087818"/>
The bell was rung, money was sent to the man, and orders given that the boy should be shown up immediately.</P>
<P>While young Henry was walking up the stairs, the dean's wife was weighing in her mind, in what manner it would most redound to her honour to receive him; for her vanity taught her to believe that the whole inquisitive world pried into her conduct even upon every family occurrence.</P>
<P>Young William was wondering to himself what kind of an unpolished monster his beggar∣ly cousin would appear; and was contemplat∣ing, "how much the poor youth would be sur∣prised and awed by his superiority."</P>
<P>The dean felt no other sensation than an im∣patient desire of beholding the child.</P>
<P>The door opened—and the son of his brother Henry, of his benefactor, entered.</P>
<P>The habit he had on when he left his father, being worn out by the length of the voyage, he was in the dress of a sailor-boy. Though about the same age with his cousin, he was something taller: and though a strong family resemblance appeared between the two youths, he was hand∣somer than William; and from a simplicity spread over his countenance, a quick impatience in his eye, which denoted anxious curiosity,
<PB N="36" REF="030623_0036_0FE83BB7DD1DA0E8"/>
and childish surprise at every new object which presented itself, he appeared younger than his in∣formed, and well-bred cousin.</P>
<P>He walked into the room, not with a dicta∣ed obeisance, but with a hurrying step, a half pleased, yet a half frightened look, an instanta∣neous survey of every person present; not as demanding "what they thought of him," but expressing, almost as plainly as in direct words, "what he thought of them." For all alarm in respect to his safety and reception seemed now wholly forgotten in the curiosity which the sud∣den sight of strangers, such as he had never seen in his life before, excited. And as to <HI>himself,</HI> he did not appear to know there was such a per∣son existing: his whole faculties were absorbed in <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>The dean's reception of him did honour to his sensibility; and his gratitude to his brother. After the first affectionate gaze, he ran to him, took him in his arms, sat down, drew him to him, held him between his knees, and repeated∣edly exclaimed, "I will repay to you, all I owe to your father."</P>
<P>The boy, in return, hugged the dean round the neck, kissed him, and cried,</P>
<P>"Oh, you <HI>are</HI> my father—you have just such eyes, and such a forehead—indeed you would be
<PB N="37" REF="030623_0037_0FE83BBE995C8208"/>
almost the same as he, if it were not for that great white thing which grows upon your head!"</P>
<P>Let the reader understand, that the dean, fondly attached to every ornament of his digni∣fied function, was never seen (unless caught in bed) without an enormous wig—with this, young Henry was enormously struck; having never seen so unbecoming a decoration, either in the savage island from whence he came, or on board of the vessel in which he sailed.</P>
<P>"Do you imagine" (cried his uncle, laying his hand gently on the reverend habiliment) "that this grows?"</P>
<P>"What is on <HI>my</HI> head grows," said young Henry, "and so does what is upon my fa∣ther's."</P>
<P>"But now you are come to Europe, you will see many persons with such things as these, which they put on and take off."</P>
<P>"Why do you wear such things?"</P>
<P>"As a distinction between us and inferior people: they are worn to give an importance to the wearer."</P>
<P>"That is just as the savages do; they stick brass nails, wire, buttons, and entrails of beasts all over them to give them importance."</P>
<P>The dean now led his nephew to Lady Cle∣mentina,
<PB N="38" REF="030623_0038_0FE83BC0220CEB40"/>
and told him "That was his aunt, to whom he must behave with the utmost re∣spect."</P>
<P>"I will, I will," he replied, "for she, I see, is a person of importance too—she has, very near, such a white thing upon her head as you have!"</P>
<P>His aunt had not yet fixed, in what manner it was best to behave; whether with intimidat∣ing grandeur, or with amiable tenderness. While she was hesitating between the two, she felt a kind of jealous apprehension that her son was not so engaging either in his person or ad∣dress as his cousin; and therefore she said,</P>
<P>"I hope, dean, the arrival of this child will give you a still higher sense of the happiness we enjoy in our own—what an instructive contrast between the manners of the one, and of the other!"</P>
<P>"It is not the child's fault," returned the dean, "that he is not so elegant in his manners as his cousin;—had William been bred in the same place, he would have been as unpolished as this boy."</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon, sir" (said young Wil∣liam with a formal bow and a sarcastic smile) "for I assure you that several of my tutors have told me, that I appear to know many things by instinct."</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="030623_0039_0FE83BC6C4303C30"/>
Young Henry fixed his eyes upon his cou∣sin while with steady self-complacency he deli∣vered this speech; and no sooner was it conclu∣ded than Henry cried out in a kind of wonder,</P>
<P>"A little man! as I am alive, a little man! I did not know there were such little men in this country! I never saw one in my life be∣fore!"</P>
<P>"This is a boy," said the dean, "a boy not older than yourself."</P>
<P>He put their hands together, and William gravely shook hands with his cousin.</P>
<P>"It <HI>is</HI> a man," continued young Henry—then stroked his cousin's chin. "No no, I do not know whether it is or not."</P>
<P>"I tell you again," said the dean, "he is a boy of your own age—you and he are cousins, for I am his father."</P>
<P>"How can that be?" said young Henry, "he called you <HI>Sir.</HI>"</P>
<P>"In this country," said the dean, "polite children do not call their parents <HI>father</HI> and <HI>mo∣ther.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Then don't they sometimes forget to love them as such?" asked Henry.</P>
<P>His uncle became now impatient to interro∣gate him in every particular, concerning his fa∣ther's state—Lady Clementina felt equal impa∣tience
<PB N="40" REF="030623_0040_0FE83BC84A7811A8"/>
to know where the father was; whether he was coming to live with them, wanted any thing of them, and every circumstance in which her vanity was interested. Explanations fol∣lowed all these questions; but which, merely agreeing with what the elder Henry's letter has related, require no recital here.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>THAT vanity which presided over every thought and deed of Lady Clementina's, was the protector of young Henry within her house: it represented to her "how amiable her conduct would appear in the eye of the world, should she condescend to treat this destitute nephew as her own son:" it represented to her "the envy such heroic virtue would excite in the hearts of her particular friends, and what grief in the bosom of all those who did not like her."</P>
<P>The dean was a man of acute penetration; he understood the thoughts which upon this oc∣casion passed in the mind of his wife; and in order to insure her kind treatment of the boy, instead of reproaching her for the cold manner in which she had at first received him, he praised her tender and sympathetic heart for having shown him so much kindness: and thus stimu∣lated her vanity to be praised still more.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="030623_0041_0FE83BCF0845DBE0"/>
William, the mother's own son, far from ap∣prehending a rival in this savage boy, was con∣vinced of his own pre-eminence, and felt an affec∣tion for him; though rather as a foil than as a cousin. He sported with his ignorance upon all occasions, and even lay in wait for circumstan∣ces that might expose it; while young Henry, strongly impressed with every thing that appear∣ed new to him, expressed, without reserve, the sensations which those novelties excited; and felt little care what construction was put upon his observations.</P>
<P>He never appeared offended or abashed when laughed at, but still pursued his questions, and still discovered his wonder at many replies made to him, though "simpleton," "poor silly boy," and "ideot," were vociferated around him from his cousin, his aunt, and their constant visitor the bishop.</P>
<P>His uncle would frequently undertake to in∣struct him; so indeed would the bishop; but Lady Clementina, her son, and the greatest part of her companions, found something so irresistibly ridiculous in his remarks, that nothing but immoderate laughter followed: they thought such folly had even merit in the way of enter∣tainment, and they wished him no wiser.</P>
<P>Having been told, that every morning on first
<PB N="42" REF="030623_0042_0FE83BD08E570540"/>
seeing his uncle, he was to make a respectful bow, and coming into the dean's dressing room just as he was out of bed, his wig lying on the table, Henry appeared at a loss which of the two he should bow to—at last he gave the prefer∣ence to his uncle; but afterwards bowed reve∣rently to the wig. In this, he did what he con∣ceived was proper, from the introduction which the dean, on his first arrival, had given him to this venerable stranger; for in reality, Henry had a contempt for all finery; and had called even his aunt's jewels, when they were first shown to him, "trumpery," asking, "what they were good for?" But being corrected in this disrespect, and informed of their high va∣lue, he, like a good convert, gave up his reason to his faith: and becoming, like all converts, over zealous, he now believed there was great worth in glittering appearances, and respected the ear-rings of Lady Clementina almost as much as he respected her.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT was to be lamented, that when young Henry had been several months in England, had been taught to read, and had of course, in the society in which he lived, seen much of the
<PB N="43" REF="030623_0043_0FE83BD7762EED08"/>
enlightened world, yet the natural expectation of his improvement was by no means answered.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the sensibility which upon various occasions he manifested in the most cap∣tivating degree, notwithstanding the seeming gentleness of his nature upon all occasions, there now appeared in most of his enquiries and re∣marks, a something which demonstrated either a stupid, or troublesome disposition; either dull∣ness of conception, or an obstinacy of persever∣ance in comments and in arguments that were glaringly false.</P>
<P>Observing his uncle one day offended with his coachman, and hearing him say to him in a very angry tone, "You shall never drive me again"—</P>
<P>The moment the man quitted the room, Hen∣ry (with his eyes fixed in the deepest contemp∣lation) repeated five or six times in a half whisper to himself,</P>
<P>"You shall never drive me again. You shall never drive me again."</P>
<P>The dean at last asked, "what he meant by thus repeating his words?"</P>
<P>"I am trying to find out what <HI>you</HI> meant," said Henry.</P>
<P>"What! do not you know," cried his en∣lightened cousin, "Richard is turned away—
<PB N="44" REF="030623_0044_0FE83BD90051A658"/>
he is never to get upon our coach-box again; never to drive any of us any more."</P>
<P>"And was it pleasure to drive us, cousin?—I am sure I have often pitied him—it rained sometimes very hard when he was on the box—and sometimes Lady Clementina has kept him a whole hour at the door all in the cold and snow—was that pleasure?"</P>
<P>"No," replied young William.</P>
<P>"Was it honour, cousin?"</P>
<P>"No," exclaimed his cousin with a contemp∣tuous smile.</P>
<P>"Then why did my uncle say to him as a punishment "he should never"—</P>
<P>"Come hither, child," said the dean, "and let me instruct you—your father's negligence has been inexcusable—There are in society," continued the dean, "rich and poor; the poor are born to serve the rich."</P>
<P>"And what are the rich born for?"</P>
<P>"To be served by the poor."</P>
<P>"But suppose the poor would not serve them?"</P>
<P>"Then they must starve.</P>
<P>"And so poor people are permitted to live, only upon condition that they wait upon the rich?"</P>
<P>"Is that a hard condition?—or if it were,
<PB N="45" REF="030623_0045_0FE83BE012C47568"/>
they will be rewarded in a better world than this."</P>
<P>"Is there a better world than this?"</P>
<P>"Is it possible you do not know there is?"</P>
<P>"I heard my father once say something about a world to come; but he stopt short, and said I was too young to understand what he meant."</P>
<P>"The world to come," returned the dean, "is where we shall go after death; and there no distinction will be made between rich and poor—all persons there will be equal."</P>
<P>"Aye, now I see what makes it a better world than this. But cannot this world try to be as good as that?"</P>
<P>"In respect to placing all persons on a level, it is utterly impossible—God has ordained it otherwise."</P>
<P>"How! has Good ordained a distinction to be made, and will not make any himself?"</P>
<P>The dean did not proceed in his instructions; he now began to think his brother in the right, and that the boy was too young, or too weak, to comprehend the subject.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>IN addition to his ignorant conversation up∣on many topics, young Henry had an incorrigi∣ble
<PB N="46" REF="030623_0046_0FE83BE19985CC58"/>
misconception and misapplication of many <HI>words</HI>—his father having had but few opportu∣nities of discoursing with him upon account of his attendance at the court of the savages; and not having books in the island, he had consequently many words to learn of this country's language when he arrived in England; this task his re∣tentive memory made easy to him; but his child∣ish inattention to their proper signification still made his want of education conspicuous.</P>
<P>He would call <HI>compliments, lies—Reserve,</HI> he would call <HI>pride—stateliness, affectation</HI>—and for the monosyllable <HI>war,</HI> he constantly substituted the word <HI>massacre.</HI></P>
<P>"Sir," said William, to his father one mor∣ning as he entered the room, "do you hear how the cannons are firing, and the bells ringing?"</P>
<P>"Then I dare say," cried Henry, "there has been another massacre."</P>
<P>The dean called to him in anger, "Will you never learn the right use of words? You mean to say a battle."</P>
<P>"Then what is a massacre?" cried the frightened, but still curious Henry.</P>
<P>"A massacre," replied his uncle, "is when a number of people are slain—"</P>
<P>"I thought," returned Henry, "soldiers had been people!"</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="030623_0047_0FE83BE8C4FB44C0"/>
"You interrupt me," said the dean, "before I finished my sentence—certainly, both soldiers and sailors are people, but they engage to die by their own free will and consent."</P>
<P>"What I all of them?"</P>
<P>"Most of them."</P>
<P>"But the rest are massacred?"</P>
<P>The dean answered, "The number that go to battle unwillingly, and by force, are few; and for the others they have previously sold their lives to the state."</P>
<P>"For what?"</P>
<P>"For soldiers' pay and sailors' pay."</P>
<P>"My father used to tell me we must not take away our own lives; but he forgot to tell me, we might sell them for others to take away."</P>
<P>"William," (said the dean to his son, his patience tired with his nephew's persevering nonsense) "explain to your cousin the differ∣ence between a battle and a massacre."</P>
<P>"A massacre," said William, rising from his seat, and fixing his eyes alternately upon his father, his mother, and the bishop (all of whom were present) for their approbation, rather than the person's to whom his instructions were to be addressed—"a massacre," said William, "is
<PB N="48" REF="030623_0048_0FE83BEA4A572010"/>
when human beings are slain, who have it not in their power to defend themselves."</P>
<P>"Dear cousin William," (said Henry) "that must ever be the case, with every one who is killed."</P>
<P>After a short hesitation, William replied, "In massacres people are put to death for no crime, but merely because they are objects of suspicion."</P>
<P>"But in battle," said Henry, "the persons put to death, are not even suspected."</P>
<P>The bishop now condescended to end this dis∣putation by saying emphatically,</P>
<P>"Consider, young savage, that in battle nei∣ther the infant, the aged, the sick or infirm are involved, but only those in the full prime of health and vigour."</P>
<P>As this argument came from so great and reverend a man as the bishop, Henry was obli∣ged, by a frown from his uncle, to submit, as one refuted; although he had an answer at the veriest tip of his tongue, which it was torture to him not to utter. What he wished to say must ever remain a secret.—The church has its terrors as well as the law, and Henry was awed by the dean's tremendous wig, as much as Pa∣ter-noster Row is awed by the attorney-general.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>IF the dean had loved his wife but moderate∣ly seeing all her faults clearly as he did, he must frequently have quarrelled with her: if he had loved her with tenderness, he must have treated her with a degree of violence in the hope of amending her failings: but having neither personal, nor mental affection towards her suffi∣ciently interesting to give himself the trouble to contradict her will in any thing, he passed for one of the best husbands in the world.—Lady Clementina went out when she liked, staid at home when she liked, dressed as she liked, and talked as she liked, without a word of disapprobation from her husband, and all—because he cared nothing about her.</P>
<P>Her vanity attributed this indulgence to in∣ordinate affection: and observers in general thought her happier in her marriage, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beloved wife who bathes her pillow with her, tears by the side of an angry husband, whose affection is so excessive, that he unkindly up∣braids her because she is—less than perfection.</P>
<P>The dean's wife was not so dispationately considered by some of his acquaintance as by himself; for they would now and then hint at her foibles; but this great liberty she also con∣ceived to be the effect of most violent love, or
<PB N="50" REF="030623_0050_0FE83BF2B0CE1C30"/>
most violent admiration; and such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been her construction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they commended her follies—had they totally slighted, or had they beaten her.</P>
<P>Amongst those acquaintances, the bishop of ****, by far the most frequent visit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ did not come merely to lounge an idle hour, but he had a more powerful motive; the desire of same, and dread of being thought a man receiving large emolument for unimportant service.</P>
<P>The dean, if he did not procure him the re∣nown he wished, still preserved him from the apprehended censure.</P>
<P>The elder William was to his negligent or ignorant superiors in the church, such as an apt boy at school is to the rich dunces—William performed the prelates' tasks for them, and they rewarded him—not indeed with toys or money, but with their countenance, their company, their praise.—And scarcely was there a sermon preached from the patrician part of the bench, that the dean did not fashion some periods, blot out some uncouth phrases, render some ob∣scure sentiments intelligible, and was the cer∣tain person, when the work was printed, to cor∣rect the press.</P>
<P>The Honourable and Right Reverend Bishop of **** delighted in printing and publishing
<PB N="51" REF="030623_0051_0FE83BF9966EE798"/>
his works; or rather the entire works of the dean, which passed for his—and so degradingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> William, the shopkeeper's son, think of his own honest extraction, that he was blinded, even to the loss of honour, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of this noble acquaintance: for though, in other re∣spects, a man of integrity, yet, when the grati∣fication of his friend was the concern, he was a liar; he not only disowned his giving him aid in any of his publications, but he never publish∣ed any thing in his own name, without declar∣ing to the world, "That he had been obliged for all the hints on the subject, for many of the most judicious corrections, and for those pas∣sages in page so and so (naming the most eloquent part of the work) to his noble and learned friend the bishop.</P>
<P>The dean's wife being a fine lady—while her husband and his friend pored over books or their own manuscripts at home, she ran from house to house, from public amusement to public amusement, but much less for the pleasure of <HI>seeing</HI> than for that of being <HI>seen.</HI> Nor was it material to her enjoyment whether she was ob∣served, or welcome where she went, as she ne∣ver entertained the smallest doubt of either; but rested assured that her presence roused curiosity and dispensed gladness all around.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="030623_0052_0FE83BFB1D532038"/>
One morning she went forth to pay her vi∣sits, all smiles, such as she thought captivat∣ing: she returned all tears, such as she thought no less endearing.</P>
<P>Three ladies accompanied her home, entreat∣ing her to be patient under a misfortune to which even kings are liable, namely, defama∣tion.</P>
<P>Young Henry, struck with compassion at grief, of which he knew not yet the cause, beg∣ged to know "What was the matter?"</P>
<P>"Inhuman monsters, to treat a woman thus!" cried his aunt in fury—casting the cor∣ner of her eye into a looking glass to see how rage became her.</P>
<P>"But, comfort yourself" (said one of her companions) "few people will believe you me∣rit the charge."</P>
<P>"But few! if only one believe it, I shall call my reputation lost, and I will shut myself in some lonely hut, and give up all that is dear to me forever!"</P>
<P>"What! all your fine clothes!" said Henry in amazement.</P>
<P>"Of what importance will my best dresses be, when nobody would see them?"</P>
<P>"You would see them yourself, dear aunt, and I am sure nobody admires them more."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="030623_0053_0FE83C01B702FE18"/>
"Now you speak of that," said she, "I do not think this gown I have on becoming—I am sure I look—"</P>
<P>The dean, with the bishop, (to whom he had been reading a treatise just going to the press, which was to be published in the name of the latter, though written by the former) now en∣tered, to enquire why they had been sent for in such haste.</P>
<P>"Oh dean! Oh my lord!" she cried, re∣suming that grief which the thoughts of her dress had for a time dispelled—"My reputation is destroyed—a public print has accused me of playing deep at my own house, and winning all the money."</P>
<P>"The world will never reform," said the bishop: "all our labour, my friend, is thrown away."</P>
<P>"But is it possible," cried the dean, "that any one has dared to say this of you?"</P>
<P>"Here it is in print," said she, holding out a newspaper.</P>
<P>The dean read the paragraph, and then ex∣claimed, "I can forgive a falsehood <HI>spoken</HI>—the warmth of conversation may excuse it—but to <HI>write</HI> and <HI>print</HI> an untruth is unpardonable—and I will prosecute this publisher."</P>
<P>"Still the falsehood will go down to posteri∣ty,"
<PB N="54" REF="030623_0054_0FE83C0342591AD0"/>
said Lady Clementina, "and after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges will think I was a gambler."</P>
<P>"Comfort yourself, dear madam," said young Henry, wishing to console her, "perhaps after ages may not hear of you; nor even the present age think much about you."</P>
<P>The bishop now exclaimed, after having ta∣ken the paper from the dean and read the para∣graph, "It is a libel, a rank libel, and the au∣thor must be punished."</P>
<P>"Not only the author but the publisher," said the dean.</P>
<P>"Not only the publisher, but the printer," continued the bishop.</P>
<P>"And must my name be bandied about by lawyers in a common court of justice?" cried Lady Clementina: "How shocking to my de∣licacy!"</P>
<P>"My lord, it is a pity we cannot try them by the ecclesiastical court," said the dean, with a sigh!</P>
<P>"Nor by the India delinquent bill," said the bishop with vexation.</P>
<P>"So totally innocent as I am!" she vocife∣rated with sobs: "Every one knows I never touch a card at home, and this libel charges me with playing at my own house—and though, whenever I do play, I own I am apt to win, yet it is merely for my amusement."</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="030623_0055_0FE83C0A603091F0"/>
"Win or not win, play or not play," ex∣claimed both the church-men, "this is a libel: no doubt, no doubt, a libel."</P>
<P>Poor Henry's confined knowledge of his na∣tive language tormented him so much with cu∣riosity upon this occasion, that he went softly up to his uncle, and asked him in a whisper, "What was the meaning of the word libel?"</P>
<P>"A libel," replied the dean, in a raised voice, "is that, which one person publishes to the in∣jury of another."</P>
<P>"And what can the injured person do," asked Henry, "if the accusation should chance to be true?"</P>
<P>"Prosecute," replied the dean.</P>
<P>"But then what does he do if the accusation is false?"</P>
<P>"Prosecute likewise," answered the dean.</P>
<P>"How, uncle! is it possible that the inno∣cent behave just like the guilty?"</P>
<P>"There is no other way to act."</P>
<P>"Why then, if I was the innocent, I would do nothing at all, sooner than I would act like the guilty. I would not persecute—"</P>
<P>"I said <HI>prosecute,</HI>" cried the dean in anger: "Leave the room, you have no comprehension."</P>
<P>"Oh yes, now I understand the difference of the two words—but they sound so alike I
<PB N="56" REF="030623_0056_0FE83C0BE6745088"/>
did not observe the distinction at first. You said, "the innocent <HI>prosecute,</HI> but the guilty <HI>persecute.</HI>" He bowed (convinced as he thought) and left the room.</P>
<P>"After this modern star-chamber, which was left sitting, had agreed on its mode of ven∣geance, and the writer of the libel was made acquainted with his danger, he waited, in all humility, upon Lady Clementina, and assured her, with every appearance of sincerity—</P>
<P>"That she was not the person alluded to by the paragraph in question, but that the initials which she had conceived to mark out her name, were, in fact, meant to point out Lady Catha∣rine Newland.</P>
<P>"But, Sir," cried Lady Clementina, "what could induce you to write such a paragraph upon Lady Catharine? She <HI>never</HI> plays."</P>
<P>"We know that, madam, or we dared not to have attacked her. Though we must circulate libels, madam, to gratify our numerous readers, yet no people are more in fear of prosecutions than authors and editors; therefore, unless we are deceived in our information, we always take care to libel the innocent—we apprehend nothing from them—their own characters sup∣port them—but the guilty are very tenacious; and what they cannot secure by fair means, they
<PB N="57" REF="030623_0057_0FE83C12C26AA700"/>
will employ force to accomplish. Dear ma∣dam, be assured I have too much regard for a wife and seven small children, who are main∣tained by my industry alone, to have written any thing in the nature of a libel upon your ladyship."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this period the dean had just pub∣lished a pamphlet in his own name, and in which that of his friend the bishop was only mentioned with thanks for hints, observations, and condescending encouragement to the author.</P>
<P>This pamphlet glowed with the dean's love for his country; and such a country as he de∣scribed, it was impossible <HI>not</HI> to love. "Salu∣brious air, fertile fields, wood, water, corn, grass, sheep, oxen, fish, fowl, fruit, and vegeta∣bles," were dispersed with the most prodigal hand—"valient men; pretty women; statesmen wise and just; tradesmen abounding in mer∣chandise and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, husbandmen possessing peace, ease, plenty: and all ranks, liberty,"—This brilliant description, while the dean read the work to his family, so charmed poor Henry that he repeatedly cried out,</P>
<P>"I am glad I came to this country."</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="030623_0058_0FE83C144842FD80"/>
But it so happened, that a few days after, Lady Clementina, in order to render the delica∣cy of her taste admired, could eat of no one dish upon the table, but found fault with them all. The dean at length said to her,</P>
<P>"Indeed you are too nice—reflect upon the hundreds of poor creatures who have not a mor∣sel, or a drop of any thing to subsist upon, ex∣cept bread and water; and even of the first a scanty allowance, but for which they are oblig∣ed to toil six days in the week, from sun to sun."</P>
<P>"Pray, uncle," cried Henry, "in what country do these poor people live?"</P>
<P>"In this country," replied the dean.</P>
<P>Henry rose from his chair, ran to the chim∣ney-piece, took up his uncle's pamphlet, and said, "I don't remember your mentioning them here."</P>
<P>"Perhaps I have not," answered the dean coolly.</P>
<P>Still Henry turned over each leaf of the book, but could meet only with luxurious details of "the fruits of the earth, the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea."</P>
<P>"Why here is provision enough for all the people," said Henry: "why should they want? why do not they go and take some of these things?"</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="030623_0059_0FE83C1B327501E8"/>
"They must not," said the dean, "unless they were their own."</P>
<P>"What! uncle, does no part of the earth, nor any thing which the earth produces, belong to the poor?"</P>
<P>"Certainly not."</P>
<P>"Why did not you say so then in your pam∣phlet?"</P>
<P>"Because it is what every body knows."</P>
<P>"Oh, then, what you have said in your pamphlet, is only what—nobody knows."</P>
<P>There appeared to the dean, in the delivery of this sentence, a satirical acrimony, which his irritability as an author could but ill forgive.</P>
<P>An author, it is said, has more acute feelings in respect to his works, than any artist in the world besides.</P>
<P>Henry had some cause, on the present occa∣sion, to think this observation just; for no sooner had he spoken the foregoing words, than his uncle took him by the hand out of the room; and leading him to his study, there he enume∣rated his various faults, and having told him "it was for all those, too long permitted with impunity, and not merely for the <HI>present</HI> imper∣tinence that he meant to punish him," ordered him to close confinement in his chamber for a week.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="030623_0060_0FE83C1CB97E0480"/>
In the mean time the dean's pamphlet (less hurt by Henry's critique than <HI>he</HI> had been) was proceeding to the tenth edition, and the author acquiring literary reputation beyond what he had ever conferred on his friend the bishop.</P>
<P>The stile, the energy, the eloquence of the work, was echoed by every reader who could afford to buy it—some few enlightened ones ex∣cepted, who chiefly admired the author's <HI>inven∣tion.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE dean, in the good humour which the rapid sale of his book produced, once more took his nephew to his bosom; and although the ig∣norance of young Henry, upon the late occasi∣ons, had offended him very highly, yet that self∣same ignorance, evinced a short time after upon a different subject, struck his uncle, as produc∣tive of a most rare and exalted virtue.</P>
<P>Henry had frequently in his conversation be∣trayed the total want of all knowledge in re∣spect to religion or futurity; and the dean for this reason delayed taking him to church, till he had previously given him instructions <HI>wherefore</HI> he went.</P>
<P>A leisure morning arrived on which he took his nephew to his study, and implanted in his
<PB N="61" REF="030623_0061_0FE83C23E53FDF98"/>
youthful mind, the first unconfused idea of the Creator of the universe!</P>
<P>The dean was eloquent; Henry was all at∣tention: his understanding, expanded by time, to the conception of a God—and not warped by custom, from the sensations which a just no∣tion of that God inspires, dwelt with delight and wonder on the information given him!—lessons, which instilled into the head of a sense∣less infant, too often produce throughout his re∣maining life, an impious indifference to the truths revealed.</P>
<P>Yet, with all that astonished, that respectful sensibility which Henry showed on this great occasion; he still expressed his opinion, and put questions to the dean with his usual simplicity, till he felt himself convinced.</P>
<P>"What!" cried he—after being informed of the attributes inseparable from the Supreme Be∣ing, and having received the injunction to offer prayers to him night and morning, "What! am I permitted to speak to power divine?"</P>
<P>"At all times," replied the dean.</P>
<P>"What! whenever I like?"</P>
<P>"Whenever you like," returned the dean.</P>
<P>"I durst not," cried Henry, "make so free with the bishop: nor dare any of his attendants."</P>
<P>"The bishop," said the dean, "is the ser∣vant
<PB N="62" REF="030623_0062_0FE83C256BBEEDC8"/>
of God, and therefore must be treated with respect."</P>
<P>"With more respect than his master?" ask∣ed Henry.</P>
<P>The dean not replying immediately to this question, Henry in the rapidity of enquiry ran to another: "But what am I to say when I speak to the Almighty?"</P>
<P>"First, thank him for the favours he has be∣stowed on you."</P>
<P>"What favours?"</P>
<P>"You amaze me," cried the dean, "by your question! Do not you live in ease, in plenty, and happiness?"</P>
<P>"And do the poor and the unhappy thank him too, uncle?"</P>
<P>No doubt—every human being glorifies him, for having been made a rational creature."</P>
<P>"And does my aunt and all her card parties glorify him for that?"</P>
<P>The dean again made no reply—and Henry went on to other questions, till his uncle had ful∣ly instructed him as to the nature and the form of <HI>prayer</HI>—and now putting into his hands a book, he pointed out to him a few short prayers which he wished him to address to heaven in his pre∣sence.</P>
<P>Whilst Henry bent his knees, as his uncle
<PB N="63" REF="030623_0063_0FE83C2C56B0EDF0"/>
had directed, he trembled—he turned pale—and held for a slight support, on the chair placed be∣fore him.</P>
<P>His uncle went to him and asked him, "What was the matter?"</P>
<P>"Oh!" cried Henry, "when I first came to your door with my poor father's letter, I shook for fear you would not look upon me—and I cannot help feeling even more now than I did then."</P>
<P>The dean embraced him with warmth—gave him confidence—and retired to the other side of the study to observe his whole demeanour on this new occasion.</P>
<P>As he beheld his features varying between the passions of humble fear, and fervent hope—his face sometimes glowing with the rapture of thanksgiving, and sometimes with the blushes of contrition, he thus exclaimed apart:</P>
<P>"This is the true education on which to found the principles of religion—The favour conferred by heaven in granting the freedom of petitions to its throne, can never be conceived with proper force, but by those, whose most tedious moments during their infancy, were <HI>not</HI> passed in prayer. Unthinking governors of childhood! to insult the Deity with a form of worship, in which the mind has no share; nay
<PB N="64" REF="030623_0064_0FE83C2DDD15E470"/>
worse, has repugnance; and by the thoughtless habits of youth, prevent, even in age, devo∣tion."</P>
<P>Henry's attention was so firmly fixed, that he forgot there was a spectator of his fervour; nor did he hear young William enter the cham∣ber and even speak to his father.</P>
<P>At length closing his book, and rising from his knees, he approached his uncle and cousin with a sedateness in his air, which gave the lat∣ter a very false opinion of the state of his youth∣ful companion's mind.</P>
<P>"So, Mr. Henry," cried William, "you have been obliged to say your prayers at last."</P>
<P>The dean informed his son, "That to Hen∣ry, it was no punishment to pray."</P>
<P>"He is the strangest boy I ever know," said William inadvertently.</P>
<P>"To be sure," said Henry, "I was fright∣ened when I first knelt; but when I came to the words <HI>Father which art in heaven,</HI> they gave me courage; for I know how merciful and kind a <HI>father</HI> is, beyond any one else."</P>
<P>The dean again embraced his nephew; let fall a tear to his poor brother Henry's misfortues; and admonished the youth to shew him∣self equally submissive to other instructions, as he had done to those, which inculcate piety.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE interim between youth and manhood was passed by young William and young Hen∣ry in studious application to literature; some casual mistakes in our customs and manners on the part of Henry, some too close adherences to them on the side of William.</P>
<P>Their different characters when boys, were preserved when they were men: Henry still re∣tained that natural simplicity which his early destiny had given him; he wondered still at ma∣ny things he saw and heard, and at times would venture to give his opinion, contradict, and even act in opposition to persons, whom long expe∣rience and the approbation of the world had pla∣ced in situations that claimed his implicit reve∣rence and submission.</P>
<P>Unchanged in all his boyish graces, young William, now a man, was never known to in∣fringe upon the statutes of good-breeding, even though sincerity, his own free will, duty to his neighbour, with many other plebeian virtues and privileges, were the sacrifice.</P>
<P>William inherited all the pride and ambition of the dean—Henry, all his father's humility.—And yet (so various and extensive is the accep∣tation of the word pride, that) on some occasi∣ons, Henry was proud even beyond his cousin.
<PB N="66" REF="030623_0066_0FE83C36945DD248"/>
He thought it far beneath his dignity, ever to honour or contemplate with awe, any human being in whom he saw numerous failings. Nor would he, to ingratiate himself into the favour of a man above him, stoop to one servility, such as the haughty William daily practised.</P>
<P>"I know I am called proud," one day said William to Henry.</P>
<P>"Dear cousin," replied Henry, "it must be only then, by those who do not know you: for to me you appear the humblest creature in the world."</P>
<P>"Do you really think so?"</P>
<P>"I am certain of it; or would you always give up your opinion to that of persons in a su∣perior state, however inferior in their under∣standing? Would, else, their weak judgment immediately change yours, though, before, you had been decided on the opposite side? Now in∣deed, cousin, I have more pride than you, for I never will stoop to act or to speak contrary to my feelings."</P>
<P>"Then you will never be a great man."</P>
<P>"Nor ever desire it, if I must first be a mean one."</P>
<P>There was in the reputation of these two young men another mistake, which the common retailers of character committed. Henry was
<PB N="67" REF="030623_0067_0FE83C3D68D717E8"/>
said to be wholly negligent, while William was reputed to be extremely fond, of the other sex: William indeed was gallant, was amorous, and indulged his inclination to the libertine society of women; but Henry it was who <HI>loved</HI> them. He admired them at a reverential distance, and felt so tender an affection for the virtuous part, that it shocked him to behold, much more to as∣sociate with the depraved and vicious.</P>
<P>In the advantages of person Henry was still superior to William, and yet the latter had no common share of those attractions which capti∣vate weak, thoughtless, or unskilful minds.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the time that Henry and Willi∣am quitted college and had arrived at their twen∣tieth year, the dean made the purchase of a small estate in a village near to the country residence of Lord and Lady Bendham; and in the total want of society, the dean's family were fre∣quently honoured with invitations from the great house.</P>
<P>Lord Bendham, besides a good estate, posses∣sed the office of a lord of the bed-chamber to his majesty. Historians do not ascribe much importance to the situation, or to the talents of
<PB N="68" REF="030623_0068_0FE83C3EF189A400"/>
nobles in this department, nor shall this little history. A lord of the bed-chamber is a per∣sonage well known in courts, and in all capitals where courts reside; with this advantage to the enquirer, that in becoming acquainted with one of those noble characters, you become acquain∣ted with all the remainder; not only with those of the same kingdom, but those of foreign na∣tions; for, in whatever land, in whatever cli∣mate, a lord of the bed-chamber must necessa∣rily be the self-same creature: one, wholly made up of observance, of obedience, of dependance, and of imitation—a borrowed character—a character formed by reflection.</P>
<P>The wife of this illustrious peer, as well as himself, took her hue, like the chameleon, from surrounding objects; her manners were not go∣verned by her mind, but were solely directed by external circumstances. At court, humble, re∣signed, patient, attentive—At balls, masque∣rades, gaming-tables, and routs, gay, sprightly and flippant—At her country seat, reserved, austere, arrogant, and gloomy.</P>
<P>Though in town her timid eye, in presence of certain persons, would scarce uplipft its trem∣bling lid, so much she felt her own insignifi∣cance; yet, in the country, till lady Clementi∣na arrived, there was not one being of conse∣quence
<PB N="69" REF="030623_0069_0FE83C46227E5E38"/>
enough to share in her acquaintance; and she paid back to her inferiors there, all the humiliating slights, and all the mortifications which in London she received from those to whom <HI>she</HI> was inferior.</P>
<P>Whether in town or country, it is but justice to acknowledge, that in her own person she was strictly chaste; but in the country she extended that chastity even to the person of others; and the young woman who lost her virtue in the village of Anfield, had better have lost her life. Some few were now and then found hanging or drowned, while no other cause could be assigned for their despair, than an imputation on their character, and dread of the harsh purity of La∣dy Bendham. She would remind the parish priest of the punishment ordained for female dis∣honour, and by her influence had caused many an unhappy girl to do public penance in their own or the neighbouring churches.</P>
<P>"But this country rigour, in town, she could dispense withal; and like other ladies of virtue, she there visited and received into her house the acknowledged mistresses of a man in elevated life; it was not therefore the crime, but the rank which the criminal held in society, that drew down Lady Bendham's vengeance: she even carried her distinction of classes in female

<P>Lord and Lady Bendham's birth, education, talents, and propensities, being much on the same scale of eminence, they would have been a very happy pair had not one great misfortune inter∣vened—The lady never bore her lord a child.—While every cottage of the village was cram∣med with half-starved children, whose father from week to week, from year to year, exerted his manly youth and wasted his strength in vain to protect them from hunger; whose mother mourned over her new-born infant as a little wretch, sent into the world to deprive the rest of what already was too scanty for them; in the castle that owned every cottage and all the sur∣rounding land, and where one single day of feas∣ting would have nourished for a month all the poor inhabitants of the parish, not one child was given to partake of the plenty. The curse of barrenness was on the family of the lord of the manor—the curse of fruitfulness upon the fa∣mished poor.</P>
<P>This lord and lady, with an ample fortune both by inheritance and their sovereign's favour,
<PB N="71" REF="030623_0071_0FE83C4EA98B19F0"/>
had never yet the economy to be exempt from debts; still, over their splendid, their pro∣fuse table, they could contrive and plan excel∣lent schemes "how the poor might live most comfortably with a little better management."</P>
<P>The wages of a labouring man with a wife and half a dozen small children, Lady Bend∣ham thought quite sufficient if they would only learn a little economy.</P>
<P>"You know, my lord, those people never want to dress—shoes and stockings, a coat and waistcoat, a gown and a cap, a petticoat and a handkerchief, is all they want—fire, to be sure, in winter—then all the rest is merely for pro∣vision."</P>
<P>"I'll get a pen and ink," said young Henry, (one day when he had the honour of being at their table) "and see what the <HI>rest</HI> amounts to."</P>
<P>"No, no accounts," cried my lord, "no sum∣ming up: but if you were to calculate, you must add to the receipts of the poor my gift at Christmas, last year, during the frost, no less than a hundred pounds,"</P>
<P>"How benevolent!" exclaimed the dean.</P>
<P>"How prudent!" exclaimed Henry.</P>
<P>"What do you mean by prudent?" asked Lord Bendham. "Explain your meaning."</P>
<P>"No, my lord," replied the dean, "do not
<PB N="72" REF="030623_0072_0FE83C502F89B550"/>
ask for an explanation: this youth is wholly unacquainted with our customs; and though a man in stature, is but a child in intellects. Hen∣ry have not I often cautioned you—"</P>
<P>"Whatever his thoughts are upon this sub∣ject," cried Lord Bendham, "I desire to know them."</P>
<P>"Why then, my lord," answered Henry, "I thought it was prudent in you to give a little; lest the poor, driven to despair, should take all."</P>
<P>"And if they had they would have been hanged."</P>
<P>"Hanging, my lord, our history, or some tra∣dition, says, was formerly adopted as a mild punishment in place of starving."</P>
<P>"I am sure," cried Lady Bendham, (who seldom spoke directly to the argument before her) "I am sure they ought to think themselves much obliged to us."</P>
<P>"That is the greatest hardship of all," cried Henry.</P>
<P>"What, sir?" exclaimed the earl.</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon—my uncle looks dis∣pleased—I am very ignorant—I did not receive my first education in this country—and I find I think so differently from every one else, that I am ashamed to utter my sentiments."</P>
<P>"Never mind, young man," answered Lord
<PB N="73" REF="030623_0073_0FE83C56E92BCF68"/>
Bendham: "we shall excuse your ignorance for once. Only inform us what it was you just now called, <HI>the greatest hardship of all.</HI>"</P>
<P>"It was, my lord, that what the poor re∣ceive to keep them from perishing, should pass under the name of <HI>gifts</HI> and <HI>bounty.</HI> Health, strength, and the will to earn a moderate sub∣sistence, ought to be every man's security from obligation."</P>
<P>"I think a hundred pounds a great deal of money," cried Lady Bendham, "and I hope my lord will never give it again."</P>
<P>"And so do I," cried Henry, "for if my lord would only be so good as to speak a few words for the poor as a senator, he might possi∣bly for the future keep his hundred pounds, and yet they never want it."</P>
<P>Lord Bendham had the good nature only to smile at Henry's simplicity, whispering to him∣self, "I had rather keep my—" His last word was lost in the whisper.</P>

<P>IN the country—where the sensible heart is still more susceptible of impressions; and where the unfeeling mind, in the want of other wits to invent, forms schemes for its own amusement—
<PB N="74" REF="030623_0074_0FE83C586F647A10"/>
our youths both fell in love; if passions that were pursued on the most opposite principles can receive the same appellation. William, well versed in all the licentious theory, thought himself in love, because he perceived a tumul∣tuous impulse cause his heart to beat, while his fancy fixed on a certain object, whose presence agitated yet more his breast.</P>
<P>Henry thought himself not in love, because, while he listened to William on the subject, he sound their sensations did not in the least agree.</P>
<P>William owned to Henry, that he loved Hannah, the daughter of a cottager in the vil∣lage, and hoped to make her his mistress.</P>
<P>Henry felt that his tender regard for Rebecca, the daughter of the curate of the parish, did not inspire him even with the boldness to acquaint her with his sentiments, much less to meditate one design that might tend to her dishonour.</P>
<P>While William was cautiously planning, how to meet in private, and accomplish the se∣duction of the object of his passion, Henry was endeavouring to fortify the object of <HI>his</HI> choice with every virtue. He never read a book from which he received improvement, that he did not carry it to Rebecca—never knew a circumstance that might assist towards her moral instruction, that he did not haste to tell it her—and once, when William boasted,</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="030623_0075_0FE83C5F6243BE68"/>
"He knew he was beloved by Hannah;"</P>
<P>Henry said, with equal triumph, "he had not dared to take the means to learn, nor had Re∣becca dared to give one instance of her partia∣lity."</P>
<P>Rebecca was the youngest, and by far the least handsome daughter of four, to whom the Reverend Mr. Rymer, a widower, was father. The other sisters were accounted beauties; and she, from her comparative want of personal charms, having been less beloved by her parents, and less caressed by those who visited them than the rest, had for some time past sought other re∣sources of happiness than the affection, praise, and indulgence of her fellow-creatures. She read—but more—she thought. The choicest books from her father's little library taught her to think; and reflection fashioned her mind to bear the slights, the mortifications of neglect, with a patient dejection, rather than with an in∣dignant or a peevish spirit.</P>
<P>This resignation to injury and contumely gave to her perfect symmetry of person, a timid eye, a retiring manner, and spread upon her face a placid sweetness, a pale serenity mixed with sense and taste, that no wife connoisseur in fe∣male charms would have exchanged for all the sparkling eyes and florid tints of her vain and
<PB N="76" REF="030623_0076_0FE83C60E9008948"/>
vulgar sisters.—Henry's soul was so much ena∣moured of her gentle deportment, that in his sight she appeared beautiful; while she, with an understanding competent to judge of his worth, was so greatly surprised, so prodigiously asto∣nished at the distinction, the attention, the ma∣ny offices of civility paid to her by him in pre∣ference to her idolised sisters, that her gratitude for such unexpected favours had sometimes (even in his presence, and in that of her family) nearly drowned her eyes with tears. Yet, they were only trifles, in which Henry had the opportunity or the power to give her testimony of his re∣gard—trifles, often more grateful to the sensi∣ble mind than efforts of high importance; and by which, the artist in the human heart will ac∣curately trace a passion, wholly concealed from the dull eye of the unskilled observer.</P>
<P>The first cause of amazement to Rebecca in the manners of Henry was, that he talked with <HI>her</HI> as well as with her sisters; no visitor else had done so. In taking a morning's or an even∣ing's walk, he proposed <HI>her</HI> going with the rest; no one had ever required her company before. When he called and she was absent, he asked where she was; no one had ever missed her be∣fore. She thanked him from her very heart, and soon perceived that at those times when he
<PB N="77" REF="030623_0077_0FE83C67E0AB7AC8"/>
was present, company was more pleasing even than books.</P>
<P>Her astonishment, her gratitude, did not stop here—Henry proceeded in attention—he soon selected her from her sisters to tell the news of the day when he chanced to call; answered her observations the first; once gave her a sprig of myrtle from his bosom in preference to another who had praised its beauty; and once—never to be forgotten kindness—sheltered her from a has∣ty shower with his <HI>parapluie,</HI> while he lamented to her drenched companions,</P>
<P>"That he had but <HI>one</HI> to offer."</P>
<P>From a man whose sense and person they ad∣mire, how dear, how impressive on the female heart is every trait of tenderness! Till now, Rebecca had experienced none; not even of the parental kind; and merely from the overflow∣ings of a kind nature (not in return for affec∣tion) had she ever loved her father and her sisters. Sometimes, repulsed by their severity, she trans∣ferred the fullness of an affectionate heart upon animals: but now, her alienated mind was re∣called and softened by a sensation that made her long to complain of the burthen it imposed—those obligations which exact silence, are a hea∣vy weight to the grateful—Rebecca longed to tell Henry, "that her life would be too little to
<PB N="78" REF="030623_0078_0FE83C69680A4650"/>
express the full sense she had of the respect he paid to her." But as modesty forbade not only every kind of declaration, but every insinuation purporting what she felt, she wept through sleepless nights from a load of suppressed expla∣nation; yet still she would not have exchanged this trouble, for all the beauty of her sisters.</P>

<P>OLD John and Hannah Primrose, a pru∣dent hardy couple, who, by many years of pecu∣liar labour and peculiar abstinence, were the least poor of all the neighbouring cottagers, had an only child called after the mother, Hannah: and this cottage girl was reckoned, in spite of the beauty of the elder Miss Rymers, by far the prettiest female in the village.</P>
<P>Reader of superior rank, if the passions which rage in the bosom of the inferior class of human kind are beneath your sympathy, throw aside this little history, for Rebecca Rymer and Han∣nah Primrose are its heroines.</P>
<P>But you, unprejudiced reader, whose liberal observations are not confined to stations, but who consider all mankind alike deserving your investigation; who believe that their exists in some, knowledge without the advantage of in∣struction;
<PB N="79" REF="030623_0079_0FE83C708A2D4538"/>
refinement of sentiment independent of elegant society; honourable pride of heart without dignity of blood; and genius destitute of art to render it conspicuous—<HI>You</HI> will, per∣haps, venture to read on; in hopes that the re∣mainder of this story may deserve your attention; just as the wild herb of the forest, equally with the cultivated plant in the garden, claims the attention of the botanist.</P>
<P>When young William saw Hannah, he thought her even more beautiful than she was thought by others; and on those days that he he felt no inclination to ride, to shoot, or to hunt, he would contrive, by some secret device, the means to meet with her alone, and give her tokens (if not of his love) at least of his admi∣ration of her beauty, and of the pleasure he en∣joyed in her company.</P>
<P>Hannah listened with a kind of delirious en∣chantment to all her elevated and eloquent ad∣mirer uttered; and in return for his praises of her charms, and his equivocal replies with re∣spect to his designs towards her, gave to him, her most undisguised thoughts, and her whole enraptured heart.</P>
<P>This, to her apparently harmless, intercourse had not lasted many weeks before she loved him—she even confessed she did, every time that
<PB N="80" REF="030623_0080_0FE83C7211097728"/>
any unwonted mark of attention from him, struck with unexpected force her infatuated senses.</P>
<P>It has been said by a celebrated writer, upon the affection subsisting between the two sexes, "that there are many persons who, if they had never heard of the passion of love, would never have felt it." Might it not with equal truth he added, that—there are many more, who having heard of it, and believing most firmly that they feel it, are nevertheless mistaken? Neither of these cases was the lot of Hannah. She experienced the sentiment before she ever heard it named in that sense in which she felt it—and she felt it as genuine love alone exists—joined with nu∣merous other sentiments: for love, however ra∣ted by many, as the chief passion of the human heart, is but a poor dependant, a retainer upon other passions; admiration, gratitude, respect, esteem, pride in the object—divest the boasted sensation of these, and it is no more than the impression of a twelve-month, by courtesy, or vulgar error, termed love.</P>
<P>Hannah was formed by the rarest structure of the human frame, and fated by the tenderest thrillings of the human soul, to inspire and to ex∣perience real love—but her nice taste, her deli∣cate thoughts, were so refined beyond the sphere
<PB N="81" REF="030623_0081_0FE83C78F6F273B8"/>
of her own station in society, that nature would have produced this prodigy of attraction in vain had not one of superior education and manners assailed her heart: and had she been accustom∣ed to the conversation of men in William's rank of life, she had, perhaps, treated William's ad∣dresses with indifference; but in comparing him with her familiar acquaintance, he was a mira∣cle! His unremitted attention seemed the con∣descension of a superior being, to whom she look∣ed up with reverence, with admiration, with awe, with pride, with sense of obligation—and all those various passions which constitute true, and <HI>never</HI> to be eradicated, love.</P>
<P>But in vain she felt and even avowed with her lips what every look, every gesture, had long denoted; William, with discontent, sometimes with anger, upbraided her for her false professi∣ons, and vowed, "That while one tender proof, which he fervently besought, was wanting, she did but aggravate his misery by lesser endear∣ments."</P>
<P>Hannah had been taught the full estimation of female virtue; and if her nature could have detested one being in a state of wretchedness, it would have been the woman who had lost her honour: yet, for William, what would not Hannah forfeit? The dignity, the peace, the se∣renity,
<PB N="82" REF="030623_0082_0FE83C7A822CCEF8"/>
the innocence of her own mind, love soon encouraged her to fancy she could easily forego—and this same overpowering influence at times so forcibly possessed her, that she even felt a mo∣mentary transport in the idea "of so precious a sacrifice to him." But then she loved her pa∣rents; and their happiness she could not prevail on herself to barter even for <HI>his.</HI> She wished he would demand some other pledge of her af∣fection; for there was none but this, her ruin in no other shape, that she would deny at his request. While thus she deliberated she prepa∣red for her fall.</P>
<P>Bred up with strict observance both to his moral and religious character, William did not dare to tell an unequivocal lie even to his infe∣riors—he never promised Hannah he would mar∣ry her; nay even, he paid so much respect to the forms of truth, that no sooner was it evi∣dent that he had obtained her heart, her whole soul entire—so that loss of innocence would be less terrifying than separation from him—no sooner did he perceive this, than he candidly told her he "could never make her his wife."—At the same time he lamented "the difference of their births, and the duty he owed his parents' hopes," in terms so pathetic to her partial ear, that she thought him a greater object of com∣passion
<PB N="83" REF="030623_0083_0FE83C7F0DA70690"/>
in love, even than herself; and was now urged by pity to remove the cause of his com∣plainings.</P>
<P>One evening Henry accidentally passed the lonely spot where William and she constantly met—he observed his cousin's impassioned eye, and her affectionate, yet fearful glance. Wil∣liam, he saw, took delight in the agitation of mind, in the strong apprehension mixed with the love of Hannah; this convinced Henry that either he, or himself, was not in love: for his heart told him he would not have beheld such emotions of tenderness mingled with such marks of sorrow, upon the countenance of Re∣becca, for the wealth of the universe.</P>
<P>The first time he was alone with William after this, he mentioned his observation on Han∣nah's apparent affliction, and asked "Why her grief was the result of thier stolen meetings?"</P>
<P>"Because," replied William, "her professi∣ons are unlimited, while her manners are reserv∣ed; and I accuse her of loving me with unkind moderation, while I love her to distraction."</P>
<P>"You design to marry her then?"</P>
<P>"How can you degrade me by the supposi∣tion?"</P>
<P>"Would it degrade you more to marry her than to make her your companion? To talk with her for hours in preference to all other
<PB N="84" REF="030623_0084_0FE83C81E7ADFD50"/>
company? To wish to be endeared to her by still closer ties?"</P>
<P>"But all this is not raising her to the rank of my wife."</P>
<P>"It is still raising her to that rank, for which wives alone were allotted."</P>
<P>"You talk wildly!—I tell you I love her; but not enough, I hope, to marry her."</P>
<P>"But too much, I hope, to undo her?"</P>
<P>"That must be her own free choice—I make use of no unwarrantable methods."</P>
<P>"What are the warrantable ones?"</P>
<P>"I mean, I have made her no false promises—offered no pretended settlement—vowed no eter∣nal constancy."</P>
<P>"But you have told her you love her; and, from that confession, has she not reason to ex∣pect every protection which even promises could secure?"</P>
<P>"I cannot answer for her expectations—but I know, if she should make me happy as I ask, and I should then forsake her, I shall not break my word.</P>
<P>"Still she will be deceived; for you will fal∣sify your looks."</P>
<P>"Do you think she depends on my looks?"</P>
<P>"I have read in some book, <HI>Looks are the lover's sole dependence.</HI>"</P>
<P>"I have no objection to her interpreting min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="85" REF="030623_0085_0FE83C8A161EFE90"/>
in her favour; but then for the consequences, she will have herself, and only herself to blame."</P>
<P>"Oh! heaven!"</P>
<P>"What makes you exclaim so vehemently?"</P>
<P>"An idea of the bitterness of that calamity which inflicts self-reproach! Oh rather deceive her—leave her the consolation to reproach <HI>you,</HI> rather than herself."</P>
<P>"My honour will not suffer me."</P>
<P>"Exert your honour, and never see her more."</P>
<P>"I cannot live without her."</P>
<P>"Then live with her by the laws of your country; and make her, and yourself both happy."</P>
<P>"Am I to make my father and my mother miserable? They would disown me for such a step."</P>
<P>"Your mother, perhaps, might be offended, but your father could not. Remember the ser∣mon he preached but last Sunday, upon—<HI>the shortness of this life: contempt of all riches and worldly honours in balance with a quiet con∣science</HI>—and the assurance he gave us—<HI>that the greatest happiness enjoyed upon earth, was under an humble roof with heaven in prospect.</HI>"</P>
<P>"My father is a very good man," said Wil∣liam, "and yet, instead of being satisfied with an humble roof, he looks impatiently forward to a bishop's palace."</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="030623_0086_0FE83C8B9C41A868"/>
"He is so very good then," said Henry, "that perhaps, seeing the dangers to which men in exalted stations are exposed, he has such ex∣treme philanthropy, and so little self-love, he would rather that himself should brave those perils incidental to wealth and grandeur, than any other person."</P>
<P>"You are not yet civilised," said William; "and to argue with you, is but to instruct, without gaining instruction."</P>
<P>"I know, Sir," replied Henry, "that you are studying the law most assiduously, and have vast prospects of rising to eminence in your profession: but let me hint to you—that though you may be perfect in the knowledge how to administer the commandments of men, unless you keep in view the precepts of God, your judgment, like mine, will be fallible."</P>

<P>THE dean's family passed this first summer at the new purchased estate so pleasantly, that they left it with regret when winter called them to their house in town.</P>
<P>But if some felt concern on quitting the vil∣lage of Anfield, some who were left behind felt the deepest anguish. Those were not the poor; for rigid attention to the morals of people in
<PB N="87" REF="030623_0087_0FE83C925D47BE28"/>
poverty, and total neglect of their bodily wants, was the dean's practice. He forced them to at∣tend church on every sabbath; but whether they had a dinner on their return, was too gross and temporal an enquiry for his spiritual fervour. Good of the <HI>soul</HI> was all he aimed at; and this pious undertaking, besides his diligence as a pas∣tor, required all his exertion as a magistrate—for to be very poor and very honest, very oppres∣sed, yet very thankful, is a degree of sainted ex∣cellence not to be attained without the aid of zealous men to frighten into virtue.</P>
<P>Those then, who alone felt sorrow at the dean's departure, were two young women, whose parents, exempt from indigence, preser∣ved them from suffering under his unpitying piety; but whose discretion had not protected them from the bewitching smiles of his nephew, and seducing wiles of his son.</P>
<P>The first morning that Rebecca rose and knew Henry was gone till the following summer, she wished she could have lain down again and slept away the whole long interval. Her sisters' peevishness, her father's austerity, she foresaw would be insupportable now that she had expe∣rienced Henry's kindness, and he was no longer near to fortify her patience. She sighed—she wept—she was unhappy.</P>
<P>But if Rebecca awoke with a dejected mind
<PB N="88" REF="030623_0088_0FE83C93E128E828"/>
and an aching heart, what were the sorrows of Hannah? The only child of two doating parents, she never had been taught the necessity of resig∣nation—untutored, unread, unused to reflect, but knowing how to <HI>feel;</HI> what were her suf∣ferings when, on waking, she called to mind that "William was gone," and with him gone all that excess of happiness which his presence had bestowed, and for which she had exchanged her future tranquillity.</P>
<P>Loss of tranquillity even Rebecca had to be∣moan—Hannah had still more—the loss of in∣nocence!</P>
<P>Had William remained in the village, shame, even conscience perhaps had slept; but separated from her betrayer, parted from the joys of guilt, and left only to its sorrows, every sting which quick sensibility could sharpen, was transfixed in her heart to torture her. First came the recollec∣tion of a cold farewell from the man whose love she had hoped her yielding passion had forever won—next, flashed on her thoughts her viola∣ted person—next, the crime incurred—next, her cruelty to her tender parents—and last of all came the horrors of detection.</P>
<P>She knew that as yet, by wariness, care, and contrivance, her meetings with William had been unsuspected; but in this agony of mind her fears foreboaded an informer who would
<PB N="89" REF="030623_0089_0FE83C9AA8FE4EF8"/>
defy all caution; who would stigmatise her with a name—dear and desired by every virtuous fe∣male—abhorrent to the blushing harlot—the name of mother.</P>
<P>That Hannah, thus impressed, could rise from her bed, meet her parents and her neighbours with her usual smile of vivacity, and voice of mirth, was impossible—to leave her bed at all, to creep down stairs, and reply in a faint broken voice to questions asked, were, in her state of mind, mighty efforts; and all to which her struggles could attain for many weeks.</P>
<P>William had promised to write to her while he was away: he kept his word; but not till the end of two months she received a letter.—Fears for his health, apprehension of his death during this cruel interval, caused an agony of suspense that, by representing him to her distrac∣ted fancy in a state of suffering, made him, if possible, still dearer to her. In the excrutiating anguish of uncertainty, she walked with trem∣bling steps through all weathers (when she could steal half a day while her parents were employed in labour abroad) to the post town, at six miles distance, to enquire for his long ex∣pected, long wished for letter. When at last it was given to her, that moment of consola∣tion seemed to repay her for the whole time of agonising terror she had endured. "He is alive!" she said, "and I have suffered nothing."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="030623_0090_0FE83C9C30436860"/>
She hastily put this token of his health and his remembrance of her into her bosom, rich as an empress with a new-acquired dominion. The way from home, which she had trod with heavy pace, in the fear of renewed disappointment, she skimmed along on her return swift as a doe—the cold did not pierce, neither did the rain wet her.—Many a time she put her hand upon the prize she possessed, to find if it were safe—once, on the road, she took it from her bosom, curious∣ly viewed the seal and the direction, then replac∣ing it, did not move her fingers from their fast gripe, till she arrived at home.</P>
<P>Her father and her mother were still absent. She drew a chair, and placing it near to the on∣ly window in the room, seated herself with ce∣remonious order; and then, gently drew forth her treasure; laid it on her knee; and with a smile that almost amounted to a laugh of glad∣ness, once more inspected the outward part, be∣fore she would trust herself with the excessive joy of looking within.</P>
<P>At length the seal was broken—but the con∣tents still a secret. Poor Hannah had learned to write as some youths learn Latin; so short a time had been allowed for the acquirement, and so little expert had been her master, that it took her generally a week to write a letter of ten lines, and a month to read one of twenty.
<PB N="91" REF="030623_0091_0FE83CA36130CF98"/>
But this being a letter on which her mind was deeply engaged, her whole imagination aided her slender literature, and at the end of a fort∣night she had made out every word.—They were these,</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Hannah,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE you have been well since we par∣ted—I have been very well myself, but I have been teazed with a great deal of business, which has not given me time to write to you before—I have been called to the bar, which engages every spare moment—but I hope it will not pre∣vent my coming down to Anfield with my fa∣ther in the summer.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, <SALUTE>dear Hannah,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>With gratitude for all the favours you have conferred on me, Yours, &amp;c. W. N.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>To have beheld the illiterate Hannah try for two weeks, day and night, to find out the exact words of this letter, it would have struck the spectator with amazement to have understood the right, the delicate, the nicely proper sensa∣tions with which she was affected by every sen∣tence it contained.</P>
<P>She wished it had been kinder, even for his sake who wrote it—because she thought so well of him, and desired still to think so well, that
<PB N="92" REF="030623_0092_0FE83CA4E7D3E858"/>
she was sorry at any faults that rendered him less worthy of her good opinion. The cold ci∣vility of his letter had this effect—her clear, her acute judgment felt it a kind of prevarication <HI>to promise to write—and then write nothing that was hoped for.</HI> But enthralled by the magic of her passion, she shortly found excuses for the man she loved, at the expense of her own con∣demnation:</P>
<P>"He has only the fault of inconstancy," she cried, "and that has been caused by <HI>my</HI> change of conduct—had I been virtuous still, he had still been affectionate." Bitter thought!</P>
<P>Yet there was a sentence in the letter, that worse than all the tenderness left out, wounded her sensibility—and she could not read the line, <HI>gratitude for all the favours conferred on me,</HI> without turning pale with horror, then kindling with indignation at the common-place thanks which insultingly reminded her of her innocence, her peace of mind, given in exchange for un∣meaning acknowledgement.</P>

for Henry's real love encreased, while William's turbulent passion declined in separation: yet had the latter not so much abated that he did not perceive a sensation, like a sudden shock of sorrow, on a proposal made him by his father, of entering the marriage state with a young wo∣man, the dependent niece of Lady Bendham; who, as the dean informed him, had signified her lord's and her own approbation of his becoming their nephew.</P>
<P>At the first moment William received this intimation from his father, his heart revolted with disgust from the object, and he instantly thought upon Hannah with more affection than he had done for many weeks before. This was from the comparison between her and his pro∣posed wife; for he had frequently seen Miss Sedgeley at Lord Bendham's, but had never seen in her whole person or manners, the least attrac∣tion to excite his love. He pictured to himself an unpleasant home, with a companion so little sui∣ted to his taste, and felt a pang of conscience, as well as of attachment, in the thought of giving up poor Hannah.</P>
<P>But these reflections, these feelings lasted no longer than for the moment: no sooner had the dean explained why the marriage was desira∣ble, recited what great connections, and what great patronage it would confer upon their fa∣mily,
<PB N="94" REF="030623_0094_0FE83CAD4BD49468"/>
than William listened with eagerness, and both his love and his conscience were, if not wholly quieted, at least for the present hushed.</P>
<P>Immediately after the dean had expressed to Lord and Lady Bendham his son's "sense of the honour and the happiness conferred on him by their condescension in admitting him a mem∣ber of their noble family"—Miss Sedgeley re∣ceived from her aunt, nearly the same shock as William had done from his father. <HI>For she had frequently seen the dean's son at lord Bendham's, but had never seen in his whole person or man∣ners the least attraction to excite her love—she pictured to herself an unpleasant home with a companion so little suited to her taste:</HI> and at this moment she felt a more than usual partiality to the dean's nephew, finding the secret hope she had long indulged, of winning his affections, so near being thwarted.</P>
<P>But Miss Sedgeley was too much subjected to the power of her uncle and aunt to have a will of her own, at least, to dare to utter it. She received the commands of Lady Bendham with her accustomed submission, while all the consolation for the grief they gave her was, "that she resolved to make a very bad wife."</P>
<P>"I shall not care a pin for my husband," she said to herself, "and so I will dress and vi∣sit, and do just as I like—he dares not be un∣kind
<PB N="95" REF="030623_0095_0FE83CB41E6CB240"/>
because of my aunt.—Besides, now I think again, it is not so disagreeable to marry <HI>him</HI> as if I were obliged to marry into any other family, because I shall see his cousin Henry as often, if not oftener, than ever."</P>
<P>For Miss Sedgeley, with a person he did not like, and with a mind thus disposed, William began to force himself to shake off every little re∣maining affection, even all pity, for the unfortu∣nate, the beautiful, the sensible, the doating Han∣nah; and determined to place in a situation to look down with scorn upon her sorrows, this weak, this unprincipled woman.</P>
<P>Connections, interest, honours, were powerful advocates—his private happiness William deem∣ed trivial, compared to public opinion—and to be under obligations to a peer, his wife's relation, gave greater renown, in his servile mind, than all the advantages that might accrue from his own intrinsic independent worth.</P>
<P>In the usual routine of pretended regard, and real indifference, sometimes disgust, between parties allied by what is falsely termed <HI>prudence,</HI> the intended union of Mr. Norwynne with Miss Sedgeley proceeded in all due form; and at their country seats at Anfield, during the summer, their nuptials were appointed to be celebrated.</P>
<P>William was now introduced into all Lord Bendham's courtly circles—his worldly soul was
<PB N="96" REF="030623_0096_0FE83CB5A5E89700"/>
entranced in glare and show—he thought of no∣thing but places, pensions, titles, retinues:—and stedfast, alert, unshaken in the pursuit of honours, neglected not the lesser means of rising to pre∣ferment—his own endowments. But in this round of attention to pleasures and to study, he no more complained to Hannah of "excess of business." Cruel as she had once thought that letter in which he thus apologised for neglecting her, she at last began to think it was wonderous kind; for he never found time to send her ano∣ther. Yet she had studied with all her most anxious care to write him an answer; such a one as might not lesson her understanding, which he had often praised, in his esteem.</P>
<P>Ah William! even with less anxiety your beating ambitious heart panted for the admira∣tion of an attentive auditory, when you first ven∣tured to harrangue in public!—With far less hope and fear (great as yours were) did you first address a crowded court, and thirst for its appro∣bation on your efforts, than Hannah sighed for your approbation, when she took a pen and awkwardly scrawled over a sheet of paper. Near twenty times she began—but to a gentleman—and one she loved like William—what could she dare to say? Yet she had enough to tell, if shame had not interposed—or, if remaining con∣fidence in his affection had but encouraged her.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="030623_0097_0FE7ECE46A984C00"/>
Overwhelmed by the first, and deprived of the last, her hand shook, her head drooped, and she dared not communicate what she knew must in∣inevitably render her letter unpleasing and still more depreciate her in his regard as the occasion of incumbrance; and of injury to his moral re∣putation.</P>
<P>Her free, her liberal, her venturous spirit sub∣dued, intimidated by the force of affection, she only wrote—</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>SUMMER arrived—and lords and ladies who had partaken of all the dissipation of the town, whom opera-houses, gaming-houses, and various other houses had detained whole nights from their peaceful home, were now poured forth from the metropolis, to imbibe the wholesome air of the farmer and peasant, and disseminate in return mo∣ral and religious principles.</P>
<P>Among the rest, Lord and Lady Bendham, strenuous opposers of vice in the poor, and gen∣tle supporters of it in the rich, never played at cards, or had concerts on a Sunday, in the vil∣lage, where the poor were spies—<HI>he</HI> there never gamed, or drank, except in private—and <HI>she</HI> ba∣nished from her doors every female of sullied cha∣racter. Yet poverty and ideotism are not the same—the poor can hear, can talk, sometimes can reflect—servants will tell their equals how they live in town—listeners will smile and shake their heads—and thus, hypocrisy, instead of culti∣vating, destroys every seed of moral virtue.</P>
<P>The arrival of Lord Bendham's family at An∣field, announced to the village that the dean's would quickly follow. Rebecca's heart boun∣ded with joy at the prospect—Poor Hannah felt a sinking, a foreboding tremor, that wholly in∣terrupted the joy of <HI>her</HI> expectations—She had
<PB N="99" REF="030623_0099_0FE83CD64F93ABC0"/>
not heard from William for five tedious months—she did not know whether he loved or despised—whether he thought of, or had forgotten her. Her reason argued against the hope that he loved her—yet hope still subsisted—she would not aban∣don herself to despair while there was doubt—she "had frequently been deceived from the appear∣ance of circumstances, and perhaps he might come all kindness—perhaps—even not like her the less for that indisposition which had changed her bloom to paleness, and the sparkling of her eyes to a pensive langour."</P>
<P>Henry's sensations on his return to Anfield were the self-same as Rebecca's were: sympathy in thought, sympathy in affection, sympathy in virtue, made them so. As he approached near the little village, he felt more light than usual. He had committed no trespass there, dreaded no one's reproach or enquiries, but his arrival might prove, at least to one object, the cause of rejoicing.</P>
<P>William's sensations were the reverse of these. In spite of his ambition, and the flattering view of accomplishing all to which it aspired, he often, as they proceeded on their journey, envied the gaiety of Henry, and felt an inward monitor, that told him, "he must first act like Henry, to be as happy."</P>
<P>His intended marriage was still, to the fami∣lies of both parties, (except to the heads of the
<PB N="100" REF="030623_0100_0FE83DC5CEAF2F90"/>
houses) a profound secret. Neither the servants, nor even Henry had received the slightest intima∣tion of the designed alliance; and this to Willi∣am was matter of some comfort.</P>
<P>When men submit to act in contradiction to their principles, nothing is so precious as a secret. In their estimation, to have their conduct <HI>known</HI> is the essential mischief—while it is hid, they fan∣cy the sin but half committed; and to the moie∣ty of a crime, they reconcile their feelings, till, in progression, the whole, when disclosed, appears tri∣vial. He designed that Hannah should receive the news from himself by degrees, and in such a manner as to console her, or at least to silence her complaints: and with a wish to soften the some∣thing like regret, which he still felt on the pru∣dent necessity of yielding her up when his marri∣age should take place, he promised to himself some intervening hours of private meetings, which he hoped would produce satiety.</P>
<P>While Henry flew to Mr. Rymer's house with a conscience clear, and a face enlightened with gladness; while he met Rebecca with open-hear∣ted friendship and frankness that charmed her soul to peaceful happiness; William skulked around the cottage of Hannah, dreading detection; and when towards midnight he found the means to obtain the company of the sad inhabitant, he grew so impatient at her tears and sobs, at the delicacy
<PB N="101" REF="030623_0101_0FE83CD7EC644DB8"/>
with which she with-held her caresses, that he burst into bitter upbraidings at her coyness; and at length (without discovering the cause of her peculiar agitation and reserve) abruptly left her, knowing "never to see her more."</P>
<P>As he turned away, his heart even congratu∣lated him, "that he had made so discreet a use of his momentary disappointment, as thus to shake her off at once without farther explanation or ex∣cuse."</P>
<P>She, ignorant and illiterate as she was, knew enough of her own heart to judge of his, and to know, that such violent affections and expres∣sions, above all, such a sudden, heart-breaking, manner of departure, were not the effects of love: not even of humanity. She felt herself debased by a ruffian—yet still, having loved him when she thought him otherwise, the blackest proof of the deception could not erase a sentiment, formed while she was deceived.</P>
<P>She passed the remainder of the night in an∣guish—but with the cheerful morning some cheerly thoughts arose. She thought "perhaps William by this time had found himself to blame—had conceived the cause of her grief and her distant behaviour, and had pitied her."</P>
<P>The next evening she waited with anxious heart for the signal that had called her out the foregoing night—in vain she watched, counted
<PB N="102" REF="030623_0102_0FE83E0962E453C8"/>
the hours, and the stars, and listened to the right∣ly stillness of the fields around: they were not disturbed by the tread of her lover.—Day-light came; the sun rose in its splendour; William had not been near her, and it shone upon none so mi∣serable as Hannah.</P>
<P>She now considered his word, "never to see her more," as solemnly passed—she heard anew the impressive, the implacable tone in which the sen∣tence was pronounced; and could look back on no late token of affection, on which to found the slightest hope that he would recall it.</P>
<P>Still, reluctant to despair—in the extremity of grief, in the extremity of fear for an ap∣proaching crisis that must speedily arrive, she (after a few days had elapsed) trusted a neigh∣bouring peasant with a letter to deliver to Mr. Norwynne in private.</P>
<P>This letter, unlike the last, was dictated with∣out the hope to please—no pains were taken with the style, no care in the formation of the letters—the words flowed from necessity; strong ne∣cessity guided her hand.</P>

<P>WHEN the dean's family had been at An∣field about a month—one misty morning, such as portends a sultry day, as Henry was walking swiftly through a thick wood on the skirts of the parish, he suddenly started on hearing a distant groan, expressive, as he thought, both of bodily and mental pain.—He stopped to hear it repeated that he might pursue the sound. He heard it a∣gain; and though now but in murmurs, yet as the tone implied excessive grief, he directed his course to that part of the wood from whence it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he advanced, in spite of the thick fog, he
<PB N="104" REF="030623_0104_0FE83D2D82B2A898"/>
discerned the appearance of a female scudding away on his approach. His eye was fixed on this object; and regardless where he placed his feet, soon he shrunk back with horror, on per∣ceiving they had nearly trod upon a new-born infant, lying on the ground!—a lovely male child entered on a world where not one preparation had been made to receive him.</P>
<P>"Ah!" cried Henry, forgetting the person who had sled, and with a smile of compassion on the helpless infant, "I am glad I have found you—you give more joy to me, than you have done to your hapless parents. Poor dear," (continued he, while he took off his coat to wrap it in,) "I will take care of you while I live—I will beg for you rather than you shall want—but first, I will carry you to those who at present can do more for you than myself."</P>
<P>Thus Henry said and thought while he inclos∣ed the child carefully in his coat, and took it in his arms. But about to walk his way with it, an unlucky query struck him, <HI>where he should go.</HI></P>
<P>"I must not take it to the dean's," he cried, "because Lady Clementina will suspect it is not nobly, and my uncle will suspect it is not law∣fully born. Nor must I take it to Lord Bend∣ham's for the self-same reason—though could it call Lady Bendham mother, this whole village, nay the whole country round would ring with re∣joicings
<PB N="105" REF="030623_0105_0FE83DCF88BEF7C8"/>
for his birth. How strange!" continu∣nued he, "that we should make so little of hu∣man creatures, that one sent among us, wholly independent of his own high value, becomes a curse instead of a blessing by the mere accident of worthless circumstances."</P>
<P>He now, after walking out of the wood, peep∣ed through the folds of his coat to look again at his charge—He started, turned pale, and trem∣bled to behold what, in the surprise of first seeing the child, had escaped his observation. Around its little throat was a cord entwined by a slipping noose, and drawn half way—as if the trembling hand of the murderer had revolted from its dread∣ful office, and he or she had left the infant to pine away with nakedness and hunger, rather than <HI>see</HI> it die.</P>
<P>Again Henry wished himself joy of the trea∣sure he had found; and more fervently than be∣fore; for he had not only preserved one fellow creature from death, but another from murder.</P>
<P>Once more he looked at his charge, and was transported to observe, upon its serene brow and sleepy eye, no traces of the dangers it had passed—no trait of shame either for itself or its parents—no discomposure at the unwelcome reception it was likely to encounter from a proud world!—He now slipped the fatal string from its neck; and by this affectionate disturbance causing the
<PB N="106" REF="030623_0106_0FE83DB50827BCF0"/>
child to cry, he ran (but he scarce knew whither) to convey it to a better nurse.</P>
<P>He at length found himself at the door of his dear Rebecca—for so very happy Henry felt at the good luck which had befallen him, that he longed to bestow a part of the blessing upon her he loved.</P>
<P>He sent for her privately out of the house to speak to him.—When she came,</P>
<P>"Rebecca," said he (looking around that no one observed him) "Rebecca, I have brought you something you will like."</P>
<P>"What is it?" she asked.</P>
<P>"You know, Rebecca, that you love deserted birds, strayed kittens, and motherless lambs—I have brought something more pitiable than any of these. Go, get a cap and a little gown, and then I will give it you."</P>
<P>"A gown!" exclaimed Rebecca. "If you have brought me a monkey, much as I should esteem any present from <HI>you,</HI> indeed I cannot touch it."</P>
<P>"A monkey!" repeated Henry, almost in anger—then changing the tone of his voice, ex∣claimed in triumph,</P>
<P>"It is child!"</P>
<P>On this he gave it a gentle pinch, that its cry might confirm the pleasing truth he spoke.</P>
<P>"A child!" repeated Rebecca in amaze.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="030623_0107_0FE7ED4EAF146DE0"/>
"Yes, and indeed I found it."</P>
<P>"Found it."</P>
<P>"Indeed I did. The mother, I fear, had just forsaken it."</P>
<P>"Inhuman creature!"</P>
<P>"Nay, hold Rebecca! I am sure you will pity her when you see her child—you then will know she must have loved it—and will consider how much she certainly had suffered, before she left it to perish in a wood."</P>
<P>"Cruel!" once more exclaimed Rebecca.</P>
<P>"Oh! Rebecca, perhaps, had she possessed a home of her own, she would have given it the best place in it—had she possessed money, she would have dressed it with the nicest care—or had she been accustomed to disgrace, she would have glo∣ried in calling it hers! But now, as it is, it is sent to us, to you and me, Rebecca, to take care of."</P>
<P>Rebecca, soothed by Henry's compassionate eloquence, held out her arms and received the important parcel—and, as she kindly looked in upon the little stranger,</P>
<P>"Now are not you much obliged to me," said Henry, "for having brought it to you? I know no one but yourself to whom I would have trusted it with pleasure."</P>
<P>"Much obliged to you," repeated Rebecca with a very serious face, "if I did but know
<PB N="108" REF="030623_0108_0FE7ECF527FDEA40"/>
what to do with it—where to put it—where to hide it from my father and sisters."</P>
<P>"Oh! any where," returned Henry—"It is very good—It will not cry—But if they should discover it, they will take it from you, prosecute the wretched mother, and send the child to the workhouse."</P>
<P>"I will do all I can;" replied Rebecca, "and I know I can take milk from the dairy, and bread from the pantry, without its being missed, or my father much the poorer.—But if it should cry—"</P>
<P>That instant they were interrupted by the ap∣pearance of the stern curate at a little distance—Henry was obliged to run swiftly away, while Rebecca returned by stealth into the house with her innocent burthen.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a word in the vocabulary more bitter, more direful in its import than all the rest.—Reader, if poverty, if disgrace, if bodily pain, e∣ven if slighted love is your unhappy fate, kneel and bless heaven for its beneficent influence, so that you are not tortured with the anguish of—<HI>remorse.</HI></P>
<P>Deep contrition for past offences had long been the punishment of unhappy Hannah; but till the day she brought her child into the world, <HI>remorse</HI> had been averted. From that day life became an insupportable load, for all reflection was torture! To think—merely to think, was to suffer excruciating agony—yet, never before was <HI>thought</HI> so intrusive—it haunted her in eve∣ry spot, in all societies—sleep was no shelter—she never slept but her racking dreams told her—"she had slain her infant."</P>
<P>They presented to her view the naked inno∣cent whom she had longed to press to her bosom while she lifted up her hand against its life—they
<PB N="4" REF="030623_0111_0FE83DEFC9E24218"/>
laid before her the smiling babe whom her eye∣balls strained to behold once more, while her feet hurried her away forever.</P>
<P>Often had Hannah, by the winter's fire, lis∣tened to tales of ghosts—of the unceasing sting of a guilty conscience—often had she shud∣dered at the recital of murders—often ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she wept over the story of the innocent put to death; and stood aghast that the human mind could per∣petrate the heinous crime of assassination!</P>
<P>From the tenderest passion the most savage im∣pulse may arise—In the deep recesses of fondness, sometimes is implanted the root of cruelty—and from loving William with unbounded lawless affection, she found herself depraved so as to be∣come the very object that could most of all excite her own horror!</P>
<P>Still at delirious intervals, that passion, which, like a fatal talisman had enchanted her whole soul, held out the delusive prospect that—"Wil∣liam might yet relent"—for though she had for∣ever discarded the idea of peace, she could not force herself to think, but that again blest with his society she should, at least for the time that he was present, taste the sweet cup of "forgetful∣ness of the past," for which she so ardently thirsted.</P>
<P>"Should he return to me," she thought in those paroxysms of delusion, "I would to <HI>him</HI> unbosom all my guilt; and as a remote, a kind
<PB N="5" REF="030623_0112_0FE83DF15092C858"/>
of innocent accomplice in my crime, his sense, his arguments, ever ready in making light of my sins, might afford a respite to my troubled conscience."</P>
<P>While thus she unwittingly thought, and some∣times watched through the night, starting with convulsed rapture at every found, because it might possibly be the harbinger of him; <HI>he</HI> was busied in carefully looking over marriage articles, fix∣ing the place of residence with his destined bride, or making love to her in formal process.—Yet, Hannah, vaunt—he sometimes thought on thee—he could not witness the folly, the weakness, the vanity, the selfishness of his future wife, with∣out frequently comparing her with thee. When equivocal words, and prevaricating sentences fell from her lips, he remembered with a sigh thy can∣dour—that open sincerity which dwelt upon thy tongue, and seemed to vie with thy undisguised features, to charm the listener even beyond the spectator. While Miss Sedgeley eagerly grasp∣ed at all the presents he offered, he could not but call to mind "that Hannah's declining hand was always closed, and her looks forbidding, every time he proffered such disrespectful tokens of his love. He recollected the softness that beamed from Hannah's eyes, the blush on her face at his approach, while he could never discern one glance of tenderness from the niece of Lord Bendham:
<PB N="6" REF="030623_0113_0FE83D3211EEE1A0"/>
and the artificial bloom on her cheeks was near∣ly as disgusting, as the ill-conducted artifice with which she attempted gentleness and love.</P>
<P>But all these impediments were only observed as trials of his fortitude—his prudence could o∣vercome his aversion, and thus he valued himself upon his manly firmness.</P>
<P>'Twas now, that having rid himself, by Han∣nah's peevishness, most honourably of all future ties to her; and the day of his marriage with Miss Sedgeley being fixed, that Henry, with the rest of the house, learnt, what to them, was news.—The first dart of Henry's eye upon William when, in his presence, he was told of it, caused a reddening on the face of the latter: he always fan∣cied Henry saw his thoughts, and he knew that Henry in return would give him <HI>his.</HI> On the present occasion, no sooner were they alone, and Henry began to utter them, than William char∣ged him,</P>
<P>"Not to dare to proceed; for that, too long accustomed to trifle, the time was come when se∣rious matters could alone employ his time; and when men of approved sense must take place of friends and confidents like him."</P>
<P>Henry replied, "The love, the sincerity of friends, I thought, were their best accomplish∣ments; those I possess."</P>
<P>"But you do not possess knowledge."</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030623_0114_0FE83D9C51BDDAD8"/>
"If that is knowledge which has of late estran∣ged you from all who bear you a sincere affec∣tion; which imprints every day more and more upon your features the marks of gloomy in∣quietude, am I not happier in my ignorance?"</P>
<P>"Do not torment me with you ineffectual reasoning."</P>
<P>"I called at the cottage of poor Hannah the other day," returned Henry: "her father and mo∣ther were eating their homely meal alone; and when I asked for their daughter, they wept and said—Hannah was not the girl she had been."</P>
<P>William cast his eyes on the floor.</P>
<P>Henry proceeded—"They said a sickness, which they feared would bring her to the grave, had preyed upon her for some time past. They had procured a doctor, but no remedy was found, and they feared the worst."</P>
<P>"What worst?" cried William, (now reco∣vered from the effect of the sudden intelligence, and attempting a smile) "Do they think she will die? And do you think it will be for love? We do not hear of these deaths often, Henry."</P>
<P>"And if <HI>she</HI> die, who will hear of <HI>that?</HI> No one but those interested to conceal the cause: And thus it is, that dying for love becomes a phenomenon."</P>
<P>Henry would have pursued the discourse far∣ther, but William, impatient on all subjects, ex∣cept
<PB N="8" REF="030623_0115_0FE83E1C6143AFA0"/>
where his argument was the better, retired from the controversy, crying out, "I know my duty, and want no instructor."</P>
<P>It would be unjust to William to say, he did not feel for Hannah's reported illness—he felt, dur∣ing that whole evening, and part of the next mor∣ning—but business, pleasures, new occupations, and new schemes of future success, crowded to dissipate all unwelcome reflections; and he trus∣ted in her youth, her health, her animal spirits, and above all, in the folly of the gossips' story of <HI>dying for love,</HI> as a surety for her life, and a safe∣guard for his conscience.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>THE child of William and Hannah was se∣creted by Rebecca in her own chamber, a garret, and at some distance from where her sisters slept. There she administered to all its wants, viewed almost with the joy of a mother its health, its promised life; and in a short time found she loved her little gift, better than any thing on earth, except the giver.</P>
<P>Henry called the next day, and the next, and many succeeding times, in hopes of an opportu∣nity to speak alone with Rebecca, to enquire concerning her charge, and consult when, and how, he could privately relieve her from her
<PB N="9" REF="030623_0116_0FE83E0AE89626E8"/>
trust; as he now meant to procure a nurse for wages. In vain he called or lurked around the house—for near five weeks all the conversation he could obtain with her was in the company of her sisters, who beginning to observe his prefer∣ence, his marked attention to her, indulged their envy and resentment at the contempt shown to their charms, by watching her steps when he was away, and her every look and whisper while he was present.</P>
<P>For five weeks, then, he was continually thwarted in his expectation of meeting her alone; and at the end of that period, the whole design he had to accomplish by such a meeting, was ren∣dered abortive.</P>
<P>Though Rebecca had every day and night with strictest caution locked her bed-chamber door, and covered the crevices, and every aper∣ture of her room through which sound might more easily proceed; though she had surrounded the infant's head with pillows to obstruct all noise from his crying, yet one unlucky night, the strength of his voice encreasing with his age, he was heard by the maid who slept in the opposite garret.</P>
<P>Not meaning to injure her young mistress, the servant next morning simply related to the fami∣ly what sounds had struck her ear during the night; but from what part of the house they
<PB N="10" REF="030623_0117_0FE83E2CF71CA480"/>
came, she would not undertake directly to say.—At first she was ridiculed "for supposing her∣self awake when in reality she must be dream∣ing." But stedfastly persisting in what she had said, and Rebecca's confusion giving much colour to the improbable tale, her chamber was searched by her sisters, the infant discovered, and brought down to their father.</P>
<P>That account which Henry had given Rebec∣ca "of his having found the child," and which her own sincerity, joined to the faith she had in his word, made her receive as truth; she now felt would be heard by the present auditors with contempt, even with indignation, as a falsehood. Her affright is better to be conceived than de∣scribed.</P>
<P>Dragged by her sisters along with the child before the curate, his crimsoned face, knit brow, and thundering voice, struck with terror her very soul—Innocence is not always a protection a∣gainst fear—sometimes less bold than guilt.</P>
<P>In her father and sisters, she saw, she knew the suspicious, partial, cruel, boisterous natures by whom she was to be judged; and timid, gen∣tle, oppressed; she fell trembling on her knees, and could only articulate,</P>
<P>"Forgive me."</P>
<P>The curate would not listen to this supplica∣tion till she had replied to his question—"Whose child is this?"</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030623_0118_0FE83D6182C90728"/>
She replied, "I do not know."</P>
<P>Questioned louder, and with more violence still, "How the child came there, and whose it was?" she felt the improbability of the truth still more forcibly than before, and dreaded some im∣mediate peril from her father's rage, should she dare to relate an apparent lie—she paused to think on a more probable tale than the real one—and as she hesitated, shook in every limb—while her fa∣ther exclaimed—</P>
<P>"I understand the cause of this terror!—From your infancy I predicted that some fatal catastro∣phe would befall you—I never loved you like my other children—I never had the cause—you were always unlike the rest—and I knew your fate would be calamitous—but the very worst of my forebodings did not come to this—so young, so guilty, and so artful!—tell me this instant, are you married?"</P>
<P>Rebecca answered, "No."</P>
<P>The sisters lifted up their hands!</P>
<P>The father continued—"Vile prostitute, I thought as much.—Still I will know the father of this child."</P>
<P>She cast up her eyes to heaven, and firmly vowed she "did not know herself—nor who the mother was."</P>
<P>"This is not to be borne!" exclaimed the curate in fury. "Persist in this, and you never
<PB N="12" REF="030623_0119_0FE83D00CE7EFBB8"/>
see my face again. Both your child and you I'll turn out of my house instantly, unless you con∣fess your crime, and own the father."</P>
<P>Curious to know this secret, the sisters went up to Rebecca with seeming kindness, and—"Conjured her to spare her father still greater grief, and her own and her child's public infamy, by acknowledging herself its mother; and nam∣ing the man who had seduced her."</P>
<P>Emboldened by this insult from her own sex, Rebecca now began to declare the simple truth. But no sooner had she said that—"The child was the gift of a young man who had found it—" than her sisters burst into laughter, and her father into fresh fits of rage.</P>
<P>Once more the women offered their advice—"To confess and be forgiven."</P>
<P>Once more the father raved.</P>
<P>Beguiled by solicitations, and terrified by threats, she at length felt inclined to take the mother's share of the infant, but was at a loss to whom to give the father's. She thought that Henry had entailed on himself the best right to the charge; but she loved him, and could not bear the idea of accusing him falsely.</P>
<P>While, with agitation in the extreme, she thus deliberated, the proposition again was put,</P>
<P>"Whether she would trust to the mercy of her father by confessing, or draw down his imme∣diate vengeance by denying her guilt?"</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030623_0120_0FE83D6A097DA060"/>
She made choice of the former—and with tears and sobs "Owned herself the mother of the boy."</P>
<P>But still—"Who is the father?"</P>
<P>Again she shrunk from the question, and fervently implored—" To be spared on that point."</P>
<P>Her petition was rejected with vehemence; and the curate's rage encreased till she acknow∣ledged,</P>
<P>"Henry was the father."</P>
<P>"I thought so," exclaimed all her sisters at the same time.</P>
<P>"Villain!" cried the curate. "The dean shall know, before this hour is expired, the base∣ness of the nephew whom he supports upon cha∣rity: he shall know the misery, the grief, the shame he has brought on me, and know how un∣worthy he is of his protection."</P>
<P>"Oh! have mercy on him!" cried Rebecca as she still knelt to her father: "Do not ruin him with his uncle, for he is the best of crea∣tures."</P>
<P>"Ay, ay, we always saw how much she loved him," cried her sisters.</P>
<P>"Wicked, undone girl!" said the clergyman (his rage now subsiding, and tears supplying its place) "you have drawn a curse upon us all—your sisters reputation will be stampt with the colour of yours—my good name will suffer—
<PB N="14" REF="030623_0121_0FE83D849BE21B78"/>
but that is trivial—your soul is lost to virtue, to religion, to shame—"</P>
<P>"No, <HI>indeed,</HI>" cried Rebecca,, "if you will but believe me."</P>
<P>"Do not I believe you? Have not you con∣fessed?"</P>
<P>"You would not pretend to unsay what you have said," cried her eldest sister, "that would be making things worse."</P>
<P>"Go, go out of my sight!" said her father. "Take your child with you to your chamber, and never let me see either of you again.—I do not turn you out of my doors to-day, because I gave you my word I would not if you revealed your shame—but by to-morrow I will provide some place for your reception, where neither I, nor any of your relations, shall ever see or hear of you more."</P>
<P>Rebecca made an effort to cling around her father, and once more to declare her innocence: but her sisters interposed, and she was taken, with her reputed son, to the chamber where the curate had sentenced her to remain, till she quit∣ted his house forever.</P>

<DIV2 N="28" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE curate, in the disorder of his mind, scarce felt the ground he trod as he hasted to the
<PB N="15" REF="030623_0122_0FE83D025AF36DE8"/>
dean's to complain of his wrongs. His name procured him immediate admittance into the li∣brary—and the moment the dean appeared, the curate burst into tears.—The cause being re∣quired of such "very singular marks of grief," Mr. Rymer described himself, "as having been a few months ago the happiest of parents, but that his peace and that of his whole family had been destroyed by Mr. Henry Norwynne, the dean's nephew."</P>
<P>He now entered into a minute recital of Hen∣ry's frequent visits there, and of all that had oc∣curred in his house that morning, from the suspi∣cion that a child was concealed under his roof, to the confession made by his youngest daughter of her fall from virtue, and of her betrayer's name.</P>
<P>The dean was astonished, shocked, and rouzed to anger: he vented reproaches and menaces on his nephew; and, "blessing himself in a virtuous son, whose wisdom and counsel were his only so∣lace in every care," sent for William to commu∣nicate with him on the unhappy subject.</P>
<P>William came, all obedience, and heard with marks of amazement and indignation the account of such black villany! In perfect sympathy with Mr. Rymer and his father, he allowed no "pu∣nishment could be too great for the seducer of innocence, the selfish invader of a whole family's repose."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="030623_0123_0FE83DD69F857D10"/>
Nor did William here speak what he did not think—he merely forgot his own conduct; or if he did recal it to his mind, it was with some fair interpretation in his own behalf; such as self-love ever supplies to those who wish to cheat their conscience.</P>
<P>Young Henry being sent for to appear before this triumvirate, he came with a light step and chearful face. But, on the charge against him being exhibited, his countenance changed—yet, only to the expression of surprise! He boldly asserted his innocence, plainly told the real fact; and with a deportment so perfectly unembarras∣sed, that nothing but the asservations of the cu∣rate, "that his daughter had confessed the whole," could have rendered the story Henry told suspec∣ted; although some of the incidents he related were of no common kind. But Mr. Rymer's charge was an objection to his veracity, too po∣tent to be overcome; and the dean exclaimed in rage—</P>
<P>"We want not your avowal of your guilt—the mother's evidence is testimony sufficient."</P>
<P>"The virtuous Rebecca is not a mother," said Henry, with firmness.</P>
<P>William here, like Rebecca's sisters, took Henry aside, and warned him not to "add to his offence by denying what was proved against him."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030623_0124_0FE83CFA0CE9A618"/>
But Henry's spirit was too manly, his affec∣tion too sincere, not to vindicate the chastity of her he loved, even at his own peril. He again and again protested "she was virtuous."</P>
<P>"Let her instantly be sent for," said the dean, "and this madman confronted with her." Then adding, that as he wished every thing might be conducted with secrecy, he would not employ his clerk on the unhappy occasion; he desired Wil∣liam to draw up the form of an oath, which he would administer as soon as she arrived.</P>
<P>A man and horse were immediately dispatched to bring Rebecca: William drew up an affidavit as his father had directed him—<HI>in Rebecca's name solemnly protesting she was a mother, and Henry, the father of her child</HI>—and now, the dean, sup∣pressing till she came the warmth of his anger spoke thus calmly to Henry:</P>
<P>"Even supposing that your improbable tale of having found this child, and all your declara∣tions in respect to it were true, still you would be greatly criminal: what plea can you make for not having immediately revealed the circum∣stance to me or some other proper person, that the real mother might be detected and punished for her design of murder?"</P>
<P>"In that perhaps I was to blame," returned Henry: "but whoever the mother was, I pitied her."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="030623_0125_0FE83E11E3CEEE60"/>
"Compassion on such an occasion was ill pla∣ced," said the dean.</P>
<P>"Was I wrong, Sir, to pity the child?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Then how could I feel for <HI>that,</HI> and yet di∣vest myself of all feeling for its mother?"</P>
<P>"Its mother!" (exclaimed William, in an∣ger) "she ought to have been immediately pur∣sued, apprehended, and committed to prison."</P>
<P>"It struck me, cousin William," replied Henry, "that the father was most deserving a prison: the poor woman had abandoned only <HI>one</HI>—the man, in all likelihood, had forsaken <HI>two.</HI>"</P>
<P>William was pouring execrations "on the vil∣lain, if such there could be," when Rebecca was announced.</P>
<P>Her eyes were half-closed with weeping; deep confusion overspread her face; and her tottering limbs could hardly support her to the awful cham∣ber where the dean, her father, and William sat in judgment, whilst her beloved Henry stood ar∣raigned as a culprit, by her false evidence.</P>
<P>Upon her entrance, her father first addressed her, and said in a stern, threatening, yet feeling tone, "Unhappy girl, answer me before all pre∣sent—Have you, or have you not, owned your∣self a mother?"</P>
<P>She replied, stealing a fearful look at Henry, "I have."</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030623_0126_0FE83D096D205670"/>
"And have you not," asked the dean, "own∣ed that Henry Norwynne is the father of your child?"</P>
<P>She seemed as if she wished to expostulate—</P>
<P>The curate raised his voice—"Have you, or have you not?"</P>
<P>"I have," she faintly replied.</P>
<P>"Then here," cried the dean to William, "read that paper to her, and take the Bible."</P>
<P>William read the paper, which in her name declared a momentous falsehood: he then held the book in form, while she looked like one dis∣tracted—wrung her hands, and was near sinking to the earth.</P>
<P>At the moment the book was lifted up to her lips to kiss, Henry rushed to her—"Stop," he cried, "Rebecca, do not hurt your future peace; do not be terrified into the commission of a crime which hereafter will distract your delicate consci∣ence. My confession will be a testimony equal to your oath—will render it needless—and here I acknowledge that all you have asserted is truth."</P>
<P>"Surprising audacity!—Complicated vil∣any!" exclaimed the dean—then added, "Henry Norwyne, your first guilt is so enormous, your second, in stedfastly denying it, so base; this last conduct so unaccountable! that from the present hour you must never dare to call me relation, or to consider my house as your home."</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="030623_0127_0FE83E34004F5C68"/>
William, in unison with his father, exclaimed, "Indeed, Henry, your actions merit this punish∣ment."</P>
<P>Henry answered with firmness, "Inflict what punishment you please."</P>
<P>"With the dean's permission then," (said the curate) "you must marry my daughter."</P>
<P>Henry started—"Marry her! Marry Rebec∣ca! Do you pronounce that as a punishment? It would be the greatest blessing Providence could bestow.—But how are we to live? My uncle is too much offended ever to be my friend again; and in this country, people of a cer∣tain class are so educated they cannot exist with∣out the assistance, or what is called the patronage, of others; when that is with-held, they steal or starve. Heaven protect Rebecca from such misfortune!—Sir, (to the curate) do you but consent to support her a year or two longer, and in that time I will learn some occupation that shall raise me to the eminence of maintaining both her and myself without one obligation, or one inconvenience to another."</P>
<P>Rebecca exclaimed, "Oh! you have saved me from such a weight of sin, that my future life would be too happy passed as your slave."</P>
<P>"No, my dear Rebecca, return to your fa∣ther's house, return to slavery but for a few years more, and the rest of your life I will make free."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="030623_0128_0FE83D9DD855B4B0"/>
"And can you forgive me?"</P>
<P>"I can love you: and in that is comprised e∣very thing that is kind."</P>
<P>The curate, who, bating a few passions and a few prejudices, was a man of some worth and feeling, had felt, in the midst of her distress, though the result of crimes, that he loved this neglected daughter better than he had before con∣ceived; and he now agreed "to take her home for a time, provided she were relieved from the child, and the matter so hushed up, that it might draw no imputation upon the characters of his other daughters."</P>
<P>The dean did not degrade his consequence by consultations of this nature; but, having pene∣trated (as he immagined) into the very bottom of this intricate story, and issued his mandate a∣gainst Henry—as a mark that he took no further concern in the matter, he proudly walked out of the room without uttering another word.</P>
<P>William as proudly, and as silently followed.</P>
<P>The curate was inclined to adopt the manners of such great examples—but, self-interest, some affection to Rebecca, and concern for the charac∣ter of his family, made him wish to talk a little with Henry; who now repeated what he had said respecting his marriage with Rebecca, and pro∣mised "to come the very next day in secret, and deliver her from the care of the infant; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the suspicion that would attend her nursing it."</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="030623_0129_0FE83D7B07893EB8"/>
"But above all, said the curate, "procure your uncle's pardon; for without that, without his protection, or the protection of some other rich man; to marry, to obey God's ordinance, <HI>increase and multiply,</HI> is to want food for yourself and your offspring."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="29" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this unfortunate occurrence in the curate's family was, according to his own phrase, "to be hushed up," yet certain persons of his, of the dean's, and of Lord Bendham's house, immediately heard and talked of it. Among these, lady Bendham was most of all shocked and offended; she "never could bear to hear Mr. Rymer either pray or preach again—he had not conducted himself with proper dignity either as a clergyman or a father—he should have imi∣tated the dean's example in respect to Henry, and have turned his daughter out of doors."</P>
<P>Lord Bendham was less severe on the seduced, but had no mercy on the seducer—"a vicious youth, without one accomplishment to endear vice"—For vice, Lord Bendham thought (with some philosophers) might be most exquisitely pleasing, in a pleasing garb. "But this youth sinned without elegance, without one particle of wit, or an atom of good breeding."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="030623_0130_0FE83D55A7DB3F40"/>
Lady Clementina would not permit the sub∣ject to be mentioned a second time in her hearing—extreme delicacy in woman she knew was be∣witching; and the delicacy she displayed on this occasion went so far that she "could not even intercede with the dean to forgive his nephew, because the topic was too gross for her lips to name even in the ear of her husband."</P>
<P>Miss Sedgeley, though on the very eve of her bridal day with William, felt so tender a regard for Henry, that often she thought "Rebecca happier in disgrace and poverty, blest with the love of him, than she was likely to be in the pos∣session of friends and fortune with his cousin."</P>
<P>Had Henry been of a nature to suspect others of evil, or had he felt a confidence in his own worth, such a passion as this young woman's would soon have disclosed its existence: but he, regardless of any attractions of Miss Sedgeley, equally supposed he had none in her eyes; and thus, fortunately for the peace of all parties, this prepossession ever remained a secret except to herself.</P>
<P>So little did William conceive that his clown∣ish cousin could rival him in the affections of a woman of fashion, that he even slightly solicited his father "that Henry might not be banished from the house, at least till after the following
<PB N="24" REF="030623_0131_0FE83D4543C3E1E8"/>
day, when the great festival of his marriage was to be celebrated."</P>
<P>But the dean refused; and reminded his son, "That he was bound both by his moral and re∣ligious character, in the eyes of God, and still more, in the eyes of men, to shew lasting re∣sentment of iniquity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his."</P>
<P>William acquiesced, and immediately deliver∣ed to his cousin the dean's "wishes for his amend∣ment," and a letter of recommendation procured from Lord Bendham, to introduce him on board a man of war; where, he was told, "he might hope to meet with preferment according to his merit as a sailor and a gentleman."</P>
<P>Henry pressed William's hand on parting—wished him happy in his marriage—and suppli∣cated, as the only favour he would implore, an interview with his uncle—to thank him for all his former kindness, and see him for the last time.</P>
<P>William repeated this petition to his father, but with so little energy, that the dean did not grant it. He felt himself compelled to resent that reprobate character in which Henry had ap∣peared; and he feared—"lest the remembrance of his last parting from his brother might, on taking a formal leave of that brother's son, re∣duce him to some tokens of weakness, that would ill become his dignity and just displeasure."</P>
<P>He sent him his blessing, with money to con∣vey
<PB N="25" REF="030623_0132_0FE83D4DEB588AD8"/>
him to his ship—and Henry quitted his un∣cle's house in a flood of tears, to seek first a new protectress for his little foundling, and then to seek his fortune.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXX.</HEAD>
<P>THE wedding day of Mr. William Norwynne with Miss Caroline Sedgeley arrived—and on that day, the bells of every parish surrounding that in which they lived, joined with their own in celebration of the blissful union. Flowers were strewed before the new married pair, and favours and ale made many a heart more glad∣some, than that of either bridegroom or bride.</P>
<P>Upon this day of ringing and rejoicing, the bells were not muffled, nor was conversation on the subject with-held from the ear of Hannah! She heard like her neighbours; and sitting on the side of her bed in her little chamber, suffered, under the cottage roof, as much affliction as ever visited a palace.</P>
<P>Tyrants, who have embrued their hands in the blood of myriads of their fellow creatures, can call their murders "religion, justice, attention to the good of mankind"—poor Hannah knew no sophistry to calm <HI>her</HI> conscience—she felt her∣self a harlot and a murderer—a slighted, a desert∣ed
<PB N="26" REF="030623_0133_0FE83D4C6702C160"/>
wretch, bereft of all she loved in this world, all she could hope for in the next.</P>
<P>She complained bitterly of illness, nor could the entreaties of her father and mother prevail on her to share in the sports of this general holiday.—As none of her humble visitors suspected the cause of her more than ordinary indisposition, they en∣deavoured to divert it with an account of every thing they had seen at church—"What the bride wore, how joyful the bridegroom looked:" and all the little signs of that complete happiness, which they conceived was for certain tasted.</P>
<P>Hannah, who, before this event, had at mo∣ments suppressed the agonising sting of guilt, in the faint prospect of her lover one day restored; on this memorable occasion lost every glimpse of hope, and was weighed to the earth with an ac∣cumulation of despair.</P>
<P>Where is the degree in which the sinner stops? Unhappy Hannah! the first time you permitted indecorous familiarity from a man who made you no promise, who gave you no hope of becoming his wife, who profest nothing beyond those fervent though slender affections which attach the rake to the wanton—the first time you interpreted his kind looks and ardent prayers, into tenderness and constancy—the first time you descended from the character of purity, you rushed imperceptibly on the blackest crimes.—The more sincerely you
<PB N="27" REF="030623_0134_0FE83D35D8BB0248"/>
loved, the more you plunged in danger—from one ungoverned passion proceeded a second and a third. In the fervency of affection, you yielded up your virtue!—In the excess of fear, you stained your conscience, by the intended murder of your child!—and now, in the violence of grief, you meditate—what?—to put an end to your existence by your own hand!</P>
<P>After casting her thoughts around, anxious to find some little bud of comfort on which to fix her longing eye; she beheld, in the total loss of William, nothing but a wide waste, an exten∣sive plain of anguish.—"How am I to be sus∣tained through this dreary journey of life?" she exclaimed.—Upon this question she felt more poignantly than ever, her loss of innocence—in∣nocence would have been her support—but, in place of this best prop to the afflicted, guilt flashed on her memory every time she flew for aid to reflection.</P>
<P>At length, from horrible rumination, a mo∣mentary alleviation came—"But one more step in wickedness," she triumphantly said, "and all my shame, all my sufferings are over." She congratulated herself upon the lucky thought—when, but an instant after, the tears trickled down her face for the sorrow her death, her sinful death, would bring to her poor, and beloved pa∣rents.—She then thought upon the probability of
<PB N="28" REF="030623_0135_0FE83E20EFD358E0"/>
a sigh it might draw from William; and the pride, the pleasure of that little tribute, coun∣terpoised every struggle on the side of life.</P>
<P>As she saw the sun decline, "When you rise again," she thought, "when you peep bright to-morrow morning into this little room to call me up, I shall not be here to open my eyes up∣on a hateful day—I shall no more regret that you have waked me!—I shall be sound asleep, never to wake again in this wretched world—not even the voice of William would then a∣wake me."</P>
<P>While she found herself resolved, and even∣ing just come on, she hurried out of the house, and hastened to the fatal wood; the scene of her dishonour—the scene of meditated murder—and now, the intended scene of suicide.</P>
<P>As she walked along between the close-set trees, she saw at a little distance, the spot where William first made love to her; and where, at every appointment, he used to wait her com∣ing. She darted her eye away from this place with horror—but, after a few moments of emo∣tion, she walked slowly up to it—shed tears, and pressed with her trembling lips that tree, a∣gainst which he was accustomed to lean while he talked to her.—She felt an inclination to make this the spot to die in—but her preconcert∣ed, and the less frightful death, of throwing her∣self
<PB N="29" REF="030623_0136_0FE83CCB0E9379D0"/>
into a pool on the other side of the wood, induced her to go onwards.</P>
<P>Presently, she came near the place where her child, and William's, was exposed to perish.—Here, she started with a sense of the most at∣trocious guilt; and her whole frame shook with the dread of an approaching, an omnipotent judge to sentence her for murder.</P>
<P>She halted, appalled! aghast! undetermined whether to exist longer beneath the pressure of a criminal conscience, or die that very hour and meet her final condemnation.</P>
<P>She proceeded a few steps farther, and beheld the very ivy-bush close to which her infant lay, when she left him exposed—and now, from this minute recollection, all the mother rising in her soul, she saw, as it were, her babe again in its deserted state; and, bursting into tears of bitterest contrition and compassion, she cried,</P>
<P>"As I was merciless to <HI>thee,</HI> my child, thy father has been pitiless to <HI>me!</HI> As I abandoned <HI>thee</HI> to die with cold and hunger, he has forsa∣ken, and has driven <HI>me</HI> to die by self-murder."</P>
<P>She now fixed her eager eyes on the distant pond, and walked more nimbly than before, to rid herself of her agonising sense!</P>
<P>Just as she had nearly reached the wished-for brink, she heard a footstep, and saw, by the glimmering of a clouded moon, a man approach∣ing.
<PB N="30" REF="030623_0137_0FE83DCE02892B80"/>
—She turned out of her path for fear her intentions should be guessed at and thwarted; but still, as she walked another way, her eye was wishfully bent towards the water that was to obliterate her love and her remorse—obliterate forever, William and his child.</P>
<P>It was now, that Henry—who, to prevent scandel, had stolen at that still hour of night to rid the curate of the incumbrance so irksome to him, and take the foundling to a woman whom he had hired for the charge—it was now that Henry came up, with the child of Hannah in his arms, carefully covered all over from the night's dew.</P>
<P>"Hannah, is it you?" (cried Henry, at a little distance) "Where are you going thus late?"</P>
<P>"Home, Sir," said she, and rushed among the trees.</P>
<P>"Stop, Hannah," he cried, "I want to bid you farewell—to-morrow I am going to leave this part of the country for a long time—So God bless you, Hannah!" Saying this, he stretched out his arm to shake her by the hand.</P>
<P>Her poor heart trusting that his blessing, for want of more potent offerings, might, perhaps, at this tremendous crisis, ascend to heaven in her behalf: she stopt, returned, and put out her hand to take his.</P>

"Softly," said he, "don't wake my child—this spot has been a place of danger for him—for underneath this very ivy-bush it was that I found him."</P>
<P>"Found what?" cried Hannah, with a voice elevated to a tremulous scream.</P>
<P>"I will not tell you," replied Henry, "for no one I have ever yet told of it, would believe me."</P>
<P>"I will believe you. I will believe you." She repeated with tones yet more impressive.</P>
<P>"Why then said Henry, "only five weeks ago—"</P>
<P>"Ah!" shrieked Hannah.</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" said Henry.</P>
<P>"Go on," she articulated in the same voice.</P>
<P>"Why then, as I was passing this very place, I wish I may never speak truth again, if I did not find"—here he pulled aside the warm rug in which the infant was wrapt—"this beautiful child."</P>
<P>"With a cord?—"</P>
<P>"A cord was round its neck."</P>
<P>"'Tis mine—the child is mine—'tis mine—my child—I am the mother and the murderer—I fixed the cord, while the ground shook under me—while flashes of fire darted before my eyes!—while my heart was bursting with despair and horror.—But I stopt short—I did not draw the
<PB N="32" REF="030623_0139_0FE83CC680998C98"/>
noose—I had a moment of strength, and I ran away. I left him living—he is living now—es∣caped from my hands—and I am no longer ashamed, but overcome with joy that he is mine▪ I bless you, my dear, my dear, for saving his life—for giving him to me again—for preserving my life, as well as my child's."</P>
<P>Here she took her infant, pressed it to her lips and to her bosom; then bent to the ground, clasped Henry's knees, and wept upon his feet.</P>
<P>He could not for a moment doubt the truth of what she said—her powerful, yet broken accents, her convulsive starts, even more than her decla∣ration, convinced him.</P>
<P>She now rose from the earth in haste, and stealing quick on one side, postponed farther gra∣titude to Henry, for the performance of the most endearing office of a mother. The child greedi∣ly received from her bosom the food till then un∣tasted—and on this, feeling more exquisitely the tender, the proud prerogative of a maternal pa∣rent, she uttered with sighs of transport,</P>
<P>"Now I am as rich, as happy as your father—as blest as his bride!—for I experience the joy of a conscience relieved from a deadly weight—and I have something to love—something on which to pour that fund of affection which he rejects."</P>
<P>"Good heaven!" cried Henry, "and this is my cousin William's child!"</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="030623_0140_0FE83CE0533E1A08"/>
"But your cousin does not know it," said she. "I never told him—he was not kind enough to embolden me—therefore do not blame <HI>him</HI> for <HI>my</HI> sin—he did not know of my wicked designs—he did not encourage me—"</P>
<P>"But he forsook you, Hannah."</P>
<P>"He never said he would not. He always told me he could not marry me."</P>
<P>"Did he tell you so at his first private meet∣ing?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Nor at the second?"</P>
<P>"No, nor yet at the third."</P>
<P>"When was it he told you so?"</P>
<P>"I forget the exact time—but I remember it was on that very evening when I confessed to him—"</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"That he had won my heart."</P>
<P>"Why did you confess it?"</P>
<P>"Because he asked me, and said it would make him happy if I would say so."</P>
<P>"Cruel! dishonourable!"</P>
<P>"Nay, do not blame him—he cannot help <HI>not</HI> loving me, no more than I can help, <HI>loving</HI> him."</P>
<P>Henry rubbed his eyes.</P>
<P>"Bless me, you weep!—I always heard that you were brought up in a savage country; but I suppose it is a mistake; it was your cousin William."</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="030623_0141_0FE83E00E34FB410"/>
"Will not you apply to him for the support of your child?" asked Henry.</P>
<P>"If I thought he would not be angry."</P>
<P>"Angry!—I will write to him on the sub∣ject, if you will give me leave."</P>
<P>"But do not say it is by my desire. Do not say I wish to trouble him—I would sooner beg, than be a trouble to him."</P>
<P>"Why are you so delicate?"</P>
<P>"It is for my own sake—I wish him not to hate me."</P>
<P>"Then, thus you may secure his respect—I will write to him, and let him know all the cir∣cumstances of your case; I will plead for his compassion on his child, but assure him that no conduct of his will ever induce you to declare (except only to me, who knew of your previous acquaintance) who is the father."</P>
<P>To this Hannah consented: but when Henry offered to take from her the infant and carry him to the nurse he had engaged; to this she would not consent.</P>
<P>"Do you mean then to acknowledge him yours?" Henry asked.</P>
<P>"Nothing shall force me to part from him. I will keep him, and let my neighbours judge of me as they please."</P>
<P>Here Henry caught at a hope he feared to name before. "You will then have no objec∣tion,"
<PB N="35" REF="030623_0142_0FE83E24D6E69C20"/>
said he, "to clear an unhappy girl to a few friends with whom her character has suffered by becoming, at my request, his nurse?"</P>
<P>"Most gladly. I will clear any one so that I do not accuse the father."</P>
<P>"You give me leave, then, in your name, to tell the whole story to some particular friends, my cousin William's part in it alone excepted?"</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>Henry now cried, "God bless you!" with greater fervor than when he spoke it before—and he hoped the night was nearly gone, that the time might be so much the shorter before Rebecca should be reinstated in the esteem of her father, and of all those who had misjudged her.</P>
<P>"God bless <HI>you!</HI>" said Hannah, still more fervently, as she walked, with unguided steps, towards her home; for her eyes never wander∣ed from the precious object that caused her un∣expected return.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY rose early in the morning and flew to the curate's house, with more than even his usual thirst of justice, to clear injured innocence, to redeem from shame, her whom he loved. With eager haste he told—that he had found
<PB N="36" REF="030623_0143_0FE83CE8E88FC618"/>
the mother, whose fall from virtue, Rebecca, overcome by confusion and threats, had taken on herself.</P>
<P>Rebecca rejoiced—but her sisters shook their heads—and even the father seemed to doubt.</P>
<P>Confident in the truth of his story, Henry persisted so boldly in his affirmations, that if Mr. Rymer did not entirely believe what he said, he secretly hoped the dean and other peo∣ple might; therefore he began to imagine, he could possibly shake from <HI>his</HI> family the present stigma, whether or no it belonged to any other.</P>
<P>No sooner was Henry gone, than Mr. Ry∣mer waited on the dean to report what he had heard; and he frankly attributed his daughter's false confession, to the compulsive methods he had adopted in charging her with the offence: upon this statement, Henry's love to her was was also a solution of his inconsistent conduct on that singular occasion.</P>
<P>The dean immediately said—"he would put the matter beyond all doubt: for he would that moment send for the present reputed mother; and if she acknowledged the child, he would instantly commit her to prison for the attempt of putting it to death."</P>
<P>The curate applauded the dean's sagacity; a warrant was issued; and Hannah brought pri∣soner before the grandfather of her child.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="030623_0144_0FE83D0B4EB1EEB0"/>
She appeared astonished at the peril in which she found herself! Confused also, with a thou∣sand inexpressible sensations which the dean's presence inspired, she seemed to prevaricate in all she uttered.—Accused of this, she was still more disconcerted—said, and unsaid—confessed herself the mother of the infant, but declared she did not know—then owned she <HI>did</HI> know the name of the man who had undone her, but would never utter it.—At length, she cast her∣self on her knees before the father of her betrayer, and supplicated "he would not punish her with severity, as she most penitently confessed her fault, so far as it related to herself."</P>
<P>While Mr. and Mrs. Norwynne, just enter∣ed on the honey-moon, were sitting side by side enjoying with peace and with honour conjugal society; poor Hannah, threatened, reviled, and sinking to the dust, was hearing from the mouth of William's father, the enormity of those crimes to which his son had been accessary.—She saw the mittimus written that was to convey her in∣to a prison—saw herself delivered once more into the hands of constables, before her resolution of concealing the name of William in her story left her.—She now, overcome with affright, and thinking she should expose him still more in a public court, if hereafter on her trial she should be obliged to name him—she now humbly asked
<PB N="38" REF="030623_0145_0FE83E3C997C3F08"/>
the dean to hear a few words she had to say in private—where she promised she "would speak nothing but the truth."</P>
<P>This was impossible, he said—"No private confessions before a magistrate! All must be done openly."</P>
<P>She urged again and again the same request—it was denied more peremptorily than at first.—On which she said,</P>
<P>"Then, Sir, forgive me, since you force me to it, if I speak before Mr. Rymer and these men, what I would forever have kept a secret if I could. One of your family is my child's father."</P>
<P>"Any of my servants?" cried the dean.</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"My nephew?"</P>
<P>"No; one who is nearer still."</P>
<P>"Come this way," said the dean, "I <HI>will</HI> speak to you in private."</P>
<P>It was not that the dean, as a magistrate, dis∣tributed partial decrees of pretended justice—he was rigidly faithful to his trust—he would not inflict punishment on the innocent, or let the guilty escape—but in all particulars of refined or coarse treatment, he would alleviate or aggra∣vate according to the rank of the offender. He could not feel that a secret was of equal impor∣tance to a poor, as to a rich person—and while Hannah gave no intimation but that her delicacy
<PB N="39" REF="030623_0146_0FE83E4ECD565A38"/>
rose from fears for herself, she did not so forcibly impress the dean with an opinion that it was a case which had pressing cause for a private con∣ference, as when she boldly said, "a part of <HI>his</HI> family, very near to him, was concerned in her tale."</P>
<P>The final result of their conversation in an ad∣joining room was—a charge from the dean, in the words of Mr. Rymer, "to hush the affair up;" and his promise that the infant should be immediately taken from her, and "she should have no more trouble with it."</P>
<P>"I have no trouble with it," replied Hannah. "It is now all my comfort: and I cannot part from it."</P>
<P>"Why, you inconsistent woman, did you not attempt to murder it?"</P>
<P>"That was before I had suckled it."</P>
<P>"It is necessary you should give it up—it must be sent some miles off—and then the whole circumstance will be soon forgotten."</P>
<P>"<HI>I</HI> shall never forget it."</P>
<P>"No matter—you must give up the child—Do not most of our first women of quality part with their children?"</P>
<P>"Women of quality have other things to love—I have nothing else."</P>
<P>"And would you occasion my son, and his
<PB N="40" REF="030623_0147_0FE83D128A814520"/>
new-made bride, the shame and the uneasi∣ness—"</P>
<P>Here Hannah burst into a flood of tears; and being angrily asked by the dean "why she blub∣bered so?"—</P>
<P>"I—have had shame and uneasiness," she replied, wringing her hands.</P>
<P>"And you deserve them—they are the sure attendants of crimes such as yours.—If you al∣lured, and entrapped a young man like my son—"</P>
<P>"I am the youngest by five years," said Han∣nah.</P>
<P>"Well, well, repent;" returned the dean, "repent, and resign your child. Repent, and you may yet marry an honest man who knows nothing of the matter."</P>
<P>"And repent too?" asked Hannah.</P>
<P>Not the insufferable ignorance of young Hen∣ry, when he first came to England, was more vexatious or provoking to the dean than the rus∣tic folly of poor Hannah's uncultured replies.—He at last, in an offended and determined manner, told her,</P>
<P>"That if she would resign the child, and keep the father's name a secret, not only the child should be taken care of, but she herself might, perhaps, receive some favours; but if she persist∣ed in her imprudent folly, she must expect no
<PB N="41" REF="030623_0148_0FE83D3E6BFD4AA0"/>
consideration on her own account; nor should she be allowed, for the maintenance of the boy, a sixpence beyond the stated sum for a poor man's unlawful offspring. Hannah, resolving not to be separated from her infant, bowed resignation to this last decree; and, terrified at the loud words and angry looks of the dean, after being regularly discharged, stole to her home; where the smiles of her infant, and the caresses she la∣vished on it, repaid her for the sorrows she had just suffered for its sake.</P>
<P>Let it here be observed, that the dean, on suf∣fering Hannah to depart without putting in force the law against her as he had threatened, did no∣thing, as it were, <HI>behind the curtain.</HI> He open∣ly and candidly owned to Mr. Rymer, his clerk, and the two constables who were attending—"That an affair of some little gallantry, in which, he was extremely sorry to say, his son was rather too nearly involved, required, in con∣sideration of his recent marriage, and an excellent young woman's (his bride's) happiness, that it should not be publicly talked of—Therefore he had thought proper only to reprimand the hussey, and send her about her business."</P>
<P>The curate assured the dean—"That upon this, and upon all other occasions, which should, would, or <HI>could</HI> occur, he owed to his judgment, as his superior, implicit obedience."</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="030623_0149_0FE83D8B9EB2B808"/>
The clerk and the two constables most pro∣perly said—"His honour was a gentleman, and of course must know better how to act than they."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="32" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not the pleasure of a mother that Hannah experienced, which could make her in∣sensible to the sorrow of a daughter.</P>
<P>Her parents had received the stranger child along with a fabricated tale she told "of its appertaining to another," without the smallest suspicion; but, by the secret diligence of the cu∣rate, and the nimble tongues of his elder daugh∣ters, the report of all that had passed on the sub∣ject of this unfortunate infant, soon circulated through the village; and Hannah in a few weeks had seen her parents pine away in grief and shame at her loss of virtue.</P>
<P>She perceived the neighbours avoid, or openly sneer at <HI>her</HI>—but that was little—she saw them slight her aged father and mother upon her ac∣count: and she now took the resolution rather to perish for want in another part of the coun∣try, than live where she was known, and so en∣tail a curse on all who loved her. She slightly hoped, too, that by disappearing from the town and neighbourhood, some little reward might be allowed her for her banishment by the dean's fa∣mily.
<PB N="43" REF="030623_0150_0FE83D20DA400FF0"/>
In that she was deceived—No sooner was she gone, indeed, than her guilt was forgot∣ten; but with he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guilt her wants. The dean and his family rejoined at her and her child's de∣parture; but as this mode she had chosen, chan∣ced to be no specified condition in the terms of∣fered to her, they did not think they were bound to pay her for it; and while she was too fearful and bashful to solicit the dean, too proud (for∣lorn as she was) to supplicate his son, they both concluded she "wanted for nothing;" for to be poor, and too delicate to complain, they deemed incompatible.</P>
<P>To heighten the sense of her degraded, friend∣less situation, she knew that Henry had not been unmindful of his promise to her, but that he had applied to his cousin in her and his child's behalf; for he had acquainted her, that Wil∣liam's answer was—"all obligations on <HI>his</HI> part were now undertaken by his father; for Han∣nah having chosen (in a fit of malignity upon his marriage) to apprise the dean of their former in∣tercourse, such conduct had forever cancelled all attention due from him to her, or to her child, beyond what its bare maintenance exacted."</P>
<P>In vain had Henry explained to him the pre∣dicament in which poor Hannah was involved before she consented to reveal her secret to his fa∣ther; William was happy in an excuse to rid
<PB N="44" REF="030623_0151_0FE83CEFD5A876D0"/>
himself of a burthen, and seemed to believe, what he wished were true—that she had forfeited all claim to his farther notice.</P>
<P>Henry informed Hannah in as gentle terms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possible this unkind reception of his efforts in her favour, for she excited his deepest com∣passion.—Perhaps our <HI>own</HI> misfortunes are the cause of our pity for others, even more than <HI>their</HI> ills; and Henry's present sorrows had softened his heart to peculiar sympathy in woe. He had unhappily found, that the ardour which had hurried him to vindicate the reputation of Rebecca, was likely to deprive him of the blessing of her ever becoming his wife. For the dean, chagrined that his son was at length proved an offender instead of his nephew, submitted to the tempta∣tion of punishing the latter, while he forgave the former. He sent for Henry, and having coldly congratulated him on his and Rebecca's inno∣cence, represented to him the impropriety of mar∣rying the daughter of a poor curate, and laid his commands on him, "never to harbour such an intention more." Henry found this restriction so severe that he would not promise obedience; but on his next attempt to visit Rebecca, he met a positive repulse from her father, who signified to him, "that the dean had forbid him to permit their farther acquaintance;" and the curate de∣clared—"that, for his own part, he had no will,
<PB N="45" REF="030623_0152_0FE83D6B90BF3758"/>
judgment, or faculties; but that he submitted in all things to the superior clergy."</P>
<P>At the very time young Henry had received the proposal from Mr. Rymer of his immediate union with his daughter, and the dean had made no objection, Henry waved the happiness for the time present, and had given a reason why he wished it postponed. The reason he then gave had its weight, but he had another concealed, of yet more import.—Much as he loved, and look∣ed forward with rapture to that time when every morning, every evening, and all the day, he should have the delight of Rebecca's society; still there was one other wish nearer his heart than this—one desire which for years had been fore∣most in his thoughts, and which not even love could eradicate. He longed, he pined to know what fate had befallen his father. Provided he were living, he could conceive no joy so extreme as that of seeing him! If he were dead, he was anxious to pay the tribute of filial piety he ow∣ed, by satisfying his affectionate curiosity in every circumstance of the sad event.</P>
<P>While a boy, he had frequently expressed these sentiments to both his uncle and his cousin: sometimes they apprised him of the total impro∣bability of accomplishing his wishes: at other times, when they saw the disappointment weigh heavy on his mind, they bade him—"wait till he
<PB N="46" REF="030623_0153_0FE83CE4FB8847B8"/>
was a man, before he could hope to put his de∣signs in execution." He did wait. But on the very day he arrived at the age of twenty-one, he made a vow—"that to gain intelligence of his father, should be the first act of his free will."</P>
<P>Previously to this time he had made all the enquiries possible, whether any new adventure to that part of Africa in which he was bred, was likely to be undertaken. Of this there appear∣ed to be no prospect, till the intended expedition to Sierra Leone was announced, which favoured his hope of being able to procure a passage among those adventurers, so near to the island on which his father was (or had been prisoner) as to obtain an opportunity of visiting it by stealth.</P>
<P>Fearing contention, or the being dissuaded from his plans if he communicated them, he for∣med them in private, kept them secretly; and his imagination filled with the kindness, the tender∣ness, the excess of fondness he had experienced from his father, beyond any other person in the world, he had thought with delight on the sepa∣ration from all his other kindred, to pay his duty to him, or to his revered memory. Of late in∣deed, there had been an object introduced to his acquaintance, from whom it was bitter to part; but his designs had been planned and firmly fix∣ed before he knew Rebecca; nor could he have tasted contentment even with her, at the expence of his piety to his father.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="030623_0154_0FE83D59F272F678"/>
In the last interview he had with the dean, Henry—perceiving that his disposition towards him was not less severe than when a few days be∣fore he had ordered him on board a vessel—found this the proper time to declare his intentions of accompanying the fleet to Sierra Leone. His uncle expressed surprised but immediately gave him a sum of money, such as he thought might defray his expences; and as he gave it, by his willingness, his look, and his accent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>med to say, "I foresee this is the last you will ever re∣quire."</P>
<P>Young William, though a very dutiful son, was amazed when he heard of Henry's project, "as the serious and settled resolution of a man."</P>
<P>Lady Clementina, Lord and Lady Bendham, and twenty others "wished him a successful voyage," and thought no more about him.</P>
<P>It was for Rebecca alone, to feel the loss of Henry—it was for a mind like hers alone, to know his worth—nor did this last proof of it, the quitting her, for one who claimed by every tie a preference, lessen him in her esteem.—When, by a message from him, she became acquainted with his design, she valued him the more for this observance of his duty, much as it interfered with her happiness—the more she regretted his loss, and the more anxiously prayed for his return;
<PB N="48" REF="030623_0155_0FE83D701DD738A0"/>
which, in the following letter, written just before his departure, he taught her to hope for,</P>

<P>I Do not tell you I am sorry to part from you—you know I am—and you know all I have suffered, since your father denied me per∣mission to see you.</P>
<P>But perhaps you do not know the hopes I enjoy, and which bestow on me a degree of peace—and those I am eager to tell you.</P>
<P>I hope, Rebecca, to see you again—I hope to return to England, and overcome every obsta∣cle to our marriage—and then, in whatever sta∣tion we are placed, I shall consider myself as happy, as it is possible to be in this world—I feel a conviction that you would be happy too.</P>
<P>Some persons, I know, estimate happiness by fine houses, gardens, and parks—others, by pictures, horses, money, and various things whol∣ly remote from their own species—but when I wish to ascertain the real felicity of any rational man, I always enquire <HI>whom he has to love.</HI> If I find he has nobody—or does not love those he has—even in the midst of all his profusion of finery and grandeur, I pronounce him a being in deep adversity. In loving you, I am happier than my cousin William; even though I am obliged to leave you for a time.</P>
<P>Do not be afraid you should grow old be∣fore
<PB N="49" REF="030623_0156_0FE83D71A2BCC2E0"/>
I return—age can never alter you in my re∣gard. It is your gentle nature, your unaffec∣ted manners, your easy chearfulness, your clear understanding, the sincerity of all your words and actions, that have gained my heart; and while you preserve charms like these, you will be dearer to me with white hairs and a wrinkled face, than any of your sex, who, not possessing all these qualities, possess the youth and bloom of perfect beauty.</P>
<P>You will esteem me too, I trust, though I should return on crutches; and with my poor father, whom I may be obliged to maintain by daily labour.</P>
<P>I will employ all my time during my ab∣sence, in the study of some art that may enable me to support you both, provided heaven will bestow two such blessings on me. In the cheer∣ing thought that it will be so, and in that only, I have the courage, my dear, dear Rebecca, to say to you</P>

<P>BEFORE Henry could receive a reply to his letter, the fleet in which he sailed put to sea on the voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="030623_0157_0FE83DA4A7DF0BE8"/>
By his absence, not only Rebecca was depriv∣ed of the friend she loved, but poor Hannah lost a kind and compassionate adviser. Her parents, too, both sickened, and both died, in a short time after—and now, wholly friendless, and in her lit∣tle exile where she could only hope for tolera∣tion, not being known, she was contending with suspicion, rebuffs, disappointments, and various other ills, that might have made the most harsh of her Anfield persecutors feel compassion for her, could they have witnessed the throbs of her heart, and have viewed the state of her agonising mind.</P>
<P>Still, there are few persons whom Providence afflicts, beyond the limits of <HI>all</HI> consolation—few cast so low, as not to feel pride on <HI>certain</HI> occasions—and Hannah felt a comfort, and a dig∣nity in the thought—that she had both a mind and a body capable of sustaining every hardship her destiny might inflict, rather than submit to the disgrace of soliciting William's charity a se∣cond time.</P>
<P>This determination was put to a variety of trials—In vain she offered herself to the stran∣gers of the village, in which she was acciden∣tally cast, as a servant—her child, her dejected looks, her broken sentences, a wildness in her eye, a kind of bold despair, that at times spread over her features, her imperfect story, who and
<PB N="51" REF="030623_0158_0FE83D6377A208F0"/>
what she was, prejudiced all those to whom she applied; and, after thus travelling to several small towns and hamlets, the only employer she could obtain was a farmer, and the only employ∣ment, to tend and feed his cattle, while his men were in the harvest, tilling the ground, or at some other labour, which required, at that time, pecu∣liar expedition.</P>
<P>Though Hannah was born of peasants, yet, having been an only child, and of industrious pa∣rents, she had been nursed with tenderness and delicacy, ill suited to her present occupation—but she endured it with patience; and the most laborious part would have seemed light to her, could she have dismissed the reflection—what it was that had reduced her to it.</P>
<P>Soon her tender hands became hard and rough, her fair skin burnt and yellow; so that when, on a Sunday, she has looked in the glass, she has started back as if it were some other face she saw instead of her own. But this loss of beauty gave her no regret—while William did not see her, it was of little purport to her, whether she were beautiful or hideous. On the features of her child only, she now looked with joy—there, she fancied she saw William at every glance—and in the fond imagination, felt, at times, every hap∣piness short of seeing <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>By herding solely with the brute creation, she
<PB N="52" REF="030623_0159_0FE83DB68DFACFC8"/>
and her child were allowed to live together; and this was a state she preferred to the society of hu∣man creatures, who would have separated her from what she loved so tenderly.—Anxious to retain a place in which she possessed such a bles∣sing, care and attention to her humble office caus∣ed her master to prolong her stay through all the the winter—then, during the spring, she attend∣ed his yeaning sheep—in the summer, watched them as they grazed—and thus season after sea∣son passed, till her young son could afford her as∣sistance in her daily work.</P>
<P>He now could charm her with his conversa∣tion as well as with his looks—a thousand times, in the transports of parental love, she has pressed him to her bosom, and thought with an agony of horror—on her foul intent to destroy, what was now so dear, so necessary to her ex∣istence.</P>
<P>Still the boy grew more like his father—in one resemblance alone he failed.—He loved Han∣nah with an affection totally distinct from the pitiful and childish gratification of his own self-love—he never would quit her side for all the tempting offers of toys or money—never would eat of rarities given to him, till Hannah took a part—never crossed her will, however contradic∣tory to his own—never saw her smile that he did not laugh—nor did she ever weep, but he wept too.</P>

<P>FROM the mean subject of oxen, sheep, and peasants, we return to personages—<HI>i. e.</HI> persons of rank and fortune. The bishop, who was in∣troduced in the last volume, but who occupied a very small space there, is now mentioned in this, merely that the reader may know, he is at pre∣sent in the same state as his writings—dying: and that his friend, the dean, is talked of as the most likely successor to his dignified office.</P>
<P>The dean, most assuredly, had a strong friend∣ship for the bishop, and now, most assuredly, wished him to recover—and yet—when he re∣flected on the success of his pamphlet a few years back, and of many which he had written since, on the very same subject, he could not but think, "That he had more righteous pretensions to fill the vacant seat of his much beloved and reverend friend (should fate ordain it to be vacated) than any other man:" and he knew—that it would not take one moment from that friends remaining life, should he exert himself, and with all due management, to obtain the elevated station when <HI>he</HI> should be no more.</P>
<P>In presupposing the death of a friend, the dean—like many other virtuous men—"always sup∣posed him going to a better place." With per∣fect resignation, therefore, he waited whatever
<PB N="54" REF="030623_0161_0FE83E3E1E43E108"/>
change might happen to the bishop; ready to re∣ceive him with open arms if he recovered, or equally ready, in case of his dissolution, to re∣ceive his dignities.</P>
<P>Lady Clementina displayed her sensibility and feeling for the sick prelate, by the disgusting ex∣travagance of hysteric fits; except at those times when she talked seriously with her husband upon the injustice which she thought would be done to him, and to his many pamphlets and sermons, if he did not immediately rise to the episcopal ho∣nour.</P>
<P>"Surely, dean," said she, "should you be disappointed upon this occasion, you will write no more books for the good of your country?"</P>
<P>"Yes I will," he replied, "but the next book I write for the good of my country shall be very different, nay the very reverse of those I have already written."</P>
<P>"How, dean! would you show yourself changed?"</P>
<P>"No, but I will show that my country is changed."</P>
<P>"What! since you produced your last work? only six weeks ago!"</P>
<P>"Great changes may occur in six days;" re∣plied the dean, with a threatening accent: "and if I find things <HI>have</HI> taken a new and im∣proper turn, I will be the first to expose it."</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="030623_0162_0FE83E45013FA038"/>
"But before you act in this manner, my dear, surely you will wait—"</P>
<P>"I will wait till the See is disposed of to ano∣ther," said he.</P>
<P>He did wait—The bishop died—The dean was promoted to the See of * * *, and wrote a folio on the prosperity of our happy country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the bishop and his son were sailing before prosperous gales on the ocean of life, young Henry was contending with adverse winds, and many other perils on the watery ocean—yet still, his distresses and dangers were less, than those which Hannah had to encounter on land. The sea threatens an untimely death; the shore menaces calamities from which death is a refuge.</P>
<P>The afflictions Hannah had already experien∣ced, could just admit of aggravation—the addi∣tion occurred.</P>
<P>Had the good farmer, who made her the com∣panion of his stocks and herds, lived till now, till now she might have been secure from the annoy∣ance of human kind: but, thrown once more upon society, she was unfit to sustain the conflict of decorum against depravity.—Her master, her patron, her preserver, was dead; and hardly as
<PB N="56" REF="030623_0163_0FE83D94565BB588"/>
she had earned the pittance she received from him, she found, it surpassed all her power to ob∣tain the like again. Her doubtful character, her capacious mind, her unmethodical manners, were still ill suited to the nice precision of a country housewife; and as the prudent mistress of a family sneered at her pretensions, she, in her turn, scorned at the narrow minded mistress of a family.</P>
<P>In her enquiries how to gain her bread free from the cutting reproaches of discretion, she was informed "that London was the only pri∣vate corner where guilt could be secreted undis∣turbed—and the only public place where in open day, it might triumphantly stalk, attended by a train of audacious admirers."</P>
<P>There was a charm to the ear of Hannah, in the name of London, that thrilled through her soul—William lived in London—and she thought, that while she retired to some dark cel∣lar with her offences, he probably would ride in state with his, and she at humble distance might sometimes catch a glance of him.</P>
<P>As difficult as to eradicate insanity from a mind once possessed, so difficult it is to erase from the lover's breast, the deep impression of a <HI>real</HI> affec∣tion. Coercion may prevail for a short interval, still love will rage again. Not all the ignomi∣ny Hannah experienced in the place where she
<PB N="57" REF="030623_0164_0FE83D8D23D5DFB8"/>
now was without a home—not the hunger which she at time suffered, and even at times saw her child endure—not every inducement for for going to London, or motive for quitting her present desolate station, had the weight to affect her choice so much as—in London, she should live nearer William; in the present spot she could never hope to see him again; but there she might chance to pass him in the streets; she might pass his door unobserved every day; might enquire about him of his inferior neighbours, who would be unsuspious of the cause of her curiosity. For these gratifications she should breathe ano∣ther air—for these, she could bear all hardships which London threatened; and for these, she took a three weeks' journey to that perilous town on foot, cheering, as she walked along, her innocent and wearied companion.</P>
<P>William! In your luxurious dwelling! Pos∣sessed of coffers filled with gold! Relations, friends, clients, joyful around you! Delicious viands and rich wines upon your sumptuous board! Voluptuousness displayed in every apart∣ment of your habitation!—Contemplate, for a moment, Hannah, your first love, with her son, your first, and only child, walking through frost and snow to London, with a foreboding fear on the mother—that they both may perish for the want of a friend when arrived.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="030623_0165_0FE83CCF106B2000"/>
But no sooner did Hannah find herself within the smoke of the metropolis, than the old charm was renewed, and scarcely had she refreshed her child at the poor inn at which she stopped, than she enquired—how far it was to that part of the town where she knew William resided.</P>
<P>She received for answer, "about two miles."</P>
<P>Upon this information, she thought she would keep in reserve, till some new sorrow befell her, the consolation of passing his door, (perchance of seeing him) which must ever be an alleviation of her grief. It was not long before she had oc∣casion for even more substantial comfort. She soon found she was not likely to obtain a service here, more than in the country. Some objected that she could not make caps and gowns; some, that she could not preserve and pickle; some, that she was too young; some, that she was too pretty; and all declined accepting her, till at last a citizen's wife, on condition of her receiv∣ing but half the wages usually given, took her as a servant of all work.</P>
<P>In romances, and in some plays, there are scenes of dark and unwholesome mines, wherein the labourer works during the brightest day by the aid of artificial light. There are in London kitchens equally dismal, though not quite so much exposed to damp and noxious vapours. In one of these, under ground, hid from the cheer∣ful
<PB N="59" REF="030623_0166_0FE83E4687AC14B0"/>
light of the sun, poor Hannah was doomed to toil from morning till night, subjected to the command of a dissatisfied mistress; who, not es∣timating as she ought, the misery incurred by serving her, constantly threatened her servants "with a dismission;" at which the unthinking wretches would tremble merely from the sound of the words—for, to have reflected—to have considered what their purport was—"to be re∣leased from a dungeon, relieved from continual upbraidings, and vile drudgery," must have been a subject of rejoicing—and yet, because these good tidings were delivered as a menace, custom had made the poor creatures fearful of the consequence. So, death being described to chil∣dren as a disaster, even poverty and shame will start from it with affright; when, had it been pictured (as it is) a good, it would be feared by few, and many, many would welcome it with gladness.</P>
<P>All the care of Hannah to please, her fear of offending, her toilsome days, her patience, her submission, could not prevail on her mistress to retain her one hour after by chance she had heard, "that Hannah was the mother of a child; that she wished it should be kept a secret; and that she stole out now and then to visit him."</P>
<P>Hannah, with swimming eyes and an almost breaking heart, left a place—where, to have
<PB N="60" REF="030623_0167_0FE83DF86D59A650"/>
lived one hour, would have plunged any fine lady in the deepest grief.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="36" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>HANNAH was driven from service to ser∣vice—her deficiency in the knowledge of a mere drudge, or her lost character, pursued her where∣ver she went; and at length, becoming wholly destitute, she gladly accepted a place where the latter misfortune was not the least objection.</P>
<P>In one of those habitations where continual misery is dressed in continual smiles; where ex∣treme of poverty is concealed by extreme of show; where wine dispenses mirth only by dis∣pensing forgetfulness; and where female beauty is so cheap, so complying, that while it inveigles it disgusts the man of pleasure;—in one of those houses, to attend upon its wretched inhabitants, Hannah was hired.—Her feelings of rectitude submitted to those of hunger—Her principles of virtue (which the loss of virtue had not destroy∣ed) received a shock when she engaged to be the abettor of vice, from which her delicacy, mo∣rality, and religion shrunk: but—persons of honour and of reputation would not employ her: was she then to perish? That perhaps was easy to resolve—but she had a child to leave behind! A child, from whom to part for a day was a tor∣ment.
<PB N="61" REF="030623_0168_0FE83D83162766E8"/>
—Yet, before she submitted herself to a si∣tuation that filled her mind with a kind of loath∣ing horror, often she paced up and down the street in which William lived, looked wistfully at his house, and sometimes, lost to all her finer feelings of independent pride, thought of sending a short petition to him—but, at the idea of a repulse, and of that frowning brow, which she knew William <HI>could</HI> dart on her, she preferred death, or the most degrading life, to the trial.</P>
<P>It was long since, that misfortune and disho∣nour had made her callous to the good or ill opi∣nion of all the world, except <HI>his;</HI> and the fear of drawing upon her his encreased contempt, was still, at the crisis of applying, so powerful, that she sound she dared not even hazard a reproof from him in the person of his father; whose ri∣gour she had now more than once experienced, in the frequent harsh messages conveyed to her with the poor stipend for her boy.</P>
<P>Awed by the rigid and pious character of the new bishop, the rising honours and growing re∣putation of his son, she mistook the appearance of moral excellence, for moral excellence itself; and felt her own unworthyness even to become the supplicant of those great men.</P>
<P>Day after day she watched those parts of the town through which William's chariot was ac∣customed to drive—but, to see the carriage was
<PB N="62" REF="030623_0169_0FE83DBD57FFAD40"/>
all to which she aspired—a feeling, not to be de∣scribed, forced her to cast her eyes upon the earth as it drew near to her—and when it had passed, she beat her breast and wept, that she had not seen <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Impressed with the superiority of others, and her own abject and disgustful state, she cried—"Let me herd with those who won't despise me—let me only see faces whereon I can look without confusion and terror—let me associate with wretches like myself, rather than force my shame before those who are so good, they can but scorn and mock at me."</P>
<P>With a mind thus languishing for sympathy in disgrace, she entered a servant in the house just now described. There, accomplishing the fatal proverb against "<HI>evil communications,</HI>" she had not the fortitude to be an exception to the gene∣ral rule—That pliant disposition which had yiel∣ded to the licentious love of William, stooped to still baser prostitution in company still more de∣praved.</P>
<P>At first she shuddered at those practices that she saw, at those conversations that she heard; and blest herself that poverty, not inclination, had caused her to be a witness of such things, and had condemned her in the vile abode to be a ser∣vant, rather, than in the lower rank of mistress. Use softened those horrors every day—at length
<PB N="63" REF="030623_0170_0FE83E1ADB169DB8"/>
self-defence, the fear of ridicule, and the hope of favour, induced her to adopt that very conduct from which her heart revolted.</P>
<P>In her sorrowful countenance, and fading charms, there yet remained attraction for many visitors—and she now submitted to the merce∣nary profanations of love; more odious, as her mind had been subdued by its most sacred and endearing joys.</P>
<P>While incessant regret whispered to her "she ought to have endured every calamity rather than this," she thus questioned her nice sense of wrong—"Why, why respect myself, while no other respects me? Why set a value on my own feelings, when no one else does?"</P>
<P>Degraded in her own judgment, she doubted her own understanding when it sometimes told her she had deserved better treatment—for she felt herself a fool in comparison with her learned seducer, and the rest who despised her. "And why," she continued, "should I ungratefully persist to contemn women, who alone are so kind as to accept me a companion? Why re-refuse conformity to their customs, while none of my sex besides, will admit me to their society a partaker of theirs?"</P>
<P>In speculation these arguments appeared rea∣sonable, and she pursued their dictates—but in the practice of the life in which she plunged, she
<PB N="64" REF="030623_0171_0FE7ECF6B74C6AF8"/>
proved the fallacy of the system; and at times tore her hair with frantic sorrow—that she did not continue in the mid-way of guilt, and so pre∣serve some little portion of self-approbation, to re∣compense her, in a small degree, for the total loss of the esteem of all the virtuous world.</P>
<P>But she had now gone too far to recede.—Could she have now recalled her innocence, even that part she brought with her to London, expe∣rience would have taught her to have given up her child, and have lived once more with the brute creation, and apart from him, rather than to have mingled with her present society. Now, alas! the time for flying was past—all prudent choice was over—even all reflection was gone for ever—or only admitted on compulsion, when it imperiously forced its way amidst the scenes of tumultuous mirth, of licentious passion, of dis∣tracted not, shameless effrontery, and wild in∣toxication—when it <HI>would</HI> force its way—even through the walls of a brothel.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>IS there a reader so little experienced in the hu∣man heart, so forgetful of his own as not to feel the possibility of the following fact?</P>
<P>A series of uncommon calamities had been for many years the lot of the elder Henry—a suc∣cession
<PB N="65" REF="030623_0172_0FE7ED0CF06C7FE8"/>
of prosperous events had fallen to the share of his brother William—The one was the envy, while the other had the compassion of all who thought about them. For the last twenty years William had lived in affluence, bordering upon splendour, his friends, his fame, his fortune daily encreasing; while Henry, throughout that very period, had, by degrees, lost all he loved on earth, and was now existing apart from civiliz∣ed society—and yet—during those twenty years, where William knew one happy moment, Hen∣ry tasted hundreds.</P>
<P>That the state of the mind, and not outward circumstances, is the nice point on which happi∣ness depends, is but a quaint remark: but that intellectual power should have the force to ren∣der a man discontented in extraordinary prospe∣rity, such as that of the present bishop, or con∣tented in his brother's extreme of adversity, re∣quires illustration.</P>
<P>The first great affliction to Henry was his brother's ingratitude; but reasoning on the frail∣ty of man's nature, and the power of man's temptations, he found excuses for William, which made him support the treatment he had received with more tranquillity, than William's proud mind supported his brother's marriage—Henry's indulgent disposition made him less angry with William, than William was with him.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="030623_0173_0FE83DD82639CFF8"/>
The next affliction Henry suffered, was the loss of his beloved wife—that was a grief which time and change of objects gradually alleviated; while William's wise was a permanent grief to him; her puerile mind, her talking vanity, her affected virtues soured his domestic comfort; and, in time, he had suffered more painful mo∣ments from her society, than his brother had ex∣perienced, even from the death of her he loved.</P>
<P>In their children, indeed, William was the happiest—his son was a pride and pleasure to him, while Henry never thought upon <HI>his</HI> with∣out lamenting his loss with bitterest anguish.—But if the elder brother had, in this instance, the advantage, still Henry had a resource to overba∣lance this article. Henry, as he lay imprisoned in his dungeon, and when, after his punishment was remitted, he was again allowed to wander and seeek his subsistance where he would; in all his tedious walks and solitary resting-places, during all his lonely days and mournful nights, had <HI>this resource</HI> to console him:</P>
<P>"I never did an injury to any one: never was harsh, severe, unkind, deceitful: I did not mere∣ly confine myself to do my neighbour no harm; I strove to serve him."</P>
<P>This was the resource that cheered his sink∣ing heart amidst gloomy deserts and a barbarous people; lulled him to peaceful slumber in the
<PB N="67" REF="030623_0174_0FE83E2B71C17128"/>
but of a savage hunter, and in the sound of the lion's roar; at times impressed him with a sense of happiness; and made him contemplate, with a longing hope, the retribution of a future world.</P>
<P>The bishop, with all his comforts, had no com∣fort like this—he had <HI>his</HI> solitary reflections too, but they were of a tendency the reverse of these. "I used my brother ill," was a secret thought of most powerful influence—it kept him waking upon his safe and commodious bed; was sure to recur with every misfortune by which he was threatened, to make his fears still stronger; and came, with invidious stabs, upon every successful event, to take from him a part of his joy.—In a word, it was <HI>conscience</HI> that made Henry's years pass happier than William's.</P>
<P>But though, comparatively with his brother, William was the less happy man, yet his self-reproach was not of such magnitude, for an of∣fence of that attrocious nature, as to banish a cer∣tain degree of happiness, and a sensibility to the smiles of fortune from his breast—nor was Hen∣ry's self-acquittal of such exquisite kind as to chase away the feeling of his desolate situa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</P>
<P>As he fished or hunted for his daily dinner, many a time in full view of his prey, a sudden burst of sorrow at his fate, a sudden longing for some dear society, for some friend to share his thoughts, for some kind shoulder on which to
<PB N="68" REF="030623_0175_0FE83CC4F3EA5820"/>
lean his head, for some companion to partake of his repast, would make him instantaneously de∣sist from his pursuit, cast him on the ground in a fit of anguish, till a shower of tears, and his <HI>con∣science</HI> came to his relief.</P>
<P>It was on a sultry morning, when, after plea∣sant dreams during the night, he had waked with more than usual perception of his misery; that, sitting upon the beach, his wishes and his looks all bent on the sea towards his native land, he thought he saw a sail swelling before an unex∣pected breeze.</P>
<P>"Sure I am dreaming still!" he cried. "This is the very vessel I saw last night in my sleep!—Oh! what cruel mockery, that my eyes should so deceive me!"</P>
<P>Yet, though he doubted, he leaped upon his feet in transport!—held up his hands, stretched at their length, in a kind of extatic joy!—and, as the glorious sight approached, was near rush∣ing into the sea to meet it.</P>
<P>For a while, hope and fear kept him in a state bordering on distraction.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be saw the ship making for the shore, and tears flowed for the grateful prospect. Now it made for another point, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d he vented shrieks and groans from the disappointment.</P>
<P>It was at those moments, while hope and fear thus possessed him, that the horrors of his abode
<PB N="69" REF="030623_0176_0FE83CDECD16BD10"/>
appeared more than ever frightful!—Inevitable afflictions must be borne; but that calamity which admits the expectation of relief, that is af∣terwards denied, is insupportable.</P>
<P>After a few minutes passed in dreadful uncer∣tainty, which enhanced the wished-for happiness, the ship evidently drew near the land—a boat was launched from her—and while Henry, now upon his knees, wept, and prayed fervently for the event, a youth sprang from the barge on the strand, rushed towards him, and falling on his neck, then at his feet, exclaimed—"My father! oh! my father!"</P>
<P>William! Dean! Bishop! What are your honours, what your riches, what all your posses∣sions, compared to the happiness, the transport bestowed by this one sentence, on your poor bro∣ther Henry?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE crosses at land, and the perilous events at sea, had made it now several years, since young Henry first took the vow of a man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dependent on the will of another, to seek his fa∣ther. His fatigues, his dangers were well recom∣pensed! Instead of weeping over a silent grave, he had the inexpressible joy to receive a parent's blessing for his labours. Yet, the elder Henry,
<PB N="70" REF="030623_0177_0FE83E4D47C08AF8"/>
though living, was so changed in person, that his son would scarcely have known him in any other than the favourite spot, which the younger (keep∣ing in memory every incident of his former life) knew his father had always chosen for his morn∣ing contemplations; and where, previously to his coming to England, he had many a time kept him company. It was to that particular corner of the island that the captain of the ship had generously ordered they should steer, out of the general route, to gratify the filial tenderness he expressed. But scarcely had the interview be∣tween the father and son taken place, than a band of natives, whom the appearance of the vessel had called from the woods and hills, came to at∣tack the invaders. The elder Henry had no friend with whom he wished to shake hands at his departure; the old negro servant who had as∣sisted in young Henry's escape was dead; and he experienced the excessive joy of bidding adieu to a place, without one regret for all he left behind.</P>
<P>On the night of that day, whose morning had been marsted by peculiar sadness, at the louring prospect of many exiled years to come; he slept on board an English vessel, with Englishmen his companions, and his son, his beloved son—who was still more dear to him for that mind which had planned and executed his rescue—his atten∣tive servant, and most affectionate friend.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="030623_0178_0FE83D1C4AAD0458"/>
Though many a year passed, and many a rough encounter was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the lot of the two Henrys before they saw the shores of Eu∣rope, yet to them, to live or to die together was happiness enough—even young Henry, for a time, asked for no greater blessing—but, the first glow of filial ardor over, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to mind, "Rebecca lived in England; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every exer∣tion which love, founded on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghest reverence and esteem, could dictate, he employed to expe∣dite a voyage, the end of which would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the sight of her.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE contrast of the state of happiness be∣tween the two brothers, was nearly resembled by that of the two cousins—the riches of young Wil∣liam did not render him happy, nor did the pover∣ty of young Henry doom him to misery. His af∣fectionate heart, as he had described in his letter to Rebecca, loved <HI>persons</HI> rather than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and he would not have exchanged the society <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his father, or the prospect of her hand and heart, for all the wealth and finery of which his cousin William was the master.</P>
<P>He was right. Young William, though he viewed with contempt Henry's inferior state, was far less happy than he—His marriage had been
<PB N="72" REF="030623_0179_0FE83DDECC9C64C0"/>
the very counterpart of his father's; and hav∣ing no child to create affection to his home, his study was the only relief from the domestic in∣cumbrance, his wife: and though by unremit∣ting application their (joined to the influence of the potent relations of the woman he hated) he at length arrived at the summit of his ambitious desires, still they poorly repaid him, for the sacri∣fice he had made in early life, of every tender disposition.</P>
<P>Striding through a lift of rapid advancements, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the profession of the law, at the age of thirty-eight, he found himself raised to preferment, such as rarely falls to the share of a man of his short experience—he found himself invested with a judge's robe; and, gratified by the exalted office, curbed more than ever that aversion, which her want of charms or sympathy had produced, a∣gainst the partner of his honours.</P>
<P>While William had thus been daily rising in fortune's favour, poor Hannah had been daily sinking deeper and deeper under fortune's frowns: till at fast she became a midnight wanderer through the streets of London, soliciting, or rude∣ly demanding money of the passing stranger.—Sometimes, hunted by the watch, she affrighted fled from street to street,—from portico to portico—and once, unknowing in her fear which way she hurried, she found her trembling
<PB N="73" REF="030623_0180_0FE83CBE230057A8"/>
knees had sunk, and her wearied head was re∣clined, against the pillars that guarded Willi∣am's door.</P>
<P>At the sudden recollection where she was, a swell of passion, composed of horror, of despair, and love, gave re-animated strength to her fail∣ing limbs; and, regardless of her pursuers' steps, she ran to the centre of the street, and looking up to the windows of the house, cried, "Ah! there he sleeps in quiet, in peace, in ease—he does not even dream of me—he does not care how the cold pierces, or how the people persecute me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ He does not thank me for all the lavish love I have borne him and his child!—His heart is so hard, he does not even recollect that it was he who brought me to ruin."</P>
<P>Had these miseries, common to the unhappy prostitute, been alone the punishment of Hannah—had her crimes and sufferings ended in distress like this, her story had not perhaps been selected for a public recital; for it had been no other than the customary history of thousands of her sex. But Hannah had a destiny yet more severe.—Unhappily, she was endowed with a mind so sen∣sibly alive to every joy, and every sorrow, to every mark of kindness, every token of severity; so liable to excess in passion, that once perverted, there was no degree of error from which it would with firmness revolt.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="030623_0181_0FE83D2392C724E8"/>
Taught by the conversation of the dissolute poor, with whom she now associated, or by her own observation on the worldly reward of ele∣vated villainy, she began to suspect, "that dis∣honesty was only held a sin, to secure the pro∣perty of the rich; and that, to take from those who did not want, by the art of stealing, was less guilt, than to take from those who did want, by the power of the law."</P>
<P>By false, yet seducing opinions such as these, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reason, estranged from every moral and reli∣gious tie, her necessities urgent, she reluctantly accepted the proposal, to mix with a band of practised sharpers and robbers; and became an accomplice in negotiating bills forged on a coun∣try banker.</P>
<P>But though ingenious in arguments to excuse the deed before its commission; in the act, she had the dread of some uncontrovertible statement on the other side of the question. Intimidated by this conviction, she was the veriest bungler in her vile profession—and on the alarm of being detected, while every one of her confederates es∣caped and absconded, she alone was seized—was arrested for issuing notes they had fabricated, and committed to the provincial jail, about fifty miles from London, where the crime was perpetrated, to take her trial for—life or death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XL.</HEAD>
<P>THE day at length come, on which Han∣nah shall have a sight of her beloved William!—She, who has watched for hours near his door, to procure a glimpse of him going out, or return∣ing home; who has walked miles to see his cha∣riot pass; she now will behold him, and he will see her, by the command of the laws of their country—Those laws that will deal with rigour towards her, in this one instance are still indul∣gent.</P>
<P>The time of the assizes, at the county-town in which she is imprisoned, is arrived—the pri∣soners are demanded at the shire-hall—the jail doors are opened—they go in sad procession.—The trumpet sounds—it speaks the arrival of the judge—and that judge is William.</P>
<P>The day previous to her trial, Hannah had read, in the printed calendar of the prisoners, his name, as the learned justice before whom she was to appear. For a moment she forgot her perilous state in the excess of joy, which the still unconquerable love she bore to him, permitted her to taste even on the brink of the grave!—After-reflection made her check those worldly transports, as unfit for the present solemn occa∣sion. But alas! to her, earth and William were so closely united, that, till she forsook the
<PB N="76" REF="030623_0183_0FE83DBEDC140CA0"/>
one, she could never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ase to think, without the contending passions of hope, of fear, of joy, of love, of shame, and of despair, on the other.</P>
<P>Now fear took place of her first immoderate joy—she feared, that although much changed in person since he had seen her, and her real name now added to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y an <HI>alias</HI>—yet she feared that some well-known glance of the eye, turn of the action, or accent of speech, might recall her to his remembrance; and at that idea shame over∣came all her other sensations—for still she re∣turned pride, in respect to <HI>his</HI> opinion, to wish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to know, Hannah was that wretch she felt she was!—Once a ray of hope beamed on her, "that if he knew her, if he recognised her, he might possibly befriend her cause"—and life bestowed through William's friendship seemed a precious object!—But again, that rigorous ho∣nour she had often heard him boast, that firm∣ness to his word, of which she had fatal expe∣rience, taught her to know, he would not for any improper compassion, any unmanly weak∣ness, forfeit his oath of impartial justice.</P>
<P>In meditations such as these she passed the sleepless night.</P>
<P>When, in the morning, she was brought to the bar, and her guilty hand held up before the righteous judgment-seat of William; imagina∣tion could not form two figures, or two situa∣tions
<PB N="77" REF="030623_0184_0FE83CF159D23AC0"/>
more incompatible with the existence of former familiarity, than the judge and the cul∣prit—and yet, these very persons had passed toge∣ther the most blissful moments that either ever tasted!—Those hours of tender dalliance were now present to <HI>her</HI> mind—<HI>His</HI> thoughts were more more nobly employed in his high office—nor could the haggard face, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ow eye, despon∣ding countenance, and meagre person of the poor prisoner, once call to his memory, though her name was uttered among a list of others that she had assumed, his former youthful lovely Hannah!</P>
<P>She heard herself arraigned with trembling limbs and downcast looks—and many witnesses had appeared against her, before she ventured to lift her eyes up to her awful judge.—She then gave one fearful glance, and discovered William, unpitying, but beloved William, in every fea∣feature! It was a face she had been used to look on with delight, and a kind of absent smile of gladness, now beamed on her poor wan visage.</P>
<P>When every witness on the part of the prose∣cutor had been examined, the judge addressed himself to her,</P>
<P>"What defence have you to make?"</P>
<P>It was William spoke to Hannah!—The sound was sweet—the voice was mild, was soft, compassionate, encouraging!—It almost charm∣ed
<PB N="78" REF="030623_0185_0FE83DC75575CE10"/>
her to a love of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not such a voice as when William last addressed her; when he left her un∣done and pregnant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>wing "never to see or speak to her more."</P>
<P>She could have hung upon the present words for ever! She did not call to mind that this gen∣tleness was the effect of practice, the art of his occupation: which at times, is but a copy, by the unfeeling, from his benevolent brothers of the bench.—In the present judge, tenderness was not designed for the culprit's consolation, but for the approbation of the auditors.</P>
<P>There were no spectators, Hannah, by your side when last he parted from you—if there had, the awful William had been awed to marks of pity.</P>
<P>Stunned with the enchantment of that well-known tongue directed to her, she stood like one just petrified—all vital power was suspended.</P>
<P>Again he put the question, and with these ad∣ditional sentences, tenderly and emphatically de∣livered—"Recollect yourself—Have you no witnesses? No proof in your behalf?"</P>
<P>A dead silence followed these questions.</P>
<P>He then mildly, but forcibly, added—"What have you to say?"</P>
<P>Here, a flood of tears burst from her eyes, which she fixed earnestly upon him, as if plead∣ing for mercy, while she faintly articulated,</P>
<P>"Nothing, my Lord."</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="030623_0186_0FE83E02679F6308"/>
After a short pause, he asked her, in the same forcible but benevolent tone,</P>
<P>"Have you no one to speak for your charac∣ter?"</P>
<P>The prisoner answered,</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>A second gush of tears followed this reply, for she called to mind by <HI>whom,</HI> her character had first been blasted.</P>
<P>He summed up the evidence—and every time he was compelled to press hard upon the proofs against her, she shrunk, and seemed to stagger with the deadly blow—writhed under the weight of <HI>his</HI> minute justice, more than from the pros∣pect of a shameful death.</P>
<P>The jury consulted but a few minutes—the verdict was—</P>
<P>"Guilty."</P>
<P>She heard it with composure.</P>
<P>But when William placed the fatal velvet on his head, and rose to pronounce her sentence—she started with a kind of convulsive motion—retrea∣ted a step or two back, and lifting up her hands, with a scream exclaimed—</P>
<P>"Oh! not from <HI>you!</HI>"</P>
<P>The piercing shriek which accompanied these words, prevented their being heard by part of the audience; and those who heard them, thought little of their meaning, more, than that they ex∣pressed her fear of dying.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="030623_0187_0FE83DA62CAAC8B0"/>
Serene, and dignified, as if no such exclama∣tion had been uttered, William delivered the fa∣tal speech, ending with—"Dead, dead, dead."</P>
<P>She fainted as he closed the period, and was carried back to prison in a swoon; while he ad∣journed the court to go to dinner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLI.</HEAD>
<P>IF, unaffected by the scene he had witnessed, William sat down to dinner with an appetite, let not the reader conceive, that the most distant idea had struck his mind—of his ever having seen, much less familiarly known, the poor offender whom he had just condemned. Still this forget∣fulness did not proceed from the want of memory for Hannah—In every peevish or heavy hour passed with his wife, he was sure to think of her—yet, it was self-love, rather than love of <HI>her,</HI> that gave rise to these thoughts—he felt the want of female sympathy and tenderness, to sof∣ten the fatigue of studious labour; to soothe a sullen, a morose disposition—he felt he wanted comfort for himself, but never once considered what Hannah's wants were.</P>
<P>In the chagrin of a barren bed, he sometimes thought, too, even on the child that Hannah bore him; but whether it were male or female, whe∣ther a beggar in the streets, or dead—various
<PB N="81" REF="030623_0188_0FE83D2BF64D9C80"/>
and important public occupations, forbade him to waste time to enquire. Yet the poor, the wi∣dow, and the orphan, frequently shared Wil∣liam's ostentatious bounty. He was the presi∣dent of many excellent charities; gave largely; and sometimes instituted benevolent societies for the unhappy: for he delighted to load the poor with obligations, and the rich with praise.</P>
<P>There are persons like him, who love to do every good, but that which their immediate duty requires—There are servants who will serve every one more cheerfully than their masters—There are men who will distribute money libe∣rally to all, except their creditors—And there are wives who will love any man better than their husbands.—<HI>Duty</HI> is a familiar word which has little effect upon an ordinary mind: and as ordinary minds are in a vast majority, we have acts of generosity, valour, self-denial, and boun∣ty, where smaller pains would constitute greater virtues.—Had William followed the <HI>common</HI> dictates of charity; had he adopted private pity, instead of public munificence: had he cast an eye at home, before he sought abroad for objects of compassion, Hannah had been preserved from an ignominious death, and he had been preserved from—<HI>remorse:</HI> the tortures of which, he for the first time proved, on reading a printed sheet of paper thrown accidentally in his way, a few

days after he had left the town in which he had condemned her to die.</P>

<P>The last dying words, speech, and confession; birth, parentage, and education: life, charac∣ter, and behaviour, of Hannah Primrose, who was executed, this morning, between the hours of ten and twelve, pursuant to the sentence passed upon her by the Honourable Justice Norwynne.</P>
<P>HANNAH PRIMROSE was born of honest parents, in the village of Anfield, in the county of—[William started at the name of the village and county] but being led astray by the arts and flattery of seducing man, she fell from the paths of virtue, premeditated many ho∣rid crimes, and took to bad company, which in∣stilled into her young heart all their evil practices, and at length brought her to this untimely end. So she hopes her death will be a warning to all young persons of her own sex, how they listen to the praises and courtship of young men, especi∣ally of those who are their betters; for they on∣ly court to deceive—But the said Hannah, freely forgives all persons who have done her injury, or given her sorrow, from the young man who first won her heart, to the jury who found her guilty, and the judge who condemned her to death.</P>
<P>And she acknowledges the justice of her sen∣tence,
<PB N="83" REF="030623_0190_0FE83D141026FE98"/>
not only in respect of the crime for which she suffers, but in regard to many other heinous sins of which she has been guilty, more especially that of once attempting to commit a murder upon her own helpless child, for which guilt she now considers the vengeance of God has overtaken her, to which she is patiently resigned, and parts in peace and charity with all the world, praying the Lord to have mercy on her poor departing soul.</P>

<P><HI>Postcript to the Confession.</HI></P>
<P>So great was this unhappy woman's terror of death, and the awful judgment that was to follow, that when sentence, was pronounced up∣on her, she fell into a swoon, from that into con∣vulsions, from which she never entirely recover∣ed, but was delirious to the time of her execu∣tion, except that short interval in which she made her confession to the clergyman who at∣tended her. She has left one child, a youth about sixteen, who has never forsaken his mother dur∣ing all the time of her imprisonment, but with true filial duty waited on her—and no sooner was her fatal sentence passed, than he began to droop, and now lies dangerously ill near the pri∣son from which she is released by death—Dur∣ing the loss of her senses, the said Hannah raved continually on this child—and, asking for pen, ink, and paper, wrote an incoherent petition to
<PB N="84" REF="030623_0191_0FE83DAE6F70B6E0"/>
the judge, recommending the youth to his protec∣tion and mercy. But notwithstanding this in∣sanity she behaved with composure and resigna∣tion, when the fatal period arrived that she was to be launched into eternity. She prayed de∣voutly during the last hour, and seemed to have her whole mind fixed on the world to which she was going—A crowd of spectators followed her to the fatal spot, most of whom returned weeping at the recollection of the fervency with which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prayed, and the impression which her dread∣ful state seemed to make upon her.</P>

<P>No sooner had the name of "Anfield" struck William, than a thousand reflections and remem∣brances flashed on his mind to give him convic∣tion, whom he had judged and sentenced. He recollected the sad remains of Hannah, such as he once had known her—and now he wondered how his thoughts could have been absent from an object so pitiable, so worthy of his attention, as not to give him even a suspicion who she was, either from her name, or from her person, during the whole trial!</P>
<P>But wonder, astonishment, horror, and every other sensation, was absorbed in—<HI>Remorse:</HI>—It wounded, it stabbed, it rent his hard heart, as it would do a tender one—It havocked on his firm inflexible mind, as it would on a weak and pliant brain!—Spirit of Hannah! Look down

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLII.</HEAD>
<P>A FEW momentary cessations from the pangs of a guilty conscience were given to Wil∣liam, as soon as he had dispatched a messenger to the jail in which Hannah had been confined, to enquire after the son she had left behind, and to give orders that immediate care should be taken of his health and safety—He likewise charged the messenger to convey back to him the petition she had addressed to him during her supposed insani∣ty; for it was now no trivial consolation to him that he might possibly have it in his power to grant a request from her.</P>
<P>The messenger returned with the written pa∣per, which had been considered by the persons to whom she had entrusted it, as the distracted sen∣tences of an insane mind; but to William they proved beyond a doubt, that she was perfectly in her senses.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<P><PB N="86" REF="030623_0193_0FE83D3CE57EE080"/>
Pray, my lord, have mercy on my sorrows, pity me for the first time, and spare my life. I know I have done wrong—I know it is presump∣tion in me to dare to apply to you, such a wick∣ed and mean wreath as I am; but, my lord, you once condescended to take notice of me—and though I have been very wicked since that time, yet if you would be so merciful as to spare my life, I promise to amend it for the future. But if you think it proper I should die, I will be resign∣ed; but then I hope, I beg, I supplicate, that you will grant my other petition.—Pray, pray, my lord, if you cannot pardon me, be merciful to the child I leave behind—What he will do when I am gone, I don't know—for I have been only the friend he has had ever since he was born.—He was born, my lord, about sixteen years ago, at Anfield, one summer's morning, and carried by your cousin, Mr. Henry Norwynne, to Mr. Ry∣mer's, the curate there—and I swore whose child he was, before the dean, and I did not take a false oath. Indeed, indeed, my lord, I did not.</P>
<P>I will say no more for fear this should not come safe to your hand, for the people treat me as if I were mad—so I will say no more, only this, that, whether I live or die, I forgive every body, and I hope every body will forgive me—and I pray that God will take pity on my son if you refuse: but I hope you will not refuse.</P>

William rejoiced, as he laid down the petition, that she had asked a favour he could bestow; and hoped, by his protection of the son, to redress, in a degree, the wrongs he had done the mother. He instantly sent for the messenger into his apart∣ment, and impatiently asked, "If he had seen the boy, and given proper directions for his care?"</P>
<P>"I have given directions, Sir, for his funeral."</P>
<P>"How!" cried William.</P>
<P>"He pined away ever since his mother was confined, and died two days after her execution."</P>
<P>Robbed, by this news, of his only gleam of consolation—in the consciousness of having done a mortal injury, for which he never now, by any means could atone—he saw all his honours, all his riches, all his proud selfish triumphs dance before him! They seemed like airy nothings, which in rapture he would exchange for the peace of a tranquil conscience!</P>
<P>He envied Hannah the death to which he ex∣posed, then condemned her—He envied her even the life she struggled through from his neglect—and felt, that his future days would be far less happy, than her former existence. He calcula∣ted with precision.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE progressive rise of William, and fall of Hannah, had now occupied nearly the term of
<PB N="88" REF="030623_0195_0FE83DF9F3E3BCB8"/>
of eighteen years—added to these, another year elapsed before the younger Henry completed the errand on which his heart was fixed. Shipwreck, imprisonment, and ills to which the poor and un∣friended traveller is peculiarly exposed, detained the father and son in various remote regions un∣til the present period; and for the last fifteen years, denied them the means of all correspon∣dence with their own country.</P>
<P>The elder Henry was now past sixty years of age, and the younger almost beyond the prime of life. Still length of time had not diminished, but rather had increased their anxious longings for their native home.</P>
<P>The sorrows, disappointments, and fatigues that throughout these tedious years were endur∣ed by the two Henrys, are of that dull monoto∣nous kind of suffering, better omitted than de∣scribed: mere repetitions of the exile's woe, that shall give place to the transporting joy, of re∣turn from banishment!—Yet, much as the younger had reckoned with impatient wishes, the hours that were passed distant from her he loved, no sooner was his disastrous voyage at an end, and his feet trod upon the shores of Eng∣land, than a thousand wounding fears made him almost doubt, whether it were happiness or mi∣sery he had obtained by his arrival. If Rebecca were living, he knew it must be happiness—for
<PB N="89" REF="030623_0196_0FE83D1AC3492408"/>
his heart dwelt with confidence on her faith—her unchanging sentiments. "But death might possibly have ravished from his hopes what no mortal power could have done." And thus the lover creates a rival in every ill, rather than suf∣fer his fears to remain inanimate.</P>
<P>The elder Henry had less to fear or to hope than his son—yet he both feared and hoped with a sensibility that gave him inexpressible anxiety. He hoped his brother would receive him with kindness, after his long absence, and once more take his son cordially to his favour. He longed impatiently to behold his brother; to see his ne∣phew; nay, in the ardour of the renewed affection he just now felt, he thought even a distant view of Lady Clementina would be grateful to his sight! But still, well remembering the pomp, the state, the pride of William, he could not rely on <HI>his</HI> affection, so much he knew that it depen∣ded on external circumstances to excite, or to ex∣tinguish his love. Not that he feared an abso∣lute repulsion from his brother; but he feared, what, to a delicate mind, is still worse—Reserv∣ed manners, cold looks, absent sentences, and all the cruel retinue of indifference, with which those who are beloved, so often wound the bosom that adores them.</P>
<P>By enquiring of their countrymen (whom they met as they approached to the end of their
<PB N="90" REF="030623_0197_0FE7ECFEE41AC858"/>
voyage) concerning their relation, the dean, the two Henrys learned that he was well, and had for some years past been exalted to the bishopric of * * *. This news gave them joy, while it encreased their fear of not receiving a familiar welcome.</P>
<P>The younger Henry, on his landing, wrote immediately to his uncle, acquainting him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> father's arrival in the most abject state of po∣verty: he addressed his letter to the bishop's country residence, where he knew, as it was the summer season, he would certainly be: He and his father then set off on foot, towards that resi∣dence—a palace!</P>
<P>The bishop's palace was not situated above fifty miles from the port where they had landed: and at a small inn about three miles from the bishop's, they proposed (as the letter to him in∣timated) to wait for his answer, before they in∣truded into his presence.</P>
<P>At the town where they came on shore, and as they walked on their journey, though it was somewhat solitary, that they knew no creature whom they met or saw, yet it was no small consolation, that no creature knew them.</P>
<P>"To be poor and ragged, father," the youn∣yer smilingly said, "is no disgrace, no shame, thank heaven, where the object is not known."</P>
<P>"True, my son," replied Henry, "and per∣haps
<PB N="91" REF="030623_0198_0FE83E5E2CE54558"/>
I feel myself much happier now, unknow∣ing and unknown to all but you, than I shall in the presence of my fortunate brother and his fa∣mily: for there, confusion at my ill success through life, may give me greater pain, than even my misfortunes have inflicted."</P>
<P>After uttering this reflection that had preyed upon his mind, he sat down on the road side to rest his discomfited limbs, before he could pro∣ceed farther. His son reasoned with him; gave him courage; and now his hopes preponderated; till after two day's journey, on arriving at the inn where an answer from the bishop was expec∣ted, no letter, no message had been left.</P>
<P>"He means to renounce us," said Henry, trembling and whispering to his son.</P>
<P>Without disclosing to the people of the house who they were, or from whom the letter or the message they enquired for was to have come, they retired, and consulted what steps they were now to pursue.</P>
<P>Previously to his writing to the bishop, the younger Henry's heart, all his inclinations, had swayed him towards a visit to the village in which was his uncle's former country seat—the beloved village of Anfield—but, respect and du∣ty to him had made him check those wishes—now, they revived again—and with the image of Rebecca before his eyes, he warmly entreated
<PB N="92" REF="030623_0199_0FE83E57281FF130"/>
his father to go with him to Anfield, at present only thirty miles distance, and from thence, write once more—then wait the will of his uncle.</P>
<P>The father consented to this proposal, even glad to postpone the visit to his dignified brother.</P>
<P>After a scanty repast, such as they had been long innured to, they quitted the inn, and took the road towards Anfield.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="44" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>IT was about five in the afternoon of a sum∣mer's day, that Henry and his son left the sign of the Mermaid, and began their third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> jour∣ney: the young man's spirits elated with the prospect of the reception he should meet from Rebecca; the elder dejected, at not receiving a welcome from his brother.</P>
<P>The road which led to Anfield necessarily took our travellers within sight of the bishop's palace—the turrets appeared at a distance—and on the sudden turn round the corner of a large plantation, the whole magnificent structure was at once exhibited, before his brother's astonished eyes! He was struck with the grandeur of the habitation—and, totally forgetting all the un∣kind, the contemptuous treatment he had ever received from its owner (like the same Henry in
<PB N="93" REF="030623_0200_0FE83E790113C1C0"/>
his earlier years) smiled with a kind of transport "that William was so great a man."</P>
<P>After this first joyous sensation was over, "Let us go a little nearer, my son," said he, "no one will see us I hope: or if they should, you can run and conceal yourself; and not a creature will know <HI>me</HI>—even my brother would not know me thus altered—and I wish to take a little farther view of his fine house, and all his pleasure grounds.</P>
<P>Young Henry, though impatient to be gone, would not object to his father's desire.—They walked forward between a shady grove and a curling rivulet, snuffed in odours from the jessamine banks, and listened to the melody of an ad∣joining aviary.</P>
<P>The allurements of the spot seemed to enchain the elder Henry, and he at length sauntered to the ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> avenue of the dwelling: but, just as he had set his daring, yet trembling feet, upon the turf that led to the palace gates, he suddenly stopped, on hearing, as he thought, the village clock strike seven; which reminded him, that evening drew on, and it was time to go.—He listened again—when he and his son, both together said, "it is the toll of the bell before some funeral."</P>
<P>The signals of death, while they humble the rich, inspire the poor with pride.—The passing-bell gave Henry a momentary sense of equality,
<PB N="94" REF="030623_0201_0FE83E68014FC120"/>
and he courageously stept forward to the first winding of the avenue.</P>
<P>He darted back at the sight which presented itself!</P>
<P>A hearse—mourning coaches—mutes—plu∣med horses—with every other token of the per∣son's importance, who was going to be commit∣mitted to the earth.</P>
<P>Scarce had his terrified eyes been thus unex∣pectedly struck—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, borne by six men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the gates, and was deposited in the waiting receptacle; while gentlemen in mourn∣ing went into the different coaches.</P>
<P>A standard-bearer now appeared with an es∣cutcheon, on which the keys and mitre were dis∣played. Young Henry, upon this, pathetically exclaimed,</P>
<P>"My uncle!—It is my uncle's funeral!"</P>
<P>Henry, his father, burst into tears.</P>
<P>The procession moved along.</P>
<P>The two Henry's, the only real mourners in the train, followed at a little distance—in rags, but in tears.</P>
<P>The elder Henry's heart was nearly bursting—he longed to clasp the dead corpse of his bro∣ther, without the dread of being spurned for his presumption.—He now could no longer remem∣ber him either as the dean, or bishop; but leap∣ing over that whole interval of pride and arro∣gance,
<PB N="95" REF="030623_0202_0FE83E55A3CB9EB8"/>
called only to his memory William, such as he knew him when they lived at home toge∣ther, together walked to London, and there, to∣gether, almost perished for want.</P>
<P>They arrived at the church—and while the cof∣fin was placing in the dreary vault, Henry crept slowly after to the hideous spot—His reflections now took a different point. "Is this possible?" he said to himself, "Is this the dean whom I ever feared? Is this the bishop of whom, within the present hour, I stood in awe? Is this Wil∣liam, whose every glance struck me with his su∣periority? Alas! my brother, and is this horrid abode the return for all your aspiring efforts? Is this the only remains of your greatness, which you exhibit to me on my return? Did you fore∣see an end like this, while you treated me, and many more of your youthful companions, with haughtiness and contempt? While you thought it becoming of your dignity to shun and despise us? Where is the difference now between my departed wife and you? or, if there be a differ∣ence, she, perchance has the advantage.—Ah! my poor brother, for distinction in the other world, I trust, some of your anxious labours have been employed; for you are now of less im∣portance in this, than when you and I first left our native town, and hoped for nothing greater, than to be suffered to exist."</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="030623_0203_0FE83E5FB3C7C878"/>
On their quitting the church, they enquired of the by-standers, particulars of the bishop's death, and heard he had been suddenly carried off by a raging fever.</P>
<P>Young Henry enquired "If Lady Clementina was at the palace, or Mr. Norwynne?"</P>
<P>"The latter is there"—he was answered by a poor woman, "but Lady Clementina has been dead these four years."</P>
<P>"Dead! dead!" cried young Henry, "That worldly woman, quitted this world forever!"</P>
<P>"Yes," answered the stranger, "she caught cold by wearing a new-fashioned dress that did not half cover her, wasted all away, and died the miserablest object you ever heard of."</P>
<P>The person who gave this melancholy intelli∣gence concluded it with a hearty laugh; which would have surprised the two hearers, if they had not before observed—that amongst all the village crowd that attended to see this solemn show, not one afflicted countenance appeared, not one de∣jected look, not one watery eye. The pastor was scarcely known to his flock—it was in Lon∣don his meridian lay—at the levee of ministers—at the table of peers—at the drawing-rooms of the great—and now his neglected parishioners, paid his indifference in kind.</P>
<P>The ceremony over, and the mourning suite departed, the spectators dispersed with smiling
<PB N="97" REF="030623_0204_0FE83E7775A093A0"/>
faces from the sad spot; while the Henrys, with heavy hearts, retraced their steps back towards the palace.—In their way, at the crossing of a stilt, they met a poor labourer returning from his day's work; who looking earnestly at the throng of persons who were leaving the church∣yard, said to the elder Henry,</P>
<P>"Pray, master, what are all them folk gather∣ed together about? What's the matter there?"</P>
<P>"There has been a funeral," replied Henry.</P>
<P>"Oh zooks, what! a burying!—ay, now I see it is—and I warrant, of our old bishop—I heard he was main ill—It is he, they have been putting into the ground is not it?"</P>
<P>"Yes," said Henry.</P>
<P>"Why then so much the better."</P>
<P>"The better!" cried Henry.</P>
<P>"Yes, master—though, I should be loath to be, where he is now."</P>
<P>Henry started—"He was your pastor, man."</P>
<P>"Ha ha ha—I should be sorry that my mas∣ter's sheep that are feeding yonder, should have no better pastor—the fox would soon get them all.</P>
<P>"You surely did not know him!"</P>
<P>"Not much, I can't say I did—for he was above speaking to poor folks—unless they did any mischief, and then he was sure to take notice of them."</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="030623_0205_0FE83EA169E4CEC8"/>
"I believe he meant well," said Henry.</P>
<P>"As to what he meant, God only knows—but I know what he <HI>did.</HI>"</P>
<P>"And what did he?"</P>
<P>"Nothing at all for the poor."</P>
<P>"If any of them applied to him, no doubt—"</P>
<P>"Oh! they knew better than all that comes to—for if they asked for any thing, he was sure to have them sent to bridewell, or the workhouse.—He used to say—"<HI>The workhouse was a fine place for a poor man—the food good enough, and enough of it—</HI>" yet he kept a dainty table him∣self. His dogs, too, fared better than we poor. He was vastly tender and good to all his horses and dogs, I <HI>will</HI> say that for him: and to all brute beasts: he would not suffer them to be either starved or struck—but he had no compas∣sion for his fellow creatures."</P>
<P>"I am sensible you do him wrong."</P>
<P>"That <HI>he</HI> is the best judge of by this time.—He has sent many a poor man to the house of cor∣rection—and now 'tis well, if he has not got a place there himself. Ha ha ha!"</P>
<P>"Did he give nothing in charity?"</P>
<P>"Next to nothing. A little weak broth, that runs through one's stomach like mad—a working man, master, can't live on such mess—and my wife wore out more shoe leather going after it, and lost more time waiting at the door before his
<PB N="99" REF="030623_0206_0FE83E6F29B14378"/>
fat servants would bring it her, than the thing was worth.—However, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we should not speak ill of the dead, I say nothing aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> him. So good night, master."</P>
<P>The man was walking away, when Henry called to him—"Pray can you tell me if the bi∣shop's son is at the palace?"</P>
<P>"Oh yes, you'll find master there, treading in the old man's shoes, as proud as Lucifer!"</P>
<P>"Has he any children?"</P>
<P>"No, please God! There's been enough of the name—and after the son is gone, I hope we shall have no more of the breed."</P>
<P>"Is Mrs. Norwynne, the son's wife, at the palace?"</P>
<P>"What, master, did not you know what's become of her?"</P>
<P>"Any accident—"</P>
<P>"Ha ha ha—yes. I can't help laughing—why, master, she made a mistake, and went to another man's bed—and so her husband and she were parted—and she has married the other man."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" cried Henry amazed.</P>
<P>"Ay, indeed—but if it had been my wife or yours, the bishop would have made her do pe∣nance in a white sheet—but as it was a lady, why, it was all very well—and any one of us, that had been known to talk about it, would
<PB N="100" REF="030623_0207_0FE83E97B8FF5AB8"/>
have been sent to bridewell straight.—But we <HI>did</HI> talk, notwithstanding."</P>
<P>The malicious joy with which the peasant told this story, made Henry believe (more than all the complaints the man uttered) that there had been want of charity and christian deportment, in the conduct of the bishop's family. He almost wished himself back on his savage island, where brotherly love could not be less, than it appeared to be in this civilised country.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLV.</HEAD>
<P>AS Henry and his son, after parting from the poor labourer, approached the late bishop's pa∣lace, all the charms of its magnificence, its situ∣ation, which, but a few hours before, had capti∣vated the elder Henry's mind, was vanished—and, from the mournful ceremony he had since been witness of, he now viewed this noble edi∣fice, but as a heap of rubbish piled together to fascinate weak understandings; and to make even the wise and religious man, at times, forget why he was sent into this world.</P>
<P>Instead of presenting themselves to their ne∣phew and cousin, they both felt an unconquera∣ble reluctance to enter under the superb, the me∣lancholy roof—a bank, a hedge, a tree, a hill, seemed at this juncture a pleasanter shelter: and
<PB N="101" REF="030623_0208_0FE83E70AEA901E0"/>
each felt himself happy in being a harmless wan∣derer on the face of the earth, rather than living in splendor, while the wants, the revilings of the hungry and the naked, were crying to heaven for vengeance.</P>
<P>They gave a heart-felt sigh to the vanity of the rich and powerful; and pursued a path where they hoped to meet with virtue and happiness.</P>
<P>They arrived at Anfield.</P>
<P>Possessed by apprehensions, which his uncle's funeral had served to encrease, young Henry, as he entered the well-known village, feared every sound he heard would convey intelligence of Rebecca's death. He saw the parsonage house at a distance, but dreaded to approach it, lest Re∣becca should no longer be an inhabitant.—His father indulged him in the wish to take a short survey of the village, and rather learn by indi∣rect means, by observation, his fate, than hear it all at once from the lips of some blunt relater.</P>
<P>Anfield had undergone great changes since Henry left it.—He found some cottages raised where formerly there were none; and some were no more, where he had frequently called, and held short conversations, with the poor who dwelt in them. Amongst the latter number was the house of Hannah's parents—fallen to the ground! He wondered to himself where the poor family had taken up their abode? Henry, in a kinder world!</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="030623_0209_0FE83EA2EFD24F40"/>
He once again cast a look at the parsonage house—his inquisitive eye informed him, there, no alteration had taken place externally—but he feared what change might be within.</P>
<P>At length he obtained the courage to enter the church yard in his way to it.—As he slowly and tremblingly moved along, he stopped to read here and there a grave-stone; as mild, instruc∣tive, conveyers of intelligence, to which he could attend with more resignation, than to any other reporter.</P>
<P>The second stone he came to, he found was erected <HI>To the memory of the Reverend Thomas Rymer.</HI> Rebecca's father. He instantly called to mind all that poor curate's quick sensibility of wrong, towards <HI>himself;</HI> his unbridled rage in consequence; aud smiled to think—how trivial now appeared all, for which he gave way to such excess of passion.</P>
<P>But, shocked at the death of one so near to her he loved, he now feared to read on; and acciden∣tally cast his eyes from the tombs to the church. Through the window of the chancel, his sight was struck with a tall monument of large di∣mensions raised since his departure, and adorned with the finest sculpture. His curiosity was excited—he drew near, and he could distinguish (followed by elegant poetic praise) "<HI>To the me∣mory of John Lord Viscount Bendham.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="030623_0210_0FE83E85CACEE438"/>
Notwithstanding the solemn, melancholy, anxious bent of Henry's mind, he could not read these words, and behold this costly fabric, without indulging a momentary fit of indignant laughter.</P>
<P>"Are sculpture and poetry thus debased," he cried, "to perpetuate the memory of a man, whose best advantage is to be forgotten? Whose no one action merits record, but as an example to be shunned."</P>
<P>An elderly woman, leaning on her stick, now passed along the lane by the side of the church.—The younger Henry accosted her, and ventured to enquire, "Where the daughters of Mr. Ry∣mer, since his death, were gone to live?"</P>
<P>"We live," she returned, "in that small cot∣tage across the clover field."</P>
<P>Henry looked again, and thought he had mis∣taken the word <HI>we</HI>—for he felt assured, that he had no knowledge of the person to whom he spoke.</P>
<P>But she knew him, and, after a pause, cried—"Ah! Mr. Henry, you are welcome back. I am heartily glad to see you—and my poor sister Rebecca will go out of her wits with joy."</P>
<P>"Is Rebecca living, and will be glad to see me?" he eagerly asked, while tears of rapture trickled down his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ "Father," he continu∣ed in his ecstacy, "we are now come home to be completely happy—and I feel as if all the years
<PB N="104" REF="030623_0211_0FE83E91CA33E870"/>
I have been away, were but a short week; and as if all the dangers I have passed, had been light as a feather.—But is it possible," he cried, to his kind informer, "that you are one of Re∣becca's sisters?"</P>
<P>Well might he ask; for instead of the bloom∣ing woman of seven-and-twenty he had left her, her colour was gone, her teeth impaired, her voice broken. She was near fifty.</P>
<P>"Yes, I am one of Mr. Rymer's daughters," she replied.</P>
<P>"But which?" said Henry.</P>
<P>"The eldest, and once called the prettiest," she returned: "Though now people tell me I am altered—yet I cannot say I see it myself."</P>
<P>"And are you all living?" Henry enquired.</P>
<P>"All but one: she married and died. The other three, on my father's death, agreed to live together, and knit or spin for our support. So we took that small cottage, and furnished it with some of the parsonage furniture as you shall see—and kindly welcome I am sure you will be to all it affords, though that is but little."</P>
<P>As she was saying this, she led him through the clover field towards the cottage.—His heart rebounded with joy that Rebecca was there—yet, as he walked, he shu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed at the impression which he feared, the first sight of her would
<PB N="105" REF="030623_0212_0FE83E9045C7B0C8"/>
make. He feared, what he imagined (till he had seen this change in her sister) he should never heed. He feared Rebecca would look no longer young. He was not yet sufficient master over all his sensual propensities, as, when the trial came, to think he could behold her look like her sister, and not give some evidence of his disap∣pointment.</P>
<P>His fears were vain.—On entering the gate of their little garden, Rebecca rushed from the house to meet them, just the same Rebecca as ever.</P>
<P>It was her mind, which, beaming on her face, and actuating her every motion, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consti∣tuted all her charms: it was her mind which had gained her Henry's affection; that mind had un∣dergone no change, and she was the self-same woman he had left her.</P>
<P>He was entranced with joy.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE fare which the Henrys partook at the cottage of the female Rymers, was such as the sister had described, mean, and even scanty; but this did not in the least diminish the happiness they received in meeting, for the first time since their arrival in England, human beings who were glad to see them.</P>
<P>At a stinted repast of milk and vegetables, a
<PB N="106" REF="030623_0213_0FE83E9A5A4EC590"/>
glimmering light by a little brush wood on the hearth, they yet could feel themselves compara∣tively blest, while they listened to the recital of afflictions, which had befallen persons around that very neighbourhood, for whom every delici∣ous viand had been procured to gratify the taste, every art devised to delight all the other senses.</P>
<P>It was by the side of this glimmering fire, that Rebecca and her sisters told the story of poor Hannah's fate; and of the thorn it had for ever planted in William's bosom—of his reported sleepless, perturbed nights; and his gloomy, or starting, and half-distracted days: when, in the fullness of remorse, he has complained—"Of a guilty conscience! Of the weariness attached to continued prosperity! The misery of wanting an object of affection!"</P>
<P>They told of Lord Bendham's death from the effects of intemperance; from a mass of blood in∣fected by high seasoned dishes, mixed with copi∣ous draughts of wine—repletion of food and li∣quor, not less fatal to the existence of the rich, than the want of common sustenance to the lives of the poor.</P>
<P>They told of Lady Bendham's ruin since her Lord's death, by gaming—They told, "that now she suffered beyond the pain of common in∣digence, by the cutting triumph of those, whom she had formerly despised."</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="030623_0214_0FE83E6675D68820"/>
They related (what has been told before) the divorce of William; and the marriage of his wife with a libertine—The decease of Lady Clementina; occasioned by that incorrigible va∣nity, which even old age could not subdue.</P>
<P>After numerous other examples had been re∣cited of the dangers, the evils that riches draw upon their owner; the elder Henry rose from his chair, and embracing Rebecca and his son, said,</P>
<P>"How much indebted are <HI>we</HI> to Providence, my children, who, while it inflicts poverty, be∣stows peace of mind; and in return <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the trivial grief we meet in this world, holds out to our longing hopes, the reward of the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪"</P>
<P>Not only resigned, but happy in their station; with hearts made cheerful rather than dejected by attentive meditation; Henry and his son plan∣ned the means of their future support, indepen∣dent of their kinsman William—not only of him, but of every person and thing, but their own in∣dustry.</P>
<P>"While I have health and strength," (cried the old man, and his son's looks acquiesced in all the father said) "I will not take from any one in affluence, what only belongs to the widow, the fatherless, and the infirm; for to such alone, by christian laws—however custom may subvert them—the overplus of the rich is due."</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER. XLVII.</HEAD>
<P>BY forming an humble scheme for their re∣maining life, a scheme depending upon their <HI>own</HI> exertions alone; on no light promises of preten∣ded friends, and on no sanguine hopes of certain success; but with prudent apprehension, with fortitude against disappointment, Henry, his son, and Rebecca, (now his daughter) found them∣selves, at the end of one year, in the enjoyment of every comfort which such distinguished minds knew how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taste.</P>
<P>Exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> both from patronage and from con∣troul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, alive to every fruition with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nature blesses the world; dead to all out of their power to attain, the works of art—sus∣ceptible of those passions which endear human creatures one to another, insensible to those which separate man from man—they found them∣selves the thankful inhabitants of a small house or hut, placed on the borders of the sea.</P>
<P>Each morning wakes the father and the son to cheerful labour in fishing, or the tending of a garden, the produce of which they carry with their fish to the next market town. The even∣ing sends them back to their home in joy; where Rebecca meets them at the door, affectionately boasts of the warm meal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is ready, and heigh∣tens the charm of conversation with her taste and judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="030623_0216_0FE83E7FB1720908"/>
It was after a supper of roots from their little garden, poultry that Rebecca's hand had reared, and a jug brewed by young Henry, that the fol∣lowing discourse took place:</P>
<P>"My son," said the elder Henry, "where un∣der the sky, shall three perhaps be met together, happy as we three are? It is the want of industry, or the want of reflection, which makes the poor dissatisfied. Labour gives a value to rest, which the idle can never taste; and reflection gives to the mind content, which the unthinking never can know."</P>
<P>"I once," replied the younger Henry, "con∣sidered poverty a curse—but after my thoughts became enlarged, and I had associated for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the rich, and now mix with the poor, my opinion has undergone a total change—for I have seen, and have enjoyed, more real pleasure at work with my fellow labourers, and in this cot∣tage, than ever I beheld, or experienced, during my abode at my uncle's; during all my inter∣course with the fashionable, and the powerful of this world."</P>
<P>"The worst is," said Rebecca, "the poor have not always enough."</P>
<P>"Who has enough?" asked her husband. "Had my uncle? No—he hoped for more—and in all his writings sacrificed his duty to his ava∣rice. Had his son enough, when he yielded up
<PB N="110" REF="030623_0217_0FE83E8137630808"/>
his honour, his domestic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to gratify his am∣bition? Had Lady Bendham enough when she staked all she had, in the hope of becoming rich∣er? Were we, my Rebecca, of discontented minds, we have now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o little. But conscious, from observation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> experience, that the rich are not so happy as ourselves, we rejoice in our lot."</P>
<P>The tear of joy that stole from her eye, ex∣pressed more than his words—a state of happiness.</P>
<P>He continued, "I remember, that when I first came a boy to England, the poor excited my compassion▪ but now that my judgment is ma∣tured, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the rich. I know that in this opu∣lent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, there are near as many persons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> through intemperance, as starving with hunger—there are as many miserable in the las∣situde of having nothing to do, as there are, bow∣ed down to the earth with hard labour—there are more persons who draw upon themselves calami∣ty by following their own will, than there are, who experience it by obeying the will of ano∣ther. Add to this, the rich fear dying, so much, they have no comfort in living."</P>
<P>"There the poor have another advantage," said Rebecca, "for they may defy not only death, but every loss by sea or land, for they have nothing to lose."</P>
<P>"Besides," added the elder Henry, "there is a certain joy, of the most gratifying kind that the human mind is capable of tasting, peculiar to
<PB N="111" REF="030623_0218_0FE83E897A841658"/>
the poor; and of which the rich can but seldom experience the delight."</P>
<P>"What can that be?" cried Rebecca.</P>
<P>"A kind word, a benevolent smile, one token of esteem from the person, whom we consider as our superior."</P>
<P>To which Rebecca replied, "And the rarity of obtaining such a token, is what encreases the honour."</P>
<P>"Certainly:" returned young Henry, "and yet those in poverty, ungrateful as they are, mur∣mur against that government from which they re∣ceive the blessing; and unlearned as they are, would attempt to alter it. We leave to the physician the care of restoring our health, we employ the sol∣dier in fighting our battles, and the lawyer in the defence of our fortunes, without presuming to in∣terrupt them in their vocations—then, why not leave, and without molestation, those to govern a kingdom, who have studied the science of politics? For though a physician may not always be skil∣ful, a soldier may not always have courage, a lawyer not always honesty, or a minister always good fortune—yet, we should consider, that it is not upon earth we are to look for a state of per∣fection—it is only in heaven—and there, we may rest assured, that no practitioner in the professions I have named, will ever be admitted to disturb our eternal felicity.</P>
