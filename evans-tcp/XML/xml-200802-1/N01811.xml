<HEAD>THE <HI>Salvation of the Soul,</HI> Considered in a brief ESSAY, prepa∣red for the hands that are at work on the Designs of the <HI>Common Salvation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MAy our <HI>Gospellized People,</HI> now give Atten∣tion, a just &amp; strong Attention, to the most Important Matters, that ever any People had, or can have, Set before them. The Most-concerning, the All-concerning, Matters are Set before us, in those Words,
<Q><BIBL>I. Pet. I. 9.</BIBL>
<HI>The</HI> END <HI>of your</HI> FAITH, <HI>the</HI> SALVATION <HI>of your</HI> SOULS.</Q></P>
<P>EVERY Word is Ponderous; it weighs like the <HI>Mountains</HI> of GOD. The <HI>Inspiration of the Almighty,</HI> em∣ploys the Pen of an Apostle from Him, to Recommend unto us, a <HI>Faith</HI> in a Lovely JESUS; the <HI>Faith</HI> of what He will do for His Followers, at that <HI>Second Coming</HI> of His, which is to be looked for. In the Prose∣cution of this Intention, We are here treated with Two Things; First, An Incomparable <HI>Blessedness,</HI> for the obtaining of which every Man has cause to be unspeakably Sollicitous;
<PB N="2" REF="002144_0003_0FBC2225DFC456E8"/>
An Inestimable <HI>Blessedness,</HI> which if thou <HI>Lose,</HI> O Man, <HI>What will it profit thee, if thou gain the whole World?</HI> This <HI>Blessedness,</HI> is, <HI>The Salvation of the Soul</HI> But then, Secondly; The <HI>Way</HI> wherein we are made Partakers of this <HI>Blessed∣ness.</HI> T'wil be the <HI>End</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI>; Our <HI>Way</HI> to it, is by a Genuine <HI>Faith</HI> in the JESUS, who alone can <HI>Lead us into the Rest which remains for the people of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>That which I am in the most awakening Terms, to oblige your most Serious Thoughts upon, is This <HI>Faithful saying of GOD</HI>; Oh! Let it be counted <HI>worthy of all Acceptation</HI> with you!</P>
<P>The <HI>SALVATION</HI> of the <HI>SOUL,</HI> will be the <HI>END</HI> of a True <HI>FAITH</HI> in Our Glorious and Mighty, and Only <HI>SAVIOUR.</HI></P>
<P>Seasonably &amp; Effectually to make sure of a part in the <HI>Salvation,</HI> whereof the Blessed JE∣SUS is <HI>the Author, to as many as obey Him</HI>; This, This is the Thing, which you are now with an Uncommon Importunity to be press'd un∣to. For, my Friends, Our SAVIOUR has in∣structed us, Tis not every one that shall be <HI>Saved</HI>: No, Tis not every one that pretends to own Him for a <HI>Lord,</HI> and makes a fair pre∣tension to <HI>Religion,</HI> that shall be <HI>Saved. Mul∣titudes, Multitudes,</HI> are they who perish, by a most Sottish <HI>Neglect</HI> of their GRAND IN∣TEREST; And you have cause to Think up∣on a <HI>Question,</HI> which GOD now puts unto <HI>You,</HI> but which indeed all the Angels in Heaven
<PB N="3" REF="002144_0004_0FBC22281D4E55A8"/>
can give no Answer to; That very Solemn <HI>Question,</HI> Heb. II. 3. <HI>How shall we escape, if we Neglect so great Salvation</HI>!</P>
<P>The first Thing that is now to be done, is to assert the <HI>Existence</HI> of the <HI>Subject,</HI> the <HI>Welfare</HI> whereof we are now Entreating you to be wise∣ly concerned about; And this is, The SOUL. This Assertion is to be introduced, as an Un∣doubted Preliminary, to what we are going upon; Job XXXII. 8 <HI>There is a SPIRIT in Man.</HI> A SPIRIT capable of Discerning and Arguing and Affecting: A SPIRIT which Reasons, and Compares, and Judges, and Chu∣ses; A SPIRIT which a Man of Reason, when he feels himself a <HI>dying,</HI> does commit into the Hands of a <HI>Faithful Creator.</HI> O Man, Thou hast a SOUL, the <HI>Existence</HI> whereof ought to be how <HI>Real,</HI> and how <HI>Awful,</HI> to thee! Indeed, it might seem a Needless <HI>Labour,</HI> yea, and a Cutting <HI>Satyr,</HI> to take any Pains for the con∣vincing of a Man, that he has a <HI>Soul</HI> within him. Should any Man <HI>Doubt</HI> whether he has a SOUL within him, his very <HI>Doubt</HI> would be an <HI>Evi∣dence</HI> of it. So wondrously would that Man <HI>Confute</HI> himself, who should thus go to degrade himself into the class of the <HI>Beasts that Perish.</HI> It was the Ridiculous Mistake of the poor <HI>A∣mericans,</HI> who when they first saw some <HI>Euro∣peans</HI> on Horse back, took the Horse and his Rider to be but One Animal. But much more worthy to be Ridiculed, arc the <HI>Epicure∣ans</HI> who take not the <HI>Body</HI> and the <HI>Soul,</HI> for very Different Substances. My Friend, Thy <HI>Body</HI> is but a <HI>Cabinet</HI> unto a <HI>Jewel,</HI> the most precious
<PB N="4" REF="002144_0005_0FBC222BADB6F8F0"/>
in the World; A SOUL, A SOUL which has many Incontestible Demonstrations (be∣sides those of well-attested <HI>Apparitions,</HI>) of its <HI>Immortality.</HI> A SOUL which is capable of <HI>Doing</HI> more for GOD, and of <HI>Tasting</HI> more from Him, than all the Creatures in the whole Visible Creation. A SOUL, whereof a SA∣VIOUR who has <HI>been Powerfully declared, The SON of GOD</HI>; and the <HI>True Witness, who de∣livereth Souls</HI>; has declared unto us, Matth. X. 28. <HI>It cannot be killed, by that which Kills the Body.</HI> A Text, which the <HI>Men of corrupt minds,</HI> who are for that Scandalous Epitaph on a Dead Man, <HI>Here lies the whole of the Man,</HI> in vain Study to make Evasions from. That SOUL of thine, O Man, When will thine Ears be open unto the Cries which it makes unto thee? Verily, There is the <HI>Voice of GOD</HI> crying to Every Man, in the cry which his own SOUL makes unto him. <Q>When, O Man, wilt thou <HI>shew thy self a Man?</HI> Thy Dying <HI>Body</HI> is abundantly cared for. When shall the SOUL, that is to Survive the <HI>Body,</HI> have a due care bestow'd upon it? Thy <HI>Body</HI> is <HI>fed</HI>; But thy SOUL is famish'd. Thy <HI>Body</HI> is <HI>cloath'd</HI>; But thy SOUL is naked. The Distempers of thy <HI>Body,</HI> thou seekest a cure for. Thy SOUL is <HI>pining away in its Iniquities.</HI> Thy <HI>Body</HI> is falling and hast'ning down into the <HI>Pit of Corruption.</HI> Oh! what Provision hast thou made, that thy SOUL may be then <HI>Re∣ceived into Everlasting Habitations?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Subject</HI> is then agreed upon; The next
<PB N="5" REF="002144_0006_0FBC222CCCD51C48"/>
thing to be done, is to prevail with you, that you would pursue the <HI>Welfare</HI> of this Noble <HI>Subject</HI>; A point which, One would think, should now need no further to be spoken to. Do but Remember, O Man, That thou hast a SOUL, and thou canst not but Acknowledge, that it must be, <HI>The ONE THING that is Needful,</HI> to Consult the Welfare of it. But that this Design may be well pursued, we will Maintain Two Positions.</P>
<P>My First POSITION is; The SALVATI∣ON of the SOUL, is to be the <HI>Grand Point of Sollicitude,</HI> with all that <HI>are going down to the Dust,</HI> whereof <HI>none can keep alive his own Soul.</HI> But now, What is implied, what is contain'd, in, <HI>The Salvation of the Soul?</HI> SALVATION! O comprehensive Word! O Incomprehensi∣ble Good! SOUL, 'Tis beyond <HI>all that thou canst Ask or Think</HI>!</P>
<P>First; In the <HI>Salvation of the Soul,</HI> there is a <HI>Deliverance</HI> from all the Miseries to which by our Fall from GOD, we are become Obnoxi∣ous; all the Miserable Circumstances of those whom <HI>GOD counteth for His Enemies.</HI> The doleful Outcry of all Mankind, may be That, Lam. V.16. <HI>The crown is fallen from our Head, and wo is unto us, in that we have Sinned.</HI> Soul, T'wil be thy Outcry, whenever the <HI>Sleep of Death</HI> upon thee, is going off. The <HI>Apostasy</HI> from GOD, begun by our <HI>First Parents,</HI> has plunged us all into a <HI>woful</HI> Condition. The <HI>Soul,</HI> involved in the <HI>Sin</HI> of our <HI>First Parents.</HI> and having by <HI>Actual Sin</HI> also <HI>Denied the GOD that is Above,</HI> may make its Bitter Lamentati∣ons.
<PB N="6" REF="002144_0007_0FBC222E1D930F68"/>
<Q><HI>O wretched One that I am</HI>! I have the <HI>Wrath of GOD abiding of me</HI>▪ and His dire∣ful <HI>Curse</HI> is dispensed unto me, even in my <HI>Prosperity,</HI> as well as my <HI>adversity.</HI> I am <HI>Sick</HI> of <HI>Greivous Diseases.</HI> I am a <HI>Slave</HI> to <HI>Satan,</HI> and I <HI>serve diverse Lusts.</HI> When I am <HI>driven</HI> out of this <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> I am like to fall into the Hands which it is a <HI>fearful thing to fall into.</HI> There is danger that my Re∣turn unto it at a tremendous <HI>Day of Judg∣ment,</HI> will be only to undergo a <HI>Strange Punishment reserved for the workers of Iniquity.</HI> And Oh! What will become of me, when This Earth shall become like a <HI>Fiery Oven,</HI> and as a mighty, flaming, blazing <HI>Furnace,</HI> which all the <HI>Wicked of the Earth</HI> shall be thrown into!</Q> O <HI>Soul</HI> in wondrous Perils, To be Rescued from all this Confusion, is that <HI>Salvation,</HI> which is now set before thee, in the <HI>Word of Truth,</HI> which is the <HI>Gospel of thy Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Secondly; There is in the <HI>Salva∣tion of the Soul,</HI> a <HI>Positive</HI> Good, conveyed; All the <HI>Good</HI> which is promised unto the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI>: and Oh! <HI>How Great is ihat Good,</HI> which GOD has laid up for them that <HI>Fear Him</HI>! The <HI>Salvation</HI> which we have in our <HI>View,</HI> is in the Sacred Oracles which describe it unto us, called, <HI>Life Eternal.</HI> The Thing of which we are often and often informed in the <HI>Holy Book,</HI> which none but an <HI>Holy GOD,</HI> and <HI>One who cannot Lye,</HI> can be the Author of, is That; 1 Joh. II. 25. <HI>This is the promise that He has promised us, Eternal Life.</HI> Herein, first,
<PB N="7" REF="002144_0008_0FBC22313133CF58"/>
there is a <HI>Sentence of Life</HI> passed upon us, and our <HI>Sin</HI> is <HI>Pardoned.</HI> In our <HI>Pardon,</HI> GOD restores us to His <HI>Favour,</HI> and <HI>in His Favour there is Life.</HI> There is a <HI>Justification of Life,</HI> wherein a Gracious GOD says unto us, <HI>The Lord hath put away thy sin; Thou shall not Dye:</HI> Says unto us, <HI>Be comforted, Thy Sins are for∣given thee.</HI> Herein there is that thing done for us; Rom. V. 19. <HI>We receive the Gift of Righteousness, and reign in Life by JESUS CHRIST.</HI> In the <HI>Salvation of the soul,</HI> there is a Release given to the Soul, from the Bonds to suffer the <HI>Destruction from GOD,</HI> which His <HI>Violated Law</HI> lays upon the Sinner; and the Soul may Sing, <HI>Lord, I will praise thee; for that tho' thou wast Angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou dost comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Secondly; There is an <HI>Entrance into Life</HI>; which is made by our coming to <HI>Live unto GOD.</HI> We are <HI>Quickned</HI> with In∣fluences from Above, which Enliven us, and Enable us to pay those Regards unto the <HI>Li∣ving GOD,</HI> which we have heretofore paid unto our <HI>Idols.</HI> We have that <HI>Life of GOD</HI> begun in us, wherein the <HI>Praising</HI> and <HI>Plea∣sing</HI> of GOD, becomes the <HI>Main Scope</HI> of our <HI>Life; Self</HI> is dethroned, and GOD resumes His <HI>Throne</HI> in our Souls. We terminate our <HI>Loves</HI> and <HI>Hopes</HI> and <HI>Joyes,</HI> no longer in <HI>Creatures,</HI> but pass from them and through them unto GOD: We <HI>Dy</HI> to <HI>Creatures,</HI> and <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD. And it is with us accor∣ding to That; Rom. VIII. 2. <HI>The Law of the
<PB N="8" REF="002144_0009_0FBC2232E718D1D0"/>
Spirit of Life in CHRIST JESUS hath made me free from the Law of Sin and of Death.</HI> The <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> does Relieve and Remove the Maladies which the SOUL is deprav'd withal, and fill the <HI>Soul</HI> with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, and of the <HI>Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>And now,</P>
<P>Thirdly; The <HI>Life Eternal,</HI> which had its <HI>Inchoation</HI> in This World, has its <HI>Consumma∣tion</HI> in another and a better World, after our <HI>Departure</HI> out of This. And here first, There shall be that Word accomplished, Rom. VIII. 10. <HI>If CHRIST be in you, the Body is dead, be∣cause of Sin, but the Spirit is Life, because of Righteousness.</HI> Our <HI>Spirits</HI> will, at our Expira∣tion, <HI>fly away,</HI> into a <HI>Paradise,</HI> where they <HI>Live unto GOD</HI> and are <HI>Comforted.</HI> But then, anon shall be that Word accomplished, 1 Cor. XV 53. <HI>This corruptible must put on incorruption; This mortal must put on immortality.</HI> The <HI>Sal∣vation of the Soul,</HI> will prove the <HI>Salvation of the Body</HI> too. 'Tis observable, That the <HI>Salva∣tion of the Soul,</HI> is to be received at the <HI>Appear∣ing</HI> of the Lord; even when He shall come to <HI>Raise</HI> the <HI>Dead</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> the World. The <HI>Soul</HI> will not be in all circumstances as it would be, till that Great Revolution. We shall then have our <HI>Bodies</HI> fetch'd back from the dark Cham∣bers of <HI>Death,</HI> and given back to our <HI>Spirits,</HI> fill'd with an <HI>Ethereal matter,</HI> and made <HI>Lumi∣nous</HI> and <HI>Vigorous,</HI> and <HI>Salted,</HI> or made <HI>Incor∣ruptible</HI> with the <HI>Fiery Robe,</HI> whereof we were stripped by the <HI>First Transgression.</HI> Our <HI>Life</HI> being <HI>Redeemed from Destruction,</HI> at the <HI>Resur∣rection
<PB N="9" REF="002144_0010_0FBC22341C2D68D0"/>
of the Dead,</HI> our <HI>Youth</HI> will be <HI>Renewed,</HI> and we shall have <HI>Bodies,</HI> wherein we shall <HI>mount up as with the Wings of Eagles.</HI> Then we shall be sheltered under the Wings of the JE∣SUS, who <HI>Delivers from the Wrath to come</HI>; find with Him a shelter from the <HI>Devouring Fire,</HI> and the <HI>Everlasting Burnings,</HI> which they that <HI>Know not GOD, and Obey not His Gospel,</HI> shall be doom'd unto. Then, Then we shall be taken into the <HI>Holy City,</HI> which has the <HI>Glory of GOD</HI> giving <HI>Light</HI> unto it. There we shall have <HI>all Tears wiped away from our Eyes.</HI> There▪ we shall be <HI>Filled with all the Fulness of GOD</HI>▪ There GOD will become <HI>All in All</HI> unto us. But, O the <HI>Duration</HI> of this <HI>Felicity!</HI> An <HI>Eter∣nal Salvation!</HI> After we have been in that <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Immortality,</HI> for Thou∣sands of Myriads of Millions of Ages, and such as it would even tire all humane Understand∣ing to cast up the Numbers of, we shall be no nearer the Period of it, than the First Moment that we came into it.</P>
<P>Behold, the SALVATION <HI>of the Soul,</HI> which we do with Vehemency now urge you to be Vehemently concerned about: A SALVATI∣ON which certainly you cannot but own to be well worth all the Pains that can be ta∣ken for it. O go to <HI>Work about the Salvation</HI> with <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> lest by presumptu∣ous and contemptuous Delays you provoke the GOD, who <HI>Works in us to will and to do of His own good pleasure,</HI> to withold from you those Aids of <HI>Supernatural Grace,</HI> without which, you will continue as you are, and <HI>fall short
<PB N="10" REF="002144_0011_0FBC22359E5E2B80"/>
of entering into Rest.</HI> SOUL, Delay no longer; but hearken to</P>
<P>My Second Position which is, There is a Blessed SAVIOUR, a <HI>Faith</HI> in whom will, for the <HI>End</HI> of it, have the <HI>Salvation of the Soul.</HI> Men and Brethren, You are now coming to <HI>Know the way to the City.</HI> 'Tis after this man∣ner, that the <HI>Servants of the most High GOD must shew unto you the way of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>First, We have a most powerful and most merciful SAVIOUR, whose Name is JESUS because <HI>He saves His People from their sins.</HI> In our Blessed JESUS, has our GOD fulfilled that Word unto us, <HI>He will send them a SAVIOUR, and a GREAT ONE.</HI> Messengers from Heaven have made this Proclamation unto us, Luke II. 10. <HI>I bring you good Tidings of Great Joy, which shall be to all People; unto you there is born a SAVIOUR, who is CHRIST the Lord</HI> O wonderful! O wonderful! The Eternal SON of GOD, a Person who is ONE GOD with His Eternal FATHER, has taken the Man JESUS into One Person with Himself This GOD man, is become the <HI>Me∣diator</HI> between GOD and <HI>Man,</HI> and gives to <HI>Man</HI> a view of Returning to GOD. By His <HI>Mediation</HI> it is, that His chosen People arrive to the <HI>Salvation of the Soul.</HI> That this our SAVIOUR <HI>Died,</HI> and <HI>Rose</HI> from the <HI>Dead,</HI> and was <HI>Received</HI> up into the <HI>Heavens</HI>; this is a Thing whereof we have <HI>many Infallible Proofs.</HI> 'Tis a Thing that has been better proved, than any <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> that ever was in the
<PB N="11" REF="002144_0012_0FBC22372068B508"/>
World. There needs no more to prove, than He is the SAVIOUR, which His <HI>Gospel</HI> has Reported Him to be, and that what He has Revealed in His <HI>Gospel</HI> about the <HI>Salvation of the Soul,</HI> is to be relied upon. This is the SA∣VIOUR, who presents Himself a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to the Justice of GOD, upon our pleading whereof we receive the <HI>Remission of sins.</HI> This is the SAVIOUR, who by His <HI>Obedi∣ence</HI> to the Everlasting Rules of <HI>Righteousness,</HI> has furnished them who have none of their own, with a Plea for their <HI>Acceptance</HI> with GOD. This is that SAVIOUR▪ who appears as an <HI>Advocate</HI> for us in the <HI>most holy Place,</HI> and <HI>saves us to the uttermost,</HI> by <HI>Everliving to make Intercession for us.</HI> Here is the SAVIOUR who <HI>Guides our Feet into the way of Peace,</HI> and <HI>Inclines us to the Things that are Holy and Just and Good,</HI> and <HI>Works in us that which is well pleasing in the sight of GOD</HI> Here is the SA∣VIOUR, who being the Lord of <HI>Angels,</HI> and having <HI>all power given to Him,</HI> orders our whole State, and <HI>performs the Thing that is appointed for us.</HI> In Him we have a SAVI∣OUR, who having <HI>made us meet</HI> for the <HI>Spi∣ritual Blessings in the Heavenly places,</HI> does first of all take our <HI>Departed Spirits</HI> into His <HI>Custody</HI>; and by'nd by, Revive our <HI>Bodies</HI> into Agreeable and Everlasting <HI>Habitations</HI> for them; And so▪ <HI>Re-unite</HI> us unto GOD, in the endless enjoyment of Him, and of all things in Him. A SAVIOUR, who is very GOD; One whose Name is JEHOVAH; One Who is <HI>Over-all, GOD Blessed for ever:</HI> And
<PB N="12" REF="002144_0013_0FBC223914E7CA98"/>
because He is GOD <HI>Almighty</HI> therefore <HI>mighty to save.</HI> Because He is JEHOVAH therefore <HI>Salvation</HI> is to be expected from Him; He is the <HI>True GOD</HI>; therefore <HI>Eternal Life</HI> is to be found in Him. Oh! what a SAVIOUR! Soul, How canst thou hear of Him, and not Adore Him, not Embrace Him, not cry out unto Him; <HI>O my Lord, and my GOD; Say thou to my Soul, I am thy Salvation</HI>!</P>
<P>Secondly, Our Great SAVIOUR in His Gospel tenders the <HI>Salvation of the Soul,</HI> to every Soul. Our SAVIOUR, <HI>Lo, He sends forth His Voice, and that a mighty Voice</HI>; and it reaches to the Ends of the Earth: Shall not the very <HI>Dead</HI> now feel it reaching to them; and <HI>Live</HI> upon it! Isa. XLV. 22. <HI>Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the Earth.</HI> What is the <HI>Gospel,</HI> but the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> tendered unto <HI>Every Soul of Man,</HI> that has <HI>done Evil,</HI> and would be <HI>saved</HI> from <HI>Evil?</HI> Now concerning this <HI>Gospel,</HI> our SAVIOUR has given this Commission, <HI>Go ye into all the World, and Preach the Gospel to every Creature.</HI> There is not one among all the Children of Men, to whom it may not be said. <HI>Ah, Sinful Creature; Ah, Ruin'd Creature. There is a JESUS, able and willing to save thee, out of all the Ruins, which by sinning against GOD thou hast brought upon thee</HI>! Soul, What a Sweet Invitation has thy SAVIOUR given thee? <HI>Come to me, all you that Labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you Rest</HI>! What a Sweet Invitation; <HI>Ho, every one that thirsteth,
<PB N="13" REF="002144_0014_0FBC223A22AC2110"/>
come ye to the waters; Come unto me, Hear, and your soul shall live!</HI> To over come thy Un∣belief, O Invited Soul, He has kindly Spoken a word worth a World; A Word which has broken Millions of Hearts; And shall <HI>Thine</HI> be Obdurate! Joh. VI. 37. <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Soul, Be thy <HI>Sins</HI> never so many, never so heinous, and be thy <HI>Plagues</HI> never so <HI>wonderful,</HI> thou shall yet be welcome to thy SAVIOUR, if thou come unto Him: His <HI>Grace</HI> is a <HI>Foun∣tain Set Open</HI> for thee. Tho' thy case appear never so <HI>desperate,</HI> yet there is <HI>Hope in Israel concerning this Thing.</HI> Thy <HI>Salvation</HI> may not be despaired of. T'will be a crime in thee, to conclude, That the <HI>Day of Grace</HI> is over with thee, or that thou hast <HI>Sinned Unpar∣donably.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. But the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> can∣not be had, without <HI>Believing</HI> in the Glori∣ous and Mighty, and only SAVIOUR. The Greatest CASE that ever was answered in the World, hear now what Answer is to be given unto it. The CASE has been pro∣pounded, and, Oh! that it were oftener so, and with a <HI>Soul full of Troubles,</HI> —Even this, <HI>What shall I do to be Saved?</HI> The Reply given to it, by the Apostles of GOD, is a very Authentick one; Act. XVI. 31. <HI>Believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and thou shall be Saved.</HI> FAITH is the <HI>Flight</HI> of a Distressed Soul, unto our Blessed SAVIOUR. The <HI>End</HI> of this <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Flight</HI> is, <HI>The Sal∣vation of the Soul.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>End</HI> which <HI>Faith</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="002144_0015_0FBC223D50809FE8"/>
does <HI>Aim</HI> at; and the <HI>End</HI> which <HI>Faith</HI> does <HI>Come</HI> at. Our SAVIOUR has given us This Definition of the <HI>Faith</HI> which seeks and finds the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI>; Joh. V. 40. 'Tis a <HI>Coming to Him, that we may have Life.</HI> The process of a <HI>Saving Faith</HI> shall be now Set before you. SOUL, Be Restless, till thou hast passed through it, and made sure of thy <HI>Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>First. Become sensible of what you are, and how much you want <HI>Salvation,</HI> while you are at a Distance from your SAVIOUR. To the <HI>Christless,</HI> must be said, what we have in Rev. III. 17. <HI>Thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.</HI> O Fall into an Heart-melting Meditation; <Q>What am I but a <HI>Child of Wrath,</HI> and a <HI>Prey to the Terrible,</HI> and Full of a lothsome <HI>Leprosy?</HI> Until my SAVIOUR Pitty me? Where must my Portion be, but in a <HI>Place of Tor∣ments?</HI> Except my SAVIOUR Pitty me▪ O my SAVIOUR, <HI>Necessity is laid upon me,</HI> to come unto thee, and <HI>Wo unto me, if I do it not</HI>!</Q> But under the <HI>Convictions</HI> of this <HI>Neces∣sity,</HI> at the same time confess your selves <HI>Un∣able</HI> to come unto your SAVIOUR, yea, and <HI>Unworthy</HI> that GOD should help you to come. Let the <HI>Soveraign Grace,</HI> that shines forth in <HI>Drawing</HI> to your SAVIOUR, all that come unto Him, have a due Confession made of it. <HI>From the Depths cry unto the Lord: and say, Lord, I can Perform nothings, Lord, I do Deserve no∣thing; But, O my SAVIOUR, Draw thou me, and I shall Run unto thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002144_0016_0FBC223EA4C05340"/>Secondly Look for no less than the whole <HI>Salvation of the Soul,</HI> in Looking to your SA∣VIOUR. You must come to your SAVI∣OUR in all His <HI>Offices</HI>; come to your SA∣VIOUR for all His <HI>Benefits</HI>; come to your SAVIOUR, on all those Purposes; 1 Cor. I. 30. <HI>Made of GOD unto us, Wisdom, Righte∣ousness, Holiness, and Redemption.</HI> If your <HI>first</HI> Errand unto your SAVIOUR be, That by His <HI>Blood</HI> you may be <HI>cleansed from all Sin</HI>; yet this must not be <HI>all</HI> your Errand. You must go to Him, That He would Instruct you, Govern you, Rectify all that is amiss in you, and bring you to a <HI>Perfection of Holiness is the Fear of GOD.</HI> It is by coming into the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> that our <HI>Salvation</HI> is assured unto us: Even that <HI>Covenant,</HI> which is the Echo to that <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> wherein our SAVIOUR has Engaged for us, and <HI>Eternal Life was promised before the World begun.</HI> We come into the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> by consenting that our SAVIOUR should be to us, do for us, according to His Engage∣ments in the <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> on the behalf of them, whom in His <HI>Covenant</HI> He be∣comes an <HI>Head</HI> unto. Our SAVIOUR has Promised for His Elect, That <HI>He will make that Expiation for their Offences, which will bring them into a Reconciliation with GOD.</HI> Say now, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I trust in Thee So to Save me!</HI> Our SAVIOUR has also Pro∣mised for His Elect, That <HI>He will Purify them, and make them zealous of Good Works, and write
<PB N="16" REF="002144_0017_0FBC22421853EBA8"/>
the Law of GOD in their Hearts, and guide them with Counsil, and bring them to Glory.</HI> Say now, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I trust in Thee so to Save me.</HI></P>
<P>You see <HI>Faith at Work,</HI> for the <HI>Salvation of the Soul.</HI> The Expression leads me to insist up∣on that: It must be a <HI>Working Faith</HI>; else, O <HI>Vain Man,</HI> 'Tis <HI>Dead,</HI> and will never bring thee to <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>Thirdly; Your <HI>Faith</HI> must <HI>Work</HI> by <HI>Love.</HI> It must fill you with the <HI>Love</HI> of your SA∣VIOUR. This <HI>Love</HI> must keep you always at <HI>Work</HI> for Him, and in the work which be∣longs to a Life of PIETY: still Remem∣bring that He says unto you, <HI>I know thy works.</HI> You must come to that; Gal. II. 20. <HI>I Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD.</HI> Re∣pair to your SAVIOUR for His Direction in Every thing, and <HI>Order the Steps</HI> of your Life by His <HI>Word.</HI> Repair to your SAVIOUR for those Impressions of His <HI>Good Spirit,</HI> which will make you <HI>full of Goodness,</HI> and make the Service of GOD, the Business of your Life. Repair to your SAVIOUR, with fervent <HI>Prayers</HI> to Him, and with precious <HI>Thoughts</HI> of Him, on all Occasions; and make Him the <HI>Rock,</HI> whereto you will <HI>Resort continually. Repent</HI> most heartily of the Sins which have brought you into such a want of a SAVI∣OUR; and lead a <HI>Life of Repentance</HI> before Him. <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> are what <HI>GOD has joined, Man may not separate them.</HI> If your <HI>Faith</HI> be not a <HI>Repenting Faith,</HI> be sure, it is
<PB N="17" REF="002144_0018_0FBC2243C88E2F80"/>
a <HI>Counterfeit,</HI> Let your SAVIOUR be the <HI>Pat∣tern</HI> of your Life; and <HI>walk even as he walked. Faith</HI> in your SAVIOUR, must bring the <HI>Blood</HI> of your SAVIOUR, to run warm in the Veins of your Souls; with Desires and Studies of a <HI>Conformity</HI> to Him. You must Imitate a SA∣VIOUR who <HI>hates Wickedness and loves Righte∣ousness.</HI> Imitate a SAVIOUR, whose <HI>Meat</HI> and whose <HI>Drink</HI> it was to <HI>do the will of GOD.</HI> Imi∣tate a SAVIOUR who took patiently whatever <HI>Cup</HI> His Father gave unto Him; and was a <HI>Sheep under the shearers</HI> when wrongs were done unto Him; and who <HI>went about</HI> still every where <HI>doing Good.</HI> Let your SAVIOUR <HI>Live in you</HI>; and Oh! Do you <HI>Dye</HI> to every thing but Him: Look upon all things here, with a <HI>Sacrificing Eye,</HI> and bear the <HI>killing things</HI> with which your SAVIOUR will make you <HI>Dead</HI> unto the World, <HI>Crucified with Him.</HI> Having so <HI>Liv'd by Faith,</HI> anon you are to <HI>Dye in Faith,</HI> and committing your selves into the hands of such a SAVIOUR, go away <HI>Rejoicing in the Hope of the Glory of GOD.</HI> Now Dye saying, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I know whom I have believed; I chearfully commit my All unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>This 'tis to <HI>Believe unto the saving of the Soul</HI>!</P>
<P>Thus have you, the <HI>Way</HI> to the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> plainly laid out before you. Now what remains is to execute that Command. <HI>Compel them to come in.</HI> The <HI>Compelling</HI> Force of some EXPOSTULATIONS, is now to be tried upon you. Hear a few <HI>Right Words,</HI> and GOD make them <HI>Forcible.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002144_0019_0FBC22449EE06F28"/>Expostulation, I. Are you willing to un∣dergo the dreadful pains, that must unavoid∣ably be undergone by those with whom the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> is Despised, Refused, For∣feited? Believe you not, That <HI>God will bring</HI> every Man, and every work <HI>into Judgment▪</HI> Believe you not, That the <HI>Everlasting Punish∣ment,</HI> which the <HI>Wicked</HI> shall be adjudg'd unto, will be a most <HI>Formidable Punishment?</HI> Believe you not. That a <HI>Soul,</HI> which has been always listed among the <HI>Adversaries</HI> of GOD, shall be siezed with His <HI>Fiery Indignation,</HI> and banish∣ed from Him into a most hideous <HI>Darkness,</HI> where they will be <HI>shut up</HI> and <HI>cannot come forth</HI>? In the <HI>Perdition of Ungodly Men,</HI> foretold by the mouth of your SAVIOUR, is there nothing to be trembled at? Will the <HI>Ungodly</HI> have an easy Time of it, when they are <HI>Broken into</HI> the <HI>Place of Dragons,</HI> and made Fellow-Sufferers with the <HI>Devils</HI> whom they have hearken'd to? Have we not known some in in this World, unto whom the Horrors and the Tortures of a Guilty <HI>Conscience</HI> have been so Intolerable, that they have cried out, of <HI>Burn∣ing to Death,</HI> but as a <HI>Metaphor,</HI> to what they suffered? <HI>Can thy Heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, when I shall deal with thee, saith the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>Expostulation, II. In Receiving the <HI>Sal∣vation of the Soul,</HI> will you not receive what will be a sufficient <HI>Recompence</HI> of all your stri∣ving for it? Even in <HI>this Life,</HI> did ever any sincere <HI>Follower</HI> of our SAVIOUR, once regret
<PB N="19" REF="002144_0020_0FBC22475A17CB58"/>
the Labours and the Hardships of the <HI>Christian Warfare?</HI> Have they not all born this Testi∣mony, <HI>That the ways of Wisdom are pleasant ways, and all its paths are peace; and the most bitter thing in a walk with GOD is much sweeter than the Sweetest thing in the Tents of wickedness?</HI> But in the <HI>Life to Come,</HI> Oh! What will be done for the Soul, to which an Infinite GOD shall multiply the Tokens of His <HI>Loving kind∣ness?</HI> Verily He will do it as a GOD! Are any <HI>Pleasures</HI> comparable to those which you shall find in the <HI>Presence of GOD,</HI> in which there is <HI>Fulness of Joy</HI>? Are any <HI>Riches</HI> com∣parable to those, in which you shall be <HI>Heirs</HI> of GOD, and <HI>Inherit all things</HI>? Are any <HI>Honours</HI> comparable to those that you shall have in a <HI>Royal Priesthood</HI> unto GOD? Such a <HI>Prize</HI> before you, how can you do otherwise than use all your <HI>strength,</HI> and this with all the <HI>speed</HI> imaginable, for the obtaining of it?</P>
<P>Expostulation, III. If you felt your selves in the <HI>pangs of Death,</HI> what would be your <HI>Dying Sentiments?</HI> How will the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> appear unto you, in your <HI>Dying Senti∣ments?</HI> Whatever you may think while you have the Amusements and Enchantments of the World befooling of you, will not the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of a <HI>Dying Hour</HI> determine you to This? If a <HI>Dying Hour</HI> were at this Moment upon you, would you not say, <HI>The Salvation of my Soul, Oh! There is nothing in this World of so much Consequence unto me. Oh! I would give all this World, that I had it assured unto me!
<PB N="20" REF="002144_0021_0FBC2249024106C0"/>
Oh! That instead of throwing away so much of my Time in this World, I had spent more in the assu∣ring of it</HI>! So do the <HI>Dying</HI> Think; Oh! that the <HI>Living</HI> would <HI>lay this to Heart</HI>; and not be misled by <HI>madness in their Heart, while they live.</HI></P>
<P>Expostulation, IV. What would you do if a Message from GOD should this Day come unto you; like what He sent unto One of old; <HI>Set all in order, for thou art now to Dye, and not to Live one Month longer upon the Earth?</HI> What if the <HI>Angel of Death</HI> should appear onto you, and <HI>Swear by Him who lives for ever and ever, Thy end is come; and no longer Time than one Month more shall be allowed unto thee?</HI> What would you now do for the <HI>Salvation of a Soul,</HI> just passing into the Eternal World? Would you not immediately Retire, and cry to the <HI>GOD of all Grace,</HI> That He would <HI>Assist</HI> you to Return unto Him? Would you not re∣call and bewail the <HI>Sins,</HI> which upon <HI>Exami∣nation</HI> you find you can be charged withal? Would you not beg with Tears, that for the sake of the <HI>Blood</HI> of JESUS, your <HI>Sins</HI> which are <HI>many</HI> may be forgiven to you? Would you not give your selves up unto your SAVIOUR, and entreat that His Holy Spirit may possess you, and heal all that is amiss in you, and make you <HI>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light</HI>? Would you not be unpacified, un∣til the <HI>Things that accompany Salvation,</HI> were plainly to be seen upon you? Then, go do these Things without any more ado. Be∣hold,
<PB N="21" REF="002144_0022_0FBC2249DE98A828"/>
NOW is <HI>the Day of Salvation</HI> for them.</P>
<P>Expostulation, V. <HI>Suffer me a little, and I will shew you that I have yet Words for GOD,</HI> and for the <HI>Salvation</HI> of your SOULS. That <HI>Evan∣gelical Ministry,</HI> which does <HI>Preach the Gospel of Peace,</HI> and bring the <HI>Glad Tidings of Good Things</HI> in the <HI>Great Salvation</HI>; ought not such a <HI>Ministry</HI> to be <HI>Beautiful</HI> in your Eyes? Can any but the Enemy of your <HI>Salvation</HI> perswade you that the World can do well enough with∣out such a Ministry? Or, when 'tis <HI>Clothed with Salvation,</HI> and there is nothing but the <HI>Care of Salvation</HI> to be seen upon it, is not your Enemy at work in all the <HI>Contempt</HI> that shall be cast upon it? Are any Men so much Ma∣ligned, Slandered, Reproached in the World, as they who <HI>do most</HI> for the <HI>Salvation</HI> of SOULS, and who after all, triumph in the Reproach as an Honour to them, and as a <HI>Revenge</HI> that <HI>Satan</HI> is taking on them? Will you listen to <HI>Satan,</HI> and be his <HI>Agents?</HI> Or, Do they be∣friend the <HI>Salvation</HI> of SOULS, who go to insinuate an opinion into you, That our <HI>Mi∣nistry</HI> is Invalid, and can do nothing for your <HI>Salvation,</HI> because our <HI>Ordination</HI> is defective? A most profane Insinuation! What! when the <HI>Scriptures</HI> have so evidently asserted, the Validity of an <HI>Ordination</HI> by the <HI>Hands of the Presbytery</HI>; and informed us of no Order in the Church Superiour to it; but <HI>Presby∣ters</HI> are expresly called <HI>Bishops</HI> there, [Acts XX. 17, 18.] When among the Faithful in
<PB N="22" REF="002144_0023_0FBC224BEC3542C0"/>
all Ages from the Days of the <HI>Primitive Church</HI> down to ours, there has been such a <HI>Cloud of Witnesses</HI> unto it! And when it will be hard for you to find any <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> on the whole Continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> which do not sub∣sist upon an <HI>Ordination,</HI> from an <HI>Order not Su∣periour to that of our Pastors!</HI> O our Evang∣lized People, 'Tis the <HI>Substantial</HI> PIETY of GOD Reigning in the SOUL, that we Preach, for your <HI>Salvation.</HI> To Trouble you with <HI>Cir∣cumstantials</HI> in <HI>Religion,</HI> will be of little use to your <HI>Salvation.</HI> I conclude with saying, 1 Cor. XII. 2. <HI>You are Saved, if you keep in Remembrance what I have Preached unto you.</HI></P>
