<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>AN is made after a fearful and wonderful Manner</HI>; indued with noble intellectual Powers; a social Creature, capable of moral Go∣vernment; and formed for Society both civil and religious. We were designed for noble Ends and Purposes, furnished with different Gifts, and endowed with different Talents, made for Usefulness in the World, and called to different Offices; and are all under very great and powerful Obligations to abide and act in our own Spheres, making the Glory of GOD, our own Happiness, and the best Good of our Fellow-Creatures the great End of all our Actions. Man's chief End is, to glorify GOD, and enjoy him for
<PB N="6" REF="008888_0005_1030905EAD5AF640"/>
ever. And as we would glorify God and be approved of him, we must through Grace in Christ, make him our only Trust; live de∣pendant upon him, and devoted to him; we must love him with all our Hearts, su∣premely, ultimately and universally; and love our Neighbour as ourselves: The Re∣deemer's Interest must lie with weight upon our Minds; we must be of a publick Spirit, Friends to lawful Society, and lay ourselves out in the right Improvement of our several Gifts, Talents and Advantages. We are embodied Spirits, and related to both Worlds in this Respect: and while we dwell in this, we are acting for the next, which we shall find a World of intollerable and endless Mi∣sery, or of unspeakable and everlasting Joy and Felicity, according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Beha∣viour. If we are found at last to have abused our Gifts distributed to us by a gracious GOD, and to have perverted them to the basest Ends; or to have wrapt them up in a Nap∣kin, and not used them at all to those Pur∣poses GOD designed in giving them; we shall be deemed slothful and unprofitable Ser∣vants, and doom'd to remediless Ruin: But if we are found, through Grace in the Re∣deemer, to have answered in a good Measure, the great Ends of our Being; to have acted well in our Orbit, and to have been Service∣able
<PB N="7" REF="008888_0006_10309060579483A8"/>
in the advancement of Christ's Kingdom, and the best Interest of that Body to which we belonged, we shall through the Merits of our Lord and Saviour, receive an ample Re∣ward, even a crown of life in the coming world. And of all Men it concerns us thus to Serve GOD and our Generation: for our Advanta∣ges are distinguishing, and our Obligations arise in Proportion to our Privileges and Ad∣vantages. The Word of GOD plainly re∣veals, and strictly enjoyns this, <HI>that more sure Word of Prophecy, whereunto we do well that we take Heed.</HI> This is implied and inculcated in the Words of our Text. <HI>But as God hath distributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk.</HI> — The Duty enjoyn∣ed with divine Authority is plain, altho' the Reward is not particularly mentioned: but all Gospel Precepts, Encouragements and Exhortations are urged with this Motive, (viz.) That they who reject the divine Coun∣sels and continue Obstinate shall perish in their Rebellion; while they that hearken, be∣lieve, and obey, through the efficacious In∣fluences of the Holy Ghost, shall for Jesus's sake, be gloriously and eternally Rewarded.</P>
<P>Some indeed have thought these Words were connected with, and the Truth contain∣ed therein, a natural and necessary Conse∣quence from what the Apostle had laid down
<PB N="8" REF="008888_0007_10309064575A9B70"/>
in the foregoing Verses: But others suppose them to be the beginning of the following Discourse, wherein he treats of Christians of all Ranks and Orders abiding in their respec∣tive Callings, and faithfully discharging the Duties thereof.</P>
<P>This appears to me the Apostles Design; and thus I shall apply and improve the Text.</P>
<P>The Words are very comprehensive, and include all Men, of all Ranks, and of all De∣nominations; Men of every Station, and e∣very Character, from the highest to the low∣est, that have any Gifts of any Kind or De∣gree, whereby they are capable of usefulness in their Generation; as well him that has but one Talent, as him that hath five or ten. <HI>According as GOD hath distributed to him,</HI> so he is strongly bound and obliged faithfully to improve his Gifts or Talents, and in that Calling wherein God hath called him. For the Apostle goes on and says, <HI>as the Lord hath called every one.</HI> That God who gives us dif∣fering Gifts, and qualifies us for different Of∣fices, hath called us thereunto, &amp; commend∣ed us to abide therein, &amp; faithfully discharge the several Duties thereof. <HI>As the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk</HI> — Let him a∣bide in the Post wherein God hath fixed him, and there let him act as one that expects to give an Account. Wherefore in treating
<PB N="9" REF="008888_0008_103090678138FD00"/>
upon the Words of the Text thus opened and explained, I shall Observe,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> That God hath variously distributed his Gifts among Men, and qualified them for a Diver∣sity of Business in the World.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> As God hath distributed his Gifts unto Men, and qualified them for, so he hath called them to act their Part in different Of∣fices.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Shew that it highly concerns every one to abide in his Office or Calling, and faithfully discharge the several Duties of it.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> Conclude with an Address to divers Orders of Men, humbly exhorting them faithfully to improve the Gifts which God hath given them in their respective Callings.</P>
<P>To each of these in their Order.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> God hath variously distributed his Gifts among Men, and qualified them for a Diversity of Business in the World.</P>
<P>GOD has a great Work to be carried on in the World by Men as Instruments; and hath imparted Gifts to all, that every one may be busily engaged, and afford an helping Hand
<PB N="10" REF="008888_0009_10309069273F35F0"/>
according to his Ability, and not a Man to be idle. And as there are various Parts of the same Work to be managed and perform∣ed, some of a more difficult Nature, and of greater Importance, and some of less, so he hath proportioned his Gifts accordingly. See Mat. 25.14, 15. <HI>For the Kingdom of Heaven is as a Man travelling into a far Coun∣try, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods: and unto one he gave five Pounds, to another two, and to another one, to every Man according to his several ability; and straightway took his Journey; saying unto them, occupy till I come.</HI> Luk. 19.13. Agreeably to this, the Apostle says, Rom. 12.6. <HI>Having then Gifts differing according to the Grace that is given us.</HI> This was spoken with immedi∣ate Regard to the Church, considered as a religious Body. But it is true when applied to the State; &amp; likewise when to the Church and State; considered as a collective Body. Accordingly when we view the whole Body, we see Gifts of a different Kind, and differ∣ing in Degree, dispersed abroad among the Children of Men.</P>
<P>God hath abundantly inriched some with royal Gifts and Graces, and qualified them to sit upon the Throne, to wear the Crown and sway the Sceptre: <HI>For it is by him that Kings reign and Princes decree Justice</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8.15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008888_0010_1030906E5C175860"/>
To Others, he hath given Wisdom and Understanding, sagacious and penetrating. Minds, Quickness of Apprehension, and a firm unshaken Resolution, as well as Loyalty fitting for Ministers of State, to sit round a∣bout the King, and assist him in his impor∣tant Counsels.</P>
<P>To Others, he hath given peculiar Gifts to govern in their respective Provinces: clothed them with a natural Authority in their very Make, and endowed them with an agreeable Mixture of Skill and Wisdom, In∣tegrity and Meekness, Judgment &amp; Mercy, that all around are disposed to honour and obey them with Freedom and Chearfulness.</P>
<P>To Others he hath imparted the proper Gifts of Judges and Counsellors, distinguish∣ing them with the Faculty of discerning be∣tween Right &amp; wrong, and endowing them with a steady Mind, and a Principle of Righ∣teousness, that with courage and resolution they may judge with righteous Judgment, <HI>justifying the righteous and condemning the wick∣ed,</HI> agreeable to the Command given us in Deut. 25.1. And to these he hath variously distributed his Gifts, to some in greater De∣grees, to others in less, as there are Posts of Honour of the same Kind, but of a different Degree. As one is to act in a more elevated Station, and another in a less.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="008888_0011_10309070189C2BC0"/>
To others he hath given the Faculty of Speaking, and the Art ot reasoning &amp; plea∣ding in Matters of Controversy; that Right may take Place, and the innocent be cleared, while the guilty are punished; and every one have Justice done him.</P>
<P>And Others he hath formed for executive Justice, that our Rights may be maintained, Vice and Immorality suppressed, and the best good of the Common-wealth promoted.</P>
<P>At the same Time our God, through the Riches of his Grace in Christ the Redeemer, <HI>who purchased the Church with his own Blood,</HI> hath furnished Others with Gifts and Graces suited to the important Work of the sacred Ministry. And among these he hath vari∣ously distributed his Gifts.</P>
<P>To some he hath given great Degrees of Knowledge, both divine and humane, Depth of Judgment, and a large Acquaintance es∣pecially with polemical Divinity, and set them with <HI>Paul</HI> for the Defence of the Gos∣pel; Some he hath made Boanerges Sons of Thunder, to alarm the secure, and reform the profane: To some he hath given the Charms of Eloquence, that like <HI>Apollos</HI> of old, they have a distinguishing Faculty of alluring and perswading weary and heavy la∣den Sinners to cast themselves with all their Burdens upon the blessed Jesus: Some he
<PB N="13" REF="008888_0012_1030907221700348"/>
hath endued with the Gift of opening and explaining the Scriptures, and of applying them rightly &amp; seasonably to wounded Con∣sciences: And to others he hath given the happy Talent of healing Breaches and resto∣ring Peace to broken Churches, and of en∣couraging and building them up unto the Kingdom of Glory.</P>
<P>Some Degree of these Gifts all true Mini∣sters have; but while some excel in one, o∣thers do in another. So that this being the Case, the Kingdom of the Redeemer is built up in the World, through the promised Pre∣sence and Blessing of Jesus Christ, and the Interest of the Common-wealth greatly ad∣vanced.</P>
<P>And while God the glorious <HI>Author and Giver of every good &amp; perfect Gift,</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">James 1.17.</NOTE> is grant∣ing to some the Faculty of administring to, and healing the distempered Soul of its spiri∣tual Maladies, as Instruments; he is furnish∣ing others with Gifts suitable to administer to, and heal the sick and diseased Body, through his sovereign Blessing accompanying their Endeavours.</P>
<P>Others, our God, who stiles himself <HI>a Man of War,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 15.3.</NOTE> hath formed for the Field of Battle: <HI>He is their Strength, and teaches their Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight:</HI><NOTE N="†">Psal. 144.1</NOTE>
<PB N="14" REF="008888_0013_103090774FF80728"/>
And he sets them as Barriers to our Kingdom and Country; and makes them the formi∣dable, and yet glorious Defenders of our Rights, Liberties and Privileges.</P>
<P>Some, God qualifies to manage Trade and mercantile Affairs even to the remotest Parts of the Earth, whereby a Kingdom is inrich∣ed: and others are prepared to furrow the vast and wide Ocean, in their swift Ships to transport their Effects.</P>
<P>And while some are most ingenious at Mechanicks, others well understand, and di∣ligently pursue the Business of Husbandry, and cultivate <HI>the Field</HI> by which <HI>the King him∣self is served.</HI><NOTE N="‖">Eccl. 5.9.</NOTE> Thus God hath variously dis∣tributed his Gifts among the Children of Men.</P>
<P>These differing Gifts, and a Disposition or Inclination to use and improve them in dif∣ferent Callings, is of that God <HI>who has the Hearts of all Men, even the Hearts of Kings in his Hands, and turneth them as the Rivers of Waters, whithersoever he will.</HI> As a most in∣genious Author says, upon a like Subject; <Q>He qualifies <HI>Judah</HI> to sway the Sceptre, and disposes <HI>Issachar</HI> to couch as an Ass under Burthens; he prepares <HI>Zebulon</HI> to dwell at the Haven of the Sea, and to do Business upon the mighty Waters; <HI>Benja∣min</HI> to ravin as a Wolf, and <HI>Levi</HI> to teach <HI>Jacob</HI> his Judgment, &amp; <HI>Israel</HI> his Law.</Q><NOTE N="†">The late Mr. <HI>Pemberton.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="15" REF="008888_0014_10309078F5EDF438"/>
All these things are of God, that none may boast, but all be humble and thank∣ful, and improve their Gifts and Talents to the Honour of him that gave them, and learn that Lesson, 1 Cor. 4.6, 7. <HI>Not to think of Men above that which is written, that no one be pussed up for one against another. For who maketh Thee to differ from another? and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at hast thou, that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</HI> Which brings me to say</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>As God hath distributed his Gifts unto Men, and qualified them for, so he hath called them to act their Part in different Offices.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But as God hath distributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk</HI>— As he hath distributed his Gifts unto Men, and thereby fitted them for Usefulness in the World, some to act in an higher Station, and some in a lower; Some in a more pub∣lick Capacity, and some in a more private; so he hath called every one to his own Work and Business, and bid us abide in our several Callings.</P>
<P>As Man is made a sociable Creature, and as the Design of his Maker was, that he should be formed into Society; and as there are ne∣cessary Works of different Kinds and Degrees
<PB N="16" REF="008888_0015_1030907AA34678C8"/>
to be performed in every Society in Order to advance the good of the whole; so it is ne∣cessary that one should be fixed above another in a more dignified Station than his Neigh∣bour; and each one exert himself in his pro∣per Post, according to his several Ability. And thus God, the great Lord of the Uni∣verse, who is all wise and infinitely good, a God of Order, and not of Confusion, hath called and fixed every of us. He hath not only furnished us with Gifts, but assigned us a Work to exercise them in. And every One, according as his Talents are, and his Calling is, is under proportionable Obliga∣tions to be diligent in Business, servent in Spirit, serving God and his Generation. † Indeed we have all one general Calling, and that is to be Christians: But considered as Christians, we have different Works assigned us, and we are called to different Offices.</P>
<P>Some he hath called to civil Posts of Ho∣nour, fixing them above their fellow-men in General, investing them with Authority from on high, some with greater Degrees, and some with less, and bidding them rule in the Fear of God. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.3. All such are called of God, and their Authority is from him <HI>who rules in the Kingdom of Men. For Promotion cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South,</HI> no, nor
<PB N="17" REF="008888_0016_1030907D86332880"/>
from the North, <HI>But God is the Judge: He putteth down one, and setteth up another.</HI> Psal. 75.6, 7. And because God hath exalted them to an elavated Station, and clothed them with that Authority wherein they are to act in some Measure like himself, he hath <HI>called them Gods,</HI> but at the same Time, told them that <HI>they should die like Man,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 82.6 7.</NOTE> that they may be humble and dependant, and walk righte∣ously before him. The Apostle confirms this in the new Testament, and says, Rom. 13.1, 2, 4. <HI>For there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be, are ordained of God. Who∣soever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God: and they that resist shall re∣ceive to themselves Damnation. For he is the Minister of God to Thee for good.</HI> And having called them to, and fixed them in their ele∣vated Posts, he bids them abide therein, and improve their superior Gifts and Advantages for the best good of the Community in which his Providence hath made them Rulurs. Their Calling and Business is, to consult the Interest of the Common-wealth, to enact Laws which have a direct Tendency to promote the good of the whole, and see them well executed. In all which, they are to have Respect to the <HI>Law of God, which is exceeding broad,</HI> and see to it, that all their Laws are consistent with, and consonant to the divine
<PB N="18" REF="008888_0017_1030907F2F8F3778"/>
Law, as they would answer the great and glorious Ends of Government. Indeed it is of the last Importance, that civil Rulers be well acquainted with the Law of God, and possessed of the Gospel Religion; that they <HI>be renewed in the Spirit of their Minds,</HI> and u∣nited to Jesus Christ by a living Faith which is productive of all good Works. It is so, as they would be emminently serviceable to the Common-wealth, and able to give a good Account of their Stewardship, and receive that blessed Sentence, in the great and last Day, recorded, Mat. 25.21. <HI>Well done thou good and faithful Servant; Thou hast been faith∣ful over a few things, I will make Thee Ruler over many things: enter Thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI> Civil Rulers stand in the cause of God, and they rule for God; they are his Vice-gerents, and the Judgment they pass is the Lord's. Wherefore it concerns them to secure the divine Presence, and act under the Influence of the divine Spirit; re∣membring the Charge given them, 2 Chron. 19.6. <HI>Take Heed what ye do; for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in in the Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Civil Rulers should be wise and under∣standing Men, especially should they well understand the Business of their exalted Sta∣tion. <HI>Wo to Thee, O Land, when thy King is
<PB N="19" REF="008888_0018_103090858817F9C8"/>
a Child.</HI> i. e. when civil Rulers are unac∣quainted with their proper Work and Busi∣ness. But happy are they who have Rulers that are Men of Skill and Wisdom to con∣cert Measures for their Peace and Safety; for <HI>by Men of Understanding and Knowledge, the State is prolonged.</HI> Wherefore the Direction given in this Case is, Deut. 1.13. <HI>Take ye wise Men and understanding, and well known among your Tribes, and I will make them Rulers over you.</HI> Moreover, civil Rulers should be Men of Righteousness, and free from Parti∣ality. The Sceptre of our God is a Sceptre of Righteousness; and the righteous Lord loveth Righteousness, and hateth Iniquity. <HI>Holy, just and true are all the Administrations of his Providence, and clear and righteous are all his Ways, and all his Judgments.</HI> And civil Rulers are to imitate him in Point of Righ∣teousness. As God respects not the Person of any, so neither should civil Rulers; <HI>for they judge for the Lord.</HI> The celebrated Judge HALE would not receive a Present at the Hands of a Man, whose cause he was about to judge, knowing that a <HI>Gift,</HI> as the wise Man expresses it, Prov. 17.8. <HI>is as a precious Stone in the Eyes of him that receiveth it; whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</HI> It dazzles the Eyes, and perverts the Judgment of him that receives it. It tends to this, and
<PB N="20" REF="008888_0019_1030908780AED9B8"/>
hath this Effect, (it is to be feared,) on some' but (we hope) not on all. It would be well for Rulers and Judges to look upon Persons as Strangers in some Sense, as unknown by them, when they are about to judge their Cause, and judge with Righteous Judgment. Lev. 19.15 <HI>Ye shall do no unrighteousness in Judgment: Thou shalt not respect the Person of the poor, nor honour the Person of the mighty; but in Righteousness shalt thou judge thy neigh∣bour.</HI> And see Deut. 1.17. <HI>Ye shall not re∣spect Persons in Judgment, but you shall hear the small as well as the great.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, civil Rulers should be of an undaunted Courage and Resolution, Firm∣ness of Mind, and a steadfast Resolution to maintain the Honour, and answer the Ends of Government are highly necessary in all that wield the Sword of Justice, that they may put an End to Vice as much as possible, and promote Religion and Virtue. And it concerns them to put on Courage, and at all Times carry an even Hand, paying no slavish Regard to the Frowns, nor the Flatteries of Men. Deut. 1.17. <HI>You shall not be afraid of the Face of man, for the Judgment is God's.</HI> They are set for a Terror to evil Doers, and for a Praise to them that do well.</P>
<P>Moreover, civil Rulers should be Men of Kindness and Mercy. Our God is a merci∣ful
<PB N="21" REF="008888_0020_103090897388B020"/>
God, &amp; Mercy his beloved Attribute. <HI>He pi∣ties his People under all their Afflictions and Bur∣dens as a Father pities his Children.</HI> And ci∣vil Rulers are the Fathers of a Common∣wealth, who should have a tender Concern for the Rights and Interests of the People, and ever consult their Happiness; endea∣vour that they may enjoy their Liberties, and study to alleviate their Burdens as much as possible. All our Eyes are upon them, and especially do the Eyes of the needy wait on them for Help and Relief, and the injured for Redress. They should look upon it, as their Privilege, as well as Duty, to shew Compassion to the Common-People under all their Wants and Grievances; and be rea∣dy to afford all reasonable Encouragement to every thing found among them laudable and commendable. And although it be∣comes them, with an undaunted Courage to frown upon Vice, and punish Criminals, yet it should be done with a tender Heart, and a compassionate Mind; not as if they de∣lighted in Cruelty, but as being necessitated to act as they do in Point of Righteousness, and in Order to maintain the Honour of Religion, and the Safety of the Common∣wealth.</P>
<P>Moreover, civil Rulers should be of a ge∣nerous publick Spirit. Our God is infinitely
<PB N="22" REF="008888_0021_1030908C4AE07450"/>
good in himself, and in the Communications of his Goodness unto us, Mat. 5.45. <HI>He maketh his Sun to rise on the evil, and on the good; and sendeth Rain on the just, and on the unjust.</HI> So should civil Rulers diffuse their Blessings abroad, and be rich in all good Works that tend to promote the Interest of the Community. As civil Fathers, they should have an affectionate Concern for the Rights of the People, looking upon their Interests as their own, and esteeming the flourishing State of the Common-wealth, their own Security and Prosperity. The A∣postle says, 1 Cor. 10.24. <HI>Let no Man seek his own;</HI> not his own, only; but every Man anothers Wealth. And again, 1 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Charity,</HI> that Godlike Principle of Charity which should be in every Heart, and especially in the Hearts of Rulers, and which is absolutely necessary to constitute a good and profitable Man, <HI>seeketh not her own.</HI> Nor her own only, but anothers. It is not private, narrow and selfish, but open, free and generous, concerned for the publick good. And indeed we can take no Method that will advance our Interest so readily, as to study and pursue the good of the publick.</P>
<P>Once more here, civil Rulers should be Men fearing God, and practising real Piety. Their Business is, to enact good and whole∣some
<PB N="23" REF="008888_0022_103090905061F458"/>
Laws, and then shew their Regard to them by an agreeable Walk and Conversa∣tion. Examples in Rulers, if bad, will have a Multitude of Followers; and let them be ever so strict in punishing Delinquents, it will signify little or nothing towards reform∣ing them, if at the same Time, they shew a disregard to the Laws themselves. But if, on the contrary, they live peaceable and quiet Lives, in all Godliness, and appear to be Men that fear the Lord and hate Covetousness, their Example will be likely to influence all around them. If the political Head is sick, the whole Body will be faint, but if the Head is in a good State of Health, the Body will be well. When Kings of old ruled well, and lived well, <HI>Things went well in Judah.</HI> In∣deed there are always Exceptions under ge∣neral Rules; but in the Nature and Order of things, such a Practice in Heads or Rulers has this Tendency. Thus briefly, these things, this Temper and Practice in Rulers are of happy Consequence. And having these Qua∣lifications, and being fixed in Posts of Honor by divine Providence, it becomes them to abide in their Calling, and diligently perform the several Duties of their Office, ruling for GOD, and the good of the People. <HI>So let them Walk.</HI>— Let them abide in their Posts, and study to do their own Business. See the
<PB N="24" REF="008888_0023_10309093782D7840"/>20th Verse of the Context; <HI>Let every Man abide in the same Calling wherein he is called.</HI> Let him give himself especially to this Work; although under our present Circum∣stances, he may be obliged to busy himself, at Times, in some of the common Employ∣ments of Life, yet let this Work bear its due Weight upon his Mind: Let him labour for the greatest Acquaintance with the Nature of it, and the several Duties belonging to it, and be always ready to perform them in in such a Manner, as shall tend to advance the Interest of Religion, and of the Com∣munity.</P>
<P>And while God is furnishing some with Gifts suited to manage this great and impor∣tant Work, and calling them to it; he fur∣nishes others with Gifts and Graces suited to carry on the glorious Work of the Ministry, and calls them to that. A difficult but an honourable Work, and a Work of the great∣est Importance. Of all Men, it concerns the Ambassadors of Christ, the Ministers of the everlasting Gospel to be Men of Godli∣ness; to be well acquainted with their Ma∣sters Will, and do the Work of the Lord faithfully. 'Tis of infinite Importance that they be converted to God by the Power of divine Grace, and experimentally, as well as doctrinally acquainted with the Methods
<PB N="25" REF="008888_0024_10309095808AA430"/>
of Grace, and with the Operations of the holy Ghost in convincing and converting Sinners from the Power of Sin and Satan un∣to the living and true God; and in building them up in Faith and Holiness unto his eter∣nal Kingdom: <HI>That they be wise and faith∣ful, apt to teach, and able rightly to divide the Word of Truth, giving to every one his Portion in due Season: That they be exemplary in Con∣versation, in Faith, in Charity and in Purity;</HI> and that they have a sincere View at the Glo∣ry of the Redeemer, and be heartily engaged for the Eternal Salvation of precious and im∣mortal Souls. It infinitely concerns us to meditate on the Duties of our Office, <HI>and give ourselves wholly to them;</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 4.15</NOTE> and <HI>deliver all the Counsel of God, and to be pure from the Blood of all Men.</HI><NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot">Acts 20.26.</NOTE> It highly concerns us to be engaged to secure the divine Presence, that we may go forth from Time to Time, in the Fulness of the Blessings of the Gospel of Peace, and offer well beaten Oil. It con∣cerns us to preach a crucified Saviour, and all the Doctrines inculcated in his Gospel: The Fall of Man by Sin, his moral Depravity and Impotency — Redemption by Christ alone, the great Mediator of the Covenant of Grace — The Doctrine of the everblessed and ado∣rable Trinity — And God's Sovereignty in the Displays of his Grace in the Salvation of
<PB N="26" REF="008888_0025_1030909980CD71C0"/>
Sinners through the Blood of Christ— The absolute Necessity of spiritual Regeneration in Order to live to God here, and enjoy him for ever — Free Justification through the mediatorial Righteousness of Christ re∣ceived by Faith — And the Necessity of the efficacious Influences of the holy Spirit to carry on the Work of Sanctification in the Hearts of Believers — A Life of Repen∣tance towards God, Love to God and our neighbour, a Christian Spirit, and an hea∣venly Life, as Evidences of a gracious State, and the Way leading to eternal Blessedness. Yea it concerns us to preach up all moral Duties in their Place, but charge our People to remember that neither these, nor Faith itself have any share in our Justification be∣fore God, as if there was any Merit therein: And let them know that the Atonement of Christ is the sole meritorious Cause of that, while Faith is the instrumental Cause, or that by which we receive the Merit of the Redeemer's Blood: a Faith which works by Love, purifies the Heart, and influences to new Obedience. It concerns us also to preach the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body at the last Day — of a future ge∣neral Judgment — and an eternal State of Rewards and Punishments assigned to every one according as he is found at Death. Thus
<PB N="27" REF="008888_0026_1030909C88475AB0"/>
in a Word, it becomes the Ministers of Christ, (being qualified and called of God, and regularly introduced into the work;) It becomes them to abide and <HI>walk as the Lord hath called them.</HI> While the civil Ruler is to wait on his Ruling, the Gospel Minister is to wait on his Ministry. And while God is placing some in the Chair of Government, and calling Others to the Work of the Mi∣nistry; he is commanding others to march into the Camp, and to meet the Enemy in the Field of Battle; and others, the main Body of the People to manage the common Business of Life. And there is a great Di∣versity of Business besides that of the Magis∣tracy and Ministry, to manage which the Generality of the People are called, some to do this, and others that, every one having his particular Office, and something to do. There is none omitted, or passed by, nor need any be useless, but all serviceable, eve∣ry one performing his Part to advance the good of the whole, and so answering the great End of his Being. There is not a Member of the Body politick to be despised; nor may one glory over another, as if he stood in no Relation to him, or had no De∣pendance upon him. We are all mutually dependant upon, and obliged to one ano∣ther. And if he that is fixed in the lowest Sta∣tion,
<PB N="28" REF="008888_0027_1030909FB2F6F388"/>
and called to the meanest Office, <HI>walks as he is called,</HI> and faithfully discharges the Duties of his Post, he is a profitable Mem∣ber; and he that is called to a more eleva∣ted Station cannot say, he has no need of him. As it is in the natural Body, so it is in the civil and religious. 1 Cor. 12.21. <HI>The Eye cannot say unto the Hand, I have no need of Thee; nor again the Head to the Feet, I have no need of you.</HI> Thus God, the Sove∣reign Lord of the universe, hath called us to, and fixed us in different Posts, in which we are to act our Part, and not interfere with, nor interrupt one another; but every one mind his own Business and do his own work. Which brings me to say,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>It highly concerns every one to abide in his own Calling or Office, and faithfully discharge the several Duties of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As God hath distributed to every Man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk</HI>— Let him keep his Post and exert himself therein. But here I will offer a few things which may serve to illustrate the Point, and excite to the Duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God hath distributed to us our several Gifts for this End, and commanded us to im∣prove them in our respective Callings.</HI> We can answer the End of our Beings no other way; For this Purpose our Gifts and Ta∣lents
<PB N="29" REF="008888_0028_103090A1AC486148"/>
are distributed to us; and to this we are commanded and urged in the sacred Scriptures. <HI>So let him walk,</HI> saith the A∣postle in the Text. And in the 20th ver. <HI>Let every Man abide in the same Calling, wherein he is called.</HI> And, I Thes. 4.11. <HI>That ye study to be quiet, and to do your own Business</HI> We have no Right nor Liberty to leave our own Office, and invade anothers. Kings them∣selves, as Kings, have no Right to invade the Office of the Gospel Minister; nor may the wisest of Rulers break over into that sa∣cred Inclosure; much less may illeterate, unskilful Men, who need to be taught the first Principles of Religion. King <HI>Uzziah</HI> attempted to offer Incense upon the Altar, and God smote him with a Leprosy, and he was a Leper to the Day of his Death. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26th Chap. So neither should Gospel Mini∣sters leave their proper work and Business, and intermeddle too much with the Affairs of State. When they begin to set them∣selves up for States-men, in Opposition to those that are qualified, and called to that Work, it presently introduces Confusion, and tends to weaken the common Cause. So when they involve themselves in the com∣mon Business of Life, and neglect that Work to which the Lord hath especially called them, it is very hurtful to the Interest
<PB N="30" REF="008888_0029_103090A5D8509430"/>
of the Church and State. This undoubtedly opens a Door for Men, that have no Right, to invade their Office. It was an Observa∣tion of one Mr. <HI>Strong,</HI> whom Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> mentions as an eminent and judicious Mini∣ster, <Q>That God hath permitted so many to intrude into the Ministers Calling, because Ministers have too much meddled with, and intruded into other Men's Cal∣lings.</Q> God has not required this at our Hands, nor do we answer the End of our Gifts, by neglecting our own Work, and undertaking that which properly belongs to another, although we are ever so engaged, and ever so laborious in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To abide in our own Callings, and exert our Gifts therein, is the way to promote a gene∣ral Reformation, real Religion, and the Hap∣piness of the Community.</HI> As we would see the Redeemers Kingdom flourish, and the Common-wealth in Peace and Prosperity, it concerns us, One and all, to fly to our Posts, and be industrious in our Callings, and cul∣tivate Religion in our own Hearts. If all acted in this manner, we should have wise, merciful and righteous Rulers, of a publick Spirit, who would be careful to enact whole∣some Laws, and see them put in Execution; to set Shining Examples of Piety, and use their Influence to promote universal Godli∣ness.
<PB N="31" REF="008888_0030_103090A8B0712368"/>
We should have a learned, a pious and a faithful Ministry, who would have the Interest of Religion at Heart. And we should be an industrious, thankful and fru∣gal People. We should be <HI>like Trees planted by the Rivers of Water which take Root down∣ward, and bear Fruit upward, and bring forth their Fruit in the Season thereof.</HI> Our Houses would be Houses of Prayer, and we should be careful to cultivate real Religion in the Hearts of our Children, and bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, by di∣vine Assistance; teaching them the Know∣ledge of God, and the Way of Life by Jesus Christ; and Loyalty and Submission to law∣ful Authority, as well as an honourable Esteem for the Gospel Ministry. This would empty Taverns of Throngs and Crowes of Town∣Inhabitants, and sweep our Streets of Swarms of idle Drones, and prevent ten thousand Mischiefs felt by Reason of those that desert their Callings, and hide their Talents. This would prevent Evil-Surmisings, Vain-Bab∣lings, Intemperance, unlawful Gaming, and all Manner of Unrighteousness; and conse∣quently, Multitudes of needless and charge∣able Law-Suits. This would give a Check to all Kinds of Vice and Immorality, and intro∣duce Religion and Virtue. We should then <HI>seek first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteous∣ness</HI>;
<PB N="32" REF="008888_0031_103090AB8E18F688"/>
and do good to Mankind, and especi∣ally to the Community, to which we belong∣ed. This would heal our Breaches, and pro∣mote Peace and good Order; and we should go on with one Heart, and one Mind in ways that lead to our truest Happiness. We should then be diligent in Business, and faithful in our Betrustments, and not hinder, but help one another, not aggravate, but alleviate each others Burthens. And in this Way, every one from the greatest to the least, might do something towards a general Reformation, and strengthening and enriching the Com∣mon-Wealth. But if we desert our Callings, and neglect our Gifts, we shall hinder, and not promote the blessed Work, and impover∣ish and waste the Community, and enrich it. We shall do nothing towards advancing Re∣ligion, nor the common good, unless we act in that Sphere, in which God hath fixed us. 2 Tim. 2.5. <HI>If any Man strive for Masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To walk as the Lord hath called us, and well improve the Gifts distributed to us, is the way to be able to give a good Account of ourselves in the Day of the Lord, and receive a glorious Reward through the Merits of Christ.</HI> We have our several Talents delivered to us, and <HI>the Lord hath called us</HI> to our Work, and bid us <HI>occupy till he comes.</HI> We are all in the
<PB N="33" REF="008888_0032_103090AD521BF4B0"/>
Place of Stewards, and must in a little Time; <HI>give an Account of our Stewardship.</HI> Luke 16.2▪ Whether we have wasted our Lord's Goods, or improved them well, we must give an Ac∣count, and be rewarded according as we are found, And we shall stand alike round about the Throne of our impartial and almighty Judge, rich and poor, high and low, Rulers and ruled, <HI>and blessed shall they be, whom their Lord when he comes, sshall find so doing.</HI> Mat. 24.46. In the Post where God hath fixed them, and performing as he commanded them. If we are found out of our Callings; doing what is forbidden, or abusing our Gifts; we may expect nothing but to be frowned a∣way from the blissful Presence of the great Judge: But if we are doing the Will of God, we may give up our Accounts with of Joy, and shall be made unspeakably Happy for ever in the immediate Enjoyment of God himself, to the Praise of sovereign Grace in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Another Motive I shall offer to excite every one to Diligence and Faithfulness in the Improve∣ments of his Gifts, in the Calling wherewith God called us, may be a Consideration of the remarka∣ble Dispensations of divine Providence towards us, is the Year past.</HI> God's dispensations to∣wards us in the Year past have been quite re∣markable; and call aloud to every One to
<PB N="34" REF="008888_0033_103090B0252AADD0"/>
Mind his own Business, and do his own Work, and make ready to appear before him.</P>
<P>In his holy and righteous Providence he hath seen fit to take away by Death, our gra∣cious King GEORGE the SECOND, of blessed Memory; the civil Father of the English Na∣tion; and a most indulgent Father: who in his Life, was ever concerned for, and tender of the Rights and Liberties of his British <HI>Is∣rael.</HI> In whose happy Reign and under whole blessed Influence, the Nation, for a long Time, enjoyed the greatest of Liberties and best of Privileges. And verily his Death gave the whole Kingdom a Shock, and was enough to put every Subject upon a serious Enquiry; what have we done, that God is provoked to take our King and our Head from us? And this little Province hath spe∣cial Reason to be alarmed, to awake, and be∣take ourselves to God, and put our Trust and Confidence in him, and look unto him for the sanctification of this awful Providence: For he was a Father to us indeed, from whom we received large Benefits in a Time when greatly needed. We should even sunk under the Weight of our heavy Burdens in the pre∣sent distressing War, had not we been en∣couraged and supported by him. But he is gone. The mighty is fallen before Death, <HI>the King of Terrors</HI>: That mighty Monarch,
<PB N="35" REF="008888_0034_103090B568A3F610"/>
and greatly beloved hath taken up Lodg∣ings in the Dwellings of Darkness; and he will think no more for us, and can do no more for us.</P>
<P>This is a loud Call of divine Providence to us all, to abide in our Callings, well improve our Time, and our Gifts, and prepare to meet the Lord our Judge. Hereby they that are stiled Gods in the sacred Oracles, see that they must die as other Men. If Kings die, certainly their Subjects must, from the high∣est to the lowest. Wherefore it concerns us, one and all, to hearken to the voice of Pro∣vidence, and stand &amp; mourn, and return to our Duty. And agreeable to King Solomon's Advice, Eccl. 9.10. <HI>Do what our Hands find to do, with all our Might; for there is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wisdom in the Grave, whether we are going.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, it has been a Time of great Mortality throughout this Land: Multitudes both at Home and in our Armies have died, and the Places that knew them, will know them here no more. And by their Deaths, God says to us that are alive, be ye also rea∣dy; every one to his Post, and stand waiting for the Coming of your Lord.</P>
<P>But then, on the other Hand, we have re∣markable Favours in the midst of our Afflic∣tions, And while <HI>God's Judgments should learn
<PB N="36" REF="008888_0035_103090B726559170"/>
us Righteousness, his Goodness should lead us to Re∣pentance.</HI> Although it hath pleased Almighty God to take away by Death King GEORGE <HI>the Second,</HI> of blessed Memory, one of the best of Kings; yet he took him away <HI>in a good old Age, full of Days, Riches and Honour,</HI> as we read of King David, in 1 Chron. 29.28. And he left GEORGE the Third, his Grand∣son, to reign in his stead. On whom the Eyes of the British Nation are fixed, and in whom their Expectations are greatly raised.</P>
<P>One early and richly endowed with all roy∣al Gifts and Graces; and through whose In∣fluence we hope for the Enjoyment of the best of Liberties and Privileges for a great while to come.</P>
<P>His accession to the Throne was ordered in the most favourable Manner; all as one re∣joycing in it; no Usurper, nor vain Preten∣der interposing. And immediately upon his Accession, he issued out an excellent Procla∣mation, enjoyning all his Subjects, and espe∣cially all in Commission, to use their Influ∣ence to suppress Vice and Immorality, and encourage Religion and Virtue. Will God Almighty be with him and bless him, and make him a rich and lasting Blessing to his Church and People!</P>
<P>And this favourable Providence should ex∣cite Gratitude in every Mind, and quicken
<PB N="37" REF="008888_0036_103090B8DC8E3DE0"/>
us to <HI>walk as the Lord hath called us.</HI> In Ad∣dition to this, God hath granted abundant Success to our Arms in all Parts, and especi∣in this Land.</P>
<P>Brigadier General <HI>Murray</HI> with an hand∣ful of Men, under the divine Direction and Influence, defeated a numerous Army in their bloody Designs against <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beck,</HI> early in the Spring. And in the beginning of <HI>September</HI> General <HI>Amherst</HI> with his Army arrived, and landed on the South-West Part of <HI>Montreal,</HI> General <HI>Murray</HI> upon the North-East, while Colonel <HI>Haviland</HI> advanced upon the South-East, all at one critical Juncture, under the Influence and auspicious Smiles of Heaven. And that important Place, important to us, soon surrendred; A Place which hath been a Terror and a Destruction to those our northern Colonies, surrendred to the British Crown. A Mercy greatly desired, and ear∣nestly prayed for; and a Mercy granted in a Manner favourable vastly beyond our Ex∣pectations. And verily such remarkable Dispensations; Such Frowns on the one Hand, and such Favours on the other, are a loud Call to every one to seek the God of our Salvations, to betake ourselves to our re∣spective Posts, and diligently attend upon the Work and Business of our Callings. <HI>As God hath distributed to every Man, as the
<PB N="38" REF="008888_0037_103090BCE7599FA8"/>
Lord hath called every one, so let him walk</HI>— And from these Considerations it appears to be a matter of the greatest Importance.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I will now Conclude with a short Ad∣dress to several Orders of Men, humbly exhorting them to improve their Gifts in their respective Callings.</P>
<P N="1">1. I would humbly address the honourable, the Governour, the Deputy Governour, and the whole hounorable Assembly at present convened to act in their elevated Posts, for the best good of this Common-wealth.</P>
<P>May it please your Honours, I am here by your Call and Invitation; therefore, <HI>I beseech you, suffer the word of Exhortation.</HI></P>
<P>We have the greatest Reason to bless God, <HI>the Author and Giver of every good and perfect Gift,</HI> that he is raising up Men from Time to Time, and furnishing them with Gifts suitable to stand in the Gate, as <HI>Job</HI> expresseth it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 21 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> And we have Reason to bless God for the Liberty of choosing Men for this Purpose; and that he is pleased to incline and direct us in the Choice of such. We are sensible that a great Weight lies upon you: but that God who hath called you to the work, is able to support and direct
<PB N="39" REF="008888_0038_103090BFC364F138"/>
you in it. The great Lord of the Universe stiles you <HI>Gods</HI>; intimating thereby, that you are to imitate him in his imitable Pefecti∣ons: But then he tells you, <HI>that you must die like Men</HI>: Intimating that you should con∣stantly maintain a Sense of your Frailty and Mortality, and act as those that must give an Account. You are the Fathers of the Common-wealth, and all our Eyes are upon you.</P>
<P>Wherefore see to it that your Powers of Mind are sanctified by Grace; and always remember that you judge for the Lord. Look with an impartial Eye into all Matters laid be∣fore you, and act with a generous Spirit in whatever you do for the Government. Let the Interest of Religion, and the Welfare of the Community, (which indeed are necessarily connected) let these lye near your Hearts.</P>
<P>And we would commend the Gospel Mi∣nistry to you Care and Protection. We thank your Honours for your Care of us, and kind∣ness to us: and intreat you ever to encourage alearned, a pious and an Orthodox Ministry among us. We would also commend to your fatherly Care and Protection, the Col∣lege in this Government; and would be∣seech you for Jesus's sake, as you regard the flourishing of his Kingdom; to think of its present Situation, and use your Influence to
<PB N="40" REF="008888_0039_103090C2D0B5E0B8"/>suppress Vice and Extravagancy, and to en∣courage and promote real Piety and christian Virtue, as well as good Learning there; And we intreat you to encourage good Schooling among us, in all our Towns and Societies, that Knowledge and Religion may be cultivated throughout your Province. We would also commend to your Care and Encouragment, Trade and Manufactures, and especially Agri∣culture: Let the Husbandman ever be re∣membred by you; for if our Husbandry fails, we shall all, in a little Time, dwindle away to nothing.</P>
<P>Continue, we intreat you to encourage the Soldiery in this critical Juncture of Affairs, who go forth and endure Hardships for our Lives and Liberties. Our Burdens are great and heavy, I am sensible, but God hath help∣ed hitherto. We have been abundantly suc∣ceeded in our Warlike Enterprizes, which is Matter of great Encouragment.</P>
<P>And we would recommend it to you in all your Counsels, Acts and Judgments, to be of a calm and steady Mind, to carry an even Hand, and never be precipitate in your Re∣solutions and Determinations, and especially when the Case is Dark and intricate, and of great Consequence. <HI>Let your Moderation be known to all men,</HI> and let your Example in holy Conversation shine before the People,
<PB N="41" REF="008888_0040_103090C4C80106C8"/>
that they may take Pattern by you, <HI>and fol∣low you, as far as ye follow Christ your Lord and Master,</HI> remembring that you are under the lnspection of an Omniscient Judge, as well as we. And he is not afraid to say to unrighteous Rulers, ye are wicked: and it would be amazingly awful to fall from such an elevated Post, into the Regions of Horror and Despair. O dread the dreadful Conse∣quence! and see that your Hearts are right with God, and act with a sincere View at the advancement of his Glory, and the good of your People. And God, the God of Bles∣sings be with you, and afford you his Presence and Assistance, and make you eminent Blessings in your honourable Callings, and finally receive you to immortal Honour in his heavenly Kingdom, for Jesus's sake, your mighty Redeemer, where you shall be glori∣ously exalted, and rejoice triumphantly with Moses and Joshua, and all the true Servants of God for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I would humbly Address my Fathers and Brethren of the Gospel Ministry.</HI> Reverend Sirs; you are <HI>called of God</HI> to a difficult, but an important, and a glorious Work. Of all Men, we most need the divine Presence and Assistance; for we are acting immediately for the Lord, and the Salvation of precious and immortal Souls; the loss of one of which
<PB N="42" REF="008888_0041_103090C8C4FAC3D8"/>
would be greater than the loss of the whole World. Therefore, since <HI>we are to watch for Souls as they that must give an Account, let us take Heed to ourselves, and to the Flocks over which the holy Ghost hath made us Overseers. Let us deliver all the Counsel of God,</HI> preach all the Doctrines of the Gospel, and urge them with all the weighty Arguments that can be offered: <HI>Let us be instant in Season, and out of Season, enduring Hardships as good Sol∣diers, and not be weary in well doing, knowing that we shall reap in due Time, if we faint not.</HI> Let us mind our own Business, and shine in our own Orbs; let us study the Mind and Will of God, <HI>and bring out of our Treasuries, things new and old, and feed our People with Knowlege and with Understanding.</HI> Let us be determined above every Thing else, to know and preach Jesus Christ, and him Crucified: Let us urge Re∣pentance unfeigned towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus, and in their turn treat of all the Branches of christian Morality. Let us teach our People to fear God, and honour the King, to pray for all in Authori∣ty, to love and honour their Rulers, and pay a chearful Regard to their good and wholsom Laws. Let us labour in our Work to culti∣vate Religion in our own Hearts, and in the Hearts of our People, of all Ranks and Orders;
<PB N="43" REF="008888_0042_103090CBA2E99F40"/>
That they and we may well understand our Duty, abide in our Callings, and be diligent in our own Business, Blessings to the Common∣wealth, and Instruments of building up the Redeemer's Kingdom. And while we preach Peace and Salvation to others, let us labour to be at Peace among ourselves. Let us strive that brotherly Love may continue and abound among us, and be always ready to support each others Character, and assist one another under all our Tryals in our great and diffi∣cult Work; not hinder, but forward one a∣nother's Usefulness as much as possible. And for Encouragement, we serve a glorious Ma∣ster, who has said, <HI>Blessed is that Servant whom his Lord, when he cometh shall find so doing.</HI> Then let us see that our Hearts, our Views, our Aims, and our Ends are right, and be faithful unto Death, and then shall we receive a Crown of Life, and shine as the Stars of Heaven for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. And to conclude, <HI>I would address the Body of the People now assembled before the Lord.</HI> And suffer me to exhort and intreat you in the Name of our Lord Jesus, <HI>to walk as the Lord hath called you.</HI> Abide in your Callings, and look to the living God for the renewing and sanctifying Influences of his blessed Spi∣rit; and as God hath distributed his Gifts unto you, so improve them to his Honour and
<PB N="44" REF="008888_0043_103090CD5468E250"/>
Glory; and labour to be as useful and service∣able, as possible, to the Community, in your Day and Generation. Although you are not promoted to the Magistracy, nor called to the Ministry; yea, although you may not be fixed in any publick Posts of Honour, nor called to act in a publick Capacity, yet you are a free People, indulged with the greatest of Liberties and best of Privileges, and under great Advantages to serve God and your Ge∣neration. The chief Captain of the <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiery said, Acts 22.28. <HI>With a great Sum obtained I this Freedom.</HI> A Freedom not equal to yours, which you have upon free Cost. You have the Liberty of chusing your own Rulers, and your own Ministers; and Liberty to worship God according to the dictates of your own Consciences. And that you are governed by reasonable Laws, and obliged to submit to lawful Authority in what is just and right, is your Privilege, and not your Burthen. We are all, even Rulers themselves, and Ministers of the Gospel, sub∣ject to the same Laws, as the common Peo∣ple; and we are all Members of the same Common-wealth. Wherefore, bless God for your inestimable Privileges, and look upon yourselves the highly favoured of the Lord. Be contented with your own Posts, diligently
<PB N="45" REF="008888_0044_103090D05F530EE8"/>
attend upon your own Business, and do your own Work, to which <HI>the Lord hath called you,</HI> and never <HI>suffer as Busy-Bodies in other Men's Matters.</HI> Permit me, my <HI>dear Friends</HI> and Brethren, to urge and <HI>beseech you by the Bow∣els of Christ's Mercy,</HI> to secure the Knowlege of God, and see that you are united to the Lord Jesus by a living Faith, and that you are fruitful in all good Works. In your Places labour for a general Reformation; return to God yourselves by unfeigned Re∣pentance; amend what you find amiss in yourselves, and in your Families. Study the Peace and Welfare of the Common-wealth; look upon the general Interest of the Commu∣nity, as your own private interest; and every one afford an helping Hand, for we need you. Honour your Superiors, and pray for all in Authority, pray for Gospel Ministers, and pray for yourselves: For without the divine Blessing all our Labour and Pains will be lost.
