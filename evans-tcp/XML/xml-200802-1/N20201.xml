<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following History would most willingly have been excused from the service, had any other person appeared to have undertaken it. A work of this kind was wanted: The author, however unequal to the task, had advantages herefor above some others, being born in the western part, and having the bounds of his habitation fixed in the eastern part, of the county. Had the writer of these sheets known before he began, what a labour it would have been, he would not have attempted it, but having begun, he was unwilling to desist, and has been urged on by the partiality of his friends. However difficult the collection of materials has been, yet he has derived a satisfaction by no means small, in ransacking records, searching into the antiqui∣ties of this part of the country, and in endeavouring to gratify his readers with a history thereof.</P>
<P>The locality of the work may be thought, by some, an objection to it. But to have compleated a history of the Commonwealth, upon this plan, would be a labour too great, and too lengthy for any one, unless he was a person of fortune, and should devote a long life wholly thereunto. If various gentlemen, in different parts of the State, would undertake to write a history of their particular counties or districts, upon this, or a better plan, we might then hope to see a complete history of Massachusetts collected, which would be not merely entertaining, but profitable and instructive from age to age; care being taken to make such alterations in, and additions to the work, as
<PB N="vi" REF="026481_0005_0FD04FDB8AE903B8"/>
time would occasion: These would respect the civil and ecclesiastical state of the counties, their population, and their improvements in arts and manufactures.</P>
<P>The greatest care and pains have been taken to as∣certain exact dates, where it was possible. Hence towns and churches may know their respective ages, if at any time their records should be unhappily destroyed. The dates, however, are all inserted according to the origin∣als; and, therefore, the reader, in order to know when a century or more has elapsed from the date of any event recorded in this history, will always remember to add eleven days thereto, until he comes down to the <HI>2</HI>d of September <HI>1752,</HI> when New Style, so called, took place. For instance, if a town was incorporated August <HI>1, 1728,</HI> it will not have completed a full century until August <HI>12, 1828.</HI></P>
<P>The author of this work has endeavoured to be im∣partial, and to do justice to every town in its description and history, and if he has failed hereof, it must be im∣puted to other causes than any particular local preju∣dices. He has not omitted any thing worth preserving, which has come to his knowledge.</P>
<P>Many and too great defects will, most likely, be found by discerning readers of this history; but none, how∣ever, but such as their candor and ingenuity will readily excuse in this first attempt of the kind; and none but what may be remedied in time, if ever a future edition should be called for. And persons, who find defects or mistakes, or see the necessity of additions or alterations, are requested candidly to point them out to</P>

<HEAD>A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTY.</HEAD>
<P>THE County of Worcester, however small in its beginning,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The late Governor Hutchinson, who was then a member of the Gener∣al Court, strenuously opposed, as it is said, its being erected into a county; urging the utter improbability of its ever making any figure. He lived to see that he was greatly mistaken in his conjectures. This is an instance which may show us we have no certain rules to proceed upon in calculating the growth and population of new settlements; they, generally, exceed the most raised expectations of people, and, often, all rational probability.</NOTE> consisting of but fifteen or sixteen towns, the greater part of which were in∣fant plantations, with but few inhabitants, has

flourished and increased in the most rapid and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣prising manner. It has risen to eminence and dis∣tinction among the counties of the Common∣wealth; for while it is but the tenth in age, it is the third in wealth, paying a larger proportion of a state tax, than any of the other counties, except Suffolk and Essex, and falling but a little short of these two.</P>
<P>It is large in extent; being bounded on the south, almost equally, by the States of Connecti∣cut and Rhodeisland; and on the north by the state of Newhampshire. On the east it is bounded, <HI>mainly,</HI> by the county of Middlesex, just touch∣ing at its south east angle upon the county of Suffolk; and on the west by the county of Hamp∣shire. It is about 48 miles in length from north to south, and about 35 miles in width from east to west. It contains forty nine towns, the most of which are large in extent of lands, and number of inhabitants.</P>
<P>According to a late census, taken by an act of Congress, in order to a just apportionment of the number of Representatives among the several States, it contains 56807 souls.</P>

<P>IN the first and second Congress, under the present Constitution, this county was entitled to an eighth part in the representation of this Com∣monwealth. The Hon.

<PB N="22" REF="026481_0021_0FD0561F09EBD350"/>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Shrewsbury, was chosen to represent this county in the second Congress, whose term ex∣pired on the fourth of March, 1793. And where∣as by an enumeration of all the inhabitants of the United States lately made, the number of Repre∣sentatives for this Commonwealth, according to Constitution, is increased to fourteen; so the Le∣gislature by a late Act, joined the counties of Worcester, Hampshire and Berkshire, in one dis∣trict, for the choice of four Representatives for the third Congress; one of whom was to be chosen in each county, and the fourth in either of the three. At the late election, in this district, the Hon. Ar∣temas Ward, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was chosen Representative for this county, by a large majority of the votes of the three counties. The Representative chosen for the district, in whose election this county gives its voice, is the Hon. Dwight Foster, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Brookfieid, the late Sheriff of the county of Wor∣cester.</P>

<HEAD>WORCESTER.</HEAD>
<P>AS this is the shire town of the county of Worcester, we will first give an account and descrip∣tion of this place, and then proceed to the other towns in the county according to their respective ages, reckoning from the dates of the acts of incor∣poration.</P>
<P>Worcester is <HI>part</HI> of a tract of land called by the aboriginals, <HI>Quinfigamond</HI>; which territory was by them esteemed to bound easterly, partly on Quinsigamond pond, and partly on Hassanamisco, now Grafton; southerly, on the Nipnet, or Nip∣mug country, where Oxford and some adjacent towns now are; westerly, on Quaboag, now Brook∣field, and lands in that vicinity; and northerly, on Nashawogg, now Lancaster, Sterling, &amp;c. &amp;c. On October 24th, 1668, a township of land of rather more than eight miles square, to be bound∣ed, easterly on Quinsigamond pond, was granted by the General Court, to Daniel Gookin, Daniel Henchman, Thomas Prentice, and their associates. But war, at that time, and for several succeeding years, prevailing with the Indians, the settlement of the place was prevented until the year 1685: At which time, the natives appearing peaceably disposed, and behaving in a friendly manner to the English, the above named persons, together with John Wing, George Danson, Peter Goulding, Dickery Sargeant, Isaac Bull and Jacob Leonard, ventured to begin the plantation.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="026481_0025_0FD056250A9E0480"/>The town was incorporated the preceding year October 15, 1684, and the name of Worcester given to it. But the first town meeting ever held in the place, was on the last Wednesday of September, 1722. A special order of the General Court passed directing Judge Fulham of Weston, to call said meeting.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here we must observe, by the way, that the method of the Government was very different in former times, from what it has been since.—In those earlier days, plantations were named, and said to be incorporated, when there were few, or no inhabitants in them; and when a sufficient number of people had settled in them, a special resolve of Court passed to empower them too meet, and choose their town Officers: But for 60 years past, they have been <HI>incorporated, named,</HI> and empowered to hold town meetings, by the same act.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year following several other men, with their families, moved into the place. And the settlement thereof went on prosperously until the year 1701, when the Indians began again to attack the frontier towns in Massachusetts. In the year 1702, the In∣dians killed the wife of Dickery Sargeant, and two of his children, and carried three of his children into captivity.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These children, two sons and a daughter, chose to dwell among the In∣dians. However, in 1726, they accompanied Miss Williams, taken from Deerfield, on a visit to then friends in Newengland.</NOTE> In this town also, Mr. Elisha Ward was supposed to be killed, for he was known to be shot at, and never after seen, or heard of. The war raged with such fury at this time, that Worces∣ter was entirely depopulated. But peace being concluded with the Indians, in the beginning of the year 1713. Some of the proprietors of the township applied to the General Court for encour∣agement and direction towards its resettlement.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="026481_0026_0FD056268A87EC40"/>In consequence of this application the Court ap∣pointed a committee to ascertain the claims of the grantees; and conduct the resettlement of the place. On the 21st of October, 1713, Jonas Rice, with his family, moved into the place and remain∣ed there, without any other inhabitants, until the spring of the Year 1715, when a considerable num∣ber of persons joined him. The number of set∣tlers was augmented by Emigrants from Ireland in 1718: Since which time it has flourished and in∣creased exceedingly, and become large, populous and wealthy. In the year 1740, Holden was set off from Worcester, and became a distinct town; and in 1778, 2200 acres, with the inhabitants thereon, were taken from this town to aid in forming the town of Ward;—Yet still Worcester is large in its dimensions, being about six miles square: And bounded, northerly, on Holden; easterly on Shrewsbury, Boylston and Long Pond; southerly, on Ward and Sutton, and westerly, on Leicester, and Holden. It is become very populous, con∣taining two thousand one hundred inhabitants, according to the census taken in the year 1791: And it will no doubt, still greatly increase for many years. It is also wealthy and opulent, being the third town in the county, in the proportion which it pays in a state tax; and would be the first, most certainly, in the list, did not the other two, Brook∣field, and Sutton, greatly exceed it in extent and dimensions; and also in the number of souls.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, in the outer parts of this town, subsist by husbandry. But in the centre, in the
<PB N="28" REF="026481_0027_0FD05628090B75D0"/>
compass of one mile, and mostly on one street, are collected the county officers, a number of merch∣ants and shop keepers, professional men, and me∣chanicks of various sorts. A very great trade is here carried on, in European and Westindia goods; and the adjacent country is supplied from this town: Here are large apothecary stores, and stores of all kinds of hardware.</P>
<P>A printing press was here set up in 1775, by Mr. Isaiah Thomas, who is thought to do far more business than any other in the state, or in the Unit∣ed States of America.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the time of the political controversy between Great Britain, and these States, previous to the war, near the close of the year 1774, several gentlemen applied in Boston, to Isaiah Thomas, printer of the Massachu∣setts Spy, (a Newspaper famed for its opposition to the British govern∣ment, and which was no small spoke in the wheel of the American Revo∣lution) to set up a printing pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Worcester: He consented, and issued proposals for that purpose and for printing a newspaper weekly, in the town of Worcester: But, soon after, the politicks of that time wearing a more serious aspect, and Mr. Thomas being one of a list of persons, who it was thought, would first feel the weight of British vengence, secretly with∣drew himself, and his printing materials, from Boston. His printing ap∣paratus he sent off for Worcester, about three days before the battle of Lex∣ington, and he himself followed the day after that battle. On the 3d of May, 1775, he, at Worcester, recommenced the publication of the Massachusetts Spy, which was the first printing performed in the county. This newspaper is still printed at Worcester, and is the oldest in the State, the Boston Gazette excepted.</P>
<P>When the war ceased, Mr. Thomas extended his business, and in the year 1788, reestablished a printing office i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Boston, he himself residing in Worcester, where he still carries on the printing business on a very larger scale, as he does also in Boston. Among other large works which have issued from his presses in Worcester, are three editions of the Bible, viz. a large Folio, with 50 copper plates; a large Royal Quarto, with Con∣cordance, &amp;c. and one in Octavo;—they are all the first of the kind ever printed in America:—And, upon examination, his editions are found the most correct of any now extant. He is now preparing to print two other editions of the Bible; viz. a small Quarto; and one in Duodecimo, or the common school Bible: For this last, all the types will be kept standing for the whole work, as is the method in the King's printing houses in England and Scotland. Mr. Thomas has also carried on the Bookbinding business very extensively; and is now engaged in building, in Worcester, as large a Paper Mill as is in this state. His Bookstore in Worcester is kept well filled with a large assortment of Books in all branches of Literature, which is a great accommodation to purchasers, in the town and county. His manu∣factures employ and support a large number of people; and it may justly be said, that the business of no one person, has added more to the conse∣quence and advantage of the town and county of Worcester, than his.</P></NOTE> The houses in the street, are very compact, many of them large and elegant, as also the stores and shops. And here they have a number of large inns, not only for the accommo∣dation of the people of the county, at the times
<PB N="29" REF="026481_0028_0FD056298A59CF90"/>
for holding the courts, but for travellers, and it is a place of great resort. On the street has lately been erected a large and handsome schoolhouse, of about 60, by 30 feet, and two stories high. On the lower floor are two apartments, one designed for a grammar school, and the other for a writing school. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pper story there is one large a∣partment, with a fire place at each end: This is used by the scholars on their exhibition days. On the top there is a cupola with a bell. The street is wide, straight, and very pleasant, and adorned on either side with trees. And upon the whole, this town is one of the most populous, lively, flourish∣ing, agreeable inland places in the state. There are two congregational religious societies in this town, called the first and second parishes. These have no parochial boundaries, but are called poll parishes; each inhabitant having a right by law, to pay and to connect himself to which parish he pleases, only signifying his choice, by leaving his
<PB N="30" REF="026481_0029_0FD0562B08352688"/>
name at any time for that purpose, with the town clerk. They have accordingly two large and ele∣gant meetinghouses, about three quarters of a mile apart; one standing near the south end, and the other the north end of the street, by which the in∣habitants are happily accommodated.</P>
<P>In the year 1719, the first meetinghouse was e∣rected, and here a church was gathered, and the Rev. Andrew Gardner, the first minister was or∣dained in the autumn of that same year 1719, but the month and day cannot be ascertained. He was dismissed from Worcester on the last Wednesday of October 1722, and was afterwards settled at Lunenburgh. Mr. Gardner was succeeded in the sacred office by the Rev. Isaac Burr, who was or∣dained their second pastor, on the 25th of Octo∣ber 1725. He, likewise, after a few years, was dismissed from his work, viz. on November, 1744.</P>
<P>After his removal the Rev. Thaddeus Maccarty, for a short space Minister of Kingston, in the coun∣ty of Plymouth, where he was ordained November 3d, 1742, was installed pastor, the third in succes∣sion, of the church and people of Worcester, on the 10th of June 1747. He continued in office until his death, which was on July 20, 1784.</P>
<P>After the Rev. Mr. Maccarty's death, a second church was formed here on December 1st, 1785, and the Rev. Aaron Bancroft was ordained to the pastoral care thereof, February 1, 1786. This second religious society was incorporated, as a dis∣tinct Parish November 13, 1787.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="026481_0030_0FD0562C886425C8"/>To the Rev. Mr. Maccarty succeeded, as pastor of the first church and society in Worcester, the Rev. Samuel Austin, who was installed here on the 29th of September, 1790. This gentleman had been for a short space, minister of the fourth con∣gregational society in Newhaven, in Connecticut.</P>
<P>In Worcester, a Social Library company has late∣ly been established; their stock already amounts to 90l. and as the institution is founded on a large and liberal plan, it will doubtless be greatly increased.</P>
<P>In this town, a number of gentlemen, requesting the same, received a charter in April, 1793, from the Massachusetts Grand Lodge for holding a LODGE of FREE MASONS, by the name of the MORNING STAR LODGE, and Isaiah Thomas, was unanimously elected Master. And on the 11th of June, the Grand Lodge, of Massachusetts, meet∣ing at Worcester for the purpose, he was installed by the most worshipful Grand Master, John Cut∣ler, and the Lodge consecrated. The stated meet∣ings of the Morning Star Lodge are on the third Tuesday of every month.</P>
<P>We shall now present our readers with a geo∣graphical description of the town of Worcester.</P>
<P>The town is full of round gradual rising hills, and of dales▪ There are few craggy precipices, and few extensive plains. The middle, or most thick settled part, is in a valley, surrounded by pleasant hills, and from the hill as we enter the town from the east, it makes an agreeable appearance. Tat∣nuck and Boggachoag hills are remarkable for hav∣ing formerly had Indian towns on them. They
<PB N="32" REF="026481_0031_0FD0562E082163F0"/>
are neither of them very high. Millstone hill, a∣bout a mile from the courthouse, to the east, is the common property of the inhabitants, who procure from thence stones, some of which they split out, and hew for underpinning to their houses, for door stones and steps. The stones are hard grained, and peculiarly fit for Millstones▪ It must be a singu∣lar advantage to such a town as Worcester, to have such an inexhaustible quarry of building stone, which can be worked into any shape, where there are, and will be so many gentlemen who wish to build with elegance, as well as for convenience.</P>
<P>The natural growth of wood is oak, walnut and chesnut, on the higher lands, some pine on the small plains and valleys, and in the swamps and low lands, ash, birch and maple. The town is well supplied with wood. And as every farmer has his own plat of woodland upon his homestead, so the face of the town appears more woody from the hills, than it is in fact. The interspersion of hills and dales, fields and woods, affords an agreea∣ble and variegated prospect, extending about six or seven miles from the observer's eye. And a more enlarged view is not to be had from the great∣est eminence in the town.—The soil is pretty good, warm, more inclined to sand than clay, however it cannot be called sandy; is is friendly to the growth of Indian corn. Some of the farmers have lately turned their attention to raising wheat and flax, and with considerable success. Rye is raised here in great quantities. The rising grounds are very good for pastures and orchards; and the lower not indif∣ferent
<PB N="33" REF="026481_0032_0FD0562F88CD5B60"/>
for hay. Indeed, there is soil of almost eve∣ry kind in Worcester, and almost on every farm. It is not easy to describe its general properties for it is productive, in a degree, of almost all kinds of country produce, and not noticeable for any par∣ticular one.</P>
<P>How far this town affords mines and minerals, has never yet been fully ascertained. About the year 1754, a broad flat vein, about a foot thick, of lead and silver ore, in the proportion of 2½ penny∣weights of silver to one pound of lead, was discov∣ered, running slauntwise down into a rock. Some persons purchased it, and procured a miner, who followed it a little way into a rock, on a hill; and then advised to meet it by digging away before it. In this undertaking considerable money was ex∣pended, but they never met the vein. After a while, they left off discouraged. However, in digging to meet this vein, they found several pieces of ore, a∣bout the size of a peck, or half bushel.</P>
<P>Worcester has really but one pond within its limits, this is called <HI>North Pond,</HI> and is of an oval form; covering about 30 acres of ground, and is surrounded partly by woods and partly by a swamp and meadow. Though not an agreeable pond, yet it is well supplied with the usual sorts of common pond fish, as pickerel, perch, shiners, breams, eels, and pouts. These fish, however, are not of the best quality, as the water is rather slagnant, and the bottom muddy. As to Quinsigamond, or Long Pond, or what is sometimes called Worcester Pond, the facts are these, that all the water of that pond
<PB N="34" REF="026481_0033_0FD056310B2E9068"/>
which lies within the line of the town of Worcester, does not cover more than one acre of land, being two or three small coves: The rest of the pond lies within the bounds of Shrewsbury, and will be particular∣ly described when we come to speak of that town.</P>
<P>Worcester is very well watered by rivers, brooks and rivulets. Bimilick, or Mill brook has its source in North Pond; and running southerly, it crosses the great road a little north of the Courthouse, and empties into Blackstone river. It is not more than ten feet wide and one foot deep; but a fine stream. Turkeybrook, which is about the same size, origin∣ates in Holden. Tatnuck, or Halfway River, in the southwesterly part of the town, runs also from Holden, empties perhaps ten times as much wa∣ter, and is about two rods wide. This passes on through Sutton, to the southward. Boggachoag river, which runs northwardly, through a corner of Ward, is nearly as large as Halfway River. These three streams unite in French River, so called.</P>
<P>Upon these streams there are, within the town of Worcester, a very large paper mill, four grift mills, four saw mills, two fulling mills, and two trip hammers. The fulling mills are the property of Messrs. Stowell, father and sons, by whom the clothier's business, in all its branches, is carried on to as great perfection as any where in the state. They dye fine scarlet, and deep blue colours, in the best manner.</P>
<P>Besides the above mentioned there are two or three works for the making of Potash, in which Pearlash is also made: Also a distillery for gin.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="026481_0034_0FD05632896FC198"/>There is a Post office in this town; the Postmas∣ter is Isaiah Thomas.</P>
<P>The great post road, from Boston to Springfield is very good in that part of it which goes through Worcester. As this is the shire town, roads from all parts of the county, and in every direction, cen∣tre here. There is now a Post road established, from Worcester to Providence, which passes through Mendon.</P>
<P>Worcester is situated 47 miles from Boston, a little to the south of west.</P>
<P>Having said what may be thought sufficient, in describing the town of Worcester, we cannot take our leave of it, without mentioning with respect, the name of Chandler. The town of Worcester, in particular, and the county of Worcester at large, were originally greatly indebted to the Hon. John Chandler, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Woodstock, the first Judge in the county, and his son, the first Col. John Chand∣ler of Worcester, who, in process of time succeed∣ed his father in all his offices, titles and honours, for their address, activity and enterprise. And their names ought to be held in grateful remembrance.</P>

<HEAD>LANCASTER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is, by several years, the eldest town in the county of Worcester, and, originally, one of the largest, as will appear in the sequel of this history, when we come to mention the several large towns which have been set off from it. So early as in the year 1645, <HI>Sholan,</HI> alias <HI>Shaumauw,</HI> proprietor of <HI>Nashawogg,</HI> and Sachem of the <HI>Nasha∣ways,</HI> who lived at <HI>Waushacum,</HI> (which is in Ster∣ling) informed Mr. Thomas King of Watertown, with whom he traded, and for whom he had a re∣spect, of this tract of land as well accommodated for a plantation, desiring the English would come and set down by him. Accordingly, Mr. King, Mr. John Prescot, Harmon Garret, Thomas Skid∣more, Mr. Day, Mr. Symonds, with others, pro∣cured of said <HI>Sholan,</HI> a deed of Nashawogg, ten miles in lengh, and eight in breadth, under these restrictions, that the English should not molest the Indians in their hunting, fishing, or usual planting places.—And the General Court confirmed the deed. And here we ought to observe, the fidelity of <HI>Sholan</HI> who conveyed this tract of land to the English, that he always behaved in a peaceable, friendly manner towards them. As did also <HI>Mat∣thew,</HI> his nephew, and successor as Sachem; but <HI>Sag∣amore Sam,</HI> nephew to Matthew, and succeeded him, was of a different temper and character; and, join∣ing with Philip in his rebellion, was taken by the English, and executed as a rebel. They of the
<PB N="37" REF="026481_0036_0FD056358819AB60"/>
tribe who survived this war of Philip's divided; one part moving to Albany, and the other to Pen∣nicook, with which tribe they incorporated.</P>
<P>Let us return from this digression. Mr. King sold all his interest in this grant to his associates, who having given lots of land to Richard Linton, Lawrence Waters, and John Ball, sent them up to perform divers things at the common expense of the proprietors: And these were the first inhabi∣tants. For the space of seven years little was done to forward the settlement of the plantation; nev∣ertheless, there being nine families in the place, they petitioned the General Court to be incorpora∣ted as a town, which was granted on the 18th of May, 1653, and the name of Lancaster was given to it.</P>
<P>The town was in peace and prosperity for the space of twenty two years, from its incorporation— and the Indians were very serviceable to the inhab∣itants, by supplying them, on reasonable terms, with such corn and wild meat as they needed.</P>
<P>But on the 24th of June, 1675, Philip, Sachem of Pocanoket, commonly called <HI>King Philip,</HI> re∣belled against the English, and commenced a most bloody and destructive war.—And on the 22d of August following, eight persons, viz. George Ben∣net, William Fagg, Jacob Farrar, Joseph Wheeler, Mordecai MacLoad, with his wife and two of their children, were killed in different parts of the town. The Narraganset Indians, joining Philip in his rebellion, marched into the country, and persuad∣ed the Nipnets and Nashaways to take up arms al∣so against the English.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="026481_0037_0FD056370899A130"/>Philip at the head of about 1500 Indians, marched for Lancaster, in which there were then above fifty families. And on the the 10th of Feb∣ruary, 1676, very early in the morning, assaulted the town in five distinct bodies and places, burn∣ing most of the unfortified houses, and killing sev∣eral persons, viz. Jonas Fairbank, Joshua Fairbank, Richard Wheeler, Ephraim Sawyer, Henry Farrar, and Mr. Ball and wife. However, they destroyed no garrison, but that round the Rev. Mr. Rowland∣son's house; in which there were soldiers and in∣habitants to the amount of forty two.</P>
<P>The enemy soon set fire to the house, which re∣duced the English to the sad necessity of surrender∣ing to the Indians, rather than to perish by the flames. The men, except Ephraim Roper, who made his escape, were immediately slain, or reserv∣ed for torture: Their names were, Mr. Divol, A∣braham Joslin, Daniel Gains, Thomas Rowlandson, William and Josiah Kerley, John MacLoad, John Kettle and his two sons, Josiah Divol, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Two of the women, one the wife of Capt. Ker∣ley, the other the wife of Ephraim Roper, were killed in attempting to escape; the other women, with the children, about twenty in number, were carried into captivity; among whom was the con∣sort of the Rev. Mr. Rowlandson, with three chil∣dren, the youngest of which died on the 18th of the same mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s wounds in the wilderness, at an Indian place called Wenlmesset, or Memi∣nimesset, north of Quaboag, aged about six years and a half. This place, was included in the orig∣inal grant of Lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stown, or Hardwick, but is now
<PB N="39" REF="026481_0038_0FD056388B355E98"/>
within the limits of Newbraintree. In the same place also, the wife of Abraham Joslin, being una∣ble to travel by reason of her pregnancy, the In∣dians first knocked her in the head, with her child about two years old, made a large fire, stripped them naked, and then threw them both thereinto. The other women and children, or the most of them, soon after returned. Mrs. Rowlandson, with her two surviving children, returned in about three months. We must in this place, observe the rea∣son of Mr. Rowlandson's not falling into the hands of the enemy with the garrison, was, that he was then at Boston, soliciting the Governour and Council for more soldiers for the protection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the town; and met the heavy tidings, before related, on his return. Capt. Wadsworth, then at Marlbor∣ough, hearing of the assault of Lancaster, with for∣ty brave men, marched immediately for its relief, and, entering the town undiscovered, sorced the enemy, at that time, to quit it. He quartered his men in various parts of the town, and tarried sev∣eral days, but before his departure, had one of his men, George Harrington, killed by the Indians.</P>
<P>This is that famous Capt. Wadsworth, who af∣terwards with Capt. Brocklebank, and the much greater part of their men, gloriously fell, in the cause of their count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a fight with the enemy at Sudbury▪</P>

day, drew off under a guard of horse and foot. And immediately on this desertion of the place, all the buildings, save two, were reduced to ashes. In this state of desolation, the town continued about four years; during which time the Rev. Mr. Rowlandson preached at Wethersfield in Connecti∣cut, and there he died, before the resettlement of the town. From 1680 to the year 1692, they were not molested in the resettlement of the town. But the French king espousing the cause of James the second in 1688, who had abdicated the British throne, involved the nation in a war with France, and Newengland in a war with the Canadians, both French and Indians: In the calamities of which this town had a large share. For, on the 18th of July 1692, the Indians assaulted the house of Peter Joslin, who was at his labour in the field; and knew nothing thereof, until, entering the house, he found his wife and three children, with a widow Whitcomb, who lived in his family, barbarously butchered with their hatchets, and weltering in their blood. His wife's sister, with another of his children, were carried into captivity—she returned; but that child was murdered in the wilderness.— In 1695, on a Lord's day morning, Mr. Abraham Wheeler, was mortally wounded.—On the 11th of September, 1697, when the inhabitants, not suspi∣cious of any enemy, were gone out to their labour, the Indians came, in several companies, into the town, and were n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> surprising Thomas Sawyer's g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrison, both the gates being left open; but Jabez Fairbank, who was at his own house half a

mile's distance, and, designing to bring his little son from said garrison, mounted his horse, (which came running to him in a fright) and rode, full speed, into the gate, but yet nothing suspicious of an enemy: However, this was a mean of saving the garrison; for the enemy, who were just ready to rush into it, supposing they were discovered, gave over that design, and fired at such as were in the fields.—At this time, the Rev. John Whiting being, on some occasion, at a distance from his garrison, they surprised and killed him—they, in∣deed, offered him quarter; but he chose rather to fight to the last, than resign himself to them whose tender mercies are cruelty. At the same time they killed twenty others, viz. Daniel Hudson and his wife and two of their daughters, Ephraim Roper, and wife and daughter, John Skait and wife, Joseph Rugg and wife and three children, widow Rugg, Jonathan Fairbank, and two of his chil∣dren, and two of the children of Nathaniel Hud∣son: They wounded two, but not mortally; and captivated Jonathan Fairbank's wife, widow Wheeler, Ephraim Roper's son, John Skait's son, Joseph Rugg's son, and Mary Glasier: Five of these returned.</P>
<P>In 1704, a large army of French and Indians came from Canada, with a design to destroy North∣ampton, but, finding they were prepared to receive them, they turned their course towards Lancaster; and on the 31st of July, early in the morning, they fell furiously upon the town; and in their first onset killed Lieut. Nathaniel Wilder, near the
<PB N="42" REF="026481_0041_0FD0563DA234BE90"/>
gate of his own garrison; and on the same day three others, viz. Abraham How, John Spaulding, and Benjamin Hutchins, near the same garrison.</P>
<P>The enemy were uncommonly brave, and there∣fore, though Capt. Tyng, who commanded the soldiers of the garrison, and Capt. How, with a company from Marlborough, who marched imme∣diately to their assistance, together with the in∣habitants of the town, maintained a warm conflict with them, for some time, yet being much inferior in number were obliged to retreat into the garri∣son. Upon this the enemy burned the meeting∣house, and six other buildings, and destroyed much of the live stock of the town. Before night there came such numbers to the relief of the town, that the enemy retreated; and though pursued, were not overtaken.</P>
<P>What number of the enemy were killed at the above time is uncertain; but it was supposed to be considerable:— French officer, of some distinc∣tion, was mortally wounded, which greatly exas∣perated them.</P>
<P>On the 26th of October, the same year, 1704, a party of the enemy having been discovered at Still River, the soldiers and inhabitants belonging to Mr. Gardiner's garrison, with divers others, went in quest of them, and returned in the evening much fatigued with the service of the day—Mr. Gardner, (who had been preaching several years with the people of Lancaster, and was now their Pastor elect) in compassion to the soldiery, took the watch that night upon himself; and coming
<PB N="43" REF="026481_0042_0FD0563E8EF68D18"/>
out of the box, late in the night upon some occa∣sion, was heard by one Samuel Prescott in the house, between sleeping and waking, who, suppos∣ing him an enemy, seized the first gun which came to hand, and shot him through the body in the parade. But the fatal mistake immediately ap∣peared; and he, being carried into the house, for∣gave the person who shot him, and in an hour or two expired, to the great grief, not only of his consort, but of his people, who had an high esteem of him.</P>
<P>On the 15th of October, 1705, Mr. Thomas Sawyer, with his son, Elias Sawyer, and John Big∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w, were captivated at his garrisoned house, about the dawn of day. Mr. Sawyer's youngest son, about fourteen years of age, escaped through a back window of the house.</P>
<P>The Indians treated Mr. Sawyer with much cruelty, but at length they arrived at Montreal. There Mr. Sawyer observed to the French Gov∣ernor, that on the River Chamblee there was a fine seat for mills; and that he would build a saw∣mill for him, provided he would procure a ransom for himself, his son, and Biglow. The Governor readily closed with the proposal, as, at that time, there was no sawmill in all Canada, nor artificer capable of building one. He accordingly applied to the Indians, and obtained the ransom of young Sawyer and Biglow, without the least difficulty; but no sum would purchase Mr. Sawyer's redemp∣tion: Him, (being distinguished for his bravery, which had proved fatal to a number of their breth∣ren)
<PB N="44" REF="026481_0043_0FD0564009FDC510"/>
they were determined to immolate.—The victim was accordingly led forth and actually fastened to the stake, environed with materials, so disposed as to effect a lingering death.—The savages, sur∣rounding the unfortunate prisoner, began to antic∣ipate the horrid pleasure of beholding their cap∣tive writhing in tortures amidst the rising flames, and of rending the air with their dismal yells.—On a sudden a Friar appeared, and, with great solemni∣ty, held forth what he declared to be the key to the gates of Purgatory; and told them unless they im∣mediately released their prisoner, he would instantly unlock those gates, and send them headlong therein∣to. Superstition prevailed, and wrought the deliver∣ance of Mr. Sawyer▪ For they, at once, unbound him, and gave him up to the Governor. In one year he compleated a mill, when he and Biglow were discharged. They detained his son Elias one year longer, to instruct them in the art of sawing and keeping the mill in order; when he was amply re∣warded, and sent home to his friends; where his father and he both lived to a good old age, and were gathered to their graves in peace.</P>
<P>On the 16th of July, 1707, Mr. Jonathan White was killed by the Indians. And on the 18th of August in this same year, 1707, twenty four stout Indians, who, according to their own account, had all been captains, came to Marlborough, and, be∣sides other mischief they did there,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See mention of this same company, in the account of Northborough.</NOTE> captivated Mr. Jonathan Wilder, a native of Lancaster: The next day, they were pursued by about thirty people from

Marlborough and Lancaster, and overtaken in what is now Sterling. The front of our men came upon them before they had the least apprehension of a pur∣suit.—Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir packs were all slung, and, it being a misty day, their cases were on their guns:—And, therefore, had our men all run down upon them, they might probably have destroyed, or taken them all, and saved the life of the captive.—The enemy, at the first appearance of our men, had de∣termined to resign themselves to their mercy—But observing only ten of the thirty, to come towards them, they took courage, unslung their packs, and fought like men, having first dispatched their cap∣tive Mr. Wilder.—In this action the enemy lost nine of their number, and all their packs: And on our part two men, Mr. John Farrar and Mr. Richard Singletary, were killed, and two, Mr. Ephraim Wilder and Mr. Samuel Stevens, were wounded, but not mortally.</P>
<P>On August 5th, 1710, a party of the enemy coming by advantage of the bushes very near to Mr. Nathaniel and Mr. Oliver Wilder, and an Indian servant at their labour in the field, the servant was killed, but the men escaped to the gar∣rison.—And this was the <HI>last mischief</HI> done by the enemy, in Lancaster.—After that period they were a peaceable, prosperous, happy people; they grew and flourished, multiplied and increased, they spread and extended their branches far and wide: So that, with the greatest propriety, the people of this place may adopt the words of the psalmist, in reference to Israel, and say,—"Many a time have
<PB N="46" REF="026481_0045_0FD0564308113B38"/>
they afflicted me from my youth—many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me."—I would here observe, the account given above of the desolations, and ca∣lamities which befel the town of Lancaster, is, <HI>chiefly</HI> in the words of the Rev. Mr. Harrington, in a century sermon he preached there on the 28th of May, 1753.</P>
<P>I will now proceed to give some particular ac∣count of the Ecclesiastical state of this town, from its beginning.—It was incorporated, as we have said, in 1653. The following year, Mr. Joseph Rowlandson preached among the people, and con∣tinued so doing, until April 14th, 1658, when they invited him to settle with them in the work of the ministry; their invitation he accepted, and proba∣bly was ordained the same year, at which time, no doubt the Church of Christ was gathered here: Al∣though of these things we cannot speak with cer∣tainty, since the records of the Church, in Mr. Rowlandson's time, were, in all probability, con∣sumed in his garrison. As the town was wholly broken up and destroyed, as above related, in 1676, so the Rev. Mr. Rowlandson continued with the people from the first but about 22 years, and died before the resettlement of the town.—The place lay in ruins about four years. In 1680, they began to resettle: And divers gentlemen preached with them. In February, 1688, Mr. John Whit∣ing was invited to preach with them on probation; and continued preaching until November, 1690, when he was invited to take the oversight of them
<PB N="47" REF="026481_0046_0FD0564489B225B0"/>
in the Lord; and he, accepting their invitation was, probably, soon after ordained.</P>
<P>But we cannot be certain of the precise day, as no records of the time of his ministry have ever been found.—He continued but a short space, in the sacred office, being cut off, by the enemy, as before mentioned, on the 11th of September, 1697.</P>
<P>In May, 1701, Mr. Andrew Gardner, began to preach at Lancaster, and in September following the people gave him a call to settle with them in the work of the gospel ministry. This invitation he accepted, and his ordination was appointed; but before the day came a sudden and surprising death arrested him: Being unfortunately, but mor∣tally wounded in the house of his friends, in his own garrison, in the night following the 26th of October, 1704; the particulars of which have been related above.</P>
<P>In May, 1705, Mr. John Prentice came to preach among this people, and supplied the desk until February, 1707, when he received an invitation to settle among them, which he accepted; and he was accordingly, solemnly separated unto this sa∣cred employment on the 29th of March, 1708. In his day there was peace, and the town grew and flourished exceedingly: For during his ministry, from his diocese were formed the towns of Harv∣ard, Bolton, Leominster, and the second precinct, which is now called Sterling. He was a good and faithful servant of Jesus Christ, continuing in his office almost forty years, living much beloved; and died greatly lamented, on the 6th of January. 1748.
<PB N="48" REF="026481_0047_0FD0564609F7D970"/>
The breach made upon the Church and town was happily repaired the ensuing fall, in the installment of the Rev. Timothy Harrington, to the pastoral of∣fice among them, November 16th, 1748; who still continues, in an advanced age.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Harrington, through age and bod∣ily infirmities, being taken off from his publick la∣bours, the people of Lancaster have invited Mr. Nathaniel Thayer, to settle with them in the work of the gospel ministry, as colleague with the vener∣able Mr. Harrington, who, having accepted their invitation, is, by the leave of Providence, to be sol∣emnly separated unto the same October 9th, 1793.</P>
<P>We must here observe, that although this place was greatly frowned upon, in their early days, in the short lives, and premature deaths of their first ministers, yet since that time, the people have been as signally smiled upon, and bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the long and useful lives of two eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters in succession, whose courses together ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p the long space of 84 years.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Harrington, was first settled in the ministry at a place then called, <HI>Lower Ashuelot, now Swanzey,</HI> in the state of Newhampshire: Here he was ordained November 16th, 1741. This place was totally destroyed by the Indians on the 2d of April, 1747, from whence he was driven with his family and flock. The people of Lancas∣ter having invited Mr. Harrington to settle with them, and there being no prospect of the return of his former Church and flock to Ashuelot, he first obtained a regular dismission from them, and there∣upon
<PB N="49" REF="026481_0048_0FD0564789FA88F0"/>
upon generously resigned to them his whole inter∣est there, and all arrearages due to him, and accept∣ed the invitation to take the oversight of the Church and flock of God in Lancaster.</P>
<P>Let us return; the town of Lancaster <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the appearances of age. A number of gentlemen have built very elegant seats here: And there are a considerable number of stores and shops in the town. And as there are large roads, and much travel through the place, of course much business is done here in the way of trade. The pleasant∣ness of the place has invited many persons of edu∣cation and fortune hither. And here they have a large social library, under good regulations and con∣sisting of a fine collection of good and useful books.</P>
<P>In this town there is established a Lodge of Free Masons, the history whereof is as follows. Upon the petition of a number of gentlemen to the ancient Grand Lodge of free and accepted Ma∣sons, a charter was granted January 31, 1778, to the petitioners, and their successors, for holding a Lodge in Lancaster, by the name of <HI>Trinity Lodge.</HI> This is held on the first Tuesday evenings in each month. From the date of the charter to this time, there have been initiated 166 persons, from this and other towns in the vicinity: Of these 135 have received the degree of Fellow Crafts; and 125 have been raised to Master Masons. From its commencement the Lodge has been governed by the following masters, viz.</P>

<P>We proceed to a Geographical, and Topo∣graphical description of Lancaster. It is about nine miles in length from north to south, and four in width from east to west: Bounded by Lunenburgh and Leominster on the north and north west; by Shirley in the county of Middlesex, on the north∣east; by Harvard, Bolton and Berlin, on the east; by Boylston on the south, and by Sterling on the west. The body of the town is situated on low and level lands near the intervals; and so as to afford an agreeable prospect of a considerable part of it. There are two main branches of the River Nashaway. The north branch originates from a Pond in Westminster, and, running through Fitch∣burgh and Leominster, enters Lancaster in the North west part of the town; and pursues a southeast course into the middle of it, within a few rods of the meetinghouse. The south branch springs up from the foot of Watchusett, in Princeton, and running through Sterling and Boylston, enters at the south∣west angle of the town; then running northeaster∣ly, meets the north branch about half a mile below the meetinghouse; and then, keeping a northeas∣tern course, enters Shirley. On both branches and
<PB N="51" REF="026481_0050_0FD0564B4A5994F8"/>
within the town of Lancaster they have corn and saw mills. There are nine large bridges within the town: Two on the north branch, three on the south, and four after their junction. None are less than five rods in length; and the first af∣ter the confluence of these waters is planked ten rods. On the two branches, and after they unite, there is a vast body of exceeding rich <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terval land, of a great depth of soil, and which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most excel∣lent for grass, and produces in abundance the best of hay. This interval is also good for raising flax and hemp: It is also good for Indian corn; and a steam of fog from the waters preserves the corn in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he intervals, when at the distance of ten or fifteen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ods, the corn will be destroyed by frosts. The river Nashaway overflows the whole interval, of nearly 3000 acres, twice in a year, in the spring, and in autumn and in some places two miles in width. Sometimes it has overflowed the interval lands in summer; and then it has generally done vast damage, by carrying off fences, great quanti∣ties of hay and flax, &amp;c. and destroyed large fields of Indian corn. In 1787, by a freshet, a saw mill, on the north branch, about two miles from the meetinghouse, was swept off, and about three acres of good rich interval land washed away to the depth of 12 feet, leaving only a bed of cobble stones, en∣tirely useless. The lands rising from the interval are, mostly, plain and level, on which the build∣ings, in the middle of the town, stand; and these lands are good for all kinds of grain: Wheat and hemp are raised upon them in great plenty.

<P>The growth of wood, on the higher lands is oak of the various sorts, chesnut and walnut. The intervals abound with elm, buttonwood, but∣ternut, and shagbark.

from this, and about five miles from the meeting∣house, is situated Turner Pond; there is a small outlet from hence to Spectacle Pond, in form of a bow, whence they take the name, Spectacle Pond. Near these is another, called <HI>Fort Pond,</HI> whence is∣sues a stream on which there are mills in Shirley. From Spectacle Pond a stream runs sufficient to carry a saw mill, and a fulling mill, and then falls into the north branch of Nashaway River.

<P>We have now to observe, that the town of Lan∣caster is at great expense in building and repairing bridges and causeways: And the General Court, in consideration hereof, granted a Lottery, a few years past, whereby they might raise a certain sum of money for these purposes. Nevertheless, al∣though their rivers occasion the people much cost, and sometimes great loss and damage by the freshets, yet the bounteous Author of Nature, seemed to consider these things, and made them great, if not full compensation, by some singular natural advantages in the town; and in particu∣lar,
<PB N="54" REF="026481_0053_0FD0564FCAB4D070"/>
by the richness and fertility of their large in∣tervals; and the ease with which their lands are cultivated, and made productive. And upon the whole, notwithstanding it has been curtailed on every side, this is still a very large and wealthy town; peaceable and happy; prosperous and flourishing; and the people are industrious and good.</P>
<P>In this town when the general census was taken, in the year 1791, there were 214 houses, and 1460 inhabitants. The town is just about 40 miles from Boston, very little to the north of west, and 14 miles from the Courthouse in Worcester a lit∣tle to the northeast.</P>

<HEAD>MENDON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a very ancient town indeed, the second in age in the county. It was an orig∣inal grant to certain persons, of eight miles square, made by the General Court, at an early period, we cannot say exactly when; it was called Quanshi∣pauge by the natives. It was incorporated by an Act of the Legislature, on the 15th of May, 1667, and the name of Mendon given to it. It was lo∣cated, a plan drawn, and return made to the General Court, by a Mr. Joshua Fisher. After the Province line was settled, it was again sur∣veyed, and a plan of it drawn by a Mr. William
<PB N="55" REF="026481_0054_0FD05651484FEE00"/>
Rider, in the year 1725; according to which plan its boundaries and extent were as follow, begin∣ning at southwest corner it ran east seven and an half miles on the line between Massachusetts and Rhodeisland; then north four miles and 40 rods; then east, one mile by a river; then north again, three miles and 280 rods; then west, eight and an half miles; then south eight miles, to the first bounds. But this measure must be very large, since all Uxbridge, almost the whole of North∣bridge, and a large part of Upton were taken from Mendon, together with Milford; and still there re∣main two parishes in the town. Its present bounda∣ries by actual survey, are south, by Rhodeisland State, six miles and a quarter; on the west, by Uxbridge and Northbridge, seven miles and 140 rods to Up∣ton line; northwest, by Upton, two miles; northeast, by Milford, four miles and a quarter; east, by Bel∣lingham in the county of Suffolk, four miles and three quarters. When they held their first town meeting, or first acted as a corporate body, does not appear, nor when the Church was gathered and the first minister was settled. Here, as in some other instances we may meet with, we have to lament the entire want of ancient records. If ever any records were kept in those early days, of these matters, they were lost when the town was broken up in the time of the Indian wars, or in some other way. We have also to regret the ob∣scurity and defects attending such records as are to be found.</P>
<P>In little more than eight years from the incor∣poration of Mendon, commenced the Narraganset,
<PB N="56" REF="026481_0055_0FD05652C92D2EA0"/>
or King Philip's war. And all that I can find in "Hubbard's history of the Indian wars," or in "Governor Hutchinson's history of Massachusetts," or by any other way, is this, viz. "On the 14th of July, 1675, the Nipnet or Nipmuck Indians, killed four or five people at Mendon." And this was the first mischief ever done by the Indians with∣in the ancient limits of the Massachusetts. For it must be remembered, that the colony of Plymouth was not annexed to Massachusetts until the charter from William and Mary in 1691. I cannot find that ever any other mischief was done by the In∣dians in Mendon, except the abovementioned. However the people then here were in such fear and danger, as that the town was entirely broken up for some time, and most or all of them moved off. How long the place remained desolate, we are un∣able to say with certainty. It could not be long, as will appear by the following account of the ec∣clesiastical state of Mendon.</P>
<P>All we can find on record is simply this—"The Rev. Joseph Emerson was the first Pastor of the Church in Mendon. He lived here before the war, known by the stile of King Philip's Indian war." I add, in this war the town and church were broken up, and Mr. Emerson never returned to officiate with them in the pastoral office. Tra∣dition says, he was minister here about eight years, this will carry back the date of his ordination, and the gathering of the Church, to the year 1667, that is, to about the time when the town was incorporat∣ed.—The records go on to say—</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="026481_0056_0FD056544C8F1A68"/>"The Rev. Grindall Rawson was the second Pastor of the Church in this town. He was or∣dained in the 20th year of his age. He died Feb∣ruary the 6th, 1715, in the 57th year of his age, and 37th of his ministry." But here we must ob∣serve, his tombstone says, "he died in the 35th year of his ministry:" And this is the more proba∣ble for several reasons. According to the town record, he must have been settled in the year 1678, which is carrying it back too near the time when the town was broken up: And considering the then state of the country, in constant fear, and great danger from the Indians, it is not at all likely they should resettle so soon; but in the year 1680 they probably might.</P>
<P>The records further say, "The Rev. Joseph Dorr was the third Pastor of this Church. He died March 9th, 1768, in the 79th year of his age, and the 52d year of his ministry." This will carry back the time of the Rev. Mr. Dorr's ordination to the year, 1716. The Rev. Joseph Willard succeeded Mr. Dorr in the work of the gospel ministry in Mendon, whereunto he was solemnly consecrated on the 19th of April, 1769. He was dismissed from his pastoral relation to this Church and people, on the 4th of December, 1782, in the 13th year of his ministry. This dismission of Mr. Willard was occasioned by the coldness and inattention of the people. The Rev. Mr. Willard was installed Pastor of the Church and flock of God in Boxborough, in the county of Middlesex, on the 2d of November, 1785, where he lives in
<PB N="58" REF="026481_0057_0FD05655C8E0ACB0"/>
peace and harmony with his people. The Rev. Caleb Alexander succeeded Mr. Willard as Pastor of the first Church and congregation in Mendon, (the fifth in succession) where he was installed the 12th of April, 1786, in the 31st year of his age, and where he continues in his sacred employment. This gentleman had been previously settled at New∣marlborough in the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nty of Berkshire for a short space.</P>
<P>There is a second parish in this town, which was incorporated as a distinct precinct for ministerial purposes, by the appellation of "The south parish in Mendon," in the year 1766. In this same year the congr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gational inhabitants of this parish began to build them a meetinghouse for the publick worship of God, and accomplished the work in a short time. And in the year 1768, the Church of Christ, in this south parish was imbodi∣ed, and the Rev. Benjamin Balch was ordained their Pastor. And on Saturday morning March 27th, 1772, before daylight, Mr. Balch left the parish, without knowledge or consent of the people of his charge. Mr. Balch was, a few years since, installed at Barrington in Newhampshire. About one half of the people of this south parish have been Anabaptists and Quakers, ever since that part of the town was first settled, which was about 90 years ago. And from the time when Mr. Balch left this parish, the congregational interest therein has been in a declining state. They seldom have any preaching; nor is there any present prospect of
<PB N="59" REF="026481_0058_0FD05657492A34E8"/>
their ever having another minister settled among them.</P>
<P>As to the religious state of both parishes in Men∣don, let it suffice to say, there are, in general, three denominations, Congregationalists, Anabaptists, and Friends. There is another class without a name. A small society of Friends are very punc∣tual in attending their form of worship; and they have a very decent meetinghouse for the purpose. Some who are, politically, Friends, do not interest themselves much in any form. There is not in the town any incorporated society of Anabaptists. They who are of this persuasion, go sometimes on the sabbath to other towns, to attend publick wor∣ship, in their way.</P>
<P>Having said what will be thought sufficient, re∣specting the religious state and ecclesiastical polity of Mendon, some Geographical Description of the town shall now be presented to the reader.</P>
<P>The land, in general, is good, though there is some which is rough and hard: The soil is rich and very productive. It is mostly high, hilly land, yet not very uneven: And there is a sufficiency of stones to fence their farms. The old parish abounds principally in mowing and pasture land. The south parish is better adapted to grain. The town is excellent for orcharding, and all kinds of fruit trees. There are three high hills in this place, from either of which the four Newengland States, may be seen, in a fair day. They are known by the following names, <HI>Caleb</HI>'s <HI>Hill,</HI> this is near the centre of the town; <HI>Wigwam Hill,</HI> is situated a lit∣tle
<PB N="60" REF="026481_0059_0FD05658C94C10E0"/>
to the south west, from Caleb's Hill; and <HI>Mis∣kee</HI> or Misqueo Hill, this lies in the northwest corner of the town, and part of it falls within the limits of Upton.</P>
<P>The groves of wood here are, in general, very thrifty and tall, consisting for the most part of walnut and oak. There are fine forests of most excellent chesnut, suitable for buildings or for fences.</P>
<P>The town of Mendon, like almost all other high, hilly, rocky places, is moist, rich, strong land, well watered with numerous springs and rivulets: But there are no streams of note, except two: The first is Charles River, which touches on the eastern part of this town. This River takes its rise from a marshy place in the southwest part of Hopkin∣ton, in the county of Middlesex, and runs south, through Milford in this county, and the easterly part of Mendon, and then passes on to Belling∣ham, in the county of Suffolk. The second is Mill River, which also originates in the southwest∣ern part of Hopkinton, and, running through the western part of Milford, passes through the easter∣ly side of Mendon, and crossing the road to Provi∣dence, joins Blackstone River, near Winsooket Falls, in the town of Cumberland, in the State of Rhodeisland. There is but one Pond in this town, situated in the western part of it, and called <HI>Taft</HI>'s <HI>Pond</HI>; it is large, and affords great plenty of the usual sorts of hook fish. There is no visible stream which runs into this pond; but a stream issues from it sufficient to carry a grist mill. On
<PB N="61" REF="026481_0060_0FD0565A4A573398"/>
these rivers and streams, within the town, there are five grist mills, two saw mills, two clothiers' works, and one forge. There is some good inter∣val lands upon these streams, and some bodies of excellent meadows, and industry might make more.</P>
<P>The people subsist chiefly by farming; they have indeed the common mechanicks, and one or two dealers in European, East and Westindia goods: And here they have both pot and pearl ash works.</P>
<P>The place derives great benefit from the pub∣lick roads which pass through it in various direc∣tions. The road from the northerly part of Con∣necticut, passes through Mendon to Boston. The post road from Worcester to Providence also goes through this town; as also a road, of much travel, from Vermont and Newhampshire, and the north part of the county of Worcester into the State of Rhodeisland. Mendon is situated quite at the southeast angle of the county; and is 37 miles from Boston, to the southwest, and 18 miles from the Courthouse in Worcester. When the late enu∣meration was made there were 222 dwelling houses, and 1555 inhabitants, in the place. It has stood as the twelfth among the towns, in the proportion it pays to a state tax.</P>

<HEAD>BROOKFIELD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the third town in age, and the first as to its wealth and number, in the coun∣ty, containing, when the census was taken, 438 dwelling houses, and 3100 inhabitants. A num∣ber of inhabitants of Ipswich, in the county of Es∣sex, petitioned the General Court for a tract of land, and obtained their request, in the words following, "At a great and general Court of election held at Boston the 20th of May, 1660. In answer to a petition of several inhabitants of Ipswich, this court judgeth it meet to grant the petitioners six miles square, or so much land as shall be contained in such a compass, in a place near Quaboag pond." The grantees, that they might have a just and equitable, as well as a legal, right to the land, pur∣chased it of the natives, who claimed and possessed it, and it was conveyed to them by deed. Not∣withstanding the great disadvantages under which they then laboured, in the infancy of our country, in the midst of the Indian enemy, and no English settlements nearer than Marlborough on the east, and Springfield on the west, the inhabitants so in∣creased and flourished, as that upon application to the General Court, they were incorporated into a township, by the name of Brookfield, by an act which bears date, October 15th, 1673. But the court appointed and continued a committee of three gentlemen, belonging to other places, to di∣rect,
<PB N="63" REF="026481_0062_0FD0565D4A9EAC78"/>
regulate and ratify all affairs relative to settling and building up the town. A committee, appoint∣ed as aforesaid, petitioned the General Court to be released from such services, and prayed that the in∣habitants might be left to conduct and manage their own affairs, which was granted November 12th▪ 1718. The inhabitants, not satisfied with their first grant, petitioned the Court for more land, when an act passed December 3, 1719, making the town eight miles square.</P>
<P>In the year 1675, not two years after its incor∣poration, Brookfield was utterly destroyed by the Indians, when the inhabitants consisted of about twenty families; they had then a house for pub∣lick worship, and preaching, but no settled minis∣ter. The circumstances of its desolation are of im∣portance to be transmitted to posterity, and I shall relate them, as I have collected and laid them to∣gether from the late Governor Hutchinson's history of Massachusetts, the Rev. Mr. Hubbard's history of the Indian war, and Capt. Thomas Wheeler's narrative thereof. "The Nipnet or Nipmuck <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"These were seated upon less rivers and lakes, or large ponds, where Oxford now is, and towns near it." Hutchinson's history.</NOTE> Indians, having on the 14th of July, 1675, killed four or five people at Mendon, the governor and council, in hopes of reclaiming them, sent Capt. Edward Hutchinson, of Boston, to Quaboag, Brookfield, near which place there was to be a great rendezvous of those Indians, to treat with several Sachems, in order to the publick peace: and ordered Capt. Thomas Wheeler, of Concord, with a part of his troop, about 20 men, to accom∣pany
<PB N="64" REF="026481_0063_0FD0565EC9CC3D60"/>
him for security and assistance. They ar∣rived on the Lord's day, August the 1st, and sent a message to the Indians, desiring to treat with them. Three of the chief Sachems promised to meet them next morning about eight o'clock, August 2d, upon a plain at the head of Wickaboug Pond, two or three miles west of the meetinghouse. Captains Hutch∣inson and Wheeler, with their company, and three of the principal inhabitants of Brookfield, Capt. John Ayres, John Coye, and Joseph Pritchard, re∣sorted thither at the appointed time, but found not the Indians there. They then rode forward about four or five miles towards the Nipnet's chief town. When they came to a place called Mominimisset, a narrow passage, between a steep hill and a thick swamp, they were ambushed by two or three hundred Indians, who shot down eight of the company, viz. Zechariah Phillips of Boston, Timothy Farley of Billerica, Edward Colburn of Chelmsford, Samuel Smedley of Concord, Syd∣rach Hapgood of Sudbury, and Capt. Ayres, John Coye and Joseph Pritchard of Brookfield, named above, and mortally wounded Capt. Hutchinson. The rest escaped, through a bye path, to Brook∣field. The Indians flocked into the town; but the inhabitants, being alarmed, had all got together in the principal house, on an eminence, a little to the southeast of where the west parish meetinghouse now stands. They had the mortification to see all their dwelling houses, about 20, with all their barns and outhouses burnt. The house where they had assembled, was then surrounded, and a variety of
<PB N="65" REF="026481_0064_0FD05660481922A8"/>
attempts were made for two days and nights to set fire to it, but did not succeed. At length, Au∣gust 4th, at evening, the Indians filled a cart with hemp, and other combustible matter, which they kindled, and endeavoured to thrust to the house in order to fire it; but this attempt was defeated, partly by a shower of rain which fell and wet the materials, as Capt. Wheeler says in his narrative, who was on the spot, and partly by aid arriving: For Major Willard, who had been sent after some other Indians westward of Lancaster and Groton, hearing of the distress of Brookfield, when he was about four or five miles from Lancaster, altered his course, and the same night reached Brookfield, with Capt. Parker, and 46 men about an hour after it was dark, after a tedious march of 30 miles. And though the Indian scouts discov∣ered him and fired their alarm guns, yet the main body, from their high joy, always accompanied with a horrid noise, heard them not. Willard joined the besieged, and the Indians immediately poured in all the shot they could, but without ex∣ecution, and then burning all the buildings, ex∣cept this garrison, and destroying all the horses and cattle they could find, withdrew to their dens. They were not pursued being much superiour in number.</P>
<P>It is fitting to add to the above, the very partic∣ular account, which the Rev. Dr. Fiske of Brook∣field, has given in a marginal note, annexed to an historical discourse concerning the settlement of this town, and its distresses during the Indian wars,
<PB N="66" REF="026481_0065_0FD05661CEACAB08"/>
preached December 31st, 1775, and immediately published. The account is as follows, viz. "That three of the men killed in the ambushment, belong∣ed to Brookfield, as above named: That when the Indians pursued the party into the town, they set fire to all the buildings except a few in the neigh∣bourhood of the house in which the inhabitants had taken shelter: That they endeavoured to inter∣cept five or six men who had gone to a neighbour∣ing house to secure some things there: But they all got safe to the place of refuge, except a young man, Samuel Pritchard, who was stopped short by a fatal bullet: That the house in which they were besieged was unfortified, except by a few logs hasti∣ly tumbled up on the outside, after the alarm, and by a few feather beds hung up on the inside. And though the siege continued from Monday in the afternoon, until early on Thursday morning, Au∣gust 5th, in which time innumerable balls entered the house, only one man, Henry Young, who was in the chamber, was killed. The Indians shot ma∣ny fire arrows to burn the house, but without ef∣fect.—When the troop which relieved Brookfield, got into the town, which was late at night, they were joined by great numbers of cattle, which had collected together in their fright at the conflagra∣tion of the buildings, and the firing and war whoops of the Indians: and for protection these poor ani∣mals followed the troop till they arrived at the be∣sieged house. The Indians deceived hereby, and thinking there was a much larger number of horse∣men than there really was, immediately set fire to
<PB N="67" REF="026481_0066_0FD0566350716960"/>
the barn belonging to the besieged house, and to Joseph Pritchard's house and barn, and the meet∣inghouse, which were the only buildings left un∣burnt, and went off. A garrison was maintained at this house till winter, when the court ordered the people away, soon after which the Indians came and burnt this house also."</P>
<P>Having mentioned Major Willard, Capt. Hutch∣inson and Capt. Wheeler, it will be proper to say something further respecting each of them.—Cap∣tains Hutchinson and Wheeler, tarried at Brook∣field until August 13th, and then, with most of their men, set off for their homes; they arrived at Marlborough the next day, where Capt. Hutch∣inson, fatigued with his journey and his wound growing worse, died August 19th, and was there buried the next day, August 20th, 1675.</P>
<P>Captain Wheeler, who accompanied Capt. Hutchinson, and saw him buried, the next day, August 21st, arrived safe at Concord, where he and they who returned with him, kept October 21st, 1675, as a day of praise and thanksgiving to God for their remarkable deliverance and safe return, when the Rev. Mr. Bulkley of Concord preached a sermon to them from those words in Psalm cxvi.12, ¿ "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?" which was printed.</P>
<P>Major Willard tarried at Brookfield, and at Hadley and the adjacent towns, for several weeks, and then returned to Groton, where the safety of that and some neighbouring towns required his presence. He was soon after displaced for going
<PB N="68" REF="026481_0067_0FD05664C9EB3AF8"/>
to Brookfield without orders, or while under orders to march another way. The Rev. Dr. Fiske's ob∣servations hereupon in a note, are well worthy in∣sertion in this place. "Major Willard's conduct in altering his course and coming to the relief of Brookfield, being dictated by humanity and exe∣cuted with bravery and success, has gained him the applause of people in general. But as it was beside his orders, he was censured by the court and cashier∣ed, which disgusted his friends, and broke his heart. And though the punishment may seem too rigor∣ous, yet it is to be remembered, that if commanders of parties, sent upon particular expeditions, may take liberty to vary from their express orders, nothing ef∣fectual could be accomplished, and only confusion, disappointment, loss, and in many cases ruin, would be likely to ensue."</P>
<P>To return to Brookfield. The town, totally de∣stroyed by the Indians in August 1675, lay in ru∣ins several years, and the inhabitants were dispers∣ed. "But, says the Rev. Dr. Fiske, in the sermon above referred to, peace being settled with the Indians, some of the dispersed, after a while, re∣turned to the place of their former habitation, and in conjunction with others, gradually re∣settled the town, so that in the year 1692, they had a committee appointed by the court, as formerly, to direct and regulate the settlement of said plantation and the affairs thereof. But it be∣ing still in the midst of a wilderness, and always exposed to the blood thirsty savages, whenever they
<PB N="69" REF="026481_0068_0FD056664C2F9930"/>
should take it into their heads to molest the En∣glish, its increase and improvements were slow."</P>
<P>In the war which is commonly denominated Queen Anne's war, which broke out not long after the resettlement of the town, and continued several years, Brookfield, as well as many other towns, was greatly harassed and annoyed; the Indians frequently making sudden inroads, killing and scalping, or captivating one and another of the in∣habitants. During this war, a number of men, women and children were killed, several taken prisoners, and some were wounded. The particu∣lars are as follow, as related by the Rev. Dr. Fiske, in the sermon above referred to. "The first mis∣chief was in the latter end of July or beginning of August 1692. A party of Indians came into the town and broke up two or three families. Joseph Woolcot being at work at a little distance from his house, his wife, being fearful, took her children and went out to him. When they returned to the house at noon, they found the Indians had been there, for his gun and several other things were missing. And looking out at a window he saw an Indian, at some distance, coming towards the house. He immediately sent out his wife and his two little daughters to hide themselves in the bush∣es; and he taking his little son under his arm and his broad ax in his hand, went out with his dog in sight of the Indian. The dog being large and fierce, attacked the Indian so furiously, that he was obliged to discharge his gun at the dog to rid him∣self of him; immediately upon which Woolcot
<PB N="70" REF="026481_0069_0FD05667C9DE17B0"/>
sat down the child and pursued the Indian till he heard the bullet roll down his gun, the Indian charging as he ran; he then turned back, snatched up his child and made his escape, through the swamps, to a fort. His wife being greatly terrified, discovered by her shrieks where she was; and the Indian soon found and dispatched both her and her children. Others of the party about the same time, came into the house of one Mason while the family were at dinner. They killed Mason and one or two children, and took his wife and an infant which they had wounded, and carried them off. They also took two brothers, Thomas and Daniel Law∣rence; they soon dispatched Thomas, pretending he had misinformed them about the number of men which were in the town. John Lawrence, their brother, rode with all haste to Springfield for assist∣ance. A company, under Capt. Colton, came with the greatest speed and pursued the Indians. They found Mrs. Mason's child, which the savages had knocked on the head and thrown away in the bushes; and continuing their pursuit, they came upon the Indians' encampment, which was a sort of brush hedge, which they deridingly called "En∣glishmen's fort." The party waited till break of day, and then came so near as to put their guns through this brush and fire upon the Indians, four∣teen or fifteen of whom were killed, the rest fled with such precipitation as to leave several of their arms, blankets, powderhorns, &amp;c. and their prison∣ers, Daniel Lawrence and Mrs. Mason, whom our men conducted back. This same John Lawrence,
<PB N="71" REF="026481_0070_0FD05669491539D0"/>
who rode express and procured the company which rescued the abovementioned prisoners, was after∣wards going in company with one Samuel Owen, in search of a man who was missing; the Indians came upon them, killed Lawrence, but Owen es∣caped. Mary MacIntosh was fired upon and kill∣ed as she was milking her cows. Robert Grain∣ger and John Clary were passing along the road, on a certain day, and being fired upon by the sav∣ages, Grainger was killed on the spot; Clary at∣tempted to escape, but had not fled far before he also was shot down. At another time, Thomas Battis of Brookfield, riding express to Hadley, was killed in the wilderness, in a place now called Belchertown. Early one morning John Woolcot, a lad about twelve or fourteen years old, was rid∣ing in search of the cows, when the Indians fired at him, killed his horse from under him and took him prisoner. The people at Jennings's garrison hearing the firing, and concluding the people at another garrison were beset, six men set out for their assistance, but were waylayed by the Indians. The English saw not their danger, till they saw there was no escaping it. And therefore, knowing that an Indian could not look an Englishman in the face, and take a right aim, they stood their ground, presenting their pieces wherever they saw an Indian, without discharging them, excepting Abijah Bartlet, who turned to flee and was shot dead. The Indians kept firing at the rest and wounded three of them, Joseph Jennings in two places; one ball grazed the top of his head, by
<PB N="72" REF="026481_0071_0FD0566B4EFDF788"/>
which he was struck blind for a moment; another ball passed through his shoulder, wounding his collar bone, yet by neither did he fall, nor was he mortally wounded. Benjamin Jennings was wounded in the leg, and John Green in the wrist. They were preserved at last by the following strat∣agem. A large dog, hearing the firing, came to our men; one of whom, to encourage his breth∣ren and intimidate the Indians, called out, "Capt. Williams is come to our assistance, for here is his dog." The Indians, seeing the dog, and knowing Williams to be a famous warrior, immediately fled, and our men escaped. John Woolcot the lad a∣bovementioned, was carried to Canada, where he remained six or seven years, during which time, by conversing wholly with Indians, he not only lost his native language, but became so naturalized to the savages, as to be unwilling, for a while, to re∣turn to his native country. Some years afterwards, viz. in March, 1728, in a time of peace, he and an∣other man having been hunting, and coming down Connecticut River with a freight of skins and fur, they were hailed by some Indians; but not being willing to go to them, they steered for another shore. The Indians landed at a little distance from them; several shots were exchanged, at length Woolcot was killed.</P>
<P>The last mischief which was done by the savages, in Brookfield, was about the 20th of July, 1710. Six men, viz. Ebenezer Hayward, John White, Stephen and Benjamin Jennings, John Grosvenor and Joseph Kellog, were making hay in the mea∣dows,
<PB N="73" REF="026481_0072_0FD0566C4892E2A0"/>
when the Indians, who had been watching an opportunity to surprise them, sprung suddenly upon them, dispatched five of them, and took the other, John White, prisoner. White spying a small company of our people at some distance, jumped from the Indian who held him, and ran to join his friends; but the Indian fired after him, and wounded him in the thigh, by which he fell; but soon recovering and running again, he was a∣gain fired at and received his death wound."</P>
<P>Great indeed were the difficulties, discourage∣ments and hardships, under which this then infant plantation laboured, so that it was more than forty years from the breaking up of the town, and burn∣ing the first meetinghouse, before they erected an∣other. A church was gathered, and the Rev. Thomas Cheney was ordained their first Pastor, the third Wednesday of October, 1717. He con∣tinued their minister a little more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han 30 years, as he died December 11th, 1747, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged 57 years. To him succeeded, in the work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the ministry, the Rev. Elisha Harding, who w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> solemnly sepa∣rated hereunto September 13th, 1749. So rapidly did the town increase and flourish, after the settle∣ment of their first minister, that on March 29th, 1750, a second parish was incorporated in the northerly p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of the town. Here a church was gathered May 28th, 1752, and the Rev. Eli Forbes was ordained their first minister on the third of June the same year. Mr. Harding continued the minister of the first precinct until the people fell into a most unhappy controversy about erecting a
<PB N="74" REF="026481_0073_0FD0566DCA760E08"/>
new meetinghouse. The contention was so sharp, and the opposite parties so uncomplying that they parted, and formed two distinct religious societies. The act for dividing the first parish, and incorporat∣ing the third precinct passed November 8th, 1754. In consequence hereof, Mr. Harding requested a dis∣mission, which was granted by the church and con∣firmed by a mutual ecclesiastical council, May 8th, 1755. After his dismission the Rev. Joseph Parsons was ordained Pastor of the first church and pre∣cinct, on the 23d of November, 1757. A church was gathered in the third parish, or east precinct, April 15th, 1756, and on the 24th of May, 1758, the Rev. Nathan Fiske, D. D. was ordained their spiritual overseer, and still continues. Mr. Parsons continued Pastor of the first church upwards of thirteen years, being released from the sickness and pains of this mortal state January 17th, 1771, in the fourteenth year of his ministry, and 38th of his age. In about nine months after his decease, viz. on October 23d, 1771, the Rev. Ephraim Ward was separated to the pastoral office, the fourth in succession in the first church and precinct.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Forbes continued in the faithful discharge of the ministerial work among the peo∣ple of the second precinct almost 23 years; and on the 1st of March, 1775, the pastoral relation was dissolved by mutual consent, under the conduct of an ecclesiastical council, each party in charity with, and heartily recommending the other. To him succeeded, as second Pastor of the second precinct, the Rev. Joseph Appleton, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho was sol∣emnly
<PB N="75" REF="026481_0074_0FD0566F483EB7C0"/>
separated to the work of the gospel ministry, October 30th, 1776.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Forbes was, June 5th, 1776, install∣ed Pastor of the first church in Gloucester, Cape Anne, where he continues, faithfully serving God in the gospel of his Son. It is fitting farther to observe, that Mr. Forbes, while minister in Brook∣field, went repeatedly Chaplain to provincial regi∣ments, in the last French war, to the westward, which qualified him the better to endure the hard∣ships and fatigues of a mission to the western tribes of Indians, which he was requested by the board of Commissioners at Boston to undertake. His people were at first averse to his going; but were at length prevailed upon by a committee of that board to consent, May 30th, 1762, that he might go for a few months. He accordingly set out the first of June, with Mr. Rice, now minister of Westminster and Mr. Elisha Gunn of Montague, for an interpreter: They followed Mohawk River about 70 miles, then turned southward to lake Osti∣ego near <HI>Cherry Valley,</HI> (this lake makes the head of one of the main branches of Susquehannah Riv∣er) crossed the lake, went down that river 120 miles to a town called <HI>Onoquagie,</HI> pleasantly situat∣ed on the eastern bank of the Susquehannah, then containing 30 houses, 40 families, and 300 in∣habitants, besides upwards of 20 warriors. Here they arrived June 21st, 1762. Near this place were two small towns of Tuscaroras. Here he preached; opened two schools, one for adults, and another for children; gathered a church; ad∣ministered
<PB N="76" REF="026481_0075_0FD05670C98A94C8"/>
special ordinances to them; and left them September 1st, 1762, under the care of Mr. Rice. During his stay there, he baptized great numbers; some brought their children 60 and 70 miles to receive Christian baptism: They were mostly infants, whose parents had been baptized by former missionaries, or in the Dutch or English churches in the vicinity of Albany.</P>
<P>Having gone through with the ecclesiastical his∣tory of Brookfield, a Geographical Description thereof shall now be presented.</P>
<P>Brookfield is distant from the Statehouse in Bos∣ton between sixty and seventy miles. The great post road from Boston to Newyork, runs through it; and the sixty one mile stone stands near the eastern boundary, and the seventy milestone near the western line. This town is bounded on the east by Spencer; on the south by Sturbridge and Western; on the west, by Western and Ware; and on the north, by Newbraintree and Oakham. It is a township of most excellent land in general. The face of the town is pretty uneven and stony, though there are three or four plains of considera∣ble extent within it, one especially in the first par∣ish, extensive, excellent for raising grain, and beau∣tiful for building spots, and large tracts of mead∣ow and interval upon Quaboag River, which runs in a westerly direction through the town. The main branch of this river comes from Rut∣land, another branch issues from North Pond, so called, in Leicester, and, running through Spencer, falls into Quaboag River in the easterly part of Brookfield.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="026481_0076_0FD04FD40D13ABE8"/>The land is generally fertile, and richly repays the cultivator for his labour and pains; and there is such a variety of soils, as to be suited to tillage, grazing, mowing and fruit. All kinds of grain are raised here to advantage; and farmers here, as well as elsewhere are making great improvements in husbandry.</P>
<P>There is so little descent in Quaboag river for five miles, that the current is very sluggish, the waters almost stagnant, and the extensive meadows on each side are of small value in their present state, being so liable to be overflowed. This evil has been growing for many years, through increas∣ing obstructions in so torpi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a stream; so that the grass, from being large and of good quality, is now so poor, and the making it into hay so uncertain, as to be very generally rejected. By much labour and expense in clearing the channel of obstructions, this evil may be cured. A trial was made last year by the proprietors of the meadows, whereof they reaped, sensibly, good effects; and hence are encouraged to a determined perseverance. Besides this flat meadow, there are large tracts of swaley or swampy land, which yield considerable quantities of fowlmeadow and other valuable grasses, to the amount of two tons on an acre when made into hay.</P>
<P>There is one large pond in the south precinct of the extent of a mile square, called by the In∣dians Quaboag Pond; but now more generally denominated Podunk Pond, from a tract of mead∣ow adjoining, which the Indians called Podunk.
<PB N="78" REF="026481_0077_0FD05673241D8390"/>
Quaboag river advances directly to the very bank of this pond; then turns, almost at right angles, and runs parallel with the edge about twenty rods, leaving a narrow beach or ridge; then diverges so as to form a small island, upon which shrubs, alders and bushes are growing; then bends its course and opens a channel into the pond, at the northeast, running nearly through the middle of it, and passes off in an outlet at the westerly edge. Close to the side of the pond where the river en∣ters, is a large bridge, there being a county road along the beach of this pond, for more than half a mile; and travellers pass about twenty rods on a narrow ridge, between the river and pond, which, though very moderately sloping on the side next the pond, is perpendicular on the side of the river, and is generally overflowed in the spring and fall, to the hazard and sometimes suspension of travel∣ling. This beach had formerly a row of large pines and swamp white oaks growing upon it. But the floods, agitated by the winds, have so washed away the soil, that the most of them are dead and blown down, and the beach is gradually wearing away.</P>
<P>On the south of this pond, and about a quarter of a mile distant, is another pond, of not more than half the amplitude of the former, known by the name of the South Pond. This communi∣cates with, and empties its redundant waters into the larger pond, by a creek or brook, except in the time of a freshet, when the waters flow so much
<PB N="79" REF="026481_0078_0FD056748B467D68"/>
faster into the great pond as to reverse the current of the brook, and replenish the lesser.</P>
<P>There is another considerable pond in the west precinct, called Wickoboag Pond, from whence quantities of iron ore are annually collected. This pond is supplied by several rivulets, and has one large outlet into the river, about twenty or thirty rods in length, called Lashaway. These ponds and rivers, and the other smaller streams, by which the land is intersected, are plentifully furnished with pickerel, perch, and divers other kinds of fish.</P>
<P>On the rivers and streams in the town, there are seven grist mills, six saw mills, and three fulling mills. Mr. Jenks, besides his mills, prosecutes the blacksmiths' business largely, and has two trip ham∣mers, and a grindstone carried by water.</P>
<P>One of the clothiers' works above referred to, is in the first parish; a very convenient situation indeed for carrying on the clothiers' business in all its branches. Ellis and company are the pro∣prietors hereof. About 5000 yards of cloth are annually dressed at these works. These men have obtained the art of coloring scarlet, which com∣petent judges pronounce equal to any which is imported; an art which few in this Commonwealth have attained unto.</P>
<P>In a considerable part of the low lands, the clay lies near the surface. There is much clay adjoin∣ing the south pond, and clay forms the bed of the river. No mines have, as yet, been discovered, although search therefor has been made at no
<PB N="80" REF="026481_0079_0FD0567609A89478"/>
small expense. There is some iron ore, a bed of yellow ocre nearly exhausted, and large quantities, both of mud and stone, which yield copperas, and contain a strong vitriolic quality. Many of the wells, both on high and low grounds, have what is called hard water. There are also stones which contain sulphur; but how to extract it has not yet been discovered.</P>
<P>There are two large hills, principally in the first parish. One is called Coye's Hill, and supposed to take its name from one Coye, a proprietor of, and an early inhabitant in Brookfield. This hill extends into Western. The other is called <HI>Ragged Hill,</HI> probably from its extreme rough and rocky appearance. Both these hills are excellent for mowing, for pasturing, and for orcharding; and there are several very good farms upon them. Partly between these two hills there is a large ledge of rocks, which in all probability was rent asunder ages ago, by an earthquake: The rock on one side is shelving over, and the opening made is sufficient to contain an hundred men; and the appearance indicates that it was formerly a place of rendez∣vous for Indians. This place is called by the peo∣ple of Brookfield, <HI>The Stone House.</HI></P>
<P>The rivers, ponds and meadows, in this town, occasion heavy fogs, which, in some seasons, have produced putrid fevers, &amp;c. But observation clearly teaches that the inhabitants here are as healthy as in other places; and they who live in the low lands, as they who live on the high. This place has been famed for the longevity, and
<PB N="81" REF="026481_0080_0FD05677A1CC9680"/>
fruitfulness of some of its inhabitants. In 1782, a Mr. Green, then above ninety, followed his fifth child, a woman in her sixty second year, to the grave, above four miles, riding erect and steady, on a lively horse. He died not long since, in the vicinity of Hanover in Newhampshire, aged up∣wards of an 100 years. Also in 1782, died the widow Elizabeth Olds in her 92d year. Her pos∣terity were as follow; ten children, seventy three grand children, two hundred and one great grand children, and two of the fifth generation; two of her grand daughters being grandmothers. Total, two hundred and eighty six. Of these, two hundred and thirty two were living at her decease. In 1788, died Mr. Cyprian Rice, in the ninety eighth year of his age; and in a few months after died Mr. Elisha Rice, his brother, in the ninety ninth year of his age. They were born at Marlborough. They left not a numerous issue. There is now living in Brookfield a Mr. Thomas Ainsworth, who supposes he is the last surviving soldier who was in the famous Lovell's fight.</P>
<P>It is so long since the aboriginals quitted these grounds, that their monuments are almost effaced. Once in a while a point of an arrow, or some stone is found which be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the mark of Indian labour and dexterity. And there is still to be distinguish∣ed the spot on which they had a fort, and a cem∣etery where they buried their dead.</P>
<P>The growth of wood is principally chesnut, white oak, red oak, and some walnut. The
<PB N="82" REF="026481_0081_0FD05679098FA5A8"/>
swamps and swales yield maple, black birch, ash, and some hemlock.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Brookfield are chiefly farmers, though there is a proportion of mechanics, traders, and professional gentlemen. And the general ap∣pearance of the farms, buildings, roads, and man∣ners of the people, makes a favourable impression, and denotes a good degree of cultivation, taste and improvement.</P>
<P>Brookfield is distant from the Courthouse in Worcester, about twenty miles to the southwest.</P>

<HEAD>OXFORD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was a grant made by the gov∣ernment in the year 1682, to Joseph Dudley, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governor, to William Stoughton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts, to Major Robert Thomp∣son, Messrs. Cox and Blackwell, and their associ∣ates. It was stiled, A tract of land lying in the Nipnet or Nipmug country. The grant expressed eight miles square; but as surveyed and located, it must be near twelve miles in length from east to west, and about nine in width, from north to south, comprehending all Charlton, a part of Dudley, and a part of Ward. It was originally bounded west, on Newmedfield, (now Sturbridge) north, on a tract of land called the Country Gore,
<PB N="83" REF="026481_0082_0FD0567A8B92B138"/>
and Leicester; east, on Sutton; and south, by a gore of land and Dudley. It was surveyed by Mr. Gore of Roxbury, and a return thereof be∣ing made to the court, they accepted the same, and on the 16th of May, 1683, they granted the plantation, and gave it the name of Oxford.</P>
<P>The original proprietors of Oxford, in the year 1686, let on about thirty families of French prot∣estants, who were driven out of France, in conse∣quence of the repeal of the edict of Nantz, by Lew∣is XIV, in the year 1684. These unhappy French people, being seated at the easterly part, or end of Oxford, were grievously annoyed and distressed by the Indians, and were soon destroyed, or driven away and dispersed by them. Tradition says, one Johnson (whether a Frenchman or Englishman is uncertain) was here killed, and one or two of his children, while his wif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> escaped unperceived out of the house, at e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ening, with a child in her arms, and walked to Woodstock, about fifteen miles, that night, to a garrison there. At what time this was we cannot precisely say. But in the year 1693, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> particular act passed, empowering Oxford to send a representative to the General Court; as ap∣pears by the records in the Secretary's office of this Commonwealth.</P>
<P>As Oxford was then in the county of Suffolk, its first and earlier records were kept in Boston, and are said to have been burnt in the Statehouse there.</P>
<P>A deed was given by the original proprietors, or their heirs and executors, to such as were there, or
<PB N="84" REF="026481_0083_0FD0567C09A99A30"/>
others, of a part of the original grant, dated July 8th, 1713, that they might settle and build up the town. The first town meeting held in Oxford for the choice of town officers was on the 22d of July, 1713. The people inhabiting this territory were in continual fears from the natives; in conse∣quence of which, the settlement of the town went on but slowly for many years. Except what has been related above, I cannot find that any persons were killed by the Indians in Oxford. But Gov∣ernor Hutchinson gives a piece of history, which must not be omitted in this work. It is in these words. "On the sixth of August, 1724, four In∣dians came upon a small house in Oxford, which was built under a hill. They made a breach in the roof, and as one of them was attempting to en∣ter, he received a shot in his belly from a coura∣geous woman, the only person in the house, who had two muskets and two pistols charged, and was prepared for all four, but they thought fit to retreat, carrying off the dead, or wounded man." It is pity the name of this heroine has not been preserved, that it might be handed down to latest posterity.</P>
<P>The first settlers in Oxford, considering the then state of the country, took early care for the enjoy∣ment and support of a preached gospel, and the in∣stitutions of Christianity among them: According∣ly the first church of Christ in this place was gath∣ered January 18th, 1721, and the Rev. John Campbell was ordained the first minister, that same year, viz. March 11th, 1721. This gentle∣man
<PB N="85" REF="026481_0084_0FD0567DCCC9F0E8"/>
came from the north of Scotland; was edu∣cated at Edinburgh, and received the honours of that University. He came into America in the year 1717. He continued the worthy and faithful pastor of the church and flock here, until May 25th, 1761, when he died in the 71st year of his age, and in the 42d of his ministry.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Campbell was succeeded in the sacred office by the Rev. Joseph Bowman, who was installed here November 14th, 1764. (This Mr. Bowman was first ordained at Boston, August 31st, 1762, to the work of the gospel ministry, more es∣pecially, among the Mohawk Indians on the west∣ern borders of Newengland. He went to Onoho∣quague, an Indian town on the Susquehannah, in October following. He returned the last of May, 1763; but hostilities commencing between the Indians tribes in June, he did not go back to them; and the war continuing, he was, by the board of commissioners, dismissed from his mission in June, 1764.)—Mr. Bowman lived in great harmony with the people of Oxford until 1775, when the then state of the country, as to the controversy and war with Greatbritain, occasioned differences among the people; these led a number to profess themselves Quakers, and then they declared themselves to be of the sect, called Universalists, which finally ended in Mr. Bowman's dismission, at his desire, with advice of council, August 28th, 1782. After his removal from Oxford, the Rev. Mr. Bowman was installed at Bernard, in the State of Vermont, September 22, 1784, where he still continues, en∣joying
<PB N="86" REF="026481_0085_0FD0567F0B2637B0"/>
the affection of the people, in a growing, flourishing town, and blessed with peace and pros∣perity in his latter days.</P>
<P>The Rev. Elias Dudley was ordained successor to Mr. Bowman at Oxford, April 13th, 1791.</P>
<P>In the town of Oxford there is a society of them who are denominated Universalists, (about a fifth of the inhabitants:) These, with some families from several neighbouring towns, make a respecta∣ble society: And they have erected a large elegant meetinghouse, towards the south end of Oxford plain, where the road from Connecticut intersects the road from Worcester to Dudley. This house is constructed upon the most modern plan, with a tower and bell. This society have not, as yet, any settled minister. There is also a number in Oxford of the Anabaptist persuasion; they are destitute of any stated teacher.</P>
<P>We will now give some Geographical Descrip∣tion of this town. Oxford, though very extensive at first, has been much curtailed, nevertheless, it is still a large and respectable town, being about seven miles in length from north to south, and about five miles in width from east to west. The present boundaries of Oxford are as follow; north, it is bounded on Leicester, Ward, and a country gore of land: East, by Sutton; south, by a gore of land, and Dudley; and west, by Charlton. When the late census was taken there were 150 houses, and 1000 inhabitants in the town. The town of Oxford is not very hilly and uneven: In the centre thereof there is a large and fine plain of
<PB N="87" REF="026481_0086_0FD05680886EFF20"/>
a mile and a half in length, and about a mile in width: This plain is almost wholly under culti∣vation, and is pretty level. On this plain, the road from Worcester to the easterly part of Connecticut, and to Rhodeisland, runs from the north to the south: Near the north end of it stands the congregational meetinghouse; and about a mile south of this is the meetinghouse of the society of Universalists: These houses are both large and elegant: On ei∣ther side of the street there are many good build∣ings; and almost the whole plain is under the eye of the traveller at once. From the plain the lands rise on all sides, especially on the east and on the west; but not very high. The soil on the plain is good for grain of all kinds; but not so for pastur∣age or mowing. But the higher lands are very good for mowing, pasturing and orcharding, the soil is strong and fertile. Dudley hills, so called, on the south, which are pretty high, fall partly with∣in the limits of Oxford. About three quarters of a mile west of the great road on the plain, runs French River from the north to the south, which falls into the river Quinebaug in the town of Thompson in the State of Connecticut. This river derived its name from the French protestants who first settled in Oxford. On this river are some very good meadows of several hundreds of acres. On the east side of the plain there is a fine stream, which heads in Great Meadow, so called, in the norther∣ly part of the town, containing 100 acres, or more. By the sides of this stream there are some pretty good meadows. This brook empties into French
<PB N="88" REF="026481_0087_0FD056FE8A2F6048"/>
River. Potash Brook, so called, which is never dry, is a fine rivulet, and falls into the above mention∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brook. Upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and on these streams, there are within Oxford limits, three grist mills; six saw mills; and two clothiers' works. There are also, in the town, porash works. There are two very pretty ponds in the town: One in the wester∣ly part, called Augootsback: The other a little north of the first meetinghouse on the Worcester road, known by the name of <HI>Oxford Pond.</HI> There are some small cedar swamps, in this town, which yield cedar for shingles, and other valuable uses. The town is in general well wooded: On the higher lands are oaks of all kinds, walnut and ches∣nut: On the lower, grow ash, birch, maple, &amp;c. There is some pitch pine in the town: But not much white pine, at this day, that being chiefly taken off. On the plain, there are two or three stores of European and India goods: And in the town there are all the common artificers, trades∣men and mechanics; but the body of the people are farmers. The roads of travel through Ox∣ford are an advantage to the town—the largest road is that which comes from Connecticut through Charlton, Oxford, to Sutton, and so on to Boston, falling into the post road in Weston: The next, is the road from Worcester, through Oxford, to Dudley, &amp;c. &amp;c. Oxford is situated to the south∣west from Boston, at the distance of 54 miles; and from Worcester courthouse it is 10 miles, nearly south.</P>

<P>THIS tract of land was originally purchased by a number of gentlemen, of Sachem John Wampus, and his company, Indians who claimed it. Wampus first reserved four miles square, for his countrymen the Indians, which they called <HI>Hassanamisco</HI>; this is now Grafton. It was to begin at a certain bound, which he fixed upon; and then the purchasers above referred to, were to have as much land, as eight miles square would amount to, situated in the Nipmug country, be∣tween the towns of Mendon, Marlborough, Wor∣cester, Oxford, and New Sherburne (now Doug∣lass) and this was confirmed to the purchasers, May 15th, 1704, and formed into a township and called Sutton, by an act of the General Court, dat∣ed June 21st, 1715. That part of the original purchase, which fell to the eastward of Hassana∣misco, or Grafton, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part of it, many years ago annexed to the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Westborough, and the other part, with some from M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndon and Hopkinton, taken to form the town of Upton. So that what now is properly Sutton does not lie in a bad form. A few families were annexed to Northbridge, some years ago: And a few also, at the northwest angle of the town, were annexed to Ward. The general boundaries of Sutton, are at present, as follow: North, by Worcester; east and north, by Grafton;
<PB N="90" REF="026481_0089_0FD04FE48B1D46A0"/>
east, by Northbridge and Uxbridge; south, by Douglass; west, by Oxford; and northwest, by Ward. Oxford line is S. 1° W. Douglass, E. 60° N. Mendon, N. 8° E. Worcester, W. 22° S.</P>
<P>The settling and peopling of the town was retard∣ed for some time, by re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of wars with the In∣dians. However, in the year 1716, three families had got seated in the place, and wintered there in the winter of 1716 and 1717, when the great snow fell, as our fathers have told us. This snow fell on some of the last days of February, old stile, and came so deep, that it wholly covered over the hut in which one of the families lived. The man being from home, the family might have perished had not an Indian, who knew the circum∣stances, come to their relief. He found the hut only by the hole which the smoke from the fire place had made through the snow.</P>
<P>In September 1717, the fall after the great snow, the first child was born in the town, named Abigail Marsh, daughter of Mr. Benjamin Marsh, who was afterwards an anabaptist elder in the town. This woman is now living, has had four husbands, and is, at this time, a widow; her name is Chase.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Sutton first acted as a body corporate, or held their first town meeting on the 3d day of December, 1718, at the dwelling house of Mr. John Stockwell. Their business was to or∣ganize themselves, and to choose a committee to join the proprietors' committee in order to procure preaching. Consequently they must have been in∣corporated a little before by an act of the Legisla∣ture,
<PB N="91" REF="026481_0090_0FD27D9E1408B538"/>
and vested with full town powers and privi∣leges: And this was previous to the incorporation of Leicester or Rutland.</P>
<P>The exact day when the first congregational church in Sutton was imbodied cannot be ascer∣tained. The record says, "In the fall of the year 1720." The first minister, the Rev. John MacKins∣try, was ordained November 9th, 1720. He was a gentleman of good abilities and had his education in Scotland. Observe, by the way, the early care and pains this people took to have the gospel preached, and a minister settled among them. In about four years from their beginning the settle∣ment of the place, they had a minister ordained.</P>
<P>Mr. MacKinstry differed so much from the peo∣ple in his notions of church government, that they parted: And he was dismissed from his pasto∣ral relation to them, September 2d, 1728. This gentleman was afterwards resettled in Connecticut.</P>
<P>The second minister of the town, the Rev. David Hall, was ordained October 15th, 1729. He re∣ceived the honourary degree of <HI>Doctor of Divinity,</HI> at Dartmouth college, in the year 1777. After a life of piety and usefulness, he died May 8th, 1789, in the 85th year of his age, and the 60th year of his ministry.</P>
<P>Dr. Hall was succeeded in the sacred office by the Rev. Edmund Mills, who was separated there∣unto June 23d, 1790. The people of the first con∣gregational church and society have lately repair∣ed their meetinghouse, and built a tower to it: And Mr. Ebenezer Warters, a man of large prop∣erty
<PB N="92" REF="026481_0091_0FD27D57F284A9B8"/>
in the town, has given them a bell weighing about 750 lb. and which cost upwards of 80<HI>l.</HI> And Mr. Gardner Warters, deceased, gave 30<HI>l.</HI> towards a clock for the meetinghouse.</P>
<P>The second parish in Sutton was incorporated by an act of Court, October 28th, 1743. This is about three miles wide, and six and one half miles in length; so that the old parish is much larger. The first meeting of the second parish was held December 26th, 1743. The second congregation∣al church in the town, was formed by a covenant, dated September 10th, 1747. The Rev. James Welman was consecrated Pastor of the second church October 7th, 1747, and was dismissed from office July 22d, 1760. The Rev. Mr. Welman was, in 1768, resettled at Cornish, in the county of Cheshire, in the State of Newhampshire.</P>
<P>Mr. Welman was succeeded in the pastoral office, in the second church in Sutton, by the Rev. Eben∣ezer Chaplain, who was ordained November 14th, 1764.</P>
<P>There is no record to be found when the first Anabaptist society was collected in Sutton, nor when Mr. Benjamin Marsh, their first elder, was ordained. Tradition says, it was about the year 1735. They built a small meetinghouse about a mile westerly from the first parish meetinghouse. After some years part of Elder Marsh's congrega∣tion left him, and joining with new ones, in the year 1767 introduced Mr. Jeremiah Barstow, as their Elder, and built another Anabaptist meet∣inghouse about a mile further westerly, on the road
<PB N="93" REF="026481_0092_0FD27D594414DC60"/>
towards Oxford. In 1772, the major part of Elder Barstow's society became dissatisfied with him; he then, with his adherents, asked a dismission from the rest, and adjoined to Elder Marsh and the re∣mainder of his society. In January 1775, Elder Marsh died in the 89th year of his age. Mr. Barstow kept up a society in town, until 1782, when he moved away. In 1783, they introduced Mr. Ebenezer Lamson as their teacher, and who, continuing with them until the first of April, 1788, was then ordained their elder. In the southeast part of the town the people have for several years heard one Mr. William Batcheldor, who lived among them, and in October, 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he was ordain∣ed their elder.</P>
<P>About ten years past, the Shakers made consider∣able appearance in the second parish, in this town, but have some time since, wholly subsided.</P>
<P>There have also, for ten or twelve years past, been a number of the sect called Universalists, in Sutton; the most of them congregate at Oxford; a few at Grafton. There is one family in town, who profess to be Quakers. The number of these several denominations cannot be ascertained, as many of them are unstable.</P>
<P>We will now present our readers with some To∣pographical Description of the town of Sutton.</P>
<P>The general face of it is hilly land, of a deep loam, pretty rocky, good for orcharding, and for Indian corn and grass; but indifferent for all other sorts of grain, and for flax. There are several mead∣ows and swamps, but none very extensive, or any
<PB N="94" REF="026481_0093_0FD27D5AD6E82E78"/>
way remarkable. There is a considerable body of poor land in the south part of the town; and there is a small quantity of poor, broken land in the northeast corner of the second parish. There is some good, both high and low interval land, on Blackstone River, so called. As this river has its source in Sutton, and is singular in its formation and course, we shall attempt a particular descrip∣tion of it. The reputed head of this river is a pond of about 70 acres, called Ramshorn Pond, because of the crookedness of the stream which issues from it. The pond is situated about two miles south∣west from the second parish meetinghouse. It has a small inlet at the southwest part; the outlet is at the northeast; and the stream runs northeast until it comes within about half a mile west of said meet∣inghouse; then bears away northwest, and runs through Ward, within about half a mile of Ward meetinghouse; takes in several streams in that town, which have mills on them, particularly one coming from Leicester, called Kettle Brook; passes on to Worcester; and about a mile southerly from the south meetinghouse, receives Bimilick or Mill Brook, which comes from the North Pond in Wor∣cester, then turns back, running southeasterly, and comes within half a mile east of Sutton second par∣ish meetinghouse; passes on and takes in the Mill Brook, so called, the outlet of a large pond, called Crooked Pond, lying a little west of the line be∣tween the two meetinghouses in Sutton; and which is about a mile east of the little or Ramshorn Pond first mentioned. The inlet of this pond is on the
<PB N="95" REF="026481_0094_0FD27D5D76F1B838"/>
southwest, the outlet is northeast, has a grist mill (in the north parish near the pond) with two run∣ners, which, according to the original grant, has the sole command of the water. This pond is supposed to be fed chiefly by springs, and is little affected by droughts: Many people from the neighbouring towns bring their grain to this mill, in dry seasons. On this same brook, about half a mile below, is Messrs. Burbanks' paper mill. A few rods below, is an oil mill. A few rods below the oil mill, is a fulling mill. A few rods below the fulling mill, in the late war, powder mills were erected, but are since discontinued. A little furth∣er down, in the year 1776, a gun manufactory was erected, but is since converted into a man∣ufactory for scythes, axes and mill irons; and here they have trip hammers, bellows, and grindstones, carried by water. Having described this brook, issuing from the pond, and the water works upon it, we return to the river. The river, after it has received this brook, bears away, and runs northeast, and east; and takes in a brook from a pond in the northeast part of the second parish in Sutton, call∣ed <HI>Dorrett</HI>'s <HI>Pond</HI>; having an inlet on the north∣west; the outlet is at the southeast. Said river then runs easterly into Grafton, and there receives the stream which issues from Quinsigamond, or Shrewsbury Long Pond. The river then bears away, and runs southerly through Northbridge and Uxbridge; and, about a mile southeast from Uxbridge meetinghouse, takes in a stream which issues from a pond chiefly in Sutton, near the
<PB N="96" REF="026481_0095_0FD27D63993556B0"/>
southwest corner of the town, called Manchaug Pond. This pond has an inlet on the northwest; the outlet is to the southeast, and both in Sutton. This outlet runs along near the south line of Sut∣ton, until it comes to Uxbridge.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the river, and the streams, we would just observe, this town is famed for its manufactures, its mills, and water works. Here are, one paper mill, one oil mill, ten grist mills, six saw mills, three fulling mills, seven trip ham∣mers, five scythe and ax makers, one hoe maker; several who work at nail making; and six works for making of potash. But here are no mines, no forge, furnace, pearlshery, nor fish of any conse∣quence.</P>
<P>There are two or three natural curiosities worthy of particular notice.</P>
<P>As first, In the west part of Sutton, within sixty rods of the rise of the inlet of Ramshorn Pond, which is the head of Blackstone River running to Providence and falling into the sea at Bristol, is a brook so large as to carry a saw mill in Sutton, then bears away into Oxford, joins French River, which unites with the river Quinebaug, and enters the sea at Newlondon.</P>
<P>Secondly, A few rods west of the second parish meetinghouse, there is a swamp, having two out∣lets; one at the southwest; the other at the north∣east: Both these outlets enter Blackstone River, above described, at about one mile's distance from each other: But the river is estimated to run ten or twelve miles, after the entrance of that on the
<PB N="97" REF="026481_0096_0FD27D6DCC2204A0"/>
westerly side, before it returns and takes in that on the east.</P>
<P>Thirdly, In the southeasterly part of the town is a cavern in the earth or rocks, commonly called <HI>Purgatory.</HI> The rocks on each side of the chasm evidently appear to have been rent asunder. People may enter some rods under the ground or rocks, and there are cracks down which they drop pebbles, and after these strike the sides alternately several times, they are heard to fall into the water; and a brook issues out at the bottom of the hill.</P>
<P>It may be acceptable to give a more particular description of this place, called Purgatory.</P>
<P>It is the side of a hill, which consists of vast ledg∣es of rocks: Where the natural descent begins, a chasm has been formed of perhaps thirty, and in some places, forty feet in width, in these ledges, by some violent concussion, which left this body of stones of all shapes and sizes, to fall in: A∣bove, it is all open to the heavens; and the ledg∣es, on either side, are from five to ten, and so on to twenty, and even forty feet in height. This chasm is, perhaps, near eighty rods in length; and the descent is gradual, and not very diffi∣cult. Where the greatest depth is, water issues from crevices in the rocks, and hangs in icicles, and even in solid bodies of ice, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only in May, as I have seen, but in June, although the descent is to the south. Some small caverns were formed by the falling of these rocks, through which persons have descended, and come out seve∣ral rods below. This is a most stupendous place,
<PB N="98" REF="026481_0097_0FD27D6F43C09240"/>
and fills the mind of the beholder with most exalt∣ed ideas of the infinite power of the great Creator of all things, "who removeth the mountains, and they know not; who shaketh the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble." After all, no description given of this place, by another, will en∣able persons to form just and adequate conceptions of it.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in Sutton, is oak of all sorts, and what they call the oak chesnut, the bark whereof is like the common gray oak, but the leaves resemble, almost exactly, those of the chesnut tree; walnut of all kinds; great plenty of chesnut; con∣siderable of butternut; but little of buttonwood. In the low lands the wood is ash, beech, birch, elm of all sorts, maple, white and pitch pine. They have also sassafras, sarsaparilla, and alders. Here are to be found ginseng, and the cohush root, of special medicinal qualities.</P>
<P>There is much travelling through this town. The principal roads are—one coming from Connecticut, through Oxford, and passing from west to east, through the town. About three miles west of the first parish meetinghouse this road parts; the left hand road passes by the meetinghouse, and so on through Grafton, Westborough, and Southbor∣ough, and leads to Boston, falling into the post road in Weston. The right hand road, at said parting, passes on about two miles south of said meetinghouse, and enters what is called the middle road in Uxbridge, and so goes on, through Men∣don, to Boston. Another principal road, is a coun∣ty
<PB N="99" REF="026481_0098_0FD27D705836DA40"/>
road from Worcester, passing from north to south through the town, by both meetinghouses: At the south meetinghouse it parts, and, by various part∣ings, leads to Douglass and the west part of Ux∣bridge.</P>
<P>There is another county road, which leads from Uxbridge to Worcester, through the east part of Sutton. This was lately in contemplation to be made the post road from Worcester to Providence.</P>
<P>The town of Sutton is distant from the State∣house in Boston 46 miles to the southwest. And from Worcester courthouse, it is six miles to the north parish meetinghouse; and to the south parish meetinghouse, to the south nine miles.</P>
<P>This is a large and flourishing town, the second in wealth in the county; and when the census was taken in 1791, there were 2642 inhabitants there∣in.</P>

<HEAD>LEICESTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE township of Leicester was grant∣ed by the General Court, on the tenth of Februa∣ry, 1713, to Col. Joshua Lamb, of Roxbury, and others, his associates; and on the fifteenth day of the same month and year, the Court, by a particu∣lar resolve or act, gave this tract of land the name of Leicester. The natives called the place <HI>Towtaid</HI>;
<PB N="100" REF="026481_0099_0FD27D71F25066D0"/>
and by the English it was usually called <HI>Strawber∣ry Hill.</HI> The place was not incorporated, and vested with town powers and privileges, until the close of the year 1720, or the beginning of the year 1721: For the first town meeting held in Leicester was on the sixth of March, 172<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. A sur∣vey of this grant being ordered, and a return there∣of made, the General Court established the lines and boundaries of it by a special act, on the 19th of January, 1714. The tract was to be eight miles square; and was granted on these conditions, that the proprietors should reserve a sufficient quantity of land for the use of the ministry and schools, and see that fifty families were settled thereon in seven years. The proprietors accordingly, at a meeting in Boston, on the 23d of February, 1713, voted to give one half of the township to fifty families who should settle thereon, in that space of time. That number of families hav∣ing removed to, and settled at Leicester, the propri∣etors, at a meeting held at Boston, on the 23d of July, 1722, chose a committee, consisting of Wil∣liam Dudley and Joshua Lamb, Esqrs; Mr. Nathan∣iel Kenny, Mr. Samuel Tyler, and Mr. Samuel Green, to make and execute a deed of the easterly half of Leicester, lying west of and adjoining to Worcester; east of Brookfield, south of Rutland, and north of a gore of land lying between Oxford and Leicester, to Mr. John Stebbins, and others; which deed bears date January 8th, 1724; and was recorded November 26th, 1729, Libro 29th, page 329 of the records of the county of Middle∣sex.
<PB N="101" REF="026481_0100_0FD27D744D991FF8"/>
This grant was intended to be eight miles square: But the measure was large, and included the whole of what is now Spencer: And at the north end, two miles in width and four in length were taken off to help form the town of Paxtor in 1765: And at the southeast part of the town, about 2500 acres were taken off to aid in making up the town of Ward, in 1778. Leicester is still a very considerable town, and contained when the enume∣ration was made, nearly 1100 inhabitants.—It is bounded on the north by Paxton; on the east by Worcester and Ward; on the south by Oxford; and on the west by Spencer.</P>
<P>The first settlers of Leicester, like the people in general, of that day, paid early attention to relig∣ion, to the support of the gospel, and the institu∣tions of Christ among them. When the congre∣gational church in this place was gathered, cannot now be exactly ascertained, as there were no church records kept or preserved, till within about 40 years. But the probability is this, that the church was formed at the time of the first minister's being settled with them, who was the Rev. David Par∣sons. This Mr. Parsons was ordained at Malden, near Boston, but soon removed with a considerable part of his people, to Leicester, where he was in∣stalled, by the best account to be now had, Septem∣ber 15th, 1721. He did not continue long in the ministry at Leicester, but was dismissed from his pastoral relation to that flock, and died in about two years after. He was succeeded in the sacred office, at Leicester, by the Rev. David Goddard,
<PB N="102" REF="026481_0101_0FD27D7AAE1CB000"/>
who was solemnly consecrated thereto June 30th, 1736. He was not suffered to continue long with this people, by reason of death; for being on a journey, at Framingham, he was there seized with a fever which put a period to his days January 19th, 1754, in the 48th year of his age, and the 13th of his ministry.</P>
<P>The Rev. Joseph Roberts succeeded Mr. God∣dard in the ministry at Leicester, whereunto he was ordained October 23d, 1754, and he was dismissed therefrom December 15th, 1762. To him suc∣ceeded in the work of the gospel ministry, the Rev. Benjamin Conklin, who was separated thereunto on the 23d of November, 1763, and still continues in office.</P>
<P>There is a considerable society of Anabaptists in Leicester, and which has been of long standing. Their first teacher was Mr. Thomas Green, a phy∣sician. After his death, the Rev. Benjamin Foster, A. M. was ordained among them; but for want of support he removed, and has been resettled in the city of Newyork; where he is a worthy minis∣ter, and has lately received the degree of Doctor of Divinity. The Anabaptist society in Leicester, have for their present teacher Mr. Nathan Dana. Their house of worship is in the south part of the town.</P>
<P>Also, there is in Leicester, a number of the peo∣ple called Friends, or Quakers, who have a very good house for their way of worship, erected in the north part of the town in the year 1791.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="026481_0102_0FD27D7F7504E428"/>Notwithstanding the difference of sentiment, in religious matters, between the various denomina∣tions of the people of Leicester, the greatest liberal∣ity and cordiality prevail, both in their town meet∣ings, and family connexions and intercourse.</P>
<P>There is an Academy established in this town, and called <HI>Leicester Academy,</HI> for the purposes of promoting true piety and virtue, and for the edu∣cation of youth in the English, Latin, Greek, and French languages; together with writing, arith∣metick, and the art of speaking; also practical ge∣ometry, logick, philosophy, and such other of the liberal arts and sciences or languages, as opportu∣nity may hereafter permit. Ebenezer Crafts, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Sturbridge, and Jacob Davis, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Charlton, in the county of Worcester, generously gave a large and commodious mansion house, lands and ap∣purtenances, in Leicester, for an Academy. This Academy was incorporated by an act of the Legis∣lature, March 23d, 1784, and trustees were ap∣pointed; their number is never to be more than fifteen, nor less than eight.</P>
<P>The principal instructor, ex officio, is always to be one.</P>
<P>The first trustees, appointed by the Court, were, Ebenezer Crafts, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Sturbridge; Jacob Davis, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Charlton; Hon. Moses Gill, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Prince∣ton; Hon.

Judge Gill has given a number of well chosen books, which cost 30l. sterling in England, to the academy, for the use of the instructors, and also for the use of the students, under certain regulations.</P>
<P>Some Topographical Description of this town shall now be attempted.</P>
<P>Leicester is situated upon the height of land between the Atlantick Ocean, east and south, and Connecticut River on the west. The town is very hilly and uneven; it is indeed famed for its
<PB N="106" REF="026481_0105_0FD27D855CA1C1F8"/>
hills, but these are moist, springy and rocky yet not exceedingly so. The soil is pretty good, deep and strong, but rather cold clayey and wet, not so well adapted to grain as to grass and pastur∣age: It is pretty good for orcharding and fruit trees of all kinds.</P>
<P>There are divers hills of note and fame in the town; the first we shall mention, and the most considerable, is Strawberry Hill, so called by the English when they first came there, in consequence of the exuberant growth of those berries. On this hill stands their elegant new meetinghouse, on the northwest side of the common which is level, fac∣ing to the southeast, erected in 1784. At the northeast angle of the square stands the academy buildings; the other sides of the square are lined with large handsome dwelling houses. This hill is high and rather steep, but not large and exten∣sive. A second hill is called <HI>Indian Hill,</HI> or <HI>Bald Hill,</HI> on account of its being cleared and planted with corn by the Indians, a long time before the white people went up so far to live. A third is called <HI>Moose Hill,</HI> because of the great number of those quadrupeds which were wont to harbour there. Another is called <HI>Cary's Hill,</HI> from one of that name who went thither and digged a cave in the side of this hill, and lived there as an hermit many years, while that part of the country was in its wilderness state. A fifth is known by the name of <HI>Grass Hill.</HI></P>
<P>Although there is no river running through the town, yet it is well watered by springs and rivulets,
<PB N="107" REF="026481_0106_0FD27D8C36026E68"/>
and by several large brooks upon which there are three corn and five saw mills; here also are clothiers' works, where that business is carried on in all its branches. Two of the brooks above re∣ferred to, run from north to south, and are empti∣ed, one into Providence river, the other into the Sound or sea, at Newlondon, in Connecticut. The first of these is called Kettle Brook, and has its source in that part of Paxton which was former∣ly Leicester; is a very considerable stream, and running through the easterly part of the town, passes into Ward, and there falls into Blackstone River. The other rises from a large meadow in the westerly part of the town, of upwards of an hundred acres, part of which is in Spencer; this stream connects itself with the outlet of a pond which is situated a little easterly of the centre of the town of about forty or fifty acres: These two are the sources of French River, which runs through Oxford, and falls into the sea at Newlondon.</P>
<P>There is another pond in the northwesterly part of the town, containing about one hundred acres, whence issues a stream which runs westerly, and forms a branch of the River Chicabee, and falls into Connecticut River at Springfield. On this stream or outlet from the pond there is a grist mill, and by a drain and dam the pond may be raised or lowered ten feet, which is of singular advantage to the inhabitants of the vicinity, on account of grinding in the summer season.</P>
<P>In the easterly part of the town there is a place where the water, running from the northerly side
<PB N="108" REF="026481_0107_0FD27D8EF54A8C30"/>
of the post road, goes to Providence, while that on the south side goes to Newlondon. In the wester∣ly part of the town there is also a place where the water, from the north side of the road, runs to Connecticut River; and that on the south side goes to Newlondon.</P>
<P>There is in this town a great variety of timber and wood, being a good proportion of almost eve∣ry kind which is known to grow in this part of the country, except pitch and yellow pine.</P>
<P>The principal roads of travel, are, first, the post road from Boston to Springfield, through the mid∣dle of the town: Secondly, about one hundred rods west from the meetinghouse is the county road to Sturbridge, which turns to the left hand: Thirdly, through the north part of the town is a county road from Worcester to Newbraintree and Hardwick: Fourthly, from Rutland, and the northern part of the county, there is a large road through the town, leading through Charlton, Dud∣ley, Pomfret, &amp;c. to Norwich.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Leicester mostly live by the cultivation of the soil; and here are many very fine farms, and the buildings are in general good, and indicate a very considerable degree of wealth. There are several persons here who deal in foreign and domestick articles of trade; and they have besides the usual mechanicks and tradesmen, a fa∣mous gunsmith, Mr. Thomas Earle, who is suppos∣ed to equal any workman in the United States, in that branch of business.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="026481_0108_0FD27D8FE4F7B308"/>Here also there are established manufactories of cotton and wool cards, and the work is carried on in all its branches to the greatest perfection. In this business are constantly employed fifteen or twenty men, exclusive of a great number of women and children: And they vend, annually, from twelve to fifteen thousand pair.</P>
<P>Leicester is a growing flourishing town; and is situated upon the post road from Boston to Hart∣ford, Newyork and Philadelphia: It is six miles from the courthouse in Worcester, a little to the southwest; and from Boston, it is fifty three miles, several degrees to the south of west.</P>

<P>WE are happy in being able to say, that the records respecting Rutland, have been kept very correct and perfect, and in fine order from the first.</P>

<P><PB N="112" REF="026481_0111_0FD27D95E674CD88"/>The proprietors, at a meeting at Boston, Decem∣ber 14th, 1715, voted that the contents of six miles square be surveyed, and set off for the settle∣ment of 62 families in order to the performance of the condition of the grant. The six miles square, granted to men who would go on and settle, was that part which is now called Rutland. The set∣tlers on the 11th of August 1720, entered into a written agreement with the proprietors, and bound themselves by certain articles, signed and witness∣ed. And on the 26th of June 1721, this six miles square was confirmed to the settlers by the propri∣etors, as a sure estate of inheritance to them, their heirs and assigns forever, and recorded. On the 12th of July 1721, the inhabitants of Rutland were assembled, by order of the committee of the proprietors, to choose a minister, when the Rev. Jo∣seph Willard was chosen, by a great majority of the voters. At a meeting of the freeholders and inhabi∣tants of this six miles square, or Rutland, October 9th, 1721, Samuel Wright moderator, "Voted, that the town will prefer a petition to the General Court, to give their sanction, and establish them as a town, to have and enjoy all the privileges other towns enjoy."</P>
<P>A petition was accordingly presented to the General Court, and they sometime in their session, which was begun at Boston upon Wednesday the 30th of May 1722, passed an act of incorporation, entitled,

officers, and for the empowering them to raise and collect money for the defraying of the necessary charges of the said town. Forasmuch as it appears that the proprietors of the township of Rutland, have performed the conditions of the grant made thereof by the Great and General Assembly of this Province in 1713, Be it enacted by his Ex∣cellency the Governor, the Council, and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, That the inhabitants and freeholders of the said town of Rutland be in∣vested with, and forever hereafter enjoy all the powers, privileges and immunities, which other towns within this Province, by law, have and usu∣ally enjoy; and that they be, and hereby are ena∣bled, to levy, assess and collect three pence per acre, per annum, for the space of two years and a half from the first day of July last past (the time that the minister began to officiate as a minister there) on all the lands both improved and unim∣proved, whether divided or undivided, contained within the lines of the contents of six miles square, as is already laid out, and within which the pres∣ent inhabitants settled; and that the said land be subjected and made liable to the payment of the same, to defray the charge of building the meeting∣house, and paying the minister's settlement and salary, excepting only the present minister's lot, and ministry lot, with their divisions, also the school lot, and also one thousand acres of land appertain∣ing to S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>muel Sewall, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> (the committee of Rut∣land hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agreed, for certain considerations with

<P>From the foregoing statement, it appears that the whole grant of 12 miles square was named Rut∣land, in 1713; but that only the six miles square granted by the proprietors to the settlers, was call∣ed Rutland, and incorporated as a town; and that this was not done until the session of the General Court which was begun May 30, 1722. And in consequence of the above recited act, an order of the General Court passed July 6th, 1722, author∣izing and empowering Capt. Samuel Wright to call a meeting of the freeholders and other inhabi∣tants of the town of Rutland, on the last Monday of July current, then to choose town officers to serve until the general meeting in March next. The town was notified and met accordingly; and this was the first legal town meeting ever held in Rutland.</P>
<P>After the settlers had performed their conditions, and the six miles square was incorporated, we find the proprietors of the township of Rutland, in all
<PB N="115" REF="026481_0114_0FD27D52531C78A8"/>
future meetings, had nothing to do with said six miles square, which is now the town of Rutland; but concerned themselves only with the other parts of their original grant, we shall therefore leave them, and confine ourselves to the account of Rut∣land.</P>
<P>We have said, the settlers of the six miles square, on the 12th of July 1721, invited the Rev. Joseph Willard to settle with them in the work of the min∣istry, which invitation he accepted. This Mr. Willard had been ordained a minister of Sunder∣land in the county of Hampshire, but continued a very little time with them before he was dismissed. After he had accepted the invitation to settle with the people of Rutland, he met with many and great discouragements, and particularly by reason of the fears and dangers arising from the Indians; so that an appointment of his installation was deferred. However, at length a day was fixed upon for his solemn separation to the work of the ministry in that place, in the fall of the year 1723; but he lived not to see the day, being cut off by the ene∣my, as shall be now related. As Deacon Joseph Stevens and four of his sons were making hay in a meadow, at Rutland, a little north of the place where the meetinghouse now stands, August 14th, 1723, they were surprised by five Indians. The father escaped in the bushes; two of his sons were then and there slain; the other two, (Phinehas the eldest, and Isaac the youngest) were made prison∣ers. Two of the five Indians waylaid a Mr. Davis and son, who that afternoon were making hay in
<PB N="116" REF="026481_0115_0FD27DA0053D6288"/>
a meadow not far off, but weary of waiting they were returning to the others, and met Mr. Willard in their way, who was armed: One of the Indians' guns missed fire, the others did no execution. Mr. Willard returned the fire, and wounded one of them, it is said mortally, the other closed in with Mr. Willard; but he would have been more than a match for him, had not the other three come to his assistance: And it was some considerable time before they killed Mr. Willard. This account Phinehas Stevens gave upon his return from cap∣tivity, who was a spectator of some part of the tragedy. The Indians having killed and scalped Mr. Willard, and taken some of his clothes, went off to Canada with the two captives above named. They were redeemed in about a year. Phinehas Stevens was a famous warrior, a captain, and a principal man in building up and defending the then young plantation No. 4, now Charlestown, in Newhampshire state. Isaac Stevens lived at Rutland. They have both been dead many years. On the 3d of August 1724, the Indians came again upon Rutland, killed three persons, wound∣ed one, and made another prisoner. This is as I find it related in Governor Hutchinson's history. Others speak of but two killed: But the names of the killed, wounded, or prisoner, cannot now be ascertained. This was the last mischief done at Rutland by the Indians, so far as we can learn.</P>
<P>The Ecclesiastical History of Rutland is brief and as here follows. The church of Christ in the town was gathered November 1st, 1727, and on
<PB N="117" REF="026481_0116_0FD27DA5F59748B8"/>
the same day the Rev. Thomas Frink was ordain∣ed their first Pastor. Mr. Frink continued but a little time as their minister, being dismissed from his office September 8th, 1740. (Mr. Frink was installed Pastor of the third church in Plymouth, November 7th, 1743, where he continued minister but a short space; being dismissed from thence, he was installed at Barre on the last Wednesday in October 1753; from whence also he was dismissed July 17th, 1766.) The Rev. Joseph Buckminster succeeded Mr. Frink, as a minister of the gospel of Christ, at Rutland, whereunto he was ordained September 15th, 1742. Mr. Buckminster continu∣ed the able faithful and worthy minister of Rut∣land until November 3d, 1792, when he died in the 73d year of his age, and the 51st of his minis∣try. He was succeeded in about eight months, by the Rev. Hezekiah Goodrich, who was separated to the pastoral office in Rutland, on the 19th of June 1793.</P>
<P>In this town upwards of forty persons have late∣ly united, and established a social Library, of the value of nearly 30<HI>l.</HI> and containing about 70 vol∣umes at present.</P>
<P>Some Geographical Description of Rutland shall now be attempted.</P>
<P>The town is situated on the height of land be∣tween the sea and Connecticut River: It is hilly and very uneven: The hill on which the meeting∣house stands is high: And the meetinghouse may be seen in many of the adjacent towns, and even at a great distance to the west and northwest; but
<PB N="118" REF="026481_0117_0FD27DA9E0F652F0"/>
as the town abounds with hills it affords no exten∣sive and commanding prospect of itself. East of the meetinghouse is a hill called Muschapauge hill or Rice's hill, containing two or three hundred acres, this is very good land, and has some fine farms upon it. Part of Turkey Hill, so called, on the south falls within Rutland, the rest is in Paxton. This is high, but most excellent land.</P>
<P>Other hills there are many, but none particular∣ly noticeable. The land in general is very good, and the soil is rich and strong: It is not extraordi∣nary for raising of grain, though a sufficiency is produced for the inhabitants; it is very well adapted to grass and grazing, and most excellent for orcharding: Here are large and fine orchards, and much cyder is made in the town.</P>
<P>Rutland, being the height of land, has no large rivers running through it. Piss River, so called, which originates on the west side of Watchusett Hill, runs through Hubbardston, and passes across the northwest angle of this town, and so falls into Ware river. On this river are one corn mill, two saw mills, one fulling mill, and one trip hammer, within the limits of Rutland; and the meadows on this river are considerable. There is a large stream, called Long Meadow Brook, running through the town, in the westerly part thereof, on which are large meadows, and two corn mills and two saw mills within the bounds of this town. About half a mile east of the meetinghouse is a famous spring, the waters whereof soon divide; part runs to Merimack and part to Connecticut
<PB N="119" REF="026481_0118_0FD27DAB05B68A28"/>
River: And it is to be observed that all the waters of Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land run to these two great rivers. There are divers pond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the town; Muscopauge Pond, mentioned in the Indian deed; this is large, cover∣ing about 100 acres. In this pond two persons have been drowned. Evans's Pond, so called, of about 60 or 70 acres, in the southwesterly part of the town. Also, Gregory's or Long Pond, which is long and narrow, in the southwesterly quarter. These are all well stored with fish. Browning's Pond is large, this is situated in the southerly part, and is partly in Rutland, partly in Spencer; but the largest part is in Oakham. The growth of wood in Rutland is, oak of all sorts, chesnut, wal∣nut, pine of all sorts, ash, maple, birch, beach, poplar, elm, sassafras, hemlock, hackmatack, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the westerly and northwesterly part of the town is an extensive plain, a great part of which is still covered with pitch pine. This is rather light land. The people of Rutland are principally farmers, except a few traders in European, East and Westindia goods, the usual mechanicks, and those employed in the card making business, which is newly set up here: And they are a peaceable, happy, flourishing people. In this town, pot and pearl ash making is carried on very largely. When the census was taken about two years ago there were 1072 souls in the town.</P>
<P>Rutland is bounded, on the north by Hubbards∣ton; on the northeast, by Princeton; on the east, by Holden; on the south, by Paxton; on the west, by Oakham; and on the northwest, by Bar∣re.
<PB N="120" REF="026481_0119_0FD27DAC5691F058"/>
This town is situated about west from Boston, at the distance of 56 miles; and from the court∣house in Worcester, it is northwest, at the distance of fourteen miles.</P>

<HEAD>WESTBOROUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS town was taken from Marl∣borough, and lying the whole length of that town on the west side, thence was called Westborough when incorporated by act of the General Court on the 18th of November 1717. This before used to be called <HI>Chauncey</HI> Village at the west end of Marlborough. Here a Church was gathered on the 28th of October 1724, and on the same day the Rev. Ebenezer Parkman, their first Pastor, was ordained. Having obtained help of God, he con∣tinued to minister to the people in holy things un∣til within about six weeks of his death, which was on the 9th of December 1782, in the 80th year of his age, and 59th of his ministry. The town re∣mained destitute of a settled minister until Janua∣ry 14th, 1789, when the Rev. John Robinson was consecrated their second pastor. This town in∣creased so fast that on October 20th, 1744, the north part was made a separate parish; the par∣ticulars whereof will be related when we come to give an account of the town of Northborough.</P>
<P>This westerly part of Marlborough, being then a frontier, having no town between it and Brook∣field
<PB N="121" REF="026481_0120_0FD27DB12707D240"/>
on the west, about 40 miles distant, did not settle so fast: Nevertheless, towards the close of the seventeenth century several families had here seated themselves; and among others, Messrs. Thomas and Edmund Rice had families, and were fixed down but a little west of where the present meetinghouse in Westborough stands. On August 8th, 1704, as several persons were busy in spread∣ing flax, on a plain about eighty rods from the house of Mr. Thomas Rice (the first settler in Westbor∣ough, and several years representative of the town of Marlborough, in the General Court) and a num∣ber of boys with them, seven, some say ten, Indians suddenly rushed down a woody hill near by, and, knocking the least of the boys on the head (Nahor, about five years old, son of Mr. Edmund Rice, and the first English person ever buried in West∣borough) they seized two, Asher and Adonijah, sons of Mr. Thomas Rice, the oldest about ten, and the other about eight years of age, and two others, Silas and Timothy, sons of Mr. Edmund Rice abovenamed, of about nine and seven years of age, and carried them away to Canada. The persons who were spreading flax, escaped safely to the house. Asher, in about four years, returned, being redeemed by his father. This was effected by the kind mediation of the Rev. Mr. Lydius, then minister of Albany. And here, by the way, it should be noted, that when the old Indian Sa∣chem <HI>Ountassogo,</HI> the chief of the Cagnawagas, at the conference with Governor Belcher at Deerfield, made a visit to Boston, he stopped awhile in West∣borough;
<PB N="122" REF="026481_0121_0FD27DB4303B4E28"/>
the beforementioned Asher Rice saw and knew him to be one of the Indians who rushed down the hill, as above related, when he was taken by them. This Mr. Asher Rice married, had a family, and was living but a few years past in Spencer. His brother Adonijah, grew up in Canada, and married there, first a French, after∣wards a Dutch woman, and followed the business of husbandry on some land a little way off from <HI>Montreal,</HI> on the north side of the great river St. Lawrence, and had a good farm there, as we have been certified. The Indian name whereby he was called was <HI>Assaunaugo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton.</HI></P>
<P>As to the other two, Silas and Timothy, they mixed with the Indians; lost their mother tongue, had Indian wives, and children by them; and liv∣ed at <HI>Cagnawaga.</HI> The name by which Silas was distinguished among the Indians was <HI>Tookanowras.</HI></P>
<P>Timothy, the youngest, however, was much the most noticeable person. The accounts received from thence, have uniformly represented him as the third of the six chiefs of the <HI>Cagnawagas.</HI> This advancement was in consequence of the death of his foster father, or master, who had adopted him for a son, instead of a son which he, the former chief, had lost. "However,) said the Rev. Mr. Parkman, who had the best means of information) Timothy had much recommended himself to the Indians, by his own superior talents, his penetra∣tion, courage, strength, and warlike spirit, for which he was much celebrated, as was evident to me from conversation with the late Sachem Hen∣drick,
<PB N="123" REF="026481_0122_0FD27DB5551C5BA0"/>
and Mr. Kellogg, when they were in the Massachusetts; and his name among them the same as we had ever heard, viz. <HI>Oughtsorongoughton.</HI>"</P>
<P>The venerable Mr. Parkman, in a manuscript account of these persons found among his papers since his death, adds, with respect to this Timothy, in these words: "He himself, in process of time, came to see us. By the interposition of Col. Lyd∣ius, and the captive Tarbell, who was carried a∣way from Groton, a letter was sent me, bearing date July 23d, 1740, certifying that if one of their brethren here would go up to Albany, and be there at a time specified, they would meet him there; and that one of them, at least, would come hither to visit their friends in Newengland. This proposal was readily complied with, and it suc∣ceeded.</P>
<P>The chief abovesaid came, and the said Mr. Tarbell with him as interpreter and companion. They arrived here September 15th. They viewed the house where Mr. Rice dwelt, and the place from whence the children were captivated; of both which he retained a clear remembrance; as he did likewise of several elderly persons who were then living; though he had forgot our language. His Excellency Governor Belcher sent for them, who, accordingly, waited on him at Boston. They also visited Tarbell's relations at Groton; then returned to us in their way back to Albany and Canada. Col. Lydius, when at Boston, not long since, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account was written in 1760.</NOTE> said this Rice was the Chief who made the
<PB N="124" REF="026481_0123_0FD27DB6D4F48468"/>
speech to General Gage, which we had in our public prints, in behalf of the Cagnawagas, soon after the reduction of <HI>Montreal,</HI>" Thus far the Rev. Mr. Parkman.</P>
<P>To the above account I would add, there are at this present time, 1/93, a brother and sister of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bovenamed Silas and Timothy, living in North∣borough, in a very advanced age, though not born when their brethren were captivated, who have heard that these men were living in Canada, in the summer of 1790.</P>
<P>Let us proceed to some Geographical Descrip∣tion of Westborough. The town is pretty large, and very generally settled, containing, when the census was taken in 1791, houses 118, and inhab∣itants 934. It is about 34 miles from Boston, a little to the south of west, and 13 miles east from Worcester. The middle of the town is level, but the lands rise, at about a mile's distance from the meetinghouse into higher, especially to the east, south and west. The soil is in general good, the farms are large, and the inhabitants industrious and wealthy, as any one must naturally suppose from the appearance of their places and buildings. The growth of wood here is similar to that in the neighbouring towns: The higher lands bear plen∣ty of oak and chesnut, some walnut; in the swamps and low lands grow ash, birch and maple: Here also they have large and excellent cedar swamps, which afford the people much cedar for shingles and oth∣er important and necessary uses: There is, at this day, but little white pine, but considerable pitch
<PB N="125" REF="026481_0124_0FD27DB9A4E23AF0"/>
pine. There is very little broken poor land in the town; neither is it very rocky; but bears all kinds of grain in plenty; it is good for orchard∣ing, grass and pasturing: It is very well watered by small streams and rivulets, on which they have mills; and on these they have considerable bodies of good meadow land. The river Assabet, run∣ning through the northwest angle of the town, has upon its banks a very large body of very excellent meadow or interval.</P>
<P>Ponds there are several in the town, as Great Chauncy in the northeasterly part, into which a rivulet enters at the south end from swamps and low lands; this is a fine pond, and here is a plen∣ty of fish. A small stream issues from the north end of this pond and empties into Little Chauncy, which is in Northborough.</P>
<P>About a mile south of Great Chauncy, there is a small pond, near the road from Westborough to Boston, whence issues a small stream to the south, entering a large cedar swamp, and running through that, empties into a large pond called Cedar Swamp Pond, which is environed on the east, north and west, with said swamp; from this pond, on the south, there is an outlet which runs into Hopkin∣ton, and aids in forming Sudbury, or Concord South River. It is worthy of notice, that the wa∣ters in this town, though they take different routs, finally unite in Concord, by the confluence of the north and south river in that town. In the north∣westerly part of Westborough is situated Hobomo∣cho Pond, not large, encircled with a meadow,
<PB N="126" REF="026481_0125_0FD27EAFE77593E8"/>
bearing the same name, and from this there is an outlet into the River Assabet, abovementioned.</P>
<P>Westborough is bounded on the east, by South∣borough and Hopkinton; on the south, by Upton; on the west, by Grafton and Shrewsbury; and on the north, by Northborough.</P>

<HEAD>UXBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Uxbridge was taken from the ancient town of Mendon, and was incor∣porated by an act of the Legislature, on the 27th of June 1727, and then received its present name. It was the westerly part of that town. It was large at first, extending ten or twelve miles from north to south; but has since been curtailed, having the north part set off in 1772, and made a distinct town, by the name of Northbridge.</P>
<P>Uxbridge still remains a very considerable town in extent, and for the number of its inhabitants. When the census was taken in 1791, there were 180 dwelling houses, and 1310 inhabitants in the place.</P>
<P>The people took early care for the support of the gospel, and the institutions of Christianity a∣mong them; accordingly, soon after the incorpo∣ration of the town, viz. on the sixth of January 1731, a church of Christ was here gathered under
<PB N="127" REF="026481_0126_0FD27EB1EC5DE900"/>
the direction of the Rev. Joseph Dorr of Mendon: and on February third, 1731, the Rev. Nathan Webb, was invested with the pastoral office in the place. Mr. Webb continued the faithful minister of the town upwards of 41 years; being removed by death on the 14th of March 1772. The Rev. Hezekiah Chapman succeeded Mr. Webb in the work of the ministry in Uxbridge; whereunto he was solemnly separated January 27th, 1774; and from which he was dismissed April 5th, 1781. The Rev. Josiah Spalding, succeeded Mr. Chap∣man as minister of Uxbridge, being ordained on the 11th of September 1783: He continued with this people but about four years, being dismissed from his pastoral relation to them, October 23d, 1787. These two gentlemen were dismissed more on account of the peculiarity of their religious senti∣ments, than any thing beside. Mr. Spalding has since been installed at Worthington in the county of Hampshire. On the 17th of October 1792, the Rev. Samuel Judson was ordained Pastor, the fourth in succession, of the congregational society in Uxbridge.</P>
<P>In the town of Uxbridge there are a few fam∣ilies of the Anabaptist persuasion. And here also is a very considerable society, nearly one quarter of the inhabitants of the town, of the sect called Friends, who have a meetinghouse for the worship of God in their way, built with brick.</P>
<P>We will now give some Geographical Descrip∣tion of the town of Uxbridge.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="026481_0127_0FD27EB2EE399670"/>This town is situated at the southern extremity of the county, and is bounded on the south, by the line between this Commonwealth, and the state of Rhodeisland; on the west, by Douglass; on the north, by Northbridge; and on the east, by Men∣don.</P>
<P>Uxbridge is 42 miles from Boston, somewhat to the southwest, and is 18 miles from the courthouse in Worcester, to the southeast.</P>
<P>The land in the town is pretty level, for the space of about one mile round the meetinghouse, being a plain, and rather sandy and light; how∣ever, good for raising of grain of all sorts; then it rises to hills on all sides, but not very high, nor very rocky; these are moist and good for orchard∣ing, and for grazing, and for English grass: There is a good proportion of interval and meadow lands upon the rivers, which are in general very good. There are three rivers in this town, all of them unite in the south part; Blackstone, Mumford, and West River. Blackstone River has its source in Sutton; and was particularly described in the ac∣count of that town. This river comes from Sutton through Grafton and Northbridge, and enters Ux∣bridge at the north end of the town, and running through the town, near the middle, passes into Rhodeisland State: This is a large and fine river. Mumford River has its rise in Rocky Woods, so called, in Douglass, being increased by streams from Badluck Pond, and from Manchaug Pond, in Douglass, and by springs and rivulets, and runs an easterly course into Uxbridge, then turns and
<PB N="129" REF="026481_0128_0FD27EBA6E2FBEE8"/>
runs southeasterly within a few rods of Uxbridge meetinghouse, where there are several sorts of mills and water works, in excellent order, and where much business is well performed. This river con∣tinues its course, and joins Blackstone River about one mile southeast of the meetinghouse.</P>
<P>West River is not large, its main source is a pond in the northerly part of Upton, and running through a part of Northbridge, it passes through the easterly side of Uxbridge, and falls into Black∣stone River about two miles southeast from the meetinghouse. Besides these rivers, there are divers brooks and rivulets, by which this town is finely watered. There are also three small ponds in the town, covering ten or twelve acres of land each, and are called, Pout Pond, Mud Pond, and Shoelog Pond. Pout Pond is in the east part of the town, about one mile from the meetinghouse. Mud Pond is situated in the southeast part of the town, not far from Blackstone River, with which it holds a com∣munication when the water is high. Shoelog Pond is situated in the southwest part of the town, from whence issues a small stream, which runs into Gloucester, in the State of Rhodeisland. Not far from this pond an iron mine has been discovered, and wherein persons have wrought to very consid∣erable advantage. Upon the farm of Dr. Samuel Willard, in Uxbridge, there is a fine quarry of stone, of a greyish colour, easily split, and wrought into any shape for underpinning, door stones, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="026481_0129_0FD27EBBE879DCB8"/>The growth of wood and timber in this town is pretty much like that of other towns in general: Oak of various sorts, some chesnut, walnut, poplar and pine.</P>
<P>The people of Uxbridge subsist chiefly by the cultivation of the soil: They have, however, all the common sorts of mechanicks, and a few dealers in European, East and West India goods.</P>
<P>There is one road of considerable travel, from Connecticut, directly through this town to Men∣don, and so on to Boston.</P>
<P>This may be considered as a large, wealthy, flourishing place, and stands forward in the list of towns, according to the proportion which it pays to a State tax.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="town">
<HEAD>SOUTHBOROUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Southborough, was taken from the ancient town of Marlborough, and derived its name from the circumstance of its lying about south from that town. It was incorporated, by act of Court, July 6th, 1727. A few years past, a strip of land, belonging to Framingham, of about three hundred acres, and running up between Southborough and Hopkinton, was annexed to Southborough.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="026481_0130_0FD27EBD66F534A0"/>The church of Christ in this town, was embodied on the 24th of October 1730, and on the same day the Rev. Nathan Stone was ordained their first Pastor: He was a judicious, prudent, and faithful minister of Christ, and was continued serving God in the gospel of his Son, to the great satisfaction of his people, until May 31st, 1781, when he depart∣ed this life, in the 74th year of his age and 51st of his ministry. The people were destitute of a settled minister for the long space of ten years, even until June 1st, 1791, when the Rev. Samuel Sumner was solemnly separated unto the pastoral office over the church and flock of God in Southborough.</P>
<P>We shall proceed to give some Geographical Description of this town. It is situated on the east side of the county, and is bounded by Marl∣borough on the north, Framingham on the east, Hopkinton on the south, and Westborough and Northborough on the west: It is 29 miles from Boston, a little to the south of west; and 17 miles from Worcester courthouse, about east. It is not large in extent, but pretty well filled with people, who are generally good and wealthy farmers. They have about 120 dwelling houses, 150 families, and 840 inhabitants. The town is not level, nor yet very uneven; there are no extensive plains, and no very high hills; the soil is strong, good and rich, and productive, amply repaying for its cultivation. It is not very rocky, however, there is a sufficiency of stone, perhaps on every farm, whereby it is, or may be walled in. In the South part of the town there is a hill, which, from the steepness of its as∣cent,
<PB N="132" REF="026481_0131_0FD27EBEDD20AA40"/>
is called Breakneck Hill, over the steepest part runs a town road; it is rocky and rough, but cov∣ered with a large growth of young wood, and de∣scends to the north. In the northeast part is situ∣ated what is called Pine Hill, which was covered with pines and timber until the year 1787, when, by a hurricane, the wood was chiefly destroyed. On the west side of the town there is a steep hill over which the county road lies, but not distin∣guished by any particular name.</P>
<P>The town is well watered by streams and rivu∣lets. Stony Brook rises in the easterly part of Westborough, runs through Southborough in a course which in general is easterly; but not with∣out several great angles; for what is worthy of re∣mark, the road through the town to Boston crosses this stream three times within the space of four miles. This stream enters Framingham and there falls into Sudbury River. On this stream are two saw mills, in fine order, of profit to their owners, and benefit to the town. Upon the same brook are four corn mills. One in the westerly part of the town, nearest its source, and on the great road, can grind but about half the year, as raising a pond in the summer season would damage a large body of meadow land. But below this, at the distance of two or three miles, as the stream runs, stands another mill in good repair, and where much busi∣ness is done, not only for the benefit of this, but the neighbouring towns. About two miles further down this stream, are two well constructed corn mills, the property of Col. Thomas Nixon, which
<PB N="133" REF="026481_0132_0FD27EC35691E4A0"/>
grind all the year, except in a very dry season, as the waters of Angle Brook, and Broad Meadow Brook fall into this stream above these mills. On this Stony Brook, clothiers' works have lately been erected in the easterly part of the town where much business is well performed.</P>
<P>A second stream is called Angle Brook, from its winding course. One branch of this stream rises near the meetinghouse in Marlborough, and anoth∣er branch a little further south, and soon uniting enters Southborough, and there joining with Broad Meadow Brook, in about the distance of a mile, falls into Stony Brook, as abovementioned. There are many other streams less noticeable. But we must observe what is called Sudbury River, issues from Cedar Swamp Pond, in the southeasterly part of Westborough, and when it leaves that town, is the boundary between Southborough and Hopkin∣ton, on the south. The meadows on this river, in Southborough, are narrow, but produce large quan∣tities of good stock hay, being a mixture of meadow, and English grass. Those upon Stony and An∣gle Brooks are good, and yield most excellent bank hay. There is but one pond in this town, in the western part, small, covering perhaps six acres of ground. To this there is a small inlet, and an out∣let to the south; and all the waters in this town run southerly and easterly, and empty into Sudbu∣ry, or Concord River. Here are no pot or pearl-ash works.</P>
<P>The growth of wood is sufficient for the town, if prudently used, and consists of white, red and
<PB N="134" REF="026481_0133_0FD27EC6DBFCB410"/>
black oak, some walnut, and more chesnut: The low lands are all under cultivation. Upon the whole, this, though not large, its contents being but about 8350 acres, is a good town; and the people are industrious and wealthy, in general; and hospitable and peaceable.</P>

<HEAD>SHREWSBURY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1717, November 2d, a grant was made to certain persons, chiefly of Marlborough, who petitioned therefor, of all the lands lying between the original grant of Lancas∣ter on the north; Marlborough, on the east; Sut∣ton on the south; and Worcester on the west. Most of the first settlers were from Marlborough. The tract of land was very long (about fifteen miles north and south) but not very wide (from three and an half to four and five miles.) The whole was called, by the proprietors, Shrewsbury from the beginning.</P>
<P>In about ten years from the date of the grant, it was so stocked with inhabitants, as that the Gene∣ral Court incorporated it as a town, by an act which bears date December 19th, 1727, and gave it the name whereby it had all along been distin∣guished.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="026481_0134_0FD27EC80A534B98"/>The town so flourished and increased, as that in a little more than twenty years a second parish, in the northerly part, was formed, viz. on the 17th December 1742, which has since been made a dis∣tinct town.</P>
<P>The south part of this original grant which is now Shrewsbury, is about seven miles in length from north to south, and about three and an half or four miles in width; and it is bounded by Worcester on the west; by Boylston on the north; by Westborough and Northborough on the east; and by Grafton on the south. It is sit∣uated about six miles from Worcester courthouse, a little to the northeast, and from Boston 41 miles a little to the southwest. The post road from Boston to Worcester, and so on to Newyork, &amp;c. passes directly through the town; and the great road from Vermont, and from the upper part of Newhampshire, and northwestern part of the coun∣ty, unites with the post road about a mile and an half west of the meetinghouse. Besides which there is a road of considerable travel from the northward, directly through Shrewsbury, to Provi∣dence.</P>
<P>The ecclesiastical history of this place is but brief, and is as here follows:</P>
<P>On the fourth day of December 1723, the church of our Lord Jesus Christ was gathered here, and on the same day the Rev. Job Cushing was ordained their first Pastor. He continued in peace and love with his people, and faithfully serving the Lord in the work of the ministry almost 37 years; and
<PB N="136" REF="026481_0135_0FD27EC96017DDB8"/>
was suddenly cut off, by a fit of the apoplexy, August 6th, 1760, in the 67th year of his age. And on the 25th of June 1762, the Rev. Joseph Summer was solemnly invested with the pastoral office in this place; and who still continues to minister to them in holy things. There are a few Baptists in the south part of the town, but no church of that denomination.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to a Geographical Descrip∣tion of this town, I have thought that so remarka∣ble and sorrowful an occurrence as took place in Shrewsbury, in its infancy, ought to be recorded in this history. I shall give it in the words of the account published in the only Newspaper (I have been told) then printed in Newengland, if not on this side Philadelphia. It was a small half sheet printed by B. Green.</P>

<P>"An exact account of the awful burning of Capt. John Keyes's house, with five persons in it, at Shrewsbury, in the night between the 7th and 8th of this inst. taken from a letter of the Rev. Mr. Breck of Marlborough, and from the mouth of Mr. Ebenezer Bragg of the same, formerly of Ips∣wich, the only person of those who lodged in the house, who, by a distinguishing providence, escap∣ed the flames.</P>
<P>"Capt. Keyes was building an house about nine or ten feet off his old one. It was almost finished. And Mr. Bragg aforesaid, the carpenter, with his brother Abiel, of 17 years of age, and William Oaks of 18, his apprentices, were work∣ing
<PB N="137" REF="026481_0136_0FD27ECB22DC29F0"/>
about it. Capt. Keyes, with his wife and four daughters, lodged in the old one; and the three carpenters, with three sons of the Captain's, viz. Solomon of twenty, John of thirteen, and Steven of six years of age, lay in the new. On the Wednesday night, going to bed, they took a more than ordina∣ry care of the fire, being excited thereto by the saying of one, <HI>He would not have the house burnt for an hundred pounds</HI>; and the reply of another, <HI>He would not for two hundred.</HI> Upon which, they care∣fully raked away the chips lying near it, and stayed till the rest were almost burnt out; and then they went all six together into three beds in one of the chambers; and were very cheerly and merry at their going to bed, which was about ten of the clock.</P>
<P>"But about midnight Mr. Bragg was awaked with a notion of the house being on fire, and a multitude calling to quench it; with which he got up, saw nothing, heard no voice, but could hardly fetch any breath, through the stifling smoke; concluded the house was on fire, perceiv∣ed some body stirring, against whom he hit two or three times in the dark: And not being able to speak, or to breathe any longer, and striking his forehead against the chimney, he thought of the window and happily found it: When he gained it, he tarried a minute, holding it fast with one hand, and reaching out the other, in hopes of meet∣ing with some or other to save them, till the smoke and fire came so thick and scorching upon him, he could endure no longer; and hearing no noise in the chamber, only, as he thought, a faint groan or

two, he was forced to jump out, and, the window being small, head foremost; though he supposes, by God's good providence, he turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before he came to the ground. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. Bragg was just got up again, Capt.

But the flame immediately burst out of the windows, and the house was quickly all on a light fire. No noise was heard of the other five who perished; and it is very questionable, whether more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one of them moved out of their beds. The old house was also burnt, and almost every thing in it: But the people were saved, through the great goodness of God. But a most dreadful sight it was in the morning, to see the five bodies frying in the fire, among the timbers fallen down in the cellar, till towards the evening, when the few almost consumed fragments, without heads or limbs, were gathered, put into one coffin, and bu∣ried.

<P>The Capt. Keyes abovenamed, was afterwards the well known and much esteemed Major John Keyes, who died in Shrewsbury, not many years since, in a very advanced age.

<P><PB N="139" REF="026481_0138_0FD056E9C3F14700"/>Let us now proceed to describe the town of Shrewsbury. Much the greater part of this town is upon quite high land. Indeed it is one large and extensive hill, and the meetinghouse stands nearly upon the highest part of it: The land f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls but very little to the north: To the south, the de∣scent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, but gradual: To the east, as the great road runs, there is a descent towards North∣borough, for the space of two miles or more, nay, even some way into Northborough: To the west, there is half a mile of rocky plain, and then a pretty steep descent to a small plain, before you come to the head of Long Pond, and beyond that the land rise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediately, and there is quite a steep hill before you leave Shrewsbury, on the way to Worcester. The town is not very uneven considered altogether, but is pretty rocky. There is a very large and extensive prospect from the middle of the town, and all round the meeting∣house, east and west, north and south, and from some parts of the town seven meetinghouses can be dis∣cerned. The land, in general, is rather rough and hard, but the soil is strong, rich, and very produc∣tive when subdued. The higher lands are very good for orcharding, and fruit trees of all kinds, and for pasturage, and even for mowing; for the land is not dry, and it bears a dry season exceed∣ing well. It is not so well proportioned with til∣lage land; however, what they till is very produc∣tive, and richly repays the labour bestowed upon it. There is very little poor broken, waste land in the town. And it is richly stored with a fine
<PB N="140" REF="026481_0139_0FD056C40F45ED68"/>
young thrifty growth of the best of wood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fuel, such as oak of all kinds, walnut and chesnut, and the lower lands bear ash, birch, maple, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The town is pretty well supplied with w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, by various springs and rivulets, although there is not one large stream which runs through the town. The largest stream in the town is that which issues from Sewall's Pond, which is within the limits of Boylston, and running southerly a mile and a quarter, falls into Long Pond, on the road to Worcester, over which is the bridge at the head of said pond. This pond, called by the natives, Quinsigamond, but commonly <HI>Long Pond,</HI> is a beautiful piece of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ater, in the form of a crescent, nearly four miles in length, as it runs (though on a straight line but three miles and twenty four rods) and it is from 100 rods to nearly a mile in width, although in one place, it be not more than forty rods. This pond lies almost wholly within the bounds of Shrewsbury, not more than one acre falling within the limits of Worcester. It is, per∣haps, the largest and finest pond in the county. Indeed, it may very fitly be denominated a lake. Upon the top of the hill, on the west side of Shrews∣bury, it appears to travellers as a large river, or∣namented with woods on each side. It affords great plenty of fish, as pickerel, large perch, eels, shiners, breams, &amp;c. and the brooks which run into it, contain some trout. The water of this pond is in general deep; in some places it has been found ninety six feet deep. In this pond there are a numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of Islands of various sizes.
<PB N="141" REF="026481_0140_0FD056EB0A5D88B0"/>
The first, or uppermost, at the north end, is call∣ed Little Pine Island, has upon it a thicket of vines, and contains about a quarter of an acre. The second is Grass Island, covered with grass and willows, and which has been mowed in a dry sea∣son. The third is called Sherman's Island, and contains about one acre and an half, and has a growth of small timber and wood upon it, of dif∣ferent kinds. The fourth is called Bowman's Isl∣and, of about three acres, and is clothed with pine and other timber. The fifth is denominated Bar∣berry Island, from the considerable quantity of those berries which grow thereon; this contains about three acres. The sixth is another Grass Island, having upon it willows and waterbushes. The seventh is known by the name of Grape Island, of about the fourth of an acre, bears large quan∣tities of grapes. The eighth, commonly call∣ed Sharp Pine Island, of three quarters of an acre, is covered with divers sorts of wood. The ninth is known by the name of Ram Island, of two acres, covered with oak and chesnut. The tenth and last is a very large island, and generally called Strat∣ten's Island; this contains about 150 acres; a considerable part of which is under cultivation; and there are three families living thereon, having good farms: These are inhabitants of Shrewsbury. This island has oak, chesnut, walnut, and some pine thereon. There are two or three other places in the pond where land appears in a dry season, but at other times are covered with water. This is bounded north and west, by the Long or Great

Pond; southeast, by what is called Half Moon Pond; south, by Flint's Pond; east, by Round Pond, all which communicate with each other. From them runs a river, at the southeast, which passes into Grafton, whereon are a number of mills, and other water works. There is a small outlet from Long Pond, southerly, into Flint's Pond; and from Flint's Pond eastwardly, there is an out∣let into the river just mentioned. And what is truly noticeable is this, while the water, more gen∣erally, runs out of Long Pond into Flint's Pond, yet in the drier seasons of the year, the water runs out of Flint's Pond into Long Pond; for Flint's Pond is fed by springs and rivulets, which keep it always full. There is a pond called Jordan Pond, lying about half a mile eastward of the great or Long Pond, and about midway of the length of it, and from this there is an outlet, by which wa∣ters some parts of the year empty into Long Pond. On the stream which runs from Sewall's Pond in∣to Quinsigamond or Long Pond, there is a grist mill. Besides this, there is a stream which rises in the northwest part of the town, on which there are two saw mills: This runs southerly, and empties into Long Pond on the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> side There is also another stream, which rises from springs a little south of the meetinghouse, on which are mills, and running northeasterly, comes to the side of the great road, affording a fine wa∣tering place to travellers and teamsters, and there it is joined by two other rivulets, and taking a

<P>In this town there are both Pot and Pearl Ash works, and where large quantities are made in a year.</P>
<P>The people in Shrewsbury are generally farm∣ers, though they have a due proportion of traders in European and Westindia goods, and mechan∣icks of various sorts. On the great road the build∣ings are large and handsome; and the town makes a pretty appearance; and the number of inhabit∣ants, when the census was taken, was 963.</P>

Like people in general, at that day, who came to America for the sake of enjoying the sac∣red rights of conscience, they were fond of sup∣porting the publick institutions of religion, and took early care to settle a minister: Accordingly, here a church was gathered, and the Rev. Andrew Gardner, (who had been the first minister at Wor∣cester) was installed their first minister on the 15th of May, 1728, a little before the incorporation of the town. Mr. Gardner continued not four years in the ministry here; being dismissed the 22d of February, 1732. After his dismission, he moved up nigh to Connecticut River, in Newhampshire State, where he died, but a few years since, in a very advanced age.</P>
<P>The second minister of Lunenburg, was the Rev. David Stearns, who was ordained April 18th, 1733; and died of a peripneumony, March 9th, 1761, in the 52d year of his age, and 28th of his
<PB N="145" REF="026481_0144_0FD056EE08B2E208"/>
ministry. As he lived greatly beloved, he died no less lamented.</P>
<P>He was succeeded, for a few days, by the Rev. Samuel Payson, who was separated unto the sacred work of the gospel ministry September 8th, 1762; and died February 14th, 1763, of an atrophy.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by the Rev. Zabdiel Adams, who was solemnly consecrated unto the service of God, in the gospel of his Son, on the 5th of Sep∣tember, 1764, and who is still living.</P>
<P>During the administration of these ministers there have been baptized, of infants and adults, down to the present time, no less than 2400 per∣sons: And the church here is comparatively large, containing very little short of two hundred communicants.</P>
<P>The growth and increase of Lunenburg was rapid and great; for in the year 1764, the whole town of Fitchburg was taken from it. It is now bounded by Townsend, in the county of Middle∣sex, on the north; by Shirley, in the same county, on the east; by Leominster, on the south; and by Fitchburg, on the west. It is about 44 miles dis∣tant from Boston, over Charles River bridge, to the northwest; and 25 miles north by east, from the courthouse in Worcester.</P>
<P>The soil of this town is sweet, and as productive as is usually found in so northern a situation. For though the land be in general high, yet by reason of its cohesive texture, and having a clayey stratum within a few feet of its surface, it retains moisture sufficient for vegetation through the whole
<PB N="146" REF="026481_0145_0FD056C888AD0220"/>
summer, unless in seasons of severe drought. The soil is friendly to the growing of wheat, rye, In∣dian corn, oats, &amp;c. The wheat raised on the hills is of the first quality. Many parts of it bear hemp and flax luxuriantly. The mowing and pasture lands are equal to what are generally found in the county. It is a place famed for cyder; as their high lands are excellent for orcharding: But the canker worms beginning to infest the trees, threat∣en them with a scarcity of this kind of fruit.</P>
<P>The natural growth of wood and timber in the town is oak, white, red, black and gray. Of wal∣nut there is considerable plenty; and of chesnut a large proportion. In the low lands there is ash, also rock and white maple, black, white and yel∣low birch, some beach and other hard wood. Nevertheless, as there is very little waste land, and the people are numerous, fuel will in a few years be scarce and dear. White and yellow pines were plenty in the infancy of the plantation; but from the great and long consumption of both, a scarcity is sensibly felt. Although the surface of the town is uneven, and may be denominated hilly; yet it is not rocky; there being, take the town in gener∣al, not more than stones sufficient to wall in the several inclosures.</P>
<P>From the elevated situation of the land, and its proximity to those lofty mountains, the Grand Monadinock in Newhampshire, and the Watchu∣sett in this county, being about twelve miles from the latter, and twenty five from the former, the air is keen and piercing in winter, pleasant in summer,
<PB N="147" REF="026481_0146_0FD056EF8BCC3BB0"/>
and through the whole year very salubrious. Here are little or no stagnant waters; but few meadows; and but few brooks and streams. In consequence of which they are in a great degree exempted from fogs, from deleterious vapours and exhala∣tions; and having the air ventilated by high winds, the inhabitants are remarkably healthy, and free from those disorders of the put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>escent kind which sweep off many in other places; and they double their numbers in less than 25 years. This occa∣sions large emigrations, and as the farms are small in general, being on an average not more than 75 or 80 acres; this, together with the fecundity of the people, produces a large number of pau∣pers, with which the town is burdened more so, per∣haps, than any other town in the county; creating an expense beyond that of supporting the gospel. However, the greater part of the people live com∣fortably, and a few may be said to be opulent. The people are industrious and economical, gen∣erous, hospitable to strangers, and much given to convivial entertainments.</P>
<P>The town labours under other disadvantages be∣sides those already mentioned. For though the directest route from the northerly part of Connecti∣cut River, and from the State of Vermont, to Bos∣ton, be through Lunenburg, yet from difficulty in the road for a short space of way, and the influ∣ence of certain men, the travel passes to the north or south of it; whereby the people are left desti∣tute of all the benefit arising from travellers de∣positing their money among them.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="026481_0147_0FD056CA82220540"/>Besides this, they labour under the want of suf∣ficient water to carry their corn and saw mills. Though there are several small streams on which there are mills, yet they are generally inoperative a considerable part of the year. Mulpus, so call∣ed, is but a small brook, which, originating in the west part of the town, runs east about twelve miles, and then empties itself into the River Nashaway, in the north part of Shirley. This deficiency of water obliges some of the inhabitants to carry their grain to other towns to be ground, a certain part of the year. But while we speak of this singular deficiency of water, we are constrained to mention a Mr. Wetherbee, who, having built both corn and saw mills, in the southwest part of the town, on what is called part of the north branch of Nasha∣way River, and finding, by several years experi∣ence, that the water was not sufficient to carry his mills, except in the spring of the year, or in rainy seasons, was at great expense to dig a canal, in length about a mile, to convey water from a larger branch of the same river, (which comes from Westminster) into his mill pond; which enables him in a wet season, to grind for all; and, in a dry one, for most of his numerous customers. An instance of so spirited and laudable enterprize is worthy to be transmitted to posterity. This man, it is thought, makes the best wheat flour within the compass of Newengland; and has grain brought to his mill from remote places.</P>
<P>In the southwest, south, and southeast parts of the town, are three ponds, which, retaining their
<PB N="149" REF="026481_0148_0FD056F118FA5D08"/>
Indian names, are called Onkeshewalom, Massa∣pog, and Catatoonamug; The first of which is nearly two miles and an half; the second, two miles, and the last not more than one mile in cir∣cumference. From these ponds, the neighbouring anglers draw from time to time, pickerel, perch, roach, bream, and other fresh water fish, not only so as to give themselves a delicious repast, but sometimes a quantity to sell to their townsmen.</P>
<P>Mines, minerals or fossils, there are none in the town; nor furnaces, or forge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The blacksmiths bring their iron from a distance. The nailing busi∣ness has been carried on here to advantage.</P>
<P>In giving an account of Lunenburg, we ought not to omit the mention of Edward Hartwell, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who early came into the place, and possessing ad∣vantages above people in general, was promoted in the town and county; he was a deacon of the church; and, passing different grades of office, was Major of a regiment of militia; a justice of the peace; a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas; and a representative of the town, with few interruptions, for a great number of years; in which station he continued until a very advanced period of his life; and, finally, he died in the 97th year of his age, as full of piety as of days. This gentleman was much engaged in the Indian wars, and was very helpful to the neighbouring towns in scouring the woods, and driving off the savages. In Lunenburg, indeed, he had little work of this kind to perform. For, though the Indians afore∣time inhabited this territory, as is evident by ves∣tiges
<PB N="150" REF="026481_0149_0FD056CB8AA353E0"/>
thereof remaining to this day, yet they never much annoyed the English; they did, indeed, so put them in fear, that between the years 1740 and 1750, the inhabitants frequently went armed to the house of God on the sabbath. There were also a few troops stationed in this town at garrisoned houses, to which the people retired at night for safety. In the summer of the year 1749, the In∣dians came into the northwest limits of the town, and killed two soldiers, Jennings and Blodget, who were stationed there, and carried Mr. John Fitch and his family into captivity, who all re∣turned in safety, after enduring incredible hard∣ships and fatigues, except Mrs. Fitch who sicken∣ed and died in Canada.</P>
<P>Lunenburg is almost wholly settled: The town contains but 14000 acres of land; and on this space, when the late census was taken, there were 192 houses, and nearly 1300 souls.</P>
<P>I shall close the account of Lunenburg in the words of the Rev. Mr. Adams, in a letter to the author. "The town is much more remarka∣ble for the health than the wealth of its inhabitants. Almost destitute of travel through it, the people live an independent, but solitary life. In their ec∣clesiastical affairs they have been remarkably peace∣able. They dismissed Mr. Gardner; but because he was unworthy. Two of their ministers died in rapid succession. None of them were so long in the ministry, nor so old, as myself. Almost thirty years have I lived among them in profound peace."</P>

<HEAD>DUDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>THE grant of this township was orig∣inally made to the Hon. Messrs. Paul and Wil∣liam Dudley, of Roxbury, while yet in the posses∣sion of the aborigines, the tribe known at this day, by the name of the Pegan Tribe. It was to com∣prise all the lands between Woodstock, or the col∣ony line, south; Oxford, north; the grant to Medfield, now Sturbridge, west; and Newsher∣burne, now Douglass, east. This tract of land was incorporated by act of the Legislature, on the 2d of February, 1731, and the name of <HI>Dudley</HI> was given to it, as a token of respect to that family, who were principal proprietors of the soil, and great benefactors to the first settlers in their in∣fancy. Since the incorporation of Dudley, an ad∣dition was made to it by a strip of land taken from Oxford, and annexed thereto. The present extent of this town is nearly east and west about nine miles; north and south about four miles. It is now bounded, north, by Oxford, and Charlton; east, by Douglass; south, by the state line, or Woodstock; and west, by Sturbridge.</P>
<P>Dudley has but one religious society, viz. con∣gregational, although there may be about thirty families of various other persuasions, in the place. The church of Christ here was founded in the year 1732, and the Rev. Perley Howe was solemnly in∣vested
<PB N="152" REF="026481_0151_0FD056CD09164758"/>
with the sacerdotal offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the year 1735. He was dismissed from his particular relation to the church and flock of God in Dudley in 1743. The Rev. Mr. Howe was afterwards in∣stalled at Killingsley in Connecticut. He was succeeded in the pastoral office at Dudley by the Rev. Charles Gleason, who was ordained October 31st, 1744. He continued the worthy, faithful and beloved minister of the town until his death, which took place May 7th, 1790. The Rev. Joshua Johnson, who had been for a short time minister of the north parish in Woodstock, was installed Pastor of the church and congregation in Dudley, as successor to Mr. Gleason, December 1st, 1790.</P>
<P>The congregational meetinghouse, which is the only one in this town, was erected in the year 1734. It stands on an hill, which commands a south prospect of extensive farms even to the dis∣tance of twelve miles. Four acres of land on the summit of this hill were given to the town for pub∣lick uses, by the Pegan tribe of Indians, on condi∣tion that all of their tribe, who should ever inhabit the town, should have the right to convenient seats in the meetinghouse on days of public worship. This tribe still exists, to the number of ten or twelve, and hold about 200 acres of excellent land near the middle of the town; but their whole interest is constantly taken care of by a com∣mittee of the General Court.</P>
<P>The general face of this town is hilly, but not mountainous. It is richly and beautifully inter∣spersed with hills, valleys, and streams of water.
<PB N="153" REF="026481_0152_0FD056F40A12A0E8"/>
The hills are of easy ascent, passable with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eams, and most of them suitable and good for cultiva∣tion. The soil in general is good and fertile, pro∣ducing all sorts of grain and fruit, and grass in plen∣ty; and the land affords a sufficiency of stones for fencing in the farms. There is one hill in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot very high, famous for yielding great quantities of most beautiful building stones. They are taken out in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> edged slabs, of any man∣ageable length or width, with one natural face, smoother than can be wrought; they are capable of being split, cut, or hammered into any shape or thickness. The colour of these stones is a very fine light gray; and they are much used for jambs, hearths, mantle pieces, under pinnings, for steps and door stones, and cellar walls.</P>
<P>The forests, are principally of oak, chesnut, and walnut, yellow pine, and some white pine.</P>
<P>This town abounds with ponds, streams, rivers and springs. There are four large ponds, well stored with all the usual sorts of fish: But there is one especially in the east part of the town, called by the Indians Chaubunagungamaug: This is five miles in length, and one in breadth. Through the west part of the town, from northwest to the south∣east, runs the rapid river Quinebaug, of about twen∣ty yards in width, coming from Sturbridge, and passing down on the east of Woodstock, Pomfret, &amp;c. to Norwich. Through the east part of the town, from north to south, runs <HI>French</HI> or Stony River. This is about fifteen yards in width. On this are fine interval and meadow lands, which be∣ing
<PB N="154" REF="026481_0153_0FD056CE89A8DAC8"/>
in spring and autumn overflowed, become very excellent mowing and arable ground. This river comes from Oxford, and falls into Quinebaug ten miles below this town.</P>
<P>This is a large and flourishing town, the people subsist chiefly by farming, except the usual me∣chanicks, and a few traders; and when the enumer∣ation of the Commonwealth was made, there were 160 houses and 1114 inhabitants in the place. Dudley is situated upon the State line, sixty miles from Boston, lying about southwest, and from Worcester it is eighteen miles, nearly south.</P>

<HEAD>HARVARD.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Harvard is situated on the eastern side of the county, thirty five miles from Boston, a little to the north of west, and is twenty three miles from the courthouse in Wor∣cester, to the northeast. It is bounded by Groton on the north; by Lyttleton on the northeast; by Boxborough on the east; by Stow on the south∣east; by Bolton on the south; and on the west by the river Nashaway, which separates it from Lan∣caster, and Shirley. Harvard was not an original grant, but taken from Lancaster, Stow and Groton, principally from the two former. From the cir∣cumstance
<PB N="155" REF="026481_0154_0FD056F5880DCC50"/>
of its being made up of the corners of other towns, it was rather irregular in its shape; but before the incorporation of Boxborough, which took off the easterly angle of this town, it was nearly equal to seven miles square: It is now more than six. The bill for the incorporation of this tract of land passed the Legislature, June 29th, 1732, when it was called Harvard, to bear up the name of that excellent and worthy minister of Charlestown the Rev. John Harvard, who died in 1638, who laid the foundation of Harvard Univer∣sity in Cambridge, bequeathing thereto 779<HI>l.</HI> 17<HI>s.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> when by a special order of court, it took the name of Harvard College. At the time of the in∣corporation of the town of Harvard, it consisted of about 50 families.</P>
<P>The town of Harvard is very hilly and uneven; the land is rough and hard to subdue, but the soil is warm and strong, rich and fertile. It produces good crops of grain of all kinds. Such broken land, however, is better adapted to the raising of wheat and rye, than Indian corn. As the town∣ship is rocky, the farmers are induced to appropri∣ate a large proportion of their land to grass and pasturage. The principal articles carried hence to market, are beef, pork, butter, and cheese. The high lands are particularly fertile in chesnut trees, whose fruit yields the owners no inconsiderable profit. And as the lands are excellent for orch∣arding, many farmers pay particular attention to raising all kinds of fruit, which they have in plen∣ty, and of the best quality.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="026481_0155_0FD056D0097CF868"/>There are about 1000 acres of what is called interval land in this town; though perhaps half of it may more properly be styled meadow.</P>
<P>Although there are several hills in this place, yet there are but three which have names, or mer∣it particular notice. The first we shall mention is called <HI>Pin Hill,</HI> from its remarkable form which is pyramidical. The perpendicular height of this hill, from the brook which runs at the foot of it, is judged to be two hundred feet. In the bowels of this hill are contained vast quantities of blue or slate stone. It leases to the stone cutters in this and a neighbouring town for 6<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> per annum. The stones taken hence, are not so easily wrought, as some of a similar kind: But on this account, however, they are more valuable for jambs and hearths, as they in the same proportion, do the more resist the heat of fire. These stones are chiefly used, for grave and tomb stones; and are carried to a great distance.</P>
<P>Those called Bear Hill, and Oak Hill, are not, strictly speaking, distinct hills, but links only in a chain of hills, which begins in the west part of Lyttleton, and extends southwesterly through Harvard, as far as the centre of Bolton. Oak Hill, however, which rises in the easterly part of the town, is the summit of this range, and affords a prospect singularly diversified and extensive. The land upon these hills is mostly exceeding good.</P>
<P>The general growth of wood in Harvard, is the same as in other towns of similar soils. Chesnut, oak of all kinds, and walnut, constitute the princi∣pal
<PB N="157" REF="026481_0156_0FD056F74C6F2E88"/>
part on the high lands. They have some white pine, and in the northerly part, considerable pitch pine. In the low lands they have much elm, some butternut and button wood, birch, ash, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Harvard is like other hilly, rocky places, not dry, but moist land, and well watered indeed by numerous springs and rivulets, running about a∣mong the hills, and which cause them to rejoice on every side.</P>
<P>Nashaway, or Lancaster River, flows along the confines of Harvard upwards of six miles. The depth of the water, when the bed of the river is full, is about twelve feet; and about six feet at low water. This river, an humble imitator of the Nile, overflows its banks at certain seasons, and greatly fertilizes the bordering lands.</P>
<P><HI>Still River</HI> originates in some marshes and quag∣mires in the westerly part of Bolton, and is joined by a brook running from the interval lands in Lancaster, near the river. These two streams unite in Harvard, and compose what is called <HI>Still River,</HI> or long pond, or lake, which passes in a silent and almost imperceptible manner, for three miles, (one mile or more of which is in Harvard,) and then by a small outlet, empties itself into the river Nashaway.</P>
<P>There are two or three ponds of some notoriety in this town. The largest of these begins but a little southwesterly of the meetinghouse, and very nigh the seat of Col. Bromfield, and extends away southerly. It is called <HI>Bear Hill Pond,</HI> as it lies upon the westerly side of that hill. Its figure is
<PB N="158" REF="026481_0157_0FD056D18A087758"/>
oblong: Its circumference more than three miles. In this pond are two small islands of about three acres each. The greatest depth of this pond is not more than twenty feet.</P>
<P>At the north west angle of the town, is situated what is commonly called <HI>Hell Pond,</HI> from its amazing depth, being ninety five feet in one place, by measure; and between eighty and ninety feet in general, all over the pond, and immediately as you launch from shore. This pond is nearly cir∣cular. Its diameter is about three hundred yards. Fish were never caught here until within a few years, when pike and perch were put therein, which have since multiplied exceedingly. Near this is a small pond, with which the former is supposed to maintain a subterraneous communication. There is also another, in the north part of the town, call∣ed <HI>Robbins</HI>'s <HI>Pond;</HI> but this is not remarkable for size or depth. About an hundred rods from Hell Pond, is a spring, known by the name of <HI>Cold Spring.</HI> The waters hereof are always pure and cold, and never freeze. The head of this spring is two or three yards broad. Bear Hill Pond emits a stream from its north side, which almost winds around Pin Hill; and which, within the limits of Harvard, supplies with water, four grist mills, one saw mill, one clothiers' works, one forge, and one trip hammer. These are all in the north part of the town. In the south part, there are two grist mills, and one saw mill, furnished with water from two streams which issue from the east side of the chain of hills above described.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="026481_0158_0FD056F88B72E0B0"/>It is worthy of particular mention, that the eastern side of the above hills is uniformly steep, while the opposite side has a gentle and gradual declivity.</P>
<P>At the foot of Oak Hill, on the eastern side, there is a mine which may be justly deemed a cu∣riosity. Early in the year 1783, when a rage for the treasures, thought to be hid in the bowels of the earth, was prevalent in the country, it was thought by some persons, from the colour of the earth in this place, and from the working of the mineral rods, that silver ore might be obtained not far beneath the surface of the ground. According∣ly some gentlemen in this town and its vicinity, (twenty five in number) formed themselves into a mine company for the purpose of descrying those hidden treasures, and enriching themselves there∣with. Under the conduct of certain men, Messrs. Ives and Peck, they began their operations in July following. These were continued, though with frequent interruptions, until sometime in the year 1789. During this time, they had, with some dif∣ficulty, digged through a considerable quantity of condensed gravel, until they came to a solid rock: Into this they penetrated more than forty feet. But, either from the unskilfulness of the mineral∣ists, or for want of perseverance in their employ∣ers, the shining ore has not yet been discovered. The company, after expending one thousand one hundred dollars in the process, is amically dissolved. The sides of this cavity are almost rectilinear. It is about six feet high, and half as wide. The ex∣cavation
<PB N="160" REF="026481_0159_0FD056D352AB5F88"/>
was made, partly by heating the rock to a great degree, and then cooling it suddenly with water; but the greater portion of it was effected with powder. Pieces of the earth, which they dug before they entered the rock, had the appearance of yellow lead, and were considerably sulphure∣ous. This cavern now rests a deserted monument of successless toils. Its mouth opens to the east; and the rising sun, to a person in the other ex∣tremity, renders the prospect highly delightful.</P>
<P>The town of Harvard is large and numerous, here are 200 dwelling houses, which, like those of most country towns in this State, are scattered over the place without much order; and consist of some good and more ordinary buildings. The inhabit∣ants are 1400; these are chiefly farmers, who are frugal and industrious, and some are become wealthy. They have two or three traders in foreign goods, and all the usual sorts of mechanicks.</P>
<P>This town discovers great solicitude for the good education of its children. The inhabitants divide themselves into eight districts: In each there is a neat and commodious schoolhouse; and six of them, in the winter season, are furnished with latin grammar instructors; the other two with English grammar masters. In the summer, the very young children are taught by approved females; while they who are more advanced, are handling the plough and the distaff. Here a library company has lately been formed. They have at present, a∣bout one hundred volumes in their library. No doubt it will soon be considerably augmented.
<PB N="161" REF="026481_0160_0FD056FA0A708410"/>
There is also here a social club established, con∣sisting of twelve of the principal inhabitants, who have monthly meetings. In them they endeavour to acquire information on the common, as well as on the most important affairs agitated in the world.</P>
<P>The principles and modes of religion in Har∣vard, are uncommonly numerous. Within the limits of the town dwell congregationalists, ana∣baptists, presbyterians, episcopalians, universal∣ists and shakers. Until after the commencement of the late war, they were all of the denomination first-mentioned; and this still comprises five sevenths of the souls in the town.</P>
<P>The congregational church in Harvard was im∣bodied by an ecclesiastical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouncil, October 10th, 1738, and the Rev. John Seccombe was, the same day, ordained their first Pastor. He continued un∣til September 7th, 1757 (almost twenty four years in the sacred office here) when he was dismissed from his pastoral relation to this people. Mr. Seccombe was afterwards employed many years in the work of the ministry in the province of Nova∣scotia, where he died in 1792, aged eighty four years. Mr. Seccombe was succeeded in the work of the ministry at Harvard, by the Rev. Joseph Wheeler, who was consecrated thereunto Decem∣ber 12th, 1759. In a few years Mr. Wheeler was afflicted with bodily infirmities, which peculiarly affected his voice, in consequence whereof he so∣licited a dismission from that sacred employment, which accordingly took place by advice and un∣der the direction of a mutual council, July 28th,
<PB N="162" REF="026481_0161_0FD056D4893DEBC8"/>
1768. Mr. Wheeler was soon after, and for several years employed by the town as their rep∣resentative in the General Court. He was al∣so a worthy Magistrate, and Register of Probate in the county of Worcester, from 1776, until Februa∣ry 10th, 1793, when he died in the fifty eighth year of his age. On <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovember 1st, 1769, the Rev. Daniel Johnson was ordained to the pastoral office in Harvard. He was suffered to continue but a little time, being removed by death on the 23d of September 1777. After Mr. Johnson's decease, the Rev. Ebenezer Grosvenor was installed their Pastor on the 19th of June 1782. He had been before Pastor of the first church in Scituate almost seventeen years. Mr. Grosvenor was not suffered to continue long at Harvard, being translated by death to a better world May 28th, 1788, in the forty ninth year of his age.</P>
<P>The town was destitute of a settled minister near four years, when the Rev. William Emerson was separated unto that sacred office, May 23d, 1792, the fifth Pastor in succession. In this church of Harvard 1805 persons have been bap∣tized, and 540 have been admitted to church com∣munion.</P>
<P>In the year 1776 an anabaptist society began to collect in Harvard. It was established in 1778, when Mr. Isaiah Parker, who is also a physician, was ordained their teacher, and still continues. The number of this society has since been some∣what increased by persons from the skirts of the adjacent towns. This society have a pretty meet∣inghouse
<PB N="163" REF="026481_0162_0FD056FB89422DA0"/>
in the southwest part of the town, near to Still River, in a pleasant conspicuous place. The episcopalians, presbyterians, and universalists are but few, and have no distinct and separate so∣cieties.</P>
<P>Sometime in the year 1780, the leaders of that sect of religionists, called shakers, came into this town; and as there are few of them indeed in any other part of the county, it is highly fitting and proper to give a full account of them in this place.</P>
<P>They fixed themselves down in a corner of Har∣vard, where superstition and enthusiasm had con∣siderably flourished under the auspices of one Mr. Ireland. A part of this man's followers kindled at this new torch of fanaticism, while the majority of these old fashioned enthusiasts at the sight of the shakers' distraction became more rational and so∣ber. Since their beginning in Harvard, they have been continually making reforms in their senti∣ments, modes of worship and manners. In a re∣ligious and political view they have greatly me∣liorated. From gross indecencies in their rites and behaviour, they are become moderate and civil. Formerly they were indolent and trouble∣some in society; now they are the most industri∣ous and peaceful members of the community. The number of shakers in Harvard is about one hundred and fifty. These are divided into three orders; or as they call them, <HI>gifts.</HI> The first of these orders consists principally of the youngest and fairest of them who are gathered. These are under the most rigid rules possible. They are
<PB N="164" REF="026481_0163_0FD056D60C25F088"/>
never to see any of the world's people, nor con∣verse with them of the lower orders. All their ac∣tions, words and steps, are narrowly inspected by their spiritual teacher, who almost persuades them to believe that he is conversant with their thoughts. They of the first order are privileged with his o∣ral addresses; to the others he usually communi∣cates his monitions by a messenger.</P>
<P>The second order is composed of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m who are gathered, but who are more advanced in years, and otherwise less vigorous and alert in labour and in devotion.</P>
<P>The lowest order are they who live about in families.</P>
<P>Extreme simplicity in dress and manners charac∣terizes this singular religious sect. They are neat in their apparel and furniture. The houses which they have erected in this town, are large and com∣modious, and approach to something like elegance. Their floors and stairs are all covered to prevent making a noise. They imitate the Moravians apparently more than any other denomination; particularly in their modes of government and sub∣ordination. They affect to be wholly under the dominion of the Spirit; and to crucify even the innocent desires of the flesh, insomuch that they neither marry nor are given in marriage. So strict are they in their laws of abstinence from women, that the two sexes are not permitted to live in the same house, nor even to enter the same door. Instances of inchastity, especially among the governed, seldom or ever occur. The orders
<PB N="165" REF="026481_0164_0FD056FD07B22760"/>
are under the most complete subjection to their leaders. The utmost precision and regularity are observed in their eating, sleeping and working. Hence they are making quite rapid proficiency in the lower kinds of the mechanick arts; and such is their agricultural skill and perseverance, that they have reduced the most rugged and indoma∣ble part of Harvard to a state resembling that of a garden.</P>
<P>We conclude this account with only remarking, that it is not a little strange, that the leaders of this deluded sect, who certainly can claim no pre∣eminence above ordinary men in point of capacity and improvement, should thus keep bound in ser∣vitude so great a number of their brethren in the very heart of Newengland. But it will be strang∣er still, if in such an era as this, the majority of the shakers, who now pant for liberty, should long continue in shackles of bondage to their el∣ders.</P>
<P>Having said what may be thought quite suffi∣cient upon the ecclesiastical and religious state of Harvard, we shall close our account of this place, with saying it is a large, prosperous and wealthy town; and notwithstanding the diversity of sects, the people are peaceable and happy.</P>

<HEAD>GRAFTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is that tract of land of four miles square, which was reserved for the Indians when the town of Sutton was granted to the Eng∣lish. It was called by the Indians Hassanamisco, and known by that name only until April 18th, 1735, when it was incorporated by an act of the Legislature, and called Grafton. Since its in∣corporation one half a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> land was taken from Shrewsbury and added to Grafton, on the north, and about half a mile of Sutton, on the south, was annexed to it; so that Grafton is now five miles in length, from north to south, and four in width from east to west. This town is bound∣ed, on the north, by Shrewsbury; on the east, by Westborough and Upton; on the south, by Upton and Sutton; and on the west, by Sutton.</P>
<P>At first there were divers Indian families here: As they diminished, the white people became proprietors of the soil, by purchase; and a grant from the General Court, upon these conditions, however, that they should always provide preach∣ing and schooling, and seats in the meetinghouse, for the remaining Indians. And as the people hold the lands of the original four miles square, on such conditions, they must all of whatever per∣suasion, be equally bound to contribute to the sup∣port of a gospel minister in the place. The Gene∣ral
<PB N="167" REF="026481_0166_0FD04FE18C488FD0"/>
Court has from the beginning, appointed a committee of three, called the trustees of the In∣dians' interest; their business is to take care of their property, both real and personal, and dispose of the same to the best advantage, for the support and maintenance of the Indians. This committee, at present, have little to do in the execution of their trust, as the lands have by length of time, and various concurring circumstances, chiefly pass∣ed into the hands of the white people. There are indeed several farms in the possession of the heirs of the Indians, married to negroes; but it is said there is not one male in the town at this day, who is all of Indian extract or blood.</P>
<P>The Indians very soon decreased in this place, and the whites became possessors and occupiers of the soil; and so early as the 28th of December 1731, a Christian congregational church was im∣bodied here, and on the next day, the Rev. Solo∣mon Prentice was ordained their first Pastor. He became what was called in that day, a zealous newlight, or more properly, a raving enthusiast. He was dismissed from his pastoral relation to Grafton, July 8th. 1747, and became an itinerant preacher. He was succeeded in the work of the gospel ministry at Grafton by the Rev. Aaron Hutchinson, who was solemnly consecrated here∣unto on the 6th of June 1750. Mr. Hutchinson continued upwards of twenty two years as Pastor of Grafton, and was dismissed from his relation to that church and people, November 18th, 1772. He has since generally been employed in preach∣ing
<PB N="168" REF="026481_0167_0FD056D91FF47B20"/>
the gospel, and is still living. The Rev. Dan∣iel Grosvenor succeeded Mr. Hutchinson as Pastor of the church and flock of God in Grafton, to which office he was separated by the laying on of the hands of the presbytery, on the 19th of Octo∣ber 1774. By reason of great bodily infirmities of long continuance, he requested a dismission from his particular relation to the Church and people of Grafton, to which they acceded with great reluctance, and which took place January 1st, 1788. No minister is since settled in the place. Mr. Grosvenor's health, being in a good measure restored, he is most constantly employed in preaching in neighbouring vacant parishes.</P>
<P>Some years ago there was an anabaptist socie∣ty and church established in Grafton, and they had a regular minister of publick education settled with them; but now there is neither minister nor church of that denomination in the town, and very few anabaptist families.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to some Geographical De∣scription of Grafton. It is a most excellent town∣ship of land. The face of the town is hilly and uneven, and in general rocky; but the soil is moist and strong, rich and very productive: It is good for Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, barley, and flax: The lands are naturally warm and not sub∣ject to frosts; and as they are high and rocky, they are well adapted to orcharding and all kinds of fruit trees. There are three noticeable hills in the town The first to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mentioned, is called Chesnut Hill, as abounding in that sort of wood.
<PB N="169" REF="026481_0168_0FD057000BF7A8E0"/>
This is situated but a little east of the meeting∣house, and is the highest land in the town, hiding Grafton from Westborough: This is not large; the land is moist and good. On the easterly side of the town lies George Hill, two miles and an half in length. It took its name from one George Misco, an Indian who dwelt upon it. This is a hill of most excellent land; and there are a num∣ber of very fine farms upon it. A third is de∣nominated Brigham Hill, from a number of that name who have lived upon it: This lies in the westerly part of the town, is high, about two miles in length; has upon it several excellent and large farms, though some parts of it are rough, broken lands.</P>
<P>The general growth of wood is walnut, oak of all kinds, chesnut, some pitch pine, butternut, but∣ton wood, black and white ash, and birch. There is some pine plain land in the town near the rivers.</P>
<P>Blackstone River, from the north parish in Sut∣ton, enters Grafton in the southwesterly part of the town; this is then become a large and beauti∣ful river, and runs about three miles in the south∣erly part of Grafton, and then passes into Upton. Little River, or more properly Quinsigamond, be∣ing the outlet from the pond of that name, runs along on the west side of the town, within about half a mile of the meetinghouse, and between that and Brigham Hill; and about one mile and an half south from the meetinghouse joins Blackstone Riv∣er. On these rivers, before and after the junction, there are conside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble bodies of good meadow,
<PB N="170" REF="026481_0169_0FD056DB4ACB61C8"/>
and rich interval lands. The River Assabet, which runs northeast, and empties into Merrimack, has its source in Grafton, about one mile and an half northeast from the meetinghouse: This passes through the northwest angle of Westborough, into Northborough, &amp;c. Besides these, on the west side of George Hill, runs George Brook, which rises in the northerly part of Grafton; this passes to the south. On this stream there are large and good meadows. There is no pond in the town. Upon the several rivers and streams abovementioned, there are four grist mills, several saw mills, three trip hammers, and one fulling mill. The town abounds with rivulets and springs of water.</P>
<P>The people subsist mainly by the cultivation of the soil, and they are amply recompensed for all their labour. They have one or two traders in foreign goods, and the usual tradesmen and me∣chanicks; and here pot ash making is carried on. Grafton, though not a large tract of land, yet be∣ing a rich and good soil, is pretty well filled with people, and they are become wealthy. There were nearly 900 inhabitants when the census was taken about two years ago. This town reaps con∣siderable advantage from the travel through it. A road much used, leading from Connecticut to Bos∣ton, passes through this town; as also the post road from Worcester to Providence. Grafton is forty miles from Boston, to the southwest: It is thirty four miles from Providence, to the northwest, and eight from the courthouse in Worcester, a little to the south of east.</P>

<HEAD>UPTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS town was not an original grant, but taken from several other towns, part from M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndon on the south, part from Sutton on the west, and part from Hopkinton on the east. It is bounded by Westborough on the north. The post road from Worcester to Providence passes through this place, about a mile southwest of the meetinghouse. It was incorporated by an act of the Legislature on the 14th of June, 1735, and con∣tains upwards of 13000 acres of land; and when the census was taken there were 126 dwelling houses, about 150 families, and about 900 inhab∣itants in the place.</P>
<P>As no church records are to be found of what took place in the earlier days of this town, so the precise time when the congregational church was formed here cannot be ascertained; but it was soon after the incorporation of the town, when the Rev. Thomas Weld was ordained their first pas∣tor. This gentleman continued in the ministry among this people but a few years, being dismissed from his pastoral relation to them; and was af∣terwards installed at a parish in Middleborough, in the county of Plymouth. From hence also he was removed, and soon after entered the army, in the last French war, in the capacity of chaplain, where he died. He was succeeded at Upton, in
<PB N="172" REF="026481_0171_0FD056DCCB1DEE98"/>
the work of the gospel ministry, by the Rev. Eli∣sha Fish, who was solemnly separated unto this sacred employment on the 5th of June, 1751, and who, having obtained help of God, still continues, faithfully serving the Lord in the gospel of his Son. There is a considerable society of anabaptists in this town, and has been for many years. For early in the year 1751 they ordained one Mr. Abraham Bloss for their teaching elder, who continued there but a few years before he left them; after which the society and church dissolved. However, a few in∣dividuals remained, who called themselves ana∣baptists, who rarely had any meetings for religious worship among themselves for several years, but occasionally attended upon teachers of that de∣nomination in other towns. But early in the year 1787 there arose a considerable number, very suddenly, who called themselves anabaptists, and still remain as a distinct society, to whom one el∣der Ingalls first ministered; and since they have the occasional instruction of Mr. Simeon Snow who has been ordained at large. However, there is not, so far as I can learn, any church so gather∣ed among them as to celebrate the Lord's supper by themselves.</P>
<P>In the town of Upton there are also a number of the people called friends or quakers, but no dis∣tinct society of that denomination is formed there.</P>
<P>We shall proceed to some Topographical De∣scription of Upton. Some parts of the town are very rough and uneven, others more level. The soil is generally strong, rich and good, favourable
<PB N="173" REF="026481_0172_0FD057030BA59528"/>
for orcharding, and fruit of most kinds, and for pas∣turage and grass; and there are a number of rivu∣lets passing about in the valleys, between the hills, whereby it is pretty well furnished with water. There is one river, which has its source in Graf∣ton, and passing-through the west part of Upton, in a southerly course, known by the name of <HI>West River</HI>: This is emptied into Blackstone Riv∣er in the lower part of Uxbridge. On this river there are some good meadows; also mills. A little north of the meetinghouse, there is a small pond fed by rivulets and springs, from the south end of which there issues a fine stream, on which there is a corn mill within a few rods of the meet∣inghouse, whereby the inhabitants are greatly ac∣commodated and benefited; this falls into West River. The growth of wood is similar to that of other towns of like kinds of soil. The high lands have plenty of oak of the several sorts; considera∣ble quantity of walnut; some chesnut: The low lands have birch, maple, elm, alder, &amp;c. There is much pitch pine in the place, and also consider∣able white pine remaining even at this day. This town is situated about thirty eight miles from Bos∣ton, to the southwest; and fifteen miles from Worcester courthouse, about southeast; and is bounded on the north by Westborough; on the east, by Hopkinton and Milford; on the south, by Mendon; and on the west, by Northbridge and Grafton.</P>

<HEAD>HARDWICK.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the sum of 20<HI>l.</HI> Newengland cur∣rency, <HI>John Magus</HI> and <HI>Lawrence Nassowanno,</HI> two n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Indians, so early as in the year 1686, De∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 27th, gave and signed a deed of a large tract of land to Messrs. Joshua Lamb, Nathaniel Page, Andrew Gardner, Benjamin Gamblin, Ben∣jamin Tucker, John Curtiss, Richard Draper, and Samuel Ruggles, of Roxbury. This tract of land included what is now Hardwick. In consequence of the abovementioned deed, the heirs of those gentlemen petitioned the General Court, and ob∣tained a grant of this township on the 17th of June, 1732. It was called Lambstown, from the first named proprietor, until it was incorporated and made a town by an act of the Legislature, which bears date January 10th, 1738, when the name of <HI>Hardwick</HI> was given to it.</P>
<P>This town contains, according to its original grant, about six miles square, notwithstanding a part on the easterly side of the place was set off more than forty years ago, to help in making up the town of Newbraintree. Hardwick is now bounded on the north, by Petersham and Barre; on the east, by Barre, Newbraintree and <HI>Ware Riv∣er;</HI> on the south, by Ware River, and the town of Ware, in the county of Hampshire; and on the west, by Greenwich in that county.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="026481_0174_0FD0570524DF50D8"/>After the location of this grant a number of set∣tlers immediately entered upon the lands, and oth∣ers followed so rapidly, as that they soon had the gos∣pel preached among them, and as early as November 17th, 1736, a little more than four years from the date of the grant, the church of Christ was gather∣ed, and the same day the Rev. David White was ordained their first Pastor. He died January 6th, 1784, in the 74th year of his age, and the 48th of his ministry. He was succeeded in the sacred of∣fice by the Rev. Thomas Holt, who was separated unto that high and holy calling on the 25th of June, 1789, after a vacancy of five years and al∣most six months.</P>
<P>The people of Hardwick, considering their num∣ber, are remarkably united in their sentiments re∣specting religion. There are a few antipedobap∣tists in the place; as also a few professed univer∣salists.</P>
<P>We proceed to some Topographical Description of Hardwick. The town is of a good form and shape, being nearly square. The face of the town is rather rough, hilly and uneven: Although there are no very great and remarkable hills. The soil is, in general, deep, loamy, and very fertile. The lands produce all kinds of grain in sufficient plenty for the inhabitants; but they are best adap∣ted to grass and pasturage: Here vast quantities of butter and cheese are made, and most excellent beef fatted for the market. All kinds of fruit trees flourish here.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="026481_0175_0FD056DFCBEE2F18"/>The principal growth of wood is oak of all sorts, chesnut and walnut; but in the north west∣ern part of the town, there is some white and pitch pine. The land is generally rocky and moist; and it is finely watered in every part by springs, streams and rivulets, which run about in the val∣leys among the hills; but there are no streams of note or distinction in the town, although they fur∣nish water for all sorts of water works; and there are within the town, five corn mills, four saw mills, and two clothiers' works, where much business is performed to the great advantage of the people.</P>
<P>Ware River, which is large, runs on the east and south of the town, and is the boundary between this town and Newbraintree, and also between Hardwick and the town of Ware. The inter∣val on this river, in the eastern part of the town, may contain perhaps as much as two hundred a∣cres of very excellent mowing land. On this riv∣er a furnace was erected several years ago, and where much hard ware has been manufactured; but at present there is no business done thereat.</P>
<P>There are two considerable ponds in the town; one called <HI>Pottapoug,</HI> in the northerly part, is about two miles in length, and nearly one third of a mile in breadth; this is stored with fish. It has an in∣let which comes from Petersham; its outlet passes through the northwestern part of Hardwick, and falls into Chicabee River. The other, called <HI>Muddy Pond,</HI> is about one mile in length, and a∣bout half a mile in width in the southerly part.
<PB N="177" REF="026481_0176_0FD0570608B4D608"/>
It has plenty of good fish. It has a small inlet; its outlet is into Ware River.</P>
<P>The roads of travel are from Boston, either through Worcester or Rutland, to Hardwick, and so on to Northampton. Another road from the southwest, with one from the southeast, form a junction near the centre of the town, and then passing northward, through Petersham into the States of Newhampshire and Vermont. Hardwick is situated a little southwest from Boston, distant from the State house seventy two miles, and from the courthouse in Worcester twenty five miles, a little to the northwest. It is a very large, flourish∣ing, wealthy town, and contained, when the census was taken, 245 houses and 1725 inhabitants; and was the fifth town in the county in the proportion it paid to a State tax in 1790.</P>

<HEAD>BOLTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS town was taken from the an∣cient town of Lancaster; and was incorporated on the 24th of June, 1738, by act of the Legislature, when it received its present name. The tract of land was large at first: In the year 1784, the dis∣trict of Berlin, to the south, was set off from it: Still it is large enough to make a very respectable figure among the towns in the county. It contain∣ed,
<PB N="178" REF="026481_0177_0FD056E15C40A698"/>
when the continental census was taken, 125 houses, and 861 inhabitants. It is bounded by Lancaster on the west; by Harvard, on the north; by Stow, in the county of Middlesex, on the east; by Marlborough on the southeast; and by Berlin, on the south. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s distant from Boston about thirty four miles nearly west; and from the court∣house in Worcester, it is about eighteen miles, ly∣ing to the northeast.</P>
<P>The Ecclesiastical History of Bolton is as fol∣lows. The church of Christ here was gathered on the 4th of November, 1741; on which day the Rev. Thomas Goss was ordained their first pastor, who continued until January 17th, 1780, when he died in the sixty third year of his age, and thirty ninth of his ministry. He was succeeded, a short space of time, by the Rev. John Walley, who had been before for several years minister of a parish in Ipswich. Mr. Walley was dismissed from Bol∣ton, not long before his death. He was succeeded in the work of the gospel ministry in this place, by the Rev. Phineas Wright, who was solemnly sepa∣rated hereunto October 26th, 1785, and who still lives. The people are peaceable and happy, pros∣perous and flourishing.</P>
<P>In Bolton, and the district of Berlin, there is a society of friends, or quakers, consisting of a large number of mostly wealthy families; their house of worship stands within the limits of Bolton, near to Berlin line.</P>
<P>We shall proceed to give some Geographical Description of Bolton. The town in general is
<PB N="179" REF="026481_0178_0FD0570789DB48F0"/>
good land, not level, nor yet has it any very high hills. The highest lands in the town are rich and moist; excellent for orcharding and pasture land. It is not very rocky, however, there are stones suf∣ficient to wall in all their farms. The people raise rye, wheat, Indian corn, barley, oats, flax, &amp;c. &amp;c. upon their lands, in such plenty as richly to repay their labour in the cultivation thereof. A∣bout half a mile from the centre of the town, to the west, begins the great hill, known by the name of Wattoquottock Hill, which extends southwesterly into Berlin. This long, large hill, is not very high; it is in general very good land, and there are div∣ers fine farms upon it. The great road from Lancaster to Boston passes over the north end of this hill, upon its declivity, where it is very moist, consisting of clay and loam, sensibly felt by trav∣ellers in the wet seasons of the year. On the wes∣terly side of this hill, about halfway from its foot to the summit, is a cavity opening to the south∣west, parallel with the main course of the hill, near the upper end of which is a pool, or small pond of water, known by the name of Welch Pond. This pond is of a circular form about twenty feet in depth, and occupies the space of a∣bout one acre on its surface. It is supposed to have diminished about one half, both in depth and cir∣cumference within forty years past. People now mow considerable grass, where they went with boats and canoes half a century ago. On the southeasterly side of this hill, and nearly opposite to W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Pond, issue a number of rivulets, which
<PB N="180" REF="026481_0179_0FD056E2CA1FA4F0"/>
soon unite in the low lands, and form a considera∣ble brook, taking a southeasterly course, till it falls into Assabet River, in the northerly part of Marlborough. This brook has water sufficient to carry two mills, in the wet seasons of the year, at the distance of less than one mile from the hill. There is a glade of most excellent meadow on each side of this stream, its whole length, with but few small interruptions, by hard land. The higher parts of these meadows, next the hill, are known by the name of Wattoquottock Meadows. At a small distance from the northeasterly foot of Wattoquottock, begins another large hill, with a gradual ascent, which extends northeasterly through Harvard into the boundaries of Lyttleton, in the county of Middlesex. By some, this is call∣ed Bear Hill, by others Oak-Hill. This hill has been thought to contain mines and minerals, and has, consequently, for a number of years engaged the attention of a respectable society of mineseek∣ers; but their expectations have far exceeded their gains: For though its bowels have been explored with much painful labour, and sanguine hope, yet the mountain has not even to this day brought forth a mouse. At the intersection, between this last mentioned hill and Wattoquottock, is a nar∣row bar of hard land, about fifteen rods in width; and on each side of this bar, is a small piece of low, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nken, boggy ground, in which arise several springs, soon forming a rivulet each way. That on the northwestly side runs a northerly course, a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> continual increase of
<PB N="181" REF="026481_0180_0FD0570909A52978"/>
waters, and empties into <HI>Still River,</HI> so called, within the boundaries of Lancaster. The rivulet on the southeasterly side runs an easterly course; the waters of which being augmented by small ad∣ditions, become sufficient to carry mills, where much business is done, at the distance of two miles from their source, except in the summer months, and they are emptied into the river Assabet, about two miles southeast from Stow meetinghouse; previous to which, however, the road to Boston crosses this stream three times. On this brook are several bodies of meadow, but not equal in good∣ness to those beforementioned. In the northeaster∣ly part of Bolton, about two miles and an half from the centre of the town, is situated the large and ex∣tensive hill, called Rattle Snake Hill, belonging to the heirs of the late Gen. John Whetcomb. In the south side of this hill is a body of limestone; and here are annually made about one hundred and fifty hogsheads of the very best of lime. In the easterly part of the town is a large hill, known by the name of Long Hill. It lies close on the south side of, and runs parallel with the great road, about one mile and an half, to Stow line, with a gradual ascent to the south of about half a mile to its summit. There are two small ponds, of a circular form, at the distance of about eighty rods from each other, in the easterly part of the town, supposed to cover, one about forty, and the other about thirty acres of ground. The largest of these lies near the west end of Long Hill, in sight of the great road and known by the name of
<PB N="182" REF="026481_0181_0FD056E449D695D0"/>
West's Pond, from a person of that name formerly living on its shore. In the northwest angle of Bol∣ton, mainly, is situated a large body of almost stag∣nant water, and therefore called Still River, but might be more properly denominated a lake, or very long pond. It is various in its width and depth. It begins within the boundaries of Lan∣caster, in the great intervals (about twenty rods east of the great bridge over the Nashaway, after the junction of its two branches) and proceeds in a circular course, upwards of three miles, across the northwest corner of Bolton, into Harvard, from the north end of which there is a very small outlet in∣to the river Nashaway. On the south side of this lake, and between this and the river Nashaway, is a very large body of most excellent interval land, part of which is within the limits of Bolton, used for tillage, mowing and pasturing: And which is often laid several feet under water by spring and fall floods, presenting the appearance of a small sea.</P>
<P>Various are the conjectures of people respecting Still River, Lake, or Long Pond, above mentioned. Some suppose the bed of the south branch of Nash∣away once was here, and that by some great freshet it was cut off above, formed a new channel, and joined the north branch the sooner, where the junction now is. Be this as it may, it is certain these branches have shifted their beds, in various places, and of considerable lengths, in the revolu∣tion of ages. There are several rivulets fall into this lake on its easterly side; but there is no in∣let at its upper end, exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

directly out of the ground; and the great proba∣bility is, that a stream, which begins in Bolton, feeds this Lake by a subterraneous passage; for while this stream is constant, brisk and lively, for half a mile, coming to a spot of pine, sandy land, it disappears, and no water is discernible for near two miles. There is a small inlet into this lake on the eastern part of Lancaster intervals, in wet sea∣sons, but in the summer no water runs in this, and yet the lake appears no way to be affected thereby.</P>
<P>Let us leave this lake, and finish our Descrip∣tion of Bolton.</P>
<P>There are two pot ash works in this place, and one of pearl ash. Here are two famous brickyards where above two hundred thousands of bricks are annual∣ly made. The town is very well wooded. On the high lands there is plenty of walnut, chesnut, and oak of all sorts: And here vast numbers of barrels and hogsheads are manufactured yearly; and great quantities of hoops are carried to market. In the low lands there is much maple, but little ash, some birch. There are some plains covered with pitch pine, very little white pine.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this is a town of rich, strong and good land, and the people are increasing in number wealth and reputation. They are now building a large elegant meetinghouse, upon the modern construction, with a steeple to it, to which Messrs. Joshua and James Richardson, formerly of Boston, have generously contributed 100<HI>l.</HI> and bought their pews, as others, at ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>due, but upon

The underpinning of this meeting∣house is very beautiful, and equal to any in the county, if not in the whole State. It is a white and free stone, easily split into any size, and was discovered just when wanted.</P>

<HEAD>STURBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is styled in the act for erecting the county of Worcester, "The land lately grant∣ed to several petitioners of Medfield," and many of the first settlers here were from the town of Med∣field, and hence the place was called Newmedfield, until its incorporation, which was, by an act of Court, on the 24th of June, 1738, when it received the name Sturbridge.</P>
<P>This town is large in its dimensions, containing by actual survey, about 28929 acres. It is situat∣ed in the southwest corner of the county, and is divided from Woodstock and Union, on the south, in the state of Connecticut, by the state line; and bounded west, on Holland and Brimfield, in the county of Hampshire; on the north, by Brook∣field; and on the east, by Charlton and Dudley. The grant of this tract was made in the year 1729, in the month of August, but it was thought scarce∣ly
<PB N="185" REF="026481_0184_0FD0570CB65FF3D0"/>
habitable by reason of its broken rough state; and the soil, for the most part, requiring hard and great labour to render it productive; but the first settlers being a robust, resolute, sober and indus∣trious set of men, were determined to get an hon∣est living, by "the sweat of their faces," and, through the blessing of God, they soon converted this wilderness into a fruitful field. The original proprietors built a house for the worship of God, which was raised on the 20th and 21st days of June, 1733, and on the 3d of September following it was consecrated by the Rev. Joseph Baxter of Medfield, who preached from Isaiah lxiii, and 5th. From that time the place increased fast in the number of good and industrious people, who very quickly obtained to live comfortably; and like others of that age, early sought for a teacher of piety and morality. On the 29th of September, 1736, the Rev. Caleb Rice was ordained to the pastoral office over the church and flock of God in the place. He was a pastor after God's heart; sound in faith; a good preacher, endued with ex∣cellent ministerial gifts, and very exemplary in life, as well as social and benevolent in his deport∣ment. He lived in great harmony with his peo∣ple, in the fore part of his ministry: But about the year 1747, a number of the brethren and in∣habitants, conceiving they had received <HI>new light,</HI> different from what was common among their neighbours, separated from him, which rendered his work more arduous, and his life uncomforta∣ble. From separatists they became anabaptists:
<PB N="186" REF="026481_0185_0FD056E74BDDF6C0"/>
But it pleased the Great Head of the church to re∣move Mr. Rice from his labours, by death, on the second of September, 1759, whose praise was then through all the churches, and his memory is still dear to many. He was succeeded in the work of the gospel ministry, in the congregational church and society in Sturbridge, by the Rev. Joshua Paine, who was separated hereunto on the 17th of June, 1761, and still continues the faithful and beloved pastor thereof. The people here have surprisingly flourished and increased; for there are now about 1800 souls in the place. The con∣gregational church is large, consisting of about 150 members of both sexes. On the 29th and 30th days of June, 1785, they raised a large new meetinghouse, which is elegant and well finished; in which the first sermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Paine on January 7th, 1786, from first of Kings, viii. 27.</P>
<P>There is in the town a very respectable society of anabaptists, comprising about one fifth part of the inhabitants. These also have built them late∣ly a handsome meetinghouse. As great peace and harmony subsist between the two societies, as can well be expected under such circumstances: Differ∣ence of sentiments, as to modes and rites of religion, scarcely injures good neighbourhood; nor does it prevent their mixing in families, or friendly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial circles.</P>
<P>The inhabitants at present are industrious and frugal, charitable, and given to hospitality. The great precepts of the Christian religion, moral vir∣tue,
<PB N="187" REF="026481_0186_0FD04FE30C1385B0"/>
and the instruction of their youth, they make their study and care. They live in peace and love.</P>
<P>However hilly, rough and uneven the town was at first, yet, by industry and frugality, the people are become wealthy, subsisting chiefly by the cul∣tivation of the earth. By hard labour the soil is become fruitful. It is good for orcharding and grazing. Much butter and cheese are made here, especially the former, which has obtained high credit in the markets. The land is pretty good for grain. The growth of wood is similar to that of the towns in the vicinity, oak of all sorts, walnut, chesnut, pine in considerable plenty, especially in its earlier days; ash, beech, birch, maple, elm, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The town is in general well watered by springs, brooks, rivers and ponds. The River Quinebaug, which has its source in Brimfield, runs through this town near the centre, from west to east. On this there are large bodies of good interval, and valuable meadow lands. There are valuable ponds in the town, well stored with the usual sorts of fresh water fish.</P>
<P>Near one of these ponds, called Lead Mine Pond, a number of adventurers from Europe, some years past, dug deep for ore. A considerable quantity of which they carried with them to Eng∣land; but they have never returned to their pursuit.</P>
<P>Sturbridge is situated at the southwest angle of the county, on the state line, about twenty miles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the courthouse in Worcester; and it is sixty five miles from Boston, and considerably to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est.</P>

<HEAD>HOLDEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Holden was taken whol∣ly from the town of Worcester, being included in their original grants; and was the northwesterly part thereof.</P>
<P>It was incorporated on the 9th of January, 1740, when the name of Holden was given to it to perpet∣uate the name and deeds of the Hon. Samuel Hol∣den, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the directors of the Bank of Eng∣land; and of his lady and their amiable daugh∣ters, who had been great and generous benefac∣tors to the literary and religious interests of this country.</P>
<P>This worthy, benevolent man, transmitted to Newengland for charitable purposes, in books and bills of exchange, to the amount of 4847<HI>l.</HI> Neweng∣land currency. After his decease, Mrs. Holden and daughters sent over in value, 5585<HI>l.</HI> for the same noble and pious uses. With part of this latter sum <HI>Holden Chapel,</HI> in the University of Cam∣bridge, in Massachusetts, was erected in the year 1745. There are nineteen volumes, chiefly octa∣vos, in the hands of the Rev. Mr. Avery, given by Mrs. Holden and her daughters, to the minis∣ter of Holden, and his successors. This town was said to be laid out six miles square, but it consider∣ably exceeds that: From east to west it is about seven miles across: From the south point at Lei∣cester
<PB N="189" REF="026481_0188_0FD057288FDE83E8"/>
it is ten miles. It is bounded northerly, on Princeton and Sterling; easterly, on Worces∣ter and Boylston; southerly, on Worcester, Lei∣cester and Paxton, and westerly on Rutland and Paxton. We shall next present the reader with the Ecclesiastical History of Holden.</P>
<P>The church of Christ in this place was formed on the 22d of December, 1742, and on the same day the Rev. Joseph Davis was ordained their first pastor. He was dismissed from his pastoral rela∣tion to that people October 18th, 1772. Since that time he has been employed in preaching the gospel in various places; and on Wednesday the 2d day of January, 1793, he preached a special lecture to the people of Holden, as on that day half a century, from the imbodying the church and his ordin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on, expired.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The discourse was printed.</NOTE> Mr. Davis was succeed∣ed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> office at Holden, by the Rev. Jo∣seph Avery, who was publickly separated thereun∣to December 21st, 1774, and still continues in the ministry there.</P>
<P>We go on to a Geographical Description of the town of Holden. The soil of this town is some∣what various, yet in general of a loamy kind: The land in the outskirts of the town is the most springy and natural to grass. The general pro∣duce is rye, Indian corn, spring wheat and oats. Some farms produce good barley. Flax is raised with various success; when there is a failure of a crop, it is generally owing to other causes than the nature of the soil. Though the town is rather hilly and uneven, yet not very much so. Such
<PB N="190" REF="026481_0189_0FD04FF08C7E0750"/>
land is generally good for fruit; and, according∣ly, here are very large and valuable orchards in∣deed, but they are chiefly at a considerable dis∣tance from the centre of the town; the middle not being so fruitful, and more exposed to destructive frosts. There is a brickyard two miles and an half northeast of the meetinghouse, where are made annually about sixty thousands of bricks. The clay is very strong and good. There are two pot∣ash works about three miles east of the meetinghouse, one of them lately erected. The growth of wood in Holden is mainly chesnut and oak of all kinds. In former years there was a great quantity of ex∣cellent white pine timber, but the most of it has been cut off. There still remains, chiefly in the northerly part of the town, considerable yellow pine. There are other kinds of wood in various parts of the town. Some walnut, hemlock, horn∣beam, white maple, ash, and some valuable rock∣maple.</P>
<P>At the northwest part of the town there is a Pond called Quinepoxet, the greater part of which is in Princeton: A narrow fordable strait of wa∣ter issues from this into a lesser pond, perhaps fif∣ty rods in length; from this there is an outlet in∣to a second pond; from this second an outlet into a third; and from the third, into a fourth pond. These lesser ponds are in Holden; and from them proceeds a river called Quinepoxet, which holds an easterly course, and passes out of Holden into Boylston, where, quite on the west side of that town, it joins Still River which comes from the foot
<PB N="191" REF="026481_0190_0FD0572A08AE9090"/>
of Watchusett Hill, and from thence takes the name of the south branch of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> River Nashaway-Just below the abovementioned ponds in Holden, and on this River Quinepoxet, stands a fine saw mill. There is another pond about two miles and three quarters northeast of the centre of the town, called Lily Pond, which has neither inlet nor out∣let. There is a fine stream coming from the west and southwest parts of the town, part of which is derived from Asnebumskit Pond in Paxton, and crossing the main road leading to Rutland, one mile and an half west of the meetinghouse, joins Quinepoxet River about that distance north of it. On this stream are three saw mills and two grist mills. Another stream, which has its r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se mainly, a mile and upwards south of the centre of the town, takes a circuitous course, crosses the great road about two miles east of the meetinghouse, and falls into Quinepoxet about two miles northeast of said house. It was formerly called Cedar Brook. On this are two saw, and two grist mills. On a branch which enters it, and about two miles south∣east of the middle of the town, stands another saw mill. In the south part of the town rises a stream which holds a southeasterly course, and passes into Worcester, called Turkey Brook. On this there is a saw mill, and also a grist mill. There are no extensive intervals in Holden; but yet, in several parts of the town, there are farms whose value is much enhanced by the meadows and pieces of interval which lie on the river and streams mentioned above.</P>

<HEAD>LEOMINSTER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS town was taken from Lancaster, and was part of what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as called Lancaster new grant. It was incorporated on the 23d of June, 1740.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="026481_0192_0FD0572B891A7990"/>The Ecclesiastical History of Leominster is as follows. The church here was imbodied on the 14th of September, 1743: And on the same day the Rev. John Rogers was ordained their pastor. He was a sensible, worthy man, and used his nat∣ural right to examine, think and believe, for him∣self. And what he thought to be the truth as it is in Jesus, that he preached to his people; always appearing to act uprightly and conscientiously. However, a number of the church and people, ap∣prehending Mr. Rogers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doctrines con∣trary to the gospel, called in a larg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> council for advice in July 1757, consisting of fifteen churches. The council judged the brethren had reasons for dissatisfaction, but advised them to attend on Mr. Rogers's ministry for three months, and if he did not retract his errors, as they called them, in that time, then they advised the church to dismiss him; which they accordingly did, and shut him out of the meetinghouse. Upon this Mr. Rogers preach∣ed to such as were disposed to attend on his minis∣try, in his own house. At length Mr. Rogers sued the town for his salary: And after a long contest in the law, the dispute was compromised in this manner, viz. Mr. Rogers relinquished all claims upon the town as their minister; the town to pay to Mr. Rogers whatever sums of money his adher∣ents had been obliged to pay towards supplying the pulpit after he had been shut out of it; and, finally, that all who wished to have Mr. Rogers for their minister, should be made a poll parish; about a fifth part of the town were accordingly
<PB N="194" REF="026481_0193_0FD04FF38AAE5448"/>
made a distinct, but poll parish, by an act of the Legislature; after this settlement of their unhappy controversy, the church and town proceeded to the choice of a minister, and on the 22d of December, 1762, the Rev. Francis Gardner was ordained their second pastor; in whose ministerial labours the people have been very happy for more than thirty years already; and during this period they have been peaceable and prosperous. And when the town, a few years since, erected a large and elegant new meetinghouse, Mr. Rogers's adherents con∣tributed their full proportion to the building of it. The Rev. Mr. Rogers, having obtained help of God, continued to preach and administer special ordinances to the people of his parish until the year 1788, when, finding his age and bodily in∣firmities so great, he wished to be excused from the sacred labours, to which his people consented, and generously paid him three years salary in advance: Whereupon, by an act of the Legislature, this poll parish was dissolved, and the whole town now form but one church and congregation under the ministry of the Rev. Mr. Gardner.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Rogers lived but a little while after he ceased from his publick labours. He de∣parted this life October, 1789, in the 47th year of his ministry.</P>
<P>Let it now be observed, there was no way to avoid giving this particular detail, and yet mention the two religious societies which for a time subsisted in Leominster. Our plan, truth, and impartial justice, required the mention of them. And
<PB N="195" REF="026481_0194_0FD0572D094F4D00"/>
nothing derogatory of any one has been said. Nay, the design has been to pay tribute due to worthy characters, to Mr. Rogers and Mr. Gardner, and to the people, who once were two parties and so∣cieties. The majority of the church and town dis∣missed Mr. Rogers, that the truth and purity of the gospel, as they thought, might continue with them. The friends of Mr. Rogers supposed him to be a good and faithful minister of Jesus Christ; and therefore adhered to him to the last; and treated him with all possible respect, kindness and generosity, until the Great Head of the church was pleased to remove him from this world. And now he is gone to be here no more, we find the two societies cordially receiving and embracing each other, and cheerfully attending upon and sup∣porting one and the same minister, the Rev. Mr. Gardner. The moral character of Mr. Rogers was never impeached. Had he lived in the present day, perhaps such a controversy would never have been heard of. We have seen in Mr. Rogers a uniform character, and an honest upright man, whose integrity, and firm attachment to what he thought were important truths, were superior to the trials he met with, and by which persons of more easy virtue might have been overcome.</P>
<P>Some Geographical Description of the town of Leominster shall here be presented to the reader. Leominster contains about as much as five miles square, and is situated in the northeastly quarter of the county, and is distant about nineteen miles from the courthouse in Worcester; and from Bos∣ton,
<PB N="196" REF="026481_0195_0FD04FF50C323CF8"/>
it is a little to the northwest at the distance of fifty miles. It is bounded on the north and north∣east, by Fitchburg and Lunenburg; on the east, southeast and south, by Lancaster; and on the southwest and west, by Sterling, and a gore of land. This town is pretty plain and level in the middle of it, and for a mile and a half or two miles round the meetinghouse, and indeed all the way south of the meetinghouse towards Lancaster; to the north, towards Fitchburg, it is not quite so level; yet the land is pretty good, and the soil is clayey: Upon the east, and especially on the west, the land becomes hilly and more uneven, and the land is proportionably better. The farms in the middle of the town, are by no means poor; but those in the skirts of the town are very excellent in∣deed; and the land is equal to that in any town. The land is well adapted to all kinds of grain, and the hilly parts to grass and pasturage; and the town abounds with famous orchards, and all kinds of fruit, and much cyder is made in the place. The land is not very stony and rocky in general, ex∣cept it be some particular part of some of the hills. Of these none are famous or worthy of particular notice, except one in the westerly part of the town, called Wauhnoosnook Hill; this is about two miles in length, and a mile or more from the meetinghouse in the nearest place: It is pretty high and steep: And although there is some brok∣en and unimproveable land upon it, yet there are many very fine farms thereon. This hill is famous for affording vast quantities of most excellent
<PB N="197" REF="026481_0196_0FD0572E893481A0"/>
stone, of a grayish colour, pretty free, and easily split and wrought, and some have natural faces, sixteen, eighteen and twenty feet in length. This store is perhaps inexhaustible. In the south part of the town there is a very large body of plain land covered with pitch pine; and there is con∣siderable white pine within the town. But the main growth of wood consists of oak of all kinds, chesnut in plenty, much walnut, elm, butternut, shagbark, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The town is very well watered in every part, by numerous springs and rivulets. There are two streams which claim a particular mention: One is Wauhnoosnook Brook, so called from the hill of that name, as it originates at the foot of this hill, at the north end, and runs all along on the east side of the hill, and on the westerly side of the town, and finally falls into the river Nashaway. The other is the north branch of the river Nasha∣way, which coming in from Fitchburg, at the northwest angle of the town, runs about a mile east of the meetinghouse, and at the southeast angle of this town passes into Lancaster. There is some good interval land on this river, but in many places the banks of it are high and very steep. There is but very little meadow land in the town. On this river and the streams there are two grist mills, five saw mills, one oil mill, and clothiers' works very excellent. There are only a part of two ponds fall within the limits of this town, and these were mentioned in giving an account of Lunenburg.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="026481_0197_0FD04FF733E1BD00"/>It has been mentioned before that the soil of this town is clayey. There are indeed vast bodies of the best of clay in the town: And upwards of two hundred thousands of bricks are made here in a year. These bricks are said to endure the fire longer than any made in the county. The people of Leominster live mostly by the cultivation of the earth; and their farms and buildings proclaim their industry, and indicate a good degree of wealth. They have all the mechanicks and trades∣men in common with other places. And besides, the manufacturing of combs is here established, in two or three places, and the work is carried on to great perfection and profit. About twenty per∣sons work, more or less at this trade; about ten are constantly employed therein, and they manu∣facture about six thousand dozen in a year. Mr. Jotham Johnson, a trader here, employs five men in this work, who make twenty five hundred doz∣en per annum. Among these, is one who makes ivory combs, equally good perhaps, as any im∣ported from any country. Here are several stores and shops filled with European, East, and West∣india goods. There is much travel through this town, from the north part of the county of Hamp∣shire and of Worcester, by the way of Westminster, and from Vermont State, and the western part of Newhampshire, by the way of Fitchburg; these roads unite in the northwesterly part of Leomin∣ster, and come to the meetinghouse, where they part again; one turns nearly east, leading on through Harvard to Boston; the other runs south,
<PB N="199" REF="026481_0198_0FD0573009DD44C0"/>
bearing a little to the east into Lancaster, and so on to Boston. The county road from Leominster to Worcester runs southwesterly through Sterling.</P>
<P>Leominster is a growing, flourishing town; it stands about the middle of the towns of the coun∣ty in the proportion it pays to a state tax; and when the late census was taken there were 166 dwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> houses, and 1190 inhabitants in the place.</P>

<HEAD>WESTERN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS town was taken from Brook∣field Brimfield and Palmer, and was incorporated on the 16th of January 1741. In this place a congregational church was formed in the year 1743, and on the last of January, 1744, the Rev. Isaac Jones was ordained their first pastor. He died July, 1784, in the 67th year of his age, and 41st of his ministry. Mr. Jones was succeeded in the sacred office by the Rev. Stephen Baxter, who was separated hereunto March 9th, 1791.</P>
<P>Western is situated at the southwest angle of the county, and is bounded on the north and east by Brookfield, on the south by Brimfield, and on the west by Palmer: It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s about seventy three miles from the statehouse in Boston to the southwest, and from the courthouse in Worcester it is about twen∣ty

eight miles, and on the post road from Boston to Springfield, although this road does not pass through the centre of the town, or by the meeting∣house. From Brookfield this road enters Western on the northeast, about one hundred and twenty rods from the River Quaboag on the south side thereof, and runs nearly parallel therewith for a∣bout the space of two miles; then the road to Northampton parts from this, taking a northwest∣erly direction across the abovenamed river. The left hand, or post road, bears a southwestern course to Springfield. The town does not lie in a square and regular form. The lands in general, are very uneven: There are some s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll meadows on the several brooks, and some good interval lands on Quaboag River which runs through the town; also some small swamps and mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, but the prin∣cipal part of Western is high land.

On <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he west and southwest, this town is separated from the towns of Ware and Palmer, by a chain of rocky hills and mountains. The in∣habitants in general, are farmers; and the lands, though rather rough, produce large crops of In∣dian

corn, rye, and oats; and some considerable wheat is raised in the town: But much the great∣er part of the land is best adapted to English grass and pasturage. The soil is propitious to the cul∣tivation of fruit trees of all kinds; and the height and uneven surface of the lands; are a great secu∣rity to the grain and fruit from frosts. Western has its proportion of unimproveable lands; some of which are dry and rocky; some almost en∣tirely inaccessible, by reason of vast ledges of rocks; yet almost all the unimproved and unim∣proveable lands are covered with wood and timber. On the high lands grow chesnut, oak and walnut; and in the lower lands grow ash, birch, maple, elm, pine, hemlock, &amp;c. &amp;c. Western is sufficiently watered by springs, brooks and rivulets, which run about in the valleys among the hills.</P>
<P>The river Quaboag, from Brookfield, enters this town on the northeast, and passing through it about a mile west of the centre, goes out at the southwest angle, and falls into Chicabee. A great number of brooks and rivulets are emptied into Quaboag River in its course through Western. Salmon were formerly taken from this river within the town; but now their course is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>structed by sever∣al dams which extend across it, for the accommo∣dation of mills and other water works: However, the river and other streams afford all the various kinds of fish which are common to fresh water. About a mile from the centre of the town, are fix∣ed on this river, two grist mills, one saw mill, one scythe mill, one fulling mill, and one forge; and
<PB N="202" REF="026481_0201_0FD0570D88170F68"/>
the town affords some ore for the supply of the forge. Besides the manufactory of iron, there is no other which claims a particular mention, ex∣cept it be that of silk. Several gentlemen are turn∣ing their attention to the cultivation of mulberry trees. Col. Joseph Jones, from about thirty trees, has for three seasons past, fed upon an average a∣bout 30,000 worms; their produce has been be∣tween three and four pounds of raw silk annually. And when manufactured, after making all deduc∣tions for labour and trouble, has yielded a clear profit yearly, of sixty dollars, which is an annuity of two dollars per tree. A sample of the sewing silk, manufactured by Col. Jones, and presented to the writer, is equal to any imported.</P>
<P>There have been some vestiges of the aboriginals discovered on an extensive hill in the easterly part of this town, which was taken from Brookfield. On ploughing the ground a few years since, large beds of clamshells were discovered under the soil, which appeared to be placed at equal distances from each other; these, together with Indian uten∣sils found there, prove this was a place of their re∣sort and dwelling.</P>
<P>This town is very flourishing, and is growing in number, and increasing in wealth. When the cen∣sus was taken two years ago, there were 124 dwell∣ing houses, and 900 inhabitants in the place.</P>

<HEAD>DOUGLASS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was an original grant, and was prior to that of Sutton. It is about seventy years since some families settled in the place. The first settlers came from Sherburne, in the county of Middlesex, whence it was called <HI>Newsherburne,</HI> un∣til its incorporation, which was in the year 1746, when it received the name of <HI>Douglass</HI> to perpetuate the name and deeds of William Douglass, M. D. of Boston, originally from Scotland, educated there, a famous physician in his day, and who also wrote a History of Newengland in two vol. 8vo. a proprietor, and considerable benefactor.</P>
<P>The first person born here is yet living, almost seventy years old.</P>
<P>The lands in this place were not so pleasing and inviting as some others, and were therefore but slowly settled. The lands were burnt over yearly in the spring, for the purpose of turning cattle from the neighbouring towns, to feed there∣on. Hereby the growth of timber was greatly in∣jured, and the land became hard to subdue. Hur∣tleberry and whitebush sprung up, together with laurel, sweetfern and checkerberry, which noth∣ing but the plough will destroy. For thirty five years past the inhabitants have greatly increased, have prevented the fires running, have cultivated the lands, erected decent buildings; and are in∣dustrious

and prosperous. When the general enu∣me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation of the Commonwealth was made in the year 1791, there were in the town 165 dwelling houses, and 1080 inhabitants. This town is bound∣ed on the north, one mile by Oxford, and five miles by Sutton; on the east, by Uxbridge, six miles; on the south, by Gloucester, in the State of Rhodeisland, seven miles; on the west, two miles, by Thompson, in the State of Connecticut; two miles by a gore of land, and two miles and an half by Oxford. It lies 47 miles from Boston, about southwest; and about sixteen miles from the court∣house in Worcester, nearly south. The lands of Douglass, in general, are better for the growing of Indian corn, rye, oats and flax, than natural to grass. They are exceedingly adapted to the growth of apple trees, and all the other kinds of fruit trees common in this part of the country. The natural growth of wood in the town is, in the swamps and low lands, cedar, spruce, &amp;c. in some; in others, hemlock, white pine, ash, birch, beech, hornbeam, and maple: On the uplands, walnut, gray, white and yellow oak, chesnut, and chesnut oak, (its leaves like the chesnut, and bark like the oak) ma∣ple, pine, elm, locusts, balm of Gilead, so called, &amp;c. &amp;c. and almost every kind of tree, shrub, and bush, which is to be found in any of these northern States. The town has greatly abounded with good timber, and in the west part thereof there are almost four thousand acres of rocky woods; and in the place, potash, hoops and bar∣rels are made in plenty; some shingles are manu∣factured

This has several inlets on the west and north; the outlet is on the

east, runs in Sutton, becomes a river, turns south and comes into Douglass, and finally unites with Mumford River. Mumford River rises in rocky woods, increasing by streams from the ponds and from springs, and runs east into Uxbridge. There is a spring in rocky woods, a little southwest from Badluck Pond, which issues out of an apparently dry hill, and forms a stream, which runs southeast, never dry, and never known to freeze. This passes one rod and an half south of the great road, and is greatly admired for its pleasantness and refresh∣ing nature. The soldiers in the late war, called it the White Oak Tavern. There is considerable in∣terval land on Mumford River; there are four hundred acres in one body, near the head of it; further down there are divers other pieces, some of them large: Also, on this same river, there are works for making refined iron, near to Uxbridge line, and a corn and saw mill, very profitable. There are four hills in the town, large and no∣ticeable. The first we shall mention is a little north of the meetinghouse, large and considerable; originally well clothed with timber, but now af∣fords good tillage, mowing, and pasture land. On the west side of this hill, at the bottom near a swamp, the Indians, in old time, had their Wig∣wams and a sort, the remains of which are yet visible, and their tools are still found in the fields. About forty rods north of this hill, lies another hill, larger, but not cleared. Wallump Pond hill, near the pond of that name, in the southwest part of the town, is large but not very

<P>We shall now give some account of the Ecclesi∣astical state of Douglass. The congregational church here was gathered November 11th, 1747, and on the 16th of December, the same year, the Rev. William Phipps was ordained their first pastor. On the 10th of July, 1765, he was dis∣missed; he was succeeded in the gospel ministry by the Rev. Isaac Stone, who was separated here∣unto October 30th, 1771, and still continues with them in peace and harmony. Here are a number of families of the anabaptist persuasion.</P>

<HEAD>NEWBRAINTREE.</HEAD>
<P>THE General Court of Massachusetts having granted six thousand acres of land to cer∣tain persons of the ancient town of Braintree, in the county of Suffolk, for services by them done to the publick, it was called and known by the style of Braintree Farms. This tract of land, together with a part of Brookfield, and a part of Hardwick, was incorporated January 31st, 1751, and the name
<PB N="208" REF="026481_0207_0FD0571218EBF970"/>
Newbraintree was given to it. The people who first settled this territory took early care for the sup∣port of the gospel, and the enjoyment of all the instituted means of religion; they accordingly erected a house for the publick worship of God, and on the 18th of April, 1754, the church of Christ in this place was imbodied, and the Rev. Benjamin Ruggles, their first minister, was install∣ed the same day. Mr. Ruggles had been, for a number of years before, minister of the second parish in the town of Middleborough, in the county of Ply∣mouth. The Rev. Daniel Foster, the present pastor of the church and congregation in New∣braintree, was ordained a colleague with Mr. Rug∣gles, on the 29th of Octobe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>78. The Rev. Mr. Ruggles died suddenly, of an epilepsy, or apoplexy, Lord's day morning, May 12th, 1782, in the 82d year of his age, and the 62d of his pub∣lick ministry. There is but one religious society in the town, nor any sectaries excepting only two families of anabaptists. The first meetinghouse ever built here is now standing, and on a beauti∣ful eminence in the centre of the town, from whence there is a very extensive prospect. This house was a few years since repaired, and is now very decent and commodious. The people in this place are particularly attentive to the education of their children and youth: They have eight repu∣table school houses and in the winter season, as many instructors; two Latin grammar masters; and in the summer, they have generally two or three masters, and as many mistresses: And they
<PB N="209" REF="026481_0208_0FD057378B73DE98"/>
expend more annually in supporting schools, than in supporting their publick teacher of piety, relig∣ion and morality, though he is honourably main∣tained.</P>
<P>We shall now present a Geographical Descrip∣tion of Newbraintree.</P>
<P>This town contains about 13000 acres of land, and is bounded south, on Brookfield; west, by Ware River, which separates it from Hardwick; north, on the town of Barre; and east, on the towns of Oakham and Spencer: It lays much in a triangular form.</P>
<P>The town is neither remarkably hilly nor level; but agreeably interspersed with moderate hills and valleys. There are two hills of name and note; one on the westerly side of the town, and is steep, with large ledges of rocks on the east side of it, called <HI>Rattle Snakes' Rocks,</HI> from the great number of those venomous serpents, which, in the infancy of the town, inhabited them; but their race is now almost extinct. The other is situated in the southeasterly part of the town, and is called <HI>Mo∣hawk Hill.</HI> On the westerly side of the town, is what is commonly called a plain, though not very level; its natural growth of wood is pitch pine; and it is excellent for grain, and good roads. The soil of the town is in general rocky, moist, loamy and warm, and genial to wheat, rye, barley, oats, Indian corn, peas, flax, hemp, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is most excellent for orcharding; and, for its bigness, rather exceeds, perhaps, any other town in the county in fine grazing lands, as is evinced by the
<PB N="210" REF="026481_0209_0FD057138D9D8CC8"/>
annual produce of the dairy and of beef. Before the settlement of this place, the fires made in the woods, had destroyed almost the whole growth of timber; and it was feared there would be a scarcity; but by the care and prudence of the inhabitants there have, within a few years, sprung up fine groves of wood, and now there is a plen∣ty. The common timber upon the upland, or hilly parts, is oak, walnut and chesnut; in the low lands, swamps and marshes, there is maple, ash, birch, hornbeam and some spruce and hac∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack.</P>
<P>Newbraintree is very finely watered by rivers, brooks, rivulets and springs. Ware River runs along on the west side of the town, and is the boundary between Hardwick and this place. On the westerly side of the town there is also a large brook, called Meminimisset Brook, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm∣ed entirely by springs from the adjacent hills, and running north empties itself into Ware Riv∣er. On this brook there is an extensive and lux∣uriant meadow of several hundreds of acres, call∣ed Meminimisset, the name given to it by the In∣dians when a hideous swamp: This was the head quarters, and the chief place of rendezvous of the savages, at the time when Brookfield was de∣stroyed; and near which place eight brave men were killed, and three mortally wounded by the Indians, August 2d, 1675, as has been more par∣ticularly related in the account of Brookfield: And hither Mrs. Rowlandson was carried captive, who was taken by the enemy at Lancaster, Febru∣ary

10th, 1676, and here she buried her wounded child, on the 18th of that month.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this account as related under the head of Lancaster.</NOTE></P>
<P>This meadow beforementioned produces exceed∣ing great crops of most excellent hay. At the east∣erly part of the town lie two very considerable tracts of meadow land, through which run two brooks which arise from springs; these brooks, one of which carries a corn mill, after passing said meadows, and running near the south line of the town, unite, and then carry a saw mill: This stream then runs into the north part of Brookfield, and after several windings and meanderings, and carrying two more mills, it again visits the south part of this town, and runs through another large tract of excellent meadow, called Ditch Meadow, and carrying another corn mill in Newbraintree, it leaves the town, and falls into a large pond in the west parish in Brookfield, called Wickoboaug Pond. The air of this town is accounted good and salubrious, and the people prosper, flourish and increase. Excepting a few of the usual me∣chanicks, and one or two traders in foreign goods, the people are farmers, and have the reputation of being good husbandmen, frugal and industrious, and they live much independent. According to the late enumeration the number of souls amount∣ed to 940; and their houses are in general neat and commodious. This town is sixty six miles from Boston, a little to the south of west; and it is nineteen miles from the courthouse in Worcester, a very little to the north of west. There is consider∣able

travel through the place. A road from Con∣necticut river, through Hardwick, passes through Newbraintree and on to Rutland, and so on to Boston. A road also from the northward leads through this town to Brookfield, and so on to the southward.</P>

<HEAD>SPENCER.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole of this town was included in the original grant of Leicester. It was made a parish or precinct early in the year 1744, and was called the westerly parish of Leicester, until its in∣corporation on the 3d of April, 1753, when the name of Spencer was given to it. In this place a church was gathered May 17th, 1744; and over the flock of God in this place the Rev. Joshua Ea∣ton was ordained November 7th, 1744, who con∣tinued in the work of the gospel ministry until April 2d, 1772, when he died in the 28th year of his pastorate. Mr. Eaton first turned his atten∣tion to the law, and was, for several years, an able and skilful attorney in the county of Worcester, but chose at length to forsake that gainful em∣ployment, for the more high and honourable one of serving God in the gospel of his Son. He made a conspicuous figure in the sacred office. The
<PB N="213" REF="026481_0212_0FD0573A896457B8"/>
Rev. Joseph Pope succeeded Mr. Eaton, as an am∣bassador of Jesus Christ, being consecrated unto this holy calling October 20th, 1773, and still con∣tinues therein.</P>
<P>Spencer is said to be eight miles in length, and four miles in breadth, on a straight line. The town is considerably uneven, abounding in hills and val∣leys, although there are no hills very high or large, or called by any particular names. It is an exceeding fertile township, and the inhabitants are industrious, prosperous and wealthy. It is be∣come more numerous and opulent than the town from whence it was taken, as it is larger in lands, because several years after the incorporation of Spencer, the northwesterly part of Leicester was with the southerly part of Rutland, set off to form the town of Paxton.</P>
<P>This town is watered by many excellent peren∣nial streams which run through the several parts of it, some of which are sufficient to carry mills, but none of them are large. There are three in the north∣erly part; one proceeds from a large and fine pond, which lays partly in Spencer and partly in Rut∣land, called Browning's Pond: Its course, for sever∣al miles, is southerly. Another to the eastward of it, has its source in Rutland, and runs for some miles in the same direction with the former. A third is∣sues from a pond in the north part of Leicester; and running a westerly course for a considerable space, then unites with the second; after this junction, turning southwest, they fall in with the first men∣tioned stream. The general course of these wa∣ters
<PB N="215" REF="026481_0213_0FD057168781AD38"/>
still being southwesterly, they are emptied into Podunk Pond, so called, in Brookfield; whence is∣sues a river which runs into Chicabee River, which falls into Connecticut river, in the north part of Springfield. There are also in the south part of this town, two streams, one of which uniting with the streams mentioned above, falls into Connecti∣cut river; the other running southerly, falls in with French River, which is emptied into the sea at Newlondon, in the southeast angle of the State of Connecticut. All these streams have one or more mills standing on them. There are likewise in Spencer, two clothiers' works, where much busi∣ness is performed to great publick advantage; al∣so, there are two potash and pearlash works.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in the town is of the usual various sorts. On the high lands, oak, walnut and chesnut are the chief. The swamps are cov∣ered generally with maple, birch and elm. In the infancy of the town, there was a large quantity of excellent pine timber, but this is mainly worked up.</P>
<P>The number of the people in Spencer, accord∣ing to the late census, was computed at 1322, and the number of houses was 192.</P>
<P>Spencer lies about eleven miles southwesterly from Worcester, on the post road to Springfield, and fifty eight miles from Boston to the southwest.</P>
<P>Spencer is bounded on the north, by Paxton; on the east, by Leicester; on the south, by Charl∣ton; and on the west, by Brookfield.</P>

<HEAD>PETERSHAM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was an original grant made by the General Court, in the close of the year 1732, or beginning of 1733, to John Bennett, Jeremiah Perley, and others, as a compensation for services performed by them in the Indian wars, under a Capt. John White of Lancaster. The first meet∣ing of the grantees was held on the 10th of May, 1733. Some time after the grant was made, to quiet the Indians who claimed the soil, the pro∣prietors made them a satisfactory consideration therefor. It is rather more than six miles square. It had been a seat for Indians, and was called ma∣ny years by its Indian name, which was <HI>Nichewaug;</HI> and in the south part of the town lies <HI>Nichewaug Hill,</HI> so called by the natives, whereon, as in some other parts of the town, they had formerly plant∣ed fields of Indian corn, of which there remained evident traces when the first English settlers began there.</P>
<P>The original proprietors being some of them wealthy and enterprizing, they encouraged and drove on the settlement of this then infant planta∣tion, although there were no settled towns nearer than Lancaster on the east, and Rutland to the southeast, and Brookfield to the south, except a few new settlers in Lambstown, now Hardwick. But the land being excellent, divers persons soon be∣gan to work upon lots; the proprietors built a
<PB N="216" REF="026481_0215_0FD0571807C7F180"/>
meetinghouse, and so early as the year 1738, they contracted with and settled a minister for the in∣habitants, and who was supported by them until its incorporation. Although the prospects from the soil were very promising, and settlers moved in fast, yet they laboured under many and exceeding great disadvantages, being then so remote from any white people, from whom they could procure the necessaries of life, or derive any aid and sup∣port. While in its infancy, and struggling for life, so early as 1744, a French war broke out, and the Indians, being always in the interest of the French, they became hostile, and began to commit depredations in various parts of the land, which occasioned the few inhabitants great fear, terror and danger, obliging them to build forts in different parts of the town, round certain houses, into each of which a number of families moved for safety and defence, and soldiers were stationed there as a guard to the inhabitants, and to recon∣noitre the country. The people used to labour on their lands, in small parties, changing works with one another, having their guns by them, and these also they were, for a long time, obliged to carry with them whenever they went to the house of God for religious worship, and also to place centinels at the doors. But although they were often alarmed, yet no white person was ever known to be killed in the place, When peace was settled between England and France, and dan∣ger and fear from the Indians ceased, the settlement of the plantation went on very rapidly, and the peo∣ple
<PB N="217" REF="026481_0216_0FD0573D87616F50"/>
were become so numerous and able, as that the place was incorporated with all town privileges April 20th, 1754, and received the name of Pe∣tersham. The church of Christ in this place was gathered, and their first minister, the Rev. Aaron Whitney, was ordained December, 1738, who con∣tinued until September 8th, 1779, when he died in the 66th year of his age, and the 41st of his ministry. The year following, October 25th, 1780, the Rev. Solomon Reed was solemnly sep∣arated unto that office and work, and who still continues therein. Here also is a society of bap∣tists, who have for their teacher Mr. John Sellon.</P>
<P>The town of Petersham has been one of the most prosperous and flourishing in the county, if not in the Commonwealth. Although the grant of the township was subsequent to the formation of the county, yet it has so flourished and increased that it is become one of the foremost towns in the coun∣ty for wealth and number. There are but seven towns who pay more to a State tax; it contains about 1520 souls, according to the late census. The natural situation of the town is exceedingly beautiful; it is very high, but not hilly and une∣ven: The body of the town lies upon the highest land in it, which is a large long flat hill, upon the highest part of which the great road runs from the south to the north, eight rods wide, and set with trees on both sides, and for three or four miles in length affords a most commanding prospect, not only of the whole town, but of all the adja∣cent towns; the houses are large and well finish∣ed,
<PB N="218" REF="026481_0217_0FD05719AD2E21B0"/>
standing on either side of the street, from whence the land falls each way east and west, a∣bout a mile and an half to a stream, and then rises again, especially to the east, where it is fully set∣tled; is in clear view on the main street, and appears like another town. Here they have lately erected a large and elegant meetinghouse, standing on a most conspicuous situation, so as to be seen from divers of the contiguous towns; soon after it was built, Mr. Eleazar Bradshaw, now of Brook∣field, made them a present of a large bell, the weight whereof is 913<ABBR>lb</ABBR>, and the cost thereof was 96<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> So noble and publick spirited a deed, ought to be perpetuated for the honour of the do∣nor, and to stimulate others to like generous acts.</P>
<P>This town is thought by some to be the pleas∣antest, for an inland town, of any in the State, af∣fording to the eye, a general, extensive, and agree∣ably variegated prospect.</P>
<P>The land in this place is exceedingly favourable to the growth of all kinds of fruit trees, being high and warm; and here are large and excellent or∣chards, and much cyder is made here, beyond what the inhabitants consume; but they find a ready market for the surplus in the newer settle∣ments. Having mentioned their fine orchards, I would duly notice one very remarkable natural curiosity relative to this subject. There is now growing in an orchard, lately belonging to my honoured father, the Rev. Aaron Whitney, deceas∣ed, an appletree, very singular with respect to its fruit. The apples are fair and when fully ripe
<PB N="219" REF="026481_0218_0FD0573F090DEAB8"/>
of a yellow colour, but evidently of different tastes, sour and sweet. The part which is sour is not very tart, nor the other very sweet. Two apples, grow∣ing side by side, on the same limb, will be of these different tastes, the one all sour, and the other all sweet: And which is more remarkable, the same apple will be sour on one side, end, or part, and the other sweet; and that not in any order or uni∣formity; nor is there any difference in the ap∣pearance of the one part from the other. And as to the quantity, some have more of the acid, and less of the sweet, and so <HI>vice versa.</HI> Neither are the apples so different in their tastes, peculiar to any particular branches, but are found promiscu∣ously on any and every branch of the tree. The tree stands almost in the midst of a large orchard in a rich and strong soil, and was trans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anted there about fifty years ago. There is no appear∣ance of the trunk, or any of the branches having been ingrafted or inoculated. It was a number of years after it had borne fruit, before these different tastes were noticed; but since they were first discovered, which is upwards of thirty years, there has been constantly the same variety observed in the taste of the fruit of this tree. For the truth of the above account, an appeal may be made to many persons of distinction, and of nice tastes, who have trav∣elled a great distance to view the tree and taste the fruit; but to investigate the cause of an effect so much out of the common course of nature, must, I think, be attended with difficulty. The only so∣lution I can conceive is, that the corcula, or hearts
<PB N="220" REF="026481_0219_0FD0571B0CD7E720"/>
of two seeds, the one from a sour, and the other from a sweet apple, might so incorporate in the ground, as to produce but one plant, or that farina from blossoms of those opposite qualities, might pass into, and impregnate the same seed. But leaving this to the discussion of naturalists, I pro∣ceed with our description of Petersham.</P>
<P>The soil is rich and fertile, and the lands bear all kinds of grain, but most natural to grass and pasturage, and from the appearance and face of the town, we must judge the inhabitants to be in∣dustrious and wealthy, who subsist mainly by the cultivation of the earth. Though the town lies very high, yet the land is not dry, but stony and moist, abounding with springs and brooks of wa∣ter; there are, however, but two noticeable streams: Swift River, which rises from springs in Gerry, runs to the southwest, through the east∣erly and southerly part of Petersham, into the northwest part of Hardwick.</P>
<P>West Brook, a considerable stream, rises in the northwesterly part of the town, and runs through all the west side of it, and then enters Greenwich, in the county of Hampshire. On each of these there are both corn and saw mills, and clothiers' works; and by the sides of both there are consid∣erable bodies of good meadow land. Here are works for making pot and pearl ash, where much business is profitably carried on, and many persons employed. On the high lands the growth of wood is oak, more chesnut, and a great deal of walnut of later years. In the swamps and low
<PB N="221" REF="026481_0220_0FD05740C4105820"/>
lands, there is birch, beech, maple, ash, elm, and hemlock.</P>
<P>This town is situated sixty six miles from Bos∣ton, nearly west, and about twenty eight miles from the courthouse in Worcester to the northwest, and is bounded on the north, by Athol; on the east, by Gerry and Barre; on the south, by Barre and Hardwick; and on the west, by Greenwich and Newsalem, in the county of Hampshire.</P>

<HEAD>CHARLTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS town was taken wholly from Oxford, and was the westerly part thereof: It was incorporated November 2d, 1754, and then receiv∣ed its present name.</P>
<P>As much of the land in Charlton lies in the hands of the original proprietors, its settlement was greatly retarded for many years. However, in April, 1761, the congregational church here was imbodied, and the Rev. Caleb Curtis was solemn∣ly ordained to the work of the gospel ministry in this place, on the 15th of October, 1761. He con∣tinued their pastor fifteen years, and was dismissed from his office by a mutual council, October 29th, 1776. The people remained destitute of a sett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d minister upwards of six years, until January 8th, 1783, when the Rev. Archibald Campbell was
<PB N="222" REF="026481_0221_0FD0571C8AEEEF58"/>
installed their pastor. This Mr. Campbell was ordained pastor of the church and congregation in Easton, in the county of Bristol, on the 17th of August, 1763, where he continued nineteen years, being dismissed from his pastoral relation to that people, August 11th, 1782. Mr. Campbell con∣tinued in the pastoral office in Charlton, until A∣pril 9th, 1793, when he was dismissed by council, at his special request.</P>
<P>There is a large anabaptist church and society in this town, but at present they are destitute of a settled minister, as well as the congregational church and society.</P>
<P>We proceed to a Topographical Description of Charlton.</P>
<P>This town was not in high repute at first, and was thought by some to be hardly worth settling upon: As it was very rough in its natural state, and hard to subdue. But such land is almost al∣ways found to be strong and to wear well. This being the case with Charlton, from small begin∣nings and an inconsiderable figure, it has risen up, in the space of thirty or forty years, to renown a∣mong the towns of the county. It is computed to be nearly seven miles square, being much larger in extent than Oxford from whence it was taken, and in general a better tract of land. The peo∣ple are become very numerous, there being 1965 souls in the place when the census was taken in the year 1791, which is more by several hundreds than any town in the county, except Brookfield, Sutton and Worcester, and it is become exceedingly
<PB N="223" REF="026481_0222_0FD05742079E8FC0"/>
wealthy, as in the last State tax there were but six towns which paid more. There are 300 dwelling houses in the town. The people subsist chiefly by the cultivation of the earth; and they have great encouragement to labour, for the soil is strong and rich, and the lands are fertile and very productive: Here they raise grain of all kinds in plenty; beef and pork are fatted; butter and cheese are made in quantities equal to, if not surpassing any other town in the county. The lands are well and nat∣urally adapted to orcharding and fruit of all kinds. The hills are moist and springy; the hills and val∣leys are well proportioned and agreeably inter∣spersed. The town is well watered by springs, brooks and rivulets, none of which claim particu∣lar mention: But there is one large river in the western part of the town, near to Sturbridge, which runs from the north to the south, and is called Quinebaug. This river is almost an inconceivable advantage, not to Charlton only, but to many ad∣jacent towns, by supplying great plenty of water for all the mills and water works in the driest sea∣sons. On this river, within the limits of Charlton, there are some rich interval, and good meadow lands.</P>
<P>There are several hills in this town worthy of particular mention; one by the name of Ponnakin. Another called <HI>Mashymuggett</HI>; this is high, for on its summit buildings in about twelve adjacent towns may be discerned. This hill is situated a∣bout three quarters of a mile from the congrega∣tional meetinghouse. There is a third, known by
<PB N="224" REF="026481_0223_0FD0571E0AD7C990"/>
the name of <HI>Blood's Hill.</HI> The fourth and last we shall mention, is called Craige's Hill.</P>
<P>There are no ponds in the town worthy of no∣tice, nor mines or minerals as yet discovered.</P>
<P>The wood and timber which grow in Charlton is white, black, and red oak, and walnut and ches∣nut in great plenty; some white pine, and some pitch pine: In the low lands there is ash, birch, maple, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Charlton there are a few dealers in Europe∣an and India goods, as is usual in country towns; and they have also all the common tradesmen and mechanicks. But there are two tanners in the town to be noticed, who carry on their business to a very considerable degree, and in the most advan∣tageous manner, viz. Capt. Israel Waters, and Mr. Asa Corben; and especially the former, in the northerly part, who carries on his work to great perfection. He has an excellent bark mill, car∣ried by water, and upon a new construction, whereby he grinds all his bark. On the same stream, a little below, there is a gin still, a brew∣ery, malt house and corn mill, under the same roof, the property of Mr. Eli Wheelock, who erected said works in the year 1792, and where he carries on each branch of business very largely to his own and the publick interest. On the same stream there are several grist and saw mills, and other water works, and most of the mechanicks live in this north part of the town. There are also a number of pot and pearl ash works in different parts of the town, where large quantities of pot and

<P>THIS must be "the south town laid out to the Narraganset soldiers," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Having mentioned this grant, it is fitting to give a history of the whole matter in brief. In the year 1728, application was made to the General Court for a reward for services done in the Narraganset war, and the Court immed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly granted two townships of six miles square.

Being so numerous, two townships were judged inadequate; and upon further application, the Court granted five townships more in 1732, assigning one hundred and twenty proprietors to each, on condition, that sixty families be settled in each place, with a minister, in the space of seven years from the date of the grant, res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n each, one right for the first minister, one for the ministry, and one for the school; the government to be at the expense of laying ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the townships.</P>
<P>The whole society of petitioners, or claiman's, met at Boston on the com∣mon, June, 1732, and, dividing themselves into seven classes, agreed to draw lots for the townships. A committee of the General Court laid out the townships, and numbered them. No. 1. was located back of Saco and Scarborough.

It was granted in the year 1728, as a reward to a number of people who did service in what was called the Narraganset, or King Philip's war, or to their heirs, and was styled Narraganset, No. 2, until its incorporation, which was on the 20th of October, 1759, when the name of Westminster was given to it.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="026481_0225_0FD0571F8E8B09A8"/>The first meeting of the proprietors of this grant (who consisted chiefly of the inhabitants of Cambridge, Charlestown, Watertown, Weston, Sud∣bury, Newton, Medford, Malden and Reading) was held December 3d, 1733, when all officers were chosen necessary to manage the affairs of the proprietors. The first committee of the proprie∣tors of Narraganset No. 2, were John Cutting, James Lowden, and Joseph Bowman. From this time, to the year 1737, little was done to forward the settlement of the place. In March this year, Capt. Fairbanks Moor moved his family into it. He was the first planter. In June, Deacon Joseph Holden moved his family into the place. These two families contained fifteen souls. It being an exposed plantation, settlers moved in but slowly. In the year 1739, the proprietors erected a decent meetinghouse, which was dedicated at a proprie∣tors' meeting, June 6, 1739. The few settlers were desirous of, and forward for settling a min∣ister; accordingly, on the 4th of August, 1742, they made choice of Mr. Elisha Marsh, in which
<PB N="227" REF="026481_0226_0FD0574507674380"/>
the proprietors concurred. The church of Christ in this place was formed, and the Rev. Elisha Marsh was ordained their first minister October 20th, 1742. Mr. Marsh continued with them but a few years. An unhappy controversy arising be∣tween him and the people, he was dismissed from his pastoral office, 1757. Mr. Marsh was afterwards Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, in the coun∣ty of Cheshire, in the State of Newhampshire; and died but a few years since, at Lancaster, being on a journey.</P>
<P>The town remained in a broken state until Oc∣tober 16th, 1765, when the Rev. Asaph Rice was consecrated pastor, the second in succession, of the church and congregation here, and still continues in that office; and in peace and love with his people.</P>
<P>Previously to his settlement in Westminster, Mr. Rice had been a missionary among the Indians.</P>
<P>At the time of Mr. Marsh's ordination, the place was in its infancy, few in number, struggling for life, and exposed to Indian depredations, and its population went on slowly. About the year 1743, the General Court granted 400<HI>l.</HI> to fortify the place, with which ten forts were erected, and soldiers stationed there for the defence of the inhab∣itants. In 1746, some of the people of the place were put under pay, as a town scout. From 1744, to the close of the year 1748, the settlers met with great discouragements, and endured severe trials, although no person in the place was ever cut off by the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="026481_0227_0FD05721078B6198"/>After that period, the people increased, and the place flourished exceedingly, so that in the space of half a century, notwithstanding their dangers, distresses and difficulties, and the smallness of their first number, only fifteeen souls, they have spread and extended their branches, and covered the town, and are become a great people, as at this day; having, when the census was taken in 1791, 177 dwelling houses, and 1176 inhabitants. The original grant was six miles square; however, the measure was rather large, for by actual survey, in∣cluding ponds, rivers, &amp;c. it contained 27000 acres; but of late, 7000 acres of land, with the inhabitants thereof, were set off to aid in forming the town of Gardner, to the northwest. This town is still large, and is bounded on the west and the northwest by Gardner, on the north by Ashburnham; on the northeast by Fitchburg; on the east, by some farms not belonging to any town; on the south by Princeton; and on the southwest, by Hubbardston.</P>
<P>Westminster is situated on the height of land be∣tween the rivers Merrimack and Connecticut, having streams arising in the town, and running into both. The town is interspersed with hills and valleys; and with springs, brooks and rivu∣lets, very convenient for watering the land, and for carrying of mills. The northwesterly part of Watchusett hill falls within the limits of this town. And what is called the middle of the place, or centre of the town, is a large and high hill, the top of which is nearly level; this is a square of
<PB N="229" REF="026481_0228_0FD057468883D710"/>
six acres, left by the proprietors, as a convenient place for a training field, and for the meeting∣house. A little north of the centre of this square stands their new, large and elegant meetinghouse, directly in front of which passes the great road from Connecticut River to Boston. At the south∣east angle of this square stands an elegant house belonging to the Hon. Judge Gill; on the wester∣ly side of the square stands the minister's house. On the sides of this square are shops well stored with English and Westindia goods. In the town they have all the usual tradesmen and me∣chanicks. Here also are three grist mills, three saw mills, one oil mill, one fulling mill, one clothiers' works, and one trip hammer; also works for cutting nails, and works for the manufacture of iron are now erecting. The soil of this town is strong, rich and fertile; the high lands are well stored with stones, suitable and sufficient for wall∣ing in the farms, and are good for orcharding, and almost all kinds of fruit. Here are lands for the various purposes of mowing, ploughing and pastur∣ing. And the town has been, and still is well fur∣nished with wood. The high lands have all sorts of oak, some chesnut, some walnut, which is in∣creasing; they have had great plenty of white p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, which is chiefly cut off; some yellow and pitch pine: The low lands are stored with ash, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ech birch, maple, and hemlock.</P>
<P>There are four ponds within the town, one called Watchusett Pond, lies at the foot of that hill, on the northerly side. The line of the town crosses
<PB N="230" REF="026481_0229_0FD057228AC5CC18"/>
this pond, leaving part thereof in Princeton; this is of considerable bigness, and well replenished with fresh water fish. A stream issues from the northwesterly end of this pond, and runs norther∣ly through the easterly part of Westminster, re∣ceiving several streams in its course; and leaving the town it runs in a northeasterly direction into Fitchburgh, forming a considerable branch of the Nashaway, or Lancaster River. Another very small stream runs at the northeast corner of the pond, and running southeasterly falls into a stream, rising out of a large body of meadow, and con∣tinuing its course, empties into Stillwater River in Sterling. There is a stream arising in another body of meadow land, which falls into this pond, on its southwesterly side. This pond is fed and supplied chiefly, perhaps wholly, by springs and rivulets issuing from the great hill <HI>Watchusett.</HI> There is another large pond, near the centre of the town, in front of the hill, on which the meeting∣house stands; this is called Long Pond, being one mile and twelve rods in length, and about half as much in width. This being a very rocky pond, is not well furnished with fish. No constant stream empties into this pond: A small stream issues from the southeasterly corner of it, and run∣ning easterly, unites with the stream which runs out of Watchusett Pond. There is a small pond, in the easterly part of the town, called Grassy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into which there is no visible inlet: There is a small outlet, which, running southerly, falls also into that which comes from Watchusett
<PB N="231" REF="026481_0230_0FD0574809C69810"/>
Pond. The fourth pond is in the northern border of the town: No stream of any consequence runs into it; a small one issues from it, and running south, falls into a large stream, which rises in Westminster, and running easterly, is known by the name of North River; and continuing an east∣ern direction, unites with the stream which comes from Watchusett Pond. There is another stream, called the Most Northerly River, which rises in Ashburnham, and running through the northerly part of Westminster, receives various brooks and rivulets in Westminster, and helps to form the northerly branch of the river Nashaway. The last stream which deserves our notice, is called Otter River, which issuing from a swamp or low land in Hubbardston, runs northerly, through the wester∣ly part of Westminster, into Gardner, receiving several streams in its way, then turning, runs west∣erly through the north part of Templeton, Athol, Warwick, and the southerly part of Northfield, and falls into Connecticut River. This stream unites with Miller's River in Winchendon, as may be seen more particularly in the description of Templeton.</P>
<P>Westminster is large, and become populous, and is continually increasing in number and wealth. It is situated about fifty five miles from Boston, a little to the north of west, and about twenty two miles from the courthouse in Worces∣ter, nearly north.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCETON.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 20th of October, 1759, the General Court of Massachusetts passed an act for incorporating the east wing, so called, of Rutland, together with sundry farms, and some publick lands, contiguous thereto; and gave the place the name of Princeton, to perpetuate the name and memory of the late Rev. Thomas Prince, colleague pastor of the old south church in Boston, and a large proprietor of this tract of land, whose daugh∣ter and only surviving child the Hon. Judge Gill married for his first wife.</P>
<P>The town contained about 19000 acres: And at the time of its incorporation there were about twenty families in the place. It was in the month of May, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the year 1751, when Mr. Robert Keyes, now living, removed with his family from Shrewsbury, and fixed down near the foot of Wat∣chusett hill, on the east side, being the fourth fami∣ly which settled in the place. Upon the 14th of April, 1755, a child of his, named Lucy, aged four years and eight months, attempting, as was supposed, to follow her sisters, who had gone to Watchusett Pond, about a mile distant, and having nothing but marked trees to guide her, wandered out of her way in the woods, and was never heard of afterwards. The people for nearly thirty miles round collected immediately, and in companies travers∣ed
<PB N="233" REF="026481_0232_0FD0574988317D08"/>
the woods, day after day and week after week, searching for her, but never made the least discov∣ery. Many journeys were taken by the father, in consequence of reports, but all in vain. Various were, and have been the conjectures of people re∣specting the fate of this child. Divers concurring circumstances render the following most probable, that she was taken by the Indians, and carried into their country, and soon forgat her relations, lost her native language, and became as one of the aborigines.</P>
<P>Let us return to Princeton. The people who had settled in this town laboured at first under very great difficulties, by reason of the mountain∣ous, rocky, and naturally moist state of their lands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom want of passable roads, and by reason of the prodigious quantities of heavy timber with which the ground was covered, (sure indications of a rich and fertile soil,) however, they attended to their roads, and increased in number, and on the 30th of June, 1762, raised the frame of their present meeting∣house, hired preaching, and were attentive to their religious interests.</P>
<P>On the 12th of August, 1764, the church of Christ was imbodied in this town, and after vari∣ous fruitless attempts to settle a minister, the Rev. Timothy Fuller was ordained their first pastor on the 9th of September, 1767. In about eight years a general disaffection to Mr. Fuller took place, which ended in a dissolution of the pastoral rela∣tion between him and the people of Princeton on the 19th of April, 1776. Various attempts for a resettlement of the gospel ministry were unsuccess∣ful,
<PB N="234" REF="026481_0233_0FD05725879DB8E8"/>
until the 28th of June, 1786, when the Rev. Thomas Crafts was ordained pastor of the church and flock of God in this place. In the space of a∣bout three years, Mr. Crafts's health failed, and for nearly two years he was unable to preach, when all hope of his being recovered, so as to carry on the work of the sacred ministry being cut off, the pas∣toral relation between him and his people was am∣icably dissolved at his special request, on the 14th of March, 1791. The people remain without a settled minister.</P>
<P>In Princeton they have a very handsome social library established, of the value of upwards of 70<HI>l.</HI> ten pounds whereof were given by the Hon. Judge Gill.</P>
<P>In a little more than thirty years from its incor∣poration, Princeton is become very considerable among the towns of the county. It has surpris∣ingly increased in number and wealth. When the census was taken in 1791, there were 144 dwelling houses, and 1016 inhabitants in the place. The soil being excellent, people had ev∣ery encouragement from that consideration, to set∣tle and cultivate the lands; and their farms are most∣ly large and good. The land is naturally moist and springy, hilly and rocky, exceedingly well adapted to pasturage, and the growth of English grass: Hence the finest of beef is fatted here, and vast quantities of butter and cheese are produced in the town: Some parts of the place afford grain in plenty; and from the appearance of their build∣ings and farms, we must judge the people are very

industrious. Many of their houses are large and elegant.</P>
<P>This leads to a particular mention, that in this town is the country seat of the Hon. Moses Gill, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who has been from the year 1775 one of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Worcester, and for several years a Coun∣sellor of this Commonwealth. His noble and ele∣gant seat is about one mile and a quarter from the meetinghouse, to the south. The farm contains upwards of 3000 acres. The county road from Princeton to Worcester passes through it, in front of the house, which faces to the west. The build∣ings stand upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e highest land of the whole farm; but it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> level round about them for many rods, and then there is a very gradual de∣scent. The lands on which these buildings stand, are elevated between 1200 and 1300 feet above the level of the sea, as the Hon. James Winthrop, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> informs me. The mansion house is large, being fifty by fifty feet, with four stacks of chim∣nies: The farm house is forty feet by thirty six: In a line with this stand the coach and chaise house fifty feet by thirty six: This is joined to the barn by a shed seventy feet in length—the barn is two hundred feet by thirty two. Very elegant fences are erected around the mansion house, the outhouses, and the garden.</P>
<P>The prospect from this seat is extensive and grand, taking in an horizon to the east, of seventy miles at least. The blue hills in Milton, are dis∣cernable with the naked eye, from the windows of
<PB N="236" REF="026481_0235_0FD0572709484050"/>
this superb edifice, distant not less than sixty miles; as also the waters in the harbour of Bos∣ton, at certain seasons of the year. When we view this seat, these buildings, and this farm of so many hundred acres, now under a high degree of profitable cultivation, and are told that in the year 1766 it was a perfect wilderness, we are struck with wonder, admiration and astonishment. The honourable proprietor hereof must have great satisfaction in contemplating these improvements, so extensive, made under his direction, and I may add, by his own active industry. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is a gentleman of singular vivacity and activity, and indefatigable in his endeavours to bring forward the cultivation of his lands; of great and essential service, by his example, in the employment he finds for so many persons, and in all his attempts to serve the interests of the place where he dwells, and in his acts of private munificence, and pub∣lick generosity, and deserves great respect and es∣teem, not only from individuals, but from the town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd country he has so greatly benefited, and es∣pecially by the ways in which he makes use of that vast estate wherewith a kind Providence has blessed him. Upon the whole, this seat of Judge Gill, all the agreeable circumstances respecting it being attentively considered, is not paralleled by any in the Newengland States; perhaps not by any on this side the Delaware.</P>
<P>Return we to our more general description of Princeton. Having said the soil is rich, strong, and very productive; it is to be added, the
<PB N="237" REF="026481_0236_0FD0574C882D8568"/>
growth of wood is oak of the various kinds, chesnut, white ash, beech, black birch, and maple; and near the Watchusett hills, some butternut is to be seen, as also some walnut, which will undoubtedly increase and spread.</P>
<P>The hills of Princeton merit a particular de∣scription; they are three. First, <HI>Pine Hill,</HI> situ∣ated about two miles from the centre of the town, contains perhaps about thirty acres, and is most∣ly unimproveable; but its bowels afford a very great quantity of most excellent stones for build∣ings, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The second, is Little Watchusett Hill, this is sit∣uated near the centre of the town, perhaps half a mile distant, to the northward. This contains 237 acres, chiefly pasturing; though some parts of it, being ledgy and mountainous, are unim∣proveable.</P>
<P>The third, is the Great Watchusett Hill, or Mountain. This is situated about two miles from Princeton meetinghouse, to the north; the north∣westerly part hereof falls within the limits of Westminster. This is an exceedingly high moun∣tain, and is some of the first land discovered by people on board vessels at sea, when making for any of the sea ports in Massachusetts; and it is to be seen from the higher lands, in a greater part of the towns in the Commonwealth, especially in those between the sea and Connecticut river. It contains seven or eight hundred acres; about four hundred acres of which being the summit, and be∣ing province land, were given to the Rev. Mr.
<PB N="238" REF="026481_0237_0FD0574E09E3CCA0"/>
Fuller, by the General Court, in consideration that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was the first minister, and settled upon a small salary, in the infancy of the town. This was no trifling gift; for although one hundred acres of it be worth little or nothing, yet most of the remaining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hundred acres will make con∣siderable p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, and some parts very good. The highest part of the mountain is a flat rock, or a ledge of rocks, for some rods round, and there is a small pond of water generally upon the top of it, of two or three rods square; and where there is any earth, it is covered with blueberry bushes for acres round; and as you descend the hill, there are very low and small trees, with flat tops, like those on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sea shore, occasioned no doubt, in part, by the state of the air; for it is several degrees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>older, at any time, on the top than at the bottom of the mountain; the further you descend, the taller are the trees, until they become of the common size. Upon the southerly side of this hill it may be ascended to the very top with hor∣ses, but upon the east, north and northwest, it is very st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep, broken and ledgy; and many acres ut∣terly unimproveable any way at present. Perhaps its bowels may contain very valuable hid treasure, which in some future period may be descried. There are very considerable improvements upon some sides of this hill near the bottom of it, and some very valuable lands yet uncultivated. The circumference of this monstrous mass is about three miles, and its height is 3012 feet above the level of the sea, as was sound by the Hon. John

<P>This town is exceedingly well watered by springs and rivulets, as is generally the case with hilly, rocky land; but there are no streams of any great bigness, although several large and fine rivers have their sources here. One branch of the Nashaway begins at the foot of Watchusett Hill, and runs through Sterling and Boylston to Lan∣caster. Piss River, so called, springs up at the foot of this mountain, on the westerly side, and runs through Hubbardston, and joins Ware River. There are several places in the town where springs issue and the waters divide, running some into Mer∣rimack, some into Connecticut river. There is but little meadow land in Princeton, when com∣pared with towns in general, but there are consid∣erable tracts of interval which afford good hay; however, the greatest part of their hay is produced from upland mowing. There are two ponds on∣ly in this town, or rather a part of two: Watchu∣sett Pond, about three miles north from the meet∣inghouse, at the north end of that mountain; it covers about one hundred acres, only about twen∣ty of which are in Princeton, the greater part in Westminster. It is fed by springs from the hill; its outlet is in Westminster. Quinepoxet Pond is situated in the southwest part of the town, some of which falls within the limits of Holden. It contains perhaps seventy or eighty acres. Its in∣lets are several small streams; its outlet is the
<PB N="240" REF="026481_0239_0FD0574F8762A3E8"/>
River Quinepoxet, as described in the account of Holden. In Princeton there are four grist mills, five saw mills, and one fulling mill, and clothiers' works. This town is situated fifty two miles from Boston, about due west; and fifteen miles from the courthouse in Worcester, nearly north, and bounded on the north, by Westminster; on the east, by Sterling; on the south, by Holden; on the southwest, by Rutland; and on the west, by Hubbardston.</P>

<HEAD>TEMPLETON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was an original grant to cer∣tain persons who did service in what was called the Narraganset, or King Philip's war, or to their heirs, and was accordingly known by the name of <HI>Narraganset</HI> No. 6, until its incorporation, March 6th, 176<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when the name <HI>Templeton</HI> was given to it. The first meeting of the proprietors of this tract of land was held at Concord October 29th, 1733. The grant was designed to include as much as six miles square, but the measure was made rather large. Its settlement was greatly retarded through danger from the Indians, in that then in∣fant state of this part of the country; and espec∣ially in the French war, in the years from 1740, to 1746. After that period inhabitants came in
<PB N="241" REF="026481_0240_0FD0577388705AC8"/>
very fast, so that a church of our Lord Jesus Christ was gathered here December 10th, 1755, and the same day the Rev. Daniel Pond was or∣dained to the work of the gospel ministry in this place: He continued in the sacred office not four years, being dismissed by advice of an ecclesiasti∣cal council, August 2d, 1759. He was succeed∣ed by the Rev. Ebenezer Sparhawk, who was sep∣arated unto that high and holy calling on the 18th of November, 1761, who still continues faithfully serving God in the gospel of his Son.</P>
<P>This town flourished and increased so fast, and not lying in the best shape to continue one relig∣ious society, it was divided into two parishes, Feb∣ruary 16th, 1774. The new or second parish lay on the west side, and being soon after made a dis∣tinct town, we shall leave it for the present, and proceed in our description of Templeton. Al∣though this town is not a level, champaign tract of land, yet it is not so uneven as many; it has no remarkable hills or eminences distinguished by particular names, except one on the south side towards Hubbardston, called <HI>Mine Hill,</HI> from its abounding in good iron ore; and supposed also to be rich in other more valuable mines and min∣erals; this was granted to a Capt. Andrew Robin∣son, of Gloucester, some time before the original grant of the township; it was soon sold, and now a great number of persons have a right therein: it is a long, rocky hill, and very steep on one side.</P>
<P>There is but one pond in the town, and that is small, in the south part, from whence there is an
<PB N="242" REF="026481_0241_0FD05751075C71F8"/>
outlet, on which are mills, this forms what is call∣ed Otter River, on which are clothiers' works, and where the business is well and profitably carried on. This river runs southerly into a corner of Hub∣bardston, then turning northeast runs back into Templeton again, and through an angle of Gard∣ner, where several streams join it. It is some way a boundary between Gardner and Templeton; then it takes a northwesterly course in Templeton, and is joined by Trout Brook; and from thence running through an angle of Winchendon, there falls into Miller's River. The main branch of the river Burnshirt, so called, rises from a pond on the easterly side of Gerry, at its northeast end, and runs through meadows to the southeast, where there are good mills, and within the bounds of Templeton, joins the easterly branch of Burnshirt, and soon after becomes a boundary between Tem∣pleton and Gerry, for almost two miles; and then runs through a corner of Hubba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dston into Barre, where it unites with Ware River. Conneystow, another stream, rising from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs in the south part of this town, runs southerly into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubbard∣ston, where are mills, and then falls into Burnshirt. On these streams and rivers there are excellent meadow and interval lands.</P>
<P>The general growth of wood in the town is of the following kinds, oak, chesnut, white and pitch pine, ash, beech and birch; walnut, within a few years, has sprung up, and is spreading. The lands are rich and good in general, producing all sorts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain, and yield pasturage and grass in great
<PB N="243" REF="026481_0242_0FD057750AB1EA40"/>
plenty. In this town the business of making pot∣ash is carried on. Here are the usual necessary tradesmen; but the inhabitants chiefly subsist by the cultivation of their lands, and are a prosperous and flourishing people. This town is situated about sixty miles from Boston, a little to the north of west; and is twenty eight miles from the court∣house in Worcester, a little to the west of north.</P>
<P>The number of its inhabitants was 950, when the general census was taken in 1791.</P>
<P>Templeton is bounded on the west, by Gerry; on the north, by Winchendon; on the east, by Gardner; and on the south, by Hubbardston; and contains still about 17000 acres of land, not∣withstanding the greater part of Gerry, and a part of Gardner was taken from it.</P>

This tract was a seat for the Indians, and at the time of its being granted, was a frontier township, and greatly exposed; and the settlement of the place was obstructed by the French and Indian war, which commenced in 1744. and continued several years. Previously to the breaking out of that war, several families had seated themselves here, but they were greatly distressed with fear, by rea∣son of the Indians; they were obliged, as other in∣fant plantations, to live in garrisons for several years, and to labour at their various occupations with their mili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry armour by them. Although this place was thus exposed, yet I cannot find that any persons were killed here, except a Mr. Ezekiel Wallingford, who being on some occasion at a distance from his garrison, was discovered by the en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my; and seeing them, he turned to run to the fort, but was stopped short by a fatal ball, August, 1746. In the month of April, the year following, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. Jason Badcock was taken captive by the In∣dians, and carried to Canada: From whence he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturned in a few months.</P>
<P>The church of Christ in Athol was imbodied in the presence, and under the countenance of three neighbouring pastors and churches, August 29th. 1750; and the Rev. James Humphrey was
<PB N="245" REF="026481_0244_0FD0577688176940"/>
consecrated their first pastor on the 7th of No∣vember following. The Rev. Mr. Humphrey, af∣ter serving the church and people of this place faithfully upwards of thirty one years, was, at his request, dismissed from his pastoral relation to them on the 13th of February, 1782, on these con∣ditions, viz. The inhabitants voted to free his per∣son and estate from all kinds of taxes during his natural life; and gave to him and his heirs a good pew in the present meetinghouse, so long as it should stand.</P>
<P>The town remained destitute of a settled pastor until November 21st, 1787, when the Rev. Joseph Estabrook, was solemnly separated unto the work of the gospel ministry, as successor to the Rev. Mr. Humphrey.</P>
<P>There are about ten families of anabaptists in this town, but there is no church, nor any stated teacher of this denomination in the place: There are also three families of universalists, and one of episcopalians here.</P>
<P>We shall now go on to some Geographical De∣scription of Athol. This township was originally granted to sixty proprietors, with a reserve of a right of land for the first settled minister, a right for the use of the ministry, and one for a school: It was to contain as much as six miles square. A part of the town was set off, at the southeast angle, to aid in forming the town of Gerry, and a part at the northwest corner, to help form the district of Orange; but still the town of Athol is more than five miles square, and contains 16000 acres of land.
<PB N="246" REF="026481_0245_0FD057540978D1E8"/>
It is very uneven, rocky, and hilly, though there are no famous or remarkable hills in the place; nor any with names, except one in the east part of the town, called <HI>Walnut Hill,</HI> from the considerable quantity of walnut wood and timber growing thereon. The soil of this town is not so good as some: It is rather cold, consequently not extraor∣dinary for grain of any kind, for orcharding, or for mowing: It is said to be very good for grazing; and much beef is annually fatted in the place. There is some pitch pine plain in the north part of the town; there is also considerable white pine remaining in the westerly part of the place; but oak, chesnut, ash, beech, birch, hemlock, and ma∣ple, constitute the principal growth of wood. The town has its full share of water. Miller's River, so called by the English, in consequence of a man by the name of Miller, who was drowned herein, well towards a hundred years ago, in attempting to pass this river in his way to Northfield: But the natives called it Payquage or Bayquage—this river is large, and its current in many places rap∣id; it comes into Athol in the northeasterly quarter of the town, and passing within half a mile of the meetinghouse, it runs westerly in∣to Connecticut River; in the southwesterly part of Athol, there is some good meadow on this river. The next stream for bigness is Tully Brook; (or rather <HI>River</HI> if its appellation had not been estab∣lished) this has its origin in Fitzwilliam in the State of Newhampshire, comes through Royalston into the northerly part of Athol, and joins Miller's
<PB N="247" REF="026481_0246_0FD05778192E22F0"/>
River about one mile northwest from the meeting∣house. On this stream, and after the junction, there are some very good meadows. Mill Brook, so call∣ed from its having upon it many convenient seats for mills, rises from various springs in the south∣easterly part of the town, and runs northwesterly, and falls into Miller's River in the west part of Athol. In the southeasterly part of the town rises a brook sufficient to carry mills, which runs to a pond of thirty acres or more, which the line be∣tween Newsalem and Athol crosses in the south∣west part, and from this pond there is an outlet which runs north, and empties into Miller's River. There is also another pond in the north part of the town, from whence there is an outlet into Tully Brook: This is small, covering perhaps twenty or thirty acres.</P>
<P>Upon the rivers and streams abovementioned, there are in the town, four grist mills, six saw mills, one fulling mill, and one trip hammer. We must not omit to mention, there is a very fine spring in this town, which issues out of a high bank upon the side of Miller's River, (perhaps twenty feet above the surface of the river) the wa∣ter whereof is medicinal. Many persons who have drank freely thereof, have found it operate as a gentle cathartick; and some who have been poison∣ed, have been speedily cured by washing the parts affected therewith. Several who have been afflict∣ed with rheumatick complaints, bathed in the wa∣ters of this spring, in a cistern, some few years ago provided to receive them, and found great relief.
<PB N="248" REF="026481_0247_0FD0575589068818"/>
And what is worthy of notice is this, these waters have the same efficacy and virtue without soap, in washing of persons, which other waters have with. We close the account of Athol with saying, it is situated in the northwestern extremity of the coun∣ty, about thirty five miles from the courthouse in Worcester, to the northwest, and from Boston it is seventy two miles, a little to the north of west. It is bounded on the north, by Royalston; on the east, by Gerry; on the south, by Petersham; on the southwest, by Newsalem; and on the north∣west, by Orange. The number of inhabitants in this town, when the census was taken, was 850.</P>

<P>In Oakham they have a social library established, containing towards sixty volumes.</P>
<P>The reader shall now be presented with some Geographical Description of Oakham.</P>
<P>Although the shape of the town is not an exact square, yet it contains about four miles and an half square; and it is bounded by Rutland, on the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st; by Barre, on the north and northwest; by Newbraintree, on the west and southwest; and by Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncer, on the south and southeast. The gener∣al face of the town is hilly and stony. The nat∣ural soil is not inferior perhaps to that of the neighbouring towns in general; but not being settled so early as Rutland, it was greatly injured by fires. The first settlers of Rutland used to se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="250" REF="026481_0249_0FD05757082EA290"/>
fires in Oakham annually, or frequently, and then turn their cattle thither to feed through the sum∣mer season. There are no remarkable hills, nor any extensive plains in the town. The produce is, Indian corn, wheat, rye, flax, &amp;c. &amp;c. and whatever is common to this country. The land is well accepted to orcharding, and all kinds of fruit trees; for it is high, sweet, and in general not ex∣posed to frosts. The growth of wood and timber is oak of all sorts, abounding especially in white oak, walnut, chesnut, and whatever is common to the high and low lands in other towns.</P>
<P>Some parts of the town are high and rather dry; nevertheless, the lands bear a drought well; and in general there are sufficient springs, rivulets, and streams of water. There is one river which has its source in the easterly part of the town, call∣ed <HI>Five Mile River</HI>; it runs from the north to the south; it is not large, yet there is one corn, and one saw mill standing thereon in the southerly part of the town; and on this stream there is some meadow land. The northerly part of Oakham borders on and near a river, which is large, called Ware River; on this there is some little in∣terval and meadow land. There is but one other meadow in the town of any considerable bigness; this is situated about a mile southeast from the meetinghouse, and is known by the name of Clammour Meadow. In the northeasterly part of this town, near to Rutland, is situated Muddy Pond, so called, not large; from this pond issues a stream, which running from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utheast to the

<P>There is a large pond, called Browning's Pond, situated in the southeasterly quarter of this town, and lies, partly in Rutland and partly in Spencer, but the greater part in Oakham. To this there is an inlet, and at the south end an outlet which runs into Spencer, and so to Quaboag River. These ponds and streams are well stored with fish.</P>
<P>There are several roads through different parts of the town; one through the north angle of the town, leading from Petersham to Rutland and Worcester; another about a mile north of the meetinghouse, leading from Rutland to Hardwick; another which leads from Rutland to Brookfield, passing about half a mile east of the meetinghouse; another leading from Newbraintree to Worcester, called the New County Road; this runs near the south side of the town.</P>

<P>THIS place was originally a part of the town of Lunenburg, and wholly included in the grant made to the proprietors of Turkey Hill. It was made a distinct and separate town on the 3d of February, 1764. A part of Fitchburg, to the north, was set off in the year 1767, to aid in forming the town of Ashby, in the county of Mid∣dlesex. It is now bounded by Ashburnham and Ashby, on the north and northwest; by Lunenburg, on the east; by Leominster, on the south and southeast; and by Westminster, on the west and southwest.</P>

By the late census the dwelling houses were found to be 166, and the inhabitants 1151, spread over a territory not much exceeding 13000 acres. Most of the people live in comfortable and easy circum∣stances, possessing all the necessaries, and many of the conveniences of life.

among them may justly be deemed rich. The people near the meetinghouse are settled pretty thick, and there much business of various kinds is performed: For here runs, a few rods south of the meetinghouse, the north branch of Nashaway Rive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> One part of this river comes from Ash∣burnha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the other part from Watchusett Pond; these unite a little west of Fitchburg meetinghouse▪ After this junction, and just below the meet∣inghouse, there is one corn mill, one saw mill, one fulling mill, one clothier's works, one trip ham∣mer, and works for grinding scythes: These occa∣sion a great resort of people there to transact their various concerns. A little southwest from the meetinghouse, is a high, rocky hill, covered prin∣cipally with pine, called <HI>Rollstone Hill.</HI> Here also is a hill, usually denominated <HI>Pearl Hill,</HI> and is composed of a rock of a peculiar quality, not common in this part of the country. It produces isinglass, or talc, in great plenty. The appear∣ance encourages a hope that there are valuable mines, either of gold or silver, or both, imbosom∣ed there. Attempts have heretofore been made to explore and possess them; but for want of wealth or perseverance in the undertakers, they have not obtained the desiderata. All valuable mines in this part of the world, as in most other parts, lie deep in the bowels of the earth, and much labour is necessary to reach them. In the present state of our population, riches, in these northern parts, are with much greater facility procured from the sur∣face of the earth, by the various instruments of
<PB N="254" REF="026481_0253_0FD0575A09A8EA68"/>
cultivation, than from deep and latent mines of the richest ore. When the country becomes overstocked with inhabitants, and support from the soil shall not be so easily obtained, it is not im∣probable that from this mountain will be dug large quantities of those shining metals, as every thing, at present, favours the conjecture. Besides the river abovementioned, which runs from the northwest to the southeast, through the tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, there are several other streams which pass through it, which occasion the inhabitants great expense in building and repairing bridges. From the north∣west part of Connecticut river the people travel much through this place, in their way to Boston; and at present they have a stage which runs be∣tween them and Boston, and goes and comes twice in the week.</P>
<P>The church of Christ in this town was imbodi∣ed, and their first and only, and present minister, the Rev. John Payson, was ordained January 27th, 1768.</P>
<P>This is a growing, flourishing place, and the people have hitherto been peaceable and happy; they are indeed very much so; and if they con∣tinue in peace and unity, they will still greatly increase in number and wealth. They subsist chief∣ly by husbandry; there are, however, the usual me∣chanicks, and a few dealers in European, East and West India goods.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in this town is very excel∣lent: Oak, walnut and chesnut, constitute the

<HEAD>WINCHENDON.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 10th of June, 1785, a grant of land, to be equal to six miles square, was made by the Legislature of Massachusetts, to Lieut. Abra∣ham Tilton, and others: Preference, however, was to be given to the descendants of the officers and soldiers who served in the expedition to Canada, in the year 1690. This tract was to be laid out into sixty three equal shares; one for the first minister, one for the use of the ministry, and one for the use of a school; the others, for sixty proprietors. As these all, excepting eight, belonged to <HI>Ipswich,</HI> in the county of Essex, in Massachusetts, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was called Ipswich Canada, until its incorporation by an act of the General Court, which passed June 14th, 1764, when it was made a town, and called Winchendon. The proprietors received this grant on conditions of erecting sixty small houses, to∣gether
<PB N="256" REF="026481_0255_0FD04FEF860EA0F0"/>
with a suitable, convenient meetinghouse, and settling a learned and orthodox minister in five years from the laying out of the township. These conditions were not punctually fulfilled; however, in the year 1752, ten families had fixed down here. But the settlement of the place was immediately retarded by what is commonly called the last French war. Most of the settlers left the place; they who remained were obliged to keep in garrisons. The proprietors set up the first meet∣inghouse, thirty five by forty five feet, in the spring of the year 1762. The church of Christ in this place was imbodied, and the Rev. Daniel Stimp∣son was ordained their first pastor, on December 15th, 1762. Mr. Stimpson continued not six years in the ministry; the Great Head of the church saw fit to remove him hence by death, July 20th, 1768. He was succeeded in the pastoral office by the Rev. Joseph Brown, who was separated here∣unto May 24th, 1769. Mr. Brown continues in his work, and enjoys the affection and esteem of his people. The first house for publick worship being too small for the inhabitants, they on the 24th and 25th of May, 1792, erected a large new one, fifty by sixty feet, and having completed it, met in it for the first time January 1st, 1793, when it was solemnly dedicated to the service of God.</P>
<P>In this town a foundation is already laid for a social library, which bids fair to be large and very considerable in time.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="026481_0256_0FD05780482A9B50"/>When this township was first located it was supposed to extend northerly to New hampshire, but upon running the line afterwards between the two States, it was found there was a mile in width for the whole length of this town left to Massachu∣setts. Upon the granting of Royalston, some years after, this strip of land was annexed to that town, and called Royalston Leg. When a number of families had got seated thereon, at their request, it was in 1780 set to Winchendon. It contained 3840 acres. In June, 1785, a piece of land of 3680 acres, was taken from the southeasterly part of this town, to help form the town of Gardner; Winchendon, however, still remains more than six miles square.</P>
<P>The present extent and boundaries of Winchen∣don are as follow. Beginning at the northeast angle of the town, on the State line, thence south twelve degrees west, five miles and an half on Ash∣burnham line, to the northeast corner of Gard∣ner: Thence west twenty eight degrees south, three miles and eighty five rods on Gardner line, to a corner in Templeton line: Thence north thirty six degrees west, two miles one hundred and forty four rods on Templeton line, to a corner: Thence north seventy eight degrees west, six hundred rods on said Templeton line, to a corner in Royalston line: Thence north twelve degrees east, on Roy∣alston line, five miles two hundred and sixty rods, to the northeast corner of said Royalston, on the State line, or the line between Winchendon and Rindge: Thence east twelve degrees south, six miles on the State line, to the first mentioned bound▪</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="026481_0257_0FD0575B89510668"/>The soil of Winchendon is deep and good, and produces rye, barley, oats, flax, and all kinds of vegetables: Wheat is not raised here in so great plenty as in some other towns; yet more at present than formerly. Indian corn is not so easily raised, as the land is rocky, and some of the extreme parts of the town are much subject to frosts. The town is not very uneven, and there are no remarkable hills in the place.</P>
<P>The general growth of wood on the high lands, is red oak, beech, rock maple, and black birch, in∣terspersed with white pine and hemlock. On the low lands, white pine, hemlock, hacmatack, ash of all kinds, and yellow birch, interspersed with red oak and beech. On some of the lowest lands, there is little or nothing but pine, hemlock, and hacmatack. In some parts of the town there is chesnut, and in other parts pitch pine, but nei∣ther of them in plenty.</P>
<P>Mines or minerals, none as yet have been dis∣covered in the town: There are two or three springs, however, of the mineral kind; one espec∣ially in the northerly part of the town, which is thought by physicians and others acquainted with such things, to be equal to many in great repute for their healing virtue. It is certainly of the me∣dicinal kind, and rather seems of a chalybeate quality. There is but one pond which is wholly within the limits of this town, called <HI>Denison</HI>'s <HI>Pond,</HI> it covers perhaps as much as one hundred and fifty acres. It has an inlet from the north, and an outlet towards the south into a river which runs
<PB N="259" REF="026481_0258_0FD05781CB5D4570"/>
within an hundred rods of said pond. It abounds in fish of various kinds. There is one river, known by the name of Miller's River, the princi∣pal source whereof is a large pond, lying chiefly in the northeasterly part of Rindge, a small part only falling within the bounds of Winchendon, where the outlet is. This pond is known by the name of <HI>Monomenock Pond.</HI> The outlet from this pond, together with some small streams from ponds in the northwesterly part of Ashburnham, uniting in the northeasterly part of Winchendon, form Miller's River, which runs westerly, south∣westerly and southerly, half round the town; in no place nearer than one mile of the meeting∣house, and in some places three miles and more from it. It leaves this town in the southwesterly part thereof, not far from the pond above describ∣ed, the outlet of which, as we have said, falls into this river. Otter River, so called, which runs through the northerly part of Templeton, just touches on Winchendon, in the southwesterly part thereof, and runs nigh the bounds of the town about a mile and a half, and unites with Miller's River, but just before it leaves Winchen∣don. There are two large streams in the westerly part of this town, taking their rise in Fitzwilliam. One of them joins Miller's River in Winchendon, near to Royalston: This is not distinguished by any particular name. The other, still larger, runs into Royalston, and some considerable way in the easterly part thereof; then turns and enters Win∣chendon, and after running several miles, joins
<PB N="260" REF="026481_0259_0FD0575D09A24F00"/>
Miller's River just above Denison's Pond. This stream might have been denominated a river from its largeness, had it not early received the appel∣lation of Priest's Brook. This name was given to it from the circumstance of its running through a tract of land, now lying in Royalston, formerly granted by the General Court of Massachusetts to a Joseph Priest, to induce him to set up an house of entertainment for the benefit of travellers from this state to the Ashuelots (Keene and Swansey) and to No. 4 (Charlestown) in the state of New∣hampshire. The house of this Priest, was called <HI>The Half Way House.</HI></P>
<P>These two streams, especially the latter, abound with salmon trouts. This sort of fish is also found in many parts of Miller's River, as also pickerel and perch.</P>
<P>Besides the abovementioned, there are many other streams and rivulets running in every part of this town, whereby it is exceedingly well watered.</P>
<P>There is but little meadow land, perhaps not more than one hundred and fifty acres in the town of Winchendon.</P>
<P>Interval land on Miller's River there is consid∣erable, and what is improved is of a very good quality. But of this there is not so much as might have been expected; for the high lands in most places shut down quite close upon the riv∣er. Upon the rivers and streams in the town there are two grist mills, six saw mills, and one clothier's works. There are also in the town, two potash works.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="026481_0260_0FD0578348F89D98"/>Roads in various directions centre at, or near the meetinghouse. The greatest road is from Boston, through Winchendon, and so on through Fitzwilliam to Charlestown; this road a stage passes weekly through the summer season. A∣nother road leads from Winchendon, through Gardner, Westminster, and so on to Worcester. Another runs south through Templeton; another westerly through Royalston, and another norther∣ly through Rindge. Winchendon is situated a∣bout sixty two miles from Boston, by the nearest route, to the northwest: And from Worcester courthouse it is thirty five miles, a little to the west of north. When the census was taken, there were in the place 150 houses, and 950 inhabit∣ants, and it will no doubt still greatly increase and multiply.</P>

<HEAD>ROYALSTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is, as to the original grant and settlement, doubtless by many years, the young∣est town in the county. It was in the year 1752, or very soon after, granted to the Hon. Messrs. Hubbard, Erving, Royal, Otis, and others, and was to include all the unappropriated lands be∣tween Newhampshire line, on the north; Warwick,
<PB N="262" REF="026481_0261_0FD0575E8AFF8570"/>
on the west; Athol and Templeton, on the south; Winchendon, on the east and south; and Ashburn∣ham, on the east. This grant was known by the name of Royalshire, until its incorporation, which was on February 16th, 1765, when it was called <HI>Royalston,</HI> in compliment to the late Col. <HI>Isaac Roy∣al,</HI> one of the original proprietors. Before the last French war, some who intended to settle here, began to work upon their lands, but the breaking out of that war put an entire stop there∣to. Towards the close of that war some people began to work here again; and in the year 1762 several families moved into the place; the first of which came in, in the month of June. Its in∣crease was truly surprising, for in less than three years, it was incorporated with distinct town priv∣ileges; and in the close of the year 1767, there were about forty families in the town. The number of families at this time is 195, and the number of souls about 1130; besides that, there were a number of families with their estates set off to aid in forming the district of Orange, in the county of Hampshire. As early as the year 1766, on the 13th day of October, a congregational church was imbodied here, under the counte∣nance, and in the presence of the churches in the vicinity; and on the 19th of October, 1768, the first and present pastor, the Rev. Joseph Lee, was ordained to the work of the gospel ministry among them.</P>
<P>There were nine or ten families of the baptist denomination among the first settlers. At what
<PB N="263" REF="026481_0262_0FD04FED8D3AA478"/>
time they imbodied into a church state is not known to us. A Mr. Elisha Rich was their teach∣er, but he was never ordained among them. He was succeeded by Mr. Whitman Jacobs, who was installed December 13th, 1770. He lived in A∣thol, to which town part of his society belonged, and there he now resides. Mr. Moses Kinney is now the ordained teacher of the baptists in Roy∣alston.</P>
<P>The lands in this town consist generally of hills and valleys; and the soil is very excellent, being suitable for tillage, pasturage, mowing and orchard∣ing. The natural growth of wood is of various kinds, as oak, chesnut, beech, ash, white, black and yellow birch, maple, or sugar tree, bass, alder, and the ever greens, as pine, hemlock, hacmatack and spruce, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This town is exceedingly well watered by riv∣ers, rivulets and springs. Miller's River runs through this town from the east. And there are a number of considerable brooks or streams, which uniting, form what is called Tully River in Athol. In the southerly part of the town one of the streams which helps to form Tully River, has very observable falls. In the course of forty or fifty rods, the whole fall of water is more than a hundred feet. In one place it is twenty feet, or more. On these several streams before mention∣ed are large quantities of rich interval, or excel∣lent meadow lands.</P>
<P>There are two ponds in the town; one small, a little west of the meetinghouse; the other about
<PB N="264" REF="026481_0263_0FD0576008CD6EE8"/>
a mile further westward, called <HI>Long Pond.</HI> A small stream runs out of the lesser into the greater.</P>
<P>Although the distance between these ponds is but little more than half a mile in a direct line, yet the little pond is at least an hundred and fifty feet higher than the other. There are in both ponds, various sorts of fish, and in great plenty; those in the larger are most excellent. The dis∣tance of this town from Boston is, by the nearest route, about seventy miles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the northwest; and from the courthouse in Worcester it is forty miles, and is bounded on the north, by the State line▪ on the east, by Winchendon; on the south, by Gerry and Athol; and on the west, by Athol and Warwick.</P>

<HEAD>ASHBURNHAM.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 10th of June, 1735, a grant was made by the General Court, to Thomas Tile∣stone and others, for and in consideration of ser∣vices done by officers and soldiers of the ancient town of Dorchester, in the expedition to Canada in 1690, under Capt. John With<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ington. This grant was to be equal to six miles square, and went by the name of <HI>Dorchester Canada,</HI> until its
<PB N="265" REF="026481_0264_0FD05787CFBACB60"/>
incorporation, which was on the 22d of February, 1765, when it received its present name. To the original grant were afterwards added Lexington farm of a thousand acres, Cambridge farm of a thousand more, Rolfe's farm of six hundred, and another of about a thousand acres.</P>
<P>The church of Christ in Ashburnham was gath∣ered April 23d, 1760, and the same day the Rev. Jonathan Winchester was ordained their first pas∣tor. This gentleman was somewhat advanced in life when he was settled in the work of the minis∣try; and he continued but a short space therein, leaving the world November 25th, 1767. To him succeeded in the sacred office and work, the Rev. John Cushing, who was solemnly consecrat∣ed hereunto November 2d, 1768. In the town there are about twenty families of baptists, who manifest far greater catholicism than formerly. The whole number of families is about 150, and of inhabitants about 970, besides a number who were set off to Ashby, in the county of Middlesex, with about 3000 acres of land, and a number to the town of Gardner, with about 2000 acres more.</P>
<P>In this town are situated two large hills, or mountains, <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Little Wetatick.</HI> Great Wet∣atick lies in the northeast part of the town, and Little Wetatick to the southwest from it.</P>
<P>There are seven ponds within the limits of Ash∣burnham, which divide it nearly into two equal parts, north and south. Two of them are large, viz. Great and Little Naukheag. The others are not distinguished by any particular names. Here
<PB N="266" REF="026481_0265_0FD057618809F3F0"/>
are no rivers; but these ponds are sources of sev∣eral streams, which take different routes, and con∣tribute to the formation of several large rivers. From Little Naukheag, which is near the centre of the town, a rivulet empties into Great Naukheag, whence a stream issues to the west, which makes part of Miller's River. About three quarters of a mile east of Little Naukheag begins another stream, which runs southeast, and joining in Fitchburg with another stream from Westminster, and other small streams, helps to form the north branch of Nashaway River. Northeast from this last men∣tioned stream, arise two more, which, joining soon, run through Ashby into Newipswich, in the State of Newhampshire, and become a large branch of Souheagan River, which empties into the great river Merrimack. Hence it appears that this town is upon the height of land between Connecticut river on the west, and Merrimack on the east. And what is worthy of particular notice is this, that scarce any water runs into this town: It be∣ing conjectured that all which comes in, from all quarters, would pass through a man's boot. On streams issuing from three of the ponds in Ash∣burnham, there are mills, and a fine seat for more on the stream which runs out of Great Naukheag, not yet improved. On the banks of Little Nauk∣heag is a white sand, equal in sineness and white∣ness to that on the banks of Capeanne, and which it is judged would make glass.</P>
<P>There is much broken land in this town. Some parts abound in hemlock, spruce, white and pitch
<PB N="267" REF="026481_0266_0FD0578947D1CCF0"/>
pine; this is the case more especially in the wes∣tern part; however, there is much good land for grass. Where the growth of wood is oak, hard and soft maple beach, birch and chesnut, the land is moist and good for grazing. It has been a not∣ed place for lumber: The best pine timber is most∣ly worked up: There yet remain great quantities of white and pitch pine, suitable for boards. There are five saw mills, and four corn mills in the town. Here are potash works, and have been from its infancy; and the first complete ton of this article carried into market was from Ashburnham. Here are no remarkable springs, or other natural curiosi∣ties. They have an elegant new meetinghouse. The former house of publick worship was, about twenty years ago, wrecked by an hurricane, and moved three or four feet to the north and east; a barn, about sixty rods to the south, was torn down, while the owner within it escaped unhurt. This hurricane passed from the west to the east, extend∣ing about half a mile in width, and upon the hills swept all before it. The town enjoys a fine air, and is remarkably healthy.</P>
<P>Its distance from Worcester, is thirty miles to the north; and from Boston, by the nearest route, is fifty five miles, but through Lancaster and Stow, it is sixty miles, and lies to the northwest.</P>

<HEAD>PAXTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was taken from the towns of Leicester and Rutland, in nearly equal parts; and was incorporated on the 12th of February, 1765, when it received its name.</P>
<P>The ecclesiastical state of this town has been somewhat singular, from the gathering of the church of Christ in the place, to the present time, as will appear by the following account.</P>
<P>The church in Paxton, was imbodied September 3d, 1767. The Rev. Silas Biglow was ordained their first minister the same year, viz. October 21st, 1767. He was much beloved and respected by the people of his charge, but the Great Head of the church suffered him to continue but a little more than two years in office, being removed by death, November 16th, 1769.</P>
<P>He was succeeded in the work of the gospel min∣istry by the Rev. Alexander Thayer, who was solemnly separated hereunto on the 28th of No∣vember, 1770. Mr. Thayer continued not quite twelve years with the people, being dismissed from office August 14th, 1782.</P>
<P>They were destitute, after this, of a settled min∣ister for more than three years, until September 8th, 1785, when the Rev. John Foster was ordain∣ed their third pastor; at which time the town was in a most unhappy divided state, there being but a bare majority for Mr. Foster; the other party
<PB N="269" REF="026481_0268_0FD0578AC9866678"/>
dissenting, and protesting, utterly refused to hear him, and were by law exempted from contributing to his support. In this situation the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ople re∣mained for three years and a half, until April, 1789, when Mr. Foster was dismissed from his pastoral relation to the people.</P>
<P>Mr. Foster was, in about three years after, in∣stalled at Taunton, in the county of Bristol.</P>
<P>After Mr. Foster's removal from Paxton the parties amicably reunited, and are in a way for the happy resettlement of the gospel ministry among them.</P>
<P>If the people do but continue united, they are able to support the gospel in a very honourable, generous manner: For the town, though not large, is well settled, being an excellent tract of land, and the inhabitants in general are industrious, good, and wealthy farmers. It is pleasant, although uneven, having many hills and valleys; but the soil is rich and productive: It is good for all kinds of grain, and well repays the labour bestowed upon i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: It is peculiarly good for grass and pasturing, and like∣wise for orcharding. The high lands are moist and springy, not too rocky; and the lower lands are swamps or meadows, but easily drained. The wood which grows on the higher lands, is oak, much walnut, some chesnut; and in the lower lands, are found birch, beech, maple and ash. It is truly noticeable that the wood in this town, when cut down, never sprouts again, in conse∣quence of which they are threatened with a scar∣city of fuel.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="026481_0269_0FD057648A7BD680"/>The town is exceedingly well watered by springs from the hills; and by small streams, on which they have both corn and saw mills. From the same spring, about half a mile north of the meet∣inghouse, waters issue, which soon divide and take quite different and contrary directions; part runs northeasterly into the river Nashaway; part runs southwesterly into Connecticut river. There are two hills in the town of great height, and worthy of particular mention: One is called Turkey Hill, near Rutland line, this is large, and affords good farms; and especially fine pasture land: At the foot of this hill, on the west side, lies Turkey Hill Pond, large, and well stored with fish; and from this pond runs a stream which empties into Chica∣bee River, and from thence into Connecticut river. On the east side of the town, and in that part which was formerly Leicester, is situated what is called Asnebumskit Hill, the foot of which, on the east side, falls within the bounds of Holden. This is a large and high hill, containing several hundred acres, the land is rich and good; especially adapt∣ed for pasturage. It lies about twelve miles south of Watchusett great hill, and except that, overtops all other hills within forty or fifty miles of it. Around this hill the vapours gather so plentifully, or become so dense the evening preceding a rain, that it appears at a distance as if it rained upon its summit. To this hill many of the farmers, in the vicinity, look at evening, or a little before the setting of the sun, in the time of making hay, that they may be able to determine with a good degree
<PB N="271" REF="026481_0270_0FD0578C4A7FF918"/>
of certainty, what the weather will be the next day. Near the foot of this hill, is situated Asnebumskit Pond; which is a fine large pond, and well suppli∣ed with fish: From this pond there issues a stream, which runs to the northeast through Holden, and joining the stream from the foot of Watchusett Hill, helps to form the south branch of Nashaway River. From springs, on the northwesterly part of Asnebumskit Hill, a stream is formed, which run∣ning southerly, passes through Leicester, and so to French River. The above observations shew us that Paxton is situated on the height of the lands between the sea, on the east and south, and Con∣necticut river on the west.</P>
<P>In Paxton, works for making potash have lately been set up: And here a small number of cotton and wool cards are annually made.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in this town was found in 1791, to be 558.</P>
<P>Paxton is situated eight miles west from Wor∣cester, and about fifty five from Boston, a little to the south of west. It is bounded on the north, by Rutland; on the east, by Holden; on the south, by Leicester and Spencer; and on the west, by Oakham and Rutland.</P>

<P>THIS was the north part of the town of Westborough, the main part whereof was set off from Marlborough in the year 1717. It was made the second precinct or parish of Westborough by an act of Court, on the 20th of October, 1744.</P>
<P>The church of Christ was gathered in this place May 21st, 1746, and on the same day the Rev. John Martin was ordained their first pastor, who continued to minister unto them in holy things until April 30th, 1767, when after a short sickness he died in the 61st year of his age, and the 21st of his ministry.

<P>Mr. Monis, as I suppose, the first Hebrew In∣structor in our University at Cambridge, was born in Italy. When he came into America I am not able to say. He married a Miss Marrett, of Cam∣bridge, who died in the year 1761; whereupon he
<PB N="273" REF="026481_0272_0FD0578E6C7F5F68"/>
resigned his office, and retired to Northborough, and spent the residue of his days in the family of the late Rev. John Martyn. Mrs. Monis and Mrs. Martyn were sisters. He left something very hon∣ourable and generous to the church in Northbor∣ough. He bequeathed forty six pounds thirteen shillings and four pence, to be equally divided a∣mong seven of the ministers then living in the vicin∣ity: Also, he left about an hundred and twenty six pounds as a fund, the interest whereof was to be dis∣tributed among widows of ministers who were in indigent circumstances; and the remainder of his estate, which was considerable, he gave to the Mar∣tyn family.</P>

<P>This second precinct in Westborough was in∣corporated February 24th, 1766, and from its local situation and bearing, was called Northbor∣ough.</P>
<P>There were settlers in this part of Marlborough before there were any in what is now Westbor∣ough. As early as 1700, or rather before, a few families had fixed down here. And there was a garrison kept at a house on the lower side of the town towards Marlborough, near the brook where Messrs. Bartlets now live. On August 18th, 1707, as two women belonging to the garrison were out a little way from the fort, gathering herbs, the In∣dians discovered and pursued them. One Mrs. Mary Fay, got safe into the sort; the other, Mary Goodenow, a young and unmarried woman, was taken and carried over the brook into the edge of Marlborough, and there, a little south of the great road, and nigh to Sandy Hill, so called, she was killed and scalped. The enemy were pursued by some soldiers and people of Marlborough; and were overtaken the next day, in that part of Lan∣caster, now called Sterling,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccount of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attle in the history of Lancaster and Sterli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> when a most bloody battle was fought, in which two of our people, John Farrar and Richard Singletary, were killed.

<P>The town of Northborough lies in a kind of valley between the high lands of Marlborough on the east, and those of Shrewsbury and Boylston on the west. On its easterly side it is about four miles long, and on its westerly about five: It is on an average about three miles and an half wide from east to west, containing about 90 dwelling houses, upwards of an 100 families, and accord∣ing to the late census 620 inhabitants. It would doubtless admit of 150 or more families, were the large farms (some of which contain four hundred or five hundred acres) properly divided. This is beginning to take place, and in a few years proba∣bly will be accomplished. The inhabitants are chiefly farmers, and wealthy: They have also traders in European and Westindia goods; and various tradesmen and mechanicks, especially an excellent maker of edge tools of various kinds; and considering its dimensions and number, it is doubtless one of the ablest parishes in the county. The poorest land in general appears as we travel the great road. The farms which lie off are good, and much of the land very fertile. The westerly side
<PB N="276" REF="026481_0275_0FD0576909EE6778"/>
of the town rises into high land, and the north∣west angle is very high; but the land is not rocky, and the farms are excellent, and from thence the prospect is extensive. There is one beautiful hill, called <HI>Liguor Hill,</HI> containing towards an hundred acres of land, very good, opposite the meeting∣house, and not more than sixty or eighty rods from it, on the south side of the post road. This is high, and seen from all the neighbouring towns; but it is not inaccessible even to teams. Its sum∣mit is covered with a fine growth of good wood at present. About one mile northeast from the meet∣inghouse is another hill, very similar, called Ed∣mund Hill. Upon the river Assabet, which runs through the easterly part of the town, are vast bodies of rich interval and good meadow lands. And upon the other streams and rivulets there are large and good meadows, especially on that called <HI>Cold Harbour,</HI> which rises in the north part of Shrewsbury, and crossing the southeast angle of Boylston, turns and runs southerly, then turns and runs easterly, and passing between the post road and meetinghouse, soon empties itself into the riv∣er Assabet. On the above named stream, in the westerly part of the town, are a corn and saw mill, one a few rods below the other, and as there is a small outlet from Rocky Pond, in the easterly part of Boylston, which empties into this Cold Harbour stream, so the owner of those mills, by means of a small dam at the lower end of said pond, furnishes them with a rich supply of water, although distant a mile or more. In the north
<PB N="277" REF="026481_0276_0FD05790C92F8060"/>
part of the town are a corn and saw mill together, on North Brook, which coming from a pond in Lancaster, and running through Berlin and the northeast angle of Northborough, falls into the river Assabet. A little north of the meetinghouse runs a small but lasting stream from the hills in the westerly part of the town, on which is a saw mill which performs considerable work in the spring and autumn. In the town there are two ponds; one called <HI>Solomon's Pond,</HI> from the cir∣cumstance of an Indian of that name being drown∣ed therein, by falling through a raft on which he was fishing. This is in the northeasterly part of the town. It is not large; about ninety rods long, and seventy five rods wide; has plenty of fish: To this pond there is no visible inlet nor outlet.</P>
<P>The other is in the southeasterly part of the town, called <HI>Little Chauncy</HI>; this also is well fur∣nished with fish. From <HI>Great Chauncy</HI> Pond, in the northeasterly part of Westborough, there is a small outlet which runs into <HI>Little Chauncy</HI>; and from <HI>Little Chauncy</HI> a brook runs northerly, and crossing the post road on the line between Marl∣borough and Northborough, and the boundary be∣tween the two counties of Middlesex and Worces∣ter, empties its waters into Assabet River, On this stream are a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and a saw mill together; and although it be small, yet by clearing it of obstruc∣tions, and a little digging in a few places, they are supplied with a large quantity of water from both
<PB N="278" REF="026481_0277_0FD0576A880A1330"/>
the ponds above named. About half a mile from the meetinghouse, on the post road, and on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver Assab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is a mill for the fulling of cloth; and works for carrying on the clothiers' business in all its branches, where about 7000 yards of cloth are annually dressed, and the work is most acceptably performed to the honour and advantage of the town, and the interest of the com∣munity. These works are the property of two brothers, Captains Samuel and Abraham Wood; but the business is performed at present by the latter only. On the opposite side of the road and river are works for the manufacture of iron, and where many tons have been made. There is in the vicinity a great plenty of ore, especially of the bog kind. Near the forge are works for the making of potash, where large quantities are man∣ufactured yearly. About a mile below, on this same river, is a grist mill which fails not to grind through the year. Thus there are four corn, and four saw mills within the town.</P>
<P>There are, in this town, curious works for the conveyance of water to a great distance, the prop∣erty, contrivance, and execution of Major Hollo∣way Taylor. I know not that there are any simi∣lar works in the county, and would therefore de∣scribe them.</P>
<P>From springs issuing out of ledges of rocks on rising lands, this gentleman has raised a small pond, and from thence brings fine water (about seventy rods, through bored logs, under ground, not only in low lands, but in some places higher
<PB N="279" REF="026481_0278_0FD0579247FBAF98"/>
lands, where the water repeatedly ascends and de∣scends) into the back part of his house, into a large vat, near three feet in height, by a tube, from the last log, entering the bottom of the vat, which is, or may be kept constantly full, and run∣ning over; and the superfluous water is conveyed from the vat, by another tube, out on to the grass land. As the water passes under ground nigh the barn yard by a tube from a log, entering the bot∣tom of a large trough, he has a rich supply of wa∣ter for a great stock of cattle; and such is the qual∣ity of the water that it has seldom ever been known to freeze in trough or vat.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As this account may be read by some not much acquainted with natu∣ral philosophy, and who therefore may think it incredible that water can be made to pass over rising grounds, and through low lands, alternately, as in this case, and then rise to such a height in the house; (for these logs are carried along under ploughed fields and mowing lands;) for the sake of such it ought to be observed, that water may be conveyed any where, to rise exactly to the height of the fountain or pond from whence it proceeds; al∣though it cannot be carried to a greater height in its way to the place in∣tended.</P>
<P>Should any persons wish to convey water in this manner, they may be in∣formed, that yellow or pitch pine logs are much best for the purpose; they are harder and more durable; those of chesnut are too spungy and porous.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The general growth of wood in the town is chesnut, walnut, the several sorts of oak, some white pine, and large quantities of pitch pine, which of late years, is in great demand, as an ex∣cellent wood for fuel.</P>
<P>Northborough lies about thirty six miles from the Statehouse in Boston, and is eight or nine degrees to the south of west; and is ten miles from the courthouse in Worcester, a few degrees to the north of east. This town is greatly benefited by
<PB N="280" REF="026481_0279_0FD0576C46483338"/>
the publick roads, which in different directions pass through it. Besides the post road from Bos∣ton to Worcester, (and so to the seat of govern∣ment,) which runs through it but a few rods south of the meetinghouse; there is another from New∣hampshire State, and the northern part of the county of Worcester, and coming through Lan∣caster or Harvard, and Bolton and Berlin, passes directly through this town, just by the meeting∣house, and crossing the post road, leads on to Mendon and Providence. The road also from Worcester and Shrewsbury, through Framingham to Boston, passes through the south part of the town into Westborough. There is also a road of much travel from Hubbardston, Princeton, Hol∣den, Sterling, and especially Boylston, which coming in upon the northwesterly part of the town, passes directly in front of the meetinghouse, and then in the space of about fifty rods, falls in∣to the post road.</P>
<P>Another great benefit the town reaps, is from the great resort of people from all the neighbouring towns to the corn and saw mills, to the fulling mill and forge, and to the blacksmiths', for their works of various kinds, as well as to the shops and stores.</P>
<P>Northborough is bounded on the north, by Ber∣lin; on the east, by Marlborough and Southbor∣ough; on the south, by Westborough; and on the west, by Shrewsbury and Boylston.</P>

<HEAD>HUBBARDSTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was called "the northeast quarter of Rutland," being wholly included in the original grant of that town, and was incorpo∣rated on the 13th day of June, 1767, and called Hubbardston, to perpetuate the name and memo∣ry of the late Hon. Thomas Hubbard, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Boston, who had been sometime speaker of the house of Representatives; after that, several years a counsellor of the then province, and for many years treasurer, and of course a member, of the cor∣poration of Harvard University in Cambridge. He was a large proprietor of lands in this place.</P>
<P>The congregational church in Hubbardston was imbodied on the 13th of June, 1770, and on the same day the Rev. Nehemiah Parker was ordain∣ed to the work of the gospel ministry in the place, and who still continues in peace and love with the people, and ministering to them in holy things.</P>
<P>We proceed to a description of this place. It is about six miles square; and is bounded west, by Barre; south, by Rutland; east, by Princeton: northeast, by Westminster; and north, by Gard∣ner, Templeton and Gerry. The town is agreea∣bly interspersed with hills and valleys. Perhaps about a twelfth part of it is meadow and interval. The uplands are generally, excellent for grazing and some considerable part very good for the
<PB N="282" REF="026481_0281_0FD0576D87FAA5F8"/>
growth of English grass. The land in general, is not the best for grain; though in common years a sufficiency is raised for the inhabitants. It is rather too cold for orcharding, although there are a number of flourishing orchards in the town, and some years a considerable quantity of cider is made. Hills there are several in the town, how∣ever, but two which we shall notice: The largest, in the northwesterly part of the town, extends quite through it, from Templeton to Barre; this is call∣ed Burnshirt Hill, and is most excellent land. The other is called Read's Hill, situated about one mile and an half east from the centre of the town; this is also very good land.</P>
<P>It is supposed this town is rich in iron ore, at least; there is a hill in the north part of it, extend∣ing into Templeton,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this also noticed in the account of Templeton.</NOTE> where a number of gentle∣men from Boston and other places, wrought near fifty years ago. They dug several rods into the hill, in quest of a silver mine; but whether it an∣swered their expectations or not, was not divulged. A war commencing put a stop to their pursuit, and it has never since been reassumed.</P>
<P>The town is finely watered by springs, streams and rivers; There are five rivers and streams no∣ticeable, which pass through the town from north to south. The most easterly of these is called Piss River, part whereof comes from Westminster, and part from the west side of Watchusett Hill in Princeton. The next is called Ware River, which heads in Hubbardston. The next is a smaller stream, called Meadow Brook, which takes its rise
<PB N="283" REF="026481_0282_0FD05796381E2E30"/>
in the north part of the town. Further west is an∣other stream called Conneystow Brook, which has its source in Templeton. The most westerly stream is known by the name of <HI>Burnshirt River,</HI> the principal branch of which comes from Gerry. All these streams running a southerly direction, unite in the east part of Barre, where their names, as well as waters, are swallowed up in Ware Riv∣er. <HI>Otter River,</HI> so called, which rises in Temple∣ton, runs in the north part of this town, and then turning, falls back into Templeton, and at length, unites with Miller's River.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this more particularly described in the account of Templeton.</NOTE> On these rivers and streams, within the town of Hubbardston, there are eleven saw mills, five grist mills, and one clothiers' works. There are also works for making potash in the town.</P>
<P>There are three ponds in Hubbardston. The largest of these, known by the name of the Great Asnaconcomick Pond, is about two miles from the centre of the town, to the east: It is a mile and a half in length, from north to south; the breadth is various, from half a mile to five rods, supposed to cover about three hundred acres. About half a mile further to the northeast, is situated Little Asnaconcomick Pond, of a circular form; and what merits particular notice is this, that for a considerable part of the way round this pond, there is every appearance that once a stone wall was built, or building. In some places it is two feet and an half in height, as if laid up by the hands of men; and where there is not one
<PB N="284" REF="026481_0283_0FD0576F081296E0"/>
stone upon another, the appearance is as of a large stone wall thrown down. If this was the work of art, when and by whom it was performed, or wherefore, perhaps can never be ascertained. Both the Ponds before described are fed by small springs. There is a small outlet from each. An∣other small pond is situated about a mile north∣west from the centre of the town; it is called <HI>Natty Pond,</HI> which has both an inlet and an outlet. The growth of wood in this place is chiefly white pine and pitch pine in great plenty, hemlock, beech, maple and oak; there is but little of any other sort.</P>
<P>The town is settled in general, with industrious farmers; and they are become numerous, and are increasing in wealth. There are about 150 fami∣lies, and near 1000 souls in the place.</P>
<P>Hubbardston is situated sixty miles, nearly west, from Boston; and twenty from the courthouse in Worcester, to the northwest. A road much used, leads through the town from the south to the north, in which people pass from Rhodeisland, &amp;c. &amp;c. to the western part of Newhampshire, and to the State of Vermont. It is also in contemplation to open a road from the towns on Connecticut river, in the county of Hampshire, through Petersham, to Hubbardston, and so on through Princeton and Lancaster, to Boston. This undoubtedly, would be the nearest route, from Hadley and towns adja∣cent, to the metropolis of the Commonwealth.</P>

<HEAD>NORTHBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of Northbridge takes its name from its situation and bearing with respect to Uxbridge, from which it was chiefly taken; five or six families only being set off to it from Sutton south or first parish. It is about five miles in length, and about four in width; and is bounded, by Uxbridge, on the south; by Sutton, on the west; by Grafton, on the north; and by Mendon and Upton, on the east and northeast. It was in∣corporated on the 14th of July, 1772. It is not large, having, at the time of the late enumeration 83 houses, and 570 inhabitants. The congrega∣tional church here was imbodied, June the 6th, 1782, and on the 25th of June, 1783, the Rev. John Crane was ordained their pastor. Here also there is a society of Baptists of about ten families; at present destitute of any settled teacher. There are also within the town twelve families of Quak∣ers, and two or three of the Universalists.</P>
<P>We shall proceed to some Topographical De∣scription of this place.</P>
<P>It is uneven and somewhat rocky and rough; but the land and soil, in general, rich, strong and good. As it has alternately, high and low lands, it is well calculated for orcharding, for pasture and grass land, and bears rye, Indian corn, oats, flax, &amp;c. Hills there are none high, or, on any account remarkable. The meetinghouse ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
<PB N="286" REF="026481_0285_0FD0577088148310"/>
stands on an eminence, and commands a good prospect for four or five miles round. As the lands in general are high, the air is salubrious, and the inhabitants have been blessed with great health from the first settlement of the place.</P>
<P>There are no stagnant waters or ponds in the town: But it is finely watered by springs, streams and rivers. Two of these are noticeable: Black∣stone River, which originates in Sutton, and pass∣ing through the westerly part of Grafton, enters this town, and runs from north to south the whole length of the town, on the westerly side thereof. This is a large and fine river; and upon this there are great bodies of very excellent interval lands: Some of these are high, and bear corn and flax; the lower are good for grass.</P>
<P>There is another river, not so large, which en∣ters this town in the southwest part from Douglass, and joins Blackstone River. On this river there is a quantity of valuable meadow: But the land ad∣joining the meadow is not the most fertile.</P>
<P>There are within the town, two corn mills, one saw mill, and one forge, where much work is per∣formed.</P>
<P>The growth of wood, on the high lands is very valuable, consisting of walnut, oak and chesnut; that on the low lands is less valuable, but like that of other towns in general; the quantity of pine timber is small. The people here subsist chiefly by farming; they have the cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acter of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ous and flourishing people; and it is said there is
<PB N="287" REF="026481_0286_0FD0579847777408"/>
hardly an idle person, or a tavern haunter in the place.</P>
<P>Northbridge is situated forty three miles from Boston, nearly southwest; and from the courthouse in Worcester, it is twelve miles, lying about south∣east. The road from Boston, through Mendon and Oxford, to Connecticut, passes through this town: And the nearest and most direct road to Providence, from Worcester, would pass about half a mile west of Northbridge meetinghouse.</P>

<HEAD>BARRE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was the northwest part of Rut∣land Original Grant; it was made a district by act of the Legislature in the year 1749, and called Rutland District, until June 14th, 1774, when it was made a town, and the name of <HI>Barre</HI> was given to it, as a token of respect to a great and worthy friend of America, at that time a member of the British House of Commons. Barre is bound∣ed on the north, by Petersham: on the east, by Hubbardston; on the southeast, by Rutland; on the south, by Oakham; on the southwest, by Newbraintree; and on the west, by Hardwick.</P>
<P>The church of Christ in this place, was gathered July 30th, 1753, and the Rev. Thomas Frink was
<PB N="288" REF="026481_0287_0FD04FFE0B402850"/>
installed their pastor, on the last Wednesday in October following. Mr. Frink was the first minis∣ter of Rutland, and being dismissed from thence, he was installed a pastor of the third chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch in Ply∣mouth November 7th, 1743, where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontinued but a little time before his remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al. He continu∣ed in the ministry at Barre, but about thirteen years, being dismissed from his sacred office, by advice of an ecclesiastical council July 17th, 1766. He was succeeded in the pastoral office at Barre, by the Rev. Josiah Dana, who was consecrated hereunto October 7th, 1767. Mr. Dana con∣tinues in the work of the gospel ministry in this place, and in peace and esteem with the people of his charge.</P>
<P>The following sorrowful occurrence took place in this town. In March, 1780, the house of Mr. Peter Bent was consumed by fire in the night, with almost every thing contained therein, and two of his children, a son and daughter, of adult age, perished in the flames.</P>
<P>The town of Barre is large in extent, being rather more than six miles square: And it is one of the best townships of land in the county; the soil is exceedingly rich and strong. The land in general, is very hilly and uneven. The hills, in∣deed, are not so very high, but some are steep, and being somewhat rocky, the roads are not so good: But this is commonly the case in most towns where the soil is excellent, and moist: The town is well watered by numerous springs and rivulets, and the people enjoy great advantages for turning
<PB N="289" REF="026481_0288_0FD057AF8B50CA20"/>
and conveying the water over their grass land. The soil is peculiarly adapted to mowing and pasturage; and here they fat great multitudes of cattle, and make the best of beef. Here also they have many and large dairies; and it is supposed that more butter and cheese is carried from hence into the market, annually, than from any other town of the same extent. The soil bears Indian corn well; but it is not so well adapted to English grain as some other places. However, they raise a sufficiency of all kinds for themselves, and con∣siderable for exportation. As the town is uneven and hilly, it affords no large and commanding view of itself, but from the hills there is an extensive prospect into other towns. The pleasantness of Barre consists in the richness and fertility of the land, and the large, handsome, well finished build∣ings of all kinds; but from no one place can many of them be seen at once. The farms are large, and very productive: The people are indus∣trious, and they have great encouragement to la∣bour: Their modes of husbandry are good, and there are sure indications of wealth and opulence all over the town. And indeed it is one of the fore∣most towns in the county, there being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut three which pay more to a State tax. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome nu∣merous, having, when the late census wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken, upwards of 1600 inhabitants, although but one re∣ligious society; and they have the largest meeting∣house in the county, fifty six by seventy four feet.</P>
<P>The general growth of wood in the town, is large and plenty, consisting of oak of all kinds, especial∣ly
<PB N="290" REF="026481_0289_0FD04FFF8E365DE0"/>
an unusual proportion of white oak; consider∣able chesnut, some walnut; birch, beech, ash, white pine, pitch pine, some hemlock, &amp;c. There is one large river, called Ware River, which com∣ing from Templeton, through the westerly part of Hubbardston, passes through the easterly and southerly parts of Barre, and then runs into Hard∣wick. There is also a stream originating in Gerry which runs through the town on the easterly side, within a mile of the meetinghouse, called Pleasant Branch: This falls into Ware River, in the south part of the town. In the north part of the town, on the westerly side, rises another stream from springs, which is called Moose Brook, which runs into Hardwick, and there empties itself into Ware-River. On these streams there are some meadows, and very good interval lands on Ware River in the southerly part of the town. On this river, and on these streams there are four grist mills, sev∣eral saw mills, and clothiers' works.</P>
<P>The people in Barre subsist, mainly, by farm∣ing; here are, however, all the usual tradesmen and mechanicks, and two or three dealers in Eu∣ropean, East and West India goods; here also the pot and pearl ash works are carried on.</P>
<P>Barre is situated sixty six miles from Boston about west; and it is about twenty four miles from the courthouse in Worcester, about northwest.</P>

<P>THIS place was not an original grant, but was taken from several other towns, as Wor∣cester, Oxford, Sutton and Leicester, together with a gore of land lying between Oxford and Leices∣ter, not previously belonging to any town. On the 23d of June, 1773, this place was erected into a poll parish, and commonly called the south parish of Worcester. The parish was limit∣ed and bounded in the following manner: It was to extend three miles into Worcester, as the roads were then trod; three into Oxford, and three in∣to Leicester by their roads, and one mile and an half into Sutton, from the meetinghouse place. This place as above described, was incorporated and made a distinct town, and vested with all the privileges which other towns enjoy, by an act of the Legislature, April 10th, 1778, when it received the name of Ward, as a compliment to the Hon. Major General Artemas Ward, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Shrewsbury, and now Representative of this county in the Con∣gress of the United States of America. The town is bounded northerly on Worcester; easterly, by Grafton; southeast, by Sutton; south, by Ox∣ford; and westerly, by Leicester.</P>
<P>The church of Christ in Ward was imbodied on the 25th of January, 1776; and on the 3d of No∣vember,
<PB N="292" REF="026481_0291_0FD050010C3EDB70"/>
1784, the Rev. Isaac Bailey was ordained to the pastoral care thereof, and still continues in the sacred office.</P>
<P>We shall now present the reader with a Geo∣graphical Description of the town of Ward.</P>
<P>It is considered, by good judges, as a most excel∣lent tract of land: The soil in general is fertile, rich and strong, suitable for orcharding and all kinds of fruit; well adapted to pasturage and mowing, and produces large crops of rye, oats, wheat, barley, Indian corn, and flax. It is not very rocky; but affords stone sufficient for fenc∣ing in the farms: It is not level, but rather une∣ven, abounding in hills and valleys. The hills, however are not high; but the lands on them are good. Part of the hill, called Prospect Hill, to the south, lies within this town; also part of the hill, called <HI>Boggachoag,</HI> to the north; and part of the hill, called <HI>Grassy Hill,</HI> to the southeast of the meetinghouse. On and near these hills, there are very fine farms. The general growth of wood is oak of the various sorts, chesnut, walnut, on the high lands; and in the lower lands, pine, maple, cedar, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The town is as well watered, by springs and pe∣rennial rivulets, as perhaps any other town in the county. The course of the streams is circuitous, and so meandering as greatly to benefit the town. The principal stream is that which is called French River. There is another called Kettle Brook, which passes through the town. On these streams there are four saw mills and two grist mills, within
<PB N="293" REF="026481_0292_0FD057B28840EA40"/>
the town, also one clothiers' works; besides which there is a wind mill erected on <HI>Prospect Hill,</HI> which does considerable work.</P>
<P>There are three or four small ponds in the town, the largest of which covers perhaps, about thirty acres, situated about a mile south of the meetinghouse. There is an outlet from this pond, to the north, usually called Dark Brook; and there is an inlet from the south, while the pond is in its natural state, but by an artificial raising of this pond about four feet, the current in the inlet is reversed and the discharge of water is to the south.</P>
<P>The town is not large, but it is wealthy; there are about 80 houses; about 90 families, and when they were numbered there were 473 souls: It is situated fifty five miles from Boston, a little to the southwest; and five miles from the courthouse in Worcester, almost south.</P>

<HEAD>MILFORD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS place was the northeasterly part of the ancient town of Mendon: It was set off from Mendon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a precinct, or parish, in the year 1741, and was commonly known by the appella∣tion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mill River.

of April, 1780. Soon after it was made a parish, a congregational church was here gathered, viz. on the 15th of April, 1741, consisting of twenty six male members; and on the 21st of De∣cember, 1743, the Rev. Amariah Frost, was sol∣emnly invested with the pastoral office in the place. Some time after the settlement of Mr. Frost, a separation took place here; a Mr. Hovey preached to the disaffected, and was ordained a∣mong them. He tarried but a few years; since his time preaching by itinerants and lay∣men, and meetings held occasionally on the sabbath, have been continued among them. A number, not large, believing in the salvation of all men, have kept up publick meetings, and some∣times had preaching. There are a few anabaptists in this place, and but one family of friends or quakers. The Rev. Mr. Frost continued the wor∣thy and faithful pastor of the congregational church in Milford, until March 14th, 1792, when he died in the seventy second year of his age, and the forty ninth of his ministry.</P>
<P>An addition to, and a general repair of their meetinghouse was made in 1792, and it is now a very decent and convenient building.</P>
<P>There has been greater candour and moderation of late between those of different sentiments in this town, than formerly was discovered; and it is hoped greater unanimity will take place in the re∣settlement of the gospel ministry among them.</P>
<P>We proceed to a Geographical Description of the town of Milford.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="026481_0294_0FD057B4378CFA50"/>Milford is situated on the easterly side of the county; and is bounded on the north, by Hop∣kinton; on the east, by Holliston, in the county of Middlesex; on the southeast, by Bellingham in the county of Suffolk; on the west, and southwest, by Mendon; and on the northwest, by Upton. It is situated southwest from Boston, at the distance of thirty four miles; and from Worcester courthouse, it is southeast, distant twenty miles; and it is twenty five miles from Providence.</P>
<P>The town of Milford is not a level, champaign tract of land, neither yet is it very hilly and uneven; there is indeed, one large hill, a little from the centre of the town, to the southeast, called Bear Hill. This is mostly very good land. The whole of the north part of the town is high and good land; it rises by a gradual ascent; and from the highest places there is a large and varie∣gated prospect; from these heights may be seen the Watchusetts and Monadnock mountains, as al∣so the hills south of Boston. This northern part was a purchase from the Indians, by the proprietors of the ancient township of Mendon; and was com∣monly called the North Purchase. This part is the most distant from the meetinghouse in Milford; and in this quarter, the sectaries in the town have usually held their religious meetings. The northern and western parts of the town, especially, are rough and rocky; but the soil is generally strong and good; and well adapted to orcharding, grass and pastur∣age, and suffers but little by a dry season. They raise grain here of all kinds in sufficient quantities
<PB N="296" REF="026481_0295_0FD05004BAC55190"/>
most commonly for themselves; but their articles of produce for market, are chiefly butter, cheese, pork, beef, &amp;c. perhaps equal in quality to any in the county. There are but few mechanicks in the place, and seldom more than two traders in Eu∣ropean and India goods. The people subsist main∣ly by the business of husbandry, and are industri∣ous and good livers. The town is supposed to contain about as much as five miles square. There are 135 dwelling houses, and 840 inhabitants in the town, according to the late census.</P>
<P>There are two rivers running through this town, from north to south, nearly parallel with each other, about one mile and an half distant, in some places not so much; one on the west, the other on the east side of the town: These have their sources in the high lands beforementioned, in the borders of Hopkinton. That on the west is called Mill River, the name by which this place was de∣signated until its incorporation, this is large, run∣ning through the easterly part of Mendon, it passes to Providence. That on the east is a principal branch of Charles's River, which soon turns and runs easterly, and falls into the sea in Boston har∣bour. Mill River is the outlet of a large pond, said to be a mile in length, partly in Milford, but principally in Hopkinton and Upton, called North Pond. There is another pond, a little more than a mile from the centre of the town, called Cedar Swamp Pond; this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all, though there be plenty of fish therein, as in the other; the branch of Charles's River spoken of above, runs directly through
<PB N="297" REF="026481_0296_0FD057B58BBCC2C0"/>
this pond. There are very good meadows, and in∣terval lands upon the borders of both the rivers described before, as well as small pieces in other parts of the town, which are a singular advantage to the farmers. The town abounds in springs, rivulets and brooks in all parts▪ And on the riv∣ers and streams they have four grist mills, three saw mills, one clothiers' works, and one trip hammer within the limits of Milford.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in this town is oak of all sorts, chesnut, walnut, &amp;c. there is very little pine or cedar at this day.</P>
<P>The roads in this town are not good, especially for carriages; but they may be made in time, much better than at present.</P>
<P>We shall close our account of Milford, with mentioning, that in this place was born Alexander Scammell, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who graduated at Harvard Univer∣sity, A. D. 1769; who was appointed a survey∣or of mast timber, &amp;c. in Massachusetts, and province of Maine, under the British government; was Brigade Major in the American army, in 1775; a Colonel in the year 1777, at the taking of Gen. Burgoyne, and Adjutant General of the army at Yorktown, where he was unfortunately wounded in reconnoitering, September 30, 1781, just before the surrender of Lord Cornwallis, of which wound he soon after died.</P>

<HEAD>STERLING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was for many years, the second parish in Lancaster, and was commonly called <HI>Chockset.</HI> It was made a separate parish in the year 1743, and remained united with Lancaster until April 25th, 1781, when it was incorporated by act of the Legislature, and received its present name, in compliment to Lord Sterling, of Newjersey, who served as a General in the American army, in the late war between Greatbritain and these United States. This is a large, populous, and wealthy town; is about seven miles in length, from north to south, and six in width from east to west. It is situated about five miles from Lancaster, a little to the south of west, on the road to Princeton. It is bounded by Holden and Princeton on the west; eight miles from Holden, and seven from Prince∣ton, six miles from Boylston, which lies to the south of it; and from Leominster, on the north, it is seven miles.</P>
<P>This town is rather hilly and uneven, though there is very little broken, or waste land in it. It is not very rocky, but a most excellent, fertile soil, producing in rich abundance, to repay the hus∣bandman for its cultivation. The high lands are excellent for all kinds of fruits, especially apples; and here are large orchards; also, for grass and
<PB N="299" REF="026481_0298_0FD057B707D8CA00"/>
grazing; for the land is naturally moist, and by the help of the rivulets, the water may be turn∣ed over the sides of most of the hills. As the town is very uneven, there is no extended prospect. Nevertheless, the fertility of the soil, the high de∣gree of cultivation, and the interspersion of hills and valleys, afford peculiar gratification to the eyes of observing travellers. The meetinghouse is in a valley; and on the road, in this valley, there is a large collection of tradesmen and mechanicks and they are lively, active and industrious.</P>
<P>But the bulk of the people are large farmers, and, as the bounteous Author of Nature has blessed them with a fruitful soil, they have great encouragement to labour. Though the town be hilly, as above observed, yet there are bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo worthy of particu∣lar notice. The first is <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stone</HI> Hill, so called from the colour of the stones which are upon it.</P>
<P>This lies about a mile from the meetinghouse, on the road leading from Sterling to Lancaster.</P>
<P>The second is called Justice's Hill, which is sit∣uated about four miles northwest from the meet∣inghouse, on the road leading to Westminster.</P>
<P>There is but one river in the town, called <HI>Still River,</HI> from the slow motion of its waters; for after it enters this town, it runs in a vale for sev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral miles, with but a small descent. The waters which form this river, are furnished from three distinct sources. The western branch issues from the foot of Mount Watchusett, in Princeton, and after various meanders, and receiving accessions by sev∣eral rivulets, which originate in the eastern side of
<PB N="300" REF="026481_0299_0FD0504B4DECAE98"/>
Princeton hills, joins the others a little north of the road leading from Sterling to Princeton. This branch bears the name of <HI>Hartwell</HI>'s <HI>River,</HI> upon which are several valuable mills. The middle branch originates in <HI>Gardner</HI>'s <HI>Meadows,</HI> which are in the northeastern part of Princeton; This is the largest of the three branches; and carries several mills. The eastern branch which is called <HI>Justice</HI>'s <HI>River,</HI> has its source in the southwesterly part of Leominster; and taking its course, through justice's Meadows, which lie on the west side of Justice's Hill, and receiving several brooks, emp∣ties itself into the main stream, or <HI>Still River.</HI> Af∣ter the confluence of these branches the river takes a southern direction along the western side of Ster∣ling, for several miles, until it enters Boylston, thence taking a circuitous route through the wester∣ly and northerly parts of Boylston, loses its name in Nashaway, or Lancaster River. On the banks of this river in Sterling there is some pitch pine plain, some meadow and interval land.</P>
<P>There is one considerable stream in the northerly part of the town, which running an easterly course, empties itself into the north branch of Nashaway.</P>
<P>There are two considerable ponds in Sterling; one lies by the county road to Worcester; the other, a little to the southeast of this: These are divided by a neck of land of about forty rods, in width, at the narrowest place; through this neck a small stream runs, affording a passage for the fish from one pond to the other. From the western pond issues a considerable stream, sufficient to car∣ry
<PB N="301" REF="026481_0300_0FD057B88C562848"/>
a mill, which goes from November to May, but no longer, as the mill pond would flow a large body of meadow. These are called <HI>Waushacum Ponds:</HI> They are very deep in some places. Each pond, upon the most exact computation, is about one mile, and a quarter in diameter. The eastern is the largest; but the western the most pleasant, on several accounts; as it is not surrounded with hills like the eastern; and as it has in it an island, containing about half an acre of land, where fish∣ing parties often repair to regale themselves with fish, which these ponds afford in plenty.</P>
<P>There are two or three things, not to be forgot∣ten in giving the history of Sterling: One is, that near the neck of land which divides Waushacum Ponds, on the south side, was formerly an Indian fort; and near this, there was a place where they buried their dead. The ruins of the fort, and the graves were very discernible, until within a few years past, when by ploughing the ground those vestiges of antiquity and barbarism have disappear∣ed. On this very spot was the palace, and Royal seat of Sholan, Sachem of the Nashaways, and proprietor of Nashawogg.</P>
<P>Another thing to be mentioned is this; that about three miles northwest from the meetinghouse, on the road leading to Westminster, is a place called <HI>The Indian Fight,</HI> in consequence of a most bloody battle fought there between the English and Indians, on August 19th, 1707; the particulars of which we gave in the account of Lancaster, to which the reader is referred.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="026481_0301_0FD05059905DF8D0"/>A third thing not to be omitted, and a most sor∣rowful Providence indeed, is the burning of the house of Mr. Josiah Wilder of this town in Janu∣ary 1740; in which conflagration his wife, (preg∣nant, and near the time for her delivery) with four small children besides, perished; another child, a son, the father plucked as a brand out of the burn∣ing, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing a hole through the side of the house, ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here the bed was, in which this child lay, and pulled him out thereat, while the room was full of fire and smoke. This child was almost suffocated; but was soon recovered and lived many years.</P>
<P>The growth of wood in Sterling is most excel∣lent, and of the following sorts, oak of the several kinds, walnut, chesnut, on the high lands; and the usual sorts in the low lands and swamps, as birch, maple, ash, &amp;c. The white pine timber is chiefly cut off, and there is not much pitch pine remaining, and at this day, but little of the yellow pine.</P>
<P>We proceed to give some account of the ecclesi∣astical state of this town.</P>
<P>The church of Christ here, was imbodied on December 19th, 1744, and on the same day their first minister, the Rev. John Mellen, was ordained, who continued with them until December 14th, 1778, when his pastoral relation to them, was dis∣solved, by mutual agreement. Soon after, the Rev. Mr. Mellen was installed pastor of the church and people at Hanover, in the county of Plymouth, where he continues to great acceptance. To Mr.
<PB N="303" REF="026481_0302_0FD057BC8DD3A470"/>
Mellen, succeeded in the sacred work of the min∣istry, the Rev. Reuben Holcomb, whereunto he was solemnly separated on the 2d of June, 1779, and who still continues their pastor.</P>
<P>In Sterling died Mr. Sebastian Smith, a native of old Spain, on the 24th of March, 1765, in an advanced age. He came young into this country and living a single life, he devoted his considera∣ble estate to pious and charitable uses. Several years before his death he gave to the society, a fo∣lio Bible, that a portion of the holy scriptures might be read, on Lord's days, to the congregation. He gave much to the poor in his life time; and by will also: And likewise furnished the com∣munion table, with two silver tankards; and gave one hundred pounds sterling as a fund for school∣ing the more indigent children and youth. As such deeds come up as a memorial before God, so they ought to be kept in remembrance among men.</P>
<P>Sterling is distant from Boston, about forty six miles, nearly west; and from the courthouse in Worcester, it is twelve miles a little to the north∣east. At the time of taking the census in 1791, there were in the town 209 dwelling houses, and 1428 inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>BERLIN.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 13th of April, 1778, an act passed the General Court, incorporating a second parish in the south part of Bolton. And on the
<PB N="304" REF="026481_0303_0FD05799CB320EF0"/>
16th of March, 1784, this precinct was erected in∣to a district by the name of <HI>Berlin,</HI> at which time several families, with about five hundred acres of land, were added, from the northwest corner of Marlborough, and annexed to the county of Wor∣cester. Since that time, a few families have been added to this district from the southeast part of Lancaster. This district is invested with all the immunities and privileges of a town, excepting on∣ly that of sending a representative to the General Court; but it has the liberty of joining with Bol∣ton in the annual choice of representatives. Here a church was imbodied, under the direction of an ecclesiastical council, by a covenant bearing date April 7th, 1779; and on September 26th, 1781, the Rev. Reuben Puffer was ordained to the pas∣toral care thereof.</P>
<P>There is one pond in the east part of the district, called <HI>Gate</HI>'s <HI>Pond,</HI> nearly a mile in length, and from a quarter to half of a mile in width; it abounds in the usual pond fish; and a good sand is taken up near its shores: No brook empties into it, but at the south end there is a small outlet, which falls into the river <HI>Assabet.</HI> There is also a large swamp, containing many hundred acres, ly∣ing mostly within this district: It is a low, sunken tract of land, but bears, however, spruce of a great height, and in some parts of it, white pine timber. The most valuable uplands are seated on several hills, which afford excellent pasturage and orch∣arding. Wheat has been raised on some of them to great advantage. One lies near the above
<PB N="305" REF="026481_0304_0FD057BD4D6EFED0"/>
named pond, and contains a number of very fine farms. The others are a broken range of hills, which, beginning about a mile south of the meet∣inghouse, run westerly until they meet with North∣borough hills, then stretching in a northern direc∣tion, cover, with a few intersections, all the west and north parts of the district, and thus they con∣tinue through Bolton and Harvard, to Littleton in the county of Middlesex. A few of the bluff points of these high lands have been distinguished with arbitrary names, but no name applies to the whole range. The culture of hops has lately been introduced here, and by the experiments already made, bids fair to prove a profitable branch of husbandry. On the farm of the Hon. Samuel Baker, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in the northerly part of the district, is found a quarry of most valuable stone, of a light gray colour, out of which that gentleman has built a handsome, large mansion house. These stones are remarkable for an excellent quality which re∣sisteth the effects of fire.</P>
<P>The principal stream, and the only one worthy of particular mention, is called <HI>Northbrook</HI>; it is formed of two small streams, from the southwest, and northwest which uniting about a mile and an half west of the meetinghouse, afford a convenient seat for saw and grist mills, where considerable business is performed. Taking thence a southeasterly direction, it runs upwards of two miles, through a large and rich interval, and after passing through the north∣east corner of Northborough, where there are also mills, it soon falls into the river Assabet at the
<PB N="306" REF="026481_0305_0FD0579B5541E118"/>
southeast angle of the district. Northbrook is from two to three rods in width, and of considera∣ble depth; and formerly it yielded great quantities of the various sorts of fresh water fish, but they are of late exceedingly diminished.</P>
<P>The district consists of ninety two families, of which fourteen are of the sect called quakers. The latter are mostly industrious, and some of them wealthy farmers. The number of its inhabi∣tants, by the late census, was 512. It lies thirty four miles from Boston, nearly west, and fifteen miles from the courthouse in Worcester, to the northeast. Berlin is bounded on the north, by Bolton; on the east, by Marlborough; on the south, by Northborough; and on the west, by Boylston and Lancaster.</P>

<HEAD>GARDNER.</HEAD>
<P>GARDNER is a town which was taken from the towns of Westminster, Templeton, Winchendon and Ashburnham, and is accordingly bounded by them, in the following manner; by Westminster, on the south and southeast; by Tem∣pleton, on the southwest and west; by Winchen∣don, on the north and northwest; and by Ashburn∣ham on the northeast.</P>
<P>It was incorporated, and made a distinct town on the 27th of June, 1785. It is not large in ex∣tent,
<PB N="307" REF="026481_0306_0FD057BEDCA121D0"/>
its contents being about 14000 acres, but yet capable of making a good and wealthy town; hav∣ing already 85 dwelling houses, and 530 inhabi∣tants, according to the late census.</P>
<P>The church in Gardner was gathered on the 1st of February, 1786, and the Rev. Jonathan Osgood was ordained as pastor thereof, October 19th, 1791.</P>
<P>This town was called Gardner to perpetuate the name and memory of the late famous Col. Thom∣as Gardner of Cambridge, near Boston, who was killed in the memorable battle upon Bunker's Hill, in Charlestown, on the 17th of June 1775, gallantly fighting in defence of the liberty and rights of his country.</P>
<P>The general face of this town is uneven, abound∣ing in small hills and valleys; and though the land be somewhat rocky, yet not in general, too much so; the soil is good, rich, strong and fertile. It produces wheat, rye, Indian corn, barley, oats, flax, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is peculiarly adapted to grass and pasturage, being naturally moist and abound∣ing in springs, rivulets, streams, brooks and rivers, whereby they can water the lands at pleasure.</P>
<P>There is one river, called <HI>Otter River,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this river more particularly described in the account of Templeton.</NOTE> running from the south to the north; coming from Hub∣bardston, through a part of Templeton to Gardner, it is some way a boundary between Gardner and Templeton, and, in Winchendon, falls into Miller's River. There are several brooks and streams, with∣out names, except two; these are called Pen Brook, and Spectacle Brook; all the waters run north∣erly
<PB N="308" REF="026481_0307_0FD0579DACE86238"/>
and northwesterly, and are finally emptied in∣to Connecticut river. Upon these several streams, and the river beforenamed, there are considerable bodies of good meadow land; and a number of saw and grist mills; but no other water works at present. There are two large and fine ponds in the town, but without names; these have, each of them, small streams running from them. They have here the usual artificers and traders; and here also are potash works. The general growth of wood in this place, is similar to that of other new places of like kinds of lands, both high and low, as oak of several sorts, birch, rock maple, white and red ash, hemlock, white pine, and hacma∣tack. There are two county roads leading through the town; the principal one, is that which leads from Connecticut river, through Petersham, Ger∣ry and Templeton, on to Boston. This town lies sixty miles from Boston, northwesterly; and twen∣ty six miles from Worcester courthouse, to the north.</P>

<P>This town is not a very large tract of land; and it does not lie in the most regular form; it contains 14396 acres by survey, not being five miles square.</P>
<P>It is bounded by Shrewsbury on the south; by Worcester, on the southwest; by Holden and Sterling, on the west and northwest; by Lancaster on the north; and by Berlin and Northborough, on the east.

<PB N="310" REF="026481_0309_0FD0579F0FD22FA8"/>
pastor until April 23d, 1793, when at his earnest desire and request, the church and congregation consented to his dismission, in the presence, and under the direction of a mutual council. Mr. Fairbank was installed pastor of the church and congregation of Wilmington in the State of Ver∣mont, September 11th, 1793.</P>
<P>We shall now attempt some description of the town of Boylston.</P>
<P>It lies in general, high, descending to the north, and northeast; but the land is not so high in the middle, and round about the meetinghouse, as it is on the east, south and west. It is rather hilly, rough and uneven; although there are some con∣siderable plains, covered with pitch pine. The hills on the east side, adjoining to Northborough, are large and high, and pretty steep where the road passes; and although there is considerable broken land in the town, yet none but what is good for, and well covered with wood, of which there is a plenty. The wood which grows on the high and hard land, is of all the sorts of oak, some walnut, plenty of chesnut, some sassafras; in the swamps and swales, grow some ash, birch, maple, spruce, juniper, some white pine and some hemlock. The prickly ash also, is a native of this place; it is a bush or shrub, seldom growing more than six or seven feet in height; though it grows in moist, yet not in cold land; it possesses some singular qual∣ities and virtues, and its bark and seeds are highly esteemed, and much used, by Physicians.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="026481_0310_0FD057C189A8DAC8"/>The soil in this town is generally good, rich and fertile. There are good arable lands; but it is very excellent for orcharding, for pasturage and grass; and here are some of as large and good farmers, as perhaps any where in the county, who keep great stocks of cattle. The people raise all kinds of country produce, especially beef, pork, grain, butter and cheese, vastly more than they consume, and carry more into the market, than perhaps, any other town of its bigness and number. The town enjoys a fine healthy air, and the place has been famed for the longevity of its inhabitants. There are really no stagnant waters. There are two ponds, but the waters are kept in motion by a current, in consequence of inlets and outlets. Rocky Pond, so denominated from its general stony bottom, and more stony shore, is situated in the easterly part of the town from whence there is an outlet at the south end, into Cold Harbour Brook, and so into the river Assabet, in Northbor∣ough. This is a fine pond for all kinds of small fish, especially pickerel. It covers about thirty six acres of ground as appears from actual survey; and by the dam at the south end, the pond is rais∣ed so as to cover thirty acres of meadow. Sewall's Pond, so denominated from a family of that name, who owned the lands round it, lies in the south∣west part of Boylston, towards Worcester. This is large, covering a hundred acres of land perhaps, or more. It is well supplied with all kinds of pond fish; there are two rivulets, from springs which run into it, from the north and northeast;
<PB N="312" REF="026481_0311_0FD057A08917F508"/>
and at the south is the large outlet, which crossing the roads to Rutland and Worcester, in Shrewsbu∣ry, falls into Quinsigamond, or Long Pond. There are three small brooks in the town, which originat∣ing from springs in Boylston, run northerly into the south branch of the river Nashaway. Gates's Brook empties into the river in the west part of the town, near to Major Beaman's. Muddy Brook empties in about a mile west of the meetinghouse. On this brook there is a saw mill, and a body of meadow. Mill Brook, on which there is also a saw mill, rises and falls into the river in the easterly part. The great south branch of the river Nashaway runs through Boylston from the northwest, and passing southeast∣erly, till it comes within about a mile of the meet∣inghouse, then turns and runs northeasterly, into Lancaster. This river is formed by the junction of two large streams or rivers. One comes from the east side of Watchusett mountain, and passing through the southerly part of Sterling, and called Still Water River, is, on the road at the bridge, the boundary between Sterling and Boylston, and run∣ning southeasterly about a mile in Boylston, is joined by Quinepoxet Stream, so called: This runs from a pond, called Quinepoxet on the south side of Princeton, partly in Holden, and running southeast in Holden about two miles, turns and runs northeast, until it joins Still Water, on the west side of Boylston. After the confluence of these streams, there are four large bridges, on the river within Boylston; two of them are good, handsome str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng and well constructed. On the
<PB N="313" REF="026481_0312_0FD04FFD39888FB8"/>
west side of the town, after the two streams unite, there is a saw mill; also a corn mill with two pair of stones; likewise a fulling mill, and clothiers' works, where a vast deal of business is performed. In the northeast part of the town, on this river, are two corn mills, a saw mill, an oil mill, and fulling mill, together with a trip hammer, all close togeth∣er. These are famous for their construction, and for the work they do.</P>
<P>On this river, within the town of Boylston, are large bodies of most excellent and rich interval lands, to the number of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 acres; about 1000 in one body. On these lands the people raise vast quantities of Indian corn, flax, and some hemp, besides the immense quantities of hay and feed they yield. The wood yet remaining on these lands is butternut, buttonwood, shagbark, some ash and maple.</P>
<P>There is a small eminence a little southwest from the meetinghouse, which overlooks all the high lands in the town, called Diamond Hill, from the great number of stones upon it which look like diamonds, and with which they have actually cut glass; and which might be of use and importance if properly attended to. There are, in several parts of the town, large quarries of stone which are easi∣ly dug up, and many of them split, of all shapes, sizes, and lengths; they have excellent faces, for underpinning to houses, and for door stones, and steps, but they are too hard to admit of being much wrought upon. Many of them are of a great length, and far superior to any hewed stones. It was
<PB N="314" REF="026481_0313_0FD057A2082DEEE0"/>
both pleasing and astonishing to see the collection of these stones, in their natural shapes, which they collected for the underpinning of the new meeting∣house they have lately erected.</P>
<P>Manufactories they have none, except of potash. Roads they have two or three called county roads of considerable travel, leading to Worcester, to Providence, and also to the Boston market. The people subsist chiefly by farming; and many of them are become very wealthy indeed. It may be styled a rich town, for they are not only clear of debt, but have several hundreds of pounds in their treasury, which, with proper management, would, in a few years, produce an adequate fund for the support of a publick teacher of piety, religion and morality. And if they continue united and peaceable, they will soon vie with the town from whence they were taken; nay, they would soon equal almost any of the towns in the county. There are 150 families in the place; and when the census was taken, there were 840 inhabitants, A social library has lately been established here. It is in its infancy; but bids fair to be something considerable in a little time. Upon the whole, if this be not so pleasant a place as some others, the people are industrious and prosperous, and there are sure indications of wealth and independence among them; and they may be happy if it be not their own fault.</P>

<HEAD>GERRY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was taken chiefly from Tem∣pleton, and as we said in our description of that town, was set off as a separate, or distinct parish, on the 16th of February, 1774. It lies on the west∣erly side of Templeton, and between that and Pe∣tersham. This parish, together with the southeast∣erly part of Athol, was incorporated with distinct town privileges October 20th, 1786, and had the name <HI>Gerry</HI> given it, out of respect to the Hon. Elbridge Gerry, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a representative of this Com∣monwealth, in the Congress of the United States. The settlement of the gospel ministry, with all the ordinances and institutions of Jesus Christ, in this place, was greatly retarded by the unhappy contro∣versy between Greatbritain and the then Ameri∣can colonies, and the war which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in 1775 and lasted nearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight years. However, on the 16th of November, 1785, a church was gathered here. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the presence and under the di∣rection of an ecclesiastical council; and the Rev. Ebenezer Tucker was ordained as the spiritual watchm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and overseer of the church and flock of God in this place, November 5th, 1788.</P>
<P>The town of Gerry is pretty uneven, consisting of hills and valleys, but in general, an excellent and rich soil, but especially good for grass and pastur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge. Two miles west of the meetinghouse is situated a very fertile hill, large in extent, call∣ed
<PB N="316" REF="026481_0315_0FD057A46F680838"/>
Prospect Hill, from the extensive view it affords of the adjacent towns and country. There is an eminence on this hill which overlooks all the high lands for many miles round: And from hence are seen in a clear air, without the help of glasses, the meetinghouses in eight or nine different towns. On this hill, there are many noble farms. The in∣habitants of this town except the usual mechanicks, subsist by farming, and the lands richly repay their labour. It is now in a flourishing state; and ca∣pable of becoming numerous and wealthy, and contains 14,000 acres of land. The number of the people, when the census was taken, was 740.</P>
<P>It is well wooded and timbered, bearing oak of various sorts, chesnut, white and pitch pine, birch, beech, ash, and some walnut. Here also are potash works. This town is exceedingly well watered by perennial streams and rivulets. About a mile east of the meetinghouse, is situated a large and fine pond, abounding with the various sorts of fresh water small fish. This has no observable inlet; but from the northeast end of this pond there is an outlet running through meadows, to the south∣east, which takes the name of Burnshirt in Temple∣ton, as mentioned in the description of that town, and is the west branch of Ware River.</P>
<P>From three springs arise streams, which soon u∣nite and form New Brook, or Beaver Brook, near the middle of the town, which running northerly, soon becomes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> boundary line between Templeton and Gerry as much as three or four miles, then en∣tering
<PB N="317" REF="026481_0316_0FD057C5492DF1F0"/>

<P>In the westerly part of Gerry, from springs, rises a stream which forms the main branch of Swift River, running southwesterly through Petersham.</P>
<P>Moccousin Brook, so called, rises likewise from springs in Gerry, runs through the easterly part of Petersham, and there empties into Swift River.</P>
<P>On these several streams and rivulets there are large bodies of excellent meadow and interval lands, which were a peculiar advantage to the people in beginning their new settlements.</P>
<P>This town is finely supplied with mills, having three corn mills, and four saw mills.</P>
<P>Gerry is situated about 65 miles a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le to the northwest from Boston, and about 30 from the courthouse in Worcester; bounded, by Petersham and Athol, on the west; by Royalston, on the north; by Templeton, on the east; and by Hub∣berdston and Barre, on the south.</P>

<HEAD>WOODSTOCK. [Formerly belonging to the County of Worcester.]</HEAD>
<P>HAVING completed our account of the several towns in the County of Worcester, we must suppose that the attentive reader observed the town of Woodstock was particularly named in the act for the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecting of this county, yet it has not been describ∣ed
<PB N="318" REF="026481_0317_0FD057A5CB35A100"/>
in this history. In order to give full satisfaction upon this subject, the following account must be subjoined. The settlement of the line of jurisdic∣tion between Massachusetts and Connecticut, though divers times attempted, was never fully ad∣justed until the year 1713. As early as the year 1636, the first settlers upon Connecticut river re∣moved from Massachusetts, and took possession of the country upon, and near the river on both sides, from Springfield as low as Wethersfield, inclusive of both, and managed their affairs by virtue of au∣thority from the General Court of Massachusetts. However, these lands were claimed by the patentees of Connecticut. But, in 1638, the inhabitants of Springfield (which included what was afterwards called Suffield, below on one side the river, and En∣field on the other side) having no doubt they were within the limits of the Massachusetts patent, petition∣ed the General Court that they might be separated from the other towns below, and be received and continued as part of the colony, which was granted, and jurisdiction exercised accordingly. In the year 1642, by order of the General Court, two per∣sons, Woodward and Saffery run the then prov∣ince line. This line seems to have been, for sev∣eral years, acquiesced in. And in 1662, Mr. Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦throp obtained from king Charles II, a charter for the colonies of Connecticut and Newhaven unit∣ed; the north line whereof is intended to be the same with the south line of Massachusetts. From this time, until after the incorporation of Massa∣chusetts by a new charter in 1691, we hear nothing
<PB N="319" REF="026481_0318_0FD057C6CA6D9610"/>
about bounds. In the year 1686, many of the in∣habitants of Roxbury pitched upon a tract of land to settle upon, which was bounded on the south by Woodward and Saffery's line, and it was grant∣ed to them by the Massachusetts government, and took the name of Woodstock. After the new char∣ter, Connecticut made a more serious affair of what was called the Massachusetts encroachments. Af∣ter various unsuccessful attempts to compromise this matter, commissions passed the seals of each government with ample powers to settle the con∣troversy. The Massachusetts were intent upon se∣curing the property to such persons to whom they had granted lands and the jurisdiction of those towns which had been settled by them. Suffield, Enfield and Woodstock were the only towns which could be affected. Connecticut was also appre∣hensive that part of the town of Simsbury, which had been settled by that government, might fall within the Massachusetts. It was therefore settled as a preliminary, that the towns should remain to the governments by which they had been settled, and the property of as many acres, as should ap∣pear upon a balance to have been gained by one government from the other, should be conveyed out of other unimproved lands as a satisfaction or e∣quivalent; only, as there were about two miles which Windsor claimed upon the town of Suffield, there having been a long contest between these two towns concerning the validity of the respective grants, it was agreed those two miles should be∣long to Connecticut if they fell within their line.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="026481_0319_0FD057A74A698AE8"/>"Nothing could be more equitable; nor tend more to the future peace and content of the inhab∣itants of the contested borders.</P>
<P>"It appeared, by the report of the commissioners, that 107,793 acres of land were due from the Mas∣sachusetts, who accordingly made a grant thereof to Connecticut. They accepted, and made sale of the same; and applied the produce to the support of Yale College, and other publick uses: And the controverted towns, for many years after, contin∣ued without molestation under the jurisdiction by which they were first settled."</P>
<P>The foregoing account is given upon the author∣ity and, chiefly, in the words of Governor Hutchin∣son, in his History of Massachusetts.</P>
<P>The lands granted to Connecticut were what are now called Pelham, Belchertown, &amp;c. in the coun∣ty of Hampshire.</P>
<P>Though the lands were granted to Connecticut, the jurisdiction thereof was to remain to Massachu∣setts.</P>
<P>After this equitable and amicable settlement in 1713, Suffield and Enfield, in the county of Hamp∣shire, and Woodstock, in the county of Worcester, were considered as belonging to Massachusetts, were taxed by, and paid their taxes to this Common∣wealth, and sent representatives to our legislature until the year 1748, when they revolted, and their representatives were, by a bare majority, admitted to seats in the General Assembly of Connecticut. Massachusetts, however, continued to tax them, (though they paid nothing) until the late revolu∣tion,
<PB N="321" REF="026481_0320_0FD057C848A0C938"/>
when this Commonwealth ceased to claim them.</P>
<P>The lands of these three towns, undoubtedly, fell within Connecticut patent; and Massachusetts had no right to grant them away: Yet, after so fair and equitable an agreement as was made between the two then colonies, and actual satisfaction made by Massachusetts to Connecticut, it may be questioned, whether the inhabitants of those towns acted gen∣erously and fairly in revolting, or the colony act∣ed honourably in receiving them. Be these ques∣tions answered as they may, by their revolt the line between the two States is now a straight line, running due west, from the northwest corner of Rhodeisland, until it meets Newyork State line.— Thus ends the history of Woodstock.</P>

<PB N="322" REF="026481_0321_0FD057A8C73955B0"/>
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING given an account of each town, I will subjoin a particular description of the several rivers, beginning at their sources, and fol∣lowing them to the Atlantick ocean.</P>
<P>Beginning at the north part of the county, the first is Miller's River, or Payquage River.—This has, properly, two sources; the principal source of it is a large pond, called Monomenock Pond, lying mostly in Rindge, in the state of Newhampshire, partly in Winchendon. The other source is a pond in Ashburnham, called Naukheag. These two branches, with various streams and rivulets from the adjacent country, which fall into them, unite in the northeasterly part of Winchendon, and form Miller's River, which runs an almost wester∣ly course through the southeasterly part of Royal∣ston, Athol, and between Wendell and Erving's land, and falls into Connecticut River between the towns of Northfield and Montague. Part of the waters of Ashburnham, Templeton and Gerry, and all of Gardner, Winchendon, Royalston and Athol, pass into this river. It is a large and beautiful stream, though in some places very rapid. This Mrs. Rowlandson crossed while a captive with the In∣dians. In her narrative she calls it <HI>Bayquage River.</HI> By a late act of cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a number of gentlemen are made a body corporate, for the purpose of build∣ing a bridge over this river near its mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="026481_0322_0FD057C9C7CD73A8"/>In the next place, a large branch of Souheagan River originates in Ashburnham; this runs north∣easterly through Ashby, at the northwest angle of the county of Middlesex; then into Newipswich in the State of Newhampshire, through Mason, Am∣herst, and between the towns of Merrimack and Litchfield is emptied into Merrimack River. This is a large stream, having its waters continually augmenting, by various streams, before it falls in∣to the river Merrimack.</P>
<P>The third in our course is the river <HI>Nashaway.</HI> This is formed by the junction of two main branches. The north branch comes, partly, by a stream from springs in Ashburnham, and runs southeasterly into Fitchburg; and, partly, from Watchusett Pond on the north side of that moun∣tain, which stream runs northerly, through the easterly part of Westminster, into Fitchburg, and there unites with the stream from Ashburnham; then turns and runs southeasterly through Leom∣inster into the middle of the town of Lancaster within a few rods of the meetinghouse. The south branch of the Nashaway is also composed of two streams: One from the east side of Watchusett Mountain runs southeasterly, through the south∣westerly part of Sterling, into the edge of Boyl∣ston; this is called Still River. The other comes from Quinepoxet Pond, partly in Holden, and runs northeasterly into Boylston, and uniting with Still River, on the westerly side of Boylston, con∣stitutes the south branch of Nashaway. This con∣tinues an easterly course until it comes within a
<PB N="324" REF="026481_0323_0FD057AA4BC7BF40"/>
mile and a half of Boylston meetinghouse; then it takes a northeasterly direction, through the south∣erly part of Lancaster, and there, in about half a mile east of the meetinghouse, forms a junction with the north branch. After the confluence of these two main branches, the river Nashaway runs northeasterly, between Lancaster and Harvard, and between Harvard and Shirley, into Groton and Pepperell in the county of Middlesex, then into Hollis, in the State of Newhampshire, and through Dunstable, and there falls into the river Merrimack. Nashaway is the largest and finest river which originates in the county of Worcester, and has the most rich and valuable interval and meadow lands upon its borders.</P>
<P>The next river we shall describe is <HI>Ware River</HI>; this originates in Gerry from a pond, and run∣ning easterly into Templeton, joins another stream, and runs south into Hubbardston, from thence in∣to Barre; and then it becomes a boundary between Hardwick and Newbraintree, and receiving Swift River from Petersham, it passes through the towns of Ware and Belchertown, and Kingston, and re∣ceiving Quaboag River, which comes from Brook∣field, it thence takes the name of Chicabee, and falls into Connecticut River in the north part of the town of Springfield. The waters of Gerry, part of the waters of Templeton and Princeton, all the waters of Hubbardston and Petersham; of Barre and Newbraintree; part of the waters of Rutland, Paxton, Leicester and Spencer; and all
<PB N="325" REF="026481_0324_0FD057CB4736D128"/>
of Brookfield, are emptied into Connecticut River, in the town of Springfield.</P>
<P>The river Quinebaug rises in the town of Brim∣field, in the county of Hampshire, and runs east into the county of Worcester, through Sturbridge and Charlton, and then, southeast, through the westerly part of Dudley, and so on into the State of Connecticut, where it joins French River.</P>
<P>French River has its principal source in Holden, and runs southerly through Worcester and Ox∣ford, and the easterly part of Dudley, then passes into the State of Connecticut, through Killingsley, Pomfret, Canterbury to Norwich, where joining other rivers, it takes the name of Thames River, and falls into the sea, or Longisland Sound, at Newlondon. Hence, the waters of Sturbridge, Charlton, Dudley, Oxford, and part of the waters of Holden, Worcester, Leicester, and Spencer, are emptied into the sea at Newlondon.</P>
<P>Blackstone River rises in the town of Sutton, and first runs northwest through Ward into Wor∣cester, and takes in various streams and rivulets in its course, then it turns and runs southeast, and receiving the river which comes from Shrewsbury Long Pond, it passes through Grafton, North∣bridge and Uxbridge, into Rhodeisland State, where with its various accessions of Swift River, West River, and Mumford's River, it takes the name of Pawtucket, or Narragansett River, and passes to Providence. All the waters of Sutton, Ward, Doug∣lass, Northbridge, Uxbridge, Upton, and part of the waters of Worcester, Shrewsbury, Milford
<PB N="326" REF="026481_0325_0FD057AC9BE910B8"/>
Mendon and Grafton, pass to Providence, and so on to the sea below Rhodeisland.</P>
<P>The river Assabet has its source in Grafton, and running across the northwest angle of Westbor∣ough, enters Northborough in the southwest part of the town, and running about half of a mile east of the meetinghouse, passes off through the northwest angle of Marlborough, and running through the southeasterly part of Stow, and the south part of Action it enters the westerly part of Concord, re∣ceiving various streams and rivulets in its progress, and there is called the north branch of Concord River. All the waters of Northborough, and part of those of Grafton and Westborough, and of Shrewsbury, Boylston and Berlin, pass in this riv∣er Assabet. The south branch, or Sudbury River, rises from a pond, and a large Cedar Swamp, in the southeast part of Westborough, runs into Hopkin∣ton, is the boundary between Southborough and Hopkinton, then passes through the middle of the town of Framingham into Sudbury, and so to Con∣cord, running a northeasterly course, and about one mile northwest from Concord meetinghouse, joins the north branch, then taking the name of Concord River, it passes through the northwest part of Bedford, and through the town of Billeri∣ca, about half of a mile west from the meeting∣house, and between Chelmsford and Tewksbury, falls into the river Merrimack. On the north side of Merrimack, are part of Tyngsborough, the towns of Dracut, Methuen, Haverhill, Almsbury, and Salisbury: On the south side, are the other part
<PB N="327" REF="026481_0326_0FD057CE1E1F6D00"/>
of Tyngsborough, and the towns of Chelmsford, Tewksbury, Andover, Bradford, Newbury and Newburyport, where this river falls into the sea.</P>
<P>Charles's River has its proper source in Hopkin∣ton, and runs south into Milford and Mendon, then turning, runs southeast, through a part of Bellingham, then takes a northeasterly course through the other part of Bellingha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Med∣way, and is the boundary between Franklin and Medway, as also between Medfield and Sherburne, and then passes through Natick and Needham, and between Weston and Waltham, on the north, and Newtown on the south; it also runs through Watertown, about half of a mile south of the meetinghouse, then into Cambridge, about half of a mile south of the College, and separating Rox∣bury from Cambridge, and Boston from Charles∣town, it falls into the sea in Boston harbor. Thus all the waters of the county fall into the rivers Merrimack, Connecticut, Newlondon, Providence and Charles's River. The height of land is in the towns of Ashburnham, Westminster, Princeton, Holden, Paxton, Leicester, Spencer and Stur∣bridge; on the west of these towns, all the water runs into Connecticut River only. In Ashburn∣ham the water runs three ways, west, northeast, and southeast: In Westminster and Princeton the water runs east and west; from Shrewsbury and Grafton, the water runs to Providence and Merrimack Rivers; very little passes out of this county into Charles's River.</P>
