<Q>REJOICE, <HI>O ye nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries; and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT there is a GOD, "is the prime foundation of all religion." We should therefore employ our ut∣most diligence to establish our minds in the stedfast belief of it. For when once we have firmly settled in our minds the belief of GOD'S being, it will mightily influence all our powers of action; it will invite our hope, alarm our fear, and address to every passion within us, that is capable of persuasion, and be in us a never-failing source of devotion and religion.</P>
<P>A GOD without a providence, is a solitary kind of being, and affords but gloomy apprehensions. For 'tis by his providence that all intercourse be∣tween GOD and his rational creatures is maintained,—therein he exercises and displays his perfections,—therein his power executes the contrivances of his wisdom, and his wisdom plans the methods of his goodness and grace, which open to the view and ad∣miration of the wise and good, through successive ages and generations.</P>
<P>BUT that branch of providence, which, in a pe∣culiar manner, demands our attention on this occa∣sion,
<PB N="6" REF="015776_0003_0F9A295D67E40D28"/>
and should excite our gratitude, is GOD'S un∣interrupted government of the rational part of his creation,—mankind in particular. For as all go∣vernment, so the <HI>divine,</HI> supposes laws, and laws suppose rewards and punishments, of which intelli∣gences only are capable.</P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, GOD interests himself in the affairs of mankind, and the universal administration of his providence extends to all his works, a large field opens for the employment of our contempla∣tive minds. And we are naturally led to consider this divine government, as respecting communities; the affairs whereof are important, and upon which the order and felicity of the world greatly depend.</P>
<P>GOD is the sovereign of the world, and disposes all things in the best manner. All blessings and ca∣lamities, of a public nature, and the revolutions of kingdoms and states, are to be viewed as under the special direction of heaven. Hence the scripture saith, that GOD "increaseth the nations, and de∣stroyeth them, he enlargeth the nations, and straitneth them again—sometimes he blesseth them, so that they are multiplied greatly; again, they are minish∣ed, and brought low, through oppression, affliction, and sorrow."</P>
<P>THESE truths being necessarily interwoven with religion, and extensively useful under the varying scenes of life, and misteries in providence—the main design of the present discourse, is to awaken our at∣tention to the passages of divine providence—and lead us to a religious improvement of GOD'S hand, in the tragical events that took place on the <HI>nine∣teenth</HI> of April, 1775. I mean the MURDEROUS
<PB N="7" REF="015776_0004_0F9A295E2A71A578"/>
WAR, <HI>rapine</HI> and <HI>devastation of that day,</HI> which we are now met to commemorate.</P>
<P>UNDER this visitation, or the greatest trials imagi∣nable, we have abundant consolation, that GOD rules in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of this earth.</P>
<P>THE words but now read, may be, perhaps, not unfitly applied to us, for comfort and encourage∣ment under GOD'S chastisements, and his usual con∣duct towards the enemies of his church and people:—"Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people." These are the concluding words of <HI>Moses</HI> his song, which setteth forth GOD'S works of mercy and judgment towards the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> his covenant people. And though, in their primary meaning, they respect that nation only, yet they may be accommodated and fairly applied to GOD'S faithful and obedient peo∣ple, at all times, and in all ages; inasmuch as the latter part of the prophecy reaches unto the latter days, and is not yet wholly fulfilled.</P>
<P>SOME interpret the former part of the verse thus,—"Rejoice ye nations, who are his people," suppo∣sing it to be a prophecy of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> becoming one body with the people of <HI>Israel;</HI>—because <HI>Moses</HI> had supposed in this song, great enmity between them, and that sometimes they had sorely plagued <HI>Israel;</HI> as at others, GOD rendered to them accord∣ing to what they had done unto his people: but now breaks out in a rapture of joy, to think that they should one day be reconciled, and made one people of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="015776_0005_0F9A29606803A318"/>
THE prophecy then before us, is not limited to the <HI>Israelites;</HI> but may be understood as extending to all GOD'S chosen, though oppressed and injured people, in all generations,—that he will recompense their wrongs—plead their cause—and do justice up∣on their enemies. And taking it in this latitude, we may collect several things from it, as worthy our notice, and pertinent to this occasion. Accordingly I observe,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THAT GOD, in the righteous administra∣tions of his providence, permits the sons of violence to oppress his saints and people; and, in their malice and rage, to attempt their ruin, by waging war with them.</P>
<P>GOD is a being of infinite power and inflexible justice, as well as consumate wisdom; and doth ac∣cording to his sovereign pleasure, in the paternal and moral world. He over-rules all things for his own glory, and in subordination to that, has a particular regard to the happiness of his covenant people:—His church and chosen are not without mistakes and errors, in this imperfect state—hence they are prone to degenerate and transgress—to be too regardless of GOD, and deficient in their obedience—nay, to be guilty of great wickedness. And it becomes neces∣sary, to punish such revolters from the ways of GOD, and purity of manners. Hence, when the all-wise GOD designs the chastisement and reformation of his backsliding people, he "visits their transgres∣sions with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes,"—and uses those methods, that shall best promote his moral government; inflicting this or that judgment, as pleases him. The divine providence then is to be devoutly acknowledged in all events, in all pub∣lic evils and calamities.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015776_0006_0F9A296128BB4EA0"/>
SOMETIMES there are visible marks of GOD's an∣ger and displeasure against his people. Their coun∣sels are divided, and their strength impaired—their enemies are permitted to distress and injure them—or they have been harrassed by the will and conduct of ambitious, designing men, who have contributed to the ruin of their country, even at the same time they pretend a mighty zeal for its interest:—Or, they are scourged by haughty <HI>tyrants</HI> and cruel oppressors:—Yet the hand of GOD, and his over-ruling provi∣dence is to be acknowledged in these things, as much as when a people suffer by famine, pestilence, earth∣quakes, storms and tempests, &amp;c. which are com∣monly regarded as the more immediate tokens of GOD's anger, and works of his providence.</P>
<P>IN all public evils, calamities and distresses of GOD's people, <HI>He</HI> in his providence, proceeds accor∣ding to equal rules, and for wise and salutary purpos∣es. Hence the promises of temporal blessings made to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> in case of their obedience to the divine commandments, and the threatnings of tempo∣ral evils and plagues denounced against them, in case of their disobedience, recited in <HI>Levit.</HI> XXVI, and <HI>Deut.</HI> XXVIII chapters; related chiefly to them as a body politic, because with regard to the public, they always took place. When religion and virtue flou∣rished among them, and they walked in obedience to the divine laws, they prospered, were successful in their wars, had great plenty, and all things conducive to their welfare and happiness.</P>
<P>BUT when they revolted from GOD, and were generally corrupt and dissolute, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> miserable, and a prey to their jealous and en∣vious neighbours. And it may be noted, in general,
<PB N="10" REF="015776_0007_0F9A2962A9CEE568"/>
that when public calamities were inflicted upon them, whether by the more immediate hand of Heaven, as drought, pestilence, famine, and the like; or, by instru∣ments in providence, as the hands of their enemies and oppressors; it was always as a just punishment for their national iniquities; their idolatry, irreligion and aboun∣ding wickedness. And upon their repentance and reformation, these calamities were removed, and their prosperity restored.</P>
<P>NOR was this course of providence peculiar to the <HI>Jews.</HI> The established rule of the divine procedure towards nations is ascertained in <HI>Jer.</HI> XVIII, 7, &amp;c. "At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it: If that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will re∣pent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.—And at what instant I shall speak concerning a na∣tion, and concerning a kingdom, to build, and to plant it; if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them."</P>
<P>WE are assured, in the oracles of truth, that 'Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin,' i. e. aboun∣ding vice and wickedness, "is a reproach to any peo∣ple." And with regard to mankind in all ages, may it not be said, that when a people have been re∣markable for justice, temperance, industry, and zeal for the public good, they have prospered in all their affairs, and been high in reputation? And, perhaps, no instance can be produced of a nation's being given up to exterminating judgments and calamities, so long as virtue, probity and religion flourished among them. But when falshood and perfidy, injustice and general
<PB N="11" REF="015776_0008_0F9A2963681A76D8"/>
corruption, with a contempt of religion, have general∣ly prevailed among them, they have fallen into many calamities, and been deprived of those advantages they so much abused.</P>
<P>THUS GOD, in a variety of ways, may correct and punish his degenerate people; and, among others, permit enemies to oppress them, <HI>shed blood</HI> in their land, and lay them waste.</P>
<P>IT by no means reflects upon the <HI>righteousness</HI> of GOD, that those whom he employs as instruments in the execution of his judgments upon a revolting, sin∣ful people, are themselves chargeable with injustice and cruelty; and have nothing in view but the gra∣tifying their own ambition, avarice and lust of power. And commonly they who are the authors, or perpe∣trators of such violence and severity upon a people, are afterwards, in GOD's time, justly punished in their turn, for their vices, their pride, wantonness and barbarity.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, if we make a religious improve∣ment of such dispensations, we shall resolve all into the good pleasure of <HI>Him,</HI> who is "higher than the highest," and has the absolute disposal of all in his hands. And however undeserving we may be of such unrighteous treatment from men, <HI>our fellow-mortals;</HI> yet we are to adore the great—the wise—the power∣ful GOD,—humble ourselves under his mighty hand,—accept the punishment of our sins,—learn righte∣ousness,—patiently bear the indignation of the Lord, and quietly submit to his providences; and, while his judgments are upon us, repent and reform, con∣fide in his almighty power, hope in his mercy, and plead his compassion and the riches of his grace, that
<PB N="12" REF="015776_0009_0F9A2964B53CB920"/>
in his own way and time, which is the fittest, we may see his salvation. Pass we, therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To observe, the dispensations of hea∣ven towards <HI>oppressors and tyrants,</HI> the enemies of GOD's people. "For he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adver∣saries,"—none shall hinder his proceedings, to be fully avenged of them.</P>
<P>HE is the supreme Lord, governor and judge of the world, therefore will he chastise offenders; to him belongeth vengeance,—therefore the wicked shall not go unpunished.</P>
<P>THE enemies of GOD's church and people, are GOD's adversaries. "The Lord's portion is his people,—he keeps them as the apple of his eye"—verses 9, 10, of the context. Whoever grieves or afflicts them, provokes GOD, for they are "his pe∣culiar treasure." And having a singular concern for them, he will be their shield and their defence, how∣ever they may be persecuted by their enemies. "For the Lord shall judge his people;" verse 36. i. e. plead their cause, and deliver them from the oppression of their enemies; as this phrase is fre∣quently used in the book of <HI>Psalms.</HI> He will have mercy upon his servants, and turn his hand, which punishes them, upon their adversaries.</P>
<P>THUS utter destruction is denounced upon <HI>Edom,</HI> for their unnatural enmity against the <HI>Jews,</HI> and cruelty towards their brethren, in <HI>Obad.</HI> ver. 10, "For thy <HI>violence</HI> against thy brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off forever."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="015776_0010_0F9A29650E5D8550"/>
To confirm our faith and hope in GOD, in trou∣blous times, in days of darkness and misery, it may be proper to look back, and devoutly contemplate that most signal act of divine providence, that when the primitive religion which had been derived from the beginning, was in danger of being lost among men, and the world became generally involved in gross superstition and idolatry, it pleased GOD to sin∣gle out a nation from the rest of mankind, and to erect them into a sacred polity, set apart by their fundamental constitution for the profession and wor∣ship, the faith and obedience of the one true GOD, in opposition to the worshipping idols or false dei∣ties, and to the worshipping the true GOD by images. The more effectually to awaken the attention of mankind, and to give the more illustrious confirma∣tion to that church constitution, it was wisely order∣ed, that in the founding and establishing of it, there were repeated and amazing exertions of the power of GOD.</P>
<P>AND the whole of that dispensation was admira∣bly so contrived, as to prepare the way for a more spiritual and perfect state of the church, which was to succeed it, and was to be more universally diffused; in the founding of which, providence interposed in a yet more remarkable manner, by a series of most astonishing events.</P>
<P>THROUGH the powerful influence of a wise pro∣vidence, events that were designed for the destruction of the church, have been made subservient to its greater stability. Thus <HI>Haman'</HI>s malicious, re∣vengeful plot, which threatned utter ruin to the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation and religion, was most marvellously over-ruled to contribute to the confirmation thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="015776_0011_0F9A2965A84203D8"/>
LIKEWISE the <HI>christian</HI> church, though the world ever was an enemy to it, has been firmly es∣tablished: It has been maintained against cruel per∣secution, and the greatest violence.—And though continually burning, it has not been consumed,—though tossed with tempests, and worried by its op∣pressors and adversaries, frequently passing through the furnace of affliction; yet it retains a form more bright and beautiful, as of the spouse of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the joyful mother of children, which no man can number.</P>
<P>INDEED churches are not perfect or compleat; they are apt to decline and transgress;—nothing therefore can be more equal and fit, than that GOD should, in his holy providence, manifest his righteous displeasure against backsliding churches that have fallen from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the power and purity of religion, into a state of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> happen that, in times of persecution, bloodshed and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar, the church may be reduced in its members, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the remnant may become more re∣fined, holy and heavenly. The faith and patience of the saints be more exercised, their zeal and piety more eminent, and practical godliness more gloriously appear. And then, in due season, GOD raiseth his church and people from their afflicted and oppressed state, and <HI>rendereth vengeance</HI> to their adversaries and persecutors. Thus <HI>Babylon</HI> of old was punish∣ed for her cruelty and oppression of the <HI>Jewish</HI> church. And thus shall it likewise be in the case of mystical <HI>Babylon;</HI> which, after having been long suffered to prevail, and to "make war with the saints of the most High," shall have a mighty downfall, wherein the vengeance and justice of almighty GOD,
<PB N="15" REF="015776_0012_0F9A2966694F7080"/>
shall be illustriously displayed; of which we have a striking description in XVIII. chap. of the Revela∣tion.</P>
<P>AND that we may be established in the faith of the prophecy before us, that GOD "will avenge the blood of his servants," and execute "vengeance up∣on their adversaries," we may advert to the animating promise of our blessed <HI>Saviour,</HI> in the parable of the <HI>unjust judge,</HI> who, neither fearing GOD nor regard∣ing man, was nevertheless prevailed on by the con∣tinual cries of the widow, to do her justice against her adversary; our Lord adds, <HI>And shall not</HI> GOD <HI>avenge his own elect?</HI>—Will he not much more be moved to vindicate his chosen and dearly beloved people, that cry to him day and night, under the cruel oppression of their insulting enemies, even though he may seem to <HI>bear long with them,</HI> to give them space for repentance? I tell you, he will cer∣tainly vindicate them, and when once he undertakes it, he will do it speedily too." Herein, "our condescending Lord only intended to intimate, that if the repeated, importunate cries of the afflicted, may at length prevail even upon an inhuman heart, they will be much more re∣garded by a righteous and merciful GOD, who is al∣ways ready to bestow his favours, when he sees we are prepared to receive them. We may rely upon it, that GOD will vindicate his saints. Let this en∣courage them, though the rod of the wicked may for a while rest on them—and let it intimidate the proud oppressors of the earth, who, in the midst of all their pomp and power, are so wretched, as to have the prayers of GOD's people against them."</P>
<P>WE have encouragement then, to hope in GOD,
<PB N="16" REF="015776_0013_0F9A296728596050"/>
that he will build up Zion—that he will appear still for us, under all our distresses and oppression—that he will <HI>avenge the innocent blood</HI> of our brethren, inhumanly shed in the beginning of the present un∣just war—that he will <HI>render vengeance to his</HI> and our <HI>adversaries</HI>—and one day restore tranquility to our country—that he will make our land "a quiet habitation," when we may view it in perfect peace, and free from all fears of hostile invasions. <HI>For,</HI> to use the words of the prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> "The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will save us." Hence we are natural∣ly led, in the last place, to observe from the conclud∣ing words of my text.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE kindness and compassion of GOD, to his penitent, praying and obedient people: "And will be merciful unto his land, and to his people."</P>
<P>THOUGH GOD chastise his people with the rod of his hand, or permit enemies to oppose and op∣press them, yet he will remember his holy covenant, and shew compassion to them, upon their humilia∣tion and repentance. This is illustrated in <HI>Neh.</HI> ix chap. wherein the <HI>Levites</HI> make a religious con∣fession of GOD's goodness, and the <HI>Israelites</HI> wick∣edness—greatly provoking GOD by their disobedi∣ence and rebellion against him, and contempt of his law; <HI>Therefore,</HI> as in verse 27, "Thou deliver∣edst them into the hands of their enemies, who vex∣ed them, and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from hea∣ven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them <HI>saviours,</HI> who saved them out of the hand of their enemies."</P>
<P>GOD will not "cast off his people, neither will he
<PB N="17" REF="015776_0014_0F9A2967E7FAB208"/>
forsake his inheritance: The Lord will not cast off forever—but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion, according to the multitude of his mer∣cies." He will arise, and have mercy upon <HI>Sion,</HI> when the set time to favor her, is come.</P>
<P>To represent the perpetual love of GOD to his church and people, the prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> utters him∣self in this rapturous strain, "Sing, O heaven, and be joyful, O earth, and break forth into singing. O mountains, for GOD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted"—chap. XLIX. 13. And speaking of their deliverance at last, saith, ver. 26. "And I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh, and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine, and all flesh shall know that I the Lord, am thy <HI>Saviour,</HI> and thy redeemer, the mighty one of <HI>Jacob.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE intention of GOD's severe dispensations be∣ing not the destruction of his people, but their amendment, it becomes them to acknowledge his hand, confess and forsake their sins, and importu∣nately seek to him for needed salvation.—Hence, we are frequently exhorted in scripture to repentance, as the surest way to obtain mercy from GOD; <HI>Job</HI> v. 17. "Behold, happy is the man whom GOD cor∣recteth; therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty—For he maketh sore, and bindeth up, he woundeth, and his hands make whole. He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in seven, there shall no evil touch thee. In famine he shall redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword."</P>
<P>THE corrections of his hand are the scourges of a faithful GOD, who retaineth not his anger forever,
<PB N="18" REF="015776_0015_0F9A2968A80266B0"/>
because he delighteth in mercy. To this purpose we have a more general exhortation to repentance, in <HI>Hos.</HI> VI. I. "Come, and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up." The same GOD that punisheth us, can only remove his judg∣ments, and shew us mercy. GOD will "speak peace to his people, and to his saints, if they return not again to folly—Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him."</P>
<P>AND the church of <HI>Christ,</HI> notwithstanding all oppression and persecution, shall one day break forth as the morning, clear as the sun, fair as the moon, and triumph over all its potent, cruel adversaries; even when the glorious things spoken of her, in the latter days, shall be accomplished;—corresponding to the prophecy of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> chap. lx. wherein describ∣ing the <HI>Jews</HI> restoration from captivity, takes occa∣sion therefrom to represent the glories of <HI>Christ's</HI> kingdom, which began upon the first publication of the <HI>gospel,</HI> but will not be compleated 'till the full∣ness of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are come into the church; and faith, "Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders: Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended: Thy people also shall all be righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation:—I the Lord will hasten it in his time."</P>
<P>FROM the proceeding discourse, in connexion
<PB N="19" REF="015776_0016_0F9A2969C4993B18"/>
with our context, arise the following truths, for in∣struction and improvement of the dispensations of heaven; and therefore proper for our meditation on the present occasion. As,</P>
<P>THAT we should extol the Lord of heaven and earth, who is possessed of glorious perfections, which render him the only fit object of our religious wor∣ship.</P>
<P>THAT we should acknowledge the infinite pow∣er of our GOD, and his sovereign dominion over all; and give honour and service to none other.</P>
<P>THAT his works of providence, no less than of creation, are most perfect; since he doth nothing without the greatest reason, and according to the rules of exact justice.</P>
<P>THAT we are ignorant of the methods and rea∣sons of GOD's judgments, that take place in the world.</P>
<P>THAT all the evil, and all the good, that befalls any man, or the whole church, proceeds from the just and equal administrations of divine providence.</P>
<P>THAT in GOD we may find a sure refuge, at all times, for he is in one mind, and changeth not.</P>
<P>THAT He will <HI>render vengeance to his adversa∣ries,</HI> and do justice to the enemies of his church.</P>
<P>THAT he will be merciful to his people, his hum∣ble, penitent, praying people, and will, in his own way and time, <HI>avenge the blood of his servants.</HI></P>
<P>THAT therefore we have abundant cause to <HI>re∣joice
<PB N="20" REF="015776_0017_0F9A296B2A37FFA8"/>
with his people;</HI> and to yield chearful and constant obedience to him.</P>
<P>THESE hints might be profitably enlarged upon; but I must leave the more particular improvement of them, to your own private meditations; and fall in closer with the design of this <HI>anniversary,</HI> which is to keep in mind a solemn remembrance of the origin of the present MURDEROUS WAR, and more espe∣cially of the <HI>innocent blood</HI> wantonly shed around this sacred temple; and the subsequent slaughter and de∣solation by <HI>British troops,</HI> on that memorable day, APRIL NINETEENTH, one thousand, seven hun∣dred, seventy-five: A day religiously to be regarded by all professed <HI>christians.</HI></P>
<P>THE distress and anxiety of the inhabitants of this town, and the adjacent, arising from the singular and horrid scenes of that dismal and dark day, tho' diminished by time, can never be effaced in the hu∣man breast.</P>
<P>WITH compassion and tender sympathy, we renew the sorrow and lamentation of the <HI>bereaved,</HI> for their deceased friends and relatives, who then fell a sacri∣fice, bled and died, in the cause of GOD and their country, by the sons of violence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of mur∣derers,—as multitudes have fallen <HI>since</HI> in our land,—whose blood we hope in GOD, he will speedily and righteously avenge, and restore peace and tran∣quility.</P>
<P>THE all-interesting events of that day,—that dis∣tressing day, have been painted in lively colours, by my <HI>worthy Brother:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. Clark, in his printed Sermon, preached <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 19, 1776, and his annexed <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>artial</HI> narrative.</NOTE>—and the leading steps, or
<PB N="21" REF="015776_0018_0F9A296BD250ACC8"/>
rather stretches of parliamentary power, and <HI>hasty strides</HI> of British ministerial vengeance, to reduce <HI>Americans</HI> to submission and <HI>object slavery</HI> (as intro∣ductory to this unjust and ruinous war) have been set in a striking point of light, by my <HI>Rev. Father,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. Cooke, in his printed Sermon, preached April 19, 1777.</NOTE>—who have gone before me in this lecture.</P>
<P>NOTHING <HI>new</HI> therefore, can be suggested by me on this occasion.—I have only to stir up your pure minds, by way of remembrance, of the transactions of that awful day; to excite your devotion, and to recommend a religious improvement of GOD'S right∣eous dispensations then, and through three revolving years now compleated.</P>
<P>IN pursuance of their oppressive measures (if not intentionally to begin the barbarous and bloody scene) the enemy came upon us like a flood, stealing a march from <HI>Boston,</HI> through by-ways, under the darkness and silence of the night; and like <HI>cowards</HI> and <HI>rob∣bers,</HI> attacked us altogether defenceless; and cruelly murdered the <HI>innocent,</HI> the aged and helpless. Ac∣cordingly they are described by the prophet as per∣sons whose <HI>hands are defiled with blood;</HI>—adding, "their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, wasting and de∣struction are in their paths."</P>
<P>WITH astonishment and gratitude we recollect the kindness of our almighthy Preserver, that no more were slain by the hand of violence; and that the
<PB N="22" REF="015776_0019_0F9A296C6A045130"/>
people willingly offered themselves to <HI>the help of the Lord against the mighty,</HI> who manfully opposed the efforts of British pride, power and barbarity.—The hand of GOD was visible in these things; and the power and goodness of GOD manifested in our de∣liverance, from the enraged, disappointed enemy, is to be devoutly retained in memory, and thankful∣ly acknowledged. When we consider, how weak and unprepared we were at that time, for such a sudden assault, (though the behaviour of the <HI>British troops</HI> might have led us to expect hostile measures would ensue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Witness their numerous insults to the inhabitants of town and country:—And their warlike preparations, and formidable fortifications on Boston-Neck, and at the entrance of the town, erected <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>)</NOTE> we may, not unfitly, adopt the words of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> concerning the church of old; in <HI>Ps.</HI> 124, whererein she blesseth GOD for a miraculous deliverance from a formidable enemy; I say we may apply the words in the beginning of the <HI>Psalm,</HI> to ourselves and circumstances, with a little variation; "If it had not been the Lord, who was on our side, now may <HI>New-England</HI> say: If it had not been the Lord, who was on our side, when men rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us," and be∣gan to break out in fierceness:—In their furious rage they would have suddenly devoured us, and laid waste the country.</P>
<P>BUT blessed be GOD, to whose infinite mercy we ascribe our deliverance, who was then a present help. These barbarous savage enemies were put into fear; they were made to flee before us, and hastily to re∣treat (as wild beasts to their dens) before a few scat∣tered
<PB N="23" REF="015776_0020_0F9A296D27FE6358"/>
undisciplined <HI>Freemen:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the best accounts it appeared, that not more than 300 of <HI>these,</HI> were, at any time properly engaged with the two British brigades, (in their flight from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Charlestown.</HI>) near 2000 strong.</NOTE> Not to our courage or conduct, but to GOD's name be all the praise and glory.</P>
<P>A close attention to the occurrences in this unna∣tural war, from its rise to the present time, affords us great occasion to sing of GOD's mercy, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> re∣joice with his people;—and likewise to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and tremble before the Lord, that his anger is not yet turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</P>
<P>IF this war be just and necessary on our part, as past all doubt it is, then we are engaged in the work of the Lord, which obliges us (under GOD mighty in battle) to use our "swords as instruments of righ∣teousness, and calls us to the shocking, but necessa∣ry, important duty of shedding human blood; not only in defence of our property, life and religion, but in obedience to him who hath said, "Cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood."</P>
<P>HERE I shall take occasion, to address the com∣panies of militia in this town;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Under the command of Capt. <HI>John</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <HI>our Brethren,</HI> now under arms. <HI>My Friends,</HI> Having early distin∣guished yourselves in a readiness to promote the common good, and safety of your country; by op∣posing, with others, its invaders, and the murderers of your brethren in this <HI>town</HI> and <HI>neighbourhood,</HI> on
<PB N="24" REF="015776_0021_0F9A296DE81F87B8"/>
that day we are now commemorating:—You escap∣ed the arrows of death, when perhaps equally expos∣ed, as those that were cut off by the hand of violence: To the GOD of your life, and who was then, in a peculiar sense, your preserver, defence and shield, you owe everlasting love and obedience.</P>
<P>YOU were spared, it may be, further to signalize yourselves, and to do yet greater service for GOD and your bleeding country, which calls aloud to you, and all its hearty friends, to rouse and exert them∣selves, for the destruction of the common enemy and oppressor; and to wipe away the blood where∣with this land has been stained. <HI>To arms!</HI> To ac∣tion, and the battle of the warrior! is the language of divine providence; and you have every motive imaginable to awaken, and excite you to be up and doing the work of the Lord faithfully.—The ho∣nor and glory of GOD, and the salvation of your country under GOD, call aloud upon all.—Duty, in∣terest, liberty, religion and life, every thing worth enjoyment, demand speedy and the utmost exer∣tions.</P>
<P>CULTIVATE, my friends, a martial spirit, strive to excel in the art of war, that you may be qualified to act the part of soldiers well; and, under provi∣dence, be helpful in vanquishing and subduing the enemies of GOD and this people; and be numbered among those who shall be worthy to wear the laurels of victory and triumph.</P>
<P>ABOVE all, let me recommend and urge it upon you to strive for a more honorable and shining cha∣racter; I mean, that of <HI>true christians,</HI> good soldiers of JESUS CHRIST; and to fight manfully under his
<PB N="25" REF="015776_0022_0F9A296EA8059EE8"/>
banner, as the high priest of your profession, and great captain of your salvation. Then whatever service he shall call you to, or sufferings allot you;—wherever he shall lead, you will chearfully fol∣low,—be ready to face the enemy and every danger, and meet death with calmness and intrepidity, wher∣ever arrested, and be conquerors through Him.</P>
<P>WE wish you, and all our friends and brethren, called to bear arms, and jeopard their lives in defence of their country, and support of the common rights of mankind, the presence of GOD, and a blessing this day, from the house of the Lord, all grace and good in time, and glory everlasting.</P>
<P>FINALLY, Let us all devoutly worship and honor, fear and serve the Lord of hosts, and GOD of ar∣mies; hearken to his word, and seriously attend to every providence.—Let us continue our fervent cries to GOD, and offer up importunate, unceasing sup∣plications to the <HI>most High,</HI> to "avenge the blood of his servants,"—and be "merciful to" this "his land, and to his people." We are encouraged to this from the providence and promises of a powerful and faithful GOD.—The repeated successes during this calamitous war, from its beginning to the pre∣sent day, have been great and wonderful; and give us confidence in GOD, and hope of a happy conclu∣sion, if we amend our ways and doings. Our ene∣mies, indeed, have been permitted to make great de∣struction in divers parts of our land (in their rage and cruelty unequall'd) who have attempted, with <HI>fire and sword,</HI> to spread desolation far and wide.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among many instances, may be mentioned the burning of <HI>Charlestown, Falmouth, Norfolk, Kingston:</HI>—The rapine and devastation in <HI>New York</HI> and the <HI>Jersies;</HI> and their unparallel∣ed treatment of the inhabitants there, both for inhumanity and debauchery.—To which may be added, their murdering our friends, whom the fortune of war put into their hands; I mean their starving them to death; <HI>inhumanity more than savage!</HI> And to compleat their accursed plan, they have hired and let loose upon us the <HI>Indians,</HI> to scalp and butcher of every age and sex, to plunder and lay waste wherever they came: All this has been acted by <HI>Britons,</HI> who glory in their <HI>valor and humanity.</HI></NOTE>—
<PB N="26" REF="015776_0023_0F9A296F68E19B50"/>
For as they began the war with a mean, dastardly spirit, so they have prosecuted it, in all their mea∣sures, with a rigour and barbarity, exceeding the sa∣vages of the wilderness; yet, through the interposi∣tion of heaven, they have been frustrated in their grand design, defeated and disgraced.</P>
<P>IN various instances, particularly in the last <HI>cam∣paign,</HI> a merciful GOD hath crowned <HI>our arms,</HI> with singular success and victory;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our army in the <HI>Northern Department,</HI> was remarkably successful in divers actions; particulary on the 7th October, in which they attacked the lines of the enemy, and drove them from their works, killing and captivating several of their prin∣cipal officers, and many privates; gaining great advantages. On the 17th October, 1777, Lieut. Gen. <HI>Burgoyne</HI> surrender∣ed himself, and his whole army into the hands of the brave Major-General <HI>Gates,</HI> at the head of well-disciplined continen¦tal troops, and intrepid <HI>militia</HI> of <HI>New England.</HI></NOTE> enabling us to de∣stroy and break up a whole army, under one of the greatest <HI>Generals,</HI> parhaps, that <HI>Britain</HI> can boast of. This is the Lord's doing, and 'tis marvelous in in our eyes.</P>
<P>THE Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save. We may then confidently put our trust in the living GOD, and refer our cause to him that judgeth righteously, the cause of our oppressed and bleeding country—insasmuch as "he will be merciful to
<PB N="27" REF="015776_0024_0F9A297027E057F0"/>
his land." We are assured, "The Lord loveth the gates of <HI>Sion:</HI>" That he "will bless his own in∣heritance;" And that when "the Lord shall build up <HI>Zion,</HI> he shall appear in his glory. He will re∣gard the prayer of the destitute—the children of his servants shall continue, and their seed shall be esta∣blished before" him; and enjoy the tokens of the divine presence among them.</P>
<P>THESE assurances of our covenant-GOD and Fa∣ther, may well animate our spirits, invigorate our faith, confirm our hope, and establish our confidence in him, under the severest trials and miseries that befall us, in this day of calamity and war.</P>
<P>WHETHER the prophecy and promise in our <HI>text,</HI> shall be accomplished, while we of the present generation, are upon the stage of action; I known only to him, who is the Lord of life and death. However, we may piously and chearfully leave the event to GOD. Whose righteoussness remain∣eth, and his faithfulness to all generations.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude, without just hinting, that though we must necessarily concern ourselves, in some degree, with the things of this present evil world, so long as GOD shall protract our lives; yet our highest interest lies in another re∣gion, far beyond this state of noise and war, danger and misery. And whoever faithfully serves GOD and their generation here, in a wise im∣provement of their talents, shall in the end, re¦ceive a crown of life, unfading and eternal.</P>
<P>HERE is nothing, <HI>my hearers,</HI> nothing worthy
<PB N="28" REF="015776_0025_0F9A29710EC08CE0"/>
your highest affection, and unceasing pursuit.—"All that cometh is vanity."—All things are lia∣ble to change, and in perpetual uncertainty. Eve∣ry thing tends to dissolution, and GOD alone is <HI>in∣variable.</HI></P>
<P>We are all children of mortality and must die out of this world.—Blessed be GOD, ho∣nor and immortality beyond the grave is as∣certained by divine revelation. Being called to glory by virtue, let us diligently and conscienti∣ously perform all the duties of our holy religion; labor to secure our peace with GOD, through <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our only Savior—that we may be perfect and compleat in him, as our head.</P>
<P>THAT so, when contending powers and jarr∣ing nations on earth shall be removed—all king∣doms and states dissolved—and all empire and dominion blotted out, excepting <HI>His</HI> who is the first cause, and last end of all things:—We may have a place in the highest heavens;—be admitted to dwell in GOD's immediate pre∣sence—and join the heavenly host in the warm∣est ascriptions of blessing, and honor, and praise and glory to GOD and the lamb, for ever and ever.</P>
