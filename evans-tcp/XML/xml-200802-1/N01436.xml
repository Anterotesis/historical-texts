<P><HI>THE Difficulties, which the Trade of this Pro∣vince labours under, by reason of the Scarcity of Money, having rendred it necessary that some Ex∣pedient be found out to supply that Deficiency: A Scheme of a Bank of Credit founded upon a Land Security, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been accordingly Projected; and will be humbly offered to the Consideration of the General Assembly, at their next Session.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now, in as much as things of this Nature (tho' recommended in</HI> Europe, <HI>by long Experience of their general Usefulness and Benefit, to the Places where they are Established) yet may be here in hazard of not meeting with that Regard and Encouragement they deserve, for want of a due Information con∣cerning them: And there having been many Years since Printed in</HI> London, <HI>a Projection of much the same Nature with that prepared here; (tho' not so Beneficial to the Publick, or on so Solid a Foundation,) yet setting forth in a Plain and Familiar way, not only the Nature, but the Feazibleness and Utility of such a Fund of Credit; it was judg'd Convenient to Re-print the same here, that so all Persons might have an Opportunity of gaining an Insight into it: It being rationally Concluded, That such a Bank being made to appear to be of Necessity to us in our present Circumstances, and of great and general Benefit; there is no Publick-spirited Person but will set to his helping Hand, to Promote the Establishment of the same.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the First, viz. Some things premised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Introduction, touching Banks in general.</HEAD>
<P>MOney, whether Gold or Silver, is but a measure of the value of other things; yet hath, for a long Succession of Ages (especially in the Civilized and Trading part of
<PB N="2" REF="001703_0004_0FB62967A366F148"/>
the World) obtained to be the usual, and best known means of Interchange.</P>
<P>This measure and way of Interchange, was ori∣ginally occasioned by the experimented inconve∣niences of common Barter; in which way, unless both the Parties dealing, have like occasion, re∣ciprocally, of each others Commodities, the less necessitous Over-reaches the greater, by imposing the price of both, to his own advantage, and the others detriment, which is not equal; nor can there be Equality where there is no common Standard between them.</P>
<P>But, whether the Mines fail, or Men have not been so fore-seeing and industrious to bring in, to most Countreys, a sufficiency of Money or Bul∣lion, wherewith to manage their increasing Trades, or, that Traders, for want of other Returns, have been necessitated, for Balance of the Sur∣charge of Goods imported, to remit the Coyns of some Countreys into others: Or, for other Causes (not necessary on this occasion to be fur∣ther inquired into) tis now so hard to come by, in some places, for carrying on of Trade, to an∣swer the vastness of Mens attempts, and aims of increase in Merchandize, as that its found, in many Countreys, insufficient in this Age of the World: And that hath put divers Persons and Countreys, upon contrivances how to supply that Deficiency, by other Mediums; some of which have happily pitch'd upon that of Banks, Lum∣bards, and Exchange of Moneys by Bills, which have thriven with them.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001703_0005_0FB6296B776E9CE0"/>
The two former of these, <HI>viz.</HI> Banks and Lum∣bards, have been set on foot in divers Trading Countreys, by their respective Publick Underta∣kings, and have succeeded to their abundant In∣riching. Perhaps others have thought, that would have occasion'd the overflowing of Moneys amongst them: Especially if they raised the Va∣lues of Gold &amp; Silver above the common Standard; but as they have been mistaken, or their Surfeit of Trade hath obscured the visibility of it; and protracted more rational Considerations of Re∣dressing, till it hath proved almost Fatal, to the impoverishing of their Countreys: So the other have really experimented, that their Banks have been, as well with other Countries, as amongst themselves, of greater Value than the Species of Gold and Silver: And yet, such Places drain away the said Species from the other, who under those mistaken apprehensions have Courted it, as the only real good thing for a Countrey.</P>
<P>The Third, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Exchange of Moneys, hath been for the most part managed by the re∣spective Merchants of all places; who in their par∣ticular Dealings and Correspondences (fore-lay∣ing Advantages to themselves thereby) have un∣accountably controll'd it, and vary it often, in each Annual Revolution.</P>
<P>'Tis not to be doubted, but that all Three of these may be accommodated &amp; improved, to the Publick Advantage of any Countrey: Especially, if managed in Partnership by Private Hands, be∣ing persons of known Integrity, Prudence and
<PB N="4" REF="001703_0006_0FB6297FA8FBAB30"/>
Estates: subjecting the annual Profits accruing thereby to the answering the Injury, damage, or loss, by their undertaking.</P>
<P>The best Foundation for such an Attempt, is, that of Real and Personal Estates, instead of the <HI>Species</HI> of Gold and Silver. For, as a Bank of Moneys is liable to many casualties and hazards; so, the hoarding up of Moneys in Banks, necessi∣tates the taking out the more Bills; which is one Malady this Proposed Bank will cure.</P>
<P>We shall therefore, at present, begin with, and principally discourse of the two first of these: <HI>viz.</HI> The Bank of Credit, as it may be rendred susceptible of the Second, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lumbard, con∣junct: accounting both the one and the other to be founded as aforesaid, <HI>viz.</HI> On Lands or Real Estates mortgaged, and staple durable Goods, and Merchandises deposited: such as any Countreys Products and Manufactures will by Art and In∣dustry produce and furnish.</P>
<P>Here might be also discours'd, A Lumbard for the Poor, by some called, <HI>Mons Pietatis:</HI> But that's fitter to be the Handmaid of the other; for, 'twill be too poor to encourage an under∣taking by it self, or for a beginning: Neither will there be any such necessity thereof, when this Bank is settled; forasmuch as this will im∣ploy most of those, who are usually maintained in Idleness, if they will betake themselves to In∣dustry, at such moderate wages as would en∣able them to live comfortably, without exposing their Imployers to like Poverty with themselves.
<PB N="5" REF="001703_0007_0FB6298120683038"/>
And besides, this Bank of Credit and Lumbard, when understood, and received in any Countrey with general Approbation, will in due time ren∣der that, as also the Third, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Ex∣change of Moneys by Bills, the more intelligible, and as useful.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the second Particular, viz. The definition of such a Bank.</HEAD>
<P>A Considerable number of Persons, some of each Rank, Trade, Calling and Condition, especially in the principal Place or Places of Tra∣ding in any Countrey, Agree voluntarily to Re∣ceive as ready Moneys, of and from each other, and any Persons in their ordinary dealings, Bank-bills of Credit, Signed by several Persons of good Repute, joyned together in a Partnership, given forth on Lands of good Title mortgaged, and staple unperishing Goods and Merchandizes, de∣posited in fitting places to be appointed by the Partnership for that purpose; to the value of a∣bout one half, or two thirds of such respective Mortgages and Deposits: Which said Bills, thro' their experimented usefulness, become diffused by mutual consent; and passing from one hand to another, in a kind of Circulation, and under re∣putation of so certain a Fund, have at least equal Advantages with the Current Money or Coyn of any Countrey, attending them, to all who be∣come satisfied to deal with them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But it may be said by some, This is a
<PB N="6" REF="001703_0008_0FB62982B40955B8"/>
very brief Account, and requires further Expla∣nation. We are yet Strangers to the Nature, and requisite Constitution of a Bank of Credit, and what lies on us to do, in order to our being made partakers of any benefits or advantages thereby, to such as shall voluntarily comply therewith; nor do we see clearly our Security in so doing, nor upon what terms. Pray inform us of these things, so far as we may be safely guided into the way, and unto the end of it. Also, in case this Bank should terminate, how we shall be dealt withal, in the closing up of Accompts, so as may be with∣out damage, either to the Bank, or to our Selves. We doubt not but you have as well Considered the End as the Beginning. Tho' if it prove useful, we can see no cause why a thing of so great Advantages as are suggested, should procure any persons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll-will, or Weariness of it. And we are also satisfied, that an Affair of this nature, wherein the Persons and Estates of so many shall be involved (as it seems probable will be where it once gets footing) cannot suddenly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knock'd off, but with inconvenience.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The clearing these Doubts you'l find in the particulars following. Therefore now,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the third Particular, viz. The Constitution of this Bank.</HEAD>
<P>IT is proposed that there be One and Twenty persons (or less) in the Partnership of this Bank: whereof Seven to be called <HI>Principal Ma∣nagers;</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001703_0009_0FB62992398D69E8"/>
Who, or any Three or more of them may have the power of managing and governing the whole affair, according to the Constitution &amp; Rules thereof; and Fourteen Deputies to be im∣ployed by them as Accomptants, Surveyors, Ap∣praisers, Store-keepers, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> All of them to be per∣sons of good &amp; general Reputation, for Integrity, Prudence and Estates: But, forasmuch as, at the first entrance upon such an affair, it may not be needful to ingage so many; that any Seven of them (more or less) may be conceived sufficient to begin the same; and manage it, until, by the coming on of Business, it shall be judged necessary &amp; incouraging, to settle the Full, or some greater Number of them. These may all be ingaged by Articles of Agreement, &amp; Covenants in Partner∣ship, to attend thereon, and be responsible for their doings, according to such Constitution and Rules in that behalf.</P>
<P>These are to receive all Proposals from any persons touching their having such Credit there-out as they shall desire upon their said Estates of Lands or Goods respectively▪ and to contract &amp; agree with them therein▪ a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such Values, &amp; for such Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall judge the Security proposed of either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to draw up, and per∣fect such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mortgages, Grants &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereof as Lands or Goods respectively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> require; and perfect the Coun∣terparts thereof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Mortgagers and Depo∣sitors.</P>
<P>They are also to cause the said Mortgages &amp;
<PB N="8" REF="001703_0010_0FB629931EF3F728"/>
Deposits to be laid up and stored, respectively, in as safe and convenient Rooms, and, Ware∣houses, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as shall be without exception, to pre∣vent damage of Weather, Robbery, Fire, Water, or Vermin of any kind, whereby they may be impai∣red, or dampnified, and all this, under the trust and custody of such numbers of the said Part∣ners, as no opportunity can be taken to impair or lessen the Security, unless they should all agree therein; which cannot reasonably be imagined being such as are proposed. But, for the better Se∣curity thereof, there may be continual Watching on all such places; and it will be the Interest of all persons, any way concerned in the affairs &amp; pro∣fits of such a Bank, to be careful to prevent, and to give Advertisement of any attempt made to the impairing &amp; prejudicing thereof, for that their livelihood and dependences will much consist in their preserving it in the greatest Repute; which upon the least violation, by those who are ingaged in the management and trust thereof, will be ut∣terly lost, and the Bank fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>These Partners aforesaid, must also enter into and oblige themselves by Covenants to, and with other Persons to be called Assessors of the Bank, and Conservators of the Constitution, Rules and Instructions to be observed in the management thereof, for their diligence and faithfulness, in the Discharge and Execution of their respective trusts, according to the said Constitution: and inviolably to observe the same, and all the Rules thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001703_0011_0FB629A00A952EC8"/>
The said Assessors have also the Oversight and Controll of the whole Affair: To see the same be so managed: and to that end are daily to in∣spect the Management thereof; and that the said Rules be duly observed on both parts, <HI>viz.</HI> as well on the part of the persons dealing with them, as of the Managers themselves, in every branch of the Bank, that all be done with justice and Impartiality between them; to settle dif∣ferences, in case any happen; and in the absence of the Managers, may supply that defect, by their Personal transacting the same things, or allowing others as their Deputies. Also,</P>
<P>Each of the said Partners must deposit Moneys and other Estate in the Bank as a Stock or Fund, of their own; which be a further Security and Obligation upon them, for their upright dealings; For thereby every of themselves become Perso∣nally Interested, and concerned to be careful in every thing, that they keep the Rules; and all Persons concerned in the yearly Profits thereof are liable, according to the Constitution, to an∣swer the damages, as far as their respective shares thereof extend.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the fourth Particular, viz. The necessary Rules to be observed in this Bank.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I <HI>N primis,</HI> That the Partners in the Manage∣ment of the affairs of the said Bank do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it in some convenient Place, of the chief Trading Town of each Countrey, from day to day, and

<P N="2">2. <HI>Item,</HI> That whatsoever person shall propose to Mortgage or Deposit any staple Goods or Mer∣chandizes, Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments of a clear and good Title, to the said Partnership, may have such &amp; so many Bills delivered to him as shall amount to about the Value or Sum of one half, or two thirds of the said Estates; or more or less, according as his Occasions shall require, and the nature of the Depositors security will ad∣mit.

<P>The Husbandman, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> If a Farmer of Lands, pays his Rent, and purchases more young Cattel of his Neighbour, for Breed or Fatting. Or,</P>
<P>If an Owner of Land, and hath not sufficient Stock to improve it, he also Mortgages his Land, and has Credit to furnish himself. Or,</P>
<P>If he hath sufficient Stock, and perhaps more than his present Farm can maintain, he hath his eye upon a Neighbouring Farm, or piece of Land
<PB N="17" REF="001703_0019_0FB629CD520F0430"/>
that would be Sold; he Mortgages his own Land in the Bank, and hath Credit to buy the other.</P>
<P>If then he want Stock, he may also Mortgage the Farm or piece of Land last purchased; and have Credit to inable him fully to Improve and Stock both, Whereby he doubles his Yearly ad∣vantages, and if he can then content himself to live as frugally, &amp; be as industrious as before, he may soon compass to pay off his Debt, &amp; redeem his Land. Or, he may continue the Credit he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and take out more upon the Additional im∣provement; and thus increase his Purchases and Estates, as long as such an help is afforded.</P>

<P>The like may be done for carrying on the open∣ing &amp; working in any Mines, Minerals or Quarreys of Stone, Lead, Tin, Iron, Copper, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> thus, <HI>viz.</HI> The Mine &amp; Lands wherein the same is, may be Mortgaged as aforesaid, to supply the Owner there∣of with Bills of Credit, for paying his Workmen, in any Sum of <HI>Twenty Shillings,</HI> or above.</P>
<P>As fast as any of these Metals, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> are wrought fit for Sale, if a Chapman be wanting, the Metal may be brought into the Bank, and the Owner re∣ceive Bank-bills to the value of about two thirds thereof, as aforesaid, to enable him to proceed on his Works: And the Metal lying in Bank is there readier for a Market than elsewhere, in his own Private-house or Ware-house, at very reasonable rates for lying there, and may with allowance of the owner, be sold in his absence, by the Merchant-broker before mentioned, at such current Rates

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="instance">
<HEAD>Third Instance.</HEAD>
<P>A Weaver of Cloth, Serge, or Linen, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> is imployed in any Work-house erected, or to be e∣rected, to carry on those respective Manufactures: Also other Manufactures, and Artificers, in Rope-making, Cables, Rigging, Sails, Anchors, or any other Materials for the Fishing-trade, Merchants, or building of Ships, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>The Owner of such Work-house, or Materials respectively, consents to Mortgage the same, for One or Two <HI>Hundred Pounds,</HI> more or less, in Bank-bills, as the Work shall require, and the Value of the House or the Materials will admit.</P>
<P>With these Bills, the Work-master or Overseer, buyes Wooll, Worsted, Yarn, Hemp, Flax, Dying-stuffs, Iron, Timber, Lumber, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> of the Merchant, Ware-house-keeper, Countrey-man, or other Seller; and finishes 40, 60, or 100, pieces, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> more or less of any of the said Commodities; which when wrought up for a Market; if he want a Chapman, he brings into the Bank Ware-houses, as aforesaid; or such Yards, Docks, or other Places, as they shall appoint or agree: Takes up new Credit upon them, and leaves them there to be Sold, at his own rates, as aforesaid. Or,</P>
<P>A considerable parcel of Wooll, Cotton, Yarn, Flax, Hemp, Oyl, Dying-stuffs, or other Goods for his use, are offer'd to Sale; he may pay one third thereof by his Wrought-up-goods Unsold, and bringing these Commodities into the Bank,
<PB N="19" REF="001703_0021_0FB629CFE6758520"/>
may receive Bills of Credit for paying the other two thirds; which he may take out, in parcels, as he brings in any new wrought up Goods, or hath occasion to use them for working up more; and the Bank-ware-houses will be to him as <HI>Black-well Hall,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>London</HI> to the Clothiers, to assist his Sale of them without his trouble: For thither will all Merchants have incouragement to come, to seek supplies for Transportation, &amp; find Goods always ready. Other Instances might be multiplied, but by these it appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Manufacturer, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> loses no time in looking out a Chapman.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is always furnish'd with Credit to buy his Materials at the best hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Merchant never trusts, nor Ware-house keeper: Or, if he do, the plenty of Bills expedits his Chapmans Sale, and consequently his Pay∣ments. Whereby,</P>
<P N="4">4. He has incouragement &amp; stock presently to look out for more of the same, or other useful Merchandizes.</P>
<P N="5">5. Sends forth the said Metals, Clothes, Stuffs, Linen, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> amongst other Merchandizes of the Product of his Countrey, or Imported.</P>
<P N="6">6. Makes return of Bullion, Moneys, or other useful Goods, which are presently bought off with Bank-bills. Or,</P>
<P N="7">7. He may store them up in Bank Ware-houses, and receive present Credit, wherewith to send out again And,</P>
<P N="8">8. Thereby be inabled (at least) to double, or
<PB N="20" REF="001703_0022_0FB629D1997FA620"/>
treble his yearly dealings, and receive proporti∣onable advantages. This,</P>
<P N="1">1. Increases &amp; quickens Merchandizing &amp; Trade.</P>
<P N="2">2. Promotes Shipping &amp; Navigation. Which,</P>
<P N="3">3. Increases the Publick Duties, and conse∣quently the Revenues.</P>
<P N="4">4. Imploys the Poor in the Minings &amp; Manu∣factures forementioned.</P>
<P N="5">5. They get Moneys by these Imployments.</P>
<P N="6">6. That inables them to buy up all necessaries for Cloathing, Victuals, paying of Debts, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. This helps the Consumption of, as well their own Commodities, as other imported Goods and Merchandizes: for no Man, that hath wherewith to buy, will go naked or be hungry, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. This helps to civilize the Ruder sort of Peo∣ple; and incourages others to follow their Exam∣ple in Industry and Civility.</P>
<P N="9">9. Thus all sorts of Persons become inabled to live handsomly, &amp; out of Debt, and that prevents multiplicity of Law-suits, &amp; Troubles to the Go∣vernment: but none of these advantages may be expected, out of the small Pittance of Cash, that now is, ever was, or likely will be in any Countrey, un∣less assisted in Trade, &amp; inriched by the help this Bank proposes.

</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the sixth Particular, viz. The answering some few of the most material Pertinent Queries, and Objections touching this Bank, viz.</HEAD>
<P>Q 1. C <HI>An I have Monyes for Bank-bills, when I have occasion?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001703_0023_0FB629E11B41B110"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> 1. 'Tis not propounded to be a Bank of Moneys (which is liable to inexpressible &amp; unfore∣seen hazards) but of Credit to be given forth by Bills; not on Moneys advanced, as in other Banks; but (on Lands or Goods, as aforesaid,) to supply such as cannot get Moneys (by reason of its scarcity) with whatsoever may be had for Moneys. Yet,</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2. As oft as any persons Redeem their Lands, or Goods, they must do it in Bank-bills, or with Moneys. If in ready Moneys, the Partner∣ship may exchange Bills therewith, to such as de∣sire it; as is afore provided by the Rules.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 3. However, this Bank is no occasion of streightning men that would have Moneys; but leaves them free; and in this case, the Merchant-brokers of the Bank will be helpful, between those who have and who want Moneys, and Bills re∣spectively; as is likewise aforementioned in the said Rules. But,</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 4. If it be made to appear to you, that o∣thers who have Moneys, will be willing to change your Bank-bills into those Species of Gold &amp; Sil∣ver, &amp; thank you for offering them the occasion (tho' the Bank Partnership do it not) you'l have no cause to decline the other advantages propo∣sed: Especially if you may both be gainers by the Exchange. Now, if I ow'd you 500 <HI>l.</HI> to be paid in Silver, which I could not do, but should propose to pay you in Gold, at the intrinsique Coyn'd Value, which if you part with again will yield you <HI>Five Pound</HI> profit, or more: Would you then refuse Gold?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="001703_0024_0FB629E20982EFC0"/>
Obj. <HI>But how will you apply this, to make it Credible? Sol.</HI> Thus, Whoever hath any Payment to make in Bank, which (in probability if such Bank take effect in any Countrey) will be every Man that deals in above <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> at a time) will find, that we must pay <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> more, in every <HI>Hundred Pounds</HI> of ready Money, than in Bank-bills of Credit; as <HI>per</HI> the forementioned Rules of the Bank) which is about <HI>Five-pence</HI> benefit to the Exchanger, in every 20. <HI>s.</HI> No doubt then of having Moneys (by a little inquiry of the Mer∣chant-broker) at the Value contained in the Bills, of all such as must redeem their Mortgages, and Deposits. But,</P>
<P>Bills, wherever Banks have been erected (tho' Money Banks) have always been of better Value than Moneys in Specie. Whereof three Reasons may be given.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) For the ease of Compting and Carriage; and preventing damage to the Receiver, by Coun∣terfeit, Clip'd, Light or Base Coyn: (Which is obvious to all.)</P>
<P N="2">(2) For safety in Travelling, Laying up, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> As visible as the other.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) For the advantage that is to be made by the Exchange, on the account of such Conveni∣ences. Whereof take two Examples, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Bank-bills of <HI>Holland</HI> are ordinarily better than Moneys, by at least <HI>Three Pounds per Cent.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Those in <HI>Venice,</HI> by <HI>Twenty Pounds per Cent.</HI> and Laws made there to keep them from rising
<PB N="23" REF="001703_0025_0FB629F341C5F6D8"/>
higher; for they were once at 28. <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and not without some difficulty Reduced to <HI>Twenty;</HI> so that each Bill of 100 <HI>l.</HI> is now Current at 120. <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. <HI>But how is that Possible or Credible?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sol.</HI> There is this account rendred of it (which has confirmation by many other Instances that might be given, concerning the current Prices of many Commodities, which have not so much of intrinsique value in them,) <HI>viz.</HI> The State of <HI>Venice</HI> propounded the Erecting a Bank to consist of <HI>Two Millions of Duckets:</HI> Accordingly Moneys were brought in, Bills given out for the same Value; and a stop put to the receiving, or giving out any more of either.</P>
<P>The Usefulness of these Bills was suddenly found to be such in the practice and imployment of them, upon the three forementioned Accounts, that every Man, at one time or other, found his Affairs required them: So, that at first, such Bills would not be parted with for Money, under <HI>Ten Shillings per Hundred Pounds;</HI> And no sooner was that become the Current Rate, but they were suc∣cessively raised, by <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> at a time, till they came to be in every ones Estimation, 28. <HI>l per Cent.</HI> better than Moneys in Specie; and so pass'd accordingly. Whereupon,</P>
<P>The State of <HI>Venice</HI> enacted several Laws against their passing so high: which failing to accomplish what was required, at length they conceived it necessary, in order to the bringing down the Price, to propose the giving forth Bills for <HI>Three Hundred Thousand Duckets</HI> more: By which means they
<PB N="24" REF="001703_0026_0FB629F6A03A6D60"/>
brought it back to <HI>Twenty Pounds per Cent.</HI> (which pleased the People) and there fixt it, as to its rising higher afterwards, by a severe Law; since when, it stands so to this Day: And this is no more than what is familiar in the Price of other things, <HI>viz.</HI> Diamonds, Rubies, Pearls, Horses, Pictures, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> which have their Estimation from the various Pleasures and Fancies of Men, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>And, if it be demanded, what induced that State to allow it so high?</P>
<P>The Answer is easie, <HI>viz.</HI> The State of <HI>Venice</HI> had made use of the Moneys deposited, in their Publick Occasions (where observe the hazard of a Money Bank) and, having promised for Satis∣faction of Creditors, to raise the like Sum, if they should have occasion for it, reap this advantage, of their Peoples high Opinion of Bills, that, they are thereby assured, that never, will any Credi∣tor come to ask them 100 <HI>l.</HI> for a Bill of 100 <HI>l.</HI> when he may have 120 <HI>l.</HI> from any other hand. A notable way to pay a vast Debt. But, by means hereof, the Creditor has no other Fund or Secu∣rity but the States Word: For, there is not one Ducket for them in Bank.</P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>My Lands or Goods are already Mortgaged for Moneys, at a higher Rate of Interest; and the Mort∣gage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will not take Bills. Can such a Bank help me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> There may be Persons, of whom you may be informed at the Bank, who will advise &amp; assist you therein: If there be Moneys in the Countrey to be had.</P>
<P>Q. 3. <HI>I have neither Lands nor Goods, but a Trade, by
<PB N="25" REF="001703_0027_0FB629F7A4FFE4B0"/>
which I could live comfortably if I had a small Stock; and I could afford to give a greater Interest, and have Friends that would help me too, upon my own Bond: But they have not Moneys. Which way shall I be help'd?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> If your Friends have Lands or Goods, they may have these Bank-bills of Credit, at <HI>Four Pounds per Cent. per Annum,</HI> to Lend you at such Rates as you can agree: Whereby they also may be gain∣ers, and have incouragement to help you.</P>
<P>Much more might be said upon this Subject, but these seem to be sufficient, for incouraging an at∣tempt: And, the experiments of the things sug∣gested will give such clear Demonstrations of the Usefulness, Advantage, Necessity &amp; Security of such Banks, in most places, beyond all others that have been hitherto put in practice, as those who are not so prompt to receive things into their un∣derstandings by the Notions of them, or are pre∣judiced by mistaken apprehensions about them, &amp; thence raise many impertinent Objections (not worth scribling) may be presumed will follow o∣thers Examples, in well-doing, when those are observed to thrive who go before therein.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>We shall therefore, for the Conclusion, which is the last Particular mentioned, to be Discoursed, Sum up all, in this general Assertion, viz.</HEAD>
<P>THat there will arise many more Convenien∣ces &amp; Advantages, by this Bank, to such Coun∣treys where they shall be erected, than have been enumerated, in the several foregoing instances; or, well, can be.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="26" REF="001703_0028_0FB629F923BF9898"/>
1. By this, the Trade &amp; Wealth of any Country is establish'd upon its own Foundation: and upon a <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Balance</HI> arising within it self, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lands &amp; Products of such Countrey, &amp; not upon the Importation of Gold or Silver; or the Scarcity or Plenty of them, or, of any thing else Imported from Foreign Nations, which may be with-held, prohibited, or enhansed, at the Pleasure of others.</P>
<P N="2"> 2. The Native Commodities of such Countrys will thus become improved to a sufficiency <HI>(at least)</HI> for their own Use; and thereby afford a comfor∣table Subsistence to many ingenuous &amp; industrious Persons, in such Countrys, who know not how to Subsist: Especially such as are Banish'd, or inforced to forsake their Native Countrys, by reason of the heat of Persecution, upon the account of Religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will not be in the Power of any, by Extor∣tion &amp; Oppression, to make a Prey of the Necessitous.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Fishery of such Countrys, as lye conve∣nient for it, may be improved: and the Naviga∣tion &amp; Shipping increased, for Use or Sale.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Publick Revenues thereof, in conse∣quence of these, will be augmented.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Rents of Lands, yea, the Purchase value thereof, will rise: For, the Plenty of Money, or a valuable Credit equivalent thereunto, &amp; the Low∣ering of Interest, must necessarily have that effect.</P>
<P N="7">7. It will supply the defect or scarcity of Mo∣neys in Specie, until by the setling of <HI>Manufactures,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> (which this Bank proposes) the Products of such Countrey for Exportation shall come to Ba∣lance or Exceed the value of it's Importations▪
<PB N="27" REF="001703_0029_0FB62A09A71084D0"/>
which afterwards will necessitate the bringing in of Moneys, as fast as the want thereof hath carried it away. For, the true ground of the Plenty or Scarcity of Moneys in any Countrey, is not the high or low Value of the Money (as some errone∣ously conceive) but, that the Value of Goods Im∣ported from other parts hath been greater than that of the Export. The Balance whereof must necessarily be answer'd with Moneys, &amp; for the same Reason, Revers'd, the Export of Goods when bro't to exceed the value of the Import, must, as necessarily bring it back again to such proportion as the Export can be raised. And whatsoever o∣ther means may be suggested for furnishing of Moneys, must be fruitless, for, there will abide no more than such proportion; let what Value will be put on Moneys above the Currant Price there∣of in other Countrys with whom they shall Trade; which may be further Evidenced, if this hint thereof be not sufficiently intelligible. To which may be added, That the less need there is of Mo∣neys in Specie, by reason of such Currant Credit, the more will be the increase of Money it self; as is manifest in <HI>Holland, Venice,</HI> &amp; all Places where Bank-credit supplies the defect of those Species; least, the Money that remains in such Countreys, will be at greater liberty for such petty occasions as cannot be so well accommodated by Bills.</P>
<P>In Order therefore, &amp; as Praevious to the En∣tring upon such an Affair, tis requisite that other Queries be Propounded and Resolved, viz.</P>
<P>Q. 4. <HI>How shall it come to be known whether a sufficient number of Persons, of all Ranks, Trades
<PB N="28" REF="001703_0030_0FB62A0B91EA78B8"/>
and Callings, will deal with this Bank?</HI> The Rea∣sons of which Inquiry are these, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) It will be of use to the undertakers of such Bank to know it, for their incouragement in their entrance upon this affair. And,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) To such others as would take the Bills, if they were satisfied they could buy such Goods, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as they want, with Bills, at as easie rates, as if they had ready Moneys to give.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. It will be requisite, that a short De∣claration be tendred to be Subscribed by some Per∣sons of all Ranks, Trades &amp; Callings; signifying that they will accept the said Bank-bills of Credit, in their ordinary future dealings of Buying &amp; Sel∣ling, or other Traffiquing affairs, whereupon they are to receive Moneys, for so much ready Moneys as shall be in such Bills mentioned, upon the Terms &amp; according to the Rules of the Bank: Saving to every man his Specialties, &amp; particular Contracts.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 2. That such as shall so declare themselves, by Subscription (or otherwise) may be put into Alphabetical Lists, and, such as take forth Bills may be informed of the Names of the said re∣spective Persons, their Trades or Callings, and Places of Habitation. But,</P>
<P>Q. 5. It may be further inquired, viz. <HI>What if some sorts of Persons requisite for a universal Circula∣tion of Bills, will not, in all cases, ingage to accept Bank-bills: but some will wholly Refuse them, &amp; Cry up Mo∣neys, inhans'd to a higher Rate than they pass at in o∣ther Countreys,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Others will be for either, or both, as they find it for their Advantage,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="001703_0031_0FB62A0FEEE1C908"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> Its not necessary that all should, in all cases, oblige themselves to Bills, as long as there is Moneys to be had: But if there be not a sufficien∣cy of that for carrying on of Trade, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as, this Bank hinders not the Currency of Moneys, but that may be imployed as far as it will go, (which, for the most part, during the Scarcity of it, will be in small dealings,) so, the Bills will be found useful to supply the defect. The needful pro∣portion whereof will soon be understood; and each Person will cast his Business, and make his Contracts accordingly: And consequently, this need not hinder, or discourage the attempt; if there be a competent number of each, or most sorts, that cannot, otherwise, deal as they would.</P>
<P>Q. 6. And, if any shall inquire, <HI>What Number of Merchants and other Tradesmen may be sufficient (at first erecting such a Bank) to assist a Circulation of Bills in Trade, in case some should, not only withdraw from, but, obstruct, &amp; misrepresent the Affair, or Persons managing it, as not having the Publick Approbation, or Sanction of the Authority of a Countrey, which they may suggest to be necessary?</HI> It's Answered,</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. A few Merchants in any Countrey who are general Traders (by the help this Bank proposes, in the foregoing Instances,) may be suf∣ficient to give encouragement for the Entrance upon this Affair; and so many Shop-keepers, Ar∣tificers, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as must and will deal with them.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 2. It may reasonably be presumed, that, many, in the practice of the thing, will appre∣hend
<PB N="30" REF="001703_0032_0FB62A12801053B0"/>
the necessity, usefulness, and security there∣of, who cannot easily take it up in the Notion, or by Discourse▪ and that such will come in by Degrees: for, if, (being Merchants) they stand out, such of their Chap-men as shall find it their interest to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell for Bills, must buy again of others who will take them in payment; and finding them∣selves well used by such, will hardly return where they have been refused: and, if of other Professi∣ons they must either Sell little, or do it on Trust, or wait for payment till moneys grow more plen∣tiful; whilest others carry away the whole Tra∣ding among them.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 3. This part of the Merchants Calling, is, in every respect as Free and Lawfull for any to undertake, and needs no more of Publick Encou∣ragement or Countenance, than that part of buy∣ing and selling (at home or abroad) with or for ready Money, Time, or Barter, which they better understand &amp; practise. And the managers hereof may as well expect a Benefit by it as the others: Forasmuch as it will no less take up their time to attend; and will be an improving the Trade of any Countrey, no less than the other: And lastly, has its Hazards attending it; for the Profits accruing thereby, are, in the first place assigned, by the Con∣stitution and Rules thereof, for making good all Losses &amp; Damages that may happen, in the Ma∣nagement of this Affair.</P>
