<P>THIS history, taking in such a variety of facts and opinions, has grown under my hand; especially as in writing I cannot avoid entering into some desultory disquisitions, and descriptions of manners and things which, though not strictly necessary to elucidate the events, are intimately connected with the main object; I have also been led into several theoretical investigations, whilst marking the political effects that naturally flow from the progress of knowledge. It is probable, there∣fore, that this work will be extended to two or three more volumes, a considerable part of which is already written.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE revolution in France exhibits a scene, in the political world, not less novel and interest∣ing than the contrast is striking between the narrow opinions of superstition, and the enlight∣ened sentiments of masculine and improved phi∣losophy.</P>
<P>To mark the prominent features of this revo∣lution, requires a mind, not only unsophisticated by old prejudices, and the inveterate habits of degeneracy; but an amelioration of temper, pro∣duced by the exercise of the most enlarged prin∣ciples of humanity.</P>
<P>The rapid changes, the violent, the base, and nefarious assassinations, which have clouded the vivid prospect that began to spread a ray of joy and gladness over the gloomy horizon of oppres∣sion, cannot fail to chill the sympathizing bosom, and palsy intellectual vigour. To sketch these vicissitudes is a task so arduous and melancholy,
<PB REF="029916_0004_0FE3092B6842B788"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat, with a heart trembling at the touches of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ature, it becomes necessary to guard against the erroneous inferences of sensibility; and reason beaming on the grand theatre of political changes can prove the only sure guide to direct us to a favourable or just conclusion.</P>
<P>This important conclusion, involving the hap∣piness and exaltation of the human character, de∣mands serious and mature consideration; as it must ultimately sink the dignity of society into contempt, and its members into greater wretched∣ness; or elevate it to a degree of grandeur not hitherto anticipated, but by the most enlighten∣ed statesmen and philosophers.</P>
<P>Contemplating then these stupendous events with the cool eye of observation, the judgment difficult to be preserved unwarped under the pressure of the calamitous horrors produced by desperate and enraged factions, will continually perceive that it is the uncontaminated mass of the French nation, whose minds begin to grasp the sentiments of freedom, that has secured the equi∣librium of the state; often tottering on the brink of annihilation; in spite of the folly, selfishness, madness, treachery, and more fatal mock patriot∣ism, the common result of depraved manners,
<PB N="v" REF="029916_0005_0FE308EB8E58C290"/>
the concomitant of that servility and volup tuousness which for so long a space of time has embruted the higher orders of this celebrated nation.</P>
<P>By thus attending to circumstances, we shall be able to discern clearly that the revolution was neither produced by the abilities or intrigues of a few individuals; nor was the effect of sudden and short-lived enthusiasm; but the natural con∣sequence of intellectual improvement, gradually proceeding to perfection in the advancement of communities, from a state of barbarism to that of polished society, till now arrived at the point when sincerity of principles seem to be hastening the overthrow of the tremendous empire of su∣perstition and hypocrisy, erected upon the ruins of gothic brutality and ignorance.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we contemplate the infancy of man, his gradual advance towards maturity, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miserable weakness as a solitary being, and the crudeness of his first notions respecting the na∣ture of civil society, it will not appear extraordi∣nary, that the acquirement of political knowledge has been so extremely slow; or, that public hap∣piness has not been more rapidly and generally diffused.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="029916_0014_0FE3093B5FE4C3B0"/>The perfection attained by the ancients, it is true, has ever afforded the imagination of the poetical historian a theme to deck with the choicest flowers of rhetoric; though the cool investi∣gation of facts seems clearly to prove, that the civilization of the world, hitherto, has consisted rather in cultivating the taste, than in exercising the understanding. And were not these vaunted improvements also confined to a small corner of the globe, whilst, the political view of the wisest legislators seldom extending beyond the splen∣dor and aggrandizement of their individual na∣tion, they trampled with a ferocious affectation of patriotism on the most sacred rights of humanity? When the arts flourished in Greece, and litera∣ture began to shed it's blandishments on society, the world was mostly inhabited by barbarians, who waged eternal war with their more polished neighbours, the imperfection of whose govern∣ment sapping it's foundation, the science of poli∣tics necessarily received a check in the bud—and when we find, likewise, the roman empire crum∣bling into atoms, from the germ of a deadly ma∣lady implanted in it's vitals; whilst voluptuous∣ness stopped the progress of civilization, which makes the perfection of the arts the dawn of sci∣ence; we shall be convinced, that it demanded ages of improving reason and experience in moral philosophy, to clear away the rubbish, and ex∣hibit the first principles of social order.</P>
<P>We have probably derived our great superi∣ority over those nations from the discovery of the polar attraction of the needle, the perfection which astronomy and mathematics have attained, and the fortunate invention of printing. For,
<PB N="3" REF="029916_0015_0FE308F572AF2C88"/>
whilst the revival of letters has added the col∣lected wisdom of antiquity to the improvements of modern research, the latter most useful art has rapidly multiplied copies of the productions of genius and compilations of learning, bringing them within the reach of all ranks of men: the scientific discoveries also have not only led us to new worlds; but, facilitating the communica∣tion between different nations, the friction of arts and commerce have given to society the trans∣cendently pleasing polish of urbanity; and thus, by a gradual softening of manners, the com∣plexion of social life has been completely changed. But the remains of superstition, and the unna∣tural distinction of privileged cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses, which had their origin in barbarous folly, still fettered the opinions of man, and sullied his native dignity; till several distinguished English writers discussed political subjects with the energy of men, who began to feel their strength; and, whilst only a rumour of these sentiments roused the attention and exercised the minds of some men of letters in France, a number of staunch disputants, who had more thoroughly digested them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led from oppression, to put them to the test of experience in America.</P>
<P>Locke, following the track of these bold think∣ers, recommended in a more methodical manner religious toleration, and analyzed the principles of civil liberty: for in his definition of liberty we find the elements of <HI>The Declaration of the Rights of Man,</HI> which, in spite of the fatal errors of ignorance, and the perverse obstinacy of selfish∣ness, is now converting sublime theories into practical truths.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="029916_0016_0FE3093CE3922BB0"/>The revolution, it is true, soon introduced the corruption, that has ever since been corroding British freedom.—Still, when the rest of Europe groaned under the weight of the most unjust and cruel law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the life and property of Englishmen were comparatively safe; and if an impress-war∣rant respected the distinction of ranks, when the glory of England was at stake, splendid victories hid this flaw on the best existing constitution; and all exultingly recollected, that the life or li∣berty of a man never depended on the will of an individual.</P>
<P>Englishmen were then, with reason, proud of their constitution; and, if this noble pride hath degenerated into arrogance, when the cause be∣came less conspicuous, it is only a venial lapse of human nature; to be lamented merely as it stops the progress of civilization, and leads the people to imagine, that their ancestors have done every thing possible to secure the happiness of society, and meliorate the condition of man, because they have done much.</P>
<P>When learning was confined to a small num∣ber of citizens of a state, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estigation of it's priviledges was left to a number still smaller, governments seem to have acted, as if the people were formed only for them; and, ingeniously confounding their rights with metaphysical jar∣gon, the luxurious grandeur of individuals has been supported by the misery of the bulk of their fellow creatures, and ambition gorged by the butchery of millions of innocent victims.</P>
<P>The most artful chain of depsotism has ever been supported by false notions of duty, enforced by those who were to profit by the cheat. Thus
<PB N="5" REF="029916_0017_0FE308F6F84EC798"/>
has the liberty of man been restrained; and the spontaneous flow of his feelings, which would have fertilized his mind, being choked at the source, he is rendered in the same degree unhappy as he is made unnatural. Yet, certain opinions, planted by superstition and despotism, hand in hand, have taken such deep root in our habits of thinking, it may appear daringly licentious, as well as presumptuous, to observe, that what is often termed virtue, is only want of courage to throw off prejudices, and follow the inclinations which fear not the eye of heaven, though they shrink from censure not founded on the natural principles of morality. But at no period has the scanty diffusion of knowledge permitted the body of the people to participate in the discussion of political science; and if philosophy at length hath simplified the principles of social union, so as to render them easy to be comprehended by every sane and thinking being; it appears to me, that man may contemplate with benevolent compla∣cency and becoming pride, the approaching reign of reason and peace.</P>
<P>Besides, if men have been rendered unquali∣fied to judge with precision of their civil and po∣litical rights, from the involved state in which so∣phisticating ignorance has placed them, and thus reduced to surrender their reasoning powers to noble fools, and pedantic knaves, it is not surpriz∣ing, that superficial observers have formed opi∣nions unfavourable to the degree of perfection, which our intellectual faculties are able to attain, or that despotism should attempt to check the spirit of inquity, which, with colossian strides, seems to be hastening the overthrow of oppressive tyranny and contumelious ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029916_0018_0FE30947939A0160"/>Nature having made men unequal, by giving stronger bodily and mental powers to one than to another, the end of government ought to be, to destroy this inequality by protecting the weak. Instead of which, it has always leaned to the op∣posite side, wearing itself out by disregarding the first principle of it's organization.</P>
<P>It appears to be the grand province of go∣vernment, though scarcely acknowledged, so to hold the balance, that the abilities or riches of individuals may not interfere with the equili∣brium of the whole. For as it is vain to expect, that men should master their passions during the heat of action, legislators should have this perfec∣tion of laws ever in view, when, calmly grasping the interest of humanity, reason assures them, that their own is best secured by the security of the common weal. The first social systems were certainly sounded by passion; individuals wishing to fence round their own wealth or power, and make slaves of their brothers to prevent en∣croachment. Their descendants have ever been at work to solder the chains they forged, and render the usurpations of strength secure, by the fraud of partial laws: laws that can be abrogated only by the exertions of reason, emancipating mankind, by making government a science, in∣stead of a craft, and civilizing the grand mass, by exercising their understandings about the most important objects of inquiry.</P>
<P>After the revolution in 1688, however, politi∣cal questions were no longer discussed in Eng∣land on a broad scale; because that degree of liberty was enjoyed, which enabled thinking men to pursue without interruption their own busi∣ness; or, if some men complained, they attached
<PB N="7" REF="029916_0019_0FE3090003448858"/>
themselves to a party, and descanted on the un∣avoidable misery produced by contending pas∣sions.</P>
<P>But in France the bitterness of oppression was mingled in the daily cup, and the serious folly of superstition, pampered by the sweat of labour, stared every man of sense in the face. Against superstition then did the writers contending for civil liberty principally direct their force, though the tyranny of the court increased with it's vici∣ousness.</P>

in England; so that there is not such a difference between the sentiments of the various ranks in one country, as is observable in the origin∣ality of character to be found in the other. At our theatres, the boxes, pit, and galleries, relish dif∣ferent scenes; and some are condescendingly both by the more polished part of the audience, to allow the rest to have their portion of amuse∣ment. In France, on the contrary, a highly wrought sentiment of morality, probably rather romantic than sublime, produces a burst of ap∣plause, when one heart seems to agitate every hand.</P>
<P>But men are not content merely to laugh at oppression, when they can scarcely catch from his gripe the necessaries of life; so that from writing epigrams on superstition, the galled French began to compose philippics against des∣potism. The enormous and iniquitous taxes, which the nobles, the clergy, and the monarch, levied on the people, turned the attention of be∣nevolence to this main branch of government, and the profound treatise of the humane M. Quesnai produced the sect of the <HI>economists,</HI> the first champions for civil liberty.</P>
<P>On the eve of the American war, the enlight∣ened administration of the comptroller general Turgot, a man formed in this school, afforded France a glimpse of Freedom, which, streaking the horizon of despotism, only served to render the contrast more striking. Eager to correct abuses, equally impolitic and cruel, this most excellent man, suffering his clear judgment to be clouded by his zeal, roused the nest of wasps, that rioted on the honey of industry in the sun∣shine

of court favour; and he was obliged to retire from the office, which he so worthily filled. Disappointed in his noble plan of freeing France from the fangs of despotism, in the course of ten years, without the miseries of anarchy, which make the present generation pay very dear for the emancipation of posterity, he has never∣theless greatly contributed to produce that re∣volution in opinion, which perhaps, alone can overturn the empire of tyranny.</P>
<P>The idle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prices of an effeminate court had long given the tone to the awe-struck populace, who, stupidly admiring what they did not under∣stand, lived on a <HI>vive le roi,</HI> whilst his blood∣sucking minions drained every vein, that should have warmed their honest hearts.</P>
<P>But the irresistible energy of the moral and political sentiments of half a century, at last kindled into a blaze the illuminating rays of truth, which, throwing new light on the men∣tal powers of man, and giving a fresh spring to his reasoning faculties, completely undermined the strong holds of priestcraft and hypocrisy.</P>
<P>At this glorious era, the toleration of religious opinions in America, which the spirit of the times, when that continent was peopled with persecuted Europeans, produced, aided, not a little, to dif∣fuse these rational sentiments, and exhibited the phenomenon of a government established on the basis of reason and equality. The eyes of all Europe were watchfully fixed on the practical success of this experiment in political science; and whilst the crowns of the old world were drawing into their focus the hard-earned re∣compence of the toil and care of the simple citi∣zens,
<PB N="10" REF="029916_0022_0FE3094AC441F358"/>
who lived detached from courts, deprived of the comforts of life, the just reward of industry, or, palsied by oppression, pined in dirt and idle∣ness; the Anglo-Americans appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be an∣other race of beings, men formed to enjoy the advantages of society, and not merely to benefit those who governed; the use to which they had been appropriated in almost every state; con∣sidered only as the ballast which keeps the vessel steady, necessary, yet dispised. So conspicuous in fact was the difference, that, when Frenchmen became the auxiliaries of those brave people, during their noble struggle against the tyrannical and inhuman ambition of the British court, it imparted to them that stimulus, which alone was wanting to give wings to freedom, who, hover∣ing over France, led her indignant votaries to wreak their vengeance on the tottering fabric of a government, the foundation of which had been laid by benighted ignorance, and its walls ce∣mented by the calamities of millions that mock calculation—and, in its ruins a system was en∣tombed, the most baneful to human happiness and virtue.</P>
<P>America fortunately found herself in a situ∣ation very different from all the rest of the world; for she had it in her power to lay the first stones of her government, when reason was venturing to canvass prejudice. Availing her∣self of the degree of civilization of the world, she has not retained those customs, which were only the expedients of barbarism; or thought that constitutions formed by chance, and con∣tinually patched up, were superior to the plans of reason, at liberty to profit by experience.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="029916_0023_0FE309030BFE4448"/>When society was first regulated, the laws could not be adjusted so as to take in the future conduct of its members, because the faculties of man are unfolded and perfected by the improve∣ments made by society; consequently the regula∣tions established as circumstances required were very imperfect. What then is to hinder man, at each epoch of civilization, from making a stand, and new modelling the materials, that have been ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly thrown into a rude mass, which time a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> has consolidated and rendered venerable?</P>
<P>When society was first subjugated to laws, probably by the ambition of some, and the desire of safety in all, it was natural for men to be selfish, because they were ignorant how intimately their own comfort was connected with that of others; and it was also very natural, that hu∣manity, rather the effect of feeling than of reason, should have a very limited range. But, when men once see, clear as the light of heaven,—and I hail the glorious day from afar!—that on the general happiness depends their own, reason will give strength to the fluttering wings of passion, and men will "<HI>do unto others, what they wish they should do unto them.</HI>"</P>
<P>What has hitherto been the political perfection of the world? In the two most celebrated nations it has only been a polish of manners, an ex∣tension of that family love, which is rather the effect of sympathy and selfish passion, than reason∣able humanity. And in what has ended the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so much extolled patriotism? In vain glory and barbarity—every page of history proclaims. And why has the enthusiasm for virtue thus passed
<PB N="12" REF="029916_0024_0FE3094C47E85A60"/>
away like the dew of the morning, dazzling the eyes of its admirers? Why?—because it was factitious virtue.</P>
<P>During the period they had to combat against oppression, and rear an infant state, what in∣stances of heroism do not the annals of Greece and Rome display! But it was merely the blaze of passion, "live smoke;" for after vanquishing their enemies, and making the most astonishing sacrifices to the glory of their country, they be∣came civil tyrants, and preyed on the very society, for whose welfare it was easier to die, than to practise the sober duties of life, which insinuate through it the contentment that is rather felt than seen. Like the parents who forget all the dictates of justice and humanity, to aggrandize the very children whom they keep in a state of dependence, these heroes loved their country, because it was their country, ever showing by their conduct, that it was only a part of a narrow love of themselves.</P>
<P>It is time, that a more enlightened moral love of mankind should supplant, or rather support physical affections. It is time, that the youth ap∣proaching manhood should be led by princi∣ples, and not hurried along by sensations—and then we may expect, that the heroes of the present generation, still having their monsters to cope with, will labour to establish such rational laws throughout the world, that men will not rest in the dead letter, or become artificial beings as they become civilized.</P>
<P>We must get entirely clear of all the notions drawn from the wild traditions of original sin: the eating of the apple, the theft of Prometheus,
<PB N="13" REF="029916_0025_0FE30911EEFF6328"/>
the opening of Pandora's box, and the other fables, too tedious to enumerate, on which priests have erected their tremendous structures of imposition, to persuade us, that we are natu∣rally inclined to evil: we shall then leave room for the expansion of the human heart, and, I trust, find, that men will insensibly render each other happier as they grow wiser. It is indeed the necessity of stifling many of its most sponta∣neous desires, to obtain the factitious virtues of society, that makes man vicious, by depriving him of that dignity of character, which rests only on truth. For it is not paradoxical to assert, that the social virtues are nipt in the bud by the very laws of society. One principle of action is sufficient—Respect thyself—whether it be termed fear of God—religion; love of justice—morality; or, self-love—the desire of happiness. Yet, how can a man respect himself; and if not, how be∣lieve in the existence of virtue; when he is prac∣tising the daily shifts, which do not come under the cognisance of the law, in order to obtain a respectable situation in life? It seems, in fact, to be the business of a civilized man, to harden his heart, that on it he may sharpen the wit; which, assuming the appellation of sagacity, or cunning, in different characters, is only a proof, that the head is clear, because the heart is cold.</P>
<P>Besides, one great cause of misery in the present imperfect state of society is, that the imagination, continually tantalized, becomes the inflated wen of the mind, draining off the nourishment from the vital parts. Nor would it, I think, be stretching the inference too far, to insist, that
<PB N="14" REF="029916_0026_0FE3095320D9E1B0"/>
men become vicious in the same proportion as they are obliged, by the defects of society, to submit to a kind of self-denial, which ignorance, not morals, prescribes.</P>
<P>But these evils are passing away; a new spirit has gone forth, to organise the body-politic; and where is the criterion to be found, to esti∣mate the means, by which the influence of this spirit can be confined, now enthroned in the hearts of half the inhabitants of the globe? Reason has, at last, shown her captivating face, beaming with benevolence; and it will be im∣possible for the dark hand of despotism again to obscure its radiance, or the lurking dagger of subordinate tyrants to reach her bosom. The image of God implanted in our nature is now more rapidly expanding; and, as it opens, liberty with maternal wing, seems to be soaring to re∣gions far above vulgar annoyance, promising to shelter all mankind.</P>
<P>It is a vulgar error, built on a superficial view of the subject, though it seems to have the sanc∣tion of experience, that civilization can only go as far as it has hitherto gone, and then must necessarily fall back into barbarism. Yet thus much appears certain, that a state will infallibly grow old and feeble, if hereditary riches support hereditary rank, under any description. But when courts and primogeniture are done away, and simple equal laws are established, what is to prevent each generation from retaining the vigour of youth?—What can weaken the body or mind, when the great majority of society must exercise both, to earn a subsistence, and acquire respectability?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="029916_0027_0FE3090490F61638"/>The French revolution is a strong proof how far things will govern men, when simple prin∣ciples begin to act with one powerful spring against the complicated wheels of ignorance; numerous in proportion to their weakness, and constantly wanting repair, because expedients of the moment are ever the spawn of cowardly folly, or the narrow calculations of selfishness. To elucidate this truth, it is not necessary to rake among the ashes of barbarous ambition; to show the ignorance and consequent folly of the monarchs, who ruled with a rod of iron, when the hordes of European savages began to form their governments; though the review of this portion of history would clearly prove, that narrowness of mind naturally produces ferocious∣ness of temper.</P>
<P>We may boast of the poetry of those ages, and of those charming flights of imagination, which, during the paroxysms of passion, flash out in those single acts of heroic virtue, that throw a lustre over a whole thoughtless life; but the cultivation of the understanding, in spite of these northern lights, appears to be the only way to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me men, whose restlessness of spirit create the vicious pas∣sions, that lead to tyranny and cruelty. When the body is strong, and the blood warm, men do not like to think, or adopt any plan of conduct, unless broken-in by degrees: the force that has often spent itself in fatal activity becomes a rich source of energy of mind.</P>
<P>Men exclaim, only noticing the evil, against the luxury introduced with the arts and sciences; when it is obviously the cultivation of these alone,
<PB N="16" REF="029916_0028_0FE309556F4CE6E8"/>
emphatically termed the arts of peace, that can turn the sword into a plough-share. War is the adventure naturally pursued by the idle, and it requires something of this species, to excite the strong emotions necessary to rouse inactive minds. Ignorant people, when they appear to reflect, ex∣ercise their imagination more than their under∣standing; indulging reveries, instead of pursuing a train of thinking; and thus grow romantic, like the croisaders; or like women, who are com∣monly idle and restless.</P>
<P>If we turn then with disgust from ensanguined regal pomp, and the childish raree-shows that amuse the enslaved multitude, we shall feel still more contempt for that order of men, who cul∣tivated their faculties, only to enable them to consolidate their power, by leading the ignorant astray; making the learning they concentrated in their cells, a more polished instrument of op∣pression. Struggling with so many impediments, the progress of useful knowledge for several ages was scarcely perceptible; though respect for the public opinion, that great softener of manners, and only substitute for moral principles, was gaining ground.</P>
<P>The croisades, however, gave a shake to so∣ciety, that changed its face; and the spirit of chivalry, assuming a new character during the reign of the gallant Francis the first, began to meliorate the ferocity of the ancient Gauls and Franks. The <HI>point d'honneur</HI> being settled, the character of a <HI>gentleman,</HI> held ever since so dear in France, was gradually formed; and this kind of bastard morality, frequently the only substitute
<PB N="17" REF="029916_0029_0FE3090D378FFBD8"/>
for all the the ties that nature has rendered sacred, kept those men within bounds, who obeyed no other law.</P>
<P>The same spirit mixed with the sanguinary treachery of the Guises, and gave support to the manly dignity of Henry the fourth, on whom nature had bestowed that warmth of constitution, tenderness of heart, and rectitude of understand∣ing, which naturally produce an energetic cha∣racter—A supple force, that, exciting love, com∣mands esteem.</P>
<P>During the ministry of Richelieu, when the dynasty of <HI>favouritism</HI> commenced, the arts were patronized, and the Italian mode of governing by intrigue to weaken bodies, polished by the friction of continual finesse. Dissimulation im∣perceptibly slides into falshood, and Mazarin, dissimulation personified, paved the way for the imposing pomp and false grandeur of the reign of the haughty and inflated Louis XIV. which, by introducing a taste for majestic frivolity, acce∣lerated the perfection of that species of civiliza∣tion, which consists in the refining of the senses at the expence of the heart; the source of all real dignity, honour, virtue, and every noble quality of the mind. Endeavouring to make bigotry tolerate voluptuousness, and honour and licentiousness shake hands, sight was lost of the line of distinction, or vice was hid under the mask of it's correlative virtue. The glory of France, a bubble raised by the heated breath of the king, was the pretext for undermining hap∣piness; whilst politeness took place of humanity, and created that sort of dependence, which leads men to barter their co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and wire, for unwhole∣some

mixtures of they know not what, that, flat∣tering a depraved appetite, destroyed the tone of the stomach.</P>
<P>The feudal taste for tournaments and martial feasts was now naturally succeeded by a fondness for theatrical entertainments; when feats of va∣lour became too great an exertion of the weak∣ened muscles to afford pleasure, and men found that resource in cultivation of mind which ren∣ders activity of body less necessary to keep the stream of life from stagnating.</P>
<P>All the pieces written at this period, except Moliere's, reflected the manners of the court, and thus pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verted the forming taste. That ex∣traordinary man alone wrote on the grand scale of human passions, for mankind at large, leaving to inferior authors the task of imitating the drapery of manners, which points out the <HI>costume</HI> of the age.</P>
<P>Corneille, like our Dryden, often tottering on the brink of absurdity and nonsense, full of noble ideas, which, crouding indistinctly on his fancy, he expresses obscurely, still delights his readers by sketching faint cut-lines of gigantic passions; and, whilst the charmed imagination is lured to follow him over enchanted ground, the heart is sometimes unexpectedly touched by a sublime o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pathetic sentiment, true to nature.</P>
<P>Racine, soon after, in elegant harmonious lan∣guage painted the manners of his time, and with great judgment gave a picturesque cast to many unnatural scenes and factitious sentiments: always endeavouring to make his characters amiable, he is unable to render them dignified; and the refined morality, scattered throughout, belongs

to the code of politeness rather than to that of virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What else could be expected from the courtier, who could write in these terms to madame de Maintenon; <HI>God has been so gracious to me, madam, that, in whatever com∣pany I find myself, I never have occasion to blush for the gospel or the king.</HI></NOTE>. Fearing to stray from courtly propriety of behaviour, and shock a fastidious audience, the gallantry of his heroes interests only the gal∣lant, and literary people, whose minds are open to different species of amusement. He was, in fact, the father of the French stage. Nothing can equal the fondness which the French suck in with their milk for public places, particularly the theatre; and this taste, giving the tone to their conduct, has produced so many stage tricks on the grand theatre of the nation, where old principles vamped up with new scenes and decor∣ations, are continually represented.</P>
<P>Their national character is, perhaps more form∣ed by their theatrical amusements, than is gene∣rally imagined: they are in reality the schools of vanity. And, after this kind of education, is it surprising, that almost every thing is said and done for stage effect? or that cold declamatory ex∣tasies blaze forth, only to mock the expectation with a show of warmth?</P>
<P>Thus sentiments spouted from the lips come oftner from the head than the heart. Indeed natural sentiments are only the characters given by the imagination to recollected sensations; but the French, by the continual gratification of their senses, stifle the reveries of their imagination, which always requires to be acted upon by out∣ward objects; and seldom reflecting on their feelings, their sensations are ever lively and tran∣sitory

exhaled by every passing beam, and dis∣sipated by the slightest storm.</P>
<P>If a relish for the broad mirth of <HI>fun</HI> charac∣terize the lower class of English, the French of every denomination are equally delighted with a phosphorical, sentimental gilding. This is con∣stantly observable at the theatres. The passions are deprived of all their radical strength, to give smoothness to the ranting sentiments, which, with mock dignity, like the party-coloured rags on the shrivelled branches of the tree of liberty, stuck up in every village, are displayed as some∣thing very grand and significant.</P>
<P>The wars of Louis were, likewise, theatrical exhibitions; and the business of his life was ad∣justing ceremonials, of which he himself became the dupe, when his grandeur was in the wane, and his animal spirits were spent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For example, the reception of a Portuguese adventur∣er, under the character of a Persian ambassador.

But, to∣wards the close even of his reign, the writings of Fenelon, and the conversation of his pupil, the duke of Burgundy, gave rise to different politi∣cal discussions, of which the theoretical basis was the happiness of the people—till death, spreading a huge pall over the family and glory of Louis, compassion draws his faults under the same awful canopy, and we sympathize with the man in adversity whose prosperity was pestife∣rous.</P>
<P>Louis, by imposing on the senses of his people, gave a new turn to the chivalrous humour of the age: for, with the true spirit of quixotism, the French made a point of honour of adoring
<PB N="21" REF="029916_0033_0FE30910692EC920"/>
their king; and the glory of the <HI>grand monarque</HI> became the national pride, even when it cost them most dear.</P>
<P>As a proof of the perversion of mind at that period, and the false political opinions which prevailed, making the unhappy king the slave of his own despotism, it is sufficient to select one anecdote.</P>
<P>A courtier assures us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires du marechal de Richelieu.</NOTE>, that the most humi∣liating circumstance that ever happened to the king, and one of those which gave him most pain, was the publication of a memorial circulated with great diligence by his enemies throughout France.

<P>It almost surpasses belief to add, that, in spite of the imprisonment, exile, flight, or execution of two millions of French, this memorial, pro∣duced little effect. But the king, who was severely hurt, took care to have a reply writ∣ten <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In this reply will be found many of the reasons, that have been lately repeated; and some (a proof of the pro∣gress of reason), which no one had the audacity to re∣peat when standing up in defence of privileges.</NOTE>; though he might have comforted himself with the recollection, that, when they were last assembled, Loui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> XIII. dismissed them with empty promises, forgotten as soon as made.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="029916_0034_0FE308CF4BB2B488"/>The enthusiasm of the French, which, in general, hurries them from one extreme to ano∣ther, at this time produced a total exchange of manners.</P>
<P>During the regency, vice was not only bare∣saced, but audacious; and the tide completely turned: the hypocrites were now all ranged on the other side, the courtiers, labouring to show their abhorrence of religious hypocrisy, set decency at defiance, and did violence to the modesty of nature, when they wished to outrage the squeamish puerilities of superstition.</P>
<P>In the character of the regent we may trace all the vices and graces of false refinement; form∣ing the taste by destroying the heart. Devoted to pleasure, he so soon exhausted the intoxicating cup of all its sweets, that his life was spent in search∣ing amongst the dregs, for the novelty that could give a gasp of life to enjoyment. The wit, which at first was the zest of his nocturnal orgies, soon gave place, as flat, to the grossest excesses, in which the principal variety was flagitious im∣morality. And what has he done to rescue his name from obloquy, but protect a few debauched artists and men of letters? His goodness of heart only appeared in sympathy. He pitied the dis∣tresses of the people, when before his eyes; and as quickly forgot these yearnings of heart in his sensual stye.</P>
<P>He often related, with great pleasure, an anecdote of the prior de Vendome, who chanced to please a mistress of Charles II, and the king could only get rid of his rival by requesting Louis XIV. to recal him.

<P>DURING this general depravation of man∣ners, the young and beautiful <HI>dauphine</HI> arrived; and was received with a kind of idolatrous ado∣ration, only to be seen in France; for the in∣habitants of the metropolis, literally speaking, could think and talk of nothing else; and in their eagerness to pay homage, or gratify af∣fectionate curiosity, an immense number were killed.</P>
<P>In such a voluptuous atmosphere, how could she escape contagion? The prosligacy of Louis XIV. when love and war were his amusements, was soberness, compared with the capricious intemperance of the inebriated imagination at this period. Madame du Barry was then in the zenith of her power, which quickly excited the jealousy of this princess whose strongest passion was that
<PB N="25" REF="029916_0037_0FE3091CECE145E8"/>
intolerable family pride, which heated the blood of the whole house of Austria. An inclination for court intrigue, under the mask of the most profound dissimulation, to preserve the favour of Louis XV. was instantly called into action; and it soon became the only business of life, either to gratify resentment, or cheat the satiety, which the continual and unrestrained indulgence of plea∣sure produced.</P>
<P>Her character thus formed, when she became absolute mistress, the court of the passive Louis, not only the most dissolute and abandoned that ever displayed the folly of royalty, but au∣daciously negligent with respect to that attention to decency, which is necessary to delude the vul∣gar, was deserted by all persons, who had any regard for their moral character, or the decorum of appearances. Constrained by the <HI>etiquette,</HI> which made the principal part of the imposing grandeur of Louis XIV. the queen wished to throw aside the cumbersome brocade of cere∣mony, without having discernment enough to perceive, that it was necessary to lend mock dignity to a court, where there was not sufficient virtue, or native beauty, to give interest or re∣spectability to simplicity. The harlot is seldom such a fool as to neglect her meretricious orna∣ments, unless she renounces her trade; and the pageantry of courts is the same thing on a larger scale. The lively predilection, likewise, of the queen for her native country, and love for her brother Joseph, to whom she repeatedly sent con∣siderable sums, purloined from the public, ended greatly to inspire the most ineffable contempt for royalty, now stript of the frippery which had

concealed its deformity: and the sovereign dis∣gust excited by her ruinous vices, completely des∣troying all reverence for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> majesty, to which power alone lent dignity, contempt soon produced hatred</P>
<P>The famous transaction of the necklace, in which she was probably the dupe of the knaves she fostered, exasperated also both the nobility and the clergy; and with her messalinian feasts at <HI>Trianon,</HI> made her the common mark of ridicule and satire.</P>
<P>The attention of the people once roused was not permitted to steep; for fresh circumstances daily occurred, to give a new spring to discussions, that the most iniquitous and heavy taxes brought home to every bosom; till the extravagance of the royal family became the general subject of sharp∣ening execrations.</P>
<P>The king, who had not sufficient resolution to support the administration of Turgot, whom his disposition for moderation had chosen, being at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loss what measures to take, called to the helm the plausible Necker. He, only half com∣prehending the plans of his able predecessor, was led by his vanity cautiously to adopt them; first publishing his <HI>Compte-rendu,</HI> to clear the way to popularity. This work was read with astonish∣ing rapidity by all ranks of men; and alarming the courtiers, Necker was, in his turn, dismissed. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> retired to write his observations on the admi∣nistration of the finances, which kept alive the spirit of inquiry, that afterwards broke the talis∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of courts, and showed the disenchanted mul∣titude, that those whom they had been taught to respect as supernatural beings, were not indeed
<PB N="27" REF="029916_0039_0FE3091E719D33D0"/>
men—but monsters; deprived by their station of humanity, and even sympathy.</P>
<P>Several abortive attempts were then made by two succeeding ministers, to keep alive the public credit, and find resources to supply the expendi∣ture of the state, and the dissipation of the court, when the king was persuaded to place the spe∣cious Calonne at the head of these embarrassed affairs.</P>
<P>During the prodigal administration of this man, who acted with an audacity peculiar to the arrogance common in men of superficial yet brilliant talents, every consideration was sacrificed to the court; the splended folly and wanton pro∣digality of which eclipsing all that has been related in history, or told in romance, to amuse wonder∣ing fools, only served to accelerate the destruction of public credit, and hasten the revolution, by exciting the clamorous indignation of the people. Numberless destructive expedients of the moment brought money into the state coffers, only to be dissipated by the royal family, and its train of parasites; till, all falling, the wish of still support∣ing himself in a situation so desirable as tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of comptroller-general of the finances, determined him to convene an assembly of <HI>Notables;</HI> whose very appellation points them out as men in the aristocratical interest.</P>
<P>Louis XVI. with a considerable portion of common sense, and a desire to promote useful reformation, though always governed by those around him, gave without hesitation the necessary orders for calling together the assembly, that afforded the wearied nation the most pleasing prospect, because it was a new one; but convey∣ed

to their astonished minds at the same time the knowledge of the enormity of a <HI>deficit,</HI> which a series of vice and folly had augmented beyond all precedent.</P>
<P>The immoralities of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onne, however, had created a general distrust of all his designs: but with an overweening presumption, the charac∣teristic of the man, he still thought, that he could dexterously obtain the supplies wanted to keep the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els of government in motion, and quiet the clamours of the nation, by proposing the equali∣zation of taxes; which, humbling the nobility and dignified clergy, who were thus to be brought down from their privileged height, to the level of citizens, could not fail to be grateful to the rest of the nation. And the parliaments, he con∣cluded, would not dare to opppse his system, lest they should draw on themselves the distrust and hatred of the public.</P>
<P>Without canvassing Calonne's intentions, which the most enlarged charity, after his former ex∣travagance, can scarce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y suppose to have been the interest of the people, moderate men ima∣gined this project might have been productive of much good; giving the French all the liberty they were able to digest; and, warding off the tumults that have since produced so many disastrous events, whilst coolly preparing them for the re∣ception of more, the effervescence of vanity and ignorance would not have rendered their heads giddy, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their hearts savage. Yet some sensible observers, on the contrary, rather adopted the opinion, that as the people had discovered the magnitude of the <HI>deficit,</HI> they were now persuaded that a specific remedy was wanting, <HI>a new con∣stitution;</HI>

to cure the evils, which were the ex∣crescences of a gigantic tyranny, that appeared to be draining away the vital juices of labour, to fill the insatiable jaws of thousands of fawning slaves and idle sycophants. But though the people might, for the present, have been satis∣fied with this salutary reform, which would gradually have had an effect, reasoning from analogy, that the financier did not take into his account, the nobility were not sufficiently en∣lightened to listen to the dictates of justice or prudence. It had been, indeed, the system of ministers, ever since Richelieu, to humble the nobles, to increase the power of the court, and as the ministry, the generals, and the bishops, were always noble, they aided to support the favourite, who depressed the whole body, only for the chance of individual preferment. But this bare-faced attempt to abolish their privileges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ised a nest of hornets about his ears, eager to secure the plunder on which they lived; for by what other name can we call the pensions, places, and even estates of those who, taxing in∣dustry, rioted in idleness duty free<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the constituent assembly equalized the impost, Calonne has beasted, that he proposed a mode of levying equal taxes; but that the nobility would not listen to any such motion, tenaciously maintaining their privileges. This blind obstinacy of opposing all reform, that touched their exemptions, may be reckoned among the foremost causes, which, in hurrying the removal of old abuses, tended to introduce violence and disorder.—And if it be kept in remembrance, that a conduct equally illiberal and disin∣genuous warped all their political sentiments, it must be clear, that the people, from whom they considered them∣selves as separated by immutable laws, had cogent grounds to conclude, that it would be impossible to effect a re∣form of the greater part of those perplexing exemptions and arbitrary customs, the weight of which made the pe∣culiar urgency, and called with the most forcible energy for the revolution. Surely all the folly of the people taken together was less reprehensible, than this total want of discernment, this adherence to a prejudice, the jaundiced perception of contumelious ignorance, in a class of men, who from the opportunity they had of ac∣quiring knowledge, ought to have acted with more judg∣ment For they were goaded into action by inhuman provocations, by acts of the most flagrant injustice, when they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either rule nor experience to direct them, and after their temperance had been destroyed by years of sufferings, and an endless catalogue of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated and con∣temptuous privations.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="029916_0042_0FE309684EEE3848"/>An approaching national bankruptcy was the ostensible reason assigned for the convening of the <HI>notables</HI> in 1787; but the convocation, in truth, ought to be ascribed to the voice of reason, sounded through the organ of twenty-five mil∣lions of human beings, who, though under the fetters of a detestable tyranny, felt, that the crisis was at hand, when the rights of man and his dignity ascertained were to be enthroned on the eternal basis of justice and humanity.</P>

and even the accusation brought against Calonne, by La Fayette, of exchanging the national do∣mains, and appropriating millions of it's revenue to gratify the queen, the count d'Artois, and the rest of the cabal, who kept him in place, was ge∣nerally believed. In fact, the state had been fleeced, to support the unremitting demands of the queen; who would have dismembered France, to aggrandize Austria, and pamper her favour∣ites. Thus the court conniving at peculation, the minister played a sure game; whilst the ho∣nest labourer was groaning under a thousand abuses, and yielding the solace of his industry, or the hoards, which youthful strength had re∣served for times of scarcity or decrepit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to irritate the increasing wants of a thoughtless, treacherous princess, and the avarice of her un∣principled agents.</P>
<P>This artful, though weak, machiavelian poli∣tician, suffered no other person to approach the king; who, seduced into confidence by his col∣loquial powers, could not avoid being dazzled by his plausible schemes. He had, nevertheless, a powerful enemy to contend with, in M. de Breteuil; who, having gratified some of the little passions of the dauphine, during her first strug∣gles for dominion, was now protected by the absolute power of the queen. Endeavouring to measure his strength with her's, the minister was discomfited; and the whole swarm of flat∣terers, who had partaken of the spoil of rapine, were instantly alert to open the eyes of Louis, over which they had long been scattering pop∣pies, and soon convinced him of the perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy of his favourite; whilst the two privileged orders
<PB N="32" REF="029916_0044_0FE309758F96BCE8"/>
joined their forces, to overwhelm their common enemy, attending to their vengeance at the very time they followed the dictates of prudence.</P>
<P>The accusations of La Fayette served, perhaps, as the ostensible reason with the public, and even with the king; yet it can hardly be sup∣posed, that they had any affect on the cabal, who invented, or connived at the plans necessary to raise a continual supply for their pleasures. The fact is, that, most probably being found un∣equal to the task, or no longer choosing to be a docile instrument of mischief, he was thrown aside as unfit for use.</P>
<P>Disgraced, he quickly retired to his estate; but was not long permitted to struggle with the malady of exiled ministers, in the gloomy silence of inactivity; for, hearing that he had been denounced by the parliament, he fled in a trans∣port of rage out of the kingdom, covered with the execrations of an injured people, in whose hatred, or admiration, the mellowed shades of reflection are seldom seen.</P>
<P>The extravagance of his administration ex∣ceeded that of any other scourge of France; yet it does not appear, that he was actuated by a plan, or even desire, of enriching himself. So far from it, with wild prodigality he seems to have squandered away the vast sums he extorted by force or fraud, merely to gratify or purchase friends and dependents; till, quite exhausted, he was obliged to have recourse to Necker's scheme of loans. But not possessing like him the con∣sidence of the public, he could not with equal facility obtain a present supply, the weight of which would be thrown forward to become a

stumbling block to his successors. Necker, by the advantageous terms which he held out to money-holders, had introduced a perpiclous sys∣tem of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock-j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, that was slowly detect∣ed, because those who could have best opened the eyes of the people were interested to keep them closed — Still Calonne could not induce the same body of men to trust to his offers; which, not choosing to accept, they made a point of discrediting, to secure the interest and exorbitant premiums that were daily becoming due.</P>
<P>With an uncommon quickness of comprehen∣sion, and audacity in pursuing crude schemes, rendered plausible by a rhetorical flow of words, Calonne, a strong representative of the national character, seems rather to have wanted princi∣ples than feelings of humanity; and to have been led astray more by vanity and the love of pleasure, which imperceptibly smooth away mo∣ral restraints, than by those deep plans of guilt, that force men to see the extent of the mischief they are hatching, whilst the crocodile is still in the egg. Yet as mankind, ever judge by events, the inconsiderate presumption, if not the turpi∣tude of his conduct, brought on him universal censure: for, at a crisis when the general groans of an oppressed nation proclaimed the disease of the state, and even when the government was on the verge of dissolution, did he not waste the treasures of his country, forgetful not only of moral obligations, but the ties of honour, of that regard for the tacit confidence of it's citi∣zens, which a statesmen ought to hold sacred? since which he has been caressed at almost

<P>Reflecting on the conduct of the tools of courts, we are enabled in a great measure to account for the slavery of Europe; and to discover, that it's misery has not arisen more from the imperfection of civilization, than from the fallacy of those political systems, which neces∣sarily made the favourite of the day a knavish tyrant, eager to amass riches to save himself from oblivion, when the honours, so hardly wrestled for, should be torn from his brow. Besides, whilst ministers have found impunity in the om∣nipotence, which the seal of power gave them, and in the covert fear of those who hoped one day to enjoy the same emoluments, they have been led by the prevalence of depraved man∣ners, to the commission of every atrocious folly. Kings have been the dupes of ministers, of mis∣tresses, and secretaries, not to notice sly valets and cunning waiting maids, who are seldom idle; and these are most venal, because they have least independency of character to support; till in the circle of corruption no one can point out the first mover. Hence proceeds the great tenacity of courts to support them; hence originates their great objection to republican forms of govern∣ment, which obliged their ministers to be ac∣countable for delinquency; and hence, likewise, might be traced their agonizing fears of the doc∣trine of civil equality.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Administration of de Brienne. Dissolution of the Notables. Land Tax and Stamp Duty recommended by them, but refused to be sanctioned by the Parliament. Bed of Justice. The Parliament banished to Troyes,—but soon compromised for it's recall. Struggles of the Court-party to prevent the convocation of the States-General.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the dismission of Calonne, M. de Brienne, a man whose talents Turgot had over∣rated, was now chosen by the queen, because he had formerly seconded her views, and was still the obsequious slave of that power, which he had long been courting, to obtain the so much envied place of minister. Having taken more pains to gain the post than to prepare himself to fulfil it's functions, his weak and timid mind was in a continual tumult; and he adopted with head∣long confusion the taxes proposed by his prede∣cessor; because money must be had, and he knew not where to turn to procure it by an unhacknied mode of extortion.</P>
<P>The <HI>notables</HI> were now dissolved; and it would have been a natural consequence of the dismis∣sion
<PB N="36" REF="029916_0048_0FE308AAFB0AA3A8"/>
of the minister who assembled them, even if their spirited inquiries had not rendered their presence vexatious to the court. This, how∣ever, was an impolitic measure; for they returned highly disgusted to their respective abodes, to propagate the free opinions, to which resentment and argumentation had given birth.</P>
<P>Before the breaking up of the <HI>notables,</HI> they were nevertheless prevailed upon to recommend a land and stamp tax; and the edicts were sent to the parliament to be enregistered. But these magistrates, never forgetting that they enjoyed, in virtue of their office, the privileged exemption from taxes, to elude sanctioning the first, which was to have been an equal impost, took advan∣tage of the public odiousness of the second; thus avoiding, with a show of patriotism, an avowed opposition to the interest of the people, that would clearly have proved, how much dearer they held their own.</P>
<P>The gaudy and meretricious pageantry of the court was now displayed, to intimidate the par∣liament, at what was termed a bed of justice, though in reality of all justice a solemn mockery; and, whilst pretending to consult them, the edicts were enregistered by a mandate of state. The parliament, in the mean time, making a merit of necessity, declared, that the right of sanctioning the impost belonged only to the state-general, the convocation of which they demanded. Pro∣voked by their s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urdy opposition, the court ba∣nished them to Troyes; and they compromised for their recall by enregistering the prolongation of the <HI>deuxieme vingtieme,</HI> a cowardly desertion of their former ground.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="029916_0049_0FE309A27338F9E0"/>A century before (a proof of the progress of reason) the people, digesting their disappointment, would have submitted, with brutal acquiescence, to the majestic WILL of the king, without daring to scan it's import; but now, recognizing their own dignity, they insisted, that all authority, which did not originate with them, was illegal and despotic, and loudly sounded the grand truth—That it was necessary to convoke the states-general. The government, however, like a dying wretch cut off by intemperance, whilst the lust of enjoyment still remaining prompts him to exhaust his strength by struggling with death, fought some time longer inauspiciously for existence, depending on the succour of the court empirics, who vainly flattered themselves, that they could prevent it's dissolution, From the moment, indeed, that Brienne succeeded Ca∣lonne, all the machinery, which the demon of despotism could invent, was put into motion, to divert the current of opinion, bearing on it's fair bosom the new sentiments of liberty with irre∣sistible force, and overwhelming, as it swelled, the perishing monuments of venerable folly, and the fragile barriers of superstitious igno∣rance.</P>
<P>But supplies were still wanting; and the court, being fruitful in stratagems to procure a loan, which was the necessary lever of it's insidious designs, coalesced with some of the members of the parliament, and the agreement was to have been ratified in a <HI>séance royale.</HI> Yet, as the par∣liament had determined to be governed by a clear majority, the scheme of the keeper of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ais, who intended to have the business hurried
<PB N="38" REF="029916_0050_0FE308B3D4EEAC50"/>
over without telling the votes, was completely defeated.</P>
<P>The discovery of this unfair attempt made the indignant magistrates, glad to seize an occasion to recover their popularity, maintain with bold∣ness their own character, and the interest of the people. The duke of Orleans, also, somewhat tauntingly suggesting to the king, that this was only another bed of justice, was exiled, with two other members, who had remonstrated with courage. These magistrates, now became the objects of public adoration, were considered by the grateful public as their only bulwark against the attacks of the ministry; which continued to harass invention, to contrive means to counteract a concurrence of circumstances, that were driv∣ing before them all opposition.</P>
<P>The court, for I consider the government, at this period completely at an end, continued to stumble out of one blunder into another, till at last they rested all their hopes on the popular reforms projected by Brienne, in conjunction with Lamoignon, a man with more strength of character, to cajole the people and crush the parliament. Several strokes, the feeble blows of angry men, who wished still to retain the stolen sweets of office, were aimed at this body, calculated to mislead the people who, were also promised a reformed code of penal laws. But the time when partial remedies would have been eagerly swallowed was past, and the people saw distinctly, that their will would soon be law, and their power omnipotent. But the minister, Brienne, not aware of this, to steer clear of further opposition, proposed the plan of a <HI>cour
<PB N="39" REF="029916_0051_0FE309A41181C408"/>
pléniere:</HI> an heterogeneous assembly of princes, nobles, magistrates, and soldiers. A happy sub∣stitute, as he imagined, for the parliament; and which, by restoring the ancient forms of the kings of France, would awe and amuse the peo∣ple. He did not consider, that their minds were now full of other objects, and their enthusiasm turned into another channel.</P>
<P>This conduct proved more destructive to the court than any former folly it's advisers had committed. Imbecility now characterized every measure. The parliament, however, fell into the snare, and forfeited the esteem and confidence of the people by opposing some popular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> par∣ticularly one in favour of the protestants, which they themselves had demanded ten years before, and to which they now objected, only because it came from another quarter. Yet the court, re∣gardless of experience, endeavoured to restore it's credit by persecution; whilst, making all the clashing movements that fear could dictate to manifest it's power and overawe the nation, it united all parties, and drew the whole kingdom to one point of action.</P>
<P>The despotic and extravagant steps taken to give efficiency to the <HI>cour pléniere,</HI> awakened the sensibility of the most torpid; and the vigilance of twenty-five millions of centinels was roused, to watch the movements of the court, and follow it's corrupt ministers, through all the labyrinths of sophistry and tergiversation, into the very dens of their nefarious machinations. To pre∣vent the different parliaments from deliberating, and forming in consequence a plan of conduct together, the edict to sanction this packed cabinet
<PB N="40" REF="029916_0052_0FE308D94486EB98"/>
was to be presented to them all on the same day; and a considerable force was assembled, to inti∣midate the members, who should dare to prove refractory. But, they were forewarned in time, to avoid being surprised into acquiescence: for, having received an intimation of the design, a copy of the edict had been purloined from the press, by means of the universal engine of cor∣ruption, money.</P>
<P>Warmed by the discovery of this surreptitious attempt to cheat them into blind obedience, they bound themselves by an oath, to act in concert; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> register a decree, that had been ob∣tain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a medium, which violated the privi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey had usurped of having a share in the legislation, by rendering their sanction of edicts necessary to give them force; a privilege that belonge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly to the states-general. Still, as the government had often found it convenient to make the parliaments a substitute for a power th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to see in action, these magistrates sometimes availed themselves of this weakness, to remonstrate against oppression; and thus, covering usurpation with a respectable veil, the twelve parliaments were considered by the people as the only barriers to resist the encroachments of despotism. Yet the sagacious chancellor L'Hôpital, not deceived by their accidental use∣fulness, guarded the French against their illegal ambition; for was it not a dangerous courtesy of the people, to allow an aristocracy of lawyers, who bought their places, to be as it were the only representatives of the nation? Still their resist∣ance had frequently been an impediment in the way of tyranny, and now provoked a discussion,
<PB N="41" REF="029916_0053_0FE309A59573E9B0"/>
which led to the most important of all questions —namely, in whose hands ought the sovereignty to rest?—who ought to levy the impost, and make laws?—and the answer was the universal demand of a fair representation, to meet at stated periods, without depending on the caprice of the executive power. Unable to effect their purpose by art or force, the weak ministry, stung by the disappointment, determined at least to wreak their vengeance on two of the boldest of the members. But the united magistrates dis∣puting the authority of the armed force, it was necessary to send to Versailles, to make the king sign an express order; and toward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lock the next morning the sanctuary of justice was pro∣faned, and the two members dragged to prison, in contempt of the visible indignation of the peo∣ple. Soon after, to fill up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asure of pro∣vocations, a deputation sent by the province of Brittany, to remonstrate against the establishment of the <HI>cour pléniere,</HI> were condemn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to silence in the Bastile.</P>
<P>Without money, and afraid to demand it, ex∣cepting in a circumlocutory manner, the court, like mad men, spent themselves in idle exertions of strength: for, whilst the citizens of Paris were burning in effigy the two obnoxious minis∣ters, who thus outraged them in the person of their magistrates, they were delivered up to the fury of the hired slaves of despotism, and trampled under foot by the cavalry; who were called in to quell a riot purposely excited.</P>
<P>Cries of horror and indignation resounded throughout the kingdom; and the nation, with one voice, demanded justice—Alas! justice had never been known in France. Retaliation and
<PB N="42" REF="029916_0054_0FE308DAC91FF3E8"/>
vengeance had been its fatal substitutes. And from this epoch we may date the commencement of those butcheries, which have brought on that devoted country so many dreadful calamities, by teaching the people to avenge themselves with blood.</P>
<P>The hopes of the nation, it is true, were still turned towards the promised convocation of the states-general; which every day became more necessary. But the infatuated ministers, though unable to devise any scheme to extricate them∣selves out of the crowd of difficulties, into which they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dlessly plunged, could not think of con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing a power, which they foresaw, with∣out any great stretch of sagacity, would quickly annihilate their own.</P>
<P>The ferment, mean time, continued, and the blood that had been shed served only to increase it; nay, the citizens of Grenoble prepared with calmness to resist force by force, and the myr∣mid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns of tyranny might have found it a serious contest, if the intelligence of the dismission of the ministers had not produced one of those moments of enthusiasm, which by the most rapid operation of sympathy unites all hearts. Touched by it, the men who lived on the wages of slaughter threw down their arms, and melting into tears in the embraces of the citizens whom they came to murder, remembered that they were country∣men, and groaned under the same oppression: and, their conduct, quickly applauded with that glow of sensibility which excites imitation, served as an example to the whole army, forcing the soldiers to think of their situation; and might have proved a salutary lesson to any court less depraved and insensible than that of Versailles.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Necker recalled. His character. Notables convened a second time. Coalition of the nobility and clergy in defence of their privileges. Provincial assemblies of the People. Political publications in favour of the Tiers-Etat. General reflections on reform,—on the present state of Europe,—and on the Revolution in France.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SUCH were the measures pursued to exas∣perate a people beginning to open their eyes, and now clamorously demanding the restitution of their long estranged rights; when the court having in vain attempted to terrify or deceive them, found it expedient to still the storm by recalling Necker. This man had the confidence of France, which he in some degree merited for the light he had thrown on the state of the re∣venue, and for the system of economy, that he had endeavoured to adopt during his former ad∣ministration: but unfortunately he did not possess talents or political sagacity sufficient to pilot the state in this perilous season. Bred up in a count∣ing-house, he acquired that knowledge of detail, and attention to little advantages, so necessary when a man desires to amass riches with what is termed a fair character: and, having accumu∣lated a very large fortune by unremitting industry;
<PB N="44" REF="029916_0056_0FE308D0CE76BA70"/>
or, to borrow the commercial phrase, <HI>attention to the main chance,</HI> his house became the resort of the men of letters of his day.</P>
<P>The foibles of a rich man are always fostered, sometimes perhaps insensibly, by his numerous dependents and visitants, who find his table amusing or convenient. It is not then surprizing, that, with the abilities of a tolerable financier, he was soon persuaded that he was a great author, and consummate statesman. Besides, when the manners of a nation are very depraved, the men who wish to appear, and even to be, more moral than the multitude, in general become pedanti∣cally virtuous; and, continually contrasting their morals with the thoughtless vices around them, the artificial, narrow character of a sectary is formed; the manners are rendered stiff, and the heart cold. The dupes also of their flimsy virtue, many men are harshly called hypocrites, who are only weak; and popularity often turns the head giddy, that would have soberly fulfilled the common duties of a man in the shade of private life.</P>
<P>Having adopted with a timid hand many of the sagacious plans of his model, the clear headed, unaffected Turgot, Necker was considered by the greater part of the nation as a consummate politi∣cian: neither was it surprising, that the people, snatched from despondency, should have mistaken the extent of his political knowledge, when they had estimated it by that of the greatest statesman, which France, or, perhaps, any other country, ever produced.</P>
<P>Having written on a subject, that naturally attracted the attention of the public, he had the
<PB N="45" REF="029916_0057_0FE309B0642697C8"/>
vanity to believe, that he deserved the exaggerated applause he received, and the reputation of wise, when he was only shrewd. Not content with the fame he acquired by writing on a subject, which his turn of mind and profession enabled him to comprehend, he wished to obtain a higher degree of celebrity, by forming into a large book various metaphysical shreds of arguments, which he had collected from the conversation of men, fond of ingenious subtilities; and the style except∣ing some declamatory passages, was as inflated and confused as the thoughts were far fetched and unconnected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Importance of religious opinions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As it is from this period, that we must date the commencement of those great events, which, outrunning expectation, have almost rendered ob∣servation breathless, it becomes necessary to enter on the task with caution; as it ought not to be more the object of the historian to fill up the sketch, than to trace the hidden springs and secret mechanism, which have put in motion a revolu∣tion, the most important that has ever been re∣corded in the annals of man. This was a crisis that demanded boldness and precision; and no man in France, excepting Necker, had the re∣putation of possessing extensive political talents; because the old system of government scarcely afforded a field, in which the abilities of men could be unfolded, and their judgment matured by experience. Yet, whilst the kingdom was in the greatest fermentation, he seems to have thought of none but those timid half-way mea∣sures, which alway prove disastrous in desperate
<PB N="46" REF="029916_0058_0FE308B7A39F3B70"/>
cases, when the wound requires to be probed to the quick.</P>
<P>The old government was then only a vast ruin; and whilst its p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lars were trembling on their bas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less foundations, the eyes of all France were directed toward their admired minister. In this situation, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his former empiricism he began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> second career, like another Sangra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o. But the people could no longer bear bleeding —for their veins were already so lacerated, it was dif∣ficult to find room to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> incision; and the emollient prescriptions, the practice of former times, were n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficient to stop the progress of a deadly dise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. In this situation, listening to the voice of the nation, because he was at a loss what step to take to maintain his popularity, he determined to hasten the convocation of the states-general: first recalling the exiled magis∣trates, and restoring the parliaments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the ex∣ercise of their functions. His next care was to dissipate all apprehension of a famin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ a fear that had been artfully excited by the court agents, in order to have a pretext to form magazines of provision for an army, which they had pre∣viously resolved to assemble in the vicinity of Paris.</P>
<P>Thus far he seems to have acted with some degree of prudence, at least; but, inattentive to the robust strength which the public opinion had then acquired, he wavered as to the mode of constituting the states-general, whilst the par∣liament passed a decree to prevent their assem∣bling in any other manner than they did in 1614. This obstinate pretention to legislate for the nation was no longer to be tolerated, when they
<PB N="47" REF="029916_0059_0FE308B92A30B860"/>
opposed the wishes of the people: yet, with the common instinct of corporate bodies, they wrap∣ped themselves up in the precedents that proved their winding-sheet, provoking universal con∣tempt; for the Herculean force of the whole em∣pire was now clearing away every obstacle to freedom.</P>
<P>At this critical moment, the minister, enjoying great popularity, had it in his power, could he have governed the court, to have suggested a system, which might ultimately have prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ac∣ceptable to all parties; and thus have prevented that dreadful convulsion, which has shook the kingdom from one extremity to the other. In∣stead of that, he convened a second time the <HI>notables,</HI> to take their opinion on a subject, respect∣ing which the public had al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y decided, not daring himself to sanction its decision. The strongest proof he could give, that his mind was not sufficiently elastic to expand with the opening views of the people; and that he did not possess <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he eye of genius, which, quickly distinguishing what is possible, enables a statesman to act with firm dignity, resting on his own centre.</P>
<P>Carried away by the general impulsion, with the inconsiderate fervour of men, whose hearts always grow hard as they cool, when they have been warmed by some sudden glow of enthusiasm or sympathy, the <HI>notables</HI> showed, by their sub∣sequent conduct, that, though they had been led by eloquence to support some questions of a patrioti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tendency, they had not the principles necessary to impel them to give up local advan∣tages, or personal prerogatives, for the good of the whole community, in which they were only
<PB N="48" REF="029916_0060_0FE308DDD0EA8930"/>
eventually to share. Indeed romantic virtue, or friendship, seldom goes further than professions; because it is merely the effect of that fondness for imitating great, rather than acquiring moderate qualities, common to vain people.</P>
<P>The <HI>notables</HI> had now two essential points to settle; namely, to regulate the election of the deputies, and how they were afterwards to vote. The population and wealth of several provinces, from commercial advantages and other causes, had given a new face to the country since the former election; so much so, that, if the ancient division were adhered to, the representation could not fail to be very unequal. Yet if the natural order of population were followed, the grand question of voting by orders or by voices seemed to be pre∣judged by the great increase of the members of the <HI>tiers-etat.</HI></P>
<P>The nobles and the clergy immediately rallied round the standard of privileges, insisting, that France would be ruined, if their <HI>rights</HI> were touched: and so true were they now to their in∣sulated interest, that all the committees into which the <HI>notables</HI> were divided, excepting that of which <HI>monsieur</HI> was president, determined against allow∣ing the <HI>tiers-etat</HI> that increase of power necessary to enable them to be useful. Whilst, however, these disputes and cabals seemed to promise no speedy determination, the people, weary of pro∣crastination, and disgusted with the obstacles con∣tinually thrown in the way of the meeting of the states-general, by a court that was ever secretly at work, to regain the trifling privileges, which it pretended to sacrifice to the public good, began to assemble, and even to decide the previous
<PB N="49" REF="029916_0061_0FE2A25982D0C3A0"/>
question, by deliberating together in several places. Dauphine set the example; and the three orders uniting sketched a plan for the organization of the whole kingdom, which served as a model for the other provincial states, and furnished grounds for the constituent assembly to work on when forming the constitution. Though the rumour was spread abroad, the court still so stupidly secure as not to see, that the people, who at this period dared to think for themselves, would not now be noosed like beasts, when strength is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to subjection by reason, beheld with wonder the arrival of deputations from different quarters, and heard with astonishment the bold tones of men speaking of their rights, tracing society to its origin, and painting with the most forcible colours the horrid depredations of the old government. For after the minds of men had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fatigued by the stratagems of the court, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeble measures of the minister, and the narrow, selfish views of the parliaments, they examined with avidity the productions of a number of able writers, who were daily pouring pamphlets from the press, to excite the <HI>tiers-etat,</HI> to assert its rights on enlarged principles, and to oppose vigorously the exorbitant claims of the privileged orders, who stood up for ancient usurpations, as if they were the natural rights of a particular <HI>genus</HI> of man. Those of the Abbé Sieyes and the marquis de Condorcet were the most philoso∣phical; whilst the unctuous eloquence of Mira∣beau softened these dry researches, and fed the flame of patriotism.</P>
<P>In this posture of affairs, Necker, perceiving that the people were grown resolute, prevailed
<PB N="50" REF="029916_0062_0FE3097755E61828"/>
on the council to decree, that the number of the deputies of the <HI>tiers-etat</HI> should be equal to that of the two other orders taken together: but whether they were to vote by chambers, or in the same body, was still left undetermined.</P>
<P>The people whose patience had been worn out by injuries and insults, now only thought of pre∣paring instructions for their representatives.— But, instead of looking for gradual improvement, letting one reform calmly produce another, they seemed determined to strike at the root of all their misery at once: the united mischiefs of a monarchy unrestrained, a priesthood unneces∣sarily numerous, and an overgrown nobility: and these hasty measures, become a subject worthy of philosophical investigation, naturally fall into two distinct subjects of inquiry.</P>
<P N="1">1st. If from the progress of reason, we be au∣thorized to infer, that all governments will be meliorated, and the happiness of man placed on the solid basis, gradually prepared by the im∣provement of political science; if the degrading distinctions of rank born in barbarism, and nou∣rished by chivalry, be really becoming in the esti∣mation of all sensible people so contemptible, that a modest man, in the course of fifty years would probably blush at being thus distinguished: if the complexion of manners in Europe be completely changed from what it was half a century ago, and the liberty of its citizens tolerably secured: if every day extending freedom be more firmly established in consequence of the general dissemi∣nation of truth and knowledge: it then seems injudicious for statesmen to force the adoption of any opinion, by aim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng at the speedy destruc∣tion
<PB N="51" REF="029916_0063_0FE309B1E9A4FED8"/>
of obstinate prejudices; because these pre∣mature reforms, instead of promoting, destroy the comfort of those unfortunate beings, who are under their dominion, affording at the same time to despotism the strongest arguments to urge in opposition to the theory of reason. Besides, the objects intended to be forwarded are pro∣bably retarded, whilst the tumult of internal com∣motion and civil discord leads to the most dread∣ful consequences—the immolating of human vic∣tims.</P>
<P>But, 2dly, it is necessary to observe, that, if the degeneracy of the higher orders of society be such, that no remedy less fraught with horror can effect a radical cure; and if enjoying the fruits of usurpation, they domineer over the wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and check by all the means in their power every humane effort, to draw man out of the state of degradation, into which the inequality of fortune has sunk him; the people are justified in having recourse to coercion, to repel coercion. And, further, if it can be ascertained, that the silent sufferings of the citizens of the world under the iron feet of oppression are greater, though less obvious, than the calamities produced by such violent convulsions as have happened in France; which, like hurricanes whirling over the face of nature, strip off all its blooming graces; it may be politically just, to pursue such measures as were taken by that regenerating country, and at once root out those deleterious plants, which poison the better half of human happiness. For civilization hitherto, by producing the inequality of conditions, which makes wealth more desi∣rable than either talents or virtue, has so weak∣ened
<PB N="52" REF="029916_0064_0FE308C0DA9E54C0"/>
all the organs of the body-politic, and rendered man such a beast of prey, that the strong have always devoured the weak till the very signification of justice has been lost sight of, and charity, the most specious system of slavery, substituted in it's place. The rich have for ages tyrannized over the poor, teaching them how to act when possessed of power, and now must feel the consequence. People are rendered ferocious by misery; and misanthropy is ever the offspring of discontent. Let not then the hap∣piness of one half of mankind be built on the misery of the other, and humanity will take place of charity, and all the ostentatious virtues of an universal aristocracy. How, in fact, can we ex∣pect to see men live together like brothers, when we only see master and servant in society? For till men learn mutually to assist without govern∣ing each other, little can be done by political associations towards perfecting the condition of mankind.</P>
<P>Europe will probably be, for some years to come, in a state of anarchy; till a change of sen∣timents, gradually undermining the strong-holds of custom, alters the manners, without rousing the little passions of men, a pack of yelping curs pampered by vanity and pride. It is in reality these minor passions, which during the summer of idleness mantle on the heart, and taint the atmosphere, because the understanding is still.</P>
<P>Several acts of ferocious folly have justly brought much obloquy on the grand revolution, which has taken place in France; yet, I feel con∣fident of being able to prove, that the people are essentially good, and that knowledge is ra∣pidly
<PB N="53" REF="029916_0065_0FE309B36D6BF1E8"/>
advancing to that degree of perfectibility, when the proud distinctions of sophisticating fools will be eclipsed by the mild rays of philo∣sophy, and man be considered as man—acting with the dignity of an intelligent being.</P>
<P>From implicitly obeying their sovereigns, the French became suddenly all sovereigns; yet, be∣cause it is natural for men to run out of one ex∣treme into another, we should guard against in∣ferring, that the spirit of the moment will not evaporate, and leave the disturbed water more clear for the fermentation. Men without prin∣ciple rise like foam during a storm sparkling on the top of the billow, in which it is soon absorbed when the commotions die away. Anarchy is a fearful state, and all men of sense and benevolence have been anxiously attentive, to observe what use Frenchmen would make of their liberty, when the confusion incident to the acquisition should subside: yet, whilst the heart sickens over a detail of crimes and follies, and the understand∣ing is appalled by the labour of unravelling a black tissue of plots, which exhibits the human character in the most revolting point of view; it is perhaps, difficult to bring ourselves to be∣lieve, that out of this chaotic mass a fairer go∣vernment is rising than has ever shed the sweets of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cial life on the world.—But things must have time to find their level.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE we enter on the grand business produced by the meeting of the states-general, it is necessary to take a retrospective glance over the oppressions of which Frenchmen so loudly complained; and, whilst we trace their justness, the question will only be, why they did not sooner raise their shoulders to heave off the
<PB N="56" REF="029916_0067_0FE309798F1A97A8"/>
mighty load. To ascertain this truth, we need not enter into deep researches, though it may be difficult to collect all the parts of the feudal chain, which linked the despotism of sixty thousand nobles, who not only exercised all the tyranny that the system authorised, but countenanced the still more extensive depredations of their nume∣rous dependents. What, indeed, could equal the slavery of the poor husbandman; not only pillaged by the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he and game-laws, but even obliged to let whole flocks of pigeons devour his grain, without daring to destroy them, be∣cause those pigeons belonged to the chateau; and afterwards forced to carry the scanty crop to be tolled at the mill of <HI>monseigneur,</HI> which, to follow a Frenchman's staff of life through all it's stages of taxation, must then be baked at the privileged oven?</P>
<P>It would be captious, perhaps, to dwell on some of the abominable tenures of personal servi∣tude, which, though grown obsolete, were not abrogated; especially as more specious, if not less grinding, not less debasing exactions were in force, to deprave every moral feeling of the two divisions of society; the governing, and governed.</P>
<P>When chased from the country, of which the chief charm is independence, by such worrying restraints, a man wished to pursue any occupation in a town, he must previously purchase a patent of some privileged person, to whom this tax had been sold by a farmer-general, or the parasite of a minister.</P>
<P>All lived by plunder; and its universality gave it a sanction, that took off the odium, though
<PB N="57" REF="029916_0068_0FE309BDA287B4D8"/>
nothing could varnish the inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tice. Yet, such was the insensibility of the great, the pleasures these extortions procured were not less grateful to the senses, because paid by the sweat of in∣dustry.—No, like Vespasian's obnoxious tax, money was money; and who cared on what it was levied? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the rich necessarily became robbers, and the poor thieves. Talking of honour, honesty was overlooked; and, custom giving a soft name to different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cities, few thought it a duty to investigate disregarded principles; or to relinquish their sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the plunder, to satisfy a romantic singularity of opinion, which excited ridicule rather than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration.</P>
<P>The military, a pest in every country, were here also noble, and leagued with a hundred thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vileged p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sons, of different descrip∣tions, to support their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rogative of receiving a revenue, which was a dead weight on agriculture; whilst they were not obliged, in a direct way, to advance any thing towards defraying the public expenditure.</P>
<P>The gabelle, the corvée, the obligation to supply horses to transport the troops from one part of the kingdom to another, even when most necessary at the farm; clogs on husbandry, equally unjust and vexatious; were riveted only on the ankles of labour. Activity then being continually damped by such various restrictions, instead of being braced by encouragement, an invincible impediment was thrown in the way of agricultural improvements; for each individual, insulated by oppression, lived, strictly speaking, from hand to mouth; not caring to store up comforts, at the expence of extraordinary toil, when the en∣joyment
<PB N="58" REF="029916_0069_0FE3098166A40378"/>
depended on so many casualties. Yet, never beginning to be sensible of the effect, the people were not, probably, aware of the cause; and only exclaimed against new impositions, be∣cause they did not think sufficiently deep to detect the old.</P>
<P>Beside which, France maintained two hundred thousand priests, united in the same spirit of licentiousness; who indulged themselves in all the depraved pleasures of cloaked immorality, at the same time they embruted the people by sancti∣fying the most diabolical prejudices; to whose empire every consideration of justice and political improvement was sacrificed.</P>
<P>Added to evils of this magnitude, there were the canker-worms that lurked behind monastic walls. For sixty thousand persons, who by re∣nouncing the world cut the thread of nature, served as a prop to the priesthood that enjoyed more than a fourth of the produce of all France; independent of the estates it possessed, which were immense. And this body of men, the leeches of the kingdom, the idols of the ignorant, and the palladium of tyranny, contributed not a farthing to the support of the hydra, whom they were anxious to protect, as a guard to themselves. Ostentatiously boasting of their charity, whilst revelling on the spoil of fraud, by a sacrilege the most nesarious, their whole lives were a mockery of the doctrines, which they taught, and pre∣tended to reverence. Beside these, and other vexations, almost innumerable, one entangled in another; each petty monopoly contributed to strengthen the massy fabric of despotism, which reared it's head in defiance of time and reason.
<PB N="59" REF="029916_0070_0FE308C3486F5CE0"/>
Much, indeed, depended on the caprice of the individuals of the privileged orders, whom the court could actuate at will, giving them occasion∣ally a sop to silence any peevish growl.</P>
<P>There were also the farmers-general, with their army of fifty thousand collectors, who, by their manner of levying and amassing the revenue, gave an additional gripe to an oppression, the most wringing that could be invented, because it's very principles led to the exercise of the vilest pe∣culation; and impunity was secured by a coalition of robbers, that multitude of men in office, whose families and flatterers all lived, and fattened on the spoil of their continual war with justice. And, whilst the interest of the people was continually sa∣crificed by the parliaments, the inferior courts of law were still more venal, because composed of those litigious practitioners, who thicken like spawn on putrid bodies, when a state is become corrupt.</P>
<P>Such were the grievance!—Such the imposi¦tions, 'that, taken together, levied a tax on the kingdom,' says Rabaud, 'which the imagination is afraid to calculate.' This body of men we may consider as constituting France, till the great bulk of the people, who, were slaves and dwarfs, bursting their s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ackles and rising in stature, sud∣denly appeared with the dignity and pretensions of human beings: Yes; with the same feelings; or perhaps stronger, because more natural; and claiming equal rights with those nobles, who, like the giants of old, were only great by the courtesy of imagination. Who is so callous to the interest of humanity as to say it was not a noble regeneration? Who is so benumbed by
<PB N="60" REF="029916_0071_0FE308E5D9FBBBC0"/>
selfish fears, as not to feel a glow of warmth, at seeing the inhabitants of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st empire exalted from the lowest state of beastly degradation to a summit, where, contemplating the dawn of free∣dom, they may breathe the invigorating air of independence; which will give them a new con∣stitution of mind? Who is so much under the influence of prejudice, as to insist, that French∣men are a distinct race, formed by nature, or by habit, to be slaves; and incapable of ever attain∣ing those noble sentiments, which characterize a free people? When the dawn of them appeared conspicuously at the elections for the states-gene∣ral, which were the preparatory struggles to make a change of opinion produce an essential alteration in government.</P>
<P>Six millions of men were now in motion to choose the deputies, and prepare their instruc∣tions; and in these assemblies the commons commenced their political career; discussing, on new ground, subjects that quickly became the only interesting topics throughout the king∣dom.</P>
<P>In some few places, the three orders meeting together seemed to decide the important question respecting the equality of the representatives; but, in general, the first two chambered themselves to guard tenaciously their trembling prerogatives; and the third, with a cautious jealousy, to de∣mand the redress of grievances, which they could scarcely expect the others to denominate by so harsh a name.</P>
<P>Great decorum reigned in the chamber of the nobility, though split into various ranks; the lower of which had ill brooked, for a long time,
<PB N="61" REF="029916_0072_0FE309BF26CE9200"/>
the overbearing insolence of those princes and peers, who haughtily contested every step of honour. Still all agreed, to resign their pecuni∣ary privileges, and joined in vague terms, with the public voice, to demand a constitution.</P>
<P>The same divisions produced more visible effects amongst the clergy: for considerable tu∣mults were the consequence of the struggle of the parish priests, the commons of this order, to have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir due weight in the scale; and their success seemed a sure prognostic of the turn things were going to take in the nation. In fact, every diocess was become the centre of a petty des∣potism, more galling than the great, because at each man's elbow; and the parish-priests, who were not in the high road to preferment, being most oppressed, led the van in the new contest for equality; whilst disrespect for the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tre paved the way to a contempt for the crown.</P>
<P>Indivisible as had hitherto been the clerical body, the indecent pride of the dignitaries of the church, at this juncture, produced the schism, which induced the majority of the clergy to side with the people; whilst only a small minority of the nobility deserted the common cause of the party. The parish-priests, in fact, appeared, from the time of their election, a corps in re∣serve for the third-estate; where they sought for the consequence they were denied in their own chamber, finding themselves more nearly allied by interest, as well as inclination, to this order than to the rich pastors, who, separating the sheep from the goats, bade them stand aloof, as possessing less riches—the holiness of that body, as of all others. The electing of so many of the
<PB N="62" REF="029916_0073_0FE309831B007DA8"/>
inferior clergy, in spite of the menaces and in∣trigues of their numerous superiors, was a strik∣ing proof, that the power of the church was in the wane; and that the people were beginning to feel their own strength. The disturbances at this time seemed the rumbling of the approach∣ing tempest; and orators, formed in these pro∣vincial assemblies, to figure afterwards in national, were encouraged by applause to persevere.</P>
<P>Having the same mark in view, an uniformity of sentiment breathed throughout the instructions of the third-estate; principally levelled at the privileges of the two other orders: for on these abuses the most popular publications had hinged, rivetting conviction in the minds of the suffering people. A celebrated pamphlet, written by the abbé Sieyes, went through sixty editions; and the duke of Orleans, piqued at the royal family, took great pains to spread abroad opinions, which were far from being congenial with his own; thus, with purblind ambition, labouring to overturn a court, the ruins of which have rebounded on his own head.</P>
<P>But the temper of the nation, sore with suffer∣ing, and warmed by these discussions, so ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a-head of their judgment, as to lead the electors, with hasty zeal, to instruct their representatives, to demand the immediate suppression of a host of abuses, without guarding against the consequen∣ces.—Such, unfortunately, is always the con∣duct pursued by exasperated passions; for, du∣ring the rage to correct abuses, one is, too fre∣quently, only exchanged for another. So diffi∣cult is it to impress the salutary lessons of expe∣rience on irritated minds!—And so apt are men,
<PB N="63" REF="029916_0074_0FE309C0AC67F738"/>
in the moment of action, to fly from one ex∣treme to the other, without considering, that the strongest conviction of reason cannot quickly change a habit of body; much less the manners that have been gradually produced by certain modes of thinking and acting.</P>
<P>With one voice, however, the whole nation called for a constitution, to establish equal rights, as the foundation of freedom; and to guard against the depredations of favourites, whether they attacked person or property. So that the liberty of the press, and the abolition of <HI>lettres de cachet,</HI> were, in general, the articles that followed the positive injunction of confining the right of taxation to the representative body of the nation. The institution of juries was recommended, and the deputies were requested to take into con∣sideration, whether the number of capital punish∣ments could not be lessened, or totally abolish∣ed; remarks were made on the evil tendency of lotteries, and on the vexatious impediments thrown in the way of trade, by barriers and mono∣polies. In short, against the tyranny and injustice of the court, the nobility, and the clergy, all remonstrated; unmasking one species of oppres∣sion, and dil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting on another; yet, among these numerous animadversions, prayers and praises alone were addressed to the king; and nothing like a glance at republicanism rendered their sin∣cerity doubtful.</P>
<P>To divert the gathering storm from breaking over their heads, the cabal determined to rest all their hopes on the aid of the foreign troops; which they were collecting from different parts of the kingdom, not ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to trust to the French sol∣diery,
<PB N="64" REF="029916_0075_0FE30984A1E327D8"/>
who were assuming the character of citi∣zens. Mean while, with the usual chicanery of courtiers, they continued to amuse the deputies, till they could crush them at once; and effectually blast the hopes of the people. The human heart is naturally good, though so often the dupe of passion.—For though it's feelings be sophisticated, or stisted; though the head contrives the blackest machinations; even in the silence of solitude, who will whisper to himself that he is a villain? Will he not rather try, like Milton's devil, to find out a damned plea of necessity, to cover his guilt?— paying homage, in spite of himself, to the eternal justice he violates under the pretext of self pre∣servation. But, it is not alone the virtues of man, those changing hues, of which the colour is un∣decided, that proclaim his native dignity. No; his vices have the same stamp of the divinity; and it is necessary to pervert the understanding, be∣fore the heart can be led astray. Men, likewise, indolently adopt the habits of thinking of their day, without weighing them. Thus these very courtiers, who could coolly contemplate the massacre, which must be the consequence of assembling the foreign troops, because it was a continuance of the established course of things, have since started, probably with real horror, from the contemplation of the butcheries, which their very tenacity produced. Such is the deceit∣fulness of the human heart, and so necessary is it to render the head clear to make the principles of action pure.</P>
<P>The deputies, however, who were mostly collected from remote parts of the country, had become in their villages the hale sons of indepen∣dence.
<PB N="65" REF="029916_0076_0FE309C9C1797100"/>
And, though the French mania, of adoring their monarch, extended to every part of the kingdom, it only gave hilarity to the cheering glass at the homely tables of which they were masters; or activity to the dance, that was a real burst of animal spirits. Very different from the lascivious provocations to vice, exhibited at the opera, which, by destroying the social affec∣tions that attach men to each other, stifle all public spirit; for what is patriotism but the ex∣pansion of domestic sympathy, rendered perma∣nent by principle? Besides, the writings that had awakened the spirit of these men had a little inebriated their brain. Such is, for the most part, the baneful effect of eloquence, that, persuading instead of convincing, the glory of the enthusiasm it inspires is sullied by that false magnanimity, which vanity and ignorance continually mistake for real elevation of soul; though, like the scorch∣ing rays of the sun after rain, it dries into steri∣lity the heart, whose emotions are too quickly exhaled.</P>
<P>The courtiers, despising their rusticity, and still considering the people as cyphers, continued to discharge the usual routine of office, by adjusting the ceremonials of reception; all which tended to insult the third-estate, and show, that the de∣puties of the privileged orders were to be still treated as if they were a distinct class of beings. The insolence of such proceedings could not fail to provoke the honest indignation, and pique the vanity of those, who had been discussing on a broad scale the rights of man: whilst a little dis∣concerted by the ceremony that constrained them, they were obliged, every moment, to recollect,
<PB N="66" REF="029916_0077_0FE3098626245FB0"/>
that they were the equals of these courtiers; and blushed even to own to themselves, that they could for an instant have been awed by such childish pomp. Nor were they more astonished at the pageantry of Versailles, than disgusted with the haughtiness of a court, whose magni∣ficence was a proof how much they had im∣poverished the people, who now demanded eman∣cipation. Full, therefore, of the new notions of independence, which made them spurn at every idea of a distinction of men, they took advantage of the majority accorded them by council, and began to rally their forces. Perceiving also, as they acted decidedly, that they possessed the con∣fidence of the people, who, forgetting <HI>vive le roi,</HI> exclaimed only vive le tiers etat!— they every day became more firm.</P>
<P>The courtiers immediately fixed on a house of rendezvous, where they were regularly to con∣cert the best measures to crush the rising power of the commons; and these, not without a por∣tion of the mistrust, which characterizes the nation, assembled in different places, till a mutual interest united them in that chosen by the deputies from Brittany. The disrespect, likewise, which the orders relative to their dress anounced, pre∣pared them for the contempt they were destined to receive, when separated like the Indian casts, amongst whom a man fears to be polluted by the touch of an inferior: for true to the inveterate prejudice in favour of precedents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'The code of étiquette', says Mirabeau, <Q>has been hitherto the sacred fire of the court and privileged orders.</Q></NOTE>, the nobility were gaudily caparisoned for the show, whilst
<PB N="67" REF="029916_0078_0FE308C4CCA20DF8"/>
the commons were stupidly commanded to wear the black mantle, that distinguishes the lawyers. But, the tide of opinion once turned, every thing contributes to accelerate it's course.</P>
<P>Before the meeting of the states-general, the question that was first to agitate the various in∣terests, whether they were to vote by orders or poll, had been so thoroughly discussed, that it made, in many of the instructions, one of the foremost articles. For it was evident to the nation, were the different orders allowed to assemble in their separate chambers, each invested with the old privilege of putting a negative on the de∣cisions of the other two, that they should be gul∣led with promises of reform, whilst the coffers of the court were replenished with a show of legality. It was, in fact, prudent in the court party to maintain this ground, because it appear∣ed to be the only way to render abortive all the plans of reformation that struck at their authority. This then was the prefatory business, by which they were to measure their strength; and, would to God! the vigour manifested on this occasion had always been displayed by the representatives of those misled people.</P>
<P>We have seen the plots of this weak, head∣strong cabinet every where defeated, and traced their bloody footsteps; but we shall find them still true to their scent, having recourse again to violence, when fraud was of no avail.</P>
<P>To furnish a pretext to introduce adroitly a considerable military force, at the time of the assembling of the states-general, two or three riots had been exhibited at Paris, in which many of the thoughtless populace were killed. One in
<PB N="68" REF="029916_0079_0FE3098F39951AA8"/>
particular, though still involved in the shades of mystery, occasioned great confusion and con∣siderable slaughter, just at the eve of their meet∣ing.</P>
<P>A respectable manufacturer in the suburbs of Paris, with the fairest character, employed a number of poor, whom he paid liberally; yet against this man some idle stories were industri∣ously circulated, well contrived to mislead and exasperate the people, because they touched their vanity, and their most pressing want, the want of bread. The scarcity, real or factitious, of this article, has always been taken advantage of by those who wished to excite tumults in Paris; and at this juncture the duped Parisians rose, at the instigation of the court agents, to destroy themselves. The riot was permitted to get a∣head before any serious attempts to quell it were taken, which rendered the interference of a little army, the point aimed at, necessary; and esta∣blished an opinion, that the turbulent mob re∣quired to be awed by the presence of troops, whilst the states-general deliberated.</P>
<P>During this effervescence, or, at least, when it was subsiding, the states-general was opened, on the 5th of May, 1789, by a speech from the throne, to which courtiers, in the usual phrase∣ology, would naturally tack the epithet—<HI>gracious.</HI> The king commenced with a heartless declaration of his satisfaction at seeing himself surrounded by the representatives of the people; and then enumerating the heavy debts of the nation, a great part of which had been accumulated during his reign, he added one of those idle falsehoods, which swelled his declamation without throwing
<PB N="69" REF="029916_0080_0FE309CB4AD66230"/>
dust into any one's eyes, <HI>that it was in an honour∣able cause;</HI> when it was notorious, that the cause ought to have been reckoned most dishonourable, if power had not hitherto been the true philoso∣pher's stone, that transmuted the basest actions into sterling honour. He afterwards alluded to the spirit of innovation, that had taken possession of the minds of the people, and the general dis∣content that agitated the nation: but, in the true cant of courts, dictating whilst complimenting, he assured them, that he depended on their wisdom and moderation; concluding with the words of course, <HI>the humhle servant of kings,</HI> a declaration of his attachment to the public wel∣fare.</P>
<P>The disregarded speech of the keeper of the seals was, like the reply usually made to the king's, in the house of commons in England, merely an echo of his majesty's, recommending moderation in the measures adopted to reform the abuses of government, with the necessary quantum of panegyric on the goodness of the king.</P>
<P>Attention and applause, however, awaited Necker, though followed by weariness and dis∣gust. He spoke for three hours, introducing, with his customary pomp of words, a number of trivial observations; trying thus to escape, in a mist of rhetorical flourishes, from the subject he feared to bring forward, because he was equally apprehensive of offending the court, and desirous of maintaining his reputation with the people. Not a word was uttered relative to the sole right of the states-general to levy taxes, the first de∣mand of the nation. And men who for some
<PB N="70" REF="029916_0081_0FE308AC82814028"/>
time had been talking of nothing but liberty and reform, were astonished, and dissatisfied, that he avoided all mention of a new constitution. Lean∣ing to the side of the privileged orders, he assert∣ed, that the mode of deliberating and voting in separate assemblies was the pillar of the nation —yet, cautiously adding a salvo, to have a pre∣text to use another language should it be neces∣sary, he remarked, that <HI>sometimes</HI> it was better to poll. This ill-timed management naturally dis∣pleased both parties, as is always the case, when men of weak, compound characters, who have not the courage to act right, want effrontery to brave the censure, that would follow an open avowal of their undecided opinions; or ra∣ther, their determination to keep well with the strongest. Dwelling on the arrangement of the finances, he assured them, that a public bank∣ruptcy might easily be avoided; and that even the <HI>deficit,</HI> which had been exaggerated by France, and Europe, was only fifty-six millions; and would appear of less consequence, when they recollected, that since <HI>his</HI> administration, the re∣venue was augmented twenty-five millions. It is true, that, on entering into details, the greater part of this sum was found to be still in perspec∣tive; and at the same time was to be raised by taxes, which all good citizens hoped would soon disappear. In short, the French, after applaud∣ing with rapture this brilliant bird's-eye view, observed, with the shrug of <HI>sang freid,</HI>
<Q>that these hypothetical resources were merely faith and hope, on condition that they should be charitable.</Q>
With respect to the abolishing of privileges, that warred with humanity, he made
<PB N="71" REF="029916_0082_0FE309CCD24523A8"/>
use of some of the same species of jesuitical argu∣ments, which are employed by the opposers of the abolition of the infamous traffic for slaves; that, as these privileges were a kind of property, it was necessary to find out a compensation, an indemnity, before they could be done away— with justice.</P>
<P>Thus has the spirit of justice—it is difficult to keep down indignation when attacking such sophisms—been always outraged by the mock respect of selfishness; for, without parrying off tergiversation, it is sufficient to prove, that certain laws are not just, because no government had a right to make them; and, though they may have received what is termed a legal sanction during the times of ignorance, "the duty lies in the breach and not in the observance." Besides, these pitiful arguments are an insult to the com∣mon sense, and to the distress of a people.— Where, indeed, could the French, or English, find a fund to indemnify the privileged orders or the planters? The abuses then, must continue to the end of time—out of sheer respect to the sacredness of public faith!</P>
<P>Thus spoke the king and Necker; but these addresses, instead of conciliating, only rendered both parties more obstinate; so that the smother∣ing dispute respect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the manner of voting broke out immediately, when they met to constitute themselves a legal assembly. For the next day, even the deputies of the third-estate repaired to the common hall, and agreed, that the three orders should proceed to verify their powers to∣gether; clearly perceiving, that, were the orders once allowed to do business separately, an union
<PB N="72" REF="029916_0083_0FE30990C7710F50"/>
would be impracticable, and all their efforts to obtain a constitution null, should they attempt to make equality of rights the basis. The nobility and clergy not joining the commons, they resolv∣ed to renew their meeting the following morn∣ing; only as an aggregate of individuals, who had no power to act, not having yet a political character. This very contest seemed to call upon them to support their claim to equality, because it emphatically warned them, that all their ope∣rations would be rendered perfectly nugatory, should they permit the orders to be a check on each other. The most sensible men of the com∣mons being of opinion, that all expectations of a permanent reform were chimerical, unless the whole representation was formed into an indivi∣sible assembly, encouraged the more undecided to persevere; though the nobles signified to them, on the 13th, that they had ascertained the legality of their election.</P>
<P>The clergy, however, divided in their interest, proceeded with more caution; and the most dis∣cerning of them, perceiving that their order was becoming obnoxious to the people, who now deified the third estate, proposed a committee of conciliation, with a view, as they pretended, to promote a good understanding between all parties. The king also, in his turn, when the nobles re∣jected the mediation of the clergy, offered a plan of accommodation; a mighty nothing, that the court brought forth.—But this tub, thrown out to the whale, did not divert the attention of either party from the main object; though the nobles, many of whom were in the secret of the approach of the army, should things be carried
<PB N="73" REF="029916_0084_0FE309CE55E8A480"/>
to extremes, pretended to acquiesce; yet guard∣ing carefully at the same time all their ancient pretensions: and this insincerity drew on them the universal odium they merited, mixed with the contempt which ineffectual struggles always produce. Conciliatory measures, in fact, were only a solemn farce at this time; though the clergy, rather insidiously, to ingratiate them∣selves with the people, lamenting the high price of bread, requested, that deputies from the three orders should meet to deliberate how this griev∣ance might be lessened. The deputies of the commons, with becoming dignity, tempered with prudence, adhered to their point; and dexter∣ously parrying off the artful stroke levelled at their popularity, they represented to the clergy, that this was another powerful motive, to make them entreat all parties to rally round the same point, to remedy evils which excited equal sym∣pathy in their bosoms.</P>
<P>The inactivity occasioned by these disputes could not fail to inflame the public mind, espe∣cially as fresh publications were daily affording it fuel. For the liberty of the press was now tacitly established, and the freest sentiments utter∣ed, with the heat of superficial knowledge, in defiance of court manifestoes. Still, as a proof that the court merely endured, for a season, what they could not prevent, the journal of the pro∣ceedings of the states-general was stopped, by an express order; to evade which it was continued in the form of letters from Mirabeau to his con∣stituents.</P>
<P>This prohibition was probably dictated by a desire of keeping the provinces quiet in the stupor
<PB N="74" REF="029916_0085_0FE308C7225A9610"/>
of ignorance, in which they had so long doz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; but it was injudicious to awaken attention by rigorous steps, that, quickly abandoned, had the very contrary effect, exciting, instead of intimi∣dating, the spirit of opposition. In reality, the eyes of all France were at present directed to∣wards the commons. The hopes of the nation rested on their magnanimity; and the future happiness of millions depended upon their perse∣verance. It was in this state of things, that they afforded a convincing proof to the whole world, and to posterity, that vigour and precision <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one are requisite in the representatives of a peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to give dignity to their proceedings, and to secure them against the machinations of all the combin∣ed powers of despotism.</P>
<P>Almost five weeks having elapsed, and the patience of the nation being quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hausted by the delay, the commons resolved to present an address to the king, written by Mirabeau, ex∣planatory of their motives, and then to proceed to business. But, previously, they sent a deputa∣tion to the other orders, for the last time, to invite them once more to repair to the common-hall, that their powers might be verified toge∣ther; adding, that in default of their appearance, they should constiture themselves, and act ac∣cordingly. This determination was a deadly blow to the power of the two other chambers, and struck directly at the root of all distinc∣tion.</P>
<P>The nobles, whose inveterate pride and igno∣rance had prevented them from joining the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd-estate at the first assembling of the deputies, now saw with dismay, that their power and influence,
<PB N="75" REF="029916_0086_0FE309D4C8DC0930"/>
like the musty rolls of their pedigree, were mouldering into common dust. The clergy, however, more adroit, or rather a few of the the parochial priests, by degrees, attended the summons, and repaired to the hall. There can be little doubt, but that the commons, at the first meeting, and for a long time after, would gladly have coalesced with the nobles; by which means the latter would have retained many of their privileges, and preserved a weight in the nation, necessary to hinder that preponderance, on the side of the people, which it was easy to foresee would be productive of many excesses. This conclusion continual experience warranted; because it generally happens, that men, who are not directed by practical knowledge, in whatever business they engage, run precipitately from one extreme to the other. And certainly, from the state of servility in which the French nation was sunk, retaliation was to be expected; or, at least, dreaded, from unbridled liberty. Like boys dis∣missed from school, they might wish to ascertain their freedom by acts of mischief; and by show∣ing a total disregard of the arbitrary commands, that kept down their spirits without exercising their understandings. However, the stupid ar∣rogance of the nobles stript them, before the time reason would have determined, of those idle distinctions of opinion, the symbols of bar∣barism, which were not completely worn out of esteem.</P>
<P>The minister, still afraid to act independent of the court, blamed this spirited conduct of the commons, as an act of temerity, which t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e king ought not to sanction. Yet they, firm and reso∣lute,
<PB N="76" REF="029916_0087_0FE308AEE6193450"/>
though fearing that the court, like a dying savage, mortally wounded by his enemy, might, during the agonies of death, aim a desperate stroke at them, took the most prudent precau∣tions, to avoid exasperating the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing foe. But these mild resolutions having been mistaken by the infatuated nobles, who confounded the true fortitude of moderation with cowardice, the die was cast, and the deputies declared themselves a NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.</P>
<P>Enthusiasm fired every heart, and extended itself like thought from one end of the kingdom to the other. The very novelty of this measure was sufficient to animate a people less volatile than the French; and, perhaps, it is impossible to form a just conception of the transports which this decision excited in every corner of the empire. Europe also heard with astonishment what resounding through France excited the most lively emotions; and posterity must read with wonder the recital of the follies and atro∣cities committed by the court and nobles at that important crisis.</P>
<P>The Social Contract of Rousseau, and his ad∣mirable work on the origin of the inequalities amongst mankind, had been in the hands of all France, and admired by many, who could not enter into the depth of the reasoning. In short, they were learned by heart, by those whose heads could not comprehend the chain of argument, though they were sufficiently clear to seize the prominent ideas, and act up to their conviction. Perhaps, the great advantage of eloquence is, that, impressing the results of thinking on minds alive only to emotion, it gives wings to the slow
<PB N="77" REF="029916_0088_0FE309D7758589C0"/>
foot of reason, and fire to the cold labours of investigation: yet it is observable, that, in pro∣portion as the understanding is cultivated, the mind grows attached to the exercise of investiga∣tion, and the combination of abstract ideas. The nobles of France had also read these writings for amusement; but they left not on their minds traces of conviction sufficiently strong to over∣come those prejudices self-interest rendered so dear, that they easily persuaded themselves of their reasonableness. The nobility and clergy, with all their dependents under the influence of the same sentiments, formed a considerable pro∣portion of the nation, on the rest of which they looked down with contempt, considering them as merely the grass of the land, necessary to clothe nature; yet only fit to be trodden under foot. But these despised people were beginning to feel their real consequence, and repeated with emphasis the happy comparison of the Abbé Siéyes,
<Q>that the nobility are like vegetable tu∣mours, which cannot exist without the sap of the plants they exhaust.</Q>
Nevertheless, in treating with the nobles, the angles of pride, which time alone could have smoothed silently away, were, perhaps, too rudely knocked off, for the folly of distinctions was rapidly wearing itself out, and would probably have melted gradually before the rational opinions that were con∣tinually gaining ground, fructifying the soil as they dissolved; instead of which it was drifted by a hurricane, to spread destruction around as it fell.</P>
<P>Many of the officers, who had served in Ame∣rica during the late war, had beheld the inha∣bitants
<PB N="78" REF="029916_0089_0FE309924BE77858"/>
of a whole empire living in a state of per∣fect equality; and returned, charmed with their simplicity and integrity, the concomitants of a just government, erected on the solid foundation of equal liberty, to scan the rectitude or policy of a different system. Convince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their inutility as nobles, these, when fired with the love of free∣dom, seconded the views of the commons with heart and voice. But the sycophants of the court, and the greater part of the nobility, who were grossly ignorant of every thing that was not com∣prised in the art of living in a continual round of pleasure, insensible of the precipice on which they were standing, would not, at first, recede a single step to save themselves; and this obstinacy was the chief cause that led to the entire new organization of the constitution, framed by the national assembly. The French in reality were arrived, through the vices of their government, at that degree of false refinement, which makes every man, in his own eyes, the centre of the world; and when this gross selfishness, this com∣plete depravity, prevails in a nation, an absolute change must take place; because the members of it have lost the cement of humanity, which kept them together. All other vices are, properly speaking, superfluous strength, powers running to waste; but this morbid spot shows, that there is death in the heart. Whatever, indeed, may be the wisdom or folly of a mixed government of king, lords, and commons, is of no consequence in the present history; because it appears suf∣ficiently ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, that the aristocracy of France destroyed itself, through the ignorant arrogance of it's members; who, bewildered in a thick fog
<PB N="79" REF="029916_0090_0FE309DB552DEBB8"/>
of prejudices, could discern neither the true dig∣nity of man, nor the spirit of the times.</P>
<P>It also deserves to be noted, that the regenera∣tion of the French government, at this crisis, de∣pended on the fortitude of the national assembly at the outset of the contest; for, if the court party had prevailed, the commons would have rested in their usual state of insignificancy, and their whole proceedings proved only a solemn farce. They would have wrapped themselves up in their black mantles, like the herd of under∣takers' men at a funeral, merely to follow with servile steps the idle cavalcade to it's resting place; and the people would only have seen their ancient tyranny revive, tricked out in new habiliments.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE third-estate, having constituted them∣selves a national assembly, now proceeded to business, with calm prudence, taking into con∣sideration the urgent necessities of the state. Closely also attending to their instructions, they first pronounced, that all taxes not enacted by the consent of the representatives of the people
<PB N="81" REF="029916_0092_0FE309D8FACBAE78"/>
were illegal; and afterwards gave a temporary sanction to the present levies, to avoid dissolving one government before they had framed another. They then turned their attention to the object next in importance, and declared, that, as soon as, in concert with his majesty, they should be able to fix the principles of national regeneration, they would employ themselves to examine and liquidate the national debt; mean time the cre∣ditors of the state were declared to be under the safe-guard of the honour of the French nation. These decrees concluded with a resolve, that the assembly, now become active, should dedicate it's first moments to enquire into the cause of the scarcity that afflicted the kingdom; and to search for a remedy the most prompt and effectual.</P>
<P>The nobles, bishops, and, in fact, the whole court, now seriously began to rally all their forces; convinced that it was become necessary, to op∣pose their united strength against the commons, to prevent their carrying every thing before them.</P>
<P>The chamber of the clergy had been engaged for several days, in discussing the question, where they should verify their powers. A number of them, during this discussion, appear to have ad∣vanced, feeling their way; for when they now came to divide, the majority decided to join the national assembly.</P>
<P>Alarmed by the prospect of this junction, one of the members of the chamber, which almost arrogated to itself the prerogative of legislation, that of the nobles, proposed an address to the king, beseeching him to dissove the states-general;
<PB N="82" REF="029916_0093_0FE308A8A1550520"/>
whilst the cause of the people was there vigor∣ously supported by a minority, feeble as to num∣bers, but powerful in argument, animated by the popularity, which their bold declaration could not fail to produce during the reign of enthusiasm.</P>
<P>This was a moment pregnant with great events. The court still trusted to subterfuge, and, hold∣ing the representatives of the people in superlative contempt, affected in some degree to yield to the prayer of the nation; though signifying, that the king was the only fountain of justice, and that he would grant any thing which his faithful subjects could reasonably demand. A trick as palpable as the design was flagrant; for at the instant they were pretending to see some reason in their re∣quisitions, they were guarding against their ob∣taining the only thing that could secure their rights, an equal representation; holding for this purpose mischievous councils, composed of cha∣racters most obnoxious in the eyes of the people. In these meetings it was resolved, to amuse the commons, until the army could be assembled; and then, in case of obstinacy, they would draw on themselves the consequence. Accordingly the 20th of June, the day on which the majority of the clergy was to join the commons, the herald proclaimed a <HI>séance royale</HI>; and a detachment of guards surrounded the hall of the national assembly, to take care (such was the shallow pre∣text) that it should be properly prepared for the reception of the king. The deputies came to the door at the usual hour; but only the president (Baillie) and the secretaries were permitted to enter to take away their papers: and they saw,
<PB N="83" REF="029916_0094_0FE308CC5B136968"/>
that the benches were already removed, and that all the entrances were guarded by a great number of soldiers.</P>
<P>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge is seldom relaxed by persecution; and the firm and spirited proceedings of the assembly on this day, gave the decided blow to the strata∣gems of the court. During the first tumult of surprise, it is true, some of the deputies talked of going immediately to Marly, to invite the king to come among them, and in a truly paternal manner to unite his power with their's to pro∣mote the public good; and thus by an energetic appeal to his heart and understanding, to convince him that they spoke the language of truth and reason. But others, more experienced in minis∣terial wiles, calmly advised to adjourn the sittings to the neighbouring Tennis-court. For they knew, that the hearts of courtiers are fortified with icy prejudices; and that, though a moment of sym∣pathy, a flow of life-blood, may thaw them at the instant, it is only to render them more hard, when the glow of genial heat is passed.</P>
<P>Assembled at the Tennis-court, they encouraged each other; and one mind actuated the whole body, in the presence of an applauding crowd, they joined hands solemnly, and took God to witness, that they would not separate, till a con∣stitution should be completed. The benedictions that dropped from every tongue, and sparkled in tears of joy from every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, giving fresh vigour to the heroism which excited them, produced an overflow of sensibility that kindled into a blaze of patriotism every social feeling. The dungeons of despotism and the bayonets sharpened for massacre, were then equally disregarded even by
<PB N="84" REF="029916_0095_0FE30A750DE3AA00"/>
the most fearful; till, in one of those instants of disinterested forgetfulness of private pursuits, all devoted themselves to the promotion of public happiness, promising to resist, to the last extre∣mity, all the efforts of such an inveterate tyranny. The absent deputies were sent for; and one, who happened to be sick, had himself carried to unite his feeble voice with the general cry. The very soldiers also, disobeying their officers, came to be willing centinels at the entrance of the sanc∣tuary of liberty, eagerly imbibing the sentiments, which they afterwards spread through their garrisons.</P>
<P>This indignity offered to the third estate could not fail to excite new sensations of disgust at Paris; and give a fresh spring to the animation of the people at large. Yet, this spirited behaviour of of the commons excited only supercilious con∣tempt at court. For the gay circles there were so far sunk in fastidious delicacy, and squeamish respect for polished manners, that they could not even discover magnanimity in the conduct of a peasant, or a shopkeeper; much less grandeur in an assembly regardless of ceremonials. And not to be deficient themselves in these respects, the <HI>séance royale</HI> was put off another day, in order that the galleries, which had been erected for the accommodation of spectators by the national assembly, might be removed.</P>
<P>This was another injudicious step on the part of the cabinet; because it afforded time for the clergy to unite with the commons, who were in search of a place sufficiently capacious to contain such a body. At length, collected in a church, the clergy, with several bishops at their head, and
<PB N="85" REF="029916_0096_0FE30A404A4ADB70"/>
two nobles of Dauphiné, joined them; and the place, seeming to reflect a sanctity on their union, tended to consolidate, under a nobler concave, the resolution taken in the Tennis-court.</P>
<P>The following day, the <HI>séance royale</HI> really took place, with all the exterior splendor usually ex∣hibited at these shows; which hitherto could scarcely be termed empty, because they produced the desired effect. But the public, having their attention tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to other things, now viewed with contempt, what had formerly inspired almost idolatrous respect. The deputies of the third-estate were again ordered to enter by a separate door, and even left a considerable time standing exposed to a heavy shower. The people, who were totally excluded, formed themselves into groups, making indignant comments on the re∣peated affronts offered to their representatives, whose minds likewise recoiled at the idle attempt to impress them with an opinion of their in∣significancy; when the very pains taken to do it proclaimed their growing importance in the state.</P>
<P>The object of the king's speech, on this occa∣sion, was to annul the whole proceedings of the national assembly, and to hold out certain bene∣fits, as lures to submission, which the king meant to grant to the people; as if, observes Mirabeau,
<Q>the rights of the people, were the favours of the king▪</Q>
A declaration of his sovereign will and pleasure was then read, in which, making an insidious attempt to withdraw from the assembly the confidence of the public, he declared, that, if they abandoned him, he would provide for the happiness of his people, without their assistance,
<PB N="86" REF="029916_0097_0FE309EE00662470"/>
knowing the purport of the instructions given to the deputies. The first article of the king's be∣nevolent <HI>intentions,</HI> was to grant to the states-general the power of furnishing supplies; care∣fully specifying, however, that it was to consist of the three orders, who were to vote according to the ancient mode. Some other salutary plans of reform were also brought forward; but always with artful modifications, that would enable the old abuses to keep a sure footing. For example, the taxes were to be levied equally; yet a cau∣tious respect for property sanction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> almost every other feudal privilege; and the absolute abolition of <HI>lettres de cachet,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the reign of Louis XV. two hundred and thirty thousand <HI>lettres de cachet</HI> had been issued; and after this, who will assert, that this was not an inveterate evil, which ought to be eradicated; for it is an insult to human reason, to talk of the modification of such abuses, as seem to be experiments to try how far human patience can be stretched.</NOTE> though his majesty wished to secure personal freedom, was hinted at as incom∣patible with public safety, and the preservation of the honour of private familes. The liberty of the press was allowed to be necessary; but the states-general were requested to point out a mode of rendering it compatible with the respect due to religion, to morality, and to the honour of the citizens. The tenor of all the rest of the articles was the same: commencing with a plan of re∣form, and concluding with the <HI>ifs</HI> and <HI>buts,</HI> that were to render it void.—Then winding round to the grand object of the meeting, the king terminated his discourse, with saying, forgetful that this was not the period to imagine himself
<PB N="87" REF="029916_0098_0FE30A41D01C7360"/>
reigning at Constantinople,
<Q>I <HI>command</HI> you to separate immediately, and to attend, each of you, to morrow, at the chamber appropriated for your order, there to resume your sittings; and I have commanded, in consequence, the grand master of the ceremonies to order the halls to be prepared.</Q></P>
<P>The majority of the nobles, and the minority of the clergy, obeyed this preremptory order, and obseq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usly followed the king, like the train∣ed horses of his court. The members of the national asse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly, however, remained sitting, preserving a silence, more menacing and terrible, than the <HI>I will,</HI> or <HI>I command,</HI> of the cabinet; when the grand master of the ceremonies entered, and addressing himself to the president, reminded him, in the king's name, of the order given to separate immediately. The president answered,
<Q>that the assembly was not constituted to receive orders from any person;</Q>
but Mirabeau, who thought this reply too tame, started up, and ad∣dressing the messenger, said:
<Q>yes; we have heard the intentions which the king has been induced to utter; and you cannot be his organ in this assembly.—You, who have neither seat, nor right to speak, ought not to remind us of his discourse. However, to avoid all equivocation or delay, I declare to you, that if you are charged to make us go from hence, you should demand orders to employ force; for only the bayonet can oblige us to quit our places.</Q>
It is difficult to conceive the ardour inspired by this prompt eloquence. It's fire flew from breast to breast, whilst a whisper ran round, that what
<PB N="88" REF="029916_0099_0FE30A76C7A40E00"/>
Mirabeau had just uttered, gave a finishing stroke to the revolution.</P>
<P>A warm debate ensued; and the assembly de∣claring their adherence to their former decrees, the abbé Siéyes said, in his dry, cogent manner:
<Q>gentlemen, you are to day what you were yesterday.</Q>
A motion was then made, by Mi∣rabean, who suggested, as a prudent precaution against the measures of a desperatec abal, that the person of each deputy should be pronounced in∣violable; and, after a slight discussion, it was carried unanimously.</P>
<P>From this moment we may consider the nation and court at open war. The court had at their command the whole military force of the empire, amounting, at least, to 200,000 men. The peo∣ple, on the contrary, had only their bare arms, invigorated, it is true, by the new-born love of freedom, to oppose to the various weapons of tyranny. But the army, partaking of the com∣mon misery, were not deaf to the complaints or arguments of their fellow citizens: and they were particularly led to consider them with compla∣cency, because a just apprehension, or prudent foresight, had induced many of the popular assem∣blies, to insert a cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se in their instructions, re∣commending, that the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the soldiers should be augmented. Thus recognized as fellow citi∣zens, this class of men, whom it had been the policy of the despots of Europe to keep at a dis∣tance from the other inhabitants, making them a distinct class, to oppress and corrupt the rest, began to feel an interest in the common cause. But the court, who either could not, or would
<PB N="89" REF="029916_0100_0FE30A4353AFB028"/>
not, combine these important facts, rashly pre∣cipitated themselves into the very quicksand, into which they were vainly endeavouring to drive the commons.</P>
<P>As Necker had not attended in his place, at the <HI>séance royale,</HI> it gave colour to the rumour, which had for some time prevailed, that he proposed to retire from the ministry: so that, when the king returned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was followed by an immense crowd, who could not conceal their discontent. Under the influence also of the same fear, a number of the deputies hastened to Necker, to intreat him not to resign. And the consternation increasing, the queen, who has ever been the first to desert her own plans, when there appeared a shadow of personal danger, sent for him; and, the better to cover the project of the cabinet, prevailed on him not to quit his post. The object of the cabinet he either had not the penetration to dis∣cover; or he had not sufficient magnanimity to resign a place, that gratified equally his pride and his avarice. This measure tended to tran∣quillize the minds of the people, though it was undermining their cause: for trusting to the in∣tegrity of this minister, who promised,
<Q>to live or die with them,</Q>
they did not perceive, that he wanted the energy of soul necessary to enable him to act up to the principles he professed. However, the cause of liberty, as circumstances have proved, did not depend on the talents of one or two men.—It was the fiat of the nation; and the machinations of the tyrants of Europe have not ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been able to overturn it; though false patiots have led them, in their ardour for
<PB N="90" REF="029916_0101_0FE30A784E23E750"/>
reform, to the commission of actions the most cruel and unjust. Every thing was effected by natural causes; and we shall find, if we take a cursory view of the progress of knowledge, that it's advance towards simple principles is invariably in a ratio, which must speedily change the tangled system of European politics.</P>
<P>The <HI>séance royale</HI> produced so little effect, that the assembly, as if their sittings had never been interrupted, met the next day at the old hall; and the day after, the minority of the nobles, which consisted of forty-seven members, came to incorporate themselves with the commons. All of these, and particularly the duke of Orleans, who led them, acquired by this popular conduct, the love and confidence of the nation. How far they merited it, deceiving the public, or them∣selves, their future conduct will best explain.</P>
<P>The interesting events, in fact, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch almost daily occurred, at the commencement of the re∣volution, fired the fancies of men of different descriptions; till, forgetting every selfish con∣sideration, the rich and poor saw through the same focus. But, when the former had time to cool, and felt more forcibly than the latter the inconveniences of anarchy, they returned with fresh vigour to their old ground; embracing with redoubled ardour, the prejudices which passion, not conviction, had chased from the field, during the heat of action. This was a strong reinforce∣ment for the staunch aristocrats; because these were mostly good, but short-sighted people, who really wished, that justice might be established, as the foundation of the new government, though
<PB N="91" REF="029916_0102_0FE30A4BADFE4AC0"/>
they flinched when their present ease was disturb∣ed; and it was necessary to give more than good wishes.</P>
<P>This minority of nobles must certainly be allow∣ed to have acted more prudently than their peers; and several of them, the most respectable men of that class, both in talents and morals, were pro∣bably actuated by half comprehended principles. The great body of the nobles, nevertheless, and the minority of the clergy, continued to meet in different chambers, where their idle deliberations marked their decayed influence. For, shrinking into nothing, their present struggles to regain their power were as fruitless, as their former efforts had been presumptuous. Yet the jealou∣sies and contumely of the nobility continued to agitate the commons; who, animated by a con∣sciousness of the justice of their cause, and feeling that they possessed the confidence of the public, determined to proceed with the objects of their meeting, without the concurrence of the first order; proving to them, when it was too late to preserve their factitious distinctions, that their power and authority were at an end. In vain were they told, that they were acting contrary to their true interest, and risking the salvation of their privileges. In vain did one of the most moderate of the deputies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Count Lally Tolendal.</NOTE> remonstrate with them, on what, most probably, would be the conse∣quence of their obstinacy. No argument could move them; and, blind to the danger with which they were threatened, they persisted to attend their councils, without any determinate rule of
<PB N="92" REF="029916_0103_0FE30A03809FE598"/>
action. It is true, the duke of Luxembourgh declared, in a private committee held by the king, on the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> of June, that
<Q>the division of the orders would controul the exorbitant claims of the people, and preserve those of the monarch; united,</Q>
added he,
<Q>they know no master, divid∣ed, they are your subjects;</Q>
and he concluded, with emphatically saying, that
<Q>it would save the independence of the crown, and stamp with nullity the proceedings of the national assem∣bly.</Q>
These were manly, though not patriotic sentiments; and if the court had rallied round them, and defended them to the last extremity, they would at any rate have prevented their dis∣grace, by avoiding the crooked path of treachery. But abandoning all dignity of conduct, they trusted to the art of manoeuvring, which defeat∣ed by the people, they were left entirely at their mercy.</P>
<P>With respect to the improvement of society, since the destruction of the Roman empire, En∣gland seems to have led the way, rendering certain obstinate prejudices almost null, by a gradual change of opinion. This observation, which facts will support, may be brought for∣ward, to prove, that just sentiments gain footing only in proportion as the understanding is enlarg∣ed by cultivation, and freedom of thought, instead of being cramped by the dread of bastiles and inquisitions. In Italy and France, for ex∣ample where the mind dared to exercise itself only to form the taste, the nobility were, in the strictest sense of the word, a cast keeping aloof from the people; whilst in England they inter∣mingled with the commerical men, whose equal
<PB N="93" REF="029916_0104_0FE30A4D8D51D9E0"/>
or superior fortunes made the nobles overlook their inequality of birth: thus giving the first blow to the ignorant pride that retarded the for∣mation of just opinions respecting true dignity of character. This monied interest, from which political improvement first emanates, was not yet formed in France; and the ridiculous pride of her nobles, which led them to believe, that the purity of their families would be sullied, if they agreed to act in the same sphere with the people, was a prevailing motive, that prevented their junction with the commons. But the more licentious part of the clergy, who followed with a truer scent their own interest, thought it expe∣dient to espouse, in time, the cause of the power from whence their influence derived it's greatest force; and from which alone they could hope for support. This schism proved, as it promised, dangerous to the views of the court.</P>
<P>The desertion of the clergy rendered the nobility outrageous, and hastened the crisis when the important contest was to be brought to an issue.—Then it was that the king perceived how contemptible his undecided conduct had been, and exclaiming, it is said, confidently,
<Q>that he remained ALONE in the midst of the nation, oc∣cupied with the establishment of concord.</Q>
Vain words! and this affectation was par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>larly reprehensible, because he had already g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or∣ders for the assembling of the foreign t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the object of which was to establish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the point of the bayonet.</P>
<P>This total want of character caused him to be flattered by all parties, and trusted by none. In∣significancy had distinguished his manners in his
<PB N="94" REF="029916_0105_0FE30A37149758D8"/>
own court. Actions without energy, and pro∣fessions without sincerity, exhibiting a conduct destitute of steadiness, made the cabinet concert all their measures regardless of his opinion, leaving to the queen the task of persuading him to adopt them. The evil did not rest even here; for the different parties following separate views, the flexibility of his temper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed him to sanction things the most at variance, and most dangerous to his future honour and safety. For it appears obvi∣ous, that whatever party had prevailed, he could only be considered as an instrument; which, be∣coming useless when the object should be at∣chieved, would be treated with disrespect. Pe∣riods of revolution drawing into action the worst as well as the best of men; and as audacity, in general, triumphs over modest merit, when the political horizon is ruffled by tempest; it amount∣ed to a moral certainty, that the line of con∣duct pursued by the king would lead to his dis∣grace and ruin.</P>
<P>Seeing, however, that the people were unani∣mous in their approbation of the conduct of their representatives, and watchful to discover the de∣signs of their enemies; it could not but occur to the cabinet, that the only way to lull attention to sleep, was to affect to submit to necessity. Be∣sides, fearing, if they continued to resort to their different chambers, that their plot would take wind before all the agents were assembled, a fresh instance of dissimulation evinced, that their de∣pravity equalled their stupidity. For the king was now prevailed on to write to the presidents of the nobility, and the minority of the clergy, requesting them, to represent to those two orders
<PB N="95" REF="029916_0106_0FE30A340C51D2E8"/>
the necessity of uniting with the third, to proceed to the discussion of his proposals, made at the <HI>séance royale.</HI></P>
<P>The clergy immediately acquiesced; but the nobility continued to oppose a junction so humi∣liating, till the court invented a pretext of ho∣nour to save the credit of their mock dignity, by declaring that the life of the king would be in imminent danger, should the nobles continue to resist the desire of the nation. Pretending to believe this report, for the secret of the cabinet was buzzed amongst them, and appearing to wish to bury all rivalry in royalty, they attended at the common hall, the 27th. Yet even there, the first step they took was to enter a protest, in order to guard against this concession being made a precedent.</P>
<P>A general joy succeeded the terror which had been engendered in the minds of the people by their contumelious perversness; and the Pari∣sians, cherishing the most sanguine expectations, reckoned, that an unity of exertions would secure to them a redress of grievances.</P>
<P>It is perhaps unnecessary to dwell, for a mo∣ment, on the insensibility of the court, and the credulity of the people; as they seem the only clues, that will lead us to a precise discrimination of the causes, which completely annihilated all confidence in the ministers, who have succeeded the directors of those infamous measures, that swept away the whole party; measures which involved thousands of innocent people in the same ruin, and have produced a clamour against the proceedings of the nation, that has obscured the glory of her labours. It is painful to follow,
<PB N="96" REF="029916_0107_0FE30A3D76083AC8"/>
through all their windings, the crimes and follies produced by want of sagacity, and just principles of action. For instance, the <HI>séance royale</HI> was held on the 23d, when the king, not deigning to advise, commanded the deputies to repair to their different chambers; and only four days after he implored the nobility and clergy to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every consideration, and accede to the wish of the peo∣ple. Acting in this contradictory mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it is clear, that the cabal though only of rendering sure the decided blow, which was to level with the dust, the power that extorted suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> humiliat∣ing concessions.</P>
<P>But the people, easy of belief, and glad to be light-hearted again, no sooner heard that an union of the orders had taken place, by the desire of the king, than they hurried from all quarters, with good-humoured confidence, called for the king and queen, and testified, in their presence, the grateful joy this acquiescence had inspired. How different was this frankness of the people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hypocritical conduct of the ca∣bal!</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtly, dignified politeness of the queen, with all those complacent graces which dance round flattered beauty▪ whose every charm is drawn forth by the consciousness of pleasing, pro∣mised all that a sanguine fancy had pourtrayed of future happiness and peace. From her fascinat∣ing smile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, indeed, was caught the careless hope, that, expanding the heart, makes the animal spirit vibrate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n every nerve, with pleasure:— yet, he smiled but to deceive; or, if she felt some touches of sympathy, it was only the unison of the moment.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="029916_0108_0FE30A0502774190"/>It is certain, that education, and the atmos∣phere of manners in which a character is formed, change the natural laws of humanity; other∣wise it would be unaccountable, how the human heart can be so dead to the tender emotions of benevolence, which most forcibly teach us, that real of lasting felicity flows only from a love of virtue, and the practice of sincerity.</P>
<P>The unfortunate queen of France, beside the advantages of birth and station, possessed a very fine person; and her lovely face, sparkling with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vacity, hid the want of intelligence. Her complexion was dazzling clear; and when she was pleased, her manners were bewitching; for she happily mingled the most insinuating volup∣tuous softness and affability, with an air of gran∣deur, bordering on pride, that rendered the con∣trast more st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king. Independence also, of whatever kind, always gives a degree of dignity to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; so that monarchs and nobles, with most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oble souls, from believing themselves superior to others, have actually acquired a look of superiority.</P>
<P>But her opening faculties were poisoned in the bud; for before she came to Paris, she had already been prepared, by a corrupt, supple abbé for the part she was to play; and, young as she was, became so firmly attached to the aggran∣dizement of her house, that, though plunged deep in pleasure she never omitted sending immense sums to her brother, on every occasion. The person of the king, in itself very disgusting, was rendered more so by gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tony, and a total disregard of delicacy, and even decency in his apartments: and, when jealous of the queen, for
<PB N="98" REF="029916_0109_0FE309F7B83CC638"/>
whom he had a kind of devouring passion, he treated her with great brutality, till she acquired sufficient finesse to subjugate him. Is it then surprizing, that a very desirable woman, with a sanguine constitution, should shrink abhorrent from his embraces; or that an empty mind should be employed only to vary the pleasures, which emasculated her circe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n court? And, add∣ed to this, the histories of the Julias and Messa∣linas of antiquity, convincingly prove, that there is no end to the vagaries of the imagination, when power is unlimited, and reputation set at defiance.</P>
<P>Lost then in the most luxurious pleasures, or managing court intrigues, the queen became a profound dissembler; and her heart hardened by sensual enjoyments to such a degree, that when her family and favourites stood on the brink of ruin, her little portion of mind was employed only to preserve herself from danger. As a proof of the justness of this assertion, it is only necessary to observe, that, in the general wreck, not a scrap of her writing has been found to criminate her; neither has she suffered a word to escape her to exasperate the people, even when burning with rage, and contempt. The effect that adversity may have on her choaked understanding time will show <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written some months before the death of the queen.</NOTE>; but during her prosperity, the moments of languor, that glide into the interstices of enjoyment, were passed in the most childish manner; without the appearance of any vigour of mind, to palliate the
<PB N="99" REF="029916_0110_0FE30A4F1182B250"/>
wanderings of the imagination.—Still she was a woman of uncommon address; and though her conversation was insipid, her compliments were so artfully adapted to flatter the person she wished to please or dupe, and so eloquent is the beauty of a queen, in the eyes even of superior men, that she seldom failed to carry her point when she endeavoured to gain an ascendancy over the mind of an individual. Over that of the king she acquired unbounded sway, when, managing the disgust she had for his person, she made him pay a kingly price for her favours. A court is the best school in the world for actors; it was very natural then for her to become a complete actress, and an adept in all the arts of coquetry that debauch the mind, whilst they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender the person alluring.</P>
<P>Had the hapless Louis possessed any decision of character, to support <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s glimmering sense of right, he would from this period have chosen a line of conduct, that might have saved his life by regulating his future politics. For this returning affection of the people alone was sufficient to prove to him, that it was not easy to eradicate their love for royalty; because, whilst they were contending for their rights with the nobility, they were happy to receive them as acts of beneficence from the king. But the education of the heir apparent of a crown must necessarily destroy the common sagacity and feel∣ings of a man; and the education of this monarch, like that of Louis XV, only tended to make him a sensual bigot.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="029916_0111_0FE309E3BA6F2EC8"/>Priests have, in general, contrived to become the preceptors of kings; the more surely to sup∣port the church, by leaning it against the throne. Besides; kings, who without having their un∣derstandings enlarged, are set above attending to the forms of morality, which sometimes pro∣duce it's spirit, are always particularly fond of those religions systems, which, like a sponge, wipe out the crimes that haunt the terrified ima∣gination of unsound minds.</P>
<P>It has been the policy of the court of France, to throw an odium on the understanding of the king, when it was lavishing praises on the good∣ness of his heart. Now it is certain, that he possessed a considerable portion of sense and discernment; though he wanted that firmness of mind, which constitutes character; or, in more precise words, the power of acting accord∣ing to the dictates of a man's own reason. He was a tolerable scholar; had sufficient patience to learn the English language; and was an inge∣nious mechanic. It is also well known, that it the council, when he followed only the light of his own reason, he often fixed on the most sage measures, which he was afterwards persuaded to abandon. But death seems to be the sport of kings, and, like the Roman tyrant, whose so∣litary amusement was transfixing flies, this man, whose milkiness of heart has been perpetually contrasted with the pretended watriness of his head, was extremely fond of seeing those gri∣maces, made by tortured animals, which rouse to pleasure sluggish, gross sensations. The queen, however, prevailed on him not to at∣tempt
<PB N="101" REF="029916_0112_0FE30A3590176E38"/>
to amuse her, or raise a forced laugh, in a polite circle, by throwing a cat down the chimney, or shooting an harmless ass. Taught also to dissemble, from his cradle, he daily prac∣tised the despicable shifts of duplicity; though led by his indolence to take, rather than to give, the tone to his domineering parasites.</P>
<P>The French nobility, perhaps the most cor∣rupt and ignorant set of men in the world, except in tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e objects of taste, wich consist in giving variety to amusement, had never lived under the controul of any law, but the authority of the king; and having only to dread the Bastile for a little time, should they commit any enormity, could not patiently brook the restraints, the bet∣ter government of the whole society required. Haughtily then disregarding the suggestions of humanity, and even prudence, they determined to subvert every thing sooner than resign their privileges; and this tenacity will not appear asto∣nishing, if we call to mind, that they consider∣ed the people as beasts of burden, and trod them under foot with the mud. This is not a figure of rhetoric; but a melancholy truth! For it is notorious, that, in the narrow streets of Paris, where there are no foot-ways to secure the walkers from danger, they were frequently killed, without slackening, by the least emotion of fel∣low-feeling, the gallop of the thoughtless being, whose manhood was buried in a factitious character.</P>
<P>I shall not now recapitulate the feudal tyran∣nies, which the progress of civilization has rendered nugatory; it is sufficient to observe, that, as neither the life nor property of the
<PB N="102" REF="029916_0113_0FE30A7EEE26F4E8"/>
citizens was secured by equal laws, both were often wantonly sported with by those who could do it with impunity. Arbitrary decrees have too often assumed the sacred majesty of law; and when men live in continual fear, and know not what they have to apprehend, they always become cunning and pusillanimous. Thus the abject manners, produced by despotism of any species, seem to justify them, in the eyes of those who only judge of things from their pre∣sent appearance. This leads, likewise, to an ob∣servation, that partly accounts for the want of industry and cleanliness in France; for the peo∣ple are very apt to sport away their time, when they cannot look forward, with some degree of certainty, to the consolidation of a plan of future ease.</P>
<P>Every precaution was taken to divide the na∣tion, and prevent any ties of affection, such as ought always to unite man with man, in all the relationships of life, from bringing the two ranks together with any thing like equality to consoli∣date them. If, for instance, the son of a noble∣man happened so far to forget his rank, as to marry a woman of low birth; what misery have not those unfortunate creatures endured!— confined in prisons, or hunted out of the com∣mon nest, as contagious intruders. And if we remember also, that, while treated with contempt, only a twentieth part of the profit of his labour fell to the share of the husbandman, we shall cease to inquire, why the nobles opposed inno∣vations, that must necessarily have overturned the fabric of despotism.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="029916_0114_0FE30A5095627108"/>The inveterate pride of the nobles, the rapacity of the clergy, and the prodigality of the court, were, in short, the secret springs of the plot, now almost ripe, aimed at the embryo of free∣dom through the heart of the national assem∣bly. But Paris, that city which contains so many different characters—that vortex, which draws every vice into it's centre—that repository of all the materials of voluptuous degeneracy— that den of spies and assassins—contained likewise a number of enlightened men, and was able to raise a very formidable force, to defend its opinions.</P>
<P>The cabinet saw it's rising spirit with suspi∣cion; and, resorting to their old wiles, produced a scarcity of bread, hoping that, when the people should be disheartened, the approaching army under Broglio would bring the whole affair to a speedy issue. But circumstances seemed fa∣vourable to the people; for the electors of Paris, after they had chosen their deputies, the election having been protracted very late, continued to meet at the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> to prepare the instruc∣tions, which they had not time to digest before the assembling of the states-general.</P>
<P>At this juncture also, a spacious square, equally devoted to business and pleasure, called the <HI>Palais Royale,</HI> became the rendezvous of the citi∣zens. There the most spirited gave lectures, whilst more modest men read the popular papers and pamphlets, on the benefits of liberty, and the crying oppressions of absolute governments. This was the centre of information; and the whole city flocking thither, to talk or to listen, returned home warmed with the love of free∣dom,
<PB N="104" REF="029916_0115_0FE30A819EEE84A0"/>
and determined to oppose, at the ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of life, the power that should still labour to enslave them—and when life is put on the cast, do not men generally gain that for which they strive with those, who wanting their enthusiasm, set more value on the stake?</P>
<P>The turbulence of the metropolis, produced in great measure by the continual arrival of foreign troops, furnished, nevertheless, a plausible pretext for blockading it; and thirty-five thou∣sand men, at least, mostly consisting of hussar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and mercenary troops, were drawn from the frontiers, and collected round Versailles. Camps were traced out for still more: and the posts, that commanded the roads leading to Paris, were filled with soldiers. The courtiers, then un∣able to repress their joy, vaunted, that the na∣tional assembly would soon be dissolved, and the rebellious deputies silenced by imprisonment, of death. And should even the French soldiers abandon them, among whom there were some symptoms of revolt, the court depended on the foreign troops, to strike terror into the very heart of Paris and Versailles. The gathering army was already a very formidable force; but the spirit of enthusiasm, and a keen sense of in∣juries, rendered more sharp by insults, had such an effect on the people, that instead of being intimidated, they coolly began to prepare for defence.</P>
<P>All had heard, or were now informed of the efforts made by the Americans to maintain their liberty.—All had heard of the glorious firmness of a handful of raw Bostonian militia, who, on Bunker's-hill, resisted the British disciplined
<PB N="105" REF="029916_0116_0FE30A580312DD80"/>
troops, crimsoning the plains of Charlestown with the blood of the stower of their enemy's army. This lesson for tyrants had resounded through the kingdom; and it ought to have taught them, that men determined to be free are always supe∣rior to mercenary battalions even of veterans.</P>
<P>The popular leaders had also taken the surest means to ingratiate themselves with the soldiery, by mixing with them, and continually insinuating, that citizens ought not to allow the base minis∣ters of power, to treat them like passive instru∣ments of mischief. Besides, it was natural to expect, that the military, the most idle body of men in the kingdom, should attend to the topics of the day, and profit by the discussions, that disseminated new political principles. And such an influence had the arguments in favour of liberty on their minds, that, so early as the 23d of June, during a slight riot, two companies of the grenadiers refused to fire on the people, whom they were sent to disperse. But these symptoms of refractoriness roused the resent∣ment of the court, instead of putting it on it's guard: consequently several were sent to prison, and the troops were confined to their barracks; yet, regardless of these orders, they came in crowds to the <HI>Palais Royale,</HI> a day or two after, eager to unite their voices with the general shout, <HI>vive la nation,</HI> which spoke the present sentiments of the people. The regiments of French, also, that now arrived, to be stationed with the foreign troops round Paris, were conducted to this hot∣bed of patriotism; and, meeting with the most cordial reception, they listened with interest to the lively representations of the enormities com∣mitted
<PB N="106" REF="029916_0117_0FE30A8323D0C320"/>
by their old government, and of the mean∣ness of those men, who could live on the bread earned by butchering their fellow citizens.</P>
<P>Whilst these opinions were taking root, the people heard that eleven of the French guards, confined in the Abbey, because they would not obey the order to fire on the populace, were to be transferred to the <HI>Bicetre,</HI> the most ignominious of all the prisons. The contest now commenced; for the people hastened to deliver them, and, forcing their way, emancipated their friends; and even the hussars, who were call∣ed out to quell the disturbance, laid down their arms. Yet, attentive to justice, they sent back to confinement a soldier, who had been previous∣ly committed by the police, for some other mis∣demeanour.</P>
<P>Exasperated as they were, the people, not yet become lawless, guarded the men they had rescued; whilst they se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a deputation to the national assembly, to intercede with the king in their behalf. This spirited, yet prudent, beha∣viour, produced the desired effect; and the as∣sembly named a certain number of the deputies, who with scrupulous decorum were to demand this grace of the king: and he accordingly grant∣ed their pardon, laying a cautious stress on it's being the first request made by the assembly. But it was still questionable, whether this extort∣ed act of lenity were not done, like the other actions of the court, only to blind the prepara∣tions that were making to humble effectually the soldiery, the metropolis, and the assem∣bly.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="029916_0118_0FE30A0740CB79D8"/>During this period of general suspicion, the presence of such a considerable force, as now was encamped on every side of the capital, particularly alarmed the electors, who held their deliberations very constantly to watch over the public peace; and in order to avert the threaten∣ing storm, they proposed raising the city militia. Yet, before they determined, they sent to ap∣prise the national assembly of their intention; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the king to be informed, that, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> force were necessary to secure the public tranquillity, the citizens themselves were the most proper persons to be entrusted with the commission.</P>
<P>The unsettled state of Paris, now suffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing from a scarcity of bread, furnished, however, a plausible pretext for the augmentation of the troops, which increased the calamity.
<Q>When it is with the greatest difficulty,</Q>
says one of the electors,
<Q>that we can procure provision for the inhabitants, was it necessary to increase the fa∣mine and our fears, by calling together a num∣ber of soldiers, who were dispersed through all the provinces? These troops,</Q>
he adds,
<Q>were destined to guard the frontiers, whilst the re∣presentatives of the nation are deliberating on the formation of a constitution. But this con∣stitution, desired by the king, and demanded by all the provinces of France, has to cope with dangerous interior enemies.</Q></P>
<P>The national assembly, likewise, could not but perceive, that more soldiers were stationed near them, than would have been sufficient to repel a foreign invasion; and Mirabeau, with his usual fervour, animated them to action, by a
<PB N="108" REF="029916_0119_0FE30A84A6FE9310"/>
lively picture of their situation.
<Q>Thirty-five thousand men,</Q>
he observed,
<Q>are now distri∣buted between Paris and Versailles; and twenty thousand more are expected. Trains of artil∣lery follow them; and places are already marked out for batteries. They have made sure of all the communications.—All our entrances are intercepted; our roads, our bridges, and our public walks, are changed into military posts. The notorious events, the secret orders, and precipitate counter-orders— in short, prepara∣tions for war, strike every eye, and fill with indignation every heart. Gentlemen, if the q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stion were only the insulted dignity of the assembly, it would demand the attention of the king himself; for should he not take care, that we be treated with decency, since we are depu∣ties of the nation from which his glory ema∣nates, which alone constitutes the splendor of the throne?—Yes; of that nation, who will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder the person of the king honourable in proportion as he respects himself? Since his wish is to command free men, it is time to banish the old odious forms, those insulting pro∣ceedings, which too easily persuade the cour∣tiers, who surround the prince, that royal ma∣jesty consists in the abasing relation of master and slave; that a legitimate and beloved king ought on all occasions to show himself with the aspect of an irritated tyrant; or, of those usur∣pers condemned by their melancholy fate, to mistake the tender and flattering sentiments of confidence.—And who will dare to say, that circumstances have rendered necessary these me∣nacing measures? On the contrary, I am going
<PB N="109" REF="029916_0120_0FE30A5987830CC8"/>
to demonstrate, that they are equally useless and dangerous, considered either with respect to good order, the quieting of the public, or the safety of the throne: and, far from appearing the fruit of a sincere attachment to the person of the monarch, they can only gratify private passions, and cover persidious designs. Un∣dubtedly I do not know every pretext, every artifice of the enemies of reformation, since I cannot divine with what plausible reason they have coloured the pretended want of troops, at a moment, when not only their inutility, but their danger, strikes every mind.</Q></P>
<P><Q>With what eye will the people, harassed by so many calamities, see this swarm of idle soldiers come to dispute with them their morsel of bread? The contrast of the plenty enjoyed by one, with the indigence of the other; of the security of the soldiers, to whom the manna falls, without it's being necessary for them to think of to∣morrow, with the anguish of the people, who obtain nothing but by hard labour and painful sweat; is sufficient to make every heart sink with despondency. Added to this, gentlemen, the presence of the troops heats the imagination of the populace; and by continually presenting new fears, excites an universal effervescence, till the citizens are at their very fire-sides a prey to every kind of terror. The people, roused and agitated, form tumultuous assemblies; and, giving way to their impetuosity, precipitate themselves into danger—for fear neither calcu∣lates nor reasons!</Q>
He concluded with moving an address to the king, representing, that the people were extremely alarmed by the assembling
<PB N="110" REF="029916_0121_0FE30A8C9D450AC0"/>
of such a number of troops, and the preparations made to form camps during this season of scarcity; and to remonstrate respecting the conduct of those, who sought to destroy the confidence that ought to subsist between the king and the repre∣sentatives of the people—a confidence, which alone can enable them to fulfil their functions, and establish the reform expected from their zeal by a suffering nation.</P>
<P>This speech produced the desired effect; and the motion being carried, Mirabeau was requested to prepare an address for their con∣sideration.</P>
<P>The purport of the address was an abridgment of the above speech; respectful; nay, even affec∣tionate; but spirited and noble.</P>
<P>Yet this remonstrance, so well calculated to preserve the dignity of the monarch, and appease the agitation of the public, produced no other effect than a supercilious answer, that only tended to increase the want of confidence, to which disgust gave a new edge. For, instead of attend∣ing to the prayer of the nation, the king asserted, that the tumultuous and scandalous scenes, which had passed at Paris, and at Versailles, under his own eyes, and those of the national assembly, were sufficient to induce him, one of whose prin∣cipal duties it was to watch over the public safety, to station troops round Paris.—Still, he declared, that, far from intending to interrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their freedom of debate, he only wished to pre∣serve them even from all apprehension of tumult and violence. If, however, the necessary pre∣sence of the troops continue to give umbrage, he was willing, at the request of the assembly, to
<PB N="111" REF="029916_0122_0FE30A5B0B35F6F0"/>
transfer the states-general to Noyon or Soissons; and to repair himself to Compiégne, in order to maintain the requisite intercourse with the assem∣bly. This answer signified nothing; or, rather, it formally announced, that the king would not send away the troops. Obvious as was the mean∣ing, and contemptible as was the dissimulation, yet, as it came from the sovereign, the fountain of fortune and honours, some of the supple hands of the deputies applauded.—But, Mirabeau was not to be cajoled by such shallow fallacy.
<Q>Gen∣tlemen,</Q>
said he, impatiently,
<Q>the goodness of the king's heart is so well known, that we might tranquilly confide in his virtue, did he always act from himself.—But, the assurances of the king are no guarantee for the conduct of his ministers, who have not ceased to mislead his good disposition.—And have we yet to learn, that the habitual confidence of the French in their king is less a virtue than a vice, if it ex∣tended to all parts of the administration?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who amongst us is ignorant, in fact, that it is our blind, giddy inconsideration, which has led us from century to century, from fault to fault, to the crisis that now afflicts us, and which ought at last to open our eyes, if we have not resolved to be head-strong children and slaves till the end of time?</Q></P>
<P><Q>The reply of the king is a pointed refusal. The ministry would have it regarded only as a simple form of assurance and goodness; and they have affected to think, that we have made our demand, without attaching much interest to it's success, and only to appear to have made it. It is necessary to undeceive the ministry.—Cer∣tainly,
<PB N="112" REF="029916_0123_0FE30A8F6E467F20"/>
my opinion is, not to fail in the confi∣dence and respect which we owe to the virtues of the king; but I likewise advise, that we be no more inconsistent, timid, and wavering in our measures.—Certainly, there is no need to deliberate on the removal proposed; for, in short, notwithstanding the king's answer, we will not go to Noyon, nor to Soissons.—We have not demanded this permission; nor will we, because it is scarcely probable, that we should ever desire to place ourselves between two or three bodies of troops; those which in∣vest Paris, and those which might fall upon us from Flanders and Alface. We have demanded the removal of the troops—that was the object of our address!—We have not asked permission to slee before them; but only that they should be sent from the capital. And it is not for ourselves, that we have made this demand; for they know very well, that it was suggested by a concern for the general interest, not by any sentiment of fear. At this moment, the presence of the troops disturbs the public order, and may produce the most melancholy events.— Our removal, far from preventing, would, on the contrary, only aggravate the evil. It is necessary, then, to restore peace, in spite of the friends of disorder; it is necessary, to be consistent with ourselves; and to be so, we have only to adhere to one line of conduct, which is to insist, without relaxing, that the troops be sent away, as the only sure way to obtain it.</Q></P>
<P>This speech, delivered on the 11th of July, produced no further decision in the assembly,
<PB N="113" REF="029916_0124_0FE30A5C8FE37588"/>
though it kept the attention of the members fixed to a point.</P>
<P>But things were now drawing rapidly to a crisis; for this very day Necker, who had been retained in place, only to hoodwink the people, was dismissed, with an injunction not to mention his dismission; and to leave the kingdom in twenty-four hours. These orders he servilely obeyed; and, with all the promptitude of personal fear, said, without the least emotion, to the nobleman, who brought the king's commands,
<Q>we shall meet this evening at the council;</Q>
and continued to converse, in his usual strain of smoothness, with the company at dinner. Miserable weakness! This man, who professed himself the friend of the people, and who had so lately promised 'to live or die with them,' had not, when brought to the test, sufficient magnanimity to warn them where danger threatened —For he must have known, that this dismission was the signal of hostilities: yet fleeing like a felon, he departed in disguise, keeping the secret with all the caution of cowardice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such is ever the conduct of <HI>soi-disant</HI> patriots.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next day, the appointment of the new ministry, men particularly obnoxious to the pub∣lic, made it known to the people; who viewed with melancholy horror the awful horizon, where had long been gathering the storm now ready to burst on their devoted heads. The agitation of the public mind, indeed, resembled a troubled sea; which, having been put in motion by a raging tornado, gradually swells, until the whole element, wave rolling on wave, exhibits one unbounded
<PB N="114" REF="029916_0125_0FE30A90F14E40E0"/>
commotion. All eyes were now opened, all saw the approaching blast; the hollow murmurs of which had inspired a confused terror for some time past.</P>
<P>It had been proposed on the 10th, at the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> as a regulation of the <HI>Garde-Bourgeoise,</HI> that twelve hundred men should be raised at a time, to be relieved every week; and the capital having been divided, at the election, into sixty districts, only twenty would be called out of each. And it was further resolved, that the districts should rest embodied until the entire evacuation of the troops, excepting those who formed the common complement of the guards. The following day it was decreed; an address was voted to the national assembly, to request their mediation with the king, to sanction im∣mediately the city militia; and the sittings of the committee were adjourned till Monday, the 13th. But some of the electors, having heard on Sunday, that the populace were all repairing to the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> hastened there about six o'clock in the evening, and found the hall indeed crowded with people of all conditions. A thousand con∣fused voices demanded arms, and orders to sound the <HI>tocsin.</HI></P>
<P>At eight o'clock, the patrol guard was re∣lieved, at the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> and the multitude pressed on the soldiers to disarm them; redoubling the cry for arms at the moment; and even threat∣ened to set fire to the hall. But, still observing some respect for subordination, they demanded, a little imperiously, it is true, an order, in virtue of which, the citizens might arm them∣selves to repulse the danger that menaced the
<PB N="115" REF="029916_0126_0FE30A647A61ADC0"/>
capital—and amidst these clamours, several pre∣cipitate reports painted, in the most lively colours, this danger.</P>
<P>One of the crowd said, that, no sooner had the news of the dismission of Necker reached Paris, than the people hastened to a sculptor's, and, seizing the busts of that minister, and of the duke of Orleans, they were now actually carrying them through the streets:—Another informed them, that the multitude had rushed into the different theatres, at the hour of opening them, and required, that they should be instantly shut;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an event much more important at Paris, than it would be in London.</NOTE> and that in consequence all the spectators had been sent away:—A third anounced four cannons, placed at the entrance of the <HI>Champs Elysées,</HI> with their cannoneers ready to light their matches, which were to begin the combat; and that these four cannons were supported by a regiment of cavalry, which, advancing under the command of the prince de Lambesc to the place of Louis XV. was stationed by the bridge that leads to the Thuilleries. He added also, that a <HI>cavalier</HI> of this regiment, passing by a soldier of the French guards, had fired his pistol at him; and, that the prince de Lambesc himself had galloped into the garden, sabre in hand, followed by a detachment, who put to flight the old men, women, and children, that were peaceably taking their customary walk; nay, that he had actually killed, with his own hand, an old man, who was escaping from the tumult. The reporter, it is true, forgot to notice, that the populace
<PB N="116" REF="029916_0127_0FE30A9396C9DCC0"/>
had begun to pelt the prince with the stones that were lying ready, near the buildings which were not finished. Startled, perhaps, by this resistance, and despising the mob, that he ex∣pected, only by his presence, to have intimidated, in a delirium, most probably, of terror and astonishment, he wounded an unarmed man, who fled before him. Be that as it may, this wanton outrage excited the indignation necessary to fire every spirit.</P>
<P>The electors being still pressed for arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and unable to furnish them, at eleven o'clock de∣creed, that the districts should be immediately con∣voked; and that they would repair to all the posts of armed citizens, to beg them, in the name of their country, to avoid all species of riot.— But this was not the moment to talk of peace, when all were making ready for battle.—The tumult now became general. To arms! To arms! re-echoed from all quarters—and the whole city was instantly in motion, seeking for weapons of defence. Whilst the women and children rent the air with shrieks and lamentations, the cannons were fired; and the <HI>tocsins</HI> of the different parish churches joined by degrees, to excite, and continue, the universal alarm.</P>
<P>Still all their thoughts were turned on defen∣sive measures. Many of the citizens, by ran∣sacking the warehouses of arms, and catching up spits and pokers, appeared with weapons in their hands to second their determinate counte∣nances; and being joined by some of the French guards, more completely accoutred, forced those foreign mercenaries, who had first awakened their fury, to retreat, fleeing like the beasts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="117" REF="029916_0128_0FE30A6630DED188"/>
the desert, before the bold and generous lion. Though victorious in this midnight fray, because determined to conquer, still they had scarcely any fire arms; and were as inexpert in the use of those they found, as the inhabitants of capitals commonly are.—But indignation made each of them (so restless was their courage) seize some∣thing to defend himself with: hammers, axes, shovels, pikes, all were sought for, and clenched in hands nerved by heroism; yes, by true heroism, for personal safety was disregarded in the com∣mon danger. Wives assisted to beat out pikes for their husbands, and children ran about to pile up stones in readiness for to-morrow. To increase the apprehensions of the night, one of the barriers was set on fire; and a band of desperate robbers, taking advantage of the confusion, began to pil∣lage some houses. To arms! was the cry of danger, and the watch-word of the city—for who could close their eyes? Whilst the tocsin drown∣ing the murmurs of rage, and distress, made the confusion solemn.</P>
<P>Different sounds excited different emotions at Versailles; for there the heart, beating high with exultation, gave way to the most intem∣perate joy.—Already the courtiers imagined, that the whole mischief was crushed, and that they had the assembly at their mercy.</P>
<P>Intoxicated by success, a little too soon reckon∣ed on, the queen, the count d'Artois, and their favourites, visited the haunt of the bribed ruffians, who were lurking in ambush, ready to fall upon their prey; encouraging them by an engaging affability of behaviour, and more substantial marks of favour, to forget every consideration
<PB N="118" REF="029916_0129_0FE30A9BA8B11188"/>
but their commands. And so flattered were they by the honied words, and coquetish smiles of the queen, that they promised, as they drained the cup in her honour, not to sheath their swords, till France was compelled to obedience, and the national assembly dispersed. With savage fero∣city they danced to the sound of music attuned to slaughter, whilst plans of death and devastation gave the zest to the orgies, that worked up their animal spirits to the highest pitch. After this account, any reflections on the baneful effects of power, or on the unrestrained indulgence of pleasure, that could thus banish tenderness from the female bosom, and harden the human heart, would be an insult to the reader's sensibility.</P>
<P>How silent is now Versailles!—The solitary foot, that mounts the sumptuous stair-case, rests on each landing-place, whilst the eye traverses the void, almost expecting to see the strong images of fancy burst into life.—The train of the Louises, like the posterity of the Banquoes, pass in solemn sadness, pointing at the nothingness of grandeur, fading away on the cold canvass, which covers the nakedness of the spacious walls —whilst the gloominess of the atmosphere gives a deeper shade to the gigantic figures, that seem to be sinking into the embraces of death.</P>
<P>Warily entering the endless apartments, half shut up, the fleeting shadow of the pensive wanderer, reflected in long glasses, that vainly gleam in every direction, slacken the nerves, without appalling the heart; though lascivious pictures, in which grace varnishes voluptuousness, no longer seductive, strike continually home to the bosom the melancholy moral, that anticipates
<PB N="119" REF="029916_0130_0FE30A67B6C397A0"/>
the frozen lesson of experience. The very air is chill, seeming to clog the breath; and the wast∣ing dampness of destruction appears to be stealing into the vast pile, on every side.</P>
<P>The oppressed heart seeks for relief in the garden; but even there the same images glide along the wide neglected walks—all is fearfully still; and, if a little rill creeping through the gathering moss down the cascade, over which it used to rush, bring to mind the description of the grand water-works, it is only to excite a languid smile at the futile attempt to equal nature.</P>
<P>Lo! this was the palace of the great king!— the abode of magnificence! Who has broken the charm?—Why does it now inspire only pity?— Why;—because nature, smiling around, presents to the imagination materials to build farms, and hospitable mansions, where without raising idle admiration, that gladness will reign, which opens the heart to benevolence, and that industry, which renders innocent pleasure sweet.</P>
<P>Weeping—scarcely conscious that I weep, O France! over the vestiges of thy former op∣pression; which, separating man from man with a fence of iron, sophisticated all, and made many completely wretched; I tremble, lest I should meet some unfortunate being, fleeing from the despotism of licentious freedom, hear∣ing the snap of the <HI>guillotine</HI> at his heels; merely because he was once noble, or has afforded an asylum to those, whose only crime is their name —and, if my pen almost bound with eagerness to record the day, that levelled the Bastile with the dust, making the towers of despair tremble

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Preparations of the Parisians for the defence of the city. The guards and city watch, join the citizens. The armed citizens appoint a commander in chief. Con∣duct of the national assembly during the disturbances at Paris. They publish a declaration of rights,—and offer their mediation with the citizens,—which is haughtily refused by the king. Proceedings at Paris on the fourteenth of July. Taking of the Bastile. The mayor shot. Proceedings of the national assembly at Versailles. Appearance of the king in the assembly. His speech.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>EARLY in the morning of the 13th, the electors hastened to the centre of the general alarm, the <HI>Hôtel-de-ville,</HI> and, urged by the ne∣cessity of the moment, passed the decrees, under deliberation, for the immediate embodying the <HI>garde-bourgeoise,</HI> without waiting for the requested sanction of the national assembly. The greater number then withdrew, to convoke their districts; whilst the few that remained endeavoured to calm the tumult that was every moment augmenting, by informing the people of this decree; repre∣senting at the same time, to the citizens, the cogent motives which should induce them to separate, and each repair to his own district to be enrolled. But the crowd again called for arms, pretending, that there was a great number concealed in an arsenal, which nobody could point out. To quiet these clamours for a moment, the people
<PB N="122" REF="029916_0133_0FE309F99F46C660"/>
were referred to the <HI>prévot des marchands</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mayor.</NOTE>. He accordingly came and requested, that the multi∣tude would confirm his nomination to the func∣tion, which his majesty had confided to him. A general acclamation was the signal of their con∣sent; and the assembled electors immediately turned their attention to the serious business before them.</P>
<P>They then established a <HI>permanent committee,</HI> to keep up a constant intercourse with the differ∣ent districts, to which the citizens were again exhorted instantly to return, with all the arms they had collected; that those arms might be properly distributed among the Parisian militia. But it was impossible to pursue these important deliberations, with any degree of order, for a fresh multitude was continually rushing forward, to report fresh intelligence; often false or exag∣gerated, and always alarming. The barriers, they were told, were on fire; a religious house had been pillaged; and a hostile force was on the road, in full march, to fall upon the citizens. An immense number of coaches, waggons, and other carriages were actually brought to the door of the hotel; and the demands of the con∣course, who had been stopped going out of Paris, mingling with the cries of the multitude, eager to be led towards the troops, whose approach had been announced, were only drowned by the more lively instances of the deputies of the sixty districts, demanding arms and ammunition, to render them active. To appease them, and gain time, the mayor promised, if they would be
<PB N="123" REF="029916_0134_0FE30A1C29003740"/>
tranquil till five o'clock in the evening, then to distribute a number of fusils; which were to be furnished by the director of a manufactory.</P>
<P>These assurances produced a degree of calm. Taking advantage of it, the committee deter∣mined that the Parisian militia, for the present, should consist of 48,000 citizens; and that the officers should be named by each district. Many subordinate decrees also passed, all tending to prevent the disasters naturally produced by con∣fusion; and to provide for the subsistence of the city. The French guards, who had during the night assisted the citizens, now came to testify their attachment to the common cause; and to beg to be enrolled with them. The commander of the city watch, a military body, likewise pre∣sented himself; to assure the committee, that the troops under his direction were disposed to obey their orders and assist in defending the city.</P>
<P>Among the carriages stopped was one of the prince de Lambesc. The people imagined, that they had caught the prince himself; and, when they were convinced of their mistake,, it was impossible to save the coach, though the horses were put into a neighbouring stable; and the portmanteau, carefully detached, was lodged in the hall. This trivial circumstance is worthy of notice, because it shows the respect then paid to property; and that the public mind was entirely fixed on those grand objects, which absorb pri∣vate passions and interests. Stung also to the quick by the insulting disregard of their claims, the people forcibly felt an indignant sense of in∣justice, which rendered the struggle heroic.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="029916_0135_0FE30A9F40B9F578"/>Preparations of a warlike cast were made du∣ring the whole course of this day; and every thing was conducted with a degree of prudence scarcely to have been expected from such impe∣tuosity. Trenches were thrown up, several of the streets unpaved, and barricadoes formed in the suburos—Defence was the sole object of every person's thoughts, and deriding personal danger, all were preparing to fell their lives at a dear rate, furbishing up old weapons, or forging new. The old men, women, and children, were em∣ployed in making pikes; whilst the able bodied men paraded the streets, in an orderly manner, with most resolute looks, yet avoiding every kind of violence: there was, in fact, an in∣conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vable solemnity in the quick step of a tor∣rent of men, all directing their exertions to one point, which distinguished this rising of the citizens from what is commonly termed a riot.—Equality, indeed, was then first establish∣ed by an universal sympathy; and men of all ranks joined in the throng, those of the first could not be discriminated by any peculiar decen∣cy of demeanour: such public spirited dignity per∣vaded the whole mass.</P>
<P>A quantity of powder had been carried to the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> which the populace, for the most unruly always collected round this central spot, would probably have blown up in seizing, if a courageous elector<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This man, the Abbé Lefebure, remained all might, and the greater part of the next day, standing over a barrel of gun-powder, persisting to keep off the people, with u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted courage, though several of them, to tor∣ment him, brought pipes to smoke near it; and one ac∣tually fired a pistol close by, that set fire to his hair.</NOTE> had not, at the risk of his
<PB N="125" REF="029916_0136_0FE2A25B11C2F770"/>
life, insisted on distributing it regularly to the people. This engaged their attention a short time; but in the evening the demand for arms became more pressing than ever, mingled with a hoarse cry of perfidy and treason, levelled against the mayor; which for a while, was silenced by the arrival of a number of military chests, thought to contain arms, and these were supposed to be those promised by the mayor. Every possible precaution was immediately taken by the electors, to have them speedily conveyed into the cellar, that they might be given to those who knew best how to make use of them; in∣stead of being caught up by the unskilful. The French guards had merited the confidence of the citizens; and four members of the committe, after some deliberation, were appointed to hasten to them, to request that they would come and take charge of the distribution. In short, great preparations were made, previous to the opening of the chests; but—when the chests were at last opened, in the presence of a concourse of people, and found to contain only pieces of old candle∣sticks, and such like rubbish, the impatience of the multitude, whose courage and patriotism had been played with all day, instantly changed into indignation and fury; and the suspicion of treason on the part of the mayor was extended to the whole committee, whom they threatened to blow up in their hall.</P>
<P>One of the electors, the marquis de la Salle, now observed,
<Q>that the greatest inconvenience
<PB N="126" REF="029916_0137_0FE30AA0C61C29C8"/>
in their present cruel situation was the want of order, and subordination; and that a cor∣respondence of the different parts of the grand machine, so necessary to promote expedition and success, could not subsist without a com∣mander known and acknowledged by the public: for all the citizens, become soldiers, are perpe∣tually,</Q>
he adds,
<Q>exposed to spend their zeal and intrepidity in superfluous efforts; sometimes even counteracting their own designs. It is neces∣sary then to name a general of the first abili∣ties and experience; I am far from thinking myself worthy of your choice, though I offer all that I can offer, my fortune and my life; and shall willingly serve in any post.</Q>
This motion produced a new discussion; and the duke d'Aumont was appointed commander in chief. But, he half declining it, though he tried to pro∣crastinate his refusal, the post devolved to the marquis de la Salle, who had been unanimously named second; and he entered immediately on the discharge of this important trust. And this nomination contributed to support the exertions of the committee; for in spite of the chaotic shock, which seemed to have thrown into con∣fusion all the parts of this great city, the centre of union formed at the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> by the assembling of the electors, was in a great mea∣sure the salvation of the public. This municipal power, created by circumstances, and tacitly con∣sented to by the citizens, established a great de∣gree of order and obedience, even in the midst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> terror ana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. The <HI>garde-bourgeoise</HI> had been assemble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the districts: and the pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relieved with the greatest exactness. The
<PB N="127" REF="029916_0138_0FE30A7360B824F8"/>
streets were illuminated, to prevent confusion or dismay during the night; private property was respected, and all the posts carefully superin∣tended; but, at the barriers, every carriage and every person was stopped, and obliged to go to the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville</HI> to give an account of them∣selves. The public particularly mistrusted the design of those who were going to Versailles, or coming from it. Deputations had been regu∣larly sent, to inform the national assembly of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disturbances, which their danger and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of a siege had occasioned in Paris, and of the measures pursued to restrain the headlong fury of the people.</P>
<P>The national assembly, indeed, now appeared with the dignified aspect becoming the fathers of their country; seeing their own danger, with∣out timidly shrinking from the line of conduct, which had provoked the violence of the court: and the president, an old man, not being thought equal to the present toils of office, a vice-president was appointed.</P>
<P>To fill this post, the marquis la Fayette was chosen: a deputy for several reasons popular. In America, where he voluntarily risked his life and fortune, before the French nation es∣poused their cause, he had acquired certain just principles of government; and these he digested to the extent of his understanding, which was somewhat confined. He possessed great integri∣ty of heart, though he was not without his por∣tion of the national vanity. He had already distinguished himself at the meeting of the no∣tables, by detecting, and exposing the pecula∣tion of Calonne, and opposing the arbitrary pro∣ceedings
<PB N="128" REF="029916_0139_0FE30A01177FA3E8"/>
of the count d'Artois. Governed by the same motives, he had proposed, likewise, during their sittings, some bold plans of re∣form, calculated to reduce the public revenue, and lessen the grievances of the nation, at the same stroke.—Amongst these was a motion for the abolition of the Bastile, and other state pri∣sons, throughout the kingdom; and the suppres∣sion of <HI>lettres de cachet.</HI> And still having the same objects in view, he, the very day the king's sneering reply was received (the 11th), laid be∣fore the assembly a proposal for a DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, similar to that of some of the Ame∣rican states. The marquis de Condorcet had published a declaration of this kind, to instruct the deputies, previous to their meeting. La Fayette had transmitted a copy of his declara∣tion of rights to the assembled electors, to be read to the people; and nothing could be better adapted to keep them firm, telling them to what point they ought to adhere, than the short address with which it commenced.—
<Q>Call to mind the sentiments, that nature has engraven on the heart of every citizen; and which take a new force, when recognized by all.—For a nation to love liberty, it is sufficient that she knows it; and, to be free, it is sufficient that she wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lally Tolendal said of La Fayette, at this time, that he spoke of liberty as he had defended it.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Mirabeau, even whilst supporting tenaciously the dignity of the national assembly, felt a pang of envy, that another should bring forward such an important business, as the sketch of a new constitution; avowedly that the world
<PB N="129" REF="029916_0140_0FE30A32882C3578"/>
might know how they had been employed, and what they were contesting for, should they be∣come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e victims of their magnanimity.</P>
<P>It was impossible now for the whole assem∣bly not to see in the change of the ministry the danger at hand, the approach of which some had affected to treat as a chimera. Determined, however, to continue their labours, in the very face of such hostile preparations; yet taking every prudent precaution to secure their safety, they sent to inform the king of the disturbances at Paris; and to point out the evils which me∣naced the state, if the troops that invested the metropolis were not sent to more distant quar∣ters:—offering, at the same time, to throw themselves between the army and the citizens, to endeavour to ward off the calamities that were likely to ensue. But the king, obstinately bent to support the present measures, or controlled by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cabal, replied
<Q>that he was the only judge of the necessity of withdrawing the troops;</Q>
and, treating the offered interposition of the de∣puties with the most ineffable contempt, told them,
<Q>that they could be of no use at Paris, and were necessary at Versailles, to pursue those important labours, which he should continue to recommend.</Q></P>
<P>This answer was no sooner communicated, than La Fayette moved, that the present ministry should be declared responsible for the consequence of their obstinacy: and the assembly further de∣creed, that Necker and the rest of the ministry, who had been just sent away, carried with them their esteem and regret:—that, alarmed by the apprehensions of danger produced by the reply of
<PB N="130" REF="029916_0141_0FE309E004FECF00"/>
the king, they would not cease to insist on the re∣moval of the troops, and the establishment of a <HI>garde-bourgeoise.</HI>—They repeated their declaration, that no intermediate power can subsist between the king and the national assembly:—and that the public debt having been placed under the safe∣guard of French honour, the nation not refusing to pay the interest of it, no power had a right to utter the infamous word—bankruptcy.—In short, the assembly declared, that they persisted in their former decrees:—and that the present resolves should be presented to the king, by the president, and printed for the information of the public.</P>
<P>Still the court, despising the courageous re∣monstrances of the assembly, and untouched by the apprehensions of the people, which seemed to be driving them to the desperation that al∣ways conquers, stimulated the king to persist in the prosecution of the measures, which they had prevailed on him to adopt. The assembly, thus rendered vigilant by the various tokens that the crisis was arrived, which was to de∣termine their personal and political fate, in which that of their country was involved, thought it prudent to make their sittings permanent. Animated and united by the common danger, they reminded each other,
<Q>that, should they perish, their country still surviving would re∣cover it's vigour; and that their plans for the good of the public again warming the hearts of Frenchmen, a brave, and generous people would erect on their tomb, as an im∣mortal trophy, a constitution solid as reason, and durable as time:—whilst their martyr∣dom would serve as an example, to prove
<PB N="131" REF="029916_0142_0FE309E6396AE5F8"/>
that the progress of knowledge and civilization is not to be stopped by the massacre of a few individuals.</Q></P>
<P>Whatever might have been the object of the cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, respecting the national assembly, which was probably the slaughter or imprisonment ne∣cessary to disperse them, and disconcert their theories of reform, it is certain, that their situ∣ation wore the most threatening aspect; and their escape was owing to the courage and re∣solution of the people; for the breast of the cabinet was too callous, to feel either repect or repugnance, when emoluments and prerogatives were in question.</P>
<P>It was a circumstance favourable to the peo∣ple, and the cause of humanity, that the want of common foresight in the court prevented their guarding against resistance. For so negligent were they, that the citizens, who were early in the morning of the 14th every where scouring about in search of arms, requested of the com∣mittee an order to demand those they heard were stored up at the <HI>hôtel des invalides;</HI> and one of the electors was accordingly sent with them, to desire the governor to give up to the nation all the arms and ammunition committed to his care. He replied, that a body of citizens having already been with him, he had sent to Versailles for orders, and entreated them to wait till the return of the courier, whom he expected in the course of an hour or two. This answer at first satisfied the people, who were preparing to wait contentedly, till one of them observing, that this was not a day to lose time, they insisted on en∣tering immediately; and instantly made them∣selves
<PB N="132" REF="029916_0143_0FE30A2839A00788"/>
masters of all the arms they found, to the amount of 30,000 muskets, and six pieces of cannon. A considerable quantity of different sorts of arms were also carried away from the <HI>garde meuble</HI> by a less orderly party; and fell into the hands of vagabonds, who always mix in a tumult, merely because it is a tumult. A hun∣dred and fifty persons of this description had been disarmed the preceding night at the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> where they had dropped asleep on the stairs and benches, stupified by the brandy they had stolen: but, when they awoke, and requested work, not having any money or bread, they were sent to assist in the making of pikes, and the fabricating of other weapons, which requir∣ed little skill. None of the citizens appeared, in fact, without some weapon, however uncouth, to brandish defiance, whilst sixty thousand men, enrolled and distributed in different companies, were armed in a more orderly, though not in a more warlike manner. The army of liberty now, indeed, assumed a very formidable appearance; yet the cabinet, never doubting of success, ne∣glected in the thoughtlessness of security, the only way left to oblige the roused people to accept of any terms.</P>
<P>Paris, that immense city, second, perhaps, to none in the world, had felt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>city of bread for some time, and now had not sufficient flour to support the inhabitants four days to come<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The supplying of Paris with provision always depend∣ed on a nice arrangement of circumstances, capable of being controlled by the government of the state. It is not like London, and other great cities, the local position of which was previously pointed out by nature, and of which the welfare depends on the great and perpetual movements of commerce, which they themselves regu∣late. To cut off the provision from London, you must block up the port, and interdict in an open manner an intercourse, on which the wealth of the nation in a great measure depends. Paris, on the contrary, might be fa∣mished in a few days by a secret order of the court. All the people of the place would feel the effect, and no per∣son be able to ascertain the cause. These considerations render it easy to account for the continued scarcity of pro∣vision in Paris during the summer of 1789. No person can doubt, but the court viewed the revolution with horror; and that, among the measures which they took to prevent it, they would not overlook so obvious an ex∣pedient, as that of cutting off the supplies from the capi∣tal; as they supposed the people would lay the blame on the new order of things, and thus be disgusted with he revolution.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="029916_0144_0FE309EF84BEC860"/>If, therefore, the mareschal Broglio had cut off the supplies, the citizens would have been reduced to the alternative of starving, or march∣ing in confusion to fight his army, before they could have been disciplined for a regular action. But directed only by the depraved sentiments of tyranny, they deemed assassination the most speedy method of bringing the contest to an end favour∣able to their designs. Unaccustomed to govern freemen, they dreamt not of the energy of a na∣tion shaking off it's fetters; or, if their classical reveries had taught them a respect for a man, whilst reading the account of that brave hand∣ful of Spartans, who drove back, at the straits of Thermopylae, millions of marshalled slaves; they had no conception, that the cause of liberty was still the same, and that men obeying her im∣pulse will always be able to resist the attacks of all the enervated mercenaries of the globe.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="029916_0145_0FE30A1F3007D278"/>The imagination of the Parisians, full of plots, created hourly many of the objects of ter∣ror from which they started; though the troops being in motion around Paris naturally produced many false alarms, that their suspicious tem∣per might have exaggerated sufficiently, without the help of invention. Various accounts of mas∣sacres and assassinations were consequently brought to the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> which inflamed the people, though afterwards they proved to be the idle ru∣mours of fear. Thus much, however, appeared certain; a squadron of hussars had actually been seen hovering about the entrance of the <HI>fauxbourg Saint-Antoine,</HI> who disappeared when two com∣panies of the French guards approached. The people of the same fauxbourg observed also, that the cannons of the Bastile were turned towards their street. On receiving this information, a mes∣sage was sent from the committee to the governor of the Bastile, to expostulate with him; and one to each of the districts, desiring them to sound an alarm throughout, to break up the pavement of the streets, dig ditches, and oppose every obstacle, in their power, to the entrance of the troops. But though the accounts of the hostile de∣meanour of some of the detachments in the skirts of Paris excited terror, there was still reason to doubt the real disposition of the sol∣diery; for a considerable number, belonging to different regiments, had presented themselves at the barriers with arms and baggage, declared their decided intention to enter into the service of the nation. They were received by the districts, and conducted to the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville:</HI> and the committee distributed them amongst the national
<PB N="135" REF="029916_0146_0FE30AA9B1275408"/>
troops, with the precaution necessary to guard against the surprise of treason.</P>
<P>The deputation sent to the Bastile, now re∣turned, to give an account of their mission. They informed the committee, that the people, render∣ed furious by the menacing position of the can∣non, had already surrounded the walls; but that they had entered without much difficulty, and were conducted to the governor, whom they had requested to change the disposition of his cannons; and that the reply he gave was not as explicit as they could have wished. They then demanded to pass into the second court, and did not without great difficulty obtain permission. The little drawbridge, they continued, was let down; but the great one, which led to this court-yard was raised, and they entered by an iron gate, opened at the call of the governor. In this court they had seen three cannons ready for action, with two cannoneers, thirty-six Swiss, and a dozen of invalids, all under arms; and the staff officers were also assembled.—They immediately summoned them, in the name of the honour of the nation, and for the sake of their country, to change the direction of the cannons; and at the instance even of the governor himself, all the officers and soldiers swore, that the cannons should not be fired, nor would they make any use of their arms, unless they were attacked. In short, another deputation from one of the districts had likewise been received with great politeness by the governor; and while they were taking some refreshment, he had actually ordered the cannons to be drawn back; and a moment
<PB N="136" REF="029916_0147_0FE30AF006475878"/>
after they were informed, that the order was obeyed.</P>
<P>To calm the people, these very men descended the stair-case of the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> to proclaim the assurances they had received of the amicable intentions of the governor; but, whilst the trumpet was sounding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> demand silence, the re∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of a cannon from the quarter of the Bastile was heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and at the same moment, an immense cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d precipitated themselves into the square, fronting the hotel, with the cry of treason. And to support the charge, they brought with them a citizen, and a soldier of the French guards, both wounded. The rumour was, that fifteen or twenty more, wounded at the same time, were left to be taken care of, in different houses on the way; for that the governor, Delaunay, had let down the first draw-bridge to engage the people to approach, who were demanding arms; and that they, entering with confidence on this invita∣tion, had immediately received a discharge of all the musketry of the fortress. This report, con∣firmed by the presence of the two wounded men, demonstrated to the committee the perfidy of the troops who guarded the Bastile, and the necessity of sending succour to those, who, without order or sufficient force, had commenced the attack. Mean time the fury of the people was directed against the mayor, who endeavoured by various subterfuges to appease the rage which had been excited by his vain promises of procuring arms. He had, it is true, several times dispersed the multitude by sending them to different places with orders for arms, where he knew they were not
<PB N="137" REF="029916_0148_0FE30AAB86C9E270"/>
to be found; and now, to silence the suspicions that threatened to break out in some dreadful acts of violence, involving the whole committee in the same destruction, he offered to make one of the third deputation; the second appearing to be detained, to remonstrate with Delaunay, and try to prevent an effusion of blood. A drum and colours were ordered to attend them, because it was supposed, that the want of some signal had prevented the others from executing their com∣mission.</P>
<P>Shortly after their departure, however, the second deputation returned, and informed the committee, that, in their way to the Bastile, they had met a wounded citizen, carried by his companions, who informed them, that he had received a shot from a fusil, fired from the Bastile into the street St. Antoine; and that immediately after they had been stopped by a crowd, who were guarding three invalids, taken firing on their fellow citizens. Judging by these events, added they, that the danger was in∣creasing, we hastened our steps, animated by the hope of putting a stop to such an unequal com∣bat. Arrived within an hundred paces of the fortress, we perceived the soldiers on the towers firing upon the street St. Antoine, and we heard the report of the guns of the citizens in the court, discharged on the garrison. Drawing nearer, we made several signals to the governor, which were either unobserved, or disregarded. We then approached the gate, and saw the people, almost all without any thing to defend themselves, rushing forward exposed to the brisk fire of artillery, that hailed directly down upon them,
<PB N="138" REF="029916_0149_0FE30A12197FDCD0"/>
making great havoc. We prevailed on those who had arms, to stop firing for a moment, whilst we reiterated our signal of peace; but the garrison, regardless of it, continued their dis∣charges, and we had the grief to see fall, by our sides, several of the people, whose hands we had stopped. The courage of the rest, again in flamed by indignation, pushed them forward.—Our re∣monstrances, our prayers, had no longer any effect; and they declared, that it was not a deputation they now wished for.—It was the siege of the Bastile—the destruction of that hor∣rible prison—the death of the governor, that they demanded, with loud cries. Repulsed by these brave citizens, we p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtook their momentary indignation, so fully justified by the abominable act of perfidy, with which they charged the governor.—They then repeated the information which has already reached you—that in the morning a crowd having approached the Bastile to demand arms, the governor had allowed a certain number to enter, and then had fired upon them. Thus the treason of the governor had been the first signal of a war, that he himself had begun with his fellow citizens, and seemed willing to continue obstinately, since he refused to attend to the deputation. Through all parts it was now resounded.—'Let us take the Bastile!' —And five pieces of cannon, conducted by this cry, were hastening to the action.</P>
<P>Some time after, the third deputation also came back, and recounted, that, at the sight of their white flag, one had been hoisted on the top of the Bastile, and the soldiers had grounded their arms;—that under the auspices of these ensigns
<PB N="139" REF="029916_0150_0FE30AAD0B35B0A0"/>
of peace, the deputies had engaged the people, in the name of the permanent committee, to re∣tire to their districts, and take the measures the most proper to re-establish tranquility—and, that this retreat was actually taking place; the peo∣ple all naturally passing through the court where the deputation remained.—When, notwithstand∣ing the white emblem of a pacific disposition, displayed on the tower, the deputies saw a piece of cannon planted directly at the court, and they received a sudden discharge of musketry, which killed three persons at their feet—that this atro∣city, at the moment they were calming the people, had thrown them into a transport of rage; and many of them had even held their bayonets at the breasts of the deputies; saying,
<Q>you are also traitors, and have brought us here that we might be more easily killed</Q>
—and it would have been difficult to calm them, if one of the deputies had not bid them observe, that they shared the same danger. The effervescence then abating, they hastened back and met 300 of the French guards, followed by the cannons taken at the invalids, all marching with a quick step, crying that they were going to take the Bastile. One of the deputies, who had been separated from the rest, further recited;—that having been obliged to scramble over the dead and dying to escape, the people, who recognized him as an elector, desired him to save himself—for that the treason was manifest.
<Q>It is rather you, my friends, he replied, who ought to retire; you who hinder our soldiers and cannons from entering this encumbered court, where you are all going to perish, for no purpose.</Q>
But, that
<PB N="140" REF="029916_0151_0FE30A25C57AE0B8"/>
they interrupted him in a transport, exclaiming—
<Q>No!—No! our dead bodies will serve to fill up the trench.</Q>
He therefore retired with the balls hissing about his ears. These recitals, and the rumor of the second act of treachery, spread∣ing through the city, violently agitated minds already alive to suspicion.</P>
<P>Fresh crowds continually rushed into the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> and again they threatened to set fire to it, repeating how many times the mayor had deceived them. And, when he attempted to calm them by making plausible excuses, they stopped his mouth by saying, with one voice,— 'he seeks to gain time by making us lose our's. Two intercepted billets also having been read aloud, addressed to the principal officers of the Bastile, desiring them to stand out, and promissing succour; increased the public fury, principally directed against the governor of the Bastile, the mayor, and even the permanent committee.— Outcry followed outcry, and naked arms were held up denouncing vengeance—when an old man exclaimed, my friends, what do we here with these traitors!—Let us march to the Bastile! at this cry, as at a signal of victory, all the people hastily left the hall, and the committee unex∣pectedly found themselves alone.</P>
<P>In this moment of solitude and terror, a man entered with affright visible on every feature, saying, that the square trembled with the rage of the people; and that they had devoted all of them to death.—'Depart!' he exclaimed, running out,
<Q>save yourselves while you can—or you are all lost!</Q>
But they remained still; and were not long permitted in silence to anticipate the
<PB N="141" REF="029916_0152_0FE30AAE92690728"/>
approach of danger; for one party of people following another, brought in a number of their wounded companions:—and those who brought them, described with passion the carnage of the citizens sacrificed under the ramparts of the Bastile. This carnage, the military officers attri∣buted to the disorder of the attack, and to the intrepidity of the assailants still greater than the disorder.</P>
<P>The accounts of the slaughter, nevertheless, were certainly very much exaggerated; for the fortress appears to have been taken by the force of mind of the multitude, pressing forward re∣gardless of danger. The ardor of the besiegers, rather than their numbers, threw the garrison into confusion; for the Bastile was justly reckoned the strongest and most terrific prison in Europe, or perhaps in the world. It was always guarded by a considerable number of troops, and the governor had been previously prepared for its de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce; but the unexpected impetuosity of the Parisians was such as nothing could withstand. It is cer∣tain, that Delaunay, at first, despised the attempt of the people; and was more anxious to save from injury or pillage, a small elegant house he had built in the outer court, than to avoid flaughter. Afterwards, however, in the madness of despair, he is said to have rolled down large masses of stone from the platform on the heads of the people, to have endeavoured to blow up the fortress, and even to kill himself. The French guards, it is true, who mixed with the multitude, were of essential service in storming the Bastile, by advising them to bring the cannon, and take some other measures, that only military experience
<PB N="142" REF="029916_0153_0FE309EC78C64188"/>
could have dictated; but the enthusiasm of the moment rendered a knowledge of the art of war needless; and resolution, more powerful than all the engines and batteries in the world, made the draw-bridges fall, and the walls give way.</P>
<P>Whilst then the people were carrying every thing before them, the committee only thought of preventing the further effusion of blood. Another deputation was therefore nominated, more numerous than had hitherto been sent; and they were just setting out on this errand of peace, when some voices announced, that the Bastile was taken. Little attention, however, was paid to them; and the news was so impro∣bable, that the impression made by the rumour was not sufficiently strong to stop the outrages of the mob, who were still menacing the mayor and the committee.—When a fresh uproar, heard at first at such a distance that it could not be dis∣tinguished, whether it was a cry of victory or of alarm, advancing with the crash and rapidity of a tempest, came to confirm the unlooked for intel∣ligence.—For the Bastile was taken!</P>
<P>At the instant even the great hall was inundated by a crowd of all ranks, carrying arms of every kind.—The tumult was inexpressible—and to increase it, some one called out, that the hotel was giving way, under the mingled shout of vic∣tory and treason! vengeance and liberty!—About thirty invalids and Swiss soldiers were then drag∣ged into the hall, whose death the multitude imperiously demanded.—Hang them! Hang them! was the universal roar.</P>
<P>An officer of the queen's regiment of guards (M. Elie) was brought in on the shoulders of the
<PB N="143" REF="029916_0154_0FE30AB67B868A68"/>
conquerors of the Bastile, and proclaimed by them, as the first of the citizens, who had just made themselves masters of it. The efforts he used to repress the testimonies of honour, which were lavished on him, were of no avail; and he was placed, in spite of his modesty, on a table opposite the committee, and surrounded by the prisoners, who seemed to be standing in fearful expectation of their doom. In this situation he was crowned, and trophies of arms awkwardly placed around, to which sentiment and circum∣stances gave dignity. All the plate taken at the Bastile was brought to him, and his comrades pressed him, in the most earnest manner, to accept it, as the richest spoil of the vanquished enemy. But he refused with firmness, explaining the motives of his refusal so eloquently, he persuaded all who heard him, that the spoil did not belong to them; and that patriotism, jealous only of glory and honour, would blush at receiving a pecuniary recompence.—And making a noble use of the ascendency which he had over the people, he began to recommend moderation and cle∣mency.—But he was soon interrupted by the account of the death of Delaunay; seized in the court of the Bastile, and dragged by the furious populace almost to the <HI>Hôtel-de-ville,</HI> before he was massacred.—And soon after the death of three other officers was reported.</P>
<P>The prisoners listened to these tales with the countenances of victims ready to be sacrificed, whilst the exasperated crowd demanded their instant execution. One of the electors spoke in their favour, but was scarcely permitted to go on. The people, indeed, were principally enraged
<PB N="144" REF="029916_0155_0FE30AF4156F59B8"/>
against three of the invalids, whom they accused of being the cannoneers, that had fired so briskly on the citizens. One of them was wounded, and consequently inspired more compassion. The marquis de la Salle placed himself before this poor wretch, and forcing, in some degree, the people to hear him, he insisted on the authority which he ought to have as commander in chief; adding, that he only wished to secure the culprits, that they might be judged with all the rigour of martial law. The people seemed to approve of his reasoning; and taking advantage of this fa∣vourable turn, he made the wounded invalid pass into another apartment.—But, whilst he was preserving the life of this unfortunate man, the mob hurried the other two out of the hall, and immediately hung them on the adjacent lamp∣post<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lamp-posts, which are only to be found in squares, and places where there are not two rows of houses, are much more substantial than in England.</NOTE>. The effervescence, nevertheless, in spite of this overflowing of fury, still continued, and was not even damped by these cruel acts of re∣taliation. Two sentiments agitated the public mind—the joy of having conquered, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desire of vengeance. Confused denunciations of treason resounded on all sides, and each individual was eager to show his sagacity in discovering a plot, or substituted suspicion instead of conviction with equal obstinacy. The mayor, however, had given sufficient proofs of his disposition to support the court, to justify the rage which was breaking out against him; and a general cry having been raised around him, that it was necessary for him
<PB N="145" REF="029916_0156_0FE30AB94E1E8468"/>
to go to the <HI>palais royal,</HI> to be tried by his fellow citizen, he agreed to accompany the people.</P>
<P>Mean time the clamour against the rest of the invalids redoubled. But the French guards, who entered in groups, requested as a recompense for the service which they had rendered to their country the pardon of their old comrades; and M. Elie joined in the request; adding, that this favour would be more grateful to his heart, than all the gifts and honours which they wished to lavish on him. Touched by his eloquence, some cried out—Pardon! and the same emotion spreading throughout the circle—Pardon! Par∣don! succeeded the ferocious demand of ven∣geance, which had hitherto stifled sympathy. And to assure their safety, M. Elie proposed making the prisoners take an oath of fidelity to the nation and the city of Paris; and this pro∣position was received with testimonies of general satisfaction. The oath being administered, the French guards surrounded the prisoners and car∣ried them away, in the midst of them, without meeting with any resistance.</P>
<P>The committee now endeavoured to re-establish something like order, for in the tumult the table had been broken down, and destruction menaced on every side—when a man entered to inform them, that an unknown, but, indeed, a merciful hand, had shot the mayor, and thus by the only possible mean snatched him from the popular fury. The whole tenor of his conduct, in fact, justified the charge brought against him, and rendered at least this effect of public indignation excusable.—So excusable, that had not the pas∣sions of the people, exasperated by designing
<PB N="146" REF="029916_0157_0FE30A0E9DB3CA50"/>
men, afterwards been directed to the commission of the most barbarous atrocities, the vengeance of this day could hardly be cited as acts of injustice or inhumanity.</P>
<P>The Bastile was taken about four o'clock in the afternoon; and after the struggle to save the prisoners, some necessary regulations were pro∣posed, to secure the public safety. The conduct of the men in office had so irritated the people, that the cry against aristocrats was now raised; and a number of persons of distinction were brought to the <HI>Hôtel-de-ville</HI> this evening, by the restless populace, who, roving abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, seemed to create some of the adventur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which were necessary to employ their awakened spirit. Breathless with victory, they, for the moment, gave a loose to joy; but the sounds of exul∣tation dying away with the day, night brought back all their former apprehensions; and they listened with fresh affright to the report, that a detachment of troops was preparing to enter one of the barriers. Not, therefore, allowing them∣selves to sleep on their conquering arms, this was, likewise, a watchful night; for the taking of the Bastile, though it was a proof the courage and resolution of the Parisians, by no means secured them against the insidious schemes of the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> They had shown their determination to resist oppression very forcibly; but the troops that ex∣cited their resistance were still apparently waiting for an opportunity to destroy them. Every citizen then hurried to his post, for their very success made them the more alive to fear. The <HI>tocsin</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s again rung, and the cannon that had forced th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bastile to surrender dragged hastily to the
<PB N="147" REF="029916_0158_0FE30ABAD1729168"/>
place of alarm. The pavement of the adjacent streets was torn up with astonishing quickness, and carried to the tops of the houses; where the women who were equally animated, stood prepared to hurl them down on the soldiers.— All Paris, in short, was awake; and this vigilance either frustrated the designs of the cabal, or in∣timidated the hostile force, which never appeared to have entered with earnestness into its measures. For it is probable, that some decisive stroke had been concerted; but that the officers, who ex∣pected by their presence only to have terrified into obedience the citizens, whose courage, on the contrary, they roused, were rendered irre∣solute by the disaffection of the soldiers. Thus was the nation saved by the almost incredible exertion of an indignant people; who felt, for the first time, that they were sovereign, and that their power was commensurate to their will. This was certainly a splendid example, to prove, that nothing can resist a people determined to live free; and then it appeared clear, that the freedom of France did not depend on a few men, whatev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r might be their virtues or abilities, but a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one on the will of the nation.</P>
<P>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g this day, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Parisians were so active <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its safety, the national assembly was employed in forming a committee, to be charged with digesting the plan of a constitution, for the deliberation of the whole body: to secure the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights of the people on the eternal principles of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and justice; and thereby to guarantee the national dignity and respectability. Towards the evening, the uncertainty of what was passing at Paris, the mysterious conduct of the cabinet, the
<PB N="148" REF="029916_0159_0FE30AF597623C90"/>
presence of the troops at Versailles, the substan∣tiated facts, and the suspected proscriptions, gave to this sitting the involuntary emotions, that must naturally be produced by the approach of a ca∣tastrophe, which was to decide the salvation or destruction of the state. Mirabeau, firm to his point, shewed the necessity of insisting on the sending away the troops without delay; and soon after the viscount de Noailles, arriving from Paris, informed them, that the arms had been taken from the <HI>Hôtel-des-invalides;</HI> and that the Bastile was actually besieged. The first impulse was for them to go altogether, and endeavour to open the king's eyes; but, after some reflection, a numerous deputation was nominated;—to insist on the removal of the troops; and to speak to his majesty with that energetic frankness, so much more necessary as he was deceived by every per∣son by whom he was surrounded. Whilst they were absent, two persons, sent by the electors of Paris informed the assembly of the taking of the Bastile, and the other events of the day; which were repeated to them, when they returned with the king's vague answer.</P>
<P>A second deputation was then immediately sent, to inform him of these circumstances:—To which he replied—
<Q>You more and more distress my heart, by the recitals you bring me of the mise∣ries of Paris. But I cannot believe, that the orders which I have given to the troops, is the cause of them: I have, therefore, nothing to add to the answer that you have already re∣ceived from me.</Q></P>
<P>This reply tended to increase the general alarm; and they determined again to prolong the sitting
<PB N="149" REF="029916_0160_0FE30ABC56BE4BD0"/>
all night; either to be ready to receive the enemy in their sacred function, or to make a last effort near the throne to succour the metropolis. No∣thing could surpass the anxious suspense of this situation; for the most resolute of the deputies were uneasy respecting their fate, because their personal safety was connected with the salvation of France. Their nocturnal conversation na∣turally turned on the late events that had taken place at Paris; the commotions in the provinces; and the horrors of famine, ready to consume those whom a civil war spared. The old men sought for an hour of repose upon the tables and carpets; the sick rested on the benches.—All saw the sword suspended over them, and over their country—and all feared a morrow still more dreadful.</P>
<P>Impressed by their situation, and the danger of the state. one of the deputies (the duke de Lian∣court) left his post and sought a private audience with the king, with whom he warmly expostulated, pointing out the critical situation of the kingdom; and even of the royal family, should his majesty persist to support the present measures. Monsieur, the king's eldest brother, and not only the most honest, but the most sensible of the blood royal, immediately coincided with the duke, silencing the rest of the cabal. They had at first treated with contempt the intelligence received of the Bastile's b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing taken; and now were so stunned by the confirmation, that, at a loss how to direct the king, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him to follow the counsel of whoever dared to advise him — And he, either convinced, or persuaded, deter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned to extricate
<PB N="150" REF="029916_0161_0FE30A29C3F71B30"/>
himself out of the present difficulties, by yielding to necessity.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 15th, the national assembly, not informed of this circumstance, resolved to send another remonstrance to the king;—and Mirabeau, giving a sketch of the address, drew a rapid and lively picture of the exigencies of the moment. 'Tell him,' said he,
<Q>that the hordes of foreigners, by whom we are besieged, have yesterday been visited by the princes and princesses, their favourites, and their minions, who, lavishing on them caresses and presents, exhorted them to perseverance— tell him, that the whole night these foreign sa∣tellites, gorged with gold and wine, have, in their impious camp, predicted the subjugation of France, and that they invoked, with brutal vehemence, the destruction of the national as∣sembly—tell him, that, even in his own palace, the courtiers have mingled in the dance to the sound of this barbarous music—and, tell him, that such was the scene, which announced St. Bartholomew.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Tell, him, that the Henry, whose memory the world blesses, the ancestor, whom he ought to wish to take for a model, allowed provision to pass into Paris in a state of revolt, when he was in person besieging it; whilst his ferocious counsellors are turning back the flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, that the course of commerce was bringing to his faith∣ful and famished city.</Q></P>
<P>The deputation left the hall; but was stopped by the duke de Liancourt; who informed them, that that the king was then coming to restore
<PB N="151" REF="029916_0162_0FE30AC951303520"/>
them to tranquillity and peace. Every heart was relieved by this intelligence; and a cynic, proba∣bly, would have found less dignity in the joy, than the grief of the assembly. A deputy, how∣ever, moderated these first emotions, by observ∣ing, that those transports formed a shocking con∣trast with the distress which the people had already endured.—He added,
<Q>that a respectful silence was the proper reception of a monarch during a moment of public sorrow: for the silence of the people is the only lesson of kings.</Q></P>
<P>Shortly after, the king appeared in the assem∣bly, standing uncovered; and without any at∣tention to ceremony. He addressed the repre∣sentatives of the people with artful affection: for as it is impossible to avoid comparing his present affectionate style, with the cold contempt with which he answered their repeated remonstrances the preceding evening, it is not judging harshly to despise the affectation, and to suggest, that it was dictated rather by selfish prudence than by a sense of justice, or a feeling of humanity. He lamented the disorder that reigned in the capital, and requested them to think of some method to bring back order and tranquillity. He alluded to the report, that the personal safety of the deputies had been menaced; and, with contempti∣ble duplicity asked, if his well-known character did not give the lie to such a rumour.—Reckon∣ing then, he concluded, on the love and fidelity of his subjects, he had given orders to the troops to repair to more distant quarters—and he au∣thorized, nay, invited them, to make known his intentions to the metropolis.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="029916_0163_0FE30AFCB5F18E18"/>This speech was interrupted and followed by the most lively expression of applause; though the sagacity of a number of the deputies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not possibly have been clouded by their sympathy: and the king returning to the palace on foot, great part of the assembly escorted him, joined by a con∣course of people, who rent the air with their bene∣dictions. The declaration of Louis, that, trusting to the representatives of the people, he had ordered the troops to withdraw from Versailles, being spread abroad, every person, feeling reliev∣ed from the oppression of fear, and unshackled from the fetters of despotism, threw off care; and the national assembly immediately appoint∣ed eighty-four of it's most respectable members, to convey to Paris the glad intelligence; that the harassed Parisians might participate in the joy they had procured the assembly, by the most noble exertions.</P>
<P>Arrived at Paris they were received with en∣thusiasm, as the saviours of their country; and saw there more than a hundred thousand men in arms, formed into companies; showing the supe∣riority of a na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion rising in it's own defence, compared with the mercenary machines of tyran∣ny. The transports of the people, and the sym∣pathy of the deputies must have formed a highly interesting scene; success elevating the heart for the moment, and hope gilding the future pros∣pect.—But the imagination would languidly por∣tray this dazzling sunshine, depressed by the recollection of the sinister events, that have since clouded the bright beams. Precluded then by melancholy reflections from rejoicing with the happy throng, it is necessary to turn our attention
<PB N="153" REF="029916_0164_0FE30ACB3111B4E0"/>
to the circumstances, from which mankind may draw instruction:—and the first that present themselves to our notice are those which discon∣certed the flagitious plan of the ministry;— the regulations that preserved order in the me∣tropolis;—the astonishing reduction of the Bas∣tile;—the union of the French guards with the citizens;—the prompt establishment of a city militia;—and, in short, the behaviour of the people, who showed neither a thirst for pillage, nor a fondness for tumult.</P>
<P>The court by their criminal enterprises had entirely disordered the political machines, that sustained the old worn out government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>'In August 1778,' says Lally Tolendal,'
<Q>the laws were overturned; and twenty-five millions of men without justice or judges;—the public treasury with∣out funds, and without resource;—the sovereign autho∣rity was usurped by the ministers;—and the people without any other hope than the states-general;—yet without confidence in the promise of the king.</Q></P>
<P>And, Mounier also gives a similar sketch.
<Q>We have not a fixed or complete form of government—we have not a constitution, because all the powers are confounded —because no boundary is traced out—The judicial power is not even separated from the legislative.—Authority is dispersed; it's various parts are always in opposition; and amidst their perpetual shocks the rights of the lower class of citizens are betrayed — The laws are openly despised, or rather we are not agreed what ought to be called laws.</Q></P></NOTE>; which, worm-eaten in all it's pillars, and rotten in all it's joints, fell at the first shock—never to rise again. The destruction of the Bastile—that fortress of tyranny! which for two centuries had been the shame and terror of the metropolis <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the Bastile, it is true, were found but seven pri∣soners—Yet, it ought to be remarked, that three of them had lost their reason—that, when the secrets of the prison-house were laid open, men started with horror from the inspection of instruments of torture, that appeared to be almost worn out by the exercise of tyranny—and that ci∣tizens we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e afraid even for a moment to enter the noisome dungeons, in which their fellow-creatures had been con∣fined for years.</NOTE>, was the sentence of death of the old constitution.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="029916_0165_0FE30AFE57BC56F8"/>The junction of the three orders in fact secur∣ing the power of the national assembly, and making the court appear a cypher, could not fail to prove sorely mortifying to it's old mi∣nions; and the success of the people on the 14th of July proclaiming their supremacy, the courtiers, resorting to their old arts, suggested to the king a line of conduct the most plausible and flartering to the inconsiderate partizans of a revolution; whilst it betrayed to the more dis∣cerning a dissimulation as palpable as the mo∣tives of the advisers were flagrantly interested. For their views being narrowed by the depravity of their character, they imagined that his appa∣rent acquiescence, exciting the admiration and affection of the nation, would be the surest mode of procuring him that consequence in the go∣vernment, which ultimately might tend to over∣throw what they termed an upstart legislature: and, by the appropriation of chances, reinstate the tyranny of unlimited monarchy.</P>
<P>This serious farce commenced previous to that memorable epocha; and in marking the pro∣minent features of the events that led to the dis∣asters, which have s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lied the glory of the revo∣lution, it is impossible to keep too near in view the arts of the acting parties; and the credulity and enthusiasm of the people, who, invariably direct∣ing
<PB N="155" REF="029916_0166_0FE30ACCB5B59688"/>
their attention to the same point, have always been governed in their sentiments of men by the most popular anarchi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts. For this is the only way to form a just opinion of the various changes of men, who, supplanting each other, with such astonishing rapidity, have produced the most fatal calamities.</P>
<P>The cabinet, indeed, the better to disguise their secret machinations, made the king declare, the 23d of June, that
<Q>he annulled and dissolved all powers and restrictions, which by cramping the liberty of the deputies would hinder them either from adopting the form of deliberation by orders separately, or in common, by the distinct vioce of the three orders,</Q>
absolutely gave his sanction for constituting the national assembly one and indivisible.—And in the same declaration, article the 6th, he says,
<Q>that he will not suffer the <HI>cahiers,</HI> or mandates, to be regarded as dictatorial; for they were only to be considered as simple instructions, intrusted to the conscience and free opinion of the depu∣ties, who have been chosen.</Q>
This was giving them unbounded latitude for their actions.—This was not only a tacit consent to their proceedings; but it was granting them all his authority to frame a constitution.—It was legalizing their actions, even according to the arbitrary rules of the old despotism; and abroga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in a formal manner that imaginary authority, the sanction of which, at a former period, would have been necessary to their existence as representatives of the people.—But happily that period had passed away; and those men, who had known no rule of action paramount to the commands of their
<PB N="156" REF="029916_0167_0FE30AFFDCBDF4B8"/>
sovereign, were now sufficiently enlightened, to demand a restitution of their long-estranged rights;—and a constitution, upon which they could consolidate their liberty and national fra∣ternity.</P>
<P>This imperious demand was irresistible; and the cabinet, unable to check the current of opi∣nion, had recourse to those stratagems, which, leading to their ruin, has buried in the wreck all that vain grandeur elevated on the spoil of in∣dustry, whilst it's gilding obscured the sad objects of misery that pined under it's shade. Lively sanguine minds, disgusted with the vices and artificial manners produced by the great inequality of conditions in France, naturally hailed the dawn of a new day, when the Bastile was destroyed; and freedom, like a lion roused from his lair, rose with dignity, and calmly shook herself.— With delight they marked her noble pace, with∣out ever supposing that the tiger, who thirsts for blood, and the whole brutal herd, must necessarily unite against her.—Yet this has been the case; the dogs of war have been let loose, and corruption has swarmed with noxious life.—But let not the coldly wise exult, that their heads were not led astray by their hearts; or imagine, that the improvement of the times does not be∣token a change of government, gradually taking place to meliorate the fate of man; for in spite of the perverse conduct of beings spoiled by the old system, the preponderancy of truth has ren∣dered principles in some respects triumphant over man; and instruments of mischief have won∣dered at the good which they have unwittingly produced.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE effect produced by the duplicity of courts must be very great, when the vicissitudes which had happened at Versailles, could not teach every person of common sense, that the moment was arrived, when subterfuge and treachery could no longer escape detection and punishment; and that the only possibility of ob∣taining the durable confidence of the people was by that strict attention to justice, which produces a dignified sincerity of action. For after the unravelling of the plot, contrived to cheat the expectation of the people, it was natural to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦pose, that they would entertain the most wakeful suspicion of every person who had been p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to it.</P>
<P>It would have been fortunate for France, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the unhappy Louis, if his counsellors could have profited by experience.

of which had for a moment disconcerted the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, we shall find, that the continual dissimulation of the king, and the stratagems of his advisers, were the principal though perhaps not the sole cause of his ruin. He appears to have sometimes mistrusted the cabal; yet, with that mixture of facility and obstinacy in his character, the con∣comitants of indolence of mind, he allowed him∣self to be governed without attempting to form any principle of action to regulate his conduct. For if he had ever really desired to be useful to his people, and to lighten their accumulated burdens, as has been continually insisted, he was astonishingly defective in judgment not to see, that he was surrounded with sycophants, who fat∣tened on their hearts blood, using his own hand to brand his name with infamy. It may possibly be urged in reply, that this yielding temper was a proof of the king's benign desire to promote the felicity of his subjects, and prevent the hor∣rors of anarchy. To confute such remarks, it is only necessary to state, that the preparations which had been made to dissolve the national assembly, and to reduce the people to entire sub∣jection, if they were not his immediate contri∣vance, must have had his sanction, to give them efficiency; and that the tergiversation, which he employed on this occasion, was sufficient to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y other transaction of his reign suspected. And this will be found to be the case in all the st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps he afterwards took to conciliate the people, which were little regarded after the evaporation of the lively emotions they excited; whilst the want of morals in the court, and even in the assembly, made a prevailing mistrust produce a
<PB N="159" REF="029916_0170_0FE30AD684438998"/>
capriciousness of conduct throughout the empire. Perhaps, it is vain to expect, that a depraved nation, whatever examples of heroism, and noble instances of disinterested conduct, it may exhibit on sudden emergencies, or at the first statement of an useful reform, will ever pursue with steadi∣ness the great objects of public good, in the direct path of virtuous ambition.</P>
<P>If the calamities, however, which have follow∣ed in France the taking of the Bastile, (a noble effort,) be attributed partly to ignorance, or only to want of morals, the evils are in no degree lessened; neither does it justify the conduct of the virulent opposers of those manly exertions inspired by the voice of reason. The removal of a thousand grinding oppressions had been de∣manded;—and promised, to delude the public; who finding, at last, that the hopes, which had softened their misery, were likely to be blasted by the intrigues of courtiers, can we wonder, that the worm these courtiers were trying to crush, turned on the foot prepared to stamp it to nothing.</P>
<P>The complication of laws in every country ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tended to bewilder the understanding of man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the science of government; and whilst artful politicians have taken advantage of the ignorance or credulity of their fellow citizens, it was im∣possible to prevent a degeneracy of morals, be∣cause impunity will always be a stimulus to the passions. This has been the cause of the insin∣cerity, which has so long disgraced the courts of Europe, and pervading every class of men in their offices or employ, has extended it's poison throughout the higher orders of society; and it
<PB N="160" REF="029916_0171_0FE30A2C19708708"/>
will require a simplification of laws, an establish∣ment of equal rights, and the responsibility of ministers, to secure a just and enlightened policy. But till this be effected, it ought not to surprize us, should we hear the mock pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iots of the day declaiming about public reform, merely to answer smister purposes; or should we chance to dis∣cover, that the most extolled characters have been actuated by a miserable selfishness, or prompted by corroding resentment, to exertions for the public good; whilst historians have ignorantly attributed the political advantages, which have been attained by a gradual improvement of man∣ners, to their resolution, and the virtuous exer∣cise of their talents.</P>
<P>And we ought not to be discouraged from attempting this simplification, because no country has yet been able to do it; since it seems clear, that manners and government have been in a continual and progressive state of improvement, and that the extension of knowledge, a truth capable of demonstration, was never at any period so general as at present.</P>
<P>If at one epocha of civilization we know, that all the improvements which were made in arts and sciences were suddenly overturned, both in Greece and Rome, we need not inquire, why superficial reasoners have been induced to think, that there is only a certain degree of civilization to which men are capable of attaining, without receding back to a state of barbarism, by the horrid consequences of anarchy; though it may be necessary to observe, that the causes which pro∣duced that event can never have the same effect again:—because a degree of knowledge has been
<PB N="161" REF="029916_0172_0FE30ADA15D53008"/>
diffused through society by the invention of print∣ing, which no inundation of barbarians can era∣dicate. Besides, the improvement of governments do not now depend on the genius of particular men; but on the impetus given to the whole society by the discovery of useful truths. The opposers then of popular governments may tell us, if they please, that Themistocles had no mo∣tive in saving his country, but to gratify his ambition; that Cicero was vain, and Brutus only envious of the growing greatness of Caesar. —Or, to approach our own times;— that if the supercilious Wedderburne had not offer∣ed an indignity to Franklin, he never would have become an advocate for American indepen∣dence; and that, if, Mirabeau had not suffered in prison, he never would have written against the <HI>lettres de cachet,</HI> or espoused the cause of the people.—All of which assertions I am willing to admit, because they exactly prove what I wish to enforce; namely, that—though bad morals, and worse laws, have helped to deprave the passions of men to such a degree, as to make the benefits which society have derived from the talents or exertions of individuals to arise fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selfish considerations, still it has been in a state of gradual improvement, and has arrived at such a pitch of comparative perfection, that the most arbitrary governments in Europe, Russia excepted, begin to treat their subjects as human beings, feeling like men, and with some powers of thinking.</P>
<P>The most high degree of civilization amongst the ancients, on the contrary, seems to have con∣sisted in the perfection of the arts, including lan∣guage,
<PB N="162" REF="029916_0173_0FE30B019B164BB0"/>
attained; whilst the people, only domes∣ticated brutes, were governed and amused by religious shows, that stand on record as the most egregious insult ever offered to the human un∣derstanding. Women were in a state of bondage; though the men, who gave way to the most un∣bridled excesses, even to the outraging of nature, expected that they should be chaste; and took the only method to render them so in such a depraved state of society, by ruling them with a rod of iron; making them, excepting the courtezans, merely household, breeding animals.</P>
<P>The state of slavery, likewise, of a large pro∣portion of men, tended probably, more than any other circumstance, to degrade the whole circle of society. For whilst it gave that air of arro∣gance, which has falsely been called dignity, to one class, the other acquired the servile mien that fear always impresses on the relaxed coun∣tenance. It may be delivered, I should imagine, as an aphorism, that when one leading principle of action is founded on injustice, it sophisticates the whole character.</P>
<P>In the systems of government of the ancients, in the perfection of the arts, and in the ingeniou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conjectures which supplied the place of science, we see, however, all that the human passions can do to give grandeur to the human character; but we only see the heroism that was the effect of passion, if we except Aristides. For during this youth of the world, the imagination alone was cultivated, and the subordinate understand∣ing merely exercised to regulate the taste, without extending to its grand employ, the forming of principles.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="029916_0174_0FE309E2359525D8"/>The laws, made by ambition rather than rea∣son, treated with contempt the sacred equality of man, anxious only to aggrandize, first the state and afterwards individuals: consequently, the civilization never extended beyond polishing the manners, often at the expence of the heart, or morals; for the two modes of expression have, I conceive, precisely the same signification, though the latter may have more extent. To what purpose then do semi-philosophers exult∣ingly show, that the vices of one country are not the vices of another; as if this would prove, that morality has no solid foundation; when all their examples are taken from nations just emerg∣ing out of barbarism, regulating society on the narrow scale of opinions suggested by their pas∣sions, and the necessity of the moment? What, indeed, do these examples prove? Unless they be allowed to substantiate my observation, that civilization has hitherto been only a perfection of the arts; and a partial melioration of manners, tending more to embellish the superior rank of society, than to improve the situation of all man∣kind. Sentiments were often noble, sympathies just—yet the life of most men of the first class was made up of a series of unjust acts, because the regulations thought expedient to cement so∣ciety, did violence to natural justice. Venerable as age has rendered many of these regulations, cold substitutes for moral principles, it would be a kind of sacrilege not to strip them of their gothic vests. And where then will be found the man who will simply say—that a king can do no wrong; and that, committing the vilest crimes to sully his mind, his person still remains sacred?
<PB N="164" REF="029916_0175_0FE30A1DAD3CDF20"/>
—Who will dare to assert, that the priest, who takes advantage of the dying fears of a vicious man, to cheat his heirs, is not more despicable than a highwayman?—or that obedience to pa∣rents should go one jot beyond the deference due to reason, enforced by affection?—And who will coolly maintain, that it is just to deprive a woman, not to insist on her being treated as an outcast of society, of all the rights of a citizen, because her revolting heart turns from the man, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a husband only in name, and by the ty∣rannical power he has over her person and property, she can neither love nor respect, to find comfort in a more congenial or humane bosom? These are a few of the leading prejudices, in the present constitution of society, that blast the blos∣soms of hope, and render life wretch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and use∣less—And, when such were tolerated, nay, reckoned sacred, who can find more than doubt∣ful traces of the perfection of man in a system of association pervaded with such abuses? Volup∣tuousness alone softened the character down to tenderness of heart; and as taste was cultivated, peace was sought, rather because it was conve∣nient, than because it was just. But, when war could not be avoided, men were hired by the rich to secure to them the quiet enjoyment of their luxuries; so that war, becom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a trade, did not render ferocious all those who directly or indi∣rectly waged it.</P>
<P>When, therefore, the improvements of civil life consisted almost entirely in polishing the man∣ners, and exercising the transient sympathies of the heart, it is clear, that this partial civilization must have worn itself out by destroying all ener∣gy
<PB N="165" REF="029916_0176_0FE30A139CB5D698"/>
of mind. And the weakened character would then naturally fall back into barbarism, because the highest degree of sensual refinement violates all the genuine feelings of the soul, making the understanding the abject slave of the imagination. But, when the advances of knowledge shall make morality the real basis of social union, and not its shadow the mask of selfishness, men can∣not again lose the ground so surely taken, or forget principles, though they may accom∣plishments.</P>
<P>And that a civilization founded on reason and morality is, in fact, taking place in the world, will appear clear to all those, who have consi∣dered the atrocious vices and gigantic crimes, that sullied the polish of ancient manners. What nobleman, even in the states where they have the power of life and death, after giving an elegant entertainment, would now attract the detestation of his company, by ordering a domestic to be thrown into a pond to fatten the fish <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cruelties of the half civilized Romans, combined with their unnatural vices, even when literature and the arts were most cultivated, prove, that humanity is the offspring of the understanding, and that the progress of the sciences alone can make men wiser and happier.</NOTE> —What tyrant would dare at this time, to poison his brother at his own table; or stab his enemy's mother, not to mention his own, without co∣louring over the deed? and do not the exclama∣tions against boxing matches, in England, also prove, that the amphitheatre would not now be tolerated, much less enjoyed? If the punishment of death be not yet abolished, tortures worse than
<PB N="166" REF="029916_0177_0FE30A1A8E220AC0"/>
twenty deaths are exploded, merely by the melio∣ration of manners. A human being is not now forced to feed the lamp that consumes him: or allowed vainly to call for death, whilst the flesh is pinched off his quivering limbs. Are not, likewise, many of the vices, that formerly braved the face of day, now obliged to lurk, like beasts of prey, in concealment, till night allows them to roam at large. And the odium which now forces several vices, that then passed as merely the play of the imagination, to hide their heads, may chase them o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of society, when justice is common to all, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches no longer stand in the place of sense and virtue. Granting then to the ancients that savage grandeur of imagination, which, clashing with humanity, does not exclude tenderness of heart, we should guard against pay∣ing that hom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge to sentiment, only due to prin∣ciples formed by reason.</P>
<P>Their tragedies, this is still but a cultivation of the passions and the taste, have been celebrated and imitated servilely; yet, touching the heart, they corrupted it; for many of the fictions, that produced the most striking stage effect, were ab∣solutely immoral. The sublime terror, with which they fill the mind, may amuse, nay, de∣light; but whence comes the improvement? Besides, uncultivated minds are the most sub∣ject to feel astonishment, which is often only another name for sublime sensations. What mo∣ral lesson, for example, can be drawn from the story of Oedipus, the favourite subject of such a number of tragedies?—The gods impel him on, and led imperiously by blind sate, though
<PB N="167" REF="029916_0178_0FE30ADB99AD68F8"/>
perfectly innocent, he is fearfully punished, with all his hapless race, for a crime in which his will had no part.</P>
<P>Formerly kings and great men openly des∣pised the justice they violated; but, at present, when a degree of reason, at least, regulates go∣vernments, men find it necessary to put a gloss of morality on their actions, though it may not be their spring. And even the jargon of crude sen∣timents, now introduced into conversation, shows to what side leans vanity, the true thermometer of the times.—An affectation of humanity is the affectation of the day; and men almost always affect to possess the virtue, or quality, that is rising into estimation.</P>
<P>Formerly a man was safe only in one civi∣lized patch of the globe, and even there his life hung by a thread. Such were the sudden vi∣cissitudes, which, keeping the apprehension on the stretch, warmed the imagination, that clouded the intellect. At present a man may reasonably expect to be allowed tranquilly to follow any scientific pursuit; and when the understanding is calmly employed, the heart imperceptibly be∣comes indulgent. It is not the same with the cultivation of the arts. Artists have commonly irritable tempers; and, inflaming their passions as they warm their fancy, they are, generally speaking, licentious; acquiring the manners their productions tend to spread abroad, when taste, only the refinement of weakened sensations, stifles manly ardour.</P>
<P>Taste and refined manners, however, were swept away by hordes of uncivilized adventurers; and in Europe, where some of the seeds remained,
<PB N="168" REF="029916_0179_0FE30B0A4AEA6348"/>
the state of society slowly meliorating itself till the seventeenth century, nature seemed as much despised in the arts as reason in the sciences. The different professions were much more knavish than at present, under the veil of solemn stupi∣dity. Every kind of learning, as in the savage state, consisted chiefly in the art of tricking the vulgar, by impressing them with an opinion of powers, that did not exist in nature—The priest was to save their souls without morality; the physician to heal their bodies without medicine; and justice was to be administered by the imme∣diate interposition of heaven:—all was to be done by a charm. Nothing, in short, was founded on philosophical principles; and the amusements being barbarous, the manners became formal and ferocious. The cultivation of the mind, indeed, consisted rather in acquiring languages, and load∣ing the memory with facts, than in exercising the judgment; consequently reason governed neither law, nor legislation; and literature was equally devoid of taste. The people were, strictly speak∣ing, slaves; bound by feudal tenures, and still more oppressive ecclesiastical restraints; the lord of the domain leading them to slaughter, like flocks of sheep; and the ghostly father drawing the bread out of their mouths by the idlest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣positions. The croisades, however, freed many of the vassals; and the reformation, forcing the clergy to take a new stand, and become more moral, and even wiser, produced a change of opinion, that soon appeared in humanizing the manners, though not in improving the different governments.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="029916_0180_0FE30ADDC90733F8"/>But whilst all Europe was enslaved, suffering under the caprice or tyranny of despots, whose pride and restless ambition continually disturbed the tranquillity of their neighbours; the Britons, in a great degree preserved the liberty that they first recovered. This singular felicity was not more owing to the insular situation of their coun∣try, than to their spirited efforts; and national prosperity was the reward of their exertions. Whilst, therefore, Englishmen were the only free people in existence, they appear to have been not only content, but charmed with their constitution; though perpetually complaining of the abuses of their government. It was then very natural, in such an elevated situation, for them to contem∣plate with graceful pride their comparative hap∣piness; and taking for granted, that it was the model of perfection, they never seem to have formed an idea of a system more simple, or better calculated to promote and maintain the freedom of mankind.</P>
<P>That system, so ingenious in theory, they thought the most perfect the human mind was capable of conceiving; and their contentions for its support contributed more to persuade them, that they actually possessed an extensive liberty, and the best of all possible governments, than to secure the real possession. However, if it had no specific basis beside magna charta, till the habeas corpus act passed; or before the revolution of 1688, but the temper of men; it is a sufficient demonstration, that it was a government resting on principles emanating from the consent, if not from the sense of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="029916_0181_0FE309F1C3424638"/>Whilst liberty had been consumed by the lascivious pleasures of the citizens of Venice and Genoa;—corroded in Switzerland by a merce∣nary aristocracy;—entombed in the dykes of the covetous Hollanders;—driven out of Sweden by an association of the nobles;—and hunted down in Corsica by the ambition of her neigh∣bours;—France was insensible to her value— Italy, Spain, and Portugal, cowering under a contemptible bigotry, which sapped the remains of the rude liberty they had enjoyed, formed no political plans;—and all Germany was not only enslaved, and groaning beneath the weight of the most insulting civil tyranny, but its shackles were rivetted by a redoubtable military phalanx. —Despotism, in fact, had existed in that vast empire for a greater length of time than in any other country;—whilst Russia stretched out her arms with mighty grasp, embracing Europe and Asia. Sullen as the amphibious bear of the north; and so chilled by her icy regions, as to be insen∣sible to the charms of social life, she threatened alternate destruction to every state in her vicinity. Huge in her projects of ambition, as her empire is extensive, the despotism of her court seems as insatiable, as the manners of her boors are bar∣barous.—Arrived at that stage of civilization, when the grandeur and parade of a palace are mistaken for the improvement of manners, and the false glory of desolating provinces for wisdom and magnanimity, the czarina would sooner have abandoned her favourite plan of imitating the conduct of Peter the Great, in labouring to civi∣lize her kingdom, than have allowed freedom to find a firm seat in her dominions to assist her.
<PB N="171" REF="029916_0182_0FE30AE43B4CEC68"/>
She has vainly endeavoured, indeed, to make the sweet flowers of liberty grow under the poisonous shade of despotism; giving the Russians a false ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for the luxuries of life before the attainment of its conveniences. And this hasty attempt to alter the manners of a people has produced the worst effect on their morals: mixing the bar∣barism of one state of society, deprived of its sincerity and simplicity, with the voluptuousness of the other, void of elegance and urbanity, the two extremes have prematurely met.</P>
<P>Thus pursued and mistaken, liberty, though still existing in the small island of England, yet continually wounded by the arbitrary proceedings of the British ministry, began to flap her wings, as if preparing for a flight to more auspicious regions—And the Anglo-Americans having car∣ried with them to their place of refuge the prin∣ciples of their ancestors, she appeared in the new world with renovated charms, and sober matron graces.</P>
<P>Freedom is, indeed, the natural and imprescrip∣tible right of man; without the enjoyment of which, it is impossible for him to become either a reasonable or dignified being. Freedom he enjoys in a natural state, in its full extent: but formed by nature for a more intimate society, to unfold his intellectual powers, it becomes neces∣sary, for carrying into execution the main ob∣jects, which induce men to establish communi∣ties, that they should surrender a part of their natural privileges, more effectually to guard the most important. But from the ignorance of men, during the infancy of society, it was easy for their leaders, by frequent usurpations, to create
<PB N="172" REF="029916_0183_0FE30B0BCE5EB600"/>
a despotism, which choaking up t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prings that would have invigorated their mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they seem to have been insensible to the deprivations under which they lived; and existing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mere animals, the tyrants of the world have continued to treat them only as machines to promote their purposes.</P>
<P>In the progress of knowledge, which however was very tardy in Europe, because the men who studied were content to see nature through the medium of books, without making any actual experiments themselves, the benefits of civil li∣berty began to be better understood: and in the same proportion we find the chains of despotism becoming lighter. Still the systematizing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, the ingenious fallacy of priests, and the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious meanness of the literary sycophants of courts, who were the distinguished authors of the day, continued to perplex and confound the understandings of unlettered men. And no sooner had the republics of Italy risen from the ashes of the Roman jurisprudence, than their principles were attacked by the apostles of Ma∣chiavel, and the efforts made for the revival of freedom were undermined by the insidious tenets which he gave to his prince.</P>
<P>The arts, it is true, were now recovering them∣selves, patronized by the family of the Medicis: but the sciences, that is, whatever claimed the appellation, had still to struggle with Aristotelean prejudices; till Descartes ventured to think for himself; and Newton following his example, explained the laws of motion and gravity, dis∣playing the mechanism of the univ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se with won∣derful perspicacity; for the analysis of ideas, which has since diffused such light through every
<PB N="173" REF="029916_0184_0FE309FB24BD9808"/>
branch of knowledge, was not before this period applied even to mathematics. The extension of analytical truths, including political, which at first were only viewed as splendid theories, now began to pervade every part of Europe; stealing into the very seminaries of learning in Germany, where formerly scholastic, dry theology, labo∣rious compilations of the wanderings of the human understanding, and minute collations of the works of the ancients, had consumed the fervor of youth, and wasted the patience of age. The college and the court are always connected: —and literature beginning to attract the attention of several of the petty sovereigns of the empire, they were induced to patronise those daring men who were persecuted by the public for attacking religious or political prejudices; and allowing them an asylum at their courts, they acquired a relish for their conversation. The amusements of the chace then yielding to the pleasures of colloquial disquisition on subjects of taste and morals, the ferocity of northern despotism began imperceptibly to wear away, and the condition of its slaves to become more tolerable.</P>
<P>Education, in particular, has been studied; and the rational modes of instruction in useful know∣ledge, which are taking place of the exclusive attention formerly paid to the dead languages, promise to render the Germans, in the course of half a century the most enlightened people in Europe. Whilst their simplicity of manners, and honesty of heart are in a great degree preserved, even as they grow more refined, by the situation of their country; which prevents that inundation of riches by commercial sources, that destroys

the morals of a nation before its reason arrives at maturity.</P>
<P>Frederic the IId. of Prussia, with the most ardent ambition, was nevertheless as anxious to acquire celebrity as an author, as he was fame as a soldier. By writing an examination of Machiavel's Prince, and the encouragement he gave to literary talents and abilities, he con∣tributed very much to promote the acquirement of knowledge in his dominions; whilst, by grant∣ing his confidence to the philosophical Hertz∣berg, the administration of his government grew considerably milder.</P>
<P>His splendid reputation as a soldier continued to awe the restless ambition of the princes of the neighbouring states, which afforded an opportu∣nity to the inhabitants of the empire to follow, during the reign of tranquillity, those literary pursuits, which became fashionable even at the half civilized court of Petersburg. It now, in∣deed, appeared certain, that Germany would gain in future important political advantages; for men were beginning to presume to think, and scanned the conduct of the supercilious Joseph with freedom, treating his vanity with contempt.</P>
<P>It is by thus teaching men from their youth to thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that they will be enabled to recover their liberty; and useful learning is already so far advanced, that nothing can stop its progress: — I say peremptorily nothing; for this is not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hesitatingly to add, short of supernatural events. And though the unjustifiable proceeding of the English courts of justice, or rather of the arbitrary chief judge Mansfield, who established it as a lawful precedent, that the greater the
<PB N="175" REF="029916_0186_0FE309FD601EFDF0"/>
truth the greater the libel, tended materially to prevent the authors of the American war from being attacked for those tyrannical steps, that ultimately tended to stop the progress of know∣ledge and the dissemination of political truth; yet the clamour which was raised against that unpopular war is a proof, that, if justice slept, liberty of thought had not forsaken the island.</P>
<P>The overweening presumption, however, of men ignorant of true political science; who be∣held a nation prosperous beyond example, whilst all the neighbouring states were languishing, and knew not how to account for it; foolishly en∣deavouring to preserve this prosperity, by mad attempts to throw impediments in the way of those very principles, which had raised Great Britain to the elevated rank she has attained in Europe, served only to accelerate their diffusion. And France being the first among the nations on the continent, that had arrived at a civilization of manners, which they have termed the only art of living, we find was the first to throw off the yoke of her old prejudices.</P>
<P>It was at this crisis of things, that the despotism of France was completely overturned, and twen∣ty-five millions of human beings unloosed from the odious bands, which had for centuries be∣numbed their faculties, and made them crouch under the most ignominious servitude—And it now remains to observe the effect of this impor∣ant revolution, which may fairly be dated from the taking of the Bastile.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE presence of the deputies had diffused throughout the capital the most intoxicating joy —for where is joy expressed with such infantile playfulness, such entire forgetfulness of to-mor∣row, as at Paris? and the citizens, with their usual burst of gratitude, which always resembles adoration, made choice of Baillie, the first acting president of the national assembly, for mayor,
<PB N="178" REF="029916_0188_0FE30B0ED8188888"/>
and of La Fayette for commander in chief of the national guards: the name now given to the <HI>garde-bourgeoise,</HI> and the other soldiers incorpo∣rated with them. But the rapture of the Pa∣risians, as transient as lively, dwindled, as their spirits were exhausted, into the murmurs of suspicion.—The ministry, said they, who were chosen to depress us, are not yet dismissed; and the troops, that were to have been their instru∣ments of mischief, still hov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r round Paris, and are even augmented by the arrival of two fresh regiments at St. Denis. A rumour was spread, that a convoy of flour had been intercepted by the order of the ministers, in its way to Paris; and some disturbances at the Bastile had given colour to a report, that they had attempted to make themselves once more masters of this important fortress. The night of the 15th was then another devoted to watchfulness and anxiety; and in the morning a deputation was sent to the national assembly, praying them to demand the dismis∣sion of the present ministry, and the recal of Necker.</P>
<P>The assembly took the subject into delibera∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but still attentive to <HI>etiquette,</HI> they debated about the decorum of interfering with the ap∣pointment of the executive power. This roused the genius of Mirabeau; and the bubbles of fear, and the straw-like objections of timidity, were carried away by the torrent of his eloquence. The discussion grew warm; yet for the present occasion soon became of little importance, be∣cause the ministry, finding that they could not stand the brunt of the storm, resigned; Necker also, in whom the public had still the most im∣plicit
<PB N="179" REF="029916_0189_0FE30AE82FFCDDC8"/>
confidence, was invited to return;—and the king appearing to be anxious to give every proof of his desire to establish general tranquil∣lity, signified, that he wished to visit Paris. A short time after they were officially informed that the troops were promptly removing to more distant quarters. The national assembly accord∣ingly sent some of their members to communicate to the Parisians this welcome intelligence, to prepare for the reception of the king by calming the fears of the people.</P>
<P>And he, adhering to his purpose, left Ver∣sailles the next day (the 17th), though his family ridiculously endeavoured to dissuade him; insi∣nuating, that he ought not to trust his sacred person to the mercy of an enraged multitude; whilst rumours of projected assassinations were repeated befor him, with exaggerated com∣ments. But, being a man of considerable animal courage, and now almost perceiving, that all the evils with which he was struggling had been produced by his headstrong advisers, he seemed determined, at least for the present, not to be governed by their dangerous councils. And he had even the sagacity to foresee, that, convulsed as the kingdom was, they would occasion a civil war, and his life might then be still more exposed. In this instance, as we shall find in many others, Louis appears to have been directed by a kind of glimmering instinct of propriety; for at the pre∣sent juncture it was particularly discreet, consi∣dering the little effect the pageantry of the court had produced at the <HI>Séance-royale,</HI> to meet the people without the parade of robes or guards. And, in fact, the hundred deputies who followed
<PB N="180" REF="029916_0190_0FE30B1784A4C050"/>
him, were now the only retinue that would have appeared respectable in the eyes of the people What too must have been his surprise, in spite of all he had heard, to pass through an immense avenue of armed Parisians with such a new aspect. —Till now he had always seen a timid multitude flying before the watch, giving vent to their vengeance in vain songs, and to their grief in feeble murmurs:—to-day he saw them trium∣phant, moving orderly along, calling out on every side, during the procession, for a constitu∣tion and laws! marching in unison with their reflections, they advanced, but slowly; for, al∣most afraid to hope, they proceeded with the measured step of thought, or rather sadness; and the people, whose mind was still agitated, as the swell of the sea continues after the storm has subsided, uttered not the shout of gladness— <HI>vive-la-roi;</HI>—but the menacing memento—<HI>vive-la-nation.</HI></P>
<P>This was as ominous a sound, as the woe! woe! resounding through the silent streets of a besieged city—for it was equally the voice of fate, proclaiming the will of the people, disgusted with courts, and suspicious even of the king. Louis seems to have been forcibly struck by the energy every where displayed; and not more by the elo∣quent discourses addressed to him at the Hôtel-de-ville, than by the countenance of each citizen: for the fire of liberty had already lighted up in every face the serene lustre of manly firmness.— So impressed, indeed, was his mind by the whole sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, that, when the animated speakers were silent, he exclaimed in reply—
<Q>My people! my people, may always rely on my love.</Q>
—And
<PB N="181" REF="029916_0191_0FE30AE9B4B0C118"/>
taking the national cockade from the hands of the mayor, he appeared at the window with his heart in his eyes, as if eager to convince the multitude of his sincerity: and perhaps conscious, that, first submitting to necessity, he now yielded to feeling. At these words, the repetition of which flew like lightning from rank to rank, the whole concourse, of people caught the electrical sympathy.—<HI>Vive-le-roi</HI> was shouted from every quarter; and revived affection glowed with the fresh fervour, that effaces the remembrance of doubts, and makes the fear of having been unjust, the most powerful spring of tenderness. And persuading themselves, for the moment, that the disposition of the king was not so much at variance with their happiness as his conduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d blessings on him, bestowing all their exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns on his counsellors.</P>
<P>Pleasure, now almost mounting to a feverish height, set all Paris quickly in motion; and the sound of the thundering artillery was the swift harbinger of the tidings of reconciliation to Versailles, where the royal family must have been anxiously alive to the events of the day.</P>
<P>These sudden transitions from one extreme to another, without leaving any settled conviction behind, to confirm or eradicate the corroding distrust, could not be seen in such a strong light any where as at Paris, because there a variety of causes have so effeminated reason, that the French may be considered as a nation of women; and made feeble, probably, by the same combination of circumstances, as has rendered these insignifi∣cant. More ingenious than profound in their researches; more tender than impassioned in their
<PB N="182" REF="029916_0192_0FE30B198BED5458"/>
affections; prompt to act, yet soon weary; they seem to work only to escape from work, and to reflect merely how they shall avoid reflection. Indolently restless, they make the elegant furni∣ture of their rooms, like their houses, voluptu∣ously handy. Every thing, in short, shows the dexterity of the people, and their attention to present enjoyment.</P>
<P>And so passive appears to be their imagination, it requires to be roused by novelty; and then, more lively than strong, the evanescent emotions scarcely leave any traces behind them. From being devoted to pleasure in their youth, old age is commonly passed in such merely animal grati∣fications, that a respectable looking aged man or woman is very rarely to be seen. Independent, likewise, of the vanity which makes them wish to appear polite, at the very moment they are ridiculing a person, their great susceptibility of disposition leads them to take an interest in all the sensations of others, which are forgotten almost as soon as felt. And these transient gusts of feeling prevent their forming those firm resolves of reason, that bracing the nerves, when the heart is moved, make sympathy yield to principles, and the mind triumph over the senses.</P>
<P>Besides, the climate of France is so genial, and the blood mounted so checrily in the veins, even of the oppressed common people, that, living for the day, they continually basked in the sunshine, which broke from behind the heavy clouds that hung over them.</P>
<P>It is impossible, after tracing the horrid con∣spiracy formed by the court against the lives and
<PB N="183" REF="029916_0193_0FE30AF291B67838"/>
liberty of the people, not to feel the most ineffa∣ble contempt for that kind of government, which leaves the happiness of a nation at the mercy of a capricious minister of state. The awful and interesting lesson, which the developement of this treachery afforded, was such as ought to have made an indelible impression on their minds.—It was a lesson, the very thought of which stops for a moment the genial current of the heart.—It was a lesson, that should be repeated to mankind; to bring home to their very senses a conviction of the lengths to which a depraved and absolute government will go, for the sake of holding fast it's power.—It was, in short, a deduction of ex∣perience, which will teach posterity that life, and every thing dear to man, can be secured only by the preservation of liberty.</P>
<P>The want of decision in the character of Louis seems to have been the foundation of all his faults, as well as of all his misfortunes; and every mo∣ment fresh occasions to make the observation arise as we trace his misconduct, or compassionate his situation.</P>
<P>To give a striking instance, it is only necessary to turn our attention to the fatal effects that flow∣ed from his consenting to assemble an army of foreigners, to intimidate the states-general. He could not resist the court, who counselled this measure; or silence the misgivings of his heart, which made him averse to the troops taking any decisive step, that lead to slaughter. And still governed by these undisciplined feelings, when he dismissed the army he pursued the advice of the very cabal, that had led him into this error; giving way to the wishes of the people,
<PB N="184" REF="029916_0194_0FE30B458BB4B828"/>
yet dissembling with them even in the act of re∣conciliation. Thus, for ever wavering, it is dif∣ficult to mark any fixed purpose in his actions; excepting that which does him honour—the de∣sire to prevent the shedding of blood. This prin∣ciple has, in general, directed his conduct; though the short-sighted measures of timid hu∣manity, devoid of strength of mind, turned all his efforts to a very contrary effect.</P>
<P>From the presence of these troops, and their abortive attempt to crush liberty in the egg, the shell was prematurely broken, and the enthusiasm of Frenchmen excited before their judgment was in any considerable degree formed. Intoxicated by conquest, each began to descant on the exist∣ing abuses, to show his own cleverness in point∣ing out the remedy; and arms being once in the hands of the people, it was difficult to persuade them to give them up for the occupations of peace. It is true, had the national assembly been allowed quietly to have made some reforms, paving the way for more, the Bastile, though tottering on its dungeons, might yet have stood erect.—And, if it had, the sum of human misery could scarcely have been increased. For the <HI>guillotinc</HI> not find-it's way to the splendid square it has polluted, streams of incocent blood would not have flowed, to obliterate the remembrance of false imprison∣ment, and drown the groans of solitary grief in the loud cry of agony—when, the thread of life is quickly cut in twain, the quivering light of hope i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> instantly dashed out—and the billows suddenly closing, the silence of death is felt;—This tale is soon told.—We hear not of years languished away in misery, whilst dissolution by inches p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsies the
<PB N="185" REF="029916_0195_0FE30B8C7ABED568"/>
frame, or disturbs the reason: yet, who can estimate the sum of comfort blasted; or tell how many survivors pine, the prey of an imagination distracted by sorrow?</P>
<P>The character of the French, indeed, had been so depraved by the inveterate despotism of ages, that even amidst the heroism which distinguished the taking of the Bastile, we are forced to see that suspicious temper, and that vain ambition of dazzling, which have generated all the succeed∣ing follies and crimes. For, even in the most public-spirited actions, celebrity seems to have been the spur, and the glory, rather than the happiness of Frenchmen, the end.—This obser∣vation enforces the grand truth on mankind, that without morality there can be no great strength of understanding, or real dignity of conduct. The morals of the whole nation were destroyed by the manners formed by the government.— Pleasure had been pursued, to fill up the void of rational employment; and fraud combined with servility to debase the character;—so that, when they changed their system, liberty, as it was called, was only the acme of tyranny—merely with this difference, that, all the force of nature being roused, the magnitude of the evil promised, by some mighty concussion, to effect it's own cure.</P>
<P>The reunion of the king and people not only routed, but terrified, the cabal; and as cowardly in adversity, as presumptuous in prosperity, they immediately took to flight different ways, and even disguised. One man, who had long been obnoxious to the people on account of inordinate covetousness, and vulgar tyranny, not softened
<PB N="186" REF="029916_0196_0FE30B4E41ABA490"/>
by the graceful condescension of the nobility, caused it to be reported, that he was dead. The renowned mareschal Broglio sought an asylum at Luxemburgh, whilst madame Polignac fled to Basle. Thus went into exile an amiable woman, who had been the instrument of the ambition of a family, that rapaciously availed themselves of her great favour with the queen, whose strange predilection for handsome women blight∣ed the reputation of every one, whom she dis∣tinguished.</P>
<P>The count d'Artois, with several others of the blood royal and principal nobility, likewise thought it prudent to leave the kingdom for the present; either to provide for their safety, or to seek vengeance. At Brussels they met the unquiet Calonne, who, having heard of the dis∣mission of Necker, was lured back by the first glimpse of hope. For wishing to wipe away the indignity, which he had so impatiently brooked; and fondly believing, that the army had had sufficient time to quash the verbal disputes of the nation; he was hastening towards France, to be ready to come in for his share of the triumph.</P>
<P>To his country this meeting has proved a source of evil, that could only have been hatched in such an unprincipled brain, fertile in plans of mischief, and prone to puzzle the cause which he wanted force to subvert. His last effort for power had been to obtain a seat in the states-general And, had not the remembrance of his former administration stood in his way, it is pro∣bable he would have succeeded, and there have become a flaming patriot, could he have been the leader of a party; for he possessed the showy
<PB N="187" REF="029916_0197_0FE30B8EFA743008"/>
talents necessary to procure instantaneous ap∣plause in a popular assembly—a deceiving, rather than a commanding eloquence. Mirabeau, on the contrary, seems to have had from nature a strong perception of a dignified propriety of con∣duct; and truth appearing to give earnestness to his arguments, his hearers were compelled to agree with him out of respect to themselves. Leaving then plausibility far behind, he always stood forth as the sturdy champion of reason; even when, laying down his club, he loitered to dally with the imagination. Whilst therefore Mirabeau was teaching the national assembly dignity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mirabeau appears to have been continually hurt by the want of dignity in the assembly.—By the inconsistency, which made them stalk as heroes one moment, with a true theatrical stride, and the next cringe with the flexible backs of habitual slaves.</NOTE>, the resentment of the vain-glorious Calonne, sharpened to the keenest edge by dis∣appointment, made him suggest to those crest∣fallen princes, the necessity of engaging foreign aid, to reinstate the king in his former plenitude of power, and to heal their wounded pride. Un∣fortunately, the plausibility of his manners, and the ingenuity of his arguments, awakened their fears, and nourished their prejudices; and quickly persuaded to assert what they wished to believe, they protested against the conduct of the national assembly; insinuating, that the body of the peo∣ple did not support their pretensions. The delu∣sion, however, did not rest here; for he even convinced them, that, if the appeal made to the national honour of the French did not recal crowds to their chivalrous allegiance, it would
<PB N="188" REF="029916_0198_0FE30B5026CD0B60"/>
not be a difficult task to engage all the powers of Europe in behalf of his most christian majesty, by showing them, that if freedom were once established in France, it would soon extend be∣yond it's confines, bounding over the Alps and Pyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees.</P>
<P>Such are the opposite sentiments, or rather con∣duct of court parasites, and men struggling to be free, that it is sufficient to contrast them. The deputies, whose lives had been threatened, and their persons grossly insulted, not only excused the ill advised monarch for the countenance which he had given to the violation of the most sacred principles; but expressed a conciliatory disposi∣tion to all parties. The mob, it is true, in the heat of rage, inhumanly butchered two of the vile instruments of despotism. But this violence offered to justice ought not to be attributed to the temper of the people, much less to the connivance of the national assembly, who acted with a de∣gree of magnanimity, at this time, of which it can never be enough lamented that they have since lost sight. The behaviour, however of the, hardened children of oppression in all countries is the same; whether in the amphitheatre at Rome, or around the lantern-post in Paris.</P>
<P>The king's eldest brother alone remained with the court, a man with more resources of under∣standing in himself, than the rest of his family; yet, making it a point of honour to be treated like his younger brother the count d'Artois, he con∣tributed by his rapacity to drain the royal trea∣sure, though such an expensive variety of amuse∣ments was not necessary to give a zest to his pleasures.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="029916_0199_0FE30B9082E345E8"/>The noble depredators had now escaped; yet Foulon, the minister, the most desperate and pu∣sillanimous of the gang, was taken, in spite of his mock funeral.—I purposely use the word gang; for a squeamish delicacy with respect to terms makes us sometimes confound characters to such a degree, that the great villain is not stigmatized with the epithet associated with the idea of a gal∣lows; because, by the grossest subversion of rea∣son, the aggravation of guilt has so palliated the punishment, that the head, which would have disgraced a halter, has been respectfully severed on a block.</P>
<P>Once seized, no authority could prevent the murder of this miserable wretch; and the same evening the intendant of Paris, his son-in-law, met a death still more shocking, being prolonged by the humane interposition of the respectable mayor, and La Fayettee, in his favour.</P>
<P>Strange that a people, who often leave the theatre before the catastrophe, should have bred up such monsters! Sill we ought to recollect, that the sex, called the tender, commit the most flagrant acts of barbarity when iritated.—So weak is the tenderness produced merely by sym∣pathy, or polished manners, compared with the humanity of a cultivated understanding. Alas! —It is morals, not feelings, which distinguish men from the beast of prey! These were transactions, over which, for the honour of human nature, it were to be wished oblivion could draw the wind∣ing-sheet, that has often enwrapped a heart, whose benevolence has been felt, but not known. But, if it be impossible to erase from the memory these foul deeds, which, like the stains of deepest
<PB N="190" REF="029916_0200_0FE2A26722C6CD30"/>
dye revived by remorse in the conscience, can never be rubbed out—why dwell circumstantially on the excesses that revolt humanity, and dim the lustre of the picture, on which the eye has gazed with rapture, often obliged to look up to heaven to forget the misery endured on earth? Since, however, we cannot 'out the damned spot,' it becomes necessary to observe, that, whilst des∣potism and superstition exist, the convulsions, which the regeneration of man occasions, will always bring forward the vices they have en∣gendered, to devour their parents.</P>
<P>Servility, destroying the natural energy of man, stifles the noblest sentiments of the soul. —Thus debased, heroic actions are merely di∣rected by the head, and the heart drops not into them its balm, more precious than the trees of Arabia ever distilled! Ought we then to won∣der, that this dry substitute for humanity is often burnt up by the scorching flame of revenge? This has now actually been the case; for there has been seen amongst the French a spurious race of men, a set of cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bals, who have glo∣ried in their crimes; and tearing out the hearts that did not feel for them, have proved, that they themselves had iron bowels.
<Q>But, if the anger of the people be terrible,</Q>
exclaims Mirabeau,
<Q>it is the sang froid of despotism, that is atrocious; those systematic cruelties, which have made more wretches in a day than the po∣pular insurrections have immolated in a course of years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Let us compare,' he further adds,
<Q>the number of innocents sacrificed by mistake, by the sanguinary max∣ims of the courts of criminal judicature, and the minis∣terial vengeance exercised secretly in the dungeons of Vincennes, and in the cells of the Bastile, with the sud∣den and impetuous vengeance of the multitude, and then decide on which side barbarity appears. At the mo∣ment when the hell created by tyranny for the torment of its victims opens itself to the public eye; at the mo∣ment when all the citizens have been permitted to des∣cend into those gloomy caves, to poize the chains of their friends, of their defenders; at the moment when the registers of those iniquitous archives are fallen into all hands; it is necessary, that the people should be essen∣tially good, or this manifestation of the attrocities of ministers would have rendered them as cruel as them∣selves!</Q></NOTE>! We often fear,</Q>
adds he,
<Q>the people,
<PB N="191" REF="029916_0201_0FE30B9208472400"/>
because we have injured them; and thus are forced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o fetter those we oppress.</Q></P>
<P>The example of the capital was followed by the provinces; and all the citizens flew to arms, whilst the soldiers grounded their's, swearing not to stain their hands with the blood of their fel∣low citizens. Added to the account of the con∣spiracy to dissolve the states-general, and massacre their representatives, a number of idle rumours of present danger tended to make the country people not only eager to guard against they scarcely knew what, but also desirous to enter into the adventures, and share the honours of the Parisians.</P>
<P>In all civil wars, personal vengeance mixing with public, or taking advantage of it, has di∣rected the dagger of assassin: and in France it ought particularly to have been dreaded; be∣cause, when fear induces a man to smother his just resentment, the festering wound is only to be cured by revenge. It is then highly probable, that most of the barbarities in the towns were the effervescence of private anger, or the sport of de∣praved
<PB N="192" REF="029916_0202_0FE30B533175C228"/>
uncultivated minds, who found the same pleasure in tormenting men, as mischievous boys in dismembering insects; for public indignation, directed against aristocratical tyranny, was else∣where, in general, displayed only in burning the country castles, and the archives of nobility. But, in the country, indeed, men rarely commit such crimes, as lift up their reptile heads in the capital, where the rank atmosphere affords the noxious particles necessary to give virulence to the poison. The vices of villagers are, in fact, rather the rich exuberance of the passions, than the vile dregs of exhausted nature.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE duke of Liancourt, whose warning voice had made the king look around him, when danger was at his heels, was now chosen presi∣dent. At this moment the obstacles, which at
<PB N="193" REF="029916_0203_0FE30B99A601B4B0"/>
first clogged the exertions of the assembly, seem∣ed to have been overcome: still fresh ones start∣ing up threw a damp on their exultation; and the apprehensions of a famine, real or facti∣tious, were not the least alarming, though the most frequent.</P>
<P>New conspiracies were already formed on the borders of France, by the princes, and those who had subsisted by the corruptions of the old sys∣tem. But this only proved a stimulus: because the nation, being determined to secure the rights it had so suddenly regained, raised new regi∣ments in every part of the country, and was soon in a situation to repel any attack, which it was possible for all Germany to have made; the only quarter from which the fugitive princes, at that period, could expect assistance. So rapid was the spirit, so general the momentum, that in the course of a week upwards of three mil∣lions of men in arms were formed into companies by a common interest resembling an electrical sympathy. Such was the quick succession of events—Such the unanimous sense of the na∣tion; and such the formidable force which instantly opposed itself to the impotent threats of departing despotism. History will record this memorable era, when the disciplined forces of the most puissant tyranny vanished before the force of truth, though still but half unveiled; obliging the haughty sycophants to search for shelter in the recesses of a forest, whither they stole under cover of the night from the presence of an injured people.</P>
<P>The conduct of the <HI>garde bourgeoise,</HI> during the progress of the revolution, without varnishing
<PB N="194" REF="029916_0204_0FE30B5B159F81D8"/>
over the excesses produced by ebullitions of zeal, is of itself sufficient to prove, that a national mi∣litia should every where take place of standing armies, did not experience invariably attest, that the laws were never respected by men, whose business is war, unless they are reduced to mere machines by despotism.</P>
<P>The old municipal officers, mostly suspected, because nominated by the friends of the court, were now obliged to give place to committees elected by the common voice. These taking the administration of public business into their hands, a new order of things began every where to prevail. Still, however, the disturbed imagina∣tion of the people was filled with plots, to which some mysterious and fatal incidents gave life.</P>
<P>The municipality of Soissons informed the national assembly, that troops of banditti had cut down the corn before it was ripe, and obliged the villagers to take refuge in the towns. But on further inquiry, it appeared, that this report arose from a simple quarrel of the peasants amongst themselves, which had alarmed some labourers, who flew to the neighbouring town, imagining that they had thousands of banditti at their heels.</P>
<P>Paris was also disturbed by an idle rumour of a riot at St. Denis; so seriously affirmed by those, who declared that they had been eye-witnesses of the violence, that troops and cannon were sent, but they could find no traces of the disturbance.</P>
<P>Another, more serious, had exasperated the people against the nobility, and roused the in∣dignation of the national assembly. A noble∣man
<PB N="195" REF="029916_0205_0FE30B9B2B6A4DB8"/>
and counsellor of the parliament gave a civic feast in his castle to the inhabitants of his village; from which, on some pretext, he was absent. All was joy and festivity; but in the midst of the dance of gladness, the sudden explosion of a mine spread around affright and death.—Hearing of this treachery, the people, catching up their rustic weapons, firebrands, hastened to the neighbouring castles; some of which they burnt, others they demolished by pulling them down.</P>
<P>The recital of this atrocity produced a great effect in the national assembly; and, says Mira∣beau,
<Q>though great assemblies are often much too susceptible of theatrical emotions; and this narration was accompanied with circumstan∣ces, of which the invention is seldom pre∣sumed; and though it was also attested by a public officer; yet the atrocity of the crime gave it an air of improbability.</Q>
This wanton act of barbarity, which the historian also would fain believe a monstrous chimera of heated brains, was, nevertheless, as well substantiated, as such a fact could be; which nothing, but the confession of the guilty party, can render abso∣lutely certain, because it seems equally foolish and barbarous.</P>
<P>These disorders, warmly represented by Lally Tolendal, determined the assembly, on the 23d of July, to publish a proclamation, inviting all good citizens to the maintenance of order; and declaring, that to try and punish for all crimes of <HI>leze-nation</HI> was the sole prerogative of the na∣tional assembly, till, by the constitution which it was about to establish, a regular tribunal should
<PB N="196" REF="029916_0206_0FE30B5D488818E8"/>
be instituted, for the trial of such offences. After endea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to excuse the violence, or, more proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, to account for for it, Mirabeau observed to the assembly,

<P>Some trifling incidents, sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d into an impor∣tance by supposition, kept alive the inventive mistrust of the nation, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me innocent victims were sacrificed, without a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying its brooding propensity to produce, like jealousy, the evil it feared. Suspecting every body, and a little vain of authority, the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roles of Pari∣sian citizens sometimes officiously arrested whom∣ever they thought fit, without assigning a suffi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient cause; and among the rest, they stopped the resident in France from Geneva. Three letters were found on him; and one of them being addressed to the count d'Artois, rendered suspi∣cious the circumstance of his tearing a fourth.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="029916_0207_0FE30B9CB1228978"/>The letters were sent by the mayor of Paris to the assembly; and the facts laid before them afforded Mirabeau an opportunity, to display his eloquence on a subject, that recalled to his mind abuses, which had formerly touched himself— the violation of private correspondence.—Though this did not appear to be exactly the present ques∣tion; for they were not intercepted letters, but letters to which chance had annexed some sus∣picious characters, to point them out for inspec∣tion. The despotism of opening indiscriminately all letters, to enable the government to judge of the character and sentiments of each individual, is too obvious to need animadversion—And who, indeed, will not exclaim against the tyranny, be it even parental, that dares to steal into the secrets of the heart; or the impertinent curiosity, that seeks for information only to diversity an idle life? The latter may be termed petty larceny; yet often the peace of whole families is invaded by these cowardly thefts, and q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls are ren∣dered irreconcilable, by giving air to angry ex∣pressions, the utterance solely of the passion of the moment. The allowing letters, also, surrep∣titiously obtained, to appear as evidence, in courts of justice, is a gross violation of the first princi∣ple of law; because no letters can lawfully be opened, but as orb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r suspected things are sought for—after information given to a magistrate. But, when seals are broken at the discretion of an individual, and brought forward to criminate a person, it is to the full as unjust, as to make a man plead against himself—And for justice to be awarded in consequence of an act of injustice, is an abuse that demands investigation. But the
<PB N="198" REF="029916_0208_0FE30B5ECE0E0D90"/>
present was not a case in point. It was not a clandestine ransacking of all letters, to search for the clue of some suspected plot; or like the reading of the correspondence of a babbling con∣spirator, after the danger was over, whose let∣ters might contain a list of timid accomplices, who would be driven to desperation by publicity. However, the decided turn was given to the question by the bishop of Langres observing, that all ages had applauded the generosity of Pompey, who committed to the flames the let∣ters which the senators had addressed to Serto∣rius. The mania of imitating the Romans on this began to appear, producing one of those instances of false magnanimity, that always arise from imitation: yet so trifling, indeed, in its pre∣sent consequence, that it would scarcely deserve to be ridiculed, much less censured, had not the same affectation afterwards brought forth more serious and even fatal follies.</P>
<P>The temper also of the Parisians, who mix in the world very early in life, leads them to ima∣gine, that they have acquired the profound know∣ledge of the springs of human passions, which enables a sagacious man almost to foresee future events, only because they have often detected the weaknesses of the human heart. This made them now suppose, that the court of Great Bri∣tain was about to profit by their intestine trou∣bles. The phraseology had long been in both countries, that they were the natural enemies of each other; and the mistrustful French quickly imagined, that the English meant immediately to take vengeance for their interference in favour of the Americans, by seizing some of their West-India
<PB N="199" REF="029916_0209_0FE30B9EDF6C8A58"/>
islands. The Duke of Dorset, in his jus∣tification of England, only changed the object of mistrust, by giving rise to some vague con∣jectures respecting a conspiracy for delivering Brest into the hands of the English; and, as there was no clue to lead to the discovery of the trai∣tors, several nobles of Britanny, probably inno∣cent, were arrested.</P>
<P>These were, nevertheless, but slight impedi∣ments; for the invigorating voice of the awakened nation gave energy to the assembly, who now named committees to expedite the present busi∣ness, preparatory to their grand task of framing a constitution. The authority and respectability of the assembly being acknowledged, they atten∣tively considered the state of the kingdom; and, mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful of the present distress of the people, issued orders for the free circulation of provision, which had been obstructed by the ancient forms, so opposite to the true principles of political economy.</P>
<P>At this juncture, Necker, still esteemed by the nation, unfortunately returned. Intoxicated by p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity, this minister had not sufficient pru∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to decline the honours, which he could not support by that dignity of conduct the present crisis required. In his way to Paris, having heard that the life of the baron de Benzenval, commandant of the Swiss guards, who had been with Broglio, was in danger, he humanely inter∣posed to stop the hand of violence; and so far he deserves praise. But when, arrived at Paris, he was received by the lively inhabitants, as the tutelar genius of France, this apotheosis had its usual effect; and assuming the demi-god, at the
<PB N="200" REF="029916_0210_0FE30B41D8866D58"/>
<HI>Hôtel-de-Ville,</HI> he was not content to preserve this victim from the public fury, without recommend∣ing a general amnesty; a measure which was as inconsiderately adopted, as proposed. For the electors pretending to issue laws for the whole nation gave great umbrage to the Parisians, who had winked at the stretch of their power, which the pressing exigency of circumstances required, during the moment danger menaced the capital. The wild current thus turned, the men, who in the morning had declared,
<Q>that liberty was safe, since Necker was allowed to watch over her,</Q>
now accused him of ambition, and a desire to keep well with the court, by facilitating the return, or escape of its minions. Such in fact was the inconstancy of a people, always running after theatrical scenes, that the tocsm was rung to denounce Necker as a courtier in one quarter of the city, at the very time the <HI>Palais Royal</HI> was illuminated to celebrate his return as a patriot.</P>
<P>The business, however, being referred to the national assembly, with a modifying explanation, they decided it mildly, paying the respect due to the good intentions from which it proceeded, though they did not pretend to sanction the hasty resolve of the electors.</P>
<P>After this tumult had subsided the narrow ca∣pacity of the minister did not allow him to take a determined part in the grand work, in which the deputies were engaged. His mind had not sufficient strength to burst the shackles of its old opinions; and, acting with his usual commercial calculations, he seems to have been one cause of the divisions, which began to agitate an assem∣bly, united rather by circumstances than by senti∣ments.
<PB N="201" REF="029916_0211_0FE30B296D4C2160"/>
Besides, the sudden emancipation of the people occasioned a delirium of joy, which re∣quired to be managed with the greatest delicacy. A vigorous ministry was certainly necessary to check the licentious spirit manifesting itself con∣tinually by the acts of violence, in so many parts of the kingdom, where tumults and assassinations were the effects of the giddiness of unexpected success. Whilst complaining of the old govern∣ment, every man in his sphere seemed to be eager to try how he himself could govern, and make up for the time he had delegated his authority. Besides, the procrastination of the relief looked for as the immediate consequence of the Revolu∣tion, however unavoidable, made the people not only murmur, but, disregarding all reason, at∣tempt to gain more by force than could, for a long time, be granted by justice, even had justice been unbiassed by self-interest.</P>
<P>The nation called for a constitution; and the assembly debated about the declaration of rights inherent to man, and those he gives up when he becomes a citizen, on which they designed to rest it, as an explanatory support.</P>
<P>Several members argued, that the declaration ought to conclude, and not precede the constitu∣tion; insisting, that it was dangerous to awaken a <HI>somnambulist</HI> on the brink of a precipice; or to take a man to the top of a mountain, to show him a vast country that belonged to him, but of which he could not immediately claim the possession. 'It is a veil,' said they,
<Q>that it would be im∣prudent to raise suddenly.—It is a secret, that it is necessary to conceal, till the effect of a
<PB N="202" REF="029916_0212_0FE30B51ABE56D40"/>
good constitution puts them into a situation to hear it with safety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These members seem to have formed a just estimate of the French character.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But Bernave terminated the sitting, though the question was still in debate, by observing,
<Q>that the declaration of rights was in two respects practically useful;—first, as it fixed the spirit of the legislation, in order that it might not vary in future; and, secondly, as it would direct the representatives of the nation in the formation of laws, in all the details of legislation, the com∣pletion of which could only be the work of time. As to the apprehension expressed of the people abusing these rights, when they acquire a know∣ledge of them, it is,</Q>
said he,
<Q>futile,—and we need only turn over the page of history, to lose these vain fears; for we shall constantly find the people tranquil in the same proportion as they are enlightened.</Q></P>
<P>Poizing thus the pillars of equal liberty, the discussion was the next day interrupted by the report made by the committee appointed for the purpose of digesting the information sent to the assembly, of the melancholy intelligence which they daily received from the provinces.—
<Q>The taxes, the rents were no longer paid, the re∣venue was exhausted, the laws were without force; and the social ties almost broken.</Q>
To remedy so many evils, the committee proposed to the assembly to publish, as soon as possible, a solemn declaration to testify their deep sense of the misery of the provinces, and their disapprobation
<PB N="203" REF="029916_0213_0FE30BA640670318"/>
of the non-payment of taxes and rents; and to declare, that, till the assembly had time to con∣sider the decrees necessary to be passed to regulate these objects, there did not exist any cause to justify similar refusals. This proposition occasioned a warm debate.</P>
<P>Some of the deputies represented, that the feudal laws were too iniquitous,—the taxes too unequally assessed—the wretchedness too general, to hope for any happy effect from such a declara∣tion—it would soon fall into oblivion, as had done the proclamation for peace:—it would ag∣gravate the misery of the state, by manifesting the impotence of the national assembly:—it would irritate even the people, who had need of com∣fort; and of whom they could not, without a kind of derision, in their present circumstan∣ces, require the payment of taxes, of which they knew well that each of them felt the in∣justice.</P>
<P>Others did not fail to insist on the danger of letting the disorder increase; on the sacredness of property; and on the immense <HI>deficit</HI> with which the nation was menaced; adding, that the national assembly would become contemptible, if it did not take the most vigorous measures.— They further dilated on the necessity of re-esta∣blishing the authority of the courts of justice;— and other arguments of the same tendency, which would have been more conclusive, more useful, if the supporters of the declaration had brought forward the shadow of a mode to assure it's exe∣cution. The debate from being warm became bitter, till it was at length resolved that a declara∣tion
<PB N="204" REF="029916_0214_0FE30B6052FF6740"/>
should be issued for the security of property, and that the remaining proposals of the committee should be discussed the next evening, the 4th of August.</P>
<P>But, before they separated, the assembly was informed, that Broglio had ordered all the arms, deposited at the town-house of Thionville, to be carried away.—This step appeared to them the height of imprudence, at a moment when the community was obliged to arm itself to watch over the public safety.</P>
<P>The following morning it was decided by a great majority, that there should be a declara∣tion of rights separate from the constitution. The sitting of the evening was impatiently expected, and the opposers of a new proclamation flattered themselves, that they should secure the general suffrage by making it appear, that patriotism demanded great sacrifices; and that instead of the vain formality of an exhortation, soon des∣pised by the people, it was necessary to carry real offerings to the altar of peace.—This was the pur∣port of a speech made by one of the nobles, the viscount de Noailles; who showed, in a very forcible manner,
<Q>that the kingdom, at this moment, fluctuated between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnative of the destruction of society, or of a government which would be admired and imitated by all Europe. How is this government to be ob∣tained?</Q>
said he,
<Q>how are the relaxed ties of society to be strengthened? By calming the people,</Q>
he continues,
<Q>by letting them see, that we are really employed for their good; and that we resist them only where it is manifestly
<PB N="205" REF="029916_0215_0FE30BA8B44A69E0"/>
conducive to their interest, that they should be resisted.—To attain then this tranquility, so necessary, I propose:</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>1st. That it be declared, before the procla∣mation digested by the committee, that the re∣presentatives of the nation have decided to levy the impost, henceforward, in proportion to the income of each individual.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>2dly. That all the public charges shall, in future, be equally supported by the whole community.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>3dly. That all the feudal claims shall be re∣deemable, on a fair valuation.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>4thly. That all the manorial claims, the <HI>mains-mortes,</HI> and other personal services, shall be done away, without any ransom.</Q></P>
<P N="5"><Q>5thly. That the manorial rents in poultry, and other kinds of provision, shall be redeem∣able by the proprietor or contractor, at a just valuation.</Q></P>
<P>The duke d'Aiguillon seconded this motion, which had been warmly applauded; or rather made another tending to the same end. For dreading the suppression of his pension, when the <HI>Livre Rouge</HI> should be reviewed, he suddenly from being a minion of the old court, became a loud patriot. And further to evince his zeal in the cause of liberty, he declared,
<Q>that the in∣surrection found it's excuse in the vexations to which the people were subject. The lords of manors,</Q>
he observes,
<Q>seldom commit the ex∣cesses of which their vassals complain; but their agents are often devoid of humanity, and the wretched husbandmen, subject to the barbarous feudal laws still in force, groan under the re∣striction
<PB N="206" REF="029916_0216_0FE30B68EE248BB8"/>
to which they become the victims. At this happy era when united for the public good, and disengaged from all personal interest, we are going to labour for the regeneration of the state, it seems to me, gentlemen, that it is necessary, before establishing this constitution, so desired by the nation, to prove to all the citizens, that our intention is to establish, as soon as possible, that equality of rights which alone can assure their liberty.</Q></P>
<P>It too frequently happens, that men run from one extreme to another, and that despair adopts the most violent measures. The French people had long been groaning under the lash of a thou∣sand oppressions; they were the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the chosen few. It was, therefore, to be apprehended, after they had once thrown off the yoke, which had imprinted on their character the hateful scars of servitude, that they would expect the most unbridled free∣dom, detesting all wholesome restraints, as reins they were not now bound to obey. From ob∣serving, perhaps, that this was the disposition of the times, the political empirics have continually inflamed the foibles of the multitude, by flattering them. Thus the nobility, whose order would pro∣bably lose most by the revolution, made the most popular motions, to gain favour with the people; tickling the spirit they could not tame. Thus also we have seen the desperate leaders of factions selecting ingeniously the terms <HI>sans-culottes, citoyen,</HI> and <HI>egalité,</HI> in order to cajole the minds of the vulgar; and hence it has happened, that, in pro∣portion as this cajolery was more highly seasoned, the power of ruling has descended to the most
<PB N="207" REF="029916_0217_0FE30BAA6B27C678"/>
desperate and impudent of the smatt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rers in poli∣tics; whilst public anarchy, and private discord, have been productive of the dreadful catastrophes, and wanton outrages which have given such home thrusts to the dignity of freedom.</P>
<P>The feudal claims that insult humanity, and show how near man is to the brute creation when laws are first made, were afterwards attempted to be enumerated; but a general cry of indigna∣tion and horror prevented the deputy from finish∣ing the frightful picture of human debasement and brutality. The vestiges of these direful op∣pressions, however, were still beld dear by these very men, who, not having the compass of morality to direct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> politics, were humane rather through w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of nerves th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soundness of understanding.</P>
<P>Be this as it may the motion of the viscount de Noailles excited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sudden enthusiasm, mixed with anger. The members of the privileged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, like children, seemed to say, by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, if you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce me to give up this toy, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fair that you should resign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our sugar-plumb. —One gave a blow in the face; and the retort courteous was a back-handed stroke. For a member, that the duke d'Aiguillon should not be generous at the expence of others, proposed the <HI>immediate</HI> suppression of all places and emolu∣ments granted so profusely by the court, as the heaviest burthen of the people—because obliged to support with their necessaries the luxuries of the great; who, detained as a kind of guards at court, were not only prevented from enlivening the provinces by their presence, but distressed them by drawing away their produce. Distin∣guishing,
<PB N="208" REF="029916_0218_0FE30B6A71DB9490"/>
however, between the pensions ob∣tained by intrigue, and, those that were the re∣ward of actual services,— he moved, that the former should be suppressed, and the latter re∣duced.</P>
<P>A motion was then made, that not only feudal rights, but all the jurisdiction of the lords of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nors, established on the same arbitrary ground, should be abolished.</P>
<P>The president now, according to rule, per∣ceiving that no one attempted to speak against the motion, was proceeding to put it to the vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> — but he paused, reproaching himself for attempt∣ing to put an end to such an interesting discussion before such among the clergy, as wished to speak, had had an opportunity of declaring their sen∣ments.</P>
<P>This artful compliment roused the bishop of Nancy to declare,
<Q>that the continual and sympa∣thizing witnesses of the misery of the people, the clergy, undoubtedly sighed after an oppor∣tunity to contribute to their relief; and that the motion anticipated their desire; yet, to show their entire approbation of it, he must be permitted to propose in addition, that the price of the ransom of ecclesiastical feudalities should not be converted to the profit of the actual in∣cumbent; but thrown into a fund for the re∣lief of the poorer part of the body.</Q></P>
<P>The bishop of Chartres, after approving of the sacrifices already made, demanded, that the sup∣pression of the game laws should be joined to them. This worthy prelate painted the injustice of those laws, not less absurd than oppressive, which force the farmer to be the tranquil specta∣tor
<PB N="209" REF="029916_0219_0FE30BABF1008A58"/>
of the ravages of his harvest; condemning him to endure cruel punishments, if he follow the first impulse of nature, which would lead him to kill the animals that injure him. A number of the nobility concurred in these sentiments; for who would be out-done in heroism? and de∣manded the renunciations of these unnatural privileges.</P>
<P>The president de Saint-Fargeau now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose, to demand an explanation relative to the taxes of which the clergy and nobility offered to divide the weight. 'We have given,' said he,
<Q>hopes to the people; but we ought to give them something more substantial; we have decreed, that, provisionally, the taxes should continue to be paid as they have been hitherto; that is to say, we have reserved to the clergy and the no∣bility the benefit of their exemptions, till they are expressly revoked.—Why do we delay to pronounce this revocation, so strictly im∣posed in almost all our instructions?—I pro∣pose, therefore, that not only for the last six months, but from the very commencement of the year, all privileged persons, without ex∣ception, support their proportional part of the public impost.</Q></P>
<P>As the discussion of the propositions of the viscount de Noailles advanced, the necessity of effacing all the traces of servitude became more and more obvious; and all the members seemed eager to point out to their colleagues the new sacrifices, that ought to be made to the good of their country. One demanded the suppression of the exclusive right to warrens;—another that
<PB N="210" REF="029916_0220_0FE30B6BF5209DD0"/>
of fisheries; a third the sale of offices, and that justice should be administered grat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itously.</P>
<P>The parish priest of Soupes, in the name of his brethern, joined the oblations of the poor to the hecatombs, of which the most part cost nothing to those who proposed them;
<Q>he de∣clared, that, animated by a desire to contribute to the relief of the people, they would relin∣quish, from the present time, all their casual (or surplice) fees.</Q>
This offer, made with great simplicity of heart, affected the assembly; nor could a very different proposal, made by the duke du Châtelet, respecting the buying up of the tithes, efface it entirely.</P>
<P>The transition to gaiety, when a member asked permission to offer also his sparrow, was very natural in a people, who always mix a degree of sarcastic pleasantry, the good-humoured face of which first appears, with the most serious things. However, after the laughter ceased,—he conti∣nued to make his demand more seriously, by ob∣serving, that an object, trifling in appearance, was a real grievance to the husbandmen; he moved, therefore, for the total demolition of all the <HI>dove-cotes</HI> throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>The respectable duke de la Rochefoucault, after having applauded all these propositions re∣marked, that the king had given the example of freeing the serfs in his demesnes; and that the moment was come, to extend this benefit to all the kingdom. This benevolent citizen did not stop here; but added a wish, that, before the close of the sessions, the assembly would take into consideration the fate of the unhappy vic∣tims
<PB N="211" REF="029916_0221_0FE30B1DF8BC75B8"/>
of covetousness, retained in slavery under another hemisphere.</P>
<P>A member now made a motion, that ex∣cited testimonies of the most sincere satisfaction from the assembly; it was to augment the sti∣pends of the parish priests, the most respectable part of the clergy.</P>
<P>Several dignitaries of the church, possessing two or more benefices, unwilling to be left behind in generosity, followed with a decla∣ration, that, confo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mable to the canons, they were resolved to limit themselves to a single one.</P>
<P>The deputies of the provinces enjoying pe∣culiar privileges receiving a hint, that the ap∣pellation of French citizens, all partaking the same rights, was the most glorious they could bear, immediately came forward to renounce them. A number of propositions, more or less important, brought up the rear. The suppres∣sion of the first fruits; the rights of warden∣ship; and the abrogation of those barbarous vows, which fetter unfortunate beings for life. —In short, full and entire liberty for the non∣catholics.—Admission of all the citizens into all offices, ecclesiastical, civil, and military.— Abolition of the plurality of ecclesiastical pen∣sions.—And then, not forgetting their national character, it was proposed, that a medal should be struck in commemoration of this night <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some French wags have laid a great stress on these decrees passing after dinner.</NOTE>; and a decree also passed, conferring gratui∣tously
<PB N="212" REF="029916_0222_0FE30B6D77DE1020"/>
on the king the august title, it might savour of a style, that scarcely befits the dig∣nity of history, to say <HI>nick-name,</HI> of RESTORER OF FRENCH LIBERTY. A deputation was ac∣cordingly appointed to carry this new mark of homage to the king, and to request his presence at a solemn <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be celebrated throughout the kingdom.—And behold night closed on the renowned 4th of August!</P>
<P>It is not possible, says a journalist of the day, to give a distinct description of the scenes which were continually shifting during this sitting.— The vivacity of the sentiments, the quick transi∣tion from a generous emotion to an epigram∣matical sensation, the disorder which made sen∣sibility predominate over legislative dignity— the reciprocal mistrust, and the combat of ge∣nerosity—all diversified by the amiable and seducing enthusiasm, so characteristic of the nation, made this an epocha in the history of the revolution, on which the contemplative mind, accustomed to consider the varied cha∣racter of man, will ponder.</P>
<P>Another observation, also, naturally occurs; for it is just to remark, as a proof of the crudeness of the political notions, not to men∣tion principles, of these legislators, that all talk∣ed of <HI>sacrifices,</HI> and boasted of generosity, when they were only doing common justice, and making the obvious practical comment on the declaration of rights, which they had passed in the morning. —If such were the rights of man—they were more or less than men, who with-held them; and the resignation, rather a resumption of their reason than a sacrifice of their property, was called for,
<PB N="213" REF="029916_0223_0FE30BB46B9BBDF8"/>
the moment they acknowledged the sovereignty of the people by becoming their representatives.</P>
<P>It is very possible, that the next morning the different parties could scarcely believe, that they had more than the imperfect recollection of a dream in their heads. So quick, indeed, had been the determinations of the meeting, which en∣croached on the midnight hour, that they had not the sober cast of thought to give them dignity. They seem in reality to have been mostly the effect of passion, of ambition, or a vain desire of vengeance; for those who were led only by en∣husiasm, and the vanity of the moment, esteemed their conduct as highly extravagant, when they had time to cool. But the commons, who had the deepest views, knew to what they had urged them, and would not let them recede.</P>
<P>It is true, the abolition of these privileges and powers had been strictly enjoined, in the instruc∣tions given to the deputies by their constitu∣ents: but, it is doubtful, whether they would have been attended to, had not the most sagaci∣ous foreseen, that the neglect might occasion a ci∣vil war. Knowing, that then property would not be cautiously respected, they began by attacking that of their presumptuous adversaries; and ac∣tually surprised the assembly into the unanimous renunciation of all revenues arising from feudal dues, and even into the abolition of tithes. The nobility, also, who saw, that they should gain more by the suppression of tithes, than they should lose by the sacrifice of the obnoxious mano∣rial fees, came into the same system. The steps like∣wise taken to increase the salaries of the indigent clergy, the most numerous part of the body

in the assembly, secured their influence. And by destroying the monopoly of municipal and judi∣cial employments, the support of the cities was obtained.—Thus the national assembly without a struggle, found itself omnipotent. Their only enemies were individuals, seemingly of impor∣tance, it is true, as they had been accustomed to lead the great corporate bodies; but what was their empire, when all their former subjects were withdrawn from their control? of these enemies, the church dignitaries were of the most conse∣quence; but after the confiscation of ecclesiastical property, it would have been impossible for the court, even supposing a counter-revolution, to provide for them; as they would have been a dead weight on the royalists.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, almost every thing human, however beautiful or splendid the superstructure, has, hitherto, been built on the vile foundation of selfishness; virtue has been the watch-word, patriotism the trumpet, and glory the banner of enterprize; but pay and plunder have been the real motives. I do not mean to assert, that there were not any real patriots in the assembly.—I know there were many. By real patriots, I mean men who have studied politics, and whose ideas and opinions on the subject are reduced to principles; men who make that science so much their principal object, as to be willing to give up time, personal safety, and whatever society com∣prehends in the phrase, <HI>personal interest,</HI> to secure the adoption of their plans of reform, and the diffusion of knowledge.</P>
<P>But most of the leaders of the national assem∣bly were guided by the vulgar import of the
<PB N="215" REF="029916_0225_0FE30B1B10216CD0"/>
word, a vain desire of applause, or deep schemes of emolument. The Lameths, for instance, who had been the obsequious slaves of the queen, were among the hottest advocates for popular power; and throughout the assembly there were traces of a similar spirit.</P>
<P>During the first struggle, the national assembly and the people were divided into republicans and royalists; but we shall find, from the moment all danger of disturbance appeared to be over, the higher class were receding from the patriots, and recruiting from the royalists, to form for them∣selves under the appellation of the <HI>impartiaux,</HI> the elements of a growing aristocracy.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE despotism of the former government of France having formed the most voluptuous, artificial characters, in the higher orders of so∣ciety, makes it less extraordinary to find the leading patriots men without principles or politi∣cal knowledge, excepting what they had casually gleaned from books, only read to while away an
<PB N="216" REF="029916_0226_0FE30B7763D32C50"/>
idle hour not employed in pleasure. So super∣ficial indeed was their acquaintance with any subject that demanded thought—and so great the degeneracy of their manners, it was natural for every man of reflection to infer, that a consider∣able length of time must elapse before the new order of things, which they were about to create, could attain stability. But this was not a dis∣couraging consideration, when it was obvious, that important advantages had already been gain∣ed by the people; and by the improvement of morals, which would necessarily follow, it was to be presumed, that the evils, the old system produced, would vanish before gradual amend∣ments; whilst, by a practical knowledge of poli∣tical and civil liberty, the great objects of the revolution would be ascertained; namely, just laws, and equal liberty.</P>
<P>The depravity of the higher class, and the ig∣norance of the lower respecting practical politi∣cal science, rendered them equally incapable of thinking for themselves; so that the measures which flattered the foibles or gratified the weak∣ness of either, were sure to have great influence in producing a schism in the public mind; which gave an opportunity to the enemies of the revolu∣tion to impede its course. And the number of the lower class having its due weight, when they became free, the most daring innovators became the greatest favourites with the public, to whose will every prudential consideration was obliged to yield.</P>
<P>Much had been gained on the 4th of August by the nation: the old forms of feudal vassalage were completely overturned—and France then
<PB N="217" REF="029916_0227_0FE2A26C50AF1288"/>
stood at the point the most advantageous in which a government was ever constructed.— She stood fair as the dawn of her liberty, having shaken off the prejudices of ages; and reason was tracing out the road, which leads to virtue, glory, and happiness—Still ambitious selfishness, melancholy drawback! governed too great a proportion of the assembly; and the nobles and clergy who had been averse to the junction of the orders, now intriguing, every debate became a bitter or violent contest, in which the popular advocates continued to gain an ascendency.</P>
<P>This disposition to intrigue, and want of sin∣cerity, so generally remarked in the French cha∣racter, laid the foundation of universal distrust; and the coalesced parties, who had not been actuated by a love of liberty, or regard for the prosperity of the kingdom, but dexterously fell in with the spirit of the day, were not aware, that a watchful, suspicious multitude, would be as likely to mistrust them in their turn, as the court, which had thriven on the ruin of their happiness. This was a blindness so gross, that it appears not a little wonderful, after considering the different characters, who succeeded each other in the ministry, or directed the helm of the state, that men should not acquire sufficient judgment to adopt the integrity of conduct, with which alone people in their senses, awake to their interest and rights, will ever be satisfied.</P>
<P>For a vain glorious ambition, mixing with the abortions of giddy patriotism, acts as the most fatal poison to political disquisitions, during sea∣sons of public ferment. The solid views of deep
<PB N="218" REF="029916_0228_0FE30B78F3432B40"/>
thinkers are adapted to the spirit of the times, and the state of reason of their compeers. And if they find that the current of opinion, in over∣turning inveterate prejudices, and the decayed walls of laws, that no longer suit the manners, threatens the destruction of principles the most sacred; they ought firmly to wait at their post, until, the fervor abating, they could, by divert∣ing the stream, gradually restrain it within pro∣per bounds.—But such patriotism is of slow growth; requiring both a luxuriant public soil, and to be fostered by virtuous emulation. Yet this emulation will never flourish in a country where intriguing finesse, supplying the place of exalted merit, is the surest ladder to distinction. It was by debasing artifices, under the old go∣vernment that men obtained favour and conse∣quence; and while such men, men who were educated and ossified by the ancient <HI>regimen,</HI> act on the political stage of France, mankind will be continually distressed and amused by their tragic and comic exhibitions.</P>
<P>Art applied to art, and stratagem against stratagem, may produce, for a time, alternate defeats; but ultimately the most cunning will triumph.</P>
<P>Vanity had made every Frenchman a theorist, though political aphorisms were never ascertained under the reign of tyranny or caprice. The sagacious part of the nation, it is true, clearly perceived, that the period was arrived, when a revolution was inevitable; but selfishness being incompatible with noble, comprehensive, or lau∣dable views, it is not wonderful, keeping in sight
<PB N="219" REF="029916_0229_0FE30BB60025DF50"/>
the national foible, that at the meeting of the states-general every deputy had his particular plan to suggest. Few of the leaders embraced the same; and acting, without coalescing, the most violent measures were sure to be the most applauded. We shall find also, that some of the most strenuous advocates for reforming abuses, and establishing a constitution, when their fa∣vourite systems were exploded peevishly retired in disgust: and by afterwards venting it, have hurried into action a race of monsters, the most flagitious that ever alarmed the world by the murder of innocents, and the mockery of justice; and whilst the profanation of her temple, be∣sprinkled with blood, has branded with an inde∣lible stigma the sanguinary brutes, the deserters cannot escape without a share of the odium.</P>
<P>Contemplating the progress of the revolution, a melancholy reflection is produced by observ∣ing, that almost every precipitate event has been the consequence of a tenacity and littleness of mind in the political actors, whilst they were affecting a Roman magnanimity of conduct—to which they appear to have been as great stran∣gers, as they were destitute of legitimate patri∣otism, and political science.</P>
<P>We have first seen Calonne, in order to secure his popularity and place, proposing an equaliza∣tion of taxes; and, when he found that his con∣sequence and power were lost, abandoning his country in disgust, and employing the most un∣warrantable means to involve his fellow citizens in all the horrors of a civil war. We shall find, likewise several other declaimers, for their sub∣sequent conduct obliges me to consider them in
<PB N="220" REF="029916_0230_0FE30B7A7581AD78"/>
no better light, when their plans were disregarded, if not acting the same shameful part, yet leaving their posts; their patriotism expiring with their popularity.—And it will be only necessary to keep in mind the conduct of all the leading men, who have been active in the revolution, to perceive, that the disasters of the nation have arisen from the same miserable source of vanity, and the wretched struggles of selfishness; when the crisis required, that all enlightened patriots should have united and formed a band, to have conso∣lidated the great work; the commencement of which they had accelerated. In proportion as these desertions have taken place, the best abilities which the country contained have disappeared. And thus it has happened, that ignorance and audacity have triumphed, merely because there were not found those brilliant talents, which, pursuing the straight forward line of political economy, arrest, as it were, the suffrage of every well disposed citizen —Such talents existed in France: and had they combined, and directed their views by a pure love of their country, to one point; all the disasters, which in overwhelm∣ing the empire have destroyed the repose of Europe, would not have occurred to disgrace the cause of freedom.</P>
<P>Every great reform requires systematic manage∣ment; and however lightly weak daring heads may treat the gravity of such a remark, the pacific progress of every revolution will depend, in a very material degree, on the moderation and reciprocity of concessions made by the acting parties. It is true, that in a nation chiefly cele∣brated for wit, so much prudence could scarcely
<PB N="221" REF="029916_0231_0FE30BB799DC7008"/>
be expected—yet that is not a sufficient reason for condemning all the principles, that produced the revolution: for liberty cannot be considered as belonging exclusively to any particular climate, or temper of mind, as a physical effect. It was peculiarly urgent, indeed, to form such a coalition, to counteract the dangerous consequences of old prejudices. The stubborn habits of men, whom personal interest kept firm to their ground, it was morally certain would interrupt the tranquil march of the revolution: it would have been pru∣dent then for men, who agreed in the main ob∣jects to have overlooked trifling differences of opinion, till they were secured: and of this several members seem to have been aware.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lally-Tolendal, in particular; for giving his opinion on the subject of two chambers, he said:—
<Q>It is not doubtful at present, and for this first assembly, that a single chamber is preferable, and perhaps necessary.— There are so many difficulties to be surmounted, so many prejudices to be conquered, so many sacrifices to be made, such old habits to root out, so great a power to control; in a word so much to destroy, and almost all to create anew. This moment, gentlemen, which we are so happy as to have seen, of which it is impossible a descrip∣tion can be given—when private characters, orders of men, and provinces, are vying with each other, who will make the greatest sacrifices to the public good—when all press together at the tribune, to renounce voluntarily, not only odious privileges, but even those just rights, which appear to you an obstacle to the fraternity and equality of all the citizens. This moment, gentlemen, this noble and rich enthusiasm which hurries you along, this new order of things which you have beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n—all this —most assuredly, could never have been produced but from the union of all persons, of all opinions, and of all hearts.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="029916_0232_0FE30B81D0CA3F90"/>Had the conduct of men been sincere, and had they really pursued that fraternity, about which they so continually declaimed: they might, in consolidating the rights of French citizens, have established every political advantage, which the then state of reason was capable of adopting for the immediate benefit of society. But resentment bursting forth, which had long lain concealed (the effect of servitude and contumely), joined with the vanity of excelling all other nations in the science of government, to produce an insolent audacity of conduct, which, aiming at overturn∣ing every thing, discouraged the wavering, and frightened the timid. Designing knaves then conceived the plan of rising to eminence by the accumulating foibles of the multitude, who, loosened from all restraint, were easily caught by the infidious arts of the most contemptible anarchists.</P>
<P>The object of those monsters, who were medi∣tating the violation of the sacred ties of honour and humanity, was early perceived by the more penetrating; but instead of opposing themselves to their designs, they for the most part became initiated into their clubs; whilst others, more haughty, though perhaps less under the direc∣tion of principles,—if there were any among them, emigrated, leaving their country verging towards the whirlpool of civil discord, and all it's concomitant wretchedness.</P>
<P>It is necessary for us to attend closely to these considerations, in order to be enabled to form a just opinion of the various revolutions which have succeeded each other:—because, from a
<PB N="223" REF="029916_0233_0FE30BB91C8BA1E8"/>
superficial view of things of this nature, we fre∣quently attribute to the passions, or innate turpi∣tude of man, what was merely the effect of moral depravity. Hence it has happened, that so many of the admirers of the revolution, in its infancy, now talk of extravagant innovations, tending to overturn all the barriers of justice,—to trample on the feelings of humanity, and to destroy every thing splendid and beautiful,—the production of ages, industry, taste, and learning.</P>
<P>But this revolution did not interest Frenchmen alone; for its influence extending throughout the continent, all the passions and prejudices of Europe were instantly set afloat. That most favoured part of the globe had risen to an astonishing pre∣eminence, though every where it's inhabitants had to contend with distinctions the most unna∣tural, and prejudices the most veteran. But, having overcome those formidable obstacles to the happiness of her citizens, society seems to have arrived at that point of civilization, when it becomes necessary for governments to meliorate it's condition, or a dissolution of their power and authority will be the conse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uence of a wilful disregard of the intimations of the times. This is a truth, which the people have perceived; but which the parasites of courts, and the advocates for despotism have not been willing to believe. And besides, their support, it might be said ex∣istence, being attached to the continuation of those savage abuses, they have fought with un∣usual intrepidity in their defence. Thus wars have been the business of courts, in which they have artfully interested the passions of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="029916_0234_0FE30B8373F1AF08"/>Men in a savage state, without intellectual amusements, or even fields or vineyards to employ them, depending for subsistence on the casual supply of the chace, seem continually to have made war, one with another, or nation with nation; and the booty taken from their enemies formed the principal object of contest, because war was not, like industry, a kind of abridgment of their liberty. But the social feelings of man, after having been exercised by a perilous life, flow over in long stories, when he reaches g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous old age. Whilst his listening progeny wonder∣ing at his feats, their hearts are fired with the ambition of equaling their fire. His soul also warmed by sympathy, feeling for the distresses of his fellow creatures, and particularly for the helpless state of decrepit age; he begins to con∣template, as desirable, associations of men, to prevent the inconveniencies arising from loneliness and solitude. Hence little communities living to∣gether in the bonds of friendship, securin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to them the accumulated powers of man, mark the origin of society: and tribes growing into nations, spreading themselves over the globe, form dif∣ferent languages, which producing different in∣terests, and misunderstandings, excite distrust.</P>
<P>The invention of the arts now affords him employment; and it is in proportion to their ex∣tension that he becomes domestic, and attached to his home. For whilst they were in their in∣fancy his restless temper, and savage manners, still kept alive his passion for war and plunder; and we shall find, if we look back to the first improvement of man▪ that as his ferocity wore
<PB N="225" REF="029916_0235_0FE30BC06BCFA708"/>
away, the right of property grew sacred. The prowess or abilities of the leaders of barbarians gave them likewise an ascendency in their respec∣tive dynasties; which gaining strength in propor∣tion to the ignorance of the age, produced the distinctions of men, from which the great in∣equality of conditions has originated; and they have been preserved long since the necessity has ceased to exist.</P>
<P>During the reign of ignorance, the disagree∣ments of states could be settled only by combats; and the art of dexterously murdering seems to have decided differences, where reason should have been the arbitrator. The custom then of settling disputes at the point of the bayonet, in modern Europe, has been justified by the example of barbarians; and whilst fools continually argue from the practice of inhuman savages, that wars are necessary evils, courts have found them convenient to perpetuate their power: thus slaughter has furnished a plausible pretext for peculation.</P>
<P>Fortunately in spite of the various impediments that have thwarted the advancement of know∣ledge, the blessings of society have been suffi∣ciently experienced to convince us, that the only solid good to be expected from a government must result from the security of our persons and property. And domestic felicity has given a mild lustre to human happiness superior to the false glory of sanguinary devastation, or magni∣ficent robberies. Our fields and vineyards have thus gradually become the principal objects of our care—and it is from this general sentiment governing the opinion of the civilized part of
<PB N="226" REF="029916_0236_0FE30B84F60BA5C8"/>
the world, that we are enabled to contemplate, with some degree of certainty, the approaching age of peace.</P>
<P>All that could be done by a body of manners, without a soul of morals, to improve mankind, had been tried in France—The result was polished slavery; and such an inordinate love of pleasure, as led the majority to search only for enjoyment, till the tone of nature was destroyed. Yet some few really learned the true art of living; giving that degree of elegance to domestic intercourse, which, prohibiting gross familiarity, alone can render permanent the family affections, whence all the social virtues spring.</P>
<P>It is a mistake to suppose that there was no such thing as domestic happiness in France, or even in Paris. For many French families, on the contrary, exhibited an affectionate urbanity of behaviour to each other, seldom to be met with where a certain easy gaity does not soften the difference of age and condition. The husband and wife, if not lovers, were the civilest friends and the tenderest parents in the world—the only parents, perhaps, who really treated their children like friends; and the most affable masters and mistresses. Mothers were also to be found, who, after suckling their children, paid a degree of attention to their education, not thought com∣patible with the levity of character attributed to them; whilst they acquired a portion of taste and knowledge rarely to be found in the women of other countries. Their hospitable boards were constantly open to relations and acquaintance, who, without the formality of an invitation, en∣joyed their cheerfulness free from restraint; whilst
<PB N="227" REF="029916_0237_0FE30BC200EC1968"/>
more select circles closed the evening, by dis∣cussing literary subjects. In the summer, when they retired to their mansion houses, they spread gladness around, and partook of the amusements of the peasantry, whom they visited with paternal solicitude. These were, it is true, the rational few, not numerous in any country—and where is led a more useful or rational life?</P>
<P>In the provinces, likewise, more simplicity of manners prevailing, their morals were more pure: though family pride, as in England, made the most noble house the royal family of each village, who visited the grand court only to im∣port its follies. Besides, in France, the women have not those factitious, supercilious manners, common to the English; and acting more freely, they have more decision of character, and even more generosity. Rousseau has taught them also a scrupulous attention to personal cleanliness, not generally to be seen elsewhere: their coquetry is not only more agreeable, but more natural; and not left a prey to unsatisfied sensations, they were less romantic indeed than the English; yet many of them possessed delicacy of sentiment.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, in a state of comparative idleness —pursuing employments not absolutely necessa∣ry to support life, that the finest polish is given to the mind, and those personal graces, which are instantly felt, but cannot be described; and it is natural to hope, that the labour of acquiring the substantial virtues, necessary to maintain free∣dom, will not render the French less pleasing, when they become more respectable.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE numerous offerings made to their country by the deputies, on the 4th of August, excited loud applause; but not without a mix∣ture of sarcastic censure, and murmurs of dis∣approbation.</P>
<P>Some blamed the decrees, which, said they, have sacrificed the property of several thousand fami∣lies
<PB N="230" REF="029916_0239_0FE30B871C550570"/>
to the vain desire of popularity.—Others complained of the neglect of those forms, by which every assembly, that aspires at putting some maturity into its decrees, ought to direct debates;—they disapproved of an afternoon sit∣ting;—of the rapid succession of subjects, not allowing time for any to be weighed;—of the multiplicity of them;—and of the continual accla∣mations, which rendered a calm discussion phy∣sically impossible.—'What!' they continued, shall
<Q>the most important business always be treated with the levity, which characterized us before we deserved to be termed a nation? Eternally the sport of our vivacity, a happy turn decides with us the most serious point; and gay sal∣lies are ever our substitutes for arguments.</Q>
—
<Q>We do madly the wisest things; and even our reason is always connected by some filament or other to inconsistency.—The national assem∣bly had been a long time reproached for dwell∣ing on trifling objects; and not attending suf∣ficiently to the promotion of general good.— When suddenly—in a single night, more than twenty important laws are decided by an up∣roar. So much done, in such a short time, is so astonishing, that it appears like a dream.</Q></P>
<P>In reply it was said—
<Q>Why deliberate, when all are agreed?—Does not a general good always appear self-evident?—Was it not suffi∣cient to declare these patriotic propositions to prove their justness?—The first person, who pointed out a new tribute to the public interest only gave utterance to what we all before felt— there was no need then of discussion or elo∣quence, to make that be adopted, which had
<PB N="231" REF="029916_0240_0FE30BC50909B0B0"/>
already been resolved by the greater num∣ber of the deputies, and commanded by the awful authority of the nation, in their mandates.—The assembly might have pro∣ceeded more methodically; but the result could not have been more advantageous. It seemed as if all the old effects, all the moul∣dering titles of feudal oppressions were then put up to auction: and the kind of mistrust of the different orders, which provoked re∣ciprocal concessions, was still for the public good.</Q></P>
<P>The nobles and clergy of the provinces, who had not been carried away by the enthusiasm of the 4th of August, felt themselves particularly aggrieved. Those who were recently noble did not like to mix again on equal terms in towns where they had received the homage paid to princes; and the people, eager to exercise their liberty, began to hunt down the game, regardless of the mischief they did to the standing corn. The very concessions of the nobility seemed to rouse the vengeance it ought to have allayed; and the populace vented their rage by burning the castles, which had been, as it were, legally dismantled of their feudal fortifications.</P>
<P>The clergy, in particular, complained, that their deputies had exceeded all bounds in voting away the private property of the body; for they would not allow, that tithes came within the description of feudal tenures. The want of pro∣vision, likewise, tended to make the people cla∣mour about present grievances, without suffering the prospect of future comfort and respectability to have its due force towards calming their minds.
<PB N="232" REF="029916_0241_0FE30B3693469200"/>
All, therefore, flew to arms, and three millions of men wearing the military garb, showed the natural disposition of the nation; and their pre∣sent resolve, no longer to couch supinely under oppression. Many excesses were the consequence of this sudden change; and it is notorious, that the people, in some instances, became the instru∣ments of the routed party; who continued to use every stratagem to render the nation dissatis∣fied with the revolution.</P>
<P>It is the nature of man, either in a savage state or living in society, to protect his property; and it is wise in a government to encourage this spirit. For the example now displayed by France is a notable proof of the inexpediency of standing armies, so long as the people have an interest in supporting the political system under which they live. The national assembly, aware of this, in∣vited the militia and the municipalities, to endea∣vour to quell the disorders, which did violence to persons and property; and they were particu∣larly requested to take the most watchful care, that the convoys of wheat and flour were not stopped by the idle and lawless. For several of the most fatal tumults had originated from this cause.</P>
<P>The decrees of the 4th of August, were then brought forward to be examined and explained; and some attempts were made to argue away the essence of many of the vaunted sacrifices.—But the discussion was interrupted, to attend to busi∣ness of a more pressing nature. The present state of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nation was most alarming; and the ministers, not knowing how to act under the new trammels of responsibility, came to repre∣sent
<PB N="233" REF="029916_0242_0FE30BCD76183C70"/>
to the assembly;—that the laws were with∣out force;—the courts of justice without activity; —and they requested them, immediately to point out the coercive measures necessary to give to the executive authority the influence it had lost. —'For' observed they,
<Q>whether the irritated sense of the abuses, which the king wishes to reform, and you desire to proscribe for ever, have led the people astray; or, the declaration of an universal regeneration have shaken the various powers upon which the social order reposed—or whatever, in fact, be the cause, gentlemen, the truth is, that public order and tranquillity are disturbed in almost every part of the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>Necker, afterwards, having explained the de∣plorable state of the finances, the extraordinary expences, and the diminution in the produce of the revenue, demanded, in the name of the king, that the assembly would sanction a loan of thirty millions of livres, to fulfil the engagements, and discharge the inevitable expenditure of the two approaching months; by which time, he pre∣sumed, the constitution would be nearly esta∣blished. Thinking also, that the patriotism of money-lenders was not to be reckoned upon, he proposed to add to the five per cent. he mentioned some allurements of speculation, to quicken the determination of the lenders— and he further inferred, that private interest would then tend to quiet the kingdom, whilst they were advancing in the formation of a constitution, which was to secure its future tranquillity, and provide a permanent revenue.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="029916_0243_0FE30C11ED1BF940"/>This proposal produced the most warm and loud applause.—One member proposed, that the loan should instantly be voted in the presence of the minister, as a mark of their entire satisfac∣tion—another offered six hundred thousand livres as a security that he would raise the loan in his own province. This effervescence, so contagious, which is after all only physical sensibility, excited by a commotion of the animal spirits, proves, that a considerable length of time is necessary to accustom men to exercise their rights with deli∣beration; that they may be able to defend them∣selves from a kind of instinctive confidence in men; and to make them substitute respect for principles, to a blind faith in persons, even of the most distinguished abilities.—But to elevate a numerous assembly to this calm grandeur; to that permanent dignity, which represses the emo∣tions of the moment, demands, it is probable, a more advanced state of reason.</P>
<P>Lally Tolendal supported the necessity of adopting the measures proposed for the obtain∣ing a loan to supply the exigencies of govern∣ment, which were become very urgent; and he refuted the objection, made by several deputies, who were against the grant, that in their instruc∣tions they had been strictly enjoined not to sanc∣tion any tax or loan before the constitution was formed. On this side Mirabeau ranged himself; for with all his great talents and superiority of genius, he could not avoid envying inferior abi∣lities, when they attracted the least popularity. He therefore, with plausible rhetoric but shallow arguments, opposed the loan; and with great parade moved, that the deputies should offer
<PB N="235" REF="029916_0244_0FE30BCF73171230"/>
their individual credit, instead of departing from the very letter of their instructions. This was one of those instances of pretended disinterested∣ness, or false patriotism, calculated to dazzle the people, whilst it involved the nation in fresh embarrassments.</P>
<P>The plan was referred to the consideration of the committee appointed to make financial re∣ports: and they accordingly acknowledged the necessity of a prompt supply; but thought, that the loan might now be obtained without the additional advantages which Necker mentioned as a necessary bait. The discussion was then re∣newed with great heat, and even personality; till at last the interest of the loan was fixed at four and an half per cent.; and to slip through the knot they were afraid to cut, it was to be sanctioned under the wing of the decrees of the 4th of August.</P>
<P>It did not, however, prove productive; for in the course of three weeks, only two millions, six hundred thousand livres were subscribed. And this delay of business induced the assembly to adopt, with less scruple, another proposal for a fresh loan, instead of the one that did not pro∣mise to answer, at a rate less advantageous to the nation: or rather they yielded to the necessity, into which they had plunged themselves; and left the mode of obtaining it to the executive power, in spite of their former objection. But it was not an easy task to inspire the bankers and money-holders with sufficient faith in the new government, to induce them to come for∣ward to support it; besides, the previous discus∣sion had converted caution into timidity; and
<PB N="236" REF="029916_0245_0FE30B2AF27F2B78"/>
the more desperate the state of the finances ap∣peared, the stronger grew the suspicion, that threw insurmountable obstacles in the way of a temporary relief.</P>
<P>Settling the precise terms of the decrees, which were to abolish feudal vassalage, the question respecting the including of tithes was agitated with most earnestness; and the objections urged against the abolition were not only ingenious, but reasonable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>It is worthy of remark, that the <HI>divine right</HI> of tithes was never insisted on,</Q>
says a French writer,
<Q>even by the clergy, during this debate. Yet the year before, when the same question was brought forward in the Irish house of parliament, great stress was laid on this Gothic idea of their origin.</Q></NOTE> The abbé Sieyes spoke with great good sense, asserting,
<Q>that the tithes were not a tax levied on the nation; but a rent∣charge, for which a proper allowance had been made to the present possessors of the estates, to not one of whom they actually belonged. He, therefore, insisted, that, if the sacrifice were necessary, it ought to be made to the public, to relieve the people, and not to enrich the pro∣prietors; who were, generally speaking, of the most opulent part of the community.</Q>
He advised the assembly to be on their guard, lest avarice, under the mask of zeal, should deceive them, leading the nation to reward rather than indemnify the nobility. The fact was, that the landed interest were only resigning obsolete pri∣vileges, which they scarcely dared exercise, to secure a solid advantage. Society has hitherto been constructed in such a vicious manner, that to relieve the poor you must benefit the rich.
<PB N="237" REF="029916_0246_0FE30BD0F6BC7768"/>
The present subject was a delicate one; the abo∣lition of tithes would remove a very heavy vex∣atious clog, that had long hung on the neck of industry; yet it were to be wished, that it could have been settled in such a way as not to have secured a great pecuniary advantage to the nobi∣lity. For though it was physically impossible, to make this sacrifice to society at large immedi∣ately; because the proprietors, and more parti∣cularly the lease-holders of the estates, could not have redeemed the tithes, without distressing themselves to a degree, that would nearly have stopped the course of husbandry; not to men∣tion agricultural improvements, so necessary in France, and to be looked for as the fruit of liberty:—yet a gradual tax on the original land∣lord would have prevented the nobility from being the great gainers by their so much extolled disinterestedness, in their fallacious sacrifice of privileges. Because, for all real property they were to be reimbursed; and for the obnoxious feudal tenures, such as personal servitude, with others they were ashamed to enumerate as being due from man to man, the tithes were an ample indemnity; or more properly speaking clear pro∣fit, except to those who parted with the plumes which raised them above their fellows with great regret. It was, indeed, very difficult to separate the evil from the good that would redound to the nation by the doing away of this tax.—The clergy, however, cut the debate short, by resign∣ing their right, offering to trust to the justice of the public for the stipend in return necessary to enable them to support the dignity of their function.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="029916_0247_0FE30C136FD78730"/>On the 13th, therefore, the whole discussion closed; for the other articles did not admit of much disputation. The president accordingly waited on the king, who received his new title with the decrees, to which he afterwards made some objections, though the assembly considered them as virtually sanctioned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is observable, that the satisfaction of the people was by no means equal to the discontent manifested by the privileged orders.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A committee of five had been employed to di∣gest a declaration of rights, to precede the con∣stitution. The opinion of those, who thought that this declaration ought to have been kept back, has already been alluded to; yet the sub∣ject seems to require a little further consideration. And, perhaps, it will appear just to separate the character of the philosopher, who dedicates his exertions to promote the welfare, and perfection of mankind, carrying his views beyond any time he chooses to mark; from that of the politician, whose duty it is to attend to the improvement and interest of the time in which he lives, and not sacrifice any present comfort to a prospect of future perfection or happiness. If this defini∣tion be just, the philosopher naturally becomes a passive, the politician an active character. For though the desire of loudly proclaiming the grand principles of liberty to extend them quick∣ly, be one of the most powerful a benevolent man, of every description of mind, feels; he no sooner wishes to obey this impulse, than he finds himself placed between two rocks.—Truth commands him to say all; wisdom whispers to him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emporize.—A love of justice would lead
<PB N="239" REF="029916_0248_0FE30BD27A36B9A8"/>
him to bound over these cautious restraints of prudence; did not humanity, enlightened by a knowledge of human nature, make him dread to purchase the good of posterity too dearly, by the misery of the present generation.</P>
<P>The debates respecting the adoption of the declaration of rights became very spirited; and much heterogeneous matter was introduced, to lengthen the discussion and heat the disputants, as the different articles were reviewed. The article respecting religion particularly arrested the atten∣tion of the assembly, and produced one of those tumultuous scenes, which have so often disgraced their deliberations. The intolerant sentiments uttered; and even the insertion of some amend∣ments, which could not, without a contradiction in terms, find a place in a declaration of rights; proved, that the assembly contained a majority, who were still governed by prejudices inimical to the full extent of that liberty, which is the un∣alienable right of each citizen, when it does not infringe on the equal enjoyment of the same por∣tion by his neighbour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the artcile 10.
<Q>No man ought to be molested on account of his opinions, not even on account of his religious opinions, provided his avowal of them does not disturb the public order established by law.</Q></NOTE>. The most sensible part of the assembly asserted, that religion ought not to be mentioned, unless to declare, that the free exercise of it was a right in common with the free utterance of all opinions; which came under civil cognizance only when they assumed a form, namely, when they produced effects, that clash∣ed with the laws; and even then it was the
<PB N="240" REF="029916_0249_0FE30C1C12BD3208"/>
criminal action, not the passive opinion, which was proscribed by the penalty of punishment.</P>
<P>In this declaration are found the principles of political and civil liberty, introduced by a very solemn exordium:—Declaring
<Q>that, as ignorance, forgetfulness, and contempt of the rights of men, are the sole causes of public grievances, and of the corruption of govern∣ments, the assembly had resolved to re-esta∣blish, in a solemn declaration, the natural, im∣prescriptible, and sacred rights of man; in order that this declaration, constantly present to all the members of the social body, may continually remind them of their rights, and of their duties; that, having it in their power every moment to compare the acts of the legi∣slative and executive authorities with the purpose of all political institutions, they may the more respect them; and that the remonstrances of the citizens, founded. in future, on simple and incontestible principles, may always tend to support the constitution, and to promote the happiness of the whole community.</Q></P>
<P>Some temporary business, towards restoring public tranquillity, and to give force to the laws, insulted by the licentious conduct of men inebri∣ated merely by the expectation of freedom, scented from a-far, being dispatched, the forma∣tion of a constitution became the standing labour of the assembly.</P>
<P>The first question naturally fell under this head—what share of power ought the king to be allowed to possess in the legislature This was an important consideration for men, who were all politicians in theory; and many of whom,
<PB N="241" REF="029916_0250_0FE30BD8387D0F40"/>
having suffered under the absolute sway of the king's ministers, still felt the smart of their oppres∣sion, and a contempt for the power that authorized their dominion: whilst the blind zealots for the indefeasible rights of kings, though they were ashamed of the phrase, heated the imagination of their party, by the most inflated encomiums of the benefits arising from extensive kingly prero∣gatives, and vapid remarks on the British consti∣tution and other forms of government, obviously to display their erudition. The most noisy inde∣corus debates ensued, and the assembly seemed to meet rather to quarrel than deliberate. A divi∣sion the most decided consequently took place; which, under different appellations, and profess∣ing different principles, has ever since conti∣nued to convulse the senate; if the legislative assembly, or the convention, deserve a name so dignified.</P>
<P>In discussing whether the royal sanction should be necessary to the validity of the acts of the legi∣slative body, a variety of extraneous subjects, and others prematurely forward, so entangled the main question, as to render it difficult to give a clear and brief account of the debates; without lending a degree of reasonableness to them, that the manner of arguing, rudely personal, and loudly uncivil, seemed to destroy. For good lungs soon became more necessary in the assem∣bly than sound arguments, to enable a speaker to silence the confusion of tongues; and make known his opinion to men, who were eager only to anounce their own. Thus modest men had no chance to be heard, though persuasion dwelt on their lips; and even Mirabeau, with his command∣ing
<PB N="242" REF="029916_0251_0FE30C1DC777E168"/>
eloquence, and justness of thought, procured attention as much by the thundering emphasis which he gave to his periods, as by his striking and forcible association of ideas.</P>
<P>As a nation, the French are certainly the most eloquent people in the world; their lively feel∣ings giving the warmth of passion to every argu∣ment they attempt to support. And speaking fluently, vanity leads them continually to endea∣vour to utter their sentiments, without consider∣ing whether they have any thing to recommend them to notice, beside a happy choice of expres∣sions. Only thinking then of speaking, they are the most impatient of hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, coughing, hemming, and scraping with their feet, most audibly, to be∣guile the time. Laying aside also, in the assembly, not only their national politeness, but the com∣mon restraints of civility; good manners seldom supply the place of reason, when they are angry. And as the slightest contradiction sets them on fire, three parts out of four of the time, which ought to have been employed in serious investiga∣tion, was consumed in idle vehemence. Whilst the applauses and hisses of the galleries increased the tumult; making the vain still more eager to mount the stage. Thus every thing contributing to excite the emotions, which lead men only to court admiration, the good of the people was too often sacrificed to the desire of pleasing them. And so completely was the tide of their affection for the king turned, that they seemed averse to his having any portion of legislative authority in the new constitution.</P>
<P>The duke de Liancourt divided the question respecting the share of power he was to enjoy as
<PB N="243" REF="029916_0252_0FE30BE8F4E025E8"/>
a part of the government. 1<HI>st. Is the royal sanc∣tion indispensibly necessary, to give the actual force of law to the decrees of the national assembly?</HI> 2<HI>dly. Ought the king to be an integrant portion of the legis∣lature?</HI> In England the phrase <HI>royal assent</HI> has been adopted, as expressive of a positive act; but the French, rather choosing to distinguish the same act of power by a negative, fixed on the latin word <HI>veto, I forbid.</HI> And then it became a question, how far this <HI>veto</HI> ought to extend, sup∣posing the prince to be invested with it.—Was it decisively to obstruct the enaction of a law passed by the legislative body? or only to suspend it, till an appeal could be made to the people by a new election?</P>
<P>The assembly in this instance seem to have acted with strange confusion of mind, or a total ignorance of the nature of a mixed government: for either the question was nugatory, or a king useless. Lally-Tolendal, Mounier, and Mira∣beau, argued for the absolute <HI>veto.</HI>—
<Q>Two pow∣ers,</Q>
says Mirabeau,
<Q>are necessary to the ex∣istence of the body-politic, in the orderly dis∣charge of it's functions:—To will—and to act. By the first, society establishes the regulations which ought all to conspire to one end—the good of all:—By the second, these regulations are carried into execution: and public authority is exerted, to make society triumph over the obstacles, which might arise from the opposite wills of individuals. In a great nation, these two powers cannot be exercised by the people: whence comes the necessity of representatives, to exercise the faculty of willing, or the legisla∣tive power; and also of another species of repre∣sensation,
<PB N="244" REF="029916_0253_0FE30C1F4B89C410"/>
to exercise the faculty of acting; or, the executive power.</Q></P>
<P>He further insists, that
<Q>the possession of this power is the only way to render a king useful, and to enable him to act as a check on the legis∣lative body: the majority of which might ty∣rannize i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most despotic manner, even in the senate, to the very expulsion of the members, who dared to thwart the measures they could not approve. For under a weak prince, a little time and address alone would be necessary, to establish legally the dominion of an army of aristocrats; who, making the royal authority only the passive instrument of their will, might replunge the people into their old state of de∣basement.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The prince, therefore, being the perpetual representative of the people, as the deputies are their representatives elected at certain pe∣riods, is equally their safe-guard.</Q></P>
<P><Q>No person exclaims against the <HI>veto</HI> of the national assembly; which is, in reality, only a right the people have confided in their repre∣sentatives, to oppose every proposition, that would tend to re-establish ministerial despotism. Why then object to the <HI>veto</HI> of the prince, which is but another right, especially confided in him by the people, because he and they are equally interested to prevent the establishment of an aristocracy?</Q></P>
<P>He proceeds to prove,
<Q>that, whilst the legis∣lative body is respectable, the <HI>veto</HI> of the king cannot do harm, though it is a salutary check on their deliberations; and granting, that the influence of the crown has a tendency to increase,
<PB N="245" REF="029916_0254_0FE30BDB20318420"/>
a permanent assembly would be a sufficient counterpoise for the royal negative. Let us,</Q>
he concludes,
<Q>have an annual national assembly, let ministers be made responsible; and the royal sanction without any specified restrictions, but in fact, perfectly limited, will be the palladium of national liberty, and the most precious exer∣cise of the liberty of the people.</Q></P>
<P>Having suffered by the abuse of absolute power, many of the deputies, afraid to entrust their con∣stitutional monarchs with any, opposed the <HI>veto;</HI> lest it should palsy the operations of the national assembly, and bring back the old despotism of the cabinet. The discussion likewise extending be∣yond it's walls, was as superficially and as warmly treated by those, who thought only of the old government, when they talked of framing a new one. And as the people were now led by hot∣headed men, who found it the shortest way to popularity, to deliver exaggerated elogiums on liberty, they began to look for a degree of free∣dom in their government, incompatible with the present state of their manners; and of which they had no perfect idea. It is not then surprising, that it should become a mark of patriotism, to oppose the <HI>veto;</HI> though Mirabeau never gave a stronger proof of his, than in supporting it; convinced that it was the interest of the peo∣ple he was espousing, whilst he risked their favour.</P>
<P>The will of the public was, in reality, so de∣cided, that they would scarcely allow the <HI>veto</HI> to be mentioned; and the assembly, to steer a mid∣dle course, adopted the <HI>suspensive veto</HI>; after con∣sidering some other important elements of the
<PB N="246" REF="029916_0255_0FE30B2D29BD8C00"/>
constitution, which seemed to them to be inti∣mately connected with the royal prerogative.</P>
<P>Cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a few of the most judicious deputies must have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the impolicy of the <HI>suspensive veto;</HI> and they could only have agreed to fall into the measure, under an idea that the minds of the people not being completely ripe for a total change of government—from absolute despotism to complete republicanism, it was politically necessary still to maintain the shadow of mo∣narchy. 'To assign,' says one of the deputies,
<Q>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the <HI>veto</HI>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t last to force the king to exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a law of which he disapproves: and making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thus a blind and passive instrument a secre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is somented between him and the national assembly. It is, in short, to refuse him the <HI>veto;</HI> though those wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re it have not the courage openly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, that France has no longer any need of a king.</Q></P>
<P>But, from the commencement of the revolu∣tion, the misery of France has originated from the solly or art of men, who have purred the people on too fast; tearing up prejudices by the root▪ which they should have permitted to die gradually away. Had they, for example, allowed the king to have enjoyed the share in the government promised by the <HI>absolute veto,</HI> they wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have let him gently down from the altitude of unlimit∣ed sway, without making him see the ground he lost in the descent. And this semblance of his former authority would have gratified him; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather, breaking his fall, have induced him to submit patiently to other restraints, less humili∣ating to him, though more beneficial to the people. For it is evident from experience, and might have
<PB N="247" REF="029916_0256_0FE30BDCB309AC80"/>
been foreseen, that the determination on this question was one grand source of the continual bickerings of the assembly with the court and ministry; who took care to make the king see, that he was set up as an idol, merely to receive the mock respect of the legislative body, till they were quite sure of the people.</P>
<P>Could it, indeed, have been ascertained, that Louis, or rather the queen, would have tamely born with such a diminution of power, this mea∣sure might have been deemed prudent; because it was then morally certain, that the monarchy would have expired naturally with the dissolution of the king. But, when the pride and restless spirit of the queen were well known; and that it was probable, from the whole tenor of her former life, she would contrive to have the ministry composed of the most dissolute and head∣strong men; it must appear the height of folly only to have left the king the power of perplexing their proceedings, after they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qued his pride. And when, to give, as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, efficiency to the conspiracies, which would naturally be formed by the courtiers, to recover the authority <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft from them, we find they afterwards voted such an enormous sum to defray the civil list, as was sufficient to move like puppets hundreds of the corrupt French; it must be confessed, that their absurdity and want of discernment appear not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reprehensible, than the subsequent con∣duct of the court flagitious.</P>
<P>The constitutional committee had given it as their opinion, that the contested <HI>veto</HI> did not con∣cern the national assembly then existing; which, being a constituting body, it was their duty to
<PB N="248" REF="029916_0257_0FE30B39B81763E8"/>
see that the constitution was accepted, not sanc∣tioned. This report carries with it an air of imbecility, which renders it almost incredible: for, if the assembly were determined to oblige the king to accept their decrees, they had better have told him so with becoming dignity, and made pro∣vision for his retiring from a post in which he was useless. Instead of this, he was in a man∣ner shuffled off the throne; and treated with cruelty as well as comtempt. It would have been at least ingenuous, and might be deemed mag∣nanimous, had they allowed him to retire with a third of the stipend, which they afterwards voted him, when he continued to appear like a theatrical king, only to excite the pity of the vulgar, and to serve as a pretext for the despots of Europe to urge in justification of their inter∣ference. The liberating an imprisoned monarch was a plausible motive, though the real one was obviously to stop the progress of principles, which, once permitted to extend themselves, would ulti∣mately sap the foundation of their tyranny, and overturn all the courts in Europe. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd∣ing then only to have in view the restoration of order in France, and to free an injured king, they aimed at crushing the infant brood of li∣berty.</P>
<P>Similar sentiments must have occurred to every thinking person, who ever seriously reflected on the conduct of the Germanic courts, which has actually destroyed the tranquillity of Europe for centuries past. War is the natural consequence of their wretched systems of government.—They are sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orted by military legions, and without wars they could not have veteran soldiers. Their
<PB N="249" REF="029916_0258_0FE30BDE38852590"/>
aggrandisement then, and half-lived pleasures, cast in a mould of ceremony, spring out of the miseries, and are fostered by the blood of human beings; whom they have sacrificed with as much <HI>song froid,</HI> sending them in herds to slaughter, as the hard-hearted savage Romans viewed the horrid spectacle of their prize-fighters; from the bare idea of which the mind turns, dis∣gusted with the whole empire, and particu∣larly with the government that dared to boast of its heroism and respect for justice, when not only tolerating, but encouraging such enor∣mities.</P>
<P>To the sympathising princes of the continent, therefore, the king should have been given up: or, if it were necessary to humour the prejudice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> still suffer Frenchmen to have a most Christian king, or <HI>grand monarque,</HI> to arouse them by devouring capons or partridges before them; it would have been but just, both in reason and policy to have allowed him such a portion of liberty and power, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would have form∣ed a consistent government. This would have pre∣vente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se clamours, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere sure to draw toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> a host of enemies, to impede the settle∣ment of rational laws; flowing from a constitu∣tion, that would peaceably have undermined des∣potism, had it been allowed gradually to change the manners of the people. Though had this power been granted, it might have been produc∣tive perhaps of great inconveniences; as it is not likely, that a court accustomed to exercise un∣bridled sway would contentedly have co-operated with the legislature, when possessing only rea∣sonable prerogatives.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="029916_0259_0FE30C20CF4E9FF8"/>Some apprehensions of this kind may have oc∣curred to the assembly: though it rather appears, that they were either influenced by a ridiculous pride, not being willing to take the British con∣stitution, so far as it respected the prerogative, for their model; or intimidated by the people, who, during the long debate, had outrageously expressed their will, and even handed about a list of proscriptions, in which the <HI>vetoists</HI> were denounced as traitors worthy of death. Be this as it may, they determined on a half-way mea∣sure, that irritated the court without appeasing the people. Having previously decreed, that the national assembly should be permanent, that is always existing, instead of being dissolved at the close of every session, they resolved, that the <HI>veto</HI> of the king should suspend the enaction of a law only during two legislatures.
<Q>The wisdom of this law,</Q>
says Rabaud,
<Q>was universally ac∣knowledged,</Q>
though the folly of it rather merited universal reprobation.</P>
<P>From the manner indeed, in which the assem∣bly was constituted, it was to be dreaded, that its members would not long sustain the dignity, with which they commenced the career of their business: because the party, that opposed with such bitterness the junction of the three orders, still opposing with rancorous heat, and wily stratagems, every measure proposed by the really patriotic members, were indirectly seconded by the insincere and wavering; who, having no motive to govern their conduct, but the most detestable selfishness, the offspring of vanity or avarice always took the side best calculated to gratify the crude wishes of the multitude. And
<PB N="251" REF="029916_0260_0FE30B2482B1D5A8"/>
this unyoked multitude, now suddenly initiated into the science of civil and natural rights, all become consummate politicians, began to control the decisions of a divided assembly, rendered timid by intestine broils.</P>
<P>There were besides many circumstances, which tended to make any attempt to counteract this influence very difficult. At the meeting of the states-general, the whole court-party, with the greater proportion of both the nobility and cler∣gy, were in opposition to the third estate: and though the number of the latter was equal to that of the other two orders, they had also to contend with the inveterate prejudices of ages. The court had thought only of devising means to crush them; and had the soldiery acted with the blind zeal common to men of this profession, it would of itself have been sufficient to have completely disconcerted their views. This con∣duct of the cabinet, and the discovery of the atrocious conspiracy, which had been formed against the people and their idolized representa∣tives, provoking the resentment and vengeance of the nation, palsied all authority, and rendered the laws that had emanated from it contemptible. To oppose this torrent of opinions, like an impe∣tuous current, that after heavy rains, defying all resistance, bears away on its raging bosom every obstacle, required the most enlightened prudence and determined resolution.</P>
<P>So much wisdom and firmness seldom fall to the lot of any country: and it could scarcely have been expected from the depraved and volatile French; who proudly, or ignorantly, determin∣ing to follow no political track, seem to have
<PB N="252" REF="029916_0261_0FE30C26CEA64268"/>
fixed on a system proper only for a people in the highest stage of civilization:—a system of itself calculated to disorganize the government, and throw embarrassments into all its operations. This was an error so gross as to demand the severest animadversions. For this political plan, ever considered as utopian by all men who had not traced the progress of reason, or calculated the degree of perfectibility the human faculties are capable of attaining, was, it might be pre∣sumed, the most improper for the degenerate society of France. The exertions of the very admirers of the revolution were, likewise, far from being permanent; and they could hard∣ly have been expected to possess sufficient vir∣tue to support a government, the duration of which they at least feared would be short. The men termed experienced believed it physi∣cally impossible; and no arguments were co∣gent enough to convince them of the contrary: so that, they leaving the task to mock patriots and enthusiasts, a fresh odium has been thrown on principles, which, notwithstanding are gain∣ing ground. Things must be left to their natural course; and the accelerating progress of truth promises to demonstrate what no arguments have hitherto been able to prove.</P>
<P>The foundation of liberty was laid in the de∣claration of rights; the first three articles of which contain the great principles of natural, political, and civil liberty.—First, that men are born, and alway continue, free, and equal in respect to their rights:—civil distinctions, there∣fore, can be founded only on public utility. Se∣condly, the end of all political associations is the
<PB N="253" REF="029916_0262_0FE30BEAF524A8F8"/>
preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man: which rights are—liberty, pro∣perty, security, and resistance of oppression. Thirdly, the nation is the source of all sovereign∣ty: no body of men, no individual, can then be entitled to any authority, which is not derived from it. The first article, establishing the equality of man, strikes at the root of all useless distinc∣tions:—the second, securing his rights against oppression, maintains his dignity:—and the third, acknowledging the sovereignty of the nation, con∣firms the authority of the people.—These are the essential points of a good government: and it is only necessary when these points are ascertained by a nation, and solemnly ratified in the hearts of its citizens, to take care in the formation of a political system, to provide against the abuse of the executive part; whilst equal caution should be observed, not to destroy its efficiency, as on that depend its justice, vigour, and promp∣titude. The other articles are explanatory of the nature and intent of these rights, and ought to have had more attention paid to them, when the structure was raised, to which they served as a basis.</P>
<P>Whilst defining the authority of the king, or rather determining, that he should have no au∣thority, unless the option of disturbing the legis∣lation deserve that name, they debated the ques∣tion of two chambers with equal inconsideration, and all the puerile self-sufficiency of ignorance. The opposers of two chambers, without allow∣ing, that there was any political wisdom in ap∣pointing one house of representatives to recon∣sider the resolves of the other, ridiculed the idea
<PB N="254" REF="029916_0263_0FE2A26DE1E546D0"/>
of a balance of power, and instanced the abuses of the English government to give force to their objections. At the same time fearing, that the nobles of the court would contend for an here∣ditary senate, similar to the British house of peers; or, at least, for a seat during life, para∣mount to the representatives who they determined should be elected every two years; they sought to bring the business to a speedy issue. The very division of the nobility served to hasten it, and strengthened the arguments of the popular mem∣bers; who finding that they could rely on the concurrence of the parish priests, whose wishes in favour of the unity of the assembly were quickly betrayed by the opinions of their lead∣ing orators, demanded the decision of a question, that had been agitated in the most tumultuous ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</P>
<P>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abeau wished to prove, that the decision of the question respecting the permanency of the assembly had prejudged that of the two cham∣bers; and the plan of a senate proposed by the constitutional committee only excited fresh ap∣prehensions, that the ancient hydra would again rear its head. They represented this senate as the cradle of a new aristocracy; as a dangerous counterpoize to popular violence, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it would still foster the prejudices, which produced inequalities amongst men, and give continual play to the overbearing passions, that had hitherto d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣graded mankind. And to shew previously their en∣tire disinterestedness, as well as fear of allowing the exercise of power to become familiar, much less necessary to any members of the community, they unanimously voted, that for each legislature,
<PB N="255" REF="029916_0264_0FE30BEC7954AA90"/>
the name given to the meeting of the representa∣tives, a total change of the deputies should take place.</P>
<P>The very nobility, in fact, were far from be∣ing united in support of two chambers. The order was a numerous one: and to establish an equality of privileges, it was necessary, that they should all concur to elect the upper chamber, as the representatives of the whole body; whilst the nobles of the court, and of the ancient houses, secretly indulged the hope of establishing a peerage; which would not only raise them above the commons, but keep at a proper dis∣tance the upstart nobility, with whom they had heretofore impatiently jostled. There was even another cause of jealousy: for it was presumed, that the forty-seven nobles, who first joined the assembly, would now be rewarded. In short, the idle fears and more contemptible vanity of the different parties now operated so much in favour of an indivisible senate, that the question was decided by a great majority, to the entire satisfaction of the public, who were almost as eager for one chamber, as averse to the <HI>veto.</HI></P>
<P>The deputies, who opposed the upper chamber to promote the good of society, did it from a belief, that it would be the asylum of a new aristocracy; and from a total ignorance, or ob∣scurity of ideas, respecting its utility. Whilst the oppressions of the feudal system being still pre∣sent to the minds of the people, they considered a division of the legislative body as inconsistent with the freedom and equality they were taught to expect as the prime blessings of a new con∣stitution. The very mention of <HI>two chambers</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="029916_0265_0FE30C29C7FB7118"/>
carried them back to the old dispute, respecting the negative of the different orders; and seemed to subvert the revolution. Such fears, degene∣rating into weakness, can only be accounted for by recollecting the many cruel thraldoms, from which they had so recently escaped. Besides, the remembrance of their former servitude, and the resentment excited by the late struggle to prove they were men, created in their enthusiastic imaginations such a multitude of horrors, and fantastic images of new dangers, as did not al∣low them to exercise the full powers of their reason. So that to convince them of the pro∣priety of a new institution, and heat the support∣ers of it, nothing more was necessary, than to show that it was the very reverse of those main∣tained by the partizans of the old government.</P>
<P>The wisdom of giving to the executive part of a government an absolute <HI>veto</HI> might very justly have been questioned; as it seems to be giving a power to one man to counteract the will of a whole people—an absurdity too gross to merit refutation. Still, whilst crowns are a necessary bauble to please the multitude, it is also neces∣sary, that their dignity should be supported, in order to prevent an overweening aristocracy from concentrating all authority in themselves. This seems to have been expedient, likewise, as long as the manners of barbarians remained: as savages are naturally pleased with glass and beads, in proportion as they afford a striking contrast to the rude materials of their own fa∣brication.</P>
<P>In the progressive influence of knowledge on manners, both dress and governments appear to
<PB N="257" REF="029916_0266_0FE30B435DFAAEC0"/>
be acquiring simplicity; it may therefore be in∣ferred, that as the people attain dignity of cha∣racter, their amusements will flow from a more rational source than the pageantry of kings, or the view of the fopperies exhibited at courts. If these have been supported hitherto by childish ignorance, they seem to be losing their influence, as the understanding of the world approaches to manhood: for, as they grow wiser, the people will look for the solid advantages of society; and watching wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sufficient vigilance their own interest, the <HI>veto</HI> of the executive branch of the government would become perfectly useless; though in the hands of an unprincipled, bold chief magistrate, it might prove a dangerous in∣strument. In forming representative plan of government it appears necessary then to take care only, that it be so constructed, as to prevent hasty decisions; or the carrying into laws dan∣gerous▪ impolitic measures, which have been ur∣ged by popular decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, who are too apt to gain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ascendancy in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> numerous assembly. Until the principles of governments become simplified, and a knowledge of them be disseminated, it is to be fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, that popular assemblies will often be infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nced by the fascinating charms of eloquence: and as it is possible for a man to be eloquent without being either wise or virtuous, it is but a common precaution of prudence in the framers of a constitution, to provide some check to the evil.</P>
<P>Besides, it is very probable, in the same state of reason, that a faction may arise, which will controul the assembly; and, acting contrary to the dictates of wisdom, throw the state into the
<PB N="258" REF="029916_0267_0FE30B38354FCBF0"/>
most dangerous convulsions of anarchy; conse∣quently, it ought to form a primary object with a constituting assembly, to prevent, by some salu∣tary contrivance, the mischief flowing from such sources. The obvious preventative is a second chamber, or senate, which would not, it is most likely, be under the influence of the same faction; and it is at least certain, that its decisions would not be directed by the same orators. The advan∣tage would be more certain if business were not conducted in the two chambers in a similar man∣ner. Thus by making the most numerous assem∣bly the most active, the other would have more time to weigh the probable consequence of any act or decree, which would prevent those incon∣veniences; or, at least, many of them, the conse∣quence of haste or faction.</P>
<P>This system in an old government is sus∣ceptible of improvement. The minds of young men generally having more fire, activity, and in∣vention, it would be politically wise to restrict the age of the senators to thirty-five, or forty years; at which period of life they most likely would have gone through a certain routine of business; and become more sage and steady, they would be better calculated to decide respecting the policy, or wisdom of the acts of the chamber of representatives.</P>
<P>It is true, France was in such a state at the time of the revolution, that a like improvement could not have been instantly carried into execu∣tion, because the aristocratical influence was just∣ly to be dreaded. The constituting assembly then should have remained indivisible; and as the members became in some measure acquainted
<PB N="259" REF="029916_0268_0FE30BEDFAFF8018"/>
with legislative business, they would have pre∣pared senators for the upper chamber. All the fu∣ture legislatures being divided into two chambers, a house of representatives, and a senate, the mem∣bers of the national assembly might have been permitted to be elected for the senate, though they should not have attained the age prescribed; for the restriction needed not to have taken place until the government found its level, and even then, the members of the preceding house of re∣presentatives might have been allowed to be re∣turned for the senate.</P>
<P>It has been a common remark of moralists, that we are the least acquainted with our own characters. This has been literally the case with the French: for certainly no people stand in such great need of a check; and, totally desti∣tute of experience in political science, it must have been clear to all men of sound understand∣ing, that some such plan alone would have ena∣bled them to avoid many fatal errors.</P>
<P>The first efforts of the national assembly were truly magnanimous; but the character of the men was too light, to maintain the same hero∣ism, when not warmed by passion—too giddy, to support with grave dignity the splendor of sud∣den glory. Their vanity was also unbounded; and their false estimate of disinterestedness of conduct, whilst they betrayed puerility of senti∣ment, was not among the least of the misfor∣tunes, which have befallen that unhappy country. Their hearts had been too long sophisticated, to suggest the best mode of communicating free∣dom to millions; and their heads were still less calculated to lay down a practicable plan of go∣vernment,
<PB N="260" REF="029916_0269_0FE30C2B4E25B440"/>
adapted to the state of knowledge of the age. So much so, that they seem to have selected from books only the regulations proper for a period of perfect civilization.</P>
<P>The revolutions of states ought to be gradua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for during violent or material changes it is not so much the wisdom of measures, as the popularity they acquire by being adapted to the foibles of the great body of the community, which gives them success.—Men are most easily led away by the ingenious arguments, that dwell on the equality of man, and these are always em∣ployed by the different leaders of popular go∣vernments.</P>
<P>Whilst the most ingenious theorists, or despe∣rate partizans of the people, take advantage of this infirmity of our nature, the consequences must sometimes prove destructive to society, if they do not end in the most dreadful anarchy. For when the members of a state are not direct∣ed by practical knowledge, every one produces a plan of polity, till the confusion becomes general, and the nation plunges into wretchedness, pur∣suing the schemes of those philosophers of genius, who, advancing before their age, have sketched the model of a perfect system of government. Thus it happened in France, that Hume's idea of a perfect commonwealth, the adoption of which would be eligible only when civilization has arrived at a much greater degree of perfec∣tion, and knowledge is more generally diffused than at the present period, was nevertheless cho∣sen as the model of their new government, with a few exceptions, by the constituent assembly: which choice doubtless proceeded from the mem∣bers
<PB N="261" REF="029916_0270_0FE30BF621841FB8"/>
not having had an opportunity to acquire a knowledge of practical liberty. Some of the members, it is true, alluded to the improve∣ments made by the Americans on the plan of the English constitution; but the great majority, despising experience, were for forming at once, a system much more perfect. And this self-suffi∣ciency has produced those dreadful outrages, and attacks, made by the anarchists of that country on personal liberty, property, and what∣ever else society holds sacre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>These melancholy considerations seem to me to afford irrefragable arguments to prove that it is necessary for all governments, which have for their object the happiness of the people, to make the power of altering peaceably a fundamental principle of their constitution.</P>
<P>Still, if the attempt to carry prematurely into execution the sublime theory, which has occupi∣ed some of the best heads to form, have afforded an opportunity to superficial politicians, to con∣demn it as absurd and chimerical, because it has not been attended with immediate success, the advocates for the extension of truth and reason ought not to despair. For when we contem∣plate the slow improvement, that has been made in the science of government; and, that even the system of the British constitution was considered, by some of the most enlightened ancients, as the sublimest theory the human mind was able to conceive, though not reducible to practice, they should not relax in their endeavours to bring to maturity a polity more simple—which promises more equal freedom, and general happiness to mankind.</P>

<P>Observations on the veto. The women offer up their ornaments to the public. Debate whether the Spanish branch of the Bourbons could reign in France.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the national assembly had deter∣mined, that the legislative body should consist of one house, to be renewed every two years, they appear to have had some suspicion of the impolicy of the decree; but not allowing themselves time to comprehend the use of a senate taken from the body of the people, they attempted to silence the fears, some moderate men entertained, of the bad consequences which might arise from the deci∣sions of an impetuous assembly without a check, by assuring them, that the delay, the <HI>veto</HI> would occasion, was a sufficient counterpoise. They represented the king's <HI>veto</HI> as the negative arche∣type of the national will; adding, that it would be the duty of the sovereign to examine with vigilance the justice or wisdom of their decrees; and by the exertion of his power prevent the hasty establishment of any laws inimical to the
<PB N="263" REF="029916_0272_0FE30BF8299297E8"/>
public good. So easy is it for men to frame arguments to cover the homely features of their own folly—so dangerous is it to follow a refined theory, however feasible it may appear, when the happiness of an empire depends on its success; and so inconsiderately did the national assembly act in this great business, that they did not wait even to determine the precise meaning of the word <HI>sanction.</HI></P>
<P>If the king then represented the negative will of the nation, which the assembly pretended to say he did; and if he possessed the supreme wisdom and moderation necessary to guaranty that will, which supposing he did not, it was a folly too gross to require any comment; in the name of common sense—why was his <HI>veto suspensive?</HI></P>
<P>The truth is obvious,—the assembly had not sufficient courage to take a decided part.—They knew, that the king and court could not be de∣pended upon; yet they had not the magnanimity to give them up altogether. They justly dreaded the depravity and influence of the nobles; but they had not the sagacity to model the govern∣ment in such a manner, as would have defeated their future conspiracies, and rendered their power nugatory; though they had the example of the Thirteen States of America before them, from which they had drawn what little practical knowledge of liberty they possessed. —But, no; the regeneration of France must lead to the re∣generation of the whole globe. The political system of Frenchmen must serve as a model for all the free states in the universe!—<HI>Vive la liberté</HI>
<PB N="264" REF="029916_0273_0FE30C33745EAD60"/>
—was the only cry—and <HI>la bagatelle</HI> entered into every debate—whilst the whole nation, wild with joy, was hailing the commencement of the golden age.</P>
<P>The women too, not to be outdone by the Roman dames, came forward, during this dis∣cussion, to sacrifice their ornaments for the good of their country. And this fresh example of public spirit was also given by the third estate; for they were the wives and daughters of artizans, who first renounced their female pride—or rather made one kind of vanity take place of another. However, the offering was made with theatrical grace; and the lively applauses of the assembly were reiterated with great gallantry.</P>
<P>Another interruption had likewise occurred, of a more serious nature.—For after they had decreed with an unanimous voice—That <HI>the per∣son of the king is sacred and inviolable,</HI> that <HI>the throne is indivisible;</HI> that <HI>the crown is hereditary, in the males of the reigning family, according to the order of primogeniture, to the perpetual exclusion of females,</HI> a deputy proposed, that, before going any further, they should decide
<Q>whether the branch reigning in Spain could reign in France, though it had renounced the crown of the latter kingdom by the most authentic treaties.</Q></P>
<P>Several of the most respectable members re∣presented, that this was a delicate business with which it was impolitic to meddle at present, and as unnecessary as imprudent. Mirabeau was of this opinion; but when he found, that much time was likely to be consumed in idle debates, and contemptible vehemence, he endeavoured to cut
<PB N="265" REF="029916_0274_0FE30BF9AD471850"/>
the matter short by moving a new question— namely,
<Q>that no one could reign in France, who was not born in the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>But nothing could prevent the agitation of the same subject for three days; prolonged either by the fears of one party, or the desire of another to embroil the assembly, and retard the forma∣tion of a constitution. Mirabeau made several severe, but just remarks, on the character of Louis XIV. whose ambition had produced the dispute; and reprobated with dignity, their man∣ner of treating a people, as if they were the pro∣perty of a chief. Should any difficulty arise, in future, he maintained, that the nation would then be competent of judge of it; and had an equal right to determine the succession, as to choose a new system of government.</P>
<P>The assembly, though generally so inattentive to the suggestions of sound policy, despising moderation, became now beyond measure scru∣pulous. Some deputies represented the danger of alienating to the English the commerce of Spain, by disgusting it's court; and others anti∣cipated the intestine troubles, which a doubt respecting the unchangeable descent of the crown might produce. At last they resolved to add to the declaration, respecting the monarchy, that they did not mean to make the decree, <HI>by any means prejudge the effect of renunciations.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst they were settling these things in the assembly the refractory nobles and clergy were intriguing to prevent the king from giving his assent to the promulgation of the decrees of the 4th of August. The royal <HI>sanction</HI> had been de∣manded before the import of the word was
<PB N="266" REF="029916_0275_0FE30C35BA2F08E8"/>
scanned; and the court taking advantage of this ambiguity, made the king pretend he misunder∣stood the demand; and imagined that they merely asked for his opinion, and not to know his will. Instead then of a simple monosyllable, he replied by a memoir. He approved, in general, of the spirit of these determinations; but entered into an investigation, more or less copious, of every article. He weighed the advantages and incon∣veniences; and pointed out precautions and modifications, which appeared to him necessary to realize the former and prevent the latter. He objected particularly to the abolition of some rents; which, though substitutes for personal ser∣vice, were now actual property; he suggested some difficulty that might attend the abolition of tithes; and hinted, that the German princes, who had possessions in Alsace, secured to them by treaty, might resent the infringement. In answer to the last objection, a member observed, that the in∣habitants of this province, who had long been sinking under the weight of these privileges, daily augmented by the connivance of ministers, had inserted an article in their instructions ex∣pressly demanding the abolition of this destructive system; which reduced them to despair, and forced them continually to emigrate. Several of the deputies wished to have the king's reply re∣ferred to the examination of a committee; yet, a great majority insisting, that the decrees of the 4th of August were not new laws, to be carried into force by the executive power, but abuses which it was absolutely necessary to clear away before the formation of a constitution, demanded their immediate promulgation. Accordingly they
<PB N="267" REF="029916_0276_0FE30BFBCDC7A620"/>
resolved, that the president should wait on the king and request him immediately to order the promulgation of the decrees; assuring him at the same time, that the national assembly, when con∣sidering each article separately, would pay the most scrupulous attention to the observations com∣municated by his majesty.</P>
<P>This imperative petition had the desired effect, and the king acceded, the 20th of September, to their will, sanctioning decrees he did not ap∣prove.</P>
<P>This was the first glaring instance of the con∣stituting assembly acting contrary to it's preten∣sions; and the king, long in the habit of dissemb∣ling, always yielding to the pressure of remon∣strances, no matter from what quarter they came, with criminal insincerity acknowledging himself a cypher, laid the foundation of his own insig∣nificancy, by ordering the promulgation of de∣crees, which he believed were incompatible with justice, and might involve the French monarchy in disagreeable disputes with foreign princes, when peace was particularly necessary to calm it's inter∣nal convulsions.</P>
<P>If a chief magistrate be of any consequence to a state, his wisdom ought to appear in the dignity and firmness of his actions.—But, if he be con∣sidered as the fountain of justice and honour, and do not possess the abilities and magnanimity of a common man, in what a wretched light must he be viewed by the eyes of discernment and common sense?—And, if the framers of a constitution create a power that must continually act at variance with itself, they not only undermine the pillars of their own fabric, but they insert the
<PB N="268" REF="029916_0277_0FE30C37420F11B0"/>
scion of a disease the most destructive to truth and morals.</P>
<P>After complying with this compulsatory re∣quest, Louis, who finding that he was left with∣out any share of power seems to have thought very little of his <HI>suspensive veto,</HI> determined to play a part that would give an air of sincerity to his present conduct, whilst his object was secretly to favour the efforts of the counter-revolutionists; and if possible effect his own escape.—But, in the mean time, he endeavoured to make such use of it as might prevent the total derangement of the old system, without unveiling his secret views, and intentions. It is difficult to determine which was the most reprehensible, the folly of the assembly, or the duplicity of the king. If Louis were without character, and controlled by a court without virtue, it amount∣ed to a demonstration, that every insidious mean would be employed by the courtiers to reinstate the old government; and recover, if possible, their former splendor and voluptuous ease. For, though they were dispersed, it was notorious to all France, nay, to all Europe, that a constant correspondence was kept up between the differ∣ent parties, and their projects concerted by one of the most intriguing of disappointed men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calonne.</NOTE>. It was obvious, therefore, to Mirabeau, that the king ought to be gained over to the side of the people; and made to consider himself as their benefactor, in order to detach him from the cabal. But in this respect he was unfortunately over-ruled. This mixture of magnanimity, and
<PB N="269" REF="029916_0278_0FE30C02D639D990"/>
timidity, of wisdom, and headstrong folly, dis∣played by the assembly, appears at the first view, to involve such a contradiction, that every person unacquainted with the French character would be ready to call in question the truth of those undeniable facts, which crowd on the heels of each other during the progress of the great events, that formed the revolution. A superficial glance over the circumstances, will not enable us to account for an inconsistency, which bor∣ders on improbability.—We must, on the con∣trary, ever keep in our thoughts, that, whilst they were directed in their political plans by a wild, half comprehended theory, their senti∣ments were still governed by the old chivalrous sense of honour, which diffusing a degree of romantic heroism into all their actions, a false magnanimity would not permit them to question the veracity of a man, on whom they believed they were conferring favours; and for whom they certainly made great allowance, if they did not forgive him for countenancing plots, which tended to undermine their favourite system.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, the characteristic of vanity, to become enamoured with ideas, in proportion as they were remote from its conception, until brought to the mind by causes so natural, as to induce it to believe, that they are the happy and spontaneous flow of its own prolific brain. Their splendor then eclipsing his judgment, the man is hurried on by enthusiasm and self-sufficiency, like a ship at sea, without ballast or helm, by every breath of wind: and, to carry the compa∣rison still further, should a tempest chance to rise in the state, he is swallowed up in the whirl∣pools of confusion, into the very midst of which
<PB N="270" REF="029916_0279_0FE30C38C8380CB8"/>
his conceit has plunged him; as the vessel, that was not prepared to stem the violence of a hur∣ricane, is buried in the raging surge.</P>
<P>The occasions of remarking, that Frenchmen are the vainest men living, often occur, and here it must be insisted on: for no sooner had they taken possession of certain philosophical truths, persuading themselves, that the world was in∣debted to them for the discovery, than they seem to have overlooked every other consideration, but their adoption. Much evil has been the con∣sequence; yet France is certainly highly indebted to the national assembly for establishing many constitutional principles of liberty, which must greatly accelerate the improvement of the public mind, and ultimately produce the perfect govern∣ment that they vainly endeavoured to construct immediately with such fatal precipitation.</P>
<P>The consideration of several other articles of the constitution was continually interrupted, and not more by the variety of business, which came under the cognizance of the assembly, than by the want of a proper arrangement of them. Much time was lost in disputing about the choice of subjects of deliberation; and the order in which they ought to proceed. The business of the day was perpetually obliged to give place to episodical scenes▪ and men, who came prepared to discuss one question, being obliged to turn to another, lost in some measure the benefit of re∣flection, and the energy, so different from the enthusiasm of the moment, with which a man supports a well digested opinion.</P>
<P>Two or three slight debates had arisen on the subject of quartering a thousand men, of the regular troops, at Versailles. The command∣ant
<PB N="271" REF="029916_0280_0FE30C045A52A1D8"/>
of the guards had requested permission of the municipality; pointing out the necessity for the security of the town, the national assembly, and the person of the king. The necessity did not appear so obvious to the public, and, in fact, the demand seemed calculated to provoke the tumults, against which they were so officiously guarding. Mirabeau also observed,
<Q>that the executive power had undoubtedly a right to augment the military sorce, in any particular place, when private information, or urgent cir∣cumstances, appeared to require it; and that the municipality had, likewise, a right to de∣mand the troops they judged necessary; yet he could not help thinking it singular, that the ministers should have entrusted the municipality with a secret, which they did not communicate to the assembly, who might be supposed at least as anxious to take every precaution for the safety of the town and the king's person.</Q>
To these pertinent remarks no attention was paid; and a letter from the mayor of Paris, informing the assembly, that a great number of the districts of the metropolis had remonstrated against the introduction of regular troops into Versailles, to awe the national guards, was equally neglected; whilst a letter to the president, in the name of the king, informing him that he had taken the different measures necessary to prevent any dis∣turbances in the place where the national assem∣bly were sitting, was thrown aside without any comment.</P>
<P>The loan still failing, several individuals made magnificent presents; sacrificing their jewels and plate, to relieve the wants of their country. And
<PB N="272" REF="029916_0281_0FE30C415DF9B0D8"/>
the king sent his rich service t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the mint, in spite of the remonstrances of the assembly.—The dis∣interestedness of this action, it is absurd to talk of benevolence, may fairly be doubted; because, had he escaped, and the escape was then in con∣templation, it would have been confiscated; whilst the voluntary offer was a popular step, which might serve for a little time to cover this design, and turn the attention of the public from the subject of the reinforcement of the guards to the patriotism of the king.</P>
<P>These donations, which scarcely afforded a temporary supply, rather amused than relieved the nation; though they suggested a new plan to the minister. Necker, therefore, incapable of forming any great design for the good of the nation, yet calculating on the general enthusiasm, which pervaded all descriptions and ranks of people, laid before the assembly, the ruinous state of the finances, proposing at the same time, as the only mode of remedying the evil, to require of the citizens a contribution of one-fourth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir income. The assembly was startled by this proposal, but Mirabeau believing that the peo∣ple would now grant whatever their represen∣tatives required, prevailed on the assembly, by a lively representation of the perilous state of the kingdom, to adopt the only plan of salvation which had yet been suggested—insisting, that this was the only expedient to avoid an infamous national bankruptcy.
<Q>Two centuries of depre∣dations and pillage,</Q>

<Q><PB N="273" REF="029916_0282_0FE30C05DC660CD0"/>out the rich, that the sacrifice may fall on the fewer citizens; but determine quickly! There are two thousand notables, who have sufficient property to restore order to your finances, and peace and prosperity to the kingdom. Strike; immolate without pity those victims!—preci∣pitate them into the abyss—it is going to close on them—ye draw back, with horror—ye men! pusillanimous and inconsistent!—and see ye not in decreeing a bankruptcy, or, which is still more contemptible, rendering it inevitable, ye are sullied by an act a thousand times more criminal?</Q></P>
<P>But it is impossible to do justice to this burst of eloquence, in a traslation; besides, the most energetic appeals to the passions always loses half their dignity, or, perhaps, appear to want the support of reason, when they are coolly per∣used—Nothing produces conviction like passion— it seems the ray from heaven, that enlightens as it warms.—Yet the effect once over, something like a fear of having been betrayed into folly clings to the mind it has most strongly influ∣enced; and an obscure sense of shame lowers the spirits that were wound up too high.</P>
<P>From the whole tenor of this speech it is clear, that Mirabeau was in earnest; and that he had fired his imagination, by considering this plan as an act of heroism, that would ennoble the revolution, and reflect lasting honour on the national assembly. In this extemporary flow of eloquence, probably the most simple and noble of modern times, he mixed none of the rhetoric which frequently entered into his studied com∣positions; for his periods were often artfully
<PB N="274" REF="029916_0283_0FE30C4328FB64E0"/>
formed;—but it was the art of a man of genius. He proposed to the assembly to address their constituents on this occasion; and he was ac∣cordingly requested to prepare an address for their consideration.</P>
<P>His address to the nation is, indeed, a master∣piece; yet, being written to persuade, and not spoken to carry a point immediately, and over∣whelm opposition, there is more reasoning in it; and more artful, though less forcible, appeals to the passions. And, though this expedient ap∣pears to be the most wild that folly could have blundered upon, the arguments ought to be pre∣ferved with which it was glossed over.</P>
<P>To expect a man to give the fourth of what he lived on; and that in the course of fifteen months, leaving it to him to make the estimate, was ex∣pecting that from virtue, which could only have been produced by enthusiasm. All the an∣cient acts of heroism were excited by the spur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> present danger; and of this kind of virtue the French were equally capable; yet, though the plan afforded them an opportunity to give a splendid proof of their patriotism, it by no means answered; because, it being the effect rather of temper than of principle, selfishness had time to find a plausible pretext to elude it; and vanity is seldom willing to hide its good works in the common measure.</P>
<P>As the removal of the national assembly to Paris forms an epocha in the history of the revolution, it seems proper to close this chapter with Mira∣beau's address.</P>
<P><Q>The deputies of the national assembly suspend a while their labours to lay before their consti∣tuents
<PB N="275" REF="029916_0284_0FE30C075EB0A4C8"/>
the wants of the state, and to call upon their patriotism to second the measures, which a country in danger demands.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It were betraying you to dissemble. Two ways are open—the nation may stride forward to the most glorious pre-eminence, or fall head∣long into a gulph of misfortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A great revolution, the very plan of which some months ago would have appeared chime∣rical, has taken place amongst us. Accelerated by unforeseen circumstances, the momentum has suddenly overthrown our ancient institu∣tions. Without allowing us time to prop what must be preserved, or to replace what ought to be destroyed, it has at once surrounded us with ruins.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our efforts to support the government are fruitless, a fatal numbness cramps all its powers. The public revenue is no more; and credit cannot gain strength at a moment, when our fears equal our hopes.—This spring of social power unbent, has weakened the whole ma∣chine; men and things, resolution, courage, and even virtue itself, have lost their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ension. If your concurrence do not speedily restore life and motion to the body-politic, the grandest re∣volutions, perishing with the hopes it generated, will mingle again in the chaos, whence noble exertions have drawn it; and they, who shall still pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an unconquerable love of liberty, will refuse to unworthy citizens the disgrace∣ful consolation of resuming their setters.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Since your deputies have buried all their ri∣valry, all their contending interests, in a just and necessary uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assembly has
<PB N="276" REF="029916_0285_0FE30C44AB0CF348"/>
laboured to establish equal laws for the com∣mon safety. It has repaired great errors, and broken the links of countless thraldoms, which degraded human nature: it has kindled the flame of joy and hope in the bosoms of the peo∣ple, the creditors of earth and nature, whose dignity has been so long tarnished, whose hearts have been so long discouraged: it has restored the long obscured equality of Frenchmen, esta∣blished their common right to serve the state, to enjoy its protection, to merit its rewards: in short, conformably to your instructions, it is gradually erecting on the immutable basis of the imprescriptible rights of man, a constitution mild as nature, lasting as justice, and the imper∣fections of which, the consequence of the inex∣perience of its authors, will easily be repaired. We have had to contend with the inveterate prejudices of ages, whilst harassed by the thousand uncertainties which accompany great changes. Our successors will have the beaten track of experience before them; we have had only the compass of theory to guide us through the pathless desert. They may labour peace∣ably; though we have had to bear up against storms. They will know their rights, and the limits of their power; we have had to recover the one, and to fix the other. They will consolidate our work—they will surpass us—What a recompence! Who shall dare, mean while, to assign limits to the grandeur of France? Who is not elevated by hope? Who does not felicitate himself on being a citizen of its empire?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="029916_0286_0FE30B401A772580"/><Q>Such, however, is the crisis of the finances, that the state is threatened with dissolution be∣fore this grand order of things can find its centre. The cessation of the revenue has ba∣nished specie. A thousand circumstances hasten its exportation. The sources of credit are ex∣hausted; and the wheels of government are almost at a stand. If patriotism then step not forward to the succour of government, our armies, our fleets, our subsistence, our arts, our trade, our agriculture, our national debt, our country itself, will be hurried towards that catastrophe, when she will receive laws only from disorder and anarchy—Liberty would have glanced on our fight, only to disappear for ever, only to leave behind the bitter consci∣ousness, that we did not merit the possession. And to our shame, in the eyes of the universe, the evil could be attributed solely to ourselves. With a soil so fertile, industry so productive, a commerce so flourishing, and such means of prosperity—what is this embarrassment of our finances? Our wants amount not to the ex∣pence of a summer's campaign—and our li∣berty, it is not worth more than those sense∣less struggles, when even victory has proved ruinous?</Q></P>
<P><Q>The present difficulty overcome, far from burdening the people, it will be easy to melio∣rate their condition. Reductions, which need not annihilate luxury; reforms, which will reduce none to indigence; a commutation of the oppressive taxes, an equal assessment of the impost, together with the equilibrium
<PB N="278" REF="029916_0287_0FE30C46FAAA91E8"/>
which must be restored between our revenue and our expenditure; an order that must be rendered permanent by our vigilant superin∣tendency.—These are the scattered objects of your consolatory perspective.—They are not the unsubstantial coinage of fancy; but real, palpa∣ble forms—hopes capable of proof things subordinate to calculation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But our actual wants—the paralysis of our public strength, the hundred and sixty extra millions necessary for this year, and the next— What can be done? The prime minister has proposed as the great lever of the effort, which is to decide the kingdom's fate, a contribution proportional to the income of each citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Between the necessity of providing instantly for the exigencies of the public, and the impossi∣bility of investigating so speedily the plan before us; fearing to enter into a labyrinth of calcula∣tions, and seeing nothing contrary to our duty in the ministers proposal, we have obeyed the dictates of our consciences, presuming they would be yours. The attachment of the nation to the author of the plan, appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to us a a pledge of it's success; and we confided in his long experience, rather than trust to the gui∣dance of our speculative opinions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To the conscience of every citizen is left the valuation of his income: thus the effect of the measure depends on your own patriotism. When the nation is bursting from the nothingness of servitude to the creation of liberty—when policy is about to concur with nature in unfolding the inconceivable grandeur of her future destiny—
<PB N="279" REF="029916_0288_0FE30B35115D6770"/>
shall vile passions oppose her greatness? interest stay her flight? and the salvation of the state weigh less than a personal contribution?</Q></P>
<P><Q>No; such madness is not in nature; the passions even do not listen to such treacherous reckonings. If the revolution, which has given us a country, cannot rouse some Frenchmen out of the torpor of indifference, at least the tran∣quility of the kingdom, the only pledge of their individual security, will influence them. No; it is not in the whirl of universal overthrow, in the degradation of tutelary authority, when a crowd of indigent citizens, shut out from the work-shops, will be clamouring for impotent pity; when the soldiery disbanded will be forming itself into hungry gangs of armed plunderers, when property will be violated with impunity, and the very existence of individuals menaced —terror and grief waiting at the door of every family—it is not amidst such compli∣cated wretchedness, that these cruel and selfish men will enjoy in peace the hoards which they denied their country. The only distinction that awaits them, in the general wreck, will be the opprobrium they deserve, or the useless re∣morse that will corrode the inmost recesses of their hearts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ah! how many recent proofs have we of the public spiritedness, which renders all success so easy! With what rapidity was formed the national militia, those legions of citizens armed for the defence of the country, the preservation of tranquility, and the maintenance of the laws! A generous emulation has beamed on all sides. Villages, towns, provinces, have considered
<PB N="280" REF="029916_0289_0FE30C4C74B466B0"/>
their privileges as odious distinctions, and soli∣cited the honour of depriving themselves of peculiar advantages, to enrich their country. You know it: time was not allowed to draw up the mutual concessions, dictated by a purely patriotic sentiment, into decrees; so impatient was every class of citizens to restore to the great family whatever endowed some of it's members to the prejudice of others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Above all, since the embarrassment of our finances, patriotic contributions have increased. From the throne, the majesty of which a bene∣ficent prince exalts by his virtues, has emanated the most striking example.—O thou, so justly the dearly beloved of thy people—king—citizen —man of worth! it was thine to cast a glance over the magnificence that surrounded thee, and to convert it into national resources. The objects of luxury which thou hast sacrificed, have added new lustre to thy dignity; and whilst the love of the French for thy sacred-per∣son makes them murmur at the privation, their sensibility applauds thy magnanimity; and their generosity will repay thy beneficence by the return it covets, by an imitation of thy virtues, by pursuing thy course in the career of public utility.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How much wealth, congealed by oftentation into useless heaps, shall melt into flowing streams of prosperity! How much the prudent economy of individuals might contribute to the restora∣tion of the kingdom! How many treasures, which the piety of our forefathers accumulated on the altars of our temples, will forsake their obscure cells without changing their sacred des∣tination!
<PB N="281" REF="029916_0290_0FE30C0DE79F4F80"/>
"This I set apart, in times of pros∣perity;"</Q>
says religion;
<Q>it is sitting that I dis∣pense it in the day of adversity. It was not for myself—a borrowed lustre adds nothing to my greatness—it was for you, and the state, that I levied this honourable tribute on the virtues of your forefathers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Who can avoid being affected by such ex∣amples? What a moment to display our resour∣ces, to invoke the aid of every corner of the empire!—O prevent the shame, with which the violation of our engagements, our most sacred engagements, would stain the birth of freedom! Prevent those dreadful shocks, which, in over∣turning the most solid institutions, and shatter∣ing the most established fortunes, would leave France covered with the sad ruins of a shameful hurricane. How mistaken are those, who at a certain distance from the capital contemplate not the links, which connect public faith with national prosperity, and with the social con∣tract! They who pronounce the infamous term bankruptcy, are they not rather a herd of ferocious beasts, than a society of men just and free? Where is the Frenchman who will dare to look his fellow citizens in the face, when his conscience shall upbraid him with having con∣tributed to empoison the existence of millions of his fellow creatures? Are we the nation to whose honour it's enemies bear witness, who are about to sully the proud distinction by a BANKRUPTCY?—Shall we give them cause to say, we have only recovered our liberty and strength to commit, without shuddering, crimes which paled even the cheek of despotism?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="029916_0291_0FE30C4F197E0BF8"/><Q>Would it be any excuse to protest, that this execrable mischief was not premeditated? Ah! no: the cries of the victims, whom we shall scatter over Europe, will drown our voice. Act then!—Be your measures swift, strong, sure. Dispel the cloud, that lowers over our heads, the gloom of which sheds terror into the hearts of the creditors of France.—If it burst, the de∣vastation of our national resources will be more tremendous than the terrible plague, which has lately ravaged our provinces.</Q></P>
<P><Q>How will our courage in the exercise of the functions, your have confided to us, be renew∣ed! With what vigour shall we labour in form∣ing the constitution, when secured from inter∣ruption! We have sworn to save our country— judge of our anguish, whilst it trembled on the verge of destruction. A momentary sacrifice is sufficient; a sacrifice offered to the public good, and not to the encroachments of covetousness. And is this easy expiation of the faults and blunders of a period, stigmatized by political servitude, above our strength? Think of the price which has been paid for liberty by other nations, who have shown themselves worthy of it:—for this, rivers of blood have streamed —long years of woe, and horrid civil wars, have every where preceded the glorious birth! —Of us nothing is required, but a pecuniary sacrifice—and even this vulgar offering is not an in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing gift:—it will return into our bosom, to enrich our cities, our fields; augment∣ing our national glory and prosperity.</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Reflections on the new mode o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aising suppli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. No just System of taxation yet established. Paper money. Necessity of gradual reform.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE task certainly was very difficult, at this crisis, for a minister to give satisfaction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the people, and yet supply the wants of the state; for it was not very likely that the public, who had been exclaiming against the incessant de∣mands of the old government, would have been pleased with new burdens, or patiently endured them. Still it is always the height of folly in a financier, to attempt to supply the exigencies of government by any but specific and certain means: for such vague measures will ever pro∣duce a <HI>deficit,</HI> the consequences of which are most pernicious to public credit and private comfort.</P>
<P>A man, who has a precise sum to live upon, generally takes into his estimate of expences a certain part of his income as due to the govern∣ment, for the protection and social advantages it secures him. This proportion of his income be∣ing commonly the same from period to period, he lays it by for that particular purpose, and con∣tentedly enjoys the remainder. But, should a weak minister, or a capricious government, call on him for an additional sum, because the taxes have proved unproductive, either through the
<PB N="284" REF="029916_0293_0FE2A26AB1D8BE00"/>
inability of some o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he members of the state, or that they were laid on articles of consumption, and the consumption has not been equal to the calculation; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not only deranges his schemes of domestic economy, but may be the cause of the most serious inconvenience.</P>
<P>A man who has a limited income, and a large family, is not only obliged to be very industrious to support them, but he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> likewise necessitated to make all his arrangements with the greatest circumspection and exactness; because a trifling loss, by involving him in debt, might lead to his ruin, including that of his family. The rich man, indeed, seldom thinks of these most cruel misfortunes; for a few pounds, more or less, are of no real importance to him. Yet the poor man, nay even the man of moderate fortune, is liable to have his whole scheme of life broken by a circumstance of this kind, and all his future days embittered by a perpetual struggle with pecuniary vexations.</P>
<P>Governments, which ought to protect, and not oppress mankind, cannot be too regular in their demands; for the manner of levying taxes is of the highest importance to political economy, and the happiness of individuals. No govern∣ment has yet established a just system of taxa∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Holland almost all the taxes are collected in the shape of excise.</P>
<P>In France, formerly, the taxes were generally internal; but, since the mode established of making a revenue of 300,000,000<HI>l.</HI> by the land and house tax part of the 580,000,000<HI>l.</HI> estimated to be the peace establishment, it appears, that this was too great a proportion to be obtain∣ed in that way. Hence the revenue of France has lately faile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a great degree.</P>
<P>In America the taxes of the Federal government have been lately established solely on the customs, that is to say, on goods imported. These operate two ways; en∣couraging home manufactures, and discouraging the ma∣nufactures of other countries.</P>
<P>Great Britain has levied her revenue on customs both inwards and outwards; on excise, principally internal; on stamps, which operate both internally and externally; and on fixed objects, as well as internal consumption, (as salt).</P></NOTE>: for in every country the expences of
<PB N="285" REF="029916_0294_0FE30CC1F4A1FFC0"/>
government have fallen unequally on the citizens; and, perhaps, it is not possible to render them perfectly equal, but by laying all the taxes on land, the mother of every production.</P>
<P>In this posture of affairs the enthusiasm of the French in the cause of liberty might have been turned to the advantage of a new and permanent system of finance. An able, bold minister, who possessed the confidence of the nation, might have recommended with success the taking of the national property under the direct management of the assembly; and then endeavouring to raise a loan on that property, he would have given respectability to the new government, by imme∣diately procuring the supplies indispensably ne∣cessary not only to keep it, but to put it in motion.</P>
<P>In times of civil commotion, or during a ge∣neral convulsion, men who have money, and they are commonly most timid and cautious, are very apt to take care of it, even at the expence of their interest; and, therefore, it was to be presumed, that the mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed men of France would not have been very ready to subscribe to the dif∣ferent
<PB N="286" REF="029916_0295_0FE30C8FB1F16E50"/>
loans proposed by the minister, unless the security had been obvious, or the speculative ad∣vantages exorbitant. But if Necker, whom the prudent usurer adored as his tutelar god, had said to the nation
<Q>there is a property worth 4,700,000,000<HI>l.</HI> independent of the property of the emigrants, take it into your immediate possession; and, whilst the sales are going on, give it as a guarantee for the loan you want. This just and dignified measure will not only relieve your present necessities, but it will be sufficient to enable you to fulfil great part of your former engagements.</Q>
There would have been then no need of the eloquence of Mira∣beau; reason would have done the business; and men, attending to their own interest, would have promoted the public good, without having their heads turned giddy by romantic flights of he∣roism.</P>
<P>The immediate and incessant wants of a state must always be supplied; prudence therefore, requires, that the directors of the finances should rather provide by anticipation for its wants than suffer a <HI>deficit.</HI> The government being once in arrears, additional taxes become indispensable to bring forward the balance, or the nation must have recourse to paper notes; an expedient, as experience has shown, always to be dreaded, because by encreasing the debt it only extends the evil. And this increasing debt, like a ball of snow, gathering as it rolls, soon attains a wonderful magnitude. Every state, which has unavoidably accumulated its debt, ought, provided th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se at the helm wish to preserve the government, and extend the security and com∣forts
<PB N="287" REF="029916_0296_0FE30CC8DC7CFBE8"/>
of its citizens, to take every just measure to render the interest secure, and to fund the principal; for as it augments, like the petrifying mass, it stands in the way of all improvement, spreading the chilling miseries of poverty around —till the evil baffling all expedients, a mighty crash produces a new order of things, over∣whelming with the ruins of the old, thousands of innocent victims.</P>
<P>The precious metals have been considered as the best of all possible signs of value to facilitate the exchange of commodities to supply our reci∣procal wants: and they will ever be necessary to our comfort, whilst by the common consent of mankind they are the standard of exchange. Gold and silver have a specific value, because it is not easy to accumulate them beyond a certain quantity. Paper, on the contrary, is a dangerous expedient, except under a well established go∣vernment: and even then the business ought to be conducted with great moderation and saga∣city.—Perhaps it would be wise, that its extent should be consistent with the commerce of the country, and the quantity of species actually in it—But it is the spirit of commerce to stretch credit too far. The notes, also, which are issued by a state before its government is well establish∣ed, will certainly be depreciated; and in propor∣tion as they grow precarious, the gold and silver, which was formerly in circulation will vanish, and every article of trade, and all the comforts of life will bear a higher price.</P>
<P>These are considerations, which ought to have occured to the French minister, and have led him to take decided measures. The interest of
<PB N="288" REF="029916_0297_0FE30C91922AE100"/>
the national debt was 255,395,141 <HI>l.</HI> by a report for the year 1792. Necker, by his account dated the 1st of May, 1789, states the in∣come at 475,294,000<HI>l.,</HI> and the expences at 531,533,000<HI>l.</HI>: consequently there was a de∣ficiency of 56,239,000<HI>l.</HI>; and it was not proba∣ble, it could not even be expected, that during the convulsions of a revolution the taxes would be regularly paid: the debt, then, and the de∣mands of the state must increase.</P>
<P>The credit of every government greatly de∣pends on the regulation of its finances; and the most certain way to have given stability to the new system, would have been by making such arrangements as would have insured promptitude of payment. No minister ever had it so much in his power to have taken measures glorious for France, beneficial to Europe, happy for the peo∣ple of the day, and advantageous to posterity. No epocha since the inflated system of paper (the full blown bladders of public credit, which may be destroyed by the prick of a pin) was invented, ever appeared so favourable as that juncture in France, to have overturned it completely: and by overlooking these circumstances, the nation has probably lost most of the advantages, which her finances might have gained by the revolution.</P>
<P>Such mistakes, whilst they involve in them a thousand difficulties, prove the necessity of gra∣dual reform; lest the light suddenly breaking-in on a benighted people, should overpower the understanding it ought to direct. The line in which Necker had been accustomed to move, by restraining what little energy his mind was capa∣ble of exerting, precluded the possibility of his
<PB N="289" REF="029916_0298_0FE30CCA60D44818"/>
seeing the faint lines marked on an expansive scale, which afforded the data for calculations; and the nation, confiding to him the direction of a business for which he had not sufficient talents, seems to have contemplated in imagination a prospect, which has not yet been realized; and whilst expectation hovered on its margin, the dazzling scenery was obscured by clouds the most threatening and tremendous.</P>
<P>These are evils that from the beginning of time have attended precipitate and great changes. The improvements in philosophy and morals have been extremely tardy. All sudden revolutions have been as suddenly overturned, and things thrown back below their former state. The im∣provements in the science of politics have been still more slow in their advancement than those of philosophy and morals; but the revolution in France has been progressive. It was a revolution in the minds of men; and only demanded a new system of government to be adapted to that change. This was not generally perceived; and the politicians of the day ran wildly from one extreme to the other, without recollecting, that even Moses sojourning forty years in the wilder∣ness could but conduct the Jews to the borders of the promised land, after the first generation had perished in their prejudices; the most inve∣terate sins of men.</P>
<P>This is not a discouraging consideration. Our ancestors have laboured for us; and we, in our turn, must labour for posterity. It is by tracing the mistakes, and profiting from the discoveries of one generation, that the next is able to take a more elevated stand. The first inventor of any
<PB N="290" REF="029916_0299_0FE30C9314220998"/>
instrument has scarcely ever been able to bring it to a tolerable degree of perfection; and the discoveries of every man of genius, the optics of Newton excepted, have been improved, if not extended, by their followers.—Can it then be expected, that the science of politics and sinance, the most important, and most difficult of all human improvements; a science which involves the passions, tempers, and manners of men and nations, estimates their wants, maladies, comforts, happiness, and misery, and computes the sum of good or evil flowing from social insti∣tutions; will not require the same gradations, and advance by steps equally slow to that state of perfection necessary to secure the sacred rights of every human creature?</P>
<P>The vanity and weakness of men have conti∣nually tended to retard this progress of things: still it is going forward; and though the fatal presumption of the headstrong French, and the more destructive ambition of their foreign ene∣mies, have given it a check, we may contemplate with complacent serenity the approximation of the glorious era, when the appellations of fool and tyrant will be synonymous.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Error of the national assembly in neglecting to secure the freedom of France. Its conduct compared with that of the American States. Necessity of forming a new constitution as soon as an old government is destroyed. The declaring the king inviolable a wrong measure. Security of the French against a counter-revolution.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE conduct of the assembly in losing so much time—the most precious time to secure the happiness of their country, and enable the pre∣sent generation to participate in the blessings they were preparing for posterity, instead of having to encounter all the miseries of anarchy, can never be sufficiently lamented. France had al∣ready gained her freedom; the nation had already ascertained certain, and the most important, po∣litical
<PB N="292" REF="029916_0301_0FE30C9524C03400"/>
truths: it ought, therefore, to have been the next consideration, how these were to be preserved, and the liberty of the empire con∣solidated on a basis that time would only render more firm.</P>
<P>Moderate men, or real patriots, would have been satisfied with what had been gained, for the present, allowing the rest to follow progres∣sively. It was the most political and the most reasonable way to secure the acquisition. In this situation France had to contend with the preju∣dices of half Europe, at least, and to counteract the influence of the insidious intriguers, who were opposing themselves to her regeneration; to fa∣cilitate which the assembly ought to have made it one of their main objects to render the king contented with the change; and then the machi∣nations of all the underminers of the revolution, would not have loosened one fundamental stone, to endanger the rising edifice.</P>
<P>Such is the difference between men acting from a practical knowledge, and men who are governed entirely by theory, or no principle whatever. Most of the United States of Ame∣rica formed their separate constitutions within a month, and none took more than three, after the declaration of their independence by congress. There certainly was a vast distinction between those states, then the colonies of Great Britain, and France after the 14th of July; but both countries were without a government. America with an enemy in the heart of their empire, and France threatened with an attack. The leading men of America, however, knew, that there was a necessity of having some kind of govern∣ment,
<PB N="293" REF="029916_0302_0FE30C52D5BDEEE8"/>
and seem to have perceived the ease, with which any subsequent alterations could be effect∣ed. The members of the national assembly, on the contrary, found themselves surrounded with ruins; and aiming at a state of perfection for which the minds of the people were not suffi∣ciently mature; affecting likewise to be directed by a magnanimous disinte restedness, they not only planted the germ of the most dangerous and licentious spirit, but they continued to irritate the desperate courtiers, who, having determined to oppose stratagem to force, and not succeed∣ing, rested all their future hopes on the king's escape.</P>
<P>The liberty of the press, which had been vir∣tually established, at this period, was a successful engine employed against the assembly. And to a nation celebrated for epigramatic fancy, and whose taste had been so refined by art, that they had lost the zest of nature, the simplicity of some of the members, their awkward figures, and rustic gait, compared with the courtly mien, and easy assurance of the chevaliers of Versailles, af∣forded an excellent subject. Some of these satires were written with considerable wit, and such a happy turn of caricature, that it is impossible not to laugh with the author, though indirectly ri∣diculing the principles you hold sacred. The most respectable decrees, the most important, and serious discussions, were twisted into jests; which divided the people without doors into two dis∣tinct parties; one, speaking of the assembly with sovereign contempt, as a set of upstarts and bab∣bling knaves; and the other, setting up new thrones for their favourites, and viewing them
<PB N="294" REF="029916_0303_0FE30C9BB1E81F80"/>
with blind admiration, as if they were a synod of demi-gods. The countenancing of this abuse of freedom was ill-judged. The different parties were already sufficiently heated; yet it would have been impossible, perhaps, to have restrained the temper of the times, so strong is the intoxica∣tion of a new folly, though it would have been easy for the assembly to have passed a decree re∣specting libels. But so ardent was become their passion for liberty, that they were unable to discri∣minate between a licentous use of that important invention, and it's real utility. Treating then with an untimely disdain the many abusive publi∣cations, which were sold within the very walls where they were sitting, they were not aware of the effect which they produced on the minds of mock heroes, who, having no principle but honour, were ready to risk their lives to sooth distressed beauty, no matter what produced it; or to alleviate the sufferings of a king, though the consequence of his turpitude or tergiversation.</P>
<P>After the wreck of a government the plan of a new constitution ought to be immediately form∣ed, that is, as soon as circumstances will possibly admit, and presented to the citizens for their acceptance; or rather the people should depute men for that purpose, and give them a limited time for framing one. A constitution is a standard for the people to rally round. It is the pillar of a government, the bond of all social unity and order. The investigation of it's principles makes it a fountain of light; from which issue the rays of reason, that gradually bring forward the mental powers of the whole community. And when∣ever the wheels of government, like the wheels
<PB N="295" REF="029916_0304_0FE30CCE1715FD08"/>
of any other machine, are found clogged, or do not move in a regular manner, they equally re∣quire alteration and improvement: and these im∣provements will be proportionably perfect as the people become enlightened.</P>
<P>The authority of the national assembly had been acknowledged nearly three months previous to this epocha, without their having taken any decided steps to secure these important ends. Indeed it does not appear to have been their first object. They seem not have known, or at least not to have been apprehensive, that, in propor∣tion to the length of time that the people are with∣out an established government, anarchists gain an ascendency over their minds; and it then becomes no easy task to form a constitution adapted to their wayward tempers.</P>
<P>When a few fundamental principles are ascer∣ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned, and the state has determined that they shall form the basis of it's polity, it seems to be no difficult matter to give motion to the new springs of government. It is true, that many of the prejudices of Frenchmen were still inveterate, and in some measure influenced them; and it is also certain, that their total ignorance of the operations of any rational system of government was an impediment to this motion; but it is never∣theless to be presumed, that, the liberty of French∣men having been previously secured by the establishment of the declaration of rights, if the assembly had formed some kind of a constitution, and proposed it to the nation, and to the king, if he were considered as forming a part of it, for their acceptation, the dispute between the people and court would have been brought to a speedy
<PB N="296" REF="029916_0305_0FE30C9D35F87F70"/>
issue; and the public attention directed to a point would have given dignity and respectability to their proceedings. If such measures had been followed, and it appears a little strange they were not, most probably the king and court, perceiving that their future consequence wholly depended on their acquiescence with the state of reason, and temper of the times, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld have re∣linquished all those absurd and dangerous projects for overturning the rising po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al fab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c of the nation, which anarchy fostered.</P>

The natural, civil, and political rights of man are the main pillars of all social happiness; and by the firm establishment of them, the free∣dom of men will be eternally secured. The mo∣ment, therefore a state has gained those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mportant and sacred privileges, it is clear, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ought to form some kind of government, grounded upon the firm and broad basis, that being the only possi∣ble way to give them permanency. But the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt assembly, unmindful of the dreadful ef∣fects beginning to flow from an unbounded licen∣tiousness, continued to pursue a romant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subli∣mity of character, dangerous to all sublunary laws; whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most interestedly attentive to things that should have been subordinate to then first object, they were led into a procrastination, which in its consequence has been fatal in the extreme.</P>
<P>The decree which made the king inviolable, passed on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5th of September, at the time the crown was declared hereditary, and the empire
<PB N="297" REF="029916_0306_0FE30CD3F1F73E98"/>
indivisible, was the most idle, if not the most dangerous measure, both for him and France, which could have been devised. The former life of Louis had exhibited a series of follies, and displayed an insincerity not to be tolerated, much less encouraged; and it was likely, if this doc∣trine, a relict of the abasement of ignorance, that kings can do no wrong, should not be carried into a law, forming part of the constitution, that he would avail himself of the decree of the assembly to cover his contempt of the national sovereignty. When kings are considered by the government of a country merely as cyphers, it is very just and proper, that their ministers should be responsible for their political conduct: but at the moment when a state is about to establish a constitution on the basis of reason, to undermine that foundation by a master-piece of absurdity, appears a solecism as glaring as the doct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it∣self is laughable, when applied to an enlighten∣ed policy. In fact, whilst Mirabeau contended for the infallibility of the king, he seems to have had no right from reason to deride those who respected that of the church: for, if the govern∣ment must necessarily be supported by a pious fraud, one was as respectable as the other.</P>
<P>The bigotry of Louis was well known; nay, it was notorious, that he employed his confes∣sor to erase from his tender conscience the re∣membrance of the vices he resolved to indulge, and to reconcile the meanest dissimulation with a fertile fear of the Being whose first attribute is truth.—This man, whose bestiality had been care∣fully pampered by the queen and count d'Arto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, because in those moments of revelry, prolonged

to the most disgusting excess of gluttony and in∣toxication, he would sanction all their demands, was made in his person and conduct sacred and unimpeachable. This was the extreme folly of weakness. But, when it is also kept in view, that, at the very period when he was declared inviolable, he was suspected, in concert with the court, to be actually meditating his flight, there seems to be a pusillanimity in it as contemptible as the pretended dignity of the assembly was ri∣diculous.</P>
<P>True firmness consists in doing whatever is just and reasonable, uninfluenced by any other consideration. The defining the power of the crown in the assembly to be subordinate to the authority of the people must have appeared to the kings of Europe a dangerous encroachment on their indefeasible rights:—a heresy tending to undermine their privileges, should such audacity pass unchastized, and to destroy the splendor of royalty by presuming to controul its omni∣potence. It was then scarcely to be expected, that their resentment would be appeased by shielding the person of Louis against the danger of intrigue and violence. It was not, indeed, the preservation of the life of this unfortunate man, that interested them so sensibly as to appal the sychophants of Europe.—No; it was the attack made on despotism; and the attempt to draw aside the splendid cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain which concealed its folly, that threw them into a general ferment and agitation. This agitation could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to inspire the court of Versailles with hope, and they stood prepared to take advantage of the ga∣thering storm, as eagerly as a distressed mariner,

who has long laid becalmed, perceiving at length a gentle heaving of the sea, and feeling the un∣dulating motion of his bark, foresees the ap∣proaching breeze, and spreads his sails to catch the first breath of wind. The effect of the feign∣ed or real pity of many of the admirers of the old system, who were deeply wounded by the wrong done, as they insisted, to their king, was to be dreaded; for it was not to be supposed, that the chivalrous spirit of France would be des∣troyed in an instant, though <HI>swords had ceased to leap out of their scabbards</HI> when beauty was not deified. It was then undoubtedly to be feared, that they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isk their lives and fortunes to support the glory of their master, and their own notions of honour: and the assembly, by making Louis not accountable for any of his actions, however insincere, unjus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or atrocious, was affording all his abettors a shelter, encou∣raging at the same time his hypocrisy, and relax∣ing the little energy of character, which his misfortune <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emed to be calling into play.</P>
<P>Mistaken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enity in politics is not more dan∣gerous than a false magnanimity is palpable littleness in the eyes of a man of simple inte∣grity. Besides, had the representatives of the people considered Louis merely as a man, it is probable he would have acted more like one. In∣stead of palliating the matter, they should, on the contrary, have proclaimed to all Europe, with a tone of dignified firmness, that the French nation, willing for themselves, regardless of the rights and privileges of others, though respecting their prejudices, finding that no compromise could be formed between the court and people, whose
<PB N="300" REF="029916_0309_0FE30CA0D5F85808"/>
interest neither justice nor policy ever required should be distinct, do not consider themselves accountable to any power or congress on earth, for any measure they may choose to adopt in framing a constitution to regulate their own internal polity. That, treating their monarch like a man, and not as a mere idol for state pageantry, they would wish, by establishing the dignity of truth and justice, to give stability to the freedom of Frenchmen, and leave a mo∣nument in their institutions to immortalize a sincere and acquiescing king. But that, though their ideas might differ greatly from those of their neighbours, with whom they desired to live on the most amicable terms, they would pursue the path of eternal reason in consoli∣dating the rights of man; and by a striking example lay the foundation of the liberty of the whole globe, of that liberty which had hitherto been confined to the small island of England, and enjoyed imperfectly even there.</P>
<P>The house of Austria was at this period en∣gaged in a war with the Turks, which obliged it to withdraw most of its troops from Flan∣ders; and the intelligence, that the Flemings, highly discontented with the innovations, which the vain weathercock Joseph the Second had made in their form of worship, were on the eve of an insurrection, more against the folly of the man than the despotism of his court, calmed the fears of the French, as to the danger of being immediately attacked by Ger∣many. This security, for they had no dread of Sardinia, made them consider the possibility of a counter-revolution being effected by foreign
<PB N="301" REF="029916_0310_0FE30C8850B7FBC8"/>
enemies as far from alarming. It is true, there was not any just cause of apprehension, unless they took into the calculation, that the policy of Europe for ages past had been subject to sudden changes; a state of profound tranquillity giving place to sanguinary scenes of confusion, and in∣human butcheries—often about such trifling insults and idle pretensions, as individuals would be ashamed to make a pretext for quarrelling; and having reason to expect these changes as long as the systems of courts preserve their ex∣istence, France could not reckon, with any de∣gree of certainty, on the continuation of peace. —Neither did the national assembly appear to have calculated upon it; for they undoubtedly betrayed symptoms of pusillanimity, when they suffered their conduct to be in the smallest de∣gree influenced by the apprehension of a combi∣nation of the crowned heads of Europe to replace the royal diadem of France, should the most brilliant of it's jewels be touched by profane hands.</P>
<P>These fears, perhaps, were the secret cause, combined with the old habit of adoring the king, as a point of honour, and loving the court, as an affair of taste, that induced them to preserve the shadow of monarchy in the new order of things. Its preservation might have been politi∣cally necessary; because, before abolishing any ancient form, it is necessary to secure, whatever political good may have flowed from it, and guard against being exhausted by cutting off an excrescence.—But, if the continuance of a king in the new system were expedient to avert present evil, they should have allowed him the
<PB N="302" REF="029916_0311_0FE30C89D513FB18"/>
power necessary to give energy to the govern∣ment; and making him responsible for the recti∣tude of his actions, the man would have had a fair trial, and posterity, judging of his conduct, would have been enabled to form a just estimate of a kingly government.</P>
<P>Machiavelian cunning, however, still directed the movements of all the courts of Europe; and these political moles, too well perceiving the ti∣midity that was mixed with the blustering courage of the assembly, only waited for a favourble season to overturn the rising edifice. Their agents had private instructions to pro∣mote the escape of Louis, as the surest mode of making a decided schism in the national politics; and they firmly believed, that the af∣fection still subsisting for his christian majesty would facilitate the execution of their plan. The court also presuming on the divisions and lenity of the assemb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, took the most indefatigable pains to foster in the mind of the public, nay, in that of all Europe, pity for the degraded person of the king, and detestation of the sacrilege, which had been committed on the dignity of royalty. Their continual theme was the ignomi∣nious state to which the most mild of the Bourbons was reduced, by men, who usurped the reins of government, and trampled on the honours of that august and ancient family. Restraining the authority of a throne, which supported the most abominable tyranny, they were shaking the despo∣tism, which held in bondage nine-tenths of the in∣habitants of the world. These were alarming sig∣nals to a certain class of men, to the drones and myrmidons who live on the spoil and blood of in∣dustry
<PB N="303" REF="029916_0312_0FE30CD70987DD78"/>
and innocence. The intrusion of know∣ledge, which was sure to render them an useless set of beings in society, was to be prevented by inge∣nious clamours, whilst a great number of weak, well-meaning people, and still more knaves, en∣listed under their banner.</P>
<P>The universal damp, which the revolution had given to the courts of Europe, producing among them a lively sympathy for the sombre atmosphere of Versailles, a general sorrow was consequently expressed by all their minions, and expressed with unfeigned concern; for the want of the usual routine of amusements tended to make it real. Hope, indeed, began again to animate them, when the king was prevailed on to concert his escape; yet their eagerness to accelerate his departure for the frontiers, where they proposed to erect the royal stan∣dard, to avail themselves of the promixity of German connections, was in a great degree the the cause of defeating that ill contrived de∣sign.</P>
<P>A design formed very early, and systemati∣cally pursued, was probably rendered entirely abortive by the obstinacy of the court; who still persisted to cherish the belief, that the public opinion was changed only for the moment, and that their deeply rooted love of royalty would bring them back to what they termed their duty, when the effervescence excited by novelty had subsided. And thinking, that the cordial reception given by the Parisians to the soldiery had contributed to estrange them, and effect the revolution, they determined to regain their lost ground, and dazzle them by feasts,
<PB N="304" REF="029916_0313_0FE30CA54D76EA28"/>
instead of stealing on their affections by hospi∣tality.—Still, bearing impatiently their humili∣ating situation, the courtiers could not help vauntingly exposing their project; and the bab∣bling of joy showed the weakness of the heads that could so soon be intoxicated by hope.</P>
<P>A preparatory step was thought necessary to awaken a sense of allegiance in the breasts of the people, and to promote a division amongst them, if not their entire concurrence, after the cabinet should have securely in their possession the per∣son of the king; and this division would then enable them to calculate their strength, and act accordingly. For this purpose, in spite of the comments that had been made on the festivity at Versailles, which seemed before to insult the misery of the people and greatly tended to pro∣voke the exertions that overturned the Bastile and changed the whole face of things, they pro∣jected another entertainment to seduce the mili∣tary, encouraged to throng round the court, whilst famine was at the very gates of Paris. But previously the old French guards, who had been incorporated with the <HI>garde bourgeoise,</HI> be∣gan to manifest some symptoms of discontent at not being allowed to guard the person of the king. Whether they considered their honour as wounded, or were spirited up to aspire at regain∣ing this privilege is not decided; but it is clear, that the court, either to facilitate the entrance of fresh troops, or from a real dislike to men, who had taken such an active part in disconcerting their first plot, opposed their wish; and even the municipality, as has been already noticed, was induced to request, that a regiment of fresh
<PB N="305" REF="029916_0314_0FE30CD88B799F40"/>
troops might be called in to guard the person of the king, and keep the peace, which this trifling dispute, swelled into an insurrection in the report, threatened to disturb.</P>
<P>The king's body-guards, whose time of service expired the first of October, were still retained with those who came to replace them; and an immense crowd of supernumeraries continued daily to increase this corps, which had not yet sworn allegiance to the nation. The officers, in particular, flocked to Versailles, amounting to between eleven and twelve hundred, constantly parading together. The universal topic was com∣miseration of the king's fate, and insinuations respecting the ambition of the assembly. Yet, even there the court party seemed to be prevail∣ing: a president attached to loyalty was elected; and Mirabeau's remonstrances, respecting the augmentation of the troops, were disregarded.</P>
<P>Mean time, not only the officers of the new regiment, but those of the national guards, were caressed by the court, whilst the citizens, with more sagacity, were lavish of their attention to the soldiers. The cabinet had not sufficient dis∣cernment to perceive, that the people were now to be led, not driven; and the popular promoters of anarchy, to serve their private interest availed themselves, unfortunately, but too well of this want of judgment.—Thus whilst one party, declaiming on the necessity of order, seemed to be endeavouring to rivet on them the chains of servitude, the other lifted them above the law with vain glorious notions of their sovereignty. —And this sovereignty of the people, the perfec∣tion of the science of government, only to be

attained when the nation is truly enlightened, consisted in making them tyrants; nay the worst of tyrants, because the instruments of mischief of the men who pretended to be subordinate to their will, though acting the very part of the ministers whom they execrated.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ON the first of October, in consequence of these fresh machinations, a magnificent enter∣tainment was given in the name of the king's body-guards; but really by some of their prin∣cipal officers, at the opera-house of the castle. The affectation of excluding the dragoons, dis∣tinguished for their attachment to liberty, seemed to show, but too plainly, the end in view, ren∣dered still more conspicuous by the unusual fa∣miliarity of persons of the first rank with the lowest soldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="029916_0316_0FE30CE058D1E1C0"/>When their heads were heated by a sump∣tuous banquet, by the tumult of an immense crowd, and the great profusion of delicious wines and <HI>liqueurs,</HI> the conversation, purposely turned into one channel, became unrestrained, and a chivalrous scene completed the folly. The queen, to testify her satisfaction for the homage paid to her, and the wishes expressed in her favour, exhibited herself to this half-drunken multitude; carrying the dauphin in her arms, whom she regarded with a mixture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orrow and tenderness, and seeming to implore in his favour the affection and zeal of the soldiers.</P>
<P>This acting, for it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was a preconcerted business was still more intoxica∣ting than the wine.—The exclamation <HI>vive le roi, vive la reine,</HI> resoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from all sides, and the royal healths were drunk over drawn swords, whilst that of the nation was rejected with con∣tempt by the body-guards. The music, the choice could not have been the eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of chance, played the well known air—O Richard! O my king! the universe abandons thee!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>'O Richard, O mon roi,</L><L>'L'univers t'abandonne!'</L></NOTE> and during this moment of fascination some voices, perhaps bribed for the occasion, mingled execrations against the assembly. A grenadier even darted from the midst of his comrades, and accusing himself of having been unfaithful to his prince, endeavoured, several times, to plunge his sword into his bosom. His held arm was not indeed allowed to search for the disloyal heart; but some blood was permitted to flow—and this
<PB N="308" REF="029916_0317_0FE30C57415FC2C8"/>
theatrical display of sensibility, carried to the highest pitch, produced emotions almost convul∣sive in the whole circle, of which an English reader can scarcely form an idea. The king, who is always represented as innocent, though always giving proofs that he more than connived at the attempts to recover his power, was like∣wise prevailed on to shew himself at this enter∣tainment. And some of the same soldiery, who had refused to second the former project of the cabal, were now induced to utter insults and menaces against the very authority, they then supported. 'The national cockade,' exclaimed Mirabeau,
<Q>that emblem of the defenders of liberty, has been torn in pieces, and stamped under foot; and another ensign put into its place.—Yes; even under the eye of the mo∣narch, who allowed himself to be styled— <HI>Restorer of the rights of his people,</HI> they have dared to hoist a signal of faction.</Q></P>
<P>The same scene was renewed two days af∣ter, though with less parade; and invitations for a similar treat were given for the following week.</P>
<P>The rumour respecting them, which reached Paris, contained many exaggerated circumstan∣ces; and was regarded as the commencement of fresh hostilities, on the part of the court. The cry now was, that the stunned aristocracy had again reared it's head; and that a number of old officers, chevaliers of St. Louis, had signed a a promise to join the body-guards in a new at∣tempt. This list was said to contain thirty thou∣sand signatures; and idle as the tale was, it seemed to be confirmed by the appearance of white and
<PB N="309" REF="029916_0318_0FE30CE2296EC408"/>
black cockades, which inconsiderate individuals displayed at the risk of their lives. These, said the Parisians, are the first indications of a pro∣jected civil war—the court wish only to have the king safe to head them before they speak out:— he ought, therefore, to be removed to Paris, inferred the politicians of the palais royal. The exasperating of the people in this manner was certainly the most absurd blundering folly that could have ruined a party, who apparently saw the necessity of dividing the people in order to conquer them. It was, in fact, a species of madness, and can be accounted for only by re∣collecting the ineffable contempt really felt by the court for the <HI>canaille,</HI> which made them still imagine the revolution to be only a temporary convulsion, not believing it possible, in spite of the daily events, that they could be crushed by the mass they despised. Their presumption pro∣ceeded from their ignorance, and was incurable.</P>
<P>The queen was supposed to be at the head of this weak conspiracy, to withdraw the soldiery from siding with the people. She had presented colours to the national guards of Versailles, and when they waited on her to express their thanks, she replied, with the most winning affability,
<Q>the nation and the army ought to be as well affected to the king as we ourselves are. I was quite charmed with what passed on Thursday.</Q>
This was the day of the feast.</P>
<P>A scarcity of bread, the common grievance of the revolution, aggravated the vague fears of the Parisians, and made the people so desperate, that it was not difficult to persuade them to un∣dertake
<PB N="310" REF="029916_0319_0FE30CA9189C81B0"/>
any enterprize; and the torrent of resent∣ment and enthusiasm required only to be directed to a point to carry every thing before it. Liberty was the constant watch-word; though few knew in what it consisted.—It seems, indeed, to be necessary, that every species of enthusiasm should be fermented by ignorance to carry it to any height. Mystery alone gives full play to the imagination, men pursuing with ardor objects indistinctly seen or understood, because each man shapes them to his taste, and looks for something beyond even his own conception, when he is un∣able to form a just idea.</P>
<P>The Parisians were now continually brooding over the wrongs they had heretofore only enu∣merated in a song; and changing ridicule into invective, all called for redress, looking for a degree of public happiness immediately, which could not be attained, and ought not to have been expected, before an alteration in the na∣tional character seconded the system of govern∣ment.</P>
<P>From the enjoyment of more freedom than the women of other parts of the world, those of France have acquired more independence of spirit than any others; it has, therefore, been the scheme of designing men very often since the re∣volution, to lurk behind them as a kind of safe∣guard, working them up to some desperate act, and then terming it a folly, because merely the rage of women, who were supposed to be actuated only by the emotions of the moment. Early then on the fifth of October a multitude of women by some impulse were collected together; and hasten∣ing

to the <HI>Hôtel-de-Ville</HI> obliged every female they met to accompany them, even entering many houses to force others to follow in their train.</P>
<P>The concourse, at first, consisted mostly of market women, and the lowest refuse of the streets, women who had thrown off the virtues of one sex without having power to assume more than the vices of the other. A number of men also followed them, armed with pikes, bludgeons, and hatchets; but they were strictly speaking a mob, affixing all the odium to the appellation it can possibly import; and not to be confounded with the honest multitude, who took the Bastile. —In fact, such a rabble has seldom been gathered together; and they quickly showed, that their movement was not the effect of public spirit.</P>
<P>They first talked of addressing the committee appointed by the municipality to superintend the operations necessary to obtain provision for the city, and to remonstrate respecting their inatten∣tion or indifference to the public calamity. Mean time a new cord was fixed to the notorious lamp-iron, where the amusement of death was first tolerated. The national guards, forming a hedge of bayonets to prevent the women from entering the hotel, kept them in suspense a few moments. — When uttering a loud and general cry, they hurled a volley of stones at the soldiers, who, unwilling, or ashamed, to fire on women, though with the appearance of furies, retreated into the hall, and left the passage free. They then sought for arms; and breaking open the doors of the magazines, soon procured fusils, cannons and ammunition; and even took advantage of the con∣fusion to carry off money and notes belonging to
<PB N="312" REF="029916_0321_0FE30CAA99F61670"/>
the public. In the interim some went to search for the volunteers of the Bastile, and chose a commander from among them to conduct the party to Versailles; whilst others tied cords to the carriages of the cannons to drag them along. —But these, being mostly marine artillery, did not follow with the alacrity necessary to accord with their wishes; they, therefore, stopped seve∣ral coaches, forcing the men to get out and the ladies to join them; fastening the cannons be∣hind, on which a number of the most furious mounted, brandishing whatever weapon they had found, or the matches of the cannons. Some drove the horses, and others charged themselves with the care of the powder and ball, falling into ranks to facilitate their march. They took the road by the <HI>Champs Elisées</HI> about noon, to the number of four thousand, escorted by four or five hundred men, armed with every thing on which they could lay their hand.</P>
<P>Mean time the <HI>tocsin</HI> sounded from all parts; the French guards, still urged on by wounded pride, loudly declared, that the king ought to be brought to Paris; and many of the citizens, not on duty, concurred with the rest of the na∣tional guards in the same opinion, particularly those accustomed to attend the harangues at the Palais Royal. La Fayette, refusing to accom∣pany, endeavoured to calm them. But finding, that the tumult increased, and that prayers were giving place to menaces, he offered to make known to the king, at their head, the wishes of the capi∣tal, if the municipality gave him orders to this effect. Their council was now assembled: yet prolonging the deliberation till between four
<PB N="313" REF="029916_0322_0FE30C64549EC730"/>
and five o'clock in the afternoon, the people be∣came so very impatient, that it was thought pru∣dent to allow them to set out: and the exclama∣tions of the populace proved how easy it was to govern, or lead them astray, by every fresh hope.</P>
<P>Few events have happened at Paris, that have not been attributed by the different parties to the machinations of the leaders on the other side; to blacken whose characters, when they had the upper hand, the most audacious falsehoods have been industriously circulated; the detection of which has induced many calm observers to be∣lieve, that all the accounts of plots and conspira∣cies were fabricated in the same manner; not considering, that even the universality of these suspicions was a proof of the intriguing character of the people, who from a knowledge of them∣selves became thus mistrustful of others. It was currently reported, that very considerable sums had been distributed amongst the mob, before it marched to Versailles; and, though many fabu∣lous stories of showers of gold have since been retailed by the credulous, this seems, from their subsequent conduct, to have had some foundation: for nothing like the heroism, the disinterested∣ness, appeared, which in most other risings of the Parisians, has formed a striking contrast with their barbarity; sometimes sufficient to oblige us, lamenting the delusions of ignorance, to give the soft name of enthusiasm to cruelty; respecting the intention, though detesting the effects. Now, on the contrary, acting like a gang of thieves, they gave colour to the report—that the first instigators of the riot were hired assassins.—And
<PB N="314" REF="029916_0323_0FE30CB1EAB113C0"/>
hired by whom?—The public voice repeats, on every side, the despicable duke of Orleans, whose immense estate had given him an undue influence in the bailliages, and who still exercised all the means that cunning could devise, and wealth produce, to revenge himself on the royal family. He was particularly incensed against the queen, who having treated him with the con∣tempt which he doubtless merited, and even in∣fluenced the king to banish him to one of his country seats, when he uttered some popular sentiments, he continued to nourish the most im∣placable hatred to her person, whilst the changing sentiments of the nation respecting the present branch of his family excited in him hopes, that would at once have gratified both his revenge and his ambition.</P>
<P>There is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o calculating the mischief which may be produced by a revengeful cunning knave, possessing the forcible engine of gold to move his projects, and acting by agency, which, like a subterraneous fire, that for a long time has been putting the combustible matter into a state of fusion, bursts out unexpectedly, and the sudden eruption spreads around terror and destruction.</P>
<P>The agents of despotism, and of vengeful am∣bition, employed the same means to agitate the minds of the Parisians; and covered as they now are with foul stains, it is an acknowledgment due to their original good disposition, to note, that at this period they were so orderly it re∣quired considerable management to lead them into any gross irregularity of conduct. It was, therefore, necessary for the duke's instruments to
<PB N="315" REF="029916_0324_0FE30CE52CA66B80"/>
put in motion a body of the most desperate women; some of whom were half famished for want of bread, which had purposely been render∣ed scarce to facilitate the atrocious design of murdering both the king and queen in a broil, that would appear to be produced solely by the rage of famine.</P>
<P>The shameless manner in which the entertain∣ment of the officers of the body guards had been conducted; the indiscreet visit of the queen to interest the army in the cause of royalty, coming in artfully after the rabble of soldiers had been allowed to enter; together with the imprudent expressions of which she afterwards made use; served as pretexts, nay, may have been some of the causes of these women suspecting, that the dearth of bread in the capital was owing to the contrivance of the court, who had so often pro∣duced the same effect to promote their sinister purposes. They believed then, that the only sure way to remedy such a grievous calamity, in future, would be to emplore the king to reside at Paris: and the national militia, composed of more orderly citizens, who thought the report of a premedita∣ted escape was not without foundation, imagined, that they should nip a civil war in the bud, by preventing the king's departure, and separate him effectually from the cabal, to whom they attributed all his misconduct.</P>
<P>Whilst the multitude were advancing, the assembly were considering the king's reply to their request to sanction the declaration of rights, and the first articles of the constitution, before the supplies were granted. The reply was couched in terms somewhat vague, yet its mean∣ing
<PB N="316" REF="029916_0325_0FE30CB3AA5EF838"/>
could not be misunderstood. He observed, that the articles of the constitution could be judged of only in their connection with the whole; nevertheless he thought it natural, that at the moment the nation was called upon to assist the government by a signal act of confi∣dence and patriotism, they should expect to be re-assured respecting their principal interest.— 'Accordingly,' he continues,
<Q>taking it for granted, that the first articles of the constitu∣tion, which you have presented to me, united to the completion of your labours, will satisfy the wishes of my people, and secure the hap∣piness and prosperity of the kingdom, conform∣ably to your desire I accept them; but with one positive condition, from which I will never depart; namely, that from the general result of your deliberations the executive power shall have its entire effect in the hands of the mo∣narch. Still it remains for me to assure you with frankness, that, if I give my sanction of acceptance to the several articles, which you have laid before me, it is not because they in∣discriminately give me an idea of perfection; but I believe it laudable in me to pay this respect to the wishes of the deputies of the nation, and to the alarming circumstances, which so earnestly press us to desire above all things the prompt re-establishment of peace, order, and confidence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I shall not deliver my sentiments respecting your declaration of the rights of man and of citizens. It contains excellent maxims proper to direct your deliberations; but principles sus∣ceptible of application, and even of different
<PB N="317" REF="029916_0326_0FE30CECA0AA1368"/>
interpretations, cannot be justly appreciated, and have only need of being so when their true sense is determined by the laws, to which they ought to be the basis.</Q></P>
<P>In the subterfuge employed in this answer, the profound dissimulation of the king appears; and that 'pitiful respect for false honour,' which makes a man boggle at a naked untruth, even when uttering a number of contemptible preva∣rications. Thus did he at first struggle against every concession, against granting any real free∣dom to the people; yet afterwards unable to maintain his ground, he impotently gave way before the storm he had raised, every time losing a part of the authority which depended on opinion.</P>
<P>The assembly manifested an universal discon∣tent. One of the members remarked, that the king with-held his acceptance of the declaration of rights; and only yielded to circumstances in accepting the constitutional articles: he, there∣fore, moved, that no taxes should be levied, be∣fore the declaration of rights and the constitu∣tion should be accepted, without any reservation. —Another asserted that the king's reply ought to have been counter-signed by one of the mini∣sters. What an absurdity! yet the inviolability of the king standing in their way, it seemed to be necessary to secure ministerial responsiblity, to render it null; not only to prevent the ministers from finding shelter behind it, but to make it utterly useless to the king, who was thus, literally speaking, reduced to a cypher. Mirabeau, how∣ever, after alluding with energy to the entertain∣ment, which, out of derision had been termed
<PB N="318" REF="029916_0327_0FE30CB52D1F1620"/>
patriotic, made three or four motions. One was,
<Q>that no act emanating from the king should be declared without the signature of a secretary of state.</Q>
—So inconsistent was the man, who argued with such eloquence for the absolute <HI>veto:</HI> —Another was,
<Q>that his majesty would please to be explicit; and not by a conditional consent, extorted by circumstances, leave any doubt of his sincere concurrence in the mind of the people.</Q>
It was also noticed, to corroborate the inference, that the king was only yielding, for the moment, to opinions which he hoped to see exploded, that the decree for the circulation of grain had been altered before the publication, and the usual preamble, <HI>for such is our pleasure,</HI> formed a strange contrast with an acknowledge∣ment of the legislative rights of the nation. Robespierre, particularly maintained, that the nation had not any need of the assistance of the monarch to constitute itself—that the king's reply was not an acceptance, but a censure: and, con∣sequently, an attack on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>This seemed virtually the opinion of the assem∣bly, though Mirabeau's soft style of expressing their will was adopted. It was particularly in this decision, that the deputies displayed a great degree of the weakness, which mistakes temerity for courage, and the shadow of justice for verity. —And affecting to reconcile a contradiction, that the authority of kings is suspended as often as the sovereign is occupied in framing the clements of the constitution, or altering funda∣mental laws, they demonstrated the inconsistency of their own system and acknowledged its ab∣surdity; which is still more flagrantly shewn in
<PB N="319" REF="029916_0328_0FE30CEE46A91BD0"/>
Mirabeau's irrational declaration, that,
<Q>by a pious fiction of the law, the king cannot him∣self deceive; but the grievances of the people demanding victims, these victims are the mi∣nisters</Q></P>
<P>At this juncture of the debate the tumultuous concourse of women arrived at Versailles: but it must not be unnoticed, that there was a num∣ber of men with them, disguised in women's clothes; which proves, that this was not, as has been asserted, a sudden impulse of necessity. There were besides men in their own garb armed like ruffians, with countenances answerable, who, swearing vengeance against the queen and the body-guards, seemed to be preparing to put their threats in execution. Some barbarians, volun∣teers in guilt might perhaps have joined, spurred on solely by the hope of plunder, and a love of tumult; but it is clear, that the principal movers played a surer game.</P>
<P>The women had taken two routes; and one party, without arms, presented themselves at the gate of the assembly, whilst the other clustered round the palace waiting for them. The avenues were already filled with body-guards, the Flan∣ders regiment was drawn up in ranks; in short, the soldiers were gathered together quickly in one quarter, though the people of Versailles were exceedingly alarmed, and particularly by the appearance of the vagabonds, who followed the female mob.</P>
<P>With some difficulty the women were pre∣vailed on to allow a few to enter orderly into the assembly, with a spokesman to make known their demand; whilst crowds, taking refuge in
<PB N="320" REF="029916_0329_0FE30C65D6364B68"/>
the galleries from the rain, presented there the strange sight of pikes, fusils, and tremendous sticks bound with iron. Their orator represented the grievances of the people, and the necessity of continually providing for their subsistence; he expressed the concern of the Parisians on account of the slow formation of a constitution, and attri∣buted this delay to the opposition of the clergy A bishop then presided in the absence of Mou∣nier, the president, who had been dispatched by the assembly with their expostulatory petition to the king. A deputy, to spare him the embarrass∣ment of a reply to the insinuation against his order, reprimanded the petitioner for calumniat∣ing that respectable body. He accordingly made an apology, yet justified himself by declaring, that he only reported the purport of the discontent∣ment of Paris. They were informed, in reply by the vice-president, that a deputation was already sent to the king, requesting his sanction of a de∣cree to facilitate the interior circulation of grain and flour: and finding, that it was impossible to attend to the business of the day, he adjourned the assembly, without waiting for the return of the president.</P>
<P>The women about the palace entered into conversation with the soldiers, some of whom said 'that were the king to recover all his 'autho∣rity, the people would never want bread! This indiscreet insinuation exasperated them; and they replied in the language, that is prover∣bial for being the most abusive. A fray also ensuing, brought on by a dispute relative to the affair of the cockades, one of the body guards drew his sword, which provoked a national guard
<PB N="321" REF="029916_0330_0FE30CEFDE9D91F8"/>
of Versailles to give him a blow with his musket, that broke his arm.</P>
<P>The national troops were eager to convince the mob, that they were equally offended at the disrespect paid to the emblem of liberty; and the Flemish regiment, though they were in battle array, made the women let their rings drop into their guns, to be convinced that they were not charged: saying,
<Q>It was true, they had drunk the wine of the body guards; but what did that engage them to do? They had also cried <HI>vive le roi,</HI> as the people themselves did every day; and it was their intention to serve him faithfully,</Q>
but not against the nation!— with other speeches to the same effect;—adding,
<Q>that one of their officers had ordered a thou∣sand cockades; and they knew not why they were not distributed!</Q>
Enraged by the tenor of this discourse, a body-guards-man struck one of the soldiers talking thus, who, in return, fired on him, and fractured his arm. All was now confusion; and every thing tended to ren∣der the body guards more odious to the po∣pulace.</P>
<P>The king arrived in the midst of it from hunting, and admitted at the same time the de∣putation from the national assembly, and an ad∣dress from the women. He received the latter with great affability, testified his sorrow on ac∣count of the scarcity of bread at Paris, and imme∣mediately sanctioned the decree, relative to the free circulation of grain, which he had just re∣ceived from the assembly. The woman who spoke, attempting to kiss his hand, he embraced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er with politeness, and dismissed them in the
<PB N="322" REF="029916_0331_0FE30CB75D1E0A60"/>
most gentleman-like manner. They immediately rejoined their companions, charmed by the re∣ception they had met with; and the king sent orders to the guards not to make use of their arms. The count d'Estaing, the commander in chief, announced likewise to the militia of Ver∣sailles, that the body-guards would the next day take the oath of allegiance to the nation, and put on the patriotic cockade.
<Q>They are not worthy,</Q>
was the indignant growl of the mul∣titude.</P>
<P>Some women now returning to Paris, to re∣port the gracious behaviour of the king, were unfortunately maltreated by a detachment of body-guards, commanded by a nobleman; and the volunteers of the Bastile coming to their assistance, two men, and three horses, were killed on the spot. These same irritated wo∣men meeting, likewise, the Parisian militia, on their way to Versailles, gave them an exag∣gerated description of the conduct of the guards.</P>
<P>The court now taking the alarm, fearing that their plan would be defeated, by the king's being obliged to go to Paris, urged him im∣mediately to set out for Metz, and the carriages were actually prepared. It is scarcely credible that they would have gone so far without his concurrence.</P>
<P>One loaded coach had been permitted to go out of the gate; but the national troops beginning to suspect what was going forward, obliged it to re-enter. The king then with his usual address, finding his escape at that time impracticable, and not wishing to shed blood in forcing his way, made a merit of necessity, and declared he would
<PB N="323" REF="029916_0332_0FE30CF1FAD153C8"/>
rather perish, than see the blood of Frenchmen streaming in his quarrel! So easy is it for a man, versed in the language of duplicity, to impose on the credulous; and to impress on candid minds a belief of an opinion that they would gladly re∣ceive without any doubting allay, did not other circumstances more strongly contradict the per∣suasion. This declaration, however, which was re-echoed with great eagerness, was considered as a manifest proof of the purity of his intentions, and a mark of his fixed adherence to the cause which he affected to espouse. Yet, to prove the contrary, it is only necessary to observe, that he put off the acceptance of the declaration of rights, and the first articles of the constitution, till after the attempt to escape was frustrated: for it was near eleven o'clock when he sent for the president, to put into his hands a simple ac∣ceptation, and to request him to convoke the assembly immediately, that he might avail him∣self of their counsel at this crisis: alarmed by the mob without, who, exposed to all the inclemen∣cy of the weather, it being a very wet and stormy night, were uttering the most horrid imprecations against the queen and the body-guards.</P>
<P>A drum instantly summoned the assembly; and La Fayette arriving with his army in less than an hour after, the president was again call∣ed for, who returned to the assembly with the king's assurance, that he had not even thought of leaving them, nor would he ever se∣parate himself from the representatives of the people.</P>
<P>La Fayette had previously assured the king of the fidelity of the metropolis, and that he had
<PB N="324" REF="029916_0333_0FE30C7141C8F090"/>
been expressly sent by the municipality of Paris to guard his august person. A rumour had pre∣vailed, ever since the arrival of the women, that the Parisian militia were coming to second them; but as the <HI>commune</HI> of Paris had not determined till late in the afternoon, the messenger from La Fayette to the palace could not have reached Versailles long before him: but the court sup∣posing that they would come, and having heard of the wish of the Parisians to bring the king to Paris, where they had always spies to give them the earliest notice of what was going forward, pressed him to set out without loss of time; still they were actuated solely by the desire of getting him away, and not from any apprehension that his life was in danger.</P>
<P>After tranquilizing the king, La Fayette join∣ed the Parisian militia in the avenue, to inform them, that the king had sanctioned the decree of the assembly for expediting the more spee∣dy circulation of provisions, that he accepted, without any reservation, of the declaration of rights, with the first articles of the constitu∣tion, declaring at the same time his unshaken resolution to remain among his people; and that he consented also to have a detachment of the national troops of Paris to contribute to guard his person.</P>
<P>Joy now took place of dread at Versailles; and the citizens distributed their addresses amongst the soldiers, offering them lodgings; they having been previously requested, by the beating of a drum, to receive as many of the Parisian mili∣tia as they possibly could. The rest, after pass∣ing several hours in arms round the palace,
<PB N="325" REF="029916_0334_0FE30CF757A2E358"/>
sought for shelter, as the morning began to dawn, in the churches. Every thing appearing quiet, the harassed king and queen were prevailed on to seek the repose they needed; and La Fayette, about five in the morning, retired to his chamber, to write to the municipality an account of his proceedings, before he likewise endeavoured to match a little rest.</P>
<P>Scarcely an hour after, the restless mob, great part of which had taken refuge in the hall and galleries of the assembly, began to prowl about. The most decent of the women, who had been pressed into the service, stole away during the night. The rest, with the whole gang of ruf∣fians, rushed towards the palace, and finding its avenues unguarded, entered like a torrent; and some among them, most probably, conceived that this was the moment to perpetrate the crime for which they had been drawn from their lurking∣holes in Paris.</P>
<P>Insulting one of the body-guards who op∣posed their entrance, he fired and killed a man. This was a fresh pretext for entering to search for the murderer, as he was termed by these rioters; and driving the guards before them up the grand stair-case, they began to break into the different apartments, vowing vengeance against the body-guards, in which were mingled the bitterest curses, all levelled at the queen.</P>
<P>Catching one unfortunate guard by himself, he was dragged down stairs; and his head, instantly severed from his body, was mounted on a pike, which rather served to irritate than glut the fury of the monsters, who were still hunting after blood or plunder.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="029916_0335_0FE30C7D518565B8"/>The most desperate found their way to the queen's chamber, and left for dead the man who courageously disputed their entrance. But she had been alarmed by the tumult, though the miscreants were not long in making their way good, and, throwing a wrapping-gown around her, ran, by a private passage, to the king's apart∣ment, where she found the dauphin; but the king was gone in quest of her: he, however, quickly returning, they waited together in a horrid state of suspense. Several of the guards, who en∣deavoured to keep back the mob, were wound∣ed; yet all this happened in a very short space of time.</P>
<P>The promptitude and rapidity of this move∣ment, taking every circumstance into considera∣tion, affords additional arguments in support of the opinion, that there had been a premeditated design to murder the royal family. The king had granted all they asked the evening be∣fore; sending away great part of the multitude delighted with his condescension; and they had received no fresh provocation to excite this out∣rage. The audacity of the most desperate mob has never led them, in the presence of a superior force, to attempt to chastise their governors; and it is not even probable that banditti, who had been moved by the common causes of such in∣surrections, should have thought of murdering their sovereign who, in the eyes of the greatest number of Frenchmen, was still shrouded by that divinity, tacitly allowed to hover round kings, much less have dared to attempt it.</P>
<P>La Fayette was quickly roused; and, send∣ing his <HI>aides-de-camp</HI> to assemble the national-guards,
<PB N="327" REF="029916_0336_0FE30C5B5C0BEE80"/>
he followed the ruffians with equal ce∣lerity. They had actually forced the king's apartment at the moment he arrived; and the royal family were listening to the increasing tu∣mult as the harbinger of death,—when all was hushed,—and the door opening in a moment after, the national-guards entered respectfully, saying they came to save the king;—
<Q>and we will save you too gentlemen,</Q>
added they, addressing the body-guards, who were in the chamber.</P>
<P>The vagabonds were now pursued in their turn, and driven from room to room, in the midst of their pillage, for they had already begun to ran∣sack that sumptuously furnished palace. From the palace they repaired to the stables, still intent on plunder, and carried away some horses, which were as quickly retaken. Every where they pur∣sued the body-guards, and every where the generous Parisian troops, forgetting their piqued pride and personal animosity, hazarded their lives to save them.—Till, at length, order was per∣fectly established.</P>
<P>Such was the termination of this most myste∣rious affair; one of the blackest of the machina∣tions that have since the revolution disgraced the dignity of man, and sullied the annals of huma∣nity. Disappointed in their main object, these wretches beheaded two of the guards, who fell into their hands; and hurried away towards the metropolis, with the <HI>insignia</HI> of their atrocity on the points of the barbarous instruments of ven∣geance—showing in every instance, by the dif∣ference of their conduct, that they were a set of monsters, distinct from the people.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="029916_0337_0FE30CBD6C275840"/>Whilst nature shudders at imputing to any one a plan so inhuman, the general character and life of the duke of Orleans warrant the belief, that he was the author of this tumult. And when we compare the singularly ferocious appearance of the mob, with the brutal violation of the apartment of the queen, there remains little doubt, but that a design was on foot against the lives of both her and the king.—Yet in this, and most other instances, the man has wanted courage to consummate his villany, when the plot he had been following up was ripe.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, not the least noble faculty of the mind, to question the motives of action which are repugnant to the feelings of nature, outraging the most sacred feelings of the human soul. But it is the developement of a character that enables us to estimate it's depravity; and had the conduct of that wretch ever varied, the veil of mystery might still have remained unrent, and posterity, hearing of the judgment of the châtelet, would have believed <HI>Egalité</HI> innocent. The court had become highly obnoxious to the nation, and with it the king was implicated, in spite of the efforts of Mirabeau, and some other favourites of the people, to render him respectable; so that there wanted not a plausible reason for suspecting, that the duke might aspire at obtaining the regency, though Louis was neither massacred, nor allowed to escape. But the present scheme being discon∣certed, fear, for a while, damped his ambition: and La F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yette, finding that these suspicious still formed a pretext to excite commotions, with a view to quie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he minds of the Parisians, seconded
<PB N="329" REF="029916_0338_0FE30C5D8EE821B0"/>
the importunities of the duke, who wished to visit England, till the affair blew over. The king, therefore, was prevailed on to give him a nominal commission, to be made use of as a plea to obtain liberty of absence from the assembly, of which he was a member.</P>
<P>He was certainly very apprehensive of an in∣vestigation of the business; and revenge and am∣bition equally giving way to personal fear, he left his colleagues to finish the constitution, and his agents to recover his fame, by representing the story as a calumny of the royalists, against whom the public were sufficiently enraged to credit any aspersion.</P>
<P>The bold tone he assumed the July following was far from being a proof of his innocence; because it was not very probable, that a cunning man should take his measures in such a critical affair without due precaution.—On the contrary, he would labour to sink so entirely into the back∣ground of the plot, a to render it difficult if not impossible, for him to be perceived. And this was practicable to a man, who was willing, in the promotion of his purpose, to dissipate the most splendid fortune.</P>
<P>To a disposition for low intrigue was added also a decided preference of the grossest libertinism, seasoned with vulgarity, highly congenial with the manners of the heroines, who composed the singular army of the females.</P>
<P>Having taken up his abode in the centre of the Palais Royal, a very superb square, yet the last in which a person of any delicacy, not to mention decorum, or morality, would choose to reside; be∣cause,
<PB N="330" REF="029916_0339_0FE30CBEEECC02D0"/>
excepting the people in trade, who found it convenient, it was entirely occupied by the most shameless girls of the town, their hectoring pro∣tectors, gamesters and sharpers of every denomi∣nation. In short, by the vilest women; by wretches, who lived in houses from which the stript bodies, often found in the Seine, were sup∣posed to be thrown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They used to lie to be owned in a conspicuous part of the city.</NOTE>—and he was considered as the grand sultan of this den of iniquity Living thus in the lap of crime, his heart was as tainted as the foul atmosphere he breathed.—Incapable of affection, his amours were the jaundiced caprices of satiety; and having proved in the affair of Keppel and d'Orvilliers, that he wanted the courage of a man, he appears to have been as fit for dark under-hand assassinations as he was unequal to any attempt flowing from virtuous ambition.</P>
<P>That a body of women should put themselves in motion to demand relief of the king, or to re∣monstrate with the assembly respecting their tardy manner of forming the constitution, is scarcely probable; and that they should have undertaken the business, without being instigated by designing persons, when all Paris was dis∣satisfied with the conduct and the procrastination of the assembly, is a belief which the most cre∣dulous will hardly swallow, unless they take into their view, that the want of bread was the bye word used by those, who in a great measure produced it; for perceiving the turn the public

mind was taking, they drove the mob on to per∣petrate the mischief long designed, under the sanc∣tion of national indignation.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the court was not concerned, however desirous the cabinet might have been to render the people discontented with the new order of things; for they seem to have been entirely occupied with the scheme, on which they built the most sanguine expectation, of prevailing on the king to retire to Metz. Besides, the course the project took is a circumstantial evidence, that, designed against Versailles, it was not meditated there.</P>
<P>That the Châtelet should not have been able to substantiate any proof of his guilt, is notin the least extraordinary.—It is only necessary to be acquainted with the general propensity of the French to intrigue, to know that there is no service, however dangerous, or purpose, how∣ever black, for which gold will not find a man. There were wretches, who would have consider∣ed exile as an escape from the continual dread of menaced detection, could they carry with them a sum to commence anew their fraudulent prac∣tices in another country; and money the duke did not spare to gratify his passions, though fordidly mean when they were out of the ques∣tion.</P>
<P>His remaining also in England for such a length of time, merely to avoid disturbing the tranquil∣lity of the state, when it was possible, that by its disorder and agitation he might gain a sceptre, cannot be credited; because it is well known, that he never sacrificed any selfish consideration to the general good. Such examples of self∣denial
<PB N="332" REF="029916_0341_0FE30CC072A32A50"/>
and true patriotism are uncommon, even from the most virtuous men; and it is idle to imagine, that a man, whom all the world al∣lowed to be vicious, should risk the popularity, which he had been at such pains to acquire, un∣less it were to guard his life.</P>
<P>On his return, nevertheless, finding that all was safe, he appeared in the assembly provoking the inquiry from which he had before skulked; and braving detection, when the danger was pas∣sed, he had the address to persuade the public of his innocence. Nay, the mock patriots of the day, pretending to despise princes, were glad to have a prince on their side.</P>
<P>The report, that Mirabeau, always an avowed advocate for a limited monarchy, was concerned in the plot, was certainly a calumny; because it is notorious, that he had an habitual contempt for the duke, which had even produced a de∣cided coolness some time before. And, if any collateral proof of his innocence were necessary, it would be sufficient to add, that the abbé Maury, his competitor in eloquence, and oppo∣nent in opinion, declared there was no ground for his impeachment.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate, indeed, that some of the villains employed were not immediately interro∣gated. The soldier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in chasing them from one quarter to ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, gave proofs not only of their intrepidity, but attachment to the new govern∣ment; and the only reprehensible part of their conduct was suffering the murderers to escape, instead of apprehending as many as they could, and bringing them to condign punishment. Such an omission it was to be feared, would produce
<PB N="333" REF="029916_0342_0FE30C72C5654190"/>
the most fatal consequences, because impunity never fails to stimulate the wretches, who have arrived at such a pitch of wickedness, to com∣mit fresh, and, if possible, still more atrocious crimes; and it is by suspending the decrees of justice, that hardened miscreants, made so by oppression, give full scope to all the brutality of their sanguinary dispositions.</P>
<P>This neglect, in their turn, was not the least reprehensible or fatal error, produced by the fac∣tions of the assembly. The crisis demanded vigour and boldness.—The laws had been tram∣pled on by a gang of banditti the most desperate —The altar of humanity had been profaned— The dignity of freedom had been tarnished—The sanctuary of repose, the asylum of care and fa∣tigue, the chaste temple of a woman, I consider the queen only as one, the apartment where she consigns her senses to the bosom of sleep, folded in its arms forgetful of the world, was violated with murderous fury—The life of the king was assailed, when he had acceded to all their de∣mands—And, when their plunder was snatched from them, they massacred the guards, who were doing their duty.—Yet these brutes were permitted triumphantly to escape—and dignified with the appellation of the people. Their out∣rage was in a great measure attempted to be ex∣cused by those deputies, who sometimes endea∣voured to gain an undue influence through the interposition of the mob.</P>
<P>At this moment the assembly ought to have known, that the future respectability of their laws must greatly depend on the conduct they pursued on the present occasion; and it was time
<PB N="334" REF="029916_0343_0FE30C59D9AAE470"/>
to show the Parisians, that, giving freedom to the nation, they meant to guard it by a strict ad∣herence to the laws, that naturally issue from the simple principles of equal justice they were adopting; punishing with just severity all such as should offer to violate, or treat them with con∣tempt. Wisdom, precision, and courage, are the permanent supports of authority—the durable pillars of every just government, and they only require to be, as it were, the por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cos of the structure, to obtain for it, at once, both the ad∣miration and obedience of the people. To main∣tain subordination in a state by any other means is not merely difficult, but, for any length of time, impossible.</P>
<P>They ought to have stood up as one man in support of insulted justice; and by directing the arm of the law, have smothered in embryo that spirit of rebellion and licentiousness, which, be∣ginning to appear in the metropolis, it was to be feared would attain Herculean strength by im∣punity, and ultimately overturn, with wanton thoughtlessness, or headstrong zeal, all their la∣bours. Yet so contrary was their conduct to the dictates of common sense, and the common firmness of rectitude of intention, that they not only permitted that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g of assassins to regain their dens; but instantly submitted to the demand of the soldiery, and the peremptory wish of the Parisians—that the king should reside within the walls of Paris.</P>
<P>The firmness of conduct, which the repre∣sentatives of a people should always maintain, had been wanting in the assembly from the mo∣ment their power had been acknowledged; for
<PB N="335" REF="029916_0344_0FE30CFB30DDA4C0"/>
instead of being directed by any regular plan of proceeding, a line equally marked out by in∣tegrity and political prudence, they were hurried along by a giddy zeal, and by a burlesque affec∣tation of magnanimity; as puerile as the greater part of their debates were frivolous. Whilst their vanity was gratified by the lively applauses lavished on their inflated and popular declama∣tion, they set fire to the foibles of the multitude, teaching their desperate demagogues to become their rivals in this species of eloquence, till the plans of the leaders of clubs, and popular socie∣ties, were generally admired and pursued.</P>
<P>The will of the people being supreme, it is not only the duty of their representatives to respect it, but their political existence ought to depend on their acting conformably to the will of their constituents. Their voice, in enlightened coun∣tries, is always the voice of reason. But in the infancy of society and during the advancement of the science of political liberty, it is highly neces∣sary for the governing authority to be guided by the progress of that science; and to prevent, by judicious measures, any check being given to its advancement, whilst equal care is taken not to produce the miseries of anarchy by encouraging licentious freedom. The national assembly, how∣ever, delighted with their blooming honours, suffered themselves to be hurried forward by a multitude on whom political light had too sud∣denly flashed, and seemed to have no apprehen∣sion of the danger, which has so fatally resulted from their tame acquiescence.</P>
<P>The people of Paris, who have more than their portion of the national vanity, believed that
<PB N="336" REF="029916_0345_0FE30D32C81FE138"/>
they had produced the revolution; and thinking themselves both the father and mother of all the great events, which had happened since its commencement, and that the national assembly, whose conduct indeed betrayed symptoms of an understanding not adult, ought to be directed by their leading strings, frequently declared, that liberty would not be secured, until the court and the assembly were brought within the walls of the capital. This was the subject of club de∣bates, decided with legislative pomposity, on the rumour of the intended evasion of the king; and the insult offered to the national cockade, the first of October, brought them to the deter∣mination—that it was proper he should be there. —Such was their will, the capital of the nation —now sovereign. Foreseeing also, as they had already dreaded, that the only security for infant freedom would be to guard the court, and place in the centre of information their infant repre∣sentatives; whom they alternately idolized and suspected.</P>
<P>The decorum of manners in a people, long subordinate to the authority of their magistrates, had on several occasions, and even on the fifth of October, controlled the impetuous populace, who had undertaken, or joined in the enterprize; and considering the manner in which they were pushed on, it is extraordinary, that they did not commit greater depredations. For with all their brutality, and eagerness to plunder the palace, they did not attempt to pillage Versailles, though half famished.</P>
<P>The army of La Fayette indeed, principally composed of citizens, behaved not only in an
<PB N="337" REF="029916_0346_0FE30C866B9161A0"/>
irreproachable manner; but the celerity of their movements, their obedience to the discipline which they had so promptly acquired, joined to the clemency and moderation they displayed, ex∣cited the gratitude and respect of all parties.— Still, trembling for the rights that had been so gloriously snatched out of the clinched hand of despotism—it was the wish of all the leaders to have the king at Paris. It was in fact the general sentiment at Paris, and of the greater part of the nation.</P>
<P>That city, which had contributed so essentially in effecting the revolution, viewed with anxiety the influence of a party spirit in the assembly, though themselves split into several political sects, who almost execrated each other. And finding that the indecision of the members had given fresh hopes to the court, which at last might render their emancipation merely a dazzling meteor, they were restlessly bent on having the king and assembly more immediately in their power. The report, likewise, of Louis's intended escape; which had he effected, it was probable, that he would have been in the next place prevailed on to join the discon∣tented princes and nobles, thus producing a schism in the kingdom that must infallibly have brought on not only a cruel civil war, but have embroiled them with all the different powers of Europe; was a still more urgent motive: for whilst they were constantly affecting to believe in the goodness of his heart, they never showed by their conduct, that they had any confidence in his sincerity.—Their opinion of the assembly was equally unfixed.—One day a deputy was
<PB N="338" REF="029916_0347_0FE30D3449FD9630"/>
extolled as the hero of liberty, and the next de∣nounced as a traiterous pensioner of despotism.</P>
<P>These sentiments were dangerous to the au∣thority of the new government; but they were sentiments which never would have been pro∣mulged, even had they existed, had the assembly acted with integrity and magnanimity. Because, though the people do not always reason in the most logical or rhetorical style, yet they generally perceive in what consists the defects of their le∣gislators. And in every free government, when the deputies of the state, convened to form laws, do not act with precision and judgment, they will be sure to lose their respectability; and the consequence will be a dissolution of all au∣thority.</P>
<P>It appears to amount to a certainty, that the assembly did not at that time possess the implicit confidence of the people by their demanding, that the king should be obliged to reside within the barriers of the capital.—It was surely as possible to guard him at Versailles as at Paris; and if it were necessary, that he should be kept as a pri∣soner of state, or hostage, the government was the proper authority to determine how, and where:—and in giving up this necessary privi∣lege of authority, they surrendered their power to the multitude of Paris.</P>
<P>Or rather a minority of the assembly, who wished to be removed to the capital, by exciting and humouring the people, directed the majority; and in the same manner has the dignity of the representative body ever since been trampled under foot by selfishness, or the blind zeal of vanity.—It is in reality from this epocha, not
<PB N="339" REF="029916_0348_0FE30CFD60A18018"/>
forgetting such a leading circumstance, that the commencement of the reign of anarchy may be fairly dated. For, though a tolerable degree of order was preserved a considerable time after, because a multitude long accustomed to servitude do not immediately feel their own strength; yet they soon began to tyrannize over one part of their representatives, stimulated by the other. They, however, continued to respect the decrees of the national assembly especially as there were rarely any passed on which the public opinion had not been previously consulted, directed as it was by the popular members, who gained their constant suffrage by the stale trick of crying out for more freedom. It was the indispensable duty of the de∣puties to respect the dignity of their body.—In∣stead of which for sinister purposes, many of them instructed the people how to tyrannize over the assembly; thus deserting the main principle of representation, the respect due to the majority. This first grand desertion of the principles, which they affected to adopt in all their purity, led to public misery; involving these short-sighted men in the very ruin they had themselves produced by their mean intrigues.</P>
<P>The authoritative demand of the Parisians was striking so directly at the freedom of the assembly, that they must either have been conscious of want∣ing power, or they had no conception of dig∣nity of action, otherwise they would not have suffered the requisition of the people to have been complied with. Yet they seem to have considered it, if it be not parado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ical to assert it, as an advancement of their independenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or, perhaps, as giving security to their authority,
<PB N="340" REF="029916_0349_0FE30D3694CA6EF8"/>
childishly proud of regulating the business of the nation, though under the influence of the Parisian despotism.</P>
<P>It is true, such things are the natural conse∣quence of weakness, the effects of inexperience, and the more fatal errors of cowardice. And such will always be the effects of timid, injudicious measures. Men who have violated the sacred feelings of eternal justice, except they are harden∣ed in vice, are never afterwards able to look honest men in the face; and a legislature, watched by an intelligent public, a public that claims the right of thinking for itself, will never after go beyond it, or pass one decree which is not likely to be popular.</P>
<P>To consult the public mind in a perfect state of civilization, will not only be necessary, but it will be productive of the happiest consequences, generating a government emanating from the sense of the nation, for which alone it can legally exist. The progress of reason being gradual, it is the wisdom of the legislature to advance the simplifi∣cation of it's political system, in a manner best adapted to the state of improvement of the un∣derstanding of the nation. The sudden change which had happened in France, from the most settering tyranny to an unbridled liberty, made it scarcely to be expected, that any thing should be managed with the wisdom of experience: it was morally impossible. But it is nevertheless a deplorable reflection, that such evils must fol∣low every revolution, when a change of politics equally material is required.—Thus it becomes more peculiarly the duty of the historian to re∣cord truth; and comment with freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="029916_0350_0FE30D033AA2FC80"/>Every nation, deprived by the progress of it's civilization of strength of character, in changing it's government from absolute despotism to en∣lightened freedom, will, most probably, be plung∣ed into anarchy, and have to struggle with various species of tyranny before it is able to con∣solidate it's liberty; and that, perhaps, cannot be done, until the manners and amusements of the people are completely changed.</P>
<P>The refinement of the senses, by producing a susceptibility of temper, which from its capricious∣ness leaves no time for reflection, interdic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the exercise of the judgment. The lively effusions of mind, characteristically peculiar to the French, are as violent as the impressions are transitory: and their benevolence evaporating in sudden gusts of sympathy, they become cold in the same pro∣portion as their emotions are quick, and the com∣binations of their fancy brilliant. People who are carried away by the enthusiasm of the mo∣ment, are most frequently betrayed by their ima∣gination, and commit some error, the conviction of which not only damps their heroism, but re∣laxes the nerve of common exertions. Freedom is a solid good, that requires to be treated with reverence and respect.—But, whilst an effeminate race of heroes are contending for her smiles, with all the blandishments of gallantry, it is to their more vigorous and natural posterity, that she will consign herself with all the mild effulgence of artless charms.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The mob demand the king's removal to Paris. This city described. The king repairs to the capital, escorted by a deputation of the national assembly and the Pari∣sian militia. The king's title changed. Proceedings of the national assembly. Reflections on the declaration of rights.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the wild tumult, on the morning of the 6th of October, abated, the king showed himself to the people, in the balcony, and the queen followed with the dauphin in her arms. At first, he vainly attempted to speak; but La Fayette informed the people, that his majesty came forward to assure them, that it should be the business of his life to contribute to the happi∣ness of his people. <HI>The king at Paris,</HI> exclaimed a voice, which was quickly re-echoed by the crowd. 'My children,' replied the king,
<Q>you wish me to be at Paris, and I will go; but it is on the condition, that my wife and family accompany me.</Q>
A loud shout of <HI>vive le r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i</HI> testified the ecstacy of the moment. The king made a sign to demand silence; and then, with tears in his eyes addressed them again.—
<Q>Ah! my children, run to the relief of my guards.</Q>
Immediately two or three appeared in the bal∣cony with the national cockade in their hats, or the cap of liberty on their heads. The king threw his arms round one of them, and the peo∣ple
<PB N="343" REF="029916_0352_0FE30C7ED4ACD0F0"/>
following his example embraced those whom they had taken prisoners in the court. One sentiment of gladness seemed to animate the whole concourse of people; and their sensibility pro∣duced as mad demonstrations of joy as lately had been displayed of ferocity. The soldiery all mingled together, exchanging swords, hats, or shoulder belts—exhibiting in the most striking manner the prominent features of the French character.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the assembly, instead of instantly examining into the particulars of that alarming convulsion, and exerting themselves to cause a proper respect to be paid to the sovereignty of the law, childishly gave way to the universal transport: instead of considering the peremptory wish of the people to remove the king to Paris as a distrust of their wisdom, as well as of the veracity of the court, which was in some measure the case, they unanimously agreed to the motion of Mirabeau, seconded by Barnave,
<Q>that the king and assembly should not be separated du∣ring the present sessions.</Q>
Mirabeau, and other popular members, were probably glad to have the person of the king secured, without being obliged to appear, in an ostensible manner, in the affair; because they always endeavoured to keep a little hold on the court, whilst they led the people. Such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the pitiful shifts of men, who are not guided by the compass of moral prin∣ciples, which alone render the character dignifi∣ed or consistent. Readily then acquiescing in a measure the most fatal and contemptible, they decreed, that the assembly was inseparable from the person of the king, and sent a deputation
<PB N="344" REF="029916_0353_0FE30D3F9B20E688"/>
to inform him of this resolve, previous to his departure.</P>
<P>That Louis, finding all his projects for the present defeated, and after such a narrow escape for his life, should readily have acceded to the demand of the multitude, is not in the least ex∣traordinary.—But that the representatives of the nation should, without resistance or remonstrance, have surrendered their authority, and thrown themselves head-long into the heart of a city, which could be suddenly agitated, and put into the most disorderly and dangerous commotion, by the intrigues or folly of any desperate or factious leader of the multitude—suffering them∣selves to be environed by it's wall, shut in by it's barriers —in a word—choosing to live in a capa∣cious prison; for men forced, or drawn into any such situation, are in reality slaves or prisoners, —almost surpasses belief. This absurd conduct, in fact, can be accounted for only by considering the national character, and the different though equally interested views, of the court and popular parties, in the assembly.</P>
<P>Independent of the additional incense of praise, with which Mirabeau wished to be continually regaled, in the metropolis, he had a decided pre∣ference for it, frequently asserting, that it was the only place where society was truly desir∣able; the people and place, in spite of their vices and follies, equally attaching the taste they cultivated.</P>
<P>Exclaiming against capitals, the impartial ob∣server must acknowledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that much has been done to render this a superb monument of human ingenuity.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="029916_0354_0FE30D0583240038"/>The entrance into Paris, by the Thuilleries, is certainly very magnificent. The roads have an expansion that agrees with the idea of a large luxurious city, and with the beauty of the build∣ings in the noble square, that first attracts the traveller's eye. The lofty trees on each side of the road, forming charming alleys, in which the people walk and lounge with an easy gaiety pecu∣liar to the nation, seem calculated equally to secure their health and promote their pleasure. The bar∣riers, likewise, are stately edifices, that tower with grandeur, rendering the view, as the city is ap∣proached, truly picturesque.</P>
<P>But—these very barriers, built by Calonne, who liked to have Paris compared with Athens, excite the most melancholy reflections.—They were first erected by despotism to secure the payment of an oppressive tax, and since have satally assisted to render anarchy more violent by concentration, cutting off the possibility of innocent victims esca∣ping from the fury, or the mistake, of the moment. —Thus miscreants have had sufficient influence to guard these barriers, and caging the objects of their fear or vengeance, have slaughtered them; or, violating the purity of justice, have coolly wrested laws hastily formed to serve sinister designs—changing its sacred sword into a dagger, and terming the assassin's stab the stroke of justice, because given with the mock ceremonials of equity, which only rendered the crime more atrocious. The tyrant, who, bounding over all restraint, braves the eternal law he tramples on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not half so detestable as the reptile who crawls under the shelter of the principles he violates, Such has been the effect of the enclosure of Paris:
<PB N="296" REF="029916_0355_0FE30C675846AD08"/>
and the reflections of wounded humanity disen∣chanting the senses, the elegant structures, which served as gates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s great prison, no longer ap∣pear magnificen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>Still the eye of taste rests with pleasure on it's buildings and decorations: proportion and har∣mony gratify the sight, whilst airy ornaments seem to toss a simple, playful elegance around. The heavens too smile, diffusing fragrance: and as the inhabitants trip along the charming boule∣vard, the genial atmosphere seems instantaneously to inspire the animal spirits▪ which give birth to the varied g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es that gli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e around.

<P>Why starts the tear of anguish to mingle with recollections that sentiment fosters—even in obe∣dience to reason?—For it is wise to be happy! —and nature and virtue will always open inlets of joy to the heart. But how quickly vanishes this prospect of delights! of delights such as man ought to taste!—The cavalcade of death moves along, shedding mildew over all the beauties of the scene, and blasting every joy! The ele∣gan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the palaces and buildings is revolting, when they are viewed as prisons, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>right∣liness of the people disgusting, when they are hastening to view the operations of the guillotine, or carelessly pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing over the earth stained with blood. Exasperated humanity then, with bitter∣ness of soul, devotes the city to destruction; whilst turning from such a nest of crimes, it seeks
<PB N="347" REF="029916_0356_0FE30D0706862A80"/>
for consolation only in the conviction, that, as the world is growing wiser, it must become happier; and that, as the cultivation of the soil meliorates a climate, the improvement of the un∣derstanding will prevent those baneful excesses of passion which poison the heart.</P>
<P>A deputation of the national assembly ac∣companied the royal family to Paris, as well as the Parisian militia. A number of the women preceded them, mounted on the carriages which they had taken in their way to Versailles, and on the cannons, covered with national cockades, and dragging in the dirt those that were considered as symbols of aristocracy. Soon after they set out, either by chance, or, which is more proba∣ble, pursuant to a plan contrived by some person in power, forty or fifty loads of wheat and flour fell into the procession, just before the king, giving weight to the exclamation of the popu∣lace, that they had brought the baker and his family to town.</P>
<P>The assembly continued to sit at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailles till the nineteenth; and several interesting debates were entered upon, particularly one brought for∣ward by the bishop of Autun, respecting the ap∣propriation of the estates of the clergy to supply the exigencies of the government. The abolition of <HI>lettres de cachet</HI> was considered, and a fresh organization of the municipalities proposed; but as none of these motions were carried before they were more fully discussed at Paris, it seems best to bring the different arguments on those important subjects under one point of view.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="029916_0357_0FE30D411E8971A0"/>Settling the articles of the constitution, how∣ever, which previously occupied them, several frivolous discussions, respecting the style of ex∣pression to be adopted to signify the king's ac∣ceptance of their decrees, were lengthened out with warmth, and puerile objections made to ancient forms—that were merely forms. After some disputation, the title of the monarch was changed from king of France, with the rest of the formule, for that of king of the French; because Rousseau had remarked, perhaps fas∣tidiously, that the title ought to express rather the chief of the people, than the master of the soil.</P>
<P>The intended removal of the assembly to Paris also produced several warm debates. This reso∣lution, indeed, excited, not without reason, ap∣prehensions in the breasts of some of the deputies, relative to their personal safety, should they, in future, venture to oppose any of the motions of the popular party, which that party instructed the mob of Paris to support.</P>
<P>The president, Mounier, pleading his bad state of health, begged to be dismissed; and Lally-Tolendal, thinking that he could not stem the torrent, retired from public business at the same time. A great many of the members hinting their fears, that the assembly would not be free at Paris, on varions pretexts demanded such a number of passports, as to make the president express some apprehension lest the assembly should thus indirectly dissolve itself, whilst other depu∣ties uttered a profusion of indecent sarcasms on a conduct, which the behaviour of the populace, and even of these very orators, seemed to justify.
<PB N="349" REF="029916_0358_0FE30D088933E178"/>
Mirabeau, who so earnestly desired to be at Paris, ridiculed with unbecoming bitterness every opposition made to the removal of the assembly; yet, listening to the representation, that the al∣lowing so many malcontents to retire into the provinces might produce dangerous fermenta∣tions, he proposed that no passport should be granted, till the deputy who demanded it had made known his reason for so doing to the as∣sembly. A letter from the king, notifying his intention of residing most part of his time at Paris, and expressing his assurance, that they did not mean to separate themselves from him, now requested them to send commissioners to Paris, to search for a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place, where they might in future hold their sessions. They accordingly de∣termined to go thither, conformably to the decree of the sixth of October, when a convenient situa∣tion should be found.</P>
<P>After this determination several members gave an account of the gross insults they had received at Paris. One in particular, who was not ob∣noxious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the public, narrowly escaped with his life, only because he was mistaken for a de∣puty against whom the mob had vowed ven∣geance. Another, who had also been insulted, with proper spirit moved, that a decree respect∣ing libels should instantly be passed. 'Are we,' he asked,
<Q>to be led to liberty only by licentious∣ness? No; the people deceived and intoxicated, are rendered furious. How many times (he added) have I lamented the impetuosity of this assembly, who have accustomed the public, seated in our galleries, to praise, to blame, to deride our opinions, without understanding

them.—And who has inspired them with this audacity?</Q>
—He was interrupted by signs of disapprobation; and personalties now disgraced the debate, in which Mirabeau mingled satiri∣cal observations and retorts, that did more cre∣dit to his abilities than to his heart. But, a day or two after, recollecting himself, he pre∣sented the plan of a decree to prevent riots, which he introduced, by saying, that it was an imitation, though not a copy, of the English riot act.</P>
<P>The evening before the departure of the assem∣bly for Paris, passports being still demanded with earnestness, a decree was made,
<Q>that passports should be granted only for a short and deter∣minate time, on account of urgent business; and that unlimited passports, in cases of ill health, should not be granted before the depu∣ties were replaced by their substitutes;</Q>
and further, cutting a knot that might have revived old claims and animosities, had it been brought forward alone, they decreed,
<Q>that in future the substitutes should be nominated by the citizens at large; and that, eight days after the first session at Paris, there should be a call of the house; suspending till then the consideration of the propriety of printing and sending to the provinces the list of the absent deputies.</Q></P>
<P>The constraining so many members to remain at their posts, and condemning a man to a state of ignominious servitude, whilst they were talking of nothing but liberty, was as contemptibly little, as the policy was injudicious. For if the king pretended to acquiesce in their measures the better to disguise his real intention, which doubt∣less

was to fly as soon as he could find an oppor∣tunity, or was at liberty, what did they gain? For as they must have known, that his emanci∣pation would be the consequence of his acceptance of the constitution, his imprisonment could only tend to retard their operations: yet they had neither the magnanimity to allow him to depart with an handsome sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end, if such were his wish; nor to grant him such a portion of power, in the new constitution, as would, by rendering him respectable in his own eyes, have reconciled him to the deprivation of the rest. But, as things were settled, it was morally certain, that, when∣ever his friends were ready, a blow would be directed against them, which they were then as well prepared to meet as they could be at a subse∣quent period.</P>
<P>Under the influence of fixed systems, cer∣tain moral effects are as infallible as physical.— That every insiduous attempt would be made by the courts of Europe, to overturn the new go∣vernment of France, was therefore certain; and, unless they had all been overturned at the same time, was as much to be expected as any effect from a natural cause. The most likely mean then to have parried the evil would have been a decided firmness of conduct, which, flowing from a real love of justice, produces true magnanimity; and not a parading affectation of the virtues of Romans, with the degenerate minds of their posterity.</P>
<P>Precision, wisdom, and courage, never fail to secure the admiration and respect of all de∣scriptions of people; and every government thus directed will keep in awe its licentious neigh∣bours.
<PB N="352" REF="029916_0361_0FE30C74F97A1C80"/>
But fear and timidity betray symptoms of weakness, that, creating contempt and disre∣spect, encourage the attempts of ambitious des∣pots; so that the noblest causes are sometimes ruined or vilified by the folly or indiscretion of their directors. All Europe saw, and all good men saw with dread, that the French had under∣taken to support a cause, which they had neither sufficient purity of heart, nor maturity of judge∣ment to conduct with moderation and prudence; whilst malevolence has been gratified by the errors they have committed, attributing that imperfection to the theory they adopted, which was applicable only to the folly of their prac∣tice.</P>
<P>However, Frenchmen have reason to rejoice, and posterity will be grateful, for what was done by the assembly.</P>
<P>The economy of government had been so ably treated by the writers of the present age, that it was impossible for them, acting on the great scale of public good, not to lay the foundations of many useful plans, as they reformed many grievous and grinding abuses.—Accordingly we find, though they had not sufficient penetration to foresee the dreadful consequences of years of anarchy, the probable result of their manner of proceeding, still by following, in some degree, the instructions of their constituents, who had digested, from the bright lines of philosophical truths, the prominent rules of political science, they, in laying the main pillars of the constitu∣tion, established beyond a possibility of oblitera∣tion, the great principles of liberty and equality.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="029916_0362_0FE30D113612F0F8"/>It is allowed by all parties, that civilization is a blessing, so far as it gives security to person and property, and the milder graces of taste to society and manners. If, therefore, the polish∣ing of man, and the improvement of his intellect, become necessary to secure these advantages, it follows, of course, that the more general such improvement grows, the greater the extension of human happiness.</P>
<P>In a savage state man is distinguished only by superiority of genius, prowess, and eloquence. I say eloquence, for I believe, that in this stage of society he is most eloquent because most natural. For it is only in the progress of go∣vernments, that hereditary distinctions, cruelly abridging rational liberty, have prevented man from rising to his just point of elevation, by the exercise of his improvable faculties.</P>
<P>That there is a superiority of natural genius among men does not admit of dispute; and that in countries the most free there will always be distinctions proceeding from superiority of judg∣ment, and the power of acquiring more delicacy of taste, which may be the effect of the peculiar organization, or whatever cause produces it, is an incontestible truth. But it is a palpable error to suppose, that men of every class are not equally susceptible of common improvement: if therefore it be the contrivance of any government, to pre∣clude from a chance of improvement the greater part of the citizens of the state, it can be con∣sidered in no other light tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a monstrous tyranny, a barbarous oppression, equally injuri∣ous to the two parties, though in different ways. For all the advantages of civilization cannot be
<PB N="354" REF="029916_0363_0FE30D52D3A87880"/>
felt unless it pervades the whole mass, human∣izing every description of men—and then it is the first of blessings, the true perfection of man.</P>
<P>The melioration of the old government of France arose entirely from a degree of urbanity acquired by the higher class, which insensibly produced, by a kind of natural courtesy, a small portion of civil liberty. But, as for political liberty, there was not the shadow of it; or could it ever have been generated under such a system: because, whilst men were prevented not only from arriving at public offices, or voting for the nomination of others to fill them, but even from attaining any distinct idea of what was meant by liberty in a practical sense, the great bulk of the people were worse than savages; retaining much of the ignorance of barbarians, after having poisoned the noble qualities of na∣ture by imbibing some of the habits of degene∣rate refinement. To the national assembly it is, that France is indebted for having prepared a simple code of instruction, containing all the truths necessary to give a comprehensive percep∣tion of political science; which will enable the ignorant to climb the mount of knowledge, whence they may view the ruins of the inge∣nious fabric of despotism, that had so long dis∣graced the dignity of man by its odious and de∣basing claims.</P>
<P>The declaration of rights contains an aggregate of principles the most beneficial; yet so simple, that the most ordinary capacity cannot fail to com∣prehend their import. It begins by asserting, that the rights of man are equal, and that no mental
<PB N="355" REF="029916_0364_0FE30D12B9979B48"/>
distinctions can exist in a wholesome government, but what are founded on public utility. Then showing, that political associations are intended only for the preservation of the natural and im∣prescriptible rights of man, which are his liberty, security of property, and resistance against op∣pression; and asserting also, that the nation is the source of all sovereignty; it delineates, in a plain and perspicuous manner, in what these rights, and this sovereignty, consist. In this delineation men may learn, that, in the exercise of their natural rights, they have the power of doing whatever does not injure another; and that this power has no limits, which are not de∣termined by law—the laws being at the same time an expression of the will of the community, because all the citizens of the state, either per∣sonally or by their representatives, have a right to concur in the formation.</P>
<P>Thus, having taught the citizens the funda∣mental principles of a legitimate government, it proceeds to show how the opinion of each may be ascertained; which he has a right to give personally or by his representatives, to determine the necessity of public contributions, their appro∣priation, mode of assessment, and duration.</P>
<P>The simplicity of these principles, prom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lged by the men of genius of the last and present ages, and their justness, acknowledged by every description of unprejudiced men, had not been re∣cognized by any senate or government in Europe; and it was an honour worthy to be reserved for the representatives of twenty-five millions of men, rising to the sense and feeling of rational beings, to be the first to dare to ratify such sacred and
<PB N="356" REF="029916_0365_0FE30C79B5D04A78"/>
beneficial truths—truths, the existence of which had been eternal; and which required only to be made known, to be generally acknowledged —truths, which have been fostered by the ge∣nius of philosophy, whilst hereditary wealth and the bayonet of despotism have continually been opposed to their establishment.</P>
<P>The publicity of a government acting con∣formably to the principles of reason, in contra∣distinction to the maxims of oppression, affords the people a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> opportunity, or at least a chance, of judging of the wisdom and moderation of their ministers; and the eye of discernment, when permitted to make known its observations, will always prove a check on the profligacy or dangerous ambition of aspiring men.—So that in contemplating the extension of representative systems of polity, we have solid ground on which to rest the expectation—that wars and their ca∣lamitous effects will become less frequent in pro∣portion as the people, who are obliged to support them with their sweat and blood, are consulted respecting their necessity and consequences.</P>
<P>Such consultations can take place under re∣presentative systems of government only—under systems which demand the responsibility of their ministers, and secure the publicity of their poli∣tical conduct. The mysteries of courts, and the intrigues of their parisites, have continually de∣luged Europe with the blood of its most worthy and heroic citizens, and there is no specific cure for such evils but by enabling the people to form an opinion respecting the subject of dispute.</P>
<P>The court of Versailles, with powers the most ample, was the most busy and insidious of any

in Europe; and the horrors which she has occa∣sioned at different periods, were as incalculable, as her ambition was unbounded, and her councils base, unprincipled, and dishonourable. If, then, it were only for abolishing her sway, Europe ought to be thankful for a change, that, by altering the political systems of the most im∣proved quarter of the globe, must ultimately lead to universal freedom, virtue, and happiness.</P>
<P>But it is to be presumed, when the efferves∣cence, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h now agitates the prejudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the whole continent, subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, the justness of the principles brought forward in the declaration of the rights of men and ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, will be generally granted; and that governments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n future, ac∣quiring reason and dignity, feeling for the suf∣ferings of the people, whilst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>probating the sacrilege of tyranny, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make it their principal object to counteract its baneful tendency, by restra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning within just bounds the ambition of individuals.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Progress of reform. The Encyclopedie. Liberty of the press. Capitals. The br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch not properly qualified for the revolution. Savage compare with civi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zed man. Effects of extravagance—of commence—and of manufactures. Excuse for the ferocity of the Parisians.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PEOPLE thinking for themselves have more energy in their voice, than any govern∣ment, which it is possible for human wisdom to invent; and every government not aware of this sacred truth will, at some period, be suddenly overturned. Whilst men in a savage state preserve their independence. they adopt no regular system of policy, nor ever attempt to digest their rude code of laws into a constitution, to ensure poli∣tical liberty. Consequently we find in every country after its civilization has arrived at a cer∣tain height, that the people, the moment they are displeased with their rulers, begin to clamour against them; and, finally rejecting all authority but their own will, in breaking the shackles of folly or tyranny, they glut their resentment by the mischievous destruction of the works of ages, only considering them as the monuments of their servitude.</P>
<P>From the social disposition of man, in propor∣tion as he becomes civilized, he will mingle more and more with society. The first interest
<PB N="359" REF="029916_0368_0FE30D19CCFBA778"/>
he takes in the business of his fellow-men is in that of his neighbour; next he contemplates the comfort, misery, and happiness of the nation to which he belongs, investigates the degree of wisdom and justice in the political system, under which he lives, and, striding into the regions of science, his researches embrace all human kind. Thus he is enabled to estimate the portion of evil or good which the government of his coun∣try produces, compared with that of others; and the comparison, granting him superior pow∣ers of mind, leads hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to conceive a model of a more perfect form.</P>
<P>This spirit of inquiry first manifests itself in hamlets; when his views of improvement are confined to local advantages: but the approxi∣mation of different districts leading to further intercourse, roads of communication are opened, until a central or favourite spot becomes the vor∣tex of men and things. Then the rising spires, pompous domes, and majestic monuments, point out the capital; the focus of information, the reservoir of genius, the school of arts▪ the seat of voluptuous gratification, and the hot-bed of vice and immorality.</P>
<P>The centrifugal rays of knowledge and science now stealing through the empire, the whole intel∣lectual faculties of man partake of their influ∣ence, and one general sentiment governs the civil and political body. In the progress of these improvements the state undergoing a variety of changes, the happiness or misery produced occa∣sions a diversity of opinions; and to prevent con∣fusion, absolute governments have been tolerated by the most enlightened part of the people. But,
<PB N="360" REF="029916_0369_0FE30D5FCDDC2050"/>
probably, this toleration was merely the effect of the strong social feelings of men; who prefer∣red tranquility, and the prosperity of their coun∣try, to a resistance, which, judging from the ignorance of their fellow citizens, they believed would bring more harm than good in it's train. In short, however long a combination of tyranny has retarded the progress, it has been one of the advantages of the large cities of Europe, to light up the sparks of reason, and to extend the prin∣ciples of truth.</P>
<P>Such is the good and evil flowing from the capitals of states, that during the infancy of governments, though they tend to corrupt and enervate the mind, they accelerate the introduc∣tion of science, and give the tone to the national sentiments and taste.</P>
<P>But this influence is extremely gradual; and it requires a great length of time, for the remote corners of the empire to experience either the one, or the other of these effects. Hence we have seen the inhabitants of a metropolis feeble and vitiated, and those of the provinces robust and virtuous. Hence we have seen oppositions in a city (riots as they are called) to illegal govern∣ments instantly defeated, and their leaders hanged or tortured; because the judgment of the state was not sufficiently matured to support the strug∣gle of the unhappy victims in a righteous cause. And hence it has happened, that the despots of the world have found it necessary to maintain large standing armies, in order to counteract the effects of truth and reason.</P>
<P>The continuation of the feudal system, how∣ever, for a great length of time, by giving an
<PB N="361" REF="029916_0370_0FE30D1BD38DC878"/>
overgrown influence to the nobility of France, had contributed, in no small degree, to counter∣act the despotism of her kings. Thus it was not until after the arbitrary administration of Riche∣lieu, who had terrified the whole order by a tyranny peculiar to himself, that the insidious Mazarine broke the independent spirit of the na∣tion by introducing the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of honours; and that Louis XIV. by the magnificence of his follies, and the meretricious dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations of stars, crosses, and other marks of distinction, or badges of slavery, drew the nobles from their castles; and, by concentrating the pleasures and wealth of the kingdom in Paris, the luxury of the court became commensurate to the product of the nation. Besides, the encouragement given to enervating pleasures, and the venality of titles, purchased either with money, or ignoble services, soon rendered the nobility as notorious for effeminacy as they had been illustrious for heroism in the days of the gallant Henry.</P>
<P>The arts had already formed a school, and men of science and literature were hurrying from every part of the kingdom to the metropolis, in search of employment and of honour; and whilst it was giving it's tone to the empire, the Parisian taste was pervading Europe.</P>
<P>The vanity of leading the fashions, in the higher orders of society, is not the smallest weak∣ness produced by the sluggishness into which people of quality naturally fall. The depravity of manners, and the sameness of pleasure, which compose a life of idleness, are sure to produce an insupportable <HI>ennui;</HI> and, in proportion to the stupidity of the man, or as his sensibility be∣comes
<PB N="362" REF="029916_0371_0FE30D61512776D8"/>
deadened, he has recourse to variety, find∣ing a zest only from a new creation of charms; and commonly the most unnatural are necessary to rouse sickly, fastidious senses. Still in the same degree as the refinement of sentiment, and the improvement of taste advance, the company of celebrated literary characters is sought after with avidity; and from the prevalence of fashion, the empire of wit succeeds the reign of formal insipidity, after the squeamish palate has been rendered delicate even by the nauseous banquets of voluptuousness.</P>
<P>This is the natural consequence of the improve∣ment of manners, the harbinger of reason; and from the ratio of it's advancement throughout society, we are enabled to estimate the progress of political science. For no sooner had the dis∣quisition of philosophical subjects become general in the select parties of amusement, extending by degrees to every class of society, than the rigour of the ancient government of France began to soften; till it's mildness became so considerable, that superficial observers have attributed the ex∣ercise of lenity in the administration to the wisdom and excellence of the system itself.</P>
<P>A confederacy of philosophers, whose opinions furnished the food of colloquial entertainment, gave a turn for instructive and useful reading to the leaders of circles, and drew the attention of the nation to the principles of political and civil government. Whilst by the compilation of the Encyclopedia, the repository of their thoughts, as an abstract work, they eluded the dangerous vigilance of absolute ministers; thus in a body disseminating those truths in the economy of
<PB N="363" REF="029916_0372_0FE30C6FBB2FBFA8"/>
finance, which, perhaps they would not have had sufficient courage separately to have produced in individual publications; or, if they had, they would most probably have been suppressed.</P>
<P>This is one of the few instances of an associa∣tion of men becoming useful, instead of being cramped by joint exertions. And the cause is clear:—the work did not require a little party spirit; but each had a distinct subject of investi∣gation to pursue with solitary energy. His desti∣nation was traced upon a calm sea, which could not expose him to the Scylla or Charybdis of vanity or interest.</P>
<P>The economists, carrying away the palm from their opponents, showed that the prosperity of a state depends on the freedom of industry; that talents should be permitted to find their level; that the unshackling of commerce is the only secret to render it flourishing, and answer more effectually the ends for which it is politi∣cally necessary; and that the imposts should be laid upon the surplus remaining, after the hus∣bandman has been reimbursed for his labour and expences.</P>
<P>Ideas so new, and yet so just and simple, could not fail to produce a great effect on the minds of Frenchmen; who, constitutionally attached to novelty and ingenious speculations, were sure to be enamoured with a prospect of consolidating the great advantages of such a novel and enlightened system; and without calculating the danger of attacking old prejudices; nay, without ever con∣sidering, that it was a much easier task to pull down than to build up, they gave themselves little trouble to examine the gradual steps by which
<PB N="364" REF="029916_0373_0FE30D688F84C358"/>
other countries have attained their degree of political improvement.</P>
<P>The many vexatious taxes, which under the French government not only enervated the exer∣tions of unprivileged persons, stagnating the live stream of trade, but were extremely teasing in∣conveniences to every private man, who could not travel from one place to another without being stopped at barriers, and searched by offi∣cers of different descriptions, were almost insu∣perable impediments in the way of the improve∣ments of industry. and the abridgment of liberty was not more grievous in its pecuniary conse∣quences, than in the personal mortification of being compelled to observe regulations as trou∣blesome as they were at variance with sound policy.</P>
<P>Irritations of the temper produce more poig∣nant sensations of disgust than serious injuries. Frenchmen, indeed, had been so long accustomed to these vexatious forms, that, like the ox who is daily yoked, they were no longer galled in spirit, or exhaled their angry ebullitions in a song. Still it might have been supposed, that after re∣flecting little, and talking much, about the subli∣mity and superior excellence of the plans of <HI>French</HI> writers above those of other nations, they would become as passionate for liberty, as a man restrained by some idle religious vow is to possess a mistress, to whose charms the imagination has lent all its own world of graces.</P>
<P>Besides, the very manner of living in France gives a lively turn to the character of the people; for by the destruction of the animal juices, in dressing their food, they are subject to none of
<PB N="365" REF="029916_0374_0FE30D1D55345C28"/>
that dulness, the effect of more nutritive diet in other countries; and this gaiety is increased by the moderate quantity of weak wine, which they drink at their meals, bidding desiance to phlegm. The people also living entirely in villages and towns are more social; so that the tone of the capital, the instant it had a note distinct from that of the court, became the key of the nation; though the inhabitants of the provinces polished their manners with less danger to their morals, or natural simplicity of character. But this mode of peopling the country tended more to civilize the inhabitants, than to change the face of the soil, or lead to agricultural improvements. For it is by residing in the midst of their land, that farmers make the most of it, in every sense of the word— so that the rude state of husbandry, and the awk∣wardness of the implements used by these inge∣nious people, may be imputed solely to this cause.</P>
<P>The situation of France was likewise very fa∣vourable for collecting the information acquired in other parts of the world. Paris, having been made a thoroughfare to all the kingdoms on the con∣tinent, received in its bosom strangers from every quarter; and itself resembling a full hive, the very drones buzzed into every corner all the sentiments of liberty, which it is possible for a people to possess, who have never been en∣lightened by the broad sunshine of freedom; yet more romantically enthusiastic, probably for that very reason. Paris, therefore, having not only disseminated information, but presented herself as a bulwark to oppose the despotism of the court, standing the brunt of the fray, seems with some
<PB N="366" REF="029916_0375_0FE30C7BCE1437B0"/>
reason, to pride herself on being the author of the revolution.</P>
<P>Though the liberty of the press had not exist∣ed in any part of the world, England and Ame∣rica excepted, still the disquisition of political questions had long occupied the intelligent parts of Europe; and in France, more than in any country, books written with licentious freedom were handed from house to house with the cir∣cumspection that irritates curiosity. Not to lay great stress on the universality of the language, which made one general opinion on the benefits arising from the advancement of science and rea∣son pervade the neighbouring states, particularly Germany; where original compositions began to take place of that laborious erudition, which being employed only in the elucidation of ancient writers, the judgment lies dormant, or is merely called into action to weigh the import of words rather than to estimate the value of things. In Paris, likewise, a knot of ingenious if not pro∣found writers, twinkled their light into every circle; for being caressed by the great, they did not inhabit the homely recesses of indigence, rusticating their manners as they cultivated their understandings; on the contrary, the finesse re∣quired to convey their free sentiments in their books, broken into the small shot of innuendoes, gave an oiliness to their conversation, and en∣abled them to take the lead at tables, the volup∣tuousness of which was grateful to philosophers, rather of the epicurean than the stoic sect.</P>
<P>It had long been the fashion to talk of liberty, and to dispute on hypothetical and logical points
<PB N="367" REF="029916_0376_0FE30D1F695ED5E8"/>
of political economy; and these disputations dis∣seminated gleams of truth, and generated more demagogues than had ever appeared in any mo∣dern city.—The number exceeded, perhaps, any comparison with that of Athens itself.</P>
<P>The habit also of passing a part of most of their evenings at some theatre, gave them an ear for harmony of language, and a fastidious taste for sheer declamation, in which a sentimental jargon extinguishes all the simplicity and fire of passion; the great number of play-houses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are upwards of thirty scattered throughout the city.</NOTE>, and the moderate prices of the pit and different ranges of boxes, bringing it within the compass of every citizen to frequent the amusement so much be∣loved by the French.</P>
<P>The arrangement of sounds, and the adjust∣ment of masculine and feminine rhymes, being the secrets of their poetry, the pomp of diction gives a semblance of grandeur to common obser∣vations and hackneyed sentiments; because the French language, though copious in the phrases that give each shade of sentiment, has not, like the Italian, the English, the German, a phraseo∣logy peculiar to poetry; yet its happy turns, equivocal, nay even concise expressions, and nu∣merous epithets, which, when ingeniously appli∣ed, convey a sentence, or afford matter for half a dozen, make it better adapted to oratorical flourishes than that of any other nation. The French therefore are all rhetoricians, and they have a singular fund of superficial knowledge, caught in the tumult of pleasure from the shallow
<PB N="368" REF="029916_0377_0FE30D6A114B8168"/>
stream of conversation; so that if they have not the depth of thought which is obtained only by contemplation, they have all the shrewd∣ness of sharpened wit; and their acquirements are so near their tongue's end, that they never miss an opportunity of saying a pertinent thing, or tripping up, by a smart retort, the arguments with which they have not strength fairly to wrestle.</P>
<P>Every political good carried to the extreme must be productive of evil; yet every poison has its antidote; and there is a pitch of luxury and refinement, which, when reached, will overturn all the absolute governments in the world. The ascertainment of these antidotes is a task the most difficult; and whilst it remains imperfect, a num∣ber of men will continue to be the victims of mistaken applications. Like the empirics, who bled a patient to death to prevent a mortification from becoming fatal, the tyrants of the earth have had recourse to cutting off the heads, or torturing the bodies, of those persons who have attempted to check their sway, or doubt their omnipotence. But, though thousands have pe∣rished the victims of empirics, and of despots, yet the improvements made both in medicine and moral philosophy have kept a sure, though gradual pace.—And, if men have not clearly discovered a specific remedy for every evil, phy∣sical, moral, and political, it is to be presumed, that the accumulation of experimental facts will greatly tend to lessen them in future.</P>
<P>Whilst, therefore, the sumptuous galas of the court of France were the grand source of the re∣finement of the arts, taste became the antidote
<PB N="369" REF="029916_0378_0FE30D248E5B6658"/>
to <HI>ennui;</HI> and when sentiment had taken place of chivalrous and gothic tournaments, the reign of philosophy succeeded that of the imagination. And though the government, enveloped in pre∣cedents, adjusted still the idle ceremonials, which were no longer imposing, blind to the impercep∣tible change of things and opinions, as if their faculties were bound by an eternal frost, the pro∣gress was invariable; till, reaching a certain point, Paris, which from the particular formation of the empire had been such an useful head to it, began to be the cause of dreadful calamities, ex∣tending from individuals to the nation, and from the nation to Europe. Thus it is, that we are led to blame those, who, insist, that, because a state of things has been productive of good, it is always respectable; when, on the contrary, the endeavouring to keep alive any hoary esta∣blishment, beyond its natural date, is often per∣nicious and always useless.</P>
<P>In the infancy of governments, or rather of civilization, courts seem to be necessary to accele∣rate the improvement of arts and manners, to lead to that of science and morals. Large capi∣tals are the obvious consequences of the riches and luxury of courts; but as, after they have arrived at a certain magnitude and degree of re∣finement, they become dangerous to the freedom of the people, and incompatible with the safety of a republican government, it may be questioned whether Paris will not occasion more disturbance in settling the new order of things, than is equi∣valent to the good she produced by accelerating the epocha of the revolution.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="029916_0379_0FE30D6BAD922340"/>However, it appears very certain, that should a republican government be consolidated, Paris must rapidly crumble into decay. Its rise and splendor were owing chiefly, if not entirely, to the old system of government; and since the foundation of its luxury has been shaken, and it is not likely that the disparting structure will ever again rest securely on its basis, we may fairly infer, that in proportion as the charms of solitary reflection and agricultural recreations are felt, the people, by leaving the villages and cities, will give a new complexion to the face of the country—and we may then look for a turn of mind more solid, principles more fixed, and a conduct more con∣sistent and virtuous.</P>
<P>The occupations and habits of life have a won∣derful influence on the forming mind; so great, that, the superinductions of art stop the growth of the spontaneous shoots of nature, till it is dif∣ficult to distinguish natural from factitious morals and feelings; and as the energy of thinking will always proceed, in a great measure, either from our education or manner of living, the frivolty of the French character may be accounted for, with∣out taking refuge in the old hiding place of ig∣norance—occult causes.</P>
<P>When it is the object of education, to prepare the pupil to please every body, and of course to deceive, accomplishments are the one thing need∣ful; and the desire to be admired ever being uppermost, the passions are subjugated, or all drawn into the whirlpool of egotism <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I use this word according to the French acceptation, because we have not one to express so forcibly the same signification.</NOTE>. This
<PB N="371" REF="029916_0380_0FE30D26CDFB50B0"/>
gives to each person, however different the tem∣per, a tincture of vanity, and that weak vacilla∣tion of opinion, which is incompatible with wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we term character.</P>
<P>Thus a Frenchman, like most women, may be said to have no character distinguishable from that of the nation; unless little shades, and casual lights, be allowed to constitute an essential characteristic. What then could have been ex∣pected, when their ambition was mostly confined to dancing gracefully, entering a room with easy assurance, and smiling on and complimenting the very persons whom they meant to ridicule at the next fashionable assembly? The learning to fence with skill it is true, was useful to a people, whose false notions of honour required that at least a drop of blood should atone for the shadow of an affront. The knack also of uttering sprightly repartees became a necessary art, to supply the place of that real interest only to be nourished in the affectionate intercourse of do∣mestic intimacy, where confidence enlarges the heart it opens. Besides, the desire of eating of every dish at table, no matter if there were fifty, and the custom of separating immediately after the repast, destroy the social affections, remind∣ing a stranger of the vulgar saying—'every man for himself, and God for us all.' After these cursory observations, it is not going too far to advance, that the French were in some respects the most unqualified of any people in Europe to undertake the important work in which they are embarked.</P>
<P>Whilst pleasure was the sole object of living among the higher orders of society, it was the
<PB N="372" REF="029916_0381_0FE30D6E1D99F8F0"/>
business of the lower to give life to their joys, and convenience to their luxury. This cast-like division, by destroying all strength of character in the former, and debasing the latter to ma∣chines, taught Frenchmen to be more ingenious in their contrivances for pleasure and show, than the men of any other country; whilst, with respect to the abridgment of labour in the me∣chanic arts, or to promote the comfort of com∣mon life, they were far behind. They had never, in fact, acquired an idea of that independent, comfortable situation, in which contentment is sought rather than happiness; because the slaves of pleasure or power can be roused only by lively emotions and extravagant hopes. Indeed they have no word in their vocabulary to express <HI>comfort</HI>—that state of existence, in which reason renders serene and useful the days, which pas∣sion would only cheat with flying dreams of happiness.</P>
<P>A change of character cannot be so sudden as some sanguine calculators expect: yet by the destruction of the rights of primogeniture, a greater degree of equality of property is sure to follow; and as Paris cannot maintain its splen∣dor, but by the trade of luxury, which can never be carried to the same height it was for∣merly, the opulent having strong motives to in∣duce them to live more in the country, they must acquire new inclinations and opinions.—As a change also of the system of education and domestic manners will be a natural consequence of the revolution, the French will insensibly rise to a dignity of character far above that of the present race; and then the fruit of their liberty,
<PB N="373" REF="029916_0382_0FE30D285174C000"/>
ripening gradually, will have a relish not to be expected during its crude and forced state.</P>
<P>The late arrangement of things seems to have been the common effect of an absolute govern∣ment, a domineering priesthood, and a great inequality of fortune; and whilst it completely destroyed the most important end of society, the comfort and independence of the people, it ge∣nerated the most shameful depravity and weak∣ness of intellect; so that we have seen the French engaged in a business the most sacred to man∣kind, giving by their enthusiasm, splendid ex∣amples of their fortitude at one moment, and at another, by their want of firmness and deficiency of judgment, affording the most glaring and fatal proofs of the just estimate, which all nations have formed of their character.</P>
<P>Men so thoroughly sophisticated, it was to be supposed would never conduct any business with steadiness and moderation: but it required a knowledge of the nation and their manners, to form a distinct idea of their disgusting conceit and wretched egotism; so far surpassing all the calculations of reason, that perhaps, should not a faithful picture be now sketched, posterity would be at a loss to account for their folly; and attribute to madness, what arose from imbecility.</P>
<P>The natural feelings of man seldom become so contaminated and debased as not sometimes to let escape a gleam of the generous fire, an ethereal spark of the soul; and it is these glow∣ing emotions, in the inmost recesses of the heart, which have continued to feed feelings, that on sudden occasions manifest themselves with all their pristine purity and vigour. But, by the
<PB N="374" REF="029916_0383_0FE30D7464AEBB58"/>
habitual slothfulness of rusty intellects, or the depravity of the heart, lulled into hardness on the lascivious couch of pleasure, those heavenly beams are obscured, and man appears either an hideous monster, a devouring beast; or a spirit∣less reptile, without dignity or humanity.</P>
<P>Those miserable wretches who crawl under the feet of others are seldom to be found among savages, where men accustomed to exercise and temperance are, in general, brave, hospitable, and magnanimous; and it is only as they sur∣render their rights, that they lose those noble qualities of the heart. The ferocity of the savage is of a distinct nature from that of the degene∣rate slaves of the tyrants. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> murders from mistaken notions of courage; yet he respects his enemy in proportion to his fortitude, and con∣tempt of death: the other assassinates without remorse, whilst his trembling nerves betray t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weakness of his affrigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed soul at every appear∣ance of danger. Among the former, men are respected according to their abilities; conse∣quently idle drones are driven out of this so∣ciety; but among the latter men are raised to honours and employments in proportion as a talent for intrigue, the sure proof of littleness of mind, has rendered them servile. The most melancholy reflections are produced by a retro∣spective glance over the rise and progress of the governments of different countries, when we are compelled to remark, that flagrant follies and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trocious crimes have been more common under the governments of modern Europe, than in any of the ancient nations, if we except the Jews. Sanguinary tortures, insidious poisonings, and
<PB N="375" REF="029916_0384_0FE30D29D3B13AB0"/>
dark assassinations, have alternately exhibited a race of monsters in human shape, the contem∣plation of whose ferocity chills the blood, and darkens every enlivening expectation of huma∣nity: but we ought to observe, to reanimate the hopes of benevolence, that the perpetration of these horrid deeds has arisen from a despotism in the government, which reason is teaching us to remedy. Sometimes, it is true, restrained by an iron police, the people appear peaceable, when they are only stunned; so that we find, when∣ever the mob has broken loose, the fury of the populace has been shocking and calamitous. These considerations account for the contradic∣tions in the French character, which must strike a stranger: for robberies are very rare in France, where, daily frauds and sly pilfering prove, that the lower class have as little honesty as sincerity. Besides, murder and cruelty almost always show the dastardly ferocity of fear in France; whilst in England, where the spirit of liberty has pre∣vailed, it is usual for an highwayman, demand∣ing your money, not only to avoid barbarity, but to behave with humanity, and even com∣plaisance.</P>
<P>Degeneracy of morals, with polished manners, produces the worst of passions, which floating through the social body, the genial current of natural feelings has been poisoned; and, com∣mitting crimes with trembling inquietude, the culprits have not only drawn on themselves the vengeance of the law, but thrown an odium on their nature, that has blackened the face of humanity. And whilst its temple has been sa∣crilegiously, profaned by the drops of bloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="376" REF="029916_0385_0FE30D75F71902D0"/>
which have issued from the very hearts of the sad victims of their folly; a hardness of temper, under the veil of sentiment, calling it vice, has prevented our sympathy from leading us to ex∣amine into the sources of the atrocity of our species, and obscured the true cause of disgraceful and vicious habits.</P>
<P>Since the existence of courts, whose aggran∣disement has been conspicuous in the same de∣gree as the miseries of the debased people have accumulated, the convenience and comfort of men have been sacrificed to the ostentatious dis∣play of pomp and ridiculous pageantry. For every order of men, from the beggar to the king, has tended to introduce that extravagance into society, which equally blasts domestic virtue and happiness. The prevailing custom of living be∣yond their income has had the most baneful effect on the independence of individuals of every class in England, as well as in France; so that whilst they have lived in habits of idleness, they have been drawn into excesses, which, proving ruinous, produced consequences equally perni∣cious to the community, and degrading to the private character. Extravagance forces the peer to prostitute his talents and influence for a place, to repair his broken fortune; and the country gentleman becomes venal in the senate, to enable himself to live on a par with him, or reimburse himself for the expences of electioneering, into which he was led by sheer vanity. The profes∣sions, on the same account, become equally un∣principled. The one, whose characteristic ought to be integrity, descends to chicanery; whilst another trisles with the health, of which it
<PB N="377" REF="029916_0386_0FE30D312763ADE0"/>
knows all the importance. The merchant like∣wise enters into speculations so closely bordering on fraudulency, that common straight forward minds can scarcely distinguish the devious art of selling any thing for a price far beyond that necessary to ensure a just profit, from sheerdis∣honesty, aggravated by hard-heartedness, when it is to take advantage of the necessities of the indigent.</P>
<P>The destructive influence of commerce, it is true, carried on by men who are eager by over∣grown riches to partake of the respect paid to nobility, is felt in a variety of ways. The most pernicious, perhaps, is it's producing an aristo∣cracy of wealth, which degrades mankind, by making them only exchange savageness for tame servility, instead of acquiring the urbanity of im∣proved reason. Commerce also, overstocking a country with people, obliges the majority to be∣come manufacturers rather than husbandmen; and then the division of labour, solely to enrich the proprietor, renders the mind entirely inactive. The time which, a celebrated writer says, is sauntered away, in going from one part of an em∣ployment to another, is the very time that pre∣serves the man from degenerating into a brute; for every one must have observed how much more intelligent are the blacksmiths, carpenters, and masons in the country, than the journeymen in great towns; and, respecting morals there is no making a comparison. The very gait of the man, who is his own master, is so much more steady than the slouching step of the servant of a fer∣vant, that it is unnecessary to ask which proves
<PB N="378" REF="029916_0387_0FE30C6221FE29E8"/>
by his actions he has the most independence of character.</P>
<P>The acquiring of a fortune is likewise the least arduous road to pre-eminence, and the most sure: thus are whole knots of men turned into machines, to enable a keen speculator to become wealthy; and every noble principle of nature is eradicated by making a man pass his life in stretching wire, pointing a pin, heading a nail, or spreading a sheet of paper on a plain surface. Besides, it is allowed, that all associations of men render them sensual, and consequently selfish; and whilst lazy friars are driven out of their cells as stagnate bodies that corrupt society, it may admit of a doubt whether large work-shops do not contain men equally tending to impede that gradual progress of improvement, which lead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the per∣fection of reason, and the establishment of rational equality.</P>
<P>The deprivation of natural, equal, civil and political rights, reduced the most cunning of the lower orders to practise fraud, and the rest to habits of stealing, audacious robberies, and mur∣ders. And why? because the rich and poor were separated into bands of tyrants and slaves, and the retaliation of slaves is always terrible. In short, every sacred feeling, moral and divine, has been obliterated, and the dignity of man sallied, by a system of policy and jurisprudence as repugnant to reason as at variance with hu∣manity.</P>
<P>The only excuse that can be made for the fero∣city of the Parisians is then simply to observe, that they had not any confidence in the laws,
<PB N="379" REF="029916_0388_0FE30C509BD04128"/>
which they had always found to be merely cob∣webs to catch small flies. Accustomed to be punished themselves for every trifle, and often for only being in the way of the rich, or their para∣sites; when, in fact, had the Parisians seen the execution of a noble, or priest, though convicted of crimes beyond the daring of vulgar minds?— When justice, or the law, is so partial, the day of retribution will come with the red sky of ven∣geance, to confound the innocent with the guilty. The mob were barbarous beyond the tiger's cruelty: for how could they trust a court that had so often deceived them, or expect to see it's agents punished, when the same measures were pursuing?</P>
<P>Let us cast our eyes over the history of man, and we shall scarcely find a page that is not tar∣nished by some foul deed, or bloody transaction. Let us examine the catalogue of the vices of men in a savage state, and contrast them with those of men civilized; we shall find, that a barbarian, considered as a moral being, is an angel, compared with the refined villain of artificial life. Let us investigate the causes which have produced this degeneracy, and we shall discover, that they are those unjust plans of governments, which have been formed by peculiar circumstances in every part of the globe.—Then let us coolly and impar∣tially contemplate the improvements, which are gaining ground in the formation of principles of policy; and I flatter myself it will be allowed by every humane and considerate being, that a po∣litical system more simple than has hitherto ex∣isted would effectually check those aspiring follies, which, by imitation, leading to vice, have banish∣ed
<PB N="380" REF="029916_0389_0FE30C8BED5404E8"/>
from governments the very shadow of justice and magnanimity</P>
<P>Thus had France grown up, and sickened on the corruption of a state diseased. But, as in medicine there is a species of complaint in the bowels which works it's own cure, and, leaving the body healthy, gives an invigorated tone to the system, so there is in politics; and whilst the agitation of it's regeneration continues, the ex∣crementitious humours exuding from the con∣taminated body will excite a general dislike and contempt for the nation; and it is only the phi∣losophical eye, which looks into the nature and weighs the consequences of human actions, that will be able to discern the cause, which has pro∣duced so many dreadful effects.</P>
