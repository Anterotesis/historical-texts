<P><HI>Thursday, October</HI> 30. Preached in the Morning to about 300 People, and observed a sweet Melting among them. Dined and rode six Miles to <HI>King's Bridge,</HI> where I preach∣ed from the Steps of a publick House to about 500; but did not perceive much visible Effect. Hither several of <HI>New-York</HI> Friends came to meet me. I talk'd with them on the Way of the Things of God, and found an inex∣pressible Satisfaction in my Soul when I arrived at the House of my very dear Friend Mr. <HI>Noble.</HI> After Supper, the Lord filled my Heart, and gave me to wrestle with him for <HI>New-York</HI> Inhabitants, and my own dear Friends. To add to my Comfort, the Lord brought my Dear Brother <HI>Davenport</HI> from <HI>Long-Island,</HI> by whose Hands the blessed Jesus has of late done <HI>great</HI> Things. In a Letter to his Mother he writes thus:
<Q>The Lord has, in infinite Mercy, given me, in my Parish, near twenty, in a little more than two Months Time. In almost all these the Work of Conversion seem'd very clear.</Q>
<HI>Let God have all the Praise. Even so, Lord Jesus, Amen &amp; Amen.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Friday, October</HI> 31. Met with a bitter Pamphlet wrote against me by some of the Presbyterian Persuasion, and found Freedom given me to answer it. I long since ex∣pected close Opposition from that Quarter. I believe it will be increasing daily. The Lord will make me more than Conqueror thro' his Love! Met also with two Vo∣lumes of Sermons published in <HI>London</HI> as delivered by me, tho' I never preach'd on most of the Texts. But <HI>Satan</HI> must try all Ways to bring the Work of God into Contempt. Blessed be God, who enables me abundantly to rejoice in all Things that befal me. Preached in the Morning at Mr <HI>P—n's</HI> Meeting-House: But never saw the Word of God fall with such Weight in <HI>New-York</HI> before. Two
<PB N="5" REF="004853_0004_100E02662FBA3F18"/>
or three cried out. Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> could scarce refrain himself. And, look where I would, many seem'd deeply wounded. At Night the Word was attended with great Power. One cried out; and the Lord enabled me, at the latter End of my Sermon, to speak with Authority. Alas! How vain are the Thoughts of Men! As I came along Yesterday, I found my Heart somewhat dejected, and told Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> I expected but little Movings in <HI>New York</HI>; but Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> bid me
"expect great Things from God,"
and likewise told me of several who were, as he hoped, savingly wrought upon by my Ministry, when there last. <HI>O Lord, let these Things humble my Soul for thy own Name's Sake</HI>!</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 1. Finished my Answer to the Pamphlet. God enabled me to write it in the Spirit of Meekness. <HI>O Lord give it thy Blessing</HI>! Preached twice as Yesterday to very crowded Auditories, and neither Time without Power. In the Evening Exercise, some fainted, and the Lord seemed to shew us more and more, that a Time for favouring <HI>New-York</HI> was near at Hand. <HI>O wherefore did I doubt! Lord increase my Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 2. Preached this Morning with Free∣dom and some Power, but was much dejected before the Evening Sermon. For near half an Hour before I left Mr. <HI>Noble</HI>'s House, I could only lie before the Lord and say,
<Q>I was a poor Sinner, and wonder that Christ would be gracious to such a Wretch.</Q>
As I went to Meeting, I grew weaker and weaker, and when I came into the Pulpit, I could have chose to be silent rather than speak. But, after I had begun, the Spirit of the Lord gave me Freedom, till at length it came down like a mighty rush∣ing Wind, and carried all before it. Immediately the whole Congregation was alarmed. Shricking, Crying, Weeping and Wailing were to be heard in every Corner. Men's Hearts falling them for Fear and many falling into the Arms of their Friends. My Soul was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I could scarce speak any more. A Sense <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="004853_0005_100E0267B5EA94F0"/>
overwhelmed me. As I went down, a Woman said,
"Come and see wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God has done for me To-night."
I looked, and her Daughter, in a great Agony, was cry∣ing out,
"Oh my Jesus, my Jesus!"
Another, a lit∣tle Boy, was so concerned on the Pulpit Stairs, that he could scarce stand. One of my Friends asked him why he cried,
<Q>Who can help it? said he. Mr. <HI>White∣field's</HI> Words cut me to the Heart.</Q>
After I came home, I threw myself upon the Bed, and in an awful Silence, admired the infinite Freeness, Sovereignty and Condescension of the Love of God. I was unwilling to move, but was called down to the Marriage of Mr. <HI>B—r,</HI> whom I met at <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> who being espoused to the young Woman, who was so struck at the same Place, by my Advice, married her this Night, and both are going as my Assistants to <HI>Georgia.</HI> Never did I see a more solemn Wedding. Jesus Christ was called, and he was present in a remarkable Manner. After Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> had mar∣ried them, I prayed. But my Soul, how was it enabled to wrestle with and lay hold on God! I was in a very great Agony, and the Holy Ghost was remarkably pre∣sent, that most, I believe, could say, <HI>Surely God is in this Place</HI>! After this, Divine Manifestations flowed in so fast, that my frail Tabernacle was scarce able to sustain them. My dear Friends sat round me on the Bed-sides. I pray∣ed for each of them alternately with strong Cries, and pierced by the Eye of Faith, even within the Veil. I continued in this Condition for about half an Hour, asto∣nished at my own Vileness, and the Excellency of Christ, then rose full of Peace, and Love and Joy. Oh! how am I obliged to my Enemies; God has remarkably re∣vealed himself to my Soul, ever since I have seen the Pam∣phlet published by the Presbyterians against me. O how faithful is he that promised, <HI>It shall bruise thy Heel, and thou shalt bruise his Head! Lord enable me to lay hold on this, during the Time of my sojourning here on Earth.</HI></P>

About seven we took Boat; reached <HI>Staten Island</HI> about ten, greatly refreshed in my inner Man. A dear Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Friend received us gladly. We solaced ourselves by singing and praying.

<P><HI>Tuesday, Nov.</HI> 4. Preached from a Waggon on <HI>Staten Island,</HI> to about 3 or 400 People. The Lord came amongst them. One dear young Man, in particular, as tho' his very Heart-strings would break, came to me after Ser∣mon, with strong Cryings and Tears, beseeching me,
<Q>to pray that he might be converted.</Q>
Many others wept also, and several of God's Children felt the Presence of the dear Lord Jesus in their Hearts. Many of them rejoiced to see me again. One grey headed Man came and told me how God had brought him from Darkness to Light, when I was here last. My Soul was also much refreshed with the Sight of dear Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cross.</HI> The former has lately lost his Wife, and tho' dear unto him, yet he was enabled with great Calmness to preach her funeral Sermon, whilst the Corps were lying before him. This put me in Mind of <HI>Melancthon,</HI> who, at the News of his Wife's Death, said,
<Q>By <HI>Kate,</HI> I'll come after thee ere it be long</Q>
Since his Wife's Decease, Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> has been in the <HI>West Jerseys</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> and told me how God remarkably work'd by his Ministry
<PB N="8" REF="004853_0007_100E026AE7BF7210"/>
in many Places. Mr. <HI>Cross</HI> also has seen great and won∣derful Things in his Congregations, so great that when I came to desire a particular Account, he said,
<Q>It directly answered the Account given by Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> of the Work of God in <HI>Northampton.</HI></Q>
<HI>What is the Lord Jesus about to do! If the Beginning is so great, what will the End of these Things be</HI>! Rode after Sermon to <HI>Newark,</HI> about ten Miles from <HI>Staten Island.</HI> Preached to a consi∣derable Congregation, but it being dark before I con∣cluded, I could not see what Impressions the Discourse made. I fear but little. However, at Night the Lord manifested forth his Glory. For coming down to Family Prayer, where I lodged, and perceiving many young Men around me, my Soul was, as it were melted down with Concern for them. After singing, I gave a Word of Exhortation. With what Power none can fully ex∣press but those that saw it. O how did the Word fall like a Hammer and like a Fire! What a Weeping was there! One poor Creature in particular was ready to sink into the Earth. His Countenance was altered, till he look'd, as it were, sick to Death. At length he said,
"What shall I do to be saved?"
Others were dissolved into Tears around him; and one of my Fellow-travellers was struck down, and so overpowered, that his Body be∣come exceeding weak. He could scarce move all the Night after. God, I believe, was now working power∣fully on his Soul. As for my own Part, I was almost spent. I vomited, threw myself upon the Bed, humbled myself before God, and spent the Remaining Evening in hear∣ing dear Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> give an Account of his late Ex∣cursion. Oh he is a choice humble Minister of the Gos∣pel! <HI>May I follow him as he does Christ. Ame and Amen.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wednesday, Nov.</HI> 5. Set out about eight in the Morning. Got to <HI>Baskinridge,</HI> the Place where Mr. <HI>Cross</HI> exercises
<PB N="9" REF="004853_0008_100E026D6FF14CD8"/>
his stated Ministry, about one o'Clock. At the House where I waited in the Way, a Woman spoke to me, un∣der strong Convictions, and told me,
<Q>she was deeply wounded by my last Night's Discourse</Q>
When I came to <HI>Baskinridge,</HI> I found Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> according to Appointment, had been preaching to the Congregation. It consisted of about 3000 People. As I went along I told a Friend,
<Q>My Soul wept for them, and I was perswaded within my self, that the Lord would in that Day make his Power to be known amongst them.</Q>
In Prayer, I perceived my Soul drawn out, and a stirring of Affection among the People. I had not discoursed long, but the Holy Ghost displayed his Power. In every Part of the Congregation, some Body or other began to cry out, and almost all melted into Tears. This abated for a few Moments, till a little Boy about seven or eight Years of Age cried out exceeding piteously indeed, and wept as tho' his little Heart would break. Mr. <HI>Cross</HI> having Compassion on him, took him up into the Wag∣gon, which so affected me that I broke from my Dis∣course, and told the People,
<Q>the little Boy should preach to them, and that God, since old Professors would not cry after Christ, had displayed his Sovereign∣ty, and out of an Infant's Mouth was perfecting Praise.</Q>
God so blessed <HI>this,</HI> that an universal Concern fell on the Congregation again. Fresh Persons dropp'd down here and there, and the Cry encreased more and more. At length I concluded, and as I was going away, I asked the little Boy "what he cried for?" He answered, "his Sins" I then asked, "What he wanted?" He answer'd, "Christ" As I passed along, fresh Instances of God's Power presented themselves to my View. Many mourning after Jesus that would not be comforted. After Sermon, Mr. <HI>Cross</HI> gave Notice of an Evening Lecture in his Barn about two Miles off Thither we went, and a great Multitude followed. Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> preach∣ed first, and that excellently well upon the Necessity
<PB N="10" REF="004853_0009_100E0270399E7D00"/>
and Benefit of spiritual Desertions. I then began to pray, and felt the Spirit of God working in me mightily. A great Commotion was soon observed among the Hearers, I then gave a Word of Exhortation. The Lord's Pre∣sence attended it in a surprizing Manner. One in about six Minutes cried out,
"He is come, he is come,"
and could scarce sustain the Discovery that Jesus Christ made of him∣self to his Soul. Others were so earnest for a Discovery of the Lord to their Souls, that their eager Crying obli∣ged me to stop, and I prayed over them as I saw their Agonies and Distress increase. At length we sung a Hymn, and then retired to the House where the Man that recei∣ved Christ continued till near Midnight, talking of and praising,
<HI>"his</HI> sweet <HI>Christ, his</HI> free hearted <HI>Christ,"</HI>
&amp;c. A gracious Woman, who had been wrestling with God for a Display of his Power, was so overcome with a Sense of his Goodness, that she almost swoon'd away. And at length, my own Soul was so full that I retired, and was in a strong Agony for some Time, and wept before the Lord, under a deep Sense of my own Vileness, and the Sovereign∣ty and Greatness of God's everlasting Love. Most of the People spent the Remainder of the Night in Prayer and Praises. Two or three young Ministers spoke alter∣nately, and others prayed as the Lord gave them Utte∣rance Oh! it was a Night much to be remember'd! <HI>May the Lord make us mindful of it even to the Day of our Death. Amen and Amen.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thursday, November</HI> 6 After Breakfast this Morning, at the Desire of Mr. <HI>Cross,</HI> I went and gave a Word of Ex∣hortation to, and sung and prayed with a few People in the Barn. There was a sweet Melting amongst them again, and the Lord was peculiarly present with us Be∣fore I mounted my Horse many came to me under great Soul-Concern. A L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d about thirteen Years old told me.
<PB N="11" REF="004853_0010_100E0271C5E13BD8"/>"He never felt Sin before Yesterday."
A poor Negro-Woman said, she was filled with a Love of Christ, and being too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of the Instrument, would fain have gone with me. Her Master a godly Man consented: But I bid her go Home, and with a thankful Heart serve her p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esent Master. When I was upon my Horse several Women came to shake me by the Hand. I asked one,
"whether she knew Christ?"
She said
"Yes" "How long?" "Three Years, said she, the third <HI>Sunday</HI> in next <HI>March.</HI>"
I asked another the same Question. She answered
<Q>Yes, but I am waiting for a fresh Breath∣ing from the blessed Spirit.</Q>
I, with Pleasure, took my Leave of them, and rode agreeably in Company with many Children of God, to <HI>New-Brunswick,</HI> 23 Miles from <HI>Baskinridge.</HI> Here Letters awaited me from <HI>Savannah,</HI> acquainting me that there had been a great Mortality a∣mongst the People of that Place. That my Family lived in Love, the Orphans continued very healthy, and that a Minister was coming over to supply my Place at <HI>Savannah.</HI> This last much rejoiced me, being resolved to give up <HI>Savannah</HI> Living as soon as I arrived at <HI>Georgia. A Parish and the Orphan-House together are too much for me. Besides God seems to shew me it is my Duty to evangelize, not to fix in any particular Place.</HI> In the Evening I preach'd in Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI>'s Meeting-House, and was led in my Discourse to comfort the Hearts of God's dear People. A little after Mr. <HI>B—r</HI> (a young Minister, who I trust, will hereafter come fairly out for God) preach'd for a∣bout an Hour, and then, at the Desire of dear Mr. <HI>Gil∣bert Tennent,</HI> I concluded with a Word of Exhortation, The Lord was plaesed to communicate himself to me free∣ly. My Soul was filled with his blessed Presence. The Word fell with Weight: And after Sermon in private Prayer with my dear Friends, oh how did my loving Saviour cause my Cop to overflow! He permitted me to talk with him as a Man talketh with his Friend. This I take to be that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Freedom of Speech which St. <HI>Paul</HI>

Set out immediately after Dinner, and was mercifully and very providentially preserved in going over two Creeks, which lay in the Way, and were much swell'd by the Rain. In one of them two of my Fellow-Travellers, in all Proba∣bility, must have perished, had not a Woman cried out, and bid us stop. A Man touched, as I afterwards found, by my Ministry, hearing my Voice, came and swam our Horses over the other Creek, and conducted us safe over a very narrow Bridge. About 8 we reached <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> tho' the Night was very dark indeed. Some Friends were just come in, who had been out another Way to meet me. Se∣veral with great Joy came to salute me.

<PB N="14" REF="004853_0013_100E027890985A20"/>
It was never preach'd in before. The Roof is not yet up, but the People raised a convenient Pulpit, and boarded the Bottom. The Joy of most of the Hearers, when they saw me, was inexpressible: Some still mocked. Between Services I received a Packet of Letters from <HI>England,</HI> dated in <HI>March</HI> last—<HI>May the Lord heal, and bring Good out of the Divisions, which, at present, seem to be among the Brethren there</HI>! — God giving me Freedom, and many Friends being in the Room, I kneeled down and prayed with and exhorted them all. But, Oh how did they melt under bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h! My Soul was much rejoiced to look round on them, because there were some who were now fairly brought through the Pangs of the New-Birth, who had been most marvellous Offenders against the great God. I shall mention two only. The first is one
<Q>Mr. <HI>Brockden,</HI> Recorder of Deeds, &amp;c. a Man eminent in his Profession, but for many Years a notori∣ous Deift. In his younger Day, he told me, he had some religious Impressions, but coming into Business, the Cares of the World so choaked the good Seed, that he not only forgat his God in some Degree, but at length began to doubt of, and to dispute his very Being. In this State he continued many Years, and has been very zealous to propagate his Deistical, I could almost say Atheistical Principles among moral Men, but he told me he never endeavoured to make Proselytes of vivious, debauched People. When I came to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> this Time Twelve month, he told me, he had not so much as a Curiosity to hear me But a Brother Deift, his choicest Friend, pressing him to come and hear me, to satisfy his Curiosity, he at length complyed with his Request. It was Night. I preach'd at the Court House Stairs, upon the Conference which our Lord had with <HI>Nicodemus.</HI> — I had not spoke much before God struck his Heart. For, said he, I saw your Doctrine tended to make People good. His Family knew nothing that he had been to hear me. After he came Home his
<PB N="15" REF="004853_0014_100E027A173066C0"/>
Wise, who had been at Sermon, came in also, and wished heartily that he had heard me. He said nothing. After this, another of his Family came in repeating the same Wish; and, if I mistake not, after that another, till at last being unable to refrain any longer, with Tears in his Eyes, Why, says he, I have been hearing him; and then expressed his Approbation. Ever since he has followed on to know the Lord, and I verily be∣lieve Jesus Christ has made himself manifest to his Soul. Tho' upwards of threescore Years old, he is now I believe born again of God. He is a little Child, and often (as he told me) receives such Communications from God, when he retires into the Woods, that he thinks he could die a Martyr for the Truth.</Q>
The next is one
<Q>CAPTAIN H—L, formerly as great a Reprobate as ever I heard of: Almost a Scandal and Reproach to human Nature. He used to swear to ease his Stomach, and was so fond of new Oaths that he used to go on Board the Transport Ships, and offer a Guinea for a new Oath, that he might have the Ho∣nour of coining it. It would be endless to give In∣stances of his vile Profaneness. To the Honour of God's Grace let it be said, he is now, I believe a Christian. Not only reformed, but renewed. The ef∣fectual Stroke, he told me, was given, when I preached last Spring at <HI>Pennypack,</HI> tho' under good Impressions before. Ever since he has been zealous for the Truth, stood like a Lamb when he was beaten, and in Danger of being murdered some Time ago, by many of my Opposers, and, in short, shews forth his Faith by his Works.</Q>
I might speak also of some Quakers, who are fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y brought into an experimental Acquaintance with Christ, who are chosen with myself, the aforesaid <HI>B—r</HI> and <HI>H—l,</HI> and some others, joint Trustees for the House lately erected.— But I mention these in Particular, because I think they are remarkable Proofs of that too much exploded Doct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, I mean, <HI>God's Eternal Election

<Q>Whatever Men's carnal Reasoning may suggest, yet if the Children of God fairly examine their own Experiences, if they do God Justice, they must acknowledge that they did not chuse God, but God chose them. And if he chose them at all, it must be from Eternity, and that too without any Regard to any Thing foreseen in them. Unless they acknow∣ledge this, Man's Salvation must be in Part owing to the Free-Will of Man, and it so, unless Men descend from other Parents then I did, Christ Jesus might have died, and never have seen the Travel of his Soul in the Salvation of one of his Creatures. But I would be tender in this Point, and leave Persons to be taught it of God. I am of the Martyr <HI>Bradford's</HI> Mind.</Q>
<HI>Let a Man go to the Grammar School of Faith and Repentance, before he goes to the University of Election and Predestination.</HI> A bare Head-Knowledge of the Form of sound Words availeth nothing.

<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 10. Preached Morning and After∣noon to very large Congregations, and observed a won∣derful sweet Power attend both, but especially the Even∣ing-Sermon. Many afterwards came and told me what God did for their Souls thereby. All the vacant Time before and after preaching, I was employed in answering my <HI>English</HI> Letters. <HI>Lord bless what was written to the Con∣solation and Edification of my dear Friends for Jesus Christ's Sake.</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Nov.</HI> 15 Preached twice every Day this Week in the new House, one Morning excepted, when I preached in Mr. <HI>C—</HI>'s Meeting House on Account of the Snow. A most sweet and wonderful Power went at that Time through the Congregation. The Lord gave me the Text I preached on just before Meeting; directed me to a Method as I was going up the Pulpi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stairs; and enabled me to discourse with an uncommon Clearness, Freedom, and Power. The Effects plainly shewed that
<PB N="17" REF="004853_0016_100E027E6F2916F0"/>
it was of God.— The Word seemed to smite them like so many pointed Arrows Many afterwards told me what they felt, and in the Evening I was sent for to a young Woman, who was carried Home from Meeting, and had continued almost speechless When I came, she look'd like a Person dead and laid out. I prayed with her, and heard afterwards that she came out into a more comforta∣ble State. — <HI>Blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> Indeed I cannot say we had one dry Meeting. The least Moving, I think, was one Afternoon, when I was unaccountably car∣ried out to talk against Reasoning Unbelievers. When I was at Dinner I had not fixed upon a Text. When I was going to preach, I was so ill that some of my Friends ad∣vised me to go home. I thought it best to trust to God. I went on, began Preaching, and found my Heart some∣what refreshed, but all on a sudden, my Soul was so carried out to talk against depending on our natural Rea∣son, that my Friends were astonished, and so was I too: For I felt the Holy Ghost come upon me at that Time, and never spake on that wise before. As I was going home, I said to a Friend,
<Q>Surely some Reasoners were in the Congregation.</Q>
Upon Enquiry, I found a Cluster of them were present, and then knew wherefore I was so assisted. <HI>Oh who would but trust in God</HI>! One of these Reasoners a little after, meeting Mr. <HI>B—n,</HI> said,
<Q>What! Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> could not make the People cry this After∣noon.</Q>
<Q>A good Reason for it, says Mr. <HI>B—n,</HI> he was preaching against Deists, and you know they are a harden'd Generation.</Q>
<HI>Lord take from them a Heart of Stone, and give them a Heart of Flesh. Abba, Father, all Things are possible with thee.</HI></P>
<P>Another Afternoon, there was such an universal Com∣motion in the Congregation, as I never saw in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> before. One or two cried out in a most pitious Manner, and Numbers wept so sorely, that I broke off Prayer after Sermon sooner than otherwise I should have done. The Children of God were melted down, and their Souls mag∣nified

the Lord. I preached on these Words, <HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> And as I afterwards found, was very providentially directed to that Subject. For one Mrs. <HI>P—r,</HI> as I have it in a Paper taken from her own Mouth, went to Mr. <HI>Cummings</HI> to know,
<Q>Why I should not preach in the Church?</Q>
He, after several Invectives cast out against me, said, <HI>He could not answer his Oath to the Bishop of</HI> London, <HI>if he did give me Leave,</HI> and caution'd her against going to hear me; adding, <HI>That if she followed or adhered to what I said, she was in a woful Condition.</HI> Nay, said he. <HI>You are damned if you do.</HI> With all, he told her, <HI>He was distressed in his Soul for her, because she was a good Liver, and brought up under pious Parents.</HI> Mrs. <HI>P—r</HI> asked,
<Q>If she, by God's Assistance, could live up to the Doctrine and Example of our Saviour and the Apostles, as laid down in the New Testament, she should not do well?</Q>
He answered,
"Yes"
<Q>Then, Sir, re∣plied she,
I must believe in Mr <HI>Whitefield's</HI> Doctrine.</Q>
<HI>There now,</HI> says he, <HI>you are running out again; I tell you, you are mad. Go home and hear him no more, and you'll do well enough.</HI> No, Sir, says Mrs <HI>P—r,</HI>
<Q>I cannot stay away. And seeing so many People admire Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI>'s Doctrine, and you so bitter against him. <HI>What must I do to be saved</HI>? For you are enough to distract me between you.</Q>
<HI>You are good enough,</HI> replied Mr. <HI>Cummins, and may dance or play at Cards, and be in a far better Way than</HI> Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efield <HI>or his Followers. For my Part, I will wash my Hands of your Blood, and will leave you.</HI> No, said Mrs. <HI>P—r,</HI>
<Q>You love Money too well, Sir, to leave this Place.</Q>
After a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat deal more Conversati∣on, Mrs <HI>P—r</HI> left him in great Dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of Mind, and often repeating to herse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, <HI>Lord, what shall I do to be saved</HI>? Contrary to Mr <HI>Cummins</HI>'s Advice, she went in the After∣noon, says the Paper before me, to hear Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and he pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>identially preached on the tremb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Jaylor's Words, <HI>What shall I do to be saved</HI>?

that Text explained, is much strengthened, perfectly easy, and will by God's Grace follow his Commandments. <HI>Lord, for thy Mercy's Sake, work in her both to will and to do, after thy good Pleasure. Amen and Amen</HI> It would be almost endless to recount all the particular Instances of God's Grace, which I have seen this Week past. Many that before were only convicted, now plainly proved, that they were converted and had a clear Evidence of it with∣in themselves.

Notwithstanding many were convicted almost every Day, and came unto me under the greatest Distress and Anguish of Soul.

Hasten that Time, O Lord, my Strength and my Redeemer.</HI> I cannot leave off giving an Account of this Week's Work, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout mentioning an∣other Instance or two of God's Grace. One Woman came to me, I think fairly converted to our dear Lord Jesus. She told me, when I was at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> last,
<Q>She came desiring that I would baptize her Child. I being other∣wise engaged, refused. Upon this the Devil assaulted her, being under strong Convictions, in a most violent Manner, and endeavoured to persuade her, that all I had told her were Lies She was cast into Darkness, but reasoned thus, It is impossible that it should be Lies, or that I should be a false Prophet, since the Word came with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch Light, Evidence and unspeakable Power upon her Soul, when she heard me. She went home, re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red to Bed, and there the Devil would fain have persuaded her to cut the Child's Throat wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a Pair of Sciss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.

it did not rise to such a Degree as when I preached la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spring. I was taken ill after Preaching. Straining caus∣ed me to vomit much. I rode about twelve Miles, was kindly received into a House with all my Friends, and thought it advisable to retire to Bed immediately. But on a sudden, God's Presence so filled my Soul that I could scarce stand under it. I prayed and exhorted, then exhorted and prayed again, but with such Power that e∣very Person in the Room seemed to be under very great Impressions, sighing and weeping from the very Bottom of their Souls, and one in particular roared for the very Disquietness of her Heart. This continued for near an Hour or two; but at last my outward Man was so weak, and my inward Communications so strong, that I was quite overpowered. A dear Friend undressed me. The Lord gave me sweet Sleep, and in the Morning I arose with my natural Strength much renewed. <HI>Blessed be the Lord my God, from whom alone cometh every temporal Gift, as well as my eternal Salvation</HI>!</P>

<P><HI>Sunday, Nov.</HI> 23. Rode four Miles, and got to <HI>Not∣tingham</HI> about ten. But it raining much, and the People thereby being prevented gathering so soon, I preached about one to a large Congregation, who seem'd in no wise to regard the Rain, so they might be watered with the Dew of God's Blessing. The Lord, I believe, lets the Doctrine distill like the Dew upon them Immediately after Sermon, we set out in a very great Company for <HI>Bo∣hemia</HI> in <HI>Maryland,</HI> near thirty Miles from <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and to my pleasing Surprize, as we were riding along, met with Captain <HI>G—n,</HI> whom I sent over with Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> to <HI>England.</HI> He arriv'd at <HI>Newcastle</HI> in the Morn∣ing, and very providentially came to me in the Afternoon.

Dear Captain <HI>H — l, Matthew</HI>-like, was wery busy in bringing his Brother Publican Sailors to hear the glad Tidings or Salvation, and he rejoyced my Heart with the News that some of them felt the Power of God.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNder written are the dying Words of your <HI>Aunt,</HI> which I send for your Satisfaction and Information. She died <HI>October</HI> 7th between the Hours of nine and ten in the Morning, being fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led with the <HI>full Assurance of</HI> Faith <HI>in Christ,</HI> and a joyful Hope of eternal Salvation through his <HI>Merits</HI> and Mediation.</P>
<P>As your Aunt and I were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aying to our Lord Jesus to give her the Comforts of his Holy Spirit to support her under the Agonies of Death, she replied, <HI>I see him! I see him! Now I see Light</HI> After this she continued in Prayer about half an Hour, but her Speech failing her, we could not during that Time understand what she spake, only we could bear the Name of Jesus often and <HI>Come Jesus! Come Jesus.</HI> Then again she spake out plainly, and said <HI>Who would die without a God? Now I see Light. God has let me see my Error. I had not repented
<PB N="32" REF="004853_0031_100E029E4BFF3290"/>
of my original Sin. Oh the Falseness of our Hearts! O search your Hearts, before you come to this; for they are false.</HI> Then she lay in an Agony about half an Hour, and a∣gain spake out, and said, <HI>God has let me see great and glo∣rious Things which would not be believed, if they were told.</HI> Then your Uncle <HI>R—s,</HI> coming into the Room spake to your Aunt <HI>S—s,</HI> and your <HI>dying</HI> Aunt hearing his Voice, calleth him to her, and when he was come, she spake to us and said, <HI>Mind what I say to you; for hereafter you must all give an Account of what I now say to you; for I speak by the Spirit of God.

Brother, tell Mr. — he is in the Wrong.</HI> Then she said <HI>My Pain is great, but Christ is suf∣ficient for me.</HI> And she repeated that <HI>God had let her see great Things that would not be believed, if they were told.</HI> She said also, <HI>Follow</HI> Whitefield, <HI>God will bless him wherever he goes.</HI> — Don't speak lightly of him. Bless him, bless him. God has enabled me to speak to you before I go. I am just a going. Farewell, Farewell. God be with you! Then she composed herself, and lay about half an Hour, and neither mov'd nor groan'd, except her Lips and Tongue, and the heaving of her Breast in breathing, seeming to be in her per∣fect Senses till about a Minute before she died — She look'd round at each of us that were about her Bed, and then departed in Quietness. Her Hands and Arms, up to her Elbows, were cold, and also her Face, when she spake what is here inserted, and some Time before. As she lay begging that the Lord would take her away, I felt her <HI>Nose</HI> and told her, <HI>it</HI> was cold; and she re∣plied, <HI>Blessed be God for it,</HI> and again, <HI>My Soul thirsteth after thee,</HI> I come, Lord Jesus.

<P><HI>Thursday, Jan.</HI> 15 Received several comfortable Let∣ters from my dear Friends at <HI>Boston</HI>; amongst whom Se∣cretary <HI>Willard,</HI> an honourable Counsellor, writes thus:
<Q>Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> tells me, that divers young Men in this Town, who are Candidates for the Ministry, have been brought under <HI>deep</HI> Convictions by your Preaching, and (as he hopes) are carried off from the Foundation of their false Hopes (their own Righteousness) to rest only upon Christ for Salvation.</Q>
The dear Reverend Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> writes thus:
<Q>I can inform you, that there are many abiding Proofs that you did not <HI>run</HI> in vain, and labour in vain amongst us in this Place. I could much more than fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l this Paper with the Accounts I have re∣ceived from the Persons who have been impressed un∣der the <HI>Word</HI> preached by you.

<PB N="36" REF="004853_0035_100E02A7410EFF00"/>
<HI>Others,</HI> who had been under religious Impressions, are now more earnestly pressing into the Kingdom of Hea∣ven, and many of the Children of God stirred up to <HI>give Diligence</HI> for the <HI>full Assurance of Faith.</HI> There is a greater Flocking to all the <HI>Lectures</HI> in the Town, and the People shew such a Disposition to the new <HI>Tuesday</HI> Evening <HI>Lecture,</HI> that our large capacious House cannot receive <HI>all</HI> that come. I am sure your Visit to <HI>us</HI> has made a large Addition to the Prayers that are going up for you in one Place and another, and I hope also the Jewels which are to make up your Crown in the <HI>Day</HI> of the Lord.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Welch,</HI> a pious Friend, writes thus:
<Q>I fear I am tedious, but I can't break off till I just men∣tion, to the Glory of the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, and for your Comfort and Encouragement, the Success your Ministry of late has had among <HI>us.</HI> Impressions made seem to be <HI>abiding</HI> on the Minds of many. The <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> seem to be more the Topick of Conversation than ever I knew them. Nay, Religious Conversation seems to be almost <HI>fashionable,</HI> and almost <HI>every one</HI> seems dis∣posed to speak or hear of the <HI>Things</HI> of God. Mul∣titudes flock to the Evening <HI>Lecture,</HI> tho' it has some∣times been the worst of Weather. Ministers seem to preach with more <HI>Life,</HI> and the <HI>great</HI> Auditories seem to hear with <HI>solemn</HI> Attention; and, I hope, our Lord Jesus is getting to himself the Victory over the Hearts of many Sinners.</Q>
Others write to the same Effect.

<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 18. Continued on board these two Days to settle our <HI>Ship</HI> Affairs, and dispatch some other Busi∣ness. Was but weak in Body. The Winds being con∣trary, many Friends came from <HI>Charlestown,</HI> and we spent the Afternoon very comfortably together. I preached, and the Lord was with me. Towards the Evening our Friends left us, not without Hopes of seeing each other hereafter in the Land of everlasting Rest, if not on this Side Eternity. <HI>Blessed be God, that there is such a Rest re∣maining for his Peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>!</P>
<P>Sailed over <HI>Charlestown</HI> Bar, <HI>Jan.</HI> 24. and arrived at <HI>Falmouth</HI> on the 11th of <HI>March.</HI> The Lord was pleased to give us a favourable Passage. About three Days after we set sail, we had a violent Storm, which continued about four Hours. During the rest of the Passage, we had uncommonly pleasant Weather and fair Winds, till we came very near upon Soundings. Afterwards, the blessed God was pleased to detain us near a fortnight. But the Weather was pleasant, and through the Bounty of our dear <HI>Charlestown</HI> Friends, we had all Things richly to enjoy. In the Beginning of the Voyage, my Body was

weak, and my Soul somewhat low. But afterwards, God was pleased to strengthen me both in Body &amp; Soul. These Words came one Day with great Power upon my Heart, <HI>Arise, Go into Nineveh, the great City, and preach unto it the Preaching that I bid thee.</HI> At another Time, the Lord spoke to me by these Words, <HI>Take the Foxes, the little Foxes that spoil the Vines: For our Vine have tender Grapes.</HI> This Part of <HI>Joseph's</HI> Blessing was one Night brought home to me with a sweet Power: <HI>The Archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him. But his Bow abode in Strength, and the Arms of his Hands were made-strong, by the Hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</HI> And, at another Time, when my Soul was dejected at a Sense of my own Weaknesses, and the Number and Greatness of my im∣pending Trials, the Lord raised and comforted me with this Promise: <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: Be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the Right Hand of my Righteousness.</HI> The Books of <HI>Genesis</HI> and <HI>Exodus,</HI> which I expounded in Course, Morning and Evening, were much blessed to my spiritual Comfort. And the Lord has been pleased to give me Freedom to write down some of my extempore Discourses, which I hope he will bless for his own Name's Sake. In short, this Voyage has been a pro∣fitable Voyage to my Soul, because of my having had many sweet Opportunities for Reading, Meditation and Prayer. I cannot but adore the Providence of God in savouring me with such blessed Retirements as I have frequently enjoyed on the great Waters. I dared not expect to meet with such Success as he has been pleased to give me abroad: And I doubt not but I shall yet see greater Things there as well as at home. I never had such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Variety of Trials and Changes of Life lying be∣fore me as at this Time. But I throw myself into the Hands of the blessed Jesus, and shall conclude this fur∣ther Account of God's Dealing with me, with a H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mn composed by my dear and honoured Friend Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI></P>

<L>Ah! my dear Master! Can it be</L>
<L>That I should lose by serving thee?</L>
<L>In seeking Souls should lose my own,</L>
<L>And others save, myself undone?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<L>Yet I am lost (shouldst thou depart)</L>
<L>Betray'd by this deceitful Heart,</L>
<L>Destroy'd if thou my Labour bless,</L>
<L>And ruined by my own Success.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<L>Hide me! if thou refuse to hide,</L>
<L>I fall a Sacrifice to Pride:</L>
<L>I cannot shun the Fowler's Snare,</L>
<L>The Fiery Test I cannot bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<L>Helpless, to thee for Aid I cry,</L>
<L>Unable to resist, or fly:</L>
<L>I must not, Lord the Task decline,</L>
<L>For all I have, and am is thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<L>And well thou know'st, I did not seek,</L>
<L>U call'd of God, for God to speak,</L>
<L>The dreadful Charge I sought to flee,</L>
<L>"Send whom thou wilt, but send not me."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<L>Long did my Coward Flesh delay,</L>
<L>And still I tremble to obey,</L>
<L>Thy Will be done, I faintly cry,</L>
<L>But rather— suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r me to die.</L>

<L>Ah! rescue me from Earth and Sin,</L>
<L>Fightings without, and Fears within,</L>

<L>And not my helpless Soul defend,</L>
<L>Call me to stand in Danger's Hour,</L>
<L>And not support me with thy Power.</L>

<LG N="9">
<L>Lord, I believe the Promise true,</L>
<L><HI>Behold, I always am with you;</HI></L>
<L>Always if thou with me remain,</L>
<L>Hell, Earth, and Sin shall rage in vain.</L>

<L>Give me Thine All-sufficient Grace,</L>
<L>Then hurl your Dares of Rage or Praise,</L>
