<L>CELESTIAL Muse! assist me while I sing,</L>
<L>In paths forbid, what woes unnumber'd spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To shun a noisy court, and noon-tide heat,</L>
<L>And all the cares that 'tend upon the great,</L>
<L>The King walk'd forth, to breathe the balmy air,</L>
<L>And view the beauties of the gay <HI>parterre.</HI></L>
<L>The palace-garden, made for careless ease,</L>
<L>Was stor'd with all that could the fancy please;—</L>
<L>The stately trees, in lofty arches, rise,</L>
<L>Wave their green heads, and gently fan the skies;</L>
<L>A humbler sort, with blossoms sprinkled o'er,</L>
<L>In order rang'd, stand round the royal bow'r:</L>
<L>Here joyful birds, in sweet harmonious notes,</L>
<L>To hail their monarch, tune their little throats:</L>
<L>Near the delicious spot, smooth roll'd a flood,</L>
<L>In which the various trees reflected stood;</L>
<L>The golden Orange, 'midst the smiling green,</L>
<L>Inverted in the shining mirrour's seen.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="023710_0003_0FC0AE95F1B7CC68"/>Here, while the trees their ripen'd fruit display,</L>
<L>Or sweetly smile with purple blossoms gay,</L>
<L>The mantling vine holds forth her luscious grape,</L>
<L>That not a beauty may the eye escape.</L>
<L>Ten thousand lovely flow'rs, of various dye,</L>
<L>In regular confusion meet the eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HERE <HI>Israel's</HI> King enjoy'd the balmy breeze,</L>
<L>By <HI>Zephyr</HI> wafted thro' the charming trees.</L>
<L>Fair <HI>Bathsheba,</HI> with all her blooming charms,</L>
<L>Had just withdrawn her from the Monarch's arms;</L>
<L>When <HI>Nathan</HI> found, beneath the cooling shade,</L>
<L>Stretch'd at his ease, the Royal Shepherd laid.</L>
<L>"Forever live, O King!"—thus spake the Seer—</L>
<L>The Monarch rose, with reverence, to hear</L>
<L>High Heav'n's Ambassadour—who thus began:</L>
<L>"Justice, my Lord the King, 'twixt man and man;</L>
<L>Within the city-walls two men were known—</L>
<L>One, poor indeed—the other, overgrown</L>
<L>In wealth and pow'r; his flocks, unnumber'd, rove</L>
<L>O'er all the plain, and whiten ev'ry grove:</L>
<L>The poor man nurs'd, each day, with care and cost,</L>
<L>One little lamb—'twas all that he could boast;</L>
<L>With him it fed, and with his children grew,</L>
<L>And in his bosom lay the darling ewe.</L>
<L>The rich have many friends—a friend arrives</L>
<L>To visit him who in gay affluence lives:</L>
<L><HI>Pride</HI> now would furnish out a sumptuous feast;</L>
<L>But <HI>Av'rice</HI> fears to entertain the guest;—</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="023710_0004_0FC0AE972C5E2F50"/>A sudden thought the miser fill'd with glee.—</L>
<L>'Twas oft his hap his neighbour's lamb to see;</L>
<L>When walking forth, he mark'd its snowy hue,</L>
<L>And with its beauty quite enamour'd grew:</L>
<L>He seiz'd the destin'd prey, nor heeds its cries,</L>
<L>Nor felt the woe that from the deed might rise."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Prophet ceas'd:—enrag'd, the Monarch stands:</L>
<L>"Who? Where is he?" he sternly then demands;</L>
<L>Anger, like lightning, flashes from his eye:</L>
<L>"As God doth live, the man shall surely die!"</L>
<L><HI>Thou art the man,</HI> scarce had the Prophet said,</L>
<L>When all the outward marks of inward dread</L>
<L>Appear'd in view—a chilly frost bedews</L>
<L>The Monarch's face, and speaks his recent woes:</L>
<L><HI>Thou art the man,</HI> like an envenom'd dart,</L>
<L>Rankles within, and tears the bleeding heart:</L>
<L><HI>Thou art the man,</HI> still vibrates on the ear,</L>
<L>And half forbids it other words to hear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE man of God continues to unfold</L>
<L>High Heav'n's behest, and thus the message told:—</L>
<L>"Thus saith the Lord—I rais'd thee to the throne,</L>
<L>And on thy head have plac'd thy master's crown;</L>
<L>His num'rous wives, his houses, and his land,</L>
<L>To thee I gave—what more couldst thou demand?</L>
<L>Or if thou hadst a wish that ask'd for more,</L>
<L>My hand was able to increase the store.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="023710_0005_0FC0AE98C4FC5E00"/>Why hast thou then, with Ammon's sword, hewn down
<HI>Uriah,</HI> chief supporter of thy crown?</L>
<L>Why, tyrant-like, have you thus sought his life,</L>
<L>And from his bosom torn his beauteous wife?</L>
<L>Thou, <HI>Israel's</HI> Shepherd, (this was once my boast)</L>
<L>Ill fares the flock that have their leader lost.</L>
<L>How, from the fold, was thou the first to stray,</L>
<L>'Till even Innocence became thy prey?</L>
<L>Hell heard, with pleasure, the detested deed;</L>
<L>And <HI>Belial's</HI> wanton sons, supinely laid</L>
<L>Within his groves, with harlots now blaspheme,</L>
<L>Mock <HI>Israel's</HI> King, and curse Jehovah's name."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FORLORN, appall'd, the Royal mourner stood:</L>
<L><HI>Ive sinn'd against the Lord</HI>—nor more he cou'd:</L>
<L>A sigh escap'd the heart—on Angels' wings</L>
<L>Alost was borne, and reach'd the KING of Kings;</L>
<L>With incense touch'd, it lay before the throne,</L>
<L>Spoke his remorse, and made his sorrows known.</L>
<L>"Thy sin is blotted out—thou shalt not die;</L>
<L>Heav'n sees thy grief—has heard thy inward cry:</L>
<L>Yet, lest GOD's foes his justice should arraign,</L>
<L>Thy first-born son shall be untimely slain;—</L>
<L>Scarce shall his infant eyes behold the light,</L>
<L>Ere they shall close in everlasting night:</L>
<L>While greater troubles in thy house shall rise,</L>
<L>To break thy peace, and damp thy future joys."</L>

<L>DEATH's Angel now, commission'd by the Lord,</L>
<L>O'er the fond infant holds the fatal sword;</L>
<L>From the dread sight the frantick father turns,</L>
<L>And, clad in sackcloth, in his chamber mourns;</L>
<L>The Monitor, within the Royal breast,</L>
<L>That long had slept, now rous'd at length from rest,</L>
<L>Holds forth a mirrour to the aching sight,</L>
<L>Seizes the mind that fain would take its flight—</L>
<L>Bids it look in:—and first, <HI>Uriah</HI> stood,</L>
<L>Arm'd for the sight, as yet unstain'd with blood;</L>
<L>Courage and care were on his brow combin'd,</L>
<L>To show the hero and the patriot join'd:—:</L>
<L>Next, pale and lifeless, on his warlike shield,</L>
<L>The soldiers bore him from the bloody field.</L>
<L>"And is it thus? (the Royal mourner said)</L>
<L>And has my hand perform'd the dreadful deed?</L>
<L>Was I the wretch that gave thee to the soe,</L>
<L>And bade thee sink beneath th' impending blow?</L>
<L>Bade every friend and hero leave thy side?—</L>
<L>Open, O earth! and in thy bosom hide</L>
<L>A guilty wretch who wishes not to live;</L>
<L>Who cannot, dares not, ask for a reprieve;</L>
<L>So black a crime just Heav'n will not forgive!</L>
<L>Justice arrests thy coming mercy, Lord—</L>
<L>Strike then, O strike, unsheath thy dreadful sword:</L>
<L>Accurs'd forever be the hated day,</L>
<L>That led my soul from innocence astray;—</L>

<L>Darkness and sorrows jointly hold their reign,</L>
<L>When time, revolving, brings it round again.</L>
<L>Ye injur'd ghosts, break from the silent tomb,</L>
<L>In all the fearful pomp of horrour come,</L>
<L>Breathe out your woes, and hail the dreadful gloom.</L>
<L>Why does not injur'd <HI>Israel</HI> now arise,</L>
<L>Proclaim my madness to th' avenging skies,</L>
<L>Hurl quick the sceptre from my bloody hand,</L>
<L>While marks of infamy my forehead brand?</L>
<L>No time shall e'er the dreadful act conceal—</L>
<L>No tongue shall fail its horrours to reveal—</L>
<L>Eternity, upon its strongest wing,</L>
<L>Shall bear the deed whence all my sorrows spring.</L>
<L>Unhappy man!—ah! whither shall I turn?</L>
<L>Like <HI>Cain,</HI> accurst, must I forever mourn?</L>
<L>On beds of silk in vain I seek repose—</L>
<L><HI>Uriah's</HI> shade forbids my eyes to close;</L>
<L>No bars exclude him—to no place confin'd,</L>
<L>Eager he still pursues my flying mind:</L>
<L>Not all the crowd that bow at my approach,</L>
<L>Nor guards that thicken round the gilded coach.</L>
<L>Can with their arms, or martial air, affright.</L>
<L>Or drive the phantom from my wearied sight.</L>
<L>Whene'er I view the diamond's varied rays,</L>
<L>That grace my robes, or on my sceptre blaze,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="023710_0008_0FC0AEA9303F7890"/><HI>Uriah</HI> still, reflected from the stone,</L>

<L>Cou'd all the gold that lies on <HI>India's</HI> coast,</L>
<L>Cou'd all the gems its num'rous quarries boast,</L>
<L>Bribe peace a moment to this aching heart,</L>
<L>How freely with the glitt'ring store I'd part.</L>
<L>Black, heavy thoughts, ah! what a num'rous train!</L>
<L>I feel your stings unpitied, yet complain.</L>
<L>Thou gallant hero, say, where art thou now?</L>
<L>Gone, gone forever! sunk beneath my blow!—</L>
<L>Of my uplifted arm, my dire command,</L>
<L>Fell Ammon's sword was wielded by my hand!</L>
<L>Where the fierce battle glow'd with hottest rage,</L>
<L>Where all the mighty, arm to arm engage,</L>
<L>Where frightful death his various forms put on,</L>
<L>You met the terrour of his dreadful frown.—</L>
<L>As some huge tree, whose tow'ring threats the sky,</L>
<L>While deep in earth its roots embosom'd lie,</L>
<L>Mocks at the warring winds, and proudly dares</L>
<L>The tempest's force, nor once destruction fears:</L>
<L>So, unappall'd, the glorious Leader stood,</L>
<L>Tho torn with wounds, and cover'd o'er with blood;</L>
<L>O'er hills of slaughter'd foes he makes his way—</L>
<L>His sword, from Ammon, gain'd the doubtful day:</L>
<L>Yet, while alost the <HI>Hebrew</HI> standard flies,</L>
<L>And vict'ry shouts to echoing earth and skies,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="023710_0009_0FC0AEB694FFC738"/>The lifeless hero, stretch'd upon the shield,</L>
<L>With countless wounds, is borne from off the field.</L>
<L>Once, how he shone amidst the gazing throng,</L>
<L>Who prais'd his courage as he pass'd along!</L>
<L>On thy firm brow, what beaming splendour shone!</L>
<L>By thy bold arm, how strengthen'd was my throne!</L>
<L>And shall thy murd'rer crown thy head with bays,</L>
<L>And dare thy God-like virtues thus to praise?</L>
<L>From cruel fate, ah! whither shall I run?—</L>
<L>Capricious lust!—thou hast my soul undone!</L>
<L>Drawn on by impious passion, I pursu'd.</L>
<L>The flying fair, and oft my suit renew'd;</L>
<L>The humble suppliant, and the haughty lord,</L>
<L>By turns put on, no ray of hope afford;—</L>
<L>She heard at length, but with an obdurate ear—</L>
<L>And still <HI>Uriah</HI> draws the pitying tear.</L>
<L>O happy day! when, blest with <HI>Eglah's</HI> charms,</L>
<L>I woo'd no other beauty to my arms;</L>
<L>No court's licentious joys did then molest</L>
<L>My peaceful mind, nor haunt my tranquil breast.</L>
<L>A glitt'ring crown! thou poor, fantastick thing!</L>
<L>What solid satisfaction canst thou bring?—</L>
<L>Once, far remov'd from all the toils of state,</L>
<L>In groves I slept—no guards around me wait:</L>
<L>Oh! how delicious was the calm retreat!—</L>
<L>Sweet groves! with birds &amp; various flowers stor'd,</L>
<L>Where nature furnish'd out my frugal board;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="023710_0010_0FC0AEBD99E33A50"/>The pure, unstained spring, my thirst allay'd;</L>
<L>No poison'd draughts, in golden cups convey'd,</L>
<L>Was there to dread.—Return, ye happy hours,</L>
<L>Ye verdant shades, kind nature's pleasing bow'rs—</L>
<L>Inglorious solitude, again return,</L>
<L>And heal the breast with pain and anguish torn.</L>
<L>Oh! sweet content! unknown to pomp and kings,</L>
<L>The humble rest beneath thy downy wings;</L>
<L>The lowly cottage is thy lov'd retreat—</L>
<L>In vain, you're courted by the rich and great—</L>
<L>In vain, the miser seeks thee in his gold—</L>
<L>In vain, each day the glitt'ring store is told;</L>
<L>Thou art not there: in vain th' ambitious sigh,</L>
<L>And seek the joys that still before them fly:</L>
<L>The merchant's ship all treasures brings but thee—</L>
<L>You from his anxious bosom ever flee:</L>
<L>For thee, the sailor tempts the boist'rous main,</L>
<L>And hopes to find thee in his dear-bought gain:</L>
<L>For thee, the hero mounts his iron car,</L>
<L>And hopes to find thee when return'd from war.</L>
<L>Their hopes are vain.—Who wish with thee to dwell,</L>
<L>Must seek the rural shade, or lonely cell:</L>
<L>The Gods themselves delight in verdant groves,</L>
<L>And shield from harm the innocence they love.—</L>
<L>Witness, the day, my youthful arm withstood</L>
<L>The foaming bear:—the monarch of the wood,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="023710_0011_0FC0AEBED3494D38"/>With open jaws appear'd, and crested mien,</L>
<L>But in a moment by my hand was slain:</L>
<L>Safe from their teeth I snatch'd the destin'd prey,</L>
<L>And bore it harmless in my arms away.—</L>
<L>Witness, the day, <HI>Gath's</HI> lordly champion came,</L>
<L>With haughty strides, and curs'd Jehovah's name;</L>
<L>Tho in my hand nor sword nor spear were found,</L>
<L>This vast unwieldy bulk lay stretch'd upon the ground.</L>
<L>Belov'd by Heav'n, nought had I then to fear—</L>
<L>Twice I escap'd from <HI>Saul's</HI> emitted spear,</L>
<L>By malice thrown; and, free from danger, stand,</L>
<L>Hid in the hollow of th' Almighty's hand;—</L>
<L>His darling then I was; who, mighty GOD!</L>
<L>Sink now beneath the terrours of thy rod.</L>
<L>Dispel those thick, dark clouds, this boist'rous wind,</L>
<L>That tears the soul, and harrows up the mind;</L>
<L>Oh! let thy mercy, like the solar ray,</L>
<L>Break forth and drive these dismal clouds away;</L>
<L>Oh! send its kind enliv'ning warmth on one,</L>
<L>Who sinks, who dies, beneath thy dreadful frown:</L>
<L>Thus fares the wretch at sea, by tempests tost—</L>
<L>Sands, hurricanes, and rocks, proclaim him lost;</L>
<L>With eager eyes he views the peaceful shore,</L>
<L>And longs to rest where billows cease to roar:—</L>
<L>Of wanton winds and waves I've been the sport—</L>
<L>Oh! when shall I attain the wish'd for port?</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="023710_0012_0FC0AEC04F381E40"/>Or might I bear the punishment alone,</L>
<L>Nor hear the lovely infant's piteous moan;—</L>
<L>My sins upon the dying child impress'd,</L>
<L>The dreadful thought forbids my soul to rest.</L>
<L>In mercy, LORD, thy humble suppliant hear—</L>
<L>Oh! give the darling to my ardent prayer!—</L>
<L>Cleanse me from sin—oh! graciously forgive—</L>
<L>Blest with thy love, oh! let thy servant live:</L>

<HEAD><HI>DAVID's</HI> LAMENTATION OVER <HI>SAUL</HI> AND <HI>JONATHAN.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW are the mighty fall'n! <HI>Gilboa,</HI> boast</L>
<L><HI>Saul,</HI> and his son, upon thy summit lost!—</L>
<L>Thy face is sprinkle'd with the blood of war—</L>
<L>Thy bosom surrow'd with the iron car—</L>
<L>Accurst remain, from this dark, gloomy hour,</L>
<L>Nor know henceforth one cool, refreshing show'r:</L>
<L>Ye humid clouds, by Ocean's bounty fed,</L>
<L>Your kindly moisture here forbear to shed:</L>
<L>No ripen'd fruit nor herbage mayst thou know,</L>
<L>Nor flocks or herds e'er grace thy desart brow;</L>
<L>Nor fragrant incense from thy top arise,</L>
<L>In curling waves, to greet th' offended skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DISTAIN'D with blood, here lay the royal shield—</L>
<L>Here lay the sword <HI>Saul's</HI> mighty arm did wield.</L>
<L>Oh <HI>Jonathan!</HI> for thee I am distress'd—</L>
<L>My friend, my brother!—speak, my tears, the rest.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="023710_0017_0FC0AEDBCB011BB0"/>Ye <HI>Hebrew</HI> dames, will ye forbear to join</L>
<L>My song of woe, nor mingle tears with mine?</L>
<L>The gen'rous Prince, whose recent fate we mourn,</L>
<L>With costly vestments did the Fair adorn:</L>
<L>Rich gems, and gold, that charm'd th' admiring eye,</L>
<L>Were sprinkle'd o'er your robes of <HI>Tyrian</HI> dye:</L>
<L>Did Foreigners, to see the King, resort,</L>
<L>He proudly show'd the Damsels of his court:—</L>
<L>Your rich attire, with perfect beauty join'd,</L>
<L>Won ev'ry heart, and fill'd th' enraptur'd mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH! <HI>Saul!</HI>—oh! <HI>Jonathan!</HI>—our <HI>lsrael's</HI> hoast!</L>
<L>Ofc have the Heathen prov'd you to their cost:</L>
<L>Your names, with terrour sill'd the nations round—</L>
<L>Appall'd, they heard your warlike trumpet sound.</L>
<L>Swifter, you rush'd to meet the coming war,</L>
<L>Than tow'ring eagles cut the yielding air—</L>
<L>Fiercer than lions tear their destin'd prey,</L>
<L>You met the foe, and swept whole hosts away—</L>
<L>Swift from your bows, unerring, shew the dart;</L>
<L>Nor fail'd your jav'lins to arrest the heart.</L>
<L>Ye sons of <HI>Israel!</HI> thee, the dreadful deed,</L>
<L>Sinks deep within, and makes each bosom bleed.</L>
<L>Your heavy sorrows yet with caution tell,</L>
<L>Lest when in doleful accounts you reveal</L>
<L>The mighty v.oe, <HI>Fhilistia's</HI> sons rejoice,</L>
<L>Loudly blaspheme, and rend the echoing skies—</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="023710_0018_0FC0AEDF0E5C0298"/>Invoke their gods, obscene—fresh altars raise—</L>
<L>While nightly revels shout their idol's praise.</L>
<L>Thus they their impious madness shall proclaim,</L>
<L>Mock all our woe, and curse Jehovah's name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH <HI>Saul!</HI> illustrious hero! may thy name,</L>
<L>With <HI>Jonathan's,</HI> borne on the wings of fame,</L>
<L>Reach, with your glorious deeds, from pole to pole,</L>
<L>'Till winds lie still, and waters cease to roll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How are the mighty fall'n!—the sword, the spear,</L>
<L>And all the rich habiliments of war,</L>
<L>Lie scatter'd o'er the bloody sield, and tell,</L>
<L>How <HI>Israel's</HI> Nobles by the Heathen fell.</L>
