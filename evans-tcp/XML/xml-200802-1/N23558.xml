<P>I Don't know whose house we've got into here, John, but I think when he knows me, we may hope for some refreshment. Zounds, I'm as dry as touch-wood; and to sail at the rate of ten knots an hour, over stubble and farrow, from my own house, but half a league on this side of Gosport, and not to catch these deserters that received the King's bounty, and run from their ships.</P>

Amelia, by deceiving her with a sham marriage, when you passed yourself for Captain Seymor, then putting to sea, leaving her to break her heart, then marrying another lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>But was I not forc'd to that by my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, because she had a great fortune—her death was a judgment upon you,</P>

You think so, but I took care to bring a real clergyman.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is this a time or place for your lec∣tures?—at home, abroad, at sea and land, will you still badger me? Mention my Wild Oats again, and —you scoundrel, since the night my bed-curtains took fire, when you were my boatswain aboard the Eagle, you've got me quite into leading strings—you snatch'd me up on deck, toss'd me into the sea to save me from being burnt, and I was almost drown'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would, but for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you dragg'd me out by the ear like a water dog. Last week, because you saw the tenth bottle uncorked, you rushed in among my friends, and ran away with me, and the next morning Captain O'Shanaghan sends me a challenge, for quitting my chair when he was toast-master—so to save me from the head ach, you'd like to have got my brains blown out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very well—be burnt in your bed, and tumble into the water, like a tight fellow as you are, and promise yourself with sloe juice, see if John cares a piece of mouldy biscuit about it. But I thought you had laid yourself up in ordinary, retired to live quiet upon your estate, and had done with sea affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>John, a man should forget his own con∣venience for his country's good.</P>

Because at home you keep open house▪ you think every body else does the same. Holloa! holloa!—I'll never cease piping till it calls a drop to my whistle.

<SPEAKER>SIR GEO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, as John Dory remarks, I fear my trip through life will be attended with heavy squalls and foul weathers—When my conduct to poor Amelia comes athwart my mind, it's a hurricane for all that day; and when I turn in at night the ballad of Wil∣liam and Mary's ghost

<P>Stop, Midg, tho' 'twas my orders, when I set out on this scamp with the players, the better to conceal my quality, for you before people to treat me as your companion, yet you at the same time should have had discretion enough to remember when we are alone, that I am your master, and son to Sir George Thunder.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, pray mind that familiarity is all over, my frolic is out, I now throw off the player, and shall return directly. My father must by this time have heard of my departure from the academy at Portsmouth; and tho' I was deluded away by my rage for acting, 'twas bad of me to give the gay old fellow any cause of uneasiness.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if my father but forgives me, this three months excursion with the players has shewed me some life, and a devilish deal of fun—for one cir∣cumstance I shall ever remember it with pleasure— it's bringing me acquainted with Jack Rover—how long he stays—Jack
<STAGE>(calls).</STAGE>
In this forlorn stroller I have discovered qualities that honour human nature, and accomplishments that might grace a prince. My poor friend has often lent me his money, though he supposed me a poor needy devil, that could never be able to repay him. He shan't know who I am till it's in my power to serve him; only the rogue always marr'd the grand design of my frolic—I had no chance among the pretty women where he was; he had the knack of winning their hearts by his gaiety. Tho' so devilish pleasant in his quotations, which on the moment he dashes in a parody whimsically oppo∣site to every occasion as it happens, I hope he won't find the purse I've hid in his pocket before we part. I dread the moment—but it's come.</P>

<P>I have spoken to Mary, and she, at my re∣quest, consenteth to take thy daughter Jane for her handmaid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That's hearty—I intended to make a pre∣sent to the person that does me such a piece of ser∣vice, but I shan't afront you with it.</P>

<P>So, I shall get my children off my hands. My son Sim is robbing me day and night, giving away my corn and what not among the poor; my daughter Jane—when girls have nought to do, this mischief love creeps into their minds, and then, hey, they're for kicking up their heels.—Sim, son Sim!</P>

<P>And I'm sure, feyther, I'm willing to do any thing you would have me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>There's ingratitude for you!—when my wife, your mother, died, I brought you up from the shell, and now that you're fledg'd, you want to fly off and forsake me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JANE.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>My being incumbered with you both is the cause why old Banks here won't give me his sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JANE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a pity; if we must have a step∣mother, madam Amelia would make us a very good one—but I wonder how she should refuse you, feyther, for I'm sure she thinks you a very portly man, in your scarlet coat and new scratch.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Retires into the house.</STAGE>

<P>However, if Banks still refuses, I have him in my power, I'll turn them out of their cottage yonder, and the bailiff shall procure them a lodging. Here he comes.—

<P>Madam, I would have paid the rent of my little cottage; but I dare say it was without your Ladyship's consent that your Steward has turned me out, and put my neigbour in possession.</P>

<P>The pangs of adversity I could bear; but the innocent partner of my misfortunes, my unhappy sister—</P>

<SPEAKER>LADY A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did desire Ephraim to send for thy sister; did she dwell with thee, and both now without a home? let her come to mine.</P>

<P>Thou dost mistake; to need my assistance is the highest claim to my attention—let me see her.
<STAGE>(Exit Banks.)</STAGE>
I could chide myself that these pastimes have turned mine eyes from the house of woe. Ah, think ye proud and happy affluent, how many in your dancing moments pine in want, drink their salt tears —their morsel the bread of misery, and shrinking from the cold blast, into their cheerless hovels!

<SPEAKER>AME.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this brother's advice now (twenty years

since) I was prevailed on to listen to the addresses of a young sea officer, for my brother had been chaplain in the navy; but, to our surprize and mortification, we discovered, by the honesty of a sailor, in whom we put confidence, that the Captain's design was only to decoy me into a seeming marriage; our humble friend intreated of us to put the deceit on his master, by concealing from him that my brother was not in orders; he, flattered with the hopes of procuring me an establishment, gave into supposed imposition, and performed the ceremony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Duplicity, even with a good intent, is ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, the event has justified your censure, for my husband, not knowing himself really bound by any legal tie, abandoned me—I followed him to the Indies; distracted, till seeing him, I left my infant at one of our settlements; but after a fruitless search, on my return, I found the friend, to whose care I committed my child, was compelled to retire from the ravages of war, but where I could not hear—rent with agonizing pangs, without a child or husband, I again saw England, and my brother, who wounded himself with remorse for being the cause of my misfortunes, secluded himself from all joys of social life, and invited me to partake the comforts of solitude in that asylum, from whence we have both just now been driven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY A.</SPEAKER>
<P>My pity can do thee no good, yet must I pity thee; but resignation to what must be, may restore peace; if my means can procure thee comfort, they are at thy pleasure—come let thy griefs subside—in∣stead of thy cottage, accept thou and thy brother every convenience that my mansion can afford.</P>

<P>We've long been upon our shifts, and after all our tricks, twists, and turns, as London was too hot for us, a trip to Portsmouth was a hit.</P>
</SP>

<P>HAVING, for some years, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et with very great suc∣cess in my productions of the musical kind; when I wrote the following Opera, it was with unusual care and attention; and it was the general opinion of all my friends, some of whom rank among the best judges, that of all my trifles, Lionel and Clarissa was the most pardon∣able: a decision in its favour, which I was the prouder of, because, to the best of my knowledge, through the whole, I had not borrowed an expression, a sentiment, or a character, from any dramatic writer extant.</P>
<P>When Mr. GARRICK thought of performing this piece at Drury-lane theatre, he had a new singer to bring out, and every thing possible for her advantage was to be done; this necessarily occasioned some new songs and airs to be introduced; and other singers, with voices of a different compass from those who originally acted the parts, occa∣sioned still more; by which means the greatest part of the music unavoidably became new. This is the chief, and indeed the only alteration made in the Opera: and even to that, I should in many places have been forced, much against my will, had it not given a fresh opportunity to Mr. <HI>Dibden</HI> to display his admirable talents as a musical composer. And I will be bold to say, that his airs, se∣rious and comic, in this Opera, will appear to no disad∣vantage by being heard with those of some of the greatest masters.</P>
<P>The SCHOOL FOR FATHERS is added to the title, because the plot in evidently double; and that of Lionel and Clarissa alluded to but one part of it, as the readers and spectators will easily perceive.</P>

<P>Well said, <HI>Dy;</HI> thank you, <HI>Dy.</HI> This, master <HI>Jen∣kins,</HI> is the way I make my daughter entertain me every morning at breakfast. Come here and kiss me, you slut; come here and kiss me, you baggage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, papa, you call one such names—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine girl, master <HI>Jenkins,</HI> a devilish fine girl! she has got my eye to a twinkle. There's fire for you!— spirit!—I design to marry her to a Duke; how much money do you think a Duke would expect with such a wench?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Colonel, with submission, I think there is no occasion to go out of our own country here; we have never a Duke in it, I believe; but we have many an ho∣nest gentleman, who, in my opinion, might deserve the young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you would have me marry <HI>Dy</HI> to a country Squire, eh! How say you to this, <HI>Dy?</HI> Would not you rather be married to a Duke?</P>

<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>So my husband's a rake, papa, I don't care what he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A rake! you damned confounded little baggage; why, you would not wish to marry a rake, would you? So her husband is a rake, she does not care what he is!— Ha, ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but listen to me, papa—When you go out with your gun, do you take any pleasure in shooting the poor tame ducks and chickens in your yard? No, the partridge, the pheasant, the woodcock, are the game; there is some sport in bringing them down, because they are wild; and it is just the same with an husband or a lover. I would not waste powder and shot to wound one of your sober pretty behaved gentlemen; but to hit a libertine, extravagant, madcap fellow, to take him upon the wing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear her, master <HI>Jenkins?</HI> Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but good Colonel, what do you say to my worthy and honorable patron here, Sir <HI>John Flowerdale?</HI> He has an estate of eight thousand pounds a year as well, paid rents as any in the kingdom, and but one only daugh∣ter to enjoy it; and yet he is willing, you see, to give this daughter to your son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. <HI>Jenkins,</HI> how does Miss <HI>Clarissa</HI> and our university friend, Mr. <HI>Lionel?</HI> That is the only grave young man I ever liked, and the only handsome one I ever was acquainted with, that did not make love to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, master <HI>Jenkins,</HI> who is this <HI>Lionel?</HI> They say he is a damned witty, knowing fellow; and egad I think him well enough for one brought up in a college.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>His father was a general officer, a particular friend of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s, who, like many more brave men that live and die in defending their country, left little else than honour behind him▪ Sir <HI>John</HI> sent this young man, at his own expence, to <HI>Oxford;</HI> where, while his son lived, they were upon the same footing: and since our young gentleman's death, which you know unfortunately hap∣pened about two years ago, he has continued him there. During the vacation he is come to pay us a visit, and Sir <HI>John</HI> intends that he shall shortly take orders for a very
<PB N="7" REF="031175_0078_0FEB20A84E6B3D08"/>
considerable benefice in the gift of the family, the pre∣sent incumbent of which is an aged man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>The last time I was at your house, he was teach∣ing Miss <HI>Clarissa</HI> mathematics and philosophy. Lord! what a strange brain I have! If I was to sit down to dis∣tract myself with such studies—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go, hussey, let some of your brother's rascals in∣form their master that he has been long enough at his toilet; here is a message from Sir <HI>John Flowerdale</HI>— You a brain for mathematics, indeed! we shall have women wanting to head our regiments to-morrow or next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, papa, and suppose we did. I believe, in a battle of the sexes, you men would hardly get the bet∣ter of us.</P>
<LG>
<L>To rob them of strength, when wise nature thought fit</L>
<L>By women to still do her duty,</L>
<L>Instead of a sword, she endues them with wit,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, master <HI>Jenkins!</HI> don't you think now that a nobleman, a Duke, an Earl, or a Marquis, might be con∣tent to share his title—I say, you understand me—with a sweetener of thirty or forty thousand pounds, to pay off mortgages? Besides, there's a prospect of my whole estate; for, I dare swear her brother will never have any children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be concerned at that, Colonel, when there are two such fortunes to descend to his heirs, as yours and Sir <HI>John Flowerdale</HI>'s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look you, master <HI>Jenkins,</HI> Sir <HI>John Flower∣dale</HI> is an honest gentleman; our families are nearly re∣lated; we have been neighbours time out of mind; and if he and I have an odd dispute now and then, it is not for
<PB REF="031175_0079_0FEB20AB2E771888"/>
want of a cordial esteem at bottom. He is going to marry his daughter to my son; she is a beautiful girl, an elegant girl, a sensible girl, a worthy girl, and—a word in your ear—damn me, it I an't very sorry for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sorry! Colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—between ourselves, master <HI>Jenkins,</HI> my son won't do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, master <HI>Jenkins,</HI> he won't do—he is not the thing, a prig—At sixteen years old, or thereabouts, he was a bold sprightly boy, as you should see in a thou∣sand; could drink his pint of port, or his bottle of claret —now he mixes all his wine with water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! if that be his only fault, Colonel, he will ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er make the worse husband, I'll answer for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my wife is a woman of quality—I was prevailed upon to send him to be brought up by her brother Lord <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>samy,</HI> who had no children of his own, and promised to leave him an estate—He has got the estate indeed, but the fellow has taken his Lordship's name for it. Now, master <HI>Jenkins,</HI> I would be glad to know how the name of <HI>Jessamy</HI> is better than that of <HI>Oldboy?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! but, Colonel, it is allowed on all hands, that his Lordship has given your son an excellent educa∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! he sent him to the university, and to travel, for sooth; but, what of that? I was abroad, and at the university myself, and never a rush the better for either. I quarrelled with his Lordship about six years before his death, and so had not an opportunity of seeing how the youth went on; if I had, master <HI>Jenkins,</HI> I would no more have suffered him to be made such a monkey of— He has been in my house but three days, and it is all turned topsey-turvey by him and his rascally servants— then his chamber is like a perfumer's shop, with wash-balls, pastes, and pomatum—and do you know he had the impudence to tell me yesterday at my own table, that I did not know how to behave myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Colonel, how does my Lady <HI>Mary?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="031175_0080_0FEB20AE0E1D6B28"/>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my wife? In the old way, master <HI>Jenkins;</HI> always complaining; ever something the matter with her head, or her back, or her legs—but we have had the devil to pay lately—she and I did not speak to one ano∣ther for three weeks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little affair of jealousy—You most know, my game-keeper's daughter has had a child, and the plaguy baggage takes it into her head to lay it to me—Upon my soul, it is a fine fat chubby infant, as ever I set my eyes on; I have sent it to nurse; and, between you and me, I believe I shall leave it a fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Colonel, you will never give over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my Lady has a pretty vein of poetry; she writ me an heroic epistle upon it, where she calls me her dear false <HI>Damon</HI>; so I let her cry a little, promised to do so no more, and now we are as good friends as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Colonel, I must take my leave; I have de∣livered my message, and Sir <HI>John</HI> may expect the pleasure of your company to dinner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, we'll come—pox o' ceremony among friends. But won't you stay to see my son; I have sent to him, and suppose he will be here as soon as his valet-de-chambre will give him leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no occasion, good sir; present my hum∣ble respects, that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, zounds, <HI>Jenkins,</HI> you must not go till you drink something—let you and I have a bottle of hock—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not for the world, Colonel; I never touch any thing strong in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never touch any thing strong! Why, one bottle won't hurt you, man—this is old, and as mild as milk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, Colonel, pray excuse me.</P>
<LG>
<L>To tell you the truth,</L>
<L>In the days of my youth,</L>
<L>As mirth and nature bid,</L>
<L>I lik'd a glass,</L>

<P>That's an exceeding fine china jar your Ladyship has got in the next room; I saw the fellow of it the other day at <HI>Williams</HI>'s, and will send to my agent to purchase it; it is the true matchless old blue and white.

<P>WELL, but, Mr. <HI>Lionel,</HI> consider, pray consi∣der, now, how can you be so prodigious un∣discreet as you are, walking about the hall here, while the gentlefolks are within the parlour!

<P>For Heaven's sake, <HI>Jenny,</HI> don't speak to me: I neither know where I am, nor what I am doing; I am the most wretched and miserable of mankind.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor dear soul, I pity you. Yes, yes, I believe you are miserable enough, indeed; and, I assure you, I have pitied you a great while, and spoke many words in your favour, when you little thought you had such a friend in a corner.</P>

<P>But, good <HI>Jenny,</HI> since, by some accident or other, you have been able to discover what I would wil∣lingly hide from all the world, I conjure you, as you re∣gard my interest, as you value your Lady's peace and ho∣nour, never let the most distant hint of it escape you; for it is a secret of that importance—</P>

<P>And, perhaps, you think, I can't keep a secret. Ah!

<P>That I have this day refused a man, with whom I could not be happy, I make no merit; born for quiet and simplicity, the crowds of the world, the noise at∣tending pomp and distinction, have no charms for me: I wish to pass my life in rational tranquility, with a friend, whose virtues I can respect, whose talents I can admire; who will make my esteem the basis of my affection.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear lad, I have been searching for you this half hour, and was at last told you had come into the garden. I have a piece of news, which, I dare swear will shock and surprize you—My daughter has refused Colo∣nel <HI>Oldboy</HI>'s son, who is this minute departed the house in violent resentment of her ill-treatment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he gone, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the family are preparing to follow him. Oh, <HI>Lionel! Clarissa</HI> has deceived me—In this af∣fair she has suffered me to deceive myself. The measures which I have been so long preparing, are broken in a moment; my hopes frustrated; and both parties, in the eye of the world, rendered light and ridiculous.</P>
</SP>

<P>I am sorry to see you so much moved: pray, sir, recover yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, <HI>Lionel,</HI> she has profited no better by your lessons of philosophy, than to impose upon and distress so kind a father.</P>
</SP>

<P>Have juster thoughts of her, sir: she has not imposed on you; she is incapable—Have but a little pa∣tience, and things may yet be brought about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Lionel,</HI> no; the matter is past, and there's an end to it; yet I would conjecture to what such an un∣expected turn in her conduct can be owing, I would fain be satisfied of the motive that could urge her to so ex∣traordinary

a proceeding, without the least intimation, the least warning to me, or any of her friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, sir, the gentleman may have been too impetuous, and offended Miss <HI>Flowerdale</HI>'s delicacy— certainly nothing else could occasion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven only knows—I think, indeed, there can be no settled aversion; and surely her affections are not engaged elsewhere?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>It troubles me indeed, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>However, my particular disappointment ought not to be detrimental to you, nor shall it: I well know how irksome it is to a generous mind to live in a state of dependance, and have long had it in my thoughts to make you easy for life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir <HI>John,</HI> the situation of my mind is at present a little disturbed—spare me—I beseech you, spare me— Why will you persist in a goodness that makes me asham∣ed of myself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is an estate in this county, which I purchased some years ago. By me it will never be missed, and whoever marries my daughter, will have little rea∣son to complain of my disposing of such a trifle for my own gratification. On the present marriage, I intended to per∣fect a deed of gift in your favour, which has been for some time prepared: my lawyer has this day completed it, and it is yours, my dear <HI>Lionel,</HI> with every good wish that the warmest friend can bestow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if you presented a pistol with a design to shoot me, I would submit to it: but you must excuse me—I can∣not lay myself under more obligations.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your delicacy carries you too far. In this I confer a favour on myself: however, we'll talk no more on the subject at present—Let us walk towards the house;

<P>My dear, what would you say?</P>

<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid of the step we are going to take; indeed, I am—'Tis true my father is the contriver of it; but, really, on consideration, I think I should appear less culpable if he was not so; I am at once criminal myself, and rendering him ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you love me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I do, you give me a very ill proof of your love for me, when you would take advantage of my tenderness, to blind my reason. How can you have so little regard for my honour, as to sacrifice it to a vain triumph? For it is in that light I see the rash action you are forcing me to commit; nay, methinks my con∣senting to it should injure me in your own esteem. When a woman forgets what she owes herself, a lover should set little value upon any thing she gives to him.</P>

<P>Can you suppose then, can you imagine, that my passion will ever make me forget the veneration— And, an elopement is nothing, when it is on the road to matrimony.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>At best, I shall incur the censure of disobedience and indiscretion; and, is it nothing to a young woman what the world says of her? Ah! my good friend, be assured, such a disregard of the world is the first step to∣wards deserving its reproaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the necessity we are under—Mankind has too much good sense, too much good nature—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one has good sense enough to see other people's faults, and good nature enough to overlook their own. Besides, the most sacred things may be made an ill use of; and even marriage itself, if indecently and improperly—</P>

<P>As for you, Mr. <HI>Lionel,</HI> what terms can I find strong enough to paint the excess of my friendship! —I loved, I esteemed, I honoured your father: he was a brave, a generous, and a sincere man; I thought you inherited his good qualities—you were left an orphan, I adopted you, put you upon the footing of my own son; educated you like a gentleman, and designed you for a profession, to which, I thought, your virtues would have been an ornament.</P>

<P>What return you have made me, you seem to be acquainted with yourself: and, therefore, I shall not repeat it—Yet, remember, as an aggravation of your guilt, that the last mark of my bounty was conferred upon you in the very instant when you were undermining my designs. Now, sir, I have but one thing more to say to you—Take my daughter: was she worth a million, she is at your service.</P>

<L>You know them, yet still to destruction you press me,</L>
<L>And force that from passion which prudence denies.</L>
<L>I fain would oppose a perverse inclination;</L>
<L>The visions of fancy from reason divide;</L>
<L>With fortitude baffle the wiles of temptation,</L>
<L>And let Love no longer make Folly its guide.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never in his life, my dear; and I am confident he entertains not the least suspicion of my having any such connexion: my aunt, indeed, has her doubts and surmises; but, besides that my father will not allow any one to be wiser than himself, it is an established maxim between these affectionate relations, never to agree in any thing.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ros.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except being absurd; you must allow they sym∣pathize perfectly in that—But now we are on the sub∣ject, I desire to know what I am to do with this wicked old justice of peace, this libidinous father of yours? He follows me about the house like a tame goat.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I should think it a little hard, I confess —yet when I see you in the character of a chamber∣maid—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ros.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the only character, my dear, in which I could hope to lie concealed: and I can tell you, I was reduced to the last extremity, when, in consequence of our old boarding-school friendship, I applied to you to receive me in this capacity; for we expected the parties the very next week.</P>
</SP>

<P>But had not you a message from your intended spouse, to let you know he was as little inclined to such ill concerted nuptials as you were?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ros.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than so; he wrote to advise me, by all means, to contrive some method of breaking them off,
<PB N="8" REF="031175_0150_0FEB217F51AE9C80"/>
for he had rather return to his dear studies at <HI>Oxford:</HI> and after that, what hopes could I have of being happy with him?</P>

<P>Then you are not at all uneasy at the strange rout you must have occasioned at home, I warrant, dur∣ring this month you have been absent?—</P>

<SPEAKER>Ros.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! don't mention it, my dear; I have had so many admirers since I commenced <HI>Abigail,</HI> that I am quite charmed with my situation—but hold, who stalks yonder into the yard, that the dogs are so glad to see?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Daddy <HI>Hawthorn,</HI> as I live! He is come to pay my father a visit; and never more luckily, for he always forces him abroad. By the way, what will you do with yourself, while I step into the house to see after my trusty messenger <HI>Hodge?</HI></P>

<P>So it seems indeed: sure, <HI>Rosetta,</HI> none of your admirers had power to touch your heart; you are not in love, I hope?</P>

<P>In love! that's pleasant: who do you suppose I should be in love with, pray?</P>

<P>Why, let me see—What do you think of <HI>Thomas</HI> our gardener? There he is at the other end of the walk—He's a pretty young man, and the servants say he's always writing verses on you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, this is excellent, this is mighty good, this is mighty merry, faith; ha! ha! ha! was ever the like heard of? that my boy Tom, should run away from me, for fear of being forced to marry a girl he never saw! that she should scamper from her father for fear of being forced to marry him! and that they should run into one another's arms this way in disguise, by mere accident; against their consents, and without knowing it, as a body may say; master Haw∣thorn,
<PB N="42" REF="031175_0184_0FEB21E684FDE0B8"/>
may I never do an ill turn, if it is not one of the oddest adventures, partly—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir William, it is a romance, a novel, a pleasanter history, by half, than the loves of Dorastus and Faunia; we shall have bellads made of it within these two months, setting forth, how a young 'squire became a serving man of low degree; and it will be stuck up with Margaret's Ghost and the Spanish Lady, against the walls of every cottage in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what pleases me best of all, master Haw∣thorn, is the ingenuity of the girl. May I never do an ill turn, when I was called out of the room, and the ser∣vant said she wanted to speak with me, if I knew what to make on't: but when the little gipsey took me aside, and told me her name, and how matters stood, I was quite astonished, as a body may say: and could not be∣lieve it, partly; till her young friend, that she is with here assured me of the truth on't: Indeed, at last, I began to recollect her face, though I have not set my eyes on her before since she was the height of a full-grown grey-hound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir William, your son as yet knows nothing of what has happened, nor of your being come hither: and, if you'll follow my counsel, we'll have some sport with him.—He and his mistress were to meet in the garden this evening by appointment; she's gone to dress herself in all her airs: will you let me direct your proceedings in this affair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, master Hawthorn, with all my heart, do what you will with me, say what you please for me; I am so overjoyed, and so happy—And may I never do an ill turn, but I am very glad to see you too: ay, and partly as much pleased at that as any thing else, for we have been merry together before now, when we were some years younger: well, and how has the world gone with you, master Hawthorn, since we saw one another last?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, pretty well, Sir William, I have no reason to complain: every one has a mixture of sour with his sweets; but, in the main, I believe, I have done in a degree as tolerably as my neighbours.</P>

<P>Sir William, I beg pardon for detaining you, but I have had so much difficulty in adjusting my bor∣rowed plumes—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I never do an ill turn, but they fit you to a T, and you look very well, so you do: Cocks∣bones, how your father will cuckle when he comes to hear this!—Her father, master Hawthorn, is as worthy a man as lives by bread, and has been almost out of his senses for the loss of her—But tell me, hussey, has not this been all a scheme, a piece of conjuration between you and my son? Faith, I am half persuaded it has, it looks so like hocus-pocus, as a body may say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ros.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir William, what has happened has been the mere effect of chance; I came hither un∣known to your son, and he unknown to me: I never in the least suspected that Thomas the gardener was other than his appearance spoke him; and least of all, that he was a person with whom I had so close a connection. Mr. Hawthorn can testify the astonishment I was in when he first informed me of it; but I thought it was my du∣ty to come to an immediate explanation with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not she a neat wench, master Hawthorn? May I never do an ill turn, but she is.—But, you little plaguy devil, how came this love affair between you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ros.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have told you the whole truth very ingenuous∣ly, sir: since your son and I have been fellow-servants, as I may call it, in this house, I have had more than reason to suspect he had taken a liking to me; and I will own with equal frankness, had I not looked upon
<PB N="44" REF="031175_0186_0FEAEF32D8CF6508"/>
him as a person so much below me, I should have had no objection to receiving his courtship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, by the lord Harry, all above board, fair and open.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ros.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I may be censured by some for this can∣did declaration; but I love to speak my sentiments; and I assure you, Sir William, in my opinion, I should prefer a gardener with your son's good qualities, to a knight of the shire without them.</P>

<P>This is mighty pretty romantic stuff! but you learn it out of your play-books and novels.

I ne∣ver looked into a book, but when I said my prayers, except it was the Complete Housewife, or the great fa∣mily receipt book: whereas you are always at your stu∣dies!

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE other culprits brave it to the last;</L>
<L>Nor beg for mercy till the judgment's past:</L>
<L>Poets alone, as conscious of their crimes,</L>
<L>Open their trials with imploring rhymes.</L>
<L>Thus cramm'd with flattery and low submission,</L>
<L>Each trite dull prologue is the bard's petition.</L>
<L>A stale device to calm the critic's fury,</L>
<L>And bribe at once the judges and the jury.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what avail such poor repeated arts?</L>
<L>The whimp'ring scribbler ne'er can touch your hearts:</L>
<L>Nor ought an ill-tim'd pity to take place—</L>
<L>Fast as they rise, destroy th' increasing race:</L>
<L>The vermin else will run the nation o'er—</L>
<L>By saving one, you breed a million more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' disappointed authors rail and rage,</L>
<L>At fancy'd parties, and a senseless age,</L>
<L>Yet still has justice triumph'd on the stage.</L>
<L>Thus speaks and thinks the author of to-day,</L>
<L>And saying this, has little more to say.</L>
<L>He asks no friend his partial zeal to show,</L>
<L>Nor fears the groundless censures of a foe;</L>
<L>He knows no friendship can protect the fool,</L>
<L>Nor will an audience be a party's tool.</L>
<L>'Tis inconsistent with a free-born spirit,</L>
<L>To side with folly, or to injure merit.</L>
<L>By your decision he must fall or stand,</L>
<L>Nor, tho' he feels the lash, will blame the hand.</L>
</LG>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THO' the young smarts, I see, begin to sneer,</L>
<L>And the old sinners cast a wicked leer:</L>
<L>Be not alarm'd, ye fair—you've nought to fear.</L>
<L>No wanton hint, no loose ambiguous sense,</L>
<L>Shall flatter vicious taste at your expence,</L>
<L>Leaving for once these shameless arts in vogue:</L>
<L>We give a <HI>Fable</HI> for the <HI>Epilogue.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AN <HI>ass</HI> there was, our author bid me say,</L>
<L>Who needs must write—he did—and wrote a play.</L>
<L>The parts were cast to various beasts and fowl:</L>
<L>Their stage a barn;—the manager an owl!</L>
<L>The house was cramm'd at six, with friends and foes;</L>
<L>Rakes, wits, and critics, citizens and beaux.</L>
<L>These characters appear'd in different shapes</L>
<L>Of tigers, foxes, horses, bulls and apes;</L>
<L>With others too, of lower rank and station:—</L>
<L>A perfect abstract of the brute creation!</L>
<L>Each, as he felt, mark'd out the author's faults,</L>
<L>And thus the <HI>connoisseurs</HI> express'd their thoughts.</L>
<L>The <HI>critic curs</HI> first snarl'd—the rules are broke!</L>
<L>Time, place, and action sacrific'd to joke!</L>
<L>The <HI>goats</HI> cry'd out, 'twas formal, dull, and chaste—</L>
<L>Not writ for beasts of gallantry and taste!</L>
<L>The <HI>horned-cattle</HI> were in piteous taking,</L>
<L>At fornification, rapes and cuckold making!</L>
<L>The <HI>tigers</HI> swore, he wanted fire and passion.</L>
<L>The <HI>apes</HI> condemn'd—because it was the fashion!</L>
<L>The generous <HI>steeds</HI> allow'd him proper merit:</L>
<L>Here mark'd his faults, and there approv'd his spirit.</L>
<L>While <HI>brother-bards</HI> bray'd forth with usual spleen,</L>
<L>And, as they heard, exploded every scene.</L>
<L>When <HI>reynard</HI>'s thoughts were ask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, the shrugging sage,</L>
<L>Fam'd for hypocrisy, and worn with age,</L>
<L>Condemn'd <HI>the shameless licence of the stage!</HI></L>
<L>At which the <HI>monkey</HI> skipp'd from box to box,</L>
<L>And whisper'd round the judgment of the <HI>fox:</HI></L>
<L>Abus'd the moderns, talk'd of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece!</HI></L>
<L>Bilk'd every box-keeper; and damn'd the piece.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now every fable has a moral to it—</L>
<L>Be churchman, statesman, any thing—but poet.</L>
<L>In law, or physic, quack in what you will;</L>
<L>Cant, and grimace conceal the want of skill!</L>
<L>Secure in these, his gravity may pass—</L>
<L>But <HI>here</HI> no artifice can hide the <HI>ass.</HI></L>

<P>ONCE more I am got safe to the <HI>Temple</HI>—let me reflect a little—I have sat up all night. I have my head full of bad wine, and the noise of oaths, dice, and the damned tingling of tavern bells; my spirits jaded, and my eyes sunk into my head: and all this for the conversation of a company of fellows I despise. Their wit lies only in obscenity, their mirth in noise, and their delight in a box and dice. Honest <HI>Ranger</HI> take my word for it, thou art a mighty silly fellow.</P>

Have you been for the money this morning, as I or∣dered you?</P>

Pshah! pox! Mr. <HI>Bellamy,</HI> how should you like to be served so yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you, Ranger, for a minute's plea∣sure, give an innocent girl the pain of heart I am con∣fident she felt?—There was a modest blush upon her cheek convinces me she was honest.</P>

<P>May be so. I was resolved to try, however.</P>

<P>Fy, Ranger,—will you never think?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but I can't be always thinking. The law is a damnable dry study, Mr. Bellamy, and with∣out something now and then to amuse, and relax, it would be too much for my brain, I promise ye—but I am a mighty sober fellow grown—Here have I been

at it these three hours—but the wenches will never let me alone—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>My boy <HI>Ranger,</HI> I am heartily glad to see you. <HI>Bellamy,</HI> let me embrace you. You are the person I want. I have been at your lodgings, and was direct∣ed hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is to him then I am obliged for this visit: but with all my heart—he is the only man, to whom I don't care how much I am obliged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your very humble servant, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know Ranger, I want no inducement to be with you. But—you look sadly—what—no mer∣ciless jade has—has she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, sound as a roach my lad. I only got a little too much liquor last night, which I have not slept off yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus, <HI>Frankly,</HI> it is every day. All the morning his head aches, at noon he begins to clear up, to∣wards evening he is good company, and all night he is carefully providing for the same course the next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I must own, my ghostly father, I did relapse a little lastnight, just to furnish out a decent confession for the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he is now doing penance for it. Were you his confessor indeed, you could not well desire more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Charles,</HI> he sets up for a confessor with the worst grace in the world. Here he has been reproving me for being but decently civil to my millener. Plague! because the coldness of his constitution makes him in∣sensible of a fine woman's charms, every body else must be so too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am no less sensible of their charms than you are; tho' I cannot kiss every woman I meet, or fall in love, as you call it, with every face which has the bloom of youth upon it. I would only have you a lit∣tle more frugal of your pleasures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="031175_0211_0FEB222D11903F10"/>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear friend, this is very pretty talking. But let me tell you, it is in the power of the very first glance from a fine woman utterly to disconcert all your philosophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be from a fine woman then: and not such as are generally reputed so—and it must be a tho∣rough acquaintance with her too, that will ever make an impression on my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I could see it once! for when a man has been all his life hoarding up a stock, without allow∣ing himself common necessaries, it tickles me to the soul to see him lay it all out upon a wrong bottom, and become a bankrupt at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I don't care how soon you see it. For the minute I find a woman capable of friendship, love, and tenderness, with good sense enough to be always easy, and good nature enough to like me, I will im∣mediately put it to the trial, which of us shall have the greatest share of happiness from the sex, you or I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>By marrying her, I suppose! Capable of friend∣ship, love, and tenderness, ha, ha, ha! That a man of your sense should talk so. If she be capable of love 'tis all I require of my mistress; and as every woman, who is young, is capable of love, I am very reasonably in love with every young woman I meet.—My Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> in a case I read this very morning, speaks my very sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Both.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord <HI>Coke!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>my</HI> Lord <HI>Coke!</HI> What he says of one woman, I say of the whole sex. <HI>I take their bodies, you their minds; which has the better bargain?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no arguing with so great a lawyer. Suppose therefore we adjourn the debate to some other time. I have some serious business with Mr. <HI>Bellamy,</HI> and you want sleep I am sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sleep! mere loss of time, and hindrance of business—We men of spirit, sir, are above it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whither shall we go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into the <HI>Park.</HI> My chariot is at the door.</P>

You saw how he receiv∣ed us when we came off our journey; tho' <HI>Clarinda</HI> was so good company. He was barely civil to her, and downright rude to me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot help saying I did observe it.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr.</HI> Strictland.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, your servant, madam! here I have received a letter from Mr <HI>Bellamy,</HI> wherein he desires I would once more hear what he has to say—You know my sentiments — Nay, so does he.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>For Heaven's sake consider, sir. This is no new affair, no sudden start of passion—We have known each other long. My father valued and loved him; and I am sure were he alive, I should have his consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me. Your father would not have you marry against his will; neither will I, against mine; I am your father now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you take a fatherly care of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had never had any thing to do with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may easily get rid of the trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>By listening, I suppose, to the young gentleman's proposals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which are very reasonable, in my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very modest ones, truly; and a very modest gentleman it is that proposes them! a fool, to expect a lady of thirty thousand pounds fortune should, by the care and prudence of her guardian, be thrown away upon a young fellow not worth three hundred a year. He thinks being in love is an excuse
<PB N="8" REF="031175_0214_0FEB2235EB1B4358"/>
for all this; but I am not in love. What does he think will excuse me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Mr. <HI>Strictland,</HI> I think the gentleman should be heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well! Seven o'clock is the time if the man has the good fortune, since I saw him last, to persuade somebody or other to give him a better estate, I give him my consent not else. His servant waits below. You may tell him, I shall be at home.
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Jacin.]</STAGE>
But where is your friend, your other half, all this while? I thought you could not have breath'd a minute without your <HI>Clarinda.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the truth is, I was going to see what makes her keep her chamber so long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye Mrs. <HI>Strictland,</HI> you have been asking me for money this morning. In plain terms, not one shilling shall pass through these fingers, till you have cleared my house of this <HI>Clarinda.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can her innocent gaiety have of∣fended you? She is a woman of honor, and has as ma∣ny good qualities—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>As women of honor generally have. I know it and therefore am uneasy.</P>

<P>But, sir,—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>But madam,—<HI>Clarinda,</HI> nor e'er a rake of fashion in <HI>England,</HI> shall live in my family to debauch it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, she treated me with so much civi∣lity in the country, that I thought I could not do less than invite her to spend as much time with me in town, as her engagements would permit. I little imagined you could have been displeased at my having so agreea∣ble a companion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a time when I was company enough for leisure hours.</P>

Understand me right. I do not mean by what I have said, that I suspect your innocence: but by crushing this growing friendship all at once, I may prevent a train of mischief which you do not foresee.

<P>Now, <HI>Bellamy,</HI> I may unfold the secret of my heart to you with greater freedom; for though <HI>Ran∣ger</HI> has honor, I am not in a humour to be laughed at. I must have one, that will bear with my impertinence, sooth me into hope, and like a friend indeed, with ten∣derness advise me.</P>

<P>I thought you appeared more grave than usual.</P>

<P>Oh! <HI>Bellamy,</HI> my soul is so full of joy, of
<PB N="10" REF="031175_0216_0FEB223CEFAA1E30"/>
pain, hope, despair and extasy, that no word but love is capable of expressing what I feel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is love the secret <HI>Ranger</HI> is not fit to hear? In my mind, he wou'd prove the more able counsellor. And is all the gay indifference of my friend at last re∣duced to love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so—Never was prude more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esolute in chastity and ill-nature, than I was fixed in indifference: but love has rais'd me from that inactive state above the being of a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, <HI>Charles,</HI> I begin to think it has—but pray bring this rapture into order a little, and tell me regularly, how, where, and when?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I was not most unreasonably in love, those horrid questions would stop my mouth at once. But as I am arm'd against reason—I answer—at <HI>Bath</HI>—on Tuesday, she danced and caught me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>Danced?—and was that all? But who is she? What is her name? her fortune? where does she live?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! hold! not so many hard questions. Have a little mercy. I know but little of her, that<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s certain. But all I do know you shall have. That even∣ing was the first of her appearing at <HI>Bath.</HI> The moment I saw her I resolved to ask the favour of her hand. But the easy freedom with which she gave it, and her unaf∣fected good-humour during the whole night, gain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d such a power over my heart, as none of her sex could ever boast before. I waited on her home, and the next morn∣ing, when I went to make the usual compliments, the bird was flown. She had set out for <HI>London</HI> two hours before; and in a chariot and six—you rogue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>But was it her own, <HI>Charles?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I don't know; but it looks better than being drag'd to own in the stage. That day and the next I spent in enquiries. I waited on the ladies who came with her. They knew nothing of her. So, with∣out learning either her name or fortune, I e'en call'd for my boots, and rode post after her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you find yourself after your journey?</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, as yet, I own, I am but upon a cold

scent. But a woman of her sprightliness and gentility cannot but frequent all public places; and when once she is found, the pleasure of the chase will over-pay the pains of rousing her. Oh! <HI>Bellamy,</HI> there was some∣thing peculiarly charming in her, that seemed to claim my farther acquaintance: and if in the other more fa∣miliar parts of life she shines with that superior lustre, and at last I win her to my arms, how shall I bless my resolution in pursuing her!</P>

<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I cannot but own—I never had a thought of any man that troubled me, but of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I dare swear, by this time, you heartily repent your leaving <HI>Bath</HI> so soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you are mistaken. I have not had one scruple since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what one inducement can he have ever to think of you again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the greatest of all inducements, curiosity. Let me assure you, a woman's surest hold over a man is to keep him in uncertainty. As soon as ever you put him out of doubt, you put him out of your power: but when once a woman has awak'd his curiosity, she may lead him a dance of many a troublesome mile without the least fear of losing him at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now do I heartily wish he may have spirit enough to follow and use you as you deserve. Such a spirit, with but a little knowledge of our sex, might put that heart of yours into a strange flutter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I care not how soon. I long to meet with such a fellow. Our modern beaux are such jointed babies in love, they have no feeling. They are entirely insen∣sible either of pain or pleasure, but from their own dear persons: and according as we flatter, or affront their beauty, they admire or forsake ours. They are not worthy even our displeasure; and, in short, abusing them is but so much ill-nature merely thrown away. But the man of sense, who values himself upon his high abilities: or the man of wit, who thinks a woman be∣neath his conversation—to see such the subjects of our power, the slaves of our frowns and smiles is glo∣rious indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>No men of sense, or wit either, if they be truly so, ever did, or ever can think a woman of me∣rit beneath their wisdom to converse with.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor will such a woman value herself upon making such a lover uneasy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing! why, every woman can give ease; you cannot be in earnest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can assure you she is, and has put in practice the doctrine she has been teaching.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! who ever heard the name of love mention'd without an idea of torment? But pray let us hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, there is nothing to hear that I know of.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>The novel, as you call it, is not so short as you may imagine. I and my spark have been long acquainted. As he was continually with my father, I soon perceived that he loved me, and the manner of his expressing that love was what pleas'd and won me most.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! and how was it? the old bait! Flattery, dear Flattery, I warrant ye?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed,—I had not the pleasure of hearing my person, wit and beauty painted out with forced praises; but I had a more sensible delight in perceiving the drift of his whole behaviour was to make every hour of my time pass-away agreeably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The rustic! what, did he never say a hand∣some thing of your person?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>

<P>On my conscience you are well match'd.</P>

<P>So well, that if my guardian denies me hap∣piness, (and this evening he is to pass his final sentence) nothing is left but to break my prison, and fly into my lover's arms for safety.</P>

<P>To my behaviour, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot but remember me at <HI>Bath,</HI> ma∣dam, where I so lately had the favour of your hand—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do remember, sir; but I little expected any wrong interpretation of my behaviour, from one, who had so much the appearance of a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I saw of your behaviour was so just, it would admit of no misinterpretation. I only fear'd, whatever reason you had to conceal your name from me at <HI>Bath,</HI> you might have the same to do it now; and tho' my happiness was so nearly concerned, I rather chose to venture thus abruptly after you, than be im∣pertinently inquisitive.</P>

<P>Sir, there seems to be so much civility in your rudeness, that I can easily forgive it; tho' I don't see how your happiness is at all concerned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, madam! I believe you are the only lady, who could with the qualifications you are mistress of, be insensible of the power they give you over the hap∣piness of our sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>How vain should we women be, if you gen∣tlemen were but wise! if you did not all of you say the same things to every woman, we should certainly be foolish enough to believe some of you were in earnest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could you have the least sense of what I feel whilst I am speaking, you would know me to be in earnest, and what I say to be the dictates of a heart that admires you. May I not say—</P>

<P>Sir, this is carrying the—</P>

<P>This behaviour, sir, is so different from the gaiety of your conversation then, that I am at a loss how to answer you.</P>

<P>There is nothing, madam, which could take off from the gaiety with which your presence inspires every heart, but the fear of losing you. How can I be otherwise than as I am, when I know not, but you may leave <HI>London</HI> as abruptly as you did <HI>Bath?</HI></P>

<P>How did you lose her after we parted?</P>

<P>By too great confidence. When I got her to my chair, the chairmen were not to be found.—And safe, as I thought in our disguise, I actually put her into the chair, when Mr. Strictland and his servants were in sight; which I had no sooner done, than they sur∣rounded us, overpowered me, and carried her away.</P>

<P>Unfortunate indeed! could you not make a second attempt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had designed it. But when I came to the door, I found the ladder removed; and hearing no noise, seeing no lights, nor being able to make any body answer, I concluded all attempts as impractica∣ble as now I find them. Ha! I see Lucetta coming. Then they may be still in town.

<P>O, no matter! they'll follow with my things. It is but a little way off, and my chair will guard me. After my staying out so late last night, I am sure Mr. <HI>Strictland</HI> will think every minute an age whilst I am in his house.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, if the world will speak ill of me, for the little innocent gaiety, which I think the peculiar happiness of my temper, I know no way to prevent it; and am only sorry the world is so ill-natur'd: but I shall not part with my mirth, I assure them, so long as I know it innocent. I wish, my dear, this may be the greatest uneasiness your husband's jealousy ever gives you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope he never again may have such occasion, as he had last night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are so unfashionable a wife!—why, last night's accident would have made half the wives in <HI>London</HI> easy for life. Has not his jealousy discover'd itself openly? and are not you innocent? there is no∣thing but your foolish temper that prevents his being absolutely in your power.</P>

<P><HI>Clarinda,</HI> this is too serious an affair to laugh at. Let me advise you, take care of Mr. <HI>Frankly,</HI> observe his temper well; and if he has the least taint of jealousy, cast him off, and never trust to keeping him in your power.</P>

<P>You would only!—you would only re∣peat what you have been saying this hour, <HI>I am inno∣cent</HI>; and when I showed you the letter I had taken from your maid, what was then your poor evasion? but that it was to Clarinda, and you were innocent!</P>

<P>Heaven knows I am innocent.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I know your Clarinda, your woman of honor is your blind, your cover, your—but why do I distract myself about a woman I have no longer any concerns with? Here, madam, is your fate. A letter to your brother in the country.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>That brother was my only hope, my only ground of patience. In his retirement I hoped my name might have been safe, and slept, till by some happy means you might at length have known me inno∣cent, and pitied me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Retirement! pretty soul! no, no! that face was never made for retirement. It is another sort of retiring you are fittest for.—Ha! hark! what's that.

<LETTER>
<P>Sir, we cannot bear to reflect that Mrs. Strictland may possibly be ruin'd in your esteem, and in the voice of the world, only by the confusion which our af∣fair has made in your family, without offering all within our power to clear the misunderstanding be∣tween you. If you will give yourself the trouble but to step to Mr. Meggot's, where all the parties will be; we doubt not but we can entirely satisfy your most flagrant suspicions, to the honor of Mrs. Strictland, and the quiet of your lives.</P>

<P>Ha! here she is, and with her the very man I saw deliver the letter to <HI>Lucetta</HI>—I do begin to fear I have made myself a fool—now for the proof— here is a letter, sir, which has given me great distur∣bance, and these gentlemen assure me it was writ by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>That letter, sir, upon my honor, I left this morning with <HI>Lucetta,</HI> for this lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that lady! and Frankly, the name at the bottom is not feigned, but your real name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frankly is my name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, I feel myself ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now Mr. <HI>Strictland</HI>—I hope—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack Meg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! ay! a clear case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied, and will go this instant to <HI>Mrs. Strictland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then the devil fetch me, if this would sa∣tisfy me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, nothing. It is no affair of mine.</P>

<P>What do you mean, Ranger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! what do you mean? I will know be∣fore I stir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, sir. Cannot you see that all this may be a concerted matter between them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ranger,</HI> you know I can resent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on—I will defend you, let who will resent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, sir, I declare myself your friend; and were I as you—nothing but their immediate mar∣riage should convince me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you're right, and are my friend, in∣deed. Give me your hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, were I to hear her say, I, <HI>Clarinda,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="031175_0272_0FEB22E68E5FC770"/>
take thee <HI>Charles,</HI> I would not believe them 'till I saw them a-bed together. Now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esent it as you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, sir, as you will. But nothing less shall convince me; and so, my fine lady, if you are in earnest—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, Mr. <HI>Strictland</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no flouncing! you cannot escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Frankly has't no soul?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pity her confusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pity her confusion!—the man's a fool—here, take her hand—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus on my knees then, let me ravish with your hand, your heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ravish it you cannot; for it is with all my heart I give it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so am I, now it once is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang</SPEAKER>
<P>And so am I, my dainty cousin—and I wish you joy of a man, your whole sex would go to cuffs for, if they knew him but half so well as I do—ha! she here! this is more than I bargained for.

Madam, re∣proach me not with my folly, and you shall never hear of it again.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reproach you! No! if ever you hear the least reflection pass my lips, forsake me in that in∣stant. Or, what would yet be worse, suspect me again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is enough. I am ashamed to talk to thee. This letter which I wrote your brother, thus I tear in pieces, and with it part forever with my jealousy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a joy indeed! as great as unex∣pected. Yet there is one thing wanting to make it lasting.</P>

<P>Be assur'd, every other suspicion of me was as unjust as your last; though perhaps you had more foundations for your fears.</P>

<P>There was a man, as you suspected, in my chamber last night.</P>

<P>Ha! take care, I shall relapse.</P>

<P>Let him explain the rest.</P>

<P>A frolic! a meer frolic! on my life.</P>
</SP>

<P>A frolic! Ounds!
<STAGE>They interpose.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay don't let us quarrel the very moment you declar'd yourself my friend. There was no harm done, I promise you. Nay, never frown. After I have told my story: any satisfaction you are pleased to ask, I shall be ready to give.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be quick then and ease me of my pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, as I was strolling about last night, —upon the look out, I must confess—Chance, and chance only, convey'd me to your house: where I espied a ladder of ropes most invitingly fasten'd to the window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which ladder I had fastened for my escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Up mounted I, and up I should have gone, if it had been into the garret. I opened one door, then another, and to my great surprise, the whole house was silent. At last, I stole into a room where this lady was undressing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath and the devil! you did not dare sure—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether I had dared, or no: if I had not heard the maid say something of her master's being jealous. O! damn me, thought I, then the work is half done to my hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mind that Mr. Strictland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do — I do most feelingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>The maid grew saucy, and most conveniently to my wishes, was turned out of the room; and if you had not the best wife in the world —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ounds! sir, but what right have you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>What right sir? if you will be jealous of your wife without a cause; if you will be out at that time of night, when you might have been so much better employed at home: we young fellows think we have a right—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="68" REF="031175_0274_0FEB22E9E307D988"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>No joking, I beseech you. You know not what I feel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then seriously, I was mad, or drunk enough, call it which you will, to be very rude to this lady; for which I ask both her pardon and yours! I am an odd sort of a fellow, perhaps: but I am above telling you or any man, a lye▪—damn me if I am not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must, I cannot but believe you; and for the future, madam, you shall find here a heart ready to love and trust you. No tears, I beg; I cannot bear them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot speak; and yet there is a fa∣vour, sir.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you—and as a proof of the sincerity with which I speak, I beg it as a favour, of this lady, in particular
<STAGE>[<HI>to</HI> Clarinda],</STAGE>
and of all the company in general, to return to my house immediate∣ly; where every thing, Mr. <HI>Bellamy,</HI> shall be settled to your entire satisfaction—no thanks; I have not deserved them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack Meg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, sir: the fiddles are ready; Mrs. <HI>Bellamy</HI> has promised me her hand; and I won't part with one of you till midnight; and if you are as well satisfied as you pretend to be, let our friend <HI>Rattle</HI> here begin the ball with Mrs. <HI>Strictland;</HI> for he seems to be the hero of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Strict.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you and the company please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rang.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is honest. Continue but in this humour, and faith, sir, you may trust me to run about your house like a spaniel.— I cannot sufficiently admire at the whimsicalness of my good fortune, in being so instrumental to this general happiness.—<HI>Bellamy, Frankly,</HI> I wish you joy with all my heart! (tho' I had rather you should be married than I, for all that.) Never did matrimony appear to me with a smile upon her face, till this instant.</P>
<LG>
<L>Sure joys for ever wait each happy pair,</L>
<L>When sense the man, and virtue crowns the fair;</L>
<L>And kind compliance proves their mutual care.</L>
