<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE abilities of LORD CHESTERFIELD to inculcate such precepts as should form the mind and fashion the manners of youth▪ are too uni∣versally admired to need encomium. In the ADVICE of that noble EARL to his SON, there are to be found such judicious remarks on men, manners, and things, connected with so intimate a knowledge of the world, that the sentiments, considered as maxims, form a very valuable system of education.</P>
<P>But as the observations of different writers on the same subject are mutually illustrative of each other; to render the following work still more acceptable, the MARCHIONESS DE LAMBERT's "Advice to her Son," a tract particularly recommended by Lord CHESTERFIELD to HIS SON, is annex∣ed.</P>
<P>That nothing might be wanting to render the following work complete, the PRECEPTS of Lord BURLEIGH to his SON are added, as highly estima¦ble on the subjects of manners and education. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most ordinary sentiments of so dignified a chara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

acquire weight; but when a series of well-digested Precepts, the result of great knowledge and extensive experience, are delivered for the guidance of a Son in the momentous concerns of life and happiness, the Preceptor claims our esteem, and his opinions our reverence.</P>

<HEAD>LORD CHESTERFIELD's ADVICE TO HIS SON.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ABSENCE OF MIND.</HEAD>
<P>AN Absent Man is generally either a very weak, or a very affected man; he is, how∣ever, a very disagreeable man in company. He is defective in all the common offices of civility; he does not enter into the general conversation, but breaks into it from time to time, with some starts of his own, as if he waked from a dream. He seems wrapt up in thought, and possibly does not think at all: he does not kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his most inti∣mate acquaintance by sight, or answers them as if he were at cross-purposes. He leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would pro∣bably leave his shoes in a third if his buckles, though awry, did not save them. This is a sure indication, either of a mind so weak that it can∣not bear above one object at a time; or so affect∣ed, that it would be supposed to be wholly en∣grossed by some very great and important objects. Sir Isaac Newton, Mr. Locke, and perhaps five
<PB N="2" REF="025064_0010_0FCE483B4707AAD8"/>
or six more since the Creation, may have had a right to absence, from the intense thought their investigations required; but such liberties cannot be claimed by, nor will be tolerated in, any other persons.</P>
<P>No man is, in any degree, fit for either business or conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd his attention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t object, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> When I see a man ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent in mind, I c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose to be absent in body; for it is almost impossible for me to stay in the room, as I cannot stand inattention and awkward∣ness.</P>
<P>I would rather be in company with a dead man than with an absent one; for if the dead man affords me no pleasure, at least he shews me no contempt; whereas the absent man very plainly, though silently, tells me that he does not think me worth his attention. Besides, an absent man can never make any observations upon the cha∣racters, customs, and manners of the company. He may be in the best companies all his life-time (if they will admit him), and never become the wiser: we may as well converse with a deaf man, as an absent one. It is indeed a practical blunder to address ourselves to a man, who, we plainly perceive, neither hears, minds, nor understands us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ATTENTION.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN is fit for neither business or pleasure, who either cannot, or does not command and direct his attention to the present object, and, in some degree, banish, for that time, all other objects from his thoughts. If at a ball, a sup∣per,
<PB N="3" REF="025064_0011_0FCE483C2C7A2778"/>
or a party of pleasure, a man were to be solving, in his own mind, a problem in Euclid, he would be a very bad companion, and make a poor figure in that company; or if, in studying a problem in his closet, he were to think of a minuet, I am apt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o believe that he would make a very poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mathematician▪</P>
<P>There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough for eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ything, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the course of the day, if you do but one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce: but there is not time enough in the year, if you will do two things at a time.</P>
<P>This steady and undissipated attention to one ob∣ject is a sure mark of a superior genius; as hurry, bustle, and agitation, are the never-failing symptoms of a weak and frivolous mind.</P>
<P>Indeed, without attention nothing is to be done: want of attention, which is really want of thought, is either folly or madness. You should not only have attention to every thing, but a quickness of attention, so as to observe, at once, all the people in the room, their motions, their looks, and their words; and yet, without staring at them, and seeming to be an observer. This quick and unobserved observation is of infinite advantage in life, and is to be acquired with care; and, on the contrary, what is called absence, which is a thoughtlessness and want of attention about what is doing, makes a man so like either a fool or a madman, that, for my part, I see no real difference. A fool never has thought; a madman has lost it; and an absent man is, for the time, without it.</P>
<P>In short, the most material knowledge of all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mean the knowledge of the world, is never to be acquired without great attention: and I know many old people, who, though they have lived
<PB N="4" REF="025064_0012_0FCE4840AD3C5668"/>
long in the world, are but children still as to the knowledge of it, from their levity and inattention. Certain forms, which all people comply with, and certain arts, which all people aim at, hide, in some degree, the truth, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve a general exterior resem∣blance to almost every body. Attention and sagacity must see through that veil, and discover the natural character.</P>
<P>Add to this, there are little att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntions which are infinitely engaging, and which sensibly affect that degree of pride and self-love which is inseparable from human nature; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are unquestionable proofs of the regard and consideration which we have for the persons to whom we pay them. As for ex∣ample: Suppose you invited any body to dine or sup with you, you ought to recollect if you had ob∣served that they had any favourite dish, and take care to provide it for them: and when it came, you should say,
<Q>You seemed to me, at such and such a place, to give this dish a preference, and there∣fore I ordered it.</Q>
—This is the wine that I observ∣ed you liked, and therefore I procured some." Again: Most people have their weaknesses; they have their aversions or their likings to such or such things. If we were to laugh at a man for his aversi∣on to a cat or cheese (which are common antipathies) or, by inattention or negligence, to let them come in his way where we could prevent it; he would, in the first case, think himself insulted, and in the second, slighted; and would remember both. But, on the other hand, our care to procure for him what he likes, and to remove from him what he dislikes, shews him that he is at least an object of our atten∣tion, flatters his vanity, and perhaps makes him more you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> friend, than a more important service
<PB N="5" REF="025064_0013_0FCE4842E34A0308"/>
have done. The more trifling these things are, the more they prove your attention for the person, and are consequently the more engaging. Con∣sult your own breast, and recollect how these lit∣tle attentions, when shewn you by others, flatter that degree of self-love and vanity from which no man living is free. Reflect how they incline and attract you to that person, and how you are pro∣pitiated afterwards to all which that person says or does. The same causes will have the same effects in your favour.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AWKWARDNESS OF DIFFERENT KINDS.</HEAD>
<P>MANY very worthy and sensible people have certain odd tricks, ill habits, and awkward∣nesses in their behaviour, which excite a disgust to, and dislike of their persons, that cannot be removed or overcome by any other valuable endowment or merit which they may possess.</P>
<P>Now awkwardness can proceed but from two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣ses: either from not having kept good compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, or from not having attended to it.</P>
<P>When an awkward fellow first comes into a room, it is highly probale, that his sword gets between his legs, and throws him down, or makes him stumble, at least; when he has recovered th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accident, he goes and places himself in the very place of the whole room where he should not; there he soon lets his hat fall down, and in taking it up again, throws down his cane; in recover∣ing his cane, his hat falls a second time; so that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a quarter of an hour before he is in order
<PB N="6" REF="025064_0014_0FCE48446BDCD220"/>
again. If he drinks tea or coffee, he certainly scalds his mouth, and lets either the cup or the sacer fall, and spills the tea or coffee in his breeches. At dinner, his awkwardness distin∣guishes itself particularly, as he has more to do; there he holds his knife, fork, and spoon, dif∣ferently from other people; eats with his knife to the great danger of his mouth, picks his teeth with his fork, and puts his spoon, which has been in his throat twenty times, into the dishes again. If he is to carve, he can never hit the joint; but, in his vain efforts to cut through the bone, scatters the sauce in every body's face. He generally daubs himself with soup and grease, though his napkin is commonly stuck through a button-hole, and tickles his chin. When he drinks, he infallibly coughs in his glass, and be∣sprinkles the company. Besides all this, he has strange tricks and gestures; such as snuffing up his nose, making faces, putting his fingers in his nose, or blowing it and looking afterwards in his handkerchief, so as to make the company sick. His hands are troublesome to him when he has not something in them, and he does not known where to put them; but they are in perpetual mo∣tion between his bosom and his breeches: he does not wear his cloaths, and, in short, does nothing like other people. All this, I own, is not in any degree criminal; but it is highly disagreeable and ridiculous in company, and ought most care∣fully to be avoided by whoever desires to please.</P>
<P>From this account of what you should not do, you may easily judge what you should do; and, a due attention to the manners of people of fa∣shion, and who have seen the world, will make it habitual and familiar to you.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="025064_0015_0FCE48461508EB10"/>There is, likewise, an awkwardness of expres∣sion and words most carefully to be avoided; such as false English, bad pronunciation, old sayings, and common proverbs; which are so many proofs of having kept bad and low com∣pany. For example: If instead of saying, that
<Q>tastes are different, and that every man has his own peculiar one,</Q>
you should let off a proverb, and say, that
<Q>what is one man's meat is another man's poison;</Q>
or else,
<Q>every one as they like, as the good man said when he kissed his cow;</Q>
every body would be per∣suaded that you had never kept company with any body above footmen and housemaids.</P>
<P>There is likewise an awkwardness of the mind, that ought to be, and with care may be avoided; as, for instance, to mistake or forget names. To speak of Mr. What-d'ye-call Him, or Mrs. Thingum, or How-d'ye call Hear, is excessively awkward and ordinary. To call people by im∣proper titles and appellations is so too; as, My Lord for Sir, and Sir for My Lord. To begin a story or a narration when you are not perfect in it, and cannot go through with it, but are forced, possibly, to say in the middle of it,
<Q>I have forgot the rest,</Q>
is very unpleasant and bungling. One must be extremely exact, clear, and perspicuous in every thing one says; other∣wise, instead of entertaining or informing others, one only tires and puzzles them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BASHFULNESS.</HEAD>
<P>BASHFULNESS is the distinguished character of an English booby, who appears fright∣ened out of his wits if people of fashion speak
<PB N="8" REF="025064_0016_0FCE48486FCFE9F8"/>
to him, and blushes and stammers without being able to give a proper answer; by which means he becomes truly ridiculous, from the groundless fear of being laughed at.</P>
<P>There is a very material difference between mo∣desty and an awkward bashfulness, which is as ridi∣culous as true modesty is commendable▪ it is as ab∣surd to be a simpleton as to be an impudent fellow; and we make ourselves contemptible, if we can∣not come into a room and speak to people without being out of countenance, or without embarrass∣ment. A man who is really diffident, timid, and bashful, be his merit what it will, never can push himself in the world; his despondency throws him into inaction, and the forward, the bustling, and the petulant, will always precede him. The manner makes the whole difference. What would be impudence in one man, is only a pro∣per and decent assurance in another. A man of sense, and of knowledge of the world, will assert his own rights, and pursue his own objects, as steadily and intrepidly as the most impudent man living, and commonly more so; but then he has art enough to give an outward air of mo∣desty to all he does. This engages and prevails, whilst the very same things shock and fail, from the over-bearing or impudent manner only of doing them.</P>
<P>Englishmen, in general, are ashamed of going into company. When we avoid singularity, what should we be ashamed of? And why should not we go into a mixed company with as much ease, and as little concern, as we would go into our own room? Vice and ignorance are the only things we ought to be ashamed of: while we keep clear of them, we may venture any where with∣out
<PB N="9" REF="025064_0017_0FCE484ADC797D60"/>
fear or concern. Nothing sinks a young man into low company so surely as bashfulness. If he thinks that he shall not, he most surely will not please.</P>
<P>Some, indeed, from feeling the pain and in∣conveniencies of bashfulness, have rushed into the other extreme, and turned impudent; as cowards sometimes grow desperate from excess of danger: but this is equally to be avoided, there be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng nothing more generally shocking than impu∣dence. The medium between these two extremes points out the well-bred man, who always feels him∣self firm and easy in all companies; who is modest without being bashful, and steady without being im∣pudent.</P>
<P>A mean fellow is ashamed and embarrassed when he comes into company, is disconcerted when spoken to, answers with difficulty, and does not know how to dispose of his hands; but a gentleman who is acquainted with the world, ap∣pears in company with a graceful and proper assurance, and is perfectly easy and unembar∣rassed. He is not dazzled by superior rank; he pays all the respect that is due to it, with∣out being disconcerted; and can converse as easily with a king as with any one of his subjects. This is the great advantage of being introduced young into good company, and of conversing with our superiors. A well-bred man will con∣vese with his inferiors without insolence, and with his superiors with respect, and with ease. Add to this, that a man of a gentleman like be∣haviour, though of inferior parts, is better re∣ceived than a man of superior abilities, who is unac∣quainted with the world. Modesty and a polite easy assurance should be united.</P>

<HEAD>COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>TO keep good company, especially at your first setting out is the way to receive good im∣pressions. Good company is not what respective sets of company are pleased either to call or think themselves. It consists chiefly (though not wholly) of people of considerable birth, rank, and cha∣racter; for people of neither birth nor rank are frequently and very justly admitted into it, if distinguished by any peculiar merit, or eminency in any liberal art or science. So motly a thing is good company, that many people, without birth, rank, or merit, intrude into it by their own forwardness, and others get into it by the protection of some considerable person. In this fashionable good company, the best manners and the purest language are most unquestionably to be learned: for they establish and give the TON to both, which are called the language and man∣ners of good company, neither of them being as∣certained by any legal tribunal.</P>
<P>A company of people of the first quality can∣not be called good company, in the common ac∣ceptation of the phrase, unless they are the fashi∣onable and accredited company of the place; for people of the first quality can be as silly, as ill-bred, and as worthless, as people of the meanest degree: and a company, consisting wholly of people of very low condition, what∣ever their merit or talents may be, can never be called good company; and therefore should not be much frequented, though by no means des∣pised.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="025064_0019_0FCE484DB469D8C0"/>A company wholly composed of learned men, though greatly to be respected, is not meant by the words <HI>good company</HI>: they cannot have the easy and polished manners of the world, as they do not live in it. If we can bear our parts well in such a company, it will be proper to be in it sometimes, and we shall be more esteemed in other companies for having a place in that.</P>
<P>A company consisting wholly of professed wits and poets, is very inviting to young men who are pleased with it, if they have wit themselves; and if they have none, are foolishly proud of being one of it. But such companies should be frequented with moderation and judgment. A wit is a very unpopular denomination, as it car∣ries terror along with it; and people are as much afraid of a wit in company as a woman is of a gun, which she supposes may go off of itself, and do her a mischief. Their acquaintance, however, is worth seeking, and their company worth fre∣quenting; but not exclusively of others, nor to such a degree as to be considered only as one of that parti∣cular set.</P>
<P>Above all things, endeavour to keep company with people above you; for there you rise, as much as you sink with people below you. When I say company above you, I do not mean with regard to their birth, but with regard to their merit, and the light in which the world considers them.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of good company; one which is called the BEAU MONDE, and consists of those people who have the lead in cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and in the gay part of life; the other consists of those who are distinguished by some peculiar merit, or
<PB N="12" REF="025064_0020_0FCE484EE411C7A8"/>
who excel in some particular or valuable art or science.</P>
<P>Be equally careful to avoid that low company which, in every sense of the word, is low indeed; low i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> rank, low in parts, low in manners, and low in merit. Vanity that source of many of our fol∣lies, and of some of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r crimes, has sunk many a man into company in every light infinitely below him, for the sake of being the first man in it. There he dictates, is applauded, and admired; but he soon disgraces himself, and disqualifies himself for any bet∣ter company.</P>
<P>Having thus pointed out what company you should avoid, and what company you should associate with, I shall next lay down a few CAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN ADOP∣TING THE MANNERS OF A COMPANY.</P>
<P>WHEN a young man, new in the world, first gets into company, he determine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to conform to and imitate it. But he too often mistakes the ob∣ject of his imitation. He has frequently heard the absurd term of genteel and fashionable vices. He there observes some people who shine, and who in general are admired and esteemed; and perceives that these people are rakes, drunkards, or gamesters; he therefore adopts their vices, mistaking their defects for their perfections, and imagining that they owe their fashion and their l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stre to these genteel vices. But it is exactly the reverse; for these people have acquired their reputation by their parts, their learning, their good-breeding, and other real accomplishments: and are only blemished and lowered in the opi∣nions
<PB N="13" REF="025064_0021_0FCE48545ECE71B0"/>
of all reasonable people by these general and fashionable vices. It is therefore plain that, in these mixed characters, the good part only makes people forgive, but not approve the bad.</P>
<P>If a man should, unfortunately, have any vices, he ought at least to be content with his own, and not adopt other people's. The adoption of vice has ruined ten times more young men, than natural inclinations.</P>
<P>Let us imitate the real perfections of the good company into which we may get; copy their po∣liteness, their carriage, their address, and the easy and well-bred turn of their conversation; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould remember, that, let them shine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ght, their vices, if they have any, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blemishes, which we should no more en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to imitate, than we would make arti∣ficial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts upon our faces, because some very handsome man had the misfortune to have a na∣tural one upon his. We should, on the contra∣ry, think how much handsomer he would have been without it.</P>
<P>Having thus given you instructions for making you well received in good company, I proceed next to lay before you, what you will find of equal use and importance in your commerce with the world, some directions, or</P>

<HEAD>Talking</HEAD>
<P>WHEN you are in company talk often, but never long; is that case, if you do not please, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> least you are sure not to tire your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earers.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="025064_0022_0FCE4855D938F478"/>
<HEAD>Learn the characters of company be∣fore you talk much.</HEAD>
<P>Inform yourself of the charac∣ters and situations of the compa∣ny, before you give way to what your imagination may prompt you to say. There are, in all compa∣nies, more wrong heads than right ones, and many more who deserve, than who like censure. Should you therefore expatiate in the praise of some virtue, which some in company notoriously want; or declaim against any vice, which others are notoriously infected with; your reflections, however general and unapplied, will, by being applicable, be thought personal, and level∣led at those people. This consideration points out to you sufficiently, not to be suspicious and captious yourself, nor to suppose that things, because they may, are therefore meant at you.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Telling sto∣ries and di∣gressions.</HEAD>
<P>Tell stories very seldom, and, absolutely, never but where they are very apt, and very short.— Omit every circumstance that is not material, and beware of digressions. To have frequent recourse to narrative, betrays great want of imagination.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Seizing peo∣ple by the but∣ton.</HEAD>
<P>Never hold any body by the button, or the hand, in order to be heard out; for, if people are not willing to hear you, you had much better hold your tongue than them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Long talk∣ers and whis∣perers.</HEAD>
<P>Long talkers generally single out some unfortunate man in compa∣ny to whisper, or at least, in a half voice, to convey a continuity
<PB N="15" REF="025064_0023_0FCE48572ED7C2A0"/>
of words to. This is excessively ill-bred, and, in some degree, a fraud; conversation-stock being a joint and common property But if one of these unmerciful talkers lays hold of you, hear him with patience (and at least seeming attention), i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he is worth obliging; for nothing will oblige him more than a patient hearing, as nothing wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld hurt him more than either to leave him in the midst of his discourse, or to discover your impa∣tience under your affliction.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Inattention to persons speaking.</HEAD>
<P>There is nothing so brutally shocking, nor so little forgiven, as a seeming inattention to the person who is speaking to you; and I have known many a man knocked down for a much slighter provocation than that inattention which I mean. I have seen many people, who, while you are speaking to them, instead of looking at, and attending to you, fix their eyes upon the ceiling, or some other part of the room, look out of the window, play with a dog, twirl their snuff-box, or pick their nose. Nothing discovers a little, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tile, frivolous mind more than this, and no∣thing is so offensively ill-bread: it is an explicit declaration on your part, that every the most trifling object deserves your attention more than all that can be said by the person who is speaking to you. Judge of the sentiments of hatred and resentment which such treatment must excite in every breast where any degree of self love dwells. I repeat it again and again, that sort of vanity and self love is inseparable from human nature, whatever may be its rank or condition; even your footman will sooner forget and forgive a beating, than any manifest mark of slight and
<PB N="16" REF="025064_0024_0FCE4858A8345FA8"/>
contempt. Be, therefore, not only really, but seeming and manifestly attentive to whoever speaks to you.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Never in∣terrupt any speaker.</HEAD>
<P>It is considered as the height of ill-manners to interrupt any person while speaking, by speaking your∣self, or calling off the attention of the company to any new subject. This, how∣ever, every child knows.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Adopt ra∣ther than give the subject.</HEAD>
<P>Take, rather than give, the sub∣ject of the company you are in. If you have parts, you will shew them, more or less, upon every sub∣ject; and if you have not, you had better talk sillily upon a subject of other people's than of your own chusing.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Conceal your learning from the company.</HEAD>
<P>Never display your learning, but on particular occasions. Reserve it for learned men; and let even these rather extort it from you, than appear forward to display it. Hence you will be deemed modest, and reputed to possess more knowledge than you really have. Never seem wiser or more learned than your company. The man who affects to display his learning, will be fre∣quently questioned; and, if found superficial, will be ridicu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and despised; if otherwise, he will be deemed a pedant. Nothing can lessen real merit (which will always shew itself) in the opinion of the world, but an ostentatious display of it by its possessor.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<PB N="17" REF="025064_0025_0FCE485D2AE2C280"/>
<HEAD>Contradict with polite∣ness.</HEAD>
<P>When you oppose or contradict any person's assertion or opinion, let your manner, your air, your terms, and your tone of voice be soft and gentle, and that easily and naturally, not affectedly. Use palliatives when you contradict; such as, "I may be mistaken, I am not sure, but I believe, I should rather think, &amp;c." Finish any argument or dispute with some little good-hu∣moured pleasantry, to shew that you are neither hurt yourself, nor meant to hurt your anta∣gonist; for an argument kept up a good while often occasions a temporary alienation on each side.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Avoid ar∣gument, if possible.</HEAD>
<P>Avoid, as much as you can, in mixed companies, argumenta∣tive, polemical conversations; which certainly indispose, for a time, the contending parties towards each other; and, if the controversy grows warm and noisy, endea∣vour to put an end to it by some genteel levity or joke.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Always de∣bate with tem∣per.</HEAD>
<P>Arguments should never be maintained with heat and cla∣mour, though we believe or know ourselves to be in the right; we should give our opinions modestly and coolly; and if that will not do, endeavour to change the conversation, by saying,
<Q>We should not be able to convince one another, nor is it neces∣sary that we should, so let us talk of something else.</Q></P>

<HEAD>Local pro∣priety to be observed.</HEAD>

<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Jokes, <HI>bons mots,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The jokes, <HI>bons mots,</HI> the little adventures, which may do very well in one company, will seem flat and tedious when related in another. The particular characters, the habits, the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of one company may give merit to a word, or a gesture, which would have none at all if divested of those accidental circumstances. Here people very com∣monly err; and fond of something that has en∣tertained them in one company, and in certain circumstances, repeat it with emphasis in another, where it is either insipid, or, it may be, offensive, by being ill-timed or misplaced. Nay, they of∣ten do it with silly preamble:
<Q>I will tell you an excellent thing;</Q>
or,
<Q>I will tell you the best thing in the world</Q>
This raises ex∣pectations, which, when absolutely disappointed, make the relator of this excellent thing look, very deservedly, like a fool.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Egotism.</HEAD>
<P>Upon all occasions avoid speak∣ing of yourself, if it be possible. Some, abruptly, speak advantageously of them∣selves, without either presence or provocation. This is downright impudence. Others proceed more artfully, as they imagine; forging accusa∣tions against themselves, and complaining of ca∣lumnies which they never heard, in order to jus∣tify themselves, and exhibit a catalogue of their many virtues.
<Q>They acknowledge, indeed,
<PB N="19" REF="025064_0027_0FCE48604347A920"/>
it may appear odd that they should talk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of themselves; it is what they have a great aversion to, and what they could not have do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, if they had not been thus unjustly and scan∣dalously abused.</Q>
This thin veil of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drawn before vanity, is much too transparent to conceal it, even from those who have but a modera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> share of penetration.</P>
<P>Others go to work more modes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ily still; they confess themselves guilty of all the cardinal virtues, by first degrading them into weaknesses, and then acknowledging their mis∣fortune in being made up of those weaknesses.
<Q>They cannot see people labouring under mis∣fortunes, without sympathizing with, and en∣deavouring to help them. They cannot see their fellow-creatures in distress without re∣lieving them; though, truly, their circumstan∣ces cannot very well afford it. They cannot avoid speaking the truth, though they acknow∣ledge it to be sometimes imprudent. In short, they confess that, with all these weaknesses, they are not fit to live in the world, much less to pros∣per in it. But they are now too old to pursue a contrary conduct, and therefore they must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ub on as well as they can.</Q></P>
<P>Though this may appear too ridiculous and <HI>outre</HI> even for the stage, yet it is frequently met with upon the common stage of the word. This principle of vanity and pride is so strong in hu∣man nature, that it descends even to the lowest objects; and we often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee people fishing for praise, where, admitting all they say to be true, no just praise is to be caught. One perhaps affirms, that he has rode post an hundred miles in six hours: probably, this is a falsehood; but, even
<PB N="20" REF="025064_0028_0FCE48632C903FB8"/>
supposing it to be true, what then? Why, it must be admitted that he is a very good post-boy, that is all. Another asserts, perhaps not without a few oaths, that he has drank six or eight bottles of wine at a sitting. It would be charitable to believe such a man a liar; for if we do not, we must certainly pronounce him a beast.</P>
<P>There are a thousand such follies and extrava∣gancies which vanity draws people into, and which always defeat their own purpose. The only method of avoiding these evils, is never to speak of ourselves. But when, in a narrative, we are obliged to mention ourselves, we should take care not to drop a single word that can di∣rictly or indirectly be construed as fishing for applause. Be our characters what they will, they will be known; and nobody will take them upon our own words. Nothing that we can say our∣selves will vanish our defects, or add lustre to our perfections; but on the contrary, it will often make the former more glaring, and the latter obscure. If we are silent upon our own merits, neither envy, indignation, nor ridicule will obstruct or allay the applause which we may really deserve. But, if we are our own panegy∣riste upon any occasion, however artfully dressed or disguised, every one will conspire against us, and we shall be disappointed of the very end we aim at.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>Be not dark or mysterious.</HEAD>
<P>Take care never to seem dark and mysterious; which is not only a very unamiable character, but a very suspicious one too: if you seem mysterious with others, they will be really so with you, and you will know nothing. The height of abilities
<PB N="21" REF="025064_0029_0FCE4864C6BE6CD8"/>
is to have a frank, open, and ingenous exte∣rior, with a prudent, and reserved interior; to be upon your own guard, and yet, by a seeming na∣tural openness, to put people off of theirs.

<DIV3 TYPE="rule">

In order to know people's real sentiments, I trust much more to my eyes than to my ears; for they can say what∣ever they have a mind I should hear; but they can seldom help looking what they have no intention that I should know.</P>

<HEAD>Never sup∣pose yourself the subject or laugh of the company.</HEAD>
<P>People of an ordinary, low edu∣cation, when they happen to fall into good company, imagine them∣selves the only object of its atten∣tion: if the company whispers, it is, to be sure, concerning them; if they laugh, it is at them; and if any thing am∣biguous, that by the most forced interpretation can be applied to them, happens to be said, they are convinced that it was meant at them; upon which they grow out of countenance first, and then angry. This mistake is very well ridiculed in the Stratagem, where Scrub says, "I am sure they talked of me, for they laughed consumedly." A well-bred man seldom thinks, but never seems to think himself slighted, undervalued, or laughed at in company, unless where it is so plainly marked out, that his honour obliges hm to resent it in a proper manner. On the contrary, a vulgar man

is captious and jealous; eager and impetuous about trifles. He suspects himself to be slighted; thinks every thing that is said meant at him; if the company happens to laugh, he is persuaded they laugh at him; he grows angry and testy, says something very impertinent, and draws himself into a scrape, by shewing what he calls a proper spirit, and asserting himself. The con∣versation of a vulgar man also always favours strongly of the lowness of his education and com∣pany. It turns chiefly upon his domestic affairs, his servants, the excellent order he keeps in his own family, and the little anecdotes of the neighbourhood; all which he relates with em∣phasis, as interesting matters.

<P>A FOOL squanders away, without credit or advantage to himself, more than a man of sense spends with both. The latter employs his money as he does his time, and never spends a shilling of the one, nor a minute of the other, but in something that is either useful or rationally pleasing to himself or others. The former buys whatever he does not want, and does not pay for what he does want. He cannot with∣stand

the charms of a toy-shop▪ snuff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>boxes, watch∣es, heads of canes, &amp;c. are his destruction.

<P>Without care and method, the largest fortune will not, and with them almost the smallest will supply all necessary expences. As far as you can possibly, pay ready money for every thing you buy, and avoid bills. Pay that money too yourself, and not through the hands of any servant; who always either stipulates poundage, or requires a present for his good word, as they call it. Where you must have bills (as for meat and drink, clothes, &amp;c.) pay them re∣gularly every month, and with your own hand. Ne∣ver from a mistaken economy, buy a thing you do not want, because it is cheap; or, from a silly pride because it is dear. Keep an account, in a book, of all that you receive, and of all that you pay; for no man who knows what he receives, and what he pays, ever runs out.

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG persons have commonly an unguarded frankness about them, which makes them the easy prey and bubbles of the artful and expe∣rienced: they look upon every knave or fool who tells them that he is their friend, to be really so; and pay that profession of simulated friendship with an indiscreet and unbounded confidence, always to their loss, often to their ruin. Beware of these proffered friendships. Receive them with great civility, but with great incredulity too; and pay them with compliments, but not with confidence. Do not suppose that people become friends at first sight, or even upon a short acquaint∣ance. Real friendship is a slow grower; and never thrives, unless ingrafted upon a stock of known and reciprocal merit.</P>
<P>There is another kind of nominal friendship among young people, which is warm for the time, but luckily of short duration. This friend∣ship is hastily produced, by their being acciden∣tally thrown together, and pursuing the same course of riot and debauchery. A fine friend∣ship, truly! and well cemented by drunkenness and lewdness. It should rather be called a con∣spiracy against morals and good manners, and be punished as such by the civil magistrate. How∣ever, they have the impudence and the folly to call this confederacy a friendship. They lend one another money for bad purposes; they en∣gage in quarrels, offensive and defensive, for their accomplices; they tell one another all they know, and often more too; when of a sudden,
<PB N="28" REF="025064_0036_0FCE487228DFA750"/>
some accident disperses them, and they think no more of each other, unless it be to betray and laugh at their imprudent confidence.</P>
<P>When a man uses strong protestations or oaths to make you believe a thing, which is of itself so probable that the bare saying of it would be sufficient, depend upon it he deceives you, and is highly interested in making you believe it, or else he would not take so much pains.</P>
<P>Remember to make a great difference between companions and friends; for a very complaisant and agreeable companion may, and often does, prove a very improper and a very dangerous friend. People will, in a great degree, form their opinion of you, upon that which they have of your friends; and there is a Spanish pro∣verb, which says very justly,
<Q>Tell me who you live with, and I will tell you who you are.</Q>
One may fairly suppose, that a man who makes a knaves or a fool his friend, has some thing very bad to do, or to conceal. But at the same time that you carefully decline the friendship of knaves and fools, if it can be called friendship, there is no occasion to make either of them your enemies, wantonly and un∣provoked; for they are numerous bodies; and I would rather chuse a secure neutrality, than alli∣ance or war with either of them. You may be a declared enemy to their vices and follies, without being marked out by them as a personal one. Their enmity is the next dangerous thing to their friendship. Have a real reserve with almost every body; and have a seeming reserve with al∣most nobody; for it is very disagreeable to seem reserved, and very dangerous not to be so. Few people find the true medium: many are ridicu∣lously

mysterious and reserved upon trifles; and many imprudently communicative of all they know.</P>

<HEAD>GOOD-BREEDING.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD-BREEDING has been very justly de∣fined to be
<Q>the result of much good-sense, some good-nature, and a little self-denial for the sake of others, and with a view to obtain the same indulgence from them.</Q></P>
<P>Good-breeding alone can prepossess people in our favour at first sight; more time being neces∣sary to discover greater talents. Good-breeding, however, does not consist in low bows and formal ceremony; but in an easy, civil, and respectful be∣haviour.</P>
<P>Indeed, good-sense in many cases must deter∣mine good-breeding; for what would be civil at one time, and to one person, would be rude at another time, and to another person; there are, however, some general rules of good-breeding. As for example: To answer only Yes, or No, to any person, without adding, Sir, My Lord, or Madam (as it may happen), is always ex∣tremely rude; and it is equally so not to give proper attention and a civil answer when spoken to: such behaviour convinces the person who is speaking to us, that we despise him, and do not think him worthy of our attention, or an an∣swer.</P>
<P>A well-bred person will take care to answer with complaisance when he is spoken to; will place himself at the lower end of the table, un∣less
<PB N="30" REF="025064_0038_0FCE48782C7FF7C0"/>
bid to go higher; will first drink to the lady of the house, and then to the master; he will not eat awkwardly or dirtily, nor sit when other stand; and he will do all this with an air of complaisance, and not with a grave ill natured look, as if he did it all unwillingly.</P>
<P>There is nothing more difficult to attain, or so necessary to possess, as perfect good-breeding; which is equally inconsistent with a stiff formality, an impertinent forwardness, and an awkward bashfulness. A little ceremony is sometimes ne∣cessary; a certain degree of firmness is absolutely so; and an outward modesty is extremely be∣coming.</P>
<P>Virtue and learning, like gold, have their in∣trinsic value; but if they are not polished, they certainly lose a great deal of their lustre; and even polished brass will pass upon more people than rough gold. What a number of sins does the chearful, easy, good-breeding of the French fre∣quently cover!</P>
<P>My Lord Bacon says,
<Q>That a pleasing figure is a perpetual letter of recommendation.</Q>
It is certainly an agreeable sore-runner of merit and smooths the way for it.</P>
<P>A man of good-breading should be acquainted with the forms and particular customs of courts. At Vienna, men always make curtsies, instead of bows, to the Emperor: in France, nobody bows to the King, or kisses his hand; but in Spain and England, bows are made, and hands are kissed. Thus every court has some peculiarity, which those who visit them ought previously to inform themselves of, to avoid blund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs and awkward∣nesses.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="025064_0039_0FCE4879A6680030"/>Very few, scarcely any, are wanting in the respect which they should shew to those whom they acknowledge to be infinitely their superiors. The man of fashion, and of the world, expresses it in its fullest extent; but naturally, easily, and without concern: whereas a man who is not used to keep good company, expresses it awkwardly; one sees that he is not used to it, and that it costs him a great deal: but I never saw the worst-bred man living guilty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olling, whistling, scratching his head, and such like indecencies in company that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> respected. In such companies, therefore, the only point to be attended to is to shew that respect which every body means to shew, in an easy, unembarrass∣ed, and graceful manner.</P>
<P>In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make part of them, is, for the time at least, supposed to be upon a footing of equality with the rest; and consequently, every one claims, and very justly, every mark of civility and good-breeding. Ease is allowed, but carelessness and negligence are strictly forbidden. If a man ac∣costs you, and talks to you ever so dully or fri∣volously, it is worse than rudeness, it is bruta∣lity, to shew him, by a manifest inattention to what he says, that you think him a fool or a blockhead, and not worth hearing. It is much more so with regard to women; who, of what∣ever rank they are, are intitled, in consideration of their sex, not only to an attentive, but an offi∣cious good-breeding from men. Their little wants, likings, dislikes, preferences, antipathies, fancies, whims, and even impertinencies, must be officiously attended to, flattered, and, if pos∣sible, guessed at and anticipated by a well-bred man. You must never usurp to yourself those
<PB N="32" REF="025064_0040_0FCE487B25584D80"/>
conveniencies and <HI>agremens</HI> which are of com∣mon right; such as the best places, the best dishes, &amp;c. but, on the contrary, always decline them yourself, and offer them to others; who, in their turns, will offer them to you; so that, upon the whole, you will, in your turn, enjoy your share of common right.</P>
<P>The third sort of good-breeding is local, and is variously modified in not only different coun∣tries, but in different towns of the same country. But it must be founded upon the two former sorts▪ they are the matter, to which, in this case, fashion and custom only give the different shapes and impressions. Whoever has the first two sorts will easily acquire this third sort of good-breed∣ing, which depends singly upon attention and observation. It is properly the polish, the lustre, the last finishing strokes of good-breeding. A man of sense, therefore, carefully attends to the local manners of the respective places where he is, and takes for his models those persons whom he observes to be at the head of the fashion and good-breeding. He watches how they address themselves to their superiors, how they accost their equals and how they treat their inferiors; and lets none of those little niceties escape him, which are to good-breading what the last delicate and masterly touches are to a good picture, and which the vulgar have no notion of, but by which good judges distinguish the master. He attends even to their air, dress, and motions, and imitates them liberally, and not fervilely: he copies, but does not mimic. These personal graces are of very great consequence. They anticipate the sentiments before merit can engage the under∣standing; they captivate the heart, and give rise.
<PB N="33" REF="025064_0041_0FCE487FDE937808"/>
I believe, to the extravagant notions of Charms and Philtres. Their effects were so surprising, that they were reckoned supernatural.</P>
<P>In short, as it is necessary to possess learning, honour, and virtue, to gain the esteem and admi∣ration of mankind, so politeness and good-breeding are equally necessary to render us agreeable in con∣versation and common life. Great talents are above the generality of the world, who neither possess them themselves, nor are competent judges of them in others: but all are judges of the lesser talents, such as civility, affability, and an agreeable address and manner; because they feel the good effects of them, as making society easy and agreeable.</P>
<P>To conclude: be assured that the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> learning, without good-breeding, is unwelcome and tiresome pedantry; that a man who is not perfect∣ly well-bred is unfit for good company, and unwel∣come in it; and that a man who is not well-bred is full as unfit for business as for company.</P>
<P>Make then good-breeding the great object of your thoughts and actions. Observe carefully the behaviour and manners of those who are distinguish∣ed by their good-breeding: imitate, nay, endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to excel, that you may at least reach them; and be convinced that good-breeding is to all worldly quali∣fications, what charity is to all christian virtues.

<HEAD>Art of pleasing.</HEAD>
<P>THE desire of pleasing is at least half the art of doing it; the rest depends only upon the man∣ner, which attention, observation, and frequent∣ing good company will teach. Those who are lazy, careless, and indifferent whether they please or not, we may depend upon it, will never please. The art of pleasing is a very necessary one to pos∣sess, but a very difficult one to acquire. To do as one would be done by, is the surest method of pleasing. Observe carefully what pleases us in others, and probably the same things in us will please others. If we are pleased with the com∣plaisance and attention of others to our humours, our tastes, or our weaknesses; the same complai∣sance and attention on our parts to theirs, will equally please them. Let us be serious, gay, or even trifling, as we find the present humour of the company: this is an attention due from every individual to the majority. The art of pleasing cannot be reduced to a receipt; if it could, that receipt would be worth purchasing at any price. Good sense and good-nature are the principal in∣gredients; and our own observation, and the good advice of others, must give the right colour and taste to it.</P>
<P>The graces of the person, the countenance, and the way of speaking, are essential things: the very same thing said by a genteel person in an en∣gaging way, and gracefully and distinctly spoken, would please; which would shock if muttered out by an aukward figure, with a sullen serious
<PB N="35" REF="025064_0043_0FCE4882A7AF2A18"/>
countenance. The Poets represent Venus as at∣tended by the Three Graces, to intimate, that even beauty will not do without. Minerva ought to have three also; for, without them, learning has few at∣tractions.</P>
<P>If we examine ourselves seriously, why parti∣cular people please and engage us more than others of equal merit, we shall always find, that it is because the former have the Graces, and the latter not. I have known many a woman, with an exact shape, and a symmetrical assemblage of beautiful features, please nobody; while others, with very moderate shapes and features, have charmed every body. It is certain that Venus will not charm so much without her attendant Graces, as they will without her. Among men, how often has the most solid merit been neglect∣ed, unwelcome, or even rejected for want of them! while slimsy parts, little knowledge, and less me∣rit, introduced by the Graces, have been received, cherished, and admired!</P>
<P>We proceed now to investigate what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Graces are, and to give some instructions for acquiring them.</P>

<HEAD>Address.</HEAD>
<P>A man's fortune is frequently decided for ever by his first ad∣dress. If it is pleasing, people are burried invo∣luntarily into a persuasion that he has a merit, which possibly he has not; as, on the other hand, if it is ungraceful, they are immediately preju∣diced against him; and unwilling to allow him the merit which, it may be, he has. The worst bred man in Europe, should a Lady drop her fan, would certainly take it up and give it to her: the best bred man in Europe could do no more.
<PB N="36" REF="025064_0044_0FCE4884318D5168"/>
The difference, however▪ would be considerable: the latter would please by his graceful ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess in presenting it; the former would be laughed at for doing it awkwardly. The carriage of a gen∣tleman should be genteel, and his motions grace∣ful. He should be particularly careful of his manner and address, when he presents himself in company. Let them be respectful without mean∣ness, easy without too much familarity, genteel, without affectation, and insinuating without any seeming art or design. Men, as well as women, are much oftener led by their hearts than by their understandings. The way to the heart is through the senses; please their eyes and their ears, and the work is half done.</P>

<HEAD>Choice of amusements.</HEAD>
<P>A gentleman always attends even to the <HI>choice</HI> of his amuse∣ments. If at cards, he will not play at cribbage, all-fours, or putt; or, in sports of exercise, be seen at skittles, foot-ball, leap-frog, cricket, driving of coaches, &amp;c. for he knows that such an imitation of the manners of the mob will indelibly stamp him with vulgari∣ty. I cannot likewise avoid calling playing upon any musical instrument illiberal in a gentleman. Music is usually reckoned one of the liberal arts, and not unjustly; but a man of fashion who is seen piping or fiddling at a concert degrades his own dignity. If you love music, hear it; pay fiddlers to play to you, but never fiddle yourself. It makes a gentleman appear frivolous and con∣temptible, leads him frequently into b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d company, and wastes that time which might otherwise be well employed.</P>

<P>Study to acquire that fashiona∣ble kind of <HI>small-talk,</HI> or <HI>chit-chat,</HI> which prevails in all polite assemblies, and which, trifling as it appear, is of use in mixed com∣panies, and at table.

Upon such occasions, likewise, it is not amiss to know how to <HI>parler cuisinae,</HI> and to be able to dissert upon the growth and flavour of wines.

<P>The person should be accurate∣ly clean; the teeth, hands, and nails, should be particularly so; a dirty mouth has real ill consequences to the owner, for it in∣fallibly causes the decay, as well as the intolerable pain of the teeth; and is very offensive, for it will most in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vitably stink. Nothing looks more ordinary, vulgar, and illiberal, than dirty hands, and ugly, uneven, and ragged nails; the ends of which should be kept smooth and clean (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tip∣ped with black), and small segments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; and every time that the hands are wiped, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ub the skin round the the nails backwards, that it may not grow up, and shorten them too much. Upon no account whatever put your fingers in your nose or ears. It is the most shocking, nasty, vulgar rudeness that can be offered to company.

<P>These things may perhaps appear too insignifi∣cant to be mentioned; but when it is remembered that a thousand little nameless things, which every one feels but no one can describe, conspire to form that <HI>whole</HI> of pleasing. I think we ought not to call them trifling. Besides, a clean shirt and a clean person are as necessary to health as not to offend other people.

his countenance and his tone of voce, for they all conspire in the main point of pleasing. There is a certain distinguishing diction of a man of fashion: he will not content himself with saying, like John Trott, to a new married man,
<Q>Sir, I wish you much joy;</Q>
or to a man who has lost his son, "Sir, I am sorry for your loss;" and both with a countenance equally unmoved▪ but he will say in effect the same thing, in a more elegant and less trivial manner, and with a coun∣tenance adapted to the occasion. He will advance with warmth, vivacity, and a chearful counte∣nance, to the new-married man, and embracing him, perhaps say to him,
<Q>If you do justice to my attachment to you, you will judge of the joy that I feel upon this occasion, better than I can express it, &amp;c.</Q>
To the other in affliction he will advance slowly, with a grave composure of countenance, in a more deliberate manner, and with a lower voice perhaps say,

<HEAD>Dress and dancing.</HEAD>
<P>Dress is one of the various in∣gredients that contribute to the art
<PB N="40" REF="025064_0048_0FCE488B0F30D310"/>
of pleasing, and therefore an object of some at∣tention; for we cannot help forming some opi∣nion of a man's sense and character from his dress. All affectation in dress implies a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>law in the understanding. Men of sense carefully avoid any particular character in their dress; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e accurately clean for their own sake, but all the rest is for the sake of other people. A man should dress as well, and in the same manner, as the peo∣ple of sense and fashion of the place where he is: if he dresses more than they, he is a fop: if he dresses less, he is unpardonably negligent: but of the two, a young fellow should be rather too much than too little dressed; the excess of that side will wear off, with a little age and reflec∣tion.</P>
<P>The differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce in dress between a man and a fop is, that the fop values himself upon his dress; and the man of sense laughs at it, at the same time that he knows he must not neglect it: there are a thou∣sand foolish customs of this kind, which, as they are not criminal, must be complied with, and even chearfully, by men of sense. Diogenes the Cynic was a wise man for despising them, but a fool for shewing it.</P>
<P>We should not attempt to rival, or to excel a fop in dress; but it is necessary to dress, to avoid singularity and ridicule. Great care should be taken to be always dressed like the reasonable people of our own age in the place where we are, whose dress is never spoken of one way or another, as neither too negligent, or too much studied.</P>
<P>Awkwardness of carriage is very alienating, and a total negligence of dress and air, an im∣pertinent insult upon custom and fashion. Women
<PB N="41" REF="025064_0049_0FCE367BF52A88E0"/>
have great influence as to a man's fashionable cha∣racter; and an awkward man will never have their votes, which are very numerous, and oftener counted than weighed.</P>
<P>When we are once well-dressed for the day, we should think no more of it afterwards; and, without any stiffness for fear of discomposing that dress, we should be as easy and natural as if we had no cloaths on at all.</P>
<P>Dancing, likewise, though a silly trifling thing, is one of those established follies which people of sense are sometimes obliged to conform to; and if they do, they should be able to perform it well.</P>
<P>In dancing, the motion of the arms should be particularly attended to, as these decide a man's being genteel or otherwise, more than any other part of the body. A twist or stiffness in the wrist will make any man look awkward. If a man dances well from the waist upwards, wears his hat well, and moves his head properly, he dan∣ces well. Coming into a room and presenting yourself to a company should be also attended to, as this always gives the first impression, which is often indelible. Those who present themselves well, have a certain dignity in their air, which, without the least seeming mixture of pride, at once engages and is respected.</P>

Little minds are in a hurry, when the object proves (as it com∣monly does) too big for them; they run, they heat, they puzzle, confound, and perplex them∣selves; they want to do every thing at once, and never do it at all. But a man of sense takes the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime necessary for doing the thing he is about well.</P>

<HEAD>Laughter.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> there is nothing so illiberal, and so ill-bred, as audible laughter. True wit or sense never yet made and body laugh; they are above it; they please the mind, and give a chearfulness to the countenance. But it is low buffoonery, or silly accidents, that always excite laughter; and that is what people of sense and breed∣ing should shew themselves above. A man's going to sit down, in the supposition that he has a chair behind him, and falling down upon his breech for want of one, sets a whole company a laughing, when all the wit in the world would not do it; a plain proof, in my mind, how low and unbecoming a thing laughter is; not to mention the disagreeable noise that it makes, and the shocking distortion of the face that it occasions.</P>
<P>Many people, at first from awkwardness, have got a very disagreeable and silly trick of laughing whenever they speak: and I know men of very good parts, who cannot say the commonest thing without laughing; which makes those who do not know them take them at first for natural fools.</P>

<P>There is nothing that a young man at his first appearance in the world has more reason to dread, and therefore should take more pains to avoid, than having any ridicule fixed on him.

<HEAD>Pronuncia∣tion in speak∣ing.</HEAD>
<P>To acquire a graceful utterance, read aloud to some friend every day, and beg of him to interrupt and correct you whenever you read too fast, do not observe the proper stops, lay a wrong emphasis, or utter your words unintelligi∣bly. You may even read aloud to yourself, and tune your utterance to your own ear. Take care to open your teeth when you read or speak, and articulate every word distinctly; which last cannot be done but by sounding the final letter. But above all, study to vary your voice according to the sub∣ject, and avoid a monotony. Daily attention to these articles will, in a little time, render them easy and habitual to you.</P>
<P>The voice and manner of speaking, too, are not to be neglected; some people almost shut their mouths when they speak, and mutter so that they are not be understood; others speak so fast, and sputter, that they are not to be understood neither: some always speak as loud as if they were talking to deaf people; and others so low, that one cannot hear them. All these habits are awk∣ward and disagreeable, and are to be avoided by attention; they are the distinguishing marks of the ordinary people, who have had no care taken of their education. You cannot imagine how necessary it is to mind all these little things; for I have seen many people, with great talents, ill-received for the want of having these talents; and

<P>Orthography, or spelling well, is so absolutely necessary for a man of letters, or a gentleman, that one false spelling may fix a ridicule on him for the remainder of his life.

Sometimes words, indeed, are spelle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly by different authors, but those instances are rare; and where there is only one way of spelling a word, should you spell it wrong, you will be sure to be ridiculed.

It is not every understanding that can judge of mat∣ter; but every ear can an does judge, more or less, of style.</P>
<P>Mind your diction, in whatever language you either write or speak; contract a habit of correctness and eligance. Consider your style, even in the freest conversation, and most familiar letters.

<HEAD>Vulgar ex∣pressions.</HEAD>
<P>Vulgarism in language is a cer∣tain characteristic of bad company, and a bad education. Proverbial expressions, and trite sayings, are the flowers of the rhetoric of a vulgar man.

If any body attempts being <HI>smart,</HI> as he calls it, upon him; he gives them <HI>tit for tat,</HI> aye, that he does.

<HEAD>Cautions against sundry odd habits.</HEAD>
<P>Humming a tune within our∣selves, drumming with our fin∣gers, making a noise with our feet, and such awkward habits, being all breaches of good manners are therefore indi∣cations of our contempt for the persons present, and consequently should not be practised.</P>
<P>Eating very quick, or very slow, is cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cter∣istic of vulgarity: the former infers poverty; the latter, if abroad, that you are disguested with your entertainment; and if at home, that you are rude enough to give your friends what you cannot eat yourself. Eating soup with your nose in the plate is also vulgar. So likewise is smelling to the meat while on the fork, before you put it in your mouth. If you dislike what is sent upon your plate, leave it; but never by smelling to, or examining it, appear to tax your friend with placing unwholesome provisions before you.</P>
<P>Spitting on the floor or carpet is a filthy prac∣tice, and which, were it to become general, would render it as necessary to change the carpets as the table-cloths; not to add, it will induce our ac∣quaintance to suppose, that we have not been used to genteel furniture; for which reason alone, if for no other, a man of liberal education should avoid it.</P>
<P>To conclude this article: Never walk fast in the streets, which is a mark of vulgarity, ill-befitting

<P>To stare any person full in the face, whom you chance to meet, is an act also of ill-breeding; it would seem to bespeak as if you saw something wonderful in his appearance, and is therefore a tacit reprehension.</P>
<P>Keep yourself free likewise from all odd tricks or habits; such as scratching yourself, putting your fingers to your mouth, nose, and ears, thrusting out your tongue, snapping your fingers biting your nails, rubbing your hands, sighing aloud, an affected shi∣vering of your body, gaping, and many others, which I have noticed before; all which are imitations of the manners of the mob, and degrading to a gentle∣man.</P>

<HEAD>KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>WE should endeavour to hoard up, while we are young, a great stock, of knowledge; for though during that time of dissipation we may not have occasion to spend much of it, yet a time will come when we shall want it to maintain us.</P>
<P>The knowledge of the world is only to be ac∣quired in the world, and not in a closet. Books alone will never teach it you; but they will sug∣gest many things to your observation, which might otherwise escape you; and your own obser∣vations upon mankind, when compared with those which you will find in books, will help you to fix the true point.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="025064_0058_0FCE48A175C38108"/>To know mankind well▪ requires full as much attention and application as to know books, and it may be, more sagacity and discernment. I am at this time acquainted with many elderly people, who have all passed their whole lives in the great world, but with such levity and inatten∣tion, that they know no more of it now than they did at fifteen. Do not flatter yourself, therefore, with the thoughts that you can acquire this know∣ledge in the frivolous chit-chat of idle compa∣nies; no, you must go much deeper than that, You must look into people as well as at them. Search, therefore, with the greatest care, into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> character of all those whom you converse with; endeavour to discover their predominant pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons, their prevailing weaknesses, their vanities, their follies, and their humours; with all the right and wrong, wise and silly springs of human actions, which make such inconsistent and whimsical beings of us ra∣tional creatures.</P>
<P>There are no persons so insignificant and incon∣siderable, but may, some time or other, and in something or other, have it in their power to be of use to you; which they certainly will not, if you have once shewn them contempt. Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt never is. Our pride remembers it for ever. Remember, there∣fore, most carefully to conceal your contempt, however just, wherever you would not make an implacable enemy. Men are much more unwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ling to have their weaknesses and there imperfec∣tions known, than their crimes; and if you hint to a man that you think him silly, ignorant, or even ill-bred or awkward, he will hate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u more, and lon∣ger, than if you tell him plainly that you think him a rogue.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="025064_0059_0FCE48A2E53928D8"/>Nothing is more insulting than to take pains to make a man feel a mortifying inferiority in know∣ledge, rank, fortune, &amp;c. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, it is both ill-bred and ill-natured, and in the two latter articles it is unjust, they not being in his power. Good-breeding and good-nature incline us rather to raise people up to ourselves, than to mortify and dress them. Besides, it is making ourselves so many friends, instead of so many enemies. A constant attention to please, is a most necessary ingredient in the art of pleasing: it flatters the self-love of those to whom it is shewn; it engages and captivates, more than things of much greater importance. Every man is, in some mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, obliged to discharge the so∣cial duties of life; but these attentions are volun∣tary acts, the free-will offering of good-breeding and good nature; they are received, remembered, and returned as such. Women, in particular, have a right to them; and any omission in that respect is downright ill-breeding.</P>
<P>We should never yield to that temptation, which to most young men is very strong, of ex∣posing other people's weaknesses and infirmities, for the sake either of diverting the company, or of shewing our own superiority. We may, by that means, get the laugh on our side so, the present, but we shall make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemies by it for ever; and even those who laugh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on reflection, fear and dispise is: it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and a good heart desires rather to conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han expose other peoples weaknesses or misfortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ If we have wit, we should use it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> please, and not to hurt: we may shine, like the sun in the Temperate Zones, without scorching.</P>

The spirits and vivacity of youth are apt to neglect them as useless, or reject them as troublesome; but subsequent knowledge and experience of the world remind us of their importance, commonly when it is too late.

This may be difficult, but it is by no means impossible; and as a man of sense never attempts impossibi∣lities on one hand, on the other he is never dis∣couraged by difficulties: on the contrary, he re∣doubles his industry and his diligence; he per∣severes, and infallibly prevails at last. In any point which prudence bids you p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsue, and which a manifest utility attends, let difficulties only animate your industry, not deter you from the pursuit.

<P>In order to judge of the inside of others, study your own; for men in general are very much alike; and though one has one prevailing passion, and another has another, yet their operations are much the same; and whatever engages or disgusts, pleases or offends you in others, will <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> engage, disgust, please, or offend o∣thers, in you.

nature of your passions, and the various motives that determine your will; and you may, in a great degree, know all mankind. For instance: do you find yourself hurt and mortified, when another makes you feel his superiority, and your own inferiority, in knowledge, parts, rank, or fortune? you will certainly take great care not to make a person whose good will, good word, interest, esteem, or friendship you would gain, feel that superiority in you, in case you have it.

they be so plain that you cannot be supposed igno∣rant of their meaning, to join in the laugh of the company against yourself, acknowledge the hit to be a fair one, and the jest a good one, and play of the whole thing in seeming good-humour; but by no means reply in the same way; which only shews that you are hurt, and publishes the victory which you might have concealed. Should the thing said, indeed injure your honour or moral character, remember there are but two alternatives for a gentleman and a man of parts— extreme politeness, or a duel.</P>
<P>If a man notoriously and designedly insults and affronts you, knock him down; but if he only injures you, your best revenge is to be extremely civil to him in your outward behaviour, though at the same time you counterwork him, and re∣turn him the compliment, perhaps with intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, This is not perfidy or dissimulation: it would be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if you were, at the same time, to make professions of esteem and friendship to this man; which I by no means recommend, but, on the contrary, abhor.

<Q>that they must own you have behaved yourself very handsomely in the whole affair.</Q></P>
<P>In short, let this be one invariable rule of your conduct: Never to shew the least symptom of re∣sentment, which you cannot, to a certain degree, gratify; but always to smile where you cannot strike. There would be no living in the world, if one could not conceal, and even dissemble the just causes of resentment, which one meets with every day in an active and busy life. Whoever cannot master his humour, should leave the world, and retire to some hermitage in an unfrequented desart. By shewing an unavailing and sullen re∣sentment, you authorize the resentment of those who can hurt you, and whom you cannot hurt; and give them that very pretence, which perhaps they wished for, of breaking with and injuring you; whereas the contrary behaviour would lay them under the restraints of decency at least, and either shackle or expose their malice. Besides, cap∣tiousness, sullenness, and pouting, are most exceed∣ingly illiberal and vulgar.</P>
<P>Though men are all of one composition, the several ingredients are so differently proportioned in each individual, that no two are exactly alike; and no one, at all times, like himself. The ablest man will, sometimes, do weak things; the proudest man, mean things; the honest man, ill things; and the wickedest man, good things. Study individuals then, and if you take (as you ought to do) their outlines from their prevailing passion, suspend your last finishing strokes till you have attended to and have discovered the opera∣tions of their inferior passions, appetites, and
<PB N="57" REF="025064_0065_0FCE48AEE9D60988"/>
humours. A man's general character may be that of the honest man in the world; do not dispute it; you might be thought envious or ill-natured; but, at the same time, do not take this probity upon trust, to such a degree as to put your life, fortune, or reputation in his power. This honest man may happen to be your rival in power, in interest, or love; three passions that often put honesty to most severe trials, in which it is too often cast; but first analyse this honest man your∣self, and then only you will be able to judge, how far you may, or may not, with safety trust him.</P>
<P>If you would particularly gain the affection and friendship of particular people, whether men or women, endeavour to find out their predomi∣nant excellency, if they have one, and their pre∣vailing weakness, which every body has; and do justice to the one, and something more than jus∣tice to the other. Men have various objects in which they may excel, or at least would be thought to excel; and though they love to hear justice done to them where they know that they excel, yet they are most and best flattered upon those points where they with to excel, and yet are doubt∣ful whether they do or not. As for example: Cardinal Richelieu, who was undoubtedly the ablest statesman of his time, or perhaps of any other, had the idle vanity of being thought the best poet too; he envied the great Corneille his reputation, and ordered a criticism to be written upon the <HI>Cid.</HI> Those, therefore, who flattered skilfully, said little to him of his abilities in state affairs, or at least but <HI>en pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt,</HI> and as it might naturally occur. But the incense which they gave him, the smoke of which they knew would
<PB N="58" REF="025064_0066_0FCE48B0DB9E6388"/>
turn his head in their favour, was as a <HI>bel esprit</HI> and a poet. Why? Because he was sure of one excel∣lency, and distrustful as to the other.</P>
<P>You will easily discover every man's prevailing vanity, by observing his favourite topic of con∣versation; for every man talks most of what he has most a mind to be thought to excel in. Touch him but there, and you touch him to the quick.</P>
<P>Women have in general but one object, which is their beauty; upon which scarce any flattery is too gross for them to swallow. Nature has hardly formed a woman ugly enough to be in∣sensible to flattery upon her person; if her face is so shocking, that she must, in some degree, be conscious of it, her figure and her air, she trusts, makes ample amends for it. If her figure is deformed, her face, she thinks, counterba∣lances it. If they are both bad, she comforts herself that she has graces; a certain manner; a <HI>je ne s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ais quoi,</HI> still more engaging than beauty. This truth is evident from the studied and ela∣borate dress of the ugliest women in the world. An undoubted, uncontested, conscious beauty is, of all women, the least sensible of flattery upon that head; she know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is her due, and is therefore obliged to nobody for giving it her. She must be flattered upon her understanding; which though she may possibly not doubt of herself, yet she suspects that men may distrust.</P>
<P>Do not mistake me, and think that I mean to recommend to you abject and criminal flattery: no, flatter nobody's vices or crimes; on the con∣trary, abhor and discourage them. But there is no living in the world without a complaisant in∣dulgence for people's weaknesses, and innocent
<PB N="59" REF="025064_0067_0FCE48B1F752C7E0"/>
though ridiculous vanities. If a man has a mind to be thought wiser, and a woman handsomer than they really are, their error is a comfortable one to themselves, and an innocent one with re∣gard to other people; and I would rather make them my friends, by indulging them in it, than my enemies, by endeavouring (and that to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o purpose) to undeceive them.</P>
<P>Suspect, in general, those who remarkably af∣fect any one virtue; who raise it above all others, and who, in a manner, intimate that they possess it exclusively. I say, suspect them; for they are commonly impostors: but do not be sure that they are always so; for I have sometimes known Saints really religious, Blusterers really brave, Reformers of manners really honest, and Prudes really chaste. Pry into the recesses of their hearts yourself, as far as you are able, and never im∣plicitly adopt a character upon common fame; which, though generally right as to the great outlines of characters, is always wrong in some par∣ticulars.</P>
<P>Be upon your guard against those who, upon very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>light acquaintance, obtrue their unasked and unmerited friendship and confidence upon you; for they probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ram you with them only for their own eating; but at the same time do not roughly reject them upon that general supposi∣tion. Examine further, and see whether those unexpected offers flow from a warm heart and a silly head, or from a designing head and a cold heart; for knavery and folly have often the same symptoms. In the first case, there is no danger in accepting them—<HI>valeant quantum valere pussunt.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the latter case, it may be useful to accept them,
<PB N="60" REF="025064_0068_0FCE48B3C37E5D08"/>
and artfully to turn the battery upon him who raised it.</P>
<P>If a man uses strong oaths or protestations to make you believe a thing which is of itself so likely and probable that the bare saying of it would be suffi∣cient, depend upon it he lies, and is highly interest∣ed in making you believe it; or else he would not take so much pains.</P>
<P>There is an incontinency of friendship among young fellows, who are associated by their mu∣tual pleasures only, which has, very frequently, bad consequences. A parcel of warm hearts and unexperienced heads, heated by convivial mirth, and possibly a little too much wine, vow, and really mean at the time, eternal friendships to each other, and indiscreetly pour out their whole souls in common, and without the least reserve. The confidences are as indiscreetly repealed as they were made; for new pleasures and new places soon dissolve this ill cemented connection, and then very ill uses are made of these rash confi∣dences. Bear your part, however, in young companies; nay, exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if you can, in all the social and convivial joy and festivity that become youth. Trust them with your love-tales, if you please; but keep your serious views secret. Trust those only to some tried friend, more experienced than yourself, and who, being in a different walk of life from you, is not likely to become your rival; for I would not advise you to depend so much upon the heroic virtue of mankind, as to hope, or believe, that your competitor will ever be your friend, as to the object of that compe∣tition.</P>
<P>A seeming ignorance is very often a most ne∣cassary part of worldly knowledge. It is, for in∣stance,
<PB N="61" REF="025064_0069_0FCE48B4E24B2108"/>
commonly adviseable to seem ignorant of what people offer to tell you; and when they say, Have not you heard of such a thing? to answer, No; and to let them go on, though you know it already. Some have a pleasure in telling it, be∣cause they think they tell it well; others have a pride in it, as being the sagacious discoveries; and many have a vanity in shewing that they have been, though very undeservedly, trusted: all these would be disappointed, and consequent∣ly displeased, if you said, Yes. Seem always ignorant (unless to one most intimate friend) of all matters of private scandal and defamation, though you should hear them a thousand times; for the parties affected always look upon the re∣ceiver to be almost as bad as the thief; and when∣ever they become the topic of conversation, seem to be a sceptic, though you are really a serious believer; and always take the extenuating part. But all this seeming ignorance should be joined to thorough and extensive private informations; and, indeed, it is the best method of procuring them; for most people have such a vanity in shewing a superiority over others, though but for a moment, and in the merest trifles, that they will tell you what they should not, rather than not shew that they can tell what you did not know; besides that, such seeming ignorance will make you pass for incurious, and consequently undesigning. However, fish for facts, and take pains to be well informed of every thing that passes; but fish judiciously, and not always, nor indeed often, in the shape of direct questions; which always put people upon their guard, and, often repeated, grow tiresome. But sometimes take the things that you would know for granted;
<PB N="62" REF="025064_0070_0FCE48B883BF4A20"/>
upon which somebody will, kindly and officious∣ly, set you right: sometimes say, that you have heard so and so; and at other times seem to know more than you do, in order to know all that you want: but avoid direct questioning as much as you can.</P>
<P>Human nature is the same all over the world but its operations are so varied by education and habit, that none must see it in all it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dresses, in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der to be intimately acquainted with it. The pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of ambition, for instance, is the same in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tier, a soldier, or an ecclesiastic; but from their different educations and habits, they will take very different methods to gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ify it. Civili∣ty, which is a disposition to accommodate and oblige others, is essentially the same in every country▪ but good-breeding, as it is called, which is the manner of exerting that disposition, in dif∣ferent in almost every country, and merely local▪ and every man of sense imitates and conforms to that local good-breeding of the place which he is at. A conformity and flexibility of manners is necessary in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> course of the world; that is, with regard to all things which are not wrong in them∣selves. The <HI>versatile ingenium</HI> is the most use∣ful of all. It can turn itself instantly from one ob∣ject to another, assuming the proper manner for each. It can be serious with the grave, chearful with the gay, and trifling with the frivolous.</P>
<P>Indeed, nothing is more engaging than a chearful and easy conformity to people's particu∣lar manners, habits, and even weaknesses; no∣thing (to use a vulgar expression) should come amiss to a young fellow. He should be, for good purposes, what Alcibiades was commonly for bad ones—a Protens, assuming with ease, and wearing with chearfulness, any shape. Heat, cold,
<PB N="63" REF="025064_0071_0FCE48B9EC9BCCC0"/>
luxury, abstinence, gravity, gaiety, ceremony, easi∣ness, learning, trifling, business, and pleasure, are modes which he should be able to take, lay aside, or change occasionally, with as much ease as he would take or lay aside his hat.</P>
<P>Young men are apt to think that every thing is to be carried by spirit and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igour; that art is meanness, and that versatility and complai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance are the refuge of pusillanimity and weakness. This most mistaken opinion gives an indelicacy, an abruptness, and a roughness to the manners. Fools, who can never be undeceived, retain them as long as they live; reflection, with a little ex∣perience, makes men of sense shake them off soon. When they come to be a little better acquainted with themselves, and with their own species, they discover, that plain right reason is, nine times in ten, the fettered and sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckled attendant of the triumph of the heart and the passions; conse∣quently, they address themselves nine times in ten to the conqueror, not to the conqered: and con∣querors, you know, must be applied to in the gent∣lest▪ the most engaging, and the most insinuating manner.</P>
<P>But, unfortunately, young men are as apt to think themselves wise enough, as drunken men are to think themselves sober enough. They look upon spirit to be a much better thing than experience; which they call coldness. They are but half mistaken; for though spirit without ex∣perience is dangerous, experience without spirit is languid and defective. Their union, which is very rare, is perfection: you may join them, if you please; for all my experience is at your ser∣vice; and I do not desire one grain of your spirit in return. Use them both, and let them re∣ciprocally
<PB N="64" REF="025064_0072_0FCE48BAE660DC10"/>
animate and check each other. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean here, by the spirit of youth, only the vivacity and presumption of youth; which hinder them from seeing the difficulties or dangers of an undertak∣ing: but I do not mean what the silly vulgar call spirit, by which they are captious, jealous of their rank, suspicious of being under-valued, and tart (as they call it) in their repartees upon the slight∣est occasions. This is an evil and a very silly spirit, which should be driven out, and transferred to an herd of fwine.</P>
<P>To conclude: Never neglect or despise old, for the sake of new or more shining acquaintance; which would be ungrateful on your part, and never forgiven o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> theirs. Take care to make as many personal friends, and as few personal ene∣mies, as possible. I do not mean by personal friends, intimate and confidential friends, of which no man can hope to have half a dozen in the whole course of his life; but I mean friends, in the com∣mon acceptation of the word; that is, people who speak well of you, and who would rather do you good than harm, consistently with their own interest, and no further.</P>

<HEAD>LYING.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more criminal, mean, or ri∣diculous, than Lying. It is the production either of malice, cowardice, or vanity; but it generally misses of its aim in every one of these views; for lyes are always d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tected sooner or later. If we advance a malicious lye, in order to affect any man's fortune or character, we may,

indeed, injure him for some time; but we shall certainly be the greatest sufferers in the end: for as soon as we are detected, we are blasted for the infamous attempt; and whatever is said after∣wards to the disadvantage of that person, how∣ever true, passes for calumny. To lye, or to equi∣vocate (which is the same thing), to excuse our∣selves for what we have said or done, and to avoid the danger of the shame that we apprehend from it, we discover our fear as well as our falshood; and only increase, instead of avoiding, the danger and the shame; we shew ourselves to be the lowest and meanest of mankind, and are sure to be al∣ways treated as such. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we have the misfortune to be in the wrong, there is something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble in frankly owning it▪ it is the only way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oning for it, and the only way to be forgiven. To re∣move a present danger, by equivocating, evading, or shuffling, is somet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing so despicable, and betrays so much fear, that whoever practises them deserves to be chastised.</P>
<P>There are people who indulge themselves in ano∣ther sort of lying, which they reckon innocent, and which in one sense is so; for it hurts nobody but themselves. This sort of lying is the spurious off∣spring of Vanity begotten upon Folly. Those people deal in the marvellous. They have seen some things that never existed; they have seen other things which they never really saw, though they did exist, only becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they were thought worth seeing. Has any thing remarkable been said or done in any place, or in any company, they immediately present and declare themselves eye or ear witnesses of it.

<PB N="67" REF="025064_0075_0FCE48C0F00B1E38"/>
of laughter, jokes, waggery, and indiscriminate familiarity, will sink both merit and knowledge into a degree of contempt. They compose at most a merry fellow, and a merry fellow was never yet a respectable man. Indiscriminate familiarity either offends your superiors, or else dubs you their dependent and led-captain. It gives your inferiors just▪ but troublesome and improper claims of equality. A joker is near a-kin to a buffoon; and neither of them is the least related to wit. Whoever is admitted or sought for, in company, upon any other account than that of his merit and manners, is never respected there, but only made use of.—
<Q>We will have such-a-one, for he sings prettily; we will invite such-a-one to a ball, for he dances well; we will have such-a-one at supper, for he is always joking and laughing; we will ask another, be∣cause he plays deep at all games, or because he can drink a great deal.</Q>
These are all vili∣fying distinctions, mortifying preferences, and exclude all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide as of esteem and regard. Who∣ever is <HI>had</HI> (as it is called) in company, for the sake of any one thing singly, is singly that thing, and will never be considered in any other light; and consequently never respected, let his merits be what they will.</P>
<P>Dignity of manners is not only as different from pride as true courage is from blustering, or true wit from joking, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s absolutely inconsistent with it; for nothing valifies and degrades more than pride. The pretensions of the proud man are oftener treated with sneer and contempt, than with indignation—as we offer ridiculously too lit∣tle to a tradesman who asks ridiculously too much
<PB N="68" REF="025064_0076_0FCE48C2E6F0A890"/>
for his goods; but we do not haggle with one who only asks a just and reasonable price.</P>
<P>Abject flattery and indiscriminate ostentation de∣grade, as much as indiscriminate contradiction and noisy debate disgust; but a modest assertion of one's own opinion, and a complaisant acquiescence to other people's preserve dignity.</P>
<P>Vulgar low expressions, awkward motions and address, vilify as they imply either a very low turn of mind, or low education and low company.</P>
<P>Frivolous curiosity about trifles, and a labori∣ous attention to little objects, which neither require nor deserve a moment's thought, lower a man; who from thence is thought (and not unjustly) incapable of greater matters. Cardinal Retz very sagaciously marked out Cardinal Chig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a little mind, from the moment that he told him he had wrote three years with the same pen, and that it was an excellent good one still.</P>
<P>A certain degree of exterior seriousness in looks and motions gives dignity, without excluding wit and decent chearfulness, which are always serious themselves. A constant smirk upon the face, and a whiffling activity of the body, are strong indications of futility. Whoever is in a hurry shews that the thing he is about is too big for him. Haste and hurry are very different things.</P>
<P>To conclude: A man who has patiently been kicked may as well pretend to courage, as a man blasted by vices and crimes may to dignity of any kind.

<HEAD>GENTLENESS OF MANNERS, WITH FIRMNESS OR RESOLUTION OF MIND.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not know any one rule so unexceptionably useful and necessary in every part of life, as to unite <HI>Gentleness of Manners</HI> with <HI>Firmness of Mind.</HI> The first alone would degenerate and sink into a mean, timid complaisance and passivenes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if not supported and dignified by the latter; which would also deviate into impetuosity and bruta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, if not tempered and softened by the other: how∣ever, they are seldom united. The warm, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦leric man, with strong animal spirits, des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the first, and thinks to carry all before him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the last. He may possibly, by great accide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now and then succeed, when he was only weak and timid people to deal with; but his general fate will be, to shock, offend, be hated, and fail. On the other hand, the cunning, crafty man thinks to gain all his ends by gentleness of manners only: <HI>he becomes all things in all men</HI>; he seems to have no opinion of his own, and ser∣vilely adopts the present opinion of the present person; he insinuates himself only into the esteem of fools, but is soon detected, and surely despised by every body else. The wise man (who differs as much from the cunning as from the choleric man) alone joins softness of manners with firm∣ness of mind.</P>
<P>The advantages arising from an union of these qualities are equally striking and obvious. For example▪ If you are in authority, and have a
<PB N="70" REF="025064_0078_0FCE48C5A3A317B8"/>
right to command, your commands delivered with mildness and gentleness will be willingly, chear∣fully, and consequently well obeyed; whereas, if given brutally, they will rather be interpreted th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> executed. For a cool, steady resolution should shew, that where you have a right to com∣mand you will be obeyed; but, at the same time, a gentleness in the manner of enforcing that obe∣dience should make it a chearful one, and soften, as much as possible, the mortifying consciousness of inferiority.</P>
<P>If you are to ask a favour, or even to solicit your due, you must do it with a <HI>grace,</HI> or you will give those who have a mind to refuse you, a pretence to do it, by resenting the manner; but, on the other hand, you must, by a steady perseverance and decent tenaciousness, shew firm∣ness and resolution. The right motives are sel∣dom the true ones of men's actions, especially of people in high stations; who often give to impor∣tunity and fear what they would refuse to justice or to merit. By gentleness and softness engage their hearts, if you can; at least prevent the pre∣tence of offence; but take care to shew resolution and firmness enough to extort from their love of ease, or their fear, what you might in vain hope for from their justice or good-nature. People in high life are hardened to the wants and distresses of mankind, as surgeons are to their bodily pains; they see and hear of them all day long, and even of so many simulated ones, that they do not know which are real and which are not. Other senti∣ments are therefore to be applied to, than those of mere justice and humanity: their favour must be captivated by the Graces; their love of ease disturbed by unwearied importunity, or their
<PB N="71" REF="025064_0079_0FCE48CB100F1198"/>
fears wrought upon by a decent intimation of implacable, cool, resentment. This precept is the only way I know in the world, of being loved without being despised, and feared without being hated. It constitutes the dignity of cha∣racter, which every wise man must endeavour to establish.</P>
<P>To conclude: If you find that you have a hastiness in your temper, which unguardedly breaks out into indiscreet sallies, or rough ex∣pressions, to either your superiors, your equals, or your inferiors, watch it narrowly, check it carefully, and call the Graces to your assistance. At the first impulse of passion, be silent till you can be soft. Labour even to get the command of your countenance so well, that those emotions may not be read in it: a most unspeakable advan∣tage in business! On the other hand, let no com∣plaisance, no gentleness of temper, no weak de∣sire of pleasing on your part—no wheedling, coaxing, nor flattery on other people's make you recede one jot from any point that reason and prudence have bid you pursue; but return to the charge, persist, persevere, and you will find most things attainable that are possible. A yielding, timid meekness is always abused and insulted by the unjust and unfeeling; but when sustained by firmness and resolution, is always respected, com∣monly successful.</P>
<P>In your friendships, and connections, as well as in your enmities, this rule is particularly useful; let your firmness and vigour preserve and invite attchments to you; but, at the same time, let your manner hinder the enemies of your friends and dependents from becoming yours: let your enemies be disarmed by the gentleness of
<PB N="72" REF="025064_0080_0FCE48CC60DCD398"/>
your manner, but let them feel at the same time the steadiness of your just resentment; for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e is great difference between bearing m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice, which is always ungenerous, and a resolute self-defence, which is always prudent and justifiable.</P>
<P>Some people cannot gain upon themselves to be easy and civil to those who are either their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> competitors, or opposers▪ though, independently of those accidental circumstances, they would like and esteem them.

This is ex∣ceedingly weak and detrimental, as, indeed, is all humour in business; which can only be car∣ried on successfully by unadulterated good policy and right reasoning. In such situations I would be more particularly civil, easy, and frank, with the man whose designs I traversed: this is common∣ly called generosity and magnanimity, but is, in truth, good-sense and policy. The manner is often as important as the matter, sometimes more so: a favour may make an enemy, and an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury may make a friend, according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> different ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner in which they are severally done.

There are, however, wretches in the world proffigate enough to explode all notions of moral good and evil; to maintain that they are merely local, and de∣pend entirely upon the customs and fashions of different countries: nay, there are still, if possible, more unaccountable wretches; I mean those who affect to preach and propagate such absurd and infamous notions without believing them them∣selves. Avoid as much as possible the com∣pany of such people, who reflect a degree of dis∣credi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and infamy upon all who converse with them. But as you may sometimes by accident fall into such company, take great care that no complaisance, no good-humour, no warmth of fes∣tal mirth, ever make you seem even to acquiesce, much less approve or applaud, such infamous doctrines. On the other hand, do not debate, nor enter into serious argument, upon a subject so much below it▪ but content yourself with telling them that you know they are not serious; that you have a much better opinion of them than they would have you have; and that you are very sure they would not practise the doctrine they preach. But put your private mark upon them, and shun them for ever afterwards.</P>
<P>There is nothing so delicate as a man's moral character, and nothing which it is his interest so much to preserve pure. Should he be suspected of injustice, malignity, perfidy, lying, &amp;c. all the parts and knowledge in the world will never procure him esteem, friendship, or respect. I therefore recommend to you a most scrupulous tenderness for your moral character, and the utmost care not to say or do the least thing that
<PB N="74" REF="025064_0082_0FCE48CF1EE9A2A0"/>
may ever so slightly taint it. Shew yourself upon all occasions the friend, but not the bully of Virtue. Even Colonel Chartres (who was the most notorious blasted rascal in the world, and who had by all sorts of crimes amassed im∣mense wealth) sensible of the disadvantage of a bad character, was once heard to say, that
<Q>though he would not give one farthing for vir∣tue, he would give ten thousand pounds for a character; because he should get a hundred thou∣sand pounds by it.</Q>
Is it possible, then, that an honest man can neglect what a wiser rogue would pur∣chase so dear?</P>
<P>There is one of the vices above-mentioned into which people of good education, and in the main, of good principles, sometimes fall, from mistaken notions of skill, dexterity and self-defence; I mean lying; though it is inseparable attended with more infamy and loss than any other. But I have before given you my sentiments very freely on this subject; I shall therefore conclude this head with intreating you to be scrupulously jealous of the purity of your moral character; keep it immaculate, un∣blemished, unsullied, and it will be unsuspected Defamation and calumny never attack where there is no weak place; they magnify, but they do not create.</P>

<HEAD>COMMON-PLACE OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER use, believe, or approve Common-place Observations. They are the common topics of witlings and coxcombs; those who really have wit have the utmost contempt for them,
<PB N="75" REF="025064_0083_0FCE48D159143250"/>
and scorn even to laugh at the pert things that those would-be wits say upon such subjects.</P>
<P>Religion is one of their favourite topics; it is all priest-craft, and an invention contrived and carried on by priests of all religions for their own power and profit: from this absurd and false principle flow the common-place insipid jokes and insults upon the clergy. With these people every priest of every religion is either a public or a concealed unbeliever, drunkard, and whoremaster; whereas I conceive that priests are extremely like other men, and neither the better nor the worse for wearing a gown or a surplice; but if they are different from other people, probably it is rather on the side of religion and morality, or at least decency, from their education and manner of life.</P>
<P>Another common topic for false wit and cold raillery is matrimony. Every man and his wife hate each other cordially, whatever they may pretend in public to the contrary. The husband certainly wishes his wife at the devil, and the wife certainly cuckolds her husband. Whereas I presume, that men and their wives neither love nor hate each other the more, upon account of the form of matrimony which has been said over them. The cohabitation, indeed, which is the consequence of matrimony, makes them either love or hate more, accordingly as they respec∣tively deserve it; but that would be exactly the same, between any man and woman who lived toge∣ther without being married.</P>
<P>It is also a trite common-place observation, that courts are the seats of falshood and dissimu∣lation. That like many I might say most common-place observations is false. Falshood
<PB N="76" REF="025064_0084_0FCE48D2B455A4E0"/>
and dissimulation are certainly to be found at courts; but where are they not to be found? Cottages have them, as well as courts; only with wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e manners. A couple of neighbouring farmers in a village will contrive and practise as many tricks to over-reach each other at the next market, or to supplant each other in the favour of the 'Squire, as any two courtiers can do to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upplant each other in the favour of their Prince. Whatever poets may write, or fools believe, of rural inno∣cence and truth, and of the perfidy of courts, this is undoubtedly true—That shepherds and ministers are both men▪ their nature and passions the same, the modes of them only different.</P>
<P>These and many other common-place reflec∣tions upon nations, or professions, in general (which are at least as often false as true) are the poor refuge of people who have neither wit nor invention of their own, but endeavour to shine in company by second hand finery. I always put these pert jackanapes's out of countenance, by looking extremely grave, when they expect that I should laugh at their plea∣santries; and by saying, <HI>Well▪ and so</HI>? as if they had not done, and that the sting were still to come. This disconcerts them, as they have no resources in them∣selves, and have but one set of jokes to live upon. Men of parts are not reduced to these shifts, and have the utmost contempt for them: they find proper subjects enough for either useful or lively conversati∣ons; they can be witty without satire or common-place, and serious without being dull.</P>

<HEAD>ORATORY.</HEAD>
<P>ORATORY, or the art of speaking well, is use∣ful in every situation of life, and absolutely necessary in most. A man cannot distinguish himself without it in parliament, in the pulpit, or at the bar; and even in comon conversation, he who has acquired an easy and habitual elo∣quence, and who speaks with propriety and ac∣curacy, will have a great advantage over those who speak inelegantly and incorrectly. The bu∣siness of oratory is to persuade; and to please is the most effectual step towards persuading. It is very advantageous for a man who speaks in public to please his hearers so much as to gain their attention; which he cannot possibly do, without the assistance of oratory.</P>
<P>It is certain that by study and application every man may make himself a tolerable good orator, eloquence depending upon observation and care. Every man may, if he pleases, make choice of good instead of bad words and phrases, may speak with propriety instead of impropriety, and may be clear and perspicuous in his recitals, in∣stead of dark and unintelligible; he may have grace instead of awkwardness in his gestures and deportment: in short, it is in the power of every man, with pains and application, to be a very agreeable instead of a very disagreeable speaker; and it is well worth the labour to excel other men in that particular article in which they excel best.</P>
<P>Demosthenes thought it so essentially necessary to speak well, that though he naturally stuttred,
<PB N="78" REF="025064_0086_0FCE48D754CA47E8"/>
and had weak lungs, he resolved by application to overcome those disadvantages. He cured his stammering by putting small pebbles in his mouth, and gradually strengthened his lungs by daily using himself to speak loudly and distinctly for a considerable time. In stormy weather he often visited the sea-shore, where he spoke as loud as he could, in order to prepare himself for the noise and murmurs of the popular assemblies of the Athenians, before whom he was to speak. By this extraordinary care and attention▪ and the constant study of the best authors, he became the greatest oratory that his own, or any other age or country have produced.</P>
<P>Whatever language a person uses, he should speak it in its greatest purity, and according to the rules of grammer; nor is it sufficient that we do not speak a language ill, we must endeavour to speak it well; for which purpose we should read the best authors with attention, and observe how people of fashion and education speak. Common people, in general, speak ill; they make use of inelegant and vulgar expressions, which people of rank never do. In numbers they frequent∣ly join the singular and plural together, and confound the masculine with the feminine gender, and seldom make choice of the proper tense. To avoid all these faults we should read with attention, and observe the turn and expressions of the best authors; nor should we pass over a word we do not perfectly understand, with∣out searching or enquiring for the exact meaning of it.</P>
<P>It is said, that a man must be born a poet, but it is in his own power to make himself an orator; for to be a poet requires a certain degree of strength and vivacity of mind; but that attention, reading, and labour, are sufficient to form an orator.</P>

<HEAD>PEDANTRY.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY excellency and every virtue has its kindred vice or weakness; and, if carried beyond certain bounds, sinks into the one or the other. Generosity often runs into profusion, oeconomy into avarice, courage into rashness, cau∣tion into timidity, and so on;—insomuch that I believe there is more judgment required for the proper conduct of our virtues, than for avoiding their opposite vices. Vice, in its true light is so deformed, that it shocks at first sight; and would hardly ever seduce us, if it did not at first wear the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ask of some virtue. But virtue is in itself so beautiful, that it charms us at first sight; en∣gages us more and more upon further acquaint∣ance, and, as with other beauties, we think ex∣cess impossible: it is here that judgment is neces∣sary to moderate and direct the effects of an excellent cause. In the same manner great learn∣ing, if not accompanied with sound judgment, frequently carries us into error, pride, and pe∣dantry.</P>
<P>Some learned men, proud of their knowledge, only speak to decide, and give judgment without appeal; the consequence of which is, that man∣kind, provoked by the insult, and injured by the opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession, revolt; and in order to shake off the tyranny even call the lawful authority in question.

<P>Some great scholars, most absurdly, draw all their maxims, both for public and private life, from what they call parallel cases in the ancient authors; without considering, that, in the first place, there never w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, since the Creation of the World, two cases exactly parallel; and in the next place, that there never was a case stated, or even known by any historian with every one of its circumst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces; which, however, ought to be know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to be reasoned from.

<P>There is another species of learned men, who, though less dogmatical and supercilious, are not

less impertinent. These are the communicative and shining pedants, who adorn their conversa∣tion, even with women, by happy quotations of Greek and Latin, and who have cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acted such a familiarity with the Greek and Roman au∣thors, that they call them by certain names or epithets denoting intimacy; as <HI>old</HI> Homer; that <HI>sly rogue</HI> Horace; <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI> instead of Virgil; <HI>Naso,</HI> instead of Ovid.

If, therefore, you would avoid the accusation of pedantry on one hand, or the suspicion of ignorance on the other, abstain from learned ostentation.

to body and mind, is certainly a fine pleasure! Gaming, which draws us into a thou∣sand scrapes, leaves us pennyless, and gives us the air and manners of an outrageous madman, is another most exquisite plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure.</P>
<P>Pleasure is the rock which most young people split upon; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unch out with crowded sails in quest of it, but without a compass to direct their course, or reason sufficient to steer the vessel: there∣fore pain and shame, instead of pleasure, are the re∣turns of their voyage.</P>
<P>A man of pleasure, in the vulgar acceptation of that phrase, means only a beastly drunkard, an abandoned rake, and profligate swearer: we should weigh the present enjoyment of our plea∣sures against the unavoidable consequences of them, and then let our common sense determine the choice.</P>
<P>We may enjoy the pleasures of the table and wine, but stop short of the pains inseparably an∣nexed to an excess in either. We may let other people do as they will, without formally and sen∣tentiously rebuking them for it; but we must be firmly resolved not to destroy our own faculties and constitution, in compliance to those who have no reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd to their own. We may play to give us leasure, but not to give us pain; we may play for trifles in mixed companies to amuse our∣selves and conform to custom. Good company are not fond of having a man reeling drunk among them; nor is it agreeable to see another tearing his hair, and blaspheming for having lost at play more than he is able to pay; or a rake with half a nose crippled by coarse and in∣famous debauches. Those who pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctise and brag of these things make no part of good com∣pany;
<PB N="83" REF="025064_0091_0FCE367AA0842478"/>
and are most unwillingly, if ever, admitted into it. A real man of fashion and pleasure ob∣serves decency; at least, he neither borrows nor affects vices; and if he is so unfortunate as to have any, he gratifies them with choice, delicacy, and secrecy.</P>
<P>We should be as attentive to our pleasures as to our studies. In the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, we should observe and reflect upon all we read; and in the former, be watchful and attentive to every thing we see and hear; and let us never have it to say, as some fools do, of things that were said and done before their faces, That

<P>All gaming, field-sports, and such other amuse∣ments, where neither the understanding nor the senses have the least share, are frivolous, and the resources of little minds, who either do not think, or do not love to think.

<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT OF TIME.</HEAD>
<P>HOW little do we reflect on the use and value of time! It is in every body's mouth, but in few people's practice. Every fool who slatterns away his whole time in nothings, frequently utters some trite common-place sentence to prove at once the value and the fleetness of time. The sun∣dials all over Europe have some ingenious inscrip∣tion to that effect; so that nobody squanders away their time without frequently hearing and seeing how necessary it is to employ it well, and how irrecoverable it is if lost. Young people are apt to think they have so much time before them, that they may squander what they please of it, and yet have enough left; as great fortunes have frequently seduced people to ruinous profu∣sion. But all these admonitions are useless, where
<PB N="87" REF="025064_0095_0FCE48E7E32FA8F0"/>
there is not a fund of good-sense and reason to suggest rather than receive them.</P>
<P>Time is precious, life short, and consequently not a single moment should be lost. Sensible men know how to make the most of time, and put out their whole sum either to interest or pleasure; they are never idle, but continually employed either in amusements or study. It is an universal maxim, that idleness is the mother of vice. It is, however, certain, that laziness is the inheritance of fools, and nothing can be so despicable as a sluggard. Cato the Censor, a wise and virtuous Roman, used to say, there were but three actions of his life that he regretted: The first was, the having revealed a secret to his wife; the second, that he had once gone by sea when he might have gone by land; and the third, the having passed one day without <HI>doing any thing.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Take care of the pence, for the pounds will take care of themselves,</Q>
was a very just and sensible reflection of old Mr. Lowndes, the famous Secretary of the Treasury under William III. Anne. and George I. I therefore recom∣mend to you to take care of minutes, for hours will take care of themselves. Be doing some∣thing or other all day long; and not neglect half hours and quarters of hours, which at the year's end amount to a great sum. For instance: There are many short intervails in the day be∣tween studies and pleasures: instead of sitting idle and yawning in those intervals, snatch up some valuable book, and continue the reading of that book till you have got through it; never burthen your mind with more than one thing at a time: and in reading this book, do not run over it superficially, but read every passage twice
<PB N="88" REF="025064_0096_0FCE48ED4988AC80"/>
over at least; do not pass on to a second till you thoroughly understand the first, nor quit the book till you are master of the subject; for unless you do this, you may read it through and not remem∣ber the contents of it for a week. The books I would particularly recommend among others, are the <HI>Marchioness Lambert's Advice to her Son and Daughter, Cardinal Reiz's Maxi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Rochefou∣cault's Moral Reflections, Brayers's Characters. Fontenella's Plurality of Worlds, Sir Josiah Child on Trade, Bolingbroke's Work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; for style, his <HI>Remarks on the History of England,</HI> under the name of Sir John Oldcastle; <HI>Puffendorff's Jus Gentium,</HI> and <HI>Grotius de Jure Bell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> et Pacis</HI>: the last two are well translated by Barbeyra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. For occasional half-hours or less, read works of invention, wit and humour; but never waste your minutes on trifling authors, either ancient or modern.</P>
<P>Nor are pleasures idleness, or time lost, provided they are the pleasures of a rational being; on the con∣trary, a certain portion of time employed in those pleasures, is very usefully employed.</P>
<P>Whatever business you have, do it the first mo∣ment you can; never by halves, but finish it without interruption if possible. Business must not be sauntered or trifled with; and you must not say to it, as Felix did to Paul,
<Q>At a more convenient season I will speak to thee.</Q>
The most convenient season for business is the first; but study and business, in some measure, point out their own times to a man of sense: time is much oftener squandered away in the wrong choice and improper methods of amusement and plea∣sures.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="025064_0097_0FCE48EEA2AC8A88"/>Dispatch is the soul of business; and nothing contributes more to dispatch than method. Lay down a method for every thing, and stick to it inviolably, as far as unexpected incidents may allow. Fix one certain hour and day in the week for your accounts, and keep them together in their proper order; by which means they will require very little time, and you can never be much cheated. Whatever letters and papers you keep, pocket and tie them up in their respective classes, so that you may instantly have recouse to any one. Lay down a method also for your reading, for which you allot a certain share of your mornings; let it be in a consistent and con∣secutive course, and not in that desultory and im∣methodical manner, in which many people read scraps of different authors upon different sub∣jects. Keep a useful and short common place-book of what you read, to help your memory only, and not for pedantic quotations. Never read history without having maps, and a chro∣nolagical book or tables lying by you, and con∣stantly recurred to; without which History is only a confused heap of facts.</P>
<P>You will say it may be, as many young peo∣ple would, that all this order and method is very troublesome, only fit for dull people, and a dis∣agreeable restraint upon the noble spirit and fire of youth. I deny it; and assert on the contrary, that it will procure you both more time and more taste for your pleasures; and so far from being troublesome to you, that after you have pursued it a month, it would be troublesome to you to lay it aside. Business whets the appetite, and gives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taste to pleasures, as exercise does to food; and business can never be done without method: it
<PB N="90" REF="025064_0098_0FCE48F025C192B8"/>
raises the spirit, for pleasures; and a <HI>spectacle,</HI> a ball, an assembly, will much more sensibly affect a man who has employed, than a man who has lost, the preceding part of the day; nay, I will venture to say, that a fine lady will seem to have more charms to a man of study or business, than to a saunterer. The same listlessness runs through his whole conduct, and he is as insipid in his pleasures as inefficient in every thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g else.</P>
<P>I hope you earn your pleasures, and consequent∣ly taste them; for, by the way, I know a great ma∣ny men who call themselves men of pleasure, but who, in truth, have none. They adopt other people's indiscriminately, but without any taste of their own. I have known them often inflict exces∣ses upon themselves, because they thought them gen∣teel; though they sat as awkwardly upon them as other people's cloaths would have done. Have no pleasures but your own, and then you will shine in them.</P>
<P>Many people think that they are in pleasures, provided they are neither in study nor in business. Nothing like it; they are doing nothing, and might just as well be asleep. They contract habitudes from laziness, and they only frequent those places where they are free from all restraints and attentions. Be upon your guard against this idle profusion of time; and let every place you go to be either the scene of quick and lively pleasures, or the school of your im∣prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ments: let every company you go into either gratify your senses, extend your knowledge, or refine your manners.</P>
<P>If by accident two or three hours are some∣times wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing for some useful purpose, borrow them from your sleep. Six, or at most, seven hours sleep is, for a constancy, as much as you
<PB N="91" REF="025064_0099_0FCE48F1C3798AA8"/>
or any body can want: more is only laziness and dozing; and is both unwholesome and stupifying. If by chance your business or your pleasures should keep you up till four or five o'clock in the morning, rise exactly at your usual time, that you may not lose the precious morning hours; and that the want of sleep may force you to go to bed earlier the next night.</P>
<P>Above all things guard ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst frivolousness. The frivolous mind is alwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s busied, but to little purpose; it takes little objects for great ones, and throws away upon trifles that time and attention which only important things deserve. Knick-knacks, butterflies, shells, insects, &amp;c. are the objects of their most serious researches. They contemplate the dress, not the characters of the company they keep. They attend more to the decorations of a play, than to the sense of it; and to the ceremonies of a court, more than to its politics. Such an employment of time is an absolute loss of it.</P>
<P>To conclude this subject: Sloth, indolence, and effeminacy are pernicious, and unbecoming a young fellow; let them be your <HI>ressource</HI> forty years hence at soonest. Determine, at all events, and however disagreeable it may be to you in some respects, and for some time, to keep the most distinguished and fashionable company of the place you are at, either for their rank or for their learning, or <HI>le bel esp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it et le gout.</HI> This gives you credentials to the best companies where-ever you go afterwards.</P>
<P>Know the true value of time: snatch, seize, and enjoy every moment of it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination: never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day. That was
<PB N="92" REF="025064_0100_0FCE494BAE6F11D8"/>
the rule of the famous and unfortunate Pension∣ary De Witt; who by strictly following it found time not only to do the whole business of the Re∣public, but to pass his evenings at assemblies and suppers, as if he had had nothing else to do or think of.</P>

<HEAD>VANITY.</HEAD>
<P>BE extremely on your guard against vanity, the common failing of inexperienced youth; but particularly against that kind of vanity which dubs a man a coxcomb; a character which, once ac∣quired, is more indelible than that of the priest∣hood. It is not to be imagined by how many different ways vanity defeats its own purposes. One man decides peremptorily upon every sub∣ject, betrays his ignorance upon many, and shews a disgusting presumption upon the rest: another desires to appear successful among the women: he hints at the encouragement he has received from those of the most distinguished rank and beauty, and intimates a particular connection with some one: if it is true, it is ungenerous; if false, it is infamous: but in either case he destroys the re∣putation he wants to get. Some flatter their va∣nity by little ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aneous objects, which have not the least relation to themselves; such as being descended from, related to, or acquainted with, people of distinguished merit, and eminent cha∣racters. They talk perpetually of their grand∣father such-a-one, their uncle such a-one, and their intimate friend Mr. such-a-one, whom, pos∣sibly, they are hardly acquainted with. But ad∣mitting it all to be as they would have it, what
<PB N="93" REF="025064_0101_0FCE36872A293A68"/>
then? Have they the more merit for those acci∣dents? Certainly not. On the contrary, their taking up adventitious, proves their want of in∣trinsic merit; a rich man never borrows. Take this rule for granted, as a never-failing one, that you must never seem to affect the character in which you have a mind to shine. Modesty i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the only sure bait, when you angle for praise. The affectation of courage will make even a brave man pass only for a bully; as the affectation of wit will make a man of parts pass for a coxcomb. By this modesty I do not mean timidity, and awkward bashfulness. On the contrary, be in∣wardly firm and steady, know your own value, whatever it may be, and act upon that principle; but take great care to let nobody discover that you do know your own value. Whatever real merit you have, other people will discover; and people always magnify their own discoveries, as they lessen those of others.</P>

<HEAD>VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>VIRTUE is a subject which deserves your and every man's attention. It consists in doing good, and in speaking truth; the effects of it, therefore, are advantageous to all mankind, and to one's self in particular. Virtue makes us pity and relieve the misfortunes of mankind; it makes us promote justice and good order in society; and, in general, contributes to whatever tends to the real good of mankind. To ourselves it gives an inward comfort and satisfaction, which no∣thing else can do, and which nothing can rob us of. All other advantages depend upon others,
<PB N="94" REF="025064_0102_0FCE368D3244F138"/>
as much as upon ourselves. Riches, power, and greatness may be taken away from us by the vio∣lence and injustice of others, or by inevitable ac∣cidents; but virtue depends only upon ourselves, and nobody can take it away from us. Sickness may deprive us of all the pleasures of the body; but it cannot deprive us of our virtue, nor of the satisfaction which we feel from it. A virtuous man, under all the misfortunes of life, still finds an inward comfort and satisfaction, which makes him happier than any wicked man can be with all the other advantages of life. If a man has ac∣quired great power and riches by falsehood, in∣justice and oppression, he cannot enjoy them: because his conscience will torment him, and con∣stantly reproa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h him with the means by which he got them. The stings of his conscience will not even let him sleep quietly; but he will dream of his crimes; and in the day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>time, when alone, and when he has time to think, he will be uneasy and melancholy. He is afraid of every thing; for, as he knows mankind must hate him, he has reason to think they will hurt him if they can. Whereas if a virtuous man be ever so poor and unfortunate in the world, still his virtue is its own reward, and will comfort him under all af∣flictions. The quiet and satisfaction of his conscience make him chearful by day, and sleep sound of nights: he can be alone with pleasure, and is not afraid of his own thoughts. Virtue forces her way, and shines through the obscurity, of a retired life; and, sooner or letter, it always is rewarded.</P>
<P>To conclude:—Lord Shaftesbury says, that he would be virtuous for his own sake, though nobody were to know it▪ as he would he clean for his own sake, though nobody were to see him.</P>

<HEAD>USEFUL MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON MEN AND MANNERS, Selected from Lord CHE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TERFIELD's LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN who does not solidly establish, and re∣ally deserve, a character of truth, probity, good manners, and good morals, at his first setting out in the world, may impose, and shine like a me∣teor for a short time, but will very soon vanish, and be extinguished with contempt. People easily par∣don, in young men, the common irregularities of the senses; but they do not forgive the least vice of the heart.</P>
<P>The greatest favours may be done so awkward∣ly and bunglingly as to offend; and disagreea∣ble things may be done so agreeably as almost to oblige.</P>
<P>There are very few Captains of Foot who are not much better company than ever Descartes or Sir Isaac Newton were. I honour and respect such superior genuises; but I desire to converse with people of this world, who bring into com∣pany their share, at least, of chearfulness, good-breeding, and knowledge of mankind. In com∣mon life, one much oftener wants small money, and silver, than gold. Give me a man who has ready cash about him for prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t expences; six-pences, shillings, half-crowns, and crowns, which circulate easily; but a man who has only an in∣got
<PB N="96" REF="025064_0104_0FCE48F923442708"/>
of gold about him, is much above common pur∣poses, and his riches are not handy nor convenient. Have as much gold as you please in one pocket, but take care always to keep change in the other; for you will much oftener have occasion for a shilling than for a guinea.</P>
<P>Advice is seldom welcome, and those who want it the most always like it the least.</P>
<P>Envey is one of the meanest and most tormenting of all passions, as there is hardly a person existing that has not given uneasiness to an envious breast; for the envious man cannot be happy while he beholds others so.</P>
<P>A great action will always meet with the approba∣tion of mankind, and the inward pleasure which it produces is not to be expressed.</P>
<P>Humanity is the particular characteristic of great minds; little vicious minds abound with anger and revenge, and are incapable of feeling the exalted plea∣sure of forgiving their enemies.</P>
<P>The ignorant and the weak only are idle; those who have acquired a good stock of knowledge al∣was desire to increase it. Knowledge is like power in this respect, that those who have the most are most desirous of having more. Idleness is only the refuge of weak minds, and the holiday of fools.</P>
<P>Every man has a natural right to his liberty; and whoever endeavours to ravish it from him, deserves death more than the robber who attacks us for our money on the highway.</P>
<P>Modesty is a commendable quality, and gene∣rally accompanies true merit; it engages and captivates the minds of people; for nothing is
<PB N="97" REF="025064_0105_0FCE48FB02304D80"/>
more shocking and disgustful, than presumption and impudence. A man is despised who is always commending himself, and who is the hero of his own story.</P>
<P>Not to perform our promise is a folly, a disho∣nour, and a crime. It is a folly, because no one will rely on us afterwards; and it is a dishonour and a crime, because truth is the first duty of re∣ligion and morality: and whoever is not possessed of truth, cannot be supposed to have any one good quality, and must be held in detestation by all good men.</P>
<P>Wit may create many admirers, but makes few friends. It shines and dazzles like the noon-day sun, but, like that too, is very apt to scorch, and therefore is always feared. The milder morning and evening light and heat of that planet sooth and calm our minds. Never seek for wit: if it pre∣sents itself, well and good; but even in that case, let your judgment interpose; and take care that it be not at the expence of any body. Pope says very truly.
<Q><L>"There are whom heaven has blest with store of wit,</L>
<L>"Yet want as much again to govern it."</L></Q>
And in another place, I doubt with too much truth,
<Q><L>"For wit and judgment ever are at strife,</L>
<L>"Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife."</L></Q></P>
<P>A proper secrecy is the only mystery of able men; mystery is the only secrecy of weak and cun∣ning ones.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="025064_0106_0FCE48FC38C28098"/>To tell any friend, wife, or mistress, any secret with which they have nothing to do, is discovering to them such an unretentive weakness, as must con∣vince them that you will tell it to twenty others, and consequently that they may reveal it without the risk of being discovered. But a secret properly commu∣nicated only to those who are to be concerned in the question will probably be kept by them, though they should be a good many. Little secrets are commonly told again, but great ones generally kept.</P>
<P>A man who tells nothing, or who tells all, will equally have nothing told him.</P>
<P>If a fool knows a secret, he tells it because he is a fool; if a knave knows one, he tells it whereever it is his interest to tell it. But women and young men are very apt to tell what secrets they know, from the vanity of having been trusted. Trust none of these, wherever you can help it.</P>
<P>In your friendships, and in your enmities, let your confidence and your hostilities have certain bounds: make not the former dangerous, nor the latter irreconcileable. There are strange vicissitudes in business!</P>
<P>Smooth your way to the head through the heart. The way of reason is a good one; but it is commonly something longer, and perhaps not so sure.</P>
<P>Spirit is now a very fashionable word: to act with spirit, to speak with spirit, means only to act rashly, and to talk indiscre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly. An able man shews his spi∣rit by gentle words and resolute actions: he is neither hot nor timid.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="025064_0107_0FCE48FEEE0FB3C8"/>Patience is a most necessary qualification for busi∣ness; many a man would rather you heard his story than granted his request. One must seem to hear the unreasonable demands of the petulant, unmoved, and the tedious details of the dull, untired. That is the least price that a man must pay for a high station.</P>
<P>It is always right to detect a fraud, and to perceive a folly; but it is often very wrong to expose either. A man of business should always have his eyes open, but must often seem to have them shut.</P>
<P>In courts, <HI>(and every where else)</HI> bashfulness and timidity are as prejudicial on one hand, as impudence and rashness are on the other. A steady assurance and a cool intrepidity, with an exterior modesty, are the true and necessary me∣dium.</P>
<P>Never apply for what you see very little proba∣bility of obtaining; for you will, by asking im∣proper and unattainable things, accustom the Ministers to refuse you so often, that they will find it easy to refuse you the properest and most reasonable ones. It is a common, but a most mistaken rule at Court, to ask for every thing in order to get something: you do get something by it, it is true; but that something is, refusals and ri∣dicule.—This maxim, like the former, is of general application.</P>
<P>A chearful, easy countenance and behaviour are very useful: they make fools think you a good-natured man; and they make designing men think you an undesigning one.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="025064_0108_0FCE49001E0F8A98"/>There are some occasions in which a man must tell half his secret, in order to conceal the rest; but there is seldom one in which a man should tell it all. Great skill is necessary to know how far to go, and where to stop.</P>
<P>Ceremony is necessary, as the outwork and de∣fence of manners.</P>
<P>A man's own good breeding is his best security against other people's ill-manners.</P>
<P>Good-breeding carries along with it a dignity, that is respected by the most petulant. Ill-breed∣ing invites and authorizes the familiarity of the most timid. No man ever said a pert thing to the Duke of Marlborough. No man ever said a civil one (though many a flattering one) to Sir Robert Walpole.</P>
<P>Knowledge may give weight, but accomplish∣ments only give lustre; and many more people see than weigh.</P>
<P>Most arts require long study and application; but the most useful art of all, that of pleasing requires on∣ly the desire.</P>
<P>It is to be presumed, that a man of common sense who does not desire to please, desire nothing at all; since he must know that he cannot obtain any thing without it.</P>
<P>A skilful negociator will most carefully distin∣guish between the little and the great objects of his business; and will be as frank and open in the former, as he will be secret and pertinacious in the latter.—This maxim holes equally true in common life.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="025064_0109_0FCE4901D82D06A0"/>The Due de Sully observes very justly, in his Memoirs, that nothing contributed more to his rise, than that prudent oeconomy which he had observed from his youth; and by which he had always a sum of money before-hand, in case of emer∣gencies.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to fix the particular point of oeconomy; the best error of the two, is on the par∣simonious side. That may be corrected, the other cannot.</P>
<P>The reputation of generosity is to be purchased pretty cheap; it does not depend so much upon a man's general expence, as it does upon his giving handsomely where it is proper to give at all. A man, for instance, who should give a servant four shillings, would pass for covetous, while he who gave him a crown wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld be reckoned generous; so that the difference of those two opposite characters turns upon one shilling. A man's character, in that particular, depends a great deal upon the report of his own servants; a mere trifle above common wages makes their report favourable.</P>
<P>Take care always to form your establishment so much within your income, as to leave a sufficient fund for unexpected contingencies, and a prudent li∣berality. There is hardly a year, in any man's life, in which a small sum of ready money may not be em∣ployed to great advantage.</P>

<HEAD>ADVICE. OF A MOTHER TO HER SON.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER care is used in the education of children, it is still too little to answer the end: to make it succeed, there must be excellent governors; but where shall we find them, when princes find it difficult to get and keep them for themselves? Where can we meet with men so much superior to others, as to deserve to be en∣trusted with their conduct? Yet the first years of a man's life are precious, since they lay the founda∣tion of the merit of the rest.</P>
<P>There are but two seasons of life in which truth distinguishes itself for our advantage: in youth, for our instruction; and in our advanced years, to com∣fort us. In the age that pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> reign, truth gener∣ally quits us for the time.</P>
<P>Two celebrated <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. Bouhours and P. Cheminals.</NOTE> men, out of their friendship to me, have had the care of your education; but as they were obliged to follow the method of studies settled in Colleges, they applied themselves more in your early youth to improve your mind with learning, than to make you know the word, or instruct you in the de∣corums of life.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="025064_0112_0FCE4908398E3CD8"/>I am going, my son, to give you some precepts, for the conduct of your's: read them without think∣ing it a trouble. They are not dry lectures, that car∣ry the air of a mother's authority; they are rather the advice of a friend, and have this merit, that they come from my heart.</P>
<P>At your entering the world, you must certainly propose to yourself some end or other: you have too much sense to care to live without any design at all; nor can you aspire to any thing more becoming and worthy of you than glory. 'Tis a noble view for you to entertain; but it is fit for you to know what is meant by the term, and what notion you frame of it.</P>
<P>'Tis of various kinds, and each profession has a glory that is peculiar to it. In your's, my son, it means the glory that attends valour. This is the glory of heroes; it makes a brighter figure than any other; it always carries with it the true marks of honour, and the recompences it deserves; Fame seems to have no tongue but to sound their praise; and when you arrive at a certain degree of reputation, every thing you do is considerable. All the world has agreed to give the pre-eminence to military vir∣tues; 'tis no more than their due. They cost dear enough; but there are several ways of discharging their obligations.</P>
<P>Some engage in the profession of arms, merely to avoid the shame of degenerating from their an∣cestors; others follow it not only out of duty but inclination. The first scarce ever raise themselves above their rank in the world: 'tis a debt they pay, and they go no further. The others, flushed with hopes, and carried on by ambition, march a giant's pace in the road of glory. Some propose only to make their fortune: others have their
<PB N="107" REF="025064_0113_0FCE490A332B2EA0"/>
advancement and immortality itself in view. Such as stint themselves to the making a for∣tune, never have a very extensive merit. A man that does not aim at raising to himself a great name, will never perform any great actions. And such as go carelessly on in the road of their pro∣fession, suffer all the fatigues, without acquiring either the honour or recompence that naturally attend it.</P>
<P>If people understood their own interest rightly, they would not lay a stress upon raising a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣tune, but would in all professions have their glory and reputation in view. When you attain to a certain degree of merit, and it is generally known, the great glory and reputation you have acquired ne∣ver fails to make your fortune. A man cannot have too much ardour to distinguish himself, nor can his desires of advancement be encouraged by hopes that are too flattering.</P>
<P>There must be great views to give a great vigour to the soul; 'tis not easy otherwise to make it ex∣ert itself. Let your love of glory be ever so eager and active, you may still fall short of your aim; yet tho' you should advance but half way, 'tis always glorious to have dared.</P>
<P>There is nothing so improper for a young man as that modesty which makes him fancy he is not ca∣pable of great things. This modesty is a faintness of soul, which hinders it from exerting itself, and run∣ning with a swift career toward glory. Agesilaus was told that the king of Persia was the greatest king:
<Q>Why should he be greater than me (replied he), so long as I have a sword by my side?</Q>
There is a su∣perior genius and merit in some persons, that tells them nothing is impossible for them.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="025064_0114_0FCE490C26263470"/>Great names are not formed in a day; nor is it Valour alone that makes extraordinary men: She begins indeed to form them, but other virtues must concur to finish them.</P>
<P>The notion of a hero is inconsistent with the character of a man without justice, probity, and magnanimity. 'Tis not enough to have a name for your valour; you must have a name likewise for your probity. All the virtues must unite to∣gether to form a hero. Valour, my son, is not to be inspired by advice; 'tis a gift of nature—but such a one that a person may possess it in the highest degree, and yet deserve very little esteem in other re∣spects.</P>
<P>The g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nerality of young men fancy they are obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o nothing else, when once they have ac∣quired the military virtues; and that they are allowed to be unjust, rude, and unmannerly. Do not carry the prerogative of the sword too far; it gives you no exemption from other obligations.</P>
<P>Take care, my son, to be in reality what others promise or pretend to be; you have patterns set you in your own family. Your ancestors distinguished themselves by all manner of virtues, as well as by those of their profession. Their blood runs in your veins; remember always what you owe to your race, and think that you are not to take up with being an ordinary man; you are not like to get off at so cheap a rate. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> merit of your ancestors will enhance your glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if you degenerate, it will be your shame: they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve equally to put your virtues and your failin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a fuller light.</P>
<P>A nobl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th does a man less honour than it exacts of him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve, and to boast of one's family, is to glory in the merit of others.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="025064_0115_0FCE490E1991F988"/>You will find, my son, all the paths that lead to glory traced out and trod alredy before you; there is not a greater treasure than a good name, and the reputation of one's ancestors. They have put you in a capacity of attaining to any thing; 'tis not enough to equal them, you must go beyond them, and arrive to the goal, I mean the honours which they were at the point of enjoying, when they were carried off by an untime∣ly death.</P>
<P>Great fortunes are so seldom innocent, that I easily forgive your ancestors for not leaving you any. I have done all I could to bring out af∣fairs into some order; a point in which women can distinguish themselves no way but by oeco∣nomy. I shall do my utmost to discharge every duty incumbent upon me in my circumstances: I shall leave you as much as is fitting for you, if you are so unhappy as to have no merit; and enough in all reason, if you have the virtues I wish you.</P>
<P>As I desire nothing upon earth so much as to see you a perfectly honest man, let us see what sort of conduct is necessary to give one a title to that character, that we may know what we ought to do to deserve it. I improve myself by these reflec∣tions; and may perhaps be one day happy enough to change my precepts into examples.</P>

are my finery and jewels.' I hope, my son, to find in time a like subject of glory in you. But let us return to the obligations which men are obliged to discharge.</P>
<P>There is a certain order in these obligations. A man should know how to live with his supe∣rors, his equals▪ and his inferiors, as well as with himself. With his superiors he should know how to please without sinking into mean∣ness, should shew an esteem and friendship to his equals, should condescend to his inferiors so as not to let them feel the weight of his superiority, and should keep up a dignity with himself.</P>
<P>All these obligations are still inferior to the vene∣ration you owe to the Supreme Being. Religion is a correspondence settled between God and man, by the favours of God to men, and the worship that men pay to God. Souls of a superior genius have noble sentiments for the Deity, and pay him a worship pe∣culiar to themselves, very different from that of the vulgar: it all comes from their heart, and is directed immediately to God. Moral virtues are very pre∣carious without the christian to support them. I do not recommend to you a piety blended with weakness and superstition; I only insist, that the love of order should make you submit your understanding and sen∣timents to God, and should shew itself in every part of your conduct; it will inspire justice into you, and justice is the basis of all other virtues.</P>
<P>The generality of young men think to distin∣guish themselves now-a-days by assuming a li∣bertine air, which degrades them among men of sense: Such an air, instead of arguing a superio∣rity
<PB N="111" REF="025064_0117_0FCE49118DE0CF88"/>
of understanding, shews only the depravity of the heart. People never attack religion, but when they have an interest to attack it: Nothing makes a man happier than to have his under∣standing convinced, and his heart affected with it; 'tis of excelent use in every season and cir∣cumstance of life. Such as are not happy enough to believe as they ought, do yet find it reasonable to submit to the established religion: They know that what is miscalled prejudice has a great vogue in the world, and ought to be treated with respect.</P>
<P>A libertine way of thinking, and licentiousness of manners, ought to be banished under the pre∣sent reign.</P>
<P>The behaviour of the Sovereign is a sort of law to regulate that of others; it enjoins whatever he practises, and forbids what he declines doing. The failings of princes are multiplied, and their vir∣tues are renewed by imitation. Though cour∣tiers should be debauched in their sentiments, there is still a politeness reigning at court, which serves to throw a veil over vice. We have the good fortune to be born in an age when purity of morals and a respect for religion are necessary to please the Prince.</P>
<P>I might, my son, in the order of your du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, insist on what you own to me, but I would derive it entirely from your heart. Consider the con∣dition in which your father left me: I had sacri∣ficed all that belonged to me to raise his fortune, and I lost my all at his death. I saw myself left alone, destitute of any support. I had no friends but his; and I found by experience, that few persons are capable of being friends to the dead. I met with enemies in my own family: I had a
<PB N="112" REF="025064_0118_0FCE49188E19D918"/>
law-suit upon my hands against potent adversa∣ries, and my whole fortune depended on the event. I gained it at last without any power of my own, and without any cringing to others. In a word, I made the best I could of my ill circumstances; and as soon as my own fortune was mended, I set myself to make your's. Give me the same share in your friendship, that I shall give you in my little fortune.</P>
<P>I will have no affected respect: I would have all your regards to me come not from constraint, but purely from your heart. Let them proceed entirely from your inclinations, without being influenced by any motive of interest. In short, take care of your own glory, and I'll take care of every thing else.</P>
<P>You know how to conduct yourself with your superiors: but there are still some instructions to be given with regard to the duty you owe your Prince. You are of a family that has sacrificed their all for him. As for the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsons on whom you depend, the first merit is to please.</P>
<P>In subaltern employments you have no way to support yourself but by being agree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble: Masters are just like mistresses; whatever services you have done them, they cease to love you as soon as you cease to please them.</P>
<P>There are various sorts of dignity, and they re¦quire as various kinds of respect.</P>
<P>There are real and personal dignities, and there are dignities of institution: There is always a re∣spect due to persons in elevated stations, but it is merely an outward respect: Our real respect and esteem is due only to merit. When fortune and virtue have concurred to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise a man to a high post, there is a double empire in the case, which
<PB N="113" REF="025064_0119_0FCE491976E04B48"/>
commands a double submission; but let not the glittering of grandeu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dazzle and impose upon you.</P>
<P>There are some mean souls that are always crouch∣ing and grovelling before grandeur. One ought to separate the man from the dignity, and see what he is when he is stripped of it. There is another great∣ness very different from that which power and autho∣rity give. 'Tis neither birth nor riches that distin∣guish men; the only real and true superiority among them is merit.</P>
<P>The character of an honest man is a nobler ti∣tle than any that fortune can bestow. In subal∣tern posts one is necessarily dependent: one must make one's court to the ministers, but it must be made with dignity. I shall never give you any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inging lectures; 'tis your services that should speak for you, and not any unbecoming sub∣missions.</P>
<P>Men of merit, when they make their court to Ministers, do them an honour, but scoun∣drels disgrace them. Nothing is more agreeable than to be a friend of persons of dignity; but what lays the foundation of this friendship, is a desire to please them.</P>
<P>Let your acquaintance be with persons that are above you; you will by that means get a habit of respect and politeness. People are too careless when they converse with their equals; they grow dull for want of exerting their parts.</P>
<P>I do not know whether one may hope to find friends at court. As for persons of eminent dig∣nity, their post exempts them from a great many duties, and covers abundance of their failings. 'Tis good to examine into men to know them
<PB N="114" REF="025064_0120_0FCE491AE2337E40"/>
thoroughly, and see them with their every day's merit about them. The favourites of fortune im∣pose upon you, when you look upon them at a dis∣tance; the distance puts them in a point of view that is favourable to them: Fame always enhances their merit, and flattery deifies them. Examine them near, and you'll find them to be but men. What a number of ordinary creatures do we find at court! To rectify one's notions of greatness, one must view it near; you'll cease immediately either to desire or fear it.</P>
<P>Let not the failings of great men corrupt you, but rather teach you to correct your own. Let the ill use which they make of their estates teach you to despise riches, and keep yourself within bounds. Virtue seldom has the direction of their expences.</P>
<P>Among the infinite number of tastes invented by luxury and sensuality, why has there not been one formed for relieving the miserable? Does not humanity itself make you feel the necessity of assisting your fellow-creatures? Good-natured and generous tempers are more sensible of the ob∣ligation that lies upon them to do good, than they are of all the other necessities of life. Marcus Aurelius thanked the Gods for his having always done good to his friends, without making them wait for it. 'Tis the great felicity of grandeur when others find their fortune in our's:
<Q>I can't (said that Prince) have any relish of a happiness that nobody shares in but myself.</Q></P>
<P>The most exquisite pleasure in nature is to make the pleasure of others; but for this end one must not be too fond of the goods of fortune. Riches never were the parent of virtue, but virtue has often been the cause of riches. What use,
<PB N="115" REF="025064_0121_0FCE491C6024B2E0"/>
too, do the generality of great men make of the glory of their station? They put it all in exterior marks, and in an air of pride. Their dignity sits heavy on them and depresses others; whereas true greatness is humane; it is always easy of access, and condescends even to stoop to you: such as really enjoy it, are at their ease, and make others so too as well as themselves. Their advancement does not cost their any virtue, and the nobleness of their sen∣timents had formed, and in a manner habituated them to it beforehand. Their elevated station seems natur∣al to them, and nobody is a suffer by it.</P>
<P>Titles and dignities are not the bonds that unite us to men, or gain them to us: Without merit and beneficence to recommend our grandeur to them, we have but a precarious tenure of their friendship; and they will only seek to indemni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y themselves at our expence, for the homage which they have been forced to pay to the post, rather than to the man that enjoys it, whom they will not fail to arraign freely, and condemn in his absence. If envy be the motive that makes us love to lessen the good qualities of men in great posts, 'tis a passion we ought to oppose, and ren∣der them the justice that they deserve. We fancy frequently that we have no grudge but against the men, when indeed our malignity is owing to their places: Persons in great posts never yet en∣joyed them with the good liking of the world, which only begins to do them justice when they are out of place. Envy in suite of itself pays a homage to greatness, at the same time that it seems to despise it; for to envy places is to honour them. Let us not out of discontent condemn agreeable stations, which have no fault but that
<PB N="116" REF="025064_0122_0FCE4921680AEA60"/>
we are not in them ourselves.—'Tis time now to pass to the duties of society.</P>
<P>Men have found it necessary as well as agree∣able to unite for the common good: They have made laws to restrain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he wicked; they have agreed amongst themselves as to the duties of society, and have annexed an honourable cha∣racter to the practice of those duties. He is the honest man that observes them with the most exactness, and the instances of them multiply in proportion to the degree and nicety of a person's honour.</P>
<P>Virtues are linked together, and have a sort of alliance with one another: What constitutes a hero is the union of all the virtues. After pre∣scribing the duties necessary for their common security, men set themselves to make their con∣versation agreeable, and settled certain rules of politeness and living to be observed by persons of birth and quality.</P>
<P>There are some failings, against which no pre∣cepts are to be given: There are certain vices that are unknown to men of honour. Probity, fidelity in keeping one's word, and a love of truth, are subjects that I think I need not insist on, and recommend to you: You know that a man of honour knows not what it is to tell a lie. What eulogiums does not the world give, and give deservedly, to lovers of truth: The man, say they, that does good and speaks truth, resembles the Deity, whose essential properties are goodness and truth. We are not indeed ob∣liged always to speak what we think, but we must always think what we speak. The true use of speech is to promote truth. When a man has acquired a reputation for veracity, his word
<PB N="117" REF="025064_0123_0FCE49226447F2D8"/>
is taken implicitly; it has all the authority of an oath, and the world receives what he says with a sort of religious respect.</P>
<P>Falshood in actions is full as inconsistent with a love of truth as falshood in words. Men of honour are never false; what indeed have they to disguise? Nor are they fond of shewing themselves, because, sooner or later, true merit will make its way.</P>
<P>Remember that the world will sooner pardon you your failings, than the affectation of pretending to virtues which you have not in reality. False∣hood affects to put on the air of truth, but a false man's professions go no further than his looks and discourses; whereas a man of veracity's are made good by his actions. It has been said a long time ago, that hypocrisy is an homage which vice pays to virtue: But the principal virtues are not of themselves sufficient to qualify a man to please; he must have likewise agreeable and engaging qualities.</P>
<P>When one aims at gaining a great reputation, one is always in a state of dependence on the opinion of others. It is very difficult for a man to rise to ho∣nours by his services, unless he has friends to set them forth, and a manner of behaviour proper to recom∣mend them.</P>
<P>I have told you already, that in subaltern posts a man can't support himself but by a knack of pleasing; as soon as ever he is neglected, he be∣comes from that moment inconsiderable: There is nothing so disagreeable as to shew a too great fondness for one's self, and expose one's vanity, so as to make people see that we like ourselves above all the world, and that every thing centers in us.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="025064_0124_0FCE4923E37D3098"/>A man with a great deal of wit may make him∣self very disagreeable, when he only employs it to find out the failings of others, and expose them publicly. As for this sort of men who only shew their wit at other people's expence, they ought to consider that no body's life is so perfectly without a blemish, as to give him a right to censure another man's.</P>
<P>Rallery makes a part of the amusements of conversation, but is a very nice matter to manage. Persons that want to traduce, and love to rally, have a secret malignity in their heart. The most agreeable rallery in nature gives offence, if it advances a step too far; so easy is the transition from the one to the other. A false friend often abuses the liberty of banter, and reflects upon you: In all cases of this nature, the person that you attack has the sole right of judging whether you are in jest or no; the moment that he takes offence, it ceases to be rallery; 'tis a downright affront.</P>
<P>Rallery should never be used but with regard to failings of so little consequence, that the per∣son concerned may be merry on the subject him∣self. Nice rallery is a decent mixture of praise and reproach; it touches slightly upon little fail∣ings, only to dwell the more upon great qualities. Monsieur de la Rochefoucault says, that
<Q>the man who dishonours another, does less mischief than he that ridicules him:</Q>
I should be of his opinion for this reason, that it is not in any body's power to dishonour another; 'tis not the discourse or reflections of others; 'tis only our own conduct that can dishonour us. The causes of dishonour are known and certain, but ridicule is entirely arbitrary: It depends on the manner
<PB N="119" REF="025064_0125_0FCE4925B83D6660"/>
how objects appear to us, and on our manner of thinking and taking them. There are some people that may be said to wear always spectacles of ridi∣cule, and see every thing through them: 'tis not so much the fault of objects as the fault <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersons that view them in such a light: This is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that such persons as appear ridiculous in cert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpanies, would be admired in others, where there are men of sense and merit.</P>
<P>A man's humour too contributes much to the making him agreeable or otherwise; dark and sour humours, that have a spice of malevolence in them, are vastly disagreeable.</P>
<P>Humour is the disposition with which the soul re∣ceives the impression of objects; good-natured tem∣pers take nothing ill; their indulgence is of benefit to others, and supplies them with what they want in themselves.</P>
<P>The generality of mankind imagine, that it is to no purpose to attempt to correct their humour; they say 'I was born so,' and fancy this excuse is enough to justify their not taking any pains about it. Such tempers must infallibly displease; men owe you nothing, any farther than you are agreeable to them. The way to be so is to forget one's self, to put others upon subjects which they like, to make them pleased with themselves, to set them out with advantage, and allow them the good qualities which others dis∣pute their having. They believe you give them what the world does not allow them: Their merit seems in some sort to be of your creation, whilst you exalt them in the opinion of others: But this is ne∣ver to be pushed so far as to commence flattery.</P>
<P>Nothing pleases so much as sensible tender persons trying to make a friendship with others.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="025064_0126_0FCE4926E04C9DA0"/>Take care to carry yourself in such a manner, that your behaviour may at once make a tender of your own friendship, and invite the friendship of others. You can never be an amiable man without knowing how to be a friend, without a taste and knowledge of friendship. 'Tis this corrects the vi∣ces of society; it softens the roughness of people's natures; it brings down their vanity, and makes them know themselves. All the obligations of ho∣nour are included in the obligations of perfect friend∣ship.</P>
<P>In the hurry and bustle of the world, take care, my son, to have a sure friend to whisper truth to your soul: Be always ready to hear the ad∣vice of your friends. The owning of faults is no hard matter for persons that find a fund within them∣selves to mend them: Think that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u have never done enough, when you find that you can still do better. No body takes a reproof so kindly as he that deserves most to be commended. If you are happy enough to find a true friend, you have found a treasure; his reputation will secure your own: He will answer for you to yourself; he will alleviate all your troubles, and multiply all your pleasures. But if you would deserve a friend, you must know how to be one.</P>
<P>All the world is complaining of the want of friends, and yet scarce any body gives himself the trouble of bringing the necessary dispositions to gain and preserve them. Young men have their companions, but they very rarely have any friends: Pleasures are what unite them, but plea∣sures are not ties worthy of friendship. I do not pretend to make a dissertation on this subject; I only touch slightly on some duties of civil life: I refer you to your own heart, which will put
<PB N="121" REF="025064_0127_0FCE492A109C4DD8"/>
you upon desiring a friend, and make you feel the necessity of having one. I depend upon the nice∣ness of your sentiments to instruct you in the duties of friendship.</P>
<P>If you would be perfectly an honest man, you must think of keeping yourself within bounds, and placing it on a good object. Honesty con∣sists in waiving one's own rights, and paying a re∣gard to those of others. If you set up to be hap∣py alone, you will never be so; all the world will dispute your happiness with you: but if you are for making the world happy as well as yourself every body will assist you. All vices whatever flatter self-love, and all the virtues agree to at∣tack it; valour exposes it; modesty lowers it; generosity throws it away; moderation mortifies it; and zeal for the public sacrifices it to the good of society.</P>
<P>Self-love is a preferring of one's self to others▪ as honesty is the preferring of others to one's self. There are two kinds of self-love; the one natu∣ral, lawful, and regulated by justice and reason; the other vicious and corrupt. Our first object is certainly ourselves; 'tis only reflection that calls us back to justice. We don't know how to love ourselves; we either carry our self-love too high, or exercise it improperly. To love one's self as one ought is to love virtue; to love vice is to strike in with a blind and mistaken love.</P>
<P>We have sometimes seen persons advance them∣selves by ill ways; but if vice is preferred, it is not for any length of time; corrupt persons ruin themselves by the very means, and with the same principles that raised them. If you would be happy with security, you must be so with inno∣cence.
<PB N="122" REF="025064_0128_0FCE492B60D64BB8"/>
There is no power sure and lasting but that of virtue.</P>
<P>There are some amiable tempers that have a fine and natural congruity with virtue: Those to whom nature has not been so bountiful must be watchful over their conduct, and know their true interest, to be able to correct an evil disposition. Thus the un∣derstanding rectifies the heart.</P>
<P>The love of esteem is the life and soul of so∣ciety; it unites us to one another: I want your ap∣probation, you stand in need of mine. By forsaking the converse of men, we forsake the virtues necessary for society; for when one is alone, one is apt to grow negligent; the world forces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have a guard over yourself.</P>
<P>Politeness is the most necessary quality for con∣versation; 'tis the art of employing the exterior marks of breeding, which after all gives us no assur∣ance of a man's inward qualities. Politeness is an imitation of honesty, and shews a man in his out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>side, such as he ought to be within; it discovers itself in every thing, in his air, in his discourse, and in his ac∣tions.</P>
<P>There is politeness of understanding, and a polite∣ness of manners: That of the understanding consists in saying curious and ingenious things; that of man∣ners, in saying things of a flattering nature, and an agreeable turn.</P>
<P>I do not confine politeness to that intercourse of civilities and compliments, which is settled by common use; they are made without meaning, and received without any sense of obligation: People are apt to over-do the matter in this sort of intercourse, and abate of it upon expe∣rience.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="025064_0129_0FCE492D2A4B2DD0"/>Politeness is a desire to please the persons with whom we are obliged to live, and to behave our∣selves in such a manner, that all the world may be satisfied with us▪ our superiors with our respects; our equals with our esteem; and our inferiors with our kindness and condescension. In a word, it consists in a care to please, and say what is proper to every body. It sets out their good qualities; it makes them sensible that you acknowledge their superiority; when you know how to exalt them, they will set you out in their turn; they will give you the same preference to others, which you are pleased to give them to yourself, their self love obliges them to do so.</P>
<P>The way to please is not to display your supe∣riority; 'tis to conceal it from being perceived. There is a great deal of judgement in being po∣lite; but the world will excuse you at an easier rate.</P>
<P>The generality of people require only certain manners that please: if you have them not, you must make up the defect with the number of your good qualities. There must be a great deal of merit to get over a clownish awkward behaviour. Ne∣ver let the world see that you are fond of your own person: A polite man never finds time to talk of himself.</P>
<P>You know what sort of politeness is necessary to be observed to the women. At present it looks as if the young men had made a vow not to practise it, 'tis a sign of a careless education.</P>
<P>Nothing is more shameful than a voluntary rudeness; but let them do their worst, they can never rob the women of the glory of having formed the finest gentlemen of the last age. 'Tis
<PB N="124" REF="025064_0130_0FCE492E6A8ADE80"/>
to them that they owed all the complaisance of behaviour, the delicacy of inclinations, and the fine gallantry of wit and manners which were then remarkable.</P>
<P>At present, indeed, exterior gallantry seems to be banished; the manners of the world are differ∣ent, and every body has lost something by the change; the women the desire of pleasing, which was the source of their charms; and the men the complaisance and fine politeness, which is only to be acquired in their conversation. The generality of men fancy that they owe them neither probity nor fidelity: it looks as if they had a licence to betray them, without affecting their honour. Who∣ever would think fit to examine into the motives of such a conduct, would find them very scanda∣lous. They are faithful to one another, because they are afraid, and know they shall be called to an account; but they are false to the women without fear of suffering, and without remorse. This shews their probity to be only forced, to be rather the effect of fear than the love of justice: and accordingly, if we examine close into such as make a trade of gallantry, we shall find them fre∣quently to be men of no honour; they contract ill habits; their manners are corrupted: they grow indifferent to truth, and indulge themselves in their habitual neglect of their word and oaths.</P>
<P>What a trade is this! where the least ill thing that you do, is to seduce the women from their duty, to dishonour some, to make others des∣pera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, where a sure calamity is oftentimes all the recompence of a sincere and constant af∣fection.</P>
<P>The men have no reason to find so much fault with the women; for it is by them that they lose
<PB N="125" REF="025064_0131_0FCE49310C3686A0"/>
their innocence. If we except some women that seem destined to vice from their cradle, the rest would live in a regular practice of their duty, if the men did not take pains to turn them from it: but, in short, 'tis their business to be on their guard against them. You know that it is never allowable to dishonour them; if they have had the weakness to trust you with their honour, 'tis a confidence that you ought not to abuse. You owe it to them, if you have reason to be satisfied with them; you owe it to yourself, if you have reason to compain of them. You know, too that by the laws of honour you must fight with equal weapons; you ought not therefore to expose a wo∣man to dishonour for her amour, since she can never expose you for yours.</P>
<P>I must, however, caution you against incurring their hatred; it is violent and implacable. There are some offences which they never pardon, and people run a greater risk than they imagine, in wounding their honour; the less their resentment breaks out, the more terrible is it; by being held in, it grows the fiercer. Have no quarrel with a sex that knows so well how to resent and revenge themselves; and the rather, because the women make the reputation of the men, as the men make that of the women.</P>
<P>'Tis a happy talent, but very rarely to be met with, to know how to manage the point of praise, to give it agreeably and with justice. The morose man does not know how to praise▪ his judgement is spoiled by his temper. The flatter, by prai∣sing too much, ruins his own credit, and does ho∣nour to nobody. The vain man deals out his praises only to receive others in return; he shews too plainly that he praises merely out of affecta∣tion.
<PB N="126" REF="025064_0132_0FCE49321FF939F8"/>
Shallow understandings esteem every thing, because they know not the value of things: they cannot make either their esteem or contempt pass in the world. The envious wretch praises no∣body, for fear of putting others on a level with himself. An honest man praises in the right place: he feels more pleasure in doing justice, than in raising his own reputation by lessening that of others. Persons that reflect, and are nice upon this article, are very sensible of all these differences. If you would have your praises of any body be of service to you, always praise out of the regard you have for others, and not out of any regard to yourself.</P>
<P>One should know how to live with one's com∣petitors; there is nothing more common than to wish to raise one's self above them, or to try to ruin them: But there is a much nobler conduct; 'tis never to attack them, and always strive to exceed them in merit; 'tis a handsome action to yield them the place which you think is due to them.</P>
<P>An honest man chuses rather to neglect his own fortune, than to fail in a point of justice. Dispute about glory with yourself, and strive to acquire new virtues, and to improve the merit of those which you have already.</P>
<P>One must be very cautious in the article of re∣venge; it is often of use to make one's self fear∣ed; but it is almost always dangerous to revenge one's self. There is not a greater weakness than to do all the mischief that we can. The best manner of revenging an injury is not to imitate the person that did it. 'Tis a fight worthy of honesty men to oppose patience to passion, and moderation to justice. An extravagant hatred
<PB N="127" REF="025064_0133_0FCE4933A1E77568"/>
puts you beneath the persons you hate. Do not justify your enemies; do nothing that can excuse them; they do us less mischief than our own faults. Little souls are cruel, but clemency is the virtue of great men. Caesar said, that
<Q>the most agreeable fruit of his victories was the having it in his power to give people their lives who had attempted his own.</Q>
There is nothing more glorious and exquisite than this kind of re∣venge: 'tis the only one that men of honour al∣low themselves to take. As soon as your ene∣my repents and makes his submission, you lose all manner of right to revenge.</P>
<P>The generality of mankind bring nothing into the intercourse of life but their weakness, which serves for society. Honest men form an intimacy by their virtues, the ordinary sort of men by their pleasures, and villains by their crimes.</P>
<P>Good-fellowship and gaming have their excess and their dangers: Love has others peculiar to itself; there is no playing always with beauty; it sometimes commands imperiously. There is nothing more shameful in a man than excessive drinking, and drawing his reason, which ought to be the guide of his life. To give up one's self to voluptuousness is to degrade one's nature. The surest way to avoid it is not to grow familiar with it; one would think the voluptuous man's soul was a charge to him.</P>
<P>As for gaming, 'tis the destruction of all deco∣rum. The prince forgets his dignity at it, and the woman her modesty. Deep play carries with it all the social vices. They rendezvous at certain hours to hate and ruin one another; 'tis a great trial of probity; and few people have preserved theirs unspotted in a course of gaming.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="025064_0134_0FCE493522600C80"/>The most necessary disposition to relif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plea∣sures, is to know how to be without them. Sen∣sual pleasure is out of the way of reasonable per∣sons. Let your pleasures be ever so great, re∣member still to expect some melancholy affair to disturb them, or some vexatious one to end them.</P>
<P>Wisdom makes use of the love of glory to guard against the meanness into which sensuality hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries a man. But one must set to work be∣times to keep one's self free from passions; they may in the beginning be under command, but they domineer at last: They are more easy to be overcome than satisfied.</P>
<P>Keep yourself from envy, 'tis the lowest and most shameful passion in the world; it is always disowned. Envy is the shadow of glory, as glory is the shadow of virtue. The gratest sign that a man is born with great qualities is to say, that he has no envy in his nature.</P>
<P>A man of quality can never be amiable with∣out liberality. The covetous man cannot fail of being disagreeable. He has within him an ob∣stacle to all virtues: he has neither justice nor humanity. When once a man gives up himself to avarice, he renounces glory: it is said, there have been illustrious villains, but that there never were any illustrious misers.</P>
<P>Though liberality is a gift of nature, yet if we had a disposition to the contrary vice, we might by good sense and reflection correct it.</P>
<P>The covetous man enjoys nothing. Money has been said to be a good servant, though an ill master: but it is good on account of the use we can make of it.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="025064_0135_0FCE4937DAA939D0"/>The covetous wretch is more tormented than the poor man. The love of riches is the root of all vices, as disinterestedness is the first principle of all virtues.</P>
<P>Riches must be immense, in order to be enti∣tled to the first place among the goods of life: they are indeed the first object of the desires of the greatest part of mankind; yet virtue, glory, and a great reputation, are vastly preferable to all the gifts of fortune.</P>
<P>The most sensible pleasure of honest men is to do good, and relieve the miserable. What a wide difference is there between having a little more money, or losing it for one's diversion, and the parting with it in exchange for the reputation of goodness and generosity? 'Tis a sacrifice that you make to your glory. Deny yourself some∣thing to lay up a fund for your liberality; 'tis an excellent point of oeconomy, which naturally tends to advance you, and gain you a good cha∣racter.</P>
<P>A great reputation is a great treasure. We must not imagine that a great fortune is necessary to enable one to do good; all the world can do it in their several stations, with a little attention to themselves, and others; fix this inclination in your heart, and you'll find wherewith to gratify it: occasions enough offer themselves before you, and there are but too many unhappy persons that soli∣cit you.</P>
<P>Liberality distinguishes itself in the manner of giving. The liberal man doubles the merit of a present by the good-will with which he makes it: the covetous wretch spoils it by his regret at part∣ing with it. Liberality never ruined any body. Families are not raised by avarice, but they are
<PB N="130" REF="025064_0136_0FCE493A63620390"/>
supported by justice, moderation, and integrity. Liberality is one of the duties of a noble birth. When you do good, you only pay a debt; but still prudence is to govern you in such cases; the prin∣ciples of profuseness are not shameful, but the conse∣quences of it are dangerous.</P>
<P>There are few men know how to live with their inferiors. The great opinion that we entertain of ourselves makes us look upon all below us as a distinct species; but how contrary are such sen∣timents to humanity! If you would raise your∣self a great name, you must be affable and easy of access; your military profession gives you no dispensation in this point. Germanicus was adored by his soldiers. To learn what they thought of him, he walked one evening through his camp, and overheard what they said at their little meals, where they take upon them to pass their judgment on their general; 'he went says Tacitus) to enjoy his reputation and glory.'</P>
<P>You must command by example, rather than authority: Admiration forces men to imitation much sooner than command: To live at your ease, and treat your soldiers harshly, is to be their Tyrant, and not their General.</P>
<P>Consider with what view authority was first instituted, and in what manner it should be exer∣cised; 'tis virtue, and the natural respect which the world pays to it, that made men consent to obedience. You are an usurper of authority, if you do not possess it upon that sooting. In an empire where reason shall govern, all the world should be on a level, and no distinction be paid but to virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="025064_0137_0FCE493BE0394868"/>Humanity itself suffers by the vast difference that fortune has put between one man and an∣other. 'Tis not any dignity or haughtiness, but your merit, that should distinguish you from the vulgar. Consider the advantages of a noble birth and high station only as goods which fortune lends you, and not as distinctions an∣nexed to your person, and that make a part of yourself. If your quality raises you above the or∣dinary world, think how much you have in com∣mon with other men by your weaknesses, which confound you with them: let justie then stop the motions of your pride, which would distinguish you from them.</P>
<P>Know that the first laws which you ought to obey are those of humanity: Remember that you are a man, and that you command over men. When the son of Marcus Aurelius lost his preceptor, the courtiers found fault with him for weeping on that occasion. Marcus Aurelius said to them,
<Q>Allow my son to be a Man, before he comes to be an Emperor.</Q></P>
<P>Forget always what you are, when humanity re∣quires it of you; but never forget it when true glory calls upon you to remember it. In fine, if you have any authority, use it only for the happi∣ness of othes. Admit them near you, if you are great yourself, instead of keeping them at a distance: never make them feel their inferiority; and live with them as you would have your supe∣riors live with you.</P>
<P>The greatest p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of mankind do not know how to live with themselves: all their care is ra∣ther how to get rid of themselves, and they spend their time in seeking for happiness in exterior ob∣jects. You should, if it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e possible, fix your felicity within yourself, and find in your own
<PB N="132" REF="025064_0138_0FCE493F0BCCDFC0"/>
breast an equivalent for the advantages which fortune denies you: you will be more easy as to them; but it must be a principle of reason that brings you thus to yourself, and not an aversion for mankind.</P>
<P>You love solitude; they reproach you with be∣ing too private; I do not find fault with your taste, but you must not let the social virtues suffer from it. Retire into yourself, says Marcus Au∣relius; practise often this retreat of the soul, you will improve yourself by it. Have some maxim to call up your reason, and fortify your principles upon occasion. Your retirement makes you acquainted with good authors; ju∣dicious men do not croud their minds indiffer∣en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly with all sorts of learning, but choose their subject.</P>
<P>Take care that your studies influence your man∣ners, and that all the profit of your reading be turned to virtue. Try to find out the first prin∣ciples of things, and do not subject yourself ser∣villey to the opinions of the vulgar.</P>
<P>Your ordinary reading should be history, but always use reflection with it. If you only think of filling your memory with facts and polishing your mind with the thoughts and opinions of the ancients, you will only lay up a magazine of other people's notions: one quarter of an hour's reflection improves and forms the mind more than a great deal of reading. A want of learning is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much to be dreaded, as error and false jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ments.</P>
<P>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on is the guide that leads to truth; con∣sider facts only as authorities to support reason, or as subjects to exercise it.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="025064_0139_0FCE494061FA41E8"/>History will instruct you in your business; but after you have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wn from it all the advantage proper for your prefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a moral use to be made of it, which is of much greater conse∣quence to you.</P>
<P>The first science of man is human nature▪ Leave politics to Ministers, and wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> belongs to grandure to Princes; but do you find out the man in the prince; observe him in one course of common life; see how low he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks when he gives himself up to his passions. An irregular conduct is always followed with dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> consequence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>To study history is to study the passions and opinions of men: 'tis to examine them thorough∣ly; 'tis to pull the mask of their actions, which appeared great whilst they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ited, and con∣secrated as it were by success, but often become contemptible when the motive of them is known. There is nothing more ambiguous than the ac∣tions of men. We must trace them up to their principles if we would know them rightly. 'Tis necessary to be sure of the spirit of our actions before we glory in them.</P>
<P>We do little good, and a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deal of ill; and have the knack too of spoiling and depraving the little good that we do.</P>
<P>See Princes in history, and elsewhere, as so many actors on the stage; they no way concern you, but by the qualities which we have in com∣mon with them. This is so true, that such his∣torians as have set themselves to describe them rather as men than kings, and shew them to us in their private life, give us the most pleasure: we find ourselves out in them: we love to see our own weaknesses in great men. This con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oles us in some measure for our own lowness, and raises as in
<PB N="134" REF="025064_0140_0FCE494209A68908"/>
some sort to their elevation. In short, consi∣der a history as a register of times and a picture of manners; you may discover yourself there, without any offence to your vanity.</P>
<P>I shall exhort you, my son, rather to take pains with your heart, than to improve your under∣standing; that ought to be the great study of your life. The true greatness of man lies in the heart; it must be elevated by aspiring to great things, and by daring to think ourselves worthy of them. 'Tis as becoming to encourage a little vanity within one's self, as it is ridiculous to shew it to others.</P>
<P>Take care to have thoughts and sentiments worthy of you. Virtue raises the dignity of man, and vice degrades him. If one was un∣happy enough to want an honest heart, one ought for one's own interest to correct it: nothing makes a man truly valuable but his heart, and nothing but that can make him happy; since our happiness depends only on the nature of our in∣clinations. If they are such as lead you to trifling passions, you will be the sport of their vain attachments: they offer you
<Q>flowers; but always (as Montaigne says) mistrust the trea∣chery of your pleasures.</Q></P>
<P>We must not indulge ourselves long in things that please us; the moment that we give our∣selves up to them, we lay the foundation of our sorrows. The generality of mankind employ the first part of their life in making the rest of it miserable. You must not abandon reason in your pleasures, if you would find it again in your troubles.</P>
<P>In short, keep a strict guard over your heart; it is the source of innocence and happiness. You
<PB N="135" REF="025064_0141_0FCE4943F73D9A00"/>
will not pay too dear for the freedom of your mind and heart, though you purchase it by the sacrifice of your pleasures, as was the saying of an ingenious ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Never expect then to recon∣cile sensuality, with glory, or the charm of volup∣tuousness with the recompence of virtue. How∣ever, when you bid adieu to pleasures, you will find in other things satisfaction enough to make you amends. There are various sorts of it: Glory and truth have their pleasures; they are the delights of the soul and heart.</P>
<P>Learn likewise to reverence and stand in awe of yourself. The foundation of happiness is laid in the peace of the mind, and secret testimony of the conscience. By the word conscience, I mean the inward sense of a nice honour, which assures you that you have nothing to reproach yourself with. Again, how happy is it to know how to live with one's self, to renew your acquaintance there with pleasure, and quit yourself for a time with regret! The world then indeed is less necessary to you; but take care it does not make you out of hu∣mour with it. One must not entertain an aversion for men; they will desert you when you desert them: You have still occasion for them; you are not either of an age or profession to do without them; but when one knows how to live one's self as well as with the world, they are two plea∣sures that support one another.</P>
<P>A passion for glory may contribute greatly to your advancement and happiness; but it may likewise make you unhappy and dispicable, if you know not how to govern it: 'tis the most active and lasting of all our inclinations. The love of glory is the last passion that quits us; but we must not confound it with vanity. Vanity aims
<PB N="136" REF="025064_0142_0FCE494623D16F00"/>
at the approbation of other people; true glory at the secret testimony of the conscience. Endea∣vour to gratify the passion that you have for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, make sure of this inward testimony; your tri∣bunal is seated in your own breast, why then should you seek it elsewhere? You can always be a judge of your own worth. Let men dis∣pute your good qualities if they please; as they do not know you, you can easily console your∣self. It is not of so much consequence to be thought an honest man, as to be one. Such as do not mind the approbation of other people, but only aim at deserving it, take the surest way to obtain both. What affinity is there between the greatness of man, and the littleness of the things which make the subject of his glorying? There is nothing so ill suited as his dignity and the va∣nity that he derives from an infinite number of trifling things: a glory so ill-grounded shews a great want of merit. Persons that are truly great are not subject to the infatuations of vain∣glory.</P>
<P>One must, if it be possible, my son be content with one's condition in the world: there is nothing more rare and valuable than to find persons that are satisfied with it. 'Tis our own fault. There is no condition of life so bad, but it has one good side. Every situation has its point of view; we should place it in that favourable light, and shall find that it is not the fault of our situations, but purely our own. We have much more rea∣son to complain of our own temper than of for∣tune. We lay all the blame upon events, when all the fault lies upon our own discontent; the evil is within us, let us not seek for it any where else. By qualifying our temper, we often change
<PB N="137" REF="025064_0143_0FCE49478EA40430"/>
our fortune. It is much easier for us to adjust ourselves to things, than to adjust things to our∣selves. A great application to find out a remedy frequently irritates the disease, and the imagina∣tion conspires with the pain to increase and for∣tify it. A dwelling upon misfortunes renews them, by making them present to the mind. An useless struggling to get out of our circumstances, makes us slower in contracting an acqaintance with them, which would make them sit easy on us. One must always give way to misfortunes; have recourse to patience: 'tis the only way to alleviate them.</P>
<P>If you would do yourself justice, you will be content with your situation. I dare say, that after the loss we have suffered, if you had another mother you would be still fuller of complaints. Reflect on the advantages of your condition, and you will be less sensible of the difficulties of it. A wise man, in the same circumstances with others, has more advantages, and feels fewer inconveniencies than they.</P>
<P>You may depend upon it that there is no con∣dition, but has its troubles; 'tis the situation of human life; there is nothing pure and unblended in it. 'Tis to pretend to exempt one's self from the common law of our nature to expect a con∣stant happiness. The very persons that you think the happiest would hardly appear so to you, if you knew the exact situation of their fortune or their heart. Those that are raised the highest are frequently the most unhappy. With great em∣ployments and vulgar maxims one is always restless and uneasy: 'tis not places, but reason that removes anxiety from the mind. If you are
<PB N="138" REF="025064_0144_0FCE4948B398E490"/>
wise, fortune can neither increase nor diminish your happiness.</P>
<P>Judge by yourself, and not by the opinions of others. Misfortunes and disorders arise from false judgments, false judgments from our passions, and passions from our conversation with mankind; you always come from them more perfect than you were before. To weaken the impression that they make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon you, and to moderate your desires and inquie∣tudes, consider that time is continually running away with your pains as well as your pleasures; that every moment, young as you are, carries off a part of yourself, that all things are perpetually sinking into the abyss of past time, thence never to return again.</P>
<P>All that you see greatest on earth meets with the very same treatment as yourself. The ho∣nours, the dignities, the precedences settled among men, are mere shows and ceremonies, without any reality; do not imagine that they are qualities in∣separable from their being. Thus ought you to con∣sider such as are above you; but take in your view likewise an infinite number of miserable wretches that are below you: the difference between you and them is owing only to chance, but pride and the great opinion we have of ourselves make us think that the good condition we are in is no more than our due, and consider every thing that we do not enjoy as a robbery of what should belong to us: you cannot but see plainly that nothing is more unreasonable than such an imagination. Enjoy, my son, the ad∣vantages of your circumstances; but suffer patiently the inconveniencies that attend them: Consider that wherever there are men, there are unhappy creatures. Enlarge your mind, if possible, so far as to foresee and know all the accidents that can befall you. In a word, remember that a man's happiness depends
<PB N="139" REF="025064_0145_0FCE494A21CA3908"/>
on his manners and conduct; but the highest felicity is to seek for it in the paths of innocence, and there one never fails to find it.</P>

<HEAD>LORD BURGHLEY's TEN PRECEPTS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SON ROBERT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE virtuous inclination of thy matchless mother, by whose tender and goldly care thy infancy was governed, together with thy education under so zealous and excellent a tutor, puts me in rather assurance than hope, that you are not ignorant of that <HI>summum bonum,</HI> which is only able to make thee happy as well in thy death as life; I mean, the true knowledge and worship of thy Creator and Redeemer, without which all other things are vain and miserable: so that, thy youth being guided by so sufficient a teacher, I make no doubt but he will furnish thy life with divine and moral documents. Yet, that I may not cast off the care beseeming a pa∣rent towards his child, or that you shouldest have cause to derive thy whole felicity and wel∣fare rather from others, than from whence thou receivedst thy breath and being, I think it fit and agreeable to the affection I bear thee, to help thee with such rules and advertisements for the squaring of thy life, as are rather gained by ex∣perience than by much reading; to the end that entering into this exorbitant age, thou mayest be
<PB N="144" REF="025064_0148_0FCE494EA37F6318"/>
the better prepared to shun those scandalous courses whereunto the world, and the lack of experience, may easily draw thee. And because I will not con∣found thy memory▪ I have reduced them in Ten Precepts; and, next unto Moses' Tables, if thou imprint them in thy mind, thou shalt reap the benefit, and I the content. And they are these following:</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="precept">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN it shall please God to bring thee to man's estate, use great providence and circum∣spection in chusing thy wife; for from thence will spring all thy future good or evil: and it is an ac∣tion of life, like unto a stratagem of war, where∣in a man can err but once. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy estate be good, match near home and at leisure; if weak, far off and quickly. Enquire diligently of her disposi∣tion, and how her parents have been inclined in their youth. Let her not be poor, how generous soever; for a man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Nor choose a base and uncomely creature altogether for wealth; for it will cause contempt in others, and loathing in thee. Nei∣ther make choice of a dwarf, or a fool; for by the one thou shalt beget a race of pigmies, the other will be thy continual disgrace; and it will irke thee to hear her talk; for thou shalt find it to thy great grief, that there is nothing more fulsome than a she-fool.</P>
<P>And, touching the guiding of thy house, let thy hospitality be moderate; and, according to the means of thy estate, rather plentiful than sparing, but not costly; for I never knew any man grow poor by keeping an orderly table.
<PB N="145" REF="025064_0149_0FCE4953311A86B0"/>
But some consume themselves through secret vices, and their hospitality bears the blame. But ba∣nish swimish drunkards out of thine house, which is a vice imparing health, consuming much, and makes no show. I never heard praise ascribed to the drunkard, but for the well-bearing of his drink; which is a better commendation for a brewer's horse or a dray-man, than for either a gentleman or a serving-man. Beware thou spend not above three or four parts of thy revenues, nor above a third part of that in thy house; for the other two parts will do no more than defray thy extraordinaries, which always surmount the or∣dinary by much: otherwise thou shalt live, like a rich beggar, in continual want. And the needy man can never live happily nor contentedly; for every disaster makes him ready to mortgage or sell; and that gentleman who sells an acre of land sells an ounce of credit: for gentility is nothing else but ancient riches; so that if the foundation shall at any time sink, the building must need follow. So much for the First Pre∣cept.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="precept">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>BRING thy children up in learning and obe∣dience, yet without outward austerity. Praise them openly, reprehend them secretly. Give them good countenance and convenient mainte∣nance according to thy ability, otherwise thy life will seem their bondage; and what portion thou shalt leave them at thy death, they will thank Death for it, and not thee. And I am persuaded that the foolish cockering of some parents, and the over-stern carriage of others, causeth more men and women to take ill courses, than their own vicious inclinations. Marry thy daughters
<PB N="146" REF="025064_0150_0FCE4954A7DA8F78"/>
in time, lest they marry themselves. And suffer not thy sons to pass the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps; for they shall learn nothing there but pride, blasphemy, and atheism: and if by travel they get a few broken languages, that shall profit them nothing more than to have one meat served in divers dishes. Neither, by my consent, shalt thou train them up in wars; for he that sets up his rest to live by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fession, can hardly be an honest man or a good christian: besides, it is a science no longer in request than use; for soldiers in peace are like chimneys in summer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="precept">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>LIVE not in the country without corn and cattle about thee; for he that putteth his hand to the purse for every expence of houshold, is like him that keepeth water in a sieve: and what provision thou shalt want, learn to buy it at the best hand; for there is one penny saved in four, betwixt buy∣ing in the need, and when the markets and sea∣sons serve fittest for it. Be not served with kins∣men, or friends, or men intreated to stay; for they expect much, and do little: nor with such as are amorous; for their heads are intoxicated. And keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther too few, than one too many. Feed them well, and pay them with the most; and then thou mayest boldly require service at their hands.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="precept">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>LET thy kindred and allies be welcome to thy house and table. Grace them with thy counte∣nance, and further them in all honest actions; for by these means thou shalt so double the band of nature, as thou shalt find them so many advo∣cates to plead an apology for thee behind thy back. But shake off those glow-worms, I mean parasites and sycoyhants, who will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awn upon thee in thy prosperous hours, but in adverse

Neither borrow money of a neighbour or a friend, but of a stranger; where paying for it, thou shalt hear no more of it; otherwise thou shalt eclipse thy credit, lose thy freedom, and pay as dear as to another. But in borrowing of money be precious of thy word: for he that hath care of keeping days of payment, is lord of another man's purse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="precept">
<HEAD>VI</HEAD>
<P>UUDERTAKE no suit against a poor man with∣out receiving much wrong; for, besides that thou makest him thy compeer, it is a base conquest to triumph where there is small resistance. Neither attempt law against any man before thou be fully resolved that thou hast right on thy side, and then spare not for either money or pains, for a cause or two so followed and obtained, will free thee from suits great part of thy life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="precept">

<P>BE sure to keep some great man thy friend, but trouble him not for trifles. Compliment him often with many, yet small gifts, and of little charge. And if thou hast cause to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tow any great gratuity, let it be something which may be daily in sight; otherwise, in this ambi∣tious age, thou shalt remain like a hop without a pole, live in obscurity, and be made a foot-ball for every insulting companion to sourn at.</P>

<P>TOWARDS thy superiors, be humble, yet ge∣nerous; with thine equals, familiar, yet respec∣tive. Towards thine inferiors shew much huma∣nity, and some familiarity; as to bow the body, stretch forth the hand, and to uncover the head, with such like popular compliments. The first prepares thy way to advancement: the second makes thee known for a man well bred: the third gains a good report, which, once got, is easily kept; for right humanity takes such deep root in the minds of the multitude, as they are more easily gained by unprofitable courtesies than by churlish benefits. Yet I advise thee not to affect or neglect popularity too much. Seek not to be Essex: shun to be Raleigh.</P>

<P>TRUST not any man with thy life, credit, or estate; for it is mere folly for a man to enthrall himself to a friend, as though, occasion being of∣fered, he should not dare to become thine enemy.</P>

<P>BE not scurrilous in conversation, nor satirical in thy jests: the one will make thee unwelcome to all company: the other pulls on quarrels, and gets the hatred of thy best friends: for suspicious justs (when any of them favour of truth) leave a bitterness in the minds of those which are touch∣ed. And albeit I have already pointed at this inclusively, yet I think it necessary to leave it to thee as a special caution; because I have seen many so prone to quip and gird, as they would rather lose their friend than their jest. And if perchance their boiling brain yield a quaint scoff, they will travail to be delivered of it as a woman with child. These nimble fancies are but the froth of wit.</P>
