<HEAD><HI>A Sketch of the Weather, from January to July,</HI> 1798.</HEAD>
<P>THE winter, preceding the spring of 1798, was more severely cold, and the cold continued longer than usual in this winter.</P>
<P>The greatest part of March and April was wet and cold.</P>
<P>From the 4th of May to the 23d, there was no rain, though the wind was generally N. and N. E. and some days disagreeably cold.</P>
<P>24th May, began to rain, and continued wet and cold to the 31st. The wind then changed to S. W. and the weather became warm and fair.</P>
<P>From the 5th to the 14th of June there were dai∣ly showers, some days heavy, and one day loud thun∣der. The ponds became full of water—the roads deep with mud. From the 16th to the 19th, un∣pleasantly cold. From the 19th to the 26th, sul∣try, with frequent showers. 27th, cool, Thermo∣meter only 76 at two P. M. Mark Miller died to∣day, under the care of doctors Wister and Hodge, with symptoms of the Yellow Fever at Mrs. Reeves's in Gallowhill-street. He had been much fatigued and debilitated from loading a vessel at Almond-street wharf, a mile from his lodgings, in the heat of the day, to which he had walked daily for some time. He had, also, according to the account of Mrs. Reeves, slept on the bed in which her son had died of the Fever the preceding Autumn. Dr. Hodge was at this time indisposed with jaundice from a diseased liver.</P>
<P>24th and 30th, fair and pleasant, wind S. E.</P>
<P>The last week of June was remarkably healthy.</P>

<P>ALEXANDER PHILIPS next door neighbour to A. Thompson was attacked with fever accom∣panied with malignant symptoms on the last of July or first of August; died under the care of Dr. Griffitts on the 4th inst., being the 4th or 5th day from the Attack.</P>
<P>Moses Cox at corner of 2d and Spruce, died on the 6th.</P>
<P>John Saunders occupied in the store of Lloyd and Sparks on the wharf a short distance below Walnut St. attacked on the 3d.</P>
<P>Mr. Samuel Russel clerk to Mr. H. Henderson. Mr. John Lawrence. Mr. Morgan's son. Stephen Davis, who lodged next door to Philips's. Mr. Ru∣dolph. A Tobacconist's boy. Mr. Isaac Lloyd, all in the same neighbourhood, with several others whose names I do not recollect, were all taken ill with a fever of a malignant kind within two or three days of each other.</P>
<P>The unusual number of deaths that occurred in the first week of August, alarmed the Citizens and became a topic of general conversation.</P>
<P>The case of a man who had worked on board the Ship Deborah, who died of a fever highly malig∣nant the latter end of July, had been reported by Dr. Proudfit, but being a solitary case had excited but little apprehension.</P>
<P>On the 5th, Achison Thompson's child was at∣tacked with the fever.</P>
<P>The College of Physicians met on the 6th at which time about 26 cases of the fever were all that were known to exist in the city, and after conferring together they unanimously agreed to the following re∣solutions,

<P>"THE ACADEMY OF MEDICINE of Philadelphia, having taken into consideration the existence of a Malignant Bilious Fever in the city, have conceived
<PB N="12" REF="033589_0013_0FF7926C774D0B20"/>
it to be their duty to lay before the Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals, the following facts respecting its origin, and the means of checking its progress.</P>
<P>We have upon inquiry discovered that a case of this fever existed in the city on the 6th of June, and that several cases of it existed in July, in parts of the city remote from the river, and wholly un∣connected with each other. They appeared to originate from the putrid exhalations of alleys and gutters, and docks, and from the stagnating water in the neighbourhood of the city. We derive the late rapid increase of the fever from the foul air of several ships lately arrived in the port, and from some damaged coffee which arrived in a brig from Jamaica on the 29 July. In the course of our in∣quiries into the origin of the fever, we did not meet with a single fact that could support the opi∣nion of contagion being imported in the bodies or cloaths of sick people in the ships or vessels which lie between Walnut and Spruce streets, where the disease has prevailed most. Many respectable mo∣dern authorities assert that the yellow fever is <HI>not contagious</HI> in the West-Indies, and repeated observa∣tions satisfy us that it is rarely so, during the <HI>warm weather</HI> in the United States. None of the cases we have as yet seen have propagated it, and we conceive it to be an error as absurd in its nature as it has been fatal in its operation upon the city of Philadelphia, that the contagion of a disease should adhere to the timber of a ship after a sea voyage, and should spread from the timber of the ship with∣out contact through an extensive neighbourhood, and cease to communicate itself afterwards by long and close connection of the sick with their fami∣lies and attendants. We lament that this fact, to∣gether with many others, upon the nature and ori∣gin
<PB N="13" REF="033589_0014_0FF7926E0D7A41A0"/>
of the yellow fever, which were stated in our letter to the Governor on the 1st of December, 1797, and by him laid before the legislature of the state, have been treated with total neglect in the present health law: the distress we felt upon seeing that law is, however, much alleviated by the re∣flection that we have not contributed, in any de∣gree, by supporting an erroneous opinion, to repro∣duce the present alarming calamity of our city.</P>
<P>We beg leave to recommend for the purpose of checking the progress of the fever, an attention to the following directions:</P>
<P>1st. The removal of all the families from those parts of the city where the disease, from the con∣tamination of the atmosphere, appears chiefly to exist, and the preventing those parts being visited by the citizens.</P>
<P>2dly. The removal of all ships and putrid articles of commerce from the wharves and stores of the city.</P>
<P>3dly. The cleaning of the docks, wharves, yards and cellars; also the washing of the gutters every day, and of the streets and alleys three times a week, by means of pumps and fire engines.</P>
<P>4thly. The appointment of a sufficient number of physicians to take care of such of the poor as may be affected with the fever.</P>
<P>5thly. Publicly to advise the citizens to avoid all the usual exciting causes of fever, such as intem∣perance, fatigue, excessive heat, the night air, all violent and debilitating passions of the mind.</P>

ONE of the Fellows of the College of Physi∣cians of Philadelphia, asserts, that the College is in possession of unequivocal evidence, that the Ma∣lignant Fever, (which is essentially the same as the Yellow Fever of the West Indies) now existing in this city, was brought into it by an infected vessel, lately arrived from the West Indies. The writer of this note has already seen it, in more than one instance, communicated by contagion, at a conside∣rable distance from that part of the city where it first made its appearance. The evidence on which this information is founded will be detailed as soon as health and safety shall be restored to the city.

<P>THE Board of Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals have observed with deep regret the fatal consequences of delay in the applications for medi∣cal aid to persons afflicted with the prevailing ma∣lignant fever, and that the removal of patients to the City Hospital, in many cases, is procrastinated until they are literally sent there to die.</P>
<P>They recommend, in the most earnest manner, the early removal of patients to the City Hospital, where, the public may be assured, that every possible com∣fort and accommodation will be afforded.—The pub∣lic are informed, that the care of patients, and ma∣nagement of the City Hospital, is committed to Doctor Physick and Doctor Cooper, who reside con∣stantly there, and whose professional eminence, it is presumed, will secure a just confidence.</P>
<P>An Apothecary also resides at the Hospital, with an ample store of the best medicines.</P>
<P>The Board consider this recommendation as of the highest importance, and entreat the attention of their fellow-citizens.</P>

<HEAD>THE ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear and Worthy Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sorry to discover by your letter, your want of success in the treatment of our malignant fever at the City Hospital. I do not wonder at it. You seldom see the disease in its first stage, and when you do, you meet it in an aggravated state by the motion your patients undergo in being conveyed to the Hospital.</P>
<P>In answer to your request, I have sat down to in∣form you of the practice which I have adopted in our present epidemic. In the treatment of the yel∣low fever of last year, I have occasionally lamented the loss of patients after reducing the pulse by bleed∣ing, and by the liberal use of purging medicines. I have suspected that death occurred in those cases, from the stagnation of acrid bile in the gall bladder, or its close adherence to the upper bowels in the manner described by Doctor Mitchell in his account of the yellow fever in Virginia, in the year 1741. The slow pulse which occurs about the 4th day, I suspect further to be the effect of this bile. Its ef∣fects in a much more morbid state in the Jaundice,
<PB N="21" REF="033589_0022_0FF792826BBCF9C8"/>
in reducing the pulse, is well known. Mr. John Hunter says he once met with an instance in which it fell to 32 strokes in a minute in that disease. Re∣volving these facts in my mind, I resolved to try to remove this bile by exciting an artificial cholera morbus, about the 4th day of the fever. I was the more disposed to attempt this method of cure, from believing, as I have done for several years, that a cholera morbus is nothing but the first grade of bili∣ous fever thrown in upon the bowels, just as the Dysentery and Diarrhoea are the internal forms of a common bilious or intermitting fever.</P>
<P>I began this mode of treating the fever eight days ago. My solicitude for the issue of it was very great. Thank God it has succeeded to my wishes, and thereby lessened in a great degree, the anxiety and distress which accompany our attendance upon this ferocious disease. The medicines I use for <HI>sha∣king</HI> the gall-bladder and bowels and <HI>discharging</HI> the contents are, tartar emetic, gamboge, jalap and ca∣lomel, combined, or given separately, and in small or large doses, according to circumstances. Perhaps Turpeth Mineral might be added to this list of vo∣miting and purging medicines with advantage. In one case I gave four grains of tartar emetic, and twenty of calomel. It operated freely upwards and downwards, and brought away a large quantity of green and black bile, but without exciting the least cramp or pain in the stomach or bowels. At the time I gave it, death appeared to be creeping upon my patient. The next day he was out of danger. The person thus rescued from the grave, was a son of Mr. Richard Renshaw. Indeed I have not, as yet, lost a single patient to whom I have given this powerful remedy. In one instance I fear it will fail. It is in a boy of 16 years of age, to whom I have gi∣ven near thirty grains of tartar emetic in the course
<PB N="22" REF="033589_0023_0FF792840E1963E8"/>
of a few hours without producing the least evacuati∣on from his stomach or bowels. I have observed the same encrease of strength after its operation, that we observe after bleeding and purging in the begin∣ning of the fever.</P>
<P>Vomits are old remedies in the yellow fever of the West-Indies. I gave them on the first day of the disease in the year 1793, and always without success. They uniformly did harm when given in the begin∣ning of the fever in its worst grade, in 1797. The reason of this failure in their efficacy, I now perceive was because they were given <HI>before</HI> the violent mor∣bid action in the system, was reduced or moderated by bleeding and purging. After this change is in∣duced in the disease, they are perfectly safe. The time for exhibiting them should be regulated by the pulse, and other symptoms. In moderate cases of the fever, they are as proper in its first stage, as on the 4th day. As there is a blistering point in all fe∣vers, so there appears to be an <HI>emetic point</HI> in the yel∣low fever It may occur on the second, and it may be protracted to the sixth or seventh day of the disease. I have not given the medicines I have mentioned in any case where the patient complained of pain or burning in the stomach, but I have considered a nau∣sea, and a moderate degree of puking as no obstacle to it's use, for Dr. Physick has taught me by his dis∣sections, that these symptoms may exist without the least inflammation in the stomach, and that they have been absent where the stomach has appeared after death to have been highly inflamed.</P>
<P>The cure of the fever should not rest upon a single dose of the medicine. I have given two doses of it in a day in several cases, and have given it in one case every day for three successive days.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, that no two epidemics are exactly alike. They vary not only in different
<PB N="23" REF="033589_0024_0FF7928979188808"/>
climates, but in the same climate in different years. They even vary with the changes of the weather in the same season. The fever of 1797 differed in se∣veral particulars from the fever of 1793, and the present epidemic differs materially from both. In many of the cases I have seen, it exceeds the fever of last year in its malignity. These variations in dis∣eases call for corresponding changes in our practice.</P>
<P>I have communicated an account of the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of discharging the contents of the gall-blad∣der and bowels to several of our brethren. I ardent∣ly hope it may be universally successful in their hands.</P>
<P>If any thing new occurs in your practice in the Hospital, do me the favor of informing me of it.</P>
<P>With best wishes for your health and success in your present arduous situation, I am your sincere friend,</P>

<P>I HAVE THEREFORE, with the concurrence of the Commissioners of Health, deemed it incum∣bent to issue this proclamation, hereby forbidding the entrance into the city of Baltimore, or within three miles thereof, of all persons whomsoever, as
<PB N="26" REF="033589_0027_0FF7928F995DFCF0"/>
well as all baggage or other goods, which have come from the city of Philadelphia, until they shall at least have been fifteen days absent therefrom: ex∣cepting only from this restriction, all such persons or goods as may have come from the said city of Phila∣delphia, by land, and shall stop at Merry's tavern, on the Philadelphia road, and be there examined by doctor Joseph Way, and obtain his passport of ad∣mittance. This proclamation to remain in force until public information is given to the contrary, of which all persons concerned are desired to take no∣tice, and govern themselves accordingly.</P>
<P>GIVEN under my hand and the corporate seal of the city of Baltimore, this 18th day of August, 1798.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a letter to the Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals, dated August 20th, 1798.</HEAD>
<OPENER>FOR THE BOARD OF HEALTH.</OPENER>
<P>SINCE my last report, which was on the 15th instant, I have been engaged in attending three per∣sons, with the malignant fever, out of town, the in∣fection of which they appear to have received pre∣vious to their leaving it. Since my return to town, I find the woman who nursed Mr. Douglass's son has been affected with the same disease, though she was salivated from rubbing him with mercurial ointment, and must have received it from him by contagion,
<PB N="27" REF="033589_0028_0FF7929250E89918"/>
as she had never been out of the house for six days previous to the attack.</P>
<P>I also know two persons that have taken the dis∣ease this year who had it last year. A young man at the corner of Second and Lombard streets, who lived in the family of Mr. Cockburn, at the corner of Spruce and Front streets, (who with his wife and a boy lately died in the same house of the existing fe∣ver) and his brother is now in the disease. There are at this time 10 or 12 persons with it in the Alleys near Mr. Hunter's, the druggist, in Second-street. Dr. Paschalis has had five applications since last even∣ing; one, a French jeweller in Second near Chesnut street, Mr. Valence and sister in Spruce-street, &amp;c. Dr. Church is attending two fresh cases in the fami∣ly of Mrs. Roberts, in Christian-street. You need not be reminded of the cases in Race and Vine streets, and in Kensington. In short, the disease is rapidly and sensibly spreading into every part of the city, and can no longer be suppressed till frost arrives to disarm it of its power. If this be the case, (and that it is, past events demonstrate) would it not be advisa∣ble (I mean not to dictate but merely to enquire, from motives of pure and, in the present instance, disinterested humanity) to apprize the citizens which still remain in town, of their danger, and to furnish them with instructions how to escape its destructive ravages?</P>
<P>Advice from you, in your collective capacity, would have the virtue of a law, and would be prompt∣ly obeyed. From an individual it would appear presumptious or at least officious, and instead of ha∣ving the effect intended, would only serve to rouse the demon of envy, or provoke the venom of slan∣der. I submit the matter to your better judgment, and am, with sincere respect, yours, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>From the Philadelphia Gazette, of this date.</HEAD>
<P>The present alarming situation of our city, is alas, truly deplorable—almost in a general state of infecti∣on with the disease, to whose virulence, medicinal skill is lamentably compelled, to acknowledge its in∣feriority! Former experience is rendered in a great measure useless by the very material difference in the nature of the disease—The most copious bleed∣ing, and the most violent purgatives have been found ineffectual; and the success that will attend the new system of emptying the gall-bladder, is at least pro∣blematical. With regard to the opinion of the non-contagion of the disorder, I have very great reason to doubt it. I have known, lately, several instances that could not be accounted for upon any other prin∣ciple than that of contagion. The most striking of the cases I allude to, is, where several of a family, living in a healthy and uninfected part of the city, took the disorder from a person in the family, whom they had for several days closely attended; without having themselves been in any part of the city that could even have been supposed to be infected. I would caution my fellow-citizens not to trust too implicitly to this fatal opinion, which has been so industriously propagated. A confidence in it, in case it should happen to be erroneous, may prove the de∣struction of thousands, while by acting under a disbe∣lief
<PB N="29" REF="033589_0030_0FF792968986F700"/>
of it, and using every possible precaution, as many lives may be preserved. It is at least doubt∣ful whether it is or is not contagious, and there being a doubt, I think the wisest course to be pursued is obvious. I would advise my friends to avoid, as much as possible, exposing themselves to the night air or morning fogs, nothing tending more effectu∣ally to predispose the body to infection.</P>
<P>Temperate living both in eating and drinking is of as much consequence. Any thing that enriches the blood—any thing that has the smallest tendency to inflammation is most carefully to be avoided. I speak this, my fellow-citizens, with confidence. Both in '93 and '97 I knew many instances, where people situated in the very bed of infection, by living with extraordinary temperance, escaped. The idea entertained by many persons, that generous living, or in other words, high seasoned food, and a glass of good Madeira, from the best and most effectual bul∣wark, is too preposterous and absurd to merit much comment. Constant experience and the plainest principles of common sense flatly contradict it. Sim∣ple and at the same time, nourishing food, consisting chiefly of vegetables and ripe fruits, avoiding meats as much as possible, and never using any but in their simplest state, I would strongly recommend. Vio∣lent exercise, by heating the blood, seldom fails to be succeeded by a violent attack of the disorder, and is therefore to be guarded against. I shall conclude my observations, by remarking that cooling drinks prepared with cream of tartar, tamarinds, lemons, currant jelly, or any kinds of acid fruits, are highly proper both as preventatives and remedies; and that nothing has a better or more powerful effect in pre∣venting putrid appearances than a constant and un∣remitting use of acids.</P>

<HEAD>From the Gazette of the United States.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. FENNO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is an observation founded in truth, that few if any people in the world, have gone further in works of philanthrophy than the citizens of Philadelphia. Let him who discredits it, take an impartial survey of the various institutions erected in this city, for the re∣lief of suffering humanity, many of which are suppor∣ted by the voluntary contributions of benevolent in∣dividuals, and his doubts shall vanish—Yet some further regulations appear to be indispensable—there are persons for whom, either the laws have made no provision, or to whose pitiable condition the hand of mercy, under the laws, has not been extended.</P>
<P>It is but recently that a poor wretch was suffered to lie and perish in one of the streets in the Northern Liberties, without the least kind of assistance having been afforded him: whether the police officers are justly censurable for a neglect of duty, or otherwise, is not my business to enquire; the fact is, however, certain. Had his case been duly attended to, this hapless son of misery might, perhaps, have been res∣cued from an untimely grave.</P>
<P>In the Pennsylvania Hospital, a person cannot be admitted, but under certain qualifications; but this institution is liberal in its principles, and in its prac∣tice. It is a point of prudence, and perhaps of necessi∣ty, not to receive into the alms-house, any person having a contagious disorder, it is not knowingly done—and, unless the object be afflicted with the prevailing malady, or suspected to be so, he cannot procure an entrance into the City Hospital.</P>
<P>A few days since a circumstance occurred which was truly distressing—A German, a stranger in the place, applied to be admitted into the Pennsylvania <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his case did not come strictly within their
<PB N="31" REF="033589_0032_0FF7929B54EC4708"/>
cognizance, and he was refused. He then solicited an entrance into the alms-house, but having the dy∣sentery, and not being entitled to a place of residence here, he was unsuccessful. His next application was to captain Allen, health-officer of the port, but the captain conceiving himself unauthorized to send him to the City Hospital, the poor wretch was turned away without any hope of relief. What became of him I know not, but the deep distress, anxiety, and despondency depicted in his countenance produced a correspondent sentiment of sympathy in the minds of the bystanders, all of whom seemed to regret his un∣happy condition, though none knew in what manner to grant him the aid he required.</P>
<P>Let us but recall the case of this unfortunate man home to our own bosoms—diseased, friendless and disconsolate—situate in a strange country, where he knew not the countenance of a single human being; incapable of providing for himself, and unable from illness to leave the city; willing to take refuge even in an infected hospital, and I am sure there is no man who is not absolutely callous to the voice of misery, and dead to every thing which bears the stamp of humanity, who will not approve of some plan being fallen on for the comfortable accommodation of such of his suffering fellow-men—A plan for this laudable purpose is not only very feasible, but of ve∣ry easy practicability. I would advise then, that a temporary building be immediately erected near the City Hospital, into which all diseased persons, willing to go, should be freely and without ceremony ad∣mitted. If, on experiment, they are found to have the prevailing malady, they should be placed in the hospital; if otherwise, they should be provided for as circumstances would render humane and proper. But, as a more permanent and effectual establish∣ment, there should be attached to the institution of
<PB N="32" REF="033589_0033_0FF7929F0EBAC850"/>
the alms-house, not directly joining it, an infirmary, into which all persons designed to be accommodated in the institution, should at first be sent there to un∣dergo an examination of judicious physicians, and afterwards either to be provided for in the infirma∣ry, or to be otherwise disposed of, as their several cases might require. Surely there can be no reason∣able objection to a plan of this kind—the expence would be trifling, compared with the magnitude of the object, and the good which might result from it, would be incalculable. The man who will set about accomplishing this object, must succeed—and will doubtless have, not only the inestimable enjoyment of an approving mind, but the blessing of many a woe-worn object of wretchedness.</P>
<P>If public institutions will not shelter under their roofs, diseased and penny-less wretches, can it, or ought it to be expected, that private persons will? And especially at a time, when the horror attached to the idea of introducing the yellow fever into their families, produces, in the minds of most, a species of morbid panic, which paralizes every sentiment of hospitality towards suspected individuals.</P>
<P>I am not so tenacious of my plan but that I will most cordially support a better, if one more eligible is proposed by a more happy genius: but this is no time for temporising, or halting between two opini∣ons; something must be promptly done; and I now call on my fellow-citizens, in the name of every thing dear to humanity, not to hesitate, or trifle on the occasion. To the guardians of the poor, and the managers of the marine and city hospitals, I make the appeal, and trust it will not be in vain—They have the power and the means of accomplish∣ing the object; they are men; they must be posses∣sed of a fellow-feeling for the unfortunate, and must be convinced of the urgency of the occasion. To
<PB N="33" REF="033589_0034_0FF792A0A17C1138"/>
provide for those who cannot provide for them∣selves, is an indispensible duty. Let us do all we can, and leave the issue to that all-wise, and all-con∣trouling Providence, who will bless every honest la∣bour, and who regards with equal care, the whole family of mankind.</P>

<P>In consequence of the prevalence of a fever in that town, a health committee has been appointed. The following is extracted from their first official report:</P>
<P>"That from the first appearance of the fever, which was about the 20th July, to 20th August, in∣clusive, 11 persons have died of that disorder, and no one since Monday last.</P>
<P><HI>Monday,</HI> 1 <HI>o'clock P. M.</HI>—No person seized since yesterday; 8 persons only sick of the fever, 3 of whom are convalescents, and with two others the symptoms more favorable than yesterday. The town, in other respects, in as healthy a state as usu∣al."</P>

<P>On the 24th inst. the returns of sick in Boston were 23—and 9 convalescents. On the 20th there were only 20 sick in that place.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis, who retired to Norriston to escape the fever, died on the 24th, being the sixth day from the attack. Had been repeatedly bled and purged with mercury by Dr. H. for the first three days—
<PB N="35" REF="033589_0036_0FF792A610B25E48"/>
and on the 4th took an emetic that operated very se∣verely and occasioned great debility, and disposition to swooning—Distress of stomach increased in the night, and continued with unabated violence till the close of life.</P>
<P>Official accounts from Boston state, that the fever there is on the decline.</P>
<P>A writer in the New-York Commercial Adver∣tiser advises the inhabitants not to let another year pass away without the introduction of streams of wa∣ter into that city, and adds—"Your fellow-citizens are now flying into the country, and perhaps the scenes of 1795 are to be acted over again."</P>
<P>Received information to-day from Mr. Tarrill, that captain Chace, who lodged with him at Mel∣drum's Inn, at the sign of the Ostrich, in the North∣ern Liberties, went on board a vessel from Portland, about the 10th or 12th inst. which lay at Shoema∣ker's wharf near Vine-street, to see captain Wait, whose mate was at the time very ill on board, and that captain Chace was taken ill a few days after his visit, and died.</P>

<P>The whole number with fever in Boston on the 31st was 32—and only two have died since the 27th.</P>
<P>Private letters from New-York, state that "the west part of that city is as free from sickness as it was ever known to be at this season of the year. It is very true that the fever does exist in other parts of the city, but by no means to that alarming degree which flying reports represent."</P>

<HEAD>Occurrences in September, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="events of day">
<HEAD>September 1st.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. Cooper, one of the resident physicians of the City Hospital, and Dr. Sayre, appointed to attend the poor of the Northern Liberties, are both very ill to-day, though pronounced in the public papers of yesterday to be on the recovery.</P>
<P>Dr. Cooper appears to have received the disease by contagion, in the Hospital, as he had not been in any other part of the city for more than three weeks before his attack.</P>
<P>The following pathetic address was published in the Philadelphia Gazette of to-day, by the Managers the Marine and City Hospitals:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Health-Office,</HI> <DATE><HI>September</HI> 1, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMPELLED by the awful progress and unparal∣leled malignity of the prevailing fever, we are con∣strained to address your feelings, as well as your rea∣son, in order to avert the fatal destruction which, with rapid strides, is pervading our ill-fated city and suburbs.</P>
<P>The best skill of our physicians, and all the pow∣ers of medicine, it must be acknowledged, have pro∣ved unequal in the contest with this devouring poi∣son.</P>
<P>With the most affecting sympathy and anxious so∣licitude, we have to the best of our judgments, en∣deavoured to employ, as circumstances appeared to require, the power and the means entrusted to us, in arresting its progress, and alleviating its concommi∣tant miseries. We shall continue to employ them with unremitting zeal; but we have neither the pow∣er
<PB N="44" REF="033589_0045_0FF792C8F58059A0"/>
nor the means to accomplish ALL THE MEASURES necessary to check its extension, or provide for the pressing exigencies of the moment. The powers delegated, and appropriations made by law, to the institutions under our direction, are impotent indeed, when compared to the magnitude of the occasion.</P>
<P>It remains for our fellow-citizens to attain, by their energy, the ends which alone can stop its progress and diminish its horrors.</P>
<P>We have, in conjunction with the Guardians of the Poor, caused tents to be erected on the east bank of the Schuylkill for the accommodation of the indi∣gent; where near twelve hundred are already pro∣vided for, out of the fund appropriated for the or∣dinary relief of the poor. This is but a partial mi∣tigation of the evils which environ thousands who have a claim upon the philanthropy of those who are in more fortunate circumstances.</P>
<P>The difficulty of procuring a place of refuge, at present, in the country, is too well known; and the expense attending the removal of a family has dis∣couraged many from the attempt, who are in cir∣custances to live comfortably at home.</P>
<P>What remains to be done? Citizens of respecta∣bility and influence! come forward and form your∣selves into a committee for the purpose of erecting on the west bank of the Schuylkill, all the tents that can be collected; let the tents be floored with boards, and made as comfortable as possible—If tents cannot be had, boards in abundance may be procur∣ed for the erection of sheds. Admonish those citi∣zens who have no place of refuge, to take shelter there, particularly those from the east part of the city, the district of Southwark, and the Northern Liber∣ties—in short, ALL who can leave their homes without manifest injury; except those who are ne∣cessary for the protection of the city and liberties.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="033589_0046_0FF792CAC61C58A8"/>
The committee should have the general superin∣tendance and regulation of the tents, and authority to preserve order; contract for certain supplies of bread, meat, vegetables, wood, &amp;c. at the lowest possible rates. Those who are not in circumstances to pay, must be supplied by the public bounty.</P>
<P>It is at least an unequal, perhaps an unjust mode of raising money by an appeal to the humanity of generous individuals; but if on any occasion it may be justified, the present may be assumed without he∣sitation.</P>
<P>We call your attention to the actual and undis∣guised state of our city. Consider the mortality and rapid increase of the sick at so early a period. View the list of your physicians, and <HI>mark how few are at their posts</HI>—and we believe you will think with us, that the preservation of health is only to be attained by flight.</P>
<P>Do not flatter yourselves, fellow-citizens, that this picture is too highly coloured; we speak from con∣viction, and a knowledge of facts; and doubt not but that the lives of hundreds, perhaps of thousands, may be preserved by the adoption of these or similar measures.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>By order of the Board of Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals.</HI> WILLIAM JONES, President. Attest, WILLIAM PENROSE, Clerk, p. t.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

fever in Wilmington, and he caught it in the city early in August.</P>
<P>The following medical advice, addressed to the citizens of Philadelphia, by Doctors Rush and Grif∣fitts, was published in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 4th instant:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>MEDICAL ADVICE TO THE CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The following directions for the prevention and treat∣ment of the prevailing fever, are affectionately recom∣mended to those citizens of Philadelphia, who are una∣ble to procure the regular attendance and advice of physicians, by</HI> BENJAMIN RUSH, SAMUEL P. GRIFFITTS. September 3d, 1798.</P>
<P>THE seeds of the disease may exist in the body, for a considerable time, without doing any harm. It is generally EXCITED by one or more of the follow∣ing causes, which of course ought to be carefully avoided, <ABBR>viz:</ABBR> fatigue, a long walk, standing in the sun, or in a current of air, intemperance in eating and drinking, costiveness, violent passions, or sudden emotions of the mind, thin dressed, light bed cloathes, and above all, the night air.</P>
<P>It is of consequence for our citizens to know that we have but one fever in our city at present, and that every febrile indisposition partakes of the prevail∣ing malignant epidemic. Hundreds have died from mistaking the first stage of the fever for a common cold. The mistake is a natural one, for it comes on like a cold, and is frequently excited by cool, or cold air. This remark is intended to produce ap∣plications for medical aid as soon as possible after
<PB N="48" REF="033589_0049_0FF792D35BE20FC0"/>
feeling the least symptom of indisposition at the pre∣sent juncture.</P>
<P>In the forming state of the fever when the patient feels slightly indisposed, and before he is confined to his bed, the following remedies generally check the disease.</P>
<P>A purge of salts, castor oil, or a dose of jalap and calomel. If these fail of giving relief, a gentle sweat should be excited in the usual way. If there be much pain in the head or back, and the pulse be full, or tense, ten or twelve ounces of blood should be lost, before the use of the sweat, and either before or af∣ter taking the purge. Entire rest from business and exercise of all kinds will be necessary to give effica∣cy to the above remedies.</P>
<P>If the existence of the disease were more early, and more generally admitted, and the remedies which have been recommended, used before the fever was completely formed, there are the strongest reasons to believe there would be much less mortality from it.</P>
<P>After the disease is formed, and appears with more or less of the following symptoms, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> chills, great heat, head-ache, a redness in the eyes, sickness at the stomach, vomiting, pains in the back, limbs and bowels, &amp;c. the following remedies are proper:</P>
<P N="1">1. The loss of ten or twelve ounces of blood two or three times a day while the pulse continues to be FULL, or TENSE.—If the pulse should be SLOWER, and APPARENTLY WEAKER than natural, it calls for bleeding as much as it does when it discovers pre∣ternatural fulness and tension.</P>
<P N="2">2. The bowels should be purged at the same time with calomel mixed with jalap or rhubarb in pow∣ders or in pills.—The operation of this purging me∣dicine should be aided, when practicable, by clysters composed of half an ounce of glauber salts dissolved
<PB N="49" REF="033589_0050_0FF792D942A85410"/>
in half a pint of warm water with sweet oil, molasses, and common salt of each a table spoonful, in it.</P>
<P>The bowels should be kept gently open through the whole course of the disease, by means of the above clysters, and any other gently purging medi∣cine.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the stomach should be sick and oppressed with bile, a vomit of ipecacuhana, or tartar emetic may be given at any time on the 3d or 4th day of the disease, provided the pulse has been reduced by previous bleeding and purging. From five to ten drops of laudanum may be given to compose the sto∣mach if the vomit should operate more than three or four times.</P>
<P N="4">4. Calomel should be given from the beginning, in doses of from two to five grains, every two hours, in order to excite a salivation. If the calomel should purge more than two or three times a day, four or five drops of laudanum may be given two or three times a day, in order to confine the calomel to the bowels, and thereby to determine it to the mouth and throat. We have seen no death where this me∣dicine has produced a salivation.</P>
<P N="5">5. After the pulse is reduced by bleeding and purging if the disease has not yielded, a profuse sweat should be excited by wrapping the patient up in blankets, with five or six hot bricks wetted with vinegar applied to different parts of his body, and gi∣ving him at the same time large and repeated draughts during twenty four hours of HOT camomile or sage tea, HOT lemonade or weak punch, or any other HOT liquor that is agreeable to him, to drink. This sweat should be continued for twenty-four hours, 'till the patient is out of danger.</P>
<P N="6">6. Blisters should be applied to the wrists and an∣kles, in common cases, about the third or fourth day of the fever, if the pulse be reduced, or the sickness
<PB N="50" REF="033589_0051_0FF792DBE4DEE760"/>
at stomach is troublesome. If the head be much af∣fected, a blister should be applied to the neck or to the crown of the head, first cutting off the hair and shaving it, and if the stomach should be much af∣fected after the third or fourth day a large blister should be applied to it.</P>
<P N="7">7. In case of delirium with a languid pulse, poul∣tices of raw garlic with a little mustard should be applied to the feet.</P>
<P N="8">8. Fresh air should be admitted into sick rooms at all times, and cool air in the beginning of the fe∣ver when the skin is hot, and the pulse full and tense. In this state of the fever, the hands, feet and face should be washed ten or twelve times a day with cold water. In a cool state of the skin, or when the body is covered with sweat, cool air and cold water are improper.</P>
<P N="9">9. The body and bed linen of the sick should be frequently changed, and all offensive matters dis∣charged from them, should be instantly removed.</P>
<P>In cases of great weakness, the patient should not be permitted to rise from his bed when under the operation of purging physick nor upon any other oc∣casion.</P>
<P N="10">10. The drinks of sick people in the beginning of the fever, should be toast and water, tamarind water, lemonade, currant jelly dissolved in water, apple wa∣ter or barley water. In the latter stage of the fever, the drink may be porter and water, claret and wa∣ter, milk and water, or comomile tea.</P>
<P>Weak tea and coffee may be taken in the begin∣ning of the fever. In its second stage the patient may eat bread and milk with roasted apples or soft peaches, chocolate, sago, tapioca, ripe fruits, weak chicken or veal broth, and a little boiled chicken.</P>
<P>It will be improper to depend exclusively upon any one of the above remedies. The combined
<PB N="51" REF="033589_0052_0FF792DD75B7BD50"/>
force of them all is barely sufficient in many cases to overcome this formidable disease.</P>
<P>P. S. All the above medicines with suitable di∣rections may be had of George Hunter, No. 114, South Second-street; John J. Malcolm, No.78, South Second-street; and Robert Stafford, No.36, Market-street.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The prevalence of the fever in New-York, ac∣counted for, as follows, in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 4th instant, under the New-York head:</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>A VERY considerable alarm having taking place among the citizens, and the most exaggerated re∣ports circulated about the country, of the sickness with which certain parts of the city are afflicted, we have thought it a duty to make such enquiries as might enable us to place the matter in a point of view, as near the truth as possible.</P>
<P>About the beginning of August, in consequence of the foul, unfinished state of several water-lots, on the East river, between Co<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nties and the Old-slip, up∣wards of 20 persons were attacked nearly about the same time, with what appeared to be <HI>common colds,</HI> some slightly, others more severely; but the general occurrence of the fact in that neighbourhood led to a belief that it arose from a <HI>local</HI> cause and threatened something more serious. The foulness of the lots, and especially two vacant ones, being receptacles of every kind of filth, was considered as <HI>that cause;</HI> and in pursuance of official arrangements, they were im∣mediately covered with wholesome sand: The effect was, a general restoration of the sick.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of the New-slip, where the buildings for the most part, are small, and many of them inhabited by poor people, who live in a croud∣ed manner, and in situations incapable of proper ven∣tilation,
<PB N="52" REF="033589_0053_0FF792DF5D370CB8"/>
diseases occurred about the 12th—a number of persons died—but at present there appears to be no great cause of alarm in that quarter.</P>
<P>About the same period, or a little later, two or three persons were seized at Bruce's wharf with sus∣picious symptoms, and some deaths have taken place there and in its vicinity, owing, it is generally thought, to the extremely foul condition of Bruce and Marston's unfilled lots, bounding on the East∣river, at the foot of Pine-street—the effluvia issuing from them being highly putrid and offensive. Mea∣sures have been taken, and are now in operation, to cover them with wholesome earth, by which means it is hoped the evil in that quarter, if it has arisen from this source, may be corrected.</P>
<P>About the 20th, several persons were seized in Cliff-street, nearly in the same manner as those be∣tween Coenties and the Old-slip. At first they ge∣nerally considered their complaints to be mere colds taken by sleeping with open windows in the vio∣lently hot weather which then prevailed—Unfortu∣nately, it was a more serious case. The patients ra∣pidly grew worse, and several died as well there as in John, Gold and Rider-streets, and Eden's-Allies, all lying within the vicinity of Burling-slip sewer. These complaints, on investigation, were thought to proceed, in part, from the offensive state of that sew∣er; which had, for some time, become a receptacle for various species of putrid matter, and of which the mouth lies nearly opposite John-street, commonly called Golden-hill-street—so that, whenever a South or S. E. wind prevailed, it blew through the sewer, and bore a column of effluvia up John-street, and through that into Cliff, and the adjacent streets, ren∣dering the atmosphere intollerably bad. The best informed physicians are of this opinion. The head of the sewer has since been closed by a valve-door,
<PB N="53" REF="033589_0054_0FF792E228581C18"/>
and a considerable quantity of quick lime thrown into it, with a view of neutralizing its contents. A similar door, with the same intention, has been ad∣ded to the Ferry-street sewer.</P>
<P>Other causes are also alledged, and with great plausibility, at least, if not certainty.</P>
<P>It is well known that the cessation of our com∣mercial intercourse with the French Islands, in con∣sequence of their hostile violence, has greatly lesson∣ed the demand for provisions: of course large quan∣tities of beef remained in many cellars, particularly among the merchants of Pearl-street. Much of this, from what is now seen to be an improper mode of packing, as directed by a late law, has lately become tainted, emitted a very putrid effluvium—corrupting the air and contributing its share as a cause of dis∣ease. We learn that the commissioners of the health-office have taken measures to have it all inspected, and the spoiled removed out of town. Much al∣ready has been sent away, and the remainder is go∣ing as fast as possible.</P>
<P>These causes, with the immense fall of rain, and violent heats, experienced in the course of Au∣gust, are supposed to have originated the disease which has spread such panic as to drive many fami∣lies into the country.</P>
<P>On the most diligent enquiry however, we can∣not find out, that any great subject of alarm exists, except in the neighbourhood of the New-slip—in the vicinity of Darling-slip-sewer—and at the foot of Pine-street, at which places several persons have died.</P>
<P>Individual cases have also occurred in other parts of the town, but, as in 1795, they remain insu∣lated, and without communication to the attendants, as far as we can discover. These, it is generally thought were taken at one or the other of the places before mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="033589_0055_0FF792E7D0E33248"/>
An opinion has been avowed by some, that the disease has been imported, or arose from damaged coffee, thrown out of a ship on Kelley's dock, west of the New-slip. This, in the present instance, is utterly groundless, and can serve no purpose but that of delusion. The quantity of refuse-coffee al∣luded to by our advocates for imported contagion did not exceed half a peck, and was the mere sweep∣ings of the hold.</P>
<P>We are informed by a gentleman who has been at the pains to collect a list of the persons interred in the several burial grounds, that during the last week, they averaged about 12 per day—and that previous to Sunday last, there was no very unusual mortality for the season.</P>
<P>With respect to new cases, enquiry at the best sources, enables us to say they have very much de∣clined within the last 24 hours, and that the disease yields more readily to medicine.</P>
<P>How far this statement authorizes the extreme alarm which precipitates so many citizens out of town, we do not know; but it would at least be ad∣viseable that all who remove should leave their hou∣ses, cellars and yards in a cleanly condition—that such as remain may not be exposed to the bad ef∣fects of their carelessness and indiscretion.</P>
<P>The system of cleanliness adopted by the com∣missioners of the health-office, we are happy to ob∣serve, is pursued with increased vigour; and indefa∣tigable efforts are daily made by that board, to pre∣clude every source of impure air in the city.</P>
<P>This statement may be depended on—it is the result of enquiry of the first authority.</P>

<HEAD>From the Gazette of the United States of the 13th instant. DIRECTIONS How to escape the Yellow Fever now prevalent in Phi∣ladelphia.</HEAD>
<P>Addressed particularly to those citizens whose cir∣cumstances will not permit them to comply with
<PB N="66" REF="033589_0067_0FF793085B928860"/>
the recommendations of the Managers of the Ma∣rine and City Hospitals.</P>
<P>THE fever which at this time prevails in our un∣fortunate city and suburbs, is the very same in kind as that which prevailed in '93 and '97, occasioned by imported contagion, and was introduced into it for want of efficient health-laws, and the proper re∣gulation of quarantines; as I propose to make ap∣pear in a future paper.</P>
<P>This contagion however appears, from numerous observations, and the most authentic facts, to be ca∣pable of producing fever, only under <HI>particular</HI> cir∣cumstances: these circumstances, removed or avoid∣ed, the contagion becomes inactive and harmless.</P>
<P>This fever had not been observed to exist in Phi∣ladelphia for more than thirty years before the year '93—and has never been known to exist in the win∣ter season in this climate; differing in this respect, from those contagious fevers that are bred in jails, hospitals and prison ships; but perfectly resembling the plagues which have been introduced at different times into different maritime towns in Europe from certain parts of Africa, and the Turkish dominions in Europe bordering upon Asia.</P>
<P>The circumstances which render the contagion of the yellow fever active and favor its spreading or be∣coming epidemic, appear to be, hot, rarified and stagnant, or confined air, more especially when re∣plete and altered in its salutary quality by putrid ex∣halations from dead vegetable and animal substances. Under the recited circumstances the majority of those who approach very near to, or come in contact with the sick, so as to receive the exhalations emit∣ted by the lungs or skin, become in the course of a few days, most commonly on the fifth or sixth day af∣ter such exposure, affected with the same kind of fe∣ver, but as all that approach within the same distance
<PB N="67" REF="033589_0068_0FF7930CA3033DD8"/>
to the sick do not afterwards take the disease though they have received the contagious particles into their bodies, it implies that their constitutions are not disposed to favour its operation, that is, that they are possessed of a power to resist its action or impressi∣on, or that the contagion mixing with the fluids in the stomach, or with those in the arteries passes out again, with some of the usual excretions.</P>
<P>The circumstances which, in most cases, appear to give effect to the contagion, so as to produce fe∣ver, after it has been received into the circulation through the medium of the stomach, lungs or skin, appear to be such as have the power of inducing sud∣den and great debility in the several functions of the body, and consequent spasm or constriction of the extreme vessels, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Among the chief of these, may be reckoned, sud∣den exposure to cold, after great fatigue, or after be∣ing greatly heated by exercise and exposure to the scorching rays of the sun.</P>
<P>Intemperance, succeeded by abstinence, frequent blood letting, purging, fasting, and constant terror or dread of the disease, have all a similar effect.—Whereas moderate and refreshing exercise, the tem∣perate use of such nourishing food as has no tenden∣cy to stimulate or inflame, and rather to preserve the bowels laxative than otherwise, and the temper∣ate use of diluted fermented liquors, particularly sound bottled porter and claret, have the most salu∣tary effect in preventing the operation of the conta∣gion, and also of rendering the disease milder and more manageable by the physician, when it does at∣tack, than when it occurs in those previously debi∣litated.</P>
<P>The air in the open streets, I believe, never be∣comes sufficiently contaminated by the contagious articles (let the patients be ever so numerous in the
<PB N="68" REF="033589_0069_0FF79311103166A8"/>
houses) to communicate the disease to any person walking in the middle of the street, or even on the pavements, when the wind blows from the opposite side. This is a fact not only confirmed by the ob∣servations of the judicious and accurate Dr. Russel, in his account of a pestilential fever at Aleppo, and by all the physicians that have published an account of the disease, as it has appeared in different parts of Europe, but is also established by the events of last year, and by those of '93.</P>
<P>In the year '93, all the prisoners in the jail of Philadelphia, amounting to more than 200; the pensioners in the alms house; and the patients in the Pennsylvania hospital, escaped the disease, ow∣ing to the precaution of preventing the admission of any sick or suspicious person, as well as every infect∣ed article into those places.</P>
<P>All the families, also, that remained in the city, and confined themselves and their domestics strictly to their own houses, and suffered no sick person, or any one lately recovered from the disorder, or any material from an infected house, to come near them; and employed some trusty person to furnish them with marketing and other necessaries from sources free from infection, escaped the disease without ex∣ception. This was also the case with all the farmers that attended the market, that cautiously avoided sleeping at, or going into any of the chambers of the taverns or places where they put up. This could not have been the case if the whole atmosphere of the city had been tainted, or replete with noxious exhalations.</P>
<P>By observing the preceding rules and cautions, therefore, those inhabitants who cannot procure a retreat in the country, may certainly preserve them∣selves from taking the fever.</P>
<P>These are consolatory facts, drawn from experien∣ced
<PB N="69" REF="033589_0070_0FF79316193CD4A8"/>
observers; and they are facts that may be fitly opposed to the popular notions of contagion, so apt to affect the imagination in moments of consternati∣on and dismay.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I think it proper to add, that I have frequently seen persons, whose office it is to attend the sick, escape the disease in large airy apartments, without observing any precaution at all; but have seldom observed this to be the case in small confined places unfavourable for ventilation, especi∣ally where the circumstances of the patient, would not admit of daily changes of the bed and body lin∣en. Cleanliness, daily changes of apparel, and free ventilation appear, therefore, to be essential for pre∣venting the contagious and malignant effects of the fever.</P>
<P>Perhaps if physicians and nurses were studiously to guard against breathing when near the patient, and were never to swallow their saliva; (by which it is probable the contagion is more frequently con∣veyed into the body than by any other means) were careful to rince their mouths with cold water and vinegar, brandy and water or wine, and frequently to chew some agreeable aromatic substance; were ne∣ver to approach the sick with an empty stomach, and were to rub half a drachm or a drachm of mer∣curial ointment upon their limbs every night till it occasioned tenderness of the mouth, it would prevent the contagion from operating, or at least render the disease much more mild and manageable when it did occur.</P>

his paper, on account of the prevalence of a ma∣lignant disorder in that place.</P>
<P><HI>(G. U. S.)</HI></P>
<P>The following interesting remarks were published in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 13th instant:</P>
<P>"WE are apt to magnify whatever respects our∣selves. It ought not therefore to be surprizing if the papers of our city were full of remarks on the prevail∣ing fever. The extensive misfortunes that it produ∣ces occupying almost exclusively our attention, our subscribers at a distance would not fail to listen with an indulgent ear to our tale of distress, and suffer us to fly to the only solace left us, that of expressing our sorrow. So far, however, have the citizens of Phi∣ladelphia been from indulging themselves in fruitless expressions of regret, that our papers contain few animadversions, and no discussions, respecting the disease. They have not omitted to record facts, but every mind has been suffered without prejudice to form its own deductions. This APPARENT apathy has risen not from any real indifference or want of feeling, but from a conviction derived from expe∣rience, that in the collision of hostile opinions, hu∣manity is often lost sight of, and an obstinate adher∣ence to error is generated in its room. In the year '93 the medical pen was, in most instances, dipped in gall. The several combatants took their peculiar grounds and disdained, in too many cases, to save the life of a human being by following any other suggestions, than their own. They distracted the public mind, and shook all confidence in medical assistance.</P>
<P>The very reverse of this has been exhibited du∣ring the present season. No men have allied toge∣ther in support of a favourite theory. The pride of opinion has existed but in a limited sphere. The practice of one physician has become assimilated to
<PB N="71" REF="033589_0072_0FF7931A7B0F4EF8"/>
that of another; and from the best information those prescriptions appear to be very generally pursued, which are mild, and more congenial to nature than those remedies, if remedies they may be called, which too often only rescue us from the disease to inflict upon us one more fatal.</P>
<P>"These ideas will not, at present, be pursued further. The chief design of these notices is to ex∣hibit the superior malignity of the present disease over that which prevailed in '93. It is computed that in that year 23,000 citizens left the city. They formed probably two-fifths of the inhabitants. This year certainly three-fourths, but more likely five-sixths of the citizens, have departed. Taking the intermediate number, the result will be that twice the proportion of citizens remained in Philadelphia in '93 that do this year. Some allowance, however, is to be made for the increased population. But on the other hand, when the caution of the citizens is considered, and the arrangements that were made to resist its influence this year, the last circumstances will be found to balance the former. Besides it ought to be remembered, that in a place contain∣ing a given population, if an epidemic rages, its vi∣olence is not checked in the exact ratio of the dimi∣nution of the inhabitants, but with much more ra∣pidity. Notwithstanding these circumstances, the disease continues to rear its head, and to threaten mortality this year superior to that in '93."</P>

<HEAD>MEDICAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE great advantage to be derived to man∣kind, from an inspection of the bodies of such as have died of so formidable an epidemic, as the yel∣low fever, must be obvious to all. The following cases of dissection may throw some light on the na∣ture of the disease, as it prevails in this town, and may, we hope, be of some use, in investigating the treatment best adapted to the purpose of checking or suppressing its destructive ravages.</P>
<P>The first case was of a man, who died on the 6th day from the seizure, and as no application was made to a physician, till the first stage of the disease had nearly expired, the state of the organs may be considered in a great measure as the natural effect of the disease, undisturbed by art.</P>
<P>In the cavity of the chest, the lungs were re∣markably affected—They contained an uncommon quantity of dark blood in their vessels, which ren∣dered them apparently more dense than usual; the vesicles not being distended with air, and their sub∣stance consequently less compressible than usual.—The posterior part of both lobes was extremely livid, and in the cavities of the thorax was contained a large portion of extravasated blood, firmly coagu∣lated, to the quantity of eight or ten ounces, as nearly as could be estimated.</P>
<P>The pericadium contained as much as two or three ounces of fluid blood. The heart was of its usual size; but the coronary veins were so distended
<PB N="74" REF="033589_0075_0FF793235A56D7F8"/>
with blood, as to exhibit the appearance of a most successful injection. In the cavity of the abdomen, the part most conspicuously morbid was the liver.—This organ appeared to be much inflamed both on its convex and concave surface; its substance was much indurated, and on cutting, resembled in co∣lour, a boiled liver. The gall bladder was contract∣ed to a very small size, and contained not more than a quarter of an ounce of a thick, glutinous, and al∣most inspissated substance, resembling pith. There were no marks of any considerable quantity of the bile having been lately contained in the sack, and none of the neighbouring parts had the least tinge that denoted its presence. On cutting through the ductus communis choledochus, no bile issued from the aperture; the hepatic duct had also evidently for some time, ceased to transmit its fluid from the li∣ver. The stomach exhibited an enormous distensi∣on of its veins, especially round the pylorus, and had every mark of great inflammation. The intestines in general, were in the same state with the stomach; the smaller were considerably distended, and the lar∣ger contracted. The spleen was uncommonly tur∣gid, but in other respects in its natural state. The peritonaeum on the under side of the diaphragm, and the pleura on the upper, bore the vestiges of in∣flammation, but no other parts of those membranes appeared to have been diseased.</P>
<P>The omentum was considerably thickened, and from the turgescence of its blood vessels, of a colour unusually dark. There were no appearances in the thoracic or abdominal viscera of suppuration, nor was any degree of foeter perceived to arise from them; nor was there the least mark of even incipient putrifaction in any part of the body. It may be proper to remark on this case, that in every stage of the disease, the discharges from the bowels, were of
<PB N="75" REF="033589_0076_0FF79324EE44E4F8"/>
the colour and consistence of water gruel, excepting a few evacuations of a matter similar to what is called the black vomit; and that this usually fatal symptom had also preceded the patient's death on the fourth day of the disease.</P>
<P>The second case. The subject of this dissecti∣on was the body of a person, who died on the 12th day of the attack with symptoms of a mixed kind; a remission of the disease had taken place at the peri∣od usually critical, upon which, on the 6th day, a delirium ensued, and continued to the moment of fatal termination.</P>
<P>On opening the cranium, the brain was found to have its vessels astonishingly destined with blood, an ounce or two of serum was effused between the dura and pia mater. Under the sagittal future, and by the side of the longitudinal sinus, where the large veins terminate in that cavity, a lymphatic band, about an inch wide, extending nearly the whole length of the sinus, was formed by the coagulable lymph, which had been effused from the blood ves∣sels, by the violence of the preceding inflammation, and this substance had served as a medium of adhesi∣on, between the dura and pia mater in that part.</P>
<P>The lungs adhered very firmly to the pleura on the right side, and appeared posteriorly to have been much inflamed, and in some parts to be indu∣rated in portions of about the size of a pigeon's egg. The left lobe adhered so firmly to the pleura, as not to be separated but by tearing the substance of the lungs, which here appeared extremely diseased, and in a state of actual suppuration throughout its whole substance. The heart was in its natural state. The liver was much enlarged, and in a state that denoted a high degree of inflammation; the convex surface, of the great lobe near the gall bladder exhibiting marks of extravasation, as if violently contused.—
<PB N="76" REF="033589_0077_0FF79326DA5C61F0"/>
The gall bladder was full of bile, and the ducts per∣vious.</P>
<P>The stomach was nearly in its natural state, but on the inside, the surface of the villous coat, was besmeared with a matter, which seemed to be of the same nature with the black vomit, tho' nothing of this kind had been ejected in the course of the dis∣ease.</P>
<P>The duoderum, was much inflamed for several inches from its commencement at the stomach, and the whole tract of the smaller intestines was in the same state. The urinary bladder was contracted to the size of a pullet's egg, and its inner coat appeared to have been in a high state of inflammation, the ves∣sels having been distended to such a degree, as to have suffered a rupture, and to have effused a quan∣tity of blood into the cavity of this organ.</P>
<P>The state of the lungs in this subject, was pro∣bably the consequence, chiefly of a previous disease, independent of that which proved fatal here. An af∣fection of the lungs had sometime existed, whilst the subject was in other respects intolerable health, and in the pursuit of his business; so that a pulmonary con∣sumption would in all probability, have shortly put a period to his life, had the disease of which he died, never overtaken him.</P>
<P>The third case. In this instance the disease terminated fatally on the fourth day.</P>
<P>Upon opening the thorax, the lungs discover∣ed marks of inflammation, anteriorly, and were ex∣tremely gorged with blood, in the posterior part of their respective lobes.</P>
<P>The liver exhibited marks of inflammation es∣pecially on its concave side, and posterior part; its texture was altered, and of a very dense consistence. The gall bladder was completely obliterated, its coats having coalesced with the contiguous parts so
<PB N="77" REF="033589_0078_0FF79328C6F10210"/>
as to form with them one confused membranous substance. The stomach was externally to appear∣ance in a natural state, but its inner coat was cover∣ed with that black coloured fluid, denominated the black vomit.</P>
<P>The color in some parts had been much infla∣med, as well as part of the omentum where attached to this intestine.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that in both the cases, where the gall bladder had been diseased, and ceased to perform its functions; or where the liver had been rendered incapable of secreting the bile, the body became yellow, before death; whereas in the other, where the bile was found in due quantity, this cir∣cumstance did not occur.</P>
<P>From the above dissections, which evinced a deficiency of secretion in the billary organs, the in∣dications of cure seemed to be directed towards a course, which might obviate the inflammation in ge∣neral of the organs diseased, and open the excretory ducts of the liver, that the fluid might resume its course into the intestines.</P>
<P>It is with the highest degree of pleasure, that we communicate to the public our hopes that after pro∣per evacuations, the use of calomel may be found to answer these important purposes. This medicine has been accordingly used with much success in fif∣teen patients within eighteen days, all of whom, ex∣cepting one, have recovered; or have past the dan∣gerous period. It has been given not in the usual doses, for the purpose of an evacuant by the intes∣tines, but in small doses of one, two or three grains, every hour or two, so as to produce a sali∣vation as soon as possible; with this view, from one hundred to two hundred and thirty grains of calomel have been given in the course of two or three days, commencing the use of it immediately after the first
<PB N="78" REF="033589_0079_0FF792AA98666A08"/>
copious evacuations by bleeding and purging; and in every instance as the salivation came on, the dis∣ease has abated.</P>
<P>Coinciding in sentiment, respecting the use of mercury, so as to produce a salivation, we with pleasure mention the learned doctor Rush, of Phila∣delphia. But the method is more explicitly and highly recommended by James Clark, M. D. F. R. S. E. in a treatise on the yellow fever, as it appeared in the island of Dominica, in the years, '93, '94, '95, and '96.</P>
<P>The doctor recommends the free use of mercu∣ry, both as a remedy and preventative—and says, the officers of the army and navy, who have lei∣sure and can be prevailed upon, on their arrival in the West-Indies, to undergo one or two courses of mercury, taking a few laxative medicines, after con∣fining themselves to a moderate use of wine, and living chiefly on vegetables and fruits for the first two months after their arrival, may rely almost to a certainty, on escaping the fever.</P>

<P>WHEREAS, it hath pleased Almighty God, to visit the cities of New-York, Philadelphia, and the borough of Wilmington, in the state of Delaware, with a malignant and mortal fever, which excites great apprehensions in the minds of the citizens of Baltimore (who have been blessed with an uncom∣mon degree of health this season) lest daily com∣munication with those places may introduce the said disorder into this city, and makes them desirous that all intercouse, during the present critical period, should be restrained:</P>
<P>I have, therefore, deemed it proper, in conformi∣ty with the powers vested in me by law, to issue this proclamation, hereby forbidding the entrance into the city of Baltimore, or within three miles thereof, of all persons whomsoever who have come from the cities of New-York or Philadelphia, or from the bo∣rough of Wilmington, in the state of Delaware, and

<Q><P>A man was found dead the day before yesterday in a house in Front near Walnut-street, directly op∣opsite the Green tree pump. The corpse was first discovered by the very offensive smell which was found to proceed from the house. From the time that has elapsed, since the family left the house, the corpse, it is thought, must have been laying there at least a month—It was in so high a state of putrefac∣tion, when discovered, that it was removed by pie∣ces to the coffin, in which it was deposited!</P>
<P>In addition to the above, a man was found in a house in South Water-street, near Chesnut-street—it is supposed that he had been dead for three weeks—it was discovered by a man having occasion to go into the house for some things which he had left; on opening the door, there was such a stench came out of the house, that he was obliged to retreat.</P>
<P>A negro man entered the house and found the body of a man almost devoured by vermin; infor∣mation was given at the Health-Office, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon; the people waited till 8 o'clock in the evening and heard nothing from the Health-Office, two black men were hired for six∣teen dollars, to take the corps and throw it into the

Most of the houses in the lower part of the town are deser∣ted. (Phila. Gaz.)</P>
<P>Similar accounts have been received from the little villages of Chester and Marcus-Hook, on the river Delaware, between Philadelphia and Wilming∣ton.</P>
<P>It appears from a communication from Dr. Da∣vidson to Dr. Mease, published in the Medical Re∣pository of New-York, that the atmosphere of the West India Islands, where the fever is so frequently malignant and mortal, contains a considerably great∣er proportion of pure air than the atmosphere in any part of Europe. Hence a strong presumption ari∣ses, that the disease does not originate from impure air, but is the offspring of specific contagion.</P>
<P>Patroles, in conjunction with the ordinary watch∣men, whose number has been doubled, continue to guard the city in the night.</P>

<P>A few of the society of friends met in the city to hold their annual meeting, but immediately adjourn∣ed, on account of the fever, till December next.</P>
<P>All the banks are now removed to Germantown. The assistant cashier of the bank of United States, Mr. Kuhl, is now with the disease in Germantown.</P>
<P>P. S. He was salivated and recovered.</P>
<P>Most of the clerks of this bank, are either dead, or have been sick.</P>

<Q><P>REFLECT BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!</P>
<P>FELLOW CITZENS, reflect upon your danger before it is too late. One hundred of us are attack∣ed with the fever every day. One half of that num∣ber is daily carried to the grave. If we remain in town it is probable that the fever will continue five or six weeks longer, and by that time one half of our number will have been sick, and one fourth of us will be no more.</P>
<P>How different is the situation of our friends in the country and in the tents.</P>
<P>Two thousand persons in the tents have lost but seventeen in twenty-five days, while the same number in Philadelphia have loft one hundred and seventy eight.</P>
<P>At the encampments there is great plenty of good food.</P>
<P>In town it is resolved to give nothing to the poor who are able to go.</P>
<P>WHY DO YOU PREFER FAMINE, SICKNESS AND DEATH, TO HEALTH AND PLENTY?</P>
<P>It is not yet too late to remove.</P>
<P>GO BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!</P></Q>
<P>I rode through several parts of the city to-day, and have never seen the streets cleaner and freer from putrid materials or stagnant water, than at present.</P>

The names of the revd. Mr. Hendel, pastor of the German Presbyterian church, and Hillary Baker, <ABBR>esq.</ABBR> mayor of the city of Philadelphia, are on the list of deaths to-day.</P>
<P>The city appears deserted and disconsolate, and the distressed imagination paints the fell messenger of death, waving his sable plume over the affrighted city, and striking with his dread wand the opening tomb.</P>

<P>It appears from the returns of this day, that the late increased coolness of the air has increased the list of new cases.</P>
<P>There are now near one thousand persons in the sheds or board tents, in the encampment in Masters fields, all from the City, Liberties and suburbs.</P>

On Sunday last the 23d inst. the physicians at the encampment prescribed for 32 patients who had different complaints; of these 32, there were only 14 that had the malignant fever. One of them had been out of the city nine days before he was attacked with the disease, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Hutchinson Thompson, a boy ten years of age.</P>
<P>Only four fresh cases of fever have occurred at the encampment since the 23d, though fresh families are daily coming out of the city, and though many of them have been much exposed to the late rains and damp ground. This furnishes a strong argu∣ment in favour of those who maintain the opinion, that the prevailing fever is propagated by contagion from the diseased, and not by any depravity or nox∣ious particles diffused through the atmosphere from putrid vegetable or dead animal matter. For these breathed the same air as the rest of the citizens, but none but those that had received the contagion from the diseased, were affected by causes allowed by eve∣ry one to be powerfully adapted to excite the disease into action.</P>
<P>There were only 35 persons with the fever in Boston the 21st inst. (Phila. Gaz.)</P>
<P>The fever in the jail of Philadelphia has hitherto been confined to the vagrants and criminals; the east wing has been converted into an hospital, and every humane and salutary measure adopted for the convenience and cure of the sick. (Ph. Gaz.)</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS, WHICH FOLLOW THE ABOVE.</HEAD>
<P>The above return has excited considerable ad∣ditional alarm in town and country. It is certainly melancholly: but we desire to praise Heaven, a smart north-easterly storm, which we hope and an∣ticipate, will check the march and dissipate the ma∣lignancy of the pestilence, and thoroughly cleanse our atmosphere, yesterday morning commenced its salutary operation, and terminated last evening in a strong north-wester. We expect in a few days to congratulate our friends in the country, on the re∣turn of Hygeia to the metropolis; and to invite their return.</P>
<P>In continuing this melancholy detail, we cannot suppress those painful emotions, which naturally arise, when contemplating one of the greatest cala∣mities which ever befel an infant nation. Almost all the seaports of the United States has, more or less, within these few years, been visited with a pesti∣lence which threatens to depopulate many of our fairest towns and villages. To arrest the progress of this destroying angel, has as yet, been attempted in vain. It appears to defy the science, skill, and in∣trepidity of our most eminent physicians—and to yield to nothing but the frosts of winter. It seri∣ously behoves every well-wisher to his country, to continue to search for the cause of the calamity, and, if possible, to remove it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="events of day">

<P>Died this morning, Mr. Joseph Anthony, a re∣spectable and distinguished merchant of Philadelphia. He resided in High, near Ninth-street.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="033589_0093_0FF7933A3367A330"/>
The physicians of the encampment prescribed for 32 patients to-day, not one of whom had any symptom of the yellow fever—but the greatest pro∣portion complained of diarrhoea, catarrh, intermitting fever, or cutaneous eruption.</P>
<P>There are at present at the encampment more than 1300 persons including children.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooper, town clerk of Boston, states that since the return on the 24th to the 26th of Septem∣ber, 20 persons have recovered, 7 have died, 44 new cases have occurred, 97 remaining sick, 20 of whom are on the recovery.</P>
<P>From 26th to 28th, 26 had recovered, 5 died and 12 new cases had occurred, 72 remaining sick, of whom 30 were on the recovery.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooper assures the public, that the above re∣turns are particularly correct.</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell of Woodberry, and Dr. Martin of Chester, both physicians of eminence, are dead of the prevailing disease,</P>
<P>Provision has been amply made for the more in∣digent and needy, and for all who can submit to take shelter at the encampment, or to request supplies from the guardians of the poor, but the situation of those whose sensibility will not permit them to have recourse to these resources, must be attended with distress that may be better conceived than describ∣ed.</P>

<HEAD>October 1st.</HEAD>
<P>A considerable number of cases of pure intermit∣tents have occurred on the high grounds within two miles of the city; in one family near the encamp∣ment on Masters' place, five of the family have had regular paroxisms and intermissions.</P>
<P>Harrisburgh which was much infested with inter∣mitting and remitting fevers, and the dysentry for∣merly in hot summers, has been remarkably healthy the present summer; owing to the removal of a mill∣dam, which formerly occasioned an extensive tract of ground near the town to be overflowed.</P>
<P>Two of the criminals in the jail, were discovered undermining the wall of the east dungeon yester∣day.</P>
<P>The jail is now under the care of Peter Helm, who performed such meritorious services at the hospi∣tal in 1793. The former jailor from dread of the fever, had relinquished his charge.</P>
<P>The American Howard, has also taken up his abode in that dreary mansion of the lawless vota∣ries of rapine and disorder, for the purpose of em∣ploying means to prevent the disease from spreading there.</P>
<P>Accounts from New-York, state that the late nor∣therly and N. W. breeze has had a favourable effect upon the fever. At Philadelphia the number of new cases are also reduced though as had been predicted, the mortality was greater upon its first coming on.</P>
<P>Several persons from the country who were at the friends yearly meeting, in the city have been attack∣ed with fever since their return home.</P>
</DIV3>

<P>The board of managers have received a draught

on the Bank of United States, for 3,000 dollars for the benefit of the poor of this city, from the mayor of Baltimore, in part of a subscription making by the inhabitants of that place.</P>
<P>The G. of Octo. 2nd.</P>
<P>Seven deaths at Boston on the 27th. last and 79 sick.</P>
<P>All the pasture grounds appear parched up, and all the springs are become remarkably low.</P>
<P>The flats along the Schuylkill, and the creeks that empty into the Delaware, expose more mud to the rays of the sun than usual, and give origin to nume∣rous cases of intermittents, but there has not been an instance of a case of malignant or yellow fever ap∣pearing any where in the vicinity of the Schuylkill, as far as I have been able to learn.</P>
<P>"At Marcus-hook, 2 persons from Philadelphia were attacked with the fever, and died soon after; five of the family with whom they resided, were at∣tacked in succession and every one died"</P>

<P>The physicians prescribed to-day at the encamp∣ment for 26 persons, with different complaints;—only 3 with yellow fever, and these lately from the city, one of whom was sent to the City Hospital.</P>
<P>Accounts from New-York, state that the death of Dr. Tredwell makes the eleventh physician that has fallen a sacrifice to the prevailing fever in that city.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a letter from a respectable character in New-York, dated Oct. 1st.</HEAD>
<PB N="103" REF="033589_0104_0FF793478DF89190"/>
<P>"We hope the disorder in our city is abating, from the number of new cases being much less for the four last days, than for some time before, altho' the number of the inhabitants remain nearly the same. The deaths still about 40. The disorder is much among the poor, who are unable to procure suitable nursing. Simple remedies are found most availing. Castor oil and salts, with injections, are all the medicines, excepting lime water and milk, that are given by our most skilful and successful phy∣sicians. Herb teas, particularly catmint, are very freely used to occasion perspiration, and where the patient has an attentive and prudent nurse, they ge∣nerally under this treatment have recovered. Ele∣ven persons have been sick in my house, and except∣ing one, have all been treated in this way, and all recovered. My sister had calomel, and suffered more than the others, though her attack was much less severe than either of them. I could mention other instances, but this may suffice. This practice is now so generally used, that many instances occur, where the nurses never call for the aid of a physici∣an, and have much success."</P>

<P>Only 19 persons sick to-day at the encampment, <ABBR>viz:</ABBR>—3 with yellow fever—rheumatism 1—catarrh 1—opthalmia 2—intermitting fever 4—dysentery 2—diarrhoea 5—hoemorrhoids 1.</P>
<P>In a letter from Dr. Mitchell of Virginia, ad∣dressed to Dr. Franklin, it is asserted, "That blood-letting, upon the first accession of the pain in the head, frequently prevented the disease from forming, especially when an emetic was given immediately after, and a sweat raised by diluting acid drinks."</P>
<P>The disease has visibly declined in the city since the late cold weather.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="033589_0105_0FF7934D003E4180"/>
Deaths in New-York in the month of August, 133 men, 55 women, and 141 children. Of these, 83 are said to have died of the yellow fever, and 246 of other diseases—Total in August, 392.</P>
<P>Deaths in September, 649 men, 353 women, and 148 children; 956 of the fever, and 194 of other diseases—Total 1150.</P>
<P>October 1st and 2d,—54 men, 19 women, and 4 children; 7<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the fever, and 6 of other diseases—Total, 77.</P>
<P>Total deaths since the 1st of August, 836 men, 427 women, and 293 children; 1110 of the fever, and 446 of other diseases—Total, 1556.</P>
<P>(Porc. Gaz. of Oct. 6.)</P>
<P>The health committee of New-London, in their report of the 25th ult. recommend to the citizens who have moved out, not to return at present, as the number of new cases last week, has exceeded any preceding week.</P>
<P>Twenty-two persons sick at the encampment;—only one of whom had any symptoms resembling the malignant or yellow fever. The complaints are opthalmia 4—remitting fever 1—intermitting fever 6—all with regular cold and hot stages, succeeded by perfect intermissions; some quotidians, and some tertiant.—Spurious pleurisy 2—rheumatism 2—di∣arrhoea 1—diarrhoea infantum 3—dysentery 2.</P>
<P>Dr. Mitchell of Virginia, in a letter written some years since to Dr. Franklin, asserts, "That the yellow fever has chiefly raged in America in large families, towns, camps or ships, and has been twice brought into Virginia by ships of war;" and adds, "It is remarkably contagious, as appears from the greatest part of a family being affected by it from persons who had taken it in another place.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="033589_0106_0FF7934E94326900"/>
"The most effectual remedies were lenient pur∣ges and clysters frequently repeated till a copious diarrhoea and bilious stool ensued; with aqueous and bland drinks, and occasional bleedings adapted to the indications expressed by the pulse and pain of head, stomach or intestines. He also assures him, that he found mild purges and clysters much more effectual than any other remedies so long as the pain and tenderness of the stomach, and constant propen∣sity to puke continued, upon receiving any thing into it, without regard to the period or duration of the disease, though the lowless of the pulse seemed to oppose it."</P>
<P>I have seen several cases this year of persons that had the disease in '93 and '97, and have seen several instances of reinsection every time that the disease has appeared in the city since the year '93.</P>
<P>Hannah Norris died at M. Fisher's <ABBR>esq.</ABBR> seve∣ral weeks after having recovered from the first at∣tack in '93. Dr. Pleasants died under similar cir∣cumstances in '97. Mr. Young, Mr. Conoly, Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Lisle, and several others, recovered af∣ter a second attack. This year Drs. Cooper, Mease, and Leib, David Parke, Mrs. Mendenhall, and seve∣ral others, had the disease that had it before. Those cases, however, have been very few in comparison of those that have escaped it, who have once had it.</P>
<P>It appears from Dr. Stark's dissections, that an in∣flammation of the stomach, however induced, is at∣tended with the same symptoms as the yellow fever; and that what is called the black vomit is owing to a mortification of the vellous coat of the stomach,
<PB N="106" REF="033589_0107_0FF7935067773DB0"/>
and blood which has escaped from the dilated ves∣sels and become putrid.</P>
<P>[See Stark's Clinical and Anato∣mical Observations.]</P>
<P>It appears from Dr. Crawford's experiments, that the gases or aerial exhalations, extricated from the flesh of animals, by putrefaction, consist of animal hepatic air, i. e. hydrogen holding sulphur in soluti∣on, with a small proportion of azotic gas, or air de∣prived of its ozygene. And the smell of the breath and of the perspirable matter, in malignant fevers, evidently demonstrate that they contain animal hep∣atic, hydrogenous gas, and not super oxygenated azote, as has been presumed by Dr. S. L. Mitchell, of New-York.</P>
<P>In these fevers a viciated secretion takes place, and the excretions occasion a similar fever when taken into a sound body.</P>

<P>The Board of Managers of the Marine and City Hospitals, felicitate their fellow-citizens on the ra∣pid decline of the prevailing fever since the 1st inst. the prosperous state of the City Hospital, and enli∣vening prospect of a speedy termination of the cala∣mity, which has overwhelmed our city. None can more assiduously desire the return of their fellow-citi∣zens <HI>in safety,</HI> to the comforts of their own fire-side; but they depreciate the consequences of precipitati∣on,
<PB N="108" REF="033589_0109_0FF793578B1A0E68"/>
where so much caution and prudence is requir∣ed.</P>
<P>The apprehension of the Board has been awakened by the too hasty return of many individuals, who have inconsiderately hazarded their own health and the public welfare; several of whom, the Board are sorry to add, have been seized with the fever short∣ly after their return.</P>
<P>The weather, since the 6th inst. has been ex∣tremely unfavourable, &amp; the number of the sick have considerably encreased; which would be augmented by the accumulation of persons, particularly those from a pure atmosphere. The Board earnestly solicit public attention to considerations so important; and entreat the forbearance of their fellow-citizens, until returning health shall invite them home.</P>
<P>The Board cannot too strongly impress the pro∣priety and necessity of cleansing and purifying, (pre∣vious to the return of the inhabitants), the bedding, cloathing, and houses, in which the disease has ex∣isted; for which purpose, they recommend <HI>the libe∣ral use of lime.</HI> They also repeat their recommen∣dation to the commissioners, to have the pumps fre∣quently and copiously worked, as the water is ex∣tremely offensive and unwholesome.</P>
<P>The Board assure their fellow-citizens that when∣ever the health of the City and Liberties shall be so restored as to admit of the return of the inhabitants with safety, not a moment shall be delayed in an∣nouncing the glad tidings.</P>

<P>The Richmond papers state, that one-sixth part of the usual number of the inhabitants residing at City-point, near Petersburgh, Virginia, have been swept off in the course of about 20 days; that the fatal malady was spread by the ship Nestor, of Portland, Capt. Wait, which vessel arrived at City-point from Philadelphia, on the 24th of August, having thrown four dead hands overboard on her passage. Being without hands to load with tobacco, negroes were called upon, and out of eleven thus employed, ten have died.</P>
<P>Almost every case can be traced to this vessel.</P>
<P>Among the victims in the fever at City-point, are William H. Hanson, Deputy Collector, and Robert Walker Surveyor of that port.</P>

On Sunday he requested of me leave to go down the river to see a ship, (for he had never seen one) and as he was a good fellow, and seldom out, I consen∣ted, with a charge of good behaviour. With him went a party of five youths, and having to wait for the flood tide, they did not return till late in the night. The two succeeding days he was well, but on Wednesday was taken with an ague, pains in his joints, eyes inflamed, and vomiting of bile; and af∣ter

him, the same day, the captain and all but one were taken sick in the same way. Yesterday the physician bled him twice, and left him at night in extreme danger. This morning he sends for ano∣ther physician to consult the case.</P>

<P>It seems difficult to ascertain the rise and pro∣gress of this fatal disease; but the circumstances re∣lated are these:</P>
<P>1st. I understand the ship Nestor, in which the suspected infection came, was from Philadelphia or Boston; but what passage she had, I know not.</P>
<P>2d. 'Tis reported that three sailors died on board before she reached City Point.</P>
<P>3d. Before my youth went on board, a negro ashore advised him not to go there, for people had died in that ship of the fever; and when the captain came ashore with the boat for them, he refused go∣ing; but the captain seriously avered that the negro was angry with him, and reported this maliciously to the young men, who at length consented to go.</P>
<P>4th. The ship had nothing in but dirt balast from the town she left, and it being Sunday, all or chief part of the hands were ashore. The day be∣fore, they had pumped out of her several gallons of fetid bilge water, the scent of which even then remain∣ed unpleasant, for it had been in her some weeks.—Most of the hands who pumped it sickened and died, as did several of those who helped to land the bal∣last.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="033589_0112_0FF7935CCD523F70"/>
5th. Since the youths left the ship, several per∣sons in that neighbourhood have died of the like fe∣ver, and Dr. Walker, who visited them while a black vomiting was on some of them, is now very sick in the house opposite us, but I hope is recover∣ing.</P>
<P>6th. The youths left the ship at 6 o'clock P. M. and from getting aground frequently did not re∣turn home before midnight. In the day they were exposed to an hot sun, and at night to an heavy dew.</P>
<P>7th. On the Tuesday of that same week, at 12 o'clock, my lad was taken with an ague, and before night every one of the party that went in the vessel had an high fever, but two of the negroes who went to row and avoided the ship, escaped the fever.—Many are willing to attribute the disease to the af∣fects of the sun and dew, and say these negroes kept up perspiration by rowing home, while the whites lay exposed to the cool dew in an open boat. My youth was bled on Wednesday morning, but his veins were so small and low, that Dr. Shore could not let as much blood as he wished, (only a tea cup full) for they approve of copious bleeding. His complaint was a deadly sickness at the stomach, with pains in every limb, attended with frequent vomit∣ing of yellow bile. During his disorder he took a quantity of pills which operated well; injections were administered; each temple cup'd; stomach and legs blistered; and the last medicine given was, I believe, an emetic powder. On Saturday he was very restless, and at night a delirium and stupor came on; thus he remained till Sunday, when the above emetic was given, soon after which he made some efforts to vomit, but did not; his eyes began to vi∣brate exceedingly, and with much oppression at his breast, he expired. His corps was not more yellow
<PB N="112" REF="033589_0113_0FF79361E8018038"/>
than usual; four persons were interred when he was, carried off by fevers, I believe.</P>
<P>The captain (Wilson) of the ship Delight, which lay near the Nestor, and with whom the youths dined, did not live so long as my lad; but he was a very intemperate man, even in his sickness, and had been on Monday exposed to wet and the heat of the sun. He died in town, distracted with the fever and liquor he drank when he came up.—The eyes of every one were remarkably glassy, in∣flamed, but not red as is generally represented.</P>
<P>This summer I went to the tin factory opposite us, to get some tin which they kept in a back house; the yard was so excessive filthy, I asked them if they were hatching the yellow fever? they hoped not; but every creature of them have had a fever like the above; some had it before the shipping came; and several about this town have the like fever, but are chiefly on the recovery. One Mr. Cooper, an En∣glish merchant at Blandford, (in this town) died yes∣terday morning; and I suppose there are four or five in town sick of the same disease. Our family physician is just recovering; his head was blistered, and he was delirious several days. One of the tin∣ners told me he suffered more with it in one day, than with all the pain and sickness of his whole life, (which was 30 years) and could get no relief till the doctor allowed him to drink cold water in small draughts at a time. This enabled him to keep his medicine down, which he could not do before. Our physicians think the disease originates from the sun, heat, dew, filth, &amp;c.—probably it does, for no one caught it of my young man; and had it been the small-pox, I dare say they would have felt the affects of it. Every dose of medicine I gave him with my own hand, that he might have a fair chance. I used no preventative, but burnt tar frequently in the
<PB N="113" REF="033589_0114_0FF79363870B9AA8"/>
house and sprinkled it fore and aft with vinegar, keeping every window open day and night. Since writing the above, I understand that two of the Rich∣mond craft, that had been employed at one of these ships, lost almost every hand on board; one of them had only a boy left. We have cool nights now, but the middle of the day is very warm and dry. When our family physician (Dr. Shore) recovers, you shall know more of this fever. I have been much confi∣ned at home; and as City Point is 12 miles off, and several ships have been there, I cannot get a satis∣factory account of it. I believe several died in one of the ships at the Cape, but the captain endeavoured to conceal it, that it might not prevent his getting hands. Your friend and servant.</P>

<P>The following account, delivered me in writing this morning, by C. Marshall, jun. who resided in the neighbourhood, where the facts occurred, (and collected at my request) incontrovertibly proves, that the yellow fever is not contagious in the air of cities only, but is sometimes contagious in situations that are noted for salubrity:</P>
<P>Elizabeth Johnson, about 10 years of age, came from Philadelphia to her mother's (the widow John∣son) the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of August; was taken ill with the fever on the 10th, and died on the 13th.—Elizabeth Duy, a near neighbour who had been several times to vi∣sit E.

Duy, and visited her in her sickness, was taken with fever on the 29th of August, and died the 3d of September.—Charles, son of Mary Hubbs, was taken with the fever the same day, with his mother, and recovered in the course of a week.—Christ. Duy, husband of Eliza∣beth, was taken ill on the 16th of September, and
<PB N="115" REF="033589_0116_0FF79366CE0F6168"/>
died on the 23d.—Elizabeth Johnson, mother to the first mentioned Elizabeth, was taken ill the 21st of September, and died on the 29th.—Joseph Fisher and his wife had an apartment at Christ. Duy's. Jo∣seph Fisher's wife took sick soon after the death of C. Duy, and recovered.—Joseph Fisher was taken ill on the 22d of September, and died on the 27th.—The widow Johnson's servant maid was taken ill about the same time with E. Johnson, and recovered in 8 days. Elizabeth Star, who lived in Mrs. John∣son's family, was taken ill on the 27th of September, and died on the 14th of October, though she had been freely salivated. None of the above had been in the city for several weeks.</P>

<P>Thirty-six patients sick at the encampment to∣day—most part with light complaints, such as ca∣tarrh and diarrhoea. Only two new cases of malig∣nant fever have occurred at the encampment for some days. One of these has been ill eleven days—had the black vomit ever since the 7th, from the attack—is at this instant with scarcely any appear∣ance of life. This woman, whose name is Makit∣trick, was attacked five days after a visit to the city—Takes lime water and fresh milk. Peter Tryon, the other case of the yellow fever, was attacked the day after he came to the encampment—this his 3d day.</P>
<P>From comparing the effects of mercury, in differ∣ent cases, it appears to me, now, to be proper to excite salivation in every case where malignant symp∣toms are evident at an early period of the fever; but that it is superfluous, if not injurious, to induce sa∣livation in cases where inflammatory symptoms are predominant, till these are induced by sufficient
<PB N="116" REF="033589_0117_0FF7936C525D4F28"/>
blood-letting and purging, which in the majority of cases so circumstanced, cure the disease without the aid of any additional remedy. The yellow fever corresponds in this respect with the variolous fever, or small-pox. In those cases where the eruption appears with a confluent aspect, accompanied with great debility, oppression, and uneasiness about the region of the heart, mercury has been long recom∣mended by several eminent physicians as a more effectual remedy than any other, when restrained by the addition of opium, from occasioning frequent evacuations by the bowels. But I believe no one can deem it necessary to employ so violent a reme∣dy in the distinct and simple form of the disease, when more safe ones will answer as well.</P>
<P>It was the general practice last year, as well as the present, to give mercury in all cases indiscrimi∣nately, which was certainly injudicious, and in ma∣ny cases retarded the cure, especially in cases ac∣companied with inflammatory symptoms; but in cases where nervous symptoms predominated from the beginning, &amp; unaccompanied with severe pain in the head, eyes, or stomach, or with symptoms of dysen∣tery or gravel, calomel was found more successful when given in doses of two grains every two hours, and the application of two or three drachms of strong mercurial ointment to the region of the liver and to different parts of the body four times in the course of every 24 hours, restraining the mercury by the addition of a few drops of laudanum, occasional∣ly, if it occasioned more than one or two evacuati∣ons in the course of the day, till signs of salivation appeared, and no longer; the patient, at the same time, abstaining from all flesh meats and vinous li∣quors. The early and repeated application of blis∣ters, in such cases, were generally beneficial; but blood-letting did injury.</P>

<HEAD> From the Philadelphia Gazette of this date. A DESCRIPTION Of the ENCAMPMENT at Masters' place.</HEAD>
<P>THE encampment at Masters' place is an im∣mense work, considering the short period in which it was executed. Buildings comfortable, convenient, and in every respect well adapted to the occasion, have been erected in eight or nine days, sufficient to accommodate 2000 people. Besides those build∣ings, there were erected, in the same time, an hospi∣tal, a large store-house and offices, a bake-house and oven, and five kitchens, each with eight large fire places. This little town is built on a well chosen spot, and is laid out in regular order the streets in∣tersecting each other. The rules and regulations, which are printed and put up in different parts of the encampment, do honour to the heads and hearts of the committee. The entire prohibition of spi∣ritous liquors, except in cases of real necessity, is a striking feature in those excellent rules; in short, they have established a systematical police.—They punish slight offences by withholding the provisions for a reasonable time, and for those more aggrava∣ted, they expel the offender. All intercourse with the city is cut off (except on special occasions) which is enforced by placing sentinels at proper distances around the encampment, who do not permit any person to pass or repass, by night or day, without leave from one of the committee or steward. Sca∣vengers are also appointed, whose duty it is every morning to remove all the filth and to throw fresh earth into the necessaries. The people are compel∣led to expose their bedding to the sun and air at least three times a week, and to wash their cloathing frequently.</P>

The most scrupulous regard to justice is observed in the distribution of the provisions, which are of an excellent quality, and served out in abundance.—The strict decorum that has been so eminently main∣tained in the encampment, amongst characters too, some of whom are no doubt very abandoned, de∣monstrate the most assiduous attention in the com∣mittee as well as superior address.</P>
<P>Official accounts state, that the fever has so far subsided at Boston, as to render it perfectly safe for the inhabitants to return, and prosecute their busi∣ness as usual.</P>
<P>(P. G.)</P>
<P>A letter to the Editor of the Chro. from Phila. mentions, "that in that city and New-York, 21 printers have fallen vactims to the terrible calamity which has desolated those places. To what cause to attribute this uncommon mortality, puzzles many—but in my opinion," adds our correspondent, "it has arisen from so large a number deeming it their duty to be found at their posts: while most other professions fled. I know nothing peculiarly attrac∣tive of disease in the materials used in printing-offi∣ces—but as nothing but flight can save, if it appears at another season, I shall consider it a bounden duty to avoid it."</P>

<P>If I am not unaccountably deceived, the present prevailing fever, in many respects, bears a great re∣semblance to the small-pox. They are both more malignant in some constitutions than others; they are both less fatal to children and the generality of women than to men. They are both more fatal to men addicted to intemperate and voluptuous living; the gross and the corpulent, than to temperate li∣vers, who are engaged in active occupations.</P>
<P>Hence like small pox, the preparation requisite to render the disease mild and safe, must vary with the temperament and constitution of each individu∣al.</P>
<P>Where the inflammatory diathesis predominates, which is commonly the case in children from two to twelve years of age, and to young persons accus∣tomed to activity in the open air, mercury is not a proper preparative; but in all cases where the want of vigour is manifest, and a disposition to diseases of debility, or the nervous type, are evident, mercury, and in such manner as not to evacuate much, in all probability must be among the first preparatives to be found in the Materia Medica. In the cure, I am certain it can only be employed with safety and with efficacy, in cases where the inflammatory diathesis, is not considerable; or in cases of nervous and sep∣tic tendency,</P>
<P>The incautious and too copious employment of mercury has in several instances been followed by the most deplorable effects. In some cases it has occasioned not only the loss of teeth, but of part of the jaw bone. In some, a rigid contraction of the lower jaw—a gangrene of, and consequent loss
<PB N="121" REF="033589_0122_0FF79377D42AE720"/>
of part of one of the cheeks—the tonsils and palate—loss of speech, &amp;c. The sphacelus and conse∣quent erosions in some cases have been followed by profuse discharges of blood, which have put a spee∣dy period to the patient's life. These facts are mentioned to put less experienced physicians upon their guard, and to prevent them from acting like the Hungarian physicians, mentioned by Kramer and Lind, who, because they had seen beneficial ef∣fects from mercury in syphilitic ulcers, could not be persuaded that it would not have a similar affect in cases of scurvy, but gave it to 400 patients and kill∣ed them to a man.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>HAVING in the preceding Memoirs, noted the rise, progress, and fatal effects of the fever, lately prevalent in this city, and other parts of this country, (the contagious nature of which is acknowledged by all, excepting a few persons that are distinguished for nothing but the singularity of their opinions, and a pertinacious adherence to a tenet, which both by the illustrations of reasoning and the common sense of their fellow citizens, has been declared absurd and utenable.) I shall now pro∣ceed to state such evidence as has come to my know∣ledge, respecting the origin of the disease, the cer∣tainty of which is of the highest importance to the future interest and prosperity of this country in ge∣neral, and to Philadelphia in particular.</P>
<P>Certain circumstances having given rise to a sus∣picion that the contagion which gave origin to the disease was imported in the ship Deborah, which arrived at Philadelphia, from Jeremie, and anchor∣ed near Race street wharf, on the 18th of July. I made every enquiry in my power into the subject with a view of ascertaining the truth.</P>
<P>The death of the Marquis de Rouvray, imme∣diately after her arrival—of a boy that belonged to her a few days after,—of a labouring man that had worked on board her—and of Alexander Philips, who had been down to her in a boat, while she was performing quarantine, and who died on the 5th of August.—The sickness of a carpenter on the 26th of
<PB N="131" REF="033589_0132_0FF7938ED31BD0B0"/>
July at Achison Thompson's next door to Philips's, who had been on board the Deborah while unship∣ping her cargo,—the sudden death of a sailor in the same house on the 28th of July, and, the numerous cases in the neighbourhood of Philip's and Thomp∣son's a few days after, not only increased, but direc∣ted the suspicions of all that were acquainted with these circumstances, to the ship Deborah.</P>
<P>It appears from facts collected by Dr. Daniel De Beneville, and communicated in writing to Dr. Grif∣fitts, that the first person that had the yellow fever in Kensington, (to which place the Deborah had re∣moved for the purpose of undergoing repairs on the 28th. of July), was a lad of the name of Joseph Streeton, that had been on board of her while she lay in the city—This lad was taken sick on the 29th, of July and died the 3d of August.</P>
<P>James Porter, apprentice to Joseph Grice, ship carpenter, next door to Streeton's, was taken with the fever on the 1st. of August, and died on the twelfth.</P>
<P>James Ashmore, an apprentice to Wm. Yard, ship carpenter, who had worked on board the De∣borah, while she lay in the city was attacked with the fever, on the 2d. of August, and died on the fifteenth.</P>
<P>James Kerr, George Adams, and one Simons, all apprentices to Wm. Yard, worked on board the Deborah, and were all taken sick a few days after James Ashmore, and all recovered.</P>
<P>Two labouring men, who worked on board the Deborah, were taken sick on the 3d. of August, one died, the other recovered. Samuel Baker, Dr. De Beneville, his wife and house keeper, who resided near the wharf where the Deborah lay, were all attacked with the fever, in the course of a week after her arrival at Kensington; and before the mid∣dle of August the whole neighbourhood was infected.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="033589_0133_0FF793917B217B50"/>
That the Deborah was an infected vessel, appears evident, from the testimony of her mate, Mr. John Lewis, the carpenter that was with her, during the whole voyage, the cook, several seamen, and a passenger of the name of Dickison—all of whom agree, that she lost seven persons with a fever, on her passage from Jeremie, to Philadelphia, and five of her crew, while in the port of Jeremie.—Mr. Lewis the mate of the Deborah, informed me in presence of two witnesses that the Deborah had been employed as a transport for the British troops at St. Domingo, for some time previous to her taking in her cargo, at Jeremie.</P>
<P>Dr. Wistar, was informed by the cooper; of the deaths on board, and the carpenter, John Bodin's deposition was taken by the mayor of Burlington.</P>
<P>Captain Yard, himself sometime after his arrival in Philadelphia, in conversation with a gentleman whose testimony may be relied on, acknowledged that while the Deborah lay at Jeremie, a very mor∣tal disease was prevalent there, which the natives called the Malad, de Siam, of which the captain, and the chief part of the crew of an English ship from Liverpool, died, and the rest were so terrified that they deserted the ship.</P>
<P>When the Deborah arrived at the Health-Office near the fort, with about an hundred persons on board including passengers,—two of the seamen who appeared to be in a convalescent state, were taken to the Marine Hospital, and a black woman.</P>
<P>These men Mr. Lewis says, were in the city be∣fore the ship.</P>
<P>Atchison Thompson and Mr. Doyle, neighbours to Philips when he was alive, solemnly declare that Philips brought a man belonging to the Debo∣rah to his house, before the arrival of the ship.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Griffitts prescribed for one of the crew of the Deborah at Phil∣ips's while he lay ill who had taken lodgings there 24th of July. The phy∣sician of port informed the college of physicians, that one of the crew of the Deborah died at the Marine Hospital; and that two pilots, that conducted the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>al and the Aurora, died there about the same time.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="033589_0134_0FF7939543B9D3B0"/>
The size and martial appearance of the Deborah, (for she carried several guns) led a number of young men and boys to visit her; among, others, was a lad of the name of James Wright, and a young man belonging to Mr. Clemens. The former lived in Water above Chesnut street, the latter in Third near Walnut street, one of these was attacked the 30th, the other the 31st of July. The latter died on the 6th day from the attack, the former recovered.</P>
<P>As the disease appeared about this time in different parts of the city, which had been uncommonly healthy all the preceding season, it is probable that others suffered from the like inconsiderate curiosity.</P>
<P>From these as from a focus, it gradually diverged over the whole city.</P>
<P>A Brig from Jamaica, with Coffee, some of which was damaged, arrived at Mr. Ross's wharf, in the neighbourhood where the disease made its first and most formidable assault, on the 29th of July, but as the disease had made some progress before that date, there can be no room for suspecting that to have given origin to it. Besides there are no facts in proof of a fever of a contagious kind ever having been produced either by damaged vegetables or by the exhalations from bilge water, as I have sufficiently shewn in my Observations on the Cause and Cure of Bilious Fevers, published last year.</P>
<P>But that the contagion which gives rise to such a fever as the one under consideration, may be re∣tained in an active state, in the clothing of these that have been sick or that have died of it, for seve∣ral weeks if excluded from fresh air, is well known to those conversant with medical history.</P>
<P>We are informed in the last edition of the works
<PB N="134" REF="033589_0135_0FF79396E207AF68"/>
of the late learned Dr. Mead, that a sack of infected cotton imported into Bermudas in the year 1695. gave origin to a fever so malignant, that the living scarcely sufficed to bury the dead. It is also record∣ed, that the imprisoned seeds of a pestilential fever, which depopulated Marseilles in the year 1720, made their escape from a sailor's bundle, lately arrived from the Levant.</P>
<P>The importation of the contagion which gave rise to the plague in London in the year 1665, and al∣most depopulated that city in the course of the sum∣mer and autumnal months, is a fact too notorious to expatiate upon. A similar fever, which destroyed 80,000 of the inhabitants of Moscow and the adja∣cent villages in 1771, was introduced by Turkish prisoners, as appears from the account of Mertins, one of the physicians appointed by the empress to attend the infected. This fever, like the one with which we have been visited, yielded to the power of frost. We have the authority of the experienced Lind, that the yellow fever was introduced into Phi∣ladelphia in the year 1741 by a trunk of infected cloathing received from Barbadoes; and of Dr. Lining, that every time it had appeared in Charles∣ton, it had been traced to some person or vessel re∣cently arrived from the West-Indies.</P>
<P>The yellow fever which prevailed in New-Haven in the year 1794, was traced to imported contagion, as appears from the statement of Dr. Monson, pub∣lished in Webster's collection of papers on bilious fevers. For more examples of the same kind, I refer to a book which I published last year, entitled, "Obser∣vations on the Causes and Cure of Bilious Fevers."</P>
<P>The introduction of the disease into Chester, Marcus-Hook and Wilmington, soon after its ap∣pearance in Philadelphia, are additional proofs in support of the opinion that the late fever was derived from imported contagion.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="033589_0136_0FF793987AA14AE8"/>
A lad belonging to John Wood, a potter, who had slept two nights on board a shallop employed in trading to Philadelphia a short time before he was taken ill, was the first that died of the yellow fever in Chester, and he died on the 31st day of July.—Another lad that had slept on board the same shal∣lop with Mr. Wood's lad, was taken ill the same day but recovered in the course of a week. The one that died had the black vomit, and his corpse became very yellow.</P>
<P>Seven days after the decease of the first mention∣ed lad, his mother and brother were both attacked with fever, and the brother was buried 11 days af∣ter.</P>
<P>William Siddons, jun. who had set up with the first mentioned lads during their illness, was taken with the fever on the first of August, and died the 8th. Charles Warrick, who had also visited them, was attacked with fever the 4th of August and di∣ed the 9th. Abby Engle, who lived next door to Siddons, died the 16th of August. Jesse Bicker∣ton, at whose house Abby Engle died, was attacked a few days after her decease, on board his shallop at the Fort, and died on the 28th of August. After the first of September, the disease spread into every part of that village, which contained but about 50 families, and before it ceased, destroyed 50 persons, several of whom were of the first note in the place; though it was gradually deserted by all, excepting six or seven families. Of all that were sick at Chester, there were not more than five or six that recovered.</P>
<P>The disease appears to have been introduced into Marcus-Hook by infected persons from Philadel∣phia. The first death was on the 10th of August.—From the list kept by R. Riley, <ABBR>esq.</ABBR> it appears that the funerals at Marcus-Hook were 21 adults and 6 children, inhabitants; and 24 strangers—Total—52.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Dr. Sayres, dated Marcus Hook, November, 24, 1798.</HEAD>
<P>THE first case of yellow fever, that came under my notice in Marcus Hook, was on August 2d. 1798. This was a shallop man, who came from Philadelphia, four days previous to the attack of the Fever—he died, the 6th. day of the disease, with the highest symptoms of putrescency. The next five cases of disease, were persons, who were but a few days from Philadelphia, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from two to eight days. The disease, appeared to increase consider∣ably in this place, and in Chester, by the 20th. of August; The symptoms on the first attack, were more strongly marked—and the proportionate number of deaths, were much increased by the first of September. The number of cases which came under my notice from the second day of August, until the 26th. of October, was eighty two—Fifty-seven of these, died.</P>
<P>The greater part of those, who were lately from Philadelphia, died between the second and the sixth day after their attack. The inhabitants of this place and Chester, who had the disease, and had not been in Philadelphia, recovered in greater proportion.</P>
<P>The disease appeared, in a number of cases, evi∣dently communicated by contagion—in some cases from the sick—and several cases from the bed linen, &amp;c.—Though in a considerable number of cases, which speedily terminated fatally, I was not able to trace the smallest vestige of contagion, being pre∣viously applied, or received.</P>
<P>Free and copious bleeding was made use of in the first stage with evident advantage in most cases. We bled in very few instances, with success, after forty eight hours from the attack of the disease.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="033589_0138_0FF77DF1F149EF68"/>
The greatest number of successful cases, were, where free bleeding was instantly used, before the fever had continued many hours; and immediately followed by a free use of calomel, &amp;c. so as to ope∣rate very freely and copiously upon the alimentary canal, and free sweating afterwards. In general, our cases terminated unfortunately, except we found salutary symptoms appear in sixty hours from the attack.</P>
<P>Blisters were used freely, after symptoms of high debility took place—and in some cases with mani∣fest advantage. In no instance that I saw, was bleeding successful, after two days and an half—but when used in a few of such cases, it appeared evidently to sink the patient and to hasten his death.</P>
<P>We used bark, wine, and a number of the com∣mon stimulants, on the first appearance of debility taking place; but with little success.</P>
<P>Finding the common round, of medicine, prove so ineffectual in the advanced stage of the disease, I determined to use a different mode of treatment—in three cases of adults, two of which had the black vomiting on them, and the third, was in a gore of putrid blood from the mouth and nose. I forbid medicine, and directed very cold water and brandy mixed strong, to be given freely as possible:—It had the happy effect of checking the puking in the two cases, when the stomach had rejected every kind of mild drink, &amp;c. and by continuing that practice, almost so as to produce high intoxication, for two or three days, those two cases, were recover∣ed almost from a state of death. The third case, was much benefited apparently for three days—but, be∣ing in a high putrescent state when I went first to see him, and having lost a very considerable quantity of blood from the mouth, nose, &amp;c. his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se proved unfortunate on the ninth day.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="033589_0139_0FF793A0BA3BD258"/>
There was a number of seamen died here, with the disease, though from no single vessel, (except∣ing the Ganges) more than two or three.</P>
<P>"We were seldom able to produce ptyalism, be∣fore the disease terminated fatally. In every case where mercury affected the salivary glands at an early period of the disease, the patient recovered—and I observed that immediately after the spitting took place, every favourable symptom of return∣ing health began to appear."</P>

<P>The editor has been favoured with letters from Doctors Tilton and Monro, giving an account of the time and manner of the introduction of the yellow fever into Wilmington, from which the following particulars are extracted:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Wilmington, <DATE>November 13, '98.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE first case of yellow fever which happened in Wilmington, this season, was in the person of one of the inhabitants of the borough, who caught it in Philadelphia about the 1st of August, sickened on the road home, and died soon after. The contagi∣on was not communicated from this case. The Philadelphians flocked in upon us immediately af∣terwards. I visited a young man from Philadelphia, in the fever, on the 10th of the same month. This man was among the first, if not the very first, that was sent to our newly instituted Hospital. The fe∣ver became epidemic between the 15th and 20th.—It commenced with persons immediately from Phila∣delphia, as well inhabitants of the borough, as of the city. Shallop-men and others, who passed from one place to the other, by water, were the first victims. From these it extended rapidly to the inhabitants of fixed residence. A ship manned chiefly by French royalists, that entered our port after the sickness had
<PB N="139" REF="033589_0140_0FF793A252185EB8"/>
commenced, was also suspected of contributing to the evil; but of this I have no evidence. From all the information that came to my knowledge, every physician of this place, and all others of correct ob∣servation agree, that the disease was imported to us from Philadelphia, by infected goods and furniture, as well as infected persons. We suppose the disease to be propagated by contagion, from infected per∣sons, cloathing, vessels, houses, &amp;c. It is remark∣able, however, that stronger exhalations arise from persons affected by this fever, than in other fe∣brile diseases; and we have reason to believe that many were affected by the contagion, at a distance from the sick reaching quite across our streets. No instance of those who sled to the country communi∣cating it to others, has come to my knowledge with∣in the vicinity of Wilmington. It is said that in∣stances of this sort have happened at Marcus-Hook and other places; but for these I cannot vouch.</P>
<P>In another letter I shall be ambitious to make some compensation for your former valuable favour to me, by a few observations, particularly on the cholera infantum, that may not be unacceptable to you: for you will admit, that the Delaware physi∣cians ought to be of authority in bilious disorders.</P>

<P>Dr. Monro's letter of the 19th November, con∣firms Dr. Tilton's account of the time <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manner of the introduction of the disease into Wilmington, and of its being afterwards communicated by the inhabitants of fixed residence, from one to another.</P>

<P>"One half of all the sick that were sent to the tents died." This Dr. Monro ascribes to the abso∣lute interdection of the use of mercury there.

<P>It is now known that a lad of the name of Dag∣get, was attacked with the yellow fever the 26th of July, on board the schooner John, from Boston, which lay at Ross and Simpson's wharf, a little way below Walnut-street. Mr. Lloyd and his clerk had been on board of her a few days before their attack; and a woman and two of the hands died (according to the report of the master to Dr. Dorsey) on her outward passage.</P>
<P>An unanswerable argument that the fever did not originate from domestic causes, is afforded by the exemption of Baltimore, Georgetown, Alexandria, Norfolk, Wilmington, (N. C.) Charleston, and Sa∣vannah.</P>
<P>The disease this year prevailed, and was attended with a degree of mortality unexampled in this coun∣try, (considering the comparative smallness of the number that remained within the sphere of the con∣tagion)
<PB N="141" REF="033589_0142_0FF793A69F9363A8"/>
in all the commercial towns north of Balti∣timore; whereas all the commercial towns south of Baltimore have escaped, Petersburg excepted, and the disease was introduced into Petersburg by the ship Nestor from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Is it possible to believe, that the late fever, (which is considered by the advocates for its domestic ori∣gin, to be only a higher grade of the common bili∣ous fever which appears in low marshy countries every summer and autumn) could originate and be∣come epidemic on the high, dry and sandy banks of Kensington? in the paved, clean and open streets of Philadelphia, where every wind that blows has a free course? on the high and gravelly hills of Wil∣mington? on the elevated shores of York, washed on either side by Ocean's briny waves? and not make its appearance on the flats of Baltimore, or the putrid fens of Charleston and Savannah, where bile flows in incessant streams; and where the debilitated inhabitants faint under the insufferable blaze of a vertical sun?</P>
<P>If the united opinion of a number of men of the first abilities and most extensive professional know∣ledge be of authority on the present interesting ques∣tion, that of the College of Physicians, presented last year to the Legislature, ought to be admitted: the substance of which follows. The College is in possession of still stronger facts and documents in support of their opinion this year.</P>
<P>"The College is of opinion, that the yellow fever is derived from imported contagion. For this opi∣nion they assign the following among other reasons: "The disease in question is essentially different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which ori∣ginate from domestic causes. It also differs essenti∣ally from them in the circumstance of being conta∣gious; a bilious fever originating from domestic
<PB N="142" REF="033589_0143_0FF793AAAE2AF840"/>
causes having never been to our knowledge contagi∣ous in this climate."</P>
<P>And that the yellow fever, which has committed such deplorable ravages in different commercial ci∣ties of these states, since the year 1793, was not de∣rived from the exhalations of putrid vegetable sub∣stances, which occasion intermitting, remitting, or bilious fevers, but was of pestilential origin, is fully established by the facts published in the year 1795, by Dr. Chisholm, surgeon-general to the Ordinance in the West-India Islands, to which valuable publi∣cation the reader is referred.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="033589_0144_0FF793AC684A1E10"/>
PRESUMING that the public mind will no longer be held in suspense respecting the origin of the fatal malady by which the fair pros∣pects, of this, and other commercial cities, in this country, have been repeatedly blasted; I trust the legislature, the enlightened guardians of the public welfare, will proceed, without delay, to establish more effectual rules, than those, at present existing, to prevent the future return of the awful calamity.</P>
<P>Supineness or an ill judged parsimony on the pre∣sent interesting occasion, would force commerce to desert our coasts, and involve the inhabitants of our cities, in absolute ruin, which would soon be followed by that of agriculture, for the existence of the one, is necessary to that of the other.</P>
<P>It has lately been proposed by a respectable com∣mittee of the inhabitants of this city, to petition either for an intire interdiction of the West India trade, during the summer, and autumnal months, or, (if that should be thought too great a sacrifice), for the establishment of such quarantine rules, as shall effectually preclude the introduction of the disease.</P>
<P>To effect this desirable purpose, I beg leave to recommend the rules published in the Gazette of the United States, of the 21st of September, signed, <HI>Mentor;</HI> and to prevent it from spreading when introduced, I believe the rules with the same signature published in the Gaz. of the U. S. of Septr. 25th or 26th, if strictly complied with, will
<PB N="144" REF="033589_0145_0FF793AE1DAD9478"/>
always be found effectual. Similar rules were put in practice with the most happy effects, the present year, not only in the Pennsylvania Hospital, by Mr. Samuel Coats, who resided there, during the con∣tinuance of the fever, and in the Alms-House, by Mr. Cummins, and Dr. James, where the pen∣sioners and orphans were numerous, but in the prison for convicts, under the direction of the American Howard, who took his residence in that dreary and dangerous abode, about the 20th. of September, at which time the disease had made con∣siderable havoc among those wretched votaries of rapine and disorder.</P>
<P>The number of male convicts confined in the pri∣son at that time was about 140; The females were less numerous.</P>
<P>The vagrants and untried criminals had been re∣moved.</P>
<P>The males and females were confined in separate, and distant wings of the prison.</P>
<P>Eighteen of the male criminls, on account of their late insurrection, were confined in dungeons; the remainder occupied different apartments on the same floor.</P>
<P>Several of the men were ill of the fever at that time. The women were all in health, and continu∣ed in that condition during the whole time that the disease prevailed in the city.</P>
<P>A ward in the East wing was immediately appro∣priated for the reception of the sick, who were se∣parated from the sound, and every necessary accom∣modation provided for them. These were attended by Dr. Benjamin Duffield. A separate apartment was provided for the convalescents. More nutriti∣ous aliment than they had been accustomed to, (for they had been allowed for many days only sufficient food to prevent them from famishing) with a
<PB N="145" REF="033589_0146_0FF793B36E8437E8"/>
small allowance of claret, was distributed among those that had hitherto escaped the disease, but every kind of excess and irregularity discountenanced and prohibited.</P>
<P>A quantity of green wood was removed from the yard, as well as cart loads of dirt, litter and every putrifiable material that could be discovered; the obstructed channel opened for the passage of the wa∣ter; the pavement kept continually wet and cool, by means of the pump; the vegetables along the wall cherished; the occupation of stone-sawing carried on; cleanliness was strictly observed; every Ward constantly ventilated, and the avoiding all intercourse (this last by the direction of the physician) earnestly enjoined. By these means the disease was arrested in its progress, and in the course of three weeks was entirely eradicated.</P>
<P>Let others profit by this example, and merit the benediction of an approving conscience, sweeter than the plaudits of an admiring world.</P>
