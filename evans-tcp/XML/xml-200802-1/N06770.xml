<P>And Ruth said, intreat me not to leave thee, or to re∣turn from following after thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy People shall be my People and thy God my God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Things that we have the History of in this Book of <HI>Ruth,</HI> seem to be inserted into the cannon of the Scripture especially on two Accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because Christ was of Ruth's Posterity. The Holy Ghost thought fit to take particular Notice of that Marriage of Boaz with Ruth, whence sprang the Savior of the World. — We may often observe it, that the Holy Spirit that indited the Scriptures often takes Notice of little Things, minute Occurrences, that do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t remotely relate to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Because this History seems to be typical of the Call∣ing of the Gentile Church, and indeed of the Conversion of eve∣ry Believer. Ruth was not originally of Israel, but was a Moab∣itess▪ and Alien from the Common-wealth of Israel: But she forsook her own People, and the Idols of the Gentiles, to wor∣ship the God of Israel, and to join herself to that People: Here∣in she seems to be a Type of the Gentile Church, and also of e∣very sincere convert. Ruth was the Mother of Christ; he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of her Posterity: so the Church is Christ's Mother, as she is re∣presented <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. at the Beginning. And so also is every true Christian his Mother. Matth. 12.50. <HI>Whosoever shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do the Will of my Father which is in Heaven, the same is my Brother, Sis∣ter and Mother.</HI> Christ is what the Soul of every one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣lect is in Travail with, in the new Birth. Ruth forsook all her natural Relations, and her own Country, the Land of her Nati∣vity,
<PB N="3" REF="008589_0003_102F8A9A8A1BF788"/>
and all her former Possessions there, for the sake of the God of Israel; as every true Christian forsakes all for Christ Psalm 45.10. <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> O Daughter, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er▪ and incline thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ear; forget also there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People, and thy Father's House.</HI></P>
<P>Naomi was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow returning act of the Land of Moab, into the Land of Israel, with her two Daughters in-law, Orpha and Ruth, who well represent to us two Sorts of Professors of Religion; Or∣pha that Sort that indeed make a fair Profession, and seem to set out well, but d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e but for a while, and then turn back; Ruth that Sort that are sound and sincere, and therefore are steadfast and persevering in the Way that they have set out in. Naomi in the preceding Verses represents to these her Daughters the Difficul∣ties of their leaving their own Country to go with her. And in this Verse may be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The remarkable Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct and Behavior of Ruth on this Oc∣casion; with what inflexible Resolution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he cleaves to Naomi and follows her. When Naomi first arose to return from the Coun∣try of Moab into the Land of Israel, Orpha and Ruth both set out with her; and Naomi exherts them both to return: And they both of them wept, and seem'd as if they could not bear the Thoughts of leaving her, and appeared as if they were re∣solv'd to go with her. Verse 10. <HI>And they sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her, surely we will return with that unto the People.</HI> Then Naomi says to them again, <HI>Turn again my Daughters, go your Way, &amp;c.</HI> And then they were greatly affected again, and Orpha returned and went back. Now Ruth's Steadfastness in her Purpose had a grea∣ter Trial, but yet is not overcome▪ <HI>She cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> unto her,</HI> Ver. 14. Then Naomi speaks to her again. Ver. 15. <HI>Behold thy Sister-in-law is g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her People, and unto her Gods: return thou after thy Sister-in law.</HI> And then she shews her immova∣ble Resolution in the Text and following Verse.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would particularly observe that wherein the Virtuousness of this her Resolution consists, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was for the Sake of the God of Israel, and that she might be one of his People that she was thus resolved to cleave to Naomi. <HI>Thy People shall be my People, and thy God my God.</HI> It was for God's Sake that she did thus; and therefore her so doing is afterwards spoken of as a Virtuous Behavior in her. Chap. 2.11 12. <HI>And S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> answered and said unto her, it hath sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> been shewed me▪ all that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st done unto thy Mother-in law, since the Death of thy Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>band, &amp; how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eft thy Father and thy Mother, and the Lord of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Nativity, and art came unto a People which thou knowest was heretofore. The Lord recompence thy Work, and a full Reward

be given th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Lord God of Israel, under whose Wings thou art came to trust.</HI> She left her Father and Mother, and the Land of her Nativity, to come and <HI>trust under the Shadow of God's Wings</HI>; and she had indeed a full Reward given her, as Boaz wished; for besides immediate spiritual Blessings to her own Soul▪ &amp; eternal Rewards in another World, she was rewarded with plenti∣ful and prosperous outward Circumstances, in the Family of Bo∣az: and God raised up David and Solomon of her Seed, and es∣tablished the Crown of Israel (the People that she chose before her own People) in her Posterity, and (which is much more) of her Seed he raised up Jesus Christ, in whom all the Families of the Earth are blessed.</P>
<P>From the Words thus opened, I observe this for the Subject of my present Discourse.</P>
<P><HI>When those that we have formerly been conversant with, are turn∣ing to God and joining themselves to his People▪ it ought to be our f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Resolution that we will not leave them: but that their People shall be our People▪ and their God our God.</HI></P>
<P>It is sometimes so▪ that of those that have been conversant one with another that have dwelt together as Neighbours, and have been often together as Companions, or have been united in near Relation, and have been together in Darkness, Bondage and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti∣lery, in the Service of Satan some are enlightened and have their Minds changed, are made to see the great End of Sin, and have their Hearts turned to God, and are influenced by the Holy Spi∣rit of God to leave their Company that are on Satan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Side, to go it join themselves with that blessed Company that are with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: they are made wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake the Tents of Wickedness, to dwelt in the Land of Up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tness with the People of God.</P>
<P>And sometimes this proves a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parting or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eparation be∣tween them and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se that they have been formerly conversant with Though it may be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting in outward Respects, they may still dwell together and may converse one with another; yet in other Respects it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them at a great distance one from a∣nother: One as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and the Other the Ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of God: One is in a miserable and the Other in a happy Conditi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; One is a Citizen of the heavenly Zion▪ the Other i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under Con∣dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Hell They are no longer together in those Res∣pects wherein they used to be together: They used to be of one Mind to serve Sin▪ and do Satan's Work: now they are of con∣trary Minds: They used to be together in Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liness, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vanity, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting different Dispositions.— They are separated as they are in different Kingdoms: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

remains in the Kingdom of Darkness▪ the Other is translated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son: And sometimes they are finally separated in these Respects: While One dwells in the Land of Israel, and in the House of God; the Other, like Orpha lives and dies in the Land of Moab.</P>
<P>Now 'tis lamentable when it is thus: 'Tis awful being parted so: 'Tis doleful, when those that have formerly been together in Sin, some turn to God and join themselves with his People, that it should prove a parting between them and their former Companions and Acquaintance. — It should be our firm and in∣flexible Resolution in such a Case, that it shall be no parting, but that we will follow them, that their People shall be our People, and their God our God; and that for the following Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">I Because <HI>their God</HI> is a glorious God.

<PB N="6" REF="008589_0006_102F8AA056957A98"/>
Son of God; the Brightness of his Father's Glory; One in whom God from Eternity had infinite Delight: A Savior of infinite Love; One that has shed his own Blood, and made his Soul an Offering for their Sins; and One that is able to save them to the uttermost.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Their People</HI> are an excellent and happy People. God has re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed them, and in lamped his own Image upon them &amp; made them Partakers of his Holiness. They are more excellent than their Neighbours. <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v.</HI> 12 26. Yea, they are the excellent of the Earth, <HI>Psalm</HI> 10.3 They are lovely in the Sight of the Angels; and they have their Son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s adorned with those Graces, that in the Sight of God himself are of great Price.</P>
<P>The People of God are the most excellent and happy Society in the World. That God whom they have chosen for their God, is their Father; he has pardoned all their Sins, and they are at Peace with; and he has admitted them to all the Privileges of his Children. As they have devoted themselves to God, so God has given himself to them: He is become their Salvation and their Portion: His Power and Mercy, and all his Attributes are theirs. They are in a safe State▪ free from all Possibility of perishing: Satan has no Power to destroy them. God carries them▪ on Ea∣gle's Wings, far above Satan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Reach, and above the Reach of all the Enemies of their Souls. God is with them <HI>in this World</HI>; they have his gracious Presence; God is for them, who then can be against them? As the Mountains are round about Jerusalem, so JEHOVAH is round about them. God is their Shield, and their exceeding great Reward; and their Fellowship is with the Fa∣ther, and with his Son Jesus Christ: and they have the divine Promise and Oath, that <HI>in the World to come</HI> they shall dwell for∣ever in the glorious Presence of God.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may well be sufficient to induce us to resolve to cleave to those that forsake their Sins and Idols, to join themselves with this People, that God is with them. Zech 8.23. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Days it shall come to pass, that ten Men shall take ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, out of all Languages of the Nations: even shall take hold of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of him that is a Jew, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing. We will go with you: for we have hear'd that God is with you.</HI> So should Persons as it were take hold of the Skirt of their Neighbours and Companions that have turn'd to God, and resolve that they will go with them▪ because God is with them.</P>
<P N="3">III Happiness is no where else to be had, but in <HI>their God,</HI> &amp; with <HI>their People.</HI> There are that are called God's many, and Lords many. Some make Gods of their Pleasures; some choose
<PB N="7" REF="008589_0007_102F8AA580622CD0"/>
Mammon for their God; some make Gods of their own supposed Excellencies, or the outward Advantages they have above their Neighbours; some choose one thing for their God, and others a∣nother: But Men can be happy in no other God but the God of <HI>Israel.</HI> He is the only Fountain of Happiness. Other Gods can't help in Calamity; nor can any of them afford what the poor empty Soul stands in Need of. Let Men adore those other Gods never so much, and call upon them never so earnestly, and serve them never so diligently, they will nevertheless remain poor, wretched, unsatisfied, undone Creatures. All other People are miserable, but that People whose God is the Lord.—The World is divided into two Societies: There are the People of God, the little Flock of Jesus Christ, that Company that we read of Rev. 14.4. <HI>These are they which were not defiled with Women; for they are Virgins: These are they which follow the Lomb whither∣soever he goeth: These were redeemed from among Men, being the first Fruits unto God and to the Lamb.</HI> And there are those that be∣long to the Kingdom of Darkness; that are without Christ, be∣ing Aliens from the Common-wealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> Strangers from the Covenants of Promise, having no Hope, and without God in the World. All that are of this latter Company, are wretched and undone; they are the Enemies of God, and under his Wrath and Condemnation: They are the Devil's Slaves, that serve him blindfold, and are befool'd and ensnared by him, and hurried along in the broad Way to eternal Perdition.</P>
<P N="4">IV. When those that we have formerly been conversant with, are turning to God, and to his People, <HI>their Example</HI> ought to influence us. Their Example should be looked upon as the Call of God to us, to do as they have done. God, when he chan∣ges the Heart of One, calls upon Another; especially does he loudly call on those that have been their Friends and Acquaint∣ance.—We have been influenced by their Examples in Evil, and shall we cease to follow them when they make the wisest Choice that ever they made, and do the best Thing that ever he did? If we have been Companions with them in Worldliness, in Vanity, in unproffitable and sinful Conversation, it will be an hard Case, if there must be a parting now, because we be not willing to be Companions with them in Holiness, and true Happiness. Men are greatly influenced by seeing one another's Prosperity in other Things. If those that they have been much conversant with, grow rich, and obtain any great earthly Advantages, it awakens their Ambi∣tion and eager Desire after the like Prosperity: How much more should they be influenced, and stirred up to follow them, and be
<PB N="8" REF="008589_0008_102F8AA8AF0A09B8"/>
like them, when they obtain that spiritual and eternal Happiness that is infinitely more worth than all the Prosperity and Glory of this World.</P>
<P N="5">V. Our Resolutions to cleave to and follow those that are turn∣ing to God, and joining themselves to his People, ought to be fixed and strong, because of the great Difficulty of it. If we will cleave to them, and have their God for our God, and their People for our People we must mortify and deny all our Lasts, and cross every evil Appetite and Inclination, and forever part with all Sin. But our Lusts are many and violent. Sin is natu∣rally exceeding dear to us; to part with it is compared to pluck∣ing out our right Eyes. Men may refrain from wonted Ways of Sin for a little While, and may deny their Lusts in a partial Degree, with less Difficulty; but 'tis heart rending Work final∣ly to part with all Sin, and give our dearest Lusts a Bill of Di∣vorce, utterly to send them away. But this we must do if we would follow those that are truly turning to God: Yea, we must not only forsake Sin, but must, in a Sense, forsake all the World, Luke 14.33 <HI>Whosoever he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Disciple.</HI> That is, he must forsake all <HI>in his Heart</HI>▪ and must come to a thorough Disposition and Rea∣diness, <HI>actually</HI> to quit all for God, and the glorious spiritual Privileges of his People, whenever the Case may require it; and that without any Prospect of any Thing of the like Nature, or a∣ny worldly Thing whatesover to make Amends for it; and all to go into a strange Country, a Land that has hitherto been un∣seen; like Abraham, who being called of God, <HI>went out of his own Country, and from his Kindred, and from his Father's House, for a Land that God would shew him, not knowing whither he went.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was a hard Thing for Ruth to forsake her native Coun∣try, and her Father and Mother, her Kindred and Acquaintance, and all the pleasant Things she had in the Land of Moab, to dwell in the Land of Israel, where she had never been.— Naomi told her of the Difficulties once and again. They were too hard for her Sister Orpha; the Consideration of them turned her back after she was set out. Her Resolution was not firm e∣nough to overcome them. But so firmly resolved was Ruth that she break through all; she was steadfast in it, that let the Diffi∣culty be what it would, she would not leave her Mother-in law. So Persons had need to be very firm in their Resolution to con∣quer the Difficulties that are in the Way of cleaving to them that are indeed turning from Sin to God.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Our cleaving to them, and having their God for our God,

and their People for our People depends on our Resolution and Choice: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that in two Respects</P>
<P N="1">1 The Firmness of Resolution in using Means in order to it, is the <HI>the Way to have Means effectual</HI> There are Means appointed in order to our becoming some of the true Israel, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God for our God; and the thorough Use of these Means is the Way to have Success; but not a slack or flighty Use of them. — And that we may be thorough, there is need of Strength of Re∣solution, a firm and inflexible Disposition and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of Mind to be universal in the Use of Means, and to do what we do with our Might, and to persevere in it M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tth 11 12 <HI>The King∣dom of Heaven suffereth Violence and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt take it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Force.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 A choosing of their God, and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople with a full De∣termination, and with the whole Soul is <HI>the Condition of an U∣nion with them.</HI> God gives every Man his Choice in this Mat∣ter; as Orpha and Ruth had their Choice, whether they would go with Naomi into the Land of Israel, or stay in the Land of Moab. A natural Man may choose Deliverence from Hell: but no Man doth ever heartily choose God and Christ and the spiri∣tual Benefits that Christ h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s purchased, &amp; the Happiness of God's People till he is converted. On the Contrary▪ he is averse to them; he has no Relish of them; and is wholly ignorant of the inestimable Worth and Value of them.</P>
<P>Many carnal Men do seem to choose these Things▪ but do it not really; as Orpha seem'd at first to choose to forsake Moab to go into the Land of Israel: But when Naomi came to set be∣fore her the Difficulty of it, she went back; and thereby shewed that she was not fully determined in her Choice, and that her whole Soul was not in it as Ruth's was.</P>

<P>The USE that I shall make of what has been said, is to move Sinners to this Resolution, with Respect to those amongst us that have lately turned to God, and joined themselves to the Flock of Christ. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thro' the abundant Mercy and Grace of God to us in this Place, that it may be said of many of you, that are in a Christless Condition, that you have lately been left by those that were formerly with you in such a State. There are those that you have formerly been conversant with, that have lately forsaken a Life of Sin, and the Service of Satan, and have turned to God and fled to Christ, and joined themselves to that blessed Company that are with him. They formerly were with you in Sin &amp; in Misery, but now they are with you no more, in that State or Manner of Life: They are changed, and have fled from the

Wrath to come: They have chosen a life of Holiness here, and the Enjoyment of God hereafter. They were formerly your As∣sociates in Bondage and were with you in Satan's Business; but now you have their Company no longer in these Things Many of you have seen those that you live with under the same Roof, turning from being any longer with you in Sin, to be with the People of Jesus Christ. Some of you that are Husbands, have had your Wives; and some of you that are Wives have had your Husbands; some of you that are Children, have had your Parents; and Parents have had your Children; many of you have had your Brothers and Sisters; and many your near Neigh∣bours, and Acquaintance, and special Friends; many of you that are young have had your Companions: I say▪ many of you have had those that you have been thus concerned with, leaving you, forsaking that doleful Life, and wretched State that you still continue in▪ God of his good Pleasure, and wonderful Grace, hath lately caused it to be so in this Place, that Multitudes have been forsaking their old Abodes, in the Land of Moab, and under the Gods of Moab, and going into the Land of Israel, to put their Trust under the Wings of the Lord God of Israel. Tho' you and they have been nearly related, and have dwelt together, or have been often together, and intimately acquainted one with another, they have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken, and you hitherto left! O let it not be the Foundation of a final parting! But earnestly follow them; be firm in your Resolution in this Matter. Don't do as Orpha did, who tho' at first she made as though she would fol∣low Naomi, yet when she had the Difficulty of it set before her, went back: But say as Ruth, <HI>I will not leave thee, but where thou goest I will go: Thy People shall be my People, and thy God my God.</HI> Say as she said, and do as she did. Consider the Ex∣cellency of their God, and their Savior, and the Happiness of their People, the blessed State that they are in, and▪ the doleful State that you are in.</P>
<P>You that are old Sinners, that have lived long in the Service of Satan, have lately seen some that were with you, that have travell'd with you in the Paths of Sin, these many Years, that with you enjoyed great Means and Advantages, that have had Calls &amp; Warnings with you, and with you pass'd through remark∣able Times of the pouring out of God's Spirit in this Place, and have harden'd their Hearts, and stood it out with you, and with you have grown old in Sin; I say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou have seen some of them turning to God, i e▪ you have seen those Evidences of it in them whence you may rationally judge that it is so. O! let it not be

a final parting! You have been thus long together in Sin, and un∣der condemnation; let it be your firm Resolution now if possible you will be with them still, now they are in an holy and happy State, &amp; that you will go with them into the holy &amp; pleasant Land.</P>
<P>You that tell of your having been seeking Salvation for many Years though without Doubt, in a poor low Way, in comparison of what you ought to have done: You have seen some that have been with you in that Respect, that were old Sinners, and old Seekers as you are, obtaining Mercy. God has lately roused them from their Dulness, and caused them to alter their Hand, put them on more thorough Endeavors; and they have now af∣ter so long a Time, heard God's Voice, and have fled for Refuge to the Rock of Ages. Let this awaken Earnestness and Reso∣lution in you. Resolve that you will not leave them.</P>
<P>You that are in Youth, how many have you seen of your Age and Standing, that have of late hopefully chosen God for their God, and Christ for their Savior! You have followed them in Sin, and perhaps followed them into vain Company; and will you not now follow them to Christ?</P>
<P>And you that are Children, there have lately been some of your Sort that have repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted of their Sins, and have loved the Lord Jesus Christ, and trusted in him, and are become God's Children, as we have Reason to hope: Let it stir you up to re∣solve to your utmost to seek and cry to God, that you may have the like Change made in your Hearts, that their People may be your People, and their God your God.</P>
<P>You that are great Sinners, that have made yourselves distin∣guishingly guilty, by the wicked Practices you have lived in, there are some of your Sort that have lately (as we have Reason to hope) had their Hearts broken for Sin, and have forsaken it▪ and have trusted in the Blood of Christ for the Pardon of it, and have chosen an holy Life, and have betaken themselves to the Ways of Wisdom: Let it excite and encourage you, resolutely to cleave to them, and earnestly to follow them. Here let the following Things be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. That your Soul is as precious as theirs. It is immortal as well as theirs; and stands in as much Need of Happiness, and can as illy bear eternal Misery. You was by Nature in the same miserable Condition that they were, and had the same Wrath of God abiding on you. You must stand before the same Judge, who will be as strict in Judgment with you as with them; and your own Righteousness will stand you in no more Stead before him than theirs; and therefore you stand in as absolute Necessity

<P N="3">3 Consider the great Encouragement that God gives you, ear∣nestly to strive for the same blessing that Others have obtained. There is great Encouragement in the Word of God to Sinners, to seek Salvation; in the Revelation that we have of the abundant Provision made for the Salvation even of the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f of Sinners, and in the Appointment of so many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leans to be used with and by Sinners, in order to their Salvation; and by the Blessing which God in his Word connects with the Means of his Appointment.

Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ desire that you should partake of the great Good that God has given them, and that unspeakable and eternal Blessedness that he has promised them: They wish and long for it. If you don't go with them▪ and are not still of their Company, it won't be for Want of their Wil∣lingness, but your own. That of Moses to Hobab, is the Lan∣guage of every true Saint of your Acquaintance to you. Numb. 10.29 <HI>We are jour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ying unto the Place of which the Lord said I will give it you: C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e thou with us, and we will do thee Good; for the Lord hath spoken Good concerning Israel.</HI> As Moses, when on his Journey through the Wilderness▪ following the Pillar of Cloud and Fire, invited Hobab, that he had been acquainted with, and nearly allied to, out of the Land of Medi∣an, where Moses had formerly dwelt with him, to go with him and his People to Canaan, to partake with them in the Good that God had promised them; so do those of your Friends and Acquaintence, invite you out of a Land of Darkness and Wick∣edness, where they have formerly been with you, to go with them to the heavenly Canaan. The Company of Saints, the true Church of Christ invite you The lovely Bride calls you to the Marriage Supper. She hath Authority to invite Guests to her own Wedding; and you ought to look on her Invitation and Desire as the Call of Christ the Bridegroom; for it is the Voice of his Spirit in her, Rev. 22.17 <HI>The Spirit and the Bride say come.</HI> Where seems to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eference to what had been said, Chap 19 7, 8, 9 <HI>The Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made herself ready.

And the Son himself invites you: 'Tis he that speaks. Rev. 22.17. <HI>And let him that heareth, say come; and let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him come.</HI> He tells us who he is in the foregoing Verse. <HI>I Jesus, the Root and Offspring of David, the bright and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ning Star.</HI> And God's Ministers invite you, and all the Church invites you; and there will be Joy in the Presence of the Angels of God, that Hour that you accept of the Invitation.</P>
<P N="5">5. Consider what a doleful Company that will be that be left after this extraordinary Time of Mercy is over. We have Rea∣son to think that there will be a Number left. We read that when Ezekiel's healing Waters increased so abundently, and the healing Effect of them was so very general; yet there were cer∣tain Places where the Waters came, that never were healed. Eze. 47.9, 10.11. <HI>And it shall come to pass, that every Thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the Rivers come, shall live. And there be a very great Maltitude of Fish, because these Waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed, and every Thing shall live, whither the River cometh. And it shall come to pass, that the Fishers shall stand upon it, from En-gedi, even unto En∣eglaim; they shall be a Place to spread forth Nets: There Fish shall be according to their Kinds, as the Fish of the Great Sea, exceeding many. But the miry Places thereof, and the Marshes thereof, shall not be healed, they shall be given to Salt.</HI> And even in the Apostles Times, when there was such wonderful Success of the Gospel, yet wherever they came there were some that did not believe. Acts 13.48. <HI>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the Word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal Life believed.</HI> And Chap. 28.24 <HI>And some believed, and some believed not.</HI> So we have no Reason to expect, but there will be some left amongst us. 'Tis to be hoped it will be but a small Company: But what a dole∣ful Company will it be! How darkly and awfully will it look upon them!—If you shall be of that Company, how well may your Friends and Relations lament over you, and bemoan your dark and dangerous Circumstances!—If you would not be one of them, make haste, delay not, and look not behind you.— Shall all Sorts obtain, shall every one press into the Kingdom of God, while you stay loitering behind in a doleful, undone Condition?
