<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE design of the Author in publishing the following pages, being not merely to amuse gentlemen of the faculty, but for the general benefit of all such as may be prompted by motives of interest or curiosity to peruse them; he has endeavored for that reason to render his short treatise as intelligible as possible, by carefully avoiding the unnecessary use of technical and abstruse phrases and confining himself to as plain and familiar terms as the nature of the subject would admit.</P>
<P>But having necessarily made use in certain instances in the phraseology of the late Dr. Brown, of the terms Ex∣citability—excitability redundant and excitability ex∣hausted, has thought proper to tender the following defini∣tion as the sense in which he wishes these expressions to be understood.</P>
<P>By excitability is meant that principle of susceptibility inherent in all animated nature, but more obvious in the animal world, that capacity of being acted upon by the application of certain external agents or powers designed by the wise author of nature for the support and con∣tinuence of our animal existence; among which agents or powers are included meat, drink, exercise, air, mental passions, &amp;c. In short every thing which serves to excite or quicken the wheels of action in the system. And these agents or exciting powers are denominated stimulants.</P>
<P>By <HI>excitability redundant,</HI> is to be understood that irritable week and infeebled state of the body, induced by a privation or withholding the agency or aid of the stimu∣lating powers.</P>
<P>By <HI>excitability exhausted</HI> or wasted is meant that state of the body consequent to a too free, too strong, or a long continued application in certain cases, of the stimulating agents whereby the susceptability is overpowered and finally extinguished.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>VIEWING the ravages the Consumption has made, and is still making among mankind, and that not with an eye of indifference, and observing, that, benefit derived from medical aid in such cases, fell much short of what is common in most other complaints incident to the human frame, I was led to consider attentively the theory on which the common mode of practice was founded; to become very inquisitive about the nature of this disease; to search the writing both ancient and modern of all the authors I could obtain on the subject, and carefully to examine its progress and operation on such as were affected with it, whenever opportunity presented. In the course of these researches I discovered a new mode of practice, (first adopted by Dr. May, and after him followed by several other gentlemen of the faculty,) at∣tended with very flattering success. This mode, is by the doctor supported by reasonings, warranted by ex∣periment and justified by facts, which clearly evince, that the inflammation heat, &amp;c. in the consumption originate from a source, directly the reverse of what had hitherto been the prevailing opinion, and point out in a very striking manner the propriety of his new mode of practice. This discovery afforded me not a little consolation, and I was encouraged to hope, that the grating sounds `<HI>If you have got the consumption lay aside your physician, he will do you more harm than good,</HI>' so often pronounced by the friends of the sick, might in process of time be forever banished from my ears; but my exultation was very much eclipsed, when I found that some, be the cause what it might, were still engaged in opposition to what I supposed might be justly stiled, a new and valuable discovery; while others less callous to conviction, assented to the facts related; but at the same time, either from a wish to reconcile all parties, or out of respect to the eminency
<PB N="iv" REF="030645_0004_0FE7EE3F4BB0E3B0"/>of the sounders of the former theory, were laboring to establish a variety of the disease, notwithstanding the identity of effect produced thereby on the human frame, so incontrovertibly proves the identity of the cause.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, solicitous for the good of my countrymen and the honor of the profession (whose merit depends on their usefulness) and persuaded that every honest attempt to correct error to arrest the progress of disease, prevent its ravages and ameliorate the condition of mankind would meet with a candid and favorable re∣ception. I have ventured to write and offer the fol∣lowing sheets to the perusal of the public, in which I have endeavored to investigate the nature of the disease, by carefully attending to its predisposing and proximate causes, and by plain and simple reasoning shew the pro∣priety of the new mode. In the same method, I have endeavored to obviate such objections as occurred, by shewing the mistaken ground of the former theory and the impropriety of conceiving a variety or diversity of the disease. In prosecuting this business I found myself compelled, on account of the recency, plausibility and authority, of the writings of Dr. Rush, to make several strictures on his arguments, as he, notwithstanding his great discernment, appears still to be entangled with the old doctrine, and has offered many things in its favor; not doubting, that instead of taking umbrage at the freedom, his benevolent mind, will place him among the first to patronize this feeble effort in quest of useful philosophy, more especially when he reflects, that such is the condition of mortality, that no genius how∣ever exalted is equal to every thing, that the greatest in their attempts for useful discovery have often been foiled, while others, whose abilities would poorly com∣pare, improving on their hints, have compassed that knowledge which their wiser preceptors had in vain labored to obtain.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="030645_0005_0FE7EE453AA10C68"/>Before I dismiss this subject, it is with pleasure I acknowledge my indebtedness to this great and valuable man for his assiduous attention to all the phenomena of the sick, both in the disease treated of and every other that comes within his inspection. The fullest confidence in the accuracy and candour with which his observa∣tions are made has induced me to select such of them as suited my purpose in preference to my own and to make use of them as the basis of the following work.</P>
<P>The author considering that the greatness or obscurity of a character by which a system in any of the sciences is ushered to the world may operate to the prejudice of further investigation, either by being too implicitly fol∣lowed in the one case, or too inconsiderately rejected on the other, has chosen to withhold his name from the public and leave the fate of his performance to be de∣cided by its value in the opinion of the candid reader, to whose just strictures it is respectfully submitted, by one who ardently wishes to alleviate human misery and in∣crease the happiness of man.</P>

<HEAD>A New Treatise, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BY the term CONSUMPTION, or PHTHISIS PULMONALIS is generally understood that state of indisposition of the human system, wherein the patient is attended with a constant cough, accompanied with expectoration of purulent matter from the lungs, hectic fever, colliquative night sweats, general wasting of the body, and lastly a colliquative diarrhoea accompanied with oedematus swellings of the lower limbs; after which last ap∣pearance life soon closes its scene. This is a general discription of this fatal malady. Some variations however may be observed perhaps in viewing a vari∣ety of cases; yet there will always be a sufficient number of these leading traits to determine its species.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the following pages I have attempted to investigate its nature in order to devise some rational plan to obviate its baneful effects on the human species. It will therefore be necessary for me, <HI>Firstly,</HI> To enquire, what or whence its origin? Whether it is generated by a variety of causes, or proceeds from a simple source. <HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the nature of the disease or state of the body producing the phenomena peculiar to it? Whether this state is different in different subjects, or in other words, are there more species of the disease than one?</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Thirdly.</HI> If there is a variety, how many, and their causes and nature?</P>
<P N="4">IV. In pursuing my first enquiry it appears to me to lead to sources or powers whose operations
<PB N="2" REF="030645_0007_0FE7EE4CEF366918"/>either directly or indirectly conspire to debilitate our whole system; and far from being that local disease which has been imagined by many. Yet I think we have just reason to conclude from its effects on the lungs, that the agency of the powers <HI>inducing debility</HI> produces a greater diathesis on the lungs, than on any other given part of the system. This proposition, that it is a general disease, originating from debility has been so ingeniously treated, and clearly evinced by the celebrated Dr. Rush, in his 2 vol. medical enquiries, that I have chosen to quote his view verbatim, as his observations on this part of the subject so fully coincide with my own senti∣ments, except his strict analogy with the disease in question, and pneumoniac inflammation: in this I must beg leave to differ. He begins by saying, (page 86.)</P>
<P N="5">V.
<Q>That the Pulmonary Consumption is a disease of debility.</Q></P>
<P N="6">VI.
<Q>This I infer, 1st, from the remote and exciting causes which produce it. The remote causes, are pneumony, catarrh, haemoptysis, rheu∣matism, gout, asthma, scrophula, nervous and intermitting fevers, measles, repelled humors from the surface of the body, the veneral disease, obstructed menses, sudden growth about the age of puberty, grief, and all other debilitating pas∣sions of the mind; hypochondriasis, improper lactation, excessive evacuation of all kinds, more especially by stool,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Sir George Baker relates in the second volume of the medical transactions, that Dr. Blanchard had in∣formed him that he had seen the consumption brought on ten persons out of ninety, by excessive purging used to prepare the body for the small-pox. I have seen a case of consumption in a youth of 17, from the spitting produced by the intemperate use of segars.</Q></P></NOTE> cold and damp air, external
<PB N="3" REF="030645_0008_0FE7EE4E8B0ED750"/>violence acting upon the body;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Dr. Lind says that out of 360 patients whom he attended between July 1st, 1758, and July 1st, 1760, in consumptions, the disorder was brought on <HI>one fourth</HI> of them by falls, bruises, and strains received a year or two before the disease made its appearance.</Q></P></NOTE> and finally every thing that tends directly or indirectly to impair the vigor of the system.</Q></P>
<P N="7">VII.
<Q>The most frequent exciting cause of consumption is the alternate application of heat and cold to the whole external surface of the body, but all the remote causes which have been enu∣merated, operate as exciting causes of consump∣tion when they act on previous debility. Original injuries of the lungs seldom induce this disorder except they first induce a debility of the whole system by a troublesome and obstinate cough.</Q></P>
<P N="8">VIII.
<Q>2. From the occupations and habits of persons who are most liable to this disorder. These are studious men, and mechanics who lead seden∣tary lives in confined places; also women, and all persons of irritable habits, whether of body or mind.</Q></P>
<P N="9">IX.
<Q>3. From the period in which persons are most liable to be affected by this disorder. This is generally between the 18th and 36th year of life, a period in which the system is liable in a peculiar manner to most diseases which induce the disorder, and in which indirect debility is oftener produced than in any other stage of life, by the excessive exercises of the body and mind in the pursuits of business or pleasure.</Q></P>
<P N="10"><PB N="4" REF="030645_0009_0FE7EEF51BF9C9F8"/>X.
<Q>I have conformed to authors, in fixing the period of consumptions between the 18th and 36th year of life, but it is well known that it some∣times appears in children, and frequently in per∣sons beyond the 40th or even 50th year of life.</Q></P>
<P N="11">XI.
<Q>II. The pulmonary consumption is a pri∣mary disease of the whole system. This I infer,</Q></P>
<P N="12">XII
<Q>1. From the causes which produce it, acting upon the whole system.</Q></P>
<P N="13">XIII
<Q>2. From the symptoms of general debility which always precede the affection of the lungs. These symptoms are a quick pulse, especially towards evening; a heat and burning in the palms of the hands; faintness, head-ach, sickness at stomach, and an occasional diarrhoea. I have frequently observed each of these symptoms for several months before I have heard of a single complaint in the breast.</Q></P>
<P N="14">XIV.
<Q>3. From the pulmonary consumption alternating with other diseases which obviously belong to the whole system. I shall briefly men∣tion these diseases.</Q></P>
<P N="15">XV.
<Q>The rheumatism. I have seen many cases in which this disease and the consumption have alternately, in different seasons or years, affected the system. In the winter of 1792, three clinical patients in the Pennsylvania hospital exemplified by their complaints the truth of this observation. They were relieved several times of a cough by pains in their limbs, and as often, the pains in their limbs seemed for a while to promise a cure to their pulmonic complaints.</Q></P>
<P N="16"><PB N="5" REF="030645_0010_0FE7EEFAAA3217F0"/>XVI.
<Q>The gout has often been observed to alternate with the pulmonary consumption espe∣cially in persons in the decline of life. Dr. Sydenham describes a short cough continuing through the whole winter, as a symptom of gouty habits. A gentleman from Virginia died under my care in the spring of 1788, in the 45th year of his age, with all the symptoms of pulmonary consumption, which had frequently alternated with pains and a swelling in his feet.</Q></P>
<P N="17">XVII.
<Q>The pulmonary consumption has been observed to alternate with madness. Of this I have seen two instances, in both of which, the cough, and expectoration were wholly suspended during the continuance of the derangement of the mind. Dr. Mead mentions a melancholy case of the same kind in a young lady; and similar cases are to be met with in other authors. In all of them the disease proved fatal. In one of the cases which came under my notice, the symptoms of consumption returned before the death of the patient.</Q></P>
<P N="18">XVIII.
<Q>I have likewise witnessed two cases in which the return of reason after madness, was suddenly succeeded by a fatal pulmonary con∣sumption. Perhaps the false hopes, and even the cheerfulness which so universally occur in this disorder, may be resolved into a morbid state of the mind, produced by a general derangement of the whole system. So universal are the delusion and hopes of patients with respect to the nature and issue of this disorder, that I have never met with but one man, who, upon being asked what was the matter with him, answered unequivocally, 'that he was in a consumption!'</Q></P>
<P N="19"><PB N="6" REF="030645_0011_0FE7EEFD625E2FF0"/>XIX.
<Q>Again. Dr. Bennet mentions a case of 'a phthisical patient who was seized with a violent pain in the teeth for two days, and in whom, during that time, every symptom of a consumption, except the leanness of the body, altogether vanished;' and he adds further, 'that a defluxion on the lungs had often been relieved by salivary evacuations.'</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Treatise of the nature and cure of consumptions— exercitation X.</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P N="20">XX.
<Q>I have seen several instances in which the pulmonary symptoms have alternated with head∣ach and dyspepsia; also with pain and noise in one of the ears. This affection of the ears sometimes continues throughout the whole disease without any remission of the pulmonary symptoms. I have seen one case of a discharge of matter from the left ear without being accompanied by either pain or noise.</Q></P>
<P N="21">XXI.
<Q>In all our books of medicine are to be found cases of consumption alternating with eruptions on the skin.</Q></P>
<P N="22">XXII.
<Q>And who has not seen the pulmonary symptoms alternately relieved, and reproduced by the appearance or cessation of a diarrhoea, or pains in the bowels.</Q></P>
<P N="23">XXIII.
<Q>To these facts I shall only add, un∣der this head, as a proof of the consumption being a disease of the whole system, that it is always more or less relieved by the change which is induced in the system by pregnancy.</Q></P>
<P N="24">XXIV.
<Q>4. I infer that the pulmonary con∣sumption is a disease of the whole system from its
<PB N="7" REF="030645_0012_0FE7EF045E7B19C0"/>analogy with several other diseases which, though accompanied by local affections, are obviously produced by a morbid state of the whole system.</Q></P>
<P N="25">XXV.
<Q>The rheumatism, the gout, the measles, small-pox, the different species of cynanche; all furnish examples of the connections of local affec∣tions with a general disease; but the apoplexy, and the pneumony furnish the most striking analogies of local affection, succeeding a general disorder of the system in the pulmonary consump∣tion.</Q></P>
<P N="26">XXVI.
<Q>The most frequent cause of apoplexy is a general debility of the system, produced by intemperance in eating and drinking. The phae∣nomena of the disease are produced by an effusion of blood or serum, in consequence of a morbid distention, or of a rupture of the vessels of the brain. The pulmonary consumption begins and ends in the same way, allowing only for the differ∣ence of situation and structure of the brain and lungs. After the production of predisposing debility from the action of the remote causes formerly enumerated, the fluids are determined to the weakest part of the body. Hence effusions of serum or blood take place in the lungs. When serum is effused, a pituitous or purulent expora∣tion alone takes place; when blood is discharged, a disease is produced which has been called hae∣moptysis. An effusion of blood in the brain, brought on by the operation of general debility, has been called by Dr. Hoffman, with equal pro∣priety, haermorrhage of the brain. The effusion of blood in the lungs in consequence of the rup∣ture of a blood vessel is less fatal than the same accident when it occurs in the brain, only because
<PB N="8" REF="030645_0013_0FE7EF06076A21E0"/>the blood in the former case is more easily dis∣charged from the system. Where no rupture of a blood vessel is produced, death is nearly as speedy and certain in the one case as in the other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>I have seen two cases of sudden death from he∣moptysis. In one of them there was very little blood discharged through the mouth.</Q></P></NOTE> Dis∣sections show many cases of suffocation and death, from the lungs being preternaturally filled with blood or serum. From this great analogy between the remote and proximate causes of the two dis∣eases which have been described, I have taken the liberty to call them both by the name of apoplexy. The only symptom which does not accord with the derivation of the term, is, that in the apo∣plexy of the lungs, the patient does not fall down as if by an external stroke which is most frequently the case in the apoplexy of the brain.</Q></P>
<P N="27">XXVII.
<Q>The history of the remote and proxi∣mate causes of pneumony will furnish us with a still more remarkable analogy of the connection between a local affection, and a general disease of the system. The pneumony is produced by remote exciting causes, which act on the whole system. The whole arterial system is fre∣quently agitated by a fever in this disorder before a pain is perceived in the breast or sides, and this sever generally constitutes the strength and danger of the disease. The expectoration which termi∣nates the disorder in health, is always the effect of effusions produced by a general disease, and even the vomicas, which sometimes succeed a deficiency of bleeding in this disorder, always depend upon the same general cause. From this view of the analogy between pneumony and pulmonary consumption, it would seem that the two diseases differed from each other only by the shorter or
<PB N="9" REF="030645_0014_0FE7EF0AD3EE18B8"/>longer operation of the causes which induce them, and by the greater or less violence and duration of their symptoms. The pneumony appears to be an <HI>acute</HI> consumption, and the consumption a <HI>chronic</HI> pneumony. From the analogy of the pulmonary consumption, with the diminutive term of certain fevers, I have taken the liberty of calling it a pneumonicula.</Q></P>
<P N="28">XXVIII.
<Q>5. I infer that the pulmonary con∣sumption is a disease of the whole system, from its existence without ulcers in the lungs. Of this there are many cases recorded in books of medicine.</Q></P>
<P N="29">XXIX.
<Q>Dr. Leigh informs us in his natural history of Lancashire, that the consumption was a very common disease on the sea coast of that country; but that it was not accompanied either by previous inflammation or ulcers in the lungs. It was generally attended, he says, by an unusual peevishness of temper.</Q></P>
<P N="30">XXX.
<Q>6. And lastly, I infer, that the pulmo∣nary consumption is a disease of the whole system, from its being relieved, or cured, only by reme∣dies which act upon the whole system. This will appear, I hope, hereafter, when we come to treat of the cure of this disorder.</Q></P>
<P N="31">XXXI.
<Q>Let us now inquire how far the prin∣ciples I have laid down will apply to the supposed proximate causes of consumption. These causes have been said to be; an abscess in the lungs, haemoptysis, tubercles, catarrh, hereditary dathe∣sis, contagion, and the matter of cutaneous erup∣tions or sores repelled, and thrown upon the lungs. I shall make a few observations upon each of them.</Q></P>
<P N="32"><PB N="10" REF="030645_0015_0FE7EF0D241D1630"/>XXXII.
<Q>1. An abscess in the lungs is generally the consequence of a neglected, or half cured pneumony. It is seldom fatal, where it is not con∣nected with a predisposition to consumption from general debility, or where general debility is not previously induced by the want of appetite, sleep and exercise, which sometimes accompanies that disorder of the lungs. This explination of the production of consumption by an abscess in the lungs, will receive further support from attending to the effects of wounds in the lungs. How sel∣dom are they followed by pulmonary consump∣tion; and this only because they are as seldom accompanied by predisposing general debility. I do not recollect a single instance of this disorder having followed a wound in the lungs, either by the bayonet, or a bullet, during the late war. The recoveries which have succeeded such wounds, and frequently under the most unfavorable circum∣stances, shew how very improbable it is that a much slighter affection of the lungs should be∣come the cause of a pulmonary consumption.</Q></P>
<P N="33">XXXIII.
<Q>A British officer, whom I met in the British camp, a few days after the battle of Bran∣dywine in September, 1777, informed me that the surgeon general of the royal army had assured him, that out of twenty-four soldiers who had been admitted into the hospitals, during the cam∣paign of 1776, with wounds in their lungs, twenty-three of them had recovered. Even pri∣mary diseases of the lungs often exist with peculiar violence, or continue for many years without in∣ducing a consumption. I have never known but one instance of the hooping cough ending in consumption, and all our books of medicine con∣tain records of the asthma continuing for 20 and
<PB N="11" REF="030645_0016_0FE7EF12C3DB3690"/>30 years without terminating in that disorder. The reason in both cases, must be ascribed to those two original disorders of the lungs not being ac∣companied by general debility. One fact more will serve to throw still further light upon the subject. Millers are much afflicted with a cough from floating particles of flour constantly irritating their lungs and yet they are not more subject to consumption than other laboring people. Hence `a miller's cough,' is proverbial in some places, to denote a cough of long continuance without danger.</Q></P>
<P N="34">XXXIV.
<Q>2. The haemoptysis is either a local disease, or it is the effect of general debility of the whole system. When it is local, or when it is the effect of causes which induce a <HI>temporary</HI> or <HI>acute</HI> debility only in the system, it is seldom followed by consumption. The accidental dis∣charge of blood from the lungs, from injuries, and from an obstruction of the menses in women, is of this kind. Many persons are affected by this species of haemorrhage once or twice in their lives, without suffering any inconvenience from it afterwards. I have met with several cases in which it has occurred for many years every time the body was exposed to any of the causes which induce <HI>sudden,</HI> direct, or indirect debility, and yet no consumption has followed it. The late king of Prussia informed Dr. Zimmerman that he had been frequently attacked by it during his seven years war, and yet he lived notwithstandng above twenty years afterwards without any pulmo∣nary complaints. It is only in persons who labor under <HI>chronic</HI> debility, that an haemoptysis is ne∣cessarily followed by consumption.</Q></P>
<P N="35"><PB N="12" REF="030645_0017_0FE7EF152D186F00"/>XXXV.
<Q>3. I yield to the popular mode of expression when I speak of a consumption being produced by tubercles. But I maintain that they are the <HI>effects</HI> of general debility communicated to the bronchial vessels which cause them to effuse a preternatural quantity of mucus. This mucus is sometimes poured into the trachea from whence it is discharged by hawking, more especially in the morning; for it is effused more copiously during the languid hours of sleep than in the day time. But this mucus is frequently effused into the substance of the lungs, where it produces those tumours we call tubercles. When this occurs, there is either no cough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Med. Com. vol. 2.</NOTE> or a very dry one. That tubercles are formed in this way, I infer from the dissections and experiments of Dr. Stark<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clinical and Anatomical Observations, p. 26, 27. See also Morgagni, letter xxii. 21.</NOTE> who tells us that he found them to consist of inorganic matter that he was unable to discover any connection between them and the pulmonary vessels, by means of the microscope or injections, and that they first opened into the trachea through the bron∣chial vessels. It is remarkable that the color and consistence of the matter of which they are com∣posed, is nearly the same as the matter which is discharged from the trachea, in the moist cough which occurs from a relaxation of the bronchial vessels.</Q></P>
<P N="36">XXXVI.
<Q>I am aware that these tumours in the lungs have been ascribed to scropula. But the frequent occurrence of consumptions in persons in whom no scrophulous taint existed, is sufficient to refuse this opinion. I have frequently directed
<PB N="13" REF="030645_0018_0FE7EF1C85E32FD8"/>my enquiries after this disorder in consumptive patients, and have met with very few cases which were produced by it. It is probable that it may frequently be a predisposing cause of consumption in Great Britain, but I am sure it is not in the United States of America.</Q></P>
<P N="37">XXXVII.
<Q>4. The catarrh is of two kind; acute and chronic, both of which are connected with general debility, but this debility is most obvious in the chronic catarrh: hence we find it encreased by every thing which acts upon the whole system, such as cold and damp weather, fatigue, and above all by old age, and relieved or cured by exercise, and every thing else which invigorates the whole system. This species of catarrh often continues for twenty or thirty years without indu∣cing pulmonary consumption, in persons who pursue active occupations.</Q></P>
<P N="39">XXXIX
<Q>5. In the hereditary consumption there is either an hereditary debility of the whole system, or an hereditary mal-conformation of the breast. In the latter case, the consumption is the effect of weakness communicated to the whole system, by the long continuance of difficult respiration, or of such injuries being done to the lungs as are incompatible with health and life. It is remarkable, that the consumptive diathesis is more frequently derived from paternal than ma∣ternal ancestors.<NOTE PLACE="foot">[The reader will notice that the observations under figure 6 are here omitted—the subject of them was wholly on contagion, the particular quality or power of which can be known only by analogy of effects, and of course no possitive inference could be drawn from it— the author has therefore passed them over as being of no use in his primary design which is to establish his theory upon known facts.]</NOTE></Q></P>

<Q>7. I grant that cutaneous humors, and the matter of old sores, when repelled, or suddenly healed, have in some cases fallen upon the lungs and produced consumption. But I believe, in every case where this has happened, the consump∣tion was preceded by general debility, or that it was not induced, until the whole system had been previously debilitated by a tedious and distressing cough.</Q></P>
<P N="41">XLI. Since my first question is so fully answered by Dr. Rush, in the preceding paragraphs, I shall pass to the next in order; viz. What is the nature of the disease or state of body producing the phe∣nomena peculiar to it, &amp;c?</P>
<P N="42">XLII. Our surest guide to this discovery is, to take a view of the predisposing causes and their effects on the human frame. As they all clearly appear from Dr. Rush's observations, to be powers inducing debility in the system either by their direct or indirect operation, the inference is plain and easy; viz. That the derangements we experience in the consumption, by which our bodies are wasted and finally destroyed is the result of defect of power or want of energy in the several functions of the system. The answer to the remaining part of the question is so fully involved in what has been said, that no further notice need be taken of it: for <HI>debil∣ity</HI> is nothing more, nor less, nor aside of <HI>debility</HI> from whatever source it is produced; whither by powers abstracting from, or adding too much stimulus to the system.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While this is the case no diversity of species can be rationally conceived of.</NOTE></P>
<P>The last query, viz. How many species and their different causes and natures, also naturally looses
<PB N="15" REF="030645_0020_0FE8448A44771CB8"/>its existence. So that it would now seem that no∣thing remained but to devise a proper method to restore the energy of the several functions, by coun∣teracting the predisposing causes, or in other words, a proper method of cure.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. But alas! such is the power of tradition, such the veneration for the opinions of men of medi∣cal fame, that a tonic or sthenic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Active—opposed to weak and indolent.</NOTE> inflammatory con∣sumption, is still warmly contended for. Even the great Dr. Rush, (whose ideas in other respects are worthy the exalted character he sustains) is upon the list of its supporters. As this opinion has still so many advocates, some of whom are men of influ∣ence, humanity impels me to attempt its refutation. I shall therefore proceed to examine the several phenomena, &amp;c. on which they found their argu∣ments; and by a careful and candid investigation endeavour to shew, that by the laws of animal nature there is no foundation in any of them for such a conclusion.</P>
<P>I shall first take notice of an argument made use of to support the doctrine of inflammatory or tonic consumption; viz. That debility even tho' it be chronic and habitual predisposes to inflammatory diathesis. See Dr. Rush's medical inquiries, vol. 2, page 116, where speaking of blood letting in the consumption, he says,
<Q>It may seem strange to re∣commend this debilitating remedy in a disease brought on by debility. Were it proper in this place I could prove that there is no disease in which bleeding is prescribed, which is not induced by predisposing debility in common with pulmona∣ry consumption. I shall only remark here, that in consequence of the exciting cause acting on the
<PB N="16" REF="030645_0021_0FE8448ED105ECE8" MS="y"/>system (rendered extremely excitable by debility) such a morbid and excessive excitement is produ∣ced in the arteries, as to render a diminution of the stimulus of the blood absolutely necessary to reduce it.</Q>
This is followed by two cases to con∣firm the doctrine, in one of which he bled fifteen times in six weeks, and the other eight times in two weeks: in the last it is added with happy effects. But he does not give us any particular statement of these cases;; so that we may at least conjecture that the Doctor might be mistaken in giving those cases the appellation of consumption or phthisis pul∣monalis. After reading this paragraph, I turned back to paragraph VII, to see what this `exciting cause' should be? But on an attentive perusal I could find nothing in that nor in the predisposing or remote causes. See par. VI, (which the Dr. says may operate as exciting) which could not produce such an excessive excitement in the arterial system; nor in fact <HI>any</HI> (which operate by a direct agency) except the alternation of heat and cold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">It must be always confessed that when the excitability is accumulated by cold, the stimulus of heat acts with en∣creased force on our system.</NOTE>. And in∣deed many of them there enumerated; viz.
<Q>Grief and other debilitating passions of the mind, hypo∣chondriasis, improper lactation, excessive evacua∣tion of all kinds, especially by stool, cold damp air, &amp;c.</Q>
would lead the mind to a very different conclusion. But waving this seeming impropriety by supposing we may mistake the Doctor's meaning (which is very possible) and admit that he does not mean to confine our attention to the paragraphs alluded to, but to <HI>any</HI> strong stimulus or exciting power: yet even in this view another difficulty will arise of equal magnitude, since we may not hesitate to declare that every exciting cause or power invari∣ably
<PB N="17" REF="030645_0022_0FE8449054CD1A90"/>counteracts debility, and of course is justly adapted (when properly bounded) to prevent the progress of that chronic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the debility is of this kind, which brings on or produces the derangements peculiar to the consumption and is that kind our author means to refer us to in the passage quoted from the 116th page of his 2d vol. Med. Inquiries—Is evident, not only from the general tenor of what we have quoted in the former part of this work, but clearly so from what is recorded and implied in page 108 of said vol. where speaking of what ought to be done in the predisposition or first stage,
<Q>says the reme∣dies in this stage of the disorder are simple and certain, they consist in a desertion of all the remote and exciting causes of the disorder, particularly sedentary employ∣ments, damp or cold situations and whatever tends to weaken the system,—when the disease has not yielded to this desertion of its remote and exciting causes, I have recommended the cold bath steel and bark with great advantage—however improper or even dangerous these remedies may be after the disease assumes an inflamma∣tory or hectic type.</Q></P></NOTE> debility by which the dis∣ease is ushured on, and after commenced to retard its progress. And indeed our authors remark in the 115th page, affords not a little support to this propo∣sition: where after saying that
<Q>There are cases in which patients in a consumption are suddenly snatched away by an attack of pneumony,</Q>
he says,
<Q>I met with one case only in which, contrary to my <HI>expectation,</HI> the patient <HI>mended</HI> after an attack of acute inflammation of the lungs, so as to live two years.</Q>
Another fact must equally serve to con∣firm my proposition, mentioned by Dr. Rush, and also by Dr. Cullin. The latter says, vol. 2, page 415.
<Q>The pregnancy of women has often retarded the progress or a phthisis; but commonly it is only until after delivery when the symptoms of phthisis return with violence and soon prove fatal.</Q>
By
<PB N="18" REF="030645_0023_0FE844962D9B75F8"/>comparing these states together; viz. Before and af∣ter delivery, the result must be, that the more sthenic powers there are excited in the system, the more those derangements in consequence of debility, are obviated. For we observe in pregnancy, that the subject, after recovering from those complaints pe∣culiar to the first months, to grow fleshy, and in many instances so sthenic as to require repeated blood let∣ting: but directly after delivery their cases in gen∣eral are reversed; first by lochial evacuation, and af∣terward by lactation.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. `Again, our author (Dr. Rush) page 112, when speaking of the analogy between the pneumonia and consumption, says,
<Q>The cough in the consumption in like manner is first dry, atten∣ded by a discharge of blood from the lungs which is more copious than in a pneumany <HI>only because</HI> the lungs are more relaxed in the former, than in the latter disorder.</Q>
This <HI>relaxed state of the lungs,</HI> (which according to the Doctor's general proposi∣tion, see paragraphs V &amp; XI, is in common with the rest of the system, (tho' the diathesis in the lungs is somewhat the greatest and fully accords with his theory of predisposition,) is an indisposition, which to remove, reason suggests, that the agency of those very powers (properly regulated) which natural∣ly generate pneumoniac inflammation is absolutely necessary; and this is notably confirmed by the two facts last related in par. XLIII, especially the first, to which may be added the great benefit patients of this description derive from the use of stimulant and tonic remedies. This suggestion is further suppor∣ted by the utility experienced in that relaxation in the genitals, occasioned by long continued gonorr∣heas, by adding cantharides to the medicines usually employed; which, when given in any considerable
<PB N="19" REF="030645_0024_0FE84497B2AB5810"/>quantities do in fact excite inflammation in those particular parts.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. Besides, we have great reason to doubt, whether an inflammation of any considerable duration, can exist in such a state of chronic debility; on account of the weak unstable state of the system in all such cases: much less to conceive of one of <HI>six,</HI> or even of <HI>two</HI> weeks standing. And this doubt is increased by the Dr. himself in what he says in the volume alluded to, see page 185, where spea∣king of dropsies he says,
<Q>It is probable that the same difference should be observed, between the treatment of dropsies, in warm and cold climates, that is observed in the treatment of inflammatory fevers.</Q>
He then observes,
<Q>The tonic action probably exists in the system in both climates; in the former it resembles the tides which are sud∣denly produced by a shower of rain, and as sud∣denly disappear; whereas in the latter, it may be compared to those tides which are produced by the slow and gradual addition of water from nu∣merous streams, which continue for days and weeks together to exhibit marks of violence, in every part of their course.</Q>
Here a query natu∣rally suggests itself, whether there is, or can be any difference between a habit debilited by the powers enumerated in the former part of this work, or one induced by living in or near the torrid Zone? Whether they will not alike subject the system to those sudden changes on the application or abstrac∣tion of stimuli which form such a disparity between the latter, and the more permanent habits of the nothern latitudes?</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. But what could be the complaint for which the Dr. continued to bleed for six weeks, un∣til
<PB N="20" REF="030645_0025_0FE8449EDABDC788"/>he had bled fifteen times? And of the one for which he bled eight times in two weeks? The latter he speaks of as being `attended with the happiest effects.' To this I answer. It is highly probable, it was a sthenic catarrh, and not different from a peripneumony only in degree and duration: <HI>both</HI> the consequence of sthenic powers on a sthenic habit. I will not contend with the Doctor for saying they are always `induced by some predisposing debili∣ty,' if he means by it, nothing more than what he calls <HI>acute</HI> in paragraph XXXIV, or the sudden ab∣straction of stimuli in a permanent or sthenic habit, by cold or cold damp, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We often hear patients of this description date the origin of their complaints to some such exposure.</NOTE> as any sthenic or stim∣ulating power, succeeding such an abstraction, acts with much more energy than if it had not taken place: the abstraction allowing the excitability to accumulate. And altho' patients ascribe the origin of their complaints to such exposure to cold, &amp;c. yet in the narration they give us, they do not inform us of any symptoms of any consequent disease, un∣til after they are in a more comfortable situation, or in other words, until <HI>after</HI> the application of stimuli; some being taken by the fire side, others in a warm room, others in a warm bed; and most generally after taking some refreshment as they call it. And when the stimulus or sthenic power is sudden and considerable, on such permanent or sthenic habit it is easy to foresee that an inflammatory pyrexoe, peripneumony, &amp;c. will be the consequence. But if such stimulus or sthenic power be applied more moderately, by its less violent operation on such permanent habit it may continue a considerable time (say six weeks) producing <HI>catarrh's,</HI> &amp;c. with∣out inducing indirect debility; and repeated bleed∣ing,
<PB N="21" REF="030645_0026_0FE844A1935328A8"/>in such case be of great utility. On the other hand, reason, experience and the remarks of the Doctor himself in the passage last quoted all conspire, to determine what would be the situation of the as∣thenic<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Defect of, or want of energy.</NOTE> infirm, or chronic debilitated subject, under such alternate exposures.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. Having finished the disagreeable task of animadverting on the arguments of so learned and respectable a writer as Dr. Rush, I shall now proceed to examine some of the principal phenom∣ena, on which the contenders for a tonic inflammatory consumption found their arguments. These are,</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. 1st. That copious bleedings, in cases of hoemoptoe's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An effusion of blood from the lungs.</NOTE> are less frequently followed by pul∣moniac complaints than the less profuse.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The occurrence of a hard pulse in the disease.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The expectoration of purulent matter in the disorder, somewhat similar to that which is raised in the breaking of an ulcer or abscess in the lungs.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The supposed benefit of blood letting, and frequent relief produced by it.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. In reply to the first; viz. `That copious bleedings, &amp;c. I shall advert in the first place to the history of those profuse bleedings at the lungs which take place previous to any pulmo∣niac complaints. Here we shall find they gene∣rally, if not always happen in consequence of some accident which has befallen the patient otherwise in health. Dr. Boarhaave, if I rightly remember, lays
<PB N="22" REF="030645_0027_0FE844A7B4A1D0E0"/>much, if not his whole stress on the case of a man who bled profusely on being violently thrown out of a carriage; who, being much neglected as to any kind of stimulants, recovered without any pulmoniac complaints. On the other hand those smaller blee∣dings we find which are followed by pulmoniac complaints, <HI>generally</HI> if not <HI>always</HI> attend people la∣boring under chronic debility.</P>
<P N="50">L. By attending to these remarks, and com∣paring them with Dr. Rush's observations, see para∣graph XXXIV, we shall be led to conclude that in the cases of the first description, it was the previous vigor and health of the subject which preserved the patient from future evil consequences, and that the <HI>wound</HI> made of so much consequence in either case could not be worthy our attention; this is fully evinced, not only from what is there said, but by adverting to the frequent bleedings at the nose and fauces which take place without being followed with the slightest traces of inflammation.</P>
<P N="51">LI. Hence the attentive enquirer would be ready to wonder if haemorrhages under such circumstances are so safe, from whence came the idle whim of following them with repeated bleedings, which would land the patient in a chronic debility, a state wherein (to use the Doctors own words,)
<Q>haemoptysis is ne∣cessarily followed by a consumption,</Q>
he would like∣wise be equally surprised to hear such phaenomina made use of as an argument to support the idea of an inflammatory or sthenic consumption. Nay he would be naturally led to consider the latter bleedings (the small or less profuse) as symptoms of the weak patulus, and irritable state of the vessels, rather than a disease or its origin; and be confirmed in the opinion when he reflected on the material
<PB N="23" REF="030645_0028_0FE844A93957AC18"/>benefits experienced from the use of the bark and other tonic remedies to remove it.</P>
<P N="52">LII. I shall close my dissertation on this head by noticing a clause in Dr. Barry's treatise on the con∣sumption, published in the year 1727, page 226, where he gives it as his decided opinion, that the slow small bleedings proceed from the bronchial arteries. Admitting this to be the case, which from the peculiar weakness experienced at the breast immediately after such bleedings we are disposed to believe, we shall readily conjecture why such patients should be liable to pulmoniac complaints, on account of the debilitating effects, the loss of blood from this artery must have on the lungs: as it is pretty evident that from these arteries the lungs derive their entire support, the pulmonary arteries being destined for another purpose.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. The next subject under consideration is the occurrence of a hard pulse in consumptive diseases.</P>
<P>It must always appear a paradox in nature to suppose a tonic, or sthenic state of the arteries, while the rest of the system is wasteing away thro' debility or want of energy: but that a hard pulse which has been generally considered as a pathog∣nomonic sign of sthenic or tonic energy, does some∣times occur in the consumption we must believe, unless we dispute the veracity of Dr. Rush, even when the principles of life and animation have nearly ceased. He says in page 111,
<Q>I have seen two cases in which a hard pulse, and other symptoms of inflammatory action appeared in the last hours of life.</Q>
We may easily surmount this difficulty, by attending to the effects of irritating
<PB N="24" REF="030645_0029_0FE844B15FAC0070"/>powers on debilitated habits, which exhibit that false appearance of strength and vigor through the system so conspicuously observable on the accession of spasms, or sudden derangements of the mental functions. I think I may venture to assert, that I have myself experienced several instances where the phenomena appeared in the arterial system, in debilitated subjects labouring under spasms or other strong irritations, even to such a degree as to beget a doubt, whether I had not mistaken the cause: but on the application of <HI>stimulants,</HI> the perterbation subsided and the pulse softened. In this way only I can account for an expression in the new Edin∣burgh Dispensatory, where speaking of the effects of opium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Opium is now generally allowed to rank among the highest stimulants.</NOTE>, it is said
<Q>the action of the arterial system is diminished, the pulse for the most part <HI>softer,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
Coincident with the above, I would beg leave to insert an extract from a paper publish∣ed in the New-London Medical Journal for 1792, page 33, communicated by Mr. Stringer, Surgeon, Riegate in Surry; which is as follows.</P>
<P>`RIEGATE, <HI>November</HI> 31st, 1791.</P>
<P N="54">LIV.
<Q>The term inflammation appears to me to admit of a greater extent and division than is generally allowed. In particular that sufficient stress is not laid between the inflammatory diathe∣sis of the system, and local inflammation arising from irritability occasioning spasms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That inflammation is found to exist in relaxed debilitated habits, excited and kept up by irrita∣tion of some peculiar acrimony, totally contrary and independent of any inflammatory diathesis,
<PB N="25" REF="030645_0030_0FE844B45EF9F650"/>as in scrophula, veneria, &amp;c. will not be denied: and that pleuritic and peripneumoniac symptoms frequently arise in debilitated habits from irrita∣tions and spasms independent of any general inflammation, seems to me evident, from particu∣lar observations and the success of a contrary mode of treatment to that generally adopted in the cure of those diseases.</Q></P>
<P N="55">LV.
<Q>In a general inflammatory affection, the pathognomoniac symptoms do not always imme∣diately occur, for in some instances the action of the arterial system is retarded; giving a week, soft, and sometimes a trembling and intermitting pulse. In this case, upon opening the vein, the circula∣tion is raised, the pulse becomes full and hard, the blood sizy, and all symptoms of true and active inflammation appear. This is frequently the case on the first attack of an inflammatory fever, arising from the violence of the action exci∣ting a compression upon the arterial system, this compression being removed either by natural, or atificial means the symptoms of encreased arterial action become evident.</Q></P>
<P N="56">LVI.
<Q>On the contrary, the action of the heart and arteries, from some tempory exciting cause, is frequently increased under circumstances of general debility in the habit. Pleuritic peripneu∣moniac, and other inflammatory symptoms, often taken place under these circumstances, where profuse evacuations, if they do not occasion imme∣diate mischief, commonly lay a foundation for future evils. I am afraid there is reason to doubt that the phthisis pulmonalis has been frequently brought on by to free a use of the lancet, and other evacuants. If the lungs <HI>escape,</HI> a terrible train of nervous afflictions is the consequence.</Q></P>
<P N="57"><PB N="26" REF="030645_0031_0FE844BBA545DAD8"/>LVII.
<Q>Venesection is too strenuously insisted on and too frequently repeated at a time when opiates with or without other antispasmodics, by allaying the irritation, and spasms (which is often the only remaining cause of inflammatory symp∣toms, even after frequent bleedings have been had recourse to) would more speedily relieve the pre∣sent symptoms, prevent the ill consequences of too great a deprivation of the vital fluid, and give room for further observation on the subsequent treatment of the disease.</Q></P>
<P N="58">LVIII.
<Q>I have had frequent occasions to ob∣serve the good tendency of this practice, and with difference to superior judgement, cannot help wishing to lay peculiar stress on the efficacy of anodynes and antispasmodics, in many cases of thoracic inflammation, a proof that irritation and spasms are frequently the exciting cause particu∣larly in debilitated habits; even in plethoric habits, spasms may be only remaining cause of the symptoms still existing as strong as ever, even af∣ter the most liberal use of the lancet, as seems to be evinced by the following</Q></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE.</HEAD>
<P N="59">LIX.
<Q>I was desired to see a man who had hung himself with a handkerchief, and was a short time after cut down. He appeared to be middle aged, healthy, muscular and strong. His eyes were fixed, his teeth fast shut, and he foamed at the mouth like a person dying, from compression, or concussion of the brain, his pulse hard, strong, and full.</Q></P>
<P N="60">LX.
<Q>I hesitated not, but for expedition sake, cut off his coat and pierced a vein in each arm
<PB N="27" REF="030645_0032_0FE844BD2B0A18D0"/>from which his pulse not flagging in the least, about two pounds of blood were drawn, as nearly as could be ascertained from the confusion in the place.</Q></P>
<P N="61">LXI.
<Q>He did not appear to be the least reliev∣ed, on the contrary the spasms became general and it required the strength of several persons to hold him; the blood flowed from the orifices in the arms at every contraction of the muscles with vi∣olence that could only be equalled by the punc∣ture of a large antery and could not be restrained either by pressure, bandage, or compress; I began to think that either some of the vessels in the head had been burst by the compresion of the handker∣chief on the neck, or that considerable injury had been done to the head from the fall in cutting down, tho' there was no external appearance of it.</Q></P>
<P N="62">LXII.
<Q>The man appearing to be still getting worse, and no prospect of benefit arising from further bleeding, I was induced to try whether spasms alone might not be the present cause of derangement in the censorium, for which purpose he was forced to swallow fifty drops of tincture of opium. This speedily had the desired effect of lessening the disturbance in the whole system; he grew quiet and dosed an hour or two, when the convulsions threatening to return, the opiate was repeated with the same good effects as before, till he took near two hundred drops in the space of fourteen hours, which in the end threw him into a sound sleep, and he awoke perfectly in his senses, tho a slight mania attacked him a few days afterwards, which left him by the use of proper evacuations.</Q></P>
<P N="63"><PB N="28" REF="030645_0033_0FE844C2EB0C5320"/>LXIII. The expectoration of purulent matter in the disorder, comes next to be discussed.</P>
<P>This appears to be an argument made use of in favor of a sthenic, inflammatory consumption, from a supposition that it arises from the same origin as a vomica, and is considered as an open ulcer of the lungs: hence the idea of inflammatory and supura∣tive stages of the consumption; conceiving mean time of no other inflammation but a sthenic or tonic one, and frequent bleedings have been urged to prevent the second or supurative stage.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. That this is not the case must appear evident, not only by considering that all the predis∣posing causes are such as indicate atonia in the system; but by reflecting that this is frequently, if not always preceded by an expectoration of vicid mucus from the glands, or vessels of the lungs, and sometimes in considerable quantities, plainly indica∣ting, that those vessels, instead of being in a state of tonic inflammation, are become weak and patulus.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. The last argument I shall notice, which is used to support the idea of an inflammatory tonic consumption, is `the supposed benefit of blood letting, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Supposed I call it, for I cannot conceive any foundation for it in nature: for in cases of pluirisy, peripneumony, &amp;c. where reason and long experi∣ence evince the great utility of blood letting; we find that purging, sweating, and indeed every evac∣uation which serves in a measure to empty the vessels, operate in common with bleeding, to render the pulse slower, abate the thirst, cool the body, and not only case the distress, but make the patient feel
<PB N="29" REF="030645_0034_0FE844C46EF4CC38"/>more vigorous, and approach nearer health. Is this the case in the consumption? Does not sweat∣ing, purging and every other natural evacuation, ultimately quicken the pulse, increase the thirst and fever? And although they may for the present abate some distressing symptom, yet the debility (which appears in fact to be the disease) is felt by the patient to increase; and instead of returning health, the marks of dissolution are more strikingly painted. That this is the case I believe every experienced practitioner will admit. The question then must be, if every other evacuation, which empties the vessels and debilitates the system, so useful in truly tonic and sthenic cases, is so injurious in the consumption, why not bleeding also? This idea is further corro∣borated by reverting to the effects of pregnancy, (see paragraph XLIII) where we see that even a natural suppression or cessation of the customary evacuation of the blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be said that the blood taken up to nourish the foetus fully compensates for the retention of the blood, &amp;c. but if so, why the so frequent necessity of bleeding in those cases?</NOTE> has retarded the progress of the disease. I will readily admit that bleeding frequently affords relief from the spasms, &amp;c. about the breast; and so will a diarrhoea or pain in the bowels, (see paragraph XXII.) I have myself been lately a witness of the fatal effects of even a moderate attack of a dyssentery in the disorder; which did indeed greatly relieve the breast of my patient, but increas∣ed the disease even to a speedy dissolution. That spasms and the pain and uneasiness resulting from them may give way to any thing that effects any considerable revolution or diversion in the system, is too evident to need other testimony than experi∣ence. But as a fact, with some observations, con∣sonant to the foregoing, now lies before me, I shall take the liberty to insert it. The author speaks as
<PB N="30" REF="030645_0035_0FE844CBCB540258"/>follows.
<Q>A certain gentleman in his desk, speak∣ing of the method of curing apilepsy or the falling sickness, and recommending among other evacu∣ent and otherwise debilitating means, small but frequently repeated bleedings, unguardedly con∣tradicts himself in his very next sentence.
<Q>How∣ever,</Q>
says he,
<Q>we regular practitioners are liable to be too cautious and even timid sometimes. For I have known a bold practitioner in the country, who cured an epilepsy by very profuse bleeding. A few months after the patient died of a universal dropsy, but the epilepsy never returned.</Q>
I would ask this gentleman, what sort of a cure that was, which, converted a disease, which may come and go for many years, nay even for a long life time into one that in a very short time proved fatal? What reason would a podagric have to thank any one, who should convert the gout in him upon any violent attack, into a fatal dropsy? That sort of treatment is not curing a disease but encreasing it, and even that to death. The convulsive symptoms of an asthenia may pass away; but the asthenia remains, you may cease to call it epilepsy; but dropsy still shows that the cause of this disease remains, nay is prodigiously encreased.</Q></P>
<P N="66">LXVI. In making these remarks on bleeding in the consumption, I would not wish to have them applied to every case of predisposition, since it is evident it is sometimes ushered on by indirect debili∣tating powers. In this case, in the early stage of the predisposition bleeding may be of service by lessening in a degree the morbid excessive excite∣ment. But this ought to be before that degree of debility is induced which constitutes the disease; and is never to be performed after that degree of
<PB N="31" REF="030645_0036_0FE844CD4F0CE7C0"/>weakness is induced wherein the excitability does not readily accumulate upon such abstraction, and the patient, instead of being thereby weakened, shall feel more vigorous.</P>
<P N="67">LXVII. From the foregoing observations, I think it must appear, that the theoretical reasonings made use of to reconcile the idea, that chronic de∣bility is or may be the predisposing proximate or exciting cause of a tonic inflammatory diathesis; and the inferences drawn from the various phenom∣ena therein mentioned, are all the product of a misguided imagination and have no real foundation in nature. And we are after all left to conclude that those powers which induce debility, produce those derangements, consequent, or resulting from debility. Hence a rational mode of cure immedi∣ately strikes the mind; viz. The application of stimu∣lant and tonic remedies (properly regulated) in order to counteract the predisposing causes, and restore the lost vigor and energy to the system. The justness of this idea is abundantly proved by facts recorded in medical history, within these few years past, especially since the ingenious Dr. May has presumed to doubt the rationality of the former theory of the disease, step aside from the old track of prescriptions and adopt the above method of cure, (see his papers published in the London Medical Journal, vol. IX, page 286) the success of his practice has emboldened him and others to persevere in the same system, and, with the happiest effects. See a paper from Dr. Percival of Man∣chester (England) published in Memoirs of London Medical Society, vol. II. A second paper from Dr. May, published in London Medical Journal, vol. XI, page 255. One also from Edmond Pitts Gapper, Surgeon at Mere in Wiltshire, published
<PB N="32" REF="030645_0037_0FE844D4A38CE420"/>in said Journal, vol. XI, page 388; and likewise one from A. Lawrence, published in the New London Medical Journal, vol. II, page 288, all fraught with facts illustrating the utility of such a mode of prac∣tice, to which many more might be added which have occurred in this country. But as I have neither leisure to collect, nor room to insert them in the narrow limits I have prescribed to myself, I must necessarily pass them over and proceed from this general indication, to a more particular method of cure.</P>
<P N="68">LXVIII. As has been before observed, this disease, or more properly state of the system may be induced by two very opposite powers; viz. <HI>Direct</HI> and <HI>indirect</HI> debilitating; and altho' they both ter∣minate in the reduction of the system to such degree of imbecility as to produce all the phenomena which constitute or characterise a consumption; some dif∣ference of application may however be necessary, in order to obviate the agency of those powers and re∣store the system. I shall therefore divide this part of my subject into two distinct heads, beginning first with the mode necessary to be observed when the disease is produced by powers directly debilita∣ting.</P>
<P N="69">LXIX. Before I proceed I would beg leave for the illustration of what is now before us, to point the reader to an evident law of nature which may be daily observed, in which both species of debility are strikingly laid open to our view; and which may not only serve as a clue to the more just application of remedies, but likewise throw some further light on the preceding part of this work.</P>
<P N="70">LXX. The law of nature I would here allude to
<PB N="33" REF="030645_0038_0FE844D6285EAFB0" MS="y"/>is that debility necessarily connected with childhood and old age: the first termed direct, the last indirect. The first for want of continued and gradually in∣creased application of stimuli, by which the redun∣dant excitability is gradually reduced; the latter by too long application, by which the natural excita∣bility becomes worn out, or exhausted; both feeble and <HI>irritable</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the course of my reading in medical books, I have more than once seen morbid irritability referred to as the proximate cause of the derangements in the sick—a good way of getting a long where we wish to be esteemed philosophers when we have no better reason to assign— but the attentive observer not satisfied with superficial speculation would be apt to ask whence this morbid irri∣tability—If we would spend a little more time in the study of physiology and a good deal more by the bed sides of our patients it is probable we should not so frequently be compelled to make such miserable evasive shifts.</NOTE> in proportion as they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from that stage in which exciting powers have their due effect on the excitability.</P>
<P N="71">LXXI. Although the analogy of childhood weakness will not strictly apply to chronic debility induced by withholding the ordinary stimulus in persons who have once acquired a degree of firmness, as in the former, no derangement of the functions takes place: yet the simularity is notably conspicu∣ous in the following respects, viz. That they are alike liable to indirect debility from a too great applica∣tion of stimuli, and so vice verse. And tho' they each may have their excitability daily kept reduced to a healthy standard by stimuli, it is also evident that by this very means the excitability is constantly acquiring additional vigor or permanency, requiring stronger and stronger stimuli to reduce it, until a certain degree of firmness is established which con∣stitutes
<PB N="34" REF="030645_0039_0FE844DD4A901618"/>manhood in the one, and restored strength and permanency in the other.</P>
<P N="72">LXXII. The principal agents which effect the foregoing purposes, by keeping the redundant ex∣citability reduced to a healthy standard, are

<HEAD>EXERCISE.</HEAD>
<P N="73">LXXIII. The utility of exercise is made notably evident from facts recorded in medical history, not only in persons who have voluntarily engaged in it, but in many who have been compelled of necessity vigorously to use it for a length of time, both in consumptive complaints, and other derangements from debility. And not only facts, but the laws of animal nature instruct us that exercise not only gives excitement to the whole frame, and encreases the appetite; but likewise promotes assimilation and digestion in every part of the system destined to perform those functions; it increases the action and power of the vessels in the remote parts of the body, whereby more exerementitious matter is thrown off through the external and remote vessels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The utility of this effect receives confirmation from paragraph XL.</NOTE>, and of course the vessels of the lungs are less bur∣thened.</P>
<P N="74"><PB N="35" REF="030645_0040_0FE844E02E1414E0"/>LXXIV. But this like all other stimulating agents, ought to be as exactly adapted to the state of debility in the patient as possible. It ought to be vigorous enough on the one hand to produce a sufficient degree of excitement thro' the system; to reduce the excitability to a healthy point or standard; to be encreased as strength and permanency encrea∣ses; for reasons mentioned in paragraph LXXI. And on the other hand, it ought always to be so carefully bounded that the patient may endure it most of his waking hours without endangering indi∣rect debility. The mode of it ought to be so con∣trived as to produce less excitement on the lungs, than in any other given part of the system; for as in this disease the diathesis is greater in them, than in the rest of the body, it is evident they may more easily be overcome, or thrown into a state of indi∣rect debility, (hence the impropriety of walking, especially up hill or up stairs, and speaking long sentences with a raised tone of voice,) before suffi∣cient excitement is given to the rest of the system. Besides, the cough (tho' induced by direct debilita∣ting powers) is every day more <HI>exercise</HI> than is any way necessary for the lungs and naturally tends to increase the diathesis, by adding indirect to direct debility.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="prescription">
<HEAD>REGIMEN.</HEAD>
<P N="75">LXXV. Various articles of diet have been re∣commended as salutary in consumptive cases, such as milk from various animals, (which has been extolled almost as a specific) ripe fruits, such as grapes, oranges,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Before we hastily determine on the specific quality of any article of diet in any particular complaint, we ought not only to consider the state of the excitability, (of which hereafter in the text) but the place of resi∣dence, sex, age, season of the year when made use of, habit, and inclination or taste of the subject on whom the salutary effects are experienced.</P>
<P>Dr. More, in a letter to a friend, published in his travels relates two cases, who mended much on the use of ripe grapes. The one on whom the fairest trial was made, being confined to them and bread only for diet, (the other made use of meat occasionally) was a young woman who resided in Switserland. From her age, sex, and place of abode, (if I mistake not, but little flesh is eaton in that country, in comparison to America) we may safely conjecture she had not been accustomed or habituated to a strong stimulating diet—the time of her using this diet was mid summer—add to this she had a pe∣culiar fondness for this kind of fruit—all which taken col∣lectively, would strike the mind very differently, when applyed to an American male in the winter season: with a total disrelish for such food, we should at once conclude he must famish for want of support, and not only so, have his calamity increased by the chilling accesency of the fruit—whereas in the former we may conceive of sufficient support not only from what we may conclude was her habit of dieting, from the custom of the country, but from her age, sex, and peculiar inclination or taste, (which last would induce her to eat freely and add the agreeable stimulus of distension, to the other salutary effects) and not only so, the moderate accesency, at that season of the year would serve to counteract the over stimulus of heat, and preserve a due equilibrium of ex∣citement in, and thro' the system. This last remark, will serve as a general rule, to show us when, and why oran∣ges are of utility.</P></NOTE> &amp;c. have been followed with salu∣tary
<PB N="36" REF="030645_0041_0FE844E5EEE1E078"/>effects. Others again have been much bene∣fited by beef steaks, and the strongest and highest stimulating diet.</P>
<P N="76">LXXVI. By taking a retrospective view of the preceding paragraphs, and turning our attention to the laws by which animal nature is governed, it will require no great discernment to discover when and how each of these seeming contradictory modes of dieting, may be salutary in cases of debility. Milk, and rich subacid sacharine fruits when equal to produce that reduction of the redundant excita∣bility, to an easy comfortable point; and where any thing stronger would endanger indirect debility, are no doubt the most proper diet: but, not be∣cause they act as antiphlogisties (as was the antient term) and oppose that propensity in the system to sthenic or tonic inflammation or inflammatory dis∣position. This is evident, <HI>not only</HI> from what has
<PB N="37" REF="030645_0042_0FE844E7723FC118"/>been already adduced to prove that the danger in this disease is from the reverse of such a state, and that every thing which proves salutary must do it by <HI>invigorating,</HI> not <HI>debilitating, but also,</HI> from the great benefit derived from the use of the strongest and most durable stimulating diet, such as beef steaks, &amp;c. in those cases where it can be dispensed with, without producing indirect, debility. And indeed it ought always to be kept in memory, that where our only expectation of removing the derange∣ments in the system, is to restore the energy of the functions; that as in exercise, so in diet and drinks, they ought to be as stimulating and durable as can be, consistant with the accumulated state of the excitability, and increased as the power of improv∣ing them increases. And here I would just observe that exercise, besides other valuable purposes, helps us much in the dispensing with, and improving by such a regimen; and likewise such regimen increases our ability for exercise. This shows the advantage of uniting every stimulant to recover a debilitated
<PB N="38" REF="030645_0043_0FE844ED2B9A3F28"/>habit. Before I close this article I think it my duty to remark the utility of raw eggs, which by expe∣rience I have found to afford much durable nourish∣ment, and to be easily dispensed with even in a very accumulated state of the excitability. They may be broken into a glass of wine, or any other con∣venient vehicle, or beat to pieces with sugar and a little spirit and water added, as best suits.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="prescription">
<HEAD>MENTAL PASSIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="77">LXXVII. As these are various and have a diver∣sity of effects on the human system, I shall here notice those only which excite vigor, and of course counteract debility. These are mirth, joy and re∣sentment. The latter I feel a disapprobation of; while the former innocent ones, which are so much in the power of a circle of intimate friends to excite, and have such powerful effects in all cases of debil∣ity, deservedly claim the strictest attention. In a late conversation with a person on this subject, I was informed of a gentleman, belonging to a family who had nearly all died of a consumption: and he, had several times been brought very low by the same symptoms, but had survived, and now to my knowledge enjoys a tolerable share of health; who to use my informants expression, `had kept it off by laughing.' He was described as possessing a fund of good humor, and would himself rekindle the merriment whenever the company grew dull. But this, as well as all other stimulants, ought to be kept within discretionary bounds, lest by over action, indirect debility should be the result.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="prescription">
<HEAD>PURE AIR.</HEAD>
<P N="78">LXXVIII. Whether the doctrine of the par∣ticular
<PB N="39" REF="030645_0044_0FE844EFE7F52428"/>use or manner in which pure air proves of such importance to our existence, as alledged by professor Blumenbach in his physiology be true or not; yet its vivifying effects, as in faintings, &amp;c. falls within the observation of almost every person: and every practising physician must be sensible of the disagreeable consequence of foul air on patients laboring under any degree of oppression at the breast. These well known effects render it strikingly neces∣sary, that patients of debilitated habits particularly in pulmoniac complaints, should pay the strictest attention to pure air, by avoiding small and close rooms, large assemblies where the air is rendered noxious by numerous respirations, and also large cities. They ought to spend their time in an open country, or off a distance at sea, as the mixed air near the coasts proves deleterious in pulmoniac com∣plaints, which appears by facts recorded by Dr. Rush. It is proved likewise from experience that warm climates have frequently proved salutary in consumptive complaints. The natural stimulus of the heat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would here observe, that where a sufficiently warm air is not attainable, warm flannel worn next the skin, and comfortable cloathing otherwise may in some measure make amend, for the deficiency.</NOTE> not only keeps up the energy of the func∣tions in general, but by its particular operation on the remote vessels, will aid the salutary agency of exercise in disburdening the lungs, by promoting a more general perspiration.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="prescription">
<HEAD>MEDICINE.</HEAD>
<P N="79">LXXIX. The foregoing powers of exercise, regimen, &amp;c. being the most natural agents to re∣store the impaired energy of the system, a seasonable
<PB N="40" REF="030645_0045_0FE844F471AA2450"/>attention to, and a constant perseverance in them, will generally be easiest, safest and most efficacious. And when the desired effect can be obtained, and ease, health and permanency restored by these nat∣ural agents, direct medicine can be of no service, except in casualties. But as in all cases of direct debility, such a reduction of excitabiliry is so neces∣sary to be kept up, as to procure a steady and easy performance of every function, in order to promote its increasing permanency; (see paragraph LXXI) and that state being not always attainable by the powers enumerated, the kind auxiliary of medical stimulants may be necessary; and as tone and firm∣ness is so necessary to be acquired before health can be established, remedies called tonics may have their share of utility. At the head of the former, stand opium and aether, and among the latter, are bark, myrrh, elixirvitriol and iron.</P>
<P N="80">LXXX. The discerning practitioner by attend∣ing to the foregoing, will easily determine the object, the time, application, and quantity of these medi∣caments, or of less powerful substitutes, as different habits and circumstances shall require. But opium, altho' of the greatest utility in this disease, is so liable to abuse in unskilful hands I feel myself constrained to make some observations on the use of it. This noble drug appears to take the lead of every other stimulant, and by its uniform operation over the whole system, serves by the suddenness of its effects to reduce in a very short time the most confused derangements (when such derangements are the effect of debility) to a state of steadiness, tranquility and ease. In the consumption, it mitigates the cough, relieves oppression, abates spasms, and pro∣motes expectoration of any redundancy. But such
<PB N="41" REF="030645_0046_0FE844F731D48BC8"/>is the energy of its stimulus that much damage has been done in cases of chronic debility by over dosing and thereby inducing indirect debility. As our sole object in this case is to effect that degree of reduction of excitability wherein we perform our functions with steadiness, ease and tranquility, and that the smallest quantity beyond, must prove inju∣rious by inducing indirect debility; I would recom∣mend to every attending Physician, when this stim∣ulant is necessary, by careful <HI>attendance</HI> to learn what is the smallest dose requisite, and how often repetition may be necessary.</P>
<P N="81">LXXXI. Having thus far taken a brief view of the principal remedies for the disease when genera∣ted by direct debilitating powers; I shall now bestow a few thoughts on it as induced by the reverse, viz. powers indirectly debilitating.</P>
<P N="82">LXXXII. Chronic indirect debility which hap∣pens at the season of life in which consumptions prevail, differs from that which attends old people in this respect, in the latter, by long and gradual application of a variety, or in other words of every stimulant subservient to life and health, the excita∣bility in every part and every organ is so worn down and decayed, that it looses the power of any dura∣ble excitement, so that no prospect of a restoration can exist: whereas the former is commonly induced by one kind of stimulus alone, and altho' the exci∣tability is over powered, and the system debilitated by the continued application of one powerful stim∣ulant, yet it is commonly if not always the case, that in the mean time, less of every other stimulant is applied than in ordinary healthy cases. Hence we may conceive instead of a wasted, a rather
<PB N="42" REF="030645_0047_0FE844FD2119F408"/>accumulated excitability, so far as it respects every exciting power except the one which by its over action has induced the debility. Consequently by gradually withholding the particular hurtful stimuli, and a proper application of such stimulants as have had no share in causing the debility, we may expect the derangements to be removed, and health and vigor again rekindled.</P>
<P N="83">LXXXIII. The caution given in cases of direct debility not to carry the effects of stimulants beyond a just degree of excitement, that is, such a degree as best suits the natural, easy performance of the func∣tions, ought strictly to be attended to in the present case; and the more diffusable necessary stimulants ought carefully to be lessened, as the more perma∣nent ones (such as nearer accord with a state of health) may with safety be introduced.</P>
<P N="84">LXXXIV. The notion of curing chronic indi∣rect debility, by direct debilitating powers, however proper it may be in its approach, yet when actually induced has no foundation in nature; for as before observed, <HI>debility is debility</HI> let the source of it be what it may, and cannot be removed otherwise than by a proper application of stimulants. To this, facts abundantly testify.</P>
<P N="85">LXXXV. I shall here finish my remarks for the present by relating in a concise manner, only a sin∣gle case recorded in the New London Medical Journal, to evince my last proposition. A strong man, aged about 42 years who had been too fami∣liar with spiritous liquors, was seized with a fit resembling an apoplectic paroxism, upon which a general paralisis speedily supervened, extending in a short time, over the whole system, rapidly debili∣tating every function of the body. After remaining
<PB N="43" REF="030645_0048_0FE844FEA5B482F8"/>in this situation for seven weeks, and the aggravated symptoms having almost precluded every prospect of recovery; he was, contrary to expectation by the application of the highest stimulating and tonic remedies (brisk purges being occasionally adminis∣tred) restored in five or six weeks to perfect health. See Medical Journal, vol. 1st, page 257.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.
<HI>Containing observations on the duty of Physicians, strictures on the use of Medicine, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is an opinion long imbibed by the vulgar, that diseases are eradicated by some specific power in medicine which destroys them, or expels them from the system thro' some evacuating outlet; hence it is that a cure is expected (if the right medicine can be but hit on) in a very short time, even in the most chronical cases. Not so much as dreaming that medicine (evacuents excepted) are possessed of no power or quality different from the common agents or powers by which life is constantly upheld and supported, excepting in degree of efficacy; nor again suspecting that most of the derangements we expe∣rience originate from the too strong or want of due application of those common agents; of course the most important part of the cure, viz. a due regula∣tion of regimen, exercise, passions, &amp;c. &amp;c. is intirely overlooked and treated with what may be justly esteemed a criminal neglect by the patient, especially in diseases which are ushered on by slow and gradual steps; mean while he will immediately grow uneasy with his physician, unless he is constant∣ly craming him with some powerful <HI>drug</HI>: the natural consequence of which, is, in the first place, the patient is foreclosed from all the benefit which might be derived from a due regulation of those very <HI>powers</HI> or <HI>agents</HI> which by their undue appli∣cation produced the derangements or disease; and of improving their energy in restoring the several functions of the body to a vigorous performance of
<PB N="46" REF="030645_0050_0FE845073AF05D18"/>all their offices; the efficacy of which cannot be doubted, but that it must be <HI>great</HI> by any man of observation, when he reflects how soon the functions of our bodies become weakened and deranged by withholding, even in a small degree, the aid of any of those ordinary powers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The effects of exchanging warm, dry and serene air for cold, damp and fowl—the effects of exchanging an easy pleasing train of ideas and good company for melan∣choly apprehensions and irksome companions—the effects of laying aside a generous regimen and using one too low and sparing, and the effects of exchanging a proper degree of exercise for a sedentary life, are too conspicuous to escape the notice of every man of observation.</NOTE> nor can it be much doubt∣ed, but that their efficacy is equal to all that is re∣quisite in most cases of the disease in question, espe∣cially the more chronical kind, for the slowness of the progress of the derangements clearly indicate the hurtful powers not to be great or powerful, destroying only by continuence.</P>
<P>In the second place, by daily gorging the patient with powerful drugs, he must be constantly <HI>exposed,</HI> even if those made use of be of the class of powers indicated, yet by their over acting beyond what is requisite to counteract the hurtful powers, (which must ever be the case where a due attention to the non naturals or common agents is sufficient) the system is suddenly hurried into the opposite extreme, and neither the debility nor derangements are any how got the better of, but the reverse. This being so generally the case, it highly behoves the faculty who are called to prescribe for patients in the disease in question, as they would be tender of the lives and wel∣fare of their patients and their own reputation; in the first place, to endeavor to banish those false notions not
<PB N="47" REF="030645_0051_0FE8450D2FAE0A18"/>only from their patients, but from their attending friends, and by explaining <HI>natures own system</HI> to them more clearly, incourage them in a rigid perse∣verence in the use of such exercise, regimen, change of air, &amp;c. &amp;c. as shall be best adapted to their situation; <HI>rigid</HI> I say: as experience teaches us that in all cases of long continued debility, not only that, but the consequent derangements (which derange∣ments as occur particularly in this disease, as frequent coughing, profuse expectoration, large night sweats, &amp;c. serves to augment the debility) become habitu∣al, and as it were constitutional, and of course must require strict attention in avoiding on the one hand, those hurtful powers by which the debility was indu∣ced; and on the other, a careful attention to the use of all those powers calculated by their constant and gradually increased application to restore the permanency of the <HI>excitability,</HI> and recal the several deranged functions to their several offices, and continued in for a <HI>length</HI> of <HI>time</HI> sufficient to establish a considerable share of strength and firm∣ness, as it must be rationally supposed, that the patient will much more readily <HI>relaps</HI> into all those <HI>derangements,</HI> peculiar to the disease, by any neglect of proper support, than if he had never been accus∣tomed to them.</P>
<P>I have dwelt longer, and been more explicit on this particular subject, on account of the embarrass∣ments <HI>well</HI> adopted plans are subjected to through the mistaken notions of the sick; say exercise for an example; how seldom is it put in practice by the patient to any purpose? Riding on horse back for instance, when it bids fair to be of utility if attended to a suitable time every day; the patient perhaps
<PB N="48" REF="030645_0052_0FE8450EB476D4F8"/>will attend to it two or three times a week, when conveniency serves; and that in general, in such a manner as rather to expose him, than be of any service.</P>
<P>I wish not to be understood by any thing said, to any how seclude the use of medicine, even in cases of the most chronical debility; where the natural agents which cherish and support, life and vigor fail of being adequate (as before suggested); in such cases their aid is indispensably necessary, and frequently it may be found of utility not only to make use of medicional stimulants and tonics, but blistering the parts of the breast, where, by the pain, &amp;c. we have reason to suspect a more than equal degree of the diathesis; occasional puking, the patient may be also indicated and other collateral prescriptions which do not fall immediately under the general indication of cure. In this place I cannot forbear the recommending to the faculty; the trial (at least) of the shavings of Jamaica mahogany wood in decoction in cases of diarrhoea, which frequently occur in this disease; as from some experience I have had of its use, it appears to me, to be possessed of a stimulant and tonic power or quality peculiarly adapted to the excitability of the intestinal canal, and bids fair to be of utility; the way I used it, was to put 1 oz. of the shavings into a quart of water and boil down to a pint; the dose, 1 oz. of the decoction three or four times a day.</P>
<P>Again, I would here further observe, that as has been before remarked, `that the <HI>slowness</HI> of the progress of the <HI>disease</HI> indicates <HI>weakness</HI> of the hurtful powers;' so <HI>vice verse,</HI> in proportion to its rapidity of progress, the <HI>strength</HI> or increased power
<PB N="49" REF="030645_0053_0FE7EE2F5152E7F0"/>of those agents; is indicated, so in like gradations our attention ought to be aroused to the auxiliary aid of medicine; hence more medicine and that in larger potions may be requisite in the more quick consumptions, than the more slow.</P>
