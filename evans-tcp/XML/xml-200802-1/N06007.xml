What shall we then say to these Things?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the all-wise GOD hath made, and up∣holds the World, by his Pow∣er; so he over-rules, directs, and orders universal Nature, by his Providence. The Dispensations of which have been very extraordinary of late, in the terrible <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> that have been in one Country, and another, and in the dire Ef∣fects they have produced; some of which have been amazingly Awful; and; vastly exceeding, in their Extent thro' many King∣doms, and Countries, and in the Destruction
<PB N="6" REF="007617_0005_102BAA62B3648A38"/>
of many Cities, Towns, Villages, and Places, any thing of the like Kind that ever has been known in any one Year of the World.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It appears from various accounts computed, that the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> being on the first of <HI>Nov.</HI> last, continued for the space of 60 Days, and were felt with more, or less Violence, from the eastern Shores of the <HI>Atlantic Ocean</HI> to the heart of <HI>Germany</HI>; and from the frozen Clime of <HI>Iceland</HI> almost to the Tropick of Cancer; a prodigious
extent of about four thosand Miles from East to West &amp; about two thousand from North to South.</NOTE> <HI>Nation</HI> is rising <HI>against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom</HI>; rumours of <HI>Wars</HI> ready to break out, are spread among the Nations: And our own Nation is obliged to have re∣course to Arms for the defence, and security of her just Rights; and our own Land is actually engaged in a dangerous WAR. Which with the Invasions that hath been made on our <HI>Frontiers,</HI> the Blood that hath been already spilt, and the vigilant Prepara∣tions each side are making for a more vi∣gorous carrying on the War; together with other remarkable Dispensations of Divine Providence, seem all plainly to forebode some great Overtures, and Events in the womb of divine. Providence ready to break forth. What shall we then say to these Things? The frowns of Heaven, and the Dangers
that surround us; does not the same excite
<PB N="7" REF="007617_0006_102BAA2EDF874230"/>
in every thinking Man, good Christian, and loyal Subject, serious, and enquiring Tho'ts what these Dispensations calls us to; what we have to do, and what may best be done, to secure ourselves against those threatning Dangers, and Invasions of our Enemies; which seems to put every Thing that is dear to us at stake; not only the Property of the Country, and our Enjoyments in it; but also our Liberties, Privileges, and the holy Religion we are blessed with; and when this is the general Concern and Enquiry in such a critical Day, where can we better go for Direction than to the sacred Oracles of GOD, which offer the best Directions in all Cases, and Light in the darkest Times. And if we enquire at the Divine <HI>Oracles</HI> we shall find ourselves directed to look to GOD, and seek his Face, and Favour, Presence, and Blessing, as the best, and only sure Way for Deliverance from Dangers &amp; Troubles, &amp; for Protection, and Safety at all Times. For if GOD be for a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> a <HI>Government,</HI> or a <HI>People,</HI> who can be against them to their real Harm, much less to their Ruin: As St. <HI>Paul</HI> triumphantly speaks in our Text,—<HI>What shall we then say to these Things</HI>? TO GOD's abundant Grace towards Christians; his mysterious Love to them in Jesus Christ, his kind, and gracious Intentions towards his
<PB N="8" REF="007617_0007_102BAA6537746558"/>
People, and the wonderful special Care he takes of them; who keeps them as the Ap∣ple of his Eye, who is Afflicted, in all their Afflictions, and ready to their help in every time of Need, to relieve and succour them, to protect and save them in all Times of their Trouble, and Danger; on their <HI>humbly looking to and trusting in him for the same.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What shall we then say to these Things</HI>? Why this we may surely say, and ought believingly and thankfully to say, That <HI>if God be for us who can be against us</HI> so as to prevail to the ruin of GOD's People? Sure∣ly none at all! GOD is for his People, as he is in Covenant with them, &amp; so engaged to them and for them, as he condescends to dwell among them, and take them under his spe∣cial Care, and Protection, and is ready to bestow every needed Blessing of Grace, and Providence on them, on their seeking to, and trusting in him for the same. So that GOD's being for us implies Preservation, and Guidance, Counsel, and Conduct, in all our Ways: Protection, Preservation, and Help in every time of Need, together with the bestowment of all the Blessings of Grace, and Providence, so far as shall be for GOD's Glory, and our best Good; Yea, GOD is for his People, and bringing about their Good and Salvation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emporal, and
<PB N="9" REF="007617_0008_102BAA30E162B120"/>
spiritual when he seems to be against them. And since it is so. <HI>If God be thus for us who can be against us,</HI> so as to prevail to the ruin of GOD's Church and People, be their Ene∣mies never so many, never so strong and potent, never so malicious, politic, and de∣signing. Yet GOD is above them to con∣troul all their Measures, confound their Counsels, and overthrow their evil Machi∣nations against his People. What then can they do while GOD is for his People, and with them, to Protect, Defend, and Pre∣serve them, and Fight for them.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE which seems to offer it self to our Consideration is this, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>That GOD's Favour for, and Presence with his Covenant People, is their Happiness, best Security, and Safety always; especially in Times of Trouble, and Danger.</P>
<P>Their being GOD'S Covenant People, and as such near to him, and interested in his divine Favour, does not exempt them from Enemies, Troubles, and Dangers in this sinful World. No their being so, often raiseth them up Enemies, and exasperates ungodly Men against them, and exposes them to their Rage, and Persecution, who would gladly <HI>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Zion</HI> even to the Foun∣dations
<PB N="10" REF="007617_0009_102BAA66B91C0E60"/>
thereof. But GOD has such a Fa∣vour for them for his Covenants Sake, and for CHRIST's Sake, the Head of the Covenant; and because there are many up∣right <HI>Ones,</HI> and elect <HI>Vessels</HI> in the collective Body) as he has not for the rest of the World. <HI>For what Nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord
our God is in all things that we call up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Him for.</HI> This is their Happiness, in this is their best Security, and Safety: <HI>For if God be for us, who can be against us.</HI></P>
<P>Two Things here offer for clearing the Doctrine (<HI>viz.</HI>) To Consider,</P>
<P N="1">I. What is implied in God's being for, &amp; with his People.</P>
<P N="2">II. To shew, that this is their Happiness, best Security, and Safety always, specially in Times of Trouble, and Danger.</P>
<P>I am then to consider first PROP. I.<HI>What is implied in God's being for, and with his People.</HI> For his being for them, certainty implies his Presence with them, And here, 1. More is intended in it, than that of GOD's being <HI>Providentially</HI> for, and, <HI>Essenti∣ally with them</HI>; for so GOD is for, and with
<PB N="11" REF="007617_0010_102BAA335CDE3E58"/>
the whole Creation: His Presence fills Heaven, and Earth, and all Space. <HI>If I ascend into Heaven, thou art there. If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Psal. 139.8. &amp; seq.</NOTE> He is essentially present with all Creation, upholding all Things by his Power, and
governing universal Nature by his Provi∣dence. He is not far from all, <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>bad,</HI> for in him we Live, and Move, and have our Being: And he is for all Cre∣ation, as he upholds all Things in being, &amp; order by the Word of his Power: Pre∣serves, governs,&amp; provides for all his Crea∣tures. He is providentially good, &amp; kind unto All,&amp; supplies the wants of every living Thing: <HI>All Eyes wait upon God, and he
gives to every one their Meat in due season.</HI>—His tender Mercies are over all his Works. He is especially present with Mankind, in∣specting, and over-ruling the affairs of King∣doms, States, and Governments, to over∣turn, pluck down, or build up as pleaseth him; to deliver, and save the Oppressed, and humble the proud Oppressor. He is present with all Individuals, Observing all our Thoughts, Words, and Actions, and re∣cording the same in his Book of Remem∣brance, in order to bring every Work into
<PB N="12" REF="007617_0011_102BAA68BAD48818"/>
<HI>Judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</HI> Thus GOD is present with the whole Creation, &amp; is for all his Creatures, as he is their <HI>Creator,</HI> universal LORD, Preserver, and Benefactor.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="2">2 GOD is for, and with his own Church and People, in a more eminent, and peculiar Way, and Manner. He has chosen them out from the rest of Mankind, and taken them into Covenant, to be a peculiar People to himself, <HI>a chosen Generation, a royal Priest∣hood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People. He hath brought them near to himself.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Numb 16.10</NOTE> Hence there is none like them in the account of the Blessed GOD; none near to him in Favour as they be: <HI>For what one Nation in the Earth is like thy People, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a People to Himself.</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 7.23.</NOTE> Hence GOD condescends to stand in a peculiar Relation unto them, as their Covenant GOD, and Friend. <HI>For thou hast confirmed to thyself, thy People Israel to be a People unto thee forever; and thou Lord art become their God,</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 Sam 7.24.</NOTE> in a peculiar, and appropriate Sense. Hence they are Stiled his <HI>Chosen,</HI> his <HI>Saints,</HI> his <HI>Portion,</HI> and the <HI>Lot</HI> of his Inheritance. <HI>For the Lord's Por∣tion
<PB N="13" REF="007617_0012_102BAA3694E84F68"/>
is his People, Jacob is the Lot of his Inheritance.</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Deut. 32.9</NOTE> Therefore the LORD takes them under his peculiar Care, and <HI>keeps them as the Apple of his Eye</HI>: He interest's him∣self in all their Interest; and is afflicted in all their Afflictions, as the Prophet speaks: <HI>In all their afflictions, he was Afflicted, the Angel of his Presence Saved them, in his Love, and in his Pity he Redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the Days of Old.</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Isa. 63.9</NOTE> So that GOD's being for us, or for his Covenant People, implies his Fa∣vour for them, Presence with them, Care of them, Guidance, Protection, help in Trouble, Deliverance, and Salvation.</P>
<P>Hence,</P>
<P N="1">(1) It implies special Favour, such as GOD has not for the rest of Mankind. He is their Father, and they are the Sons, and Daughters of the Living GOD. <HI>For thou art an holy People unto the Lord thy God, the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special People unto himself; above all People that are upon the Face of the Earth: And he hath avouched thee this Day to be his peculi∣ar People.</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Deut 14.2.&amp;7.6.&amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6 18</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">(2) Care and watchfulness for their Pro∣tection &amp; Safety. 'Tis his Vineyard over
<PB N="14" REF="007617_0013_102BAA3818EC37F0"/>
which he does watch Night &amp; Day. <HI>I the Lord do keep it, I will Water it every Mo∣ment; left any hurt it, I will keep it Night, and Day.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Isa. 27.3.</NOTE> Because he is for them, his Eye is ever towards them for Good, watch∣ing over them, to preserve, p ot &amp;, and Defend them, as a sheperd does his Flock. <HI>For the Eyes of the Lord run to, and fro in the whole Earth, to shew himself Strong, in behalf of them,</HI> whom he favours.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 16.9</NOTE> <HI>The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is th shade up∣on thy right Hand</HI>: And <HI>be that keepeth Israel, shall neither Slumber, nor Sleep.</HI> Therefore, <HI>Fear not, O my Servant Jacob, faith the Lord, neither be dismayed, O Israel, for so I will save thee from a far, for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee.</HI></P>
<P>And he is thus ready to help, and save them, as having a peculiar Favour for them, even when he Corrects them, and seems to be against them: Hence the Prophet re∣proves Israel for distrusting GOD's Favour for them, and Care of them, even in the very darkest Times. <HI>Why sayest thou O Jacob, and speakest O Israel, my Way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is passed over from my God</HI>? 'T was what they had
no Ground to say of GOD; for he was al∣ways
<PB N="15" REF="007617_0014_102BAA39A48E5A48"/>
both ready and able to Help, and Save them. <HI>He giveth power to the Faint, and to them that have no Might, be increa∣seth strength.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3) Divine Guidance, and Conduct: GOD is for them; therefore will he Guide them by his prudent Counsel: <HI>As he taught Ephraim to go, taking him by the Arms</HI>:<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hes. 11.3.</NOTE> So he led, and conducted Israel all the Days of Old. <HI>He led him about, he instruct∣ed him, he kept him as the Apple of his Eye. So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Deut. 32.10.12.</NOTE> In like manner GOD assures his People, they shall not want his divine Guidance, Counsel, and Conduct. <HI>For he that hath Mercy on them, shall lead them, even to Springs of Water, shall he Guide them—I will lead him also, and restore Comforts to him, and to his Mourners.</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Isa. 49.10. &amp; 57.18.</NOTE> To this end hath he given us his sacred Oracles <HI>to be a Lamp unto our Feet, and a Light unto our Paths</HI>; to teach and point out to us the Way of Duty, and Safety, and be our Guide to Happiness.</P>
<P>Again, He Guides his People by the in∣fluences, and unerring Counsels of his blessed Spirit; making them to <HI>hear a Voice behind
<PB N="16" REF="007617_0015_102BAA6A9751D558"/>
them saying, This is the Way, walk ye in it; when they turn to the right Hand. &amp; when they turn to the Left.</HI> He Guides them also by his Providences and the special hints, and intimations of the same. <HI>I will instruct thee and teach thee in the Way that thou shalt go, I will Guide thee with mine Eye</HI>;<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Psal. 32.8.</NOTE><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the secret intimations of his Will in the hints, and turns of Providence, which he enables his People to understand, and take Direction from, as a Man makes his Ser∣vant know his Mind by the wink of his Eye Moreover, He guides, and conducts them by wise Rulers, and faithful Teachers, which his Providence sets over them, to this very end: <HI>Thou leadest thy People like a Flock by the Hand of Moses, and Aaron.</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Psal. 77.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> GOD indeed Led them by the <HI>Pillar</HI> of <HI>Cloud</HI> by Day, and of <HI>Fire</HI> by Night. But more especially by the Agency, &amp; Conduct of Moses, and Aaron, whom he appointed over them in their respective Orders to lead, and guide his People, in the ways of Duty and Safety. How great a Blessing this! and what safety to the State! Such are good Rulers, and faithful Teachers to every State, and Church, great Blessings, her Safety, Strength, and Ornament. <HI>The
<PB N="17" REF="007617_0016_102BAA3C26092308"/>
Chariots of Israel, and the Hors-men thereof.</HI> To which end, GOD is with the Rulers of his People; <HI>Counselling their Cousellors, and Teaching their Senators Wisdom.</HI> He di∣rects them by Wisdom from on High, in the great Affairs of State, and leads them into right Councils in critical, &amp; dangerous Times, that he may save his People by their Hands. How much then should we praise? and how Thankful to GOD should we be, for the Blessing of good Rulers? And how ready should we be to Obey them? By whom GOD Leads, and Guide us for our Safety, and Benefit. Let us prize, and im∣prove the Blessing as becomes the Character of Christians.</P>
<P N="4">(4) It implies Help in Times of Danger, and Trouble, and sure Deliverance, in GOD's Time, which is the best Time. So the Prophet throws the Gauntlet, and bids Defi∣ance in the Name of the Lord, to all the Enemies of his People. <HI>Associate yourselves, O ye People, and ye shall be broken in Pieces; and give ear, all ye of far Countries; gird yourselves for War; and ye shall be Broken in pieces; Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in Pieces: Take Counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the Word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us,</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Isa. 8.9, 10.</NOTE> to Fight for us, Save, and Deliver us.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="007617_0017_102BAA6C1E4CA720"/>GOD indeed may seem to be against his People, suffering WARS, and various Evils to break in upon them, for their Sins, A∣postacies, and unworthy Carriage toward Him. But he is for them still, and with them in their Troubles, and Adversities. <HI>When thou passest thro' the Waters I will be with thee; and thro' the Rivers they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest thro' the Fire thou shall not be burnt, neither shall the Flame kindle upon thee.—For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy one of Israel, thy Salvation.</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Isa. 43.2.</NOTE> And GOD's People at last, shall see their Desire upon their Enemies, and shall Tri∣umph over them. Faithful is he that hath Promised, he will Perform it. How Safe then must that People be even in the midst of Dangers, that have the most High for them, and with them.</P>
<P N="5">(5) Finally here, GOD's being for us in∣cludes in it all Happiness. For his Favour is Life, and his Smiles give all Prosperity. <HI>Happy is that People that is in such a Case; yea, Happy is that People whose God is the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Psal. 144.15.</NOTE> GOD can make those things that seem to be most against us, and most hurt∣ful and dangerous to Church &amp; State; yet to work together for our Good, Interest, Safety,
<PB N="19" REF="007617_0018_102BAA3EB01EBDA8"/>
and Happiness; their Enemies when he pleases shall serve them to these Ends. <HI>They shall bow down their Faces towards the Earth, and lick up the Dust of thy Feet.</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Isa 49 23.</NOTE> Thus all who wait for GOD, and trust in Him, and are resigned to his Will, shall find sure Deliverance at last; and not be disap∣pointed in their Hope. <HI>For I will</HI> (says GOD) <HI>contend with them, that contend with thee, and will Save thy Children. And will feed them that Oppress thee, with their own Flesh, and they shall be drunken with their own Blood, as with sweet Wine; and all Flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour, and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Isa. 49 26.</NOTE> Thus GOD is for his People.</P>
<P>I am in the next, and last Place to shew,</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That in this consists our Hap∣piness, best Security, and Safety at all Times, especially in Times of Trouble, and Danger.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis GOD's Presence with his People that makes them Great, and Honourable, Safe, and Happy; and is their best Security in Times of threatning Danger; for where GOD is present, sure Help is nigh, and Sal∣vation at hand. <HI>He is a present Help in time of Trouble; God is in the midst of her,
<PB N="20" REF="007617_0019_102BAA6F6705A790"/>
she shall not be moved; God shall Help her (his Church) and that right early</HI>:<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Psal. 46.1.5.</NOTE> Or as the Apostle triumphantly expresseth it, <HI>If God be for us, who can be against us</HI>? Who can harm a People, or ruin them who have GOD among them, and for them? to Guide, Protect, and Save them: Who have his Favour as an <HI>Hedge,</HI> and <HI>Wall</HI> of Secu∣rity round about them; to keep off all E∣nemies, and every evil <HI>Occurrent.</HI> That this is their Happiness always, and Safety, spe∣cially in evil Times, and amidst Dangers, will fully appear, if we consider,</P>
<P N="1">[1] The almighty Power of GOD, enga∣ged to, and for his own Covenant People. Having an Interest in GOD as his Covenant People, they have an Interest in all his Divine Perfections, Power, Widom, Goodness, Un∣changeableness &amp;c. according to that, <HI>Son thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</HI><NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Luk. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.31.</NOTE> They that are with GOD in Covenant, have Interest in all that GOD is, and all that he has.

Kings for their sake, with a charge to do them no Harm. GOD's Angels also, those blessed Ministers of his Power, incamp round about his People, and delivers them, and annoy and destroy their Enemies at his Command, as they did the Assyrian Host, besieging Jerusalem. How safe then must GOD's People be under the Protection of his infinite Power, engaged for them? While all Providences, all creatures, all Na∣ture at his Command, becomes engaged for their Defence, and Protection; and <HI>under∣neath are the everlasting Arms.</HI> —This Pow∣er of GOD engaged for his People, is an infinite, unlimited, and everlassting Power:</P>
<P>And therefore,</P>
<P N="1">(1.)Infinitely exceeds any Power that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be engag'd against them. What is the power of mighty Princes, or potent Nations combin'd, to the almighty Power of GOD? how easily can he check, and controul them, &amp; turn all their devices head long; and con∣found them in every Enterprise. <HI>All the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as no∣thing; they are as a drop of a Bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the Ballance.</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Isa. 40.I5.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord shall laugh at them</HI>; and has their vain Attemps against them in <HI>Derision.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="007617_0022_102BAA41B76A5338"/>(2.) GOD's Power has fast hold of the Hearts of all Men; that he can controul all the Counsels of his People's Enemies; curb their Pride, and Passions, and bring them to be at Peace with his People, when he will; or can confound them in all their Counsels taken against his People, and turn them in∣to foolishness. <HI>For he leadeth Counsellors a∣way spoiled, and maketh the Judges Fools.</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Job 12.17.</NOTE> <HI>The Wisdom of their wise Men shall perish; and the Understanding of their prudent Men shall be hid.</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Isa. 29.14.</NOTE> Or he can take away their Hearts, intimidate their Minds, that their Hands cannot perform their Enterprises: He can so weaken their Strength, and Cou∣rage, That <HI>one Man shall chase a Thousand, and ten put ten Thousand to flight.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) The mighty Power of GOD can Save his People in the greatest Dangers, and bring about their Salvation, in ways, and by means (to us) the least likely, and probable. How unlikely was it to humane Probability that Pharaoh should be brought to let GOD's People go from under his tyrannical Yoke in manner as he did, laden with Jewels, and rich Spoils of the Egyptians, and that when pursued by the strength of Egypt, the Sea should open a safe, and dry Passage to GOD's
<PB N="24" REF="007617_0023_102BAA73B256EAC8"/>
People: But drown all their Enemies! How improbable was it to humane appear∣ance that Gideon with his three Hundred Men, Arm'd only with Pitchers, Lamps, &amp; Trumpets,should discomfit, and destroy, that vast Army of Midianites, who with their Allies were like Grass-hoppers for Multitude? Also that Deborah, and Barak with a few ill-arm'd, &amp; undisciplined Men, should defeat, and destroy <HI>Sisera,</HI> and his vast Army, strengthned with a Thousand Chariots of Iron?</P>
<P>Moreover, in the days of the Judges, &amp; afterwards under pious Kings: How often did the Lord make an handful of his People Victorious over vast Armies of their Ene∣mies? When to humane probability Vict∣ory must have turned to the other side.—But 'tis equally easy to infinite Power to Save by many, or by few. And he saved his People because they called upon and trusted in Him.</P>
<P>This Observation might be brought down to latter Times, &amp; nearer to ourselves. Who more unlikely than King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to bring on that glorious Reformation, began in our Nation, in his Reign, and effected by wonderful Means! Or than King <HI>James</HI> II. to open the Way to that glorious <HI>Revolu∣tion,</HI> and that by Arbitrary proceedings &amp;
<PB N="25" REF="007617_0024_102BAA442F797910"/>
jesuitical Counsels; Means indirect enough to so glorious an Event; yet by these were the Eyes of the Nation opened, and the Way paved to that great Salvation.</P>
<P>Again, How often did our <HI>Predecessors,</HI> the first Planters of this Country, experience glorious Salvations wrought for them, a∣gainst their numerous, surrounding Enemies when their Numbers, and Strength, was as nothing compared to that of their Enemies.</P>
<P>In like manner the Success granted our small Army in the last War against that strong Fortress of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI>; was cer∣tainly a Salvation beyond a rational Pro∣bability. And when thereupon a strong Fleet, was sent from France, to attempt the recovery of that Place, or make Reprizals on us. How totally was it frustrated, and broken by the immediate Hand of Heaven?<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">This French Fleet consisted of about 16 Sail of large of Men of War, mostly line of battle Ships, and some small Frigates, and a large Number of Transports, with Troops on board; a Strong Ar∣miment this! but very Sickly when they arrived in <HI>Chebucto</HI> Harbour, where they lay for some Time, and Buried many: They made no attempt on any Place, but putting again to Sea, were broken, &amp; parted by a violent Storm, in which some Perished, and many more being taken in one Place, and another, few ever got safe back to France. How great a Disappointment this to France! And how remarkable, memorable, and favourable a Providence this, to this Land.</NOTE> How great a Mercy to this Land? How glorious a Salvation this!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007617_0025_102BAA75622A0C48"/>Nor indeed is the Hand of GOD to be less seen and acknowleged in the signal disap∣poinment &amp; overthrow of the <HI>French Fleet,</HI> persidiously sent against <HI>Halifax,</HI> and <HI>Nova∣Scotia</HI> last Summer, to fall upon, seise, and destroy the same, under the cover of Peace.—Also in the Success, and glorious Victory granted to our Forces at <HI>Lake-George</HI>; when the Enemy apprehended the Advan∣tage to ly so on their Side, that they came on to Battle with raised expectaions of Suc∣cess, and Victory. But the greater was their Disappoinments, and Defeat. Thus does the Almighty GOD sometimes bring about the Salvation of his People, and do great Things for them, in Ways, and by Means, least likely to human Probability. Well, <HI>if God be for us, who</HI> then <HI>can be against us</HI>: Let us obey his Laws, seek his Favour, and Trust in Him, then we shall be safe amidst all the threatning Dangers that any Time surround us.</P>
<P N="2">2 The Truth under consideration will further appear if we consder the infinite Wisdom of GOD. He is Wise in Heart as
<PB N="27" REF="007617_0026_102BAA462F2C89C0"/>
well as mighty in Power, can therefore save his People in every State, and Con∣dition, be their Dangers never so eminent, their Enemies never so crafty, malicious, and powerful, nothing can escape his No∣tice who is omnipresent; nor can infinite Wisdom ever be over∣reached, or ever be at a loss what to do in any Case. How vain then must all the attempts of the Enemy be against GOD; or against those he will pro∣tect? For <HI>there is no Wisdom, nor Counsel against the Lord.</HI> And as his Wisdom ex∣tends to a perfect Knowledge of all Things in all Worlds; seeing at one single View all the purposes in the Hearts of Men, all their Counsels, Actions, and Designs: So he knows how to <HI>take the Wise in their own Craftiness,</HI> and save his People from every Plot, hatched, or hatching against them, by their Enemies; and this he sometimes <HI>does,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) By directing them into salutary, &amp; right Counsels for their own Safety, and Defence. They know not (it may be) their own Danger but GOD does, and by his di∣vine Wisdom directs them into right Mea∣sures for their own Defence, and Safety. He influences, and enlarges their Minds, giving to them such a Spirit of Wisdom, Counsel, and Forecast, as to over-match the Counsels of their Enemies; supplant them
<PB N="28" REF="007617_0027_102BAA78E6F63E40"/>
in their evil Designs, and guard themselves against all their attempts upon them: They have Prudence given them <HI>to fore-see the Evil, and hide themselves,</HI> they are directed from on High to proper Expedients, and wise Precautions, for their own Safety, and Defence: Even as the <HI>British Court</HI> in the Summer past, were directed into a Foresight of, and into right Counsels &amp; Measures for, disappointing and defeating, the secret and persidious Designs of the <HI>French Court</HI> on <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and other English Settlements on this Continent.</P>
<P>And as the Officers of the Army at <HI>Lake∣George</HI> were directed into a right Conduct on the critical Day of Battle there; by which Means GOD saved his People; the greater Part of them, from the cruel Designs of that Blood-thirsty <HI>Army of French,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and gave us a Signal <HI>Victory</HI> over them, on that Memorable EIGHT OF SEPTEMBER last: Very conspicuous were the intermedi∣ate Steps of divine Providence, leading on, and opening the Way to that great Salvati∣on:<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">I was my-self an Eye witness of this great Action, and saw the Salvation of the LORD on that Day. The particulars of which are carefully Recorded, in my <HI>Journal</HI> of that Expedition.</NOTE> And a great Smile of Providence was it on these Churches: May the same
<PB N="29" REF="007617_0028_102B857AAE89ECD8"/>
never be forgotten; and all the Praise be ascribe there, where 'tis all Due.—</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Sometimes by seasonable provi∣dential Warnings, discovering, and pointing out their Danger: Sometimes in an ordi∣nary, and sometimes in an extraordinary Way. So GOD warned the King of <HI>Israel</HI> by his Prophet of the designed <HI>Invasion</HI> of the King of <HI>Syria</HI> upon him. By which means he was enabled to Defeat the same, and Save himself, <HI>not once, nor twice.</HI> Of the same kind was the Discovery that divine Providence made of the secret, and dread∣ful <HI>Gun-Powder-Plot,</HI> in our own Nation; a Mercy of Heaven never to be for∣gotten. So the cruel Plots of the Churches Enemies laid against them, are disappointed, and broken by a seasonable Discovery made of them by divine Providence.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Sometimes by providing for them an <HI>Azylum,</HI> a City of Refuge, or Place of defence, and safety from impending Dan∣gers, and Ruin. As GOD provided an <HI>Ark</HI> for Noah, and his Family: A <HI>Zoar</HI> for Lot and His—And the City of <HI>Pella</HI> for the first Christians, to which they fled, and were Saved, when Jerusalem was Destroyed. And so the Earth helped the Woman, and the Wilderness was made her safe Retreat, from the Rage of the <HI>Dragon.</HI> Even as this
<PB N="30" REF="007617_0029_102BAA7A6AD915F0"/>
wilderness Land was made of GOD a safe Retreat to our Fathers, when they fled from the Persecutions at Home.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Sometimes by controuling, and overruling the Enemies Counsels, for His People's Deliverance.</P>
<P>GOD rules supreme in the Courts of Princes, and over all the Children of Pride; turning their Hearts, and overruling their Counsels at His Pleasure. <HI>The Kings Heart is in the Hand of the LORD: As the Rivers of Water He turneth it whethersover He will.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 21.1.</NOTE> Sometimes he leaves, or gives them up to a Spirit of Infatuation; that they are insnared in their own Ways, and confounded in their own Counsels; they are guided by a Spirit of Folly to their own Ruin. When a People are left to weak, and foolish, and to uncertain, and wicked Counsels: Not having Wisdom to project right Means; nor steadiness, nor courage to pursue pro∣per Measures, what then is like to follow but their own Disappointment and Ruin, to the Deliverance, and Salvation of GOD'S own People? Thus was the haughty King of <HI>Syria</HI> confounded in his own Counsels at the Siege of <HI>Samaria</HI>; when relying on the superior Numbers and Strength of his
<PB N="31" REF="007617_0030_102BAA48E2CB3A00"/>
Army, he despised <HI>Ahab,</HI> and his handful of Men coming out to raise the Siege; and gave those foolish, and haughty Orders, <HI>Whether they be come out for Peace take them alive, or whether they be come out for War take them alive.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 20 18.</NOTE> On which followed his immediate Defeat, with a great slaughter of his Army, to the Deliverance of GOD's People. And it may teach all Generals that a despised Enemy often proves a for∣midable one; as those two experienced Generals with their old veteran Soldiers from <HI>Europe</HI> found it to be last Summer, when they despised the raw, and unexperi∣enced Soldiery of this Country to their own Defeat and Ruin.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">General <HI>Braddock,</HI> who unhappily fell in the Battle at <HI>Ohio,</HI> July 9th. 1755. And the French General. <HI>Baron de Dieskau,</HI> who was Beaten, dangerously Wounded, and taken Prisoner in the Battle at <HI>Lake George, Sept..</HI> 8th. 1755.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">(5.) Sometimes by dividing their Counsels so that they shall weaken the Hands of one another, and so cannot perform their Enter∣prize. Scarce any thing is more dangerous to a State, or Army, than divided Counsels, or want of Unity in them: And when this is found prevailing, 'tis an Omen of the approaching Ruin of that State, or Army. And thus GOD sometimes divides the Coun∣sels
<PB N="32" REF="007617_0031_102BAA7BED9FEA98"/>
of His Churches Enemies, by which He defeats their malicious Designs, and saves His People. So that vast consederate Army which came up against <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> and his Kingdom were utterly Destroyed by divided Counsels, and Mutiny among themselves. <HI>Ammon, and Moab stood up against the Inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them.</HI> And that being done <HI>every one helped to destroy another.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 20.13.</NOTE> And thus GOD's People had Deliverance from that formidable Invasion.—How dan∣gerous, and destructive a Thing is Mutiny in an Army! and how carefully should every leading step to it be avoided, and unity of Counsels be maintained as they would hope to prosper, and be successful.</P>
<P>But to proceed</P>
<P N="6">(6) GOD can take off the Enemies of his People from their malicious Designs against them, by cutting them out other Work to do. Thus he defeated the designs of <HI>Sennacherib</HI> when he came with a powerful Army to sack, and destroy <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and delivered His People from that eminent Danger <HI>by causing him to hear a Rumour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 19 7.</NOTE> of an Invasion coming on his own King∣dom, on which he raised the Siege, and
<PB N="33" REF="007617_0032_102BAA4AF75C3DC0"/>
hastened Home for the Defence of his own Territories. So GOD causeth evil Men to make Work for one another, and thus secures the Peace, and Safety of His own People. Such Work may possibly be cut∣ting out for the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> to employ them on this critical Day, by the Jesuits usurped Kingdom in <HI>Paraguay,</HI> and the progress he is making down the <HI>River Plate</HI> to enlarge his new Kingdom. This may be a means of hindring the junction of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Arms with the <HI>French</HI> against us, or at least of dividing, and weakning down their Power,—Or Again,</P>
<P N="7">(7.) When GOD's People are to all ap∣pearance on the brink of Ruin He can raise them up some mighty Deliverer, and so save them from all the Danger as he did for <HI>Israel</HI> many a Time. A <HI>Moses,</HI> a <HI>Joshua,</HI> a <HI>Sampson,</HI> a <HI>Jephtha,</HI> a <HI>David.</HI> And for our own Nation a <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> when it was on the brink of Ruin.—And may I not add a <HI>GEORGE</HI> too, whence we enjoy the present happy Establishment? Yea GOD can make the <HI>Beast</HI> help the <HI>Woman,</HI> the Papists, the Protestants, as he has many a Time done.—Or further,</P>
<P N="8">(8.) He can help and save his People by giving them a Superiority of Wisdom, Strenght, and Courage, to overmatch their
<PB N="34" REF="007617_0033_102BAA7ED3B3D6A8"/>
Enemies: As he gave to the Jews in the Time of Esther on the Day of their intend∣ded Assassination, <HI>When no Man could with∣stand them but the Fear of them fell on all People</HI>:<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Esther 9.2.</NOTE> And their Enemies were so in∣timidated that they could not find their Hands,—Or again,</P>
<P N="9">(9.) GOD will by his own immediate Hand break the Power of the Enemy; and open the way for the Deliverance, and Sal∣vation of his People. As he did for Israel when he opened a Passage thro' the <HI>red Sea,</HI> for their Deliverance, from the Power of the pursuing Egyptians. Or as in the Days of Joshua, and Deborah, when the Stars in their Courses, Sun, and Moon, Fought a∣gainst the Enemies of GOD's People; and GOD Rained from Heaven, Hail-stones, Fire, and Tempest, on their Heads to their utter Destruction, and Overthrow before his People; <HI>So let all thine Enemies Perish, O Lord.</HI>—Or,</P>
<P N="10">(10.) Finally, By removing particular Persons out of this World, in the very crisis of his Churches Danger: As in the Case of Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> &amp; <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. So his Church had Deliverance, and Salvation. Thus in∣finite Wisdom is never at a loss to find out
<PB N="35" REF="007617_0034_102BAA4CF0318258"/>
ways, and means by which to Save his Peo∣ple be their Streights, and Dangers what they will. He will make the Wrath of Man to Praise him, and the remainder there∣of he will restrain: Surely they are safe, &amp; happy then, who have GOD for and with them; a present and all-sufficient Help in every Time of Need.</P>
<P N="3">3 The Truth before us will further appear if we consider the infinite Goodness of GOD engaged for his People's Safety: GOD be∣ing for his People, his Goodness, and Mer∣cy is engaged for them, and to them. So when Moses was under fearful Apprehensi∣ons whether Israels Sin in making the mol∣ten Calf, and their frequent Murmurings would not wholly throw them out of the divine Favour, and Protection: GOD to Satisfy him was pleased to say, <HI>I will make all my Goodness to pass before thee</HI>;<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Exod 33.19</NOTE> lead∣ing my People, and will be merciful to my People, and spare them as a Father does his Son: That their Follies, and Failings shall not cast them out of my Protection.—Here lies the Difficulty, when we find so much a∣miss with ourselves; and looking abroad find so much Sin in Church, and State; I∣niquity abounding, and the Love of many
<PB N="36" REF="007617_0035_102BAA80D5C08AE0"/>
waxing Cold; so much degeneracy from the pious Paths our Fathers walked in, &amp;c. Our Hearts are ready to misgive and say, Can GOD be for such a degenerate, sinful, &amp; backsliding People? Will he save a People walking so unworthy the Grace, and Privi∣leges indulged them? Now under such dark Apprehensions, GOD's boundless, and co∣venanted Mercy, is our only Support, and it is a proper, and sufficient Foundation for Faith, Hope, and Trust in GOD: If his Churches will consider and turn to him, at the call of his Word, and rebukes of his Providences (and not Tempt GOD by trust∣ing in him to deliver, and save them, while yet they refuse to put away those Sins for which he is Correcting them) for this is the intendment of all his corrective, Dispensati∣ons, not to destroy his People; no, but a∣mend them, and teach them Righteousness, and stir us up to seek his Face, and Favour that he may appear for, deliver, and save us. <HI>God is slow to Anger, but swift to show Mercy,</HI> and to save his People. He is sovereign in his Goodness, boundless in his Grace; the Reasons of which are from, and within himself: <HI>He therefore hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy</HI>; and so because he will. And thou' when his People Sin, and grow corrupt he will withdraw his wonted
<PB N="37" REF="007617_0036_102BAA4E774EF750"/>
Protection, and Favour, and <HI>return to his Place, 'till they acknowledge their Offences, and seek his Face</HI>: Yet he remembers them as his Covenant People still, and waits to shew Mercy, is ready to be Intreated of them, Appear for, and Save them, when e∣ver they <HI>acknowledge their Offences, and seek his Face,</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hos. 5.15.</NOTE> and Protection.—His turning away from his People, is not his disowning, and casting them off: No, but he remembers them as his Covenant People still, and has a Favour for them, for the sake of the Covenant into which he has taken them, and for Christ's sake the Head of the Covenant, and Stiles himself a Cove∣nant-keeping GOD which he is never un∣mindful of, <HI>But remembers his Covenant for∣ever, the Word which he Commanded to a thousand Generations,</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Psa. 105.8</NOTE> 'Tis not therefore (blessed be GOD's Goodness) every change in us, that will throw us out of his Cove∣nant, Favour, and protecting Goodness: No, for saith the Most High, <HI>I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not consumed,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mali. 3.6.</NOTE> in your own Changes.—Supernatural Grace, contending with Sinfulness of Men.—<HI>Milton</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Paradi.

<P><PB N="38" REF="007617_0037_102BAA82CFEE04A8"/>Further, GOD's infinite Goodness, and Mercy towards his Covenant People, ap∣pears in his readiness to hear any Intercessions made in their behalf, any Prayers put up for them, that he may Spare, Save, and have Mercy on them; <HI>And he saw that there was no Man, and be wondred that there was no Intercessor</HI>:<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Isa. 59.16.</NOTE> He looked for some to plead, and pray for his People, as being rea∣dy to hear any Intercessions in their behalf, <HI>And he wondered, that there was no Interces∣sor,</HI> none to speak a good Word, to put up a few earnest Prayers for his People, as be∣ing ready and desirous to be intreated on their behalf, that he might Spare and have Mercy on them, and save them out of their Troubles, notwithstanding their Provocati∣ons: How rich is GOD in Mercy, &amp; Good∣ness towards his People? How willing to have his Hand stayed, and his Wrath turn∣ed away, when they have provoked him to Anger by their many Provocations? Yea, after long waiting, and continued incorri∣gibleness in his People, yet how loth is di∣vine Goodness to give them up to Ruin. <HI>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim?

mine Heart is turned within me, my repent∣ings are kindled together: I will not execute the fierceness of mine Anger: I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not Man, the holy One in the midst of thee,</HI>—<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hos 11, 8.9.</NOTE> So the tender Father reasons with himself, How can I cast off my untoward Son?

I remem∣ber my <HI>Covenant</HI> with them; mine <HI>Elect</HI> among them; and shall not I Save, &amp; Spare them for these Elect's Sake, and for my covenant Mercies Sake? For, <HI>He will ever be mindful of his Covenant; many a Time did he Deliver them, but they provoked him with their Counsels; and were brought low for their Iniquity.

And they, have sufficient Reason, and Encouragement so to do; being as his Covenant People interested in all his blessed Perfections for their Security, and having his divide Promise for it, that if we turn to him, he will turn to us, <HI>Turn Ye unto me, saith the Lord of Hosts, &amp; I will turn unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts</HI>;<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Zach. 1.3.</NOTE> GOD is for his People, a present Help in Time of Trouble and Danger, to all that Call upon, and trust in him, and he is able to Deliver, and Save them, when all other Help seems to fail; yea, that is GOD's usual Time to Help.—And 'tis much for the Honour of GOD, and what his Perfections demand at our Hands; that turning to him when he Rebukes us, we Trust in him without Dismay, and that in the most difficult, and threatning Times 'Tis no great matter to trust when there is little, or no apparent Danger; but when

He is jealous for the purity of Religion, and his own Worship, and will not endure to have the Truth perverted, and despised; his Ordi∣nances slighted, neglected, and trampled on: We shall find it at our Peril if we do so: And yet how growing are sinful Practices of this kind in this Land of great Light?

<P>[4] and finally, Let every one be excited to consider his own Ways, repent of, and put away all Sin, for which GOD is conten∣ding with us, and diligently seek his Face &amp; Favour, and gracious Presence with his Peo∣ple.
