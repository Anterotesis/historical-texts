<P>MADAM WILLIS's <HI>LETTERS,</HI> and her <HI>CHARACTER.</HI> WITH SOME STRICTURES OF Madam ANN STOCKBRIDGE'S: AND THE CHARACTER OF Madam <HI>Sarah Page.</HI></P>
<L>THREE ladies in two distant counties born,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two of them were born in the county of Plymouth; the other in the county of Essex—(the maiden name of this lady was Carlton). This is noticed that they may have the honour of giving birth to these ladies, who were an honour to their sex; and that the ladies of the present age <HI>there,</HI> may labour to shine with equal lustre. May the ladies in other counties, by these examples be fired with a laudable ambition to excel. The males of any taste wish to see it: then would they lead them to their bowers with as much pleasure as Adam did their mother Eve—and would think that Astrae with all her train, were returned to this earth. Then would the mountains and the little hills rejoice, while the flowers overspread the lawns; and the little rivulets, as they ran from the Manadnocks, and every high hill, into the valleys, would murmur their praise: for their minds would be adorned with all the flowers which grow upon the banks of the Parnassian streams. How would they shine!—Will not the ladies of the present ages that are rich in this worlds be rich in good works? Yes, they will: they will improve their own minds— and will scatter books among the poor of their sex, that they may do the same, if they have minds capable of giving entertainment to a noble ambition; an ambition to desire that their names may survive the wastes of time, and that they may set an example to the generations that shall come after thems to go and do likewise, that the story of the nymphs may be no longer fabulous.</NOTE></L>
<L>Whose lives, their age and country did adorn:</L>
<L>Such striking pictures sure must please their sex,</L>
<L>And merit from the males their warm respects.</L>
<L>The fam'd WILLIS, STOCKBRIDGE alike, and PAGE—</L>
<L>Ye bards, hand down their names through ev'ry age:</L>
<L>Then will the nymphs of future times, rehearse</L>
<L>Your praise, in sounding rhyme and flowing verse.</L>

<P>THE ladies whose characters are exhibited to view in minia∣ture in the following pages, were born
<Q><L>To raise the virtues, animate the bliss,</L>
<L>And sweeten all the toils of human life.</L>
<L>Grace was in all their steps—heaven in their eyes—</L>
<L>In every gesture, dignity and love.</L></Q></P>
<P>Shall not the ladies of the present age have such lovely pic∣tures to gaze upon, that the ladies of the next may be improved by theirs: and even in country towns, that they may shine as the nymphs in days of yore in the valleys.—I wish all the la∣dies in America that have shone might be noticed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I might have noticed many others in the last age, who shone to advantage; but my time would have failed me. May some other writer, whose fortune and capacity is larger than mine, be disposed to bring their names back from the land of forgetfulness: and when they are noticed, may the ladies of fortune spread their names among their sex, that their names may be spread in the next ages and not be confined to their coffins, or lost in a grave or a tomb, or even be des∣pised beforehand.</NOTE> They would form, I trust, a beautiful gallaxy, which might be viewed by every sensible mind with as much pleasure as we view the milky-way, when it shines the brightest. It would dispose the softer sex to labour after every female accomplishment; and in∣cline the males to repair to the springs and the lawns, to seek them in their retreat in the noon-day breezes, that they might be charmed with the melodious sound of their enchanting voices, and with that sterling sense that would flow from their lips when their ideas were formed into words. They would smooth every roughness in the males, and remind them of that sweet harmony which subsists in the angelick spheres, and tune their voices in praise of their Maker, that he had formed such creatures to dwell upon the globe, to sweeten the drops which distilled from their brows, when they were making the necessary preparations for life; yes, they would remind them of their mother Eve in her state of innocence, and when she shone in the walks of Paradise, before the serpent made his appearance.—But I have done▪ and the reader may pass on, and see how beautiful is a female's composition—when she can mourn with them that mourn, and weep with them that weep.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Rachel</HI>'s Sepulchre; OR, A MEMORIAL OF Mrs. <HI>Lydia Willis,</HI> Taken, chiefly, from her Letters to Friends, on various occasions.</HEAD>
<P>A DESIRE to preserve the memory of worthy and beloved Friends, especially of such as have, thro' the course of their lives approved themselves the friends of God, is not only founded in nature, but seems evidently warranted in the holy Scriptures. God has told us that <HI>the righteous shall be in everlasting remem∣brance</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Psalms 112 6.</NOTE>; and that <HI>the memory of the just is blessed</HI> <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Prov. 10 7.</NOTE>— Which implies the care of Providence, not by <HI>miracle,</HI> but by the <HI>use</HI> of <HI>proper means,</HI> in preserving the memory of such <HI>just</HI> and <HI>righteous</HI> persons: While those of an opposite character, thro' neglect, are forgotten. Their very name is blotted out; as it follows, <HI>but the name of the wicked shall rot.</HI></P>
<P>From this principle, no doubt, and with this view even to perpetuate the memory of his beloved <HI>Rachel</HI> the <HI>Patriarch Jacob</HI> raised a monument over her grave Gen. 35, 19, 20, <HI>Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath; and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day:</HI> which was known, in after ages, to be <HI>Rachel's</HI> sepulchre, and re∣ferred to, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10, 2.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021608_0004_0FB4113384A8E2E8"/>But there are other monuments equally durable and more instructive, due to the merits of some departed friends, which may be justly expected, as they are earnestly desired by the living; for this worthy end, that God may be glorified and praised, for his gifts and graces, bestowed on the children of men, whereby he alone makes <HI>one</HI> to differ from <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>monuments</HI> here intended, are the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of persons whose excellent spirit, christian conversation, profitable writings and good works, do furnish materials both to entertain and edify succeeding generations, who, without such memorials, would entirely miss the benefit.</P>
<P>Tis with this view, and not without some hopes of attaining this end that I have, at the earnest desire of <HI>one</HI> (whom I could not deny) been persuaded to gather up some pious remains of <HI>Mrs. Lydia Willis,</HI> whose memory is precious, so far as I have known, to all her acquaintance—peculiarly so to her beloved surviving husband, near relations and intimate friends, for whose use, more especially these pages are designed.</P>
<P><HI>Characters,</HI> I know, are oftentimes offensive; and many unkind reflections, are occasioned thereby, both on the living and the dead.—But why should any be offended at a <HI>character truly drawn</HI>? Why take offence, at a simple narrative of <HI>facts,</HI> or a true and faithful account of those virtues and good things, which evi∣dently took place and appeared, in the person's life! And this I take to be the main point, in giving a <HI>character,</HI> even to pay a sacred regard to <HI>truth</HI> in relat∣ing <HI>facts,</HI> or things that were really found, in the <HI>person</HI> described. And when all is said <HI>in truth,</HI> we mean not, thereby, to exalt and praise the <HI>man himself,</HI> but <HI>to glorify God in him.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, to excite the living to praise the giver of
<PB N="6" REF="021608_0005_0FB411350592F0E0"/>
every good and perfect gift, as well as to comfort and edify her surviving friends, I shall in simplicity of heart, give a sketch of <HI>Mrs. Willis</HI>'s Life and Character; more especially as it appears in her <HI>familiar letters,</HI> wherein the genuine breathings of her soul are the most sensibly discovered, perhaps, of any way in which her ideas were communicated.</P>
<P>Of <HI>these</HI> I have therefore selected a number, and giving the most of them at large, exactly as they were written with her own hand; except a grammatical defect hath, now and then, been supplyed. That her letters might appear in their native simplicity, I have not so much as corrected some <HI>inaccuracies,</HI> which a learned pen might have avoided.—The principal liberty that I have taken, is sometimes to <HI>exchange</HI> a <HI>word</HI> for <HI>some other,</HI> which is more expressive of what was evi∣dently her meaning! and the <HI>word</HI> that is <HI>substituted,</HI> may be known by inverted comma's before and after it, thus "—"</P>
<P>But some of her letters are wholly suppressed; and in those that appear, some stricking passages are omitted, on account of the singular <HI>amity</HI> and <HI>friendship,</HI> that subsisted between <HI>her</HI> and the <HI>living relative,</HI> to whom they were written; in whose hands she knew herself to be safe, tho' she wrote with the most unreserved freedom.</P>
<P>MRS. <HI>Lydia Willis,</HI> late virtuous Consort of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eliakim Willis,</HI> Pastor of the second Church of <HI>Malden,</HI> after ten days sickness, died there, much lamented, on the 25th of <HI>January,</HI> 1767, in the 59th year of her age.</P>
<P>She was born at <HI>Duxborough,</HI> April 1709, the only Daughter of Mr. <HI>Thomas Fish</HI> of that Town, deceased.</P>
<P>A Description of her person, (with some principal branches of her character) is aptly and truly drawn, by another hand, as entered at the close of this account.</P>
<P>And yet, to compleat the view of her person, there is
<PB N="7" REF="021608_0006_0FB4113685C3A988"/>
room to add, that she was of an eligible <HI>stature</HI> and <HI>proportion.</HI> Her <HI>visage</HI> comely especially in youth, nor wholly defac'd in age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It might have been said, she was so in age to an uncommon degree.</NOTE>—On her <HI>countenance</HI> dwelt a peculiar <HI>seriousness</HI> and <HI>pleasancy,</HI> so agreeably compos∣ed, as to demand respect, while it sensibly invited to nearness and freedom of converse.</P>
<P>As a grateful acknowledgement to the father of lights, it may be said, that under the influence of a careful and religious education, her youth was preserv∣ed from <HI>blemish.</HI> So that she entered the social life, in good repute among her companions.</P>
<P>An early taste for <HI>reading</HI> led her to acquaint her∣self, as opportunity favoured, with <HI>authors,</HI> polite as well as religious; the <HI>latter</HI> more especially, suited her attention.—This rendered her conversation edifying, while it agreeably entertained her discerning acquaint∣ance. So that she was favoured with the best society that her rural situation and the times afforded.</P>
<P>A good talent at <HI>writing</HI> gave her the advantage of a profitable correspondence; which many special provi∣dences occasioned her frequently to improve.—Her constitution (being of the most delicate &amp; tender make) subjected her to habitual weakness, and frequent dis∣tressing sicknesses; which, together with numerous other adverse providences, made her indeed a woman of sorrow and acquainted with grief.—She was a person of uncommon trials and afflictions, from her early days. Which, however, did not sink her spirits, but rather tended, for the most part, to wake up and invigorate every faculty, and manifest to others, rather than herself.</P>
<P>She abounded in love and tender affections, not only to her near relations, but to all mankind—A mind, susceptable of the deepest impressions, disposs'd her to joy and sorrow, in their turns, proportionable to every interesting event.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="021608_0007_0FB411380525EEA0"/>On such occasions, her letters are most expressive of what she felt.—But as crosses and afflictions were fami∣liar to her, even from her youth. These were, most frequently, the moving subjects, on which she wrote.— In a very low state of health, and under some peculiar trials, she writes, to her brother at Stonington, upon his <HI>marriage,</HI> and settlement there.</P>

<P>The next spring after this, she so far recovered her health, that she visited <HI>Stonington,</HI> where she spent the summer, very pleasantly, at her brothers, with growing endearments.—But this perhaps, served rather to en∣crease than abate her trials, when absent, upon return∣ing, bodily infirmities, and other sorrows.—Her affections, that were even too tender before, are now, with greater difficulty, kept under command.</P>

Madam <HI>Robinson,</HI> virtuous and amiable consort of Rev. Mr. <HI>John Robinson,</HI> (then Minister at <HI>Duxborough</HI>) and her daughter, were drowned at the same time. <HI>[She was the mother of the late governour Trumbull's lady of Connecticut, and one of the wives of the Rev. Jacob Eliot, of Lebanon, deceased; and of the wife of the late Rev. Abel Stiles of Woodstock.]</HI> The said Mr. <HI>Thomas Fish</HI> was educated at <HI>Cambridge-College,</HI> —took his degree, A. B. July <HI>1719;</HI> and just before his death was published to Mrs. <HI>Anne Turner,</HI> of <HI>Scituate,</HI> now the wife of Deacon <HI>Joseph Stockbridge,</HI> of Pembroke.</P>
<P>[This lady was a daughter of Col. Amos Turner, of Scituate. The God of Nature blessed her with a capacious mind, which she greatly improved by reading the best writers the age she lived in af∣forded; and by conversing with persons of the best taste in the circle in which she lived; especially the clergy who were most noted for their accomplishments. She rendered her husband one of the happiest of men, by her most sweet and engaging behaviour. The want of children was supplied by her most soft and endearing deportment. And though she had no children, she trained up those of others in such a manner, that they were ready to rise up and call her blessed.</P>
<P>She lived to an advanced age; and died in her <HI>84</HI>th year, in De∣cember, <HI>1782.</HI> She left the world as became a disciple of Jesus, though she left it with the most excruciating pains, as she died with a cancer in her breast: yet she did not reckon the sufferings of the present time worthy to be compared with the glories which were re∣vealed in her. How did she converse with a most intimate friend, who saw her but a few days before her death? Those who were not acquainted with her, knew not the happiness they lost; and those that were, were ready to cry out in the language of a divine writer, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord: henceforth they rest from their labours, and their works follow them.—And though she is dead, the life which she lived speaks to all. And may these lines recommend religion to her sex; and then she did not live in vain with respect to them, as she did not I trust with respect to herself.</P>
<P>But I shall add no more with respect to this once amiable lady—but that the leading strokes in the character of Madam Page, towards the close of this pamphlet, were applicable to her; and that she may be viewed in as amiable a light by the reader. The three ladies, whose characters have been attempted in some measure in these pages, ought ever to shine in this hemisphere, like three brilliant stars.]</P>

<P><HI>Two sons,</HI> so desirable, being taken away after the like affect∣ing manner, in their bloom, at the same time of life, about <HI>23</HI> years old, and neither of their bodies ever found, must needs fall uncom∣monly heavy upon their aged parents, whose other trials had brought them very low.—<HI>Deep called unto deep.</HI>—They mourned for their sons many days: and <HI>their grey hairs were brought down with sorrow to the grave.</HI></P></NOTE>—Do write the first opportu∣nity."</P>

<P>"Oh, I know not how to suppress the variety of passions, often felt by me, resulting from the thoughts of that "trying" separation, which "Providence" has destined me from such dear, enlivening, soul-edifying relatives.

<P>Having buried her <HI>father,</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> 1736, which gave her deep sorrow of heart, she had the trial of parting with her <HI>mother,</HI> in —, 1737.

But now the creature fails—her earthly props are gone,—<HI>father</HI> and <HI>mother forsake her</HI>; and there is none among crea∣tures, like minded, to take her up! Now, if no high∣er refuge opens to view, than what the earth and crea∣tures afford she must be even inconsolable.—How she should be provided for, supported; and enabled to perform the remaining stages of life? were questions naturally arising, but not easily answered; until the Lord appeared to relieve her troubled mind, by shew∣ing that the <HI>fountain</HI> remained, tho' the <HI>streams</HI> were dried up. This consolation was not entirely withheld from her, though she had not, speedily, the sensible benefit of it.</P>
<P>Under all the dark dispensations of Providence, imply'd and referred to, in the foregoing <HI>letters</HI> and account, she remained very much in the dark, as to her spiritual state.—Though the spirit and sentiments of her <HI>writings,</HI> accompanied with a <HI>life</HI> agreeable to the Gospel, might afford sufficient ground of charity to <HI>others,</HI> that the <HI>grace of God</HI> was with her, yet she had very little charity for <HI>herself</HI>; at least had not the comfort of knowing that God was <HI>hers,</HI> and that all these things were tokens of his love and faithfulness.—</P>
<P>But in the midst of darkness and trying afflictions; not late in life, while yet in a single state, she was, hopefully, led, more fully and clearly, to view and adore the hand that rules the world, and humbly to acquiesce in all his dealings with her.—She rose in some good measure, above the frowns and flatteries of human life,—made the Lord her refuge,—his holy re∣ligion her business, and conversing with him her chief∣est joy.</P>

<P>These afflictions, together with all that went before, were doubtless designed and happily improved for her soul's good.—Though after those terrible shocks, she seemed to be more silent, and, in a manner, laid aside her pen, for a season, yet when she wrote or conversed, she generally appeared to be more <HI>stablished, strengthen∣ed</HI> and <HI>settled.</HI></P>
<P>The little that she wrote to her friends, after so ma∣ny scenes of sorrow, and trying, but teaching provi∣dences, was, chiefly, by way of advice and excitement to the <HI>younger,</HI> and of condolence, sympathy and con∣solation to others, in the days of their affliction and distress.—An instance or two, of the like kind, has been already given, I shall add the following, as a specimen of the rest.</P>

<P>"THE tender sympathizing sense I have of the afflictive providence of God upon you, in the death of your dear and <HI>only babe,</HI> excites my poor at∣tempts to condole with you and to comfort you, under this heavy cross." You'll believe me if I tell you, "I know how to pity you, having drunk of the like bitter cup.—My bowels are troubled for you.—To <HI>such as are in affliction, pity should be shown.</HI> But oh! what can pitying <HI>friends</HI> do? How vain are <HI>their</HI> attempts to heal the keen anguish of the smarting rod? None but the hand that strikes, can cure the wound.—In <HI>Jesus</HI> there is strong consolation. Thither, dear souls, I would intreat your flight, for the sanctifying influen∣ces of his holy Spirit, without which you will certainly loose the benefit of the cross; which, I trust, is laid upon you for your eternal felicity—that your affections may be reduced from creature comforts,—from empty

<P>The last instance that we find, of such tender, sa∣voury breathings of soul, towards her friends in afflic∣tion and distress, is an unfinished letter to her brother at <HI>Stonington,</HI> as appears from an expression in it, ap∣plicable to none else, in that relation.—It is but a sketch of her sentiments, at a time when her affections were most tenderly moved, at the news of his <HI>youngest daughter's</HI> distressing sickness, of which there was but little hope of her surviving. It was found among her papers; but, probably, never compleated nor sent, or failed of coming to hand.—In a kind of tumult of ten∣der passions, she writes.</P>

<P>"It may be you feel the powerful band of parental ties, stronger than ever you knew before, if called to part with that lovely one, for whom you would e'en die. —Oh, methinks I hear, and see and feel the anguish of your groaning, bleeding, wounded souls, in such a gloomy hour.—But if this be the case, I am sure there is" full "consolation, in that sweet balmy covenant which," in "Jesus" is opened "for such as believe," and at such times as these.—Therefore, dear souls, rejoice in him, and give him back his own,—and bless a <HI>taking</HI>

as well as a giving God."—"Pray for your poor, unworthy sister, who are groaning under the burdens and sorrows of life, which infinite wisdom meets out to me, in various forms (too great to be expressed, tho' infinitely less than my deserts) that I may be strengthned with strength in my soul."</P>
<P>The dear <HI>relative</HI> above mentioned, recovered of <HI>that</HI> sickness, to which (it is supposed) the foregoing letter refers; and, not long after, was married [to Mr. <HI>Benjamin Douglass</HI>] with whom she lived in great amity, at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> about three years, and then died of the small-pox, December 8, 1766, in the 28th year of her age, to the inexpressible grief of her <HI>parents, husband</HI> and <HI>sister,</HI> and much lamented by all friends.—She was [allowed by all her intimate acquaintance, to be a truly amiable young woman, not only on account of the external beauties of her per∣son, but more especially for the sweet and obliging temper of her mind. Her very composition was <HI>love, tenderness</HI> and <HI>gene∣rosity.</HI>] —Remarkably patient in all her distressing sicknesses; and in her <HI>last</HI> was favoured with such discoveries of God, and found such trust in him, as abundantly satisfied her attendants and sor∣rowing friends that her hope of eternal life was founded in Gos∣pel evidences of a saving acquaintance with Christ.</P>
<P>In less than two months after her decease, Mrs. <HI>Willis</HI> depart∣ed this life, as above related; concerning whom it remains to be said, That her relish for divine things, and deep concern for the prevalence of true godliness in her own heart and life, may fur∣ther appear from some <HI>select passages,</HI> found among her private papers, after her death; which ('tis supposed) she met with in her reading, and penn'd for her own use; as what were pecu∣liarly agreeable to her sentiments, and which deeply impressed her mind.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="021608_0037_0FB41165C60609B8"/>They are as follows, viz.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>Providences are sometimes dark texts, that want an expositor.— God's providence fulfils his promise.—Without God's providence nothing falls out in the world.—Without his permission nothing stirs.—Without his blessing nothing prospers.</P>
<P>Afflictions are not so much <HI>threatened</HI> as <HI>promised</HI> to the chil∣dren of God.</P>
<P>To be a <HI>christian,</HI> and a <HI>suffering</HI> christian, is a double honour.</P>
<P>By affliction God separates the sin which he hates, from the soul which he loves.</P>
<P>An hard heart is not so easily broken, as a broken heart is bound up.</P>
<P>We must bear the warnings of the conscience, or we shall feel the woundings of conscience.</P>
<P>A word from God; a look from Christ; a touch from the Spirit, will break the heart.</P>
<P>To those that believe, (1) Christ is precious. (2) The word is sweet. (3) Sin is bitter. (4) Saints are dear. (5) Religion is their business. (6) The world is a broken idol. (7) Death is welcome.</P></Q>
<P>Reserving other parts of her life and character, to the hand that published them soon after her funeral (tho' some of them have been, unavoidably, touch'd in the foregoing account) I shall here only observe,</P>
<P>That her early profession of religion was followed with the exercises of devotion; and, abating humane imperfections, adorn'd with a conversation becoming the gospel. Her attendance, when able, was constant on public worship and ordinances of God's house, where her solemn deportment spoke the deep concern of her soul, to <HI>worship God in spirit and in truth.</HI>—The zeal which carried her up to the <HI>house</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> accom∣panied her back to <HI>her ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and spread itself through her ordinary conversation.—The <HI>godly</HI> were highest in
<PB N="39" REF="021608_0038_0FB4116744B8A9F8"/>
her esteem, with whom she delighted to converse upon the affairs of religion and the other world. Yet ever sociable and pleasant, delighting to make <HI>all</HI> about her happy.—Even on a bed of sickness and pain, which affected the hearts of her friends, she would conceal a measure of her own grief, and strive to chear their spirits, rather than increase their sorrows by uttering all her complaints. Her common treatment of those that visited her house, or fell in her way, (not excepting the injurious) discovered a heart full of friendship and loving kindness to all men. But her tenderness and dear affection to her <HI>relatives</HI> was almost singular; nor did it fail of suitable returns—As a <HI>daughter, sister, wife</HI> and <HI>mother,</HI> none more affectionate. The duties of each relation were considered as a <HI>privilege,</HI> not a <HI>task</HI>—done with so much pleasure and chearfulness, and (which could hardly fail) attended with such mutual endear∣ments, as made it not easy to say, whether she <HI>loved</HI> more than she was <HI>beloved.</HI>—As a mistress, provident and kind to her servants, ruling with moderation and gentleness, to make their yoke of servitude easy, and their burden light.—She guided the affairs of her house with discretion, generosity, carefulness and frugality appeared in all her domestic oeconomy.—Though pressed with infirmities of body, she greatly assisted her worthy partner in the instruction and education of tender <HI>youths,</HI> committed to their care (for which she had a singular faculty, and) in which exercise she closed her life.</P>
<P>When the time came that she must die, being ap∣prehensive that it was her last sickness, she seemed not terrified at the approach of death.—She that had long been deprived of health, and e'en cut off (in youth) from the hopes of that blessing.—She "that often received the sentence of death in herself, and viewed
<PB N="40" REF="021608_0039_0FB41168C4DAFB20"/>
the grave as gasping for her," met the summons, when she found it real, with much composure of mind.— Though under some clouds, and, in a measure, destitute of former manifestations, yet retained a firm reliance on the all perfect righteousness and merits of Christ for acceptance with God,—thirsting for him and the dis∣plays of his grace in that decisive hour.—At a lucid interval, from the force of her disease, which had now deeply affected the powers of her mind, she finished her work with this important and striking expression (in answer to a word that was spoken, concerning her going to join the angels and saints in their delightful work of praise) 'Tis not enough said she, "for me to glorify God in <HI>heaven</HI>; I long to glorify him on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and in death."</P>

<P>"But subjects of divinity chiefly engaged her attention, and es∣pecially such as were the most important and interesting.—Her fa∣vourite authors were those that placed the perfections of God, the grace of the gospel, and our absolute dependance upon God, through Christ, in the clearest light; and that gave the justest representation of our obligations, our duty and interest—and that afforded the best rules for self-examination, and the most powerful motives to chris∣tian practice.—<HI>Piety,</HI> which commenced in early life, was no small part of her character. She appeared jealous of herself, with a godly jealousy; and at times was concerned lest she should be mistaken in an affair of the greatest consequence; though at other times, a sight of the glory of God, in the face of Christ, removed the inquietudes of her mind; and the love of God shed abroad in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heart, cast out disquieting fear.</P>

<P>AT three o'clock this morning, departed this life, af∣ter a short illness of the bilious kind, Madam <HI>Sa∣rah Page,</HI> in the <HI>62</HI>d year of her age—the amiable relict of the late worthy Capt. <HI>Caleb Page,</HI> of this place.</P>
<P>This lady had weighed about three hundred weight.— Her stature was eligible—her visage comely. There was a beautiful symmetry in the features of her face; and her shape was neatly proportioned. Such was the majesty and natural elegance of her appearance, that the eye that saw her gave witness to her. <HI>Her eyes beamed such a lustre,</HI> as bespake the greatness of her mind: her outward form was lovely, her inward not less exact. The God of na∣ture had blessed her with a capacious mind, which she greatly improved by reading (or having read to her by her friends, while she laid her hand to the spindle, and her hand held the distaff) some of the best writers in po∣lemical and practical divinity; for which she had a taste, as well as for the belles-letters, and would make the most judicious remarks upon the beauties of the author. She was religious without the least tincture of <HI>enthusiasm</HI> or <HI>superstition,</HI> and never thought religion consisted in <HI>grim∣mace.</HI> Her invention was sprightly, her wit ready, and of the keenest and most brilliant kind—her temper firm and agreeable—her judgment sound beyond what was common to her sex. She had a mind formed for friendship, and was capable of giving counsel and advice. She despised all low cunning, <HI>in which some little creatures pride themselves.</HI> She never said one thing, when she meant another, which rendered her a most endearing friend; <HI>and would never forsake her friend in the day of adver∣sity;</HI>

and nothing but the basest ingratitude could wean her affections, where she had once placed them, though some beasts in human shape may be so base sometimes as to give occasion for it, especially if they are of the crocodile kind. Such creatures are aptly described in the follow∣ing lines:
<Q><L>Such brutes shall with disgrace be cloath'd,</L>
<L>In spite of all their pride:</L>
<L>Their own confusion like a cloak,</L>
<L>The guilty wretches hide.</L></Q></P>
<P>Her liberality if not boundless, was most extensive. The poor and needy were her care, and the distressed of every kind. Of this, she has left a witness in the breasts of hundreds if not thousands. She was peculiarly fitted for the social life. <HI>Her husband was known in the gates, when he sat among the elders of the land; and his heart ever trusted safely in her.</HI> And though her children could not rise up and call her blessed (as she never had any); yet, num∣bers whom she trained up, if they have any minds, will do it (and if any <HI>one</HI> was without a mind, she was not to blame for that); for she opened her mouth with wisdom, and in her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was the law of kindness. She look∣ed well to the ways of her houshold, and eat not the bread of idleness.—How entertaining! how instructive! was her conversation! How pleasing! how striking was her smile! She was formed for the sweets of life: Her mind was finished for delight! Many daughters have done virtuously; but her price was far above rubies.</P>
<P>But though she has left her friends in tears, and some to sigh the inward pain in silence, I trust she is gone to a more exalted hemisphere, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> even the world that knew her to lament their lost, as every one that has true discernment will, and will labour to follow her to that glorious world, of which at present we are not capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adequate ideas; for eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enter into the heart of mortals to
<PB N="45" REF="021608_0044_0FB4117045605BA8"/>
conceive of those glories which are laid up for such angelic forms. If they shone here, what will they do hereafter.
<Q><L>Ah! where's that lovely form, whose brightest eyes</L>
<L>Look'd like the morn, and shone like as the skies;</L>
<L>Fair as the moon, reflecting silver light,</L>
<L>Strong as the golden sun, and beamy bright.</L>
<L>Wrapt in the image of a pleasing sleep,</L>
<L>No more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hear her sigh, nor see her weep.</L>
<L>She shone like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>straea, while here below;</L>
<L>And now, in realms above, she's like her too.</L>
<L>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sweets which feed the thyme bee,</L>
<L>Madam, thou lovely Page, were found in thee.</L>
<L>The beauties of thy sex were found in one:</L>
<L>Thou wast a magazine of charms alone.</L>
<L>That lovely form is mouldering in the grave,</L>
<L>Where lies alike, the Princess and the slave.</L>
<L>Dead, no—she's gone her virtues to display,</L>
<L>In the bright regions of eternal day.</L>
<L>There "springs of endless joy are breaking forth!</L>
<L>There buds the promise of celestial worth,</L>
<L>Worth which must ripen in an happier clime,</L>
<L>And brighter sun beyond the bounds of time."</L></Q>
When I see some little flirts, how great the contrast! Yet I adore (it is not meant with divine worship) a female mind that is great, though it be contained within a little casket.</P>
<P>How uncommon soever the above character may appear in any age, especially in the present one, it is not exagge∣rated, verbum sacerdotis.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> upon the word of a priest. In drawing this imper¦fect character, care was taken to prevent adulation, which ever lessens the credence of real worth. For the truth of the charac∣ter, an appeal is made to the sensible part of her acquaintance.— When this character was once read to a clergyman's lady, she replied with an air, which discovered she thought it exceeded due bounds. The reverend divine, her husband, told her he knew the woman while she lived, and it was a just character: And if so, it must have been drawn from the life.
<L>I scorn to paint female furies' passions,</L>
<L>Which rise to heav'n, and put out all the stars.</L>
<L>Let me the softer, more angelick forms</L>
<L>Describe, in the smooth Watts's softest strains.</L>
<L>I wish the females not void of passion,</L>
<L>Nor void of sense—may reason ever rule.</L></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="021608_0045_0FB41171C4EDEAC8"/>When I consider a person of such distinguished merit ta∣ken off the stage before she had arrived at the age allotted for human life, and see others spared, from whose minds an idea did never shoot, and perhaps never will; I am ready to exclaim, in the language of Portius,
<Q><L>The ways of Heaven are dark and intricate.</L>
<L>Puzzled in mazes, and perplex'd with errors,</L>
<L>Our understanding traces them in vain,</L>
<L>Lost and bewilder'd in the fruitless search;</L>
<L>Nor sees with how much art the windings run,</L>
<L>Nor where the regular confusion ends.</L></Q></P>
<P>N. B. Shall not the character of so amiable a person be spread as far as pen and types can do it, through the American States? Ye brethren of the type, waft her name down to posterity; and by doing of it, you will im∣mortalize your own, as some of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> poets have done by celebrating their goddesses. The name of an <HI>Abigail,</HI> a <HI>Judith,</HI> and a <HI>Dorcas,</HI> or a <HI>Tabitha,</HI> with many others, must go to make up her character.—But I shall add no more, lest it should be suspected, though I fall short, that I grow wanton in her praise.</P>
<P>The female reader is desired, before she gives the pamph∣let a second reading, to impress her mind with the follow∣ing lines, that she may make the characters her own; and then it will be seen she did not read in vain:
<Q><L>Let all be hush'd, each softest motion cease;</L>
<L>Be ev'ry loud tumultuous thought at peace;</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="021608_0046_0FB4117406506CB0"/>And ev'ry ruder gasp of breath</L>
<L>Be calm, as in the arms of death:</L>
<L>And thou most fickle, most uneasy part,</L>
<L>Thou restless wanderer, my heart,</L>
<L>Be still; gently, ah! gently leave,</L>
<L>Thou busy, idle thing, to leave.</L>
<L>Stir not a pulse; and let my blood,</L>
<L>That turbulent, unruly flood,</L>
<L>Be softly staid;</L>
<L>Let me be all, but my attention dead.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Editor wishes his pains may not be lost; but that the young ladies' minds of the present age, may be so warm∣ed by such bright examples, that they may shine through life like the morning and the evening star in her courses. How glorious then will they appear, when the beauties of their minds may be viewed without a telescope. Then, should they set in our hemisphere in early life, they will rise in a brighter, and shine like the famed Narcissa who expired in Newhampshire the last spring, and left her Philemon and the world to lament their loss.</P>
