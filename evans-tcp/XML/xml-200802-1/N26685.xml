<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT is thought necessary to inform the Reader that a sermon preceded this, from Matthew</HI> xvi. 27. For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his holy Angels, and then shall he reward every man according to his works.—<HI>In this discourse, the particular object was to shew, that all our conduct, in every relation in life, will peculiarly interest and concern us, at the final Judgment. The relation between Ministers and their People, was particularly considered; the object of the Head of the Church in the appointment of them; their accountableness to Him, in the discharge of their office; the obligation of the People to attend to the true Ministers of Christ; and that Christ now views, and will, at the day of Judgment, treat the con∣duct of People toward faithful Ministers, as conduct toward himself, agreeably to his own declaration, "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me; and he that dispiseth you, dispiseth me; and he that dispiseth me, dispiseth him that sent me: He that will not re∣ceive you, nor hear your word, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the day of Judgment, than for him." These sketches are gi∣ven, because reference is had to this discourse in the Addresses in the following Sermon, and in other parts of it also, as will be seen by the reader.</HI></P>

<P>THE Author hath no expectation that this Sermon will affect the minds of Readers as it did those who heard it, as that was a peculiar oc∣casion. His apology for allowing it to be pub∣lished, is, that a number of the hearers wished to have it in their houses. It is hoped it will be of no disservice to any, and that candor will be ex∣ercised by the reader.</P>

<Q><HI>Finally, brethren, farewell; be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apostle Paul, in the course of his tra∣vels, came to Corinth, and there he preach∣ed the gospel about six years before he wrote this last epistle to them. At that time he tarried among them about a year and an half. During this visit, many who heard him, believed, and turned from their idols to the service of the true God, and embraced the glorious gospel of his Son: The happy effects of his ministry among them through the blessing of God, greatly endear∣ed them to each other. After having been ab∣sent from them about five years, and having in this time heard of things in their conduct contrary to the spirit of the Gospel, and being likewise requested by them in a letter to him, to answer some particular questions; he embraces an opportunity amidst all his oth∣er cares, to write to them, with a manifest de∣sign to correct their errors, to lead them further into the knowlege of true christianity, and to an∣swer their questions. The next year he wrote them this most feeling and spiritual epistle which
<PB N="6" REF="035495_0005_1004E0500ECE4498"/>
contains our text: these two epistles contain more than he wrote to any other church. It appears that the church at Corinth was peculiarly on the mind of the apostle, and that he had spent much time and care for them; but in this epistle he closes his services among them, and takes his leave.</P>
<P>Tho the church at Corinth, in general, highly esteemed the apostle, yet he had his enemies; who, tho they acknowleged him great and pow∣erful in reasoning, yet disliked his personal ap∣pearance, and to whom his speech was contemp∣ible, as appears from this epistle. It is evident that this church had some members unfriendly to the doctrines, the spirit, and practice of the gos∣pel; for the apostle charges them with being guil∣ty of such fornication, as far exceeded what was even named among the gentiles; that one should have his father's wife—that they were also carnal, selfish, and contentious; that one was for Paul, another for Apollos, &amp;c. all which proved them destitute of the spirit of the gospel. Their con∣duct <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sacrament was much to the dishonor of the gospel, and inconsistent not only with he sobriety and purity of the christian religion and its holy and solemn institutions, but even contra∣ry to common decency, that one should be hun∣gry, and another drunken, at this religious so∣lemnity.</P>
<P>One reason why there were so many insincere professors at Corinth, while the gospel was gener∣ally unpopular, may probably be, that Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed, and all his house, and also one Gous; these, and other im∣portant
<PB N="7" REF="035495_0006_1004E051D6796330"/>
characters rendered it popular to profess christianity at Corinth, tho it was not the case in other places.</P>
<P>It was in vain for these enemies of Paul, pub∣licly to oppose his doctrines, or to impeach his moral character: they must then use such wea∣pons against him as they could find. In seeking for objections, nothing could be found for open attack, but the meer defects of nature. He was not a man of a stately and commanding visage, nor a good speaker. His letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. Such public clamor is often popular with the unstable, irreli∣gious, and inconsiderate part of mankind; and is frequently a stronger objection against a minister, in the mind of many, than herecy, or immorality; for neither of the latter are so contrary to the un∣sanctified heart. Though this clamor might tend to hinder the success of the gospel at Corinth; yet it did not alter the opinions and feelings of the really religious and discerning christians, con∣cerning the apostle. They considered such ob∣jections as groundless cavils, and the fruits of an unfriendly mind to the gospel of Christ.</P>
<P>Whether these or other reasons operated to prevent the apostle from further particular atten∣tion, care, and labor among the Corinthians, does not appear. It is evident he lived, at least, a∣bout six years after he wrote this last epistle, as a laborer in the vineyard of Christ.</P>
<P>Whatever might be his reasons, it is clear he felt himself warranted in ceasing his particular attention to them; and therefore in the close of
<PB N="8" REF="035495_0007_1004E056C34C19D8"/>
this epistle, and particularly in the words of our text, he takes leave of them. It appears from his epistles, that he dearly and tenderly regarded the real friends of Jesus; and tho he despised the cavils of these false professors, yet he wished their good, and sincerely pitied those who might, in∣cautiously, be ruined by their means.</P>
<P>Far would I be from comparing myself with this great apostle, as a man inspired, or as being his equal, in natural abilities or real graces; but in unequal characters, there may be some like∣ness in circumstantial things. How far the suc∣cess the apostle in the beginning of his preach∣ing at Corinth and some things which happened after, and have now been mentioned, may com∣pare with what hath taken place among us since my settlement among this people, I shall leave to the judgment of the candid, and acquainted.</P>
<P>In the words of our text the apostle expresses his good will and sincere desire for the prosperity of that church, which, under God, he had labor∣ed to erect, and build up on the plan of the gos∣pel.</P>
<P>We are not to suppose the apostle intended by this phrase a mere parting compliment without much meaning, as at this day is become custom∣ary: to shew his meaning and real desire that they might fare well in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sense, he not on∣ly joins with it the friendly term of brethren, but also exhibits before them the way to farewell in the highest degree possible. As the way to this felicity he exhorteth them to be perfect, to be of good comfort, to be of one mind, and to live in peace; with this assurance, that in so doing, the
<PB N="9" REF="035495_0008_1004E05B9ED1BD70"/>
God of love and peace, the infinite fountain of good, would be with them.</P>
<P>Perfection intends holiness of heart, and of life, and a strict and constant walk with God, accord∣ing to the command of the glorious gospel.</P>
<P>To be of good comfort, is not to sink, and be disheartened at the dark and gloomy scenes which might happen; but in the exercise of true holi∣ness and vital piety to God, and benevolence to men; they should place their hope, their trust, and confidence, in the all powerful care and pro∣tection of that God, who is ever mindful of them that rely on him, that they should be comforted. In a view of God's constant care of his cause, and of his people, and the unfailing intercession and wise government of Jesus Christ, who is head over all things to his church; and who is able to de∣feat all the devices of the enemies of his people, and to give them a glorious and compleat victory at last, who trust in him for salvation; that look∣ing unto Jesus the great captain of salvation, and the mighty conqueror, they might be sure of vic∣tory at last, however dark and critical their pre∣sent circumstances might appear.</P>
<P>He further recommends to them union and oneness of mind, both in faith and practice, tow∣ard God and men; that they should be united in the faith and fellow-ship of the gospel; that they might not be rent by divisions and dissen∣tions, and so be exposed to the ravages of the en∣emies of God, and of his people; but that they should be united in love to God, and possess the fellow-ship of the spirit; as union in the truth, is the great bulwork of the church against the in∣roads
<PB N="10" REF="035495_0009_1004E05D240DBC80"/>
of the adversary. He exhorts them there∣fore to lay aside contention, to study and seek for peace and love in the truth, by all proper condescention one to the other, which could be consistent with the religion of the benevolent gos∣pel, of the meek, the lowly and condescending Jesus; that they should ever shun and guard a∣gainst an inclination too common among profess∣ing christians to disagree; that they should be a∣greed in every thing, in faith and practice, and so escape contention, and party opinion, and par∣ty zeal; that in lowliness, in humbleness of mind, in charity, and tenderness towards each other, and the truth, they should seek to know the will of God, and the path of duty, and in this way strive together for the promotion of the glory of God, the good of his kingdom, and the mutual benefit of each other, and the good of the whole body; and that they might all be one in Christ, and be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment, and become one body in Christ the glorious head of all principality and power.</P>
<P>In this way he assures them that they might ex∣pect to be unconquerable, by any of the arts and devices of the adversary, and might expect that their united prayers would constantly ascend to heaven with full acceptance; and that God by his spirit would continually dwell in and among them, and that he would be as a wall of fire round about them, and the glory in the midst of them.</P>
<P>In these directions the apostle comprises all religion, both of faith and practice, in a most feeling manner; and also the sum of blessedness
<PB N="11" REF="035495_0010_1004E05EC22B7738"/>
that shall attend it; and this was of high import∣ance to the church at Corinth, considering their danger, both from some of their own body, who appeared evidently not to be real friends to the doctrines and duties of the gospel, and also from a frowning world around them; and I may add, that it was especially needful to them, as they were now to be denied the aid of that great apos∣tle for their guide.</P>
<P>But it is proper that we come to a more parti∣cular application of what has been said this day, and especially on the particular occasion and cir∣cumstances of Myself, and the Church and Peo∣ple in this Society.</P>
<P>In this place, allow me to refresh your minds with a very brief recital of some things, which have taken place in the course of my ministry:—You will then recollect, that fourteen years last January, I was, in compliance with the unani∣mous voice and desire of this church and society, solemnly set apart, and took upon me the care and charge of them as their Pastor. At this time it was at least implied, that we solemnly engaged, before our God, to discharge the duties of a Mi∣nister and People in the fear of God, and as those who must give account, before his Bar, at the Great Day.</P>
<P>We then began that important relation, exhi∣bited in the forenoon, and which must occasion us a most solemn meeting at the Tribunal of God, in the presence of an assembled universe, to ac∣count to him for the discharge of our duty, in this relation.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035495_0011_1004E063AABCCBC0"/>
Soon after these mutual engagements, it pleas∣ed God of his infinite kindness to pour upon us his spirit, to call up the attention of many secure sinners, and hopefully to bring home a number of souls to the knowlege and acknowlegement of the truth; joy filled the hearts of the friends of God among us.</P>
<P>At this time I found it easy, tho very labori∣ous, to discharge the duties of the ministry. Of this delightful and happy time for nearly two years, many here present are living witnesses.</P>
<P>At the decline of these joyful and laborious days, to me, another and very different scene commenced; and tho it lessened my calls for fre∣quent preaching, public conferences, and private instructions of a spiritual kind; yet it was a far more troublesome and difficult task to do my du∣ty, to my own satisfaction, and that of the people, than the other. This troubled my mind, it sunk and disheartened my spirits. Tho the matters first agitated were mostly small in themselves, yet they manifestly led to those which were material.</P>
<P>I was much discouraged when I found we could not think alike in those matters; and more espe∣cially was this the case with me, after repeatedly urging for a mutual council, which was utterly rejected; for this I supposed, and still conceive, was the only way to compose our difficulties; and such a council, I am now persuaded, would soon have convinced us of our duty, and pointed out the path in which we might have gone in peace and harmony to this day.</P>
<P>In a view of these matters, at their first begin∣ing, I think the word of St. James may well be
<PB N="13" REF="035495_0012_1004E06656EBFB20"/>
applied: "Behold what a matter a little fire kindleth."</P>
<P>In a view of the difficulties attending a dis∣charge of my duty as a minister for eight years past, (in my private meditations) I have often had the subject of the forenoon; the judgment of the great day croud itself forcibly on my mind, with regard to myself and you my brethren and hear∣ers, and have been frequently led to think, whe∣ther it was not much to be desired that our so∣lemn relation to each other (tho vastly impor∣tant in its nature) should be dissolved. This hath once and again induced me to bring this subject before this church and society.</P>
<P>But God's time is always the best.</P>
<P>Providence has now brought the event to pass, but not without our exertions; and probably, not without great blame to some, if not the most of us.</P>
<P>I am far from claiming perfection to myself; nor did I ever pretend to be a christian of high attainments in grace or holiness; tho for thirty-six years, I have had an hope that I had passed the new birth; and tho I have ever hoped, yet I have often feared. I feel that I depend on the sovereign mercy and grace of God, in Christ, and on the holy Spirit, to carry on and compleat in me, that which I hope is begun. This is all my expectation of a glorious immortality.</P>
<P>I can freely say, that in my days of trouble, I have on some occasions been more disturbed and agitated in mind, than my cooler judgment after∣wards dictated. I think, however, I can with truth say, I have not wished nor sought real evil
<PB N="14" REF="035495_0013_1004E067DBCA5D58"/>
to this people, nor to an individual; but rather their best, their eternal good.</P>
<P>I must say also, that in my hours of reflection, on matters that have passed, I have not been con∣vinced, of having taken the wrong side of the subject.</P>
<P>I think it my duty, further, to say on this oc∣casion, that the doctrines and duties I have taught you, my brethren and friends, are those by which we must stand or fall before our Judge at the great day; at which time let us remember we must have a most solemn meeting: and O that God of his infinite mercy would grant, that it may be joyful to us all, through his spirit and grace attending us, in our future lives, and by the glo∣rious atonement of his Son the Judge.</P>
<P>At your request I have resigned that sacred charge and care of your souls, which once I took upon me, by your unanimous desire; supposing this choice of yours, and the decision of a mutu∣al council, render it proper and justifiable before my God.</P>
<P>It being your request that I should in this pub∣lic way take my leave of you, allow me to close by a few addresses; the first of which will be to this church:</P>
<P><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When first I took the pastoral charge of this Church, the whole number was twenty-nine. The most of those who were the founders and pil∣lars of this Church, now sleep in dust. In the course of my ministry, ninety-three have been added; and a large number of these, have ob∣tained
<PB N="15" REF="035495_0014_1004E06977081E98"/>
an hope of renewing grace, under my mi∣nistry. These have in time past acknowleged me (under God) their spiritual father and guide. Whatever may be their present feelings with res∣pect to me, if they are not deceived in their hope, I <HI>trust</HI> they will again acknowledge me at the great day, and that I shall yet have them by their free consent as seals of my ministry, and crowns of my rejoicing before God.</P>
<P>As I leave you, at your own choice, it is na∣tural to suppose you esteem it a privilege, and not a loss. That it is to the promotion of your good that this should take place, you cannot therefore expect that I shall have that peculiar anxiety for you on this event, as if you considered it to your injury, or if it had happened contrary to your minds. If any should consider this as an occa∣sion of rejoicing, I would not wish unnecessarily to disturb their feelings; Yet in faithfulness to God, and your souls, and to the good of Christ's kingdom among you, in future, I think it my du∣ty to tell you, you are as sheep without a shep∣herd; and if it be better than while I was your pastor, yet it is still a dangerous state, and hath ever been found to be such, in every age of the church, and is considered such by the great Head of the church; and an insensibility of it greatly increaseth the danger. If you would support the character of a real Church of the Glorious Re∣deemer, let me tell you, your troubles are not likely to end this day. I think myself so well ac∣quainted with the state of this Church, and the re∣ligious state of our land, as to foresee you are in danger from every quarter. Within, you are
<PB N="16" REF="035495_0015_1004E06E5E929578"/>
exposed by at least the remains of an evil heart, by which means, when you would do good, evil will be present with you. Want of a thorough knowlege of the path of duty may also expose you to go astray. A subtle adversary who will appear in almost every shape will beset you: at times he will appear as an angel of light, full of love and zeal for religion, with some fatal error under a secret cover: at other times he will bold∣ly attack some essential and fundamental truth, to which, for want of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to defend, many of you may fall a prey.</P>
<P>I must, to be faithful, tell you that many false teachers, flatterers, corruptors of the word of God, and men pleasers, are gone out into the world, of whom let me beseech you, beware; for in your destitute state, you will be apt to be in∣fested with these intruders.</P>
<P>Let me then, my brethren, recommend to you the holy Scriptures for your constant guide; and intreat you earnestly and sincerely, to look to the great head of the church for his spirit to lead you into a clear discernment and true understand∣ing of his holy word, and that he would prepare your hearts, readily and constantly, to keep and do all things which he hath commanded: com∣mit yourselves, as individuals and as a church, to God's holy and constant assistance and direc∣tion; implore his constant presence and care over you, and lean not to your own understanding and sufficiency. You need to be constantly on your guard, and much on your knees, before God, for his constant protection, to secure you from the errors and mischiefs to which you are
<PB N="17" REF="035495_0016_1004E06FE2F53BE8"/>
exposed, in this evil day, and that it may please the lord of the harvest, to send you a pastor after his own heart, and that one of an opposite cha∣racter may not be imposed on you. In a word, take the direction of the great apostle to the Co∣rinthians, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and may the God of Love and Peace be with you: and when the chief Shepherd shall appear, may we meet our glorious Lord and final Judge with acceptance. Finally, brethren, Farewell.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends, once the People of my Charge.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As you have made no public prefession of real religion, I trust you will not be offended if I should in this address speak to you as imperti∣nent, and as having no special interest at present in the salvation of the gospel. Many of you have been particularly kind to me; from whom I have received many favors, and for whom I have ever had, and still have, a very tender regard.</P>
<P>I am now to take my leave of you as your guide in your spiritual and eternal concerns. It sensibly affects me on this occasion, that my past labours have, to appearance, been without saving benefit to your precious and immortal souls; that after all, I must leave you as I found you, with regard to your eternal salvation. With respect to some of you, according to the course of na∣ture, your glass is almost run; only a few scatter∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="035495_0017_1004E071AD3643B8"/>
and doubtful sands remain. That I must leave you is decided: but how shall I leave you thus? how can I take my leave of you in this your condition; to meet you hereafter, O dread∣ful thought! on the left hand of the final Judge? to have those truths which you have heard from me, bear witness against you at the great tribunal! O my friends, think on the scenes before you; think on your present condition, and on that of your families, your dear children, whose preci∣ous and immortal souls, as well as your own, should be your special care. Think on your present state, as sinners, and the subject of the endless curse of God's law. Think on the glori∣ous gospel, which brings salvation to every true penitent. Think on the short and uncertain time of your probation and opportunity of obtaining pardon, and the favor of God by Jesus Christ. Realize the final judgment to yourselves, and the eternity to follow. Let these subjects ever be al∣lowed a place in your minds, and in your hearts. I may—I am allowed this once, as the last time, to warn and invite you to be reconciled to God by Jesus Christ: "Behold then to day, after so long time, as it is said, to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts." Now then my friends, let religion be your great, your chief con∣cern, in what of your lives remain, that so our meeting at last, before the tribunal of our final Judge, may be joyful and happy. Realize the religion of the closet, the family, and the house of God. Remember that without repentance you will die in your sins, though I should be found to have been unfaithful as a watchman;
<PB N="19" REF="035495_0018_1004E0734DD66B60"/>
and let me add, that I am confident the way I have endeavored to point out, and urge your compliance with, is that which at the great day of God, you will find, the only way of acceptance before his throne. In a view of these truths, and your duty, and in expectation of a most solemn meeting with you at the great tribunal, and hav∣ing no longer a right, as your pastor, to urge these things upon you, and it being your voice that it should be thus, I bid you, in this relation, a final Farewell.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY YOUNG FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Travellers to judgment and eternity, hear and receive the last address of him who wishes the salvation of your immortal souls. Many have been my hours of sorrow at your apparent un∣concern for religion, and your own eternal state. Will you say I have not faithfully taught and warned you? In reply let me ask you to reflect on what I have taught you from this sacred desk. Let conscience answer. Is it through my negli∣gence or yours, that you have no clearer view of God and Divine things on your minds, and no more concern for his honor and the salvation of your souls? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the doctrines and duties I have taught, such as the holy scriptures <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>? and have they not been urged upon you as things of the highest concern? Hath my life and con∣versation justly led you to conceive religion of no importance to mankind? Or have I, in the
<PB N="20" REF="035495_0019_1004E07834AE7B10"/>
course of my ministry, been peculiarly inatten∣tive to the young? If this be the opinion of any, let me inform you, that my sermons, if examined, will shew, that the youth have been often parti∣cularly addressed on the important concerns of religion and their souls. A meeting also for the purpose of instructing the youth, particularly in religion, was instituted soon after my settlement, which proved very useful to many, and was con∣tinued until it was neglected or mis-improved, so as to he thought, both by myself and others, best it should be discontinued. I mention these things in a brief manner, to shew you that the youth have not been forgotten by me.</P>
<P>As, my young friends, you are considered in favor of my dismission, and as being dissuited with me; if this be the case with any, or all of you, let me seriously ask you, and let conscience give the answer—Is it not the doctrines I teach, and the self-denying duties of the gospel, and the restraints these lay on sensual pleasures, that have rendered me unpopular to you? Is it not a de∣sire for smooth things, and an easier way to sal∣vation, that have determined your choice in this matter; and would not these objections lead your minds in choosing another pastor? If this be true, let me sincerely pity you, and pray God in infinite mercy to your souls, to disappoint your wishes: for let me assure you in this my last ad∣dress to you, that if ever you find mercy before God, it will be by believing and obeying that gospel I have preached unto you. I can freely forgive all disrespect to myself; but in duty to God, and to your best good, I must tell you God
<PB N="21" REF="035495_0020_1004E07C063A0650"/>
will not forgive your sins and impenitence toward him, except you repent and believe the gospel. My young friends, my heart's desire and prayer to God for you hath been, still is, and I trust will be, that you may be saved. The little prospects of success among a people when divisions exist, and especially when the minister is the object of contention, has at times probably retarded my exertions for the promotion of religion among you, to a fault. It is my sincere wish that you may be earnestly desirous of knowledge both hu∣man and divine, and that you may obtain this object, that you may also be sanctified by the Holy Ghost; that you may indeed love God, and his glory, and the good of mankind; that when you come upon the stage of action, and your fathers shall be no more, your natural and moral virtues may be such, and such your bene∣volence, that you may begin that golden age pre∣dicted in holy writ concerning our disordered and confused world; that your lives may be ho∣ly and happy, your death's comfortable, your re∣surrection and judgment joyful, and your im∣mortality glorious. Tho I now quit my minis∣terial concerns with you for this world, yet let us remember this is not our last meeting, nor the last concerning the things which have happened since my settlement among this people: nor will you be idle spectators at this scene. You must account to God how you have heard and im∣proved your warnings; and the reasons must then be known why you have not repented, and believed the gospel. My young friends, it is a good day for you to prepare for eternity; it is a
<PB N="22" REF="035495_0021_1004E07EC26F17B8"/>
day of great mercy with God, for enquiring sin∣ners. Then be persuaded to know the things which belong to your peace. It is a day of en∣quiring, of trembling, and seeking for mercy, and of obtaining in many places, with children and youth. Were such here present, and had opportunity, they would tenderly invite you to come and see their glorious Lord, whose conso∣lations transcend every joy they ever had before, or that this world can afford. Finally, my youth∣ful friends, let me earnestly beseech you to pre∣pare for our last and solemn meeting at the glori∣ous and awful tribunal of our final Judge. Fare∣well.</P>
<P>I must not forget the children of this society on this solemn occasion. As a testimony of my sincere good will and concern for your best good, and as it is perhaps the last opportunity of pro∣moting your future happiness, let me tell you, though you are now young, yet you must soon die, and come to judgment. It becometh you to love and be kind one to the other; to love and obey your parents, and above all to love your God and Savior; early learn to know and to do his will. Though I may never speak to you on these subjects again in this world, yet re∣member you will see me at the judgment day, when before God, angels, and all men, you must be reminded of what I have now, and what I have heretofore said in your hearing, on your duty to God, your parents, and to all people. And now bear it hereafter always on your mind, that you must be condemned before the bar of
<PB N="23" REF="035495_0022_1004E0809433A568"/>
God at the great day, if you neglect these duties and obey not the gospel of the Son of God. My little children, Farewell.</P>

<P>Finally, my friends and brethren, the people with whom I have labored in the gospel these fourteen years, we are now to part. The world is wide in which we live; we cannot say where Providence may place us in future; God only knows the scenes and changes we have yet to pass. Let us bear on our minds the present oc∣casion with its future concern and importance to us; and let us be ready for death at the sum∣mons; be prepared for the sounding trumpet that shall awake us at the final Judgment. May God Almighty bless us in future with his spirit and presence, wherever we may be placed on this entensive globe. May he send you the blessing of a pastor after his own heart, who shall be faithful to God, and your souls; and may you, my hearers, be ready to receive and im∣prove him to the everlasting good of your souls; and may you be perfect, of good comfort, of one mind, and live in peace; and may the God of love and peace be with you always—Farewell. Let me repeat it as my sincere wish for you all—FAREWELL.</P>

<P>Mr. Wildman was chosen moderator, and Mr. Hart scribe.</P>
<P>The Council was opened with Prayer by the moderator.</P>
<P>VOTES both of the Church and Society, respecting the Dismission of the Rev. Mr. Fowler from his Pastoral relation to them; were presented and read. Mr. Fowler, and a Commit∣tee from the Church and Society, signified their desire, that considering the present dissatisfaction among this People, said relation should be dissolved. It appeared to be the wish of both Church and Society, that if the Relation between them and Mr. Fowler be dissolved; he should be dismissed in character, as against him, they have nothing to alledge either Heretical or Scandalous.</P>
<P>The Council having taken the matter into serious and deli∣berate consideration—</P>
<P>Voted unanimously—</P>
<P><PB REF="035495_0024_1004E087461AF918"/>
That under the present disagreeable circumstances of this Church and Society, it appears expedient, that the partial rela∣tion between Mr. Fowler and the Church and Society in this place be dissolved. They do therefore advise that said Relation be dissolved; and it is accordingly Dissolved.</P>
<P>While we esteem it necessary to form this result; we feel deeply affected that a Minister whom we believe to have been a faithful, prudent Preacher of the Gospel, should be reduced to such unhappy circumstances as render it needful for him to be dismissed from his labors in this part of Christ's vinyard. At the same time, we rejoice that the Votes of both Church and Society fully clear the Character of Mr. Fowler from any im∣peachment of misconduct; and desire him to be dismissed as a regular Minister of Christ. This desire being perfectly accor∣dant with our own opinions and feelings; we do cheerfully and cordially Recommend Him to the Churches wherever God in his Providence shall call him; as a sound; faithful and pious Minister of the Gospel.</P>
<P>We lament the unhappy circumstances of this Church and So∣ciety which have led them to <HI>desire;</HI> and Mr. Fowler to con∣sent to his dismission. We earnestly pray the great Head of the Church to unite this Church. A Society; to raise up for them a faithful Minister of the Gospel to improve the future labors of Mr. Fowler as a blessing to the Churches; to cause harmany and love to abound among this people and finally that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People and their Pastor may have a joyful meeting at the right hand of their common Lord.</P>
