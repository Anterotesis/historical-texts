<HEAD>The Lawfulness of War, AND The Proof of Arms.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>I Sam. XVII. 39.</HI></BIBL>
<P>—And <HI>DAVID</HI> said unto <HI>SAUL,</HI> I cannot go with These▪ For I have not proved Them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Armies of the <HI>Philistines</HI> were now gathered together in the Coast of <HI>Dammim,</HI> and pitched between <HI>Sho∣choh</HI> and <HI>Azekah,</HI> a Place belonging to <HI>Judah</HI>: And, in order to oppose them, SAUL and the Men of <HI>Israel</HI> were gathered together also and pitched by the Val∣ley of <HI>Elah</HI> and had set the Battle in Array against them: The former Army stood on a Mountain on one side; and the latter stood on a Mountain on the other; so that there was only a Valley between them.</P>
<P>Behold now a <HI>Champion marches out of the Camp of the</HI> Philistines, named GOLIATH, who was of enor∣mous Size and formidable Appearance: He comes in
<PB N="6" REF="004389_0005_100D4D7459768630"/>
warlike Armor complete, and with a <HI>Spear</HI> in parti∣cular as much exceeding common ones, as his Sta∣ture exceeded the common Stature of Mankind: He <HI>advances to defy the Armies of</HI> Israel, and challenges them to produce a Man that would be so hardy as to encounter him.</P>
<P>SAUL, the unhappy King whom <HI>GOD gave in His Anger</HI> to <HI>Israel,</HI> was present to behold the Sur∣prize, the Disorder and Confusion of his enervated People: And all <HI>Israel</HI> were overwhelmed with the fearful Expectation of ignominious and cruel Slavery: <HI>Terror itself</HI> had chilled the Hearts of the whole <HI>Isra∣elitish</HI> Host and caused the Faces of the most Brave among them to be covered with Distress and An∣guish.</P>
<P>At the <HI>View</HI> of such a tremendous Adversary, and at the <HI>Hearing his mighty Voice, his daring Challenges and his fierce,</HI> tho' too early <HI>Boasts and Threatnings,</HI> their <HI>fainting Souls were upon the Wing and the Shades of the Night were just rushing over them.</HI></P>
<P>But now, when there was not a Man of the whole <HI>Israelitish</HI> Army, that had the Heart to ap∣pear for them, to espouse their Cause and revenge their Wrongs; Almighty GOD of His ineffable Good∣ness disposed and excited a brave Soldier to accept the Challenge of the haughty GOLIATH: 'Twas DAVID the great, the good, the generous, who with his gallant, but gentle, Voice revives the Hopes of disheartned <HI>Israel</HI> and recals their departing Spirits.</P>
<P>The intimidated <HI>Israelitish Monarch</HI> indeed could not at first believe and hope, that DAVID by Reason of his tender Youth was <HI>equal to the vast Encounter,</HI> and therefore endeavours to disswade him from the Tho'ts of it.</P>
<P>But the young Hero, instead of being discouraged and turned aside by the Speech of his King, grows rather more courageous and more resolved for the Combate: For he was <HI>strong in the LORD and in the Power of his Might.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004389_0006_100D4D76F08FF220"/>Being therefore Divinely fortified in his Mind, he hence says to his terrified Prince, <HI>Thy Servant will go and fight with this</HI> Philistine, <HI>seeing he has defied the Armies of the living GOD</HI>; Q. D. Tho' you, my Sovereign, have endeavoured to put me off from my proposed Encounter, you have only con∣firmed me in my valorous Purpose. 'Tis true GO∣LIATH is a Warrior, an old and experienced War∣rior, and I allow that I am but a <HI>Learner in the Art of War</HI>: But in the present Case I have <HI>an unshaken Reliance,</HI> not on my own Power and Skill, but on the Recruits and Aids of Divine Power and Grace: The audacious, godless Giant has reproached our GOD, who therefore must be his Enemy: And, when this our GOD is my Friend I have no Doubt but that HE will be <HI>my potent Auxiliary and crown me with Victory and Triumph:</HI> It must be acknowledg∣ed, that he places great Dependance on the Strength of his Body, the Force of his Valor and the Glory of his Arms: But yet I have much the Advantage of him: For the <HI>Divine Majesty is my Strength: He is my Deliverer and my Shield; and in Him do I put my Trust to subdue</HI> this Gigantic Mortal <HI>under me.</HI></P>
<P>So spake the brave DAVID: And the Conse∣quence of his Speech was, that King SAUL was per∣swaded by it to let him engage with their Enemy: Accordingly, that he might be equip'd for this Pur∣pose, we read, in <HI>Verse twenty ninth</HI> of the preceeding Context, that <HI>SAUL armed DAVID with his Ar∣mor,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Some Expositors have hence absurdly enow sup∣posed, that SAUL put <HI>his own disproportioned and un∣suitable Armor</HI> upon him: I said, They have <HI>absurdly supposed</HI> it: For it is altogether unlikely and incredi∣ble, that SAUL should put the Arms design'd and made for his own <HI>Majestically tall Body,</HI> which over-top'd all <HI>Israel</HI> by the Head, upon the small Body of DAVID. But others have with more Probabi∣lity
<PB N="8" REF="004389_0007_100D4D78795A5F80"/>
determined, that <HI>this Armor is called</HI> SAUL<HI>'s, because it was taken out of his Magazine or Armory.</HI></P>
<P>DAVID then, being thus clad and accoutred ac∣cording to the King's Mind, finds that his Arms, instead of being a Service, would be an Injury to Him and an Impediment to his Victory: He there∣fore determines to lay them aside. <HI>And DAVID said unto SAUL, I cannot go with These: For I have not proved them.</HI> Q. D. My Prince and Sovereign, <HI>I am going to fight</HI> with that proud and vain GOLI∣ATH: <HI>Tis fit and requisite, that I have suitable Arms</HI> with which to go against him: And, as I <HI>have not by proving These found them to be so, I ought not to go with Them,</HI> but <HI>should proceed to the Engagement with such Arms as are most proper</HI> for me and which are most likely to be used well and successfully by me.</P>
<P>By the Words therefore, in this Exhibition of them before us, we are fairly led to endeavour these three Things, namely,</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> Place, <HI>To justify the Lawfulness of going to War:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then, To consider Arms as requisite</HI> for them that go to War: And</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>To shew, that Men cannot well, nor should, go to War but with such Arms as are proved.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, in the <HI>first</HI> Place, <HI>The Lawfulness of going to War is to be justified</HI> by us.</P>
<P>And here we shall readily grant, that <HI>War is a very grievous Calamity and Judgment:</HI> For <HI>It pro∣ceeds</HI> for the most part from wild <HI>Ambition</HI> or <HI>Cove∣tousness</HI> or <HI>inordinate Anger</HI> or some other irregular
<PB N="9" REF="004389_0008_100D4D7A4EFF2C20"/>
Frame of Mind: And, if it should be ever so <HI>just and righteous as its Causes</HI>; it is however so <HI>pernici∣ous and hateful a Thing</HI> as that no good Man can be well pleased with it.</P>
<P>For not to mention <HI>the Men</HI> generally improved by States and Princes for carrying it on, who, tho' They be styled <HI>Regular Forces,</HI> are yet for the most Part <HI>faithless,</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nulla Fides Pietasque Viris qui Costra sequuntur. <BIBL><HI>Lucan.</HI> Pharsal. <HI>Lib. X.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> <HI>profane and impious Wretches,</HI> and of such fordid Souls as not to regard any superior Considerations whatsoever: <HI>These</HI> are the Men, who from the <HI>Love of Praise or Lust of Wealth are always ready and prepared for the Battle:</HI> And <HI>These</HI> must be received into fertile Fields and crouded Cities, and <HI>keep them in Awe and Subjection under the Pretence of defending them.</HI></P>
<P>But, not to insist upon This; It is a Thing by no means to be overlook'd or deny'd, that <HI>Men in a Time of War cannot well pursue their lawful Affairs and Interests:</HI> For <HI>Then,</HI> through the Prevalence of <HI>Fear,</HI> the <HI>Labor of the Field</HI> is neglected and the Trade of the Merchant is moor'd.</P>
<P>Nor is This all: But at such a Time, while <HI>good Laws are silent</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Inter Arma silent Leges.</NOTE> nor allowed to speak their Ter∣rors; what <HI>Debaucheries,</HI> what <HI>Thefts and Rapines, and how great a variety of other Villanies are per∣petrated?</HI> And, even <HI>after the Extinction of War,</HI> it is next to impossible but that <HI>this Pestilence of Man∣ners should continue and rage for a considerable while.</HI></P>
<P>And besides; <HI>War is always very chargeable:</HI> And, supposing the <HI>War should terminate with Success and Triumph</HI>; yet there is scarce any War so hap∣pily concluded but that, upon the Review, it will be found <HI>the Loss sustain'd</HI> is equal to the Benefit and Advantage accruing to the Victor.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004389_0009_100D4D7C59B07E08"/>And, which is no small and inconsiderable Un∣happiness, <HI>many valiant, useful and great Men fall Sacrifices in the Day of Battle:</HI>
<Q><L>For, when with Shouts two shocking Armies clos'd,</L>
<L>To Lances Lances, Shields to Shields oppos'd,</L>
<L>Host against Host with shadowy Legions drew,</L>
<L>The sounding Darts in Iron Tempests flew;</L>
<L>Victors and Vanquish'd join promiscuous Cries,</L>
<L>Triumphant Shouts and dying Groans arise;</L>
<L>With streaming Blood the slippery Fields are dy'd,</L>
<L>And slaughter'd Heroes swell the dreadful Tide.</L></Q>
Such are the <HI>Horrors of War,</HI> as the English HOMER has livelily painted them to our View <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><BIBL><HI>Pope's Homer</HI> Iliad. <HI>VIIIth.</HI></BIBL><Q>Prorsus experimur esse verissimum, quod, ante tot Annorum Millia scripsit <HI>Homerus,</HI> Cibi, Potus, Cantionum, Chorearum &amp; omnium Rerum quamvis <HI>natura dulcium</HI> Homini Satietatem suboriri, solius <HI>Belli,</HI> Rei omnium tristissimae, nullam esse Satie∣tatem. <BIBL><HI>Erasmi</HI> Epistolarum. <HI>L. XIX. p. 654.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But however, all these Things notwithstanding, <HI>War is sometimes requisite and necessary:</HI> It is so <HI>for the Recovery of what is unjustly taken away,</HI> and <HI>for the Vindication of some Wrong sustain'd,</HI> according to the Proportion of the Injury, and <HI>for procuring and establishing desireable Peace</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pax quaeritur Bello</HI> was the Motto on the Medals of the great CROMWELL; who had like to have visited <HI>New-England,</HI> but was detain'd by Providence for the Deli∣verance and Protection of the Kingdom.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Tis true there should be a <HI>Call of sufficient Autho∣rity to engage in War:</HI> Nor should <HI>War</HI> be wag'd but <HI>with a good Intention and Frame of Mind:</HI> But, when <HI>War</HI> is <HI>Thus</HI> not only <HI>commenced,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly <HI>pur∣sued</HI> also; and when, in the Prosecution of it, there is <HI>Fortitude in Dangers, Patience in bearing Hard∣ships, Industry in setting about Things, Counsel in pro∣viding for them and Speed in accomplishing them</HI>; Then it is not barely <HI>lawful,</HI> but it is <HI>honorable and glorious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004389_0010_100D4D7E600E5068"/>There have bin indeed many in <HI>Germany</HI> and other Places, who have <HI>condemn'd all going to War as unlawful and wicked:</HI> But, upon due Enquiry and Consideration, it will be found, that <HI>They know not what they say nor whereof they affirm.</HI></P>
<P>For it is certainly <HI>agreeable to the Law of Nature,</HI> and so it has unanswerably bin proved to be over and over again by learned Civilians, that <HI>a People, as such, have their just Rights and Claims,</HI> that <HI>They may and should assert and maintain These,</HI> and, in so doing, <HI>repel the Violence used against Them</HI> with their best Forces.</P>
<P>And, altho' the peaceable Men just mentioned have taken the Liberty to quote some Passages from the Writings of the old and new Covenant, and form'd some specious Arguments from them against going to War; yet it can easily be prov'd, as that the <HI>Texts</HI> produc'd are <HI>not well understood</HI> by them, and consequently <HI>the Arguments collected</HI> from them cannot be good; so that <HI>the Passages in Scripture, which are in Favor of going to War, are many and very considerable.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD in the Law, which He gave to the <HI>Hebrews, directed them with respect to the Way and Manner wherein They should proclaim, begin and pro∣secute their Wars,</HI> This cannot reasonably be denied: But now <HI>such Things as are Evil are rather to be disallowed and forbidden</HI> than <HI>permitted</HI> and even <HI>re∣commended</HI> with suitable Statutes and Laws.</P>
<P>It is suggested indeed by the Enemies to War aforesaid, as if Testimonies from the <HI>Old Testament</HI> could not be of great Validity in this Case; because there are many Things to be found in That, which ought not to be imitated by us.</P>
<P>But the Reply to This is easy, which is, that, altho' it be true, it is nothing to the present Purpose: For the Things written in the Law of MOSES con∣cerning <HI>War</HI> refer to <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI> which is
<PB N="12" REF="004389_0011_100D4D80B3F63F00"/>
perpetual: It being eternally right and just, that the Innocent should be protected and the Evil and Op∣pressive repress'd.</P>
<P>And besides, We read, in the Eleventh to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> concerning DAVID and other ancient Worthies, that <HI>by Faith they subdued Kingdoms, wax∣ed valiant in War and turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens:</HI> But, if they did these Things <HI>in the Ex∣ercise of Faith,</HI> they <HI>were not then to blame for their thus Warring.</HI></P>
<P>But, in our Scriptural Proofs of the Lawfulness of going to War, we are <HI>not confined to the Law and the Prophets:</HI> We have <HI>other Testimonies,</HI> besides These, to be taken <HI>from the Books of the New Co∣venant.</HI></P>
<P>When the Soldiers came to JOHN the Baptist and asked him, <HI>What they should do to be saved?</HI> He <HI>did not advise them to quit their Service, but to carry them∣selves well</HI> in it, namely, by <HI>doing Violence to no Man, by not accusing any one falsely and by Contentment with their Wages,</HI> as in Luk. III. 14. And our blessed SAVIOUR did not require the Centurion to <HI>resign his Post,</HI> whom He commends as having <HI>su∣perior Faith to any in</HI> Israel, as in Mat. VIII. 10. And we read of CORNELIUS a <HI>Roman</HI> Captain, that, while he was so, <HI>his Prayers and his Alms came up as a Memorial before GOD,</HI> as in Act. X. 4. TER∣TULLIAN indeed supposes, that, after his Conversion to Christianity, he quitted his Post: And This was the receiv'd Opinion of the Primitive Church: And, if the <HI>Roman Tests for Soldiers</HI> were then in Force, as They probably might be; for <HI>all above the common Soldiers</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Called</HI> Milites caligati.</NOTE> were necessarily obliged <HI>to immolate to the Pagan Deities,</HI> as EUSEBIUS assures us; we must then conclude with the learned Mr. MOYLE, that CORNELIUS undoubtedly laid down his Commission.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004389_0012_100D4D82CD6C5EF0"/>But, to go on with our Demonstration; our blessed LORD requir'd, as in Mat. XXII. 21. <HI>Render unto CAESAR the Things which are CAESAR's:</HI> Now the <HI>Taxes</HI> then collecting were without Question ap∣plied in Part <HI>for the Defence of the Common-Wealth and the Payment of Wages due to Soldiers:</HI> And the Apostle PAUL, in Rom. XIII. 4, 6 and 7 Verses, declares, as he is speaking of the <HI>higher Powers</HI> or <HI>the Civil Magistrate, He is the Minister of GOD, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil: For this Cause,</HI> proceeds He, <HI>pay you Tribute also: For they are GOD's Ministers attending upon this very Thing: Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It was, I doubt not, under the constraining Power of these and such like Passages of Holy Writ, that <HI>the Primitive Christians serv'd,</HI> as They thought them∣selves in Duty bound to do, under the Pagan Empe∣rors, as in the <HI>Theban Legion:</HI> And EUSEBIUS tells us, that They fought under the Emperor MARCUS AURELIUS in <HI>Germany</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Euseb. Lib. I. cap. 5.</NOTE> TERTULLIAN there∣fore makes it as a good Apology for the <HI>Christians,</HI> when by the <HI>Pagans</HI> They were tax'd as <HI>useless to the Common-Wealth, We fight,</HI> says he, <HI>along with you</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Vobiscum militamus. <HI>Tertullian.</HI> Apolog. <HI>4.2.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, <HI>having thus in Opposition to the Opinion of some weak and foolish Enthusiasts justified the Lawfulness of going to War,</HI></P>
<P>Let us now, in the <HI>Next</HI> Place, <HI>consider</HI> Arms <HI>as requisite for Them that go to War.</HI></P>
<P>For indeed, as DAVID <HI>thought it lawful and a Duty for him to go to War</HI>; so he judg'd it <HI>requisite to go with suitable Arms:</HI> Accordingly for an <HI>Offen∣sive Weapon</HI> He takes <HI>his Sling:</HI> And, if we may
<PB N="14" REF="004389_0013_100D4D84D77BC3B8"/>
believe the Jewish Historian JOSEPHUS, He had a <HI>Breast-Plate</HI> for a <HI>Defensive one.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true <HI>the LORD of Hosts</HI> has sometimes re∣markably interposed for His People, and <HI>avenged Himself on their Enemies immediately,</HI> as in the extra∣ordinary Overthrow of <HI>Jericho</HI> and the miraculous Destruction of SENNACHERIB's Army: But such <HI>extraordinary Things</HI> as these are not now to be ex∣pected: Nor may we presume, that we shall <HI>obtain Deliverance and Safety from Enemies but in the Use of the ordinary Means and Instruments</HI> which are Divinely allow'd and requir'd.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd at the same Time, that we ought not to <HI>confide in an Arm of Flesh and the Force of Military Weapons</HI> <NOTE N="(j)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Increpa Feras Arundinis.</HI> Psalm LXVIII. 30. Metaphora est a Feris in unum Congregatis ducta: Q. D. <HI>Increpa Congre∣gationem Arundinis,</HI> h. e. <HI>Arundiferam,</HI> usitato Hebraismo. Schindler: We read it according to its Sense, <HI>Rebuke the Company of Spearmen,</HI> that is, who are confident in their Spears.</NOTE>: But while we are <HI>im∣proving the Instruments of War</HI> we are to <HI>place our Trust in the Principal Agent:</HI> So DAVID would not <HI>trust in his own Sword or Bow or faithful Sling:</HI> But <HI>He trusts in GOD, and blesses Him as teaching his Hands to War and his Fingers to fight,</HI> as in Psalm CXLIV. 1: Where, an ancient Writer observes, DAVID alludes to MOSES<HI>'s lifting up his Hands for the Conquest of the</HI> Amalekites <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Docuit manus nostras in Praelio, non Armis, sed Precibus, pugnatutas. <BIBL><HI>Arnob</HI> in Loc.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>: And it is very probable the Psalmist's Meaning was, that <HI>GOD had taught his Hands to fight in Prayers, as well as with Arms.</HI></P>
<P>While therefore we <HI>pay our Acknowlegements unto GOD,</HI> make Him the Object of our Trust and place our entire Dependance upon Him; we are also to <HI>take the Weapons of Defence and Annoyance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004389_0014_100D4D8767B77EE8"/>As every Nation and People at some Time or other are molested with Enemies or have Cause to be apprehensive of their Sallies and Attacks upon them; there must therefore be Reason for a Compliance with our LORD's Direction, in Luk. XXII. 36. <HI>Let him, that has no Sword, sell his Coat and buy one:</HI> For, unless Men <HI>procure Armor for themselves,</HI> be the Charge of it what it will, <HI>their Enemies may with Safety and Courage come against them</HI> and make an easy Prey of them.</P>
<P>There is therefore no Room to question but that <HI>Arms are requisite and necessary for going to War:</HI> And indeed, <HI>to go without These into the Field</HI> and face an Enemy, it would be a very stupid Thing: For such as are <HI>exposed to the Assaults of Enemies,</HI> without Them, <HI>ought rather to think of ignominiously running away</HI> than staying and <HI>Fighting</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ita fit, ut non de Pugna, sed de Fuga, cogitent, qui in Acie nudi exponuntur ad Vulnera. <BIBL><HI>Veget,</HI> de Re Milit. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>1. cap. 20.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But however, <HI>as necessary as it is to have Arms in going to War,</HI> it is <HI>equally requisite and necessary to have fit and chosen ones,</HI> and such as are both <HI>suitable to the Times and adapted to the Persons</HI> that wear Them: And this is no more than what is intimated unto us in the Text, wherein <HI>some Arms are rejected and others are prefer'd before</HI> them.</P>
<P>The most <HI>ancient Arms</HI> were such as the humane Body afforded; and, according to the Poet, <HI>Teeth, Hands and Nails</HI> were the Principal of them: <HI>Arma antiqua Manus, Ungues, Dentesque fuerunt</HI> <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Lucret.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These were follow'd with <HI>Clubs</HI> and <HI>Stones for offending</HI> the Enemy, and with <HI>the Skins of Beasts for the Defence of the Body</HI> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Herodot.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, by Degrees, as Mankind <HI>encreased in Num∣bers</HI> and in their ambitious Designs and Views; so <HI>their Weapons of War grew more numerous and more cruel.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004389_0015_100D4D89C075A918"/>Some have supposed, that MOSES was <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Euseb.</HI> de Praep. Evangelic.</NOTE> <HI>one of the first Inventors of warlike Instruments:</HI> Whether that be so or no is uncertain: Tho' it is very proba∣ble, that He might be the <HI>Improver of many of them.</HI></P>
<P>If we consult <HI>the Law and the Prophets,</HI> and com∣pare the several Passages in them, wherein <HI>the Arms of the ancient</HI> Hebrews <HI>are mention'd</HI>; we shall find, that they consisted of <HI>Carriages and Arms.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Carriages</HI> were of three sorts, namely <HI>Cha∣riots with Scythes, Waggons and Bow Chariots,</HI> the Disposition and Managery of which requir'd no small Labor, Activity and Skill.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the Arms for the Body</HI>; These were <HI>such as they wore upon them, and such as were exercised by</HI> them.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Military Clothes</HI> were a <HI>Coat of Mail</HI> for the Body and an <HI>Helmet for the Head:</HI> With such Clothes as these was the Philistine Champion accou∣tred: For we read, at <HI>Verse fifth</HI> of the preceeding Context, <HI>He had an Helmet of Brass on his Head and was armed with a Coat of Mail: And the Weight of the Coat was five thousand Shekels of Brass.</HI></P>
<P>And, to these, we may add their <HI>Targets and Shields:</HI> The <HI>former</HI> were made of <HI>raw Skins, and Hides, and</HI> sometimes of <HI>Wood</HI>; and they were of such Heighth as that they would cover such as wore them from Head to Foot: The <HI>latter</HI> were made of <HI>Iron</HI> and <HI>Brass</HI> and other Metals <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Suetonius</HI> says of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> that he <HI>got his Soldiers adorn'd with Silver and Gold,</HI> that, for Fear of losing their fine Clothes, they fought with the more Bravery.</NOTE>. And betwixt these, there was a <HI>smaller Target or Shield,</HI> called afterwards <HI>Pelte,</HI> which was wore by the Archers or Bow-Men.</P>
<P>But here it must be observ'd, that, as the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Armies consisted of <HI>Horse and Foot,</HI> so <HI>each</HI> of These had their <HI>proper and peculiar Weapons</HI> to use.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004389_0016_100D4D8B4A0264A8"/>The <HI>Sword</HI> was the most ancient and common <HI>Weapon of War</HI> properly so call'd that I can find: That used among the <HI>Hebrews</HI> was like the <HI>Eu∣ropean.</HI> As for the <HI>Hanger</HI> or <HI>Scymeter,</HI> which from ancient Times to the present Day has bin used throughout all <HI>Asia,</HI> That is of an Assyrian Original.</P>
<P>We cannot certainly describe <HI>the Hebrew Pikes, Lances and Spears:</HI> But it is not unlikely, that they might have such as the ancient <HI>Romans:</HI> Theirs were some <HI>loop'd ones,</HI> some <HI>with Handles</HI> and some <HI>light Harness ones</HI> to be flung like a <HI>Dart.</HI></P>
<P>Among the <HI>Hebrews</HI> also <HI>Bows and Arrows</HI> were us'd: And they were doubtless acquainted with those Instruments called <HI>Balistae</HI> and <HI>Catapultae</HI> among the <HI>Romans,</HI> which were design'd to <HI>cast huge Rocks</HI> and <HI>a great Number of Darts</HI> at a Time.</P>
<P>And, without adding any Thing further, the com∣mon <HI>Sling</HI> was much improv'd by them: The whole Tribe of BENJAMIN are celebrated for the skilful Use of it: And the warlike DAVID is famous for his successful Improvement of it against the bulky GOLIATH.</P>
<P>These were the <HI>Arms of the Ancients:</HI> But, as we do not now <HI>conform to their Policy</HI>; so neither are we <HI>confin'd to their warlike Instruments:</HI> But there has bin found sufficient <HI>Reason for changing them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fire Arms</HI> have now superseded many of the anci∣ent Weapons, and obtain'd the Preeminence before the <HI>Lance and Pike, the Bow and Arrow, the Dart, Javelin, Sling and other offensive Weapons.</HI></P>
<P>The first Inventor of <HI>Guns</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> was a Monk, named BERTHOLD SCHUVART, a considerable Alchymist, who liv'd in the Year of our LORD <HI>thir∣teen hundred and eighty</HI> <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">He<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burt. <HI>Polon.</HI> l. 12, cap. 6.</NOTE>. Tho' some affirm the <HI>Hand-Gun or Musket</HI> was never used until the Siege of <HI>Rhegium</HI> in the Year <HI>fifteen hundred and twenty.</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="004389_0017_100D4D8D55D2FD88"/>
And it is doubted by some, who have made it their Business to enquire into such Things, whether it be so old: For about the Year <HI>fifteen hundred and sixty</HI> some Muskets and but a very few of them were mix'd with <HI>Harquebusses:</HI> So that, according to this, it must have bin <HI>forty Years</HI> before the <HI>Hand-Gun</HI> had learned to speak.</P>
<P>These <HI>Hand-Guns</HI> or <HI>Muskets</HI> have from the Time of their first Invention bin of various Lengths and Bores: But it is proper to observe here, that it is always fit <HI>the Muskets of one Army and of one State or Kingdom should be exactly of but one Bore.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these <HI>Muskets,</HI> there are now <HI>other Wea∣pons for the Foot,</HI> such as <HI>Touks, Shables, two handed Swords, Hangmen's Swords, Javelins, Morning Stars, Rapiers</HI>; most of which are rather for <HI>the Defence of Batteries, Forts and Towns</HI> than for the Field. As for the <HI>light-arm'd Foot,</HI> They for the most Part are now arm'd with <HI>Musket and Sword</HI> or <HI>Rapier.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Cavalry</HI> or Horse, They have now their peculiar Weapons; as <HI>the Pistol,</HI> which was invented by CAMILLO VITELLI an <HI>Italian,</HI> in the Time of HENRY <HI>the Eighth</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Harquebuss,</HI> which is of older Date, and the <HI>Carabine.</HI> The <HI>Ca∣rabine</HI> is usually <HI>carried about the Soldier's Neck</HI> in a Bandileer of Leather, which is a far easier Way of carrying them than the former one of <HI>hanging them at their Saddles.</HI> Some, instead of these <HI>Carabines,</HI> carry <HI>Blunderbusses,</HI> which are <HI>short Hand-Guns</HI> of a great Bore. <HI>Broad Swords</HI> were constantly used by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scots.</HI> As for the <HI>Rapier,</HI> that is not above forty Years old; altho' <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sort</HI> of them was used in the Times of the Civil War in <HI>England</HI> for a while, and afterwards laid aside.</P>
<P>Nor may we omit to mention here <HI>great Guns,</HI> which by the <HI>English</HI> are accurately divided into the <HI>Cannon,</HI> the <HI>Culverin,</HI> the <HI>Pierior</HI> and the <HI>Mortar.</HI> Each of which are sub-divided into several Sorts
<PB N="19" REF="004389_0018_100D4D8F5E36E0E8"/>
according to their various Bores: The <HI>three former</HI> are generally made of <HI>Iron Brass and Copper:</HI> The <HI>latter,</HI> I think, is generally of <HI>Iron:</HI> And, under the <HI>Mortar,</HI> may be comprehended <HI>Pot-Pieces, Square Murtherers, Tortles and Petards.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mortars</HI> are of vast Use in <HI>Sieges</HI> both to <HI>the Defendants and the Assailants:</HI> For, while the <HI>Former</HI> use them against the Batteries and Approaches of their Enemies to destroy their Men, to burn their Ammunition and ruin their Works; the <HI>Latter</HI> use them to terrify and annoy the Besieged, to burn their Houses and Magazines with Granadoes, or break them down with ponderous Stones.</P>
<P>Thus I have cursorily <HI>called over the most used and approv'd Arms</HI> of both the Ancients and the Mo∣derns, and <HI>rank'd them in the best Order I could.</HI> And, altho' what I have thus done might appear very strangely on any other Occasion; yet, in such an Auditory as This, there cannot, I think, be any sufficient Reason to blame me for it.</P>
<P>It might now perhaps be expected, that I should enter into some Enquiry, <HI>which Arms are in going to War to be prefer'd, The Ancient or the Modern:</HI> But, as the Learned are divided on this Head, I shall not venture to give Judgment upon it: Only thus far I will take leave to say, that <HI>We Moderns are frequently partial and commonly judge in our own Favor</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Whoever desires a more full Acquaintance with the <HI>Arms of the Ancients and Moderns</HI> may consult Vegetius <HI>de Re Militari,</HI> Lipsii <HI>Poliorceticon,</HI> Pancirollus <HI>de Rebus deperdi∣tis,</HI> Machiavel <HI>of the Art of War,</HI> and Turner<HI>'s Pallas Armata.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But let us now pass on to the <HI>third and last En∣terprize,</HI> namely, <HI>To shew, that Men cannot well, nor should, go to War but with such Arms as are proved:</HI> For, agreably to the Language in our Text, <HI>we can∣not nor should go with These or Those Arms, unless we have proved them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004389_0019_100D4D90E7D15C00"/>As <HI>Use and Exercise</HI> is the End of <HI>other Instru∣ments</HI>; so the <HI>same</HI> is <HI>the End of all warlike Instru∣ments</HI> in particular: And, without <HI>the Use and Exer∣cise and Proof of Them, their designed End is not attain'd.</HI></P>
<P>And, if any <HI>pretend to appear in Arms,</HI> which They <HI>know not how to use,</HI> because <HI>They never exer∣cised and proved</HI> Them, They <HI>deserve to be condemned for their Folly and Rashness.</HI></P>
<P>That Christian and Apostolical Hero the blessed PAUL acquaints us, that after the Manner of Men <HI>He fought with Beasts at</HI> Ephesus, in 1 Cor. XV. 22. And, without Doubt, in that Encounter He <HI>skilfully and successfully used the Weapons commonly improved</HI> against Beasts in the <HI>Amphitheater.</HI></P>
<P>But, if any should <HI>go to War either with Beasts or Men with Weapons which they have not exercis'd and prov'd,</HI> instead of <HI>fighting after the Manner of Men,</HI> They would only <HI>fight after the Manner of Beasts,</HI> and <HI>perhaps not in so skilful a Manner</HI> as they.</P>
<P>'Tis certain that in those Times and Places, when and where <HI>Men have not known the use of warlike Instruments,</HI> and have bin <HI>unacquainted with Military Order</HI>; the <HI>strongest Party has generally,</HI> if not always, <HI>prov'd victorious and triumphant.</HI></P>
<P>But, since <HI>Men have learned the Art of War, the skilful Use of Military Weapons and the suitable Dis∣position of Soldiers</HI> in Rank and File; this <HI>Military Science</HI> is of <HI>equal Consequence with Strength,</HI> or rather <HI>superior</HI> to it. It has to be sure a direct <HI>Tendency to make Men courageous:</HI> Whereas, on the contrary, <HI>a Multitude without Skill</HI> in Arms and <HI>ignorant of Order</HI> are usually <HI>dastardly</HI> and mean-spirited, and <HI>easily subdued</HI> by an inferior Number who are vers'd in the Military Art.</P>
<P>We may well conclude then from these Things, that <HI>the Proof of Arms and Military Discipline is alto∣gether convenient and necessary</HI> among every Nation and People.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004389_0020_100D4D927A4AAB20"/>This <HI>Military Science and Skill</HI> consists in the <HI>Sol∣dier's knowing how to proceed and fight</HI> on Horse or a Foot <HI>with Order, Regularity and Readiness:</HI> And This is to be acquir'd <HI>in the Way of Drilling or Train∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that <HI>Men in this Way may be form'd for complete Soldiers,</HI> They should, <HI>first</HI> of all, <HI>be taught their Postures</HI>; that is to say, They should be <HI>instruc∣ted how to handle and manage their Arms with Dex∣terity and Vigor, Readiness and Beauty</HI>: And then; They should <HI>be made in a Body to perform their Mo∣tions and Evolutions,</HI> or to <HI>move in such an Order and cast themselves into such a Figure</HI> as shall be com∣manded.</P>
<P>I shall not here be so minute as to say any Thing concerning <HI>the particular Exercises of the Horse and Foot,</HI> lest I should be tiresome to Those of my Au∣ditory who are acquainted already with these Things: But I would only observe, that <HI>the Words of Command both for Horse and Foot in their Motions are the very same</HI>; tho' <HI>the Distances</HI> requir'd of Them are <HI>dif∣ferent</HI> <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Three Feet <HI>are allow'd between Files of Foot, That is Order;</HI> Six <HI>is</HI> open Order; Twelve <HI>is</HI> double double Distance <HI>or</HI> open open Order: <HI>In</HI> Exercising Bodies of Horse, Six Feet <HI>are allow'd for</HI> single Distance, Twelve <HI>for</HI> double: <HI>The</HI> Ger∣mans <HI>allow ten for one, twenty for the other.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, if any be <HI>desirous of obtaining a complete Know∣ledge of the Postures, Motions▪ and Evolutions</HI> in the Training either of particular Men or of Bodies <HI>of Horse and Foot</HI>; They may be assured, that it is <HI>not enow to learn the Words of Command by Reading or by looking on the Figures of a Compliance with them:</HI> For <HI>the Military Art is practical:</HI> And most Men shall <HI>understand more by observing and practising</HI> of it for three Days than by <HI>Reading and Study for that Number of Years:</HI> LUCULLUS indeed was but a <HI>raw Soldier</HI> when he set out from <HI>Rome</HI>; and yet, on
<PB N="22" REF="004389_0021_100D4D949296E558"/>
his Journey and while he winter'd in <HI>Greece,</HI> he so far improv'd himself in <HI>the Art of War by consulting the Histories</HI> he had formerly read, that, after several Battles and Sieges, MITHRIDATES pronounc'd him to be the most expert and able Commander next to ALEXANDER commonly called <HI>the Great</HI> that he had known or read of in History: but he is a singu∣lar and extraordinary Instance.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavor'd the Illustration and Proof of the Points offer'd to our Consideration: And, if after all that has bin offer'd any should think, either that <HI>War is not lawful</HI> in the Cases which have bin mention'd, or that <HI>Arms are not requisite and necessary for carrying it on,</HI> or that <HI>Men may go to War with∣out Skill in Arms from the Proof and Exercise</HI> of them; I must ingenuously own, that I despair of convincing and satisfying them to the contrary.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Improvement</HI> of what has bin offered now remains: And it shall be made in a threefold Ad∣dress, <HI>first</HI> of all, <HI>To the ancient and honourable Com∣pany</HI> who have done me the Honor of an unanimous Choice to this Service; then, <HI>To the Government over us</HI>; and, in fine, <HI>To this whole Militant Assembly.</HI></P>
<P>As therefore to You, <HI>Gentlemen of the Artillery,</HI> who are the very Soul from whom our Militia has its Life and Motion <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Turba militaris sine Duce Corpus est sine Spiritu. <BIBL><HI>Quint. Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>, You are <HI>much to be com∣mended for your Endeavors to revive the Proof and Exercise of Arms</HI> among us.</P>
<P>For, altho' <HI>the GOD of Armies</HI> has blessed us with a long Peace; we know not how soon <HI>our Plough-Shares may be turn'd into Swords, and our Pruning-Hooks into Spears:</HI> There is therefore no Room to doubt but that, as <HI>fit Arms are necessary for us, our Men</HI> also <HI>should be made skilful in the Use</HI> of Them:
<PB N="23" REF="004389_0022_100D4D969E804DC8"/>
For it would be of dangerous and very bad Conse∣quence to be <HI>obliged to learn Military Skill, when the immediate Exercise of it is wanted.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>where is Military Skill to be learned but in the proper School of it?</HI> Such, Sirs, is your Company: It was <HI>founded for this End by</HI> the Government: And, as it has bin <HI>of great Use and Advantage</HI> hither∣to for obtaining this End; so we cannot but <HI>desire and hope, that it will be yet more and more successful</HI> towards it.</P>
<P>The Generality of our People, I fear, <HI>look upon Training as an useless Exercise or only a trifling Piece of Recreation:</HI> For, at our <HI>annual Trainings, the Practice of many of our common Soldiers is sportful</HI> and ludicrous: But this is a <HI>vast Indecency:</HI> And yet it is a much greater Piece of Indecorum and an higher Fault, if any of <HI>the Officers can wink or smile</HI> at any such Irregularities.</P>
<P>We may well expect of You, Sirs, who are our <HI>Masters in the Art of War,</HI> that <HI>our Trainings and Martial Exercises be gravely perform'd</HI> and that our <HI>Skill in Military Discipline grow and encrease</HI> by a diligent Proof of it, that <HI>our Men,</HI> while <HI>under Arms,</HI> be so sedate and quiet as that no Voice be heard but their Commander's, and that, <HI>after they are dismissed,</HI> they do <HI>not grow boisterous and unruly, but modestly retire with their Arms.</HI></P>
<P>And, if you would <HI>keep the respective Companies</HI> of which you are the Officers in good Order and lead them on to Piety and Virtue; it becomes you, as Tit. III. 8. to <HI>be careful</HI> [not <HI>to maintain,</HI> as we render it, but] <HI>to go before others in good Works:</HI> For the Greek Word <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><Q>ΠΡΟΙΣΤΑΣΘΑΙ. <HI>Turnus</HI> in Arma Viros Armis cir∣cundatus Ipse Suscitat. <BIBL><HI>Virgil Aeneid. L. IX.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE> here used is a Military Term taken from Those who lead a Company or Army.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="004389_0023_100D4D9932E95B10"/>And, in fine, <HI>Look up to GOD, the Giver of every good Gift and of every perfect Giving, for all that Military Skill, Direction and Conduct which you fur∣ther want</HI>; and <HI>It shall be liberally and without up∣braiding given You.</HI></P>
<P>By the Observation of These and such like Rules, Dear Sirs, You may <HI>depend upon the Divine Favor and Blessing, when War shall arise and an Host shall encamp against You:</HI> So that, when You are <HI>called forth to Battle,</HI> You may say to your People, as in the Style of DAVID to King SAUL, <HI>The LORD has delivered us from the Paw of the Lion and the Bear; and He will deliver us out of the Hand of the Philistine,</HI> as in <HI>Verse thirty seventh</HI> of the preceeding Context: And we, who have a rais'd Opinion of your Valor and Conduct, shall answer you in the Language of SAUL to the Heroic DAVID, as in the same <HI>thirty seventh Verse, Go, and the LORD of Hosts be with you.</HI></P>
<P>In the Next Place; Our Address is to be made with a becoming Deference and Submission, but yet <HI>with the Courage becoming a Soldier,</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">In publico Diserimine omnis Homo Miles est.</NOTE> <HI>to the Govern∣ment</HI> over us.</P>
<P>And here, since it entirely belongs to your EX∣CELLENCY to <HI>appoint our Military Officers</HI>; we cannot but hope,</P>
<P>Sir,</P>
<P>That you will only <HI>honor</HI> such with Military Com∣missions as are <HI>Men of Piety, Prudence, Generosity, superior Knowledge in Military Affairs and able to support their Dignity and Authority</HI>; and that, if any of them appointed by your EXCELLENCY fail to answer these Characters, you will <HI>take away their Commissions and give Them to such as are more worthy of Them</HI> <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">Detur digniori.</NOTE>: And the Reason of this our Hope is
<PB N="25" REF="004389_0024_100D4D9AE844F9A8"/>
assign'd for us by the wise Man, who says, in Prov. XXVI. 8. <HI>As he that bindeth a Stone in a Sling,</HI> or the Military Instrument already mention'd called a <HI>Balista, so is he that giveth Honor to a Fool:</HI> For the heavy <HI>Stone</HI> and the stupid <HI>Fool</HI> are <HI>alike rais'd</HI> with a View to their doing Execution: But They are <HI>equally insensible of their Advancement</HI> and <HI>incapable of themselves to do any Thing to Purpose.</HI></P>
<P>But, as to <HI>the Care of providing against a Time of War; This belongs to the whole Legislature:</HI> To you,</P>
<P>Most Honored Rulers, It appertains to <HI>raise need∣ful Moneys, to procure suitable Arms, Ammunition and Provisions and to build and repair Fortifications.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Money</HI> is necessary for carrying on a War and evidently appears to be <HI>the Nerves and vital Spirit</HI> of it; It becomes you, Sirs, to see to it that <HI>your Treasury be supplied with Money,</HI> and that it be with <HI>such Money as is well regulated and established</HI>: This, I say, becomes you <HI>from a due Regard to Righteous∣ness and Honesty.</HI></P>
<P>Since also <HI>Arms both of Defence and Annoyance</HI> are requisite towards maintaining a War; It is incumbent on you to <HI>found an Arsenal or Magazine for all war∣like Instruments.</HI></P>
<P>Again; As it is <HI>impossible for Men in a Time of War to hold out against their Enemies and the Want of Necessaries</HI>; the <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> therefore should take Care, that <HI>such as are employed in their Service have their Backs well covered and their Stomachs sa∣tisfied with good Provisions.</HI></P>
<P>And, inasmuch as <HI>Fortifications</HI> are for the Safety of your Subjects and the Security of our Properties; It is undoubtedly the Province of our most Honored Legislators to <HI>build such in the Places most convenient for Them:</HI> And, Sirs, allow me to speak it with Freedom, If you do <HI>not think it proper to erect any
<PB N="26" REF="004389_0025_100D4D9CC3D50888"/>
New ones, it behoves you</HI> at least <HI>to repair, enlarge and strengthen the Old ones</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">His Excellency our Governor has repeatedly recom∣mended this Thing to the Government: But, to our Shame, we have not minded and followed what He has recom∣mended thus for our Safety and Advantage.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is high Time, that our <HI>Batteries,</HI> which made an handsome Figure and had some tolerable Strength formerly, but are now in spreading Ruins, <HI>should be re-edified.</HI></P>
<P>And you cannot wonder at it, Sirs, if, out of Re∣spect to <HI>The Castle,</HI> where I was improved in your Service for a Number of Years, and to my Comfort had a delightful Opportunity of making Progress in useful Knowledge, I beseech you to take a special Notice of that <HI>beautiful and important Fortress:</HI> It ought to be <HI>further strengthned:</HI> And there is <HI>want∣ing a greater Number of Men,</HI> able and effective Men, to be constantly there upon Duty: <HI>Nor</HI> is there <HI>sufficient Encouragement for able Officers and Soldiers to abide</HI> there: <HI>Nor yet has it been duely considered, how many and unavoidable the Expences are of the Commanding Officer usually residing</HI> there <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">My Relation in Times past to <HI>The Castle</HI> is, I think, a good Excuse for what I said in its Behalf: And <HI>my Love and Respect to its Commanding Officer</HI> was too great and strong to be concealed on such a fit Occasion for expressing it.</NOTE>: These Things are in Fact true: And, if They be so, you will be so good as to <HI>forgive me this Wrong.</HI></P>
<P>And here it may be of Consequence to observe, that we have <HI>very few</HI> Persons, as I have Reason to believe, in the Province who are <HI>versed in the Art of Gunnery: This,</HI> if it should be a <HI>Time of War,</HI> We should find to be a <HI>vast Inconvenience:</HI> I would there∣fore humbly move it to the Legislature, <HI>Whether it would not be well for Them to pay for the Schooling of a meet Number of Persons</HI> to <HI>learn this necessary Art.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="004389_0026_100D4D9FE20526F8"/>Moreover, Honored Sirs, I would offer one Thing more to your Consideration, which is; It appears re∣quisite, that <HI>some Law should be enacted, whereby our young Men shall be obliged to undergo certain fatiguing Marches and other laborious Exercises:</HI> For otherwise there is Reason to fear, that we shall <HI>grow a lazy, feeble, effeminate and pusillanimous People,</HI> and be soon and easily overcome by any potent Invaders.</P>

<P>It <HI>has not bin tedious unto Me, but for you and your People I have judg'd it safe, to mention these Things in your Audience:</HI> And I cannot but hope, that I have not given just Ground of Offence in the Liberty which I have taken on this Occasion.</P>
<P>But I proceed, in the <HI>Third</HI> and Last Place, to <HI>address this whole Militant Assembly:</HI> For now <HI>Res ad Triarios rediit:</HI> And, as the <HI>Triarii</HI> among the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> were <HI>in the Rere</HI> and were the <HI>most completely disciplin'd Soldiers</HI> that they had; we have now also <HI>in the Rere</HI> of our Discourse <HI>to do with an higher Order of Soldiers,</HI> even such as are <HI>Christian and spi∣ritual Soldiers:</HI> Such indeed either are or should be this whole Assembly.</P>

L. 2. cap. 5.—The Soldier's Oath, according to <HI>Polybius,</HI> was, <HI>Obtemperaturus sum et facturus quicquid mandabitur ab Imperatoribus juxta vires.</HI> Lips. <HI>de Militia</HI> Rom. L. 1. Dialog 6.—Those, who had sworn This, were <HI>Milites te<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sacramentum.</HI></NOTE>: And accordingly we should <HI>bind our selves by a solemn Oath and Vow to conform to all the Directions and Orders of our Divine</HI> Generalissimo, with a deliberate, serious and inviola∣ble <HI>Purpose to walk in all His Commandments and Or∣dinances blameless.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="004389_0028_100D4DA3025C2BF8"/>And, becoming thus <HI>Milites per Sacramentum,</HI> or <HI>Enlisted Soldiers by a professed Subjection to the Gospel</HI> and its Ordinances; we are now <HI>to take the Arms which our Divine Emperor has bin pleased of His Goodness to provide</HI> for us: And <HI>These</HI> we are to <HI>ex∣ercise and prove.</HI></P>
<P><HI>These Weapons,</HI> like the Warfare in which they are to be used, <HI>are spiritual,</HI> but <HI>powerful and mighty:</HI> For our suprerne LORD and Commander may ad∣dress us with much more Truth and Propriety than BELISARIUS his Army, when he was about to put some lewd Soldiers to Death, <Q>Know, that I am <HI>come to fight with the Arms of Religion and Justice,</HI> without which neither Victory nor Happiness is to be expected: I desire my <HI>Soldiers should have their Hands clean</HI> to kill an Enemy: Never will I suffer any Man in my Army that has <HI>Fingers crooked or bloody,</HI> were he in Arms as terrible as Lightning: <HI>Force</HI> is of no Consequence, if <HI>it have not Equity and Conscience for Companions</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Procop. L. 1. <HI>De Bello Vandal.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>—And indeed He, who is our great and glorious Leader, has clearly re∣vealed it as His Will and Expectation, that <HI>we should have and exercise such spiritual Arms as These.</HI></P>
<P>But here, that so we may be <HI>acquainted with the whole Armor of GOD and put it on</HI>; I shall fetch it out from <HI>the Tower of the Son of</HI> DAVID, especially from <HI>that Apartment</HI> of it the <HI>Sixth</HI> Chapter to the <HI>Ephesians.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sirs, is <HI>a fine Belt</HI> for us. A <HI>military Gir∣dle</HI> is of great Use for Soldiers: And it is a Piece of Armor of such Significance, that in ancient Times it signified a <HI>complete warlike Dress.</HI> But <HI>this Belt</HI> is a rich and admirable one. 'Tis <HI>Truth, which is to be girded about our Loins.</HI>—Some suppose it is <HI>an Adhe∣rence to the Gospel</HI> or an <HI>holding fast the Form of sound Words:</HI> But This is to confound the <HI>Belt with the
<PB N="30" REF="004389_0029_100D4DA519C87AA8"/>
Sword,</HI> which is afterwards to be produc'd.— It is rather to be understood of <HI>Sincerity and Integrity,</HI> in Opposition to <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> which enervates the Mind: And the Passage alludes to That in the Prophecy, in Isa. XI. 5. <HI>Faithfulness shall be</HI> the <HI>Girdle of his Reins.</HI> This <HI>Faithfulness</HI> or <HI>Truth</HI> or <HI>Integrity</HI> then, as our <HI>Military Belt,</HI> is <HI>to be girded</HI> about us <HI>to keep us erect and steady in our spiritual Exercise.</HI></P>
<P>And here, <HI>Fellow Soldiers,</HI> is a <HI>Divine Breast-plate</HI> for us: 'Tis <HI>Righteousness:</HI> Which may denote <HI>an universal and impartial Obedience to the Divine Laws:</HI> For <HI>This will defend and guard our Hearts</HI> against the Detractions and Calumnies of a base and malici∣ous World: And, in <HI>wearing this Piece of Armor,</HI> we shall appear like our supreme Officer: For of Him it is written in Isa. LIX. 17. <HI>He put on Righteous∣ness as a Breast-Plate.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>next</HI> Place; If we want <HI>Armor for our Feet,</HI> here it is for us: And we are <HI>to be shod with this Preparation of the Gospel of Peace.</HI> As it was usual in ancient Times to <HI>fix short Stakes and cast Gall-Traps</HI> in the Way of the Enemy to hurt their Feet and make them fall; and for this Cause the Soldiers had a <HI>Sort of Boot</HI> for their <HI>Feet and Legs</HI> to accommodate and arm them against the Inconveni∣ences to which they were exposed: Even such is the Case now: For <HI>in our Way to Victory and Triumph, we shall meet with Distresses, Lets and Impediments.</HI> But, to <HI>keep us from many Wounds and Injuries,</HI> we have <HI>the Gospel</HI>; which is called <HI>the Gospel of Peace,</HI> because <HI>it reveals, proposes and establishes a Peace be∣tween GOD and Man: This Gospel</HI> then let us take, with its Directions and Comforts: And <HI>This</HI> will be a <HI>wondrous Preparation against the Evils,</HI> the worst of <HI>Evils,</HI> to be encountred.</P>
<P>And then; Because <HI>we cannot fight securely with∣out a Shield,</HI> here is one for us: The Name of it is <HI>the Shield of Faith</HI>; and it is <HI>equal to quenching all the
<PB N="31" REF="004389_0030_100D4DA6A25F83C8"/>
fiery Darts of the Wicked.</HI> Like the poisonous <HI>Scy∣thian Darts,</HI> which in flying caught on Fire and inflam'd the Bodies which they pierc'd, are <HI>the Darts shot against our Souls</HI> by Satan to enflame them: But, as the ancient Warriors had <HI>Shields of raw Neats Leather to quench the Power and Venom of these Darts</HI>; so we are now <HI>provided with Armor to quench the fiery Darts of the Wicked:</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Shield of Faith; that Faith,</HI> which is <HI>the Substance of Things hoped for and the Evidence of Things not seen</HI>; and <HI>that Faith in our Prince and Saviour,</HI> which covers all the Defects of our Obedience and <HI>is imputed unto us for Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>But we are not yet fully provided <HI>with our De∣fensive Armor:</HI> We must have <HI>some for our Head:</HI> Here then <HI>is an Helmet</HI> for us: It is <HI>the Helmet of Salvation</HI>; or what is elsewhere called, <HI>the Hope of Salvation.</HI> Our Divine Commander has <HI>put this Helmet on His Head,</HI> as we may see in Isa. LIX. 17. We are then to have a <HI>firm Expectation of the Bles∣sings of the New Covenant,</HI> and <HI>a lively, stedfast Hope of the Accomplishment of all the Divine Promises</HI> to us: <HI>This will guard our Heads against all hard Thoughts of GOD in the most terrifying Encounters and keep us from shrinking at the Assaults of our fiercest Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>We have now <HI>Armor sufficient for our Defence:</HI> But, that so we may be able not only <HI>to stand,</HI> but to <HI>resist and oppose the Enemies of our Souls,</HI> we should <HI>have some offensive Arms:</HI> Well Sirs: And here is <HI>the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of GOD,</HI> for us: Concerning this Weapon we may say, as DAVID concerning <HI>the Sword of the slain GOLIATH, There is none like it:</HI> With <HI>This</HI> our great LORD conquered His and our Adversary; passing <HI>it is written</HI> at him to his Foiling and shameful Retreat: And the same should we <HI>brandish
<PB N="32" REF="004389_0031_100D4DA8BB759690"/>
and push against our assaulting, spiritual Foe,</HI> who seeks our Destruction.</P>
<P>Nor yet are we provided with <HI>all our Armor:</HI> But, moreover, we are to <HI>pray always with all Manner of Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, watching thereunto with Perseverance:</HI> When <HI>the Devil, the Flesh and the World</HI> come forth against us and are furious in their Onsets, we must, like JEHOSHAPHAT in his Distres and the Emperor THEODOSIUS in his Extremities, <HI>cry to GOD with Fervor, Constancy and Importunity:</HI> And, accord∣ing to Military Rule or Order, we must <HI>continue upon our Watch,</HI> until we are <HI>reliev'd</HI> and even until we are <HI>discharg'd from our Warfare</HI> by Death, like <HI>trusty Centinels upon Duty.</HI></P>
<P>Thus are we now entirely <HI>furnish'd with fit Armor for us,</HI> not only <HI>to defend and guard</HI> us, but also <HI>for resisting and vanquishing our spiritual Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now, that we should <HI>prove this our Armor:</HI> Let us then be <HI>daily and constantly in the Exercise of it:</HI> For <HI>Use will make us perfect</HI> in the Exercise: So we shall be <HI>prepar'd for the Battle</HI> continually, tho' the Enemy should have the Har∣diness to rally ever so often against us: And so we shall come off <HI>Conquerors and more than Con∣querors,</HI> even considerable Gainers <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Praemia nunc alia atque alia Emolumenta notemus</HI> Sacramentorum: h. e. Militum Jure jurando adstrictorum. <BIBL>Juvenal. <HI>Satyr.</HI> XVI.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> and glorious Riders in Triumph, <HI>through HIM who has loved us.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed This is no more than what may be reasonably expected; since <HI>JESUS our LORD is for us and with us.</HI> After the Conversion of the Emperors to the Faith, the <HI>Tessera</HI> or Word among Them frequently was <HI>DEUS nobiscum:</HI> And it
<PB N="33" REF="004389_0032_100D4DAB649A6068"/>
continues in frequent Use, as such, yet in <HI>the Ger∣man, Danish and Swedish Armies:</HI> This, my Bre∣thren and <HI>Fellow-Soldiers,</HI> is to be our <HI>Watch Word:</HI> And, with the firm Belief of it, we are to <HI>engage in our Spiritual Warfare and pursue it faithfully even to the Death.</HI></P>
<P>In this Way we are to <HI>rejoice in the Salvation</HI> of JESUS, and <HI>in the Name of our GOD we are to set up our Banners:</HI> For so we may rest assured, that <HI>the LORD will be with us and save us with the Strength of His Right Hand:</HI> Let others then <HI>trust in the Legs of Men or the Strength of their Horses: But we will remember the Name of</HI> Immanuel, <HI>the LORD our GOD:</HI></P>
<P>Now unto HIM, <HI>whose is the Greatness, the Ma∣jesty, the Power, the Victory and the Glory,</HI> be all Honor and Praise both now and for ever,</P>
