<P>THE Duty of Believers to oppose the Growth of the Kingdom of SIN, PRESSED; The Means and Manner of Managing this Opposition EXPLAINED; The ways whereby men become guil∣ty of discouraging others from vi∣gorous attempts against the growth of Vice, and the Carnal Grounds of their so doing DETECTED.

<HEAD>THE Duty of BELIEVERS to oppose the Growth of the Kingdom of SIN PRESSED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Hebrews XII. 4.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Ye have not yet resisted unto Blood striving against SIN.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN these words is contained a Motive given unto Believers to run with pa∣tience the Race set before them, not∣withstanding the sore Trials they met with therein; as the loss of their Goods, Shame, and the contradiction of Sinners. <HI>Chap.</HI> 10. 33, 34. The Motive is taken from this consideration, that the Suf∣ferings they met with were small, in compa∣rison of those which other Christians had endured, and which they ought willingly to undergo, if God should call them thereto. In these words, (1.) Is implied, that in running the Race Christ hath set before us, we are to resist and strive against Sin. Here we may note.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by <HI>Sin,</HI> which is here declared to be the <HI>Enemy</HI> we are to res<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist and strive a∣gainst, is meant either,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Sin yet <HI>remaining in true Believers themselves;</HI> that Sin which dwelleth in them. Every true Believer ought to make it his con∣stant
<PB N="4" REF="001348_0003_0FB29176F99DF448"/>
work to resist and strive against In∣dwelling-sin in himself.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or those <HI>Temptations to Sin,</HI> which Satan and his Instruments make use of, whereby they endeavour to draw or drive good men into Sin; The Enemies of our Souls use both artifice and force, policy and power, flatteries and threatnings to cause good men to aposta∣tize from Christ. Some by Sin in our Text, understand <HI>Sinners,</HI> such who discourage o∣thers from Vertue, and encourage others into Vice. But this Term, Sin; which we are to resist and strive against as an Enemy to us, may comprehend <HI>the whole Kingdom of Sin and Satan;</HI> the Kingdom of Darkness, in all its <HI>parts, members, policies and stratagems, designs and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. By Sin in this Text, I incline to think, that we ought chiefly to understand, that which is the <HI>Prevailing Sin</HI> of the <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> in which each Believer doth live: For it is a non-compliance with, and an oppositi∣on to the Prevailing Sins of the Time and Ge∣neration wherein Believers have liv'd, that hath in all Ages occasioned the greatest suf∣ferings unto good men, in their Names, Estates or Lives: when Idolatry was the Sin which was most in fashion in the world, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> holy men by resisting and striving against it, suffered the loss of their lives.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>resisting and striving against</HI> this E∣nemy Sin, is expressed by such words in the Original Tongue, as import a resisting of it with agony, putting forth all their force and strength against it; and the making an <HI>offen∣sive,</HI> as well as a <HI>defensive war</HI> against it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="001348_0004_0FB29179C8242AE0"/>
2. The words of our Text teach us this Lesson, that Believers should be encouraged to continue in the Exercise of patience under all the lesser sufferings they meet with, on account of their opposition to the prevailing sins of the Age and Place wherein they live, from this consideration, that God is as yet sparing them from such hot service, which he hath in times past call'd some of his Cham∣pions unto, against this Enemy Sin, namely, to have their Blood shed, and to part with their very lives in this War against Sin.</P>

<P><HI>God expects His Own People should resist &amp; strive against Sin, in the several Ranks and Posts wherein he hath placed them; especially against the most prevailing Sins of the Age, Place and Generation wherein they Live, putting forth the whole force of their Spiritual Strength, Courage and Wisdom, in their opposition thereto; being prepared and disposed to part with their very Lives in this Spiritual War against the King∣dom of Sin, if God should call them thereunto.</HI></P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Believers ought to strive against the pre∣vailing Sins of the Times, both singly and joyntly, and in all Conditions, Stations and Capacities wherein they stand. Unto this Resisting of Sin, Believers are moved, and hold themselves obliged by such considerati∣ons as these.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Sin is the Enemy of Mankind;</HI> their worst Enemy, their common Enemy; and in some sense their only Enemy. More particu∣larly they consider,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="001348_0005_0FB2917DCD8457A8"/>
1. That <HI>each and every single person</HI> hath no worse Enemy then his own sins; &amp; among all the sins which he falls into, or is subject of, his worst Enemy is that which is most properly his <HI>own Iniquity.</HI> The Enemy within the walls of our hearts, is more dangerous than the Enemy besieging of us from with∣out: Indeed we are by Nature unsensible that we carry our worst enemy in our own bosoms, and shall continue insensible hereof, until God by the power and efficacy of his Spirit do convince us thereof: We are naturally much concerned about, and afraid of our sup∣posed enemies without us; but ignorant of the danger we are in of the real enemy that lodgeth within us. The sins prevailing in our hearts, as atheistical &amp; profane thoughts, pride, worldly-mindedness, hypocrisie, malice, and envy, and <HI>similia,</HI> do us more hurt, and expose us to more danger then all the enemies real or supposed that are without us. The Temptations of Satan, and the snares of the World get victory over us, by reason of that enemy sin dwelling in us, which takes part with those enemies from without us. The folly bound up in a mans own heart doth ex∣pose him to more danger, than all the policies of all other men can do, who set themselves against him.</P>
<P>Again; The sins produced in persons by the principle of Corruption dwelling in them, whether they be sins of omission or commissi∣on, do hurt the Sinners themselves more than they can hurt any one else besides themselves, and more than any one else can hurt them. It is true not only of the man who is given
<PB N="7" REF="001348_0006_0FB2917EFB501118"/>
to excessive drinking, but of the Adulterer, Thief, dishonest Gainer, the profane Swearer, Sabbath-breaker, and of him that omits the secret duties of Religion; such a man is his own worst enemy.</P>
<P>Sin sets God himself against a man; now it were better for any man to have all the world adversaries to him, then that One Great and Glorious God who made him, and who can cast both Body and Soul into Hell.</P>
<P>Sin exposes a man to the Curses of the Law, to Death temporal, spiritual and eternal; and in short, nothing could or would hurt any man, were it not for Sin in himself, and the guilt of sin lying upon himself; a man should have no other enemy to conflict with, were it not for Sin adhering to, and inherent in him∣self; in which respect Sin may be called Mans <HI>only</HI> enemy; and it is also his <HI>constant</HI> enemy, which at no time doth him any good, but at all times is procuring mischief &amp; misery un∣to him.</P>
<P>Therefore every man ought, and every Be∣liever doth, and will resist and strive against his own sin, sin in himself; against the whole body of sin in himself, but chiefly against the leading, ruling, prevailing and most predo∣minant sin in himself; not only by exercising repentance and godly sorrow for those sins that have prevailed in him, &amp; applying him∣self by faith to the Blood of Christ for pardon∣ing mercy &amp; deliverance from the guilt of sin; but by setting upon the work of Mortification of sin dwelling in him with all his might; &amp; finding his own strength (even that of grace received) to be of it self too weak to encoun∣ter
<PB N="8" REF="001348_0007_0FB2918077FB7390"/>
with and subdue this enemy in his heart; he doth therefore by earnest prayer call in, &amp; by the due exercise of faith obtain the help of Heaven against the mighty sins that rise up against him.</P>
<P>A true Believer doth also resist and strive against sin in himself by maintaining a <HI>strict watch</HI> over his heart, &amp; over his whole man, having learned not to trust his own deceitful heart.</P>
<P>He doth also daily renew the Combate a∣gainst Sin; confessing unto God the faults &amp; follies which he discerneth in himself, and the daily eruptions of sin that dwelleth in him; complaining of himself unto God; <HI>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of sin and death?</HI> and he maketh his complaint to the right object, the blessed Lord Jesus Christ, who came into this world to save his people from their sins; unto him he is constantly crying, <HI>Jesus, thou Son of Da∣vid, have mercy on</HI> me, and deliver me from this my worst Enemy, my sinful self.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Family Sins</HI> are the worst enemies of Fa∣milies, and do bring all those calamities and distresses upon them which befal them. Sin deprives Families of that comfort, for the at∣taining whereof, these first Societies that ever were erected in the world were appointed. All the Crosses, Losses, Poverty, Sicknesses, Deaths, Distractions and Disorders that are in Families must be placed to the account of sin. The reason why some Families flourish not in their Persons, Estates, or Interests, is not chiefly because their Neighbours do not love them, but because Sin (like the worm at the
<PB N="9" REF="001348_0008_0FB291848B434918"/>
root of <HI>Jonah's</HI> Gourd) makes them wither and decay. Where Family Prayer is neglect∣ed, and God is not owned, honoured, wor∣shipped in a Family, no wonder that Family falls under a blast. If men resolve to be rich without asking God leave, without begging of God that his presence may be with them in their employments, and his blessing may be upon their lawful Endeavours, it is just with God that such should be disappointed. If the Head of the Family make no conscience daily &amp; duly to perform Family Prayer, he may thank his own sinful omission of Duty that his Inferiours prove unto him undutiful, dis∣obedient, unruly, and altogether discomforts to him. Why should we expect that God should I provide for our Families their daily Bread, if we refuse to pay to God (our great Landlord) his daily Rent and Revenue due unto him from us, namely the morning and evening Sacrifice of Prayer and Praises? Can we expect our Inferiours should shew unto us Reverence and Obedience, while we our selves are disobedient to God, and undutiful to our Maker and Glorious Redeemer? How can we expect that the blessed God by his preventing goodness should preserve us and ours from sicknesses, dangers and deaths, and take a fatherly care of us from day to day, while we refuse to acknowledge him to be our Father, and the Father of our Families, by honouring and obeying of him? <HI>Mal.</HI> 1. 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Sins prevailing in greater Societies of men, (as Towns, Churches, Provinces, Kingdoms and Empires) are the worst Ene∣mies of those Societies or States. Whence
<PB N="10" REF="001348_0009_0FB2918901206038"/>
comes general <HI>Poverty,</HI> Scarcity, Deaths, unseasonable weather, Losses by Land &amp; Sea? Whence comes <HI>War</HI> with all the calamities that are the appendices of it? Whence comes Epidemical Diseases and mortal Distempers? only from Sin. Sin provokes God, &amp; then he raises up the Heathen and other Adversaries against us. Our <HI>Barrenness</HI> under the means of Grace provokes God to smite the Earth with barrenness, that it shall not yield its en∣crease unto us. We <HI>fall short</HI> of the duty that we owe unto God, therefore he cuts us short of our outward comforts: We delay &amp; pro∣crastinate our repentance for Sin, and accep∣tance of Christ offered to us in the Gospel, therefore God delayes to hear our Prayers, &amp; to save us out of our distresses.</P>
<P>Sin is our <HI>Common</HI> Enemy; an Enemy to all our Communities and Societies; a <HI>publick and open</HI> Enemy to us, and an Enemy to the publick interests of a People, as well as to the interests of private men. Therefore we ought joyntly to resist and strive against Sin, by u∣niting our forces and strength against it; yea we should lay by our smaller differences a∣mong our selves, that with one consent and one heart we may defend our selves against, and endeavour to subdue this common and implacable Enemy, which seeks the destructi∣on of us all. The people of God should re∣sist and strive against sin from a principle of <HI>Self-preservation,</HI> and from <HI>Love</HI> to the Publick; because sin resists and opposes all their good &amp; comfort, and tends to their ruin, misery and destruction.</P>
<P>To such an uniting of their forces against
<PB N="11" REF="001348_0010_0FB2918C71981738"/>
sin, their common Enemy, True Believers are further excited by considering,</P>
<P N="2">2. That Sin <HI>is Gods Enemy</HI> as well as theirs. Now all that have sincerely given up their Souls to Christ, and expect Salvation by him, do take Christ's Friends to be their Friends, and Christ's Enemies to be their Enemies. A true Christian is one that hath Espoused the Interest of Christ to be his own Interest; yea, he prefers the Interests of Christ his Re∣deemer, before any other Interest that may be call'd his own: He hath sworn allegiance to Christ, and engaged himself to be his true &amp; faithful Subject, and Listed himself under Christ as his Captain General, to fight against all Christ's Enemies, &amp; to prosecute &amp; promote all the designs of Christ. Now the most pre∣vailing sins of the Age and Place wherein he lives, are those very Enemies of Christ which in a peculiar manner he accounts himself bound to resist and strive against; he that doth not most vigorously resist those sins which are the prevailing sins of the Time &amp; Generation wherein he lives, doth want one comfortable mark and character that might evidence the truth and sincerity of Grace in him. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.8.11. A Christian dare do no other then resist and strive against sin, both because God (whom he serves) hath obliged and <HI>commanded him</HI> so to do; and because he hath also deliberately and voluntarily <HI>bound and obliged</HI> himself by his Covenant with Christ to strive against and resist this grand Enemy of Christ. And all true Believers ha∣ving one and the same▪ living and true God to be their God; the same blessed Lord Jesus
<PB N="12" REF="001348_0011_0FB2918D36879840"/>
Chrest to be their 'aviour and Redeemer; therefore account themselves bound, as they have opportunity in their several stations, to joyn their forces together against sin, which is the great enemy of their common Lord &amp; Saviour; knowing that their Lord Jesus Christ hates neutrality in this common cause, in this War we are to manage against Sin, the common Enemy of Christ himself as well as of our selves.</P>
<P N="3">3. They consider, that <HI>the Sins of other men will hurt</HI> them, unless they do faithfully, as becomes them in their places, resist and strive against them. Believers see themselves to be in danger of faring the worse for the sins of other men; they see that they are exposed to suffer in those common Calamities which the prevailing sins of the times bring on the Publick; and Good men know that the less opposition they make to growing Vice and sin, the greater share they may expect in the publick Calamities, which the prevailing sins of the Times bring down upon the World; and therefore Godly men can take no better course to secure themselves against publick &amp; destroying Judgments, than constantly &amp; faithfully to resist and strive against those prevailing sins which procure the destroying Judgments. Those who partake of other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sins, may expect to partake of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: and because for these prevailing sins the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience: therefore Good men dare not be partakers with others in them. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.5, 6, 7.</P>
<P N="4">4. True Christians are indued from Above with a Publick Spirit, which inclines them
<PB N="13" REF="001348_0012_0FB2918EBB4E8690"/>
to resist and strive against that which hin∣ders the publick good, and brings publick Calamities on their People: They do not therefore content themselves, to seek only af∣ter the saving of their own Souls; but do what in them lieth to weaken the Kingdom of Darkness, by <HI>Converting</HI> others from their Evil ways; labouring that all persons, whom they are concerned with, and on whom they may have influence, <HI>be made sensible of the danger</HI> they are in of being drawn into a com∣pliance with, and conformiry unto the pre∣vailing Sins of the Times and Place wherein they live; giving them the <HI>best advice they can how to defend themselves</HI> from that danger, by a right use of that Spiritual Armour which God hath provided for them.</P>
<P N="5">5. Believers are encouraged to resist and strive against Sin, especially against the most publick and prevailing sins, from this consi∣deration, that in so doing they approve them∣selves unto God, and do that which is <HI>well pleasing in</HI> his fight, and shall be accepted of God, and graciously rewarded by the Lord for their fidelity in this their opposition unto sin: Supposing that what they do here∣in, should be ungrateful to carnal men, yet it suffices them to know, that every <HI>Tear</HI> they shed before God, because Sin abounds in their times, is bottled up, as precious in Gods sight; and every <HI>Prayer</HI> they put up to God, for the putting a stop to growing Vice, is entred in a Book of Remembrance before God; and <HI>every word they</HI> speak for God and against Sin, either in a way of <HI>Lamentation</HI> and Complaint <HI>unto God,</HI> or to their <HI>Fellow
<PB N="14" REF="001348_0013_0FB2919040224958"/>
Christians;</HI> or in a way of counsel and re∣proof, or by bearing any other way, a becom∣ing Testimony against prevailing Evils, shall bring back a return of mercy from God upon themselves; though their labour of love towards others for their reformation, should prove unacceptable and unsuccessful, yet it is a sufficient Consolation unto them to remem∣ber, that God doth not forget what they have done for the promoting his Interest, and for the weakening and pulling down the King∣dom of Darkness in the world. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.2.</P>
<P>They consider also, that unless they ap∣prove themselves faithful Souldiers of Christ in this War against Sin, while they are in a militant state here on Earth, they can't ex∣pect to be admitted to a triumphant estate of Glory in Heaven.</P>
<P>It is needless that I should further enlarge, concerning the Gronnds and Reasons that oblige and excite true Believers to the Resist∣ing and Striving against Sin.</P>
<P>But it is time to proceed to Consider,</P>
<P>Secondly, By what means or <HI>weapons</HI> do Good men resist and strive against the grow∣ing and prevailing sins of the Generation &amp; Places wherein they live: Namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By their Good Works.</HI> By an Holy Con∣versation they bear a testimony against those sins which are contrary to Holiness. A Ver∣tuous Life doth practically reprove and con∣demn vicious courses. The Light of a sober, righteous and religions Life discovers &amp; puts to shame the filthiness and foulness of intem∣perance, unrighteousness &amp; impiety: There∣fore holy men will most carefully abstain
<PB N="15" REF="001348_0014_0FB29191B949D520"/>
From Vices that are most Predominant and spreading in their Age, separating themselves from Sins and Sinners, that they may have <HI>no fellowship with them in the unfruitful works of darkness,</HI> Eph. 5. 11. They chuse rather to suffer Martyrdom, by losing their esteem a∣mong carnal men, than to partake with them in their immoral, dishonest and profane pract∣ices; as <HI>Joseph</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> suffered Imprison∣ment for his non-compliance with the temp∣tation laid before him by his Mistress.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By their Words.</HI> Christians account it their duty to make an <HI>Open Profession</HI> of Re∣ligion, that they have Espoused Christ's In∣terest, that they have Listed themselves under Christ to be his Souldiers in this great and constant War which Christ hath with the whole Kingdom of Sin in the World.</P>
<P>They esteem their Tongues to be their Glo∣ry, so far as they are improved in giving ne∣cessary advice and reproofs with most pathe∣tical exhortations unto Sinners to reform their evil ways, and in warning them of the dan∣ger they are in of eternal ruin, unless they save themselves from the Degeneracies and Corruptions of the Times.</P>
<P>Not only Ministers in their Station are thus to do. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 20. But private Chri∣stians also, if they cannot do it with like au∣thority, yet according to their abilities and opportunities in their more private Capaci∣ties, are with zeal and gravity to argue and dispute against sin, and plead with Sinners to forsake their evil courses; Thus did righte∣ous <HI>Lot; I pray you, brethren, do not so wicked∣ly,</HI> Gen. 19. 7. Yea, in some Cases, it is a
<PB N="16" REF="001348_0015_0FB2919347C31F20"/>
duty incumbent on Christians to inform and complain of such who are habituated to any gross Vice, that either by Church Censures, or by the penalty of the Law inflicted on them, their healing and reformation may be endeavoured, and the spreading of Vice may be prevented; which is of an infectious con∣tagious nature, unless curbed and restrained, and duly born witness against; therefore for the publick good it is needful that Paenal Laws be executed, that others <HI>may hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly,</HI> Deut. 13.11.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By their Tears.</HI> They mourn before God for those sins which prevail in their Land, which they see no way for the reformation of; all their endeavours for that end prov∣ing unsuccessful. <HI>Lots</HI> righteous soul was grieved every day to see the constancy, ob∣stinacy and impudence of the <HI>Sodomites</HI> in sinning against God. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7, 8. <HI>David</HI> shed even <HI>rivers of tears, because men kept not Gods Law.</HI> Psal. 119. 136.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>By the Prayer of Faith, they wrestle with God day and night, that the growing Vices of the Times may be reformed.</HI> This weapon of faith in Prayer they esteem as most effectual for battering down the Kingdom of Sin &amp; Vice; it works wonders for the Emendation of the Time and Generation wherein they Live, &amp; procures success to other means they make use of: Hereby they call in the help of God; and of Christ to assist and work in a more im∣mediate and extraordinary way of working for the suppressing of sin; and obtain of God that the <HI>Means of Grace</HI> shall have more effi∣cacy than usually they have for the pulling
<PB N="17" REF="001348_0016_0FB29197527C77B8"/>
down the strong holds of sin and Satan in the hearts of men; and that by the <HI>effectual and wonder-working Providence of God</HI> some that are Ring-leaders in sin, and most instrumen∣tal in causing others to sin, shall either be Converted, or be removed out of a Place, or out of the World; that so way may be made for the flourishing of Religion and Vertue a∣mong a People; so that Incorrigible Sinners were in less danger by an Army of ten thou∣sand men fighting against them, then by ten true sincere Christians praying against them: By faith in Prayer they obtain from their God, that Satan shall fall down from his throne with speed, much sooner than they expected, <HI>even like Lightning before them,</HI> Luk. 10. 18. and that the mountains of impedi∣ments and obstructions that stand in the way of those <HI>Zorobabels,</HI> whom God im∣proves for the building up of his Temple in the World, <HI>shall become a Plain,</HI> Zech. 4. 7. and that the Work of Christ shall flourish e∣ven in the midst of oppositions. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9. 25.</P>
<P>Also by the daily renewed exercise of faith in Prayer, Christ's Souldiers derive; from him new supply of <HI>Strength</HI> for their maintaining and holding out in this War against sin. A true Christian is sensible of his own weak∣ness and insufficiency, that he daily stands in need of new supplies of the Spirit to fur∣nish him with wisdom, courage and grace; that he stands in need of new manifestations of the presence of Christ with him every day, to uphold him, assist him, and succeed him in this War. He endeavours therefore to re∣sist and strive against sin in Christ's strength,
<PB N="18" REF="001348_0017_0FB2919AC2C0CDB0"/>
and not in his own: He watcheth against all up-risings of self-confidence, and self-suf∣ficiency, (which would expose him to be overpowred by this Enemy) and gets out of himself unto Christ to enable him to fight the good fight, and to withstand and overcome this Enemy, Sin.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>By their patient continuance in their opposi∣tion unto Sin, notwithstanding all the wounds and scars which they meet with in this War.</HI> They expect to meet with blows and seratches in their striving against, and resisting of grow∣ing Vices; and arm themselves before-hand with holy resolution not to be discouraged thereby; Do they meet with the <HI>contradiction</HI> of Sinners? They consider it is no more than Christ himself met with, and patiently endu∣red; therefore it becomes the members and followers of Christ to be patient under such Tryals. Do they meet with <HI>shame</HI> and <HI>dis∣grace?</HI> They remember Christ <HI>despised the shame;</HI> therefore Christ's followers should not too deeply lay to heart that shame which is put upon them by the carnal World. Those Sinners them selves will at the Last Day be filled with everlasting shame and contempt, who while they were on Earth did hate to be reformed, and persisted in opposing Vertue, decrying of Religion, and practicing of Vice. If Christians in this Life be accounted as the offscouring of all things, and be trampled on as Mire in the Streets, yet they have peace in their own consciences while on Earth, and the disgrace which they meet with here for well-doing, shall in the next life be compen∣sated with a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</P>

6. <HI>They joyn readily with others, and call upon others to joyn with them in this great work of striving against, and resisting those sins of the Times, which like a Flood are ready to bear down all before them.</HI> Doctor <HI>Sibbs</HI> in his Excellent Treatise of the Souls conflict, <HI>p.</HI> 290. saith, <HI>It is a course which will have a blessing attending it, for friends to joyn in league, one to watch over another, &amp; observe each others ways. It is an usual course for Christians to joyn together in other holy duties, as Hearing, Receiving the Sacrament, Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But this fruit of holy communion, which ariseth from a mutual observing one ano∣ther, is much wanting.</HI> Let me add, for Chri∣stians to improve an hour or two at stated times in such a communion, extending their thoughts and cares, so far as to consider where∣in they might in their Stations, be instru∣mental to stop the progress of Vice, and to promote Vertue, might be of singular use and advantage: Nay, did Christians meet toge∣ther sometimes, were it only to mourn before the Lord for the prevalency of sins which they see no likelihood of any reforma∣tion of, it would be more pleasing and ac∣ceptable to God, than the meetings of carnal persons for sinful mirth &amp; jollity, &amp; only so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> worldly Interests: But at such times they might <HI>strengthen and encourage</HI> each o∣ther to do their utmost in striving against sin, and <HI>direct</HI> each other wherein they might be most serviceable in their several Posts to pro∣mote Religion, and to save their people and their Generation from Desolating Judgments. It was an heart sinking discouragement to <HI>Elijah,</HI> to think that he was left alone in <HI>Is∣rael</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="001348_0019_0FB2919DDAC8D3A8"/>
to strive against, and resist Idolatry; God condescended to comfort him, by that infor∣mation, that there were some thousands be∣sides himself, that were striving against the sins of those Times, by their prayers &amp; pract∣ices, tho' they had not the courage, or had not the opportunity, or had not the Office and Extraordinary Call to appear so openly a∣gainst it, as <HI>Elijah</HI> himself did. It is a great En∣couragement to those who by Office are placed in the Front of the Battel against sin, to know that there are many whose hearts are with them, and their prayers daily put up to God for their success in their sincere endeavours against the Kingdom of Sin: But if such as they take to be their Fellow Souldiers, thro' scar, sloth, or for some carnal interest will not discover that their hearts are with them, but rather blame them for their for∣wardness in opposing Vice, it sinks their spi∣rits, and makes them send up such a groan to Heaven as <HI>Paul</HI> did, when no man stood by him while he pleaded the Cause of Christ and of the Gospel; <HI>I pray God lay it not to their charge,</HI> 2 Tim. 4. 16.</P>
<P>More particularly, That Ministers should meet at stated times, either in lesser Conven∣tions, or more general Assemblies, is a thing very beneficial for the upholding Religion, preserving the peace and purity of Churches, and propagating of Religion to other Places and Generations. The Lord by his Servants assembled in a Synod, <HI>Anno</HI> 1679. in this Land, set before us both what the prevailing Sins of <HI>New-England</HI> are (and which there∣fore it is not needful for me to Enumerate in
<PB N="21" REF="001348_0020_0FB291A5EF2E6A38"/>
this Discourse, being so fully done already) and what is to be done in order to the Re∣formation of them: Our thankfulness to God for the light at that time by those our Eminent Divines held forth unto us, should be expressed, not only by a reiterated perusal of each Article of their Result; but by meet∣ing together sometimes, to consult how the directions therein given us may more effectu∣ally in every Church and Plantation be put in practice, and to watch over each other, &amp; excite each other to a more serious and uni∣versal attendance to the directions therein gi∣ven us from the Word of God, in order to the reforming of Evils prevailing among us, and for the Reviving of Religion in the Land.</P>
<P>But I hasten to another Head: Namely,</P>
<P>Thirdly, To consider, in <HI>what manner</HI> Good men should resist and strive against growing Vice and Impiety. Now if we take the words of our Text to be an allusion to those Conflicts and Combats among the Heathen in old Time; which were seldom determi∣ned without blood, and manag'd by expert Artists, who Encountred each other in those Conflicts before many Spectators; we may infer from this allusion these following direct∣ions for a Christian to observe in his resist∣ing and striving against growing Vice.</P>
<P N="1">1. That this striving against sin is to be managed with <HI>Holy Affections:</HI> Particularly;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>With holy zeal, earnestness and fervour of spirit, even with agony of soul.</HI> A Christian is not to act with faint heartedness and fear, when God calls him to lift up his Voice like a Trumpet against crying Sins; but to be,
<PB N="22" REF="001348_0021_0FB291A757F2A550"/>
when the case so requires, like a Lyon in God's Cause, tho' like a Lamb in his own Cause; knowing that Lukewarmness in this case is as odious to God, as to sit still and do nothing.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>With love and pity towards Sinners, and towards the Land, which by prevailing sins are ripened for ruin, and exposed to destruction.</HI> A true Believer foreseeing a Storm of Divine Wrath and Vengeance coming on a People, (which he can readily and rationally infer from the growth of Vice and Profaness) from a compassionate spirit thrusts himself into the Gap (opened for Judgments to enter in at) endeavouring by his Prayers, Tears, Warnings, Counsels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to keep off the Judgments which the Sins of a Land expose a people unto; and is so much the more ear∣nest and vigorous herein, as he sees the day of wrath approaching and hastening towards them. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 25.</P>
<P N="2">2. This resisting and striving against sin is to be managed with <HI>holy discretion.</HI> As a Fencer shews his Skill and Art as well as Courage; so doth a Christian Souldier in his conflicts with prevailing and growing vices. He knows that zeal without discretion is but wild fire, and disserves that good interest which he heartily desires to promote. His discretion teaches him, while he is vigorously active against the Kingdom of Sin, carefully to avoid the sins forbidden in the Second Ta∣ble; namely, damnifying his Neighbour in his Honour and Reputation, in his Estate or Life, or any of his lawful interests.</P>
<P>Again, Discretion teaches him to observe
<PB N="23" REF="001348_0022_0FB291A835E79368"/>
the <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Seasons</HI> wherein he may strike the greatest blow against the Kingdom of Sin. <HI>A wise mans heart discerneth both time and judg∣ment.</HI> There are times wherein Sinners are more capable of an instruction or reproof for their Emendation, than they are at other times; such opportunity he waits for and improves to the best advantage. As for in∣stance, when a Sinner is under outward af∣fliction, or inward distress of mind, at such a time will he endeavour to speak a word in season that may put him upon it to consider his ways, to repent of his sins, and to set a∣bout the reformation of his life. Thus Chri∣stians must watch and wait for opportunities and seasons when they may have easiest ac∣cess into men, and redeem such times for the doing good to the souls of others.</P>
<P>Again, Discretion teaches him to wrap up his needful reproofs and hard arguments in soft words, expressive of his affection &amp; com∣passion to the Sinner himself. If it be need∣ful that any Sinner be laid under punishment by the Civil Law, or under Censure in the Church for his reformation; yet tender∣ness and meekness, grief and pity, expressed towards him are most likely to affect him with remorse for his sins committed, and re∣solution to avoid them for the future; while <HI>(e contra)</HI> Scoffs and Divisions do but tend to harden Sinners, and render them the more desperately wicked.</P>
<P>Again, Discretion teaches him to avoid the danger of <HI>Sinful Indulgence,</HI> of winking and conniving at sin: the Judgments <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the Posterity of <HI>Eli</HI> for his fault in that
<PB N="24" REF="001348_0023_0FB291A9B42E2780"/>
matter, is a standing warning to him to a∣void the like.</P>
<P>In all these &amp; such other like instances, he believes that saying of <HI>Solomon</HI> to hold as a truth; <HI>Discretion shall preserve thee,</HI> Prov. 2.11.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho' in some places and times (thro' the great mercy of God) the Christian Soul∣dier is not exposed to shed his Blood (in a proper sense) by his resisting and striving a∣gainst Sin, yet in some sense he may say with the Apostle, that <HI>he is in deaths often,</HI> 2 Cor. 11. 23. while he is managing this Combat; tho' he find the strength of his body &amp; mind decaying, wasting and consuming in the hot service he is called unto, of opposing Vice &amp; Prophaness, yet perseveres therein, and is willing to spend and be spent in this Service against. Christ's Enemies, and resolveth by Gods help to continue fighting the good fight, till Death in a proper sense, gives him a dis∣charge from this War. Tho' he find that to be in good earnest an opposer of sin &amp; vice is not the way to popular Applause, though he meet with such Tryals on that account, which are more bitter than death it self unto him; <HI>yet the righteous man holds on his way, &amp; grows stronger and stronger (Job</HI> 17. 9.) in making resistance to the growth of the Kingdom of Sin and Satan; the wounds he receiveth, make him fight with the greater courage and vigour; and seeing his life must be spent in this Service, be resolveth to do as much exe∣cution as possibly he can upon the Enemy, before Death overtakes him.</P>
<P N="4">4. As those who sought among the Heathen openly before many Spectators, may be sup∣posed
<PB N="25" REF="001348_0024_0FB291AEA36D0010"/>
to fight in good earnest, knowing the Blood of one of the Combatants must be spilt be∣fore they left the Stage. So the Christian Soul∣dier in his striving against Sin acts with intense∣ness of mind, and <HI>integrity of heart.</HI> Christ hath in every Age, had some sincere Souldiers, who in the uprightness of their hearts have resisted and striven against sin. Indeed, many have there been in former and later Ages, who have pre∣tended and professed themselves to be of the number of the reformed, and to be forward re∣formers of others also, who have soon discovered themselves to have acted only for their own self ends; for, not obtaining their By-ends thereby, they have laid aside their profession of Religion, and have turned Enemies to, and Opposers of the interest of Religion in the power of it.</P>
<P>As there is as much danger of the Banishment of Learning by some that have a little smattering of it, which only puffs them up to despise those who excel themselves therein, as there is from those who are more ignorant; and as much dan∣ger of the overthrow of the Civil State by such who (tho' they are acted only by self interest) have a little smattering in the Law and in Poli∣ticks, which only fills them with self conceited∣ness, and causes them to despise and oppose those who are thorow-paced in those Sciences, and are indued with sincere love to the Publick Good▪ So the work of Reformation is very much dis∣served by the formal boasting and self-conceited Professor, whose knowledge only tends to puff him up, and makes him contemn and oppose whatever is contrived or acted tho' with inte∣grity of heart by any other of his Fellow-Soul∣diers in carrying on this Conflict against the King∣dom of Sin. We had need therefore to put up such a Petition as <HI>David</HI> did▪ <HI>Psal.</HI> 25. 21. <HI>Let integrity and uprightness preserve me?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001348_0025_0FB291B218DBC8E8"/>
The only USE I shall make of this Doctrine is this: It being our duty to resist &amp; strive against the whole Kingdom of Sin; it may hence be in∣ferred, that it is a great sin to <HI>discourage good men</HI> from endeavouring to suppress Vice, Immorality and Impiety. Numb. 32. 7, 8, 10. <HI>Wherefore dis∣courage ye the heart of the Children of </HI> Israel <HI>from going over; thus did your Fathers, and God's Anger was kindled against them.</HI> God's Anger was kind∣led both against those who discouraged the hearts of their brethren from going over to fight against the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> and against those who were dis∣couraged by them, v. 9, 10. which appears by God's threatning with an Oath, <HI>that none of those who came out of</HI> Egypt <HI>should see the promised Land,</HI> v. 11. which threatning was fulfilled; for those men who discouraged their brethren dyed of the plague before the Lord. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 37. and those also who were discouraged by them did bear their iniquities forty years, in that space were all of them consumed gradually. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 34, 35.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Joshua,</HI> who wholly followed the Lord, <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. 12. who made an excellent speech to encourage their bre∣thren to go up against the <HI>Canaanites.</HI> Numb. 14. 6. 9. &amp; pressed them thereunto with such zeal &amp; earnestness, that the multitude being provoked, bade stone them with stones, v. 10. These two were remarkably rescued out of the hands of the Multitude by an immediate appearance of the Glory of the Lord. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 10. &amp; were remark∣ably blessed of God with the preservation of their health and strength, and with admittance into the promised Land, <HI>Josh,</HI> 14. 6, 11.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Methods</HI> which those Spies took to discourage their brethren from Encountring with the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> are still in practice in the world, to discourage any brave attempt against the Kingdom of Sin: For instance.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="27" REF="001348_0026_0FB291B3824C6100"/>
1. Those Spies raised <HI>false Reports</HI> of the pro∣mised Land: Instead of saying the truth (as did <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Joshua</HI>) that it was a Land of <HI>Milk &amp; Honey,</HI> they gave a contrary account, namely, that it was a Land that <HI>eat up the Inhabitants thereof,</HI> Numb. 13. 32.</P>
<P>What false Reports and Misrepresentations are there made concerning the <HI>work</HI> of Reformation, the <HI>instruments</HI> of it, and <HI>methods</HI> of it? True se∣rious Godliness is misrepresented to be an un∣pleasant and burdensome life; and that there is not such need of restraining, curbing and subdu∣ing the Kingdom of Sin as some precise persons imagine; what is acted by Good men with ut∣most caution, prudence, affection and moderation is represented to be the effect of pride, censorious∣ness and pragmaticalness. Tho' <HI>David</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by an heroical faith, yet his Eldest Brother <HI>Elijah</HI> could tell him to his face, I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart, 1 <HI>Sam,</HI> 17. 28. The holy Apostles were cryed out against in those Terms, those that have turned the world apside down are come hither also, <HI>Acts.</HI> 17. 6. How di∣minutively will some speak of reformation work, as if they saw no beauty or glory therein?</P>
<P>And instead of moderating, qualifying and re∣gulating the zeal of good men (which thro' the remainders of Corruption in them, sometimes vents it self unseasonably or intemperately) men are too apt to use methods wholly to <HI>Extinguish</HI> zeal against sin in them, &amp; to reduce them either to such a <HI>Lukewarm</HI> frame of spirit as themselves are in, or to such a <HI>Timerousness of Spirit,</HI> that they dare not express their zeal against Vice any more; or so to <HI>prejudice others against them,</HI> as that they shall find themselves thereby incapaci∣tated from any further successful attempts against the Kingdom of Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. Those Spies reported that there were insupera∣ble
<PB N="28" REF="001348_0027_0FB291B500AB47A8"/>
difficulties in their way; so that there was no hope of making a Conquest of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> Deut. 1.28. <HI>Whither should we go up? our brethren have discouraged our hearts, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the City is great and walled up to Heaven, and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, how apt are men to discourage each other from any attempts against the weak∣ning of the kingdom of sin, and putting a stop to the growth of profaness? How many Lions are supposed to be in the way? One looks on it as a thing unattainable and impossible to be effected; that the Gospel in the Ministry and Ordinances thereof should be set up in such places where ig∣norance, Errors &amp; Profaness have had their king∣dom. Another Good man is afraid that purging the Temple, or sweeping some dirt out of it by Ecclesiastical Censures, will make the Temple it self fall down, or at least some of the carved work of it.</P>
<P>But a Christian Souldier should consider, that what is impossible to be done by men or outward means in themselves considered, may with the help, presence &amp; assistance of God be accomplish∣ed; so that in the way of dependance on God for his presence and blessing, according to the promi∣ses made to us thereof, the Christian Souldier may fall on and move forwards in the path of his du∣ty, with such an encouraged spirit as <HI>Paul</HI> had, Phil. 4. 13. <HI>I can do all things thro' Christ strength∣ning of me.</HI> He knoweth that when God is plea∣sed to <HI>work with</HI> mean &amp; weak instruments, then wonders shall be wrought, <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 20. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20.44.</P>
<P N="3">3. Those Spies discouraged <HI>Israel</HI> from going up against the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> by their own <HI>backward∣ness;</HI> their bad example set before their brethren, discouraged them from their duty</P>
<P>When those who should be File-leaders do fall
<PB N="29" REF="001348_0028_0FB291BA3591FD40"/>
back, and draw off in this War against Vice and Profaness, it disanimates others from falling on and pressing forwards against this Enemy? <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. <HI>Moses</HI> knew that if the two tribes and half absented themselves, the Army of <HI>Israel</HI> would not only be weakned as to <HI>number,</HI> but their <HI>Spi∣rits &amp; Courage</HI> would be weakned also: therefore <HI>Moses</HI> placed them in the Front of the Army, to lead on the rest in that Expedition. When Lea∣ding men absent themselves, and will not afford their presence and company to their brethren, nor contribute their advice to them how they should proceed in the affairs of Christ's Kingdom, and against the Kingdom of Sin, it is a very great discouragement unto them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Those Spies who discouraged their brethren from going up against the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> were the <HI>majority in number.</HI> There were only <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Joshua,</HI> who stood on the Lord's side; these two were opposed by the other ten; so that these two were in imminent danger of being sto<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the Mobile; who are sometimes led more by number of voices, then by weight of arguments. The Kingdom of Sin and Vice is much upheld by plu∣rality of voices, by noise and tumults. The Pha∣risees set the multitude against Christ, to cry out, <HI>Let him be Crucified,</HI> which was all the answer <HI>Pilot</HI> could get to that pertinent question, <HI>What hath he done?</HI> Mark 15. 14. It's a rare thing to hear of popular clamours against popular pre∣vailing Vices and Profaness, but not very rare to hear tumultuous noise against those who strive against, and resist sin, whereby they are disheart∣ned, and ready to say, <HI>I will speak no more in the name of the Lord;</HI> I will refrain my self even from that which is good, while such and such are before me.</P>
<P>Furthermore, As those Spies were acted by sin∣ful and carnal principles (&amp; <HI>Moses</HI> suspected the
<PB N="30" REF="001348_0029_0FB291BD784211B0"/>
two tribes and half whom he treats with, in <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. to be acting from like evil principles) so from the same or like principles are men still acted, who discourage others from making a vi∣gorous opposition to the Kingdom of Sin in the world. Take a few instances.</P>
<P N="1">1. Those Spies were overcome with carnal fear. <HI>Numb.</HI> 13. 21. <HI>We are not able to go up against this people, for they are stronger than we; all the people we saw in the land are men of great stature, we were in their sight as grashoppers, &amp;c.</HI> And being af∣frighted themselves, they became ready instru∣ments to discourage their brethren: So in the Spiritual War against the Kingdom of Sin, Cow∣ardise doth great hurt. <HI>The fear of man is a snare,</HI> Prov. 29.25. Hence it is that many become par∣takers of other mens sins, because they are afraid to offend them by giving them a seasonable re∣proof, or using proper means to restrain &amp; reform them; and by such fearfulness and faint-heart∣edness they discourage others, who justly expect that men of Eminency in Gifts, Offices, in Age, and in Grace, should be most forward Witnesses for Christ against growing vice.</P>
<P N="2">2. The ground of that fear in those Spies was this; They lookt on the work before them with an eye of carnal sence, &amp; not with an eye of faith. The unbelieving Spies could tell what they saw with their bodily eyes; whereas believing <HI>Caleb</HI> &amp; <HI>Joshua</HI> did put their brethren in mind of God's promise. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.9. that all those people should be bread for <HI>Israel, for their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us;</HI> and therefore exhorted their brethren not to fear them: The true reason why that Generation did not enter into the Land of Rest, was because of their un∣belief, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.6. The Victory which the Christian Souldier hath over the slavish fear of man is his faith: <HI>He that puts his trust in the Lord, shall be
<PB N="31" REF="001348_0030_0FB291BEB6675A58"/>
safe, Prov.</HI> 29. 25. When faith is weak, then the hands hang down and the knees grow feeble, &amp; men are unfit to do any great matter in this com∣bate against sin; and very ready then to weaken the hands of others that would be active therein; whereas those who have faith in due exercise in their own hearts will be strengthning others in their Christian Warfare, as <HI>Jonathan</HI> did <HI>David;</HI> he went into the wilderness to him, &amp; encoura∣ged him, &amp; <HI>strengthned his hand in God,</HI> 1Sa 23.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Moses</HI> suspected the two Tribes and half to be acted by a <HI>slothful</HI> flame of spirit: that they were loth to take the pains to make a further conquest of <HI>Canaan,</HI> Numb. 32. that therefore they rather chose to content themselves with less Land, being already conquered, than to undergo the difficulties of conquering more.</P>
<P>A slothful frame of spirit, and <HI>love of ease</HI> makes many sit still and do nothing for the re∣straining of Vice, and curbing of it; and such are apt to discourage others from such attempts wherein they foresee dangers and difficulties, will encounter them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Moses</HI> suspected the two Tribes and half that petitioned for the Land on this side <HI>Jordan</HI> for their Inheritance, to be acted by a <HI>covetous &amp; earthly mind;</HI> for that was some of the best Land in all <HI>Canaan</HI> which was then conquered, there∣fore they made great haste to put in their Petiti∣on for that Land; and tho' they purged them∣selves to <HI>Moses</HI> at this time, yet some think their hearts might be too much set upon the Soil granted unto them, and that therefore they were of the first that were afterwards carried into Captivity.</P>
<P>Many having obtained a good portion in this world, will not expose themselves to any diffi∣culty in resisting the kingdom of sin, not trouble themselves which of those two Kingdom; pros∣per
<PB N="32" REF="001348_0031_0FB291C036964DE0"/>
most in the world, whether the Kingdom of Heaven, or the Kingdom of Sin. Such whose Hearts are set on Earthly things, have been wont to make great opposition to the progress of the Gospel. <HI>Acts</HI> 19. 24, 29. So those that love the world better than they love their Souls, are content to live without a Gospel Ministry and means of Grace, on this account, because they think it will save charges.</P>
<P N="5">5. Possibly <HI>Moses</HI> might suspect those two Tribes and half to act from a principle of direct <HI>Rebellion</HI> against the positive Command of God. <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. 10. <HI>Thus did your Fore-fathers,</HI> faith <HI>Mo∣ses:</HI> Now their Fore-fathers were guilty of plain rebellion against God. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 4. 9. <HI>Only rebel not ye against the Lord. Moses</HI> suspected the same rebellious frame of spirit to be in them he now treated with, which mightly hid under the cloak of their fair and specious pretences; He was a∣fraid left there lay rooted in their hearts a prin∣ciple of prevailing Enmity against God's positive Commands.</P>
<P>This is one chief cause why men discourage one another from vigorous essays and attempts to batter down the kingdom of sin, because there is in their hearts a secret enmity against Religion in the power of it, and against the ways of Ho∣liness, and a secret love to the ways and works of darkness; when such enmity appears in the visible &amp; vilest expressions and effects of it, it de∣serves such treatment as <HI>Paul</HI> gave to <HI>Elymas,</HI> Acts 13. 8, 10. But where if lies hid and latent, we had need take pains to examine our hearts &amp; find it out and mortify it; for doubtless we have more sin lurking in our hearts than we our selves are apt to be aware of.</P>
<P>Let us examine our selves, how far each of us have been guilty of discouraging others from u∣sing their best endeavours to suppress Vice, and
<PB N="33" REF="001348_0032_0FB291C1B4B8A4A0"/>
to restrain Immorality and Profaness, Let's mourn for our own slothfulness, backwardness, unbelief and earthly-mindedness, and the secret enmity in our hearts against serious Religion. Let us fear and tremble lest we should be any way guilty for time to come of discouraging o∣thers from a vigorous discharge of their duty: Let's think of that awful word which <HI>Moses</HI> adds, <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. 15. <HI>And ye shall destroy all this people. One Sinner destroys much good,</HI> Eccl. 9. 18. A few persons who discourage others from walk∣ing in ways of Obedience to God's Commands, may be justly charged by God as the authors of the ruin and destruction of the whole Generati∣on, whereof they themselves are a part. Tho' that whole Generation that were discouraged by those ten Spies were themselves destroyed in the Wilderness, <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. 13. yet the ten Spies were made the peculiar Monuments of Divine Venge∣ance: So were <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company, who led the Congregation into rebellion against God. <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. So the Sons of <HI>Eli,</HI> that were wicked, and were instruments of leading others into sin, and causing the ways of God's Worship to be abhorred, they were remarkably punished by the Lord. Let us fear then lest this Indictment should be drawn up against us; ye have destroyed all this people by discouraging them from a thorow serious and effectual opposition to the Kingdom of Sin.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with a very few words to the Honourable GENTLEMEN of the ARTILLE∣RY COMPANY, who obliged me to appear be∣fore them this day.</P>
<P>I doubt not of their Ingenuity to accept of this discourse, as not wholly disagreeable to the pre∣sent Occasion; seeing they have been accustom'd to have a Religious Improvement made of the Military Art and Terms on such Opportunities

<P N="1">1. <HI>Be Entreated to make good your Leaders ground.</HI> There have been men of the former Generation in this Land, not only Eminent in their skill in the Art Military, but also Eminent Souldiers of Christ; But they are removed from off the Stage, very few of the former Generation are now sur∣viving: While they Lived, they Served not meerly their own self-interests, but they served their Generation; and did with Zeal, Courage, Wisdom and Discretion endeavour, in their seve∣ral Posts and Stations to lead that Generation whereof they were a part) to the Heavenly <HI>Ca∣naan.</HI> They were true <HI>Calebs</HI> and <HI>Joshua's,</HI> who did wholly follow the Lord.</P>

Your selves are now Risen up in their stead, to be leading and influencing men in the present Generation, May the God of Heaven, who hath the residue of the Spirit, pour it out abundantly on your selves, that you may by your Works and Words, and Tears, and Faith, and Prayers, both severally and joyntly, with affection and discre∣tion, with patience and integrity of heart, pro∣secute the War of our Lord Messiah against the Kingdom of Sin: That we may still have reason to bless God, that tho' the Old Generation of Christian Souldiers are removed from us, to in∣herit a Crown of Glory; yet the God of our Fore-fathers is still with us and among us, in∣fluencing the hearts of our Leading Men of all Ranks and Orders, to Lead us towards Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Be Entreated to Consider,</HI> That the Body of this People in <HI>New-England</HI> being so remarkably multiplied and encreased in number; and most of the aged and experienced Christians being re∣moved out of the World, who were wont to Counsel, Exhort, Direct &amp; Steady others into the right path of Holiness: Unless God be pleased to spirit some younger Christians (and many of them too) to be forward and zealous in Ex∣horting others to their duty, and in dehorting and restraining others from Vice; The present Standing and Rising Generation of young per∣sons will be in a miserable Condition, for want of help. The Kingdom of Sin will get head very fast among us, and will overtop Vertue; Ignorance, Error and Vice will prevail; yea, the very form of Religion will be laid aside, unless God do spirit some of the younger Christians, and qualify them to stand in the front of the Battel against Vice; to march forward and put forth themselves with their utmost force and influence, for the curbing and restraining of Vice, and encouraging of Vertue and Piety.</P>

3. Consider that God having made a gracious promise that he will yet new form and reform a Degenerate People for himself, <HI>and they shall shew forth his praise,</HI> Isa. 43. 21. It will be <HI>your Glory</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> to be any way subservient to the promoting of this great and glorious work; and those that approve themselves faithful Ser∣vants of Christ in their Stations and Generati∣ons, shall not fail of that Crown of Glory which fadeth not away, which Christ hath prepared for, and promised to those that fight the good fight, and keep the faith.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding all the discourage∣ments which lie in the way to weaken the Hearts, the Carriage, the force and activity of Good men in opposing the Kingdom of Sin; yet we may boldly say to them as <HI>Azariah</HI> did to <HI>Asa,</HI> and <HI>to all Judah and Benjamin.</HI> 2 <HI>Chr.</HI> 15. 2, 7. <HI>The Lord is with you while you be with him;</HI> (i. e. in pursuing the work of Reformation, which they were then Enterprising) <HI>if ye seek him he will be found of you.</HI> Be you strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded.</P>
