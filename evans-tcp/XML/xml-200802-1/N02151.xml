<P>A MOST Unhappy Condition it is, that is now Described unto us! May the <HI>Describing</HI> of it, help our <HI>Avoiding</HI> of it.</P>
<P>It is threatned, as a very <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition,</HI> Deut. XXVIII. 66. <HI>Thy Life shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shalt fear day and night, &amp; thou shalt have no Assurance of thy Life.</HI> And yet in this very <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition,</HI> what Multitudes are Languishing! Alas, 'Tis but here &amp; there as it were <HI>One of a City, Two of a Tribe,</HI> that is not Languishing in it. Yea, The Li<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e which <HI>hangs in doubt before</HI> the Children of men, and whereof they <HI>have no Assurance,</HI> is not meerly that <HI>Life</HI> in this World, which a <HI>man would give all that he has,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002559_0003_0FDB6F9B062B9318"/>
to have it <HI>Assured.</HI> But the thing which they are <HI>in the Dark</HI> about, is, Whether that <HI>Favour of GOD</HI> in another World, which is <HI>Better than Life,</HI> shall not be denied unto them; And whether they shall not after <HI>Death</HI> pass into those Torments in another World, whereof the most Intolera∣ble Things here are but a <HI>Metaphor.</HI> They are <HI>Walking</HI> on, but in such a woful <HI>Darkness</HI> that they <HI>know not whither they are going.</HI> They do indeed <HI>know,</HI> That the <HI>Grave</HI> is a place, <HI>whither they are going.</HI> But it is only their <HI>Bodies</HI> that are going thither. Their <HI>Souls</HI> which are the <HI>Immortal</HI> part of them; Do they <HI>know whither these are going</HI>? Every one may say, <HI>I know, that GOD will bring me to Death.</HI> But where are they; how few, how few are they, that <HI>Know,</HI> what the Glorious GOD will do with them <HI>after Death?</HI> Yea, They <HI>Know,</HI> that when their <HI>Dust returns to the Earth as it was,</HI> their <HI>Spirits</HI> will <HI>Return to GOD</HI> who is the <HI>Father of Spirits.</HI> But <HI>know</HI> they how the Glorious GOD will then dis∣pose of their <HI>Spirits,</HI> and what <HI>Receptacles</HI> whether <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Bad,</HI> He will order for them? On all accounts <HI>Hidden Receptacles</HI>! I make an awful Appeal unto my dear Neighbours in this Great Assembly, for whom, <HI>O Lord, Thou seest my Agony</HI>; My Friends I Appeal to you; If the <HI>Angel of Death</HI> were this day to

Execute his Instructions upon you, do you <HI>know</HI> what your <HI>Future State</HI> would be, whether a <HI>Blessed State</HI> or a <HI>Wretched State?</HI> If it should be your Portion like <HI>Ananias</HI> &amp; <HI>Sapphira,</HI> to fall down <HI>Dead</HI> in the Assembly, do you know, that you shall not have a porti∣on with <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira</HI> after <HI>Death,</HI> as∣sign'd unto you? The Days of the <HI>Dead</HI> are called, <HI>The Days of Darkness.</HI> But alas, while we yet Enjoy the <HI>Light of the Living,</HI> we are generally still in <HI>Darkness,</HI> and much <HI>in the Dark</HI> about that GRAND PO<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>NT what our <HI>Many Days</HI> will be, whether <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Bad</HI> after we are <HI>Dead.</HI> Let it not be thought Un∣charitable or too censorious, when I say unto you; I Doubt, I Doubt, there are not many among you, that can cheerfully Entertain the <HI>Messengers of Death,</HI> &amp; can with more Pleasure than Horror, hear the <HI>Roaring of the Lion,</HI> and say, <HI>My Friend, Thou art Welcome to me. I know, that my Redeemer Lives, and thou art come to fetch me into the Paradise, where I shall see His Face with Joy Ʋnspeakable and Full of Glory!</HI> At Least, I Fear, I Fear, there are many of you, who, if the <HI>Arrest of Death</HI> were laid upon them, the <HI>Terror of Death</HI> alone would be E∣nough to kill them; and they would <HI>chatter like a Crane or a Swallow,</HI> and <HI>mourn like a Dove</HI> going to be pull'd out of <HI>their nest</HI>; &amp; cry out, <HI>Oh! I am in the Dark, I am in the Dark; and for
<PB N="4" REF="002559_0005_0FDB6FA040FD0D40"/>
ought I Know, I am going down to Eternal Dark∣ness.</HI> When I behold, the amazing <HI>Uncertain∣ty</HI> about the GRAND POINT wherein our dear People allow themselves to continue Unresolved, and how Commonly and Easily People continue all their Days, <HI>Uncertain,</HI> &amp; altogether <HI>in the Dark,</HI> what shall become of them in an awful ETERNITY before them; I am Afflicted, I am Distressed, I am Astonish∣ed. It is a CASE that calls for the most A∣wakening <HI>Expostulations.</HI></P>
<P>And as a Foundation for them, I take the Solemn Words of our SAVIOUR, which are now before us. Words, wherein our SAVI∣OUR Laments the <HI>Ʋnhappy condition</HI> of them, who <HI>walk in Darkness, &amp; know not whither they are going.</HI> Words, which give this DOC∣TRINE unto us,
<Q>Very Unhappy, Very Unhappy, is the condition of them, who walk so much in the Dark, that they know not whither they we going; but are very much in the Dark, what shall become of them at the Last.</Q></P>
<P>There is a Double, But, Oh! what a Dread∣ful <HI>Darkness,</HI> in which the poor Children of Men, are frequently found <HI>Walking</HI> and <HI>Know not</HI> where it Leads them, or how it will Ter∣minate.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="002559_0006_0FDB6FA1C13130E8"/>I. There is the <HI>Darkness</HI> of a <HI>False Religion,</HI> which makes a very <HI>Unhappy Condition</HI> for Mul∣titudes in the World; Multitudes who <HI>walk in Darkness, &amp; Know not whither they are going.</HI> Man is, <HI>Animal Religiosum,</HI> a creature naturally disposed unto <HI>Religion</HI>; He must lay aside his <HI>Nature,</HI> if he be not of some <HI>Religion.</HI> But man has by his Fall from GOD, so Enfeebled, yea, so Corrupted &amp; Poisoned his mind that <HI>his Understanding being darkened,</HI> a <HI>False Religion</HI> is now most agreeable unto him. Having also resigned himself up unto the <HI>Dominion</HI> of those <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> which are <HI>by the wrath of GOD</HI> now become the <HI>Rulers of the Darkness of this World,</HI> these conspire as much as may be by their <HI>Devices</HI> to hold him in the chains of a <HI>False Religion.</HI> Tis now come to pass; <HI>Darkness covers the Earth, and Gross Darkness the People.</HI> The most of Mankind are by the <HI>Unsearchable Judgments</HI> of GOD, now so a∣bandoned, that they are in the <HI>Ʋnhappy Con∣dition</HI> of the Jews, who sought unto <HI>Egypt</HI> for the Succours which were to be found from GOD alone; Jer. XIII. 16. <HI>Your Feet Stumble on the Dark Mountains, &amp; when ye look for light, it is turned into the Shadow of Death, and made a Gross Darkness</HI> The only <HI>True Religion,</HI> in which alone Man can <HI>Return unto GOD,</HI> it is but a little part of Mankind, that is <HI>Enlight∣ned</HI> with it. <HI>Our Gospel is hid</HI> from the most
<PB N="6" REF="002559_0007_0FDB6FA568F28F28"/>
of Men; &amp; so they are still <HI>Walking in Dark∣ness.</HI> They are always <HI>in the Dark▪</HI> what to do that GOD may be Pleased with them; <HI>in the Dark,</HI> about the Methods of paying un∣to GOD an <HI>Acceptable Service.</HI> They do not <HI>know the Way of peace,</HI> nor <HI>know the Way to the City of</HI> GOD. In the <HI>Greatness of their Folly</HI> they <HI>Wander from the Way of Ʋnderstanding.</HI> They are as much <HI>in the Dark,</HI> whether what they do be at all pleasing to GOD: <HI>in the Dark,</HI> what will be the Issue of all their <HI>Service.</HI> They have on Reasonable Expectations of a <HI>Joyful Harvest,</HI> for their Devotions. All is cloudy with them; all Dubious They have no clear <HI>Knowlege</HI> of those things <HI>which to know is Life Eternal</HI>; And by the <HI>Look</HI> of it, they are <HI>Destroyed</HI>; How Lamentably, How Deplorably! As they Live, so they Dy, <HI>All in the Dark.</HI> In this <HI>Unhappy Condition,</HI> alas, the most of Men are perishing.</P>
<P>But then, O ye Inhabitants of a <HI>Goshen,</HI> How Thankfully ought you to adore the <HI>So∣vereign Grace</HI> of GOD, in granting you the <HI>Light</HI> of His Gospel, when so much of the World, is yet Lying in <HI>Egyptian Darkness</HI>! My Friends; Let our Thankful Souls, wisely Improve the <HI>Light</HI> with which we are favour∣ed: &amp; so <HI>Walk in the Light,</HI> that no <HI>False Re∣ligion</HI> may ever <HI>Darken</HI> us, We Enjoy the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD, in His <HI>Written Word; Oracles</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002559_0008_0FDB6FA665039218"/>
of so Sublime and so Sacred a character, that they carry an Incontestible Evidence with them, of their being, of a <HI>Divine Original.</HI> In these <HI>Oracles</HI> we have a <HI>Light for our Feet,</HI> a <HI>Lamp for our Pathes.</HI> We are safe, and we shall <HI>do well,</HI> if we <HI>Take heed unto</HI> this word, as unto a <HI>Light Shining in a Dark place.</HI> It will infallibly <HI>give Light unto them that sit in Dark∣ness,</HI> and <HI>guide their Feet in the Way of peace.</HI> But then in these <HI>Oracles</HI> we have a CHRIST Revealed unto us: A CHRIST who is the <HI>Light of the World</HI>; A CHRIST who is the <HI>Sun of Righteousness.</HI> Oh! Let us be under His Conduct; and by <HI>His Light</HI> we shall <HI>Walk thro' Darkness.</HI> Now we <HI>Walk in the Light,</HI> &amp; we <HI>Know whither we are going,</HI> we take Right steps, and we <HI>Know that we have Eternal Life.</HI> My Friends, that you may not <HI>walk in Dark∣ness and see no Light,</HI> the Counsel to you, is This; <HI>Fear the Lord,</HI> as His word has taught you, <HI>Obey the Voice of your</HI> SAVIOUR, who has appeared as the <HI>Servant</HI> of GOD. Then may you <HI>Trust in the Lord,</HI> and <HI>Stay upon your GOD</HI> that you shall not be deceived.</P>
<P>Christian, Steer thy course by the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> which are <HI>Able to make thee wise unto Salvation,</HI> &amp; let thine <HI>Eyes be continually</HI> unto thy SAVIOUR; Then mayest thou certainly <HI>Know whither thou art going.</HI> Now, <HI>Know</HI> for certain, Thou art <HI>Going</HI> in the <HI>Way of Life.
<PB N="8" REF="002559_0009_0FDB6FA7F1F1DBB0"/>
Know</HI> for certain, Thou art <HI>Going</HI> to the <HI>In∣heritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> Go on▪ and go Singing the <HI>Songs</HI> of thy Holy <HI>Pilgrimage</HI>; Go on, and let me bear thee Company.</P>
<P N="2">II. But this is not the <HI>Darkness,</HI> which my Neighbours are in much Danger of. You have all the Demonstrations which a <HI>Reason∣able Mind</HI> can ask for, That you are not un∣der the <HI>Dark Delusions</HI> of a <HI>False Religion.</HI> You are delivered from that <HI>Unhappy condition,</HI> by a JESUS in His BIBLE <HI>Evidently set forth before your Eyes.</HI> Tis another <HI>Darkness</HI> which makes an <HI>Ʋnhappy condition</HI> for us, who have the <HI>True Religion</HI> illuminating of us. Tis the <HI>Darkness,</HI> of our own <HI>Uncertainty</HI> about our own <HI>Condition,</HI> in that <HI>Future State</HI> unto which all of us are hastening; The <HI>Darkness</HI> where∣in we <HI>walk, Not knowing whither we are going</HI>: Our <HI>Not knowing</HI> whether our <HI>Future State</HI> will be in the <HI>Glorious Rest which</HI> our SAVIOUR will <HI>give</HI> to those that <HI>come</HI> unto Him, or whether our <HI>Future State</HI> will be in the <HI>Fiery Furnace</HI> which the <HI>Things that offend,</HI> and they <HI>which do Iniquity, shall be cast into.</HI> Our <HI>present State</HI> is a <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Probation.</HI> And according to our Behaviour, in the <HI>Time of our Trial</HI> here, we shall when this <HI>Time</HI> is come, and it quickly comes unto an <HI>End,</HI> we shall be Judg∣ed unto a <HI>Future State</HI> which will be either a <HI>State</HI> of inexpressible <HI>Bliss</HI> or a <HI>State</HI> of unut∣terable
<PB N="9" REF="002559_0010_0FDB6FABDF4C2560"/>
<HI>We,</HI> that will never have an <HI>End.</HI> Now This is the <HI>Ʋnhappy condition</HI> of the most among us: We so poorly Behave our selves, in the <HI>Time of our Trial,</HI> that we <HI>know not</HI> what <HI>State</HI> we are going into; Whether it will be a <HI>Blissful State,</HI> or whether it will be a <HI>Woful State,</HI> wherein we are even to all <HI>Eternity,</HI> to have our Lodging assign'd unto us. We are not <HI>in the Dark</HI> about the <HI>Event</HI> of <HI>Godliness</HI> or of <HI>Wickedness,</HI> in the <HI>Future State.</HI> We <HI>Know</HI> very well, That the <HI>Godly</HI> are <HI>going</HI> to a <HI>State,</HI> wherein they shall find <HI>Fulness of Joy &amp; Pleasures forevermore.</HI> We <HI>Know</HI> very well, That the <HI>Wicked</HI> are <HI>going</HI> to a <HI>State,</HI> wherein they shall find a <HI>Strange Punishment reserved for the workers of Iniquity.</HI> But the <HI>Darkness</HI> wherein we are <HI>Walking,</HI> is, that we <HI>know not</HI> our <HI>own share</HI> in the matter; For the most part, we <HI>know not,</HI> whether it be the portion of the <HI>Godly,</HI> or whether it be the portion of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> that we are going unto. Tis no wonder, that a pagan Emperor, when he felt himself a dying, should cry out, [<HI>Animu∣la—quae nunc abibis in Loca</HI>!] O <HI>my poor Soul, Whither, whither, art thou now</HI> a going. But that we, who are in the Christian Profession, should any of us, <HI>Walk in such Darkness,</HI> that if we were to Dy this Day, we must cry out, <HI>Oh! My poor Soul, I don't know whither it is go∣ing</HI>! O <HI>Unhappy Condition!</HI> A famous Apostle
<PB N="10" REF="002559_0011_0FDB6FAD05754EF0"/>
of <HI>Irreligion</HI> and <HI>Impiety</HI> in our Nation, when he felt himself a Dying, tis reported that he used those words, <HI>I am going to take a great Leap in the Dark.</HI> But now, for them that have <HI>done Many things</HI> required in Christiani∣ty still to <HI>Walk in such darkness,</HI> that if their <HI>Death</HI> were now to come upon them, it must be, <HI>A Great Leap in the Dark</HI>! O <HI>Ʋnhappy Con∣dition!</HI></P>
<P>There are Two Things that shall now be Enquired, &amp; briefly Answered, about it.</P>
<P>We will Enquire, First; Whence it comes to pass, that so many are in the <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition</HI>; to be in the <HI>Dark,</HI> how it shall fare with them in the <HI>Future State!</HI> Now,</P>
<P>First <HI>The Earth with its Bars, is about them forever.</HI> The Enchantments &amp; Amusements of <HI>This World</HI> keep the most of us from that <HI>Religion in Earnest,</HI> which alone will <HI>settle Good Terms with Heaven</HI> for us. Tis nothing but <HI>Religion in Earnest,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Seeking the Fa∣vour</HI> of GOD <HI>with our whole Heart,</HI> that will assure us of our being in His <HI>Favour.</HI> Would we be assur'd of our Entring in at the <HI>Straight Gate?</HI> Our SAVIOUR has insisted on this Direction; <HI>Luck▪</HI> XIII. 24 <HI>Strive,</HI> and be in <HI>Agony</HI> for it. Now, <HI>This World</HI> so Bewitches us, and the <HI>Business</HI> of <HI>This World</HI> so Engages us; that we afford no room for this <HI>Agony.</HI> Our <HI>Agony</HI> is upon, <HI>What shall I Eat or Drink,
<PB N="11" REF="002559_0012_0FDB6FAE9633DE50"/>
&amp; wherewithal shall I be Cloathed?</HI> This Extin∣tinguishes the due <HI>Agony</HI> upon, <HI>What shall I do to be Saved</HI>? The Ancient complaint may be renewed in every Generation, <HI>There is none who Stirs up himself to take hold on GOD.</HI> What hinders? Tis <HI>This World</HI>; The Affairs, and the Hurries, of <HI>This World,</HI> Engross our Spirits, &amp; weaken our concern about <HI>Another World</HI> We are so Swallowed up in the cares to make sure of <HI>This World,</HI> that we foolishly forget, shamefully neglect, the Needful En∣deavours to make sure of a part in a <HI>Better World▪</HI> We are always <HI>Grinding</HI> for <HI>This World</HI>; and let <HI>Satan</HI> alone to keep always filling the <HI>Hopper</HI> for us. Hence tis, that we have truly <HI>No Heart,</HI> &amp; then falsely pretend that we have <HI>No Time,</HI> to <HI>Stir up our selves,</HI> that we may <HI>lay Hold on Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. People generally go to <HI>Settle Good Terms with Heaven,</HI> on the <HI>Terms</HI> of the <HI>old Covenant.</HI> The Invitation of the Gospel, is, O <HI>chief of Sinners, come Immediately unto thy SAVIOƲR. Let thy Heart with His Help consent unto it, That thy SAVIOƲR should make thee Righteous and Holy. Ʋpon this con∣sent then take up a comfortable perswasion, that thy SAVIOƲR will surely do thee Good.</HI> People thro' the <HI>Pride</HI> of a <HI>carnal Mind</HI> have an Aver∣sion for this <HI>Way of GOD.</HI> They will go on, it may be all their Days, doing some <HI>Duties,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002559_0013_0FDB6FB015A12BA0"/>
which they know themselves bound unto. Yea, They will take <HI>Pains</HI> in the <HI>Duties.</HI> But what are their <HI>Aims</HI> in all the <HI>Pains</HI>? They <HI>Aim</HI> at making themselves a <HI>Righteousness</HI>; or at least, they <HI>Aim</HI> at those Attainments, which may Qualify them for, &amp; Recommend them to, a kind Reception with their SAVI∣OUR. They durst not come to their SA∣VIOUR, or be well perswaded of His Receiving them, until they have gone thro' a <HI>course of Duties,</HI> and led such <HI>Regular Lives</HI> as may be∣speak a kind Reception with their SAVIOUR for them. This <HI>Preposterous Proceeding</HI> has too much of the <HI>Old Covenant</HI> in it: And yet even some that have the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> really in their Hearts, may have the Spirit of the <HI>Old Covenant</HI> working too much in them Now of this <HI>Old Covenant</HI> we shall still find, what we read; Gal. IV. 24. <HI>It genders unto Bondage.</HI> It begets nothing but a <HI>Fear of Death,</HI> and of Wrath, which will <HI>hold us in Bendage all our Days.</HI> Tis nothing but the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> wisely Understood, &amp; Embraced, &amp; Applied, that will <HI>speak Peace</HI> unto us. People don't come off Entirely from the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> into the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> And they can do no other than <HI>Walk in Darkness,</HI> while they have the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> in any operation upon them.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Many are Patient &amp; Easy, while
<PB N="13" REF="002559_0014_0FDB6FB481C2A730"/>
they do not <HI>Settle Good Terms with Heaven,</HI> under a <HI>Slothful pretence</HI> of <HI>waiting</HI> till GOD shall please to give some <HI>Assurance of His Love</HI> unto them. Tis true, we shall not know our selves to be the <HI>Children of</HI> GOD, until that Priviledge be granted us; Rom. VIII. 16. <HI>The Spirit beareth witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of GOD.</HI> But then, How is this <HI>Witness</HI> to be <HI>waited</HI> for? Surely, not with the meet <HI>Desire of the Sluggard, refusing to Labour</HI> for it: Not with a Soul that can be <HI>Quiet</HI> without it; Not counting it enough with a faint, mean, melancholy Tone to say, <HI>Ay, It is a good Thing, if one could Attain to it. It is well for them that can Attain to it. I must wait until it please</HI> GOD <HI>that I shall Attain to it</HI>! And is this all that you have to say, <HI>ye Slug∣gard</HI>? It must be <HI>waited for!</HI> But, How <HI>waited for?</HI> Syrs, It must be <HI>Groaned for</HI>; It must be <HI>Wrestled for,</HI> it must be Earnestly <HI>Laboured</HI> for. The GOD who <HI>waits to be Gracious,</HI> will be <HI>waited</HI> for. But in our <HI>waiting</HI> on Him, to <HI>Satisfy</HI> us with some Glimpse of His <HI>Law</HI> unto us, our Importunity must be Vehe∣ment, be Violent, be Unpacifiable. The cry must be, <HI>O Satisfy us Early with thy Mercy</HI>! Yea, the cry must be, <HI>Hear me Speedily, O Lord, my Spirit faileth: Hide not thy Face from me.</HI> About a matter of some weight, it was of old said, <HI>The Man will not be at Rest until he
<PB N="14" REF="002559_0015_0FDB6FB602D7EBA8"/>
has finished the Thing.</HI> A matter infinitely more weighty, is that of getting into this <HI>Peace</HI> of GOD: And it should be said of him that is <HI>waiting</HI> on GOD for it; <HI>The man will not be at Rest until the Thing is finished.</HI> Few, Few, are such <HI>Importunate waiters.</HI> Many▪ content themselves with a Liftless, Lazy, Drowsy <HI>waiting.</HI> And they Speed accor∣dingly.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Even they that are truely <HI>Turn∣ed from Darkness to Light and from the power of Satan unto GOD,</HI> may be liable to this <HI>Ʋnhap∣py Condition</HI>: But Frequently, yea, Common∣ly their <HI>Darkness</HI> is a <HI>Chastisement</HI> from GOD upon them. GOD is herein for their Mis∣carriages <HI>Chastising</HI> of them Indeed, there may be sometimes a Display of <HI>Sovereignty</HI> in it. The Glorious GOD may <HI>hide his Face</HI> from them who are the <HI>Dearly Beloved of His Soul</HI>: and then <HI>how Great the Darkness</HI>! The Best man Living in the World, may be left unto such <HI>Darkness,</HI> as to conclude, <HI>GOD counteth me for His Enemy</HI>! But yet for the most part, the Children of GOD may <HI>Thank Themselves</HI> for it, when they are <HI>in the Dark</HI> about it, whether GOD will own them for His Children. For the Iniquity of their Covetous∣ness, I hide My self, and am wroth with them, says the GOD, who will not let them <HI>know that He has Loved them.</HI> We are advised
<PB N="15" REF="002559_0016_0FDB6FBC5B379B08"/>
Eph. IV. 30. <HI>Grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby ye are Sealed unto the Day of Redemption.</HI> We are <HI>Sealed</HI> by the <HI>Holy Spirit of GOD,</HI> when we are filled by Him, with an Hopeful, Joy∣ful, Sanctifying <HI>Assurance,</HI> That our GOD <HI>has Loved us with an Everlasting Love,</HI> &amp; that He will give us to see a <HI>Day of Redemption</HI> from all that is a Trouble unto us. But we Blot our <HI>Evidences</HI> for Heaven, by our Manifold Irregularities. By not Maintaining a Watch∣ful, Fruitful, Humble <HI>Walk with GOD,</HI> We <HI>Grieve the Holy Spirit of GOD</HI> By our In∣dulging our selves in carnal <HI>Passions,</HI> and by too Eagerly <HI>Minding of Earthly Things,</HI> We <HI>Grieve the Holy Spirit of GOD.</HI> By our Inor∣dinate fondness for <HI>Creatures</HI> and <HI>Lightly E∣steeming the Rock of our Salvation,</HI> We <HI>Grieve the Holy Spirit of GOD.</HI> The <HI>Grieved Spirit,</HI> who should be our <HI>Comforter</HI> now <HI>departs</HI> from us. And, <HI>Wo to them, when I depart from them, saith the Lord.</HI> His <HI>withdraw</HI> makes a <HI>Dark Time</HI> with us. <HI>Desertions</HI> which Leave an <HI>Hor∣ror of Darkness</HI> upon us, these are some of the <HI>Punishments</HI> which the <HI>Grieved Spirit</HI> inflicts on His own, when He will <HI>Visit their Iniquity with Stripes,</HI> tho' He do <HI>not utterly take away His Loving kindness from them.</HI> The <HI>Holy</HI> One offended at His faulty Children, Says up∣on it, <HI>I will punish them, with such Darkness upon them, that they shall not be able to Read their Names

written in the Book of Life; not be able to See, that I have any purposes of Mercy for them.</HI> So does the <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition</HI> come upon us.</P>
<P>We will Enquire, Secondly; What is the <HI>Unhappiness</HI> of this <HI>Condition</HI>; For People to be <HI>in the Dark,</HI> whether their <HI>Future State,</HI> must be in a <HI>Glad,</HI> or in a <HI>Sad</HI> Eternity.</P>
<P>Now,</P>
<P>First; A <HI>Darkness</HI> on our Minds, whether we are <HI>in Good Terms with Heaven,</HI> or no, it must needs bring a <HI>Weakness</HI> on our Essays to <HI>Love</HI> GOD, &amp; <HI>Live</HI> unto Him. It was a lust Remark; Neh VIII 10. <HI>The Joy of the Lord is your Strength.</HI> The <HI>Joy</HI> of a Soul Reconcil∣ed unto GOD, and knowing, yea, feeling it self <HI>Bound up in the Bundle of Life,</HI> Oh! how it would <HI>Strengthen</HI> us to <HI>Walk with our GOD,</HI> Yea, How would it <HI>Enlarge our Hearts</HI> to <HI>Run</HI> in the <HI>Ways</HI> commanded of GOD! This <HI>Joy</HI> would be the <HI>Life of our hand,</HI> in doing the <HI>Works of GOD</HI> which our <HI>Hand finds to do,</HI> &amp; would cause us to <HI>Sing in the Ways of the Lord.</HI> When we Hear our GOD saying to us, <HI>Be comforted, Thy Sins are Forgiven thee</HI>! Nothing will have such a Tendency to render all <HI>Sins</HI> Bitter and Hateful unto us. GOD <HI>Speaking Peace</HI> to us, this more than any thing will keep us from <HI>Returning to Folly</HI> any more. When tis testified unto us, That GOD has made us <HI>Heirs of the Kingdom which He has

promised for them that Love Him,</HI> there will soon be Testimonies, <HI>How Holily, and Righteously, and Unblameably, we shall behave our selves.</HI> Did we know that we are <HI>Bound for Heaven,</HI> and that we have <HI>all the Spiritual Bles∣sings of the Heavenly places</HI> reserved for us, what <HI>Heavenly Tempers</HI> would be thereby pro∣duced in us! How should we have our <HI>Conver∣sation in Heaven</HI> while we are on the <HI>Earth</HI>: &amp; Soar, &amp; Fly, &amp; Mount up <HI>as with the wings of Eagles</HI> thither! All the <HI>Delights</HI> of <HI>Earth,</HI> &amp; all the <HI>Troubles</HI> of <HI>Earth,</HI> how Mortified, how Indifferent, should we be unto them all? But now, while you <HI>Walk in Darkness,</HI> O ye <HI>Feeble Folk,</HI> How is it possible for you to <HI>Walk with GOD,</HI> and be <HI>Stately in your Goings</HI>? While you cannot <HI>Rejoice,</HI> how Weak, how Dull, how Low, will be all your Actions in <HI>Working of Righteousness?</HI> How poorly will the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD be flaming in you, while, for ought you know, you have the <HI>Wrath</HI> of GOD Lying on you! Will you <HI>Love</HI> GOD, while you have a Suspicion, That He is your <HI>Adversary,</HI> and that your <HI>King</HI> has of old <HI>Ordained a Tophet</HI> for you! How Sorrily will you <HI>Live</HI> to GOD, while you are Jealous, that you have <HI>never yet passed from Death to Life</HI>; Jealous, that after all the <HI>Sparks</HI> you have <HI>kindled</HI> you must <HI>Ly down in Sorrow</HI>: It will be found, That a Great occasion of it, why there is to be seen so little

of <HI>Godliness in the power of it</HI> among us, &amp; we are mostly such Feeble, Meagre, <HI>Minor Chris∣tians,</HI> tis this; People are too willing to <HI>Walk in Darkness,</HI> and can go on from year to year without <HI>Knowing whither they are going.</HI> Tho' there is also a Reciprocation of it; Because there is no more <HI>Godliness in the Power of it,</HI> Therefore tis that we have so much <HI>Darkness</HI> upon us. Ah! <HI>Frozen</HI> Souls, in what an <HI>Un∣happy Condition</HI> are you?</P>
<P>But then, Secondly; My Brethren, while you have a <HI>Darkness,</HI> on your Minds, whether you are <HI>in Good Terms with Heaven,</HI> or no. How can you <HI>Dy?</HI> Nay How can you <HI>Live?</HI> which way can you keep off <HI>Anguish</HI> from your Minds, which if a <HI>Spirit of Slumber</HI> had not <HI>Poison'd</HI> you, would be indeed, <HI>Intolerable</HI>? One that seems at a Loss, whether GOD would be <HI>Favourable</HI> to him, or not <HI>cast him off fore∣ver,</HI> cried out, Psal. LXXVII. 24. <HI>My Soul refu∣ses to be comforted; Thou holdest mine Eyes waking: I am so Troubled that I cannot Speak.</HI> Indeed, If you could say, <HI>I know that my Redeemer Lives, and I know that He is indeed mine, &amp; has Loved me, and has died for me</HI>; How comfort∣ably might you <HI>Pass the Time of your Sojourn∣ing here</HI> in the <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD, but without the least <HI>Fear</HI> of any <HI>Evil</HI>! Yea, Look where you will, all objects would conspire to Speak unto you, as the Lord unto the Angel in the Visi∣on,
<PB N="19" REF="002559_0020_0FDB6FC6AAAE5888"/>
<HI>with good words, &amp; with comfortable words.</HI> The Great GOD says to you, <HI>I am thy GOD; Thy Father, and thy Saviour, &amp; thy Leader; &amp; I will bring thee to Inherit all things.</HI> The <HI>An∣gels</HI> in the <HI>Multitude of the Heavenly Host,</HI> say to you, <HI>We are thy Guardian</HI> All <HI>Creatures</HI> offer themselves unto you saying, <HI>We are thy Servants.</HI> The most <HI>Afflictive Things</HI> that be∣fall you, say unto you, <HI>GOD hath Meant us and Sent us for thy Good.</HI> But how can you bear to <HI>Walk</HI> in such a <HI>Darkness,</HI> as This; That for ought you <HI>Know,</HI> you are among the <HI>Abhorred of the Lord</HI>; among the <HI>Enslaved of the Devil</HI>; and some of those who are going down to that Burning <HI>Lake,</HI> from whence <HI>the Smoak of their Torment ascends for Ever &amp; Ever</HI>? Methinks, you should have a <HI>Soul refusing to be comforted</HI> with any thing here. Methinks, your <HI>Eyes</HI> may be held <HI>Waking,</HI> with the Flames that are before them. This you do <HI>Know,</HI> That it is <HI>Appointed for men once to Dy. Death</HI> has a commission to Seise upon you; and E∣very day that passes, you don't <HI>Know,</HI> but that <HI>This Day</HI> he may bring the Bowstring, &amp; the Sentence may be Executed. But at the same time, there is another Thing which you <HI>do not know:</HI> Whether your <HI>Death</HI> will not be a Trap-door, that must let you down to <HI>Hell,</HI> and so you sink down into the <HI>Horrible Pit</HI>: This is what you <HI>do not Know.</HI> If you should

This Day have the Summons of <HI>Death</HI> served upon you, would not the <HI>Groans as of a deadly Wounded Man</HI> be heard from you? <HI>Oh! I know not what will become of me! I know not what world I am going to! I know not whether I am going up to the Rest which remains for the People of GOD, or going down into the Devouring Fire, &amp; the Everlasting Burnings</HI>! And how can you bear to Live in Circumstances, that are so full to Dangers and perils infinitely to be trembled at? O <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition</HI>! That Man thought himself in an <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition</HI> who sat at a full <HI>Table,</HI> but had a Sword with the point thereof directed unto him, hanging by a slender Thread over his Head, the break∣ing whereof, and his Dying by it every mo∣ment was to be looked for. <HI>Soul in Darkness,</HI> Every Time of thy sitting down at the <HI>Table,</HI> thou mayst have this Terror upon thee, <HI>For ought I know, while my meat is in my mouth, the Wrath of GOD may come upon me, and hurry me away to Endless gnashing of Teeth.</HI> Wherever thou art, &amp; whatever thou dost, a <HI>Destruction from GOD</HI> impending over thee, may be a <HI>Terror</HI> unto thee.

<HI>Horse,</HI> he may be terrified with such a Re∣flection as This; <HI>For ought I know, This Beast may throw me down into the place of Dragons</HI>! O <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition</HI>! One would not wonder, at it, if a person in such <HI>Darkness,</HI> were a, <HI>Magor Missabib</HI> a <HI>Terror</HI> unto himself, &amp; un∣to all about him Tis a wonder that such an one can Enjoy himself, in any thing, and that his continual Terror, of what his <HI>Death</HI> may bring him to, do not Spoil &amp; Pall every <HI>Comfort</HI> of his <HI>Life:</HI> that he can have any <HI>Comfort</HI> of his <HI>Life!</HI> They who <HI>Dy in their Sins,</HI> must go into a very <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition.</HI> To be <HI>Banished</HI> from the Blessedness of the Holy City, and feel an Almighty GOD, as a <HI>Con∣suming Fire,</HI> torturing the Soul with Immedi∣ate and Everlasting Impressions from His Vengeance upon it; This cannot but be a very <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition.</HI> And surely then, they who do <HI>not know</HI> any other; but that they are <HI>yet in their Sins,</HI> &amp; shall <HI>Dy</HI> in them; These are therefore and so far in a very <HI>Ʋn∣happy Condition</HI> too To be in such a <HI>Dark∣ness,</HI> that O man, Thou <HI>knowest</HI> not whether thou art not one of those, for whom is <HI>Reser∣ved Blackness of Darkness</HI> forever! If this be not an <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition,</HI> what can be so?

Art thou not in a worse than <HI>Egyptian Dark∣ness</HI>? But, Oh! the <HI>Trouble</HI>; when for ought thou knowest, thou art in the Hands of the <HI>Evil Angels</HI>; a <HI>Prey</HI> to those <HI>Terrible ones</HI>!</P>
<P>Thirdly.

Tis a <HI>Madness</HI> that keeps them in their <HI>Darkness</HI> It is a Sorrowful Account that is given concerning the Children of Men: Eccl. IX. 3. <HI>Madness is in their Heart while they Live, &amp; after that they go to the Dead.</HI> But the <HI>Madness</HI> appears not in any thing more than in this, That they Walk in <HI>Dark∣ness,</HI> and <HI>know not</HI> how they shall fare when they are <HI>gone to the Dead</HI>; and how they shall after <HI>Death</HI> be disposed of. My Neighbours, let me <HI>Reason with you before the Lord.</HI> While you can bear to be <HI>in the Dark,</HI> about the GRAND POINT, whether you <HI>have Ever∣lasting Life,</HI> or, have the <HI>Wrath of GOD abiding</HI> on you: I must convince you, That you are <HI>Mad</HI>: you have laid aside the common use
<PB N="23" REF="002559_0024_0FDB6FD020007D58"/>
of <HI>Reason</HI>; There is a most pitiable <HI>Madness</HI> upon you. And if you will not be convinced of it, it only shows, that it is a more con∣firmed, a more Desperate <HI>Madness</HI> that En∣rages you. Hear Two Demonstrations of it.</P>
<P>First; You don't Act so <HI>Madly</HI> about the concerns of <HI>This World,</HI> no not about the <HI>Least concerns</HI> in the World; as to leave them with an <HI>Ʋncertainty</HI> upon them. It was complain∣ed of; Luk. XVI. 8. <HI>The children of This World, are wiser in their Generation, than the Children of Light.</HI> My Complaint is, That in the Af∣fairs of <HI>This World,</HI> you deal not so <HI>Foolishly,</HI> as you do in those▪ wherein you should Ap∣prove your selves the <HI>Children of Light</HI>; and not always <HI>Walk in Darkness.</HI> For the Enjoy∣ments of <HI>This World,</HI> you are lothe to be left at an <HI>Ʋncertainty.</HI> But it seems, you can leave all the Enjoyments of the <HI>Heavenly World</HI> at the Greatest <HI>Uncertainty</HI>! When there is any Thing of <HI>This World,</HI> which you propose the least Advantage by the Know∣ledge of, you <HI>put it out of Doubt,</HI> as far and as fast as ever you can. And, what? Not <HI>put it out of Doubt,</HI> that you are <HI>Born</HI> of GOD, &amp; are <HI>Turned</HI> to Him? When you look for any Thing in <HI>This World,</HI> you are willing to un∣derstand <HI>what you have to Trust to.</HI> And what? For what you are to look for at the Hands of GOD for ever, be careless about Learning
<PB N="24" REF="002559_0025_0FDB6FD108324C10"/>
<HI>what you have trust to</HI>! A little <HI>Interest</HI> in <HI>This World</HI>; you secure a <HI>Title</HI> to it. And what? Secure no <HI>Title</HI> to the <HI>Pleasant Land</HI> that is <HI>Promised</HI> unto the Righteous, the only <HI>Land of the Living?</HI> Let your <HI>Title</HI> to This, always ly at an <HI>Uncertainty</HI>! O <HI>Foolish people, and Ʋnwise</HI>! Is GOD, and CHRIST, and a Soul, thus to be dealt withal?</P>
<P>Secondly. May we not say? Tis your <HI>own Fault,</HI> &amp;, Oh! Tis <HI>utterly a Fault,</HI> if the <HI>Eterni∣ty</HI> that is before you, be left still at an <HI>Uncer∣tainty.</HI> It was urged; 2 Cor. XIII. 5. <HI>Know ye not your own selves; Except ye be Disapproved</HI> [or, Blame-worthy] ones? Verily, If you do not <HI>know your own selves, Know</HI> what you <HI>Are,</HI> and what you <HI>Do,</HI> and whither you <HI>Go,</HI> tis a <HI>Blameable</HI> Thing in you; and the <HI>Blame</HI> of it Lies upon <HI>Your selves.</HI> The <HI>Unregenerate</HI> and <HI>Impaenitent,</HI> These may <HI>know,</HI> that they are such, and <HI>know</HI> what will be the Doom of them that <HI>go on still in their Trespasses.</HI> The <HI>Spots,</HI> open them are so Black and so Plain, that they must Marvellously <HI>Deceive</HI> them∣selves, if they do not <HI>Perceive,</HI> this, <HI>That they are not the Children of GOD.</HI> But then, O You that <HI>Follow after Righteousness</HI>; The <HI>GOD of all Grace,</HI> is Ready to <HI>Discover</HI> unto You Himself, &amp; His will, and what You are, and how He purposes to deal with You. The <HI>Father of Lights</HI> will bring You out of Your
<PB N="25" REF="002559_0026_0FDB6FD3AF676FE0"/>
<HI>Darkness,</HI> if You will with a due Ardour seek unto Him. Look <HI>Inward,</HI> and Look <HI>Upward,</HI> as you ought to do, &amp; GOD your SAVIOUR will show you whereabouts you are. You say, GOD has not yet brought you out of your <HI>Ʋncertainty,</HI> whither you are Listed a∣mong the <HI>Heirs of Salvation</HI> or no, But, O Wanderers in the <HI>Dark</HI>: Have you ever been in such a <HI>Distress</HI> about it, as to set apart a Day, or but an half of a Day, on purpose, to go thro' a process of conversion to GOD; And have you ever <HI>from the Depths cried unto the Lord, Lord, I cannot bear, I cannot bear, to ly in the Dark. I cannot rise off my Knees, till thou shine upon me</HI>! I will say, but this one thing unto you. What would you do in order to your <HI>Eternal Welfare,</HI> if you were informed, that your <HI>Life</HI> is come unto a <HI>Period,</HI> and that you have but <HI>one week longer</HI> to Live? Such Things you can do, if you will. Tis Nonsence to say, <HI>you can't</HI>! Well; But let such things be done, &amp; your <HI>Uncertainty</HI> about Your <HI>Eternal Welfare</HI> would soon be over with you. You would give <HI>no Sleep to your Eyes, nor Slumber to your Eye lids,</HI> till it be over with you. How can you then Excuse the <HI>Folly</HI> of Leaving un∣done such things as these! Oh! In a most <HI>Unhappy Condition</HI> are you!</P>
<P>It is time for us to bring in the <HI>Corollaries,</HI> wherein these <HI>Admonitions</HI> are to terminate
<PB N="26" REF="002559_0027_0FDB6FD4C1471278"/>
And wake some <HI>Vse</HI> of our Melancholy <HI>Pro∣positions.</HI> It shall be done, with several <HI>Asser∣tions</HI> which now must be received as MAX∣IMS, and whereof I am to affirm unto you, <HI>These are Things that cannot be spoken against.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="assertion">
<HEAD>The First Assertion.</HEAD>
<P>It is as <HI>clear as the Light,</HI> &amp; there are <HI>Epi∣demical Manifestations</HI> of it, That People very commonly are in that <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition,</HI> to <HI>Walk in Darkness,</HI> &amp; <HI>know not whither they are going</HI>: and <HI>Good Terms with Heaven</HI> are not yet <HI>Settled</HI> &amp; <HI>certain</HI> with them. We read of some, <HI>Their Folly shall be Manifest unto all Men.</HI> The Greatest <HI>Folly</HI> in the World is for Men to be <HI>always in the Dark</HI> about the World unto which they are <HI>going.</HI> But this <HI>Folly</HI> in the most of Men, is <HI>Manifest unto all Men</HI> that shall take any cognisance of them. And tho' they are told of it, yet they will <HI>Proceed further</HI> in it. It was a Problem of old, <HI>As for Darkness, where is the place thereof</HI>? Alas, How many of us may lay our Hand on our <HI>Heart,</HI> and say, <HI>Here is the place of Darkness. Tis an Heart always in the Dark, about the place to which I am going. And so my walk is full of Darkness; I know not whither I am going.</HI> It was the <HI>Grief</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. XIX. 8. <HI>He hath set Darkness in my Pathes.</HI> Truly, There is a Multitude of People, who may speak that <HI>Grie∣vous</HI> thing. There is <HI>Darkness in their Pathes</HI>;
<PB N="27" REF="002559_0028_0FDB6FD7FA074D08"/>
and they know not whither their <HI>Pathes</HI> will carry them. And yet I must bring this also into my Remonstrance; The <HI>Darkness</HI> is not so <HI>Grievous</HI> to them, as it ought to be. It was threatened as a very Direful Curse upon the Enemies of GOD, and His CHRIST; Psal. XXXV. 6. <HI>Let their Way be Dark and Slippery.</HI> How many are under this <HI>Curse,</HI> &amp; yet how little are they affected with it? <HI>Their Way</HI> is all <HI>in the Dark</HI>; they <HI>know not whither they are going.</HI> And yet is it such a <HI>Slippery Way,</HI> that they are Every moment in danger of <HI>Slipping</HI> and falling down into the Land, where they <HI>never see Light,</HI> but where <HI>the Light it self is Darkness.</HI></P>
<P>Tis a Thing as <HI>Ʋnquaestionable</HI> as <HI>Ʋnaccount∣able</HI>; That People have heard many Hun∣dreds of <HI>Sermons,</HI> wherein the <HI>Things that ac∣company Salvation</HI> have been set before them, and they have been <HI>Exhorted</HI> over and over again to get into the Experience of those <HI>Necessary Things.</HI> But after all, they still <HI>Walk in Darkness, not knowing whither they are going.</HI> People have been at Hundreds of <HI>Burials</HI>; Yea, and followed such as have been younger than Themselves with the <HI>Mourners walking about the Streets</HI> at <HI>Funerals</HI>: and seen how needful it has been for them to put off no longer the doing of what they have to do that they may not be found Unprepared.
<PB N="28" REF="002559_0029_0FDB6FDAE5438530"/>
But after all, they still <HI>Walk in Darkness, not knowing whither they are going.</HI> We read of a <HI>Vial poured out</HI> upon the <HI>Seat</HI> of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> whereupon, <HI>His Kingdom is full of Darkness.</HI> But is not many a <HI>Soul</HI> among us, as if it had such a <HI>Vial poured out</HI> upon it; A <HI>Soul</HI> that is <HI>full of Darkness?</HI></P>
<P>For the Proof of this <HI>Hard Saying,</HI> I entreat of you to save me the pains. Do you your selves Every one of you take the pains, to bring your selves unto the <HI>Test.</HI> It is the Command of GOD unto you; 2 Cor. XIII. 5. <HI>Examine your selves, whether you be in the Faith; Prove your own selves.</HI> O <HI>Soul,</HI> upon the Brink of <HI>Eternity, Prove thy own self.</HI> Dost thou know, what will become of thee to all <HI>Eterni∣ty?</HI> Put it hard and home upon thy self; <HI>If This Night my Soul should be required of me, do I know what Hands it would fall into!</HI> For my own part, I cannot say, who among you has his <HI>Heart Established</HI> with the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD, &amp; who has not. But there is a <HI>Preacher,</HI> who can do much towards it. I will consign the work over to that flaming <HI>Preacher.</HI> You can't run away from him. Tis the <HI>Conscience,</HI> which is in Every Man the <HI>Candle of the Lord.</HI> O CONSCIENCE, Do Thou go to work upon them that are under thy Inspection: &amp; force them to tell, <HI>whether they have ever done what must be done by Every one, before they can
<PB N="29" REF="002559_0030_0FDB6FDAE8BBE6F8"/>
know, that they shall be Sav'd.</HI> Verily, If the censures of <HI>Conscience</HI> might be heard among us, there would be, Oh! how many whose <HI>Hearts</HI> would be heard <HI>Condemning</HI> of them, <HI>Thou Fool, Thou art in Hourly danger of Death, and thou knowest not how thou shalt fare Eternally after Death.</HI></P>
<P>But, if you will compel <HI>Me</HI> to <HI>Prove,</HI> what so many cannot but own; &amp; if my Justifying of my Assertion be yet insisted on, I will free∣ly tell you, The <HI>Next Lords Day</HI> will give you an <HI>Occular Demonstration</HI> of it. I pray, What can be the cause of it, why there are so few <HI>Communicants</HI> appearing at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord! Our Lamentations are almost those; Lam. I 4. <HI>The ways of Zion Mourn, because none</HI> (comparatively to what ought to be) <HI>come to the Solemn Feasts.</HI> When the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord is going to he administred, what <HI>Shoals,</HI> do we see as it were escaping from it? And what a Thin Appearance is Left at the <HI>Holy Table</HI>? Be Sure, Not Half of the Congregati∣on! But what is the Cause of This? The True Cause why People <HI>do</HI> not come unto the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, is because they <HI>Dare</HI> not come. They are Suspicious, That they have not yet put on the <HI>Wedding Gar∣ment,</HI> and that they shall not be found a∣mong the <HI>Worthy partakers</HI> Tho' they have been so many Years under the Invitations of
<PB N="30" REF="002559_0031_0FDB6FDC8DC8E288"/>
the Gospel, they do <HI>not know</HI> that they have ever yet <HI>Heartily</HI> and <HI>Really</HI> answered them. When we see so many Hundreds withdraw∣ing from the Table of the Lord, may it not be justly and sadly Bemoaned; <HI>Behold, There are so many People, who are still destitute of As∣surance, that their Sins are Pardoned: So many People that never yet had the Electing, Redeem∣ing, Pardoning Love of GOD Sealed unto them:</HI> Did they know themselves to be <HI>Ʋnited</HI> unto their SAVIOUR, they could never forbear the communion to be had with Him at His <HI>Holy Table.</HI> If they had <HI>Secretly,</HI> but <HI>Heartily</HI> &amp; <HI>Really</HI> given themselves up to GOD in His Covenant, What hinders them from coming to do it <HI>Openly?</HI> My Friends, I must needs tell you, Did you know, that GOD had <HI>for∣given your Sins, &amp; cleansed you from all Ʋnrighte∣ousness,</HI> it would be impossible for you to keep at a Distance from His <HI>Holy Table,</HI> &amp; Sleight the <HI>Interviews</HI> you might have with Him there, and go on in what you cannot but know to be a <HI>Sinful Omission</HI> of a thing plainly com∣manded by your SAVIOUR. You could no more do it, than you could throw your selves into the Fire, or tear your own Flesh to pieces. O you Absenters from the <HI>Holy Table,</HI> Allow a little <HI>plain Dealing</HI> with you. If you had made so much <HI>Preparation</HI> to meet with <HI>your own Death,</HI> as might Rationally be Expected

<HEAD>The Second Assertion.</HEAD>
<P>If People would bestow Suitable <HI>Thoughts</HI> on the <HI>World,</HI> unto which <HI>they are going,</HI> one would think, it could not be possible for them to remain in that <HI>Ʋnhappy Condition,</HI> to <HI>Walk in Darkness,</HI> &amp; <HI>know not whither they are going,</HI> and have <HI>Good Terms with Heaven,</HI> to be still not <HI>Settled</HI> and <HI>Certain</HI> with them. For them that can with any <HI>Composed Mind</HI> con∣tinue in this <HI>Unhappy Condition,</HI> one would think, Either they <HI>Believe nothing</HI> at all of a <HI>World to Come</HI>; or, they never trouble them∣selves to Think much about it, or about their own <HI>Relation</HI> to it. But the Experiment was made; Psal. XXXIX. 3. <HI>My Heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the Fire burned.</HI> Certainly, If People would ponder duely, What there is in those Two <HI>Eternal Worlds,</HI> one or t'other of which they are going to, while they are <HI>musing</HI> of those things, their <HI>Hearts</HI> could not but be <HI>Hot within</HI> them;
<PB N="32" REF="002559_0033_0FDB6FE189E77238"/>
they could not but feel a <HI>Fire burning</HI> there: they must needs be <HI>Inflamed</HI> into the utter∣most Impatience of knowing, <HI>In which of those Worlds they must have their Portion.</HI> Did People Believe, what the <HI>Worlds</HI> are which the <HI>Dead</HI> must go into, and that they are very quickly to go into one or t'other of them, they could not continue in their <HI>darkness</HI> about it, without saying, <HI>I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long, I have Roared by reason of the Disquietness of my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, first, O Man, <HI>Shew thy self a Man,</HI> and in an affectuous <HI>Meditation, take the Wings of the Morning,</HI> and fly up to the <HI>Heavenly World. Meditate</HI> on the <HI>Glorious Things that are spoken about the City of GOD,</HI> and what is to be Enjoy'd there. <HI>Walk about that Zion,</HI> the <HI>City of the Living GOD; Go round about her; Consider her Palaces</HI>; And see what is done by the Great GOD there for them, who have Him for their <HI>own GOD,</HI> &amp; their <HI>Guide unto Death,</HI> &amp; beyond it. Think, <HI>If I go up to that World, I shall see a Perfect Rest from every thing that can be grievous to me here; I shall have no Sorrow there, but all Tears will be Wiped from my Eyes.</HI> Think again; <HI>If I go up to That World, I shall find in the Alsufficient GOD, all that is Relishable or Valuable in any creatures here, &amp; inconcervably more; and an Admirable CHRIST will fill me with all the Ful∣ness
<PB N="33" REF="002559_0034_0FDB6FE300485B70"/>
of GOD▪</HI> Think once more, <HI>If I go up to that World, I shall Reap a full Harvest of all my Patient Continuance in well-doing, and let me now never so much abound in the work of the Lord, I shall then find my Labour not in vain for the Lord:</HI> But then let thy <HI>Meditation</HI> mind thee of the <HI>Eternity</HI> which <HI>That World</HI> will be Bright∣ned and Sweetened withal: The <HI>Eternal Glory</HI> whereto the <HI>GOD of all Grace does call us by CHRIST JESƲS.</HI> Think, <HI>If I come to be Comforted in that World, it will be with an Ever∣lasting Consolation. The Fountains of Living water whereto I shall be led, will be running forevermore. My Knowledge will be Eternally Progressive; My delight eternally Varied. After I have been satis∣fying my self in the Eternal GOD, for as many Millions of Ages as there are now Beam of Light in the World, I shall be no nearer to the End of my Satisfaction, than I was the First Moment of my Entring into the Joy of my Lord.</HI> Canst Thou think thus, &amp; not wish, <HI>Oh! That I knew this to be my Portion</HI>!</P>
<P>And then, Let thy <HI>Meditation</HI> remove the <HI>Bars of the Pit,</HI> &amp; uncover the dismal Vault, &amp; Look down into the <HI>Infernal World. Meditate</HI> on the tremendous Things which are inflict∣ed on the Prisoners in that <HI>place of Torment.</HI> Visit the gloomy &amp; howling Regions, where GOD <HI>sets them in dark places,</HI> who have been <HI>Dead of old</HI>: GOD <HI>hedges them about, they cannot

get out:</HI> GOD <HI>makes their chain heavy</HI>: Also when they <HI>Cry and Shout,</HI> He <HI>shuts out their prayer.</HI> GOD is <HI>as a Lion unto them</HI> in the <HI>secret Places</HI>: He <HI>pulls them in pieces, and makes them Desolate.</HI> GOD causes the <HI>Arrows of His Quiver to enter</HI> into them, &amp; He <HI>fills them with Bitterness</HI>: Think, <HI>If I must go down to that World, I shall carry thither with me the Raging Desires of the diverse Lusts which I am now serving of; But they will only help to Torture me; I shall not have so much as a Drop of water to gra∣tify them. I shall be hardly bestead, and hungry, &amp; fret my self, &amp; curse GOD, &amp; look upward. And when I look back unto the Earth, &amp; Remem∣ber the Good, things I received there, Oh! the Dim∣ness of the Anguish I shall have upon me, finding my self driven into Darkness</HI>! Think again, <HI>If I go down to that World, all the painful Things, that ever I did or could Suffer, by the mediation of my senses here, I shall have without them, dispensed unto me there, in very Tormenting Sentiments which a Provoked GOD will compel me to; And all those pains little enough to punish my Crimes in Denying the GOD that is above.</HI> Think once more; <HI>If I go down to that World, an Almighty GOD Himself will take me into His own Hands, and make me feel such Scalding Strokes, of His Wrath as no Tongue is able to Express, no Heart able to Conceive. Immediate Emanations from an Offended, Omnipotent, Omniscient &amp; Omnipresent

GOD, will penetrate like Hot Lightning into my Soul: immediate Coruscations from GOD acting as a Consuming Fire. GOD Himself will fight against me, with a Strong Arm, even in Great Wrath. And can my Hands be strong, or can my Heart endure, when GOD shall deal with me?</HI> But then, let thy <HI>Meditation</HI> mind thee of the <HI>Eternity</HI> which renders <HI>That World,</HI> yet more Terrible: The <HI>Everlasting Punishment,</HI> which the <HI>Wicked</HI> shall <HI>go away</HI> into. Think; <HI>If I come to be tormented in that World, I know not of any Period for my Torment. An Aking Tooth for one Month, how grievous would it be unto me here! But if I must ly down among the damned, I must undergo much worse Griefs than That: and after as many Millions of Years, as there are Leaves on the Trees, or Drops in the Sea, or Sands on the Shore, I have no prospect of any Period. When the Mediator delivers up the Kingdom to His Father, I shall be left still under the Vengeance of GOD. And how can I hope for a Deliverance, when there will be no Mediator for me! When GOD lays me in the lowest pit in Darkness, in the Deeps, I shall be shut up, and cannot come forth any more.</HI> Canst thou think thus, and canst thou bear the Horror of the <HI>Hazzard</HI> of such a <HI>Portion</HI>: Oh! That you would all Retire; and come into such <HI>Meditations</HI>! How, How could you after this be willing to <HI>Walk in Darkness, not knowing whither you are going</HI>?</P>

<HEAD>The Third Assertion.</HEAD>
<P>Were People got out of that <HI>Ʋnhappy Con∣dition,</HI> to <HI>Walk in Darkness and know not whither they are going,</HI> and had <HI>Good Terms with Heaven</HI> fairly <HI>Setled</HI> &amp; <HI>Certain</HI> with them, we should soon see PIETY flourishing in its <HI>Verdure</HI> and <HI>Vigour</HI> among us; a <HI>Fruitful Christian,</HI> would not be so much as it is a <HI>Rare Sight</HI> among us. It is a thing too notorious to be denied, That a <HI>Fruitful Christian</HI> is not so often to be met with as were to be wish'd for. They that have been most conspicuous for <HI>bringing forth much Fruit,</HI> are most of them gone. Of them that remain, it may be said, as in Isa XVII. 6. <HI>Some Gleaning Grapes are left</HI>; or, they are <HI>as the Shaking of an Olive-tree, two or three Berries, in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful Branches thereof.</HI> But whence does this come to pass? Truly, them that are <HI>Barren &amp; Ʋnfruitful in the Knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> you shall still find in the <HI>Unhappy Condition,</HI> of <HI>Uncertainty</HI> for <HI>Eter∣nity</HI> And indeed, how should they be o∣therwise? But it is this <HI>Ʋncertainty</HI> that very much keeps them so <HI>Barren</HI> and <HI>Unfruitful.</HI> Nothing would so animate all PIETY in you, nor would any thing so render you <HI>Full of Goodness,</HI> as the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of this: <HI>My Lord JESUS CHRIST has taken me into His Gracious Hands, &amp; nothing shall ever pluck me out of them.</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="002559_0038_0FDB6FEA84454EB8"/>
You will find, that an <HI>Assurance</HI> of <HI>Good Terms with Heaven,</HI> is no <HI>Enemy</HI> to <HI>Holiness:</HI> No, tis the Strongest <HI>Incentive</HI> to it in the World. PIETY can't find such another <HI>Quickener</HI>! Had you the <HI>Assurance</HI> of it, that you have the <HI>Promises of GOD,</HI> all belonging to you; <HI>The Heritage of those that fear His Name</HI>; O <HI>Dearly Beloved,</HI> you could not but <HI>cleanse your selves from all Filthiness of the Flesh and of the Spirit, and carry on Holiness to perfection in the Fear of GOD.</HI> Could you <HI>Read</HI> your <HI>Names written in Heaven,</HI> you could not but have your <HI>conversation in Heaven.</HI> Could you call your selves the <HI>Children of GOD,</HI> you could not but be <HI>Followers of GOD, as Obedient Chil∣dren.</HI> Did you know that your <HI>Many Sins are Forgiven</HI> you, how much would you <HI>Love</HI> Him that his <HI>Forgiven</HI> you so <HI>Much,</HI> and how lothe would you be to <HI>Sin</HI> against Him any more? Had you an Undoubted <HI>Assurance</HI> of it, That you shall one day <HI>Walk</HI> in <HI>White Robes</HI> among the <HI>Priests</HI> of GOD, and be the com∣panions of His <HI>Angels,</HI> in His <HI>Holy places,</HI> what Noble <HI>Sacrificers</HI> would this <HI>Assurance</HI> tender you? And how much would you scorn to do a Dirty, or a Little Thing? And how <HI>Holy</HI> would you be <HI>in all manner of Conversati∣on</HI>? What is a <HI>Fruitful Christian?</HI> A <HI>Fruitful Christian</HI> is one, whose <HI>Chief End</HI> it is to Ho∣nour &amp; Obey &amp; Enjoy the Glorious GOD;
<PB N="38" REF="002559_0039_0FDB142CDB034498"/>
and <HI>Chief Care</HI> to do the Things that please Him: And one who behaves himself as hav∣ing the <HI>Eye</HI> of GOD always upon him; and therefore he watches over his very <HI>Heart,</HI> that there may not be in it so much as a <HI>Frame,</HI> or a <HI>Thought,</HI> offensive unto GOD. A <HI>Fruitful Christian</HI> is one who <HI>Lives by the Faith of the Son of GOD</HI>; &amp; can't <HI>Live</HI> without a continual Recourse unto his lovely SAVIOUR. Yea, A CHRIST is <HI>All</HI> unto him; and the views of a CHRIST, <HI>by these things he Lives, and in these is the very Life of his</HI> never dying <HI>Spirit.</HI> A <HI>Fruitful Christian</HI> is a Diligent <HI>Redeemer of Time</HI>; He divides his <HI>Time</HI> with Discretion, between his <HI>Two Callings.</HI> And he is one who studies to carry it well in all <HI>Relations</HI> wherein GOD has placed him: Studies to be a Bles∣sing in all <HI>Societies</HI> he belongs unto; Studies to <HI>do Good</HI> unto all about him, and wherever he comes.

against some that remain much <HI>in the Dark,</HI> how it shall go with them, 2 Pet.

The <HI>Call</HI> of the Gospel is, <HI>Abhor that which is Evil, &amp; thy self also for Doing it, and for Departing from the Living GOD.</HI> Most Heartily Answer, <HI>Lord, I Abhor it.</HI> The <HI>Call</HI> of the Gospel is, <HI>Embrace the Great Salvation which a JESUS brings unto you; &amp; be glad of the Wisdom, &amp; Righteousness, &amp; Holiness, &amp; Redemption, which He has to be∣stow upon you.</HI> Most Heartily Answer, <HI>Lord, I Embrace it.</HI> The <HI>Call</HI> of the Gospel is, <HI>Re∣solve on a Return to GOD, and a Godly &amp; Sober and Righteous Life before Him.</HI> Answer most Heartily, <HI>Lord, I Resolve it.</HI> My Friend, If this be thy <HI>Answer,</HI> &amp; if thy <HI>Heart</HI> be in the Answer, thou art then among them that are <HI>partakers of the Heavenly Calling:</HI> And thou shalt not miss of the <HI>Heaven</HI> which thou art <HI>Call'd</HI> unto Dost thou say, <HI>I do give the Answer,
<PB N="41" REF="002559_0042_0FDB6FF2C1273A20"/>
but I don't know whether my heart be in it</HI>? Then Repeat the <HI>Answer</HI>; carry on the Repetition of it, until thou dost <HI>know,</HI> that thy <HI>Heart</HI> is in it. This <HI>Answer of a Good Conscience,</HI> will <HI>Baptise</HI> thee, tor a <HI>Deliverance</HI> from the <HI>Wrath to come.</HI></P>
<P>Again; All turns upon your Compliance, with the <HI>Three Illustrious Articles</HI> of PIETY, which <HI>all that Fear GOD and work Righteousness</HI> are united in. There are <HI>Three Illustrious Ar∣ticles,</HI> wherein all the People of our SAVIOUR are <HI>One,</HI> as He has <HI>Interceeded</HI> that they may be. There have been many large Discourses upon, <HI>The Trial of a Good State</HI>: And sometimes after the Thing has been Largely Discoursed on, tis left in as much obscurity and perplexity, as it was before. But the most <HI>Weighty Ques∣tion</HI> in the World, will be soon determined by these Three Enquiries.</P>
<P>Enquire, first. <Q>Is it my principal &amp; per∣petual Study to Glorify GOD in doing the <HI>Things that please Him</HI>? And am I always a∣fraid of Every Thing, which the <HI>Light of GOD</HI> in my Soul condemns as an Evil Thing?</Q></P>
<P>Enquire, nextly. <Q>Do I come &amp; look to a Glorious CHRIST, for all the Blessings of an <HI>Holy Redeemer</HI>; &amp; do I long for nothing so much, as to be what He would have me <HI>to be?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Enquire, lastly. <Q>Do I heartily wish that my Neighbour may have with me a share in all the <HI>Blessings of Goodness</HI>; Pleas'd with his
<PB N="42" REF="002559_0043_0FDB6FF4A86C53E0"/>
Welfare; Griev'd at his Trouble; not har∣bouring any evil Disposition towards Him?</Q></P>
<P>Soul, If thou art come to these Things, thou hast the <HI>Marks of GOD</HI> upon thee; Thou art of the <HI>Righteous Nation,</HI> which the <HI>Gates of the Holy City</HI> forever stand open to. Oh! let nothing pacify thee, till thou find thy self thus <HI>Marked</HI> of, and for the Lord.</P>
<P>Thirdly. There are various <HI>Acts</HI> of a <HI>Be∣liever Living unto GOD.</HI> The Doing of any such <HI>Acts</HI> will help to show it, and a course Abounding and persisting in such <HI>Acts,</HI> will indisputably show it, that you are to <HI>Live Eternally.</HI> As now, To do the part of a <HI>Sacri∣ficer,</HI> in Patiently and Cheerfully Submitting to the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD, as often as he does with Afflictive Dispensations <HI>Perform the Thing that is appointed for us</HI>: Willingly to offer up our <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> when our <HI>Desirable Things</HI> are taken away with a <HI>Stroke</HI>; Devoutly to find in a CHRIST all the Good which we fondly sought in the things that we have <HI>Sacrificed</HI>: This will determine it, that we have a part in the <HI>Royal Priesthood</HI>; &amp; we shall one day come to serve GOD in His <HI>Temple</HI> which is <HI>Above.</HI></P>
<P>Again; To Realize the <HI>Eye</HI> of GOD upon you in all your ways; to be by the Aw thereof Restrain'd from <HI>Evil</HI> ways, and Forwarded in <HI>Good</HI> ways; by this Thought, <HI>GOD sees me; GOD knows what is done in the most secret places</HI>!
<PB N="43" REF="002559_0044_0FDB6FF7A8947938"/>
To keep a Guard on the very Motions of your <HI>Hearts,</HI> because <HI>GOD Looks</HI> upon them! This is the way of none but the <HI>upright in Heart</HI>; the <HI>Good</HI> ones, whom GOD will <HI>do Good</HI> unto.</P>
<P>Moreover, To welcome any <HI>Bitter Thing,</HI> whereby <HI>Sin</HI> may be <HI>Embittered</HI>; and this <HI>Be∣cause</HI> of its being so! To prefer a Sanctified <HI>Adversity,</HI> before a Secure, Senseless, Carnal <HI>Prosperity</HI>: To be Thankful for a <HI>Way hedged with Thorns,</HI> wherein you are kept from <HI>Walk∣ing in the vanity of your Minds</HI>! This is not the way of the <HI>Hypocrite</HI></P>
<P>Soul, Here are Symptoms, that thou hast the <HI>Life of GOD</HI> begun in thee But if thou dost indeed feel thy self <HI>Living</HI> to GOD, thou mayst argue from it, <HI>Now I see that the Sentence of Death passed on me for my Sin, is taken off, &amp; my Sin is all forgiven.</HI> Go on, &amp; argue at this rate; <HI>The Life of GOD thus begun in me, will never Dy: No Death can Ever Extinguish it!</HI></P>
<P>I will add one thing more. Christian, Dost thou feel the <HI>Blood</HI> of thy JESUS running warm in the Veins of thy Soul? That is to say: Does thy Soul close with the Intentions on which the <HI>Blood</HI> of thy SAVIOUR has been shed for His people, to <HI>Purify for Himself a Peculiar People?</HI> Does thy Soul wish &amp; long &amp; groan for it, that the Spirit of thy SAVI∣OUR, would make thee <HI>Like</HI> unto Him, and bring thee to <HI>Hate Wickedness</HI> &amp; <HI>Love Righte∣ousness</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="002559_0045_0FDB6FFAAC3AA1C0"/>
and <HI>always do the Things that please the FATHER?</HI> Dost thou <HI>Dy</HI> to Creatures, <HI>and</HI> as this <HI>Death</HI> goes on, is a CHRIST more en∣dear'd unto thee; nothing but a CHRIST left <HI>Alive</HI> unto thee? Now tis no longer to be question'd, Thou art most certainly one of those whom thy SAVIOUR has <HI>Died</HI> for. The <HI>Blood</HI> of thy SAVIOUR has been most certainly <HI>Sprinkled</HI> upon thee. The <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> is open for thee.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Yea, The <HI>Speaking</HI> of ONE WORD, if the <HI>Word</HI> be but <HI>Heartily Spoken</HI>; This may determine it, That you have <HI>an In∣heritance in the Heavens reserved for you.</HI> Such a <HI>Word</HI> as That; Psal CXIX. 94 <HI>Lord, I am Thine!</HI> This, This ONE WORD will go very far towards it. ONE WORD, O Soul sol∣licitous to <HI>know whither thou art going,</HI> ONE WORD, that shall Declare thee to be among the <HI>Willing People</HI> of thy SAVIOUR; This will determine it. The Experiment shall be made only in Two Instances.</P>
<P>First. The <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> wherein a Glorious CHRIST is the <HI>Head</HI> of His People, is Propos'd unto thee. It is Propos'd by GOD, <HI>Art thou willing that thy SAVIOUR should make thee both Righteous &amp; Holy, &amp; both Restore thee to the Favour of thy GOD, &amp; Restore to thee His Image; and make thee to be all that He will have His chosen to be</HI>? Now, Heartily Reply this
<PB N="45" REF="002559_0046_0FDB6FFBC5E60E38"/>
ONE WORD; <HI>Lord Make me willing▪ Thou hast Made me willing!</HI> Then hast thou <HI>Laid Hold on the Covenant</HI>; and thou art <HI>Bound up in the Bundle of Life.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There is made unto thee a Pro∣posal of an <HI>Espousal</HI> unto a Glorious CHRIST, who says, <HI>I Marry My self unto thee.</HI> The Proposal of thy SAVIOUR, is; <HI>Art thou wil∣ling, That I should make thee Mine, &amp; by my Spirit Entirely take Possession of thee</HI>; &amp; <HI>Feed thee, Cloath thee, Instruct thee, Protect thee, bring thee to My Fathers House, &amp; Rejoyce in thee forevermore</HI>? Now, Heartily Reply this ONE WORD; <HI>Lord, Make me willing; Thou hast Made me wil∣ling</HI>; Then art thou come into an <HI>Espousal</HI> with a Lord who <HI>hates putting away.</HI> In <HI>Faith∣fulness forever</HI> has He <HI>Bethrothed</HI> thee unto Himself; &amp; He will no more part with thee, than the <HI>Apple of His Eye.</HI> Oh! Go home Re∣joicing; Oh! Carry away with you the <HI>Great Consolations of GOD.</HI> Be not now the Soul that will <HI>Refuse to be Comforted.</HI> Assertion</P>

Any that abandon themselves to <HI>Tippling,</HI> to <HI>Swearing,</HI> to <HI>Whoring,</HI> to <HI>Stealing,</HI> to <HI>Gaming,</HI> to <HI>Lying,</HI> and such flagrant Abominations? Any that are <HI>Children of Belial,</HI> and break the Hearts of their Parents by their Vicious courses? Yea, my Children, Are any of you Strangers to the <HI>Religion of the Closet</HI>; or such as never made the Flight of a Distressed Soul unto your only SAVIOUR? Ah, Blind Children of <HI>Sor∣row.</HI> Don't say, That you <HI>don't know</HI> what is like to become of you. As Blind as you are, yet you do <HI>know whither you are going.</HI> You do <HI>Know</HI>; for GOD has told you; 1 Cor. VI. 9. <HI>Know ye not, that the</HI> Unrighteous <HI>shall not Inherit the Kingdom of GOD.</HI> You do <HI>Know</HI>; for GOD has told you; Heb XII. 14. <HI>Without Holiness no man shall see the Lord.</HI> O <HI>Unhap∣py Condition</HI>! Others that are better than you, do not know, but they may Perish. But you do know, that you must Perish; and your Souls cannot be saved from <HI>Death,</HI> if you be not Converted from the <HI>Error</HI> of your way. You do know, That if you <HI>Dy</HI> as you are, it had been Good for you that you had never been <HI>Born.</HI> Young man, Thou <HI>dost know,</HI> That <HI>GOD will bring thee into Judgment</HI> But a <HI>Judgment,</HI> which is to be <HI>Trembled at.</HI> Thou art worse than a <HI>Pagan</HI> if thou <HI>Tremble</HI> not!</P>
<P>And yet none of these forlorn Children are utterly to be despaired of. The worst of you all, may not Conclude, <HI>I am a Reprobate</HI>! Thou dost <HI>not know,</HI> but that the Powerful and Victorious <HI>Arm</HI> of the Lord, may yet after all, <HI>Turn</HI> thee about, and make a <HI>New Creature</HI> of thee. No one <HI>Knows,</HI> that these forlorn Children shall go down to the <HI>horrible</HI> Pit, which they appear <HI>bound</HI> unto, For there may <HI>be a Month</HI> in which the Sovereign &amp; Victorious Grace of God may yet find 'em, &amp; there may be <HI>Reserves of Mercy</HI> for them. We will go and Weep unto the Lord, that it may be so.</P>
