<HEAD>PROPOSALS CONCERNING <HI>Religious Societies.</HI> Humbly Offered unto GOOD MEN, in the several Towns of the Country: For the REVIVAL of DYING RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been proposed, as a Thing that might be attended with many good Consequences, To Animate and Regulate PRIVATE MEET∣INGS <HI>of Religious People for the Exercises of Religion.</HI></P>
<P>A Decay coming upon them, in many Places, it is thought proper to Reprint what was Published in a Treatise of, <HI>Essays to Do Good,</HI> more than Ten Years ago. Which is in such Terms as these. —</P>
<P>¶ IT is very certain, That where such <HI>Private Meetings</HI> under a good Conduct, have been kept alive, the Christians which have composed them,
<PB N="2" REF="002558_0003_0FDB6F59CD9631F8"/>
have like so many <HI>Coals of the Altar</HI> kept one another alive, and kept up a <HI>lively Christianity</HI> in the Neighbourhood. Such <HI>Societies</HI> have been tried, and strong Engines, to uphold the <HI>Power of Godli∣ness.</HI> The throwing up of such <HI>Societies,</HI> has been accompanied with a Visible <HI>Decay of Godliness,</HI> The less <HI>Love</HI> to them, the less <HI>Use</HI> of them, there has been in a Place, the less has <HI>Godliness</HI> flourished there; the less there has been of the <HI>Kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE Rules observed by some, ASSOCIATED FAMILIES may be offered on this Occasion with some Advantage. They will tell us what Good may be done by such <HI>Societies</HI> in a Neighbourhood.</P>
<P N="1">I. IT is to be proposed, that about a <HI>Dozen Fa∣milies,</HI> more or less, of a Vicinity, agree to meet (the Men and their Wives) at each others Houses, once in a <HI>Fortnight,</HI> or a <HI>Month,</HI> at such a Time as may be agreed upon, and spend a convenient quantity of Time together, in the <HI>Exercises of Religion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Exercises of Religion</HI> for a Meeting, are; For the Brethren to Begin and Conclude with PRAYERS in their Turns; for PSALMS to be Sung; and for SERMONS to be Repeated.</P>
<P N="3">III. IT were desireable, for the <HI>Ministers</HI> now and then, to afford their Presence at the Meeting, and pray with them, and Instruct them, and Exhort them, as they may see Occasion.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE <HI>Candidates of the Ministry</HI> may do well, to perform some of their <HI>First Services</HI> here; and here shapen and mould themselves for further Services.</P>
<P N="5">V. ONE special Design of the Meeting, should be, with United <HI>Prayers,</HI> to ask the Blessings of
<PB N="3" REF="002558_0004_0FDB6F5B4E4B5CE0" MS="y"/>
Heaven on the <HI>Family,</HI> where they are Assemble, as well as on the rest: That with the wondrous Force of <HI>United Prayers, Two or Three may agree on Earth to ask</HI> such things, as are to be done for the Families, by our <HI>Father which is in the Heavens.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. SUCH a Meeting should look upon them∣selves as bound up in one <HI>Bundle of Love,</HI> and count themselves obliged, in very close, and strong <HI>Bonds,</HI> to be serviceable unto one another.</P>
<P>IF any One in the Society shall fall into <HI>Afflic∣tion,</HI> all the Rest should study presently to Relieve and Support the Afflicted Person in all the ways imaginable.</P>
<P>IF any should fall into <HI>Temptation,</HI> the Rest should watch over him, and with the <HI>Spirit of Meekness,</HI> with the <HI>Meekness of Wisdom,</HI> endeavour to recover him.</P>
<P>IT should be like a <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per∣sians</HI> to the whole Society, that they will upon all Occasions, lovingly <HI>Give,</HI> and as lovingly <HI>Take</HI> mutual <HI>Admonitions</HI> of any thing that they see a∣miss in one another.</P>
<P N="7">VII. AND it is not easy to reckon up the <HI>good Offices,</HI> that such a <HI>Society</HI> may do to many <HI>others</HI> as well as to the Members whereof it is itself com∣posed. The <HI>Prayers</HI> of such well disposed <HI>Societies</HI> may fetch down marvellous Favours from Heaven on their <HI>Pastors,</HI> whose <HI>Lives</HI> may be prolonged, and <HI>Gifts</HI> augmented, and <HI>Graces</HI> brightned, and <HI>Labours</HI> prospered, in answer to the Supplications of such <HI>Associated Families</HI>; and the <HI>Interests of Religion</HI> may be mightily preserved and promoted in the whole Flock, by their Fervent Supplications, and the <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> mightily poured out upon the Rising Generation. Yea, <HI>All the Land</HI> may fare the better for them.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="4" REF="002558_0005_0FDB6F5B9DE6F7E0" MS="y"/>VIII. ESPECIALLY, when a <HI>Society,</HI> shall set apart, <HI>whole Days for Prayer with Fasting</HI> before the Lord, as it may be proper for them to do now and then upon some Occasions: The Success of such <HI>Days</HI> has been sometimes very marvellous: And the <HI>Savour</HI> of them left on the Minds of the Saints, who carried them on, has been such as nota∣bly to prepare them, to <HI>show forth the Death of the Lord</HI> at his Table; Yea, to <HI>meet with their own Death</HI>; when GOD pleases to Order it.</P>
<P N="9">IX. IT is very sure, the <HI>Devotions</HI> first, and then after them the <HI>Conferences</HI> carried on in such a <HI>Society,</HI> will not only have a notable Tendency to produce the <HI>Comfort of Love</HI> in the Hearts of Good Men towards one another; But also their <HI>Abilities</HI> will be thereby sharpened and quickened; they will be rendred more <HI>Able,</HI> to serve many valuable Interests.</P>
<P N="10">X. UNEXPECTED Opportunities to <HI>Do Good,</HI> will arise unto such a <HI>Society:</HI> But especially if a Practice of this Importance were once taken up; That the <HI>Men</HI> who compose the <HI>Society,</HI> would now and then spend half an Hour together by them∣selves, in considering on that Question, <HI>What Good is there to be done?</HI></P>
<P>More particularly;</P>
<P><HI>WHO are to be called upon to do their Duty in coming to special Ordinances?</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHO is in any special Adversity, and what shall be done to comfort them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHAT Contention or Variance may there be among any Neighbours, and what may be done for the healing of it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHAT open Miscarriages do any live in; and who shall be desired to carry faithful Admo∣nitions unto them?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002558_0006_0FDB6F5F329130C0" MS="y"/>Finally; <HI>WHAT is there to be done for the Advantage and Advancement of our Holy Reli∣gion?</HI></P>
<P>IN the Primitive Times of Christianity, there was much use made of a saying which they ascribed unto <HI>Matthias</HI> the Apostle; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. If <HI>the Neighbour of an Elect, or Godly Man Sin, the Godly Man has also Sinned.</HI> The Obligations of <HI>Neighbours</HI> watchfully to <HI>Admonish one another,</HI> were what that Saying intended. Oh! How much may <HI>Chris∣tians Associated</HI> in Religious Combinations, do by watchful and faithful Admonitions to prevent being <HI>Partakers in other Mens Sins!</HI></P>
<P>THE Man that shall produce, and promote such <HI>Societies</HI> will do an unknown deal of good in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>AND so will he, that shall help forward another sort of <HI>Societies</HI>; Namely, those of YOUNG MEN ASSOCIATED.</P>
<P>THESE duely managed, have been incomparable <HI>Nurseries</HI> to the Churches, where the faithful Pastors have countenanced them. <HI>Young Men</HI> are hereby preserved from very many <HI>Temptations,</HI> rescued from the <HI>Paths of the Destroyer,</HI> confirm∣ed in the <HI>right Ways of the Lord,</HI> and prepared mightily for such <HI>Religious Exercises</HI> as will be expected from them, when they come themselves to be <HI>Housholders.</HI> I will make a tender of some ORDERS, which have been observed in some such <HI>Societies.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. LET there be <HI>two Hours</HI> at a Time set apart; and let there be <HI>two Prayers</HI> made by the Members of the <HI>Society,</HI> in their Turns; between which let a SERMON be repeated; and there should be the <HI>Singing</HI> of a PSALM annexed.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="002558_0007_0FDB6F608170D1F8"/>II. LET all the Members of the <HI>Society</HI> Resolve to be <HI>Charitably watchful</HI> over one another: ne∣ver to Divulge one anothers <HI>Infirmities</HI>; always to <HI>inform</HI> and <HI>advise</HI> one another of every thing that may appear to call for an <HI>Admonition,</HI> and to <HI>take it kindly,</HI> when they are Admonished.</P>
<P N="3">III. LET all who are to be admitted, as Mem∣bers of the <HI>Society,</HI> be accompanied by two or three of the rest, unto the <HI>Minister</HI> of the Place, that they may receive his holy Counsels and Char∣ges, and that every thing may be done with his Approbation; and so let their <HI>Names</HI> be added unto the <HI>Roll.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. IF any Person thus enrolled among them, fall into a <HI>Scandalous Iniquity,</HI> Let the <HI>Rebukes</HI> of the <HI>Society</HI> be dispensed unto him, and let them forbid him to come any more among them, until he bring suitable Expressions and Evidences of <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> with him.</P>
<P N="5">V. LET the Lift be once a <HI>Quarter</HI> called over; and then, If it be observed, that any of the <HI>Society</HI> have much absented themselves, Let there be some sent unto them, to inquire the <HI>Reason</HI> of their <HI>Absence</HI>; and if no <HI>Reason</HI> be given, but such as intimates an <HI>Apostacy</HI> from good Begin∣nings, Let them upon obstinacy, after loving and faithful Admonitions, be <HI>Obliterated.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. ONCE in three Months, Let there be, if need be, a <HI>Collection,</HI> out of which the <HI>necessary Charges</HI> of the <HI>Society</HI> shall be defrayed, and the rest be employed upon such <HI>Pious Uses</HI> as may be agreed upon.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="7" REF="002558_0008_0FDB6F621017B488" MS="y"/>VII. ONCE in <HI>two Months,</HI> Let the <HI>whole Time</HI> of the Meeting be devoted unto Supplications for the Conversion and Salvation of the <HI>Rising Ge∣neration</HI> in the Land; Particularly, For the Suc∣cess of the Gospel in that Congregation, whereto the <HI>Society</HI> belong.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. LET the whole <HI>Society,</HI> be exceedingly Careful, that their <HI>Discourse</HI> while they are toge∣ther, after the other Services of Religion are over, have nothing in it, that shall have any Taint of <HI>Backbiting</HI> or <HI>Vanity,</HI> or the least Relation to the Affairs of the <HI>Government,</HI> or to things which do not Concern them, and do not serve the Interests of <HI>Holiness</HI> in their own Conversation. But let their Discourse be wholly on <HI>Matters of Religion,</HI> and those also, not the <HI>Disputable</HI> and <HI>Controver∣sal</HI> Matters, but the Points of <HI>Practical Piety.</HI> They may propose <HI>Questions</HI> upon this Intention, and every one in an orderly manner, take his Li∣berty to answer them, or they may go through the <HI>Catechism,</HI> and one at one Time, another at another, heat all the rest Recite the Answers thereof. Or they may be otherwise directed by their <HI>Pastors,</HI> to spend their Time together <HI>Profitably.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. LET every Person in the <HI>Society,</HI> look upon it, as a <HI>Special Task</HI> incumbent on him, to look out for some <HI>other</HI> hopeful Young Man, and use all proper Pains to engage him in the <HI>Resolutions of Godliness,</HI> until he also shall be joined unto the <HI>Society.</HI> And when a <HI>Society</HI> shall be in this Way increased unto a fit Number, Let it swarm into <HI>more</HI>; who may hold an useful <HI>Correspondence</HI> with one another.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002558_0009_0FDB6F6740DD09F0"/>THE Man, who shall be the Instrument of set∣ting up such a <HI>Society</HI> in a Place, cannot compre∣hend unto what a long and Rich Train of <HI>Good Consequences,</HI> he is become Instrumental.</P>
<P>AND they that shall in such a <HI>Society</HI> together carry on the Duties of Christianity, and the Praises of a Glorious CHRIST, will have upon them∣selves, a Blessed <HI>Symptom</HI> that they shall be <HI>toge∣ther Associated</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly City,</HI> and in the Blessedness that shall never have an End.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Pure and Peaceable Wisdom.</HI> Delivered unto a RELIGIOUS SOCIETY, On the First Day of their Meeting.</HEAD>
<P>SHOULD our Gracious GOD open our Eyes to <HI>Discern</HI> and incline our Hearts to <HI>Regard,</HI> the Good Things of His <HI>House</HI> and Kingdom, wherewith He <HI>abundantly satisfies</HI> us, and the <HI>Waters of the Sanctuary,</HI> which run into our very Doors, we could not without a Prodigy of Ingra∣titude and Stupidity do any other, than lift up our Hands to Heaven, and say concerning this Place, <HI>Happy art thou, O people; Who is like unto thee</HI>! We are this Day entering on the Enjoyment of Ad∣vantages, which many <HI>desire to see and cannot</HI>; Advantages to improve in PIETY, and <HI>Edify one another</HI>; Advantages to do those Things which may reader our <HI>Lives</HI> Useful and our <HI>Deaths</HI> Gain∣ful But because we read of some who <HI>know not the Day of their Visitation,</HI> I have chosen those Words of GOD our SAVIOUR for our <HI>Admo∣nition.</HI></P>

<BIBL><HI>LUKE XIX. 42.</HI></BIBL>
<P>If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which be∣long unto thy Peace.</P></Q>
<P><HI>WHO</HI> spoke these Words, and of <HI>whom,</HI> and <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>why,</HI> is well known unto us. What I am immediately to endeavour, is to answer Three QUESTIONS upon them. First, What are the <HI>Things that be∣long unto our Peace</HI>? Then, What it is for us to <HI>know these things?</HI> And lastly, When it may be said, that <HI>a Day</HI> for that Purpose is vouchsafed unto us?</P>
<P>WE are to Consider,</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT are the <HI>Things that belong unto our Peace:</HI></P>
<P>PEACE is a very comprehensive Word. It may in the <HI>Notation</HI> of it be somewhat <HI>Narrow.</HI> The English Word, <HI>Peace,</HI> as the Latin <HI>Pax,</HI> comes [<HI>a Pactione</HI>] from a Word that signifies, <HI>Covenant∣ing.</HI> The Greek Word, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>a Connectendo,</HI>] strictly taken intimates no more than a <HI>Knitting together.</HI> But in the <HI>Acceptation</HI> of it, it is <HI>exceeding Broad.</HI> It comprehends <HI>all man∣ner of Good.</HI> The most comprehensive Salutation the Holy Language can find, is, <HI>Peace be to you.</HI></P>
<P>IN One Word, then, Whatever Tends to pro∣mote our Present and Future <HI>Welfare,</HI> is to be rec∣koned among <HI>the Things that belong unto our Peace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002558_0012_0FDB6F6A48E15890" MS="y"/>YOU shall hear what the chief of them are.</P>
<P>THE First is, FAITH. GOD and the <HI>Unbelie∣ver,</HI> are in Ill Terms with each other. As the <HI>Carnal Mind is Enmity against GOD,</HI> so, <HI>GOD is angry with the Wicked every Day.</HI> Yea, such is His <HI>Anger</HI> as to <HI>Swear in His Wrath against him,</HI> [Heb. III. 18.] if he continue so. The <HI>Un∣believer,</HI> if he continue such, is indeed as sure of <HI>Damnation,</HI> and of a <HI>Wrath unto the Uttermost,</HI> as if he were already fast bound in the dark Fetters and imprisoned in the <HI>Tophet ordained of old.</HI> When CHRIST is offered, then a <HI>Peace</HI> is offered. The offer of a CHRIST, is an offer of <HI>Peace,</HI> to unbelieving Rebels. When a CHRIST was born, the <HI>Morning-Stars that sung for Joy,</HI> triumphed in the mention of, <HI>Peace on Earth,</HI> upon it. Our JESUS is indeed, Isai. IX. 6. <HI>The Prince of Peace.</HI> And He is called, Eph. II. 14. <HI>Our Peace.</HI> Be∣cause, I will not say, <HI>When the Assyrian comes in∣to our Land,</HI> but, when the Almighty comes down in the black Garments of His Vengeance, with the Keen Darts of Justice in His Hand, ready to strike and tread us down in the Place of Dragons. <HI>Then! This Man (who is more than a Man) shall be our Peace</HI>! Now by <HI>Faith</HI> it is, that we get an Interest in a CHRIST, and in the <HI>Peace</HI> which He has wrought; an Interest in <HI>Peace with GOD</HI>; For, Rom. V. 1. <HI>Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</HI> This infers <HI>Peace of Conscience</HI>; For, <HI>Faith</HI> and a <HI>Good Conscience</HI> go hand in hand. Most certain it is, the <HI>Aver∣sion</HI> of GOD for us, would have been Irrecon∣cilable;
<PB N="4" REF="002558_0013_0FDB6F6BC2044FC8"/>
His Wrath against us Irremediable and Unappeasable; and the <HI>Never-Dying Worm,</HI> would be an <HI>Ever-gnawing</HI> one: But, FAITH, <HI>Faith,</HI> is that which brings all to <HI>Peace</HI>; And it may be said of the Believer, as it was of <HI>Solomon,</HI> He <HI>has Peace on all sides round about him.</HI> If a Soul become in this way a <HI>Son of Peace,</HI> then <HI>Peace will rest upon it.</HI> But if it be not so, then <HI>shall be heard a Voice of Trembling and Fear, and not of Peace.</HI> I conclude this Article as <HI>Peter</HI> concludes his Epistle: <HI>Peace be with all them that are in CHRIST JESUS.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second is, REPENTANCE. 'Tis our <HI>League</HI> with Sin, that produces a <HI>War</HI> between GOD and Man. <HI>Your Iniquities have separated!</HI> Indeed, the Sinner blesses himself, saying, <HI>I shall have Peace.</HI> But what an Alarum of <HI>War</HI> has GOD sounded against him? [See Deut. XXIX 19, 20.] Where <HI>Joram</HI> said unto <HI>Jehu, Is it Peace, Jehu?</HI> He answered, <HI>What Peace as long as the Whore∣doms &amp; the Witchcrafts are so many?</HI> So may it be said unto the Impenitent Sinner, <HI>What Peace, as long as thy Indulged Impieties are so many?</HI> And that Peal may be rung in his Ears; Isai XLVIII. 22. <HI>There is no Peace, saith my GOD, unto the Wicked.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unjust man his thoughts</HI>; and All shall be well. But, <HI>If be turn not,</HI> the Almighty hath <HI>what a Sword, and bent a Bow; and prepared for him the Instruments of Death.</HI> Every Im∣penitent Sinner, is a Desperado of that Number, [Act. V. 39.] They are <HI>found even to fight against GOD</HI>; Yea, That <HI>stretch out their hand against GOD, and strengthen themselves
<PB N="5" REF="002558_0014_0FDB6F6F2B31B958" MS="y"/>
against the Almighty, and run upon Him, even upon His Neck, upon the thick Bosses of His Buckler.</HI> Alas, <HI>The way of Peace they have not known.</HI></P>
<P>THE Sinner <HI>Fights</HI> against Heaven, so long as he <HI>Sins</HI> against the GOD of Heaven. The <HI>Arms</HI> of his Rebellion are the <HI>Weapons of Unrighteousness.</HI> Now <HI>Repentance,</HI> this lays down those <HI>Arms</HI> of Rebellion; and like the Man in the Gospel, the Sinner seeing that he cannot grapple with the Almighty, and <HI>is not stronger than He,</HI> he humbles himself, and he <HI>desires Conditions of Peace.</HI> One <HI>Sin</HI> unrepented of will issue in the Confusion of the Soul. <HI>Had Zimri Peace, who slew his Master?</HI> So, Shall that Man have <HI>Peace,</HI> who transgresses the Law, and who tramples on the Authority of his <HI>Master,</HI> a <HI>Master</HI> that is his <HI>Maker</HI> too, and his GOD? He alone is at <HI>Peace</HI> with GOD, who is at <HI>War</HI> with <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>THE Third is, HOLINESS. An <HI>Holy Life.</HI> It is said, Prov. XVI. 7. <HI>When a Mans Ways please the Lord, his Enemies shall be at Peace with him.</HI> Yea, Now not only <HI>the Hosts of the Lord,</HI> but the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> Himself, will be∣come his Friend; and his <HI>Exceeding great Re∣ward.</HI> We read, Rom. VIII. 6. <HI>To be spiritu∣ally-minded is Peace.</HI> Yea, all the ways of <HI>Wis∣dom</HI> are <HI>paths of Peace</HI>; And at Last, <HI>Behold the upright man, for the End of that man is peace. Peace,</HI> is a silken Thread, strung thro' the Actions of an <HI>Holy Life.</HI> Tho' without a Reliance on the Righteousness of our SAVIOUR
<PB N="6" REF="002558_0015_0FDB6F704E45A7F0"/>
for our Acceptance with GOD, our most <HI>Splen∣did Services</HI> will give no other <HI>Peace,</HI> than that which will be <HI>like the Crackling of Thorns under a Pot,</HI> and they who <HI>warm themselves with the sparks of their own kindling</HI> must <HI>lie down in Sorrow:</HI> Alas, the Ragged and Sordid Garments of our own <HI>Righteousness,</HI> will never shelter our naked Souls from the Storms of Divine Vengeance; Yet I may say, The <HI>Peace</HI> of a Believer, arises not only from his <HI>Justification,</HI> but from his <HI>Sanctification</HI> also. Thus we see the Lord owning the <HI>Generation of them that seek Him,</HI> with many Soul quieting Dispensations of His Providence. The <HI>Light of</HI> GOD <HI>shines on the Tabernacle</HI> of the Godly Man. The preserving of his <HI>Garments undefiled,</HI> keeps him from the Horrors and Sorrowful Reflections of a Guilty Mind. And Lastly, <HI>A Good Days Work</HI> meets with a <HI>Good Evenings Wages.</HI> And he sees the Blessing which the Saints of GOD in the ancient Days highly Prized; Even, To <HI>go to the Grave in Peace.</HI> Of all this I may say, <HI>This is the Heritage of the Servants of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>WHO can express the Sweet Quiet of Heart, and ravishing Comfort of Soul, which a <HI>Life led in all Godliness &amp; Honesty</HI> is attended withal: There is a <HI>Sweetness</HI> in the <HI>Work</HI> it self; such, that the Servants of CHRIST have thought their very <HI>Work</HI> to be their <HI>Wages,</HI> There▪ is a Joyful <HI>Serenity of Soul,</HI> that flows in and from a Course of Obedience to GOD. A <HI>Conscience void of Offence</HI> towards GOD and towards Man, how <HI>peaceable</HI> is it! Let the Christian, who thro' Carelesness has fallen from
<PB N="7" REF="002558_0016_0FDB6F738B155F30" MS="y"/>
GOD, and thro' an <HI>Evil Heart of Unbelief de∣parted</HI> from Him, declare how much Salt Water, and how deep Humiliations it has cost him, to obtain a recovery. Verily, Isai. XXXII. 17. <HI>The work of Righteousness, it shall be peace.</HI> To be daily beating down our Corruptions, and striv∣ing against the <HI>Sins that easily beset us</HI>; Daily Endeavouring to <HI>Grow in the Grace &amp; Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour,</HI> getting on <HI>from Strength to Strength</HI>; Daily maintaining an Intimate <HI>Communion</HI> with GOD; Shall not the <HI>Fruit</HI> of this be, <HI>Peace, Peace?</HI> And, <HI>Is not this to know me, saith the Lord!</HI> To <HI>Endure Hardness as good Soldiers of Jesus CHRIST</HI>; and <HI>Work out our own Salvation</HI>; and be always doing the Will and Work of our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI>; Is not this the <HI>way of Peace?</HI> Yea, <HI>Great Peace have they</HI> (O Lord,) <HI>that Love thy Law!</HI></P>
<P>WE are to consider,</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT it is for us to <HI>KNOW the Things that belong to our Peace.</HI></P>
<P>Now,</P>
<P>First; THE <HI>Nature</HI> of the Things; we must have a Right <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>That.</HI> So we read about, <HI>Knowing the Grace of GOD. Ignorance</HI> is indeed the <HI>Mother of Destruction.</HI> The <HI>Blind</HI> fall into the <HI>Ditch.</HI> The way to Heaven is a <HI>Narrow way</HI>; And tho' it be said, <HI>The way∣faring men, tho' Fools, shall not err therein</HI>; yet <HI>foolish</HI> Man, who is <HI>born like the wild Asses Colt,</HI> must have a CHRIST for his <HI>Prophet,</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="002558_0017_0FDB6F764F7CD800"/>
in that way be <HI>made Wise unto Salvation,</HI> or else he will <HI>Err,</HI> and be for ever a Stranger to the <HI>way of peace.</HI> O Ignorant Creature, The <HI>Darkness</HI> of thy <HI>Mind,</HI> will bring thee down to the <HI>Darkness</HI> of the <HI>Pit. Ignorance,</HI> Ah, Bloody Cur-throat unto Millions of Precious and Immor∣tal Souls! How should People be Saved, with∣out <HI>Knowing</HI> the way of Salvation; or, Enjoy <HI>Peace</HI> without <HI>Knowing</HI> the way to the <HI>Jerusa∣lem?</HI> The <HI>Gospel of Peace</HI> is therefore such an inestimable Jewel; Because we have the means of <HI>Knowledge</HI> in it.</P>
<P>IT was once prescribed, <HI>Acquaint thy self with GOD, and be at peace.</HI> Even so, Let People <HI>Acquaint</HI> themselves with <HI>Faith,</HI> and with <HI>Repentance,</HI> and with <HI>Holiness,</HI> if they would <HI>seek peace and pursue it.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are <HI>Mysteries</HI> in <HI>Faith.</HI> People often delude themselves with an <HI>Historical Faith,</HI> as if it were enough to yield some Kind of <HI>Assent</HI> unto the Truth; or with a <HI>presumptuous Faith,</HI> taking it for granted that their Sins are pardon∣ed, whether ever they have with a distressed Soul sought for it, or no; or with an <HI>Imper∣fect Faith,</HI> receiving a CHRIST in some of His Offices, but not in all of them. So, forsooth, now they have Commenced <HI>Believers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>REPENTANCE</HI> has <HI>Mysteries</HI> in it. Hence People fancy, and harbour Conceits, that now and then, a, <HI>Lord, Forgive me</HI>! Or, A few sleight <HI>Convictions</HI> of what they have done when they have Sinned; Or the <HI>Reluctancies</HI> of an
<PB N="9" REF="002558_0018_0FDB6F77D89B1280" MS="y"/>
<HI>Heart smiling</HI> of them, and roaring terrible things upon them, and compelling them to fall down on their Knees, and come to some <HI>Good Resolutions</HI> never to Offend in the like sort again; or some Terrors of the <HI>Law,</HI> which are like the Flashes of Hell-fire already singeing of them; — are the <HI>Repentance not to be Repented of.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HOLINESS</HI> has <HI>Mysteries</HI> in it. Hence People take and mistake, a few <HI>Formal Duties,</HI> or such Things as are the meer <HI>Bark</HI> or <HI>Shell</HI> of Religion; A <HI>Partial Obedience</HI>; or some notable Works done, but then vainly trusted in, (and so, but <HI>Splendid Sins</HI> after all!) ——To be the <HI>Obedience of Faith,</HI> and the <HI>Godliness which has the Promise.</HI></P>
<P>MANY hear much about <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Re∣pentance,</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> who never arrive to any other, than a Superficial <HI>Knowledge</HI> of these Things; They have no real Insight into them. They lie, <HI>Multitudes, multitudes,</HI> in the <HI>Valley</HI> of Perdition; And if the Enquiry be, <HI>Who has done this?</HI> The Reply must be that; Hosea IV. 6. <HI>My People are destroyed for the lack of Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, THE Things are to be <HI>Prized,</HI> Valued, Esteemed; There must be seen an <HI>Excellency</HI> in them. To <HI>Know</HI> is to know the <HI>Worth</HI> of them. <HI>Faith</HI> is to be Prized, as, 2 Pet. I. 1. <HI>Precious Faith. Repentance</HI> is to be Prized, as, 2 Cor. VII. 10. <HI>Not to be Repented of. Holiness</HI> is to be Prized, as, 1 Tim. IV. 8.
<PB N="10" REF="002558_0019_0FDB6F794353DE20"/>
<HI>Profitable unto all Things.</HI> Indeed, <HI>The Bru∣tish Man knows not, neither does the Fool under∣stand this.</HI> The Blind, and Hard, and Sottish Hearts of Sinful Men, don't Think of these Things. <HI>Jerusalem</HI> did not think, that if she <HI>Reverenced the Son of GOD,</HI> and <HI>Repented of the Evil of her Doings,</HI> and <HI>Hearkened unto GOD, and Walked in His Ways,</HI> then her <HI>Peace</HI> would have <HI>been as a River, and her Righ∣teousness as the Waves of the Sea.</HI> The Anti-type of <HI>David</HI> would have <HI>prayed for the Peace of Jerusalem,</HI> yea, have given <HI>Peace</HI> to it. His GOD and Father, would have said, <HI>Peace be within thee!</HI> But <HI>not knowing the Things that belonged unto their Peace,</HI> not <HI>Knowing</HI> or Thinking how much they should find their Ac∣count in those Things, the Lord of the Vine∣yard came, and <HI>destroyed the Wicked Men.</HI></P>
<P>THUS 'tis, with a World of Men and Wo∣men in the World. Cumbered with <HI>many Things,</HI> they will not see, that the coming to a CHRIST is the <HI>One Thing that is needful</HI> for them. A <HI>Laodicea</HI> can do well enough with∣out the <HI>Gold,</HI> and <HI>Garment,</HI> and <HI>Eye Salve</HI> of her SAVIOUR. Many say, <HI>The Stolen Waters are Sweet.</HI> Many say, <HI>What is the Al∣mighty that we should Serve Him, and what profit should we have if we pray unto Him?</HI> To have this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> removed, and the Scales drop from our Eyes; and have a New, Clear, Strong, Sight of the Estimate which is to be made of the <HI>Things which are not seen,</HI> and which affect our <HI>Eternal</HI> Happiness; This, This is to <HI>Know the Things belonging to our
<PB N="11" REF="002558_0020_0FDB6F7C044E7290" MS="y"/>
peace.</HI> They who have studied the <HI>Style of the Scripture,</HI> tell us, <HI>Words of Knowledge imply Affection.</HI> So when our SAVIOUR says to some, <HI>I never knew you,</HI> He means, <HI>I ne∣ver liked you.</HI> Which is what He will say to them, who <HI>know not</HI> what we are now speak∣ing of. <HI>Reprobate Silver, the Lord has Re∣jected them.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, THE Things are to be <HI>Closed</HI> with∣al. To <HI>know Sin,</HI> [Isaiah LIX. 12.] is, to <HI>be</HI> a Sinner; To <HI>know the only True GOD, and JESUS CHRIST whom He hath sent,</HI> is to <HI>Cleave</HI> unto Him. To <HI>know Faith,</HI> is to <HI>be</HI> a Believer. To <HI>know Repentance,</HI> is to <HI>be</HI> a Penitent. To <HI>know Holiness</HI> is to <HI>be</HI> Obedi∣ent, and <HI>Holy in all manner of Conversation.</HI> 'Tis an <HI>Experimental Knowledge</HI> in these things, that is the only <HI>profitable Knowledge.</HI> They are like the <HI>New Name</HI> whereof we read, Rev. II. 17. <HI>No man knows it but he that HAS it.</HI> The Christian must have [an, <HI>Intus Existens</HI>] a, <HI>Something within</HI>; Some Divine Sparks of a <HI>Supernatural Knowledge,</HI> that give him other Visions of these Heavenly Things, than what those have, who can only talk like <HI>Parrots</HI> of them. <HI>Regeneration</HI> must be <HI>known</HI> and <HI>felt</HI> by us, in another manner than by a <HI>Nicodemus, Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> must be <HI>known</HI> with a sensible <HI>Experi∣ence</HI> of those things. It must be an <HI>Impressive Knowledge.</HI> There must be such an <HI>Impression</HI> of those things upon us, as to give us a very <HI>Lively Apprehension</HI> of them. To <HI>Know</HI> them, is to <HI>Taste</HI> them; to <HI>Taste</HI> these <HI>powers of
<PB N="12" REF="002558_0021_0FDB6F7DDAD54B10"/>
the World to come</HI>; To <HI>Live</HI> them, and so have the <HI>Life of GOD</HI> within us.</P>
<P>WE are to Consider,</P>
<P N="3">III. WHEN may it be said, That we have <HI>OUR DAY Vouchsafed us to Know the Things belonging to our Peace.</HI></P>
<P>THE true and proper Limits of our DAY, will be found in the <HI>Motions</HI> of the Holy SPIRIT upon us. But then there are some Other Things, which so far make <HI>Our Day,</HI> that be∣fore <HI>Our Day</HI> is <HI>done,</HI> when they are gone; tho' it may also be <HI>done</HI> before it.</P>
<P>First. <HI>DAY</HI> Lasts as long as <HI>Life</HI> lasts.</P>
<P>IN this, the Children of GOD have <HI>Their Day.</HI> They are therefore so instructed; John IX. 4. <HI>I must Work while it is Day; the Night comes in which no Man can Work.</HI> Our Time of <HI>Living,</HI> is our Time for <HI>Working.</HI> As the Fourth Commandment has it, <HI>Six Days shalt thou Work and Rest the Seventh</HI>: So GOD sends us into the World, and says, <HI>I have some Work for thee to do; some Glory to be brought about by thee in the World; Thou hast but a little Time to do it in. What thy Hand finds to do, do it with thy might. I have betrusted thee with some Talents. Im∣prove them Faithfully, Prudently, Diligently. And when I send my Messenger DEATH to call thee, thou shall find a Crown reserved for thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002558_0022_0FDB6F8079260140" MS="y"/>YEA, and in this they lie still <HI>Dead in their Trespasses and Sins,</HI> have <HI>Their Day</HI> too▪ GOD is all their Days Calling on them▪ <HI>Stretching out His Hands unto them all the Day long.</HI> Earnestly Calling, <HI>How long, ye Fools; Will you hate Knowledge?</HI> But when the Term of <HI>Life</HI> is just Expiring, and the last Sand in the Glass is running, and He has con∣tinued inviting them into His Vineyard, until the <HI>Eleventh Hour</HI> be out, and the <HI>Last Hour</HI> be upon them; and their <HI>Destruction comes as a Whirlwind,</HI> GOD then laughs <HI>at their Destruction,</HI> and leaves them in the Dimness of the Anguish of Death, and the Griping Talons of a dreadful Eternity. <HI>The Living, The Liv∣ing,</HI> They may <HI>Praise</HI> GOD, and get into <HI>Peace</HI> with GOD. <HI>But they that go down into the Pit cannot Hope</HI> for any more. The <HI>Things of our Peace</HI> have taken an Eternal Farewell of them.</P>
<P>Secondly, THE <HI>Means of Grace,</HI> help to make <HI>Our Day</HI> for us. The Old World, whose <HI>Foundation was overflown with a Flood,</HI> enjoyed a <HI>Day,</HI> while they had <HI>Noah,</HI> a <HI>Preach∣er of Righteousness</HI> among them. This <HI>Preach∣ing</HI> was no sooner over, but their <HI>Day</HI> was done. Cries to Heaven for Succour were now to lit∣tle Purpose. The <HI>Ark</HI> being now shut, the Ear of GOD was also shut upon them. <HI>Sodom</HI> had a Day, whilst <HI>Righteous Lot</HI> was beating his Testimonies there. But when he is gone, their <HI>Day</HI> goes with him. The <HI>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</HI> seizes them. They sadly found,
<PB N="14" REF="002558_0023_0FDB6F819B4A8E98"/>
when the <HI>Mouth</HI> of GOD leaves off <HI>Speaking,</HI> his <HI>Ear</HI> leaves off <HI>Hearing</HI> too. When the <HI>Means of Grace</HI> are gone from a People, <HI>Their Day</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er with them. It is often so, that upon the Death of an Excellent Minister, the People that had his <HI>Light for a Season,</HI> but would not be brought home to GOD, have <HI>Their Day</HI> brought unto a Period. GOD leaves them under an Ever∣lasting Obduration. He Resolves, <HI>They shall never taste of my Supper! Never Enter into my Rest!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>OUR Day</HI> is Enlightened, when it is accompanied with many <HI>Opportunities</HI> to make sure of <HI>The Things belonging to our Peace.</HI> A <HI>Peaceable Time</HI> with us, and a Prosperous Con∣dition, makes a <HI>Day</HI> to shine upon us. A Day of <HI>Prosperity,</HI> Oh! how much is it to be im∣proved with us! We generally allow, that <HI>Ad∣versity</HI> has a <HI>Voice</HI> in it: GOD <HI>Speaks</HI> to us by our <HI>Afflictions.</HI> But in <HI>Prosperity</HI> our <HI>Fat Hearts</HI> are insensible of any thing <HI>spoke</HI> to us: As if <HI>Mercy</HI> were a very <HI>Dumb Thing</HI> indeed! Whereas, Jer. XXII. 21. <HI>I spake to thee in thy Prosperity, saith the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Still Voice</HI> of <HI>Prosperity</HI> is not so plainly heard, as the Thun∣der and the Tempest and the Whirlwind of <HI>Calamity:</HI> Yet there is the <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD in it And what is the <HI>Voice</HI> but This; <HI>Oh! That this man would now know the Things of his Peace, at least in this his Day!</HI> What but This; <HI>Oh! That this man were wise, and would consider his latter End.</HI> How pittyable the Case of <HI>Jeru∣salem?</HI> Lam. I. 7. <HI>Jerusalem remembred in the days of her Affliction and of her Miseries,
<PB N="15" REF="002558_0024_0FDB6F8300325E88" MS="y"/>
all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old!</HI> So it is; Many a Man lives in the Enjoy∣ment of <HI>pleasant things;</HI> If he will <HI>Now</HI> Turn and Live unto GOD, there shall be nothing to disturb him, nothing to divert him. He loiters the Time away; His Lusts like noisome Insects, do but multiply by the Sune-shine. At last, a provoked GOD comes with heavy Blows, with bitter, blasting, ruining Strokes of His Indignation; Strips him of all his Comfortable Advantages; and now the poor Man cannot Serve GOD as once he could; His Way is every where <HI>hedged up with Thorns</HI>; and he hath nothing left, but a grievous Reflection on his <HI>Expired Opportunities.</HI></P>
<P>A Mans <HI>Prosperous Time</HI> is often his <HI>Proba∣tion Time.</HI> If he be not <HI>NOW</HI> brought home to GOD, he shall never be so. <HI>Saul</HI> Exalted and Victorious, falling into a Remarkable Disobedi∣ence, never sees a <HI>Good Day</HI> after it.</P>
<P>HENCE 'tis, that <HI>Early Religion</HI> is to be Commended unto us. <HI>Children,</HI> If ever you would Serve GOD with Comfort, <HI>Begin Betimes</HI> to do it; <HI>Betimes,</HI> before the <HI>Evil Days come,</HI> whereof you will say, <HI>I have no pleasure in them.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. THE Holy SPIRIT of GOD at work upon the Soul; This constitutes <HI>Our Day</HI> in the fairest and brightest Appearance of it. The other Circumstances give <HI>Time</HI> to us; <HI>This</HI> does invest us with <HI>Opportunity.</HI> The <HI>Opportunity</HI> to approach and address the <HI>Master of the House</HI> must be before, Luk. 13.25. <HI>He hath
<PB N="16" REF="002558_0025_0FDB6F87DBBBF5D8"/>
risen up, and shut to the Door.</HI> Men may sit under the Gospel all their Days; But they will not come into the <HI>Peace of GOD,</HI> except <HI>they seek Him while He may be found,</HI> and <HI>call upon Him while He is near.</HI> There is a Time when our SAVIOUR says. Rev. III. 20. <HI>Behold, I stand at the Door and knock.</HI> The Soul which <HI>Then</HI> does <HI>Open</HI> to Him, is an Happy Soul. But, thy Delays, O Dilatory Soul, may render thee like <HI>Esau,</HI> who <HI>Afterwards,</HI> when he came, and would have <HI>Inherited the Blessing,</HI> miss'd of it, tho' he <HI>Sought it carefully with Tears.</HI> We should, as we say, <HI>Strike while the Iron is hot.</HI> The Godly themselves may pay dear for their Neglect of doing so. <HI>My Beloved has withdrawn Himself and is gone!</HI> — may be the Conse∣quence. But this is that which above all issues in the <HI>Perdition of Ungodly Men.</HI> The SPIRIT of GOD visits them with His <HI>Motions.</HI> He does it in <HI>Sermons</HI>; He does it in <HI>Troubles</HI>; He does it in various <HI>Methods.</HI> He stirs up <HI>Affections</HI> in them, for the Things that are <HI>Holy and Just and Good.</HI> They have such an <HI>Opportunity</HI> to enter the <HI>Strait Gate,</HI> as the <HI>Israelites</HI> had for an Entrance into the <HI>Land of Promise.</HI> They neglect it; And now, when they come <HI>too Late,</HI> and <HI>Weep</HI> unto the LORD, the LORD will not hearken to them. The <HI>Door</HI> is now shut, and if they come with the <HI>Foolish Virgins,</HI> and cry, <HI>Lord, Lord, Open to me!</HI> the cry avails nothing; He answers, <HI>I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>FOR this Cause it is, that the Bible does insist so much upon <HI>present Obedience.</HI> Thus, Eccles. XII. 1. <HI>Remember NOW thy Creator.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="002558_0026_0FDB6F892AB4E068" MS="y"/>
Thus, Jer. XXV. 5. <HI>Turn ye NOW every One from his Evil Way.</HI> Thus, 2 Cor. VI. 2. <HI>Behold, NOW is the Acceptable Time, NOW is the Day of Salvation.</HI> q. d. This is all the <HI>Day</HI> you are sure of; Lose this NOW, and you shall never have another. Look into the Third Chapter to the <HI>Hebrews</HI>; 'Tis urged there, <HI>To DAY if you will hear His Voice.</HI> And over and over again it comes, <HI>To Day! To Day! To Day!</HI> As if the taking of, <HI>To Day,</HI> were that which <HI>Eternity</HI> depended on.</P>
<P>AND now, My Brethren; Will you <HI>Know the Things of your Peace?</HI> O <HI>Unregenerates,</HI> Defer not a Moment the <HI>Things that Accom∣pany Salvation.</HI> Yea, Let none remain at all Unacquainted with the Things which must be done by all that would be <HI>Saved.</HI> If you do <HI>Know</HI> something of them, Take that Advice, Hosea VI. 3. <HI>Follow on to Know.</HI> Perhaps, My Friend, Thy <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> may be yet but at the best, as a <HI>Grain of Mustard Seed.</HI> Yea, The best of us all have need of <HI>more Grace</HI> than we have. You are not yet come to <HI>Perfection.</HI> Certain∣ly, You need more Weanedness from the World, more Heavenly-Mindedness, more <HI>Fervency of Spirit</HI> in <HI>Serving</HI> the Lord; a more <HI>United Heart</HI> in <HI>Fearing</HI> of His Name; a more Self-Abasing, and CHRIST-Exalting Disposition. May not the best of us Complain, <HI>My Lean∣ness! My Leanness</HI>! Yea, May they not come into the Herd with <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Lean Kine; which though they had <HI>Eaten much,</HI> it could
<PB N="18" REF="002558_0027_0FDB6F8A83791190"/>
not be known, that they had <HI>Eaten at all</HI>! Truly, When our GOD comes to look upon us, He may say, <HI>Be astonished, O ye Heavens! Is this the people whom I fed so daintily? Fed with my Word and Sacraments; yea, Fed with my Son! Are these the Persons, whom I made to sit down at my Table, sit down at a Feast of Fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well-refined. O</HI> Ephraim. <HI>What shall I do unto thee?</HI> O Judah, <HI>What shall I do unto thee?</HI> Oh! That the <HI>Things of our Peace</HI> were better <HI>Known</HI> among us! But then, The <HI>Day of our Peace</HI> must be so too. In the <HI>Day</HI> for that Purpose bestowed upon us, Let us Press after the fullest <HI>Knowledge</HI> of these <HI>Ne∣cessary Things.</HI> The Time we now spend in the Exercises of <HI>Religion,</HI> be assured, O Travel∣ler towards another World, It will be <HI>no grief of Mind unto thee another day. Religion,</HI> 'Tis thy Business, Make it so; and Mind not thy <HI>Inn</HI> more than thy <HI>Home.</HI> Soul Bound for Heaven, In thy <HI>Opportunities</HI> to <HI>Know the Things of thy Peace,</HI> and make sure of Ever∣lasting <HI>Peace,</HI> What a <HI>Price</HI> is there put <HI>into thy Hand?</HI> Oh! Let it not be in the <HI>Hand of a Fool.</HI> My Friends, Our Formation this Day into a RELIGIOUS SOCIETY brings the <HI>Things of our Peace</HI> near unto us▪ and gives us a <HI>Day</HI> to <HI>know</HI> those Things; and furnishes us with Uncommon <HI>Advantages</HI> for the <HI>getting</HI> and the <HI>doing</HI> of <HI>Good.</HI> As <HI>Moses</HI> of old wish∣ed. <HI>Oh! that they were Wise</HI>: Give my Strammer∣ing Tongue leave to say; Oh! That we <HI>knew the Day of our Visitation</HI>; and so <HI>Numbred our Days as to apply our Hearts unto Wisdom</HI>! Oh!
<PB N="19" REF="002558_0028_0FDB6F8E6DFFC990"/>
That the <HI>Day of our Peace</HI> were duly perceived and observed with us, and highly accounted of, and so husbanded, that we may give a good Ac∣count of it! Oh! That we may to Improve our Inestimable <HI>Opportunities,</HI> to Converse with our SAVIOUR, and become <HI>Full of Goodness,</HI> and <HI>build up</HI> our selves and one another in the <HI>most holy Faith,</HI> as that when we are to be taken from these <HI>Opportunities,</HI> we may be found <HI>so doing,</HI> and hear it said, <HI>Well-done, Good and Faithful Servant, Enter into the Joy of thy LORD.</HI></P>
