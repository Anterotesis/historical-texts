<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON FREE MASONRY.</HEAD>
<P>AS you are no stranger, Madam, to my enthusiastic opinion, that Morpheus is frequently accompanied by some supernat∣ural companion, in his midnight wander∣ings, I flatter myself that you will indulge me with the perusal of one of my moon light excursions. The masonic figures can be ex∣plained by your respectable companion, who, from principles of benevolence, will not re∣fuse to gratify you; and perhaps, Madam, it may occasion your becoming a convert to a good opinion of the sublime art.</P>
<P>The dreary season, ill health, and a de∣pression of spirits which unfits me for soci∣ciety,
<PB N="4" REF="034027_0003_0FFA2FCEFB244628"/>
occasion my devoting a part of my time to dreaming. And what is life, but a dream? Half the world appears to most ad∣vantage when asleep; and I am one of that number.</P>
<P>The Right Worshipful Master, after pe∣rusing the enclosed, (should he confer upon me that honor) will, with his usual pleas∣antry, I expect, ask when I was initiated. I answer—At my birth. <HI>Faith, Hope</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> presided: <HI>Wisdom, Strength</HI> and <HI>Beau∣ty</HI> refused to attend. And, with unusual care and attention, my three godmothers, ere the dawn of reason expanded my ideas, laid the foundation of a masonic structure, Benevo∣lence and Philanthropy, in my breast. Are there not Miltons at the plough, and States∣men in the field? And why not Masonesses at the toilet? If secrecy in charity, and dis∣positions to oblige a neighbor or a friend, are pillars of the Craft, our sex may vie with a Solomon, a Hiram, or the best ancient or modern master builders, in raising them.</P>
<P>The sublime institution of Masonry, I fancy, was ordained by the wise Architect of
<PB N="5" REF="034027_0004_0FFA2FD1F62F9118"/>
the universal Lodge, to <HI>level</HI> the masculine character of the other sex with the feminine softness of ours; by <HI>tempering</HI> Courage, For∣titude and Gravity, with Candor, Benevo∣lence and Charity, and <HI>cementing</HI> them with Friendship, Sensibility and Affection. Were our sex admitted into the society, it would counteract the grand design, as we have gen∣erally too great a proportion of those delicate feelings, in our composition, for our own happiness. The science of Masonry, I view as a refined study of nature, entirely divested of those insidious arts, that (from their <HI>secre∣cy, order,</HI> and <HI>signs,</HI> by which the Brethren discover themselves to each other) many ju∣dicious persons, of both sexes, have been led to believe they practise. It is a science, that is both useful and instructive. It refines the understanding, softens the manners, blends together every virtue of the human heart, and teaches us to distinguish between the fa∣vors of fortune, and real merit. Masonry has been stiled the "Daughter of Heaven, Patroness of the liberal arts, that polish and adorn the mind," &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="034027_0005_0FFA2FD9B68A14F8"/>As we naturally esteem our companions, in proportion as they excel us in knowledge, Is it not happy for us, that Masonry is con∣fined to man? Happy, thrice happy, would it have been for her descendants, if Madam Eve, instead of tasting the apple, had po∣litely presented it to her spouse. This mis∣take was never rectified, till the eastern Mon∣arch was inspired with the ideas of building a temple, founding a Lodge, and consecrat∣ing it as sacred forever from the old lady's female descendants. But we enjoy this pleas∣ing consolation, that it has a tendency to at∣tach them to our sex—"Next to the Deity," says a Right Worshipful Master, at the close of a charge to his Lodge, "whom can I so properly address myself to, as to the most beautiful part of the creation. The sanction of the fair is our highest ambition; to pre∣serve it will be our greatest care." And al∣though flattery may be termed a foible, (if the Honorable Fraternity will pardon the expression) in some instances, in this in par∣ticular, it appears a virtue. "Honey," says the proverb, "has caught more flies than
<PB N="7" REF="034027_0006_0FFA2FDB853E7BC8"/>
vinegar;" and who is proof against the charm of adulation, when the alluring bait is so delicately gilt.</P>
<P>To be serious. A good Mason may be compared to a respectable Divine. The lec∣tures of the former, and the precepts of the latter, are equally interesting. One instructs us in the principles of morality; the other explains the mysteries of divinity: Both point to the same grand view—the temple of Virtue. The three steps of this noble edifice, Justice, Love and Mercy, it is in our power to ascend; and were we clothed with Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, and adorned with Faith and Charity, reclining on Hope, we might extend our prospect, and, with the aid of three times three, be introduced into the <HI>Royal Arch</HI> of Safety, which would preserve us from the dangerous shoals and quicksands of folly and dissipation, upon which so many of the vain and thoughtless, of both sexes, suffer shipwreck.</P>
<P>A good Mason must be a good man; and a good man is a Mason. Upon the pillars of Justice, Benevolence, and Humility, he
<PB N="8" REF="034027_0007_0FFA0D3EE94B51D0"/>
raises an edifice, which will remain firm as the adamantine rock. Slander may at∣tack <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s walls, Malice assault its battle∣ments, and Calumny batter its spacious roof, but all in vain. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will remain impregna∣ble, when the pillars of the universe are shaken, "and the great globe itself, like the baseless fabric of a vision," vanishes at the command of the Almighty Architect. Borne up on those pillars, amidst a chaos of na∣ture, he will arrive at the summit of happi∣ness, in the celestial mansions of peace and harmony, and gain admission into the "Uni∣versal Lodge," founded at the creation; whose Grand Master sits enthroned in light and glory, and surveys the hearts of all at one view; whose Lodge is stiled the Holy of Ho∣lies; where all distinctions are annihilated— the Knight Templar levelled with the En∣tered Apprentice, the Royal Arch with the Fellow Craft, and the widow's son rank no higher than her daughters, provided th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lat∣ter are clothed in their necessary <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wels,</HI> In∣nocence and Virtue.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN consequence of an invitation from one of the members of the Honorable Fraternity, the other evening, to visit a Lodge, my thoughts were engaged with the subject of such a visit, and I fell into a most profound reverie. By the assistance of Mor∣pheus, I was conveyed, in a moment, to the <HI>Morning Star</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of the Lodge at Worcester.</NOTE> the Lodge was <HI>tyled</HI>; the <HI>S— S—m,</HI> or court cabinet, was un∣locked, and the emblems of the Royal Art properly arranged and displayed; the <HI>mur∣dered Knight</HI> rose from the awful silence of the tomb, and seated himself upon the left hand of his Royal Master, while his <HI>name
<PB N="10" REF="034027_0009_0FFA2FE4959C68E0"/>
sake,</HI> to complete the order, sat upon his right; the Senior and Junior Grand War∣dens, agreeably to their ancient custom, were placed in the East and West; the tapers were eclipsed amidst a blaze of jewels, which were excelled only by the bright luminary of heav∣en in meridian splendor. No eloquence can convey an idea of the <HI>beauty, order,</HI> and <HI>har∣mony,</HI> which reigned. Like the glory of the apostle's third heaven, it could not be reveal∣ed. They were such, indeed, as the eye of the uninitiated hath not seen, nor hath it entered into the heart of a cowan to con∣ceive. But my impatience for information exceeded all bounds. I asked for the <HI>signs</HI> of the different orders of <HI>entered, passed, rais∣ed</HI> and <HI>arched.</HI> But I asked in vain.—No voice was heard.—A universal silence reign∣ed.—I then began to fancy myself with the disciples of Pythagoras, or that the grand secret of Masonry was to become speechless.</P>
<P>After admiring their prudence in exclud∣ing females, (for it would be scarcely possible for the different sexes to assemble and keep silence, even in heaven, for half an hour,) I
<PB N="11" REF="034027_0010_0FFA2FE9E4836D68"/>
acknowledge I began to fancy a silent heav∣en no heaven for me; and meditated an es∣cape: When, lo!—
<Q><L>Sacred to heaven, behold, the dome appears,</L>
<L>See what august solemnity it wears!</L></Q>
In a moment, as if by enchantment, appear∣ed a beautiful fabric, whose base was Benev∣olence, and whose strength was Peace and Harmony. The <HI>Plumbline, Square</HI> and <HI>Com∣passes,</HI> were placed upon the <HI>Tressel Board,</HI> as emblems of the proportion of the design. On a beautiful column sat <HI>Faith, Hope</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> viewing Misfortune. On another reclined <HI>Wisdom, Strength</HI> and <HI>Beauty,</HI> cast∣ing a benignant smile upon those benefac∣tors of mankind. Here, regardless of the awful silence that reigned, I exclaimed with the Oratorio,
<Q><L>Angels themselves have deign'd to deck the frame,</L>
<L>Behold they come upon the wings of light,</L>
<L>And with their shining vestments cheer the sight.</L>
<L>To heaven's high Architect all praise,</L>
<L>All gratitude be given,</L>
<L>Who deign'd the human soul to raise,</L>
<L>By secrets sprung from heaven.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034027_0011_0FFA2FC3036B80E8"/>I was proceeding in this rapturous strain, when Phoebus, who had just mounted his golden car, displayed his splendid rays upon my pillow, and I awoke, as much confused in my ideas, perhaps, as an entered Appren∣tice, when just introduced from darkness into light; but with the pleasing consola∣tion, that I was not intrusted with those profound secrets, so essential to preserve the art.</P>
<Q><L>To all, who Masonry despise,</L>
<L>This counsel I bestow,</L>
<L>Don't ridicule, if you are wise,</L>
<L>A secret you don't know.</L>
<L>From ignorance alone proceeds,</L>
<L>A mean opinion of their deeds.</L></Q>

<HEAD>A LETTER. To — —.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE neglected to send you the inclosed copy of a Letter, (accompani∣ed with the Masonic Vision) which I wrote to Mrs. *****, from the conjectures which arose in my mind, respecting the purpose it might answer. I, at length, indulge your request, not to gratify my vanity, or sound the trumpet of fame; but, perhaps, to af∣ford you a little hilarity at high meridian.</P>
<P>My connections with the masonic order, naturally lead me to reverence it. I am the daughter, the sister, and have been twice the beloved wife, of a Mason; yet curiosity nev∣er tempted me to ask any questions upon the subject—sensible that the sacred obliga∣tions, by which they are bound to silence, are registered in heaven—more sacred than
<PB N="14" REF="034027_0013_0FFA2FB864217F18"/>
the emblematic Roll—the ever blooming Sprig—the sympathetic Tear—or the respon∣sive <HI>"So mote it be."</HI></P>
<P>The Sacred Volume, and the books pub∣lished under the sanction of the Fraternity, contain all the knowledge in the sublime art, necessary for my sex. Jachin and Boaz, and the spurious writings of other Evesdrop∣pers, are too trifling to merit either my censure or contempt—For,
<Q><L>Who can unfold the Royal Art,</L>
<L>Or shew its secrets in a song:</L>
<L>They're safely kept in Masons' hearts,</L>
<L>And to the ancient Lodge belong.</L></Q></P>

with esteem, Yours, &amp;c. — —.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
