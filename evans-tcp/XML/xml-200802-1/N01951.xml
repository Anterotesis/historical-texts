<Q><HI>But GOD is the Judge: He putteth down one, and setteth up another.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ONE Objection made against the goodness of divine Providence which a late Learned Writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Sherlock's</HI> Discourse of the Divine Providence. Pag. 324. Edit. 4.</NOTE> takes notice of, is, <HI>God'</HI>s <HI>Partial &amp; unequal Care of his creatures;</HI> the foundation of which Ob∣jection is; <HI>that there are various Ranks &amp; Con∣ditions of men in the world; Rich and Poor, High and Low, Princes and Subjects,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But how∣ever atheistical wits may argue from the va∣riety of mens Conditions, certain it is that the various Ranks and degrees of men are for the advantage and benefit of mankind in Ge∣neral, in as much as without this variety, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f all mens Conditions were alike, men would want some Motives and Encouragements to
<PB N="2" REF="002323_0004_0FDC0EDB168C52D8"/>
Vertue &amp; Restraint from Vice, that now they have; and there could be no such thing as Government in the world, which is a thing so necessary to the well-being of it, that any thing conducive hereunto Rather argues a good Providence over the world, than the Contrary.</P>
<P>Government is a great Blessing to this Sinful &amp; Miserable world, &amp; if it should be destitute thereof, it would soon become a heap of Confusion, a stage of mournful Trage∣dies, a Theater of woful Spectacles; the whole world might fitly be called, Aceldama, a field of Blood; or Golgotha, a place of a Scull. One man would be as a wolf to another, the wicked would devour the man that is more Righteous than he, men would be as the fishes of the Sea, &amp; as the creeping things, that have no Ruler over them, as the Prophet speaks▪ Hab. 1▪ 13. What God saith of the old world. Gen. 6▪ 13▪ <HI>The Earth is filled with violence▪</HI> would soon become true of the world now if destitute of Government.</P>
<P>Government being so great a Blessing, and consequently the variety of mens conditions in the world, and their subordination one to another, which is necessary to the very being of it; The most High God, who <HI>will not give his glory to another, nor his praise to graven Images,</HI> Isa. 42. 8. hath sufficiently taught us in his
<PB N="3" REF="002323_0005_0FDC0EE6B81DC8A0"/>
word, to whom we are beholding for it; &amp; that it hath an higher &amp; more Excellent Ori∣ginal, than only the pride, ambition, &amp; Crafty designs of some aspiring mortals, that affect a Superiority over others and can bear to be se∣cond to none in honour and power; Even his own wise and gracious providence over the world.</P>
<P>To this End we are Taught, that <HI>there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no power but of God, that the powers that be are or∣dained of God.</HI> Rom. 13. 1. That <HI>by him Kings Reign, and princes decree justice. That by him princes Rule &amp; nobles, Even all the Judges of the Earth▪</HI> Prov. 8. 15, 16. That <HI>he removeth Kings and setteth up Kings.</HI> Dan. 2. 21. And besides many other places that might be mentioned, we are Taught this Lesson in our Text and Context▪ <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that <HI>promotion cometh not from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South; but God is the Judge he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Penman and occasion of this psalm wherein our Text is, there is vari∣ety of opinions amongst Expositors, (as may be seen by Mr Pool'<HI>s</HI> Collections in his Criti∣ca Sacra, and his English Annotations▪) Some being of opinion that it was composed in the Babylonish Captivity &amp; written in form of a Dialogue, tho' there be no mention made of the persons speaking therein. Others that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="4" REF="002323_0006_0FDC0F50C2D12930"/>
was composed by Asaph in Davids time, and in his name and person, as it is not unusual for poets to bring in princes speaking in their poems. Others that it was composed by David himself, and with this opinion the Learned Ames<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ames.</HI> Lectiones in Psalmes in Loc.</NOTE> concurs.</P>
<P>The Psalm seems to Relate to the time when Saul &amp; other of Davids Enemies were overthrown, and he had Entered upon the Kingdom of Israel, altho' he had not Gotten full possession of it. And herein David in the name of other pious persons professeth his Thankfulness unto God for his wonderful providence over all things, and in special to∣wards himself v. 1. <HI>Unto thee, O God do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works do declare.</HI> And then he makes a promise agreeable to such a frame of spirit, Even that he would do the duty of a Just &amp; pious Ruler. v. 2. <HI>When I shall receive the Congregation, I will Judge uprightly.</HI> This general Promise he seems more parti∣cularly to Explain, in the following verses, in that he Promises to Endeavour to Restore the Decayed state of Things in his Kingdom v. 3. <HI>The Earth and all the Inhabitants of it are Dis∣solved: I bear up the Pillars of it, Selah.</HI> or—<HI>I will bear up</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as Tremellius &amp; Junius Ren∣der
<PB N="5" REF="002323_0007_0FDC0F544B0A6698"/>
it. And as a means to this Restitution of things in his Kingdom, that he would sup∣press the Madness &amp; Haughtiness of the wick∣ed. v. 4, 5. <HI>I said unto the fools deal not so foolish∣ly; &amp; to the wicked, lift not up the horn Lift <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.</HI> And the more Effectually to Suppress their haughtiness, he refutes &amp; condemns one great Errour of theirs, about the Exaltation or de∣pression of this or that man. Shewing that it is not to be ascribed to chance, or humane policy &amp; power, but to that wise &amp; powerful providence which God Exerciseth over the world. v. 6, 7 <HI>For promotion cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South. But God is the Judge: he putteth down one, &amp; setteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>In the verse now Read, we may Observe</P>
<P N="1">1. The person spoken of, the Most High God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Relation he stands in to his crea∣tures▪ <HI>he is the Judge.</HI> The Judge by way of Eminency. It is the work of a Judge to De∣termine matters of Right. To Distribute Rewards and Punishments. To Determine Controversies Relating to Commutative Jus∣tice. In these Respects God may be Called the Judge. He determines the Eternal state of men. Rom. 2. 16. And also he determines what their Condition in this world shall be,
<PB N="6" REF="002323_0008_0FDC0F576C1E20E0"/>
whether high or low, whether they shall be Rich or poor, the men of the world are as so many Rivals, Competitors or Candidates for Riches &amp; honours, &amp; God as Judge, doth by his all governing providence, pass Sentence, who shall have them &amp; who shall go without them. Again a Judge Sometimes in Scripture Signifies the chief Ruler in a state. So in Israel before Saul'<HI>s</HI> Reign the Chief Rulers were called Judges. Ruth. 1. 1. <HI>Now it came to pass in the dayes when the Judges Ruled.</HI> God may be Called the Judge in this sense. Be∣cause the whole world is governed by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may herein observe those works that are ascribed to God, that are agreeable to such a Relation. He putteth down one &amp; setteth up another. He disposeth of men to their Several Ranks &amp; posts, as the chief Ru∣ler of a state conferreth offices and places of trust on some, and degrades others, So the most High depresseth and Exalteth whom he pleaseth. Dan▪ 4. 17.</P>
<P>DOCT. That God is the Supreme Ruler of the world, and he placeth all persons in their Several Stations and Conditions.</P>
<P>The Doctrine may be branched into two Particulars.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>That God is the Supreme Ruler of the world.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="7" REF="002323_0009_0FDC0F59ED24F608"/>
II. <HI>That he placeth all persons in their Several Stations and Conditions.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. <HI>God is the Supreme Ruler of the world.</HI> He governs the world, &amp; not in Subordination to any Superiour power. All other beings that are in power in the universe are subject to him, but he is subject to none. <HI>That God is the Supreme Ruler of the world appears.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From that wisdom and power that is disco∣vered in the Government of the world.</HI> Infinite wisdom and Infinite power are peculiar to &amp; Inseperable from Gods works. Prov. 8. 30 Psal. 111. 7. This wisdom &amp; power appears in the government of the world. And con∣sequently God is the Ruler of it. This wis∣dom &amp; power appears <HI>in Gods common Govern∣ment:</HI> what Less than Infinite wisdom and power could make the Luminaries of heaven, by an uniform &amp; steady motion to Describe to men the times &amp; seasons, like some publick Clock or Dial. as Psal. 104. 19 <HI>He appointeth the moon for seasons; the Sun Knoweth his going down.</HI> It is beyond finite power &amp; wisdom to make the Thunder &amp; Lightning, a thing so powerful and ungovernable by man, to help Gods People &amp; punish their Enemies, &amp; yet it doth this. Psal. 18. 13, 14. Or to make the fire, hail, snow and vapour, and stormy wind to fulfil his word▪ as Psal. 148. 8. To
<PB N="8" REF="002323_0010_0FDC0F5B37E0BFA0"/>
make the Frogs, Lice, Flies, and Locusts to punish the Egyptians. The Quails to come in such vast numbers and at set times to the Camp of the Israelites to feed them; the Ra∣vens to feed Elijah, or the worms to Destroy Herod when he gave not God the Glory. It's from this Infinite Wisdom &amp; Power that the Stork in the heavens Knows he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appointed times, and the Turtle Crane and Swallow the Time of her Coming. Jer. 8. 7. That the ants prepare their meat in Summer, the Conies make their houses in the Rocks, and the Lo∣custs go forth by bands. Prov. 30. 25, 26, 27. Yea from this wisdom and power it is that wicked men are made to serve the Great Ends of Providence, to Punish one another, and to Chastise Gods People. Isai. 10. 5, 6, 7. <HI>O Assyrian the Rod of mine anger, and the Staff in their hand is mine Indignation. I will send him against an Hypocritical Nation; and against the people of my wrath will I give him a Charge to take the Spoil, &amp; to take the Prey, &amp; to tread them Down like the mire of the streets. Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so, but it is in his heart to Cut off &amp; Destroy Nations not a few.</HI> Further such a wisdom &amp; such a power appear <HI>in Special Government.</HI> The Redemption of mankind &amp; Gods great works relating to his Church belong to This, and herein a <HI>wisdom</HI> above that which is finite is
<PB N="9" REF="002323_0011_0FDC0F60A18FBC60"/>
conspicuous not only to men but Even to Angels. Eph 3. 10. <HI>To the intent that now unto the principalities &amp; powers in heavenly places might be Known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God.</HI> And such a <HI>Power</HI> is manifested by the Resurrection of Christ from the Dead, by the Preservation of Gods church in the world, &amp; by the Conversion of Sinners. Eph. 1▪ 19. And what is the Exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe according to the working of his mighty power.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That God is the Supreme Ruler of the world appears, from his foretelling future Events, &amp; his Exact &amp; Infallible accomplishment of them.</HI> God foretels things that are contingent as to Se∣cond Causes, a great while beforehand, and Exactly accomplisheth them. Thus he fore∣told to Abraham the affliction of his posterity in Egypt &amp; their Deliverance. Gen. 15. 13, 14. The Babylonish Captivity of Seventy years, &amp; their Deliverance by Cyrus who is mention∣ed by name a long while before he was born. Isa. 44. 28 &amp; 45. 1. Likewise the great power of the Grecian and Roman Monarchs before they appeared in the world. By the Prophet Daniel. And also many circumstances of the Incarnation and Sufferings of Christ, as they were afterward accomplished. Now seeing God foretels such things as they come to pass, it is Evident that he is the chief ruler
<PB N="10" REF="002323_0012_0FDC0F61F861EA08"/>
of the world, and that there is not any other being, that is Equal with, or superiour to him, to frustrate his Designs. God himself useth this argument with his people to convince them that he alone is God. Isa. 46. 9, 10. <HI>Remember the former things of old, for I am God, &amp; there is none Else, I am God &amp; there is none like me▪ Declaring the End from the Beginning, &amp; from Ancient times the things that are not yet done, Saying, My Counsel shall stand. &amp; I will do all my Pleasure.</HI> Now he that is God alone without any Superiour or Equal, must be Su∣preme Ruler of the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This is Evident, because all things are subject to Gods Government.</HI> Psal. 103. 19. <HI>The Lord hath prepared his Throne in the heavens: and his Kingdom Ruleth over all</HI> Great and Potent Creatures are Governed by him. He Ruleth the Raging of the Sea. Psal. 89▪ 9. The Winds and the Sea Obey him. Mat. 8. 27. Earthly Rulers are subject to his government. Prov. 21. 1. <HI>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord as the Rivers of water: he turneth it whi∣thersoever he will.</HI> Yea Even the angels that Excel in strength are governed by God. They do his commandments, hearken to his word, and are ministers of his that do his pleasure. Psal. 103. 20, 21. And God is said to Rule in the armies of heaven as well as among the Inhabitants of the Earth. Dan. 4. 35 Yea
<PB N="11" REF="002323_0013_0FDC0F65E67FF118"/>
Weak small &amp; minute beings are not Exempt∣ed from his Government; for Even a sparrow doth not fall to the Ground without our hea∣venly Father. Now he that hath all things under his Government must needs be the Supreme Ruler of the world.</P>
<P>II. <HI>God placeth all persons in their respective Stations &amp; Conditions;</HI> As the place of mens abode is ordered by God▪ Act. 17. 26. So is their Rank, condition and Quality, as in the verse of our Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Persons of Low degree have their condition assigned them by God.</HI> Whether men are brought Low as a punishment for Sin or for any other wise &amp; holy End, Gods providence is to be acknowleged therein Job 1. 21—The Lord Gave, &amp; the Lord hath Taken away.—Men may sometimes be said to bring them∣selves Low. Hos. 14. 1. <HI>O Israel return thou unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine Iniquities.</HI> Sin in General is a lowering, sink∣ing thing Prov. 14. 24 But some Sins are peculiarly so. Some Sins are dishonouring &amp; disgraceful. As whoredom &amp; adultery. Prov. 6 33. <HI>A wound &amp; dishonour shall he Get.</HI> Theft. Jer. 2. 26. <HI>A Thief is ashamed when he is found—Lying.</HI> Prov. 19. 22. <HI>A poor man is better than a Liar.</HI> Some Sins are Impoverishing. As Un∣cleanness. Prov. 6. 26. <HI>By means of a whorish
<PB N="12" REF="002323_0014_0FDC0F6747AE8D80"/>
woman a man is brought to a piece of bread.</HI> In∣temperance. Prov. 23. 21. The Drunkard &amp; the Glutton shall come to poverty—Injustice is also Impoverishing. Prov. 11. 24.—<HI>There is that witholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</HI> So is Idleness. Prov. 23. 21—<HI>Drow∣siness shall clothe a man with Rags.</HI> The like may be said of Keeping bad Company. Prov▪ 28. 19—<HI>He that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty Enough.</HI> But although men may by Sin Bring themselves low, yet Gods Providence is not to be Excluded, upon this account; although he is Righteous in all his ways &amp; holy in all his works; yet some things are said to be done by him which are brought about by Sinful means. Thus God is said to send Joseph into Egypt. Gen. 45. 5 And to Exalt Baasha 1 Kings. 16 2 When as both were brought about by Sinful means Hence God is said to make poor. 1 Sam 2. 7. And to pour contempt upon princes. Psal▪ 107. 40.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Persons of high Degree are Exalted by God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>He Exalteth those that are above others in wealth &amp; Riches.</HI> Tho' God hath Given the Earth to the Sons of men. Psal. 115 16 Yet all have not an Equal share in it. And this difference is not to be Imputed only to mens prudence &amp; diligence. But a higher hand is to be acknowledged in the matter Deut. 8. 17, 18. <HI>And thou say in thine heart, my power</HI> &amp;
<PB N="13" REF="002323_0015_0FDC0F68B9E57CC8"/>
<HI>the might of mine hand hath Gotten me all this wealth. But thou shalt Remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to Get wealth</HI>—Mens prudence &amp; diligence may be Instrumental to advance their Estates, and Encrease their Substance. But without Gods Blessing this will not Avail. Psal. 127. 2. <HI>It is vain for you to Rise up Early, to Sit up Late to Eat the Bread of Sorrows.</HI> Therefore Gods Blessing is said to make Rich as well as the Diligent Hand. Prov. 10. 22. And God is said to be the maker of the Rich and Poor▪ Prov. 22. 2. <HI>The Rich &amp; Poor meet together, the Lord is the maker of them all.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>God Exalteth those that are above others in Gifts and parts.</HI> As it is God that makes men in General Wiser than the fowls of hea∣ven Job. 35. 11. So it is he that distinguisheth persons of Great Gifts and Parts from others. Mens Gifts &amp; abilities are the manifestation of the Spirit, and are wrought by that one &amp; the self same Spirit that divides to Every one severally as he will. 1 Cor 12. 7, 11. God is the father of Lights &amp; from him Every good Gift &amp; Every perfect Gift comes. Jam. 1. 17. It was God that Gave to Solomon wisdom and Largeness of heart as the sand upon the Sea shore. 1 King. 4. 29.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>God Exalteth those that are above others in places of trust.</HI> Civil Rulers are advanced by
<PB N="14" REF="002323_0016_0FDC0F6E01A3F3D0"/>
him. Judg. 2. 16. The Lord raised them up Judges which delivered them. Godly Rulers are promoted by God. David Stiles him∣self the man that was raised up on high. 2 Sam. 23. 1. And acknowledges that it was God that so advanced him. Psal. 78. 70. 71. <HI>He chose David also his Servant and took him from the Sheepfolds: from following the Ews great with young, he brought him to feed Jacob his people &amp; Israel his Inheritance.</HI> Yea wicked Rulers are beholding to the most high for their Ex∣altation. 1 Sam. 15. 1. 1 King. 16. 2. Like∣wise church officers are promoted by God. So the Priests &amp; Levites were under the Law▪ Deut. 10. 8. <HI>At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.</HI> And thus also the ministers under the Gospel are advanced. They Receive their ministry of the Lord, Col. 4. 17. And are made overseers over their flocks by the holy Ghost. Act. 20. 28.</P>
<P>But I shall be thought to forget my self &amp; to abuse this honourable Audience if I Insist upon a truth so plain &amp; so generally professed amongst us▪ I proceed to make some Im∣provement of it.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="15" REF="002323_0017_0FDC0F6F7B525720"/>
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE, I. <HI>What we have heard may be of use to teach us, that a people that have good Rulers, have great cause of thankfulness to God upon that ac∣count.</HI> Tho' all Rulers are set up by God, yet they are not all alike, God sometimes gives such to a people in anger, and to be punishments to them. Hos. 13. 11. <HI>I gave them a King in mine anger and took him away in my wrath.</HI> Some Rulers want ability for their work, others are unfaithful therein. Some that stand in the place of shepherds feed themselves but not the flock Ezek 24. 8. A people sometimes have princes that are as Roring lions, and Judges that are as Evening wolves. Zeph. 3. 3. Temporal Dominion is not founded in Grace And the most high is pleased sometimes to set up the basest of men over a People Dan. 4 17 Some that are Enemies to religion are in places of power. Psal. 2. 2. <HI>The Kings of the Earth set themselves, &amp; the Rulers took counsel together▪ against the Lord and against his anointed</HI> Sometimes they are in Places of power that pervert Justice▪ Isai. 5. 23. <HI>Which Justifie the wicked for a Reward and take away the Righteousness of the Righteous from him.</HI> And such as set a sad Example be∣fore their People, as Manasseh, and Ah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b who sold himself to work Wickedness▪ 1 King. 21. 25.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002323_0018_0FDC0F71C2B13968"/>
But there are some Rulers of another Spirit▪ that are as Nursing fathers to their people. Isai▪ 49. 23 That are seeking the wealth of their people Esth. 10. 3. That are a terrour to Evil wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks. Rom. 13. 3. As an hiding place from the wind a covert from the tempest: as Rivers of water in a dry place, &amp; as the shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land. Isai▪ 32. 2 And that are Really ministers for the good of a people. Rom. 13. 3. And when this is the Case of a people, that they are favoured with such Rulers, they are highly priviledged and such a mercy should not be forgotten by them. This mercy to Israel Nehemiah takes notice of. chap. 9. 27. <HI>Thou Gavest them Savi∣ours, who Saved them out of the hands of their Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>USE, II. <HI>Hence Persons of a Lower Rank should not Envy those of a more Exalted Station.</HI> Places of honour and Eminence have their Burdens &amp; Inconveniences attending them, so that they that are set in them, are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much more happy than others, as many Imagine them to be. <HI>Its a great mistake</HI> (as a learned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Sherlock'</HI>s Discourse of the Divine Providence. Pag. 325. Edit. 4.</NOTE> writer observes) <HI>to think, that the Happiness of men differs as much as their fortunes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; that a prince is as much happier as he is greater
<PB N="17" REF="002323_0019_0FDC0F769C348908"/>
than his subjects; for all the World knows, that Happiness is not Entailed on Riches, and Power, &amp; secular honours; as they have their Advantages so they have very troublesome and sowre allays.</HI> Their happiness is not so great as it appears to be, &amp; if it were they would not Enjoy it long for tho' some by office are Gods, yet they must Dye like men Psal. 82 6. Again if their happiness were as great as it appears to be, &amp; much more lasting than it is, yet this is E∣nough to Quiet us &amp; make our minds Easy, that this difference that is made in mens Condition is ordered by the alwise God, who is Righteous in all his ways &amp; holy in all his works, &amp; accountable to none, &amp; that he or∣dereth such a variety in mens conditions for his own glory &amp; the General good of mankind; &amp; therefore Altho' we see some of our fellow mortals have more Riches, more Honour, greater Gifts and parts than our selves, we should not have our Eye Evil towards them, because God is good to them Mat. 20. 15.

USE III. <HI>We may Hence Infer that Sins in Rulers are more Heinous in the sight of God, than the same for kind &amp; degree would be, if com∣mitted by men of lower Rank.</HI> The sins of Ru∣lers Dishonour God more than the sins of o∣thers; &amp; are more Hurtful to men: &amp; Rulers discover more Ingratitude &amp; baseness of Spirit by their Sins, than persons of a lower Rank. And therefore we find that Eli's, David's Je∣roboam's &amp; Baasha's Sins are represented as the more odious because God had Exalted them 1 Sam. 2 28, 29. 2 Sam. 12 7, 8, 9. 1 King. 14 7 1 King 16. 2. And God shewed himself highly provoked by them, by that train of afflictions brought upon David him∣self. And the awful punishments brought up∣on the posterity of Jeroboam &amp; Baasha.

<P>Persons of Distinction &amp; Quality should be willing to be serviceable &amp; useful to those that are below them Your Enjoyments that you have above others, you have from God, and have not received them for your selves only. Are you accomplished above others in respect of Gifts, these are given for the good of others as well as your selves. 1 Cor 12. 7. <HI>The mani∣festation of the Spirit is given to Every man to pro∣fit withal.</HI> Are you Rich in this world God hath given you all these things Richly to en∣joy &amp; you must do good with them and be Ready to distribute them 1 Tim 6. 17, 18. <HI>Charge them that are Rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us all things richly to enjoy: that they do good, that they be rich in good work ready to distribute, willing to Communicate.</HI> Are you in place of Rule you are concerned to seek the good of your people.

to great persons, the more Serviceable they are to others, the more honourable. Jehojada was buried in the city of David with the Kings because he had done good in Israel, both towards God and towards his house. 2 Chron. 24 16. The more good they do, the more they are like to the holy Angels, who are ministring Spirits sent forth to minister to the Heirs of Salvation. Heb. 1. ult. Yea hereby they are more like to the Holy God who is good and doeth good▪ Psal. 119. 68.</P>
<P>USE. V. <HI>The truth that we have now heard Suggests that persons that are Concerned in the Choice of Rulers, should faithfully attend the directi∣ons of Gods word in that affair.</HI> The Reason is, because that in the Choice of Rulers they work with God, and for God.</P>
<P><HI>They work with God.</HI> He is the principal a∣gent or Efficient in Exalting &amp; depressing men, &amp; he honours you that have the Priviledge of chusing your own Rulers, by Implo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing you in this work of his, &amp; this should oblige you to faithfulness. Gospel ministers should be faithful in their work for this Reason among many others, because they are workers toge∣ther with God. 2 Cor 6. 1.

<P><PB N="22" REF="002323_0024_0FDC0F818D81AFF8"/>
<HI>Again they work for God,</HI> and therefore this work should not be done deceitfully.

As David faith of the house that Solomon was to build. 1 Chron. 29 1. <HI>The work is great, &amp; the palace is not for man but for God</HI> So it may be here said to you; the work that you are concerned in is great, the offi∣cers that you are to chuse are not for man only but for God.</P>
<P>Hence you may not Chuse heedlesly and at Random; or pitch upon men for Publick places only because they have been kind and obliging to you; or because they are of such a faction or party; or because they are most likely to serve your own Private Interest: the men of Shechem had an Eye to this in the Choice of Abimelech. Judg 9 2, 3. And paid dear for it. Your priviledges, Sirs, are too sacred to be prostituted to serve such base

designs as these: be governed in your choice, by a sincere aim at Gods glory, and the good of your people, which are the great Ends of Government.</P>
<P>To this End let the persons that from time to time you give in your Suffrage for be men of well-known ability and faithfulness Deut. 1 13. <HI>Take ye wise men &amp; understanding &amp; known among your tribes &amp; I will make them Rulers over you.</HI> Let them be men of wisdom and good conduct, like the men of Issachar that had un∣derstanding in the times to Know what Israel ought to do. 1 Chron. 12 32. Men zealously bent for Justice. 2 Sam. 23. 3. <HI>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, he that Ruleth over men must be Just, ruling in the fear of God.</HI> Let them be men of activity and Industry, that will apply themselves to their work and Rule with Diligence as Rom. 12 8 Men of Courage and fortitude, that will not fear the faces of men or bear the Sword of Civil Justice in vain Deut. 1. 17. and Rom 13 4 Let them be pious Godly men. Exod. 18. 21. <HI>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God.</HI> Let them be men of a Generous Publick spirit, such as know how to Deny themselves for the publick good, and to look beyond their own private Interest. We need such amongst us now, as will be faithful to the Publick weal of the people, tho' the main re∣quital

that they can Expect from some, is Ill-will and reproach, a sort of pay for publick officers that passeth too currant amongst us.</P>
<P>The promoting such persons amongst us, is the way to preserve the honour, and attain the Ends of Government, to manifest our faithfulness in Gods work &amp; love to our peo∣ple; when a people have such to Rule them, it is to be accounted no small happiness. 1 King. 10. 8. <HI>Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee, &amp; that hear thy wisdom▪</HI> And it is for a Lamen∣tation when they have not such strong Rods to Rule them.

Be∣sides we are Entred into the Labours of some who have been Eminent in Gifts &amp; Piety, &amp; Zeal for the Interest of Christ. Not to mention the famous Worthies that the Neigh∣bouring Province hath been blessed with Even in this Western Part of New England, there have shined Stars of the first magnitude, such as the Renowned Hooker, Stone, Davenport Fitch, with Others of the Like stamp, who are now shining in a better world; and what

manner of persons should we be, if we would not give men occasion to take up that sad La∣mentation concerning us, Lam. 4. 1. how is the Gold become dim, how is the fine Gold changed.</P>
<P>There is a spirit of Jealousie &amp; hatred too manifest in many of this Land against those of this order, &amp; many reproaches are cast upon them, which will be best removed &amp; Confuted by a vigorous prosecution of the great busi∣ness of our Office. Moreover the declining state of religion amongst us, requires not a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle piety &amp; painfulness in those of this or∣der. And finally our time in the world will soon be run out. Our bodies are Earthen vessels, and we shall not be suffered long to Continue by reason of Death; let us then in all things shew our selves blameless &amp; faithful as the Stewards of God, And do the work of him that sent us while it is day, because the night of Death is hastening upon us wherein we cannot work. John 9. 4.</P>
<P>Let us think seriously, how Invaluably pre∣cious the Souls of men are that we watch for, and what a doleful account we shall have to give, if they perish through our neglect, and how glorious their reward will be, who are faithful to Christ in this work to the death. Rev. 2. 10. <HI>Be thou faithful to the death and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI></P>

USE, VIII. Lastly. <HI>I would hence Exhort the whole body of this people so to Carry themselves towards Rulers as this doctrine Suggests.</HI> Particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Put honour upon them.</HI> This is their due by the fifth Commandment, &amp; we must not Deny it to them. Rom 13. 7. <HI>Render therefore to all their dues:—honour to whom honour.</HI> Honour Rulers by speaking well of them, and taking in good part their administrations. It was a good time in Israel when all that the king did pleased the people 2 Sam. 3. 36 Don't declaim against Rulers, like those Bruit Beasts (as such are called.) That are not afraid to speak Evil of dignities. Jude. 10. It would bet∣ter become some of you, to pray more for them, &amp; bless God for them, than to talk so much against them. Exod 22. 28. <HI>Thou shalt not revile the Gods, nor curse the Ruler of thy people.</HI> Be not ready to Credit Evil reports concern∣ing them▪ Some speak against them out of malice, because they have born testimony a∣gainst their Evil works. Others out of Envy, because they cannot bear to see them so great. Others that they may appear wiser &amp; more understanding in state affairs than their neighbours, who cannot see them so faulty as they represent them▪ But Let your Counte∣nances be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the northwind to these back bit∣ing tongues. It is a fault to take up a reproach
<PB N="39" REF="002323_0041_0FDC0FB0BAC2CD08"/>
against any▪ Psal. 15. 3. Much more against these. It is not for nothing that it is said. 1 Tim. 5. 19. <HI>Against an Elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Pray for Rulers.</HI> They come in the name of the Lord. Are invested with his power &amp; authority. And It becomes us to ask for them a blessing. A blessing upon their persons &amp; administrations. Psal. 118. 26. We are Ex∣presly commanded to pray for them. 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. <HI>I Exhort therefore that first of all Supplica∣tions, prayers, Intercessions &amp; giving of thanks be made for all men: for kings and for all that are in authority.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Be Ready to Recompence them for their Ser∣vice.</HI> By your choice of them you set them to a difficult, troublesome Imployment, &amp; they spend their time for your benefit. And no small advantage accrues to you thereby. We may say without flattery, concerning them, as Tertullus to Felix. Act. 24. 2 <HI>That by them we Enjoy great quietness.</HI> Moreover the Supreme Lord of the world, whose you are, &amp; all that you have, Expresly requires that you should recompence these his officers Rom 13. 6. 7. <HI>For, for this cause pay you tribute for they are Gods ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom.</HI></P>

4. Lastly▪ <HI>Be Subject to &amp; obey Rulers.</HI> Civil Rulers are to be obeyed in that which is Law∣ful, otherwise we must obey God rather than man. Act 5. 29▪ We are bound in conscience thus to obey them. Rom. 13 1. 2. <HI>Let Every soul be subject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever▪ therefore Resisteth the power, Resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. v. 5. Where∣fore ye must needs be Subject, not only for wrath but for conscience sake.</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. <HI>Submit your selves to Every ordinance of man for the Lords sake: whether it be to the king as Supreme: or unto governours, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of Evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well.</HI> I likewise Ecclesiastical Ru∣lers are thus to be submitted to. Heb. 13. 17. <HI>Obey them that have the rule over you, &amp; submit your selve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: for they much for your souls, as they that must give account: that they may do it with Joy, and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you</HI> This duty of submission to Rulers tho' very distastful &amp; unpleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to Corrupt nature, should be sweetned to you in this Government, not only from the doctrine you have now heard, that it is God that placeth men in their Respective stations; but also because your Rulers in church and state are chosen by the people. Hushai's Resolution.

2 Sam. 16. 18. is very reasonable <HI>Whom the Lord and this people &amp; all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</HI></P>
<P>This is the way for a people to be happy. That commandment which requireth obedi∣ence to rulers is the first commandment with promise. Eph. 6. 2. If a people would prosper they should hearken to their prophets▪ 2 Chron. 20. 20. If they would live long in their own Land, and Eat the fruit of it they should be an obedient people Isai 1 19. If ye be willing and obedient ye shall Eat the good of the Land.</P>
