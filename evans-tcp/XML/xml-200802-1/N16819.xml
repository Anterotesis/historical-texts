<HEAD>THE MERRY FELLOW's COMPANION.</HEAD>
<P>THE brave, but eccentric general Lee had so little regard to the rules of politeness and ci∣vility, that he always spoke his opinions unreservedly, without regarding the offence or pain they might ex∣cite. Being one night at Albany, drinking with an old Scotch officer, when he began to mellow with the wine, he told his companion that he had one fault, which he begged him to overlook, which was to abuse the Scotch when he was in liquor. In troth, replied the officer, I shall readily forgive your fault, if you will overlook mine; it is, when I hear any person impertinently abusing Scotland or Scotchmen, when I am drunk or sober, I cannot refrain from laying my cane soundly over his shoulders. Now I will readily pardon your fault, if you will pardon mine. This seasonable hint made the general very polite the remainder of the night.</P>
<P N="2">2. During the late war, there lived in New-Jersey, a remarkable dwarf. Though upwards of twenty years old. he was not more than three feet high, and every way small in proportion. This curiosity drew great crowds of people to see him, and amongst the rest, general Washington. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ero conversed some time with Tommy Thumb; asked several questions; and generally received pertinent answers. The ge∣neral
<PB N="6" REF="021643_0004_0FB4E93FCECA8790"/>
wished to know his political sentiments, and asked whether he was whig or tory? <Q>I cannot say, sir,</Q> said this man of might: <Q>I have not yet taken an <HI>active part.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">3. Soon after the Massachusetts insurgents retreated from their attack on general Shepard, at Ordnance-hill, and when it was hourly expected they would renew it, Shays sent a flag to general Shepard, re∣questing to have delivered to him the bodies of the killed, amounting to five. The officer, who had been sent by general Shepard, to receive the flag, on the request being made for five slain, with the utmost <HI>sang froid</HI> imaginable replied, <Q>Present general She∣pard's compliments to captain Shays: and inform him, that he cannot furnish him with <HI>five</HI> dead, he having no more than <HI>four:</HI> but that if captain Shays will please to attack him again, he will then furnish him with another, and as many more as he shall desire.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. Dr. Franklin, as agent for the province of Penn∣sylvania, being in England at the time the parliament passed the stamp-act for America, was frequently ap∣plied to by the ministry for his opinion respecting the operation of the same, and assured them that the people of America would never submit to it. The act was nevertheless passed, and the event shewed he had been right. After the news of the destruction of the stamped paper had arrived in England, the mi∣nistry again sent for the doctor, to consult with him, and concluded with this proposition, that if the Ame∣ricans would engage to pay for the damage done in the destruction of the stamped paper, &amp;c. the par∣liament would then repeal the act. To this the doc∣tor answered, that it put him in mind of a French∣man, who having heated a poker red hot, ran into the street, and addressing an Englishman he met there, "hah, monsieur, voulez vous givé me de plaisir et de satisfaction, and leté me runi dis poker only one foote up your backside?" "What!" says the English∣man:—
<PB N="7" REF="021643_0005_0FB4E9494F6CE210"/>
"Only to leté me runi dis poker one foote up your back side." "Damn your soul," replies the Englishman. "Welle, den, only so far," says the Frenchman, pointing to about six inches of the poker.—"No, no," replies the Englishman—"damn your soul; what do you mean?" "Well, den," says the Frenchman, will you havé de justice to payé me for de trouble and expence of heating de poker?"—"damn me, if I do," answered the Englishman, and walked off.</P>
<P N="5">5. A member of the general court of Massachu∣setts, who, from accustoming himself to take a nap after dinner, when at home, could not dispense with the custom, when attending to give laws to a mighty people, not long since occasioned much sport in the house, by the following incident. A day was as∣signed for the second reading of a lumber-act: as this interested our sleeper, he requested a friend, who sat next him, to awaken him, if the discussion of the bill should be introduced, while he was asleep This his friend promised him: but, happening to go out for a few minutes, the bill was called for; and, af∣ter a short debate, was committed. Immediately after, the bill for preventing fornication, was brought on. This occasioned some debate, during which the sleeper's friend returned. Finding the lumber-bill was dismissed, he thought he might indulge his friend in his nap. However, as ill-luck would have it, he trod upon the toe of this votary to Morpheus, who supposed it a signal for his waking: immediately rousing himself, he rubbed his eyes, and looking about, perceived a pause in the debate—on which he arose and addressed the speaker as follows: <Q>Sir, I wish to speak a few words on the bill now in ques∣tion. It affects, mr. Speaker, my constituents very much: for <HI>above half our town get their living by it.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="6">6. Some time ago, at a yearly commencement in one of the eastern states, the auditors were entertain∣ed part of the forenoon with a Hebrew oration. Be∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="021643_0006_0FB4E94A56AD6F68"/>
quite weary of the discourse, a person whispered his companion, who was a New-England sea captain, that he wished the young man, instead of facing the audience, would address himself to those that under∣stood the Hebrew.—"Do you so?" said the tar: <Q>then, <HI>by nowns,</HI> brother Jonathan, there would not be a single point of the compass that would suit him.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. At the commencement of the late revolution, when the French nation appeared inclined to take part in the contest in favour of America, sir Joseph Yorke, the ambassador from England to the United Netherlands, meeting the French ambassador at the Hague, censured his court for interfering in the dis∣pute, and taking so ungenerous a part: "You have been guilty of a dishonourable act (said he) that is unpardonable—to less than that of debauching our daughter." "I am sorry (replied the French Am∣bassador) that your excellency should put such a se∣vere construction, upon the matter: She made the first advances, and absolutely threw herself into our arms; but, rather than forfeit your friendship, if matrimony will make any atonement, we are ready to act honourably, and marry her."</P>
<P N="8">8. Not long since a person visited the city of New-York, under the style of nobility. For several months his manner of living accorded with his as∣sumed character. His lodgings, his attendants and his equipage, corresponded only with rank and opu∣lence. Fashion received from him its laws, and taste appealed to him as its genuine standard. Balls, assem∣blies, and entertainments, welcomed him as their principal ornament: while senators and ambassadors were pleased to be enrolled as his companions.—In this career of glory, he addressed a young lady, high∣ly respectable for her character and connections: but, at the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of marriage, by the fresh appearance of the ink, which he had used in forging certain deels, designed as proof of great family property, and by a dispute with a person about the price of the
<PB N="9" REF="021643_0007_0FB4E94BCD79AD30"/>
parchment or which one of them was written, he was discovered to be a miserable vagabond, whom in∣famy would have blushed to have acknowledged as her offspring.</P>
<P N="9">9. When George Whitfield first came to Charles∣ton in South Carolina, the rev. Alexander Garden was episcopal minister of that place. Not liking Whitfield's principles, he took occasion to preach a sermon against him from the following text,—"Be∣hold, those that have turned the world upside down, are come hither also."—In the afternoon of the same day, Whitfield, in his turn, retorted upon his anta∣gonist to a very crowded audience, and with all the wit and satire for which he was so remarkable, from these words of St. Paul, "Alexander the copper∣smith hath done me much evil, the Lord reward him according to his works."—Soon after, Garden, not to be outdone, took occasion to declaim with some heat, against the light and trifling tunes used in Whitfield's church, as being too theatrical and gay for holy worship, and such as had been long appro∣priated to prophane songs and airs—"Very true, doc∣tor, said Whitfield in his next lecture: but pray, sir, can you assign any good reason why the devil should always be in possession of the best tunes?"</P>
<P N="10">10. Some officers of the army who had served du∣ring the American war, walking in Hyde-Park, dressed in their regimentals, met a man deformed by a haunch on his back, when one of them jocularly clapping his hand thereon, exclaimed, "What have you got here, my friend!" To which the other, with a countenance expressive of the insult, replied, "Bunkers hill—damn your red coat."</P>
<P N="11">11. At the opening of one of the courts of law in Massachusetts, lately, a clergyman was sent for to address the Deity—a gentleman present observed, that although this was ever the laudable practice, at the supreme judicial court, <HI>these</HI> courts had never, in his memory, opened with prayer. A sailor, who heard the last remark, observed to his mess-mate, "If so,
<PB N="10" REF="021643_0008_0FB4E94DF4C25CE8"/>
Jack, I believe as how the ship is really in distress, since they pipe all hands, and now call the parson to his quarters."</P>
<P N="12">12. One Indian happened to kill another. The bro∣ther of the deceased called upon the murderer, and seeing a woman and children in his hut, asked whose they were? The murderer declared them to be his family. The other then said, though his brother's blood called for revenge, yet as the children were young, and not able to provide for their mother and themselves, he would remain, deaf to these calls for a while; and so left them. Belonging to the same tribe, they continued to live sociably together until the eldest son of the murderer killed a deer in hunt∣ing. So soon as the brother of the deceased was in∣formed of this, he again called on the murderer, and told him, that his brother's blood called so loud, that it must be obeyed, especially as his son, having killed a deer, could support the family. The murderer said he was ready to die, and thanked the other for so long a delay: on which the wife and children broke into tears. The murderer reproved them for their weakness, and particularly his son—saying to him, did you shed tears when you killed the deer? and if you saw him die with dry eyes, why do you weep for me, who am willing to suffer what the custom of our nation renders necessary? With an undaunted countenance he then called on the brother of the de∣ceased, to strike; and died without a groan!</P>
<P N="13">13. General Morgan, with eight hundred men, of whom one half were militia, completely beat, at the battle of the Cowpens, colonel Tarleton, who at∣tacked him with one thousand regular troops.—Two hundred dragoons of that colonel, were put to flight, and briskly pursued by sixty Americans, under co∣lonel Washington. Some months afterwards, Tar∣leton, being in the house of a farmer, spoke with much vanity of himself, and lightly of colonel Washington, saying "he wished much to see his face." "It is a pity then," replied a girl in the
<PB N="11" REF="021643_0009_0FB4E94EC2998ED0"/>
house, "that colonel Tarleton did not take the pains <HI>to turn his head</HI> at Cowpens."</P>
<P N="14">14. About four years before the Shawano Indians were forced to remove from the late Savannah town, they took a Muskohge warrior known by the name of old Scrany—They bastinadoed him in the usual manner, and condemned him to the fiery torture. He underwent a great deal, without shewing any concern: his countenance and behaviour were as if he suffered not the least pain, and was formed beyond the common laws of nature. He told them, with a bold voice, that he was a very noted warrior, and gained most of his martial preferment at the expence of their nation, and was desirous of shewing them in the act of dying, that he was still as much superior to them as when he headed his gallant countrymen against them. That although he had fallen into their power, in forfeiting the protection of the divine be∣ing, by some impurity or other, when carrying the holy ark of war against his devoted enemies; yet he had still so much remaining virtue, as would enable him to punish himself more exquisitely than all their despicable ignorant crowd could do, if they gave him liberty by untying him, and would hand to him one of the red hot gun barrels out of the fire. The pro∣posal, and his method of address, appeared so ex∣ceedingly bold and uncommon, that his request was granted. Then he suddenly seized one of the red hot barrels, and brandishing it from side to side, he forced his way through the armed and surprised mul∣titude, and leaped down a prodigious steep and high bank into a branch of the river, dived through it, ran over a small island, and passed another branch, amidst a shower of bullets, from the commanding ground where fort More, or New Windsor garrison, stood, and though numbers of his eager enemies were in close pursuit of him, he got to a brambly swamp, and in his naked, mangled condition, reached his own country. He proved a sharp thorn in their side af∣tewards till the day of his death.</P>

15. In the western expedition of 1758, general Forbes, who commanded it, was, by his infirmities, reduced so low as to be taken up in a litter.—The Indians, who saw him, were astonished that a war∣rior could not walk:—this so disgusted them at their commander, that they remonstrated against him. Their old friend, colonel Weiser, to appease them, made this sagacious reply: "This man is so terrible in war, that we are obliged to confine him, and let him write his orders; for if he was let loose on the world, he would deluge it with blood."</P>
<P N="16">16. A certain Dutch justice of the peace, in New-York (when an English province) having issued a sum∣mons, returnable on the Sabbath-day, the constable into whose hand it was put to be served, being a fel∣low of some humour, returns the summons agree∣ably to date; the justice expecting it to be of some other nature, perused it, and finding what it was, said in a great passion, <HI>vat de deval you brings dis do day vor?</HI> Why, replied the constable, see whe∣ther it is not returnable this day, and should I ne∣glect my duty, you would, no doubt, report to the grand jury, and in all probability have me severely fined; upon which the justice with a loud voice pro∣claimed, <HI>I adjourns dis courts till next wendsday,</HI> and calls to his son, saying, <HI>Hauns, look off de al∣manac, and see, as dat vil be on de Sunbaths day?</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. A negro servant being asked what colour he be∣lieved the devil was? Why, replied the African, the white men paint him <HI>black,</HI> we say he is <HI>white;</HI> but from his great age, and being called <HI>Old Nick,</HI> I should suppose him <HI>grey.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. A negro had so cruel a master, that he dread∣ed the very sight of him. After exercising a variety of tyrannical acts among his slaves, the tyrant at last died, and left his son heir to his estates. Some time after his death a gentleman meeting the negro, asked him how his master behaved; I suppose, says he, <HI>he is a chip of the old block.</HI> No, no, says the negro, <HI>Massa be all block himself.</HI></P>
<P N="19"><PB N="13" REF="021643_0011_0FB4E95AC545BB40"/>
19. When the British and American armies were near each other in the neighbourhood of German-Town, five Hessian soldiers, who had straggled in∣to the woods, and lost their way, were met by an Irishman, who was a private in general Washington's army: he immediately presented his piece, and de∣sired them to surrender; they supposing that he was supported by a party, did as he directed, and threw down their arms. He then marched them before him to the American lines, and brought them to head quarters, general Washington wondered at the spi∣rit and achievement of the fellow, and asked him, how he, a single man, could capture five? Why, says the Irishman, <HI>please your excellency, by Jasus I sur∣rounded them!</HI>—The General laughed heartily, gave him a sum of money, and promoted him to a halbert.</P>
<P N="20">20. Upon the flight of the British from Lexing∣ton, a major in their army received a wound in the cheek with a goose shot. General Robertson told him the Yankees must have certainly mistaken him for a <HI>goose,</HI> or they would not have used him so ill.</P>
<P N="21">21. The stage waggon that ran between Richmond and Hampton in Virginia, was driven some time since by a surly, rude fellow. A gentleman, who had ta∣ken a place in it, being engaged writing a letter, at the usual time of setting out, requested a few mi∣nutes delay, but in vain. Mr. Whip was inexora∣ble: he insisted on setting off, adding, by way of reproach, he was sure no gentleman would ask him to stay a moment. So the gentleman was obliged to leave his letter unfinished, and the driver set off at full speed. When they had run about half a mile, the waggoner's hat falling off, he stooped, to pick it up. The gentleman seized the reins, and drove away, leaving mr. Surlyboots behind, who humbly request∣ed the new waggoner to stop. This was refused with a sneer, and a remark, that <HI>no gentlemen</HI> would ask him to stay a moment. Brother Whip was then without remedy, and obliged to trudge on foot to
<PB N="14" REF="021643_0012_0FB4E95C4426B6B0"/>
Hampton, a comfortable walk of nearly twelve miles.</P>
<P N="22">22. Some time since, a person on his travels through Coventry, in the state of Connecticut, stopped at the house of the rev. Joseph Huntington, D. D. and acquainted the doctor, that he had been preaching at Susquehannah for a considerable time, but was so unfortunate as to be driven from his possessions by the Indians, who had destroyed his property. He added that he was on his way to Massachusetts, where he had some friends, and asked charity of the doctor. The latter was liberal and hospitable to the stranger, and told him as it was Saturday, and it would be im∣proper for him to travel on the Sabbath, he might re∣fresh himself at his house both days. The offer was accepted; and dr. Huntington invited his guest to assist him next day in the duties of his function; but he declined, alleging as a reason, that his clothes were not sufficiently decent to appear in the pulpit. To obviate this difficulty, the doctor offered him a suit of clothes almost new. The objection being removed, the pretended clergyman agreed to assist his brother, and, in order to prepare himself, desired to be left alone that even∣ing, to study his discourse. A fire was accordingly made in his bed-chamber, whither he repaired with his new garb, at the same time acquainting the doc∣tor that he must study till late at night, and hoped no noise he might make would disturb the repose of the family. Sunday morning came, and the <HI>preacher</HI> be∣ing sent for to breakfast, was not to be found. He had decamped in the night, <HI>a la sourdine,</HI> and car∣ried off the clothes, so well suited to his newly-as∣sumed clerical dignity, leaving behind him the fol∣lowing apposite text, written at the top of the paper, intended for his discourse, "<HI>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me, and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</HI>" John vii. 34.</P>
<P N="23">23. A madman having broke from confinement, was parading through the streets of Boston, with a
<PB N="15" REF="021643_0013_0FB4E95E1FF79800"/>
loaded musket, which he had seized, and swearing he would kill the first man that attempted to stop him. Governor Leveret advancing towards him, ac∣costed him thus, "Ho, brother soldier, have you learned your exercise?"—He answered, "Yes," "Then stand to your arms, while I give the word of command." The man seemed pleased, and stood bolt upright, with his gun shouldered. The governor then began—"Poise your firelock—rest your fire∣lock—order your firelock—ground your firelock." The man obeyed. "Face to the right about—march."—As soon as he began to step, the governor advanced, took up his gun, and beckoning to the bystanders, they instantly seized him,—and carried him to the place of confinement.</P>
<P N="24">24. An extravagant young fellow, being accused by one of his friends, of mismanaging his estate, who said I am sorry to see you carry yourself so; for I see, you have all the properties of a prodigal: Nay, says the other, pr'ythee don't say so, for I never yet fed with swine: true, said he, but the reason was, because <HI>nobody would trust you with their swine.</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. A taylor having <HI>pressed</HI> a certain gentleman in his neighbourhood for the payment of a very long bill, day after day to no purpose, told him plainly at last, that he would <HI>take a new measure,</HI> and work him to Westminister-hall. The gentleman was a man of too much honour to discharge debts of justice, and therefore mr. Buckram <HI>cut out a suit for him</HI> in the court, though he is determined not <HI>to make it up</HI> till his debt is discharged.</P>
<P N="26">26. A traveller, relating some of his adventures, told the company, that he and his servant made fifty wild <HI>Arabians</HI> run; which startling them, he observ∣ed, that there was no such great matter in it; for, says he, we ran, and they ran after us.</P>
<P N="27">27. One, who was reading a chapter in the bible, came to these words, 'and he was clothed with wick∣edness as with a garment.' He said he thought it
<PB N="16" REF="021643_0014_0FB4E961FB6667D8"/>
was very oddly express'd, for how could a man be <HI>clothed</HI> with wickedness? to which another replied, <Q>I suppose he had a <HI>bad habit</HI> of whoring and drink∣ing.</Q></P>
<P N="28">28. Two persons in company laid a wager which of them could reach the highest; a third, who was remarkable for tricking and taking in the unwary in the way of business, got up and proposed a bet of two bottles to one, that he could reach higher than any of them. One of them replied, with a sneer, <Q>Yes, sir, we all know perfectly well that you can <HI>over-reach</HI> any of us.</Q></P>
<P N="29">29. A methodist was giving a neighbour of his a lecture against swearing; assuring him that if he dis∣regarded his admonition, and persisted in that wick∣ed practice, he would certainly go to hell when he died. <HI>If I do I'll be damn'd,</HI> replied the other.</P>
<P N="30">30. A person was lamenting that he was frequent∣ly afflicted with a violent bleeding at the nose; one present said, <Q>The best thing you can do will be to <HI>lose a little blood.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="31">31. A man called out of a three pair of stairs win∣dow, to a friend of his whom he saw in the street, and desired him to come up stairs; the other excused himself, and said he could not possibly spare time. <Q>What, said the other, because I have had mis∣fortunes, and am <HI>low in the world,</HI> you are <HI>above coming up</HI> to see me. When I was in affluence, and lived upon a ground floor, you condescended to visit me; but now my indigent circumstances oblige me to live <HI>up in a garret,</HI> you <HI>look down up∣on me.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="32">32. A young gentleman having spent all his mo∣ney, made a visit to a certain bookseller, with a poem, which he had composed, <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and</HI> The bibliopolist, knowing the value of money bet∣ter than the poet did, offered him a small sum, but a sum not at all inadequate to the intrinsic merit of the piece presented to him. The poet pocketed the
<PB N="17" REF="021643_0015_0FB4E9674E81AF20"/>
<HI>five shillings,</HI> but being determined to keep up the dignity of the <HI>gentleman</HI> at the same time, said, <Q>This is a trifle, sir, but I write merely for my amusement—were I to <HI>live</HI> by writing, I find I should <HI>starve.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="33">33. A citizen's wife, who was apt to tipple a lit∣tle sometimes, was one summer evening walking out with her husband to take an airing. They had not gone far, before the sky appeared very cloudy, and a shower was expected. <Q>It rains, my dear,</Q> said the wife. <Q>Not yet, my dear,</Q> replied the husband; <Q>but I fancy it will not be long first.</Q> <Q>Indeed my Johnny,</Q> the wife replied, <Q>it rains now, for I have just this minute held up my face, and a drop fell <HI>in my eye.</HI></Q> <Q>You may imagine so,</Q> said the husband, <Q>but, give me leave to tell you, that <HI>you had a drop in your eye</HI> before you came from home.</Q></P>
<P N="34">34. A person who took a bad guinea, went to an assayer to know the real value of it: After it was assayed, it appeared to be worth thirty shillings; whereupon the assayer said, <HI>it was a very good bad guinea.</HI></P>
<P N="53">53. The epithets and figures, that some people make use of in telling a story, are truly ridiculous and laughable. A person once related what had happened to him in the following words: <Q>I was crossing a large field, and when I came pretty near the middle, a bull followed me, and <HI>roared like thunder; I flew like lightning</HI> to keep out of his clutches; and being in such a tedious hurry in get∣ing over the stile, <HI>I tore my breeches, as if heaven and earth were coming together.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="36">36. The same person speaking of an acquaintance of his, said, he was a <HI>prodigious little</HI> man, could walk a <HI>mortal great pace,</HI> that he had a <HI>brave appetite,</HI> and he believed he would live a <HI>deadly long time.</HI></P>
<P N="37">37. A person, speaking of another, said, he was a <HI>bloody good natured</HI> fellow, that he was <HI>damnation ho∣nest,
<PB N="18" REF="021643_0016_0FB4E9695AD74AC8"/>
a hellish good</HI> husband, and <HI>devilish charitable</HI> to the poor.</P>

<P N="80">80. A venerable clergyman in a neighbouring state, grieved to see the doctrine of universal salva∣tion prevailing in his parish, was desirous of prevent∣ing its progress by convincing Mr. M—, the preacher of the doctrine, that his system was un∣scriptural, and dangerous to society. For this pur∣pose he requested the company of Mr. M.—one evening, and being too old to manage the argument with dexterity himself, he desired a young clergy∣man
<PB N="26" REF="021643_0024_0FB4E97FC9EA3928"/>
of his acquaintance to attend and assist him. The aged gentleman opened the conversation of the evening by informing his younger brother in the mi∣nistry, that he had requested the company of Mr. M—, and himself, in order to have the doctrine of universal salvation fairly discussed, in his presence, for he thought Mr. M—, might be convinced of his error; but he was too old to manage the debate—he therefore desired the young clergyman to enter upon the argument with Mr. M—"Why, sir," replied the gentleman, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> usual address, "Je∣sus Christ says, he that believeth, shall be saved, and he that believeth not, shall be damned; the dispute, therefore, is wholly between Jesus Christ and Mr. M—, and I wish to be excused from an interfer∣ence."</P>

<P N="84">84. "It is a very dark night," says Cato to one of his brethren of colour, as they were both stagger∣ing home from a frolic, on a thanksgiving eve—staggering, did I say—they were not drunk, not
<PB N="27" REF="021643_0025_0FB4E98619B7B5B0"/>
were they sober—they were at that happy medium, when the bondsman feels himself as happy as the monarch.</P>
<P>"It is a very dark night, Caesar, take care," says Cato. The caution was a good one—but, like ma∣ny others, was given too late—For Caesar, striking his foot against the small remains of a post, which time had long been hacking to pieces, measured his length upon the ground, before the friendly caution of Cato had met his car. "I wonder," says Caesar, rising, and rubbing the mud, &amp;c. from off his holi∣day suit, "<HI>why de dibil de sun no shine in deese dark nights, Cato, and not always keep shining in de day time, when dere's no need of him.</HI>"</P>

When they arrived, HENDRICK, king of the Mohawk nation, was present, and particularly admired them. In a few succeeding days, Hendrick called on Sir William, and acquainted him that he had had a dream. On Sir William's enquiring what it was, he told him that he had dreamed that he had given him one of those fine suits he had lately re∣ceived. Sir William took the hint, and immediate∣ly presented him with one of the richest suits. The Indian chief, highly pleased with the generosity of Sir William, retired. Some time after this, Sir William, happening to be in company with Hen∣drick, told him, that he had also had a dream. Hendrick being very solicitous to know what it was, Sir William informed him, that he had dreamed that he (Hendrick) had made him a present of a particular tract of land (the most valuable on the Mohawk river) of about 5000 acres. Hendrick presented him with the land immediately, but not without making this shrewd remark: "Now, Sir William, I will never dream with you again, you dream too hard for me."</P>

He was desired to give an account of all he knew. "My lord," says he, "as I was coming by the corner of the street, I <HI>stagged</HI> the man." "Pray," said lord Mansfield, "What is <HI>stagging</HI> the man." "<HI>Stagging,</HI> my lord; why you see, I was <HI>down upon him.</HI>" "Well, but I don't understand <HI>down upon him</HI> any more than <HI>stagging</HI>—do speak to be understood." "Why, an't please your lordship, I speak as well as I can—I was up, you see, <HI>to all he knew.</HI>" "To all he knew!—I am as much in the dark as ever." "Well then, my lord, I'll tell you how it was." "Do so." "Why, my lord, seeing as how he was a <HI>rum kid,</HI> I was <HI>one upon his</HI> tibby." The fellow was at length sent out of court, and was heard in the hall to say to one of his companions, that he had gloriously <HI>queered</HI> old Full Bottom.</P>

<P N="91">91. A traveller coming into the kitchen of an inn, in a very cold night, stood so close to the fire that he burnt his boots.

and asked if he never read at home? No, re∣plied the clown, I can't read. I dare say, said the parson, you don't know who made you? Not I, in troth, cry'd the countryman. A little boy com∣ing by at the same time, "who made you, child?" said the parson. "God, sir," answered the boy. "Why look you there," quoth the honest clergy∣man, "are not you ashamed to hear a child of five or six years old tell me who made him, when you, that are so old a man, cannot?" "<HI>Ah,</HI>" said the countryman, "<HI>it is no wonder that he should remember; he was made but t'other day; it is a great while, meas∣ter, sin I was made.</HI>"</P>
<P N="94">94. A certain Italian having written a book upon the <HI>art of making gold,</HI> dedicated it to pope Leo X. in hopes of a good reward.

<P N="95">95. Two city ladies meeting on a visit, one a grocer's wife, and the other a cheesemonger's (who perhaps stood upon their punctilio of precedence more than some of their betters would have done) when they had risen and taken their leave, the cheesemonger's wife was going out of the room first, upon which the grocer's lady pulling her back by the tail of her gown, and stepping before her, <HI>No madam,</HI> said she, <HI>nothing comes after cheese.</HI></P>
<P N="96">96. A handsome young woman, who was a wit∣ness in a trial of crim. con. before lord Mansfield, was interrogated by counsellor Dunning, who, thinking to confuse the woman, made her take off her bonnet, that he might have a view of her countenance, and see (for all counsellers are complete judges of phy∣siognomy) whether the truth came from her lips. After he had put many ridiculous questions to her, he asked her whether her mistress had ever communi∣cated the important secret to her? 'No, sir,' said the woman, 'she never did.' And how can you swear
<PB N="31" REF="021643_0029_0FB4E990D3BB5C70"/>
to her infidelity? 'Because I saw another gentleman besides my master in bed with her.' Indeed! said the counsellor. 'Yes, indeed, sir.' 'And pray, my good woman,' said the modest counsellor, thinking to silence her at once; 'did your master, (for I see you are very handsome) in return for his wife's infide∣lity, go to bed to <HI>you? 'That trial'</HI> (says the spirited woman) '<HI>does not come on to-day, mr. Slabberchops.</HI>'—Lord Mansfield was tickled to the soul; he thrust his hand into the waist band of his breeches, (his cus∣tom when highly delighted) and asked Dunning if he had any more interrogatories to put?

<P N="99">99. Dean Swift, hearing two of his servants dis∣puting which of them was to carry his boots, to a place where he was to take horse, called them in, and asked them what they were quarreling about? Both answered, 'Nothing.' 'Very well,' said the dean, 'then go and fetch me my boots.' The boots being brought accordingly, he gave to each of them one, saying, 'Do you take this boot, and do you take that; and do you go on this side the way, and do you go on t'other; and wait for me where the horse is.—I knew you were quarreling about nothing.'</P>

wonderful things that he had seen abroad, that a friend of his took notice to him of his exposing him∣self as he did to all companies, and ask'd him the meaning of it? "Why," says the traveller, "I have got such a habit of lying, since I have been abroad, that I really hardly know when I lie, and when I speak truth; and should be very much oblig'd to you, if you would tread upon my toe at any time, when I am likely to give myself too much liberty that way," His friend promis'd that he would; and accordingly not long after, being at a tavern with him and other company, when the traveller was, amongst other strange things, giving an account of a church he had seen in Italy, that was above two miles long, he trod on his toe, just as one of the company had ask'd, How broad that same church might be? Oh, said he, not above two feet. Upon which, the company bursting into a loud laugh: "<HI>Zounds,</HI>" said he, "<HI>if you had not trod upon my toe, I should have made it as</HI> broad <HI>as it was</HI> long."</P>
<P N="101">101. Dr Sheridan, the celebrated friend of Swift, had a custom of ringing his scholars to prayers in his school-room, at a certain hour every day. The boys were one day very devoutly at prayers, except one, who was stifling a laugh as well as he could, which arose from seeing a rat descending from the bell-rope into the room. The poor boy could hold out no longer, but burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, which set the others a-going when he pointed to the cause. Sheridan was so provoked, that he declared he would whip them all if the principal culprit was not pointed out to him; which was immediately done. The poor pupil of Momus was immediately hoisted, and his posteriors laid bare to the rod, when the witty schoolmaster told him, if he said any thing to∣lerable on the occasion, as he looked on him as the greatest dunce in his school, he would forgive him. The trembling culprit, with very little hesitation, addressed his master with the following beautiful distich:
<PB N="33" REF="021643_0031_0FB4E993F68A2880"/>
<Q><L>There was a rat—for want of stairs,</L>
<L>Came down a rope—to go to pray'rs.</L></Q>
Sheridan instantly dropped the rod, and instead of a whipping, gave him half a crown.</P>

<P N="103">103. No man had a greater aversion to excess or ridiculous compliments than dean Swift; an instance of which we shall here relate. A lady had given him an invitation to dinner, and as she had heard he was not easily pleased, had taken a month to provide for it. When the time came, every delicacy which could be purchased, the lady had prepared, even to profusion, (which Swift hated.) However, he was scarcely seated, when she began to make a ceremonious harangue; in which she told him, she was sincerely sor∣ry she had not a more tolerable dinner, since she was apprehensive there was not any thing there fit for him to eat; in short, that it was a bad dinner.—"Pox take you" (said the dean) "why did you not get a better? Sure you had time enough! but since you say it's so bad, I'll go home, and eat a herring." Accordingly he departed, and left her justly con∣fused at her folly, which had spoiled all the pains and expence she had been at.</P>

With that, the master of the house sending the tapster to know the occasion of the noise, he told him, 'twas nothing, but that <HI>Yea and Nay had kick'd G—d damme down stairs.</HI></P>

At last, he espying some, said aloud in Latin, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cuniculi multi!</HI> and with that the rabbits ran into their burrows: wherewith his fellows were offended, and chiding him for it, he said, Who the devil would have thought <HI>that rabbits understood Latin?</HI></P>
<P N="167">167. Dr. Linegar, titular archbishop of Dublin, about thirty years since, was a man of lively parts, and very communicative: he happened in a large mixed company to be introduced to mr. Swan, a gentleman of a cynical turn, whose practice it was to attempt to raise a laugh at the expence of some one in the company; they sat near each other at table, where the doctor engaged attention by his sprightly manner; mr. Swan, to silence him, ad∣dressed him, mr.—I forget your name. Line∣gar, sir, replied the doctor. I ask your pardon; I have the misfortune scarce ever to recollect names; you'll not be offended, if, in the course of conversa∣tion, I should name you doctor <HI>Vinegar;</HI> O, not at all, sir, replied the doctor; I have the same defect, and it is probable, though I now name you Swan, I may by-and-by think you a <HI>goose.</HI> The laugh was
<PB N="45" REF="021643_0043_0FB4E9B1C38185A0"/>
effectually turned against the cynic, who never at∣tempted a second sarcasm that evening, and went away as soon as he decently could.</P>
<P N="168">168. Two fellows meeting, one asked the other, why he looked so sad? I have very good reason for it, answered the other, poor Jack Such-a-one, the greatest croney and best friend I had in the world, was hanged but two days ago. What had he done? said the first. Alas, replied the other, he did no more than you or I should have done on the like oc∣casion; he found a bridle in the road, and took it up. What, answered the other, hang a man for finding a bridle? that is hard indeed. To tell the truth of the matter, said the other, <HI>there was a horse at the other end of it.</HI></P>
<P N="169">169. A dyer, in a court of justice, being ordered to hold up his hand, that was all black: <HI>take off your glove, friend,</HI> said the judge to him, <HI>put on your spec∣tacles, your honour,</HI> answered the dyer.</P>
<P N="170">170. An arch boy having taken notice of his schoolmaster's often reading a chapter in the Corin∣thians, wherein is this sentence, We shall all be changed in the twinkling of an eye; privately era∣sed the letter <HI>c,</HI> in the word <HI>changed.</HI> The next time, his master read it, We shall all be <HI>hanged</HI> in the twinkling of an eye.</P>
<P N="171">171. Some gentlemen being at a tavern together, for want of better diversion, one proposed play, but, said another in the company, I have fourteen good reasons against gaming. What are those? said another. In the first place, answered he, <HI>I have no money:</HI> Oh! said the first, if you had four hundred reasons, you need not name another.</P>
<P N="172">172. A man going one day along the street, an impudent fellow came swaggering up to him, and thrust between him and the wall. I don't use to give the wall, said he, <HI>to every jackanapes. But I do,</HI> said the other, and so made way for him.</P>

173. A late archbishop had promised one of his chaplains, who was a favourite, the first good living in his gift, that he should like, and think worthy his acceptance. Soon after, hearing of the death of an old rector, whose parsonage was worth about two hundred pounds a year, he sent his chaplain to the place too see how he liked it; the doctor, when he came back again, thanked his grace for the offer he had made him; but said, he had met with such an account of the country, and the neigh∣bourhood, as was not at all agreeable to him; and therefore should be glad, if his grace pleased, to wait till something else fell. Another vacancy not long after happening, the archbishop sent him to view that; but he returned as before, not satisfied with it, which did not much please his grace. A third living, much better than either of the others, becoming vacant, as he was told, the chaplain was again sent to take a view of that; and when he came back, Well, now, said the archbishop, how do you like this living? What objection can you have to this? I like the country very well, answered he, and the house, the income, and the neighbour∣hood, but,—<HI>But!</HI> replied the archbishop, what <HI>but</HI> can there be then? <HI>But,</HI> said he, the old incum∣bent is not dead. I found him smoking his pipe at the door of his house.</P>
<P N="174">174. An old lady being at table, and mumbling a piece of brawn, that was very horney, for a long time, at length, by its elasticity, it jumped out of her mouth, upon the plate of a young gentleman, who sat upon the opposite side of the table; but he, not seeing from whence it came, quickly eat it up. Good lord, said the old lady, what a fine thing it is to be young, and have one's teeth! I have been mumbling and tumbling that piece of brawn in my mouth this half hour to no purpose, and that young gentleman has chewed and swallowed it in a mo∣ment.</P>

175. A very great boaster and bully having been once kicked by a gentleman for his impertinence, turning round, ventured to ask his chastiser, whe∣ther he was in earnest? Yes, in very good earnest, replied the gentleman, half drawing his sword. The other, not having courage to answer him in that way, contented himself with saying, <Q>I am glad I know your mind; for I'll be d—if I like such jests.</Q></P>
<P N="176">176. A gentleman, happening to have high words with a butcher, was at last so provoked that he raised his cane, and threatened to <HI>give</HI> him a good dressing. No, master, says his antagonist, it shall only be <HI>lent; and I will take care it shall be re∣paid with interest.</HI></P>
<P N="177">177. A prisoner in the fleet lately sent to his cre∣ditor, to let him know that he had a proposal to make, which he believed would be for their mutual benefit. Accordingly, the creditor calling on him to hear it: "I have been thinking, said he, that it is a very idle thing for me to lie here, and put you to the expence of seven groats a week. My being so chargeable to you has given me great uneasiness; for God knows what it may cost you in the end. Therefore, what I would propose is this; you shall let me out of prison, and, instead of seven groats, you shall allow me only eighteen pence a week, and the other ten pence shall go towards the dis∣charge of the debt.</P>
<P N="178">178. "How many cuckolds, without including thee, said a citizen's wife to her husband, dost thou reckon in our street?" How do you mean, replied he, angrily, without including me?—"Well, dear, re∣plied the wife, if that does not please thee, how many dost thou think there are, including thee?"</P>
<P N="179">179. As the late mr. Rich, whose abilities as a harlequin are universally known, was one evening returning home from the play-house in a hackney coach, he ordered the coachman to drive him to the Sun, then a famous tavern in Clare-market. Just as
<PB N="48" REF="021643_0046_0FB4E9BC83C491B0"/>
the coach passed one of the windows of the tavern, Rich, who perceived it to be open, dexterously threw himself out of the coach window into the room. The coachman, who saw nothing of this transaction, drew up, descended from his box, opened the coach door, and let down the step; then, taking off his hat, he waited for some time, expect∣ing his fare to alight; but, at length, looking into the coach, and seeing it empty, he bestowed a few hearty curses on the rascal who had bilked him, re∣mounted his box, turned about, and was returning to the stand; when Rich, who had watched his op∣portunity, threw himself into the coach, looked out, asked the fellow where the devil he was driving, and desired him to turn about. The coachman almost petrified with fear, instantly obeyed, and once more drew up to the door of the tavern. Rich now got out; and, after reproaching the fellow with stupidi∣ty, tendered him his money.—<Q>No, God bless your honour, said the coachman, my master has ordered me to take no money to night</Q>—Pshaw! said Rich, your master's a fool; here's a shilling for yourself! "No, no," said the coachman, who by that time had remounted his box, <Q>that will not do; I know you too well, for all your shoes—and so, mr. Devil, I think your are outwitted.</Q></P>
<P N="180">180. As a press-gang, during the late war, were patroling round Smithfield, they laid hold of a man tolerably well dressed: who pleaded that, being a gentleman, he was not liable to be impressed. "Haul him away, says one of the tars, he is the very man we want; we press a damn'd number of black guards, and are cursedly at a loss for a gentleman to teach them good manners."</P>
<P N="181">181. A short time previous to the late war, a ma∣gistrate, who had served the office of lord mayor, read in the papers that the French had taken <HI>um∣brage;</HI> upon which he ran to his stock broker to or∣der him to sell out—The French have commenced hostilities, said the magistrate, <HI>they have taken Um∣brage
<PB N="49" REF="021643_0047_0FB4E9C0C748F998"/>
from us.</HI> The stock-broker applied to his ga∣zetteer—No such place was to be found. He flew to 'Change-alley, and there, after some difficulty, the point was cleared up.</P>
<P N="182">182. Macklin and doctor Johnson, disputing on a literary subject, Johnson quoted Greek. I do not understand Greek, said Macklin.—A man who ar∣gues, should understand every language, replied Johnson—Very well, answered Macklin, and gave him a quotation in <HI>Irish.</HI></P>
<P N="183">183. An eminent tradesman at the west end of London, remarkable for the blunt sincerity of his dealing, had delivered a bill for a debt of 20l. to a noble lord, not remarkable for the promptitude of his payment; the debt had been due for a dozen years, and the tradesman had called so often in vain that he was exasperated. But one morning, by the blunder of a new servant, he was admitted to his lordship's presence. He was a man of a large and extensive trade, and having realized a fortune of 30,000l. did not pay much reverence to a lord, when that lord was long-winded in his payment. He therefore insisted, in very positive terms, on his mo∣ney, and hinted something about the hardship of that law which gave protection to insolvent peers.—Fortunately, he enraged his <HI>noble</HI> debtor so much, as to urge him to take the uncommon resolution of paying the bill that instant. He accordingly pulled out his purse, and having thrown the money on the table, he declared that he never in his life saw so in∣solent a fellow, and he swore that he would punish him for his rudeness, by prevailing on every friend of his to discharge him from their employment. Old Vinegar taking up, and pocketing the money with all the composure in the world, said in answer to this, As to you, my lord, <HI>I'll take care you shall ne∣ver employ me</HI>—and if you will give me a list of your friends, <HI>I'll give you my word they shan't nei∣ther.</HI></P>

184. A certain preacher having changed his reli∣gion for a good benefice, was much blamed by some of his friends for deserting them. To excuse him∣self, he assured them he should not have done it, but for seven reasons. Being asked what they were? he answered, "a wife and six children."</P>
<P N="185">185. A merry fellow went to the celebrated dr. Graham, and finding him within, begged to speak with him in the most private manner; the doctor ac∣cordingly took him into a room, secluded almost from light, and then begged him to explain his case; the fellow urged on the doctor the utmost secrecy, saying if it should come by any means to his friends' ears, he should be ruined, &amp;c. The doctor assured him of his taciturnity. Well, says the fellow, I believe, doctor, you are the only man that can cure me; the doctor replied, he had no doubt but, let his case be ever so desperate, he could effect a perfect cure. The fellow then begged to describe his disorder, which he did in the following manner: I have been a sad raking dog, and so—Oh, says the doctor, I understand you; I have made that disorder my con∣stant study, and can remove it in the most obstinate cases.—Well, goes on the fellow, as I was coming up Fleet-street—You picked up a lady, I suppose, says the doctor—No, says the fellow, but seeing one of your men giving bills away, I took one, and having occasion a little after to evacuate, I used one of your bills, which proved so small that I befouled my fingers, therefore all I beg is, that you would print them on larger paper, to prevent like acci∣dents in future."</P>
<P N="186">186. A wit being once very low in pocket, and meeting with a lord who was walking in the court, thought to wheedle him out of a broad piece, and coming up to him, said, my lord, I had a strange dream last night, and now half of it is out; for I dreamed that I met you here, and that you gave me a broad piece. Well, says his lordship, then I will make out the other part, and so gave it
<PB N="51" REF="021643_0049_0FB4E9C3D681DF10"/>
him. But stay, now I think on it, give me that again, for it is a piece my mistress gave me to keep for herself. Scroggin readily returned it, in hopes of a better gratuity. Now, said my lord, I'll tell you my dream, that it may be out likewise. I dreamt that I gave a fool money, and he had not the wit to keep it; and so passed on, leaving Scroggin to scratch his ears, and fretting to be so outwitted.</P>
<P N="187">187. When Swift was a young man, and by no means known in the literary world, he happened to be standing in a careless manner, with his back to the fire, at a coffee-house; a gentleman just oppo∣site to him, who was superscribing a letter, seeing a raw-boned aukward fellow rather engross the fire, calls out, <Q>Pray young man have you got any sand about you?</Q> <Q>No, friend,</Q> says Swift, <Q>but I have got some gravel, and if you will give me your letter, I will piss upon it directly.</Q></P>
<P N="188">188. Two musical pretenders, having a wager a∣bout which of them sung the best, they agreed to refer it to a master of music, who undertook to be arbitra∣tor on this occasion.—A day was accordingly fixed on, and both the parties executed to the best of their abilities before him. As soon as they had finished, the judge proceeded to decide in the following man∣ner: As for you, sir, addressing himself to the first, you are by much the <HI>worst</HI> singer I ever heard in my life. Ah said the other, exulting, I knew I should win my wager. Stop, sir, says the judge, I have a word to say to you before you go, which is this, <HI>that as for you, sir, you cannot sing at all.</HI></P>
<P N="189">189. During lord Townshend's residence in Dub∣lin, as viceroy, he often went in disguise through the city. He had heard much of the wit of a shoe∣black, known by the name of blind Peter, and having found him out, he stopped to get his boots cleaned, which was no sooner done, than his lordship asked Peter to give him change for half a guinea. Half a guinea! your honour, said the ragged wit, change
<PB N="52" REF="021643_0050_0FB4E9CA877410D8"/>
for half a guinea from me!—by G—sir, <HI>you may as well ask a Highlander for a knee-buckle</HI>—His lord∣ship was so well pleased, that he left him the bit of gold, and walked off.</P>
<P N="190">190. A poor fellow having lent one of his com∣rades a small matter, spoke to him about it one night. By G—Tom, those two guineas I lent you, ought to be paid me; you know I am in great dis∣tress. Do not talk to me about it, said the other, by heavens, within this week, I will take care to pay you <HI>in some shape or other.</HI> You will oblige me, replied the creditor, <HI>and pray let it be as much in the shape of two guineas as possible.</HI></P>
<P N="191">191. An extravagant young fellow, who was ve∣ry forward in spending his money, though he could but ill afford it, being one evening in company in a public house where it was proposed to spend six∣pence a piece; the young spendthrift, not contented with this reasonable expence, insisted that it should be a shilling; saying, he knew no <HI>difference between a shilling and six pence.</HI> To which a sly old economist replied, <HI>but you will, young gentleman, when you come to be worth eighteen-pence.</HI></P>
<P N="192">192. Pope, who, whatever his other good quali∣ties might be, certainly was not much troubled with good nature, was one evening at a coffee-house, where he and a set of <HI>literati</HI> had got poring over a <HI>manuscript</HI> of the Greek comic poet <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> in which they found a passage they could not com∣prehend. As they talked pretty loud, a young offi∣cer, who stood by the fire, heard their conference, and begged that he might be permitted to look at the passage.—"Oh!" (says Pope, sarcastically) <Q>by all means, pray let the young gentleman look at it:</Q> upon which the officer took up the book, and considering a while, said, <Q>that there only wanted a note of interrogation</Q> to make the whole intelligible: which was really the case. And pray master, says Pope (piqued perhaps, at being out-done by a red coat) <Q>what is a note of inter∣rogation?</Q>—
<PB N="53" REF="021643_0051_0FB4E9CE9F79ADA0"/>
<Q>A note of interrogation, (replied the youth, with a look of the utmost contempt) is a little crooked thing that asks questions!</Q> 'Tis said, however, that Pope was so delighted with the wit, that he forgave the sarcasm on his person.</P>

<P N="195">195. A celebrated chief justice being on the mid∣land circuit, a mr. Shirley, of the county of Lei∣cester, was brought before him, charged with hav∣ing committed a rape on one of his tenant's daugh∣ters; the judge was remarkable for possessing an uncommon share of delicacy, and therefore, on the day preceding that of the intended trial, ordered the crier of the court to give notice that it would come on the next morning at seven o'clock; thereby trusting that the female sex would absent themselves on such an occasion. Instead of which the ladies came pouring in numbers into the court by six o'clock: at length the judge having heard all that the witnesses had to say in support of the charge, de∣sired the prisoner would enter upon his defence. Mr. Shirley therefore informed the court, that as he was one evening walking over his ground, he espied his prosecutrix carry away a bundle of faggots from a pile that belonged to him, and observing that she was a handsome girl, he jocosely told her, if ever he caught her repeating the transgression, he would as∣suredly repay himself in <HI>a way most agreeable to his wishes.</HI> Business calling him the next day to town, he was absent about a fortnight; and on his return home, one of his servants desired to know whether he had given permission to a young woman to carry
<PB N="54" REF="021643_0052_0FB4E9CFD5A28F18"/>
away faggots from such a pile, for that she had done it every evening since his departure; it immediately occurred to him that it must be the girl he had seen before; and about the same hour, he repaired to the old spot, where he had not waited long before she made her appearance: to be brief, he jocularly desired the girl to make <HI>personal restitution,</HI> which, without hesitation or reluctance, she complied with. Mr. Shirley, in short, was honourably acquitted; but before he departed the court, the judge desired to give him one piece of advice; "if," says his lord∣ship, <Q>you should ever find a woman stealing your faggots again, do not threaten her with such a pu∣nishment, for if you do, believe me that the la∣dies in the gallery will not leave you a stick in your hedge.</Q></P>
<P N="196">196. The late duke of Ancaster passing over Tower-Hill on a very wet day, stopped for the purpose of getting his boots cleaned; when the operation was over, on searching his pockets, he found he had not less than half a guinea, which the boy said he could get changed in an instant, if his honour would be so kind in the mean time to take care of his stool and blacking instruments. His grace being there∣fore deputed to this important charge, the boy went in quest of the change; his intention was to return, but meeting a companion less honest than himself, and telling him his errand, the other advis∣ed him to make off. Ay, but, says the first, what shall I do for my brushes and tools? Oh, never mind that; leave the business to me, and you may depend upon having them at our rendezvous in less than ten minutes. The fellow accordingly walked up with an impudent air to the spot where the duke was guarding the tools, and began to pack them up in a violent burry; what are you about, you rascal? said his grace; those things are not your's; yes, but they are, says the fellow; the rascal that cleaned your boots, and left you as centinel, was a debtor of

A company of gossips, at a good woman's labour, when the business was over, began to dis∣course about the walking of spirits, which some af∣firmed to have seen, while others doubted of their appearance. But at last the midwife, whose judg∣ment bore a great sway, delivered her judgment thus: For my part, I have gone up and down all hours in the night, and yet, heaven be praised, I never saw any thing <HI>worse than myself;</HI> though on my conscience, <HI>I believe I saw the devil once.</HI></P>
<P N="199">199. An impudent fellow dined so often at a gen∣tleman's house, that he grew quite weary of him: and seeing him there one day, desired dinner to be put back. The fellow after waiting some time, en∣quired when dinner would come up? "Truly, sir," says the servant, <Q>not till you are gone, so it is but a folly for you to stay.</Q></P>
<P N="200">200. A gentleman having bespoke a supper at an inn, desired the landlord to sup with him. The host came up, and thinking to pay a greater compliment than usual to his guest, pretended to find fault with the table cloth, and took the knives and forks, and threw them down stairs. The gentleman, resolving not to baulk his humour, threw the bottles and glasses down also; at which the host being surprised, enquired the reason. "Nothing," replied the gentle∣man, <Q>but that I thought you had a mind to sup below.</Q></P>
<P N="201">201. A notorious thief being to be tried for his life, confessed the robbery he was charged with. The judge hereupon directed the jury to find him guilty, upon his own confession. The jury having laid their heads together, brought him in not guilty.

The judge bid them consider of it again; but still they brought in their verdict, not guilty. The judge asked them the reason? the foreman replied, <Q>there is reason enough: for we all know him to be one of the greatest liars in the world.</Q></P>
<P N="202">202. A countryman that lived in London three years, when he went home, a friend asked him, if he saw Whitehall? No, says he. Nor the tower? says the other. No, says he. Strange, replied the other what could be the reason of it?" "Why, truly," says he, <Q>Squire Akerman, the keeper of Newgate, was so cross a fellow, he would not let me out to see any thing.</Q></P>
<P N="203">203. An Indian chief being asked his opinion of a cask of Madeira wine presented to him by an officer, said, he thought it a juice extracted from women's tongues and lion's hearts; for after he had drank a bottle of it, he said, <HI>he could talk for ever, and fight the devil.</HI></P>
<P N="204">204. When dr. Swift was dean of St. Patrick's, he was informed by one of the chapters, that the beadle of the cathedral was a poet. The doctor sent for him, and asked him some questions relating to his poetical talents, which he modestly disclaim∣ed, asserting that he only wrote for his bell. It be∣ing winter, the doctor insisted he should compose some verses on the fifth of November, and repeat them under his window, which accordingly he did; and the dean was so pleased, that he rewarded the composer with a guinea, declaring at the same time, that he was a better composer than Ambrose Philips. The following were the lines repeated under the dean's window:
<Q><L>To-night's the day, I speak it to my sorrow,</L>
<L>That we were all t'have been blown up to-morrow;</L>
<L>Therefore take care of coals and candle light,</L>

<P N="206">206. Some gentlemen coming out of a tavern pretty merry, a link boy cried, have a light, gen∣tlemen? Light yourself to the devil, you dog, says one of the company. Bless you, master, replied the boy, <HI>I can find the way in the dark; shall I light your honour there?</HI></P>

<P N="210">210. Two girls disputed about precedency, one the daughter of a gentleman of small fortune, the other of a brewer.

of the counsel who was very apt to brow beat the witnesses, asked what distance he was from the par∣ties when the assault happened? The carpenter an∣swered, just four feet, five inches, and a half. How came you to be so very exact? said the counsellor. <HI>Because I expected some such fool would ask me,</HI> answer∣ed the witness, and so I measured it.</P>
<P N="212">212. One sent his man to a lawyer for advice, without a fee, but was slighted; then his master went and gave him his fee: O, now, says the lawyer, I understand you.

The people at the fire hearing this, all start∣ed up and ran to the door, to see the horse eating oysters: the moment they left their seats, George took an opportunity to plant himself before the fire, with a table and a cloth behind him.

The fellow said, no gentlemen, 'tis for a wager; I am to run in boots and he in his shoes and stockings. Then said the mob, well run boots, for shoes will never overtake thee.</P>

A lady seeing a tolerable pretty fellow, who by the help of a taylor and sempstress had transform∣ed himself into a beau, said, What pity it is to see one whom nature has made no fool, so industrious to pass for an ass: Rather, says another, one should pity those whom nature abuses, than those who abuse nature; besides the town would be robbed of one half of its diversion, <HI>if it should be a crime to laugh at a fool.</HI></P>

The champion without more words, came up to him, and closing with him, took him on such an advanta∣geous lock, that he pitched him clear over the pails; and with a great deal of unconcern, took up his spade
<PB N="75" REF="021643_0073_0FB4EA04473DCE38"/>

Walk publicly in the streets! and why not, pray sir? answered the little woman. Because, said he, <HI>you are built directly contrary to act of parlia∣ment; you are but two stories high, and your balcony hangs over your house of office.</HI></P>

Why, you sit there, said the clown, and I nod at you; then I am the <HI>nodder,</HI> and you the <HI>noddee.</HI></P>
<P N="305">305. A sober good woman, who was treating with a maid-servant about work and wages, asked her among other questions, what <HI>religion</HI> she was of?

The man going accordingly to the shepherd, delivered his master's message, and concluded as he was ordered, that his master wanted a fool. <HI>Why are you going away then?</HI> said the shep∣herd.

310. A certain poetaster, whose head was full of a play of his own writing, was explaining the plot and design of it to a friend. The scene of it, said he, is in <HI>Cappadocia;</HI> and to judge rightly of the play, a man must transport himself into the country and get acquainted with the genius of the people. You say right, answered the friend, <HI>and I think it would be best to have it acted there.</HI></P>

That, answered the steward, is not big enough to hold it: So I told my wife, replied the good man; <HI>and I believe we have had a hundred words about it.</HI> Ay, said the steward, but they were not such as will butter any cabbage to eat with this bacon; and so hangs the flitch up again.</P>

<P>The doctor being in the next room, overheard all that was said, and coming into the school, he order∣ed the boy who had eaten the grapes to be taken up, or, as they called it, horsed on another boy's back, but before he proceeded to the usual discipline, he cried out aloud, as the delinquent had done; 'I publish the banns between my rod and this boy's breech; if any one knows any just cause or impedi∣ment why these two should not be joined together, let him declare it?' I forbid the banns, cried the boy. Why so? said the doctor. Because the parties <HI>are not agreed,</HI> replied the boy. Which answer so

A gentle sprinkle of rain happening, a plough-boy left his work, and went home; but his master seeing him there, told him that he should not have left off his work for so trifling an affair, and de∣sired for the future he would stay till it <HI>rained down∣right.</HI> A day or two afterwards proving a very rainy day, the boy stayed till dusk, and being almost drowned, his master asked him why he did not come before? Why I should, says the boy, but you zed I shou'dn't come hoam vore it rain'd downright; <HI>and it has not rained downright yet, for it was aslaunt all day long.</HI></P>

The poor man, however, was advised to sue for the money, and when the cause came on to be tried, it appearing that the seal had not been broken, nor the bag ripped, the judge said to the de∣fendant's counsel. The bag you lost had a hundred and ten pounds in it, you say? Yes, my lord, says he. Then, replied the judge, according to the evi∣dence given in court, this cannot be your money, for here were only a hundred pounds; <HI>therefore the plaintiff must keep it till the true owner appears.</HI></P>

the ship is that?</HI> Ha! ha! ha! chuckled the sailor, <HI>are not you a pretty fellow for a counsellor,</HI> pointing archly at him with his finger, <HI>not to know what place abaft the binocle is!</HI></P>
<P N="320">320. A gentleman being at dinner at a friend's house, the first thing that came upon the table was a dish of whitings, and one being put on his plate, he found it stink so much that he could not touch it; and then took up the plate and put it to his ear. The gentleman, at whose table he was seated, enquiring into the meaning of this extraordinary behaviour, he told him that he had lost a brother at sea about a fortnight ago, and was asking that fish if he knew any thing of him? Well, said the gen∣tleman pleasantly, and what answer did he make you?—Why, replied the other, very gravely, he told me that he could not possibly give me any ac∣count of my deceased brother, <HI>as he had not been at sea these three weeks.</HI></P>
<P N="321">321. A gentleman, whose father had been rob∣bed of a considerable quantity of plate, dined with the son of a wealthy man supposed to have been a receiver. A large silver tureen was brought to the table without a cover.

The good man lamented the loss of his helpmate with the most unaffected sorrow, and remained for some months quite inconsolable. His neighbours now thought it their duty to reason him into resignation.
<PB N="84" REF="021643_0082_0FB4EA1E937E7698"/>
My friend, said one of them, the wife you have lost, was really an excellent woman, but still you have a good remedy; you are a young and an honest man, and you will find no difficulty in procuring another. For my part, continued he, I have three daughters, and shall be happy to call you son-in-law. Another, on this, offered him his sister; and a third, his niece. Good God, says the mourner, what a strange place this is, since a man who lives here, had better lose his wife than his cow! My wife is dead, and behold! you tell me, I may pick and choose, to supply her place: <HI>but when my poor cow died, nobody ever thought of offering me another.</HI></P>
<P N="323">323. A gentleman was one day at a public enter∣tainment, where one of the company sat several hours without speaking a syllable; and as from the character of the person, there was great reason to suspect that his silence was owing to a supercilious contempt of the company, he determined to shew his resentment the first opportunity that offered.—Accordingly, when supper was brought in, he was remarkably assiduous in helping the silent man to the best on the table, and taking care to supply his plate when he saw it nearly empty: upon this one of the company desired to know his reason for this ex∣traordinary attention to the silent person? To which he replied, I assure you, it is from the tender∣ness of my disposition, <HI>for I cannot bear to see a dumb creature want.</HI> This smart stroke had the desired effect.</P>
<P N="324">324. When his British majesty paid a visit to ad∣miral Parker's fleet at the Nore, it was impossible that every sailor on board could have an opportunity of beholding his sovereign. In consequence of this disappointment, the officers granted liberty to as many as possibly could be spared ashore, to go and see the royal visitors at Sheerness and Chatham.—When the king entered the lines at Chatham, the crowd was extremely great, and pressing very hard to see him; a sailor's curiosity led him so far as to push,
<PB N="85" REF="021643_0083_0FB4EA20EC45B998"/>
just as his majesty and the prince were passing in front of a serjeant of the 65th regiment, who was obliged to knock the butt end of his musket on Jack's toes, to keep him back, which made him grumble very much; the king overhearing the dis∣pute, turn'd round to the serjeant, and desired him to hurt no person; if he could do his duty by gentle means, do it, if not, let the people satisfy their curiosity. The enraged seaman on hearing this, exclaimed, God bless your majesty! <HI>I have leave from my officers; and d—n my eyes if e'er a lobster in England shall hinder me from seeing your royal kingship!</HI> This had such an effect on the king and the prince, that they were observed to laugh very heartily.</P>

Accordingly, when the highwayman presented his pistol, and commanded Quick to deli∣ver his money instantly, or he was a dead man—<HI>Money!</HI> returned he with an idiotic shrug, and a countenance inexpressibly vacant—<HI>O Lud, sir, they

never trusts me with any; for nuncle here always pays for me, twinpikes and all, your honour!</HI>—Upon which the highwayman gave him a few hearty curses for his stupidity,—complimented the old gen∣tleman with a smart slap on the face to awaken him, and robbed him of every shilling he had in his pocket; while Quick, who did not lose a single far∣thing, with great satisfaction and merriment pur∣sued his journey, laughing heartily at his fellow traveller.</P>

Among the rest, there was a little sturdy black fellow, and the duke asking him what he had been sent thither for: <HI>my lord,</HI> said he, <HI>I cannot deny but I am justly sent hither, for finding I wanted money, I carried off a purse not far from Tarragona, in order to keep me from starving.</HI> The duke, with a little staff he had in his hand, gave him two or three taps on the shoulder, saying, <HI>You rogue, what do you here, among so many honest innocent men? Get out of their company.</HI> Accord∣ingly he was set free, and the rest were left to tug at the oar.</P>

An honest fellow did so lately in London, and was admitted to the condemned men on the morn∣ing whereon they were to die.

<HEAD>NEW ANECDOTES of the late KING of PRUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P N="369">369. When Frederic was building the palace of Sans-Souci, there was a mill, which disconcerted him greatly in the execution of his palace, and he sent to enquire of the miller what he would take for it. The miller answered, that for a long series of
<PB N="94" REF="021643_0092_0FB4EA35E500FDF0"/>
years his family had possessed the mill from father to son, and he would not sell it. The king was very pressing to gain his point, and even offered to build another mill for him in a better situation, exclusive of the sum that he might demand of him. The ob∣stinate miller persisted in keeping the inheritance of his ancestors. The king, irritated, sent for the man, and sternly said to him, <Q>why will you not sell me your mill, notwithstanding the advanta∣geous offers I have made you?</Q> The miller re∣peated all his reasons. "Don't you know," said the king, <Q>that I could take it without giving you one penny?</Q> "Yes," answered the miller, <Q>if there were no chamber of justice at Berlin.</Q> The king, who had himself instituted this court for the more speedy relief of the injured, was extremely pleased with this answer, which intimated that he was thought incapable of an act of injustice. He suffered the man to enjoy his mill, and altered the plan of his gardens.</P>
<P N="370">370. A reduced officer who had served with great bravery as lieutenant colonel during the war of seven years, repaired every day to the king's ante-chamber to solicit a pension. The king had often said to him, <Q>have patience, I cannot at present do any thing for you.</Q> The officer was not repulsed, and wherever he found the king, did not fail to im∣portune him. The king, tired with his perseverance, ordered that he should be admitted no more. In the mean time a violent satire appeared against Frederic, who, contrary to his usual custom, promised a reward of fifty louis for the discovery of the author. The next day, the lieutenant colonel repaired to the pa∣lace and was refused admittance. He persisted, however, adding that he had something of import∣ance to communicate to his majesty. He is announ∣ced, and enters. "Have I not told you," said Frederic, <Q>that I can do nothing for you at pre∣sent?</Q> "I require nothing," answered the offi∣cer, <Q>but what your majesty has promised. I am
<PB N="95" REF="021643_0093_0FB4EA395495AB28"/>
the author of the pamphlet that has just appear∣ed against your majesty. Punish me, if you please, but pay the fifty louis to my wife, that she may buy bread for my wretched children.</Q>—<Q>The d—l confound you,</Q> said the king, <Q>you shall go to the Spandau.</Q> [This is a fortress where military and state prisoners are either confin∣ed or obliged to work on the fortifications.] "Sire," said the officer, <Q>I submit to whatever your majesty orders with respect to myself; but pray do not forget the money.</Q> "In an hour's time," replied the king, "your wife shall have it." The king then sat down, wrote a letter, and gave it to the offi∣cer, saying, <Q>you will deliver this to the command∣ant of Spandau, and tell him that I forbid him to open it till he has dined.</Q> He then ordered the officer to be conducted to Spandau. He arrives there, and presents the letter to the commandant, with the verbal orders. The commandant dines. The officer remains in cruel suspence; the letter is at last opened, and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>The bearer of this letter is appointed com∣mandant of the fortress of Spandau, his wife and children will be there soon with fifty louis. The former commandant will repair to Potzdam, where a better place awaits him.</P>

</LETTER>
<P N="371">371. Frederic rung his bell one day and nobody answered. He opened the door, and found the page asleep on a sofa. He was going to wake him when he perceived the end of a billet sticking out of his pocket. He had the curiosity to know the contents; he took and read it. It was a letter from his mo∣ther, who thanked him for having sent her a part of his wages, to assist her in distress; and besought God to bless him for his filial goodness. The king re∣turned to his room, took a roller of ducats, and slid them with the letter into the page's pocket. Re∣turning to his apartment, he rang so violently that the page awaked and entered. <Q>You have slept
<PB N="96" REF="021643_0094_0FB4EA3C894AD860"/>
well,</Q> said the king. The page made an apolo∣gy, and in his embarrassment, happened to put his hand into his pocket, and felt with astonishment the paper of money. He drew it out, turned pale, and looking at the king, burst into tears without being able to speak a word. "What is the matter?" said the king, "What ails you?" "Ah! fire," said the young man, throwing himself at his feet, <Q>some body would wish to ruin me. I know not how this money came into my pocket.</Q> <Q>My friend,</Q> said the king, <Q>God often sends us good in our sleep. Give it to thy mother. Salute her in my name, and tell her that I will take care of her and you.</Q></P>
<P N="372">372. One day while Frederic was looking out at the window of his apartment, he observed one of the pages take a pinch of snuff from his box, which was lying on the table. The king did not inter∣rupt him, but turning round from the window a lit∣tle while after, he asked the page, if he liked that snuff box? The page, quite ashamed, made no an∣swer. The king repeated the question, and the page having at length said that he thought it very pretty—"Well," replied his majesty, <Q>pray take it—it is too small for us both.</Q></P>
