<HEAD>Dedication.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TO JOHN ADAMS, L.L.D. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHOUGH I am aware, that by electing for my humble productions a patron∣age so distinguished, I hazard the accusation of presumption, I rest confident that your candour will ascribe my temerity to the best possible motive.</P>
<P>THAT benignity and dignified affability, which is perhaps inseparable from a truly no∣ble mind, may be compared to the lucid veil, that, thrown around the orient beam, accom∣modates to our imbecile gaze those splendors, which might otherwise dazzle and confound; we trace with enkindling ardor the mildly at∣tempered radiance, we learn to appreciate its worth, and spontaneously we bless its genial path.</P>
<P>To dwell with accumulating energy upon the pleasing past, is one of the appropriate felicities of reason; and, amid the review of other times, retrospection frequently presents to my mental eye, a period which memory piously conse∣crates, when, privileged by an opportunity of
<PB N="iv" REF="034162_0003_0FFC5DA10E47DE58"/>
contemplating the President, during the white moments of social pleasure, the domestic vir∣tues collected and embodied, were exemplified with uncommon lustre; and while the recol∣lection of his philanthropic manners, and uni∣form elevation, gives me to mark with addi∣tional complacency, the ascendency he hath so meritoriously obtained in the public mind, I re∣gard the authority to inscribe these volumes to him among the most elating circumstances of my life.</P>
<P>WERE I to indulge the genuine language of my heart, it would be a task of no ordinary de∣scription, to circumscribe within due bounds those expansive effusions resulting from admi∣ration of his character, and from affectionate gratitude for the very essential services he hath rendered to a country, that may consider his birth as an era in her annals, and that justly places this event among her highest honours.</P>
<P>THE homage we yield to eminent abilities, and luminous rectitude, can never involve the charge of singularity; for genius, elevated by virtue and unimpeached integrity, adorned by literature, elegance and taste, have in all ages commanded the esteem and veneration of man∣kind: but although I might plead the sanction of numerous and respectable examples, I can∣not,
<PB N="v" REF="034162_0004_0FFC5D9F8B13EC18"/>
however, discern the utility of essaying to prove, that the majesty of day illumines our world, or that his salutary influence, like some gladdening deity, diffuses over the face of na∣ture, consistency, harmony, and unrivalled beauty.</P>
<P>THAT America has looked up to you, Sir, as her second hope, is a truth which carries in its bosom a panegyric upon your virtues more im∣pressive, than if an angel had pronounced your eulogy; and while our fervid benedictions must ever follow the retiring Chief, whose guardian care conducted our benighted footsteps over paths untried and perilous, to a brilliant morn∣ing, the refulgent dawn of which is regarded as the harbinger of a glorious meridian, we hail with ardent expectancy his patriotic suc∣cessor, who, like another Elisha, clothed in the sacred vestments of authority, inherits a full proportion of that spirit, which rested upon him, who, emancipating his country from un∣warrantable usurpations, will ever be recog∣nised as her DELIVERER: Thus, in the same moment that to the name of Washington, re∣spectful gratitude, bending over the unperish∣ing record of his illustrious acts, establishes in the Columbian bosom her eternal monuments; we exult in an ADAMS, whose transcendent tal∣ents,
<PB N="vi" REF="034162_0005_0FFC5D9A396469D0"/>
and whose vigilance, are fully adequate to the emergencies and the dangers of a FREE GOVERNMENT; whose wisdom and magnanim∣ity will firmly guide the helm of State; who, although contending storms may assail, and the big waves of opposition may lash the bark, will pursue with unwavering intrepidity, his destin∣ed way; while rectitude his chart, and expe∣rience his compass, he must assuredly make the broad and ample harbour of Security.</P>
<P>YES, Sir, I indulge a hope that your name may not only shield me from the oblivion I dread, but possibly confer a degree of celebri∣ty, to which my own merit may not furnish a title; yet whatever is the fate of pretensions originating perhaps in arrogance, may you, Sir, pursue your course with ever new effulgence. The guardian of a nation's weal, you will watch over us for good. May you long continue to direct, enliven, and invigorate; and may your parting moments set serenely bright.</P>
<P>I HAVE, Sir, the honour to be, with every sentiment of esteem and veneration,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>MY Readers will not call my veracity in question, when I assure them that I am ardently anxious for their approbation. A lover of hu∣manity, I do not remember the period when I was not solicitous to render myself acceptable to all those who were naturally or adventitiously my associates. Had I possessed ability, I should have advanced every individual of my species to the highest state of felicity, of which the present scene is susceptible; but circumscribed within very nar∣row bounds, I have, I had almost said momently, been reduced to the necessity of lamenting the in∣efficacy of my wishes. Yet this my <HI>ruling passion,</HI> a fondness to stand well in the opinion of the world, having given a prevalent hue to every im∣portant action of my life, hath operated powerfully upon my ambition, stimulated my efforts, and im∣planted in my bosom an invincible desire to pre∣sent myself before a public which I reverence, ir∣resistibly impelling me to become a candidate for that complacency we naturally feel toward those persons, or that performance, which hath contrib∣uted to our emolument, or even amusement.</P>
<P>MY desires are, I am free to own, aspiring—perhaps presumptuously so. I would be distin∣guished
<PB N="viii" REF="034162_0007_0FFC5D92D6492F58"/>
and respected by my contemporaries; I would be continued in grateful remembrance when I make my exit; and I would descend with celeb∣rity to posterity.</P>
<P>HAD I been mistress of talents for an achievement so meritorious, my first object in writing would have been the information and improvement of my readers; nor will I deny that a pleasing hope plays about my heart, suggesting a possibility of my becoming in some small degree beneficial to those young people, who, just entering the career of life, may turn, with all the endearing ardour of youth∣ful enthusiasm, to a <HI>New Book,</HI> to an <HI>American Au∣thor;</HI> and while with partial avidity they pursue the <HI>well intended</HI> pages, they may select a hint, or treasure up a remark, which may become useful in the destined journey of life.</P>
<P>BUT vanity, in the most extravagant moments of her triumph, having never flattered me with the capability of conveying instruction to those, whose understandings have passed the age of adolescence, my view has only been to <HI>amuse;</HI> and if I can do this without offending, I shall be honoured with a place in some gentle bosom where I should else have been unknown; I shall obtain a portion of esteem, and my <HI>ruling passion</HI> will be thus far gratified.</P>
<P>To have presented a finished or perfect produc∣tion, (such is my fondness for literary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame) I would gladly have relinquished my <HI>present mode of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, more—I would have laboured for the comple∣tion
<PB N="ix" REF="034162_0008_0FFC5D914EB9B6E0"/>
of such a composition through a long succes∣sion of lengthening years, although my life had been a scene of <HI>penury</HI> and <HI>hardship.</HI></P>
<P>WITH such sentiments I shall not be suspected of writing hastily or carelessly. The truth is, I have penned every essay as cautiously as if I had been assured my reputation rested solely upon that single effort: yet defects of almost every de∣scription may too probably occur; the Gramma∣rian, the Rhetorician, the Poet, these may all trace such palpable deviations from the given standard, as may render me, in their opinion, an unpardona∣ble offender against the rules of language, and the elegance and graces of style. Possibly too, thus laid open to all the severity of criticism, I may be arraigned, tried and condemned; and in this case it is certainly true, that I am preparing for myself the severest pangs. But, be this as it may, I rest assured, that the feelings of the Moralist being in no instance wounded, he will accept with complacency my efforts in the common cause, and humanely shield me from those shafts which might otherwise transfix my peace.</P>
<P>HAVING, in the concluding Essay, given my reasons for assuming the masculine character, I have only further to observe, that those who ad∣mit the utility of conveying instruction and amuse∣ment by allegory or metaphor, and who allow the propriety of giving a tongue to the inanimate world, and speech to the inferior orders of the creation, will not object to the liberty I have taken. It is
<PB N="x" REF="034162_0009_0FFC5D8FC8FE3F00"/>
superfluous to add, that allegory and fable are not only authorized by the best moral writers, but are also sanctioned by holy writ.</P>
<P>I CANNOT urge in defence of my temerity, that the importunity of friends hath drawn me forth—certainly not. But, worthy reader, I repeat that I have been animated, in this my arduous pursuit, <HI>by a desire to be introduced to thee, by a wish to make one in the number of thy friends. I am solicitous to ob∣tain an establishment in the bosom of virtue</HI>—I would advance my claim to the sweetly soothing strains of just applause; and I would secure for myself, and for my infant daughter, (should our future exi∣gencies require it) thy amity and thy patronage.</P>
<P>IF thou proceedest through the volumes before thee, we shall pass on together through many a page; the sentiments of my heart will be unreserv∣edly pourtrayed; and I fondly persuade myself that thou wilt, without reluctance, embrace in the arms of thy complacency, thy most obedient, and sincerely devoted friend, and very humble servant,</P>

<L>And ardent wish to glean a brightening name.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OBSERVING in the general preface, published in the <HI>December</HI> Magazine,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader is requested to remember, that the Essays which compose this First Volume were written purposely for the Monthly Museum, in which they originally appeared; and that they now stand precisely in the order, and nearly in the manner, in which they were first presented.</NOTE> a hint which I have construed into a desire to increase the number of your miscellaneous correspondents; and, stimulated by the delicate reproof upon literary indolence, which that elegant exordium contains, I feel myself, while sitting quite at my leisure, on this evening of January 27th, 1792, strongly incited by my <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad genius—the event</HI> must determine the character of the spright which is goading me on, to take into my serious consideration, the solicitation which in said preface is so modestly urged, and which squares so wonderfully well with my ideas of the reason and fitness of things.</P>
<P>Not that I shall aim at palming myself upon the pub∣lic, for a son of literature, a votary of the nine, or a dabbler in wit. I have no pretension to any of these characters. I am <HI>rather</HI> a plain man, who, after spend∣ing the day in making provision for my little family, sit myself comfortably down by a clean hearth, and a good fire, enjoying, through these long evenings, with an ex∣quisite
<PB N="14" REF="034162_0013_0FFC5D8529C36FD0"/>
zest, the pleasures of the hour, whether they happen to be furnished by an amusing tale, a well written book, or a social friend. Possibly I might have jogged on to the end of my journey, in this sober, tranquil manner: but alas, for some time past, I think, as near as I can remember, ever since the commencement of your Magazine, I have been seized with a violent desire to become a writer. To combat this unaccountable itch for scribbling, it is in vain that I have endeavoured; it follows me through all the busy scenes which the day presents; it is my constant accompaniment in every nocturnal haunt; and it often keeps me waking, when, I verily believe, but for this restless desire, I might enjoy, in the fullest latitude, every blessing which hath ever yet been ascribed to sleep.</P>
<P>The many comprehensive titles, and alluring sig∣natures, which have from time to time embellished your Magazine, have well near captivated my reason; and among many <HI>et ceteras,</HI> which might be enumer∣ated, the following appellations have had for me pe∣culiar charms: An ample field seemed opening in the title page of the <HI>General Observer;</HI> the name <HI>Philo</HI> appeared replete with studious lore; the <HI>Politician</HI> was indefatigable for the good of the nation; the <HI>Philanthropist</HI> bled sympathy; and with the <HI>Rivulet</HI> I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>raptured. At the bar of fancy, many a title for my intended essays hath been tried, and hath been successively condemned. A variety of signatures have been deliberately adopted, and as deliberately displaced, until my pericranium hath been nearly turned with thinking. Unfortu∣nately, with my wish to commence author, originated also, a most inordinate ambition, and an insatiable thirst for applause. In whatever line I made my appearance, I was solicitous to stand unequalled.—I would be Cesar, or I would be nothing. The smoothness of Addison's page, the purity, strength and correctness of Swift, the magic numbers of Pope
<PB N="15" REF="034162_0014_0FFC5D827B376898"/>
—these must all veil to me. The Homers and Vir∣gils of antiquity, I would rival; and, audacious as I am, from the Philenia's of the present age, I would arrogantly snatch the bays. Strange as is this ac∣count, it is nevertheless true. And, moreover, all these wild extravagancies have been engendered in a brain, which it may be, doth not possess abilities ade∣quate to the furnishing a paragraph in a common newspaper! My case, I assure you, Gentlemen, hath been truly pitiable, while, for three years past, I have been struggling with an inflatus, which hath been almost irresistible. Reason, however, aided, as I said, by a conviction of inferiority, hath hitherto restrained me; but your last preface hath done the business—it hath interested my feelings, and induced <HI>even reason</HI> to enlist under the banners of temerity—the fire thus long pent up, cannot now be smothered, but acquiring, from its confinement, additional fer∣vour, it at length produces me a candidate for that applause, by a prospect of which, you are solicitous to engage your readers in the arduous pursuit of fame.</P>
<P>Thus resolved, the die is cast, and this ungovernable mania admits of one only remedy. But having once made up my mind to write, an appellation is the next thing to be considered; for as to subjects, my san∣guine hopes assure me they will follow of course. A writer of facetious memory, hath represented his dear Jenny, when she could not obtain the tissued robe, as meekly assuming the humblest garb which frugality could furnish. I am fond of respectable examples, and I have humility enough to be influenced by them.</P>
<P>My title having much exercised my mind, and be∣ing convinced that any considerable achievements are beyond my grasp, upon mature deliberation I have thought best to adopt, and I do hereby adopt, the name, character, and avocation of a GLEANER; and this appellation, I do freely confess, gives a full and
<PB N="16" REF="034162_0015_0FFC5D7FE1C33040"/>
complete idea of my present amazingly curtailed views.</P>
<P>Here pride suggests a question, What is any mod∣ern scribbler better than a Gleaner? But I very <HI>saga∣ciously</HI> reply, Let my brethren and sisters of the quill characterize themselves; I shall not thus, upon the very threshold of the vocation of my election, enter the lists.</P>
<P>The truth is, I am very fond of my title: I con∣ceive that I shall find it in many respects abundantly convenient; more especially, should an accusation of plagiarism be lodged against me, my very <HI>title</HI> will plead my apology; for it would be indeed pitiful if the opulent reaper, whose granaries are confessedly large, and variously supplied, should grudge the poor Gleaner what little he industriously collects, and what, from the richness and plenty of his ample harvest, he can never want.</P>
<P>With diligence then, I shall ransack the fields, the meadows, and the groves; each secret haunt, how∣ever sequestered, with avidity I shall explore; deem∣ing myself privileged to crop with impunity a hint from one, an idea from another, and to aim at im∣provement upon a sentence from a third. I shall give to my materials whatever texture my fancy directs; and, as I said, feeling myself entitled to toleration as a Gleaner, in this expressive name I shall take shelter, standing entirely regardless of every charge relative to property, originality, and every thing of this nature, which may be preferred against me.</P>
<P>Mean time, should any of the Parnassian girls, or his godship Apollo, or any other genius, sylph, or gnome, of legendary or fairy ancestry, fond of encou∣raging a young beginner, throw into my basket an <HI>unbroken sheaf,</HI> you may depend upon it that I will assay to form the valuable original, with all the care, ac∣curacy and skill which close thinking, deep study, and an ardent desire to excel, can bestow; and you may far∣ther
<PB N="17" REF="034162_0016_0FFC5D7D00BEA898"/>
assure yourselves, that when thus highly wrought, I shall haste to present the precious gift, a fit offering at the shrine of the Massachusetts Magazine. Thus having, as far as it lays with me, adjusted prelimina∣ries, I propose myself, Gentlemen, as a candidate for a place in your Magazine. If my pretensions are judged inadmissible, presiding in your respectable divan, you have but to wave your oblivious wand, and I am <HI>forever</HI> silenced. I confess, however, that I have no violent inclination to see the Gleaner among your list of acknowledgments to correspondents, set up as a mark for the shafts of wit, however burnish∣ed they may be.</P>
<P>You, Gentlemen, possess the specific at which I have already hinted, and by which I may be radically cured; and if this attempt is really as absurd as I am even now, at times, inclined to think it, your non-insertion of, and silence thereto, will operate as effect∣ually as the severest reprehension, and will be regard∣ed by the Gleaner as a judgment from which there is no appeal.</P>

<Q><L>Whether o'er meadows, or through groves I stray,</L>
<L>Industry points her broad directing ray;</L>
<L>With care I glean, e'en in the well trod field,</L>
<L>The scatter'd fragments it perchance may yield.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO the Editors of the Massachusetts Magazine I make my best <HI>congee,</HI> and without any fur∣ther prefatory address, I shall, in future, produce my piece-meal commodities, fresh as I may happen to collect them.</P>
<P>Bless me! cried Margaretta, while, in the hope of meeting something from the pen of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, she threw her fine eyes in a cursory manner ever the in∣dex to the February Magazine. But pray, it may
<PB N="18" REF="034162_0017_0FFC5D7907C29E38"/>
be asked, who is Margaretta? Curiosity is, without doubt, a useful if not a laudable propensity; and, if it is the parent of many evils, it is but fair to ac∣knowledge, that it hath also among its numerous sons and daughters some extremely well favoured children. Curiosity hath given birth to the most arduous pur∣suits; its achievements have been of the greatest util∣ity; and without this stimulus we should have great reason to fear an universal stagnation in every branch of knowledge. Moreover, this same curiosity con∣sorts, at this present, very exactly with my feelings; for the question—Pray, who is Margaretta? involves a subject upon which I expatiate with infinite satisfac∣tion, and upon which I have never yet lost an oppor∣tunity of being loquaciously communicative.</P>
<P>At the close of the late war, when I was an idle young fellow, fond of indulging myself in every lux∣ury which the small patrimony that descended to me from a very worthy father, would permit, I conceived an invincible desire of becoming a spectator of the felicity which I imagined the inhabitants of South-Carolina, particularly the suffering metropolis of that State, would experience on their emancipation from a succession of evils, which, for a period of seven years, had continued to occupy their minds, giving them to taste deeply of every calamity consequent upon a war, conducted in that part of our country with almost unparalleled barbarity. I had early connected my∣self in the bands of wedlock with a young woman of a mild and conceding disposition, who sincerely loved me, and who, accommodating herself even to my caprices, hath made it the study of her life, when she could not convince my judgment, however ra∣tional her arguments in her own estimation, to bend to my purposes her most approved wishes.</P>
<P>When I announced my intention of visiting South Carolina, she could not forbear suggesting some economical ideas; but upon a declaration that I was determined to execute my plan, she sub∣mitted

with that kind of acquiescence, which our sex is so fond of considering as the proper charac∣teristic of womanhood. For a progress then of many hundred miles, in a one horse chaise, we commenced our journey; we intended to pass on by easy stages; and, moreover, we were accom∣panied by one of the patriotic exiled citizens of Charleston, with whom, during a struggle which asso∣ciated the remotest subjects of the union, we had contracted an intimate acquaintance. The kindness of this gentleman, who was well mounted, serving us as a relay, we proceeded expeditiously enough, and I do not remember that I ever in my life passed my time more agreeably. Many scenes novel and inter∣esting, prospects extensive, and views truly pictur∣esque, arrested our attention; and were I not hasting to give a solution to the reader's question, I might perhaps amuse him very tolerably, in the descriptive line, through two or three pages close printing; but in a course of publications, I may possibly again re∣cur to exhibitions which pleased me so highly at the time, when I may be more at leisure to <HI>glean</HI> what∣ever flower recollection may furnish.</P>
<P>On our arrival in Charleston we found our most sanguine expectations answered; the joy of the libe∣rated citizens was unbounded—it was beyond de∣scription; nor can I give a better idea of their sat∣isfaction than by pronouncing it in exact proportion to, and fully commensurate with, their preceding sufferings. Our companion, however, was, by the same unwarrantable measures which had wrecked many a princely fortune, stripped of his whole in∣heritance; so that being entire strangers in Charleston, we were necessitated to provide ourselves with hired lodgings.</P>
<P>Our landlady was a widow of reputation, whose house was frequented only by people of the utmost circumspection. The second day after our arrival, as the good woman was pouring the tea, which
<PB N="20" REF="034162_0019_0FFC5D74C708B860"/>
we had chosen for breakfast, a gentle tap at the door drew our attention. My wife, who is in fact the pink of civility, was mechanically rising to open it, when she was prevented by our hostess, who cried, Sit down, Madam, it is nobody but the child. My dear Mary, who is extravagantly fond of children, catching at the sound, eagerly replied, "Then, Madam, you have a young family." "No, Madam," returned the hostess, "it is long since my young folks have been grown up about me; but this little creature belongs to an unfortunate lodger of mine, who is continually weeping over her, and who I am afraid will not long be an inhabitant of this bad world; indeed I suppose her present errand is occa∣sioned by some new distress of her mother's, for the pretty thing is wonderfully sensible for such a mere baby." My poor wife, in whose composition human∣ity is the paramount ingredient, instantly found her benevolence engaged; all her tender feelings took the alarm; and, precipitately quitting her chair, in a tre∣mulous voice she exclaimed, "Pray, Madam, neglect not the unfortunate sick person for us; I can fill the tea, and I beseech you to admit the little petitioner." The good woman, pronouncing a panegyric upon the tenderness of my wife's disposition, forthwith threw open the door, when a little female, apparently about ten years of age, presented herself; she was beautiful as innocence, and her figure was of that kind, which seems formed to interest every benign principle of the soul; which is calculated to invigorate, even in the bosom of the most phlegmatic, the latent sparks of pity, although nearly smothered there.</P>
<P>"Oh Mrs. Thrifty!" exclaimed the heart affecting pleader, <Q>will you not come to my mamma? will you not give her some more of them blessed drops which yesterday made her so much better? she is—indeed she is</Q>—Here, casting her eyes toward us, whom her concern had before prevented her from seeing, and who were regarding her with a mixture of pity and
<PB N="21" REF="034162_0020_0FFC5D73459E2410"/>
admiration, a modest blush tinged her cheek, which, even at that early age, had been too often washed by the tear of sorrow; and, bursting into an agony of grief, she remained silent. "Go on, Margaretta, said Mrs. Thrifty; let us know what new complaint you have to make; this gentleman and lady are very good, and will excuse you." Mary took the hand of the weeping cherub, and drawing her to her, im∣printed upon her humid cheek one of those balmy kisses which she is always ready to bestow upon the young proficient, thus early enlisted under the ban∣ners of misfortune. "Mrs. Thrifty says right, my dear, every body will love and pity you; tell us, how is your mamma?" The child, hanging upon the arm of my wife, expressed by her intelligent eyes a thousand mingling sensations; surprise, love, gratitude, and a corrected kind of joy, seemed to grow at once in her soul; and, bowing upon the hand of Mary in a per∣turbed manner, she spontaneously expressed the invol∣untary emotions of her bosom: <Q>Oh my dear lady, will you not see my mamma? certainly you can make her well, and she is indeed very sick; I thought this morning she would speak to me no more—she looked so pale—and was so long before she bid me repeat my morning hymn: Oh if my poor mamma should die—I cannot—indeed I can∣not stay here.</Q></P>
<P>Mary, it will not be doubted, bent her utmost efforts to soothe the sweet mourner. But not to dwell longer upon a subject, on which it will per∣haps be thought I have already too much enlarged, it shall suffice to say, that, through the good offices of her little friend, Mary soon procured an intro∣duction into the chamber of the sick—that, feel∣ings, which at first originated in compassion for the charming child, meliorated into a sympathetic kind of amity—and that, for the course of one week, she passed a very large proportion of her time in endeav∣ouring to mitigate the calamities of the suffering mat∣ron,
<PB N="22" REF="034162_0021_0FFC5D6D834F55F8"/>
Her assiduities, however, were not crowned with the salutary effects she wished; the patient, it was but too apparent, was hastening on to the hour of her dis∣solution; her disorder was a regular decline; the shafts of a deep-rooted and incurable grief, must, of necessity, be unerring; and it was evident, that in the bosom of the fair afflicted, corroding sorrow had in∣fixed its envenomed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooth. My wife often recom∣mended a resignation to, and reliance on, the disposi∣tions of a paternal God; but the dying woman shook her head, and continued her pity moving sighs: And about ten days after our abode at Mrs. Thrifty's, the poor lady recovering from a fainting fit, during which it was supposed she had breathed her last, summoned us into her apartment, and, consigning Margaretta to the care of Mrs. Thrifty, she thus addressed us:—</P>
<Q><P>You see before you, my friends—for friends, short as is the interval in which I have known you, a num∣ber of concurring circumstances evinces you, in the most exalted sense of the term, to be; but you are uniformly, I doubt not, the friends of the unfortu∣nate, and the Searcher of all hearts knows that my claim to your regards in this character is indubitable. You see before you, I say, a very distressed woman; for the sake of the child who is just gone from me, I will briefly recount to you the outlines, if I may so express myself, of my life. She is not, as she sup∣poses, my daughter—I never was a mother—I was the eldest of two sisters, who saw ourselves reduced from affluence to penury; we were orphans, and we were, by the rapacious hand of unexampled fraud, despoiled of our patrimony; our mutual affection, however, survived; and, upon the altar which our misfortunes had erected, we exchanged vows of eter∣nal amity. To a small town in the environs of London we retired, endeavouring to shelter our de∣fenceless heads, and to seek from honest industry, that support, of which, by faithless trustees, we had been robbed.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="034162_0022_0FFC5D6BDAA92260"/>
My sister was addressed by a young man, whom I conceived altogether unworthy of her; for the pride of my heart was yet unsubdued; she, how∣ever, notwithstanding all my remonstrances, persisted in encouraging the pursuit of young Melworth; while, so rooted was my aversion, so impassioned my decla∣rations, and so unyielding the anger which deformed my soul, that I rashly protested, the hour which made them one, should fix between us an everlasting bar, and that I would on no account, after such an event, hold with her the smallest intercourse. Their mar∣riage nevertheless took place, and to my sister's en∣treaties for a restoration of our former amities, my obdurate heart continued insensible.</P>
<P>About this time, Captain Arbuthnot made his ap∣pearance in our village; a tender friendship grew between us; it meliorated into love, and he, in some sort, supplied to me the place of my lost sister: Hymen sanctified our union, and I esteemed myself the happiest of women.</P>
<P>Of my sister, I knew but little; common same indeed informed me, that she was satisfied with her connexion, that her circumstances were easy, that she had given birth to one daughter, and with this intel∣ligence I was well enough contented. It is true, I was, by private whispers, assured that she pined after a reconciliation, and that she had often been heard to say, that a renewal of our once warm and glow∣ing attachment, was the only remaining requisite which was yet wanting to complete her felicity. Still, however, I was unmoved; and I verily believed that every tender sentiment, in regard to my sister, was eradicated from my bosom. It was at this junc∣ture that I accompanied Captain Arbuthnot in a journey of some months; and on my return, being upon a visit, among other occurrences which were retailed to me, I learned that Mr. Melworth, having engaged on board a ship which had foundered at sea, every life had been lost; and that Mrs. Melworth,
<PB N="24" REF="034162_0023_0FFC5D68B49C3748"/>
whose health was before in a declining state, was fast sinking under this calamitous event. The feelings of nature, were now, as by a shock of electricity, in∣stantly roused. Unspeakable was the agony of my soul! with the utmost speed I hasted to her abode; but alas! I was only in time to receive her last sighs! the dart which my unkindness had aimed at her peace, urged by a stroke so fatal, deeply transfixed her spirit, and she was absolutely expiring a martyr to the severity of her fate. Yet, ere she breathed her last, she bequeathed her little Margaretta to my care. The sweet infant, then only two years old, intuitively, as it should seem, threw her arms about my neck, while in the presence of Heaven, and in the hearing of her departing mother, I solemnly swore never to forsake her; and, since that hour, to shelter, to soothe, to restrain, and to direct my lovely charge, hath been the prime object of my life; but, yet a little while, and I shall be here no more. Oh thou sainted shade of my much wronged Margaretta! may my death, so similar to thy own, expiate my injustice to thee, thou first, most indulgent, and mildest of women.</P>
<P>In one of the regiments stationed in Ireland, and in the year eighty-one ordered to America, Captain Arbuthnot had a command; he was now my only friend, and with my little orphan, who imagined us her real parents, I resolved to follow his fortunes. We had been induced to suppose that case and afflu∣ence awaited us here; that the country was subdued, and that nothing remained for us but to take posses∣sion of the forfeited lands; but we have been mise∣rably deceived. Landing in this city, upon the third of June, as early as the seventh of the same month, the troops marched under the command of Lord Rawdon, encountering inconceivable difficulties, in a rapid progress beneath the intense rays of a burning sun, through the whole extent of the State. My un∣fortunate husband fell a victim to the climate, and to the wounds which he received in the engagement,
<PB N="25" REF="034162_0024_0FFC5D65B8E406A0"/>
which took place near Shubrick's plantation. Need the rest be told?—Upon the evacuation of Charleston, I was unable to embark with the troops. For my lit∣tle Margaretta, my last sigh will be breathed; it is for her, as I said, my humane friends, that I have thus long detained you. By the injuries of which they complain, the benevolent feelings of the inhabit∣ants of this city are blunted—what can I do? strang∣ers as you are, I solicit your advice—was she but provided for, my passage out of time would be easy; for, with regard to myself, I know no prospect so pleasing, as a speedy reunion with my Henry and my much injured sister▪ Mary cast upon me her intelligent eyes; I understood the reference, and I hastily replied, If, Madam, your confidence in us is sufficient to calm your mind, you may make yourself entirely easy about your girl; for, from this moment, we jointly invest ourselves with the guardianship of the little orphan, and we promise to consider her as the child of our affection. This was enough; the matron yielded up her spirit without a remaining re∣gret; and, after assisting at her obsequies, we returned home, well pleased with our new acquisition.</P></Q>

<P>"BLESS me!" cried Margaretta, "as I live, here is, in this Magazine, a publication entitled the Gleaner!" As she spoke, she bent her lovely face toward me, in order the more attentively to observe what effect this information produced in the lines of
<PB N="26" REF="034162_0025_0FFC5D61CE877B80"/>
my countenance, I endeavoured to preserve my ac∣customed gravity. Margaretta interrogated—"Dear Sir, did I not lately hear you say, that if you ever appeared in the world as an author, you would cer∣tainly be known by this appellation?" I was still silent—Margaretta continued,—"I protest, Sir, I am sorry you are forestalled, for I had promised myself a fund of improvement, whenever you should employ your talents as a writer: I expected also, much en∣tertainment from the various conjectures which I imagined would have been hazarded, relative to the real character of the Gleaner, and I was positive, that from the commendations which would undoubtedly have been bestowed upon my best friend, I should have experienced some of the finest sensations of which my gratefully duteous heart is susceptible." I saw that having entered upon a subject that her ingenuity never fails of rendering sufficiently copious, she would so manage it, as to prattle on, till her tender volubility had made of me the fool, into which it is always in her power, (my boasted equa∣nimity notwithstanding) to convert me. I judged it proper, therefore, to stop her in her career, and drawing my pipe from my mouth, I hastily exclaim∣ed—I tell you, child—I tell you, Miss Melworth, that the universe containeth not so vile an assassin of our best purposes, so dete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able a murderer of time, as that hangdog scoundrel—<HI>Procrastination.</HI> The poet was too cool when he pronounced him only a thief; for he who steals a commodity, may turn it to his own use, reaping thereby, at least a temporary ad∣vantage: whereas this same Procrastination, is in no sort benefited by what he seizes, since he absolutely ingulfs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, the precious moments upon which he lays his torpid paw; or, in other words, I aver, that even in the most virtuous bosom, every principle of firmness evaporates at his corrosive touch, and that his fangs are more deadly than the most mortal pestilence, for from the death which he inflicts,
<PB N="27" REF="034162_0026_0FFC5D604C40CB88"/>
there is no resurrection. Had I, immediately on my election, engaged in a composition of some kind or other, (for the versatility of the title allows the utmost latitude) had I forthwith sent it forward to the Editors, I should thus have secured, by appropria∣tion, the designation of my choice; but what regrets can redeem the past? read it, however, my dear, and let us profit by every means.</P>
<P>The reader will remember that at the time of this confab, the second number of the Gleaner was not written.</P>
<P>Margaretta read, and when she had finished the piece, I proceeded, without commenting thereon, to harangue the good girl, and Mary my wife (though I must confess, that few females stand less in need of lecturing) upon the value of time, upon the necessity of seizing it by the forelock, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And indeed is there a more estimable gem, a pearl of more intrinsic worth, than that quota of days, which is committed to every hand? and, since by grasping the moments we cannot detain them, since when once they have winged their flight, it is only by reflection that they are known, what industrious lapidaries ought we to be, that so their radiant influ∣ence may emit the most superb and lengthening beams of light. I have long been a warm admirer of that Roman Emperor, who is represented as lamenting in so impassioned a manner, the loss of a single day; and in truth, he could not possibly have been furnished with a more rational cause of regret; for, had he been robbed of his possessions, as an individual, the wheel of fortune is still revolving, and his ancient patrimony might have once more been established; were his vast dominions in any part dismembered, armed for conquest, he might have gone forth, and his victorious arm might possi∣bly have reunited the severed district; was he de∣prived of the choicest of his friends, with the gods they still remained, and futurity would doubtless
<PB N="28" REF="034162_0027_0FFC5D5D954F17E8"/>
restore them: but alas! the lapse of time he could never overtake, its course must be ever progressive, no hand can roll back its career. Neither Joshua nor Hezekiah, though they may justly be deemed Heaven's first favourites, though the condescending Deity propitiously bending his ear to the prayer of their supplications, added whole years to the life of the one, investing the other with full power to arrest and suspend the operations of nature, giving the sun at his command to stand still upon Mount Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, yet they could not so far prevail with their God, as to induce him to recal a single moment which had passed by.</P>
<P>If then, time is a good, which when gone is beyond redemption, utterly and altogether irretrievable, the wonder is, that we are so little attentive to its waste that in its regulations and distribution we economize so little! I have thought, that if parsimony is ever tolerated, it ought to be in the disposition of time, and that the penurious hand, when employed in appor∣tioning the moments, may with propriety be account∣ed under the direction of virtue. It is strange to hear from the mouth of one who murders above half the hours, by consigning them to oblivious sleep, a com∣plaint of the shortness of time, and yet nothing is more frequent. Six hours in four and twenty, devoted to sleep, when the constitution is naturally good, is said, by the most eminent physicians, to be fully adequate to every purpose of health. If we have accustomed ourselves, when the sun is upwards of fifteen hours above our horizon, to prostrate before the drowsy god, until the hour of eight in the morn∣ing, let us by perseverance acquire the habit of quitting our pillows at five, at a moment when the blushing face of nature is clothed in tranquillity; when every breeze seems commissioned to invigorate the mind; when the weary frame which the evening before sunk down languid, debilitated, and almost exhausted, is as it were renovated; when, aided by
<PB N="29" REF="034162_0028_0FFC5D59250DD700"/>
fancy, we might be induced to conceive ourselves again in the morning of our days; when every cir∣cumstance disposeth to the peaceful enjoyments of contemplation, and the most philanthropic sentiments are originated in the bosom: Let us, I say, resolutely and cheerfully embark in this <HI>speculation,</HI> and we shall find that three of the most delightful hours are every day gained; that twenty-one hours are cleared in the course of one week; and how many months may be thus added to a common life, let the expert arith∣metician calculate. It is certain that sleep is a figure of death, that while wrapt in its embraces, we are in <HI>effect</HI> as <HI>helpless,</HI> and in <HI>fact</HI> as <HI>unconscious</HI> of every thing which in reality passeth upon this globe, as the body which hath been for many years entombed; and as it is quite as possible to commit a debauch in sleeping as in eating or drinking, it must be acknowl∣edged as an undoubted truth, that every moment thus devoted, which is more than sufficient to restore the tired faculties, is worse than lost. But it is not enough that we become careful to enrich ourselves by an accumulation of hours, an exact attention to their appropriation being to the full as requisite. It is in vain that we have amassed much property, if we lavish it in a profuse or thoughtless manner. Order should be employed as the handmaid of time; she should mark, arrange and decorate every move∣ment; thus protecting from the inroads of confusion, which would ingulf even the longevity of an antedi∣luvian.</P>
<P>It would be pleasant to observe the contrast be∣tween a family, the females of which were properly methodical, and economical in their distributions and expenditures of time, and one accustomed to leave every thing to the moment of necessity, to conform to no regulations, but to crowd the affairs which ought to take rank, in the different divisions of the week, into some contingency for which they are totally unprepared: The one is the habitation of
<PB N="30" REF="034162_0029_0FFC2861D73EDDE0"/>
tranquillity; it is a well ordered community; it is a complicated machine, the component parts of which are so harmoniously organized, as to produce none but the most concordant sounds, to effectuate none but the most salutary and uniform purposes; in short, it is a terrestrial paradise, where dwells love and unity, attended by all the blessings of content∣ment. While the other,—but who can delineate the other? It is a restoration of the reign of chaos, and genuine pleasure is a stranger to its abode; and yet, perhaps, the lady paramounts of each family, are equally well meaning, good kind of women; although the want of a little perseverance, which would a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m at producing a laudable habit, presents this melan∣choly reverse.</P>
<P>I wish not, said Ernestus to Crastinatus, to entrust my only son to the fluctuating waves of the treacherous ocean; but, in my opinion, neither Charybdis nor Scyl∣la, though armed with all the terrors once attributed to them, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lf so fatal to a young fellow, as a mind unoccupied by laudable pursuits, and that pernicious habit of idly dissipating time, which hath dashed so many high raised hopes. Why do you not take him into your compting-house, replied Crastinatus, he will certainly find full employ there, for I declare for my own part, that though I constantly retain two clerks, I am yet notwithstanding, inexpressibly fatigued by the multiplicity of attentions which my business in∣volves. Well, I do not know how it is returned Ernestus; but I assure you, neighbour, upon my hon∣our, though I have not the smallest assistance, that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not for the amusement of reading, riding, visiting, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I could not possibly contrive to fill up time.</P>
<P>But the business of Crastinatus is more various, more extensive, and his avocations are more multi∣plied. Ernestus, it may be, moves in a more confin∣ed sphere. No such thing—the calls upon them are exactly similar, and the same line of conduct would b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proper to them both; to integrity they are equal∣ly
<PB N="31" REF="034162_0030_0FFC5D5659158240"/>
devoted, and equity in their dealings is alike the goal of their wishes.</P>
<P>But the close of every week states exactly the ac∣counts of Ernestus; the posting of his books was, from the first, the work of every day; as often as possible he passeth receipts; and when this desideratum cannot be obtained, so precisely is debt and credit announced, that the foot of every page presents the most unerring information; the whole amount of his <HI>possessions</HI> he knows; every farthing for which he is indebted is in legible characters expressed, and in a very short space of time, he can estimate to a pen∣ny, what he is <HI>really</HI> worth: no person demands of Ernestus a second time his dues, for he never <HI>hazards larger sums, than his capital can at any time command;</HI> this enableth him to wear the wreath of punctuality, and he supports, unimpeached, even by the tongue of slander, the character of an honest man. The happy effects of such a mode of procedure, are too obvious to be pointed out, and Ernestus <HI>feels</HI> them all.</P>
<P>The heart of Crastinatus is equally good, but irreso∣lution hath affixed its stamp upon his mind, and he hath not perseverance enough to break the force of habit; a demand upon Crastinatus for a settle∣ment, throws him into the utmost confusion; his ac∣counts have ran so long, that they involve a thousand intricacies; all hands are at work to investigate; to come at truth is difficult, if not impossible; and it is a wonder if a rupture is not the consequence. When Crastinatus hath paid the great debt of nature, his affairs will lay open to the inroads of fraud, his wid∣ow and his orphan children will be the sufferers, and the probability is, that an insolvency will take place. Whereas, had he—But it is time that I recollect myself; it may be thought that I encroach too far upon a department, which may be considered as already filled. Well then, having gleaned thus much, I will only add, that a late ingenious writer would have observed—Crastinatus "doth not work it right."</P>

<Q><L>But let us give the present times their due.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is scarce an observer in all the purlieus of contemplation, but must recollect, in some part or other of his life, to have met with spirited declamations upon the degeneracy of the times. O Tempora! O Mores! is an exclamation frequently in the mouths of those who inherit much, and who are, by the good and wholesome laws of their coun∣try, guaranteed the peaceable enjoyment of their am∣ple possessions. There is a set of people who can never see a tax-bill, or attend to the requisitions of government, without mutinously, if not treacherously, running the parallel between what they term the present exorbitant demands, and the moderate char∣ges of the British administration; and while they are blind to the emoluments of independence, they seem to forget that <HI>house keeping is of necessity more expensive than a residence in the dwelling of a parent or a master</HI> If the spirit of discontent was peculiar to these incon∣siderate cavillers, it would be well; but we are con∣cerned to find, that it pervades all orders of men, from the philosopher down to the veriest grumbler—from the priest to the cobler—from the aggrandized lawyer to his fleeced client—from the most enlight∣ened physician to his suffering patient—from the statesman to the beggar—and from the liberally en∣dowed and independent gentleman to the common day's labourer. In short, every description of peo∣ple are found crying out on the depravity of the times; and were we to give full credit to the testi∣mony of those, who, from age to age, have taken an unaccountable pleasure in <HI>depreciating the time being,</HI> we should be ready to conclude, that we must at length have arrived at the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of turpitude,
<PB N="33" REF="034162_0032_0FFC5D5353A95B10"/>
and have become adepts in every species of atrocious criminality. Yet the accusation proceeds from the lips of very respectable complainants, whose judg∣ment, in many respects, is hardly problematical, and to whose decisions we submit perhaps with too much docility.</P>
<P>In order to exalt the ancients, and to render them supreme in the scale of excellence, it is customary to level the moderns; and the fame of the one is appre∣ciated, in an exact ratio, as that of the other is under∣valued.</P>
<P>We are told much of the <HI>golden age;</HI> but the most careful investigator is at a loss at what period of the world to date its epoch; since, immediately upon the expulsion of Adam from the paradise which he had forfeited, the battery of hatred and malevolence was opened; grants were abroad in the earth, and nations no sooner existed, than they learned war.</P>
<P>The golden age, then, with all its splendid charac∣teristics, we are feign to consign to the region of fancy, denying it a being, but in the breath of poetic fiction, or the annals of imagination.</P>
<P>The superiority which we are so ready to award to the ancients, may be equally without any foundation in reality; and it is in my humble opinion probable, that their principal advantages were derived from their being first upon the stage of action. Methinks I see the blush of indignation tinge the face of the reader, and he is ready to execrate the Gleaner, for attempting to pluck from the venerable brow of an∣tiquity the smallest twig of fame. Yet, while I reverence a prejudice, which very possibly originates in the most laudable affections, I nevertheless reply—But let us give revolving time its due. Pray, my good Sir, or Madam, if a certain opulent possessor is endowed with vast dominions, in consequence of his eldership—am I, an honest Gleaner, to whom only a few barren tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> remain, or whose lot, perhaps, it is to examine with unwearied diligence every spot of
<PB N="34" REF="034162_0033_0FFC5D4D3A996F30"/>
the wide domain, if perchance I may glean the pit∣tance which affluence has overlooked—am I, for this, in a judgment of unimpassioned reason, to be the less regarded? or, what principle of equity, passing sen∣tence without a trial, will pronounce, that had I been placed precisely in the situation of the original occu∣pier, I might not have laid out my grounds to equal advantage, supporting a character to the full as dig∣nified, as consistent, and as becoming.</P>
<P>Man is ushered into being; he finds himself ex∣posed to all the vicissitudes with which the various seasons are replete; the wintery storms are abroad; hail, rain and snow possess a power essentially to afflict him; he burns beneath a torrid zone, or he freezes beneath a frigid; in short, every thing points out to him the necessity of a shelter, and accord∣ingly, he sinks the hollowed cavity, or he raises the thatched hut; with proper repairs, this homely dwel∣ling would answer full as well for his successor; but his son improves thereon, and every generation adds something, till at length the finished edifice becomes complete. Now, I would ask, is not every genera∣tion entitled to its quota of praise? and since the ori∣ginal inventor was urged merely by necessity, and performed no more than what the beaver and other animals have frequently done, may not the <HI>improver,</HI> who had not this incitement, come in for his full share?</P>
<P>Surely the annals of antiquity record instances of barbarism in persons, when the manners were deemed highly polished, which would shock the present feel∣ings of the most illiterate. Let us take a view of the Athenians, at an era when a state of great refine∣ment was attributed to them, when they were, it is said, an intelligent and a learned people; let us take a seat in their theatre; let us listen while they, al∣most unanimously, applaud the coarse ribaldry of an Aristophanes, while they complacently attend the degradation of virtue, encouraging a rude and indel∣icate

buffoon to hold up a Socrates as a fit subject for the ridicule of the people!</P>
<P>But the ancients made many discoveries—very true—and is not the reason obvious? <HI>There was much to discover;</HI> moreover, necessity, as hath been before hinted, is an excellent stimulus to promptitude; yet, in some respects, it would seem that they were vastly deficient in ingenuity: For example; through re∣volving centuries they remained ignorant of the art of printing, by which they might so eligibly have transmitted to us their elaborate productions, although they could not set a foot upon the <HI>yielding</HI> earth, with∣out producing an <HI>impression</HI> sufficient to suggest to them so valuable an idea.</P>
<P>The education of a modern student is by no means finished, without an extensive acquaintance with the history, learning, manners and customs of the an∣cients; the best part of his life is therefore devoted to acquire this knowledge, and when thus accom∣plished, he finds that the age of fancy is well near fled, and that to him the door of originality seems effectually barred. The student of antiquity was not thus encumbered; from his predecessors he had little to reap, and the volume of nature was opened before him; yet his acquirements were often superficial, while the deepest researches, with their consequent improvements, were reserved for later ages.</P>
<P>How dreadful are the preparations for war, which the page of antiquity recounts! their terrific habili∣ments; their deathful chariots; their elephants, with all the shocking apparatus! scarcely are they exceed∣ed by the arrangements of an American savage, and hardly are the tortures which he meditates, more fearfully tremendous. What scenes of blood and de∣vastation doth the annals of ancient history exhibit! how frequently are the feelings of humanity pierced to the very soul! what fratricide! what parricide! while instances are not wanting of <HI>mothers,</HI> who wade to empire through the blood of those children, in

whose vital stream they had, with remorseless cruelty, imbrued their hands; sons incestuously pollute a fa∣ther's bed; and fathers, most unnaturally, snatch to their libidinous embraces the trembling female to whom they gave existence!</P>
<P>The government of the ancients, whether demo∣cratical, aristocratical, monarchical, simple or mixed; all these, if examined by the eye of impartiality, the boasted wisdom of their legislators, yielding in many respects to modern improvements, will, if I mistake not, by exactly striking the balance, prove the arrange∣ments of Deity to be equal, and manifest him distrib∣uting with a paternal hand, to every age their exact proportion of talents, endowing every division of time, with men possessing understandings alike capable of profiting by the circumstances in which they were involved. With regard to the religion of the an∣cients, I suppose it will be granted, that it was a heap of absurdities; that it consisted of contradictions, im∣purities, and mysteries; the character of their very deities are lewd and otherwise immoral; with the ri∣valship and content on of their gods we are disgusted; and even the history of their Jupiter is replete with crimes, that abundantly justify the ill humour of his Juno, that would have warranted the most coercive proceed∣ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against him, for which he merited condign pun∣ishment, and which would have induced us wholly to acquit his brothers, Pluto and Neptune, (their own enormities notwithstanding) if they had, uniting their powers, precipitated him from his Olympian height, and confined him in adamantine chains to the Sty∣gian flood, or the Tartarean gulph.</P>
<P>But to resume the language of reason; this fond predilection for, and preference of the ancients, is, in reality, altogether unaccountable; it is a singular trait in the history of mankind, since, in every other instance, the persons, places and things, with which we have associated, and to which we are accustomed, possess a charm, the blandishments of which we find
<PB N="37" REF="034162_0036_0FFC5D45FACA9538"/>
it impossible to escape: With what ardour do we re∣member the scenes of our youth! upon the tablets of our breasts how indelibly is the love of the place of our nativity engraved! what noble enthusiasm fires the patriotic mind, when the interests of his country are at stake, and how gladly would the man of filial integrity, sacrifice his fairest hours, to advance the importance of his parent soil! More than one instance hath occurred of the most dignified characters, who have, from circumstances, been compelled to a state of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>shment, breathing out their last wishes, that their remains might be conveyed to the much loved spot, there to mingle with the dust, upon the surface of which they first drew their vital breath. Indeed this attachment to country is astonishing, and not sel∣dom doth it betray the mind into prejudices and con∣clusions, extravagant and unjust. But one of the most pleasing effects of this local affection is, that gen∣uine transport which so agreeably surprises the soul, upon unexpectedly meeting, in a distant land, an ac∣quaintance, a townsman, or even a subject of the same government; perhaps in the streets of our own dis∣trict, we should have passed him with the utmost indifference; but absence still more endears to us every natural connexion; reflection meliorates our ideas; circumstances in themselves of little or no consequence, acquire a tender kind of importance; recollection presents the scenes of home-felt enjoy∣ment: and though, probably, they were undistin∣guished by any prominent feature, by any particular refinement, or impressive softness, yet, registered in the store-house of memory, they rise up dignified and respectable claimants, they are cherished with aug∣menting regard, they point us to anticipated good; and the traveller, who would once have been viewed as a stranger, standing as a memento, is embraced with the ardour of friendship.</P>
<P>But quitting a field, in which the Gleaner had not intended at this time to have wandered, I proceed to say, that though, as it is an article of my creed, that
<PB N="38" REF="034162_0037_0FFC5D4197104C00"/>
all things are in a state of progression, I cannot re∣gard the present, <HI>as the best of all possible times;</HI> yet I do conceive, that at no period since the lapse of Adam, was the world in so high a state of improvement, as it is at this very instant; it is less malevolent, and more philanthropic; it is less barbarous, and more civil∣ized; it is less vicious, and more moral; it is less rude; it evinceth an increasing share of urbanity; in short, the augmentation of its virtues is rapid, and the probability is, as progressive movements preclude a retrograde idea, that having rounded the circle, it will finally regain the point from whence it com∣menced its career.</P>
<P>Let us take a view of the present order and decen∣cy observed in society; how superior is it even to the patriarchal age: Let us attend the rise, the progress, and the termination of the hostilities of adverse na∣tions; how multiplied are their precautions; how accumulated their manifestoes; what strict justice, or at least the semblance thereof, are the contending parties obliged to exercise; with what regularity is the whole process conducted; how great is the faith and confidence of treaties; what odium attends the infringement thereof; with what cordiality, when the sword is sheathed, do the battling heroes embrace! resentments immediately subside, and the captured and the wounded become the objects of generous and instantaneous attention; hospitals, refreshments, and a variety of solaces are prepared, and it is the pride of the foe, that the defeated warrior should receive every alleviation, of which the circumstances of his situation are susceptible. By these means so abun∣dantly are the calamities of war softened, that mili∣tary engagements, comparatively speaking, assume the form of an amicable intercourse.</P>
<P>The present age is justly styled the period of revo∣lutions; let us just glance at the most prominent events. The struggles of the French nation have been, and still continue, truly interesting; the rights of man are placed in a conspicuous view; many glo∣rious

exertions have been made; they are rapidly posting on to the desired goal: and their King, if he possesseth that genius, that philanthropy, and that pa∣triotic glow, which the sentiments he hath avowed, and many corroborating testimonies incline us to at∣tribute to him, while his brow is encircled with the brightening gem of real worth, will doubtless find himself embosomed in that tranquillity which con∣scious rectitude creates, and which all the pageantry of false greatness could never have bestowed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Gleaner regrets, that the deplorable catastrophe, which, since the production of the above essay, closed the vir∣tuous life of a Prince, acknowledged amiable, hath furnished so striking a proof of the ferocity of the present times.</NOTE> But, passing on, we behold another crowned head, volun∣tarily, without a single hint from his subjects, divest∣ing himself of every vestige of despotism, augustly making the good of his people the prime movement of his actions, and with an ardent and a generous enthusiasm, which will transmit his name with eter∣nal honour to the latest posterity, hailing upon equal ground his fellow-men; restoring to the body of the people their privileges and immunities, and once more investing them with their native and inherent rights. If we turn our eyes toward our own country, we shall acknowledge that a few years have produced the most astonishing effects: Unnatural and inadmis∣sible claims have been made; they have been investi∣gated; they have been weighed in the balance, and they have been found wanting. The genius of lib∣erty, invigorated in this younger world, hath arrayed itself for the battle; it hath gone forth; it hath ori∣ginated opposition; its banner have been displayed: it hath enlisted its worthies; the struggle hath been arduous, but the event hath crowned us with success; over veteran foes we have been victorious; independ∣ence claps her wings; peace is restored; govern∣ments are formed: public faith established; and we bid fair to become a great and a happy people. Yes, governments are formed; and what hath hitherto
<PB N="40" REF="034162_0039_0FFC5D3D1BA506C0"/>
been deemed a solecism in politics, now becomes, to the eye of experience, a palpable reality. We are free, sovereign, and independent States, and yet we are amenable to the Federal Head. Governments within governments exist; their component parts are adequate to the purposes of jurisdiction; they are members of the national government; they are united, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it were, by a sympathetic thread, symmetry, and its concomitant harmony, presides, and federalism is the talisman of their importance. Perhaps the prin∣ciples of concentration are not susceptible of close investigation like the immortal spark by which we are animated, it takes the alarm, and flies off, when we would apply to its vital parts the instrument of dissection. Yet to the captious reasoner, the answer is as ready, as to the sophist, who asserted the nonexist∣ence of motion, merely because he could not move in the place where he was, and it was impossible he could move where he was not; but we cannot admit his ergo, for experience proclaims that we absolutely do move, and it is a fact, that these governments, simple and complex, have, in reality, an energetic and respectable being. Thus, in this instance, we have refined upon the plans of our ancestors, and we are happily reaping the genial fruits of a wife and well concerted system. Our admirable Constitution unites the advantages which are attributed to a monarchical government, to an oligarchy, and a de∣mocracy; since sufficient power is lodged in the hands of the Chief Magistrate, to benefit the people; since an order of nobility is instituted, an order, to which all our worthies may pretend—<HI>the order of Virtue</HI>—which, in truth, is alone ennobling; and since the career being open to all, we may with democratical equality pursue the splendid prize.</P>
<P>It is with glad complacency we mark the honours which encircle the head of our immortal Chief; we congratulate our countrymen, that they have, to the utmost of their power, with becoming unanimity agreed to reward his patriotic worth; that, investing
<PB N="41" REF="034162_0040_0FFC5D3B5F6E9D98"/>
him with due authority, they have reposed in his revered bosom the highest confidence; that, superior to the narrow politics of the Athenians (the splendour of his character notwithstanding) they prepare no ostra∣cism for his virtues; but that, on the contrary, with a glow of superior pleasure, they listen while the tongue of sapient age expatiates upon his justice, his disinterestedness, and his paternal attachment to his country; that they delight to hear the voice of lisping innocence pronounce his venerable name; that they rejoice in his echoing fame; and that his praises vibrate sweetly upon their finest and most rational feelings.</P>
<P>Nor, though that fell despoiler, slander, hath dared to infix its envenomed tooth in the fair and consist∣ent character of our illustrious Vice-President, will the public mind submit to the deception which au∣dacious accusation would presume to fabricate; it will not suffer a man, who would have conferred honour on any country in which he had happened to be born; who adorns every department which he is called to fill, from the tender domestic scene, to the highest offices of state, with elegance and propriety, with the most undeviating firmness, and unblemished integrity; whose interesting and highly finished litera∣ry productions will transmit his name to ages yet un∣born; when the invidious caviller, and the writer of this essay, will, it is probable, be whelmed in the gulph of oblivion;—the public mind, I say, will not suffer such a man to sink; they will not suffer the opaque cloud, which for a moment may have shaded the disk of so bright a luminary, long to intercept its radiance; no, it will judiciously decide, and rising su∣perior to prejudice, it will still confer on him its un∣suspecting confidence.</P>
<P>Mentioning the Vice-President, I am reminded of a tour I lately made through a neighbouring State, when falling into company with a leading man in the government, he expressed himself with a considera∣ble degree of acrimony of that gentleman; and upon
<PB N="42" REF="034162_0041_0FFC5D34DC18D730"/>
my gravely demanding in what he was culpable, the disaffected person, in so many words, replied, that he did not like him; that he believed him to be haughty and unyielding; that in his progress through that State, he, the objector, had been one of a number who had been solicitous to do him all the honour in their power: that they assembled in large companies, col∣lected the militia, rung the bells, &amp;c. &amp;c. but that Mr. Adams contrived, by some means or other, to e∣lude their wishes, for he had absolutely, in defiance of all this homage which was prepared for him, pass∣ed unmindful on, incog. as it were, refusing in fact every acknowledgment of their allegiance. Such, and so enormous, are the pretended misdemeanours of the Vice-President; yet, nevertheless, I persuade myself that the assemblage of virtues which brighten his character, will at length flash conviction upon ev∣ery eye, and that the <HI>many</HI> will know to distinguish, and to value that noble independence of spirit, that inborn worth, and intrinsic greatness, which, avoid∣ing an ostentatious display of grandeur, contents it∣self with innate consciousness of real elevation.</P>
<P>But, to the most interesting and important partic∣ular, in which the present times may justly boast their superiority over former ages, we have yet to attend. Religion looks abroad with all her native honours thick about her; the days of massacre; the bloody, the execrable administration of a Mary; the affright∣ed hours which witnessed the horrid transaction upon the eve of St. Bartholomew; the Irish persecutions, and succeeding murders; the government, or rather mortal tyranny of James, with the more recent, though not less fatal American bigotry; all those days are now gone past, and I supplicate the Saviour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they may no more return: Religion, as I said, now descends among us, and she is cloathed in all her native loveliness. On her head she wears a wreath, entwined by the fingers of clemency; virtu∣ous indulgence is expressed in every feature of her face; her eye beams tenderness, and her bosom is the seat
<PB N="43" REF="034162_0042_0FFC5D33584E1F48"/>
of compassion: the unsullied whiteness of her flowing garments denotes the purity and uprightness of her laws; beauteous and prepossessing is her countenance; benign is her sway; reason and humanity are her daughters; and while rectitude is the moral of her life, she throws over her faulty children the mantle of for∣bearance. Under her correcting auspices, what won∣ders are at this present exhibiting in the earth! her well aimed shafts have pierced the very vitals of bigot∣ry, liberality of sentiment is established, a Calvinistical church is permitted almost in the heart of the Papal dominions, it is consecrated with much solemnity; magistrates of all descriptions, with the clergy of the Roman Lutheran, and Calvinistical persuasion, join in the <HI>te deum,</HI> and, the most God honouring effects are produced. But it is not at Stratsburg alone that the triumphs of true religion are manifested; her divine and elucidating powers seem penetrating into every corner of the globe, while in our own country, her progress is remarkably and gloriously rapid. The thackles of superstition are thrown off, ignorance and bigotry give way; the benign agency of tolera∣tion is established, and a spirit of equality, and of free inquiry, is abroad. Parents, enlightened parents, at this day are not solicitous to implant in the tender minds of their offspring the seeds of prejudice, or en∣thusiastic zeal; they judge it sufficient if they can in∣struct their children in the nature of their moral du∣ties, what they owe to society, and to themselves; if they can give them an early and deep impression of their dependence on, and their obligations to, a cre∣ating and a paternal God; if they can sketch for them the outlines of the fall, and the restoration, pointing to Jesus as the Redeemer of men; if they can teach them to view their fellow mortals as de∣scending from the same original; if they can, by degrees, accustom them to regard <HI>this world as the path through which they are to shape their course to their native skies;</HI> these leading points, if they can accom∣plish, they are therewith content, wisely leaving the

election of a particular sect of Christians, with which to coalesce their sentiments, with all the thorny road of disputation, to the matured growth of fully in∣formed reason.</P>

<P>"GOD tempers the wind to the shorn lamb."—Sterne certainly possessed the happy art of cloathing his ideas in figures which pointed them to the heart of his reader. Not seldom doth the humid eye of sensibility confess that the writings of that exquisite sentimentalist abound with flowers of the fairest growth, and though the delicate mind is too often lacerated by the thorns, which in some instances deform his high-wrought scenes, yet so sweet is the fragrance of the rose, that the softest hand is reached forth to pluck it—yea, even at the risk of being deep∣ly pierced by the formidable points which surround it. But, however rich his eccentric pages may be, (and I have not the smallest objection to allowing them their full value) they produce not, I take upon me to pronounce, a more strikingly comprehensive passage, than that which I have selected above—"But, God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb."—It is, methinks, a sentence containing a system in it∣self;
<PB N="45" REF="034162_0044_0FFC5D2D37BDDDF0"/>
and it is replete with the quintessence of moral∣ity, religion and divinity—It is replete with moral∣ity, for example is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all hands allowed to be more influential than precept; and it exhibits a view of the Lord of Universal Nature, bestowing such minute re∣gards, upon the feelings of the family which his om∣nific word had commanded into being, as to be at∣tentive even to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nts of the bleating innocent, who, shorn of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> covering, stands in need of the vernal zephyr which is then commissioned to move gently over the warm surface of his disrobed body.—Here, I say, is a rich lesson of morality; for if God thus tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, are we not hence taught to respect much more the feelings of our fellow men—to regard as sacred the relative du∣ties of life, and to become reverentially observant of those calls which, upon the utmost efforts of hu∣manity, a social intercourse with mankind is so fre∣quently making. It is, in an especial manner, replete with religion; for an assurance that God tempereth the wind to the shorn lamb, naturally originates in the bosom the most unwavering faith; we cannot but confide in the Sovereign Power which is thus benign∣ly exercised: our hearts become the seat of acquies∣cent tranquillity; the altars of unwavering affiance are erected there, cheerfully we sacrifice thereon; before the surrounding Deity we devoutly prostrate, worshipping with all adoration the Father of eter∣nity, the God of the spirits of all flesh.—It is replete with divinity; for its excellence can hardly be sur∣passed; it whispereth to the care-worn mind the genial voice of consolation; it comforteth, it erecteth the superstructure of its peace upon the only solid and rational foundation; upon a reliance on the paternal goodness of the Sire of angels and of men, and thus pointing directly to heaven; thus by its animating powers soothing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it is undoubtedly the lan∣guage of the Spirit of truth; it indisputably partak∣eth of the divine nature. "But, God tempereth the wind to the shorn lamb."—Poor Maria, no wonder
<PB N="46" REF="034162_0045_0FFC5D2908E5F058"/>
that thy desolated bosom disdained every mitigating consideration, not immediately derived from that om∣nipotent Being, who, having "twice bruised thee," could alone assuage thy lacerating sorrows. Doubt∣less it was the angel of compassion, who, breathing over the chaos of thy deranged ideas, illumined them by that irradiating light, which shall one day make glad the whole creation of God. But not to Maria only, is the all healing hand of divine benigni∣ty even now extended. To the sons and daughters of humanity, the winds of heaven are still attempered, and the Source of all intelligence regards with an equal eye the creatures whom he hath made: The destitute orphan, who trembles on the threshold of an arraigning, a censuring, and an unpitying world; the childless parent, who once beheld a lovely group of sons and daughters; the widowed fair one, whose blasted hopes, and whose short withering joys seem to condemn her to unceasing tears; the once happy hus∣band, bending over the untimely grave of a beloved wife; the brother, the sister, the friend, torn from the embraces of the object whom they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld most dear; these have all been enabled experimentally to say, "But, God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb." The angel, Fortitude, armed with unyielding firm∣ness, issues from the right hand of the Most High; to this lower world she shapeth her course; in the garments of inflexibility she is cloathed, and always true of her path, while she wears upon her brow the wreath of rectitude, she turneth neither to the right nor to the left; perseveringly she passeth on; she tak∣eth possession of the mind, and she fashioneth it to her purpose; with the genuine spirit of heroism she en∣doweth it, and pointing it to an elysium of future bliss, she investeth it with superiority over the ills of time: Resignation and acquiescence are in her train; for, fix∣ing her eye upon one grand object, she bends accom∣modating, and with becoming reverence to the will of Him from whom originates every good. Thus, in sickness and in death, she fortifies, supports, and
<PB N="47" REF="034162_0046_0FFC5D2607CE2B40"/>
strengthens the mind, enabling the man piously to ex∣claim, "But, God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb." I said, in sickness; and a reflection upon this particular calamity, bringing me back from my pres∣ent ramble, suggests to the <HI>Gleaner</HI> a question—Whether it may not be well to account for his being induced thus to wander, in a field where, the soil hav∣ing been so often trod, he could expect to glean so little? And with the association of ideas perhaps every ob∣server, though not absolutely a Locke, is more or less acquainted.</P>
<P>Patrolling one superbly mild evening, in the course of the last visibility of the moon, the streets of the me∣tropolis of the State of Massachusetts, I felt a very strong inclination to step for a little space into the cof∣fee-house; yielding to the impulse of the moment, I entered with as little observation as possible, and, seating myself in one of the open apartments, I listened to a very warm dispute which was carried on by a trio, consisting of a merchant of great note, a military officer of some eminence, and a sea com∣mander. The skill and abilities of the Boston phy∣sicians was their subject, and they seemed to discuss and compare their several qualifications with much vehemence. Lloyd. Danforth, Warren, &amp;c. &amp;c. all passed in review before them. People in general are as much attached to the Esculapius of their choice, as to the religion of their election; and our combatants shewed themselves in earnest by disputing every inch of ground, yielding no point, and mingling at length in their retorts and rejoinders no small proportion of acrimony. It is true, that upon the merits of the gentlemen in question, they might be inadequate to decide; but they proved themselves, however, capable of arguing, and they seemed in no sort conscious of insufficiency. After summing up the evidences which had been produced upon the tapis, the merchant gravely and peremptorily insisted that the <HI>balance</HI> was entirely in favour of Lloyd; the military gentleman swore, and he confirmed his
<PB N="48" REF="034162_0047_0FFC5D24711DEDC8"/>
award by many oaths, that Danforth ought to be created <HI>general<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI> of the college of physicians; while the sea captain, who appeared to be a mild man, closed the debate by protesting, that he had <HI>boarded them all three, without being all to obtain a market for any part of that cargo of complaints, with which his shattered bark had been so long laden.</HI> The subject thus continuing a moot point, I was disposing myself to retire, when the sea captain, putting him∣self in the attitude of a narrator, again arrested my attention. "You know, gentlemen," said the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Neptune, <Q>that I am moored, when at home, in a harbour considerably distant from this town; and I declare to you, upon the honour of a sailor, that we have now laid up in our port, a little snug honest fellow, who makes the prettiest way imaginable; and who, if he continued to carry sail upon the ocean on which he hath embarked, with as much undaunted boldness, and to steer as safely as he hath hitherto done, will stand as fair a chance to enter the desired haven, and to hoist his flag upon the highest eminence of fame, as the most skilful navi∣gator of them all; and that he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acquainted with every rope in the ship, I will, if you please, produce a reckoning, that shall fully evidence.</Q> The cap∣tain proceeded; but not being sufficiently versed in his vocabulary, to produce his account verbatim, I shall take leave to render his deposition in my own manner. It seems, in a small village in the neigh∣bourhood of the residence of the captain, a poor man hath lately been called to pass through all the stages immediately preceding death, of what is termed a regular decline, or consumption; he was not more than twenty-seven years of age, when he was seized with the pain in the side, the breast, hectic sever, suppuration of the lungs, cough, purulent expectora∣tion, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which train of dreadful symptoms, in their gradual and distressing order, successively took place. At length th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hour of his dissolution was supposed at hand; his father was no more; and
<PB N="49" REF="034162_0048_0FFC5D22EEC6F1F0"/>
he was the son of a widowed mother. Repeatedly the matron, not possessing strength of mind enough to witness the dying agonies of him, on whom she had placed her maternal hopes, had quitted his apart∣ment, yielding him to the care of those who were engaged to perform for him the last offices. But while there is life, a latent hope will play about the heart: The villagers insisted that the captain's little snug honest fellow should be called in. The young doctor, who hath hardly completed his twenty-third year, approached; he examined, and he drew his conclusions; one only experiment remained, it was painfully hazardous, and its effects extremely preca∣rious; but <HI>cert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and speedy death was the only alter∣native.</HI> In the breast of the young man, though having been repeatedly captured in the course of the late war, suffering much in guard-ships and prisons—though having been so often afflicted by the infirmi∣ties of a debilitated constitution—he had deeply tasted of the bitter cup of calamity; yet in his breast a love of existence still predominated, and when he consented to an operation, which it is conceived hath been seldom performed in our country, and was certainly a novel event in the village of B—, he was be∣lieved to be the drowning man grasping at a straw. The patient, however, witnessed, unappalled, the dreadful preparations. The bedstead was planked, the matrass was nailed thereto, and he, with his face covered, was placed thereon. In the country, upon any extraordinary occasion, the whole village seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but one family; no wonder then, that at such a period the apartment of the emaciated sick man was much thronged; a number stood over him; if he struggled, they were to confine him, and their hands were lifted up for that purpose; for a moment he threw the handkerchief from his face—he beheld the formidable apparatus—the surrounding visages, which resembled his, who drew Priam's curtains at the dead of night, and would have told him half his Troy was burnt—he breathed short; he gasped—stop, Sir—one sigh—

it is over—I am myself again—and you may pro∣ceed. The muscles between the fourth and fifth ribs, an inch nearer to the centre of the breast, then the back bone, were cut through; the pleura was pierc∣ed; and, to enlarge the aperture into the cavity of the breast, the proper instruments were introduced; two fingers of the operator were then insinuated, and, passing through the wound, were pressed on the ex∣ternal surface of the diseased lobe, when instantly the seat of the vomica, was by its tremulation discovered; it was at this period, that some person, to whom years had given an advantage over our physician, vehe∣mently exclaimed, Doctor, we beg that you would proceed no farther! Is it not a wonder that terror at the sound of this imprudent interposition, cut not the slender thread of the patient's life? The operator, however, made sure of success, warmly replied, "By heaven, I will not now be stopped;" when, penetrating the investing membrane of the right lobe, into the abscess, and dilating it three quarters of an inch, its contents, blood and purulent matter, to the quantity of a pint, were immediately discharged; the conse∣quences of this operation have been most happy, the patient, from not being able to repose for a single moment upon either side, now stretches himself at his ease, and slumbers sweetly upon his bed; his cough, night sweats, sore mouth, and swelled feet are no more; from extreme debility, he is sufficiently strong to walk abroad, and he eats, drinks, and digests, perfectly well. What a transition!—he is regarded as one raised from the dead; while every person admires the cool, courageous, and determined resolution, with which he submitted to so fearful an experiment. He is of the lowest grade of industrious poor; the powers of his mind were never remarkable; his life had contained no striking exertions; he had seemed only in the common way to yield to the necessity which his misfortunes had created—had any one, in the morning of his existence, officiously presented him a picture of the ills which he was to endure,
<PB N="51" REF="034162_0050_0FFC5D1A5D06ADE8"/>
doubtless he would have started with horror from the view. Is it not surprising that he did not thus argue: <Q>My physician is a young man; older practitioners have never once suggested so hazard∣ous an expedient; it is an unheard of operation; shall I yield this emaciated body to an enterprizing genius, who possibly is only seeking his own emol∣ument in the experiment which he is solicitous to make?</Q> To the reflections of imbecility, I say, such arguments might naturally have presented themselves; but the mind of this poor, emaciated, illiterate sufferer, was intuitively, it should seem, en∣dowed with fortitude; suddenly he is converted into a philosopher; he reasons justly, and with sedate composure he meets his fate. What shall we say? we can only repeat, that, in deed and in truth, "God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb."</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT possessing merit sufficient to claim, in my own character, even the smallest niche, in that very useful and respectable repository in which you, by repeatedly appearing, have, I presume, obtained a considerable interest, I take leave, through your means, to introduce to the gentlemen Editors, a pro∣posal, which, if they think proper to lay before the public, may possibly be attended with the most agree∣able consequences. The idea, which to embody and effectuate, I would not only relinquish whole years of my existence, but I would absolutely be contented to live and die in obscurity, originated in an hour, which having appropriated to some choice spirits, I passed convivially over a bottle; we were not, however, bacchanalians, and our wine but served to meliorate and give an edge to our reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="034162_0051_0FFC5D189F8ABCD0"/>
Our subjects were multifarious, and with the ut∣most freedom we arraigned, tried, and condemned. Among other matters of speculation which we had taken it upon us liberally to analyze and critically to scan, the cause of the little encouragement which is generally throughout the world, and especially in our own country, given to genius, we carefully en∣deavoured to investigate; but for this absurdity, it was in vain that we assayed rationally to account; and we were reduced to the necessity of lamenting a fact, the sources of which, our utmost researches could not penetrate. The disappointments of a Butler, the melancholy fate of an Otway, with a long train of et-ceteras, we could not review, without pathetically deploring; and so far were we from conceiving that the taste of the present times was in any degree refined, that one of our party gave it as his decided opinion, that if Pope, Addison and Swift flourished in America, their merit would be almost entirely disregarded, and that there would scarce be found a single wight, who would acknowledge their superior claims. From regretting, we naturally proceeded to devising the ways and means, and our pericraniums were fruitful in expedients to remedy an evil which we regarded as a real blot upon the rising fame of this new world. After many pro's and con's, it was unanimously agreed among us, (and I do assure you there was in our junto many respectable persons) that it would be a most happy arrangement, if the consti∣tution of the United States of America would admit an additional article, providing for the establishment of <HI>real genius,</HI> whether it be found in the male or female world. It is not seldom the case, that, to answer the pressing wants of life, the efforts of the mind are so wholly engrossed, that the operations of genius are suspended, if not wholly blasted, and the door to intellectual fame is thus of necessity barred. Against this inconvenience, in its utmost latitude, our plan went to the providing. Congress should appoint persons, duly qualified to examine every
<PB N="53" REF="034162_0052_0FFC5D11DA37CAC0"/>
literary pretender, and by this means, while the road would be open to all, only <HI>real worth</HI> would receive the palm. To obviate the necessity of every pecu∣niary attention, out of the Treasury of the United States, pensions, competent to the decencies of life, according to the wants and degrees of merit which the candidates possessed, should be decreed, and reg∣ularly paid; and to preclude every reasonable objec∣tion, the <HI>sinecure</HI> should be continued (except in cases of natural and absolute decay) no longer than while the beneficed remained, to the utmost of his or her power, in the full exercise of those talents which procured from the liberality of government so honorary a distinction.</P>
<P>If this scheme, or rudiments of a scheme, might serve as a hint, to be wrought into form by the legis∣lators of the Union, the probability is, that the Muse, in such regulations of State, would not be called to mourn the <Q><HI>chilling blasts of penury; the genial current of the soul would no longer be frozen;</HI></Q> the fostering ray of prosperity, would lend to the <HI>real gem</HI> its beautifying splendour; <Q><HI>upon the desert air the flower would not then waste its sweetness,</HI></Q> but borne on the wing of the more propitious zephyr, taste would acknowledge, and fame disseminate its fragrance: "<HI>Knowledge would un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old her ample page,</HI>" and the child of nature <Q><HI>would wake to ecstacy the living lyre—the village Hampdens, with dauntless spirits, would arise, and a mute inglorious Milton would no more be found.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Not well versed in the history of mankind, I am ignorant if any plan similar to the one proposed, hath ever yet, by any government, been adopted; but I think its utility can hardly be deemed problem∣atical, and if the sons of genius, in this Columbian world, were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> secured from the fear of want, the goal of eminence being thrown open before them, to the highest grades of excellence they might aspire, and the probability is, that, commencing with youth∣ful ardour the great career, they would, in their various pursuits, rival the brightest names.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEING necessitated, in the course of my business, to make frequent visits to our metropolis; and bearing about me, neither in my person, or habili∣ments, any distinguishing mark, I have the advantage of mixing unnoticed, in places of general resort, with people of various descriptions, and not seldom of im∣portant characters. It was in one of my late excur∣sions, that I found myself at a table where the guests took their seats with that freedom which is so eligible, and which is always tolerated in a public house. After playing their parts, like men who perfectly well understood themselves, swallowing a sufficient quantity of ham and chicken, and liberally moistening the clay with the juice of the apple, they imagined themselves duly qualified to sit as judges of literary merit; for my own part, I am obliged to confess, that in regard to the gifts requisite in conversation, nature hath been unto me a perfect niggard, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possess not, in orally delivering my ideas, the smallest degree of facility. Intrenching myself, therefore, in my natural taciturnity, as I had never before had the honour of meeting an individual of whom our party consisted; with the utmost <HI>sang <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> I wrapped myself about, determining to indulge myself, by following the prevalent bent of my dispo∣sition, which is invariably assigning me the part of a hearer.</P>
<P>I was amazed to find with how little accuracy, and with what arrogant freedom, their dogmatizing
<PB N="55" REF="034162_0054_0FFC5D0ED3B82820"/>
decisions were, for the most part, made; and I felt a kind of horror at the mangling of names, which I had accustomed myself to consider in the most respectable point of view. From questioning the correctness and the delicacy of Addison, the wit of Swift, and the poetical merit of Pope, they sum∣moned before their imperious tribunal, the candidates for fame, which, in this younger world, distinguish the present day: Trumbull, Barlow, Humphreys, Warren, Morton, Belknap, &amp;c. &amp;c.—these all passed in review before them; and as they seemed determined to set no bounds to their invidious censures, their observations were of course equally destitute of justice and of candour. From these luminous bodies in the hemisphere of literature, descending in their career, they fell pell-mell upon the poor Gleaner. He was regarded as free plunder, serving as a mark at which to point their keenest shafts of satire; he was <HI>any body, every body,</HI> or <HI>nobody.</HI> One while he was certainly a <HI>Parson,</HI> for, in his last number, throwing off the mask, he had positively sermonized throughout; it was true he had taken his text from a brother chip; but what of that? his speech betrayed him. A second gravely declared, that he was credibly informed, the Gleaner was, at this present, a student in Harvard College; and indeed, (he added) it is <HI>evident, that he needs instruction.</HI> Here a loud laugh interrupted, for a moment, the progress of their critical and judicious remarks; when a young barrister, taking up the matter, for the sake of the argument, just to exercise his talents, professionally pronounced, that most assuredly the gentleman who spoke last had been grossly imposed upon, in the plea of vesting the prop∣erty under consideration; for that the Gleaner cer∣tainly bore strong marks of genius▪ that, to his knowl∣edge, it was the production of a Connecticut p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and it was well known that Connecticut was the land of essayists. A magisterial voice now interfered—Pshaw, pshaw, brother litigant, I say you are wrong, absolutely wrong; for if we except the first number of
<PB N="56" REF="034162_0055_0FFC5D0B034CA678"/>
the Gleaner, there is not to be found, in that writer, a single sentence of sheer wit. From the first number, indeed, I encouraged a hope of originality, of a spe∣cies of entertainment, not every day to be met with; but that, it should seem, was a forced matter, a mere hot-bed production, a spark struck from a flint, rather than the offspring of that pure, celestial and immor∣tal fire, which, like its ethereal source, can never be extinguished, and which, ever genuine, glowing, and animated, is with propriety hailed by that dignify∣ing appellation—true genius. But the Gleaner, O shocking! in his Margaretta, indeed, I took an inter∣est, but he just p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt her upon us, and very soon run∣ning himself out there, whip, in a moment, she was gone. Take my word for it, Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, (and he shook his head with great sagacity) the Gleaner is not worth our attention; he is poor, despicably poor—low, pitifully low; and I hesitate not to pro∣nounce him a mere trite, common-place observer. A middle-aged gentleman, who sat at the bottom of the table, and who had been, till then, silent, actu∣ated, as I conceive, by a kind of sympathy, being himself probably a supplicant at the shrine of fame, now joined in the conversation, by candidly suggest∣ing, that it did not appear the Gleaner had laid any claim to extraordinary talents; that he had very early renounced the vain hopes by which he had been inflated; that if every writer could not reach the eminence of a Boyle, a Locke, or a Newton, yet those who were contented with the subordination of their several departments, were entitled to their quota of praise; that if the observations of the Gleaner were trite, he was but a Gleaner, and the modesty of his pretensions entitled him to the full exercise of candor. But your Honor, (continued the good-natured gentleman) was interested in his Margaretta; now I think it very possible that Miss Melworth may again make her appearance, and it is my opinion, that the Gleaner withholds her now, not altogether from poverty of genius, but from the fear of giving
<PB N="57" REF="034162_0056_0FFC5D06A39C7868"/>
to his productions the air of a novel—(I could hardly forbear taking my advocate in my arms)—and you know, Gentlemen, in what a frivolous point of view, the novelist, at this present, stands. It is painful to sink, and who would wish to debase the essayest (for so it would be esteemed) into a mere annalist of brilliant fictions; yet, for my own part, I am free to own, that I class this species of writing in the very highest grade of excellence; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is true that the best things may be made subservient to the worst of pur∣poses, and the pen, seized by the singers of imagina∣tion, hath not seldom proved licentiously luxurious. Thus, even a Richardson, though his writings abound with the purest morals, and though his Clarissa, with a single exception, may be regarded as a model, cannot, perhaps, be considered as altogether faultless; yet I have thought, that under proper regulations, the province assigned to the novel writer, might be productive of the highest utility; love, I would not hail as almighty; I would not create a despot, before whose throne every other consideration must, of necessity, prostrate; I would not represent him as reducing to vassalage every faculty of the soul, and riding victorious over decency, propriety, and every other virtue; but I would describe him as a benign monarch, to whom reason should administer; his powers should be limited, and chastized by prudence; and, by a series of interesting, circumstantial and well digested narrations, I would produce events deeply marked, and strikingly natural, which should indisputably evince the triumphs of discretion over the impassioned dictates of the perturbed spirit; vol∣umes, wrote upon such a plan, would, I venture to assert, be more serviceable to the interests of virtue than even the ethic page; for, however plausibly we may harangue, the voice of the narrator will still be heard, when, perhaps, the most elaborate essays, not thus embellished, which ever issued from the closet of the studious, will pass the torpid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar without leaving the slightest impression. Indeed, I think the glorious.

Author and Pattern of the Christian faith, seems, in the whole course of his teaching, to put this matter beyond a doubt: One specimen readily presents—when the Saviour undertakes to cultivate the interests of benevolence, when he would disseminate the seeds of that universal benignity, or brotherhood, which, springing up, shall one day produce a rich harvest of immortal amity, he personifies his wishes, and says, "A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho," &amp;c. &amp;c. Thus I conceive, that the well-concerted relation, designed to promote morality, or a rectitude of thinking and acting, is authorized and sanctioned, even by a divine example.</P>
<P>Before such a pleader, thus powerfully provided, even Doctor Subpoena was silent, and the company soon after separating, I returned to my lodgings, felicitating myself on the possession of that command of countenance, which had so regulated every feature, as to render it impossible that my secret should be even surmised; and my business in the capital being accomplished, I jogged onward to my native village, pondering all these things in my mind, and almost coming to a determination to furnish some sketches from my domestic arrangements, when the following letters, which awaited my return, and which I render verbatim, helped to confirm my wavering resolution.</P>

<P>I AM, d'ye see, an old sea commander, and many a tough bout have I had on it in my day; with the wind in my teeth, I have been blown hither and thither, coast wise, and every wise; but what of that? with a pretty breeze, mayhap, I can carry as much sail, and steer as strait forward as another man. Now I have been plaguily puzzled to know at what you were driving: I never, in the whole course of my life, was fond of an uncertain navigation, because,
<PB N="59" REF="034162_0058_0FFC5D009B159800"/>
d'ye see, there is no knowing what rocks and quick∣sands may take one up. For my part, I never wast∣ed many glasses in poring over your books, and your histories, and all that—not I—it was my business to mind how the ship worked, to see if she made good way, and failed as many knots in an hour as the charming Sall, or Bet. When I was a lad, my father sent me to school, and would have made a parson of me; but it would not do—the wind pointed another way, and so I up jib, and bore away, making all the sail I could to more convenient moor∣ings: Howsomever, I learned enough of the art to en∣able me to make an observation, by the help of which I can carry my ship round the globe, passing with safety through the narrowest straits, always keeping her clear of a lee shore, and never running foul of any rock or shoal, though I have made ever so many voyages; but I always kept a good look out, was careful to heave the log, attending, with my own eyes, to the veerings, and my reckonings were as sure and as certain as the rock of Gibraltar. But what is all this to the purpose? avast a moment, and you shall hear. Being pretty much weather beaten, I thought best, some∣time since, to make the safe and convenient harbour of matrimony, and my daughter Molly, for that was the sober name we gave her at the fount, though, by the bye, my wife very soon tacking about, chose to call her Maria, till returning from a trip she hath made to a neighbouring town, the wind again shifting, there is nothing so proper, so sedate, and which, she says, squares so well with her ideas, as Mary; thus reducing us to the necessity of beginning our traverse anew; well, but my said daughter Molly, Maria, or Mary, being born just a year after our marriage, and very soon becoming a fine rosy cheeked girl, I have ever since been examining every point of direction, so belaying the lifts and the braces, the clewlines and the buntlines, that she may be as good a sail, make as good way, and procure as good a birth, as any little tight sea boat of them all. Her mother was for
<PB N="60" REF="034162_0059_0FFC5CFF18256968"/>
putting her adrift at a boarding school, but by virtue of my authority, I have hitherto kept her in her old moorings, being hugely afraid of the breakers, which she may encounter upon the ocean of inexperience; but my education being such as I have said, I am something suspicious that I may not perfectly under∣stand every point of the compass; and being embark∣ed in so difficult a navigation, I am, for the first time since I undertook the command of a ship, rather doubtful of my course. Now you must know, that though I am no reader, I have, in order to find out by the entries and clearances, which way the wind sets with my old comrades, made it my practice to take on board the news-papers; that since my mat∣rimonial adventure, I have also shipped their first cousins, the magazines, and that one cold evening, upon the first of April last, my wife and I being safely hauled up along side of a good fire, were mightily taken with your Margaretta, and that im∣mediately striking our colours, we lovingly agreed to dispose of our Molly, precisely as you should inform us you had done of the little yawl belayed along side your anchorage by dame Arbuthnot; but now, Mr. Gleaner, I am coming to the point; though we have ever since kept watch and watch, placing upon the mast-head of scrutiny the careful eye of intelligence, yet we cannot espy the smallest appearance of the little skiff for which we are looking out; on the con∣trary, you seem to have hoisted every sail, bearing directly from the port to which we supposed you were bound! And pray now what have you got by all this? I doubt your voyage will prove rather unprofitable; for, say what you will, people will turn in when they please, and though your mornings should break ten times handsomer, they will not quit their cabins a single glass the sooner. It is true, you have taken us a round about course to Athens, and the Lord knows where, paraphrasing upon the times, and the times, though you do not make them a rope's end the better: and I know, in the very teeth of all
<PB N="61" REF="034162_0060_0FFC5CF959959750"/>
you say, that I never had more taxes, or more duties to pay, since I first stepped on board a ship; and now, you have come out full freighted with a long sermon, though I could as well find out longitude, as tell from what quarter of the Bible you have taken your text; and even our parson, who I have consulted, and who is as good a man as ever took the command of a church, and who declares, that he thinks you mean very well; yet he, I say, knows no such passage, unless indeed you may have mistaken a sparrow for a lamb, and suppose that he who made him, will order him a fair wind. And what is all this rigmaroll business about? why, forsooth, to introduce a story of a cock and a bull—of a man cured of a consumption at the village of B—. The village of B—! split my topsails—why, it may be bear's head, or bull's foot, for aught we know. This is not well worked, Mr. Gleaner; if you had meant us fair, you would have so pointed our compass, that we might have made sail directly for the harbour of the wonderful physi∣cian, which your chart delineates as affording such safe and commodious landing; but you have so con∣trived matters, as to run every invalid of us fast aground upon the lee shore of conjecture, and I now declare to you, Sir, that if you do not resume your plain sailing, you shall no more be read by</P>

<SALUTE>WORTHY SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I suppose it will be your care to dispose of Miss Melworth to the best advantage; as I think that she must now be marriageable, and as I have been for some time looking out for a wife, I have thought best to address you upon the subject. Indeed, I should have wrote you before; but expecting, every number, to hear something further of the girl, I postponed my intention, until by your long-winded remarks, (you will pardon me, Sir) my patience is quite exhausted. In truth, as I am turned of fifty, I have no time to spare; and having a handsome and disencumbered estate, it is fit that I procure lineal descendants, who, in case of my decease, may become legal possessors. From applying to the girls of our day, whom I have seen, notwithstanding your opinion of "<HI>the present times,</HI>" I am deterred by the little chance which a man hath of obtaining a woman possessed of that discretion which is so requisite in a wife; for, what with <HI>morning visits, family and public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> small strolling, evening tea parties, mid∣night <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and the time which is necessarily devoted to sleep and dressing, the four and twenty hours are completely filled up! Now, as I look upon you, Mr. Gleaner, to be a very wise man, I take it, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your Margaretta must be a girl of a very different sort; and, as I suppose she hath been educated in the country, I take it for certain, that she is a complete house-wife; that she can superintend a dairy; take care of her children, when she has any; see that I have my meals in due season; and that my clothes are brushed and laid in order. Moreover, as from
<PB N="66" REF="034162_0065_0FFC5CE822469CC8"/>
a hint in one of your papers, I imagine that you have a proper idea of the subordination which is so essential to the character of a woman: I presume you have not failed to document your pupil, with sufficient gravity, upon the article of <HI>subjection;</HI> and, I assure you, that I shall expect <HI>obedience from my wife;</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he must not only be very well taught, <HI>industrious,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> economical,</HI> but also extremely <HI>docile.</HI> These things premised, if you will introduce me to Miss Mel∣worth, and we should happen to fancy each other, I will, if you please, order the banns to be published, and very speedily invest her with all the <HI>privileges</HI> and <HI>immuni∣ties</HI> of a wife. I am, worthy Sir, your very humble ser∣vant to command,</P>

<P>In answer to my several correspondents, I have only to observe, in general, that their expectations abundantly forerun both my plans and my ability; but that I may, "in all my best, obey them," I will, from time to time, furnish, from my private family, such sketches as I shall think proper, reserving to myself the privilege of discontinuing and resuming them, as shall suit my convenience. But to my friends Bellamour and Plodder, it is but justice to say, that four months since, I had the felicity to bestow the hand of Miss Melworth upon a very worthy man, who, I doubt not, will be fully sensible of the value of the acquisition which he hath made. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut by what steps she hath obtained the honorary crown of matronhood, may in future numbers be narrated.</P>

<P>NO, I think not—relative to Margaretta, we have no capital errors to deplore; from the hour which consigned to the narrow house the remains of
<PB N="67" REF="034162_0066_0FFC5CE4A0F97B88"/>
Mrs. Aburthnot, she hath continued to progress in our affections, endearing herself to us by every act of duty, and having laid her in our bosom, she hath be∣come unto us indeed a daughter. Heaven hath de∣nied us children; but we regret not that circumstance, while this amiable female lives to prop, to soothe, and to slope our passage through the journey of life. Having packed up her little moveables, the most val∣uable of which was a miniature of her mother, put into her hands by her aunt (whose degree of affinity she hath since understood) just before she expired, we quitted the capital of South-Carolina. I took a place for myself in the stage; and Mary, accommodating herself to the movements of that vehicle, came on with the child. Mary hath the peculiar talent of stealing from the unfortunate their sharpest sorrows; moments of the keenest anguish she can sometimes beguile; and by her address she hath not seldom ex∣tracted from the wounded bosom the lacerating shaft. To soothe and to support the little Margaretta, who was at first overwhelmed with grief, she bent her ut∣most efforts; and as the minds of children, at that early and interesting age, are commonly very suscep∣tible, and easily impressed, she succeeded wonderfully well; while the little creature, assured and comfort∣ed, before we had reached the northern extremity of the middle States, with her heart as light as the gos∣samer, prattled away most delightfully.</P>
<P>When we returned home, we fitted up a little chamber, of which we constituted Margaretta the sole proprietor; my wife informing her that she should establish a post betwixt her apartment and her own, that if they chose, upon any occasion, to separate, they might with the greater convenience open a cor∣respondence by letter. The rudiments of Margaret∣ta's education had been attended to; in her plain work she had made considerable proficiency; she could read the seventh, tenth, eleventh and twelfth chapters of Nehemiah, without much difficulty; and when her aunt was taken ill, she was on the point of
<PB N="68" REF="034162_0067_0FFC5CE31C76C610"/>
being put into joining-hand; but Mary very soon sketched out for our charge rather an extensive plan of education; and as I was not entirely convinced of the inutility of her views, the natural indolence of my temper induced me to let the matter pass, without en∣tering my caveat by way of stopping proceedings; and indeed, I think the propriety of circumscribing the education of a female, within such narrow bounds as are frequently assigned, is at least problematical. A celebrated writer, I really forget who, hath penned upon this subject a number of self-evident truths; and it is an incontrovertible fact, that to the matron is en∣trusted not only the care of her daughter, but also the forming the first and oftentimes the most important movements of that mind, which is to inform the fu∣ture man; the early dawnings of reason she is ap∣pointed to watch, and from her are received the most indelible impressions of his life. Now, was she properly qualified, how enviable and how dignified would be her employment. The probability is, that the family of children, whom she directed, supposing them to possess common capacities, being once initiat∣ed into the flowery paths of science, would seldom stop short of the desired goal. Fine writing, arithme∣tic, geography, astronomy, music, drawing; an attach∣ment to all these might be formed in infancy; the first principles of the fine arts might be so accommodated, as to constitute the pastime of the child; the seeds of knowledge might be implanted in the tender mind, and even budding there, before the avocations of the father permitted him to combine his efforts. Affec∣tion for the sweet preceptress, would originate a strong predilection for instructions, that would with interest∣ing tenderness be given, and that would be made to assume the face of entertainment, and thus the young proficient would be, almost imperceptibly, engaged in those walks, in which an advantageous perseverance might rationally be expected. A mother, who possess∣eth a competent knowledge of the English and French tongues, and who is properly assiduous about
<PB N="69" REF="034162_0068_0FFC5CE1987692C0"/>
her children, I conceive, will find it little more diffi∣cult to teach them to lisp in two languages, than in one: and as the powers of the student advanceth, cer∣tain portions of the day may be regularly appropriat∣ed to the conversing in that language which is not designed for the common intercourses of life. Let∣ters, in either tongue, to the parent, or fictitious char∣acters, may be alternately written, and thus an ele∣gant knowledge of both may be gradually obtained. Learning, certainly, can never with propriety be esteemed a burthen; and when the mind is judiciously balanced, it renders the possessor not only more valu∣able, but also more amiable, and more generally use∣ful. Literary acquisitions cannot, unless the facul∣ties of the mind are deranged, be lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; and while the goods of fortune may be whelmed beneath the contin∣gencies of revolving time, intellectual property still remains, and the mental funds can never be exhaust∣ed. The accomplished, the liberally accomplished female, if she is destined to move in the line of com∣petency, will be regarded as a pleasing and instruc∣tive companion; whatever she does will connect an air of persuasive elevation; wherever she may be ad∣ventitiously called, genuine dignity will be the accom∣paniment of her steps; she will always be attended to with pleasure, and she cannot fail of being distin∣guished; should she, in her career of life, be arrested by adverse fortune, many resources of relief, of pleas∣ure, and of emolument, open themselves before her; and she is not <HI>necessarily</HI> condemned to laborious ef∣forts, or to the drudgery of that unremitted sameness, which the rotine of the needle presents.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the merits of the course which I am thus <HI>apparently</HI> advocating, without stopping to examine the other side of the question, I proceed to say, that the plan of education adopted for Marga∣retta was, as I have already hinted, sufficiently ex∣tensive, and that Mrs. Vigillius (to address my good wife, in her dignified character of governante, with all possible respect) having instructed her pupil in the
<PB N="70" REF="034162_0069_0FFC5CDAE6DDD058"/>
grand fundamental points of the philanthropic re∣ligion of Jesus, was never easy while any branch of improvement, which could by the most remote con∣struction be deemed feminine, remained unessayed; and I must in justice declare, that the consequence, by producing Margaretta at the age of sixteen, a beautiful and accomplished girl, more than answered her most sanguine expectations.</P>
<P>Of needle work, in its varieties, my wife pronounc∣ed her a perfect mistress; her knowledge of the Eng∣lish, and French tongues, was fully adequate to her years, and her manner of reading had, for me, pe∣culiar charms; her hand writing was neat and easy; she was a good accomptant, a tolerable geographer and chronologist; she had skimmed the surface of as∣tronomy and natural philosophy; had made good proficiency in her study of history and the poets; could sketch a landscape; could furnish, from her own fancy, patterns for the muslins which she wrought; could bear her part in a minuet and a co∣tillion, and was allowed to have an excellent hand upon the piano forte. We once entertained a de∣sign of debarring her the indulgence of novels; but those books, being in the hands of every one, we conceived the accomplishment of our wishes in this respect, except we had bred her an absolute recluse, almost impracticable; and Mrs. Vigillius, therefore, thought it best to permit the use of every decent work, causing them to be read in her presence, hoping that she might, by her suggestions and observations, present an antidote to the poison, with which the pen of the novelist is too often fraught. The study of history was pursued, if I may so express myself, systematically: To the page of the historian one hour every day was regularly devoted; a second hour, Mary conversed with her adopted daughter upon the subject which a uniform course of reading had fur∣nished; and a third hour Margaretta was directed to employ, in committing to paper such particular facts, remarks and consequences deduced therefrom, as had,
<PB N="71" REF="034162_0070_0FFC5CD77014DA68"/>
during the hours appropriated to reading, and con∣versing, most strikingly impressed her mind; and by these means the leading features of history were inde∣libly imprinted thereon. Mrs. Vigillius also compos∣ed little geographical, historical, and chronological catechisms, or dialogues, the nature of which will be easily conceived; and she pronounced them of infinite advantage in the prosecution of her plan; she sub∣mitted likewise, at least once every week, to little voluntary absences, when my boy Plato, being consti∣tuted courier betwixt the apartments of my wife and daughter, an epistolary correspondence was carried on between them, from which more than one impor∣tant benefit was derived; the penmanship of our charge was improved; the beautiful and elegant art of letter writing was by degrees acquired; and Mar∣garetta was early accustomed to lay open her heart to her maternal friend.</P>
<P>Persons when holding the pen, generally express themselves more freely than when engaged in conver∣sation; and if they have a perfect confidence in those whom they address, the probability is, that, unbosom∣ing themselves, they will not fail to unveil the inmost recesses of their souls—thus was Margaretta properly and happily habituated to disclose, without a blush, each rising thought to her, on whom the care of pre∣paring her for the great career of life had devolved.</P>
<P>No, Mr. Pedant, she was not unfitted for her prop∣er sphere; and your stomach, however critical it may be, never digested finer puddings than those which I, with an uncommon zest, have partook, as knowing they were the composition of her fair hand—yes, in the receipts of cookery she is thorough∣ly versed; she is in every respect the complete house∣wife; and our linen never received so fine a gloss as when it was ironed and laid in order by Margaretta. Mrs. Vigillius was early taught the science of economy, and she took care to teach it to her daughter; and being more especially economical of time, she so ar∣rangeth matters as never to appear embarrassed, or in
<PB N="72" REF="034162_0071_0FFC5CD5DFBBB7E0"/>
a hurry, having always her hours of leisure, which she appropriates to the contingencies of the day. It is true, she does not often engage in visits of mere cer∣emony, seldom making one of any party, without some view either to her own emolument, or that of those about her; and with regard to dress, she spends but little time in assorting an article which is, it must be confessed, too generally a monopolizer of a blessing, that can hardly be too highly estimated. She doth not think it necessary to have her dishabille for the morning, her robe-de-chambre for noon, and her full trimed polanee or trollopee, for the evening. The morning generally, except in cases of any particular emergency, presents her dressed for the day; and as she is always elegant, of course she can never be pre∣posterous, extravagant or gaudy. It will be hardly necessary to add, that Miss Melworth was, and is, her exact copiest; and indeed she is so warmly attached to my dear Mary, that I verily believe it would have been in her power to have initiated her into the devi∣ous paths of error; and this is saying a great deal of a mind which possesseth such innate goodness, as doth that which inhabits the gentle bosom of my Mar∣garetta. Upon the subject of dress, I am naturally reminded of the request of my fanciful correspondent Monimia Castalio, relative to the dress of Margaretta, and particularly the height of her head; and I am happy that I can gratify Miss Monimia Castalio, by rec∣ollecting a circumstance, which being in point, may serve as a specimen of the general style of Margaret∣ta's dress. I think she was about fifteen, when Mrs. Vigillius conforming as much as her ideas of propriety would admit, to the then fashion of the times, made for her a hat of white satin. I remember there was a prettily fancied ribbon to it; and it had, I thought, rather a jauntee appearance. Margaretta put it on, and sallied forth to pay a visit to an acquaintance, a Miss Preedy; and the next morning, when seated at the breakfast table, with much hesitation she request∣ed her mamma to purchase for her, as an additional
<PB N="73" REF="034162_0072_0FFC5CD32B4600C0"/>
ornament to her hat, some beautiful feathers, which she said were to be disposed of at the very next shop. Mrs. Vigillius, with great calmness, replied, "Yes, my dear, without doubt I can obtain for you the feathers; but I have for some time been endeavouring to accumulate a sum, which I had intended to ap∣propriate for the completion of your little library; and a crown laid out in feathers, will take therefrom at least one handsome and instructive volume; it is true, I have some money now by me, designed for another use—Poor Mrs. Lovemore, over whose mis∣fortunes you have shed so many tears, still swells the sigh of sorrow—he, whose presence would turn her little cottage into a palace, yet remains imprisoned! I have long had it in contemplation to dry the tear of anguish from the cheek of that solitary mourner; and I have anticipated the pleasure I should experi∣ence while witnessing the mantling joy, and the dimp∣ling smiles, which would, upon an occasion so happy, pervade the faces of the little beings who owe to her their existence—Genius of sensibility! how extatic would be my emotions, could I be made instrumental in restering to their embraces the husband and the father! The sum for which Mr. Lovemore is held in durance, is small, and his misfortunes could not by human prudence be either foreseen or prevented. From the late expenditures in our family, I have so far economized, as to have at length made up the requisite sum; and I had thought to have taken a walk this fine morning, in order to liberate the poor man—but you want the feathers, and Lovemore must con∣tinue in captivity until I can lay by another crown."</P>
<P>Never shall I forget the expression, the animated expression, which lighted up the countenance of Mar∣garetta; tears of mingling pleasure and delicate ap∣prehension, were upon her cheek; with a kind of du∣teous eagerness, she seized the hand of Mary, and in a most graceful manner bowing thereon, with a trem∣ulous voice she thus questioned—thus entreated—"And will the sorrows of the poor Mrs. Lovemore
<PB N="74" REF="034162_0073_0FFC5CCE7853CCC0"/>
know an end? O friend, patroness, protectress, pre∣server, mother—what shall I say?—Already my obli∣gations to you are infinite—but tell me, dear lady, will you still add thereto—shall I accompany you to the abode of Mrs. Lovemore? I know that you will consent—let us go this instant—I will fly for your cloak, and we will not delay a moment."</P>
<P>It is hardly necessary to add that Margaretta obtain∣ed her suit, and I subjoin a declaration, that these kind of feathers are the most beautiful, and the highest plum∣ed, of any she hath ever yet worn in her hat or cap.</P>
<P>But while we have been assiduously employed in cul∣tivating the mind of Margaretta, we have been endeav∣ouring to eradicate the seeds of that over-weening self conceit, which, while it would induce an ostentatious exhibition of those talents natural, or adventitious, which she may possess—like a rampant weed would im∣pede and overshadow the growth of every virtue. Against pride and affectation we have been careful to guard her, by constantly inculcating one grand truth; a truth, to the conviction of which every ingenuous mind must be ever open. Her person, the symmetry of her features, the rose and lily of her complexion, the <HI>tout ensemble</HI> of her exterior, the harmony of her voice, &amp;c. &amp;c.—these are the endowments of nature—while the artificial accomplishments with which she is invest∣ed, resulting wholly from accident, and being alto∣gether independent of her own arrangements, confer upon her no real or intrinsic merit.</P>
<P>We are daily assuring her, that every thing in future depends upon her own exertions, and that her character must be designated by that consistent decency, that ele∣gant propriety, and that dignified condescension, which are indeed truly estimable. We have apprized her, that in every stage of her journey through life, she will find friends—or a social intercourse with the circles in which she may be called to move—constituting one of her principal enjoyments, and that if she is not eager for admiration, if she avoids making a display of superior abilities, she will escape those shafts of envy which
<PB N="75" REF="034162_0074_0FFC5CCCF1D896F0"/>
will otherwise be too surely aimed at her peace; and secure to herself the complacent feelings of those with whom she may be conversant.</P>
<P>Margaretta hath a becoming spirit, and dissimula∣tion is a stranger to her heart; she is rather cheerful than gay; she never diverts herself with simplicity and ignorance; <HI>double entendres</HI> she detests; she is not an adept in the present fashionable mode of play∣ing upon words, and she never descends to what is call∣ed jesting; she can deliver herself upon any subject, on which she ventures to speak, with great ease; but in large or mixed companies she engages in conversa∣tion with manifest reluctance; and I have heard her declare, that she hath frequently, when encircled by strangers, felt alarmed at the sound of her own voice; she never comments upon those blunders which are the result of a neglected education, nor will she lend her smiles to those who are thus employed; and she observes, that such kind of peccadillos have upon her no other ef∣fect, than to excite in her bosom the sensation of gratitude</P>
<P>With the laws of custom, or fashion, she is thorough∣ly acquainted, and she consents to follow them as far as they square with the dictates of rectitude; but she never sacrifices to their documents either her humani∣ty, or her convenience; she regards, as extremely venial, an ignorance of their despotic institutions; (indeed the multifarious requirements of mere ceremony, strike her in so trifling a point of view, that she conceives it rather a matter of course that they should sometimes be omit∣ted) and she prefers plain manners to all the glitter of a studied or laboured address.</P>
<P>But it is against the unaccountable freaks of the ca∣pricious, that all the artillery of that humour, of which she possesses a natural fund, is levelled; frank and inge∣nuous herself, she laughs at the vagaries of the whimsi∣cal, and her heart is ever upon her lips; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he reflects much, and her judgment is fashioned by reason; she cannot be seen without pleasure, nor heard without instruction.</P>
<P>But I am rather describing what Margaretta <HI>is,</HI> than what she <HI>was,</HI> at the period of her history
<PB N="76" REF="034162_0075_0FFC5CCB6DE3F878"/>
to which we are arrived. Three or four years have matured her talents, presenting the daily improv∣ing and promising girl, a truly lovely and accom∣plished woman, abundantly answering the fondest ex∣pectations which were formed of her.</P>
<P>When our beloved charge had completed her six∣teenth year, we conceived it full time to introduce her an interesting and beautiful object to a world, of whose deceptions we had been careful to warn her, and for whose intercourse, we flattered ourselves, she was as well qualified as girls at her age generally are.</P>
<P>It was at this period that Mrs. Vigillius, in compli∣ance with the pressing entreaties of a friend in whom she entirely confided, reluctantly consented that Miss Melworth should pass a few weeks in the city of New-Haven.</P>
<P>But it may be proper to refer the opening of a new, and important scene, to a separate essay; and we shall proceed to bring forward the appropriate number, with all possible dispatch.</P>

<PB N="77" REF="034162_0076_0FFC5CC6F1819D50"/>
each other down my cheek; the truth is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the hour which closed the eyes of my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, have never known affliction so severe. Well, but my mamma hath taught me not to dwell upon the dark side of events; and finding an adherence to her pre∣cepts my surest path, I wave every thing of a mel∣ancholy nature, and proceed to say—that Mrs. Wor∣thington received me with much affection; that she treats me in all respects with the same tender atten∣tion which she bestows upon her own daughter, Miss Amelia; and that I do not believe, if I except my own dear mamma, that there is in the whole world a better woman. Col. Worthington, as we were told, is at present absent from home; so that, excepting the do∣mestics, who are decent and obliging people, our family consists only of Mrs. Worthington, Miss Ame∣lia, and myself. I am delighted with New-Haven, with its beautiful plains, its high surrounding mountains, its neat built houses, its ample streets, and the tall trees by which on either hand they are shaded. Yale Col∣lege, an episcopalian church, and three dissenting meeting houses, are situated contiguous to each other. You know, my mamma, you directed me to write as if you were a stranger to every particular. As I walk∣ed over the green, the neighbourhood of these build∣ings seemed to consecrate the spot, rendering it, as it were, hallowed ground. Yale College is not near to spacious as the description which we received from Edward Hamilton of the seminary in which he was educated; indeed, ever since the evening upon which Edward entertained us so agreeably with an account of Harvard College, I have had a very strong inclina∣tion to behold those venerable domes. Many students, however, prosecute their studies here; and I cannot but esteem every young creature happy who hath the disposition, and is presented with the opportunity, of acquiring knowledge. As I have been introduced by Mrs. Worthington as the adopted daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Vigillius, and as the characters of my dear parental friends are so properly revered here, I have
<PB N="78" REF="034162_0077_0FFC5CC2F8123F80"/>
received the most marked attentions. If I might be allowed to give an opinion, I would say that the gen∣tlemen of New-Haven appear to me to be friendly, and hospitable, and that the ladies are truly polite. Per∣haps I may be permitted to pronounce, that those whom I have seen, answer very exactly to the idea of genuine urbanity, which you, Madam, have taught me to form. Among the many who have most obliging∣ly distinguished me, the limits of a letter will only al∣low me to mention Mrs. Edwards. Mr. Edwards, you will recollect, Madam, is an eminent barrister; and the person who is permitted to mingle in their social circles, cannot but enjoy a satisfaction of a superior kind.</P>
<P>The ladies of New-Haven are remarkably fond of cultivating flowers; and a disquisition upon the beau∣ties of the parterre makes a part in almost every con∣versation. Mrs. Edwards counted in her garden at one time, no less than eight hundred tulips all in full blow, among which the various streaks and shades were innumerable. Doubtless I could be very happy in New-Haven, if it was the residence of my papa and mamma, but were it the paradise of the globe, I should sigh for the village of their abode; and the elegant saloon which my mamma devotes to sentimental friend∣ship, the social breakfasting parlour, the ample dining room, the chamber, of which with such unexampled goodness I was constituted sole proprietor, the sweet little flower garden, the smooth gravel walk termina∣ted by the woodbine alcove, &amp;c. &amp;c. these would all live in my idea as the haunts of perfect happiness. Mrs. Worthington insists on my tarrying here until the expiration of the Commencement holidays; but in truth, I am well pleased that my leave of absence ex∣tendeth not near so far; and I am glad that my mam∣ma hath fixed precisely the time of my return; for I always feel assured and tranquil when I am entirely under her direction. You will please to assure all my young acquaintance, particularly Serafina and Ed∣ward Hamilton, that they are often present to my imagination; that in my dreams I still mix in their

little parties; and that it is impossible I should cease to remember them, or to love them very sincerely.</P>
<P>Well, I have written more than two pages, and yet have not executed the purpose I formed when I sat me down to this employ: You have accustomed me, dearest lady, to unbosom myself to you, and though this is my first separation from you, yet the epistolary correspond∣ence, with which I have for such a length of time, though continued under your roof, been indulged, hath given me the habit of expressing myself to you in this way, with the utmost freedom; and as a proof that I will never wear disguises, when addressing her whose care hath rendered life to me a valuable gift, I will confess that I make the following communication with more reluctance than I ever yet, upon any occasion, experienced; but truth shall be my motto, and to my loved patroness I will have no reserves. I had been but one hour in the family of Mrs. Worthington, when a young gentleman, Mr. Sinisterus Courtland, made his appearance in that lady's drawing room; he enter∣ed with the air of an established acquaintance, and in∣deed he stands high in the esteem of Mrs. Worthing∣ton; a large party was collected, all of whom he ad∣dressed in a manner truly engaging, and upon my be∣ing introduced, payed me a compliment in a style so new, so elevated, and so strikingly pleasing, that my heart instantaneously acknowledged an involuntary prepossession in his favour; sensations with which I was till that moment unacquainted, pervaded my bo∣som; I felt my face in a glow, and a pleasing kind of perturbation took possession of my faculties. My op∣portunities of seeing Mr. Courtland have been since frequent. Three days afterwards he declared himself my lover; his assiduities are unwearied; he professes to live but in my presence, and he protests that my re∣jection of him will make him the most miserable of men. Mrs. Worthington assures me, that Mr. Court∣land is a gentleman whose addresses no lady need blush to receive; and I will own to you, Madam, that if a few years more had passed ever my head, as you have
<PB N="80" REF="034162_0079_0FFC5CBEC8A7AED8"/>
taught me to conceive a union with a man of worth may rationally be the ultimatum of a woman's wishes; I should think I stood a greater chance for happiness with this gentleman, than with any other in∣dividual of his sex.</P>
<P>Mr. Courtland is a native of V—in the State of—he says he had formerly the honour of an acquaintance with my papa. He is tall and well made, his address is easy, and commanding; the contour of his face is strikingly agreeable; indeed, his whole exteriour is a combination of elegance and dignity, and his manners are confessedly descriptive of the finished gentleman. I am told that he adds to these superficial accomplish∣ments a substantial and cultivated understanding; that he is a man of erudition, and possesseth also, with a gen∣eral knowledge of books, an extensive acquaintance with the world. On my return, he will present him∣self before my parental friends. Perhaps they may not approve a connexion so disproportioned in regard to years, Mr. Courtland having numbered full thirty, and I but little better than sixteen. I confess that I feel a degree of culpability while detecting my heart, thus audaciously leaning toward an election, until my honoured benefactors, pointing the finger, had united∣ly pronounced, "There, Margaretta, there is your con∣genial soul; behold the person whom we direct you to regard, as him who is destined the associate of your future life;" but my fault is altogether involuntary, and I pray you, my dear lady, to present to my papa my respectful regards; and to assure him that from his honoured lips, and those of my mamma, must proceed the award which will decide the fate of their ever du∣teous, ever grateful, ever affectionate</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter, I say, inflicted upon my bosom the most pungent anxiety. Full well I knew Sinisterus Courtland. I knew him much better (for my personal interviews with him had been but few) than he was apprized of; I knew him to be base, designing, and however incon∣gruous
<PB N="81" REF="034162_0080_0FFC5CBAA2DF6DE0"/>
these qualities may seem, improvident also; his father had bred him a gentleman, leaving him on∣ly a slender patrimony to support his pretensions, while he was wholly destitute of the means, disposition, or talents, to add thereto; nay, even his small inheritance, without spending a single thought on the future, he had deeply involved, until pressed upon by his creditors, he was finally induced to an effort to extricate him∣self, by the very <HI>honourable method</HI> of deluding some wo∣man whose expectations were tolerable, into an affair of the heart, the matrimonial termination of which, he considered as an axiom, which was too irrefragable to admit of doubt; he had spent the morning of his life in fluttering from town to town, paying his devoirs to every inconsiderate girl, who, allured by his flattery, and charmed by an exteriour which is indeed unex∣ceptionable, and deceived also by the ease, brilliancy, and eclat of his appearance into a good opinion of his finances, became the dupe of her own vanity, finding her inclinations betrayed, in favour of an impostor, who on his part, possessed not depth of understanding sufficient to render him capable of a serious or lasting impression.</P>
<P>It is scarcely necessary to add a finishing to the character that now presented a formidable candi∣date for the heart of my girl; and, in addition to the unfavourable light in which I beheld Mr. Courtland, I had long entertained other views for Mar∣garetta, adjusting my plans in such a manner, as I conceived well nigh precluded a disappointment: I was sensible, that as I had no near relation of my own, it was generally supposed Miss Melworth would be my heir, and I shuddered at the idea of the little fortune which, with much industry, application and economy, I had accumulated, being squandered by a spendthrift, while my daughter, and her descendants, were left pennyless! For a moment, regarding myself as a ship∣wrecked voyager, bereaved of every hope, I was ready, yielding the point, to stretch myself upon the barren heaths of despair; but after deliberating the matter, I conceived, that though my fabric tottered, it was not
<PB N="82" REF="034162_0081_0FFC5CB64C3E9908"/>
absolutely whelmed; and though I was aware that, manured by the prejudices prepared in the hot-bed of novel reading, the impressions made upon young minds, with the passions implanted in the tender soil, were not easily erased, or up-rooted; yet I conceived that the task, however arduous, was not altogether impractica∣ble; and while apprized that the business in which I was about to engage required in the management thereof the utmost delicacy, I concluded, nevertheless, that an object so desirable, was at least worth any attempt to obtain it. Thus having made up my mind, Mary, who was hand in glove with me, began our operations, by responding to the letter of Margaretta, in the sub∣joined manner.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Village of—, County of—, <DATE>May 16, 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I PERSUADE myself, my dear Margaretta, that it would at this time be wholly superfluous to express to you the very high satisfaction which both your father and myself mutually experience, at that unfeigned complacency in your situation, which you take every opportunity so gratefully to avow. Once for all, my dear girl, you may assure yourself that your affection∣ate regards are abundantly reciprocated; that we have no idea of a warmer attachment than we have con∣ceived for you; and, that if the hearts of natural parents beat with ardours stronger than those which expand our bosoms, they must border so nearly upon anguish, that we are not ambitious of being able, experimentally to ascertain the difference; neither shall I, at this time, expatiate upon the merit of your letter—my opinion of your epistolary talents, you already know, though per∣haps I should not so easily deny myself a repetition of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se fond expressions of admiration, to which I am ac∣customed, and which, possibly, in some degree originate in the predilection which my maternal feelings hath in∣duced—were it not that the important communication you have forwarded to us, absorbs in my soul every consideration of less weight.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="034162_0082_0FFC5CB2300DE140"/>
I hardly know where to begin, or how to ex∣press to you the anxiety to which you have given birth in our bosoms. Is it possible, that my Marga∣retta can <HI>love</HI> where she cannot <HI>entirely esteem!</HI> and can she have so far forgot the lessons of her youth, as <HI>entirely to esteem</HI> Mr. Courtland! What is the conduct of a man of honour in so delicate a conjuncture as you delineate? doth he wait till he hath, as he supposes, irrevocably fixed himself in the heart of a young woman, before he deigns to apprize those whose nights and days have been spent in watching for her welfare? Certainly not—but immediately after his proposals have been made to her, who I grant is the person principally concerned, if he can discern the smallest appearance of success, (and men are eagle eyed upon these occasions) he will solicit the sanction of her guardian friends, that he may either avail himself of them as auxiliaries in his pursuit; or, if necessary, set about conquering a passion which cannot be consecrated by duty—reverse the picture, and the man of duplicity stands confest; he will steal into the confidence of the unsuspecting virgin, obtaining what he conceives an unalterable and undi∣vided ascendency over her mind, and then, <HI>merely as a compliment,</HI> the parents are made acquainted with the business, who, if they presume to enter their caveat, however improper the connexion may in fact be, are accused of tyranny, barbarity, and what not.</P>
<P>Thus Mr. Courtland—the post passes by our door, but he hath not condescended to pen for us a single line, which might inform us of his enterprize. Doubtless his intention is to assail your passions during the whole period of your purposed visit, when deeming the matter irremediable, he will make us a genteel bow, and <HI>insult</HI> us by requesting our advice! But from you, my dear child, we expect a decision more upright—you have deviated, it is true, but you have as yet taken but one step, and we doubt not that you will very speedily re∣cover the path of discretion. You see that our objec∣tion to Mr. Courtland is not altogether on account of his years, though this of itself is in our opinion insup∣erable;
<PB N="84" REF="034162_0083_0FFC5CB092FC5618"/>
at present, sixteen and thirty may move in the same sphere; but pass a few years, and we may almost trace their orbits in opposite hemispheres; <HI>seventy is the age of man</HI>—while fifty-six may enjoy the utmost vigour of mental and corporeal powers—indeed, if <HI>similarity of dispositions, sentiments and attachments are requi∣site to constitute matrimonial felicity, surely an equali∣ty, or nearly an equality of years, ought to be deemed of some importance in the calculation.</HI> I know that to almost every general rule there are exceptions; but yet, nevertheless, I would not give my voice in favour of a gentleman's having more than two or three years at farthest, the advantage over her whom he selected as the partner of his life.</P>
<P>Ask yourself, my dear, what opportunity have you had of becoming acquainted with the views, hab∣its, or temper of Mr. Courtland; and yet, although, when your letter was written, only <HI>ten days</HI> from the moment of your introduction to him had elapsed, you <HI>seriously pronounced him the individual, who of all his sex is the most capable of making you happy!</HI> Such is the natural good sense of my Margaretta, that I assure myself I need not comment upon this declaration.</P>
<P>I am rather surprised at the part which my friend Mrs. Worthington hath taken in this affair; surely, in this instance, she hath been misled by the goodness of her own heart. Mr. Courtland is only a visitor in New-Haven; the place of his nativity and usual resi∣dence is at a great distance; and she can only know in general that he is a man of family and education. But in truth, I myself have been wrong; I ought not to have parted with my Margaretta. Yet, while I palli∣ate my fault, by a declaration that I conceived her extreme youth would have protected her from over∣tures so important; I trust, that the tears which I have shed upon this occasion, will expiate it.</P>
<P>Yes, my love, your father knows Mr. Courtland—<HI>he knows him well;</HI> and without further investigating the character of that gentleman, he bids me tell you, that he hath long entertained views of establishing you
<PB N="85" REF="034162_0084_0FFC5CAB1F104158"/>
in our own neighbourhood. Edward Hamilton—start not, my dear, at a name, which in the innocence of your heart you have a thousand times declared you loved—hath now completed his nineteenth year; he bids fair to be every thing which a fond father could wish for the man, to whom he yielded the beloved daughter of his affections; his character is bottomed upon integrity; he is every way accomplished; his prospects are good; his knowledge of the profession of his election, indeed his extensive acquaintance with mercantile affairs, is, for his years, prodigious; with regard to his exteriour and address, if we allow for the charm of novelty, he might rival even a Courtland; and I declare I know not the youth who can equal him for gentility of mein, and beauty of person. But these are attractions, sim∣ply considered, to which the heart of my Margaretta, when she suffers herself calmly to reflect, will, I am per∣suaded, ever remain impregnable. Before the death of your reverend friend, old Mr. Hamilton, the plan of uniting our children, supposing their hearts were not reluctant, was adjusted. The good gentleman re∣garded his son as almost an affianced lover; otherwise I imagine he would not have left his ward, the beau∣tiful and accomplished Serafina, situated as she is in regard to Edward; who, however unblemished his character may be, is nevertheless, as a young man, a very ill-judged guardian for a young and unconnected woman. Hitherto, being desirous of leaving you wholly unrestrained, we have kept our secret close locked in our own bosoms; and until the receipt of your letter, we have beheld with pleasure the gradual advancement of our wishes. For Edward, he is wholly devoted to you, and while hardly conscious of the mo∣tives by which he is actuated, he is assiduous in every thing which relates to you; even trifles are invested with importance, if they are inscribed with your name—if you are unexpectedly mentioned, his whole frame is visibly agitated, his complexion assumes a more ani∣mated glow, his voice is mellowed into an unusual softness, and his tongue is never tired in rehearsing
<PB N="86" REF="034162_0085_0FFC5CA7C5398A28"/>
your praises; but, fear not my girl—if we cannot con∣vince your judgment, and woo your best affections, you shall never be the wife of Hamilton.</P>
<P>Your interest and happiness is the sole motive of our actions; it is the pole star by which all our movements are directed, and if we can but see you pleasingly established, and in possession of tranquillity, we shall lay us down in perfect peace. We regard the unfold∣ing our plan to you at this time, as premature, and we <HI>feelingly</HI> regret that our measures are thus unfor∣tunately precipitated. We have not yet disclosed our∣selves to Edward; we are not in favour of early mar∣riages; and though the laws of Heaven and of good citizenship, have ordained the sexes for each other, yet we think that years are requisite to ripen the judg∣ment, and to ascertain the choice, which a young per∣son may have every reason to suppose immutably fixed. We have conceived, that a female who takes a step so important, at the age of twenty three, or upwards, hath lost no time; and it was only in compliance with the dying request of Mr. Hamilton, that we consented, supposing our young people should be propitious, that you should, at the period when you shall have com∣pleted your nineteenth year, exchange your vows with his deserving son.</P>
<P>But, waving these matters for the present, I have to say, that your father, after presenting you his pa∣ternal regards and blessing, directs me to inform you, that business will soon call him to New-Haven, and that, if curtailing your visit, you can find it agreeable to return home with him, you will confer on him a very high obligation; in this request, my dear, I, for my part, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st sincerely join; and, if your wishes meet mine, you will please to express to Mrs. Worthington, my thanks for her indulgence to you—to offer her my respects, and to acquaint her, that, sickening for the dear child of my love, I can no longer deny myself the gratification of her society.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT will not be doubted but the urgency of my af∣fairs, very soon made my New-Haven expedition a matter of necessity: nor will it, I presume, be re∣garded as problematical, that Miss Melworth, with duteous acquiescence, became the companion of my return. But alas! that cheerfulness, which had so long presided in her bosom, had taken its flight; and though joy gladdened in her countenance at the entrance of our village, and at the appearance of our habitation; though she seemed, while clasped in the arms of Mary, to be lost in extacy—yet, upon her lovely countenance the cloud again gathered; her eye beamed a melan∣choly languor; the rose upon her cheek visibly gave place to the lily of her complexion, and we were well nigh distracted by the gloomy forebodings which her altered figure originated in our souls. We had con∣certed our plan, the ultimatum of which was her feli∣city; and we were determined, if we could not bend her to our wishes, to follow her through all the vicissi∣tudes her unfortunate preference might involve, with every alleviation which we could furnish. We con∣templated the yielding her to the youth we loved, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> full and deliberate choice. Nothing short of this would satisfy our affection, or restore to us the en∣tire possession of that peace, which the late event had invaded; yet we abhorred constraint, and we regard∣ed persuasion, considering the tender and conceding mildness of that heart which was almost in our hands, as no better than a specious kind of tyranny. But be∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in regard to the doctrine which extends the empire of <HI>genuine love, in my virtuous bosom, beyond
<PB N="88" REF="034162_0087_0FFC5CA4C070FDC8"/>
the existence or agency of esteem,</HI> we doubted not, if we could erase from the breast of our orphan, those high ideas she had conceived of the merit of her lover, the <HI>belle passion</HI> would very speedily evaporate. Our busi∣ness then being to convince the judgment, while we assured ourselves, if this was possible, the consequences we wished would inevitably follow, against a confi∣dence which we conceived so highly misplaced, the whole force of our artillery was, of course, levelled. Having, however, so great a stake, it became us to de∣liberate much, to be very cautious in our movements; a precipitate step might ruin our measures, and it was our aim to be guarded at all points. Courtland very soon made his appearance in our village, we extended to him the rights of hospitality; and, as an admirer of Miss Melworth's, we gave him every decent opportu∣nity of advocating his cause. To this mode of proce∣dure we were impelled by the following considerations: Should we refuse, to this pretender, that uniform civil∣ity, with which we have distinguished every stranger, the wound thereby given to the feelings of Margaretta, might very possibly add to the strength of her attach∣ment; and the idea of his suffering upon her account, interesting her gratitude, would still more have en∣deared him to her; while, in the inmost recesses of her soul, accusing us of injustice, she would syllogistically have concluded, that error in one particular involved a possibility of mistake in another. And it would, in truth, have been in a very high degree absurd, to have denied his claim to common attentions, merely because he had eyes for the charms of a person, whom our partiality induced us to think, had merit sufficient to captivate every beholder. In this arrangement we also made ourselves witnesses of every movement, pre∣cluding all necessity for, and possibility of, clandestine views; and we conceived, besides, that as Miss Mel∣worth possessed a penetration far beyond her years, frequent interviews with <HI>Sinisterus Courtland</HI> would in∣fallibly develope to her understanding his true charac∣ter, effectually destroying that mask under which he
<PB N="89" REF="034162_0088_0FFC5C9FDC2F4560"/>
had continued to betray the unwary; and we well knew, that could <HI>she herself</HI> make the discovery we wished, such an event would operate more propitiously than any information, however important, which might be handed her from any other quarter. Perhaps it may be matter of surprise, that being myself in posses∣sion of such material documents, I did not come to an immediate explanation, thus adjusting the business agreeably to my own designation. But though, as I apprehend, the preceding remark anticipates this ob∣servation, I have yet to say, I was aware of the sub∣terfuges to which bad men often have recourse: Had I declared my knowledge of what I termed Court∣land's enormities, it would have been easy for him to have availed himself of the plea of youth and inexpe∣rience, of a change of system, reformation, present regularity, &amp;c. &amp;c. and, for his poverty, it was an objection which the ardour of young affection would not only find a <HI>laudable generosity</HI> in palliating, but it would, with glowing zeal, assay to enlist against so <HI>mercenary</HI> and <HI>unworthy</HI> a consideration, the most vir∣tuous propensities of the soul. I knew that to erase impressions, made upon the youthful bosom, violent efforts must generally be inadequate; that they would much more frequently lacerate, than obliterate; and I was not willing to leave in the bosom of Margaretta the smallest fear. I had not forgotten the integrity and the ingenuity which characterizes the morning of life; and I remembered also, that the enthusiasm of an early love, is fruitful in its vindications of the ob∣ject of its preference; and that it is ready to accuse every objector as prejudiced and unjust. Taking the matter up in this view, we thought best to await some fortunate crisis, holding the <HI>unquestionable facts</HI> of which we were possessed, relative to Courtland, as our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resource.</P>
<P>Mean time, we descended not to disguises: Upon the application of that gentleman, we informed him of our prior engagement to young Hamilton's father▪ of our wishes for the success of the projected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="90" REF="034162_0089_0FFC5C9B78B10020"/>
of our determination to take every proper step, which we should deem likely to propitiate the mind of Mar∣garetta, respecting an event which we regarded in so eligible a view; and we grounded our objections to him on the disparity of years, the short date of his ac∣quaintance with Miss Melworth, and the distance of his residence; nevertheless, we added, that if we had the power, even of natural parents, over the final de∣cision of that young lady, we should not hold ourselves authorized to direct her any further than reason point∣ed; and that we left him at full liberty to prosecute his suit with what advantage he might, only promis∣ing, that we should not consent to dispose of Miss. Melworth, even to Hamilton himself, until she had com∣pletely rounded her nineteenth year. Courtland, up∣on this assurance, reddened excessively; he had hoped <HI>his happiness might have been much sooner accelerated, and some very pressing circumstances, relative to him, demanded a very early establishment.</HI> Our determination upon this head continued, however, unalterable; while our es∣pousing, as we apparently did, the interests of Hamil∣ton, occasioned in the bosom of our daughter such a struggle between inclination and duty, as still looked with a very serious and unfriendly aspect upon her health. Upon our grand subject, both Mary and my∣self held with her many conversations, which, I am vain enough to imagine, might be useful to young persons thus circumstanced, and which, did not the limits prescribed to a writer for the Magazine, set bounds to my encroachments, should most certainly be recounted; but should they be demanded, as they were immediately committed to paper, future Glean∣ers shall certainly record them. One sentiment, how∣ever, which dropped from the mouth of Mary, which I accidentally overheard, and which was perfectly new to me, I cannot excuse myself from giving. She was, one fine afternoon, while seated with Margaretta in the arbour to which they were both so much attached, endeavouring, in a manner peculiar to herself, to sooth the feelings of her daughter; thus encouraging her to
<PB N="91" REF="034162_0090_0FFC5C9835D5A978"/>
lay open her whole soul, that she might, from such confidence, the better judge of the nature of the rem∣edy she was to apply; when Miss Melworth, sensibly regretting that she was so unfortunately situated, as to feel a disposition to act contrary to the wishes of her best friends; by turns lamenting and accusing the treachery of a heart which had thus betrayed her, concluded a very tender harangue, by a declaration, that though Hamilton was every thing amiable, yet she was certain she could never feel for him that pref∣erence which she did for Courtland; she could never regard him in any other view than that of a brother. "Will you, my sweet girl," replied Mary, "<HI>re-consider</HI> this affirmation? you are fond of reasoning, you know; and trust me, my dear, when I assure you, that an at∣tachment which embraceth not reason as its auxiliary, is not worth cherishing. You own that Hamilton is every thing amiable; but you can only love him as a brother! you pretend not to point out a single vir∣tue, a single accomplishment, a single grace, in which Courtland can claim a superiority over Hamilton; yet you can only love Hamilton as a brother, while you love Courtland as—as what, my dear? Will you, Margaretta, please to point out the distinction between those attachments which you feel for the one and the other? You blush, my love; let me kiss off that conscious tear—Say, my charming reasoner, would these over nice distinctions, for which you cannot find a name, ever have found entrance into the bosom of a virtuous girl, were it not for that false taste which is formed by novel reading? What is this something which you feel for Courtland, and which you cannot feel for Hamilton? Certainly it is, at best, but the fever of the imagination, the delirium of fancy; and ever experienced votary of this <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> if under the direction of truth, will tell you, that the duration of the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>xism is extremely short, that the sober and healthy age of reason awaits, when love and friendship wear the same face, when only solid advantages can please; and, they will add, that no well informed per∣son
<PB N="92" REF="034162_0091_0FFC5C9687AF6C28"/>
would sacrifice to the illusion of a moment, the happiness of a life. Did you never, my dear, reflect upon the connexions which must have been formed by the immediate descendants of the pair who were cre∣ated in Paradise? brothers then interchanged the nup∣tial vow with sisters; they were unacquainted with the refinements of modern times; the virtues which en∣deared the brother, rendered the husband amiable; and we have no authority for supposing, that their matri∣monial felicity was more circumscribed than that of their posterity. It is true, that the multiplication of our species have rendered other regulations, relative to the marriage contract, or the parties contracting, both necessary and proper; and it is undoubtedly true, that an observation of these regulations, is religiously obli∣gatory; but yet, in my opinion, the absurdity of hold∣ing a character in great estimation, and highly accom∣plished, as a brother, which we should at the same time regard with reluctance as a conjugal companion, is still palpable; and I must repeat, that the preva∣lency of such romantic ideas can originate only in the regions of fancy." Thus far my honest woman. But Margaretta, in a letter to Miss Worthington, which lately came under my observation, hath best described her own sensations; I subjoin it therefore, <HI>verbatim,</HI> as it flowed from as susceptible and upright a heart, as ever beat in the bosom of humanity.</P>

<P>I AM, my dear Miss Worthington, highly pleased, that my account of my reception in—I had almost said, my native village—hath been productive to you, of even a momentary satisfaction; and I do assure you that I am not a little elated, when I am told, your honoured mother pronounces my description replete with some of the most beautiful traits of nature: I know, that to her partiality and candour, I ought to impute much; but, by the commendation of so respectable a judge, I am nevertheless exhilarated, and I am almost induced to
<PB N="93" REF="034162_0092_0FFC5C90CFB1DA50"/>
think it allowable, to plume myself upon an award so honorary. You will please to offer to the dear lady my acknowledgments, accompanied by my most res∣pectful regards.</P>
<P>You ask me if I have recovered my tranquillity; alas, no! and I fear, my Amelia, that peace hath fled forever from my bosom. Mr. Courtland, as you sup∣pose, is here; would I had never seen him—I might then have been happy. Edward Hamilton—the bloom hath forsaken his checks—the lustre of his fine eyes is no more—I never saw so total a change in a youth, who but lately might have figured as the personifica∣tion of health, enlivened and informed by the most endearing vivacity: Would I had never seen Court∣land—I might then have been happy. When Edward Hamilton suffers, I feel that I cannot stand by regard∣less; I follow him with the affection of a sister; but of late, he studiously shuns my advances: It was but yesterday, that with trembling eagerness, he grasped my hand; something he was about to say; but, as if recollecting himself, instantly, like the spectre of a dream. he fled away. And I not justified in sayings that if I had never seen Courtland, I might then have been happy? Serafina too, is often drowned in tears. Serafina is the sister of my heart. Why will she not exchange her vows with. Edward? how rich should I then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with such a brother—such a sister. You ask if Mr. Courtland is an approved lover—alas, no!—alas, yes!—You will be at no loss to explain this seem∣ing paradox. I sometimes suspect that my guardian friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be in possession of some secret, relative to Mr. Courtland, which they have not yet unfolded; for surely they could not be so strongly opposed, on account of inequality of years. The engagement en∣tered into with old Mr. Hamilton was conditional; and you know, my dear, that though I am—though I <HI>was,</HI> I should say, cheerful, it never could be said that I was gay; and I think I could accommodate my∣self to the gravest humour: But my parents, you will say, are the best judges; and you, Miss Worthington,
<PB N="94" REF="034162_0093_0FFC5C8DBB595C00"/>
are a good girl, while I, methinks, am become a faulty, a very faulty creature. My mother—but my mother is an angel—I do assure you, my dear, that I not seldom feel a degree of awe, while contemplating the character of so divine a woman, which absolutely deters me from arrogating to myself the title, with which her condescending indulgence hath invested me. This superior woman, you will recollect, assured me that I should never be the wife of Hamilton, except both my judgment, and my best affections were con∣senting; exactly with this declaration, doth every ar∣rangement correspond; and, while neither she nor my father produce a single argument in favour of the man of their election, which reason doth not fully au∣thorize, they unitedly and repeatedly engage, that however I may ultimately determine, they will nev∣er cease to be my parental friends. Tell me, my dear, what returns doth such matchless generosity merit? And help me to discharge as I ought, with becoming decency, a daughter's part. Unexampled indeed is their consideration for me; and still the more to en∣hance their goodness, and ally it to perfection, they assay to wear a tranquillity which is foreign from their hearts; for alas! do I not hourly observe the anxious solicitude but too visibly pourtrayed in the manly fea∣tures of my father—often have I wiped the tear from the swoln eye of my mother—often have I witnessed the chagrin which they have mutually and involun∣tarily manifested at any discovery which I have un∣warily made of my attachment to Courtland; and I have but too well marked the joy of their brightened countenances, at the smallest instance of my tenderness for Edward. What right do I possess thus to stab the bosoms which have so long fostered me? Better I had been whelmed beneath those waves which gave death to him from whom I derived my existence, than thus to become the source of corroding anxiety, to characters so exalted. Every pensive look of theirs pierces me to the soul; and I seem to move an evil genius, doomed to chace peace from their revered bosoms. Amelia,
<PB N="95" REF="034162_0094_0FFA65105FA59FA0"/>
I could not be other than miserable, even possessed of the man of my heart, if I thus implanted in the pillow of my guardian friends, the rankling thorn of disap∣pointment.</P>
<P>Forgive, my dear, this incoherent letter; it is expres∣sive of my feelings; the pressure upon my spirits is ex∣treme; my situation is truly melancholy; it is pre∣cisely that which I would wish to avoid. Could I unite my hopes and wishes with the expectations of those who have a right to my utmost obedience, how enviable would be my lot? You demand a long, a very long letter; but what can I write which will not be calculated to cast a cloud over the charming vivacity of my lively friend. Yet you would acquaint yourself with every movement of my soul! well then, as you have expressed a predilection for my little poetical attempts, I will transcribe for you some lines which I last night hastily penned, after I had retired from my parents, enriched with their affectionate and joint ben∣ediction; they delineate my wishes; they delineate my feelings, and they are the fervid breathings of a much agitated, and deeply wounded spirit.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Yet pressing onward, with the goal in view,</L>
<L>More ardent still our hopes and wishes grew.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THUS, for a considerable time, matters remained stationary as it were, in my family. Courtland continued his pursuit. In the bosom of Margaretta, the conflict between duty and inclination was unyield∣ingly severe; and Hamilton, with a noble consistency,
<PB N="97" REF="034162_0096_0FFC5C8AAC413940"/>
persevered in declining a competition, which he deem∣ed unworthy that rational, disinterested and fervent attachment, which every faculty of his soul had long acknowledged for Miss Melworth.</P>
<P>Courtland, evidently exulting in his success, felici∣tated himself upon his opening prospects; and calculat∣ing upon the tenderness of Margaretta, he became con∣fident it would be in his power to obtain a much ear∣lier day, than the very distant era which we had so peremptorily named.</P>
<P>We were thus circumstanced, when the following little poem that made its appearance in the Gazette, however inconsiderable it may in fact be, from the important consequences by which it was attended, mer∣its a place in my narration.</P>
<LG>
<L>As on the shorn bank I delightedly stray'd,</L>
<L>Admiring the meadows, the woods, and the glade,</L>
<L>A nymph whose attendance enlivened the scene,</L>
<L>In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry meanders tript over the green;</L>
<L>And thus, as she rambled, she carelessly said—</L>
<L>Come, depict, if you can, your favourite maid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My favourite maid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll enraptur'd I cry'd,</L>
<L>My favourite maid, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her sex is the pride;</L>
<L>The standard of elegance, formed to please,</L>
<L>Her movements the portrait of dignifi'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase;</L>
<L>While each brightening charm which floats on her mien,</L>
<L>Announces her bosom as virtue serene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her tresses <HI>not borrow'd,</HI> so neatly entwin'd,</L>
<L>Proclaim the good taste which so well hath design'd;</L>
<L>And her dark auburn looks as so glossy they flow,</L>
<L>Contrast as they wave the smooth forehead of snow;</L>
<L>While her soft, mildly beaming, sky tinctur'd eye,</L>
<L>Evinceth bland pity, and sweet sympathy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The rose and the lily are blended in vain,</L>
<L>Her sway to extend, or her triumphs maintain,</L>
<L>For though on her face as they dazzlingly glow,</L>
<L>The polish of beauty's own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>;</L>
<L>Yet rivall'd by graces which dwell in her mind,</L>
<L>To mental inthralment my heart is resign'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She knows to distinguish—she knows to reflect,</L>
<L>What measures are proper, and how to direct;</L>
<L><PB N="98" REF="034162_0097_0FFC5C852E565DA0"/>
Her manners correct, by fair decency form'd,</L>
<L>To complacency sweet, by tenderness warm'd,</L>
<L>Inmingles true dignity, chaste and refin'd,</L>
<L>With soft condescension, for soothing design'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And thus gem'd by loveliness—thus gem'd by worth,</L>
<L>The virgin of innocence, beauty and truth;</L>
<L>That swain will be happy, to whose faithful heart,</L>
<L>The gods shall a gift of such value impart;</L>
<L>For amity lives in a bosom so fair,</L>
<L>And love will ameliorate when planted there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From floods of old ocean the nymph was receiv'd,</L>
<L>From white clifted Albion the angel deriv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hold, hold, 'tis enough, my fair prompter exclaim'd;</L>
<L>This hint is superfluous; each trait you have nam'd</L>
<L>Belongs to your Melworth—your Melworth alone,</L>
<L>No maiden so perfect our circles have known;</L>
<L>E'en as you delineate, the object expands,</L>
<L>And sweet Margaretta conspicuous stands.</L>

<P>These lines, by accelerating our movements, soon put our affairs in a train, giving us at least a perspec∣tive glance of the completion of our plans. The light∣ed match is soon in a flame, and the smallest spark will enkindle it; but I will lead to the catastrophe in course. The lines, as I said, made their appearance in the Ga∣zette; they had no signature, and who the writer was, we could not even conjecture. Hamilton, upon pre∣tence of business, had absented himself from our village for more than two weeks; and besides, though we knew that when a boy he had indulged an itch for scribbling in rhyme, yet we conceived that his ripening years had induced him to relinquish every intrigue with damsels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the muses, whose favours are so hard∣ly earned, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so seldom invest their votaries with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, which is in any sort ade∣quate, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for the unwearied diligence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>We,</HI> however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> concerned about it; and Margaretta <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> accustomed to praise to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the matter. But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amiable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> girl, (the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> charity of whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each) her
<PB N="99" REF="034162_0098_0FFC5C805E7DC558"/>
well known benevolence, her condescending affability to her inferiors, her complacently dignified deportment to her equals, and her veneration for all those whom years had rendered her superiors—had so well estab∣lished her in the hearts of our connexions, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender her an object generally beloved; and, indeed, the pro∣priety and equality of her conduct had been such, as to produce a solecism to the adage, which creates envy as the shadow of merit; nor did we know that the pas∣sion of malevolence was in exercise toward her. It was soon noised abroad that Margaretta had been eu∣logized in the news paper, and it furnished a topic for those circles in which she moved; her partial favourers found beauties in the piece, which perhaps a critic would have been far from allowing it. They made it their business to find out the Author; they applied themselves with much avidity to the pursuit; and they determined, if they should be so fortunate as to suc∣ceed, to hail him as the prince of poets.</P>
<P>We had, among the number of our visitors, and old lady by the name of Clacket, who was also much at∣tached to Miss Melworth, and whose curiosity was upon this occasion raised to the highest pitch. She roundly taxed Courtland with being the author of the poem; and the embarrassment which be discovered, abun∣dantly justified her suspicions.</P>
<P>The piece had, as I hinted, its admirers; and Court∣land either saw, or thought he saw, an advantage in adopting this fugitive relation of the Parnassian lasses: He managed the matter with some adroitness; his ser∣vant was authorized to whisper, as it profound secret to lady Clacket's maid, that his master had in truth composed the favourite lines, which had originated to much speculation; and she reporting it in confidence to her lady, it was in a few days entrusted to the taci∣turnity of the whole neighbourhood. Courtland was repeatedly complimented upon his poetical abilities, and he hesitated not to wear the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays.</P>
<P>It happened about this time that Courtland made one of a large circle which were collected round our
<PB N="100" REF="034162_0099_0FFC6302C3675E50"/>
social board, when the before mentioned lady intro∣duced the subject of the poem, and proceeded with all the loquacity of talkative volubility, to pronounce a panegyric upon our gentleman, as the author. The poet bowed, blushed, and looked silly. Margaretta was evidently pleased; while I, regarding the whole affair, as another <HI>much ado about nothing,</HI> should have passed it without further observation, had I not acci∣dentally glanced the face of Serafina, who was also of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r' party, and whose countenance, in the course of a few moments, expressed the most lively sensations. Her heightened complexion during the conversation, now changing to the clearest white, and now assuming the deepest colouring with which the most impassioned feelings could tinge it. I marked Serafina, but I mark∣ed her in silence; for, from these suspicious appear∣ances, I was induced to fear that the specious manners of our gallant, had made also upon the youthful mind of this young lady, an impression which would be with difficulty eradicated! But I was not suffered to remain long under this deception; our company soon separat∣ed, and only Courtland, Margaretta, Serafina, Mary and myself, remained. The chagrin upon the face of Serafina was still visible, when, standing up with much dignity in her manner, she instantly accounted for the appearance, by which I had been misled.</P>
<P>Addressing Mr. Courtland, she thus expressed herself: "I am, Sir, the friend of Edward Hamilton; we have been educated together, almost from the first moment of our existence, and every secret of his soul is reposed in my bosom. I am not sure that he would approve of what I am about to say; nay, feeling my mind at this present in a great measure governed by indigna∣tion, I am not myself positive, that I am quite right; however, like all angry folks I am hurried on by an impetuosity which I find altogether irresistable. Is it not enough, Sir, that you have supplanted that unhappy young man in his dearest hopes? Is it not enough that you have stepped between him and that hoard of feli∣city which he fondly fancied was treasured up for him?
<PB N="101" REF="034162_0100_0FFA6523F38D9608"/>
but must you also <HI>poorly steal</HI> that pittance of fame, which justice reserved for him? You know, Sir, that you never wrote the piece for which you have been contented to receive the praises of so many admirers. I have at this moment the original lines upon Miss Mel∣worth, which were written by Edward, in my pocket∣book; they were penned upon yonder verdant bank, during Miss Melworth's continuance at New-Haven, while I was prattling by his side. It is true he im∣agines they are destroyed; he requested that I would destroy them; but I have imprudently and unkindly given a copy of them to Miss Predy, and thus they have found their way to the press."</P>
<P>What would I have then given for the pencil of a Hogarth, that I might have sketched the group which my parlour at that instant exhibited. Need I tell thee, reader, that I am not even a descendant of Hogarth's? I trow not; but I add, by way of inform∣ation, that having a mortal aversion to daubing, it is therefore that I pass hastily over every expressive fea∣ture, which was then replete with the deepest meaning, and only observe, that Courtland, almost immediately recovering himself, suddenly seized the outstretched hand of Miss Clifford, and pressing it with much ad∣dress to his lips, burst into an immoderate fit of laugh∣ter, affecting great surprise, that she took the matter so seriously, and declaring that he meant nothing more than a jest, and merely to amuse himself with the sim∣plicity and credulity of lady Clacket.</P>
<P>For my own part, my astonishment at the impu∣dence of the fellow, absolutely struck me dumb; and I suffered him to give his adventure what turn he pleas∣ed, without even the capability of interrupting him! I saw, however, by the altered looks of Margaretta; by a degree of disgust which pervaded her fine counte∣nance, and the pointed reprehension which she darted from her charmingly expressive eyes; from all these auspicious indications, I gathered, that the full time for executing my scheme, was at length arrived, and that the mine being thus accidentally and advanta∣geously
<PB N="102" REF="034162_0101_0FFA6526A03E9F98"/>
sprung, it became me to continue my opera∣tions with all possible expedition.</P>
<P>Courtland, therefore, had no sooner taken his leave for the evening, than without taking the least notice of the rhymes, or their effect, I observed to my daughter—that having long noted with much concern her wasting frame, and impaired constitution, I was at last come to the resolution of bending myself entirely to her wishes; that upon the next morning's visit which we should receive from her lover, I would lead him imme∣diately to my library—that possibly I might have mis∣taken his character, but that I would then enter into a conversation with him, of a nature so serious, as fully to ascertain our man—that I would request her, accom∣panied by her mother, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat herself in the adjoining apartment, where they might be ear witnesses of our discourse—and that if, after the investigation to which I should oblige Mr. Courtland to submit, he should still continue the object of a choice, which would then be so deliberate, I would myself lead her to the altar, at any hour which she should judge most proper; and, furthermore, that I promised on behalf of Mary, as well as in my own name, that we would continue through life, in every event, to partake her felicity, and to gild for her, to the utmost of our ability, every misfortune which might await her.</P>
<P>Margaretta trembled excessively; her complexion now reddened to the deepest dye, and now changed to the most deadly pale! we were fearful that she would faint. Mary addressed her in the most soothing language; this had the desired effect; and, bursting into tears, she raised her clasped hands, while a kind of agonized expression was depictured upon her coun∣tenance, and, ere we were aware, with a sudden and tremulous emotion, quitting her seat, she sunk down upon her knees! sore us. "Oh Sir, oh Madam!" in a broken voice she exclaimed, "spare your child, spare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this trial; your condescension is sufficiently mani∣fested; never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore do I wish to behold the man who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this evening passed your doors; I am convinced
<PB N="103" REF="034162_0102_0FFC63004A796580"/>
that he is poorly mean, that he is capable of the most deliberate baseness; and never shall my soul bind itself in alliance with an unworthy pretender, who can thus pitifully stoop to purloin the fame, with which un∣doubted merit had invested his superior."</P>
<P>"Nay, my love," rejoined Mary, "you are now again too precipitate; would you discard the man of your heart, merely because he is ambitious of adorning him∣self with the poet's laurel? besides, these tears, these looks of anguish, these broken accents, and heart-affect∣ing sighs; these all betray a mind not sufficiently at ease, to make up a determination so important; should you thus hastily proceed, you may possibly repent at leisure. Come to my arms, my daughter—let me press this throbbing heart to the bosom of friendship; let us take time, my love; your father, whose wisdom not seldom leads him through the labyrinth of the human heart, shall prosecute his plan, while we, sum∣moning the aid of mild resignation, abide, with patient acquiescence, the event."</P>
<P>Thus, then, we adjusted our measures; and the returning sun, according to custom, presenting Mr. Courtland, ushered in an hour which I regarded among the most important of my life. My unalterable intention was to constitute Miss Melworth sole heiress of every shilling which I possessed; yet, regarding our spark, in pecuniary matters, as another <HI>Zeluco,</HI> I con∣ceived myself justified in practising a little address, in order to the unmasking an impostor, who, by meth∣ods so unwarrantable, had obtained such hold of the affections of my daughter.</P>
<P>Behold me then, gentle reader, with these impres∣sions, seated in my library, and Courtland, with <HI>un∣blushing effrontery,</HI> lolling upon a sofa before me; listen, also, while with a solemn, but composed coun∣tenance, and in a resolute and peremptory tone of voice, I thus deliver myself.</P>
<P>"I have requested this interview, Sir, in order to obtain your ear upon a very important subject. I ob∣serve that your pretensions to Miss Melworth, notwith∣standing
<PB N="104" REF="034162_0103_0FFC62FDD341B000"/>
your knowledge of our predilection for Mr. Hamilton, are still continued; and I repeat, that no parental friends, ought <HI>unduly</HI> to influence in an affair, which cannot so deeply interest them, as the individuals who are principally concerned; we consent, therefore, supposing Miss Melworth's preference should remain, to yield you her hand, and we assure you that her matrimonial choice shall, in no sort, influence her for∣tunes." Here Courtland bowed exultingly, and I proceeded to say—"But, Sir, it is just, that upon this occasion, I add, that, as Miss Melworth is not in fact, our daughter, she is not by nature entitled to our inheritance. My heart, Sir, my paternal heart, ac∣knowledges for that young lady the strongest affection; but family claims are respectable, and the pride of re∣lationship is seldom wholly eradicated from the bosom. There is now living in a certain metropolis upon this continent, a distant relation of mine, who bears my name; it is true he is rich, but his family is large, and as I am fond, I confess, of establishing my name, the world, in general, will not condemn me, should I de∣vise the greater part of my real estate to this my kins∣man; while prudence directs me to secure to Marga∣retta and her posterity, whatever part of my posses∣sions I shall judge proper to endow her with; and I am positive that Miss Melworth will not accuse me of want of affection for her, whatever arrangements I may be induced to make."</P>
<P>I assay not to describe the agitated alterations, which the countenance of Courtland underwent, during the latter part of my harangue; anger, disappointment, and the deepest chagrin, were marked there; when, starting from his seat, with an indignation but ill con∣cealed, he expressed himself to the following effect: <Q>I was informed, Sir, that you had no relation in ex∣istence; I was informed that Miss Melworth would undoubtedly succeed to your estates; and I was moreover informed, that you had destined a very handsome sum, as a nuptial present, for the husband of that young lady, upon the day of marriage; if I
<PB N="105" REF="034162_0104_0FFC62FC136940E8"/>
am deceived, Sir, though I <HI>adore</HI> Miss Melworth, yet neither my fortune nor my family will admit of my union with a young lady, who, (excuse me, Sir) doth not seem to have <HI>any</HI> well grounded expectations, and who cannot claim a single person in the world, as her natural relation.</Q></P>
<P>It was with difficulty that I stifled my resentment; but, assuming an air of calmness, I returned—"I am ignorant, Sir, who was your informant; but I am con∣fident I have never before explained myself upon this subject, to any one, and I am not answerable for the erroneous conjectures of the busy multitude: But, Sir, you, in your turn, must excuse me, when I say, that I should imagine a person upon the eve of bankruptcy, if he really loved the woman whom he was seeking to affiance to penury, would be happy to find her invested with a share of property, which being independent of his failure, would set her above absolute want."</P>
<P>This was enough; it worked him up to a degree of frenzy; and, clenching his fist, with a menacing air, he approached my seat.</P>
<P>"What, Sir, can you mean? What do you mean Mr. Vigillius? I demand an explanation."</P>
<P>"Compose yourself, Sir," I rejoined, "I am not to be intimidated by those big looks, or that air of haughty defiance. Had you, Mr. Courtland, when you pre∣sented yourself in my family, as a candidate for the affection of my daughter, ingenuously favoured me with a <HI>real</HI> statement of your affairs, I would have used my interest to have adjusted them amicably with your creditors; and had the attachment of Margaretta been permanent, while I regarded you as a worthy, though an unfortunate man, I should, notwithstanding my conditional engagement with Mr. Hamilton, have viewed the matter with tolerable complacency: but, when you pass yourself upon us as a man in affluent circumstances, when you act, in every instance, the de∣liberate deceiver, I should greatly grieve, did I not know that my daughter's eyes were already opened: She, even at this moment, regains her former tran∣quillity.
<PB N="106" REF="034162_0105_0FFC62F9DC446F58"/>
You are no stranger to me. Sir; your <HI>amours,</HI> your <HI>improvidence,</HI> the <HI>ruined state of your finances,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. I have this moment letters in my pocket, from your principal creditors, and I could long ere this have apprized Miss Melworth, had I not judged it ex∣pedient that she should make the discovery for herself—she hath made it, and I am again a happy man."</P>
<P>Courtland's cowardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul now shrunk from my gaze; but assuming, with his wonted finesse, the air of an injured man, as he darted from the library, and from the house, he said, <Q>It is well, Sir, it is well that your connexion with Miss Melworth is your protec∣tion; otherwise I should not fail to call you to a very severe account, for falsehoods and absurdities, which the bosom of malevolence hath doubtless orignated.</Q></P>
<P>From the library, I immediately passed to the ad∣joining apartment. Margaretta hid her blushing face in the bosom of her mother: and while I pressed those beautiful females to my heart, I protested, by the ten∣derness which I bore them, that I was, at that instant, the happiest of human beings.</P>
<P>Margaretta proposed a thousand questions in a breath; and, while she blessed the hour of her emanci∣pation, she begged to learn the residence of the dear family I had mentioned, who, from their affinity to me, she gratefully said, were already imaged in her heart, and to whom she wished speedily to devote the page of tender acknowledgment, for the share they undesignedly had, in liberating a mind which had been so unworthily enslaved. Tapping her cheek, I ex∣pressed my wonder that she too had been deceived; for, my dear, I added, though there is actually, in the city of—, a gentleman of my name, circumstanced exactly as I have stated, yet I am not personally ac∣quainted with him; nor do I know that there is the remotest consanguinity between us, in any other line, than as we are alike descended from the honest couple who had their residence in Paradise.</P>
<P>In fact, not having, in my conversation with Court∣land, absolutely avowed an intention of alienating
<PB N="107" REF="034162_0106_0FFC62F68DB9D310"/>
from Margaretta any part of my estate; only simply suggesting the rationality and equity of such a pro∣cedure, and having fully accomplished my design, I was not anxious to guard my secret.</P>
<P>Courtland, who still continued in our neighbour∣hood, was soon apprized of the stratagem which I had so successfully employed; and such was the egregious vanity of the coxcomb, that he entertained no doubt of being able to reinstate himself in the bosom of Margaretta; to which end, he addressed her by many expostulatory letters; imputing the part he had acted in the library, entirely to surprise, and disavowing ev∣ery tittle of what had been alleged against him; de∣claring, that those calumnies had undoubtedly been fabricated by some friends of Hamilton's, on purpose to ruin him in his love; and, that however she might determine, his inviolable attachment to her would never permit him to be other than the humblest of her <HI>adorers.</HI> It was in vain Miss Melworth assured him, that his real situation, his wishes, or his pursuits, could affect her in no other way, than as she was a general well-wisher to her species; and that, having outlived the esteem she once avowed for him, she must beg leave to decline all correspondence with him in future. No sooner were his letters returned unopened, than he persisted in besieging every door which she entered; and, having once crossed the threshold, his clamorous protestations bore a stronger resemblance to those of a madman, than to a rationally attached lover. Miss Melworth, however, acquitted herself upon every of these occasions, with that cool and determined consist∣ency, which was necessary to the establishment of her character, which confirmed the general sentiment in her favour, and placed the whole affair in its true light.</P>
<P>But many days elapsed, before my girl regained her wonted <HI>self-complacency.</HI> She often lamented the weak∣ness which thus, subjecting her to so humiliating an attachment, had involved us also in the utmost anx∣iety; and not being able to forgive herself, for a time
<PB N="108" REF="034162_0107_0FFC62F4D3282108"/>
she continued to deplore. But the good sense she so eminently possessed, leading her at length to impute her error to inexperience, finally banished every re∣maining regret, and enabled her to pen a letter to Miss Worthington, which I produce as a contrast to that which appeared in my last Gleaner.</P>

<P>NEWS, joyful news! my beloved girl. Your Mar∣garetta is restored to her senses, and she is now the cheerfullest, the most contented, and the happiest be∣ing in the universe. Yes, thanks to the unworthiness of Courtland, my liberated heart is at this moment lighter than a feather; and I can now behold this once formidable man without the smallest perturbation, save what is excited by the recollection of that imbe∣cility, which so poorly subjected me to an indiscretion which must, as often as it is recurred to, suffuse my cheek with the blush of conscious error! The story of my emancipation is too long to relate in the little mo∣ment allowed me, for the post is on the wing, and as my dear Amelia has given me reason to flatter myself I shall soon see her at—, a bare sketch of this happy event shall suffice, while I voluntarily engage to fill up the outlines during some <HI>tete a tete,</HI> which we will sweetly enjoy, in the woodbine alcove, you have so often heard me mention.</P>
<P>For some time, being left by my matchless parents wholly to the exercise of my own reason, I had begun to discover that Courtland was not the faultless be∣ing which my imagination had almost deified. He let slip no opportunity of piqueing Hamilton; he seemed ungenerously to aim at pointing the shaft which so apparently wounded the bosom of my early friend; and his triumphant exultation partook a degree of meanness, at which I felt my bosom involuntarily reluct. Once or twice, too, I looked in upon some poor neighbours of ours, who were struggling with disease and penury, in order, in my little way, to af∣ford
<PB N="109" REF="034162_0108_0FFC62F224C331A0"/>
them what relief my angel benefactor had com∣missioned me to yield; methought his soul was not formed for pity or for sympathy; no tear started in his eye; and while his complaisance induced him to accompany me in my walk, his features gathered a severe and rigid kind of austerity; that gentle and engaging demeanor, for which we have together ad∣mired him, was no more; his air was haughty and forbidding, and he deigned not to pour even the oil of soothing words, into the lacerated bosom of sor∣row! Upon these occasions disgust grew in my soul, and I was conscious that my attachment was gradu∣ally diminishing. A little poem, written by Edward Hamilton, he had the weakness to claim; this also, exhibiting him in a new and disagreeable light, made large inroads unpon that esteem, which, while with you, (not considering, that I thereby violated the du∣ty I owed my revered friends) I had so fondly cher∣ished; but the finishing stroke was reserved for the investigating wisdom of my father. By the dictates of equity Courtland was tried, and he came out—I will not say what he came out. In short, my Amelia, no longer enslaved by that dangerous man, it is not my business to pursue him by invectives; he mingles, in regard to me, with the rest of his species: I owe him no ill-will, and I am only solicitous that no un∣happy young body, not patronized and directed, as I have been, may fall a victim to the wiles which an en∣emy so fascinating may prepare for her.</P>
<P>For myself, my utmost wishes are gratified; joy once more illumines the revered countenances of my parental friends: I am conscious that I have banished anxiety from their bosoms, and this consciousness seems to dignify and render my existence of importance; it is of itself a sufficient compensation for years of suffer∣ing; from a mighty pressure my soul is relieved; every thing wears its accustomed face; I skip about the house as usual, and this dwelling is the same bless∣ed mansion which it heretofore was. Serafina, too, embraces me with returning rapture; and though Ed∣ward

Hamilton, who hath long been absent from our village, may probably reject a heart which hath been capable of so improper an attachment, yet he will al∣low of my sisterly regards; in his fraternal bosom, I shall find an abode of sincerity; and I shall still be in possession of the approbation of my next to divine ben∣efactors, and of the unalterable affection of my much loved Serafina. Possibly also—but whither am I wandering? I forget that the post will be gone; but having at length recollected myself, I hasten to offer my respects to your mamma, and to assure you that I am, with very sincere affection, your ever faithful</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>NEW-HAVEN, <DATE>July 25th, 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>GRACIOUS Heaven, what are my sensations! Never did I expect to address my dear Miss Melworth under a consciousness of having contributed (as the event may prove) to her ruin: But in deed, and in truth, we have not intentionally erred; and surely the tale which I have to unfold, will banish from a mind, where integrity and every other virtue have taken up their abode, a wretch, who ought never to have pro∣faned a temple so sacred.</P>
<P>My poor mother weeps incessantly; she says she shall never know peace again, if you are not enabled to assure her, that tranquillity is restored to a bosom,
<PB N="111" REF="034162_0110_0FFC62EBC5A5C918"/>
where she hath been accessary in planting so sharp a thorn. Listen, my beloved Margaretta, to the recital I have to make; and let the virtues of Hamilton ob∣tain their due estimation.</P>
<P>About six years since, a gentleman by the name of wellwood, was one of the most respectable dwellers in this city; his family consisted only of his lady and daughter, with their domestics; his daughter had been educated with the exactest care, and she was, at eight∣een, a beautiful and accomplished young woman. Just at this important period, Mr. Wellwood paid the great debt of nature; and so deep an impression did this melancholy and calamitous event make upon the mind of Mrs. Wellwood, who was one of the first of women, that after languishing a few weeks, under all the pres∣sure of a rapid decline, she also obtained her passport, resigning her life, a confessed and lamented martyr to grief.</P>
<P>Thus, in a very short interval, the unfortunate Fran∣ces Wellwood saw herself precipitated from a situation the most eligible, with which the dispositions of pater∣nal Providence can possibly endow a young creature, to that of an unprotected orphan; no guardian father, no indulgent mother remained, to direct her steps, or to approbate her movements! She had been accus∣tomed to regard her parents as the source of wisdom; no design had she ever executed, unsanctioned by the parental voice, unpropitiated by the maternal smile; and the authors of her existence had, in every sense, continued the prop and the confidence of the being they had reared. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Wellwood were natives of this city; none of their kindred resided among us: So that the beauteous orphan viewed her∣self as alone in the universe; and when she cast her distracted gaze upon the clay cold tenements of a fa∣ther and a mother; upon those eyes, now for ever closed, which, while the least vestige of life remained, had still darted upon her the most benign and unequiv∣ocal testimonies of affectionate tenderness; upon those lips never again to be unsealed, which had opened but
<PB N="112" REF="034162_0111_0FFC62E8EA25B410"/>
to enrich her with advice, admonitions, directions, or benedictions; when, with folded arms, she contem∣plated those trophies of relentless death, the unutterable anguish of her spirit, depriving her for a time of rea∣son, suspended the operation of the silent sorrow, which afterward reduced her to the very verge of the grave! Not a benevolent heart in this city, but deeply felt for the lovely mourner; never did I see a more pathetic∣ally interesting object. But time, that sovereign phy∣sician, and the soothing of those friends, to whom her virtues and her misfortunes had inexpressibly endeared her, at length effectuated in her bosom precisely that state of tender melancholy, which, in a delicate and sen∣timental mind, is described as finding a luxury in tears; and her youth and an excellent constitution, surmount∣ing the ravages which had been made in her health, she was gradually restored to a pensive kind of serenity.</P>
<P>The effects, of which Mr. Wellwood had died pos∣sessed, exclusive of his household moveables, which were very genteel, consisting altogether of navigation and articles of merchandize, he had directed in his will that they should be immediately converted into ready money; and the gentleman whom he had appointed his executor, with that integrity and dispatch, which are such conspicuous traits in his character, speedily disbursing every arrearage, and adjusting every affair relative to his trust, delivered into the hands of Miss Wellwood the sum of two thousand pounds in cash; this being the whole amount, after such settlement, of what remained of her deceased father's estate; and of this her patrimony, she was, agreeably to his direction, the sole and uncontrolled possessor. Behold her then, before she had completed her nineteenth year, absolute mistress of herself and fortune: Her apartments were elegantly furnished; she was in possession of a hand∣some library, and two thousand pounds in ready spe∣cie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ but her discretion was unquestionable, and no one presumed to dictate to Miss Wellwood.</P>
<P>Just at this crisis, Courtland made his first appear∣ance at New-Haven. His exteriour and deportment,
<PB N="113" REF="034162_0112_0FFC62E741752758"/>
we have mutually agreed, are pleasingly fascinating, and our unguarded sex are but too easily captivated. His arts of seduction must be prodigious. When I see you, I will recount the gradual advances, by which he undermined a virtue, that would have been proof against a common assailant. Hoodwinking her rea∣son, and misleading her judgment by arguments the most sophistical, <HI>he induced her to view, as the result of human regulations, the marriage vow;</HI> it was not to be found in the law of God, and it (or rather, the calling a priest to witness it) was calculated only for the meridian of common souls: True, the institution answered political purposes, and it might be necessary to preserve a character; but for him—his nuptial hour—should it take place previous to the death of a ca∣priciously obstinate old uncle, who was a bachelor, and who had made his succeeding to his estate to de∣pend upon his continuing single, would mark him the most imprudent of men. Mean time, his love for Miss Wellwood was unbounded; he could not possi∣bly exist without her; he could not bear the idea of seeing her hourly exposed to the solicitations of those numerous pretenders, who thronged about her, while he was conscious that he possessed no superior claim to her attention; and surely, as they had the sole dispo∣sal of themselves, they might, in the sight of Heaven, exchange their vows; while that Heaven, which would record the deed, would also sanction and crown with success, a union so pure, so disinterested, and formed so wholly under its own sacred auspices; this trans∣action would in fact constitute their real nuptials, and upon the demise of the old gentleman, they would immediately submit to authorise their union by mod∣ern rites.</P>
<P>Miss Wellwood loved the villain—Horrid wretch!—he succeeded but too well, and she was involved in the deepest ruin! My tears blot the paper—would to God that they could cancel her faults, and serve as a <HI>lethe</HI> for her sufferings. Not a soul was apprized of their intercourse; and so well were their measures taken,
<PB N="114" REF="034162_0113_0FFC62E514669C48"/>
that when, six months after, the young lady disappear∣ed, amid the various conjectures which were formed, not even the shadow of suspicion glanced upon Court∣land; every one expressed, in their own way, his or her wonder, grief, and apprehension; the whole town took an interest in her unexpected removal, and Court∣land was with the foremost to express his astonishment; but as Miss Wellwood was entirely independent, no one was authorised to commence an active inquiry or pursuit.</P>
<P>The attention excited by any extraordinary event, after having its run, at length subsides; and Miss Wellwood ceased by degrees to be the subject of con∣versation; nor hath her strange flight been in any sort accounted for, until two days since, when Bridget in∣troduced into our breakfasting parlour this forlorn female, who, immediately upon fixing her eyes on my mother, sunk down almost breathless at her feet! It is hardly necessary to add, that we instantly raised the hapless orphan, and that after recognizing, with some difficulty, the well-known features of Miss Wellwood, we received from her lips the foregoing particulars.</P>
<P>Upon her quitting New-Haven, she repaired directly to apartments, which had been taken for her by Court∣land, in a distant village; her patrimony, you will not doubt, was relinquished to her betrayer. After sacri∣ficing her honour, every thing else became a trifle. At first, he vouchsafed to support her; but for these two last years, either wanting ability or inclination, she has not been able to obtain from him the smallest sum! Of her furniture, of her valuable library, of every thing she is stripped; and for some months past she hath been reduced to the necessity of parting with her clothes, and of availing herself of her skill in needle work, for the subsistence of herself and three sons, whom she hath borne to Courtland; and the little wretches, with their injured mother, have long been in want of the common necessaries of life! Yet, through all this, she hath been supported, being buoyed up by the hope of an ultimate residence with the father of
<PB N="115" REF="034162_0114_0FFC62E226D187D0"/>
her children: By the laws of Heaven, she regards her∣self as already his wife, while she hath repeatedly, with floods of tears, besought the abandoned man to confer upon her, by the rites of the church, a title so honourable; and, though still repulsed, and often with severity, she hath never despaired, until the tidings that Courtland was on the point of marriage with a young lady, who had abode for some time with us, reached her ears; this heart-rending intelligence pro∣duced her, upon the before mentioned morning, in our parlour; this hath also procured you the sorrow, which so melancholy a recital will doubtless occasion.</P>
<P>The once beautiful form of Miss Wellwood is now surprisingly emaciated; the few past weeks hath made dreadful havoc in her constitution; we assay to pour into her lacerated bosom what consolation is in our power; we have made her acquainted with your char∣acter, with its marked integrity and uniform consis∣tency; and we have encouraged her to hope every thing from a goodness so perfect. The desolated suf∣ferer will herself address you. Alas, alas! what fur∣ther can I say! it is with difficulty that I have written thus far; but this information we have judged abso∣lutely necessary. May God preserve my dear Miss Melworth from so black a villain—every thing is to be feared. For myself, I stand, in my own apprehension, as a culprit before you. Forgive, I entreat you, my sorrowing mother; and with your wonted kindness, for∣give—O forgive—your truly affectionate, and greatly afflicted</P>

by which she might have shaped her course, through an <HI>event-judging</HI> and <HI>unfeeling</HI> world. I am told that your virtues partake the mildest qualities, and that pity, bland and healing, is empress in your breast; if so, sweet mercy must administer there; and you will then not only tolerate the address of an un∣happy stranger, but you will be impelled to lend to the prayer of my petition, a propitious ear. Miss Worthington hath condescended to become my in∣troducer, and she informs me that she hath unfolded to you the story of my woes!</P>
<P>For myself, I write not, most respected young lady, either to exonerate myself, or to criminate an unfortu∣nate man, who hath had the presumption to aspire to such daring heights! Registered in the uncontrovert∣ible records of heaven, the wife of Courtland, in walks so reprehensible, it would ill become me to be found. No, Madam, I write to supplicate, and on my bended knees I am prostrated before you—I write to supplicate you to use your interest in the heart of Courtland, in my favour. Help me, O thou unblemished votary of virtue! help me to reclaim a husband, who, not naturally bad, hath too long wandered in the danger∣ous paths of dissipation; who hath drank too deeply of the empoisoned cup of error; and who, if he is not soon roused from his visionary career, may suddenly be precipitated into the gulph of perdition!</P>
<P>I said that Mr. Courtland was not naturally bad; and believe me, good young lady, I have, in a thousand instances, observed the rectitude of his heart. Early indulgence, and a mistaken mode of education, hath been his ruin; but the amiable qualities which are natal in his bosom, have, nevertheless, through the weeds by which they have been well nigh choaked, oc∣casionally discovered themselves. Yet, whatever are his faults, they can never obliterate my errors; <HI>doubt∣less he observed in me some blameable weakness,</HI> or he would never have taken those unwarrantable steps, which were the consequence of our acquaintance; and now, circumstanced as we are, a failure of duty in
<PB N="117" REF="034162_0116_0FFC62DD8EA67148"/>
him, can never apologize for the want of every proper exertion on my side. He is the father of my children; I have a presentiment that he may be re∣covered to the bosom of equity; and, if he will permit me, I will watch over him as my dearest treasure. Let him but acknowledge the honourable and endear∣ing ties, father and husband; let him but sanction them in the face of the world, and I will soothe his aching head; I will smooth his thorny pillow; and, in every circumstance, in sickness and in health, I will continue that faithful Fanny, whom he hath so often sworn never to forsake, and whom, in the fulness of his heart, he hath called Heaven to witness, he would ever prefer to all created beings.</P>
<P>Perhaps he can no more command the sums which I have yielded into his hands—be it so, they were mine, I made them his, and he had a right to dispose of them—Nay, I think I had rather find him desti∣tute; for such a situation will acquit him of that cru∣elty, with which he is otherwise chargeable on account of his late neglects. What are pecuniary emoluments, compared to that real felicity, which is to be derived from a mutual, a faithful, and an unbroken attach∣ment? I have made the experiment, and I can confi∣dently pronounce it in truth a fact—<HI>that we want but little here below.</HI> Let him know, Madam, that I will draw the impenetrable veil of silence over the past; that we will commence anew the voyage of life; and that if he will at length be just, his returning kindness, by invigorating once more this poor, this enervated frame, will restore alacrity to my efforts; and that I am, in that case, positive, our combined exertions will procure for ourselves, and our little ones, the <HI>necessaries of life.</HI></P>
<P>What can I say? It is for my children I am thus importunate; were it not for their dear sakes, the sto∣ry of my sufferings should never interrupt the felicity of Miss Melworth. No, believe me, no—but I would seek some turfed pillow, whereon to rest my weary head; and, closing forever these humid lids, I would

Innocent little sufferers!—observe them, dearest lady; to you their hands are uplifted—Courtland's features are imaged in their faces, and they plead the cause of equity.</P>
<P>Nor will we, my children, despair—we cannot sue in vain: Miss Melworth being our auxiliary, doubt∣less we shall again be reinstated in the bosom of your father.</P>
<P>Forgive, inestimable young lady, forgive this inco∣herent rambling—distraction not seldom pervades my mind. But grant, I beseech you, the prayer of my petition, and entitle yourself to the eternal gratitude of the now wretched</P>

<P>IT was well that my girl had discarded Courtland from her heart, and that she had almost entirely re∣covered her tranquillity, previous to the receipt of these letters; otherwise, the sudden revolution they would have occasioned, must, in a young and impassioned mind, have uprooted her reason.</P>
<P>Old Mr. Wellwood had been one of the first of my friends; and from his countenance and advice, on my setting out in life, I had derived material advantages. The disappearance of his daughter had much per∣plexed me. I was fearful she was ill advised, but from the idea I had entertained of her discretion, I had not the least suspicion of the truth. Yet she never rushed upon my memory, without giving birth in my bosom to sensations truly painful; and I had been constantly solicitous to discover the place of her retreat.</P>
<P>Thus, under the influence of equity and gratitude, I hope my readers will do me the justice to believe, that in Miss Wellwood's affairs, I found myself nat∣urally impelled to take a very active part. Marga∣retta speedily responded to both the ladies; but

<P>I HAVE my dear Madam, received your pathet∣ically plaintive epistle; and, over the melancholy re∣cital of your woes, I have shed many tears. I lament your sorrows, and I honour the propriety of your present feelings and wishes: but a letter which I yesterday wrote to Miss Worthington, and which she will soon receive, will, I persuade myself, convince you of the indelicacy and inutility of my interference relative to Mr. Courtland. Before the name of Miss Wellwood had been announced to me, I had been con∣vinced of my error, in entertaining the most distant views of a serious connexion with that gentleman; and the preference my inexperienced heart had avow∣ed for him, was eradicated from my bosom.</P>
<P>Doubtless, if the ever honoured guardians of my unwary steps, had not still been continued to me. <HI>en∣snared as I too certainly was,</HI> Miss Wellwood's <HI>wrongs would not have exhibited a solitary trait in the history of the unfeeling despoiler!</HI> You must excuse me, Madam, if I do not adopt <HI>your mildness of expression,</HI> when speak∣ing of a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> whose atrocious conduct hath blasted in their early blow, the opening prospects of a young lady, whose fair mind seems eminently formed for all those social and tender intercourses, which constitute and brighten the pleasing round of domestic life. Surely, Miss Wellwood—yet, sensible that painful retrospection will avail us nothing, I stop short.</P>
<P>But, my amiable panegyrist, though I, myself, am ineligible as a mediatress, between parties whose inter∣ests <HI>ought indeed to be considered as one,</HI> I am authorized to offer you the extricating hands, and protecting arms of those matchless benefactors, who, with unex∣ampled condescension, have dignified the <HI>orphan</HI> Mar∣garetta, by investing her with the title of <HI>their daugh∣ter;</HI>

nor is this an empty title; their parental wisdom, their parental indulgence—<HI>but come and se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> I am commanded to solicit you immediately to repair to an asylum, and to hearts, which will ever be open for your reception. My father, Madam, confesses essen∣tial and various obligations to your deceased parent; and he hath long been anxiously desirous to render the arrears, which were due to Mr. Wellwood, into the hands of his ever lovely representative. The bearer of this letter is commissioned to pay you the sum of fifty pounds, which you are requested to receive, as a <HI>part of the interest,</HI> which hath been, for such a length of time, your due; it may answer your present ex∣igencies, and the <HI>principal</HI> is still in reserve. It is with much pleasure, I avail myself of the orders which are given me, to repeat my solicitations, that you would, without hesitation, hasten to this mansion. An elderly man and woman, who are to return to our village in the next stage, and who have long been our very res∣pectable neighbours, will call upon you at Colonel Worthington's, to take your commands; and if you will be so obliging as to put yourself under their care, they will see you conveyed in safety to one, who, in addition to the general and unquestionable humanity of his character, feels his heart operated upon, in re∣gard to Miss Wellwood, by the ancient and inviolable claims of gratitude.</P>
<P>Mr. Courtland, though not at present our visitor, is still a resident in this neighbourhood; and my father bids me assure you, that every rational step shall be taken, which can be supposed to have the remotest tendency toward the restoration of your peace. He himself will undertake your cause; and as his plans are always the result of wisdom and penetration, he is not seldom gratified by the accomplishment of his wishes. He will seek Mr. Courtland; he will assail him by those invincible arguments, with which equity, reason and nature will furnish him; and should he still remain obdurate, my dear and commiserating father will, nevertheless, aid you by his counsel, and continue
<PB N="121" REF="034162_0120_0FFC62D2511828E0"/>
unto you his protection; he will assist you in educat∣ing your young people, and in disposing of them in a manner, which will render them <HI>useful members of soci∣ety:</HI> In short, no efforts which benevolence can com∣mand, will be wanting, to alleviate your misfortunes. Cheer up then, lovely mourner; the orphan's friend is ours: I predict that the smile of tranquillity will again illumine your grief-worn countenance; and should I yet have to raise to you the voice of felicita∣tion, <HI>good, in that event, will be educed from evil,</HI> and I shall then cease to regret a circumstance, which at present, as often as it is remembered, tinges my cheek with the blush of confusion. Were it necessary, I would add, that no means shall be left unassayed, which may be within the reach of, dear Madam, your truly commiserating, and sincere well-wisher,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MARGARETTA MELWORTH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>TAKING it for granted, that the candid reader will allow for the partiality of a young creature, <HI>whose high sense of common benefits,</HI> and whose gratitude had rendered her almost an enthusiast,—I intrude no com∣ment thereon. Margaretta's letter soon produced Miss Wellwood in our family; and upon the morning af∣ter her arrival, I sat off in pursuit of Mr. Courtland. My most direct course brought me to rap at the door of his lodgings, and as I was rather early, I made myself sure of finding him within. My astonishment, however, was not equal to my regret, when I was in∣formed by his landlady, that a writ of attachment, being the evening before served upon him, at the suit of Mr.—, and he not being able to procure sure∣ties, he was then lodged in the county jail. I hesi∣tated not in regard to the measures which were best to be taken; a few moments produced me in that abode of the miserable; and I found little difficulty in ob∣taining an interview with the prisoner.</P>
<P>Courtland—never shall I forget his appearance—all those airs of importance, which had marked his innate consciousness of superiority, were whelmed in the storm
<PB N="122" REF="034162_0121_0FFC62D0CE531570"/>
of adversity, that had at length burst upon him. His haggard looks proclaimed, that sleep, in her accus∣tomed manner, had forsaken his dreary abode; his dress was neglected; his hair in disordered ringlets hung upon his shoulders: In short, scarce a vestige of the finished gentleman remained; and his folded arms and vacant countenance, as I beheld him unobserved, were almost descriptive of insanity: But the jailer announcing my name, his agonized and unaffected discomposure commanded my utmost commiseration; an expression indicative of mingling confusion, surprise and apprehension, instantly suffused his cheek; and, with extreme perturbation, he exclaimed, <Q>Good God! Mr. Vigillius—this is too much—but, for∣give me, Sir, <HI>the uniformity of your character</HI> will not permit a continuance of the idea, that you are come hither either to reproach or insult me.</Q></P>
<P>"To insult you, Mr. Courtland! God forbid. I come hither rather the petitioner of your favour; and it is a truth, that I at this moment feel in regard to you, all the father predominating in my bosom; but, having matter for your private ear, I must beg the indulgence of this gentleman for a few moments."</P>
<P>The humane keeper withdrew with much civility; and the consternation of our delinquent was unuttera∣ble, while I proceeded to inform him of the early knowledge I had obtained of the commencement and progress of his career; of my information in regard to the ruined state of his affairs; and of my actual cor∣respondence with his principal creditors. "I have opened my business, Sir," I added, "by this exordi∣um, on purpose to let you know how well qualified I am to serve you; and however you may have smart∣ed, while I have thus taken it upon me to probe your wounds, I flatter myself you may be induced to bless the hand, which is furnished also with a specific. In short, Sir, I am this morning authorized to act in your affairs—<HI>a fair plaintiff hath constituted me her attorney, and I come to offer you terms of accommodation</HI>—Miss Wellwood, Sir—" At the sound of this name he
<PB N="123" REF="034162_0122_0FFC62CE6B028750"/>
changed colour, bit his lips, groaned deeply, and vehe∣mently articulated—"<HI>Jesus God, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on me!</HI>" and, as if that injured female herself had been present, he thus continued: <Q><HI>Miss</HI> Wellwood—<HI>lovely, but too credulous fair one—wretched woman!—I have undone thee; but, Madam, my death shall soon present you the only compensation in my power.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"I came not, Sir," interrupted I, "<HI>to point to the defenceless bosom the sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of despair:</HI> If you please, I will read a letter, which was written by Miss Well∣wood to my daughter." I read; and, as I folded the paper, I beheld with astonishment, the tear of contrition bedewing his pallid cheek! "<HI>Welcome stranger!</HI>" he exclaimed—<Q><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>n—injured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint—forgiving martyr I—Yes, Heaven is my witness, that the tenderest affection of which this obdurate heart hath ever been capa∣ble, hath still been the undivided, unalienated possession of</HI> Fanny Wellwood—but, Sir, she knows not the depth of my misery—God of heaven! my crimes have <HI>already precipitated me into the gulph of perdition,</HI> and there remains no remedy.</Q></P>
<P>But not to fatigue my readers by further circumlo∣cution, I found that our gentleman had become as wax in my hand; and I proposed to him, that if I could procure his enlargement, he should retire imme∣diately to my dwelling, where he would meet Miss Wellwood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the nuptial ceremony being <HI>le∣gally</HI> performed, my house should become his castle; that I myself would undertake his affairs, thoroughly investigate every point, and endeavour to adjust mat∣ters with his creditors.</P>
<P>My proposal was accepted, <HI>with the most extravagant and rapturous demonstrations of joy;</HI> and my interest, combined with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a substantial neighbour's, soon liberating the captive, produced him a <HI>happy and a grateful bridegroom.</HI> The rites of the church were per∣formed; not a single ceremony was omitted—while Margaretta and Serafina, blooming as Hebe, and cheer∣ful as the morning, officiated as bride-maids.</P>
<P>Agreeably to my promise, I very soon opened my
<PB N="124" REF="034162_0123_0FFC62CAE0F21118"/>
negociation with the different claimants upon Mr. Courtland. New-Haven furnished me with many auxiliaries; it was sufficient to produce the daughter of Mr. Wellwood, to command, in her favour, the most energetic efforts: We speedily obtained a very advantageous compromise; our debtor was, by the joint assistance of many respectable characters, set up in business; and the deficiencies of nature and education, which we have noted in him, were abundantly sup∣plied, <HI>by the abilities, application, and economical arrange∣ments of</HI> Mrs. Courtland. Every year, a regular divi∣dend of the profits of their business is remitted to their creditors; a large part of the old arrears is discharged; and they bid fair, in the run of a few revolving sea∣sons, to possess themselves of a very handsome compe∣tency.</P>

<Q><L>And now the ripening harvest clustering round,</L>
<L>With fruits mature our well form'd hopes were crown'd.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I AM sometimes wonderfully amused by the vari∣ous comments upon these my lucubrations, which in the course of my peregrinations are frequently pour∣ed into my ear. It must be confessed, that as I jour∣ney from place to place, I am sufficiently solicitous to collect the sentiments of my readers; and that although I am often subjected to extreme mortification in this my anxious pursuit, yet I have, upon some occasions, inhaled, from the voice of the genuine critic, the fine effluvia of well-judged praise.</P>
<P>But during a late tour, which I made to a distant metropolis, I was not so fortunate as to observe that my laurel crown was much indebted to the brighten∣ing hand of fame; for although I then breathed the natal air of the Massachusetts Magazine, yet I found that upon the ear of <HI>the many,</HI> even the name of the Gleaner had never vibrated; and that a considerable
<PB N="125" REF="034162_0124_0FFC62C763C26370"/>
majority of those whose attention he had engaged, seemed more occupied in detecting the <HI>real author,</HI> than in essaying to investigate the merit of his productions! An old lady, (taking off her spectacles, and laying down her knitting-work) informed me she had been credibly assured, that the Gleaner had in fact never been married; that he was a young man, a dweller in Worcester, and that he never having had a <HI>bit of a wise,</HI> it was impossible to tell what to believe.</P>
<P>A <HI>facetious divine,</HI> sitting by, gravely replied, "Well, if the scoundrel has imposed upon the public by a fic∣titious tale, he ought surely to be tossed in a blanket; and I, for my part, am willing to lend any assistance in my power, to deliver a delinquent, so atrocious, to con∣dign punishment."</P>
<P>A sober young woman next joined in the conversa∣tion, proceeding with great solemnity to give in her evidence: She said she had but just returned from New-Haven; that she happened to be there when the story of Miss Wellwood came out; and that she was, by unquestionable authority, positively assured they had never heard the name of Margaretta Melworth, until they saw it in the Magazine; that the Wellwoods, the Courtlands, and even the Worthingtons, (as describ∣ed by the Gleaner) were wholly unknown in that city.</P>
<P>"Pshaw, pshaw, young woman," said a pedant, who had eyed the fair speaker with an air of super∣cilious contempt, "you know nothing of the matter; but ignorance is always forth putting. I tell you that I had the honour of receiving my education at Yale College; I was there at the very period, on which the Gleaner represents his Margaretta as having passed some time in the city of New-Haven, and I more than once saw that young lady at church, and in several private families; it is true that being then but a you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, (for it was my first year in the seminary) I was not very intimate with Miss Melworth, otherwise, I doubt not, I should have been made acquainted with every particular which he records." A testimony so decisive, could not be controverted; the old lady resumed her knitting, and an air of general complacency took place.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="034162_0125_0FFC62C5E196DC98"/>
I cannot help regarding this <HI>hunting after names,</HI> as descriptive of the frivolity of the human mind: No sooner does an anonymous piece make its appearance, than curiosity invests itself in the stole of sagacity, conjecture is upon the rack—Who is he? Where does he live? What is his <HI>real name,</HI> and occupation? And to the importance of these questions, considerations of real weight give place; as if the being able to ascer∣tain a name was replete with information of the most salutary kind. Whereas, if the writing is in no sort personal, and cannot be construed into a libel, a knowl∣edge of the author can be of no moment, neither can a name designate a character. <HI>Facts, real events,</HI> have often been communicated to the world <HI>under feigned names;</HI> and instruction not seldom arrays itself in the decent and alluring veil of allegory.</P>
<P>The business of the reader is to scan the <HI>intrinsic value</HI> and <HI>general tendency</HI> of the composition; if that is considerable, if that is laudable, he ought to leave the author to announce himself under what auspices he shall judge proper.</P>
<P>Passing from these <HI>name-hunters,</HI> I joined a select tea party, when I had an opportunity of hearing the work itself very freely descanted upon; and while I was hum∣bled by the uncandid and satirical disquisition which I underwent, I was proportionably elated at observing that my daughter was as much a favourite in the world at large, as in the village in which she hath been educat∣ed. In Margaretta every one appeared interested; and, however questionable the merit of the Gleaner was deemed, Miss Melworth obtained her full share of applause. A damsel, verging upon thirty, the height of whose feathers was enormous, pronounced the poet∣ry of the Gleaner <HI>pitiful;</HI> declared his essays in general much <HI>below a mediocrity;</HI> and she added, that in her opinion they depreciated as rapidly as the paper cur∣rency of insolvent memory; that his last numbers were <HI>monstrously</HI> unnatural; that the library scene in partic∣ular was quite <HI>outree,</HI> since it was impossible to con∣ceive of a man so <HI>truly polite,</HI> thus passionate; that her
<PB N="127" REF="034162_0126_0FFC62C380683B98"/>
friend Mrs. G—condemned those writings altogeth∣er, and that Mrs. G—having <HI>travelled, and seen the world, must undoubtedly be acknowledged a competent judge.</HI> Yet she allowed Margaretta to be a decent young per∣son; and she doubted not if she had been left entirely to herself, she would have generously chosen the <HI>man of her heart,</HI> whatever might have been the embarrassments in which his <HI>juvenile errors</HI> might have involved him.</P>
<P>"<HI>Juvenile errors!</HI>" repeated a female who sat next her. "Is it possible, Madam, that you can bestow an epithet so gentle upon crimes of so deep a die? O! that our sex were conscious of their true dignity; <HI>that they were just to themselves;</HI> then should we no longer behold the unprincipled betrayer obtaining the confi∣dence of virtue; then would the despoiler, banished from society, be necessitated to press forward to the path of rectitude, and a uniform pursuit of goodness becoming the price of his restoration to the privileges and immunities of a social being, he would be compell∣ed to array himself in the garments of consistent equi∣ty. For my own part," continued the fair rationalist, "I am free to own, however singular it may be deemed, that unblemished virtue is, in my estimation, as essential in a man, as in a woman; and that as <HI>man is commonly the primary aggressor,</HI> I regard a <HI>male prosti∣tute</HI> with even greater detestation than I do an aban∣doned female. I profess myself an admirer of the Gleaner. I conceive him to be a moral writer; and I must own that far from thinking the library scene <HI>un∣natural,</HI> I have conceived it inimitably drawn. <HI>Court∣land</HI> is represented from the beginning as a man ex∣tremely superficial; that shallow waters are not sel∣dom noisy, is a common observation; and it is as true that in silent majesty the great profound may stand collected. Mr. Vigillius, with infinite address, had wrought up to the highest pitch, the sanguine expecta∣tions of his man; he is in fancy placed upon an emi∣nence at which he had long aimed; and having, as he supposed, at length obtained the enviable summit of his wishes, he is suddenly dashed therefrom.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="034162_0127_0FFC62C1F57C42C0"/>
"Is it then surprising to find him off his guard, es∣pecially when it is remembered, that his reasons for keeping measures with the Gleaner were no longer in force? Viewing the matter in this light, I confess, it appears to me rather extraordinary, that his passions discovered <HI>no greater excess.</HI> But, be this as it may, I declare to you, that Margaretta captivates my very soul; that the virtues attributed to Hamilton strike me most pleasingly: I am charmed with the open in∣tegrity, and the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly consistency of the character of that youth; and I cannot but hope that the ensuing Gleaner, recounting his union with Miss Melworth, will give us an opportunity of contemplating the most faultless pair who have ever lighted the torch of Hy∣men, since the lord of paradise received our general mother from the hand of her Creator."</P>
<P>"What in the name of ingenuity," interrupted the lady who was filling tea, "<HI>has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e done with Hamilton?</HI> I protest I am enchanted by that divine fellow; his disdaining to enter the lists with Courtland, and his absenting himself during the pursuit of that unworthy pretender, was a deportment at once dignified, proper and manly. I confess that it hath been no small dis∣appointment to me, to find him in the several last Gleaners but barely mentioned; and I am absolutely impatient to hear of his return from exile, and of the restoration of his hopes."</P>
<P>The lovely sentimentalists here adverted to, will rec∣ollect a conversation so recent; and, from the throng which upon that occasion crowded the levee of Mrs.—, they may possibly recognize the Gleaner; but even in this case, I feel pleasingly assured, that in the bosom of candour, discretion and good-nature, <HI>my se∣cret is perfectly safe,</HI> while I am confident, that by <HI>the many I shall remain untraced.</HI> My amiable panegyrists were unconscious that they delivered their sentiments in the presence of an <HI>interested man, who hung upon their lips, engraving their words in characters indelible upon the tablets of his breast;</HI> yet, as I am happy in an opportu∣nity of rendering to superior merit the tribute of
<PB N="129" REF="034162_0128_0FFC62BF6D6BB750"/>
esteem; so I hasten with alacrity, to pen the acknowl∣edgments of gratitude; and while, in a manner as succinct as possible, I proceed to bring down my nar∣ration to the present period, it is with substantial sat∣isfaction I confess that my hopes are invigorated, and my efforts stimulated, by a knowledge that persons so worthy await, with some impatience, the recital of a catastrophe which hath long since gratified my utmost wishes.</P>
<P>It happened that Mr. Hamilton returned home up∣on the very evening which witnessed the nuptials of Mr. Courtland and Miss Wellwood. Being ignorant of his route, it had not been in our power to follow him by letter; and he was consequently unacquainted with every thing that had passed in our village, during his absence. This plan he had purposely concerted, with an expectation of banishing from his bosom those tender sentiments of Margaretta, which were inconsist∣ent with his peace; and fondly imagining that he had effectuated his wishes, he alighted at the lodgings of Serafina, whither he first repaired, in tolerable tran∣quillity; but, on inquiring for Miss Clifford, being rather abruptly informed by her maid, that her young lady passed that evening in the family of Mr. Vigillius, in order to assist at the marriage of Mr. Courtland, he discovered, in a single moment, the cruel fallacy of those hopes he had so confidently cherished. He was unacquainted with the existence and even the name of Miss Wellwood: It was Courtland's wedding night; he could think of no one but Margaretta; a thousand varying ideas rushed instantaneously upon his mind; all his purposes were broken; and he saw that, so far from accomplishing the laudable end which he had proposed, by tearing himself from the beloved object, he had too probably accelerated his own ruin.</P>
<P>In speechless agony he clasped his hands, and rais∣ing his fine eyes to Heaven, he hastily withdrew to the retirement of his own chamber, where, summon∣ing reason, fortitude and religion to his aid, he en∣deavoured to rally his scattered forces, to recollect
<PB N="130" REF="034162_0129_0FFC62BC328A1470"/>
those resources which, in prospect, had appeared so pregnant with consolation; and, upon this occasion, pressing into his service every <HI>balancing</HI> auxiliary, in a manner becoming the mind conscious of its divine or∣igin, of its transitory abode in tabernacles of clay, and of its beatified and immortal destination—in a man∣ner honorary to philosophy, and honorary to manhood, he sought to make head against those passions which were ravaging all before them, and which were seek∣ing to precipitate him into the abyss of despair! What progress he would have made in this conflict, and on which side victory would have declared, I pre∣tend not to determine; for after the combat had con∣tinued, with various success, from twilight grey, until the sober hour of twelve, the whole phalanx of discre∣tion was thrown into disorder, by the following little harmless scrip of paper, received from the hand of Serafina; true, it bore on its milk-white surface cer∣tain <HI>caballistic</HI> inscriptions, which seemed endowed with magic influence; and Hamilton read with no less ar∣dour than it was penned, the language of friendship.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is scarcely necessary to add, that Edward imme∣diately obeyed this flattering summons: He was at a loss what to conceive, and he was ready to hope
<PB N="131" REF="034162_0130_0FFC62B9BB78DA80"/>
for impossibilities; but a short interval presenting him before the companion of his youth, he had little time for conjecture; and the propitious explanation was no sooner given, than, absorbed in a delirium of joy, he lost sight of every ill, and pronounced himself wholly invulnerable, altogether superior to the shafts of fu∣ture sorrow.</P>
<P>The ensuing morning produced him, the image of rationally complacent happiness, in our bridal circle. He attended Miss Clifford; Mary and myself were addressed by him with pleasing respect; and while he bowed upon the hand of Margaretta, his eye beamed unutterable tenderness; a refined and animated kind of affection, and a glow of ineffable satisfaction, swell∣ed every expressive feature, mantled upon his cheek, and seemed to invest him with supernatural graces: In short, the fine manly open countenance evidently assumed a celestial contour, and the charming youth was never before so completely captivating.</P>
<P>In the beautiful face of Margaretta, mingling sur∣prise and pleasure were agreeably blended; a blush of sensibility pervaded her cheek; and an attachment, which I dare believe will be lasting as her life, gradu∣ally enlisted every faculty of her soul; an attachment, raised upon the superstructure of esteem, entwining a full growth of amity, and finally attaining the hono∣rary wreath of rationally approved love. Such an attachment was alone worthy the bosom of Miss Mel∣worth; and I had the happiness to observe, that her meliorated passions, rectified and confirmed, at length pointed to the centre of true and chastised felicity.</P>
<P>No sooner was she assured of the continued, and even augmented tenderness, and of the confiding friendship of her Edward, than she yielded up her whole heart, without hesitation, to the sweetly fascinating impres∣sion. Sanctioned by duty, authorized by reason, and borne forward upon the feathery sails of white-bosomed hope, she did not see that she ought to blush at avow∣ing those sentiments of preference, which her youthful heart acknowledged; and they were, in truth, as pure
<PB N="132" REF="034162_0131_0FFC62B6C6A6C240"/>
as those which are impressed upon seraphic bosoms, amid the paradise of their God.</P>
<P>During the period which preceded her marriage, she gave and received many visits to and from Miss Worthington. She made many little tours round the country; and, possessing a strikingly commanding ex∣terior, with manners so truly pleasing, she was, of course, followed by a train of admirers. Courtlands, Bellamours and Plodders, of every description, crowded about her; and, assailed on every side by the perni∣ciously enervating and empoisoned airs of adulation, the uniformity of her character was put to the se∣verest test.</P>
<P>Miss Melworth, however, was fully equal to the or∣deal which was thus prepared for her; and she con∣tinued to receive her admirers of every description, in a manner which was truly worthy of approbation. The impassioned feelings of the devoted heart, never contributed, in the smallest degree, to her amusement: She had not to charge herself with inflicting a single moment's unnecessary pain; and no sooner did the serious pretender advance his claim, then his profes∣sions of love, though received with grateful respect, were decisively rejected. Obligations for every hon∣orary testimony, she was free to acknowledge; but she was not ambitious to enlist a train of danglers. Her heart, tremblingly alive to the merits of Hamilton, al∣though the nature of their connexion was not publickly known, was ready, almost indignantly, to resent the officious competition of those, whom her delicacy in∣duced her to consider as intruders. But reason, true to its office, corrected the fervid ebullitions of passion, and always brought her back to that tranquillity of mind, so necessary to the full exercise of her fine tal∣ents. Observation, experience, reason and judgment, these all combined to confirm her in the election she had made; and, on the bosom of serenity, her hours rolled on.</P>
<P>Both the mental and exterior accomplishments of our children were still improving; their mutual at∣tachment
<PB N="133" REF="034162_0132_0FFC62B53A8AB5A8"/>
seemed daily to augment, and the prospect still brightened upon us. We often addressed them upon the importance of the vows they were destined to ex∣change, representing, with all the energy which language could command, the necessity of a permanent and un∣abating affection, to render silken the bands of wedlock.</P>
<P>Expect not, we exclaimed, a continuance of those vernal zephyrs, which will fan the genial flame of your early loves: It is true you may embark upon a sum∣mer's sea, but the unavoidable evils, the vicissitudes, and too probably the storms of life, will arise—rocks and quicksands await the voyager, and eagle-eyed dis∣cretion ought to set at helm, if you would pass safely between extremes, which may be regarded as equally dangerous! Mutual esteem, mutual friendship, mutu∣al confidence, <HI>begirt about by mutual forbearance</HI>—these are the necessary requisites of the matrimonial career; and there is not a virtuous endowment that can fall to the share of mortality, which may not be called in∣to action.</P>
<P>We conjure you to consult each other's humours, dispositions, sentiments, and pursuits—an interval is given you for this purpose: Congenial tastes, congenial spirits, you ought to possess, <HI>or at least a similarity of views is absolutely indispensable, if you mean to secure the social enjoyment of your live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Be not afraid, dear chil∣dren of our fondest hopes, be not afraid to come to the test. Submit with cheerfulness to the most scrutinizing ordeal; the present is your era of experiments. Look well to your <HI>individual faults;</HI> forbear to <HI>emblazon your virtues;</HI> and, if you find you cannot wholly eradicate any little peculiarities, which the imbecility of human nature may perhaps have interwoven with your con∣stitution, examine if you can <HI>tolerate them;</HI> and seek not, at the risk of your future quiet, during these peace crowned days, to shut your eyes upon each other's er∣rors! If you entertain the shadow of a preference for any other object; if your long cherished attachment experiences abatement—shrink not from the voice of public censure—<HI>you are still at liberty</HI>—other pursuits yet open themselves before, you—your most direct step
<PB N="134" REF="034162_0133_0FFC62B238A77AA0"/>
is an open declaration of what passes in the inmost re∣cesses of your bosoms, to parents, who will not fail to patronize and uphold you in every action, which is, strictly speaking, the result of undeviating rectitude.</P>
<P>Reason authorises us at this time thus to address you; but when once the hallowed hour, that shall witness your plighted faith, is past, the transaction of that hour will be indissoluble! Death only can set you free; and we shall then, in one particular, dictate for our children a reverse of conduct. A familiar figure will elucidate our meaning. You are to behold <HI>each other's virtues with a microscopic gaze,</HI> while we shall hardly permit you to glance at a <HI>blemish,</HI> even through the <HI>telescope of affection.</HI> It was to this effect we oc∣casionally, frequently, and solemnly addressed our children, while we were peculiarly happy in remarking, that even to the searching eye of anxious solicitude, not a single moment of apathy, hesitation or regret was at any time apparent.</P>
<P>Thus rolled on the weeks, months, and years, until revolving time produced the promised era: It took place in the last vernal season, when the humid steps of April were on the point of resigning their tear gem∣med empire to the bland and flowery feet of the wreath crowned and odour breathing month of May. Marga∣retta had then just rounded her nineteenth year; and, much sooner than would have been our <HI>uninfluenced wish,</HI> we resigned our lovely charge into the hands of him, who had long been the deliberate choice of her heart.</P>
<P>Arrayed in majesty serene, the morning broke. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of day assumed to our grateful view an uncommon cheerfulness—all nature looked gay—the flowers seemed just expanding with emblematic sweetness—and the birds carolled most divinely.</P>
<P>We were not solicitous to collect a throng about us upon that auspicious day. With happiness innate in our bosoms, the <HI>pomp</HI> and <HI>parade</HI> of <HI>joy</HI> we were con∣tented to spare: and our circle consisted only of those, whose faces we should have contemplated with pleas∣ure upon every rising morn and setting sun.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="034162_0134_0FFC62AFD89B58D0"/>
But though only a select party were summoned to partake our felicity, and to gild, by their presence, our bridal day, yet we were ambitious of diffusing the face of gladness over our village; and we therefore appro∣priated the sums which we might have expended in the flowing goblet, and at the festal board, to the pre∣paring nuptial presents for those who mourned beneath the iron sway of penury, and who, by this well-timed relief, felt their hearts once more attuned to the genial voice of pleasure; who halted to entwine for us the wreath of gratitude, the perfume of which was as the sweetest incense to our souls; and who, bending at the footstool of paternal Deity, supplicated Heaven to confer upon us the choicest blessings.</P>
<P>The bride appeared among us arrayed in spotless white; her robe was a delicate muslin, drawn in many a flower, from the rich variety of her elegant fancy, and neatly wrought by her own fair hands. She be∣held the approach of her wedding day, unconscious of those terrors attributed to her sex. Upon the evening preceding the appointed morning, she entertained us, at our first request, with many of our favourite airs, upon her piano forte. I did not perceive her heart flying through her bodice! and her tremors being of the governable kind, she was all her own agreeable self. What passed between her and her mother, with whom she retired for a few hours, I am yet to learn; but this I know, that the day itself was not ushered in either by fits, or any violently agonized emotions. Vir∣gin delicacy only served to animate, to heighten, and to new point the exquisite beauties which adorn the finest face I have ever seen; and she accompanied us to the altar, where the ceremony was performed, with a sober and chastised expression of complacency, which seemed to say—<HI>I have taken sufficient time to deliberate—I am under the direction of my best friends</HI>—every sen∣timent, every passion of my soul approves the man who is this day to become my husband. Undoubtedly he is every way worthy; I possess his tender and entire affection—his entire confidence. I am assured, I am satisfied; I am happy.</P>

For Hamilton, the unbounded rapture which took possession of his bosom, was blended, however, with a dignified and manly manifestation of tenderness, which served to tranquillize his deportment, and to present him in a state of mind becoming the sacred rites which were to be performed: Yet, when he received the hand of Margaretta, the big emotions of his bosom refu∣sed to be wholly suppressed—"Condescending excel∣lence!" he exclaimed "may He, who thus enriches me, render me worthy of so much goodness." The cere∣mony, excepting this interruption, passed agreeably to its sacred arrangement; and, after the good Urbanius had pronounced the benediction, we adjourned to our own mansion; and, since, what halcyon days, weeks and months have revolved! Not a cloud has yet ob∣scured our horizon.</P>
<P>Last week, Margaretta presented Edward with her first born—it is a male infant. Let me see—elev∣en months of uninterrupted felicity!! Can this last? The present is a checkered state.</P>
<P>Reader, though we bid adieu to Margaretta for the present, I would not have thee lament it too seriously. I know thou art tenderly attached to her; and I there∣fore give thee my word, that if thy acquaintance with me continuest, we will occasionally peep in upon her, and thus learn, from time to time, how matters go on.</P>

<P>I HAVE often contemplated, with serious concern, the prevalency of a trait, which I have been ready to regard as peculiar to human nature; and which, at one time or another, seems to be more or less deep∣ly
<PB N="137" REF="034162_0136_0FFC62AB094DF928"/>
marked in every mind. For my own part, I pre∣tend not to an exemption from the weaknesses to which my species are incident; and it is rather by care∣fully remarking what passes in my own heart, that I make my admeasurement of the feelings and propensi∣ties of others.</P>
<P>But while I confess an equal, and in some instances perhaps a greater degree of culpability, than what I attribute to my neighbour, I may be tolerated in la∣menting a frailty, which is common to all, and in an effort to correct, with that <HI>application</HI> and <HI>avidity</HI> prop∣er to a <HI>responsible</HI> and <HI>probationary</HI> being, the disorders which assail the intellectual world.</P>
<P>The particular feature I have at this time in my eye—or, to express myself <HI>professionally,</HI> the field from which I propose to <HI>glean</HI> the materials for this paper, is the general ingratitude to that <HI>august</HI> and <HI>self exist∣ent Being</HI> from whom they originate, which pervades all orders of men, and is notoriously exemplified in the language and conduct of every son and daughter of Adam! I am free to own, that from a charge which it may be thought I have preferred with somewhat too great boldness, I do not consider the most <HI>uniform Christians, however exemplary their walk in life may have been,</HI> as altogether exempted; and, were it necessary, I could produce instances from their most splendid harangues, to justify my accusation: But as I <HI>revere</HI> the progress in the paths of rectitude, which such have undoubtedly made, and as I <HI>respect</HI> even the <HI>efforts</HI> of duty, I assay not to unveil those infirmities, which they may probably join with me in deploring. But, if we may with propriety criminate even the votaries of piety, the sincere and devout worshippers of Deity, what lengths, in the career of ingratitude, may we not suppose the repining and inconsiderate children of men may have run! How loud are the complaints which every tongue, at one period or another, is found to utter! and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the dispositions of Providence, in re∣gard to themselves, are so obviously pleasing, as to leave them nothing to bewail as individuals, how elo∣quent
<PB N="138" REF="034162_0137_0FFC62A83AC0B1F8"/>
do they become upon the sufferings of others—of the species in general! and they will expatiate for hours upon the miseries of <HI>poor human nature!</HI></P>
<P>The neat built village wears the most thrifty ap∣pearance; the comfortable dwellings, which cluster round, indicate the substantial landholder; the vicissi∣tudes of the year have revolved most propitiously; the golden harvest is gathered in, and a general face of plenty is assumed; yet the untoward circumstances of two or three scattering families, shall become the theme of each rural circle, while they will forget to dwell upon the immeasurable bounty which hath so liberally crowned their autumn, and stored their gra∣naries with a superfluity of good! Would it not be better, if from their abundance they jointly contribu∣ted to restore their oppressed neighbours, and to bid them welcome to the blessings of equality, than thus by their <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y</HI> lamentations, to arraign, at least by im∣plication, the allotments of their common Father?</P>
<P>Behold that pangful sufferer! for <HI>two whole years,</HI> he hath been consigned to the bed of pain; scarce an interval of ease can he obtain—sleep departeth from him, or lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks up his senses in the most restless and fe∣verish slumbers, from which he is roused to a still great∣er susceptibility of anguish; appetite he hath none; he is a prey to continued disquiet; every application for assistance is in vain; and no help remaineth for him! Often is the story of his woes repeated; it is echoed by every voice! all hands are thrown abroad, and to∣ward Heaven the accusing eye is frequently raised! but while the theme of his sufferings becomes an ex∣haustless or standing topic of conversation, amid the lo∣quacity of language, scarce a sentence is found to ex∣press the healthful days which, during <HI>fifty</HI> revolving years, he almost uninterruptedly enjoyed; and scarce a finger is put out, to point to that eternity of bliss, which it is probable awaits him.</P>
<P>The long happy parents are deprived, by some epi∣demical and contagious disease, of the children of their youth! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>—
<PB N="139" REF="034162_0138_0FFC62A5CCFE04F0"/>
the stroke is exceeding heavy; the calamity is insup∣portable; it is almost unparalleled; every image in na∣ture, which is replete with horror, is summoned to <HI>shadow</HI> forth the mighty grief; every lyre is attuned, and every minstrel is ready to fling to the widely-ech∣oing fame-breathing gale the iterated, pity-moving, and long resounding plaints of woe.</P>
<P>For the soft endearments of their infant progeny, the opening bud of reason, which was so fondly marked, the interesting prattle of childhood, the big emotions which swelled the parental bosom, as they beheld the forming virtues clustering in the progressive mind; for the expansive joy they experienced, while they wit∣nessed the rapid advancement to an honorary maturi∣ty; for the rich completion of felicity which crowned their wishes, when they beheld their satisfactory and comfortable establishment; for the marked and grate∣ful acts of duty, they have continued to receive; for for all these various scenes of heartfelt good, which for a series of years have been so richly enjoyed—they are enumerated, it is true, but not as a balance for the pres∣ent evil; far from it—they only serve to point the poignancy of the distressful era, and to swell the fea∣tures of such unheard of misery.</P>
<P>Yet it is a fact, that the removal of these objects of complacency will slope their passage to that grave in which the good old man and woman must lay down; and a reunion with their children, in future worlds, they confidently expect.</P>
<P>Is it possible that he who thus tacitly or indirectly arraigns the designations elanced upon this globe, can believe in the superintendence of an all-wise, all-gra∣cious, all-powerful and paternal God? Certainly he does. <HI>Thou, Lord, hast done this,</HI> is a common expres∣sion; and yet, strange to tell, he is constantly found thus cavilling at the dispositions of the Almighty!</P>
<P>Surely it ought to be remembered, that we see but a part of the immeasurable whole; that he who formed the spirit, can give it, in a single luxuriant moment, fully to partake an ample compensation for years of suffering.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="034162_0139_0FFC62A401FBD3E8"/>
Those families which are yielded to the hard allot∣ments of penurious fortune, experience the most lively satisfaction, as often as the flowery feet of bland and genial charity visit their abodes; they have resources unknown to the affluent; and highly relished is that refection, however homely it may in reality be, which is served up with the sauce of hunger.</P>
<P>Exquisite is the moment of ease to the tortured frame; ineffable are the sensations it partakes; and it is well purchased by the previous sufferings which are its price. Those who have laid their children or other friends in the grave, have perhaps enjoyed them <HI>long,</HI> or <HI>much; "they are not lost, but gone before,</HI>" and in another, and better state of existence, they shall receive them again. I say, then, it is more becoming to en∣deavour to mitigate the ills of life, than by the routine of complaints to be impiously murmuring against the decrees of Heaven, which must indisputably result from a righteous and perfectly consistent arrangement; and I aver, that it is a false calculation which makes the <HI>sum total of human evils more than that balance,</HI> which, upon a fair and open estimation, would appear at the foot of a regular and well digested account, of those pleasurable or peaceful moments, which are the por∣tion of mortality.</P>
<P>But to such a pitch of infatuated absurdity has a per∣suasion of the calamities incident to the present state arrived, that we are absolutely enjoined to hold lightly the most virtuous enjoyments, to be constantly looking for an evil day, and to tremble when we have attained to the summit of our wishes! What would be the feel∣ings of that father whom his child should thus address: "I will forbear to take pleasure in the portion with which you have endowed me. I am momently ex∣pecting the exertions of your power against me. I know that the rod of correction is lifted up, and that you mean to chastise me. I expect <HI>evil and not good</HI> from your hands; and though you have at present gratified me, by putting me in possession of the inherit∣ance for which I have sighed, yet, as I am confident
<PB N="141" REF="034162_0140_0FFC62A1A11982C0"/>
you mean speedily to resume it, I cannot consider it as my own. I am fearful of beholding it in an eligi∣ble point of view; and, knowing you as I do, I shrink from the approaches of that tranquil complacency, which would pervade my bosom!!"</P>
<P>I would rather say, that as I possess much, I will en∣joy much; the <HI>virtuous pleasures</HI> of my soul shall not meet a barrier; freely I will expatiate, nor will I know a boundary, save what rectitude shall throw around me; the present moment is replete with blessings, and though the next may intercept some pleasing view, yet, it is the hand of a Father which will be stretched out, and my ultimate felicity will consequently be con∣sulted.</P>
<P>It is well that the Creator, enthroned in majesty se∣rene, is beyond the capability of adopting that mode of conduct, to which repeated provocations would pre∣cipitate the lapsed nature; it is well that his ways are not like our ways; it is well that he regardeth with a steady eye the creature which he hath made, and that neither the caprices nor the inquietudes of the children of men, can bend the determined purposes of his un∣changing plans.</P>
<P>I have been shocked when I have heard the reason for consolation, which is sometimes offered to the child of sorrow.—"You have suffered much," exclaims the commiserating friend, "many are the ills which you have been called to encounter, and doubtless the pe∣riod of retribution, winged by hours and days of smiling tranquillity, is at hand." Ah! is it then true that we can challenge the Sire of men and angels, as our debtor! most irreverent and impious idea! Surely if our calculations were more accurate, and if we were under the influence of gratitude to the Supreme Being, the genuine breathings of our spirits would be—In every calamity I have been upheld, and often have I partook the enjoyments of life. Was I ascertained that the coming hour would strike me from existence, would utterly annihilate the creature, who hath thus long lived, moved, and been endowed with the powers
<PB N="142" REF="034162_0141_0FFC629E8F9F7F18"/>
of reflection, I should, notwithstanding, have no claims to make upon Him who hath called me into being. It is true, I have experienced my moments of sorrow; but they have been abundantly compensated by innu∣merable felicities, by pleasures scarcely marked, and by gratifications now perhaps forgotten. Witness those indulged and rapture crowned months, when I was cradled by maternal tenderness, and soothed by every blandishment, which generally shapes and strews with flowers the path of the young adventurer; witness all those endearments, those incentives to virtue, and those wife instructions, which cherished, which formed, and which brought forward my youth; witness every aid and protection I have from time to time received; witness the pleasing circle of friends, which so frequently cluster round me, while my ene∣mies find it convenient to stand aloof; witness those expansive hopes, which have continued to illume my days, and to fan with genial influence the feathery hours; witness the months of peace and ease which have been mine—how large their number, when com∣pared to those upon which I have been called to submit to the <HI>severe paroxisms of pain;</HI> witness the many nights I have passed in the most salutary and restoring slum∣bers.—But, having now by me, a volume of essays, that may, in some future period, be brought forward, in one of which I have expatiated upon this theme, I forbear to repeat myself.</P>
<P>And here let us pause for a moment. A succeeding number may take the subject up in a different view, or at least illustrate the beauty and propriety of culti∣vating the most lively sentiments of gratitude to the divine Author of every good.</P>

<P>IT is beyond a doubt, that much depends upon our efforts to cultivate an equal and acquiescent ar∣rangement of the passions. We are certainly too prone to be unmindful of benefits, and to swell, with censurable ingenuity, even to a gigantic stature, the ills of life.</P>
<P>The jaundiced eye will create the hue that does not in fact exist; sources of tormenting anxiety, to the murmuring and ungrateful man, will grow thick upon every bough, while a mind habituated to a retrospect of its privileges and exemptions, will gather, from the same tree, fruits of the most meliorated and delicious flavour. I can hardly conceive of an affliction so complicated, as to drive upon the tumultuous waves of despair, the spirit upon which fortitude hath im∣pressed its image.</P>
<P>The firmly virtuous man will industriously seek the means of consolation; when stripped of all else, he will float buoyant upon the strong plank of resolution; he will revert to the good which is past; he will re∣member the fluctuating scenes of the present state; he will recollect the character of the Sovereign Disposer of events; and he will possess light sufficient to shape his weather-beaten prop, even upon the trackless deep. But how often are these proper and dignified exertions reversed! The mind which is debilitated by enervat∣ing pursuits and irrational hopes, which hath formed
<PB N="144" REF="034162_0143_0FFC6299E8E803F0"/>
the most elevated estimation of <HI>its own deserts,</HI> and which hath consequently plumed its expectation to the highest pitch; such a mind, even in the midst of the most happy arrangement, finds itself a prey to disap∣pointment and disgust; though surrounded by almost every enjoyment, its feelings are palled, and it experi∣ences all the disagreeables of satiety; a stranger to moderation, and unblest by contentment, although marked by success, and crowned by the completion of many hopes, it is, nevertheless, languishing under the domination of murmuring inquietude; often it accuses its God of injustice; and it is frequently found exclaim∣ing—"If I am not, in future worlds, to be rewarded for my sufferings in this, it would have been better I had never known a being!"</P>
<P>We do injustice to ourselves, when we supinely de∣clare, that all this is wholly constitutional; that it de∣pends merely upon the mechanism of the mind; and that persons are born with a yielding, equal, and cheer∣ful disposition, or with a refractory, peevish, ungrateful, and gloomy temper of soul: This general assertion may be convenient for the indolent; but those who assiduously cultivate the virtues, and endeavour to ex∣terminate the offending propensities, which together grow in the soil of their own bosoms, while they allow something to nature, will also acknowledge, that much depends upon the unwearied and uniform exertions, which it is certainly incumbent upon every child of mortality to make.</P>
<P>If the physiognomist justly delineated the mind of Socrates, as that incomparable philosopher assures us he did, we are thus furnished with an illustrious proof of the inestimable acquirements which depend upon, and are produced by, the administration of reason. In truth, there is a sweet pliability in the mind of man, which can familiarize it even with sorrow; ac∣commodating and acquiescent, custom habituates and almost reconciles us to grief; we bend beneath the bursting storm; and though, with the elegant and ex∣quisitely susceptible Philenia, we may "<HI>fling the lorn
<PB N="145" REF="034162_0144_0FFC62965E05B310"/>
pathos to the passing gale,</HI>" yet, becoming experimentally acquainted with the <HI>charms</HI> of <HI>melancholy,</HI> we shall not fail, with that beautiful and plaintive mourner, to gem our sorrows with a brightening tear.</P>
<P>A friend of mine was once in possession of affluence, surrounded by friends; he seemed the favourite of fortune; and it was supposed, that the means of em∣bracing his utmost wishes rested wholly with himself; yet vexatious inquietude seemed the motto of his life; and a prey to chagrin, amid his ample endowments, he hardly ever tasted the felicity of a tranquil mo∣ment! But my friend, by various accidents, was reduced to a state of penury; and I have, in that sit∣uation, heard him declare without the smallest appear∣ance of affectation, even when the last morsel he could command was produced upon his scanty board, that he felt contented and grateful, experiencing that ac∣quiescence in the allotments of Providence, and those agreeable anticipations of futurity, to which he had been a stranger, in those days which had been regard∣ed as the epoch of his prosperity.</P>
<P>In fact, it is amid the clouds which adversity throws around the child of mortality, that the efforts of the mind are called forth, and that all the energetic pow∣ers of the soul are formed to action; and it is also ir∣refragably true, that heart-felt enjoyments depend al∣together upon the cultivation of a philanthropic spirit, upon cherishing sentiments of general complacency in the economy of Deity, in ourselves and others, and in thus embodying (if I may so express myself) the vir∣tues of the mind.</P>
<P>I have at this moment my eye upon two gentle∣men, whom I have personally known almost from their infancy; they are the sons of one man and woman; their education was the same; their hopes and fears were similar; and they commenced the ca∣reer of business with like establishments, like advan∣tages, and like expectations.</P>
<P>Early in life they were both united to deserving females, to females apparently of their choice; and
<PB N="146" REF="034162_0145_0FFC6294DABBDB58"/>
they were thus furnished with every incitement to vir∣tuous perseverance; while the avenues to rational en∣joyment were thrown open before them, and the tran∣quillity of their days seemed insured.</P>
<P>For some time, fortune, liberal of her favours, acted the part of an impartial parent, distributing her emol∣uments with an equal hand; but her various disposi∣tions at length predominating, the similitude of her operations was no more.</P>
<P>Placidius, the eldest of those gentlemen, experienced her frowns; the tide of success began to turn; mis∣fortunes succeeded each other; and without the shad∣ow of a reason, upon which to ground the smallest im∣peachment of his integrity, or a single circumstance, upon which even malevolence could call in question his abilities, he beheld his affairs irretrievably embar∣rassed, his best laid plans frustrated, and himself advan∣cing rapidly to that state of insolvency, which his up∣right soul, glowing with a just and high sense of prob∣ity, deprecated as a most aggravated evil. Gradually the means of business vanished out of his hands; his stock in trade was no more; and even the commodious mansion, which with much ingenuity and taste, though with a proper attention to frugality, he had reared, with the hope that it would still remain in his family, even this habitation became the property of his creditors!</P>
<P>Placidius had ever expressed a great desire to per∣petuate himself in his lineal descendants; and this nat∣ural wish, might in him be designated as his ruling passion: but many revolving seasons passed, ere Placi∣dius hailed the accomplishment of his wishes in this res∣pect; and when at last, his Matilda presented him with her first born son, the chalice of joy which he had but lifted to his lips, was dashed from his grasp, by the sudden death of an infant upon whose little form the traces of longevity seemed inscribed. For this stroke he was wholly unprepared; and, to complete his cat∣alogue of evils, his bosom friend, his long loved, and ever esteemed Matilda—even at a life so precious, the king of terrors too surely aimed his missive shafts! the
<PB N="147" REF="034162_0146_0FFC62927701DD08"/>
icy darts of <HI>indulged sorrow</HI> found their way to the vi∣tal stream of life, and, congealing the purple flow, the virtuous and accomplished Matilda was numbered with the dead.</P>
<P>Placidius now felt as a man; his reason was the forfeit; and the hour which restored this regent to her accustomed operations, only gave her to witness the melancholy void in a mind which had once been the feat of expectations bland and cheering, and which had been enriched by every white winged hope, which rectitude could authorise. Recollection, gloomy recol∣lection returned; dreadful was the contrast with the <HI>past,</HI> which the <HI>present</HI> exhibited! Placidius shrunk from the view; his health became the sacrifice, and for many months he seemed to languish through all the different stages of a gradual and unyielding de∣cline. Fortitude, however, was at last triumphant; a calm, and rational tranquillity succeeded the sub∣siding tumults which had agitated his soul. The restoration of the health of Placidius, was the happy consequence of this change; and he reflected as be∣came a man, a philosopher, and a religionist.</P>
<P>Fortune, too, so far relented as to put it in the power of Placidius to reimburse his creditors; and he was invested with the means of procuring for himself a competency. It is true the splendour of his former prospects can never be restored; but Placidius is con∣tented. "I cannot," said he the other day, "regard life as an evil: I should be most ungrateful, did I not own, that to me it hath been more fruitful of pleasure than of pain. It must be confessed, that for a time I sunk beneath the agonizing stroke; for a time I was wretched! it is true that the blasting of those pre∣sumptuous hopes, which I had arrogantly formed for the meridian of my days, rendered me beyond ex∣pression miserable; but my youth was serenely hap∣py; <HI>for a great length of time</HI> I enjoyed the most pleas∣ing prospects; and though I have laid the wife of my bosom in the grave, yet delicious are the tears which I now shed to her memory; and in the fairest pages
<PB N="148" REF="034162_0147_0FFC628FF4CAF038"/>
of retention, are treasured up the days, months, and years, during which I partook with her the highest state of felicity, which can fall to the lot of mortality, which can be experienced this side that paradise of the blessed, where I shall again meet the virtuous com∣panion, in whose faithful bosom I reposed the fondest hopes and wishes of which my being was capable; where I shall be reunited to a Matilda ever blooming, ever immortal—united too, by ties which will be then indissoluble. And though no son or daughter will gem my parting moments with a filial tear, yet the family of mankind is wide, the children of my adoption are many—from one source we originated, and my bosom feels and owns the great fraternity.</P>
<P>For Agetius, the brother of Placidius, we need scarce do more than reverse the picture. In one even tide of prosperity his commercial transactions have glided on; or if a trifling loss hath sometimes origin∣ated a cloud, his subsequent gains, by presenting abun∣dant compensation, hath speedily dissipated it: As a merchant he is established; his trade is lucrative; eve∣ry year enriches him; he hath lately completed an elegant dwelling; and the amiable and gentle Anna still remains the social partner of his days. His son and daughter possess pleasing exteriors, and improving minds; he hath educated them agreeably to plans which he deliberately formed, and they will soon take rank with the first young people of their circle. Age∣tius hath still possessed an uninterrupted course of health; and no person can recollect any serious mis∣fortune which, as an individual, he hath been called to suffer—yet Agetius always appears anxious, and even perturbed; <HI>he seems fearful lest you should suppose him enjoying a single good</HI>—he will not acknowledge a tran∣quil moment—"<HI>no one can so well say where the shoe pinches, as him who wears it,</HI>" is an adage frequently in his mouth; and he sometimes passionately declares that he wishes he had never been born!</P>
<P>I said that I conceived such manifestations of in∣gratitude peculiar to man; and surely, as far as we
<PB N="149" REF="034162_0148_0FFC628DB2F8ACF0"/>
can observe, the children of instinct fail not to <HI>enjoy</HI> the good which they possess.</P>
<P>In the early days of Placidius and Agetius their minds discovered, to common observation, no essen∣tial difference. One remark I have however gleaned: Agetius, when a boy, attempted not to restrain a haughty, choleric and unreasonable ambition, which might be common to both; and his little heart swelled with indignation, as often as he encountered a superi∣or, in any of those advantages, which are calculated to captivate the inexperienced eye. Upon these occa∣sions, his brother was ever at hand, to present the mir∣ror of reason; and he hath often been heard to say—"Turn, my dear Agetius—turn thine eyes to the mul∣titude below thee, and from thence let thy comparisons be raised; aspire not to such dangerous heights, but learn to estimate properly thy own exemptions, thy own privileges, and to cultivate complacency in that happy mediocrity which is allotted thee."</P>
<P>Placidius early habituated himself to commune with his own heart; he had a serious turn, and was fond of useful information; he endeavoured to moderate his desires, and to entwine, <HI>with every arrangement, the bles∣sings of contentment;</HI> he aimed at regulating his passions, at obtaining a due subordination in the intellectual sys∣tem; and his plan was, to reduce every movement of his soul, and every action of his life, to the domination of <HI>reason, irradiated by genuine religion.</HI></P>

<P>ALTHOUGH I have conceived a very high idea of the ancient and time honoured institution, which is the boast of that respectable fraternity, the
<PB N="150" REF="034162_0149_0FFC628B57F675E0"/>
Free and Accepted Masons; yet, with all due deference to the worshipful brethren, and with the most profound veneration for those occult mysteries, which have re∣mained inexplicable to so many ages, I take the liber∣ty to confess, that I have not been altogether pleased with one or two prominent features in this wonderful order. The first which I shall point out, (which is, I confess, the least commanding) is the contracted spirit which their <HI>practice</HI> not seldom evinces in the <HI>irrational partiality</HI> they discover to men of their own description; whereas, if the advantages of a brother are as great as is insinuated, an <HI>unworthy mason</HI> should take rank in the lowest grade of mankind.</P>
<P>I know that masons make very pompous professions of philanthropy, and that the broad expansive glow, the ties which bind the universal brotherhood, is full often the theme of their lectures. "Upon the unalter∣able region of nature," say they "our most ancient and honourable fraternity is established. As this can never be invalidated, disannulled, or made void; so neither can the obligations that render this extensive society indissoluble ever be abolished or in the smallest degree violated by such as walk in the light of mason∣ry. They that occupy these mansions of truth, unity and joy, which the royal craft has furnished for <HI>social</HI> delight, may as well annihilate themselves, as by the least oblique direction to deviate from the square of integrity, <HI>in any imaginable ratio to diminish the circle of benevolence;</HI> or in the smallest instance to fail of laying righteousness to the line, and judgment to the plum∣met."</P>
<P>All this is very fine; and if realized, it would in∣deed prove the magnificent theatre of simplicity, which they boast they are employed in rearing, to be founded in the most splendid region of the orient beam; and we might in truth expect to see, in <HI>real characters upon this mysterious stage, all the graces and virtues that bless and adorn human nature. The exhibitions upon this theatre would doubtless inspire the most rapturous compla∣cency; and the beholder could not but rejoice, as he marked
<PB N="151" REF="034162_0150_0FFC62890F5097E0"/>
the kindred streams of devotion and philanthropy, refreshing the gardens of paradise, and reinstating mankind in that felicity for which the race was first created, and to which it is asserted the royal laws of masonry are infallibly cal∣culated to restore them:</HI> But rhapsody apart; who does not know, that example hath ever taken the lead, in <HI>point of utility,</HI> of the fairest precepts? Yet I repeat that the <HI>appropriation of benefits to a select party,</HI> is not that commanding or distinguishing trait in the craft of which I <HI>principally</HI> complain; for it is undoubtedly true, that although this <HI>exclusive</HI> disposition is very conspicuously marked in the conduct of the associates of the Lodge, it is not, however, peculiarly masonic; since it more or less characterizes every detached body of men, pervading even the most liberal codes, and thrusting its forbidding front into every congregated society, enlightened combination, or sect of benevo∣lence.</P>
<P>But the grand discriminating peculiarity which I have particularly in view, and which I have regarded as objectionable, is that impenetrable veil of secrecy, they affect to draw over their proceedings. Reason, disengaged from the thin bandeau, with which they assay to hoodwink her, naturally interrogates—If the institution consists with rectitude, and is replete with that salutary influence attributed thereto, why limit its operations within such narrow bounds? Why cir∣cumscribe, either by compass or square, the progress of genuine utility? Why not throw open the doors to investigation? Why not freely communicate? and, unlocking the treasury of knowledge which they may have accumulated, encourage those, whose abilities are adequate, to new light their lamps at a flame so refulgent and so unextinguishable? Who can say, what such an event might produce; what flowers might spring up; what scientific discoveries might be made, if, like that <HI>impartial</HI> orb whose face of fire dec∣orates and dignifies the masonic insignia, the lights they have obtained, were to become generally diffusive, extending their genial countenance, and powerful pat∣ronage
<PB N="152" REF="034162_0151_0FFC628729C41F98"/>
to the meritorious of every age, <HI>sex,</HI> and descrip∣tion? Thus far reason. And should masonic superiori∣ty be once more urged; should it be, as heretofore, again asserted, that the mysteries of the <HI>royal craft</HI> are too sacred for the unconsecrated or vulgar eye; holy <HI>truth, which ought to be the rule of speech, as well as action, and every principle of self complacency, which is confessedly coincident with benevolence,</HI> will reluct at the very idea of subscribing to a concession so humiliating; and the atrocious deviations and paucity of intrinsic worth, or apparent respectability, sometimes exhibited in the char∣acter of the free and accepted mason, will look with a very unfriendly aspect upon every attempt to hallow his person.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in this levelling age, which seems to be marked as the era for destroying all arrogant distinc∣tions, the period is not far distant which may throw down every separating barrier, which may annihilate every aristocratic elevation, and the terms <HI>worshipful</HI> and <HI>right worshipful</HI> may sound as discordant upon the democratic ear of knowledge, as that of monarch, prince, or duke, upon the auditory never of the politi∣cal hero. The literary or the masonic world may hear the voice of liberty; in the empire of arts a Thomas Paine may arise; and we may chance to hear of a <HI>cide∣vant grand master,</HI> who may then be content to relin∣quish this high sounding title, for a more humble and equal appellation; the avenues to the goal of wisdom, being widely expanded, proficients of every descrip∣tion may throng her ample courts, and to every member of the mental <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> the road to lite∣rary honours may be alike open.</P>
<P>But, to be serious—for in fact, while thus engaged in the routine of my occupation, I have, almost without design, wandered through the gate of an enclosure, which the owners have been careful to guard from the approaches of every Gleaner, and at which it was my purpose but barely to glance; I confess, that in thus trifling, I appear rather the inconsiderable idler, than that careful and pains taking being, who is in∣dustriously

employed, in honestly acquiring the means of supporting his pretensions to either a natural or literary existence; but the desultory fugitive, of neces∣sity eccentric, is seldom beside his vocation; and while I beg pardon for an attempt to scale an interdicted wall, I will endeavour to recover my path, to that fair field, to which, in the beginning of this essay, I had intended to shape my course.</P>
<P>But before I proceed a single step further, I will present the reader with a most excellent letter, which carries its authenticity upon its very face; and which, as I am truly solicitous for his entertainment, I very sincerely wish may be productive of as much genuine satisfaction and heartfelt pleasure to him, <HI>or even to her,</HI> as it afforded me; although I must own, it was the as∣sociation of ideas it originated in my bosom, that gave me to leap those hedges, which have served, from the days of the <HI>castle builder</HI> in Paradise, even unto the pres∣ent time, as the ancient boundaries of a <HI>self created order.</HI></P>
<P>I think, however, I shall not again, even by the fas∣cinating charm of philanthropy, be betrayed into walks, which have been so seldom trod, except by the hallowed feet of the close and <HI>uncommunicative</HI> pro∣prietors.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding its influence over my conduct, the <HI>facts</HI> contained in the letter, merit the pleased ad∣miration of every feeling heart: Here follows a faith∣ful copy thereof.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the GLEANER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Cape-Cod, Harwich, <DATE>May 16, 1793.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOWEVER little you may be known in the me∣tropolis of Massachusetts, you will find by this address, that your fame hath reached one of her remote depen∣dants, and that you are <HI>at least read</HI> in the good town of Harwich.</P>
<P>It is not my design to retail the various opinions formed of your writings in this place, nor even to ex∣press my own sentiments thereof; for I have been, for
<PB N="154" REF="034162_0153_0FFC628177DBC630"/>
many years, an irreconcileable enemy to the custom of praising a man to his face; nay, I have not to charge myself, since I could write man, with any thing like adulation, even to a woman, whose understanding I have conceived one tenth part of a degree above par. No, Mr. Gleaner, nothing of all this; and had you been ten times more excellent than you are, though I should have continued reading you with much avidity, yet, had I not a communication to make, which I have long with much impatience expected to see issu∣ing from the press, and which I think will figure, most meritoriously, in the annals of benevolence,—my pen would have still continued dormant.</P>
<P>Regarding you as a man, in whose mental compo∣sition the milk of human kindness redundantly flows, I have for some months formed the design of ushering my little narrative to public view, through the channel of your paper; but observing you engaged in a regu∣lar detail, I have waited until you have conducted your account to a convenient pause; not thinking it proper, or even entertaining a wish, to interrupt you in the midst of such interesting occurrences; but learn∣ing by your last number, which I perused a few even∣ings since, that you have for the present suspended your domestic sketches, and wishing very sincerely, that your Margaretta may figure as pleasingly in the character of a matron, as she has in that of a daughter, I hasten to execute my purpose, lest I should not be in time for an exhibition in the present month.</P>
<P>I experience not the smallest apprehension, that the anecdote I am about to furnish, will be viewed by the general eye as trivial or indifferent. The full period is at length arrived, when the interests of humanity are pretty well understood; and what ever circumstance contributes to throw down the barriers, which have so long divided the common and extended family of man∣kind into sections, circles, or parties, will, I have no doubt, be allowed its full proportion of merit. Well, but as you are a wise man, I take it for granted you are not a lover of prolix exordiums; and as I am sen∣sible
<PB N="155" REF="034162_0154_0FFC627EF8680488"/>
that it is very ill judged, to render the dimensions of the portal more spacious than the building, I shall therefore come immediately to the point.</P>
<P>Captain Mayhew, a very worthy and respectable inhabitant of this town, and who is also a navigator of considerable merit, hath for some time been employed in the whale fishery, by Captain David Pearce, a very useful and enterprising merchant, in the town of Gloucester, commonly called Cape-Ann. He was lately on his return from a whaling voyage, which had been uncommonly prolonged, sinking under a scurvy of a most alarming and distressing nature. That truly shocking disorder, so afflicting in its consequences to the hardy sons of the ocean, seizing him with every indication of a fatal termination, he was reduced to the most deplorable situation; the seamen too, were all languishing under the melancholy effects of this debilitating and mind affecting malady; and there was hardly ability left with a single man, to discharge the duties which were absolutely necessary to their common existence. Captain Mayhew was destitute of every thing, which could be considered as a specific, in this cruel disease; and the salted or dried meat, which they were obliged to swallow, hourly adding to the evil, gave it the most frightful appearance. Thus, in effect disabled, he was reduced to the necessity of putting into the island of St. Helena.</P>
<P>As the island of St. Helena is a domain of the British crown, and as Captain Mayhew was a subject of an American republic, so recently esteemed a rebel∣lious, and now a dismembered territory, the probabil∣ity was that the rights of hospitality would be but <HI>sparingly</HI> exercised toward him; and it was only the urgency of his condition, that determined him to flee for succour to so questionable a port.</P>
<P>It happened for some time previous to the arrival of Captain Mayhew at St. Helena, that the fertilizing showers had been withheld, and the insufferable blaze of day, so genial when qualified by their bland and humid influence, now spread over the face of nature a sick∣ening
<PB N="156" REF="034162_0155_0FFC627D5D5ADCB0"/>
and deathful hue; the thirsty earth visibly mourned the continuity of its intense and gairish rays; no silvery dews bespangled her now yellow mantle; her once velvet covering became parched and heathy; the green vegetable lifted not its head, while even the stinted growth which the ground, thus circumstanced, produced, were by this melancholy drought cut so surprisingly short, as to yield the inhab∣itants but a scanty and even penurious support. This intelligence was as a death warrant to Captain May∣hew and his company; the fruits of the earth were become indispensably necessary to their existence; it seemed impossible to procure them, and they viewed death as inevitable.</P>
<P>Daniel Corneille, Esq. was at that time (and for the benefit of human nature, unless he is removed to a more extensive sphere of operation, I trust that he still is) governor of the island, and Henry Brooks, Esq. deputy-governor. I confess I take a superior pleasure in penning the names of those philanthropic gentle∣men; and if the general tenor of their lives corres∣ponds with their conduct to Captain Mayhew and his comrades, I pronounce, that both their names, and acts of liberality, ought to be engraved "by the con∣centred rays of the sun, upon the azure surface of the heavens."</P>
<P>The governor's private gardens, and grounds of every description, were irrigated by means of aque∣ducts, which conveyed the water several leagues, from those immense reservoirs, the mountains; and in con∣sequence of being thus plentifully accommodated by the fructifying streams, the vegetable productions of nature revelled there, in all the pride and vigour of a healthy and rich maturity; the hand of skilful and assiduous culture had been regularly employed; and in addition to the perfection of the plants, the most lux∣uriant abundance laughed around.</P>
<P>How many there are, who would have reserved the ripened fruit of such unremitted care for themselves, or for others of their own description? How many
<PB N="157" REF="034162_0156_0FFC627A17594F68"/>
there are, who would have trembled at the very idea of admitting a number of strangers, of a grade, too, not accustomed to regularity, into grounds laid out by the hand of judgment, combined with the most ex∣quisite taste, and kept with a very exact attention to order? How few there are, who would have sought out the <HI>diseased captain of an obscure whaleman, and his unpolished associates!</HI> But governor Corneille and his deputy are <HI>citizens—they are citizens of the universe;</HI> and it appears that they are perfectly versed in the rights of humanity.</P>
<P>To their beautiful gardens, Captain Mayhew, with the rest of the sick, were conducted; they were au∣thorized to make an unrestrained use of the necessaries with which they were stored, and a free access was at all times granted them! The sick and debilitated sea∣men strolled at pleasure there; under the wide spread∣ing tree, upon mossy seats they reclined; or, stretching themselves in the foliage crowned arbour, as they slum∣bered upon the enamelled grass, they inhaled the salu∣brious breeze, which, richly impregnated with the restorative effluvia, collected from a thousand health∣ful sources, new strung their nerves, presented the sove∣reign panacea, communicating to the life stream, which had moved with morbid and slow paced languor, the animating and sprightly glow, thus bequeathing to the whole system returning agility. The tall, finely formed and white grooved celery; the medicinal wa∣ter-cresses, with every other antiscorbutic, with benev∣olent avidity were plentifully furnished; and when, by these salutary means, such a measure of strength was obtained, as to enable them to pursue, with renovated spirit and returning alacrity, a voyage which Capt. Mayhew was ardent to terminate; by the same lib∣eral hands they were amply supplied with every veg∣etable, and other requisite, which could be procured in the island of St. Helena.</P>
<P>It is, I conceive, hardly necessary to add, that both the governor, and deputy-governor, disdained a pe∣cuniary reward. The truly philanthropic man, con∣scious
<PB N="158" REF="034162_0157_0FFC62779011F3E0"/>
that he is amply repaid by the feelings of his own heart for every benevolent action, possesseth too much integrity to accept a second recompense; and I have only fervidly to wish, that the Corneille's, and the Brooks's, of every age and country, may still find themselves, from so rich and exhaustless a source, re∣imbursed for every humane and benign interposition.</P>
<P>It seemed as if Capt. Mayhew, who was still in a degree enfeebled by the effects of his disorder, had ob∣tained the particular patronage of some powerfully propitious invisible, whose agency was employed in causing the sons of philanthropy to pass in review be∣fore him. As he proceeded in his course, crossing the equator, he met with several European ships, making their homeward passage from a West-India voyage. By the commander of one of those ships, who was a descendant of the Gallic nation, (and right sorry am I, good Mr. Gleaner, that I cannot give you his name) he was hailed, who finding him a sufferer from a malady so common to seamen in long voyages, most generously insisted on his accepting wines, cordials, vegetables, and live stock, to a very considerable amount; and when Capt. Mayhew ventured just to hint at the propriety of his receiving some kind of compensation, <HI>this humane Frenchman</HI> nobly, liberally, and in the true spirit of <HI>cidevant</HI> French politeness, replied, "<HI>Pardonez moi, Monsieur;</HI> my whole ship and cargo, were they necessary to your relief, should, I assure you, be at your service."</P>
<P>What truly complacent sensations, must gladden the expanded heart, as it contemplates remote indi∣viduals, descendants of the same stock, when acciden∣tally collected, thus benignly engaged in the exercise of good offices; thus benevolently contributing to the relief of their fellow men. But, Sir, I invade not your province; many a scattered reflection you will doubtless glean; while I, satisfied with having publish∣ed this testimony of the gratitude of my townsman, Capt. Mayhew, and with an attempt, to the utmost of my poor abilities, to do justice to characters, which,
<PB N="159" REF="034162_0158_0FFC6275BADCA250"/>
by the divine influence of general munificence, were truly ennobled,—shall content myself with assuring you, that I very ardently wish the success of your lit∣erary career, and that I am your constant reader,</P>

<P><HI>Philanthropy, I know thy form divine</HI>—essence of be∣nevolence, gem of uncreated lustre, originating from, and essentially designating the character of Deity! It is thou who can humanize and dignify the mind upon which thou deignest to glance; in every radiant walk we trace thy agency; thy being is celestial, and thy administration will continue coeval with the exist∣ence of that great First Cause, whose beneficent attri∣bute thou art.</P>
<P>Spirit of energetic influence! with sublime joy I mark thy salutary course; the face of misery brightens at thy approach; the pallid cheek of sickness is tinged by a momentary flush of pleasure; the icy hand of penury suspends its operations; melancholy gladdens in thy presence; and the sons and daughters of sorrow, mingling their meliorated voices, exalt the dulcet song of gratitude; charity, white rob'd daughter of heaven! beneficence, liberal benevolence, genial humanity, and every social virtue, these all compose thy train, and follow where thou leadest.</P>
<P>Thy delight is in the happiness of mankind; thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rectest no land-mark; distinctions, if we except those of virtue, are unknown to thee; and the propitious expansion of thy wishes, not circumscribed by sect, age, country, or even sex, know no other bounds than those which encircle the one grand, vast, and collected family of human nature. The features of thy seraphic coun∣tenance are not peculiarly masonic, Pagan, Hebrew, Jewish, deistical, or Mahometan; and while thou ex∣periencest a rational predilection for the growth of merit, in every soil, thou bendest with mild equality and compassionate benignity upon the world of man∣kind; thou markest, with enkindling rapture, the
<PB N="160" REF="034162_0159_0FFC627369698060"/>
progress of knowledge; thou assistest to unbind the shackles of superstition; thou assayest, with prompt alacrity, to level the promontories of arrogance, to exalt the lowly vallies; to make the rough places smooth, and the crooked straight; and thou rejoicest to behold the emancipated and expanding mind. Thou adoptest not the error, which representeth <HI>genuine information</HI> as administering to the domination of sor∣row; but fully persuaded of the progressive and ulti∣mately happy destination of the creature man, thou art apprized of the eligibility and propriety of his qualifying himself, in this, his novitiate, for the still higher grades, to which he shall ascend. But, while thine eyes beam unusual effulgence at the advancement of enlightened reason, thou hast a tear ready for the sons and daughters of ignorance, and thou disposest the heart to commiserate the sufferer, of whatever description.</P>
<P>Sovereign alleviator of human woes! penetrated with a glow of ineffable complacency, I behold thee amid thy splendid career; thou observest the victim of ad∣versity, and thou stoppest not to examine his local sit∣uation, his complexion, the mental arrangement of his ideas, or the fashion of his garment; it is sufficient for thee, that he is bowed down by affliction, and that he is a branch of that family, which an all-wise Regulator hath placed as probationers upon this earth; immedi∣ately thou originatest a plan for his relief, and thou art blessed in an exact ratio as thou art successful.</P>
<P>The children of indigence are thy peculiar care, and honest poverty is ever sure of thy pitying eye and thy extricating hand; thou enterest, with <HI>correct and equal salutations, the hut of penury; thou allowest for the feelings of the necessitous; thou approachest the poor with respect, and with the utmost delicacy thou art found administering to their wants; the dignity of human nature is never degraded by thee; and man, made in the image of his Creator, however depressed, or sinking under a variety of adventitious evils, faileth not to command thy veneration.</HI></P>

The bosom which is thy domain, is always awake to the bland effusions of tenderness, all thy purposes are liberal; nor dost thou content thyself with the theory of good, for to the ennobling practice of uni∣form munificence, thou art still found stimulating thy votaries.</P>
<P>Blest genius of benevolence! thy dominion shall ulti∣mately become a universal dominion; every malevolent passion shall flee before thee, and the salutary effects of thy extensive operations shall issue in the establishment of <HI>general harmony and never ending felicity.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE sometimes been induced to think, after a serious attempt to investigate the causes which have operated in the production of so many needy de∣pendents of both sexes, upon the bounty of, or civil requisitions made upon, the more successful, system∣atic or industrious members of the community; that the origin of this prevalent evil may generally, with a very few exceptions, be traced to that luxuriant source of folly, an unwarrantable, and irrational kind of pride, or false notions of gentility. Parents, in a certain line, either educate their sons with a view to one of the three learned professions, to a pursuit of the fine arts, or, apprenticing them to the merchant, or sea-faring adventurer, conceive they have placed them in the road, which will most probably terminate in crowning them with opulence and respectability.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly for the interest of society, that a considerable proportion of our young people should
<PB N="162" REF="034162_0161_0FFC626E2B5D5568"/>
be thus appropriated; but when it becomes evident that any particular department is overstocked, a wise father ought certainly to turn his attention to those branches of business, which, by being less occupied, give the youthful candidate a fairer chance of possess∣ing himself of that competency, which is so necessary to the supporting <HI>real dignity</HI> of character. But gen∣tlemen who constitute the particular grade to which I advert, look with disdain upon every handicraft occu∣pation; the whole routine of arts mechanic, or, in other words, useful employments, they regard with sovereign contempt; and they would esteem their sons degraded beyond redemption, if they designated them by any one of those callings, which have been appel∣lated servile. I will just hazard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> question, relative to the propriety of the conjugation, which places <HI>servile</HI> as the adjective of mechanic. Doth not that man bid the fairest for <HI>genuine independence,</HI> who possesses in him∣self the means, whenever he chooses to call his indus∣trious application into action, of supplying himself <HI>even from the wants of others,</HI> with the necessaries of life? And if so, is not the above mentioned <HI>attempt at approximation</HI> extremely heterogeneous?</P>
<P>Prejudices so absurd are particularly ludicrous in a government, the genius of which is, to cultivate as great a degree of equality as will consist with the requisite order and well being of the Commonwealth; and yet, strange to tell, perhaps there is no part of the world, where these unnatural distinctions, so humiliating to the mechanic, and so elevating to the <HI>suppositious</HI> gentleman, are so prevalent, or exist more forcibly, than in some of these American States; and, however obvious it may be, that the predominating bent, or predilection, with which nature may have endowed the boy, ought to claim some share in the determina∣tion; it is, nevertheless, irrevocably decreed, <HI>master</HI> must be prepared to fill a <HI>gentleman like sphere;</HI> and though it is very possible, that not a shilling of prop∣erty may be reserved for his commencing the career of business; yet, however <HI>below a mediocrity</HI> his talen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="163" REF="034162_0162_0FFC626CA8B28888"/>
confessedly are, his education must be conformed to the prospects which are formed of his future destination, to the ideas which his parents have entertained of <HI>family dignity, genteel life,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. During the hours of childhood, by arrangements the most ill judged, an undue exaltation is cherished; by degrees he becomes habituated to consider himself as superior to various classes of his fellow men; his adolescence is passed in frivolous pursuits, and if his maturity is supine, indo∣lent, or destitute of enterprise; if he wants genius, which is a gem as rare as estimable, or even if he is unsuccessful, or unfortunate, (and who does not know that merit cannot always command its wishes?) he is, of necessity, thrown a useless burden upon the public.</P>
<P>I said the probability was, that these unjustifiable prejudices, were more particularly the growth of the American world, than of any other soil; and I have hazarded this conjecture, from the comparison I have been led to make, between a variety of <HI>facts</HI> that have passed under my own observation, and the records of other nations.</P>
<P>"A printer!" said a young spruce coxcomb, who possibly might have had the honour to stand be∣hind a counter, and who was fortuitously jumbled into the stage-coach with Mr. Bache, as it performed its tour of duty through a part of Pennsylvania—"A printer!" and, drawing himself up into a corner of the vehicle, with a supercilious air, he maintained an obstinate silence during the remainder of a journey, which having, previous to his learning the occupation of young Bache, conceived, from his appearance, a high idea of his importance, he had commenced with <HI>insignificant volubility;</HI> but he was ignorant that he with whom he journeyed, was the lineal descendant of the immortal Franklin; otherwise, it may fairly be inferred, that the eclat of his birth, might, in the opin∣ion of this superficial Billy Varnish, have atoned for the mechanical complexion of his profession.</P>
<P>A quondam acquaintance of mine, who is a mer∣chant, not extremely remarkable for the moderation of his desires to accumulate gain, was, some months
<PB N="164" REF="034162_0163_0FFC6269292B4E80"/>
since, on the verge of suffering very considerably, from the undue influence of this very prejudice. He had appointed an intelligent young man to the command of a ship of his, during a long and intricate voyage. It happened, in the course of the navigation which the Captain was directed to pursue, that he found himself necessitated to put into a port in England, at a distance from the metropolis. A variety of circumstances contributed to produce, in the affairs entrusted to his care, a very embarrassing and disagreeable event. He was compelled to depart full speed for London, while his ship continued at anchor in Liverpool. An honest gentleman, with whom he had commenced an intimacy upon the Albion coast, gave him a letter to a trunk-maker in the capital, who, he informed him, was capable of doing him great service. <HI>A trunk-maker! how, in the name of common sense, should a trunk-maker be instrumental in effectuating any important pur∣pose?</HI> A decision upon the Captain's business remain∣ed with the high court of admiralty; <HI>could a trunk-maker influence the determinations of that august body?</HI> The supposition was ridiculous; it could never obtain the smallest degree of attention <HI>in the serious reflections of an American.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain proceeded systematically; he applied to a certain commercial gentleman, well known in America, and whose extensive exports to this new world, supply many of our capital dealers with large quantities of European commodities: By this respecta∣ble auxiliary, he was introduced to the American con∣sul resident in Great-Britain, and the most favourable representation that truth could authorise, was made. The consul, however, received him rather roughly. Fatigued, perhaps, by a multiplicity of applications, he seemed not disposed to interpose his good offices, in order to promote an accommodation of the difficulty; he insisted much upon the ill conduct of American seamen, and observed that if they persisted in thus carelessly involving themselves in ambiguities, and in flying in the face of those adjustments, which had been
<PB N="165" REF="034162_0164_0FFC6266C2AAA1E8"/>
legally made, they must extricate themselves as they could, or be contented to submit to the consequences; and he absolutely declined addressing himself to the lords of the admiralty, or the adopting of any concili∣atory measure, except the Captain returned to Liver∣pool, and brought with him certain evidence, or evi∣dences, which he insisted would be the only proper vouchers of his integrity.</P>
<P>It was in vain that our young adventurer remon∣strated; that he represented the amazing increase of expense, which such a journey, and the detention of the ship, would accumulate to his employer; it was to no purpose he suggested the possibility, that such an enormous expenditure might issue in his own ruin. The consul continued unyieldingly obstinate, and the situation of the Captain was truly distressing! The merchant, to whom he returned to relate the ill suc∣cess of his application, had exhausted the utmost of his influence, in presenting him to the consul; he was not particularly known to the officers of the admiral∣ty, and he declined any further interference in the business.</P>
<P>It was in this moment of cruel anxiety, that the <HI>trunk-maker</HI> occurred to our sea commander; yet the idea was the drowning man catching at a straw; but having got, however, into the narrowest and most dan∣gerous frith, it might be necessary he should ply his oars, if a full sail would not avail him. He could at least deliver his letter; and in a state of vexation, al∣most bordering on despair, he presented himself at the door of the trunk-maker, which opened, only not spon∣taneously, and he found himself in a shop of a spacious and thrifty appearance; it was furnished with a pro∣digious number of trunks, of various sizes, and differ∣ent degrees of elegance; and every arrangement pro∣claimed the <HI>industrious and ingenious mechanic. All this looked very well in its place; but all this, said our agitated young man, is nothing to the purpose.</HI> The master work∣man soon made his appearance, and he regarded the stranger with intelligent civility. The letter of intro∣duction
<PB N="166" REF="034162_0165_0FFC62649F8B3DB8"/>
was produced, which being perused, the trunk-maker with an air of <HI>true old English hospitality,</HI> shook the son of Neptune by the hand. "Walk in, Sir; walk in: You have got a little disagreeably entangled, and I suppose your feelings are all up in arms. To a young man, undisciplined in the school of misfortune, the first onsets of disappointment are truly painful; but the <HI>vicissitudes</HI> of life are as well calculated to furnish a <HI>rational being with hope as with fear; for light as surely succeeds the darkness, as the darkness the light.</HI> Probably you may be at a loss to conceive in what manner my assistance can be of use to you, and as I am at present a little engaged, if you will throw your eye over them loose papers, they may help you to a clue, which may unravel the mystery."</P>
<P>The Captain, it will not be doubted, eagerly availed himself of this permission; and so regular was the dis∣position of the different essays, which this <HI>uncommon</HI> compting-house displayed, that a cursory glance was sufficient to evince the literary abilities of the author; his consequence to certain persons high in office was extremely obvious; and it was apparent that his merit, rendering him necessary to the <HI>great,</HI> had procured him free access to their private ear, and a consider∣able degree of influence over their determinations.</P>
<P>In two days our Captain received an invitation, to dine in a family way with the trunk-maker; and his reception at his patron's was marked with an expres∣sive smile, which indicated a happy termination of his difficulties. <HI>The trunk-maker had conversed with the lords in office, he had made the necessary representations,</HI> and he had obtained explicit and indisputable credentials for his client, who having gratefully partook of a plain, substantial dinner, received with transport his legal per∣mit; and, returning to Liverpool, with a heart glad∣dened by the joys of emancipation, immediately reim∣barked, proceeding with all expedition to prosecute his voyage.</P>
<P>Was I the father of a family, the trunk-maker should be my model; it would be my wish to furnish the open∣ing
<PB N="167" REF="034162_0166_0FFC62630D2F9858"/>
reason of my children with every help which might be necessary to produce them with advantage in the career of knowledge: I would aid them to fig∣ure in the most polished circles; I would stimulate them to every laudably splendid pursuit; the avenues of literature should be thrown open before them, and they should receive as much information as it was in my power to procure for them: But as, with all my gifts, I should be anxious to endow them with the means of obtaining as great a share of <HI>independence</HI> as might consist with humanity, I would certainly aim at investing them with some useful qualification, which might serve them in the <HI>last necessity,</HI> as a fund upon which they might draw sufficient to command the nec∣essaries of life.</P>
<P>But if the male part of our American world are, in the morning of their lives, too much neglected in this respect, females have abundantly more reason to com∣plain. Our girls, in general, are bred up with one particular view, with one monopolizing consideration, which seems to absorb every other plan that reason might point out as worthy their attention: An estab∣lishment by marriage; this is the goal to which they are constantly pointed, the great ultimatum of every arrangement: <HI>An old maid,</HI> they are from infancy taught, at least indirectly, to consider as a contemptible being; and they have no other means of advancing themselves but in the matrimonial line.</P>
<P>Perhaps this is one of the sources, from which orig∣inate the infelicities, too often witnessed, in wedded life; the young creature, ardent in the pursuit, is sed∣ulously employed in displaying all her accomplish∣ments; fearful that if she refuses the present offer, no future suppliant may advance his suit; she throws her∣self away upon the first pretender, though, possibly, he may be very ill calculated to embark with her upon the voyage of life.</P>
<P>Well, but she hath gained her point; and the pur∣suit over, any further efforts would be useless; ev∣ery attempt to please is given up; and the conse∣quences
<PB N="168" REF="034162_0167_0FFC6260481BAB18"/>
which must follow, are too obvious to need the pen of an observer to point them out.</P>
<P>I would give my daughters every accomplishment which I thought proper; and, to crown all, I would early accustom them to habits of industry and order: They should be taught with precision the art economi∣cal; they should be enabled to procure for themselves the necessaries of life; independence should be placed within their grasp; and I would teach them "<HI>to rev∣erence themselves.</HI>"</P>
<P>Marriage should not be represented as their <HI>sumum bonum,</HI> or as a certain, or even necessary event; they should learn to respect a single life, and even to regard it as the <HI>most eligible,</HI> except a warm, mutual and ju∣dicious attachment had gained the ascendancy in the bosom.</P>
<P>If they were thus qualified to administer by their <HI>own efforts, to their own wants,</HI> the probability is, that impressions of this nature, would frequently prevent precipitation, and call into exercise that deliberation which ought, upon all occasions, to be the concomitant of every important step.</P>
<P>Girls, by the avidity and <HI>marked design of their op∣erations, generally defeat their own purposes.</HI> I would have the fair minds of young women occupied by schemes of enjoyment, and by modes of living, which, depending principally upon themselves and their <HI>nat∣ural connexions,</HI> would involve a greater probability of fruition.</P>
<P>Surely the situation of that young creature must be very pleasing, who, by her sweetness of disposition, engaging manners, and many accomplishments, hath endeared herself to the circles in which she moves. Why should contingent events be held up to her view, or made an absolute part of her expectations? and if her hours are passed in endeavouring to augment her little income, whatever it may be, or in cultivating the means which may render her, as an individual, superior to the caprices of those about her, she will certainly be less likely to look out of herself for happiness.</P>

But as I am fond of illustrating my sentiments by example, I will in my next Gleaner produce a little narrative, which, while it will be calculated to eluci∣date, will, I flatter myself, both interest and please; and as I devoutly wish to compensate the reader for the trouble he may take in travelling through these pages, I shall, of course, be highly gratified.</P>

<Q><L>The paths of dissipation lead to death.</L>
<L>Reason her barriers round our footsteps throws;</L>
<L>But headlong folly leaps o'er every bound,</L>
<L>And, taught by pride, the voice of prudence spurns.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN I was a young man, I had a friend, to whom I was particularly attached; we had lived from our boyish years in habits of intimacy; and I was of course an interested observer of all his movements.</P>
<P>His family was distinguished by the marked integ∣rity of even the <HI>minutest</HI> transactions of its individ∣uals; my friend was the youngest born, and every branch, except himself and his eldest sister, were estab∣lished in little families of their own. They were in∣dustrious and frugal, realizing, in consequence of their own exertions, an income which enabled them to live in a genteel style; and as they were of that grade which is termed <HI>well born,</HI> their right to min∣gle in the politest circles was indisputable. But, as I said, living within compass, they were easy in their circumstances, they were affectionate to each other, and always ready to relieve, to the utmost of their a∣bilities, the necessitous of every description.</P>
<P>My friend, at length, after making frequent visits to New-York, presented them with a daughter and a sister, who, though both a beautiful and an amiable woman, had nevertheless received from education, dif∣ferent ideas of life. Gay, unthinking, and profuse by nature, she had never been accustomed to set bounds
<PB N="170" REF="034162_0169_0FFC625AE1894808"/>
to her inclinations; and though she truly loved her husband, she was constantly involving him in difficul∣ties, in order to support a style of life to which his fi∣nances were inadequate, and which, however, the re∣ciprocality of his attachment induced him to exert eve∣ry nerve to maintain. All his connexions saw with pain that his ruin was, by hasty strides, approaching; but the subject was delicate, and it was supposed that an interference would be ineffectual.</P>
<P>A period of seventeen years was marked by dress, equipage, and entertainments, while even the <HI>idea of economy</HI> never once molested the pleasurable arrange∣ments of the fair Amanda. At the expiration of this term, that ill-directed female was seized with the small pox, of which she soon became the victim; and her un∣fortunate companion, (who was before sinking under the united pressure of broken health and spirits, that were doubtless produced by a certainty of the rapid ap∣proach of those calamities which his good sense could not but acknowledge as the procurement of folly) was, in the course of a few succeeding weeks, inhumed in the same vault with the beloved object who had cost him so dear.</P>
<P>Two beautiful females were the issue of this ill-fated marriage; they were not however destitute; for though the effects of the deceased Henry would not give his creditors ten shillings in the pound, yet the rites funere∣al due to the hapless pair, being decently performed, and the hallowed earth that encircled their cold re∣mains embalmed by a filial tear, these lovely orphans were immediately sheltered in the bosom of their friends.</P>
<P>Miss Helen, then just fifteen years old, accompanied the sister of Amanda to her abode in the city of New-York; and Miss Penelope, who had nearly attained her fourteenth year, continued with the relations of Henry.</P>
<P>By way of exemplifying the force of example and the different characters, which the two young ladies from that period assumed, I select, from a correspond∣ence that continued unbroken during their separation, the subjoined letters.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>New-York, <DATE>May 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DECLARE, my dear Pen. I am utterly at a loss to comprehend the meaning of your last letter; and indeed, if I made up my judgment by your general style of writing, I should certainly conclude that you had passed your grand climacteric; but the preach∣ments contained in your last, are absolutely intolerable. Let me see—I want, at this present writing, one month of nineteen; and, if I mistake not, unless she hath very unceremoniously, and even <HI>irregularly,</HI> taken a miraculous leap over my head, my dear, good, sober sister Pen. will not have reached the very grave age of eighteen, until two tardy months have fully meas∣ured their slow paced round! I vow I would relin∣quish the pleasures of the next ball night, just to take a peep at your sweet face, were it only to count the wrinkles which I presume your <HI>deep thinking</HI> must have implanted there!</P>
<P>But to be serious—for once I will endeavour to meet my lovely Monitress (and dearly do I love my Penel∣ope, notwithstanding the air of superiority, and style of reprehension, which her letters assume) upon her own ground; and, by way of responding in the most explicit manner to her catechising epistle, I will take a slight glance at the years which have elapsed since our separation.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in this city, the pressure upon my spirits which I have already recounted to you, and which was occasioned by the lamented death of our parents, by my removal from my native place, and from a sister whom I held dearer than any thing else which this world contained, was almost insupportable. However, the efforts of my kind aunt, with the united good offices of my numerous relations and friends, by degrees restored me to tranquillity; and as I have nat∣urally a great deal of vivacity, my wonted gaiety did not long stand aloof.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="034162_0171_0FFC625563C53A00"/>
Since that period—what hath taken place since that period? Positively I am a mortal enemy to reflection; and my cousin Caroline declares a young lady hath no business with it. So, my dear Pen, you must even re∣ceive, as the sum total of visiting, cards, balls and plays, that fascinating comprehensive little word, <HI>pleas∣ure;</HI> and this very <HI>pleasurable mode of enjoying life,</HI> you, forsooth, presume to christen by the odious term <HI>dissi∣pation;</HI> and my poor superannuated grandmother, and my good old aunt Dorothy are alarmed at the <HI>dissipated</HI> life which I lead; and because, truly, I have no for∣tune, I am to make a mope of myself altogether. I remember this aunt Dorothy of ours never visited my mother but she left her in a fit of the vapours; yet if she had intended us for the humble dependants of some wealthy fool, she should have forbid our receiving such instructions as were calculated to unfit us for so servile a destination, though it is well known that the good old soul was always fond of our attaining every accomplishment.</P>
<P>For my part, though perhaps I may lay in bed un∣til ten in the morning, and though I am not so egre∣gious an ignoramus as to be governed by any of your stupid rules, and plodding regulations, yet I can make shift, when I am up, to work a sprig upon my muslin; to chant to the sound of my piano forte, upon which, by the way, I am much improved; to put on the head-dress which I have received from my milliner with elegance; to figure in any polite assembly; or if, by way of variety, I should choose to pass an hour in my own dressing-room, I have always the prettiest sentimental novels imaginable at hand, to amuse me. Now these qualifications my dear aunt M—, who hath been as the tenderest mother to me, declares are quite sufficient for a person in my line of life; and for cal∣culations of every kind, and all peeps into futurity, as I pretend not to the least skill in astrology, I leave all these occult matters to the wise penetration of my sister Pen.</P>
<P>One thing, however, my dear, that you may not be unnecessarily concerned for your giddy sister Helen,
<PB N="173" REF="034162_0172_0FFC6253DF6F87F8"/>
I will just whisper you—I can, whenever I think prop∣er, procure myself the most genteel establishment. Many sighing swains are in my train; they do full justice, both by words and actions, to my charms; and though they have not yet <HI>ventured an explicit decla∣ration, they wait but my imperial nod to submit themselves implicitly to my decisive election.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, any little articles of which I stand in need, are liberally supplied by the ready generosity of my friends; and I really experience much compla∣cency in my situation, except (you will excuse me, my dear) when I am broken in upon, by your wise lec∣tures; and after all, my dear girl, though you rise early, live systematically, and are as grave as the sanc∣tified wife of a sober country parson, yet I do not see that your prospects are in any sort better than mine; and I think the only advantage which you seem to have acquired over me, is the privilege of document∣ing your eldest sister, whenever your economical dis∣position of your time will permit you to spare an hour.</P>
<P>Say, Pen. is not this true? Have you any matri∣monial scheme in your little head? if you have, do in the name of laughter let us have it. O how delighted I should be to see my dear sage sister soberly pacing to church with one of the still life methodical enamo∣rato's by whom she is surrounded; but I rather think, and if she will indulge me so far, I will say, hope, that she will have judgment sufficient to spare my risibles this trial.</P>
<P>Now I talk of <HI>judgment,</HI> and am impelled by your remonstrances to a kind of retrospect, I recollect but one <HI>capital transaction,</HI> in which my <HI>judgment</HI> hath ever been called into action—You remember, upon the day of my departure from H—, that our uncle Horatio, one hour before I took my leave, presented me with a hundred pounds, advising me to consult my uncle and aunt M—in the disposal thereof: But my indul∣gent benefactors thinking it right that I should have the sole and absolute direction of this sum, I locked it up safe in my dressing-box, until it was proper for me
<PB N="174" REF="034162_0173_0FFC6251B3FEBAE0"/>
to appear in colours, when I expended it in purchasing as complete and as elegant a suit of clothes, if not as rich with blond lace, and every other appendage, as New-York can produce! There, my girl—as I know that my uncle Horatio presented you with a like sum, let us hear if yours was more advantageously disposed of.</P>
<P>In short, dear Pen. I doubt not but I shall make out very well: We shall continue to exhibit the most en∣chanting contrast in the world; I with my <HI>Caro Spo∣so,</HI> (for married I intend to be) figuring in the po∣litest circles, and you soberly sitting at home, darning your husband's stockings, or combing your children's heads.</P>
<P>Yet, however we may continue antipodes in every thing else, I trust that we shall meet in the centre of mutual affection; at least I know, that in all events, I shall still continue your truly attached sister,</P>

<HEAD>Miss PENELOPE to Miss HELEN AIRY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Town of H—, <DATE>June 15th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you very sincerely, my dear Helen, for every tender expression which your letter contains. It is in vain you would assay to smother the feelings of your sisterly heart; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire of natural affection dif∣fuses through your lovely bosom its genial heat. In your last half angry letter, it breaks forth in a variety of places; and I am soothed by the concluding assur∣ance, that you will still continue my tenderly attached sister.</P>
<P>I do assure you, my dear, I have learned to respect the superior rights, with which some months eldership have invested you; and if I have been betrayed into any undue warmth, I am positive that your never questioned generosity will forgive me, when you con∣sider that the fervour of my remonstrances hath pro∣ceeded
<PB N="175" REF="034162_0174_0FFC624ED5430610"/>
entirely from my solicitude, respecting my be∣loved Helen. Perhaps, in my responses, I may again be so unhappy as to offend; but pleasingly confident of the advocate which I retain in your breast, and penning my remarks with all the frankness of sincer∣ity, I shall rely wholly upon your invoked candour, to award my pardon.</P>
<P>No, my facetious sister, <HI>deep thinking</HI> hath not yet furrowed my cheek; and had I no other view than the preservation of the smooth polish of my complexion, it would be incumbent upon me to realize such a men∣tal fund, as would enable me to encounter with due equanimity the ills of life, thereby avoiding that hur∣ricane of the passions, which in its progress not only levels intellectual tranquillity, but makes also dread∣ful ravages in the beauty of the finest face.</P>
<P>I pass over, without a comment, your account, with its sum total, of your manner of passing your time; but I cannot forbear expressing the keen regrets I ex∣perienced, when my honoured grandmamma, reach∣ing forth her hand for the letter, that had been an∣nounced from the child of her affection; from that child, for whom her revered bosom hourly heaves the tender and apprehensive sigh; my feelings, I say, were perfectly agonized, when I found myself necessitated to deny her a gratification which she had fondly an∣ticipated; but when I beheld the venerable matron, matured by wisdom, and dignified by a length of years, every hour of which had been marked by pro∣priety, and elevated by a uniform pursuit of virtue, when I was daily receiving proofs that her strong mind, superior to the decays of nature, was still augmenting its acquirements, was still more invigorated by obser∣vation, could I so far outrage her tenderness, or vio∣late that deference which was due to her experience, as to put a letter, in which she was so unworthily men∣tioned, into her possession? Neither to my aunt Dor∣othy could I be more communicative—Alas! alas! But I will only say, that in the <HI>name of sacred duty I conjure you</HI> no more to pen a line which I cannot read
<PB N="176" REF="034162_0175_0FFC624CF7F43BE8"/>
for persons, who are at least entitled to your inviola∣ble respect.</P>
<P>Our aunt Dorothy, my dear, wishes not to see us dependant upon any one; she is anxious to inspire our bosoms with the <HI>noble ardour of independence;</HI> and, to this end she is solicitous that we should cultivate, to their utmost extent, the talents we possess.</P>
<P>The supplies which you receive from our York friends, are pleasing instances of their generosity; but can you not conceive a <HI>superiour pleasure</HI> in being able to <HI>administer to your own wants?</HI> And do you not re∣member, that agreeably to the course of nature the probability is, that those nearest to you in consanguin∣ity, will be removed; and will you be content to re∣main the dependant upon the caprice, or even bounty, of more distant relations?</P>
<P>You seem to question if the arrangements which I have been directed to make, are more promising. I proceed, my dear, to sketch them for you, and you may then be able to form an accurate judgment, rel∣ative to the comparative eligibility of our prospects.</P>
<P>To begin with the hundred pounds, of which you require an account. It was, agreeably to the direction of my aunt Dorothy, the very next day after its re∣ceipt, put into the hands of a substantial friend, who accounts with me for it, upon legal compound interest; if it had been a <HI>less sum,</HI> I should have disposed of it precisely in the same manner; nor have I ever yet a∣vailed myself of the profits of a single penny arising therefrom.</P>
<P>I will confess to you, that having observed the gen∣eral approbation by which my aunt Dorothy was distinguished, I have regarded her as my model.</P>
<P>My time, since our melancholy separation, hath been divided among my numerous friends; and they are so indulgent as to consider my visits rather as a pleasing circumstance. But though they are in gen∣eral possessed of the means of living genteelly, yet I know that they are in the practice of economy. I do not choose to lessen the patrimony of my cousins; and
<PB N="177" REF="034162_0176_0FFC624A163E5DD0"/>
if I consent to receive any pecuniary mark of their favour, it must be <HI>some trifle,</HI> which I accept as a <HI>me∣mento of their affection.</HI></P>
<P>One month's perseverance, enabled me to rise each morning, mechanically with the sun; and this habit now constitutes one of the pleasures of my life, nor would I relinquish it, was I empress of the globe. I do not neglect to pursue those studies, of which my dear and tender parents were careful to furnish the rudiments; neither my reading, music, draw∣ing, or geography are forgotten; they make a part of the employments of every day; they serve to improve and to polish my mind; and when I have made sufficient progress therein, they will open to me, should there be occasion, new sources of emolument as well as pleasure.</P>
<P>With regard to my apparel, the handsome dividend of that which was the property of my beloved mother, and which fell to my share, is to me an ample supply of almost every article. You will perhaps be surprised, when I tell you I do not wear wrought muslin; it is true, much of my time is devoted to the prosecution of this fashionable and elegant employ; but my younger cousins are ornamented by the product of my industry, while I receive, for every hour of needle work, not necessarily appropriated to myself, a liberal compensation; and, from sums thus accumulated, I not only command the articles of which I am in want, I have not only made handsome additions to my original fund, but I always have in reserve, little sums, which I consecrate to the relief of the necessitous; and, believe me, my dear Helen, that when I am ar∣rayed in my decent plain muslin, or milk white musli∣net, fitted close to my little waist, I feel an innate con∣sciousness of much greater propriety of character, <HI>the mediocrity of my circumstances considered,</HI> than if I was arrayed in flowing robes of the finest texture which ever issued from the loom, in the most variegated tissue which art hath ever yet invented.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="034162_0177_0FFC6246DBDFD188"/>
It is really surprising, how much <HI>order</HI> and <HI>industry</HI> will accomplish; and my retrospect is truly pleasing, when I reflect upon the different pieces of needle work, which I have, in the course of a few years, so advan∣tageously completed. Yet my application is not un∣remitted; and I visit, as often as is necessary, though I must confess, that upon such occasions, my singers are generally employed.</P>
<P>I sometimes mingle in a ball-room; dancing is an amusement of which I am peculiarly fond; and I have <HI>literally murdered</HI> some evenings at cards. An oppor∣tunity of seeing a good play, as they are with us so unfrequent, I have not to charge myself with ever missing; and I am careful to take as much exercise as will conduce to my health. Stimulated by my aunt, in every action, <HI>independence</HI> hath been my ardent pursuit; and I am solicitous to realize sufficient, should I be overtaken by ill health, to prevent my devolving as a burthen upon others.</P>
<P>It is the wish of my aunt, as she hath no immediate descendants of her own, to dedicate her little fortune, upon her demise, to charitable uses; and as she cannot conscientiously gratify this her favourite plan, if she leaves behind her any needy relation, she is the more desirous that her family should, individually, possess the means of obtaining for themselves an honourable support. God forbid, that ever my dear Helen, or myself, should, however remotely, curtail the sums that may be employed for the salutary purpose of wiping the tear from the cheek of indigence.</P>
<P>With regard to my matrimonial expectations, upon which you are so ludicrously playful, I have to say, that the idea of marriage makes no part of my <HI>present</HI> plans; this, my dear, is a <HI>calculation, at which you seem to be abundantly</HI> more expert than myself; it is a con∣tingence which, being within the chapter of possibilities, may, or may not happen; if it should, my arrange∣ments must, in some respects, be different; if it should not, I am contented; at any rate, I esteem it an error; to reckon upon an event, which is at best but uncer∣tain.
<PB N="179" REF="034162_0178_0FFC6244785927D8"/>
I am ignorant, if I have ever yet been regarded with particular attention by the other sex; no one hath <HI>professed himself a candidate for my election; and, however assiduous any gentleman might be, I should not deem myself authorized to set him down as a lover, except his declarations were of a nature the most explicit.</HI></P>
<P>To say truth, I am not over solicitous upon this head; having before me such an example as my aunt Dorothy, I know that respectability, usefulness, tran∣quillity, independence, social enjoyments, and holy friendship, are to be found in a single life; and I am induced rationally to conclude, that if minds are not congenial, if they are not discreetly, mutually, and permanently attached, a state of celibacy is by far the most eligible.</P>
<P>But having, by my circumstantial replies, dimpled the blooming cheek of my charming Helen, perhaps by a smile of pity; I only add, the warm and tender salutations of her sincerely affectionate</P>

<P>Miss Helen put up her pretty lip—her sister's letter was unanswerable; but she was unconvinced, or at least uninfluenced, and they both progressed on, in the different paths in which example had produced them.</P>
<P>The virtues of Penelope were soon distinguished by an amiable man, who was indeed her congenial soul; his fortune was moderate, and his prospects were good: A happy hymen was the consequence, and they con∣tinue as amiable a pair as over exchanged the matri∣monial vow.</P>
<P>The dissipated manners of Helen, her fondness for dress and show, with the extravagant sentiments which she at all times avowed, deterred the sensible part of the male world from cherishing an idea of a serious connexion with a young person whom they conceived
<PB N="180" REF="034162_0179_0FFC6242EE2D8880"/>
it impossible to domesticate. Her uncle and aunt are no more; and their prodigality expended even the patrimony of their children. A similar mode of living hath circumscribed the career of all her boasted ma∣ternal connexions; and Miss Helen, now rapidly ap∣proaching the decline of life, hath become a fixed ap∣pendage to the family of her sister; <HI>a dependant upon the liberality of those, whom she regarded with sensations bordering upon contempt:</HI> But their fine qualities will doubtless render that dependance as silken as possible.</P>

<SALUTE>FRIEND VIGILLIUS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO seriously confess unto thee, that I am not a little pleased with the light which <HI>seemeth</HI> to be within thee; yet feeling myself wonderfully at a loss, what conclusion to draw concerning thee, I am jealous over thee with a godly jealousy. From some precious gems which have been scattered up and down thy publications, I have been ready to think, that thou wert truly of the fraternity of Friends, that thou hadst obtained uncommon lights, and that thy heart was in∣deed
<PB N="181" REF="034162_0180_0FFC624098917978"/>
touched by that seraph, who, taking a coal from the altar, consecrated therewith the till then unhal∣lowed lips of the prophet Isaiah. I must acknowledge that I have assiduously, and perhaps vainly, encour∣aged this idea; and moreover, that when I saw thee lead the comely maiden, whom thou hast cherished, to the altar, after the manner of the profane, with no small inquietude I relinquished my hopes in regard to thee.</P>
<P>But if thou art not a Friend, the question remain∣eth, What then art thou? I believe that thou meanest very well; and that thou hast great goodness of heart at the bottom; but suffer an honest observer to set up for thee a land-mark; take care that thou art not misled thereby, that thou stickest not fast in the quick∣sands of error, or, that following an <HI>ignis satuus,</HI> thou runnest not on shore upon the shoals of misconception. There is a fatal delusion, which is now but too preva∣lent in our country; a delusion, the fundamental principle of which, restoring the lapsed nature, finally returns every individual of the degenerate children of men to the state of felicity which they have so notori∣ously forfeited: Verily I shudder at the bare penning of so pernicious and heterodox a vagary; and I am rendered the more fearfully apprehensive, from a knowledge of the plausibility with which its enthusi∣astic advocates enwrap the soul-destroying heresy! Many paragraphs in thy lucubrations, render me sus∣picious that, under the influence of benevolence, thou hast inhaled the streams which have issued from so poisonous a fountain; but again, from a number of choice sentiments, which thou hast occasionally inter∣spersed, I am led to suppose that thou lookest upon thyself as a responsible being, that thou conceivest thy∣self accountable for thy actions, and that thou ration∣ally concludest thou shalt receive a reward according to the deeds done in the body.</P>
<P>Thus am I continually tossed about in my opinion concerning thee; and thus am I induced to ask thee two important questions. What dost thou think of
<PB N="182" REF="034162_0181_0FFC623D991AE528"/>
the final state of mankind? What are thy sentiments of Jesus Christ, and his redemption? I hope, friend Vigillius, that thou wilt excuse this plainness of speech, and that thou wilt not fail to number, among thy sincere well-wishers and faithful friends,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>As a general answer to friend Doubtful, it may be sufficient to say, that the Gleaner aspireth not to the dignified chair of the theologician; that whatever are his sentiments, he hath entire complacency therein; that he is content with proposing them to the reason of his family, without parading them to public view, or enforcing them upon any one.</P>
<P>Yet, thus called upon, though he doth not propose himself as a sectarian, and though <HI>upon this occasion,</HI> he may not avow the creed of the christian Universalist; he yet craves the indulgence of his readers, while he takes leave to hazard a few remarks.</P>
<P>He is free to own, notwithstanding the despotism of tradition, the prejudices of education, and the predom∣inating sway of revered opinions, that he cannot help regarding that plan as the most eligible, which repre∣sents the Father of eternity, as beneficently planning, before all worlds, the career of a race of beings, who however they were immersed in ills, and from the various vicissitudes of time, plunged into a series of misfortunes, were destined, nevertheless, to progress on to a state of never ending felicity. Jehovah, while thus employed, appears augustly <HI>good,</HI> as well as au∣gustly <HI>great,</HI> and every faculty of the mind rejoiceth to adore the paternal Deity.</P>
<P>We hesitate not to combine, in our ideas of the great First Cause, with an unrivalled sovereignty of power, that unerring <HI>prescience,</HI> which, indeed, seems truly necessary to infinite wisdom, and the fullness of the Godhead.</P>
<P>Would it not be impious, to suppose the Creator originating the vast designs of creation with a dispo∣sition unpropitious to the well being of his creatures?
<PB N="183" REF="034162_0182_0FFC623B6BC39D00"/>
Would it not be most absurdly irreverent, to represent the creature as independent of the power which had formed him, and as unexpectedly escaping from the orbit in which he was placed? Would it not be blas∣phemous to arm him with strength sufficient to frus∣trate the benevolent purposes which primarily gave him existence? Is not that conjecture highly irrational which renders him capable of obtaining the knowledge of good and evil, without the permission of that om∣nipotent Father of universal nature, who had moulded him agreeably to his own designation, who had shaped for him his little part, who had commanded him into being, who could make him whatever he pleased, and who could, in a single moment, recal the animating breath of life, which he is said to have breathed into him? We can easily reconcile, with the arrangements of equi∣ty, allotments which may be clouded with misery, through the lengthening period of many revolving years, provided that the horizon at length brightens upon us, and we are finally presented with a happy termination.</P>
<P>The soul of man is indeed capacious; it can inhale, in one luxuriant moment, such large draughts of di∣vine enjoyments, as may in effect obliterate the pain∣ful remembrance of calamitous centuries; and, in a future destination, we may awake only to the sacred rapture of corrected pleasures. Nor do we know that sentiments of this complexion are unfriendly to the in∣terests of virtue; for, besides the oft cited observation, that rectitude insures its own reward, and that a state of suffering must ever be considered as an appendage to vice; there is a view in which we may still be re∣garded as probationers, as accountable beings; and re∣wards and punishments must ever remain in the hands of our common Father.</P>
<P>We conceive that the system, which, bounding the salutary operations of Deity, confines his gracious in∣terference to an <HI>elected few, while the many are consigned to perdition,</HI> and which considers this awful decree as irreversible, looks with a much more unfavourable as∣pect upon the moral walk, than the denounced senti∣ments
<PB N="184" REF="034162_0183_0FFC6238F19FCFC8"/>
of the Universalist; since it as effectually de∣stroys every exertion to obtain the prize of future be∣atification, for the immutable determination of Jehovah hath unalterably fixed the destiny of every candidate. This discriminating plan, while it merits, in a high de∣gree, the accusation of unwarrantable partiality, (the most reprehensible characters not seldom becoming the objects of its predilection) throws open, at the same time, the widely terrific gates of despair. It is more∣over the parent of schism; and it invests the arrogant mind with every incentive to pride and undue self-estimation, authorizing the supposed privileged being to believe, that the eternal difference, which must of necessity forever exist between himself and the greater part of his fellow-mortals, may justify proceedings against them, for which a jury of philanthropy would find him guilty of high treason against the Rights of Man.</P>
<P>We think the hypothesis, which is ever goading us to the performance of duty, by threats of the uplifted lash, is not a little derogatory to the dignity of our nature. Generosity and gratitude are plants which we wish to see cultivated in the soil of humanity. We would wish to see persons proselyted to the <HI>beauty of virtue;</HI> we would wish to see them in <HI>reality, sensible of the charms of a regular and meritorious life;</HI> in one word, we would wish to see them <HI>embrace innate good∣ness, merely for the sake of its intrinsic worth.</HI></P>
<P>I remember, some fifteen or sixteen years since, be∣ing on a visit to a friend in the capital of the State of Rhode-Island, that chance threw me one evening into a company, in which a certain transatlantic preacher,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author's design in thus expressing herself of a person with whom she boasts the most intimate connexion, will be ob∣vious to every intelligent reader. Concealment, even from the gentleman alluded to, was essential to her plan; and this man∣ner of giving the anecdote, appeared the surest path to the at∣tainment of her wishes.</NOTE> well known for the liberality of his sentiments, made no inconsiderable figure; this gentleman did at that
<PB N="185" REF="034162_0184_0FFC6237534AD3D8"/>
time, and I am told that he still continues to attract much attention in the religious world. Perhaps he may justly be styled the father of the Universalists in this country; and however censurable I may be deem∣ed, I freely confess that I was not, upon the occasion adverted too, displeased at his ideas. Among other curious anecdotes and observations, which constituted his quota of the conversation, he produced a dream, which made no small impression upon my mind; wheth∣er he himself was favoured with this nocturnal vision, or whether it was the privilege of a friend, I do not recollect; nor is it of importance to determine.</P>
<P>Its outlines were as follows: Sleep had spread over the closed eyelids its sombre veil, and the illimitable region of fancy became illumined by a prodigious va∣riety of lustres; myriads of winged beings seemed to flit around; now, the empress of the slumbering hour crowded the scene with motley sketches of every ob∣ject which a teeming imagination could devise; and anon, as if solicitous to vary the entertainment of the night, a splendid solitude gradually pervading, ex∣tended itself around. It was at this moment that an interesting form, robed in spotless white, and moving with inexpressible velocity, presented herself before the sleeper: Dignity was inscribed on her very mien, her aspect was majestic, and every look became expressive of some important designation; in her right hand she grasped a blazing torch, and in her left she bore a transparent vase, which, constantly issuing a copious stream, seemed to possess the properties of a living spring. Hasting along, with inconceivable rapidity, she pressed forward, and it was with difficulty that he detained her, while he humbly requested information respecting the nature of her office and employ; briefly she replied, "Know, inquisitive mortal, that, commis∣sioned by the Ancient of Days, I go forth, with this flaming torch, to light up a conflagration which shall consume the heaven of heavens, while the exhaust∣less fountain in my left hand shall pour forth a flood, whose waters shall utterly extinguish the devouring,
<PB N="186" REF="034162_0185_0FFC623480432768"/>
fires of Tartarean hell; and, know also, that when my mission is accomplished, then will the era be produced, in the which our God shall recognize <HI>some disinterest∣edly sincere worshippers."</HI></P>
<P>The consternation produced by this astonishing piece of information, dispelled the somnific influence of the drowsy goddess; and the reflections which it originated in his bosom, must occur to every serious mind.</P>
<P>I have been amazed when I have listened to the declarations of those, who have protested, that if a state of retribution was not in reserve, they would em∣bark, with a full sail, upon what they have termed the ocean of unlicensed pleasure, and that they would take in large draughts of illicit gratifications!—Surely, such persons have never yet awaked to the best enjoy∣ments of life—are yet to receive the perceptions, which alone can entitle them to a rank among the dignified order of rational beings.</P>
<P>Independent of every future consideration, how se∣renely rolls on the days of that individual, who is so∣licitous to employ his time, his talents, and his abili∣ties of every description, in a manner calculated to do honour to himself, and to conduce to the best interests of his fellow mortals!</P>
<P>View the well regulated family; no sooner do their eyelids unclose, than their grateful orisons spontane∣ously and individually ascend the vaulted skies; with the first uprising of the orient beam, they are assem∣bled in the neatly furnished parlour, where, from the sacred oracles, a portion for their improvement and consolation is selected; where their common teacher, in words fitly chosen, energetic and concise, and in a manly and endearing tone of voice, offers up their unit∣ed and early thanksgivings, supplications and praise, to the universal Sire of angels and of men.</P>
<P>This separate and collected intercourse with Heaven, will constitute them reciprocal guards upon themselves and each other; they will be cautious of offending; their words and their actions they will consider, and
<PB N="187" REF="034162_0186_0FFC62322CCA7DE0"/>
they will be anxious to conduct as persons privileged by a frequent access to the Sovereign Disposer of events.</P>
<P>The domestic departments will be filled in an allot∣ted and regular manner; the affairs of the household will go smoothly forward; the individuals will recip∣rocally assist each other; and plastic order, with af∣fectionate harmony, will preside among them. They will look abroad, and, finding a complacency in com∣municating good, they will feel it their interest, as well as their duty, to relieve, to soothe, to succour, and to support, to the utmost of their ability, the suf∣fering sons and daughters of men; and while thus en∣gaged in mitigating foreign woes, in extending the extricating hand, they will find that the blessings of heaven-born peace have become natal in their bosoms.</P>
<P>In the varied and interesting offices of social life, they will cheerfully engage; they are apprized of what their characters demand of them; and the hap∣piness of their extensive connexions, they are careful to promote. As members of the community, they will discharge with propriety their parts, and they will ever reflect the highest honour upon their coun∣try. When they are overtaken by the unavoidable calamities incident to the present mode of existence, in every affliction, they will naturally pour out their spirits in prayer: This is a privilege which will meli∣orate their sufferings; and, accustomed to address the great Origin of being, they will hasten with alac∣rity to the throne of grace. Whatever may be their employments or amusements, in the course of the day, or during the closing evening, being careful to com∣bine innocence withal—they will gladly turn from every inferior or trivial pursuit, and when the empire of night is commencing, they will re-assemble in the peaceful apartment, that will be thus consecrated, and, by the mouth of their revered head, they will perform the evening prostrations of their devoted spirits, wor∣shipping with sincere hearts, enumerating the multi∣plied blessings of the day, and offering up their ming∣ling
<PB N="188" REF="034162_0187_0FFC62304DB3E770"/>
hallelujahs, thanksgivings and adorations. Their errors, of whatever nature, they will deplore with con∣trite hearts; but with child-like dispositions they will approach, and they will be confident that their august Father, who pitieth their infirmities, bendeth to their supplications a gracious ear. Calm, grateful, and disburthened of their heaviest load, they will retire to present their separate ejaculations, and they will com∣mit themselves to the slumbers of the pillow with heart felt tranquillity.</P>
<P>The theme is copious; I have rapidly hurried along; I could dwell untired upon the charms, and the un∣questionable utility, attendant upon the present hours of an unoffending and useful life. But the fear that I may again exceed the pages, with which I am in∣dulged by the obliging Editors of the Magazine, for∣bids my expatiating further.</P>

<Q><L>Then are the shafts of disappointment barb'd,</L>
<L>When of her well form'd hopes the soul is robb'd.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>"ALL <HI>is not right at Margaretta's"</HI>—said my poor Mary, some nights since, as she laid her head upon her pillow. It was an involuntary expres∣sion, and from the fullness of her heart it escaped her: She would gladly have recalled it, or at least have pal∣liated its effects, but it was too late, for the impression was indelibly made—<HI>all is not right at Margaretta's!</HI> Her words reverberated through the inmost recesses of my soul; they seemed to possess a deadly power, which, at a single blow, annihilated the serenity of my bosom. A thousand painful ideas rushed in a moment upon my mind, and they originated the most alarm∣ing and affecting conjectures.</P>
<P>I had observed, that a kind of pensive melancholy had for some time clouded the fine open countenance of my wife; that her wonted equanimity was inter∣rupted; that her slumbers were disturbed and broken;
<PB N="189" REF="034162_0188_0FFC622E32E4F9F8"/>
and that the admirable regularity of her move∣ments were evidently discomposed. As I possessed a perfect confidence in her prudence, I had forborne to press her upon so distressing a change, well knowing, that whenever it was advantageous or proper, discre∣tion would not fail of prompting her to pour into my ear the sorrows of her heart.</P>
<P>Maternal affection had armed her with an anxious and vigilant attention to her daughter; she had for some months marked a visible alteration in her child; the dimpling smile of complacency no more sponta∣neously welcomed her approach; thick glooms en∣circled her brow; and while she visibly struggled to preserve appearances, the tenor of her soul was ap∣parently lost! Whenever Mary occasionally looked in upon her Margaretta, if her visit was unexpected, she was sure to find her bathed in tears; and the apologies which she seemed to study, but ill concealed the discomposure of an agonized bosom.</P>
<P>Mary, with all her penetration, could not divine the cause of an event, which she so greatly deplored; she imagined that her daughter was in possession of every thing which could conduce to the most pleasing kind of tranquillity; and she conceived that the grateful affections of her heart ought to be in constant exercise. Competency beamed its regular, mild, and equal blessings upon her; her infant was not only lovely and promising, but he seemed almost exempted from those disorders, which are usually attendant upon his imbecile age; her own health was uniformly good; and though Edward Hamilton partook, of course, the morbid contagion of her grief, yet he was still the pensively pleasing and entertaining companion.</P>
<P>Mary concluded, that nothing remained, but for Margaretta to re-assume the accustomed equability of her temper, in order to the perfect restoration of that sunshine, which had for a season illumed her hours; and tenderly interested, while her heart was torn by anxiety, she could not forbear to interrogate—but the only replies she could obtain were sighs and tears,
<PB N="190" REF="034162_0189_0FFC622B5B035050"/>
interrupted by broken assurances, that indeed she was—she was very happy; and that she supplicated her dear Mamma to put upon every appearance the most candid construction. Her mother, however, made wise by the observations she had collected from books, from the study of her fellow mortals, and from a large share of natural discernment, could not be thus easily deceived.</P>
<P>Curiosity was, upon this occasion, her smallest in∣ducement; and she trembled at the impervious dark∣ness of a cloud, which she rationally apprehended involved the dearest hopes of her Margaretta! Baffled in repeated attempts to fathom a mystery, which had yielded her bosom a prey to the keenest anguish, she changed the mode of her attack; and, addressing her daughter by letter, in the language of discretion, in the language of tenderness, she penned the feelings of her soul.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mrs. HAMILTON.</HEAD>
<P>IS it possible for Margaretta Hamilton to conceive her mother a calm spectator of that corroding inqui∣etude, which is gradually and too surely undermining the peace of a child, who is, she had almost said, dearer to her than any other human being? As I have not been stimulated by an idle wish to obtain your secret, I am hurt that my inquiries have proved so ineffectual. Can Margaretta wish to veil herself from the eye of the guardian friend of her early years? Believe me, I seek only to probe the wound, that I may the more assuredly arrest the progress of the envenomed poison, and be enabled to judge what prescription may operate as a specific.</P>
<P>But, for the tender age of innocence, the advice of the physician is the superstructure of conjecture; and in this instance I am necessitated to follow the example of the benevolent practitioner, at all hazards assaying to throw in something, which may possibly preserve the opening life of those budding joys, the growth of
<PB N="191" REF="034162_0190_0FFC6228EF92E4E0"/>
which I had fondly hoped to have watched, until I had gratulated their confirmed maturity.</P>
<P>When we gave our Margaretta to Edward Hamil∣ton, <HI>we conceived that we had yielded her to the man of her heart;</HI> and, believing him to be every way worthy, we congratulated ourselves upon the establishment of the felicity of our child. What, my love, can have produced a change so affectingly agonizing? When∣ever you <HI>appear</HI> tolerably composed, it is <HI>evident</HI> that you are <HI>acting</HI> a part.</P>
<P>I tremble lest your father should penetrate the thin disguises which you assume; and, sanguine as his ex∣pectations in regard to you have been, it is difficult to say, what serious consequences his disappointment might produce.</P>
<P>Oh, my child, my soul is torn by the most fearful conjectures! will you not endeavour to assuage the sorrows of my heart? will you not at least relieve me from the pangs of suspense? Can it be, that Mrs. Hamilton is so far subjected to sexual weakness, as to have delivered herself up to the most alarming cha∣grin, merely because, perhaps, she receives not from the husband such <HI>adulatory devoirs</HI> as distinguished the lover? Surely I ought to regard this idea as inad∣missible; and yet, the strongest minds may have their moments of imbecility; and, my Margaretta, all accomplished, all lovely as she is, must nevertheless still be considered as a young and inexperienced woman.</P>
<P>If this is indeed the source of your perturbed anxiety, I persuade myself that some such reflections as the following, will ere long awaken you to reason.</P>
<P>It is impossible to change the order of nature. De∣lighted admiration of pleasing novelties, is the sponta∣neous growth of every bosom; a second view finds us more calm; a third, a fourth, may possibly rouse us to pleasure; but a constant repetition will create that indifference, which will constitute a perfect contrast to the keen edge of our new-born feelings. The impas∣sioned ardours of the soul must of necessity subside;
<PB N="192" REF="034162_0191_0FFC62260314D568"/>
<HI>they are but created to expire:</HI> But I pity the mind which prefers not the calm rational affections that suc∣ceed, to all the hurricane of the passions.</P>
<P>Love, as it is commonly described, is undoubtedly a short-lived being; it is a luxurious glutton, that in∣variably gormandizeth to its destruction; but from its perfumed ashes ariseth a star-gemmed soother, that the wedded pair may either crush in the birth, or agree to cherish, as the security of their mutual happiness. Esteem may sometimes be traced as the <HI>parent,</HI> but I think it will be found that it is oftener the <HI>offspring</HI> of love. Young esteem, entwined by smiling confidence, enwreathed with sweet complacency, how fragrant is its rosy breath, how necessary to the hymeneal career, and how much is it in the power of the affianced friends to render its existence permanent!</P>
<P>Behold your Edward in a large circle of ladies; doubtless, he is all attention; his features are animat∣ed; and if they are young, beautiful and sentimental, he is all soul; he seems to tread on air, and he hath no eyes or ears, but for them; he will address to them the most refined gallantries, and he will appear lost amid a constellation so splendid. But think you, my love, that he would experience sensations thus highly wrought, were he to mingle every hour in their soci∣ety? and would you wish to exchange for such <HI>men∣tal gewgaws,</HI> if I may so express myself, the solid pleasures of endearing familiarity; the advantages re∣sulting from unbroken confidence, from a social inter∣course, uninterrupted by the fopperies of language, and from all the matchless and serene enjoyments which wedded friends may know?</P>
<P>Are you not apprehensive that the continued clouds which gloom your lovely face, may prematurely de∣stroy your bloom, and, by imperceptible degrees, alienate the affections of your husband? If once you relinquish your place in his bosom, it will require a series of the most arduous efforts to restore you to the possession you will have thus imprudently ab∣dicated!</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="034162_0192_0FFC61D60A98B138"/>
I am not an advocate for undue gentleness, or sub∣missive acquiescence; such conduct may border upon meanness; a woman should be <HI>just too, she should reverence herself:</HI> I am far from conceiving that the female world, considered in the aggregate, is inferior to the male; but custom hath established a certain or∣der in society, and custom is a despot, whose chains, I am fearful, it will be in vain that an individual will as∣say to burst.</P>
<P>I know too, that it is for the interest of every per∣son who singly considers either him or herself, to cul∣tivate an <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>serene</HI> temper of mind. If you array yourself in the garments of tranquillity, if you seek to clothe yourself with innate cheerfulness, <HI>habit</HI> will at length render you in <HI>reality complacent,</HI> and it will not be you who will derive the smallest share of advantage therefrom.</P>
<P>In short, my dear girl, you have every inducement to call forth your most unremitted exertions. Parents tenderly anxious for your welfare—Parents, whose fe∣licity is inseparably entwined with your own; a hus∣band acknowledged as highly deserving, and a beaute∣ous infant, whose little eyes are raised to you for pro∣tection, for instruction, and for peace: Oh! cloud not his budding life by a grief so strange and unaccounta∣ble; his lovely cheek should not thus early be wash∣ed by the tear of sorrow. Oh, pierce not thus the bo∣som of her who hath reared you to womanhood, whose prime hopes of temporal enjoyment rest with you, and who, in consequence of that authority, which by high Heaven is vested in her, demands of you an account of that latent woe, which, <HI>gaining strength by conceal∣ment,</HI> is thus preying upon all your promised joys. Speak, I conjure you, speak; and let your communi∣cations mitigate the pangs, which cease not to lace∣rate the bosom of your afflicted and commiserating mother.</P>
<P>The evening of the day, which had presented the foregoing address, returned Mary the subjoined reply.</P>

<HEAD>To my dear and honoured MOTHER.</HEAD>
<P>PITYING angels—and must I then speak? assur∣edly I must—every consideration unquestionably points out an explanation.</P>
<P>I have sunk, mortifyingly sunk, in the estimation of her whose <HI>approbation</HI> I would die to preserve; and I have inflicted upon her the severest anguish; yet, prob∣ably, her tender bosom may be disburthened, by a knowledge that her Margaretta is not altogether so culpable as she hath apprehended: And duty seems to impel an unreserved confidence; for the honoured woman, to whom I am primarily indebted for every thing that can render life valuable, hath commanded me to be explicit.</P>
<P>But stop!—can duties clash? Ought the discreet female to accuse him to whom she hath voluntarily yielded her most sacred and solemn vows? Can Mar∣garetta criminate her Edward!!!!</P>
<P>Yet, possibly, what I have to urge in my own de∣fence, may not exhibit my Hamilton in a censurable point of view; from a mutable being we are not to expect immutability; and, if my conjectures have their foundation in truth, though I may be wretched, I will not be unjust. It is necessary that I justify my∣self to my mother; but I will not dare to cast a shade upon the character of a man, whom I regard as the first of created beings.</P>
<P>Hardly three months after our marriage had elap∣sed, when Edward exhibited marks of a growing and deep-felt inquietude! an impenetrable gloom over∣shadowed every feature! Had you witnessed, as I have done, and still do, the lasting and serious sorrows of his bosom, your maternal remonstrance would have been addressed to him, rather than to your unfortunate child. Often hath he regarded me with a fixed and melancholy attention: and when, alarmed and terri∣fied, I have sought the cause of his mysterious deport∣ment, as if unable to command his grief, he hath fled with precipitation from my importunities. To induce
<PB N="195" REF="034162_0194_0FFC62247ACE5628"/>
him to disclose the fatal secret of his heart, no means within my power have been left unassayed; and al∣though failing in my well intended efforts, I have still endeavoured to soothe and woo his steps to the sweet and flowery paths of peace.</P>
<P>With the severe eye of unrelenting rigour, I have examined my own conduct: Probably I am under the dominion of <HI>self-partiality;</HI> for, in regard to him, I cannot view myself as reprehensible either in thought, word, or deed.</P>
<P>When, by your direction, I announced to him my expectation of presenting him with a little being, who would bring into the world with it, its claims to his fondest affections,—Oh, Madam! instead of the effect which we naturally imagined, the sorrows of his heart became ungovernable; with convulsed and agonized emotions, he clasped his hands—Never shall I forget his exclamation; it sounded like a death-warrant to my ear—"<HI>Gracious God! wretch, wretch that I am!</HI>"—What he would have added, I know not; for, over∣powered by my grief and my surprise, I sunk lifeless at his feet; and when, by his endeavours, and those of the attendants whom he summoned to my relief, I was recalled to sense and to recollection, I found him kneeling by my bed side, assiduously and tenderly em∣ployed in my restoration, and his transports at behold∣ing me, as he expressed himself, once more open my eyes to love and to him, at seeing the bloom again re∣visit my cheeks, were, he declared, the most exquisite he had ever experienced!</P>
<P>You will not doubt, that I seized this tender mo∣ment, to expostulate with him relative to his heart-af∣fecting and soul-piercing expressions of grief, and con∣tinued melancholy; but, although he beheld me, as I then supposed, with unabating affection, although he soothed my spirit by the most delicate and unequivo∣cal assurances, he nevertheless turned a deaf ear to the voice of my supplication! Edward Hamilton hath a strong and determined mind; fortitude is innate in his bosom; he can wear to the public eye, and even to
<PB N="196" REF="034162_0195_0FFC622251D66BE8"/>
the circle of his friends, a face of tranquillity, while his breast is a prey to the most perturbed sensations.</P>
<P>Fearful of disgusting him by my persecutions, I ban∣ished from my lips every expression of my anxiety; and, as far as was in my power, I dismissed from my features the inquietude of my bosom. I studied, by my every movement, his pleasure; and I flattered my∣self, that the birth of my child, by giving a new turn to his ideas, would restore my felicity. It is true that I had nothing to complain of, except the corroding grief, with which he evidently struggled, and which, notwithstanding his efforts to conceal it, was generally the companion of his private hours: For the rest, I judged myself in possession of his heart, and his de∣portment was descriptive of the most refined and faith∣ful attachment.</P>
<P>Thus passed the days, until the arrival of my pang∣ful hour. You, dear Madam, were a witness to the distressing agitation of his soul, during that perilous and tremendous period; you heard and repeated his fervid vows for my safety; they were music in my ears; doubtless they were sincere, for the heart of Edward Hamilton is as tender as it is manly. You also witnessed the rapt sensation of his grateful spirit, when he received his son; you heard and marked the paternal blessings, which he poured upon his young∣ling head; and, it is true, that the little creature is as dear to him, as the vital spark which warms him to existence—<HI>but alas! this is the sum total of my enjoy∣ments!</HI> The anguish of heart, which is destroying the <HI>father of my child,</HI> seems daily to augment! The tears, of which he is apparently unconscious, often bedew the face of my infant! Frequently, as if by mutual con∣sent, we gaze in silent sorrow upon the dear innocent, and when Hamilton supposes himself unobserved, his eyes and hands are raised toward heaven; and in all the majesty of innate woe, he pathetically makes his appeal to the Searcher of all hearts, while rectitude, it should seem, is the motto of his life.</P>

Yet, I will not withhold some circumstances, that have produced inferences, which my full soul hath re∣coiled at admitting. Alas, my mother! will you not esteem me wretched, when I confess to you, that I have but too much reason to suppose <HI>myself the origin of his misfortune.</HI></P>
<P>Some weeks after the birth of my little William, I was alarmed by the frequent absence of Hamilton; and as I <HI>forbore any remarks thereon, being unwilling to embitter, by my expostulations, the few moments which he allowed me,</HI> I continued ignorant of the manner in which he appropriated his time. <HI>Accident,</HI> at length, informed me that all those hours of which he had rob∣bed me, were devoted to Serafina! and from her he always returned a prey to the deepest and most fear∣ful chagrin.</P>
<P>The shock which my tenderness and my sensibility received, in a moment so replete with anguish, I as∣say not to describe; but reason, I bless God, darted athwart the region of my soul her beamy influence. Serafina was the sister of my heart; she was a lovely and an amiable woman. Edward and Serafina had been educated together from early life; their habits of intimacy were confirmed; and I considered, that if her society possessed more charms than mine, Edward was unfortunate, but not culpable.</P>
<P>I immediately formed the resolution of soliciting her to become an inmate in our house; and when I made my proposal to Hamilton, <HI>he received it with more satis∣faction than my feelings could well tolerate;</HI> he kissed my hand with rapture; a gleam of joy vermilioned his cheek, and he flew to acquaint Miss Clifford with the wishes which I had expressed.</P>
<P><HI>Serafina too demonstrated the highest complacency; a resi∣dence with her Margaretta, she was pleased to say, would complete her felicity; and she could not hesitate, when a sit∣uation every way eligible way tendered to her acceptance.</HI></P>
<P>Our plan was no sooner concerted than put into ex∣ecution; Miss Clifford was established in this mansion, and Hamilton no longer wandered abroad! When I
<PB N="198" REF="034162_0197_0FFC621EA225FD38"/>
am present, Hamilton hath never, for a single moment, abated his marked attentions to me; and he regards Serafina in his accustomed manner; but if I unex∣pectedly join them, although they have apparently been engaged in the most affectingly interesting con∣versation, they are immediately silent, embarrassed and uneasy!</P>
<P>The fine eyes of Serafina are often drowned in tears, and the grief of Hamilton seems to know no bounds! Two weeks since, upon the morning of the day on which you surprised me yielding up my whole soul to sorrow, supposing Hamilton in his closet, I took my needle-work, with a design, while sitting beside him, to make one more effort to allure him into the sweet and flowery walks of tranquillity. He was not there—but an open piece of paper lying upon his scrutoire, written by the hand of Serafina, in which I saw my name in large characters inscribed, caught my atten∣tion. I read it—its contents are indelibly engraven upon the tablets of my heart; and, with a trembling hand, I transcribe them for your perusal.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I read, I say—and the agony of my spirit was in∣expressible—with a wild air I turned toward the win∣dow, and, as if fate had determined to make me completely wretched, I beheld Edward and Serafina, arm under arm, walking down the gravel-walk of our little flower garden: This, at such a moment, was too
<PB N="199" REF="034162_0198_0FFC621B522C30F0"/>
much. With precipitate and unequal steps, impas∣sioned almost to frenzy, I hasted from the closet, fly∣ing, as for refuge, to my own. It was at this distressing juncture, that you, Madam, looked in upon me; you saw, and your eye condemned the irregular expressions of a sorrow to which you was a stranger; but I flat∣ter myself that you will, in future, rather pity than censure your Margaretta.</P>
<P><HI>Real illness,</HI> through that fatal day, served me as an apology for not making my appearance at dinner, or at evening tea time; and, in the course of the night, reason taught me sufficient self-command, to <HI>appear</HI> tol∣erably composed at breakfast the next morning. As I left the writing precisely as I found it, there cannot be an idea entertained of the suspicions which wound my bosom; and if it is mine to suffer, I am deter∣mined to suffer in silence.—Thus, dear and hon∣oured Madam, you will see that I have no common cause of sorrow—that I am not so very faulty as you conceived.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SITTING, last evening, in the little apartment which I have devoted to pleasures, properly term∣ed sentimental, I was endeavouring, while Mary was seated by my side, to amuse the hours which she em∣ployed at her needle, by a re-perusal of Gibbon's Roman History. We had passed our afternoon, in a vain attempt to investigate the cause of the infelicity of our daughter; we went over and over the ground, we traced and re-traced, we exhausted the powers of retrospection, until wearied amid the wilds of conjec∣ture, we attained the precise point from which we at first sat off.</P>
<P>I had forborne to question either Mr. or Mrs. Ham∣ilton, imagining that the discretion of Margaretta must inevitably become finally triumphant; and I conceived, besides, that any interference, considering the exquisite sensibility and delicate circumstances of the parties, must unavoidably increase the evil we lamented.</P>
<P>But to delineate the agonized perplexity which tempested the bosom of Mary, is impossible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the per∣turbed sigh, humid cheek, and swoln eye, proclaimed the anguish of her spirit; while she in vain endeavoured to reassume the wonted fortitude and equability of her disposition.</P>
<P>Last evening, however, wiping from her face the tear of maternal woe, and calling into action all those efforts which it is the privilege of tender esteem to embody, I so far succeeded in my attempts to soothe her mind, as to procure a temporary calm; and press∣ing, as an auxiliary, my admired historian, my pur∣pose was to draw her off, at least for the moment,
<PB N="201" REF="034162_0200_0FFA6535026CED08"/>
from the contemplation of the melancholy conse∣quences of her daughter's marriage.</P>
<P>We had but just invested our pensive <HI>tete-a-tete,</HI> with a degree of apparent serenity, when Mrs. Hamilton, without being announced, rushed hastily into the apart∣ment. Our astonishment at so unexpected a visit, was in no sort abated by the wild extravagance of which her air and manner were descriptive; it was, however, the mania of joy; and, without giving us time for re∣flection or interrogation, throwing herself suddenly at my feet, with clasped hands, and all the delirium of rapture, she exclaimed—<Q>O Sir! O my father! bless, bless, your happy child!—delay not to bestow your benediction upon this, the most blissful period of her life; thus giving the paternal voice, to sanction and complete that measure of felicity, which per∣haps her wayward and desponding heart hath but ill deserved.</Q></P>
<P>Alarmed and apprehensive, I would have folded her to my breast, at no moment hesitating to pronounce a blessing, which was ever the spontaneous dictate of my heart; but ere I could utter a word, springing up and hasting forward, she threw her snowy arms around the neck of Mary. <Q>O my mother, my more than mother! embrace your now not sorrow∣ing, but perfectly assured and extaticly enraptured Margaretta!</Q></P>
<P>Mary, alternately clasping her to her bosom, and regarding her with looks of agonized terror, struggled in vain for utterance; the impassioned feelings of her soul disdained language, and the perturbed emotions which agitated her spirit, were expressed only by an affecting and descriptive silence.</P>
<P>For myself, I am free to own, that the scene had al∣most unmanned me; and, that trembling equally for my wife and daughter, I could not have supported it a moment longer. It was interrupted by the entrance of Edward Hamilton and Serafina. "Ah, my love!" cried Hamilton, <Q>why do you thus cruelly deprive me of your presence; at a moment too, when you
<PB N="202" REF="034162_0201_0FFA6550355AA160"/>
have, as it were, renovated my existence; when you have relieved me from a burthen that, by its mighty pressure, had well near crushed my every hope of happiness this side the eternal world; when you have new pointed every felicity, and taught me still more highly to appreciate the inestimable worth of yourself, and of your ennobling affection! Were it possible I could call my Margaretta unkind, her absence at such a time, would be the only plea that could justify my accusation. <HI>But who talks of accu∣sation?</HI> Margaretta, like the Being from whom she originates, and who hath formed her a near resem∣blance of his blessed self, <HI>unreservedly forgives;</HI> and, influenced also by an example so fair, while urged by their own lenient benevolence, our revered bene∣factors, parents, friends, will likewise condescend to sign my acquittal; and thus their once almost des∣pairing culprit, restored to peace and to them, will new plume his hopes, and, re-embarking upon the voyage of life, he will trust that prosperous gales may attend his once shipwrecked prospects.</Q></P>
<P>Margaretta, encircled in the arms of her husband, bent her sweet face upon his bosom, while Serafina, enthusiastically pressing her hands to her lips, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in broken sentences—<Q>Lovely and forgiving <HI>sister!</HI> a sister indeed! angelic Margaretta! May God in heaven greatly reward and forever bless my indulgent Margaretta.</Q></P>
<P>But not to fatigue the reader, by the incoherently agitated manner, in which we finally obtained an ex∣planation of these mysterious appearances, I will piece together materials which, through many breaks and pauses, I received, and present a succinct narrative of circumstances, that have produced an ecclaircisement, which hath rendered Margaretta, in her own estima∣tion, the happiest of women.</P>
<P>The opening dawn of yesterday presented a serene autumnal morning, and the advancing day confirmed the pleasing indications of its rosy harbinger.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="034162_0202_0FFC65553A7583E0"/>
The ripened fruits of autumn gathered in, the in∣dustrious swain once more hailed the interval which, crowning his hopes, permitted him to indulge a sus∣pension of his labours; the very air, gently moving the motley foliage of the grove, impregnated with the seeds of bland and social peace, and disburthened of the undulating and busy clang, seemed to breathe the true spirit of grateful and unmolested contemplation; while all varying nature apparently wore the semblance of tranquillity.</P>
<P>Margaretta made the comparison—she could no longer support the dreadful contrast which her bosom exhibited; and, asserting herself, she determined to be peremptory in her demand of an explanation. For many hours she revolved her important purpose; her spirit laboured with its interesting design; her breast was the seat of inquietude, and her soul was heavily oppressed. How to present herself; how to introduce her subject; in what language to clothe those sorrows which she had hitherto so assiduously sought to veil from the eye of Hamilton—these were questions which strongly agitated every faculty of her mind; but all her attempts to concert a plan of operation were inef∣fectual, until at length, tortured by reflection, hesitat∣ing, trembling and irresolute, she bent her steps toward that saloon, which Edward had consecrated the scene of his most retired moments; thither, at certain hours of the day, she knew that he repaired; upon this soli∣tude she had never before ventured to intrude; yet, by slow and solemn movements, urged by despair, she now approached: She drew toward the recess, the door was but half closed; Edward and Serafina, for the purpose of obtaining an uninterrupted conference, had pre∣viously retired there. Serafina was seated on a sofa, her face bathed in tears; Edward, evidently over∣powered by grief, reclined by her side; he pressed the left hand of Serafina to his lips, while her right was thrown affectionately over his shoulder!</P>
<P>"O Edward!" with a voice almost choaked by sorrow, exclaimed Miss Clifford, <Q>why are you thus
<PB N="204" REF="034162_0203_0FFC6553A69B4918"/>
unkindly persevering? False sentiments betray you. My attachment to you is closely interwoven with my existence. I stand upon the brink of a precipice, down which your unyielding obduracy will not fail to plunge me! Again I assure you, that my happi∣ness or misery is involved in yours! If you become an exile from your country, doubtless I shall be the companion of your flight; but whither shall we go? in what recess can we hide ourselves? Is it possible that we can voluntarily consign to irremediable ruin, the <HI>lovely and affectionate Margaretta?</HI> Is it possible that <HI>you, that a father,</HI> can deliberately resolve to blast the just budding prospects of him, who now, un∣conscious of the threatened danger, lulled in the cra∣dle of innocence, smiles with celestial sweetness?</Q></P>
<P>Margaretta had entered unobserved; she had beheld the attitude of two persons whom she had accustomed herself not only tenderly to love, but reveringly to es∣teem. The most envenomed pangs of despair at that moment pervaded her bosom—a feverish kind of an∣guish seemed to drink up the purple stream of life—her voice was lost, and her sight well near absorbed. Unable to proceed, she sunk upon the ready settee, which the second step presented—she distinctly heard the exclamation of Serafina!!—and the powers of an∣imation suspending their operations, she sunk motion∣less upon the settee—a sigh burst spontaneously from her bosom—a sigh, that might well be imagined the immediate harbinger of death; it first drew the atten∣tion of Serafina—Hamilton started from his seat, and with mingling surprise, anguish and terror, they mutu∣ally flew to the supposed expiring sufferer. Their ap∣plications were in part successful; the active principle of life resumed its functions, and a gradual resuscitation pervaded the system. Reason, nevertheless, as if in∣dignant at the outrages which she had sustained, stood aloof; and it was but too evident, that Margaretta possessed not that fine arrangement which had hith∣erto regulated the feelings of her dignified and gen∣tle mind.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="034162_0204_0FFC655223575148"/>
Her wanderings, however, imbibed the hue, and partook the prevailing bent of her natural disposition; and amid her incoherent ramblings, the true situation of her soul was expressed.</P>
<P>In pathetic language she lamented her own hard fate; and, addressing Serafina, whom she believed to be Mary, she questioned her in regard to the propriety and eligibility of a separation from Edward. She said that her attachment to her husband could never know abatement; but (lowering her voice, as if fearful of being overheard) as he was devoted to another, she thought it was becoming her character to relinquish her claims; she wished, indeed, that Edward and Miss Clifford had sooner understood the nature of their mu∣tual attachment—But perhaps they might have much to plead in their own defence; and that, for her part, though she was at a loss to trace the origin of the ca∣lamity which had overtaken her, and could not justly accuse herself of intentional error, yet she wished ev∣ery body well. That they need not be reduced to the necessity of abandoning the country; for if she could but obtain one of those moss-grown caverns, which she had heard were so numerous in the dominion of Old Ocean's God, in those watery abodes she would seek her deceased father; possibly too, her supplications might draw down the sainted spirit of her injured mother; and if she might be permitted to take with her the darling boy, for whom her last sigh would arise, they would be a family of love—she would soothe the woe-fraught bosoms of her parents—she would pre∣pare for her infant son an oozy bed, the sea-green turf should pillow his little head, and, by the murmuring waters of some coral grove, he should be lulled to rest.</P>
<P>Hamilton, agonized beyond expression, in the fren∣zy of the moment, would have put a period to his ex∣istence; but by Serafina, who is ever present to her∣self, he was wooed, and awed to some degree of com∣posure.</P>
<P>Serafina, by the assistance of a faithful female, con∣ducted Margaretta to her chamber; and, while she
<PB N="206" REF="034162_0205_0FFC654D5BEBC038"/>
offered up to Heaven her silent and fervid vows for the perfect restoration of her friend, she availed herself of the idea she entertained that she was her mother; and, assuming the mildly commanding air, she had so frequently observed Mary to wear, she gently remon∣strated, pressed and soothed, until she had placed Mrs. Hamilton upon her pillow, when, seizing the exact crisis, in the softest key, she proceeded to chaunt the most plaintive, harmonizing and dulcet strains, within the compass of her musical voice, until she beheld the disordered mourner embraced by those slumbers, from which she doubted not she would awake, in the full possession of her charming intellects. Having thus ef∣fectuated this salutary purpose, leaving Margaretta to an attendant, her next care was to rejoin Hamilton.</P>
<P>It was impossible not to understand the nature of the suspicions, which, it was apparent, had so deeply impressed the soul of Margaretta; and a retrospection convinced them, that even in the bosom of apathy, reason, from a variety of circumstances, would have originated conjectures. Edward acknowledged, that a desperate disease demanded a decisive remedy; he trembled for the consequences; but his dearest hopes now pointed out the most unreserved confidence. Alas! had he known the heart of my daughter, how many pangs he might have spared her. But the lim∣ited pages of this publication forbid remarks.</P>
<P>Serafina, obtaining full power to act agreeably to her own discretion, returned to the chamber of Marga∣retta, fraught with a sovereign specific for her wounded spirit; when, dismissing the girl, and seating herself be∣side her, she impatiently waited her release from that salutary repose, to which she had been so solicitous to consign her.</P>
<P>Margaretta at length opened her grief-swoln eyes; the traces of deep-felt melancholy were visible in her countenance; but reason, it was evident, had resumed her operations, and the expression of every feature was descriptive of a mild and affecting kind of resignation.</P>
<P>"How are you, my sweet friend?" soothingly questioned Serafina.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="034162_0206_0FFC654BD89198B8"/>
"Not well, Serafina;" returned Margaretta; and, after a moment's pause, letting fall some tears, in an affecting tone of voice, she added; <Q>I am, Miss Clif∣ford, the daughter of misfortune; my parentage was early announced; and though the interposition of my blessed friends and benefactors, would, by adopting me into their family, have snatched from me the bitter cup of adversity, yet, to struggle against the unalterable decrees of an all-wise Providence, it is in vain we assay!</Q></P>
<P>Serafina, inexpressibly affected, delayed not her rem∣edy, but immediately taking her hand, which she be∣dewed with her tears, she delivered herself to the fol∣lowing effect:—</P>
<Q><P>You are undoubtedly an angelic woman; hardly any lot could be considered as fully adequate to your uncommon merit; yet, if my admeasurement of the mind of Margaretta is just, the secret which I have to communicate, will banish from her bosom its most corroding sorrows.</P>
<P>I shall make my recital in as few words as possible; and, although I may criminate the everlastingly absent, yet I will not be so unjust to myself, as to suppose that the fact which I have to state, will lessen me in your esteem. The bosom of my Margaretta is the natal habitation of candour; and, while I in∣form her that Edward Hamilton and myself, owe our being to the same father, the sensation that is most prevalent in my breast, is a pleasing kind of conscious pride.</P>
<P>While Mr. Hamilton, the elder, transacted business in Europe, he saw and distinguished my unfortunate mother. A circumstantial narrative of the tender, though unwarrantable connexion, which was the consequence, you will find in these sheets, <HI>which are the hand-writing of my father; the characters are familiar to your eye,</HI> and I yield them cheerfully to the perusal of some serene hour.</P>
<P>It appears, that the only fault of which my ill-fated mother could be accused, was her unjustifiable and
<PB N="208" REF="034162_0207_0FFC65489D544530"/>
fatal attachment to my father: the struggles of her soul were great; her sufferings were accumulated; a number of <HI>extenuating facts</HI> the narrative faithfully records; and the filial feelings of a daughter's heart, naturally suggest a persuasion, that when, at the moment of my birth, she yielded up her life, the sacrifice may be regarded as an expiation for her indiscretion.</P>
<P>My father called me by her name; and, return∣ing to America, presented me, then only six months old, to his lady, as an orphan, whose person and for∣tune were entrusted to his care by her expiring pa∣rents, and to whom he was determined to discharge the part of a tender and faithful guardian.</P>
<P>The soul of Mrs. Hamilton was the seat of <HI>unsus∣pecting virtue,</HI> and she received me to the bosom of commiserating affection; but I had not passed my third year, when this excellent lady was summoned to the mansion prepared for her; and my father ex∣changed no second vows. The attention which he paid to my education, hath often been remarked to you; and though, until I had completed my twelfth year, I viewed him only as my guardian friend, yet upon the tablets of my heart the sincerest veneration for his character was inscribed. Edward, born dur∣ing the absence of his father, had only one year the advantage of me, and it was on the twelfth return of my natal day, that, leading us to his library, and putting into my hands those papers, which I have now committed to yours, he thus expressed himself: Receive—Serafina Clifford—and the big tear rolled down his venerable cheek—receive the recital of your mother's woes. I have marked, with a per∣turbed and anxious kind of pleasure, the uncommon attachment by which my children distinguish them∣selves; yours is the age of innocence, and your affections bud on the stem of virtue; but a little on∣ward, and the passions of youth too often assume a baleful and fatal hue—these, alas! may perhaps pre∣cipitate you into a gulph of ruin—I judge it
<PB N="209" REF="034162_0208_0FFC654608042B78"/>
proper to commit to you a <HI>secret</HI>—that I command you never, but in an hour of <HI>unavoidable necessity,</HI> to divulge—<HI>Know, Edward Hamilton, that Serafina Clifford is your sister; she is the daughter of your fa∣ther—Know, Serafina Clifford, that Edward Hamilton is your brother; he is the son of your father; and upon the heads of my children may the blessings of Heaven de∣scend!</HI> Here the emotions of his soul became too big for utterance; he was unwilling to submit them even to the eye of duteous affection, and he hastily withdrew.</P>
<P>For us, our bosoms were awake only to the ming∣ling sensations of surprise and joy. I, for my part, never experienced a rapture so sincere; and, no longer restrained by the presence of our father, we flew into each other's arms, eager to exchange those vows of eternal amity, which we have ever since in∣violably observed.</P>
<P>With one half of his ample fortune, my father, by gifts, investitures and last testament, scrupulously endowed me; and, as I enjoy no maternal inherit∣ance, my every pecuniary emolument is derived from him: Yet, he so well concerted his measures, as to lead every one concerned to imagine, that he was only relinquishing a trust that had been reposed in him.</P>
<P>The remainder of my account I shall pass rapidly over. When Mr. Courtland's pretensions were ap∣parently approbated by you, my brother, struggling in vain to rise superior to an attachment, which he then deemed unfortunate, sought a remedy in ab∣sence; and, flying for refuge to the southern States, melancholy, and almost despairing, he assayed the various rounds of dissipation; gaming became his favourite amusement; and, in a few weeks, it is scarcely credible what immense sums of money were squandered! Mortifying embarrassments were the consequence; and had it not been for the extraordi∣nary interposition of a friend of uncommon merit, his immediate ruin would have succeeded.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="034162_0209_0FFC6541D03064D8"/>
Viewing himself, however, as young, and uncon∣nected, he was prepared to meet the frowns of for∣tune; and supposing he had obtained the cure of a passion, that had gained strength with almost every added year of his life, he returned home, well pleased with his expedition. The event proved what an er∣roneous calculation he had made; and when he re∣ceived your hand at the altar, he trusted that future successes, economy and application, would retrieve his affairs. What shall I say?—every month he hath accumulated misfortunes; and the rapid decline of his finances hath operated as a severe check upon his dearest pleasures. When you communicated to him your expectation of augmenting his felicity, by presenting him an invaluable pledge of love, he was then struggling under the pressure of a recent disap∣pointment; he reflected upon himself as a prodigal, who had wasted the patrimony of the unborn. You must recollect his unguarded and impassioned expres∣sions, with the alarming effects which they produced upon you. He accuses himself as a wretch who hath deceived you; and he is miserable. The generous forbearance of his southern friend, hath hitherto up∣held him; but that benevolent creditor hath himself become a bankrupt, and the state of my brother's af∣fairs can no longer be concealed. My lovely sister must soon have known, that her husband is some thousands in arrears, which he hath not a shilling to discharge. My fortune would completely reinstate him; often have I tendered it—Interrupt me not, my love;—for Margaretta was eager to express her feelings; I have written, I have repeatedly re∣monstrated: To effectuate this favourite purpose of my soul, I have revolved a variety of plans; my nights have been spent in tears, and my days in at∣tempts to conceal from you my chagrin.</P>
<P>Edward is withheld, by false principles of delicacy, from availing himself of what the laws of his coun∣try, but for the regulations of his father, would un∣doubtedly have invested him with: Gladly would I
<PB N="211" REF="034162_0210_0FFC65404DBCCCC8"/>
commit myself wholly into the hands of my brother. The good or evil which awaits him, I would wish to share; I would have but one interest between us, and I would be regarded only as the sister of his heart.</P>
<P>But for him, he styles himself a wretch who hath deceived and betrayed you, and, under this appella∣tion, he shuns your presence; he cannot bear to ap∣pear before your parents, the victim of extravagance; he meditates absconding from. America, and if he cannot be induced to relinquish his design, his sister will bear him company in exile: But if matters can be adjusted, Edward may receive my interest, at least as a loan. If Margaretta can forgive, and will be∣come my auxiliary, she may yet possess tranquillity; and she will ensure to herself the eternal gratitude of two persons, who will, upon all occasions, devote themselves to the promotion of her felicity.</P></Q>
<P>As Miss. Clifford proceeded in her narrative, Mar∣garetta had quitted her couch; she had continued highly agitated, traversing up and down her apart∣ment. Now her clasped hands, raised eyes, and accel∣erated movements, expressed the big emotions which struggled in her bosom; now she threw abroad her hands in admiration, and now raised them to Heaven, in a delirium of joy: Vehemently seizing the first pause, she repeated—<Q><HI>Tranquillity!</HI>—Gracious God!—Can Serafina Clifford Hamilton—my divine sis∣ter—my angel friend—my peace-speaking, hope in∣spiring genius—can <HI>she give so cold a term to the ex∣tatic rapture of this blissful moment?</HI> Creator, and Almighty Preserver of my life, how have I deserved this fullness of felicity, which, like a mighty torrent, now bursts upon me? O Edward! my <HI>faultless, my injured husband!</HI> but instantly, on my knees, I will supplicate the benign tenderness of that manly bo∣som, to intercede in my favour.</Q></P>
<P>Margaretta glided through the passage—Hamilton met her in an adjoining chamber; where, with a per∣turbed and anxious spirit, he had waited the result of what he termed the crisis of his fate. It was not in
<PB N="212" REF="034162_0211_0FFC653CD04EF8F8"/>
his power to prevent the humble posture of his charm∣ing wife; Margaretta bent before him; and, with streaming eyes and supplicating hands, besought his pardon for the error, into which a hasty, inexperienced and suspicious spirit had precipitated her. Edward in vain assayed to raise her; by the events of the day her reason was still in a degree disordered, and she in∣sisted upon receiving her forgiveness in form.</P>
<P>"My God!" cried Edward, flinging himself beside her, <Q>this is too much; receive once more your of∣fending Hamilton; endeavour to erase from thy lovely bosom every painful remembrance of his past irregularities, and you may then number him among the happiest of human beings. Dearer to my soul than the light of heaven, my Margaretta hath ever been: All amiably consistent; and mildly good as she is, she hath not, she never could be found in a reprehensible walk; and consequently, her husband must have marked her progress with an approbating eye; consequently, he can have nothing to con∣demn, nothing to forgive.</Q></P>
<P>The appearance of Miss Clifford suspended the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> tender contention; and Margaretta embraced the op∣portunity of hasting to impart to us, the astonishing change which had taken place in her favour.</P>
<P>The subsequent scene, in my reading parlour, nat∣urally resulted; and, I only add, that if there are, who do not greatly admire, and highly applaud the une∣quivocal demonstrations of joy, with which my daugh∣ter received the knowledge, that she must relinquish the independence of affluence, and descend to the hum∣bling grade, which <HI>scanty and precarious circumstances enrolls,</HI>—I pity the frigidity of their bosoms.</P>

<P>MY mind, much occupied and greatly exercised, by the deranged state of Mr. Hamilton's af∣fairs, together with some other very painful and deep∣ly lacerating events, hath not found itself at liberty to pursue, with wonted avidity, its accustomed avocations.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, as a substitute for the subject on which I had intended to expatiate, I present, for the pe∣rusal of the reader, the contents of a folded paper I
<PB N="214" REF="034162_0213_0FFC6538D7A59E90"/>
lately picked up, in one of my solitary rambles; and which, being without a signature, it is not in my pow∣er to restore, in any other way, to its original proprie∣tor. The sentiments and language of this little per∣formance, are evidently the devout and spontaneous breathings of a christianized mind. And, as I think that the piece, altogether, may properly enough be characterized, a Eulogy upon the month of December, I have chosen to christen this Gleaner by the name of that celebrious portion of time.</P>
<P>[<HI>Here followeth the Paper.</HI>]</P>
<P>"DECEMBER—it is true thou hast been fruitful to me of misfortunes; many a time hast thou lacerat∣ed my bosom, by ravishing from me my dearest enjoy∣ments; thou hast stabbed me in the tenderest part, and thy broadly wild and congealing eye hath seemed to glut itself with my tears; into thy frozen ear it is in vain that I have poured my sorrows; harder than adamant, thou seemest to arrest the stream of pity, and thou regardest my lamentations with stern and unre∣lenting severity; thy storms have been as a whirlwind to my soul; and thy tempests, up-rooting my peace, have well near whelmed, beneath the barren heaths of despair, my every hope.</P>
<P>Fell Despoiler I have called thee—for thy hoary visage hath still for me been marked with terror—But hark! what sweet voice is that which issues from yon∣der Angel of peace?—it soothes my spirit by the most consolatory assurances—reason and religion it com∣bines—with the Shepherd of Israel the commission originates—and, with bland and gentle pity, deep in my bosom it implants immortal Hope.</P>
<P>December—blest era!—thou art the natal month of the <HI>Saviour of the world—Let thy winds convey my individual sufferings</HI> to that oblivion, to which the Re∣deemer hath, eventually, consigned the woes of the exonerated children of men.</P>
<P>To the private considerations of corroding sorrow, let me no longer listen—Let me gird up the loins of
<PB N="215" REF="034162_0214_0FFC653553715350"/>
my mind, and look forward to that blissful consum∣mation, the dawning of which was presented in thy administration.</P>
<P>Hail! returning period—white-garbed month!—thou shalt ever be right welcome to my devoted bo∣som—Every moment which constitutes thy admeasure∣ment, should be consecrated as sacred to the most re∣fined enjoyments of the soul—Henceforth, waving my accumulated griefs, I will love thy flaky footsteps—I will anticipate their approach; and my spirit shall so∣lace itself, by a confiding view of the accomplishment of that arrangement, which was designated in thy ap∣portioned round.</P>
<P>December—blest period!—most illustrious in the order of time!—thou containest the natal day of the Son of God—and thy broad encircling eye extendest from the man of paradise, to that infant who shall latest swell the sigh of humanity.</P>
<P>Yes, I will love thy flaky footsteps—darkness can∣not overshadow thee—Thy shades but serve to render the brightening splendours of thy course the more con∣spicuous. <HI>The natal day of the Son of God!</HI>—what records have engraven so stupendous, so salutary, so momentous a truth!—Thy hours register his birth—the birth of the Prince of Peace—During thy prog∣ress, the Virgin brought forth her <HI>first-born son</HI>—and renovated nature smiled extatic—healing breezes chase the chills of winter—and celestial spirits cluster round the haunts of men.</P>
<P>Soft as the vernal shower his doctrine distilled—and the plant of perfection attained maturity—From the storm he is a Hiding Place—and the burning eye of Divine Justice can never pierce that invulnerable en∣velopement, by which he hath encompassed the sons and daughters of men—Sickness fleeth before him, and imbecility dwelleth not with him—Evil shall be exterminated from his dominion—rectitude shall ad∣minister unto him—peace shall erect an immortal standard—and innocence, adorned with chaplets of equity, shall be the gift of the Most High.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="034162_0215_0FFC653372A4A150"/>
The deaf shall hear his voice—the blind shall be∣hold his day, rejoicing—the lame shall speed before him—the dead, even the dead, shall hear the voice of the Son of God—<HI>and they who hear shall live!</HI></P>
<P>Blest thought!—<HI>the dead shall again be raised</HI>—And the hour approacheth, when, inmingling with depart∣ed saints, we shall rejoin that privileged and beloved circle, over whose open graves we have poured the com∣fortless, unavailing and corroding stream of sorrow—But from every eye every tear shall be wiped away—nor shall the wide extended universe contain a son or daughter of adversity.</P>
<P>Such will be, <HI>such is,</HI> the effects of his sway, who first breathed in mortality during the division of hours, which make up thy allotment. Hall, first of months! when I forget thy distinguished auspices may I be dead to the voice of the charmer—when I cease to mark with gratulations thy annual return, may the blest sounds uttered by the tongue of our holy, sacred, and animating religion, no more vibrate upon my heavy ear.</P>
<P>Toward the close of the month, which closeth our year, the Saviour was born—so, in the last day of time, when the divine arrangements are well near completed, the restitution of all things shall be made manifest, and the winding up of the great drama, bringing forward the accomplishment of the designs of an all-wise Creator—Crimes of every kind shall be banished from the family of man—the train of ills, which have infested the works of the Eternal Mind, shall accompany their origin; and sin being annihi∣lated, sorrow shall be no more.</P>
<P>Evangelic month!—again I repeat it—surely I will love thy days, O December! and the event produced under thy domain shall ever be right precious to my soul!"</P>

<P>TAKING my seat, the other evening, in a front box at the play-house, I was, previous to the drawing up of the curtain, not a little amused by the chit-chat of a couple of sprightly girls, who occupied seats at my right hand. The house, the company, and the expected entertainment, alternately engaged their attention. I found, by their conversation, that they, as well as myself, were strangers in the metropo∣lis, and that the witnessing the representation of a play, was rather an extraneous occurrence in their catalogue of enjoyments.</P>
<P>"In the name of wonder, sister Peggy," exclaimed the youngest of the girls, "who is that figure that seems placed as a sentinel over yonder avenue, and who is at the same time so curiously bandeaued, that one might be ready to imagine him just starting off upon a game of blind-man's buff?" "That figure? sister Clary," replied Peggy, "why that figure, my dear, is the figure of Justice." "O my conscience, sister," cried Clary, "<HI>Justice, do you say?</HI> Why surely, Peggy, you must have made a monstrous blunder; for I have heard a thousand and a thousand times, that <HI>Jus∣tice</HI> was nothing but eyes, and that she could see every way at once." "You are thinking of Argus, Clary: The poets indeed describe him with his hundred eyes; but <HI>Justice,</HI> believe me, is always painted blind." "Poh, poh, Peggy, you are certainly in the wrong; or, if it is as you say, your great writers, or painters, or who∣ever they be, must certainly all have been in a dream: Why I would not suffer a blind man to choose me a set of ribbons, much less should he decide upon a ques∣tion
<PB N="218" REF="034162_0217_0FFC652EB3FEE1F0"/>
which involved my life, my character, or even my estate."</P>
<P>The girl's observation was the spontaneous lan∣guage of nature, and truth and nature are generally upon the same side.</P>
<P>How long my fair neighbours continued their enter∣taining confab. I know not, for the ingenuity of Clary, throwing me into a train of thinking, from which I was only roused by the appearance of the players, I unfortunately lost the remainder of their remarks.</P>
<P>The sentiments of the lively Clary are certainly authorized by reason. Fortune is described as blind; and she is said to bestow her benefactions most capri∣ciously. The rich, it is thought, considered in the ag∣gregate, derive not their claim to the distinctions with which they are invested, from the suffrage of virtue; Fortune is frequently lavish of her favours to vice, while the good man is seen struggling with all those ills which are the accompaniments of penury. Yet did Fortune always thus designate, we might be ready to say she had undoubtedly the gift of sight, and that the depravity of her taste led her to select her favour∣ites from the children of error. But to shield her god∣dessship from a conclusion so derogatory to her mor∣al character, instances may be produced, where the votaries of rectitude bask in the sunshine of her smiles; integrity is sometimes crowned by her with affluence, and the upright, being liberally endowed, are appoint∣ed to administer to the necessities of the sons and daugh∣ters of adversity.</P>
<P>Fortune, moreover, is extremely variable in her dispositions, and in the constant revolutions of her wheel, those who are to-day standing tip-toe, upon the highest eminence, may to-morrow be precipitated into the abyss of entanglements, embarrassments, and com∣fortless despair. Ingenious therefore is the allegory which permits us to attribute the caprice of Fortune to her deficiency of vision; and those ancients were happy, who, thus regarding her distributions, consoled themselves in the deprivation of her favours, by the
<PB N="219" REF="034162_0218_0FFC652B2AD076E8"/>
possession of that intrinsic worth, which it is not in the power of so uncertain a being to designate or to bestow.</P>
<P>But whatever may be urged for veiling the optics of dame Fortune, is undoubtedly point blank against hood-winking the goddess Themis, or Justice. I am aware that the decisions of Justice should ever be im∣partial, and that her visual ray is said to be thrown into the shade, to prevent the bias in favour of appear∣ances, that her judgment would otherwise have receiv∣ed; but it should be remembered that Justice, <HI>divest of fable,</HI> is one of the most dignified attributes of Deity; that it partakes the nature of its august Original; and that it is, by consequence, infinitely superior to party.</P>
<P>Justice is enthroned far above all law, since no hu∣man arrangements can take cognizance of every possi∣ble event, and much must at all times be left to the spontaneous dictates of this illustrious vicegerent of Omnipotence.</P>
<P>Were I to personify Justice, instead of presenting her <HI>blind,</HI> I would denominate her the goddess of fire; she should possess a subtle essence, which should pene∣trate through, and pervade the inmost recesses of the soul; by every insignia of light I would surround and designate her; while among the ornaments which composed her crest, a broad and never closing eye should stand conspicuous; she should possess the pow∣er to unravel the knotty entanglements of the most so∣phisticated web; piercing as the forked lightning, in∣stantaneous and penetrating, she should disclose, at a single glance, the secret and crooked windings of the most profound labyrinth, while, patient and unerring, she should listen with calmness to the various disquisi∣tions of the interested claimant; and, careful to inves∣tigate, her decisions should always accord with her own important nature and office.</P>
<P>Uniform in her awards, neither youth, beauty, nor innocence, should possess a charm to soften her firm in∣flexibility; dignity, age, the venerable head of snow, these should not awe; adversity should not excite an
<PB N="220" REF="034162_0219_0FFC65298C0C1758"/>
<HI>improper compassion,</HI> nor should the tears of the widow, or of the orphan, unduly persuade. Of unbending integrity, Justice should <HI>feel, hear and see,</HI> but <HI>truth</HI> alone should be the pole star, by which she should shape her movements, and equity only should constrain her determinations. To the ravages of wayward pas∣sions she should be at all times superior; and her ad∣ministration should be under the regulation of wisdom. Elevated beings are dishonoured by the supposition, that they can possibly be influenced by improper or foreign representations, and my delineation of Justice, armed at all points, should be inaccessible even to the <HI>suspicion</HI> of imbecility.</P>
<P>August and dignified delegate of the great First Cause! to thee the nations appeal, whatever form their governments may assume, whether democratical, repub∣lican, oligarchal, monarchical, or despotical—still they are careful to give their doings the investiture of thy sacred name; they affect thy sanction, they arrest thy ti∣tles; the violation of thy laws, is the <HI>ostensible</HI> reason for the battles which they seek; and, assuming thy ban∣ners, they anticipate success, exulting in victories, which, agreeably to thy allotments, the iniquity of their cause may forbid their ever obtaining. Nor is the general disposition of great events alone under thy direction; thou takest cognizance of the minutiae of human life, and with an unerring hand, thou directest all those occurrences in the career of being, which the infidel is accustomed to ascribe to the agency of a blind and undescribable chance. To thee the good man raises the eye of confidence; virtue is sure of thy award; and the oppressed of all ages have flown to thee for refuge.</P>
<P>Thus far I had written, aiming, gentle reader, at thy amusement—when Edward Hamilton looked in upon me. "You are busy, Sir, and I will not inter∣rupt you." No, my son, I have always leisure to receive your visits. Sit down, Sir, and unfold the tale, to which your perplexed countenance is a preface.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="034162_0220_0FFA652B6A047458"/>
"I come, Sir, to take your direction in regard to the line of conduct which the untoward state of my affairs renders it proper for me to pursue." I threw down my pen which I had till then held in my fingers; and, grasping his hand, I eagerly exclaimed—<HI>Justice,</HI> Sir, <HI>Justice</HI> must be your guide—you are an excellent young man, Mr. Hamilton; and I am happy in the assurance, that you will find no difficulty in following the course of the radiant director, which I take the liberty to point out as the guardian of your every step. Endear∣ed as you are to me, Sir, your very fault, the occasion considered, serving to interest me still more in your happiness, I could at this moment with pleasure divest myself of my little inheritance in your favour: Start not, Sir, (for he was extremely agitated at this sug∣gestion) considerations of tenderness to the <HI>unborn,</HI> for∣bid my taking this step, and the possessions of her fa∣ther, must be secured to the children of our Margaret∣ta. I approve much of your declining to avail your∣self of the generosity of Miss Clifford. <HI>Justice</HI> would redden indignant at such a sacrifice. <HI>Nature,</HI> howev∣er, legislators may have ordained, gave that young lady a right to the patrimony she enjoys; and your fraternal affection ought not to suffer you to risk prop∣erty, the loss of which would render so amiable a wo∣man dependent and uneasy.</P>
<P>Such, my son, hath been the uniform integrity of your commercial transactions, that, to abridge you of your liberty, not a single creditor will present himself. Possibly you might go on to accumulate arrears; but <HI>Justice,</HI> inflexible and unyielding <HI>Justice,</HI> must here in∣terpose; a full statement of your embarrassments, with an estimate of your possessions, must be immediately given in; not a single article must be withheld; your family seat, which hath, for such a number of years, continued the residence of hospitality, if you are allow∣ed time to attempt its redemption, you will confess an obligation; meanwhile, it must be occupied to the best advantage; it may be converted into an annual in∣come, which will considerably augment your finances;
<PB N="222" REF="034162_0221_0FFC65273384D3D8"/>
this house is large, and the hearts of your parents are open to receive you; hither, until the storm be over∣blown, you must retire; and by the restoration of that society, the loss of which, I do assure you, we have not ceased secretly to regret, our domestic enjoyments will be inexpressibly advanced. <HI>Fortune is blind,</HI> and her dispositions are extremely variable; you must per∣severingly pursue her; possibly she may relent, and should she in future bestow upon you her gifts, you must not fail to discharge, to the last farthing, every just demand which can be made upon you. I bless God that your own habits, and upright way of think∣ing, will irresistibly stimulate you upon this occasion. Bankrupt and limitation acts may succeed each other, and all these may be very well in their place; but the honest man will hear the voice of Justice, he will bend his ear attentive to her pleadings, and Virtue will be the motto of his actions.</P>
<P>Fame once wafted to my ear, a little narrative, which indelibly impressed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mind; and I have never reflected upon it, without the accompaniment of an exquisite kind of complacency. I will give it you, my son, as an example.</P>
<P>A gentleman, engaged in the mercantile line, had followed business with little success; his integrity, his efforts, and his abilities were unquestionable, and for many years they enabled him to make head against a tide of misfortunes, which would have overwhelmed a common capacity; his creditors themselves, well con∣vinced of the propriety and frugality of his arrange∣ments, readily contributed the means, which his con∣tinued losses only converted into an accumulation of his arrears. Weary, at length, of a warfare that fate seemed to render so unequal, he summoned all those to whom he stood indebted, and forcing upon them, according to the amount of their demands, an exact proportion of the interest which remained with him; after thus voluntarily divesting himself of every shil∣ling of property, he found, to his great regret, that it was only adequate to the discharging of a very small
<PB N="223" REF="034162_0222_0FFC6524DB40D268"/>
part of his arrears; he received, however, from his approbating creditors, receipts in full; and, thus ex∣onerated in the estimation of the law, he very soon made up his mind, relative to his future destination. A generous friend supplied him with a small sum, by the means of which he embarked upon a foreign voy∣age; prosperous gales soon wafted him to his desired port, and he presented himself with such credentials as he merited. Shakespeare says, there is a tide in men's affairs! he had embraced the favourable moment of opportunity; every thing he undertook was prosper∣ous; all his transactions were marked and crowned by success, and a few years saw him master of a very handsome property. He had kept no correspondence with his friends during what he termed his period of exile; but he no sooner attained that independence, af∣ter which his noble spirit had so long and so ardently sighed, than he departed in a ship of his own, richly freighted, full speed for his native country. Inform∣ation of his return was conveyed to his creditors, through the medium of a card, soliciting their presence at a public house, to partake of an entertainment which he had ordered for them. His creditors remembered him as an unfortunate, but an honest man, whose ar∣rival they should gladly welcome, and they obeyed with avidity his summons. The first compliments were marked by mutual expressions of satisfaction, and from the lips of the welcome claimants the warmest gratulations spontaneously issued. A superb dinner, with much elegance, was served up, and the covers being removed, the bottle was briskly pushed about; but who can express their astonishment, when, in the midst of their hilarity, every man was presented with the full sum he had so formally relinquished, together with every shilling of interest, which would have been legally due, had they received promissory notes instead of the releases they had so voluntarily given! A gen∣erous contention immediately ensued; but our mer∣chant convincing his friends of his ability, they finally yielded to his remonstrances.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="034162_0223_0FFC6521A5DE5218"/>
They were, however, determined to exhibit a monu∣ment of their admiration and their gratitude; and they solicited and obtained permission of the govern∣ment to erect, in a public stand, a magnificent obelisk, the faces of which were inscribed with the name of the upright debtor, and with a circumstantial account of the whole transaction.</P>
<P>How much more honorary is a virtuous fame, than the possession of houses or of lands. The law was not made for the votaries of integrity; their own feelings are sufficient to them as a rule of action; and <HI>Justice,</HI> unerring <HI>Justice,</HI> is the great standard of their lives.</P>

<P>THE various parterres, now putting forth their promising buds, in many sections, in this our country, looks with a very favourable aspect upon a man of my profession; and I cannot but hope, that in the occupation of a Gleaner, I shall be able to cull many a fragrant flower, wherewith to compose a bou∣quet, that may throw an agreeable perfume over the leisure hours of the sentimental speculator.</P>
<P>To <HI>express myself less technically.</HI> The progress of the Drama, in this new world, must assuredly interest the feelings of every observer; and, being under the pleas∣ing necessity, in the routine of my excursions, of visit∣ing many parts of the United States, and thus, having frequent opportunities of presenting myself in our sev∣eral theatres, from the elegant house in Philadelphia to the temporary resorts of itinerant companies, in those little country towns, which will invariably copy the examples they receive from the metropolis, I nat∣urally,
<PB N="225" REF="034162_0224_0FFC651FDBA9AA40"/>
in the course of my perambulations, pick up many observations, that may possibly serve for the amusement of my readers.</P>
<P>The great question which does, and <HI>ought</HI> to occupy the mind of every patriotic moralist, is the <HI>utility</HI> of licensed stage-playing. Perhaps I may as well with∣draw the word <HI>licensed;</HI> for, in the present enlightened era and administration of liberty, the citizen would hardly consent to an abridgment of those amusements, the evil tendency of which could not be unequivocally demonstrated to his understanding; and the late strug∣gle in the State of Massachusetts, evinces the futility of erecting barriers, not substantiated by reason.</P>
<P>The law in that State was outraged in its very face: the flimsy subterfuge of <HI>moral lectures</HI> deceived no one; and though, as I am informed, the theatrical prohibition is but <HI>partially repealed respecting the Bosto∣nians, and remains in full force upon the rest of the State,</HI> yet it is notorious, that itinerant players are constantly marching and counter-marching from town to town, to the no small diversion of the good people of this very respectable member of the Union. But, without presuming to intermeddle with the policy of the legis∣lature, my design is, to hazard a few remarks upon the subject in general.</P>
<P>As I abhor the domination of prejudice, and, upon the strongest conviction, regard it as a tyrant, that if once brought to the guillotine, would <HI>(provided it is not of the Hydra kind)</HI> leave an opening for the intro∣duction of an era far more friendly to the progress of <HI>genuine</HI> and <HI>corrected</HI> liberty, than the murder of all the <HI>humane, virtuous,</HI> and <HI>religious princes in the universe;</HI> so I most sincerely deprecate its despotism; and when∣ever I seat myself, with the pen of inquiry, I am so∣licitous to raise a rebellion against encroachments, that, however sanctioned by time, cannot, in my opinion, be considered in a court of equity, as legal or natural. The objections to theatrical amusements are many and plausible. I pretend not to decide for others; I would only investigate.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="034162_0225_0FFC651D77BDB6E0"/>
If I mistake not—<HI>Waste of time—Imprudent expen∣ditures—Encouragement of idleness</HI>—and, <HI>Relaxation of morals,</HI> stand foremost in the catalogue of objections.</P>
<P><HI>Prodigality of time,</HI> is indeed an irremediable evil; and if it can be proved, that an hour devoted to the theatre would certainly have been appropriated to any beneficial employment, for which no moment of leis∣ure will in future present, I, for one, shall be impelled to allow the validity of the allegation; and, I do hereby invest such plea with full authority to detain every such person from all dramatical representations whatever: But, with the same breath I contend, that those evenings which are immolated at the shrine of Bacchus, which are loitered in a tavern, in unnecessary gossiping, cards, scandal, and the numerous vagaries of fashion, will be <HI>comparatively redeemed,</HI> if marked by an entertainment so incontrovertibly rational.</P>
<P><HI>The complaint of exorbitant expenditures,</HI> is of a similar description. A friend of mine, who resided for some time abroad, once informed me, that he had frequent∣ly been stopped, when in full career to the play-house, by a consideration that the indulgence he was about to procure himself, would supply some tearful sufferer with bread, for at least one whole week. Now, all such persons, provided they can make it appear, they are not in the use of any <HI>as expensive and more superflu∣ous gratification,</HI> shall be released, upon their parole given, that they will absolutely and <HI>bona fide</HI> employ their six shillings to the aforesaid purpose.</P>
<P>To the third objection I cannot allow the smallest weight: <HI>Who, I would ask, are the Idlers?</HI> Perhaps there is no mode of life which requires more assiduous and laborious application, than that of a <HI>good</HI> and <HI>con∣sistent</HI> actor. School exercises are certainly not the most <HI>pleasurable</HI> employments of adolescence; and ev∣ery adult can tell, how much more easily he could imprint the memory of his early years, than that re∣tention which is the accompaniment of his matured life. But the <HI>ambitious</HI> and <HI>principled</HI> actor hath past the age of flexibility, and still his days are, almost un∣ceasingly,

devoted to study: By frequent repetitions, such is the constitution of the mind, the finest senti∣ments too often pall; and the well informed, in∣genious and meritorious performer is in danger of losing his taste for the highest mental enjoyments; while the entertainment which he produces for oth∣ers, is the result of unremitted and painful labour to himself.</P>
<P>Why then, permit me to ask, if he is solicitous to blend, with our amusements, the highest possible im∣provement; if he professedly pursues the means of living; if his manners and his morals are unblemished; and if, by becoming stationary, he in effect takes rank with our citizens—why, I ask, is he <HI>so lightly esteemed?</HI> Surely, if, under the influence of reason, of gratitude and impartiality, I must unhesitatingly acknowledge, persons ardently engaged in procuring for us a <HI>ra∣tional entertainment,</HI> are entitled to a <HI>degree of genuine re∣spect,</HI> to encouragement, and even to patronage.</P>
<P>It is asserted, and the assertion does not appear un∣founded, that a <HI>virtuous theatre</HI> is highly influential in regulating the opinions, manners, and morals of the populace.</P>
<P>Here we are naturally led to the fourth and last di∣vision of our subject.</P>
<P><HI>Relaxation of morals.</HI>—And I ask, Doth not a <HI>virtu∣ous theatre</HI> exemplify the lessons which the ethic preacher labours to inculcate? I take it for granted, that none but a <HI>virtuous and well regulated theatre</HI> will be tolerated. In the southern and middle States, Philadelphia particularly, no performance can make its appearance upon the stage, without passing under the previous examination of the governor and two other respectable magistrates, who, by their avowed appro∣bation, become responsible to the public for the merit of the piece. Similar restrictions will, perhaps, be adopted, wherever the Drama shall progress; and my confidence in the trustees of the Boston theatre, repre∣sents to my view every apprehension, not only as super∣fluous, but absolutely injurious.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="034162_0227_0FFC65178B247A60"/>
Virtue then will be adorned with all her native love∣liness, and vice exhibited, deformed and mishapen, as that detested hag, which Milton's energetic pen hath so hideously pourtrayed. Is there a bosom that will not hasten to embrace the one? Is there a mind that will not shrink with horror from the other? The man of firmness, of principle, and of worth innate; the mild, the consistent, the regular, the maternal fair one; these shall be rewarded with bursts of heart-felt applause; while the imbecile or irresolute votary of error, the unprincipled betrayer, the fraudulent villain, the licen∣tious, perverse and abandoned female; these <HI>charac∣ters</HI> shall be stigmatized with reproach, exhibited in their native atrocity, and set up as beacons to deter our young people from pursuing a path, which will render them odious to every person possessed of senti∣ment and virtue.</P>
<P>Socrates, Cicero, and even Cato, have mingled with the audience in a theatre; and as it is presumed that the buffoonery of an Aristophanes will not be tolerated upon an American stage, it is pleasingly believed, that the dignity of years, of wisdom, and of virtue, will, in no instance, be outraged by the children of the Drama.</P>
<P>The Pompeys of our day, it is to be hoped, will learn many a useful lesson; they will commence stu∣dents in the school of the <HI>rights of man;</HI> and, becoming proficients in the laws of equity and of nature, like the Roman general, they will retire from the theatre, converts to the virtuous and impartial designations of equality.</P>
<P>Religious worship, it is said, gave birth to the Drama; and under proper regulations, it may still conduce to acts of devotional piety. To Athens and to Rome, the theatre became a source of information, refined perception, and genuine morality; and we have only to avoid the causes which finally produced its de∣generacy in the elder world, to continue it among us, in these States, an excellent exemplar and preservative of rectitude. The theatre opens a wide field for litera∣ry exertions; and we anticipate a rich harvest of in∣tellectual
<PB N="229" REF="034162_0228_0FFC65155DA1A9B0"/>
pleasure and improvement. The sons and daughters of fancy, the sentimentalist, and the moral∣ist; these will engage in the interesting competition. They will consider that their productions are not in∣tended barely for the amusement of a solitary hour; that the Drama, pointing every excellence, will im∣print upon the heart the sentiment of worth; that it may be in their power to fashion, and to lead, a <HI>na∣tional taste;</HI> that by <HI>exalting virtue, and adorning reli∣gion, rendering vice disgusting, and stigmatizing infidelity,</HI> they will most effectually second the endeavours of that revered body, professedly engaged to beautify mo∣rality, and elevate religion.</P>
<P>We trust that a spirit of <HI>laudable emulation</HI> will be excited; and while the summit of fame, in brighten∣ing perspective, uprears its wreath-crowned head, writers will be animated to the splendid career, and with glowing ardour they will hasten forward to the desired goal. How delightful the employ! the mind, while engaged in painting the native charms of genu∣ine and philanthropic religion, catching the fervour of divine inspiration, will necessarily become rectified and ameliorated by the delineation. Rectitude, a∣dorned by her sister graces, heaven-born contentment, consequent felicity, and ever blooming joy—these will captivate every beholder. Economy, attired by her handmaid competence, with serene tranquillity, present∣ing to view the peace reflecting mirror, will not fail of reclaiming from the paths of profligacy the most dissipated wanderer; and frugality and equity will remain prevalent in the mind. Nor will the exhibi∣tion of vice be unattended with its salutary effects. Conviction will be pointed to the bosom of the aggres∣sor; the deformity of atrocious offences, striking by illustrating examples, will present the disgusting figure, which the conscious culprit will assuredly recognize, and the probability is, that abhorrence and reforma∣tion will ensue.</P>
<P>Shakespeare, that penetrating observer, skilful in∣vestigator, and indisputable judge of the human heart,
<PB N="230" REF="034162_0229_0FFC6513B8BDB608"/>
makes his Hamlet say, "<HI>I've heard, that guilty creatures, at a play, have, by the very cunning of the scene, been struck so to the soul, that presently they have proclaimed their male∣factions. I'll have these players play something like the murder of my father, before my uncle.</HI>" And again; "<HI>The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.</HI>"</P>
<P>If it may be presumed, that the stated objections, thus considered, are obviated, I conceive it will not be denied that, from a <HI>chaste and discreetly regulated</HI> thea∣tre, many attendant advantages will indisputably re∣sult. Young persons will acquire a refinement of taste and manners; they will learn to think, speak, and act, with propriety; a thirst for knowledge will be originated; and from attentions, at first, perhaps, constituting only the amusement of the hour, they will gradually proceed to more important inquiries.</P>
<P>Clarinda Meanwell, the daughter of a gentleman whom I highly respect, whose education hath been upon the very best plan, continued nevertheless, for the first twenty years of her life, without manifesting the smallest literary curiosity. It was impossible to interest her, even in the pages of a novel; and what∣ever she learned, was more the result of a disposition naturally conceding, than of voluntary application. A company of itinerant players visited her native vil∣lage; the night of exhibition was announced, <HI>every body,</HI> as they phrased it, was going; but Miss Clarinda could not be animated to a wish for the entertainment; her accustomed complacency of disposition yielded her, however, the companion of her associates; the piece was interesting; it forcibly seized her faculties; it pos∣sessed, to <HI>her,</HI> in every sense, the charms of novelty; for the world she would not be absent upon any fu∣ture occasion. In the course of the day preceding a theatrical entertainment, that she might the better comprehend the several parts, the play-book was in her hand, a laudable spirit of inquiry obtained in her bosom, and with amazing rapidity she ran through, and compassed the sense of every volume within her
<PB N="231" REF="034162_0230_0FFC65118AEDD230"/>
reach. History, geography, astronomy—in all these, her proficiency is prodigious; and, in one word, I hardly know a better informed, or more amiable young woman in the circle of my acquaintance. But Cla∣rinda Meanwell is not a solitary instance; and as I have very frequently observed the good effects of dra∣matical representations, I trust that my readers are enough acquainted with a heart, the feelings of which I have, upon various occasions, essayed to sketch, to give me full <HI>credit,</HI> for that throb of deep-felt compla∣cency, which I experienced upon receiving informa∣tion of the elegant and superb theatre, which hath so recently been erected for the reception of the Drama, in the State of Massachusetts.</P>
<P>And here, gentle reader, I would with all my soul gratify thee by a full and complete description of this well built and beautifully decorated mansion of the Muses—such as it appeared upon the first drawing up of the curtain; but from the multiplicity of ideas which then crowded the mind, it is impossible to pre∣pare an accurate description, and as I <HI>write for posteri∣ty,</HI> I would not willingly leave a single pillar, capital, architrave, entablature, or cornice, unnoted: Fu∣ture opportunies may present, and, if I am not fore∣stalled, a future Gleaner may delineate the building. My brother Russell hath already informed thee, that "the house was filled from the lowest note to the top of the compass;" and his observations upon the audi∣ence may be recognized by truth. The long expected era arrived; it was indeed replete with expectation—the interposing veil was thrown back, and that pleas∣ing actor, whose eulogy hath been so frequently pro∣nounced, made his entrance amid the most unequivo∣cal demonstrations of satisfaction which a sensible, an∣ticipating, and admiring assembly could exhibit. The effects of a reception, which must have been every way adequate to his wishes, were pleasingly evinced, by a susceptibility honorary to the manly character; and the prologue then first vibrated upon the public ear,
<PB N="232" REF="034162_0231_0FFC650B3AAF8770"/>
with every advantage, which that truly classical per∣formance so indisputably merits.</P>
<P>That this prefatory address is a genuine prologue, notwithstanding every objection which hath been ad∣vanced, I take leave to affirm. What can so proper∣ly be constituted the harbinger of a dramatic perform∣ance, as a succinct account of that drama it is intend∣ed to introduce? and what so natural for a general dedication of a theatre, as a delineation of the prog∣ress of the art, to which it is consecrated? If variety, and richness of imagery, classical allusions, found mo∣rality, nervous expressions, beauty of diction, and much information, constitute a first rate poem, the prologue is certainly invested with the fairest pretensions to the honorary palm. To point out all its beauties, it would be necessary to insert the composition entire; yet I cannot forbear repeating the following charm∣ingly figurative lines:
<Q><L>Warm to the heart the chymic fiction stole,</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by moral alchymy, the soul.</L></Q>
And again,
<Q><L>The globe's proud butcher grew humanely brave!</L>
<L>Earth staunch'd her wounds, and ocean hush'd his wave.</L></Q></P>
<P>The allusion to the general deluge is strikingly and inimitably beautiful. The poet was most happy in this thought: I think I have not seen it surpassed; and I question if the Shakespearian panegyrists have ever yet done that immortal bard more ample justice, than he hath received in these finely expressed lines:
<Q><L>But hark! her mighty rival sweeps the strings:</L>
<L>Sweet Avon, flow not! 'tis thy Shakespeare sings!</L>
<L>With Blanchard's wing, in Fancy's heaven he soars;</L>
<L>With Herschel's eye, another world explores!</L>
<L>Taught by the tones of his melodious song,</L>
<L>The scenic muses tun'd their barbarous tongue;</L>
<L>With subtle pow'rs the crudest soul refin'd,</L>
<L>And warm'd the Zembla of the frozen mind.</L>
<L>The world's new Queen, Augusta, own'd their charms,</L>
<L>And clasp'd the Grecian nymphs in British arms.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have a strong propensity to go on transcribing; but, full many a time, hath the recollection of the
<PB N="233" REF="034162_0232_0FFC650985D27698"/>
stinted pages of a Magazine, damped the most fervid wishes of my soul. Mr. Paine hath certainly done himself great honour; and I congratulate my country on the possession of a genius, which, in the very morn of manhood, hath boldly seized the <HI>golden fruit</HI> of maturity. The Poet must doubtless feel himself much exhilerated, as he contemplates the well earned <HI>guerdon</HI> of superior talents; yet I dare say that he will wear his honours with becoming meekness; and when it is remembered, that Sophocles, the illustrious ornament and patron of the Grecian drama, absolutely <HI>died of joy,</HI> upon obtaining from his competitors the prize of merit, adjudged him for one of his tragedies, our youthful hard will be tolerated in a considerable expansion of pleasurable feelings.</P>
<P>The play was admirably chosen; it is a <HI>time hon∣oured piece;</HI> and it contains many sentiments, which can never reverberate upon the ear of sensibility with∣out speaking to the finest feelings of the soul. In the very first scene, in the first act, our attention is forci∣bly arrested, and we cannot avoid taking the deepest interest in the disguised hero, although immured in the mines of Dalecarlia; and while "<HI>stretch'd there, where reigns eternal night, the flint his pillow, and cold damps his coverings; yet we behold him bold of spirit, and robust of limb, throwing inclemency aside, superior to the lot of human frailty.</HI>" With Anderson, spontaneously, "<HI>we breathe the voice of virtue, of cordial amity, from man to man, and that benignity that whispers to the soul, to seek and cheer the sufferer.</HI>"</P>
<P>The sentiments of Anderson, of Arnoldus, and of Gustavus, are the very soul of valour, benevolence, patriotism, and every shining virtue. The subsequent discovery, the entrance of Arvida—the tenderness, the amity of heroes is personified, and we experience an exquisite satisfaction, in yielding our applause to those Dalecarlians, of whom Gustavus says, "<HI>I've search'd these men, and find them like the soil, barren without, and to the eye unlovely; but they've their mines within them, and this the day I mean to prove them.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="034162_0233_0FFC6507C18BD408"/>
The character of Cristiern is a complete exemplifi∣cation of whatever is detestable in a tyrant: Perhaps no language can more concisely group the traits, which go to the composition of the insufferable des∣pot, than the following: "<HI>Wretches! shall I go por∣ing on the earth, lest my imperial foot should tread on emmets?</HI>"</P>
<P>The trial of Arvida is admirably conceived; it was an ordeal adequate to the warrior, the lover, and the friend. In the struggles which lacerate his manly bo∣som, we take a deep and affecting part, and every feeling of benevolence would invest him with that hon∣ied balm, which he so well describes—"<HI>Yes, peace has sweets that Hybla never knew: It sleeps on down, cull'd gently from beneath the Cherub's wing—no bed for mortals—Man is warfare—all a hurricane within.</HI>"</P>
<P>Christina's description of Gustavus, is the breathings of virgin purity, and it cannot fail of captivating the bosom of virtue—"<HI>But,</HI> O Heaven, <HI>what then was my amazement! He was chain'd, was chain'd, my Mariana! Like the robes of coronation, worn by youthful kings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e drew his shackles. The Herculean nerve brac'd his young arm; and, soften'd in his cheek, liv'd more than woman sweetness! Then his eyes! his mein! his native dignity! He look'd as though he led captivity in chains, and all were slaves around.</HI>" When to the portrait, drawn by love and fancy, we add the finishing touches of the veteran soldier, we shall not hesitate to do homage to a model so perfect: "<HI>Fear fled before; behind him rout grew loud, and distant wonder gaz'd—At length he turn'd, and, having ey'd me with a wond'rous look of sweetness mix'd with glory—grace inestimable!—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pluck'd this bracelet from his conqu'ring arm, and bound it here—my wrist seem'd trebly nerv'd; my heart spoke to him, and I did such deeds as best might thank him—but from that bless'd day I never saw him more—yet still to this I bow, as to the relics of my saint: Each morn I drop a tear on every bead, count all the glories of Gustavus o'er, and think I still behold him.</HI>" These animated and combining tes∣timonials, prepare us to hear the illustrious chief him∣self;
<PB N="235" REF="034162_0234_0FFC65063B5BE858"/>
and he arrests, from every sentiment of the soul, the full tide of approbation. "<HI>Approach, my fellow soldiers, your Gustavus claims no precedence here; friend∣ship like mine throws all respect behind it—'Tis enough—I read your joys, your transports in your eyes; and wou'd, O wou'd I had a life to spend for every soldier here! whose every life's far dearer than my own; dearer than aught, except your liberty, except your honour.</HI>" But it is not enough that Gustavus is the finished patriot and un∣daunted warrior; the milder virtues too are natal in his bosom: Suspicion cannot take root in a soil so noble. "<HI>If thou hast aught to urge against Arvida, the man of virtue, tell it not the wind, lest slander catch the sound, and guilt should triumph.</HI>" The interview be∣tween the matchless friends, is uncommonly high wrought, and supported too upon the best principles. Unlike our modern votaries of an <HI>illusion,</HI> which they <HI>blasphemously term honour,</HI> Gustavus, innately elevated, esteems it no diminution of his glory, to develop a mystery, which was on the point of precipitating his Arvida into irretrievable ruin. How doth the expla∣nation dignify the hero, and how generously pathetic is his defence of the beguiled chief: "<HI>Unhappy man! my heart bleeds for thee: false I had surely been, had I like thee been tempted.</HI>" But the self-reproach which had planted all its daggers in the bosom of Arvida, pro∣claims him the proper object of a hero's confidence, and we most sincerely join issue in his conclusion: "<HI>Pardon can expiate; it is the lethean sweet, the snow of heaven, new blanching o'er the black'ning front of guilt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at, to the eye of mercy, all appears fair as the unwritten page.</HI>"</P>
<P>To the bosom of filial piety, the apology of Chris∣tina is a necessary and timely relief: "<HI>Had I to death or bondage sold my sire, or had Gustavus on our native realms made hostile inroad! then, my Mariana! had I then sav'd him from the stroke of justice, I should not cease my suit for pardon. But if, though in a foe, to reverence virtue, withstand oppression, rescue injured innocence, step boldly in betwixt my sire and guilt, and save my king, my
<PB N="236" REF="034162_0235_0FFC6503C5071C00"/>
father from dishonour; if this be sin, I have shook hands with penitence. First perish crowns, dominion, all the shine and transience of this world, ere guilt shall serve to buy the vain incumbrance.</HI>" The address of Augusta to the kneeling beauty, is beyond expression charming: "<HI>Ha! who art thou, that looks so like the 'habitants of heaven, like mercy sent upon the morning's blush, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> glad the heart, and cheer a gloomy world with light, tilt now unknown?</HI>"</P>
<P>Upon the ear, hallowed by the benign voice of the Saviour of sinners, the following sentiment must har∣moniously vibrate: "<HI>Soft and sweet as looks of charity, or voice of lambs that bleat upon the morning, are the words of christian meekness! mission all divine—the law of love, soul mandate!</HI>" Thus spake the man who "<HI>from the breast, from out the swathing-bands, stepp'd the true child of honour.</HI>" The scene between Gustavus and the ven∣erable matron to whom he owed his being, together with the tender fears of that soul-affecting bud of in∣nocence, his infant sister, is almost too much for the feelings of humanity; and the sensations of my bo∣som spontaneously thanked the judicious Manager, who expunged the whole scene of the lifeless bodies, the bier, &amp;c. The heart of susceptibility is sufficiently wrung, while listening to the agonized chief. "<HI>Then she's gone—Arvida! Anderson! forever gone!—Arnoldus, friends, where are ye? Help here! heave, heave this moun∣tain from me—O Heaven, keep my senses!—so we will to battle; but let no banners wave: Be still, thou trump, and every martial sound that gives the war to pomp or levity; for vengeance now is clad with heavy arms, sedately stern, re∣solv'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t silent.</HI>" I confess, I am happy to find the prin∣cess of Denmark again in the path of duty—what justness of sentiment—"<HI>Patience and peace possess thy mind; not all the pride of empire e'er gave such bless'd sensations, as one, one hour of penitence, though painful; let us hence, far from the blood and bustle of ambition. Be it my task to watch thy rising wish, to smooth thy brow, find comfort for thy cares, and for thy will, obedience; still to cheer the day with smiles, and lay thee nightly down beneath thy slum∣bers.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="034162_0236_0FFC650166208368"/>
Gustavus, the victorious Gustavus, is still the same as in the mines of Dalecarlia. "<HI>No, matchless men! my brothers of the war, be it my greatest glory to have mix'd my arms with yours, and to have fought for once, like to a Dalecarlian—like to you. The sires of honour, of a now born fame, to be transmitted from your great memorial, to climes unknown, to age succeeding age, till time shall verge upon eternity, and patriots be no more.</HI>" And again, "<HI>Fear not, the fence of virtue is a chief's best caution; and the firm surety of my people's hearts, is all the guard that e'er shall wait Gustavus. I am a soldier from my youth; yet, Anderson, these wars, where man must wound himself in man, have somewhat shocking in them; trust me, friend, except in such a cause as this day's quarrel, I would not shed a single wretch's blood for the world's em∣pire.</HI>"</P>
<P>The royal maid is also still consistent, still equal with herself, when "<HI>pleading for a father, for a dear, much lov'd, if cruel, yet unhappy father.</HI>" But far sur∣passing all that is excellent, she bursts upon us with more than mortal glory, when, with all the dignity of sex, we mark, to the lov'd, victorious, supplicating chief, her incomparable reply—"<HI>Now aid me, all ye chaster powers that guard a woman's weakness!—'tis re∣solv'd—thy own example charms thy suit to silence. Nor think alone to bear the palm of virtue—thou who hast taught the world, when duty calls, to throw the bar of every wish behind them. Exalted in that thought, like thee I rise, while every lessening passion sinks beneath me. Adieu, adieu, most honoured, first of men! I go, I part, I fly, but to de∣serve thee!</HI>" And again, in return to the hero's re∣monstrance—"<HI>The bond of virtue, friendship's sacred tie, the lover's pains, and all the sister's fondness, mine has the flame of every love within it. But I've a father, guilty if he be, yet is he old; if cruel, yet a father. Abandon'd now by every supple wretch that fed his years with flattery, I'm all that's left to calm, to soothe his troubled soul to penitence, to virtue; and perhaps, restore the better empire o'er his mind, true seat of all dominion—Yet, Gustavus, yet there are mightier reasons—O farewel! had I ne'er
<PB N="238" REF="034162_0237_0FFC61DC6F791B50"/>
lov'd, I might have staid with honour.</HI>" This finishing of the character of Christina, is unexpected, and, in my opinion, completes the beauty and symmetry of the performance.</P>
<P>It is impossible to give language to the feelings of an attentive and susceptible audience during the rep∣resentation of this masterly composition. The finished elegance of the building, the surrounding lights, the brilliant assembly, so strikingly contrasting the stage scene, where was exhibited the country of Dalecarlia, the tents in perspective, the hardy veterans, arrayed in martial order, passing in review, &amp;c. &amp;c. all this, to∣gether with the novelty of arrangements, so far sur∣passing what we had ever before witnessed, was, in truth, inexpressibly captivating.</P>
<P>The distant country of the admired chief seemed in reality extended to our view; and, for myself, I am free to own, that as I glanced my eye from the stage, to the throng of respectable citizens, occupying the pit, boxes, and galleries; as I observed the marked attention in the <HI>never deceptive eye,</HI> the solemn stillness, the tender tear upon the cheek of beauty, and the hu∣mid eye of manhood, with the alternate bursts of ap∣plause, betokening <HI>congenial virtues</HI>—as I marked these effects, the agitation of my bosom became well near ungovernable.</P>
<P>On the performers, perhaps, I ought not to hazard a remark. As an American, <HI>comparatively new</HI> to ob∣servations of this nature, I cannot be supposed a com∣petent judge; yet, so complete was my satisfaction, that I did not hear without pain, that many individu∣als expressed displeasure; and I can only account for this by a supposition that there expectations were too high raised to admit of gratification in the present in∣fancy of our Drama.</P>
<P>Surely it ought to be remembered, that the plant, however luxuriant, doth not, immediately on being removed to a foreign soil, continue its pristine vigour; and candor hath already observed that the <HI>prohibited play then first</HI> arresting the attention of the performers,
<PB N="239" REF="034162_0238_0FFC64FFAC9A2AC8"/>
could not, in so early an exhibition, obtain, in the rep∣resentation, the perfection of which it is doubtless sus∣ceptible. Yet we think it must be acknowledged, that Mr. Powell, in the character of Cristiern, inspired all those abhorrent feelings which the poet intended to originate; that Mr. Jones supported with admirable kill the part of Trollio, and that the Swedish priest, by so finely contrasting the treachery and baleful tal∣ents of the infamous bishop, presented to the mind a most agreeable relief. Such should always figure a herald of genuine religion.</P>
<P>Gratitude and faithfulness, in the character of Laer∣tes, were persuasively delineated by his representative. Mr. S. Powell seemed indeed Arvida; and Gustavus shone upon us enriched with native splendour.</P>
<P>In the female parts, the beauty and propriety of fil∣ial piety, the captivating magic of the tender pas∣sion, the dignity of the princess and the woman, were strikingly exemplified by Miss Harrison; her pronun∣ciation was distinct, her emphasis generally proper, and her gestures naturally expressive.</P>
<P>The Spartan virtues personified in Augusta, and en∣twining all the tenderness of the maternal character, demanded the most glowing, dignified, and deeply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> action. We conceive the first theatrical abil∣ities were <HI>requisite</HI> to the performing this part with propriety.</P>
<P>The young Gustava was truly interesting; nor was there a sympathizing mother present, whose bosom did not throb to snatch from the envenomed talons of the fell destroyer the soul-affecting innocent. Mariana was not destitute of merit; she seemed to deserve the place she occupied in the confidence of the royal virgin.</P>
<P>To the comic powers, exhibited upon that evening, ample justice has been done. Unequivocal demonstra∣tions of applause resounded from every corner of the house, and, for my part, I congratulate the sons of Momus with all my heart; for, having never yet been
<PB N="240" REF="034162_0239_0FFC64FD7308ED18"/>
able to conceive the smallest evil in laughter, simply considered, I cannot but give my vote in favour of <HI>cor∣rected mirth.</HI> Mr. Collins, Miss Baker, &amp;c. &amp;c. these have all received the tributary laurel; and I do not feel in the least disposed to enter my caveat upon this occasion.</P>
<P>The Gleaner confesses that his expectations were more than answered; but the Gleaner hath never wit∣nessed the theatrical abilities of a Garrick, or a Sid∣dons; nor is he certain he ought to regard this as a misfortune.</P>
<P>It is always invidious to point out faults; at least it is to me an unpleasing task. From an infant stage I look for improvement. The time will arrive when the performers will <HI>in no instance "O'erstep the modesty of Nature.</HI>" Even tragedy may deal too much in starts: It should be energetic; it should be pathetic; but the pompous swell and strut, make no part of its excellence. Ease and elegance are the naivette of com∣edy, and its features are the features of polished and corrected nature.</P>
<P>But I repeat, I look for improvement; gradually we shall progress; the performers will think more of the audience, and they will, by consequence, <HI>appear</HI> to <HI>think less;</HI> in other words, they will <HI>seem</HI> to forget the circles that attend them. <HI>Their frequent appeals by eye and hand</HI> will insensibly subside; and, through the whole of the representation, they will see the propriety of addressing the person, or persons, to whom they are <HI>supposed</HI> particularly to speak. In one word—the au∣dience will refine the players, and the players will re∣fine the audience.</P>

<P>I HAVE often thought, that serious and well dis∣posed believers of the heathen mythology, must have found themselves wonderfully impelled to acts of devotional piety. It was scarcely possible for such persons to pursue their course in any direction, which did not present to their external optics, or to the eye of their imagination, beings who were, <HI>in their estimation,</HI> proper objects of adoration. A respectable writer de∣scribes the vast universe as the solemn temple of the pagans; and, we may add, that in every division of this superb fane, altars, sacred to their various rituals present. The empire of fancy is thronged by person∣ified ideas; the prosopopoeia is easy, and gods and goddesses cluster in every walk. Hesiod, in his gene∣alogical history of the heathen deities, delineates thirty thousand of these dignified beings, and an indulgent imagination readily invests them with their peculiar properties and offices.</P>
<P>To the child of fancy, sheltered in the sequestered grove from the intense heat of summer, the salutary breeze which gently agitates the leaves is the rosy breath of the winged zephyrus, and the murmuring of that stream, which winds its glassy course, is the soft sighing of a river nymph, while, with equal ingenuity, amid the pelting storm, he considers the hoarse bellow∣ing of the winds as the sonorous voice of some potent god.</P>
<P>Neptune grasps his trident, and holds dominion in the vast world of waters. Pluto, borne in his sable chariot, bears the keys of ages and of dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; while Jupiter, ascending the skies, mounts his throne of ivory, extending in his right hand the avenging thunder-bolt,

and in his left the sceptre of sovereignty. To these suc∣ceed a train of subordinate immortals, all possessing their peculiar attributes, and occupying their various departments. Of the seasons of the year, the fruits of the earth, and the different stages of life, infancy, adolescence, maturity, and old age, a presiding deity took charge. In the catalogue of divinities, every virtue found its patron and its patroness; nay, among this multifarious generation of immortals, even the reprehensible passions were not destitute of their pro∣tectors. The sincere votary of this mythology, I say, must have been continually stimulated to acts which his directory assured him were proper and necessary; and, for my own part, I am free to own, that however fanciful <HI>reason</HI> may consider this fabulous hierarchy, I see no impropriety, in still allowing it, in the works of imagination, a <HI>visionary being;</HI> and poetry, certainly, even to the present era, gathers some of its most orna∣mental flowers from this magical, or legendary garden of antiquity.</P>
<P>The history of the heathen gods and goddesses is so interwoven with the occurrences of ancient times, that it is impossible to peruse those venerable pages with advantage, without a competent knowledge of their various characters and powers. I remember, when Margaretta was a child, I began a little biographical volume, which entitling a Theogeny, the better to captivate her attention, I threw into doggerel verse. My design was, to give a succinct account of those de∣ities who had figured in history, and who still hold their rank in some of our best poetical performances. An attention to business prevented my completing this <HI>bagatelle;</HI> but I am not sure that I shall not look it up, giving it a form, and the last polish, for the ben∣efit of her children.</P>
<P>If we trace the traditionary fables which make up the bulk of the pagan system, we shall generally find they originate in some momentous and incontroverti∣ble truth; and however they may have been combined and adulterated, in the various channels through which
<PB N="243" REF="034162_0242_0FFC64F65EA77D08"/>
they have adventitiously passed, they still retain some features, which, to the eye of observation, sufficiently evince their august parentage.</P>
<P>Through the labyrinth of error, the scriptuarian often follows a clew, which leads him directly to the fundamental principles of that <HI>revealed religion,</HI> which he reverences as of God, which he believes to be most holy, and which he receives as the ground of his pres∣ent tranquillity, and his future hopes.</P>
<P>That chaos, which Hesiod dignifies by the appella∣tion of The Father of the Gods, Moses simply calls <HI>The earth, without form and void.</HI> Hesiod's relation is undoubtedly an allegorical account, wherein the vari∣ous parts of nature are personified, of that history of the creation, which the Hebrew writer; in language na∣tural and beautifully sublime, so inimitably narrated. Writers have appeared, who have supposed the fable of Prometheus to have taken rise in the character of Noah; others imagine they trace the features of the second founder of mankind in Deucalion. Plausible reasons are adduced for these conjectures; but perhaps we hazard less, in yielding credence to the respectable Boc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art, who conceived this favourite of the Almigh∣ty to have been worshipped, in succeeding times, by the name and attributes of Saturn. The golden age which is placed under the administration of that deity; the tranquillity, friendship, and innocence, which is said to have reigned in the bosom of every description of mankind; the perpetual spring which invariably flourished; the temperate serenity of the atmosphere, neither veiled by gathering clouds, nor deformed by bursting storms; these, and similar arrangements, un∣doubtedly proclaim the interposition of some philan∣thropic prince, or benefactor of the race.</P>
<P>The history of the Deucalion flood, if not a descrip∣tion, by another name, of the general deluge, bears, nevertheless, strong marks of affinity thereto. Lucian, giving some account of Syria, where it is said the del∣uge of Deucalion originated, assures us, <Q>That the Greeks assert in their fables, that the first men being
<PB N="244" REF="034162_0243_0FFC64F406A60E90"/>
of an insolent and cruel disposition, inhuman, inhos∣pitable, and regardless of their faith, were all de∣stroyed by a deluge—the earth pouring forth vast streams of water</Q>—(in the Mosaic language, the fountains of the great deep were broken up)—<Q>swell∣ed the rivers, which, together with the rains, made the sea rise above its banks and overflow the land, so that all was laid under water: That Deucalion alone, saved himself and family in the ark: That two of each kind of wild and tame animals, losing their animosity, entered into it of their own accord: That this Deucalion floated upon the waters, until they became assuaged, and that he then repaired the human race.</Q> Writers also describe the eminence which arrested the course of this vessel; and by the authority of the celebrated biographer, Plutarch, we catch a glimpse of the issuing dove which Abydenus denominates a certain fowl, that being twice let out of the ark, and finding no place of rest, returned into the vessel.</P>
<P>The metaphor of Pandora, it is conceived, may be easily developed. The beauty, wisdom, various intel∣lectual endowments, matchless eloquence, and harmo∣nic powers, with every other combining charm, which so eminently distinguished that accomplished vision, are picturesque of the assemblage of graces that digni∣fied and adorned our general mother, while yet, array∣ed in spotless innocence, she presided the sovereign lady of those blissful regions, which her presence rendered so truly interesting, and which she was so well calcula∣ted to embellish. The mischief consequent upon the disobedience of the first woman, are exactly figured by the catalogue of ills which followed the opening of Pandora's box; and <HI>poor humanity</HI> hath ever since been doomed to lament the discord, anarchy, anger, envy, calumny, <HI>crimes in their variety;</HI> wars, famine, diseases, pestilence, decrepitude, old age, and death, which escaped thence—yet hope, blest hope, remained at bottom, and the christian investigator will not fail, in this expressive figure, to recognize the promise given
<PB N="245" REF="034162_0244_0FFC64F0E7433D30"/>
to the fair delinquent, ere yet her trembling footsteps were exiled from that elysium, which, previous to her devious wanderings, she was so well skilled to cultivate and beautify.</P>
<P>The fable of Typhon, and the rest of the giants, with the daring temerity of those hideous monsters; their audacious insult upon the residence of the celes∣tials, and their levelling war with the gods; all these astonishing circumstances may find their origin in the Hebrew historian, who describes the earth as bearing a race of men of uncommon stature, and complicated atrocity; who delineates the tower of Babel, and the defeat of that impious confederacy. The design form∣ed by Agamemnon, of immolating, upon the altar of idolatry, his unoffending daughter, may be nothing more than a vitiated tradition of that illustrious period in the life of the patriarch Abraham, which exhibits him as preparing, at the command of the Almighty, to sacrifice as a burnt offering, that son, then a beard∣less youth, among whose descendants he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to expect the Shiloh, to whom the gathering of the people should be. But however amusing the tracing this analogy may be, were I to pursue so fruit∣ful a subject, I should assuredly multiply words beyond the indulgence of my readers.</P>
<P>It is evident from sacred and profane history, that in the beginning, one only Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Omniscient Sovereign of the universe, was deem∣ed a proper object of adoration; and this unknown Being was devoutly hailed as life, light, and wisdom. All created beings were supposed to be beneficently di∣rected by a self-existent and eternal mind to the preser∣vation, protection, and final felicity of the whole. This great First Cause, ere yet the imagination of men had clothed him in the habiliments of caprice, was addressed under several appellations. Perhaps the <HI>ra∣tional religionist</HI> of every age hath found no difficulty in adopting the language of Seneca—"By Jove," says that celebrated Roman, "the wise men among the an∣cients, did not mean such a one as we see in the capitol,
<PB N="246" REF="034162_0245_0FFC64EF6429D7D0"/>
and other temples, but the Guardian and Ruler of the universe, a <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> the Master and Artificer of this mundane fabric, whom every title suits. Would you call him <HI>Fate?</HI> you will not err; for he it is on whom all things depend: <HI>The Cause of causes.</HI> Would you call him <HI>Providence?</HI> you are in the right; for by his wisdom is the <HI>world directed;</HI> hence it moves un∣shaken, and performs its every office. Would you call him <HI>Nature?</HI> 'tis not amiss; since from him <HI>all things proceed;</HI> and by his Spirit we live. If you call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>World,</HI> 'tis well; for he is <HI>all</HI> in <HI>all,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by his own power." It is not strange that a lively and pious imagination, should gradually deify the attributes and favours of so unsearchable, august, and beneficent a being. Thus the family of the gods claim their origin; and, in process of time, the depravity of mankind en∣dowing them with absurd and reprehensible passions, rendered them in their descriptions altogether like un∣to themselves. Respectable persons of both sexes were next pressed into this sacred order, and thus the multi∣farious catalogue was swelled to an enormous size. The joys, the sorrows, the apprehensions, and the ca∣lamities of mankind, supplied the materials from which the convenient deity was shaped; the apotheosis was conferred, and divine honours were next in course.</P>
<P>It is needless to inform thee, gentle reader, that I am no pagan. The heathen system is long since ex∣ploded; and we have, by common consent, circum∣scribed their deities within <HI>comparatively</HI> narrow bounds; but yet it may be a question, whether in ceding to them the empire of imagination, in leaving the domain of fancy open to their jurisdiction, we have not assigned them circles which are sufficiently ample. However, be this as it may, I am free to own, that while I trace in the Jupiter of antiquity many of the features of that Omnipotent, who presideth over the informed mind of more refined ages, arguing from analogy, I am fond of conceiving, that not a few of their subor∣dinate traditions originating in truth, may thus possess a right to claim their ancestry in the invisible world.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="034162_0246_0FFC64ED1822CD70"/>
A plastic and beneficent hand, fashioning and up∣holding the great and various productions of nature, is momently evinced, both to sense and to reason. A thousand circumstances assure me that I exist by the omnific power of a <HI>self-existent</HI> Being; an innate per∣suasion of immortality triumphs in my bosom; I con∣fidently expect a never ending futurity. Those who are departed are not lost: they have only obtained an earlier emancipation; in the general assembly I shall rejoin them—the social virtues, commencing on earth, shall be perfected in heaven; amity shall wear a never dying wreath; and, progressing in knowledge, we shall of course recognize those with whom, while habited in garments of mortality, we have tasted the pleasures re∣sulting from a sentimental intercourse.</P>
<P>The doctrine of guardian seraphs—this also makes a part of my creed. Some bright celestial was com∣missioned at my birth, to preside over my infantile years, and to continue the attendant of my mortal ca∣reer. During the hour which shall terminate my pres∣ent mode of being, he will be busy round the bed of death, and he will gratulate, with ineffable transport, the liberated spirit. "<HI>Myriads of beings tread this globe unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.</HI>" I per∣suade myself that truth guided the pen of the poet in this assertion. The gross film of mortality veils for the present the visual ray; yet there are, who have been so favoured, even while sojourning in terrestrial abodes, as to catch a glimpse of those natives of Elysium; and the period hastens when the wide expanse shall be outspread before us. But beside those beneficent ser∣aphs who, with angelic vigils guard our path, the shades of departed friends hover round; and, when worn by sickness or by sorrow, the gradually attenuated machine admits, through apertures thus made, the dawning light of paradise. These tenderly interested and sym∣pathizing denizens of the celestial world, not unfre∣quently, with mildly sympathizing aspect, stand con∣fessed to the patient sufferer, pointing him, with the finger of affiance, to that opening heaven, upon which
<PB N="248" REF="034162_0247_0FFC64E9948094B8"/>
he is so apparently verging: And hence perhaps it is, that the period of dissolution is seldom to the expiring individual, marked with those horrors, which in a state of health and vigour are commonly anticipated. Pos∣sibly the felicity of those who have bid adieu to time, may not be completed until the final consummation, which shall present the family of man entire. They may witness our actions; when our conduct is marked by regularity and propriety, we insure their approba∣tion. When, deviating from the line of rectitude, we engage in reprehensible pursuits, we incur the censure of beatified spirits, and they experience that kind of pain to which immortals of this description may be subjected; the lustre of celestial visages are dimmed; a transient cloud obscures their brightening joys, and the pearly drop of regret suffuses the radiant eye of seraphic pleasure.</P>
<P>What a forcible incentive to a perseverance in the career of virtue, do considerations of this nature fur∣nish! The eye of my mind is at this moment thrown upon an amiable and elegant woman, whom I have long known; her whole life hath exhibited a uniform exemplification of every social, every humane, and ev∣ery endearing excellence; her conjugal engagement hath been remarked, for some uncommonly splendid traits, and the chaste correctness of her manners have been regarded as the pattern of feminine demeanour. Her married life hath comprised a period of forty years. She has never been a mother, and yet perhaps the an∣nals of her sex cannot produce a more perfect model of the maternal character. No less than twenty or∣phan girls, at different periods of time, with great care, assiduity and tenderness she hath genteelly edu∣cated. By her assistance and patronage, they are com∣fortably established, and they look up to her, as the revered source of their every enjoyment.</P>
<P>She is even now, in the present advanced stage of her life, surrounded by a virgin train, who pay her honours, surpassed only by those which they devote to heaven. She hath her stated days of festivity, the
<PB N="249" REF="034162_0248_0FFC64E6F4D4F2B8"/>
return of which are very frequent, when she summon∣eth her children, as she calls them—all those who have taken rank in families of their own, to join with her in tender and grateful commemorations. No sove∣reign, attended by the dependants upon his bounty, ev∣er looked round with half the exultation, which, upon these occasions, glows in, and elevates her bosom. The figure is not good—she is not a sovereign, she is a ten∣der parent, regarded with the cheerful eye of duteous affection, by the little community which her own hand hath formed to virtue and to happiness.</P>
<P>It was on one of those convivial days, that, induced by curiosity, I lately looked in upon her. She was seated in the midst of the pleased and pleasing assem∣bly. Methought I had never seen an object more in∣terestingly beautiful: <HI>Yes, beautiful,</HI> for the <HI>wrinkles</HI> of her face possessed more charms, than adorn the red and white of the polished skin of that giddy flutterer, whom all the energy of sentiment could never raise to the en∣nobling swell of elevated thought or exemplary action. Dignity was impressed upon her every feature, and it was impossible she could fail of inspiring the venerat∣ing glow of admiration. I was coxcomb enough to pay her a flourishing compliment, which I concluded with pronouncing decisively—The reward of your be∣nevolence, undoubtedly, Madam, will be very great.</P>
<P>Echoing my last words with inimitable grace, she replied, "<HI>Will be very great?</HI> Trust me, dear Sir, I have <HI>no arrearages to demand.</HI> If, as you say, I have obtained the approbation of the good, that approbation is of itself a rich reward; and, Mr. Vigillius," placing her hand upon her breast, "<HI>I have peace at home;</HI> the plaudit of my own bosom is indeed of countless worth; besides which, the duteous complacency at this mo∣ment imprinted upon the countenances of these dear girls, is in truth a great and immeasurable reward; every decent gesture, every proper action, every grate∣ful expression, have still continued to me, through a course of many years, a ready source, from which I have momently derived a ceaseless and abundant rec∣ompense.
<PB N="250" REF="034162_0249_0FFC64E539D71548"/>
And, Sir, if you will indulge me so far, I will confess a sentiment which hath, through life, very forcibly operated upon my mind. I have ever suppos∣ed myself constantly under the inspection of numerous, although viewless, witnesses of my actions. These en∣circling spectators I have regarded as beings of the an∣gelic order, associating with those spirits who were once clothed in mortality; and the approbating smile of celestial joy, which I have considered as illuming the seraphic countenances of the progenitors of these my adopted children, while they have seen me busied about their offspring, engaged in eradicating the evil, pru∣ning the luxuriant growth of sentiments, equitable in their source, and in directing and cherishing the prin∣ciples of rectitude. Such observance, and such com∣placent applause hath frequently given energy to my efforts, placed me buoyant upon the utmost stretch of that invention, which is sometimes necessary to allure to virtue the steps of youth, and abundantly strength∣ened, encouraged, and confirmed me in those walks, which lead, as I conceive, to the paradise of the good. And, Sir, you will give me leave to add, that ideas of this kind obtaining in my mind, operate at once as an incitement to regularity of conduct, and constituteth a fund, from which I can freely draw the largest com∣pensation."</P>
<P>The Gleaner joins issue with these conjectures; by this controverted hypothesis, he confesseth his mind is essentially influenced; nor can he, gentle reader, con∣ceive it dangerous to embrace opinions which <HI>probably</HI> are the offspring of truth, which wear an auspicious aspect upon the interests of mankind, which produce benevolence in their operation, which furnish motives for goodness, and which stimulate to every proper, ev∣ery becoming action.</P>
<P>That scepticism, which is the growth of false reason and degenerated philosophy, may abide during the calm serene of the vernal or summer breezes, which make up the gentle and prosperous gales of life; but, being the superstructure of false and insidious conclu∣sions;
<PB N="251" REF="034162_0250_0FFC64E3A37BD4F0"/>
in other words, being bottomed upon the sand, it will fall before the mountain torrent, before the com∣bined and desolating storms of wintry time; and, bend∣ing under the accumulated pressure of mighty ills, the dweller in humanity will of necessity lift up his men∣tal eye to some propitious, although invisible power, who, he will conceive, is adequate to his assistance.</P>
<P>By the self poized hero, and the worshipper of chance, the Gleaner, henceforward, may be accounted a <HI>ridiculous visionary:</HI> But he is persuaded that the Christian religionist will enlist upon his side—for in the oracles of his God, the scripturian will find, that the Author and Finisher of his faith, hath sanctioned the idea of guardian spirits, where he pronounces that the <HI>angels of the sojourners in mortality, do always be∣hold the face of Omnipotence.</HI></P>
<P>The immediate disciples of the Redeemer spoke <HI>confidently of the angel of Peter:</HI> And the apostle to the Hebrews characterizes the angels, <HI>as spirits, ministring unto the heirs of salvation.</HI> Upon our knowledge of de∣ceased persons, the scene displayed upon the mount of transfiguration, decides: For Peter said—Lord, if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for Moses, one for Elias, and one for thee. And Jesus speaketh of sitting down in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</P>
<P>The Gleaner perceives, while embracing this per∣suasion, viz. the doctrine of angels and of spirits, that a most pleasing tranquillity pervades his mind; and he cannot willingly relinquish it, except, in ex∣change for sentiments, that he can conceive more di∣vinely consolatory, or more morally influential.</P>

<Q><L>Now, by my manhood, my full soul disdains</L>
<L>These dark'ning glooms, which suddenly pervade;</L>
<L>True dignity an equal part sustains,</L>
<L>Lending its calm and persevering aid.</L></Q>

<P>THAT melancholy pause, and <HI>extreme</HI> dejection, which at this present so apparently pervades every order of citizens among us, is, methinks, rather derogatory to the American character. The question, relative to opening the temple of Janus, seems to be agitated with unbecoming warmth; and a zeal, not properly tempered by knowledge, is, I conceive, strik∣ingly exemplified by every party.</P>
<P>That our country hath, during a most auspicious period, been borne forward upon the full tide of pros∣perity, no one but the embittered, the cynical, or the interested incendiary, will deny. Peace, with her ol∣ive wreath, was to us the celestial harbinger of unex∣ampled felicity; agriculture hath flourished in prime∣val beauty, fostered on the bosom of liberty, and fan∣ned by the genial airs of the meek-eyed goddess, it is rapidly approximating the highest perfection of which it is susceptible. Our manufactures have surprisingly advanced. Our navigation is extensive; almost every stream conveys the well freighted bark; and our com∣merce, wafted by the breezy gale, hath accumulated riches upon the far distant shore. Whether trade ought not to partake in <HI>some degree</HI> the nature of its fa∣vourite elements; and whether under the general reg∣ulations of rectitude, it would not find its own <HI>advan∣tageous</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> balance, may be considered as prob∣lematical: at any rate, unaided by <HI>treaties of commerce,</HI> our merchants, obtaining the object of their wishes, have, in many instances, found their enterprizes crown∣ed with uncommon success.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="034162_0252_0FFC64DCA5BA3FB8"/>
The arts and sciences are also attaining naturaliza∣tion in our soil; and <HI>literature, blest source of rational elevation,</HI> literature hath enlisted its votaries: The ex∣tensive and energetic movements of the soul are afloat; the sciences and the virtues love the venerable shades and sequestered haunts of liberty; and, cultivated suc∣cessfully in this new world, we had hoped they would become patrons of frugality, temperance, and that ho∣ly religion, which smootheth the bed of death.</P>
<P>Our citizens, intuitively, as it should seem, had be∣come sensible of that <HI>indiscriminate</HI> advantage, derived to the <HI>community</HI> in general, where <HI>each individual re∣ceives from the common fund,</HI> and <HI>where every member con∣tributes his quota, for the benefit of the whole;</HI> in one word, every one seemed sensible of the blessings of a good government, and <HI>federalism</HI> was the basis, on which we were successfully building the superstructure of ev∣ery thing useful, every thing virtuous, every thing or∣namental. What a fearful and destructive hydra is faction! War is its eldest born, and with the eye of the basilisk it seeketh to annihilate the cherub peace. Dreadful is the progress of war; it is retrograde to almost every virtue; the duties of benevolence it in∣verteth; it enjoineth upon every individual to afflict and harass by every possible means. Cultivation is no more. Destruction, with shocking exultation, ex∣erciseth in every goodly walk its fatally blasting influence. Population laments its murdered millions; the earth is humectated by the blood of our fellow crea∣tures; and those infernal demons, discord and malice, are glutted by the calamities of the human species. A late elegant writer inimitably pourtrays the conse∣quences even of <HI>successful war;</HI> perhaps a review of the picture may be of use.—<Q>We must fix our eyes not on the hero returning with conquest, nor yet on the gallant officer dying on the bed of honour, the subject of picture and of song; but on the private sol∣dier, forced into the service; exhausted by camp sick∣ness and fatigue; pale, emaciated, crawling to an hospital with the prospect of life, perhaps a long life,
<PB N="254" REF="034162_0253_0FFC64DB1F1E2BD8"/>
blasted, useless, and suffering. We must think of the uncounted tears of her who weeps alone, because the only being who shared her sentiments is taken from her; no martial music founds in unison with her feelings; the long day passes, and he returns not! She does not shed her sorrows over his grave, for she has never learnt whether he ever had one. If he had returned, his exertions would not have been remembered individually, for he only made a small imperceptible part of a human machine, called a regiment. We must take in the long sickness which no glory soothes, occasioned by distress of mind, anxiety, and ruined fortune. These are not fancy pictures; and if you please to heighten them, you can every one of you do it for yourselves. We take in the consequences, felt perhaps for ages, before a country which has been completely desolated, lifts its head again; like a torrent of lays, its worst mis∣chief is not the first, overwhelming in ruin towns and palaces, but the long sterility to which it con∣demns the track it hath covered with its stream. Add the danger to regular governments which are changed by war, sometimes to anarchy, and some∣times to despotism. Add all these, and then let us think when a General performing these exploits is saluted with <HI>Well done, good and faithful servant,</HI> wheth∣er the plaudit is likely to be echoed in another place.</Q> But however deplorable the calamities of war, such is the nature of the present scene of things, that there <HI>are circumstances</HI> which fully involve the <HI>necessity of appealing to the sword.</HI> When our dearest, essential, and most important interests are invaded, when our existence, as a nation, is put to the hazard, <HI>when negociations fail,</HI> when we are subjected to contu∣melious indignities, when we are despoiled of our prop∣erty, and stripped of the hopes of redress—in emer∣gencies thus pressing, every sentiment of <HI>self-defence</HI> will throw the gauntlet for the battle. That it is pre∣cisely upon these evil times we have fallen, many <HI>re∣sentfully</HI> and <HI>vehemently</HI> pronounce; and, not yet freed
<PB N="255" REF="034162_0254_0FFC64D890CD73E0"/>
from the jealousies and entanglements of European politics, while the hemisphere of the elder world is thus dreadfully tempested, nothing but an overween∣ing self-partiality, could lead us to expect escaping at least the outskirts of the hurricane; but if we have been unwarrantably and unnecessarily injured, and if our abilities are adequate to the contention, let every American play the man for his country. Let not our faces thus gather paleness; but, when properly author∣ised by the authority which we have conferred, let us combine, hand and heart, to work out our own polit∣ical salvation; and if our cause is thus righteous, the God of armies will again lead us forth, and doubtless the palm of victory will be ours.</P>
<P>But deliberation here maketh a pause—Against whom shall we commence hostilities? So many are the wrongs which we are said to have suffered from the maritime belligerent powers, that an unprejudiced American will hesitate against which to prefer the loudest complaints; and the investigations made in the general council of our nation, so nearly poizeth the scale of depredation, that the closest observer, un∣influenced by party, is at a loss to decide upon the question. Yet, it is said, our obligations to France, furnishing a balance in her favour, ought in equity to destroy the equipoise; and indeed it is greatly to be wished the conduct of that nation had been such, as to have sanctioned the most unlimited election of her in∣terests. If, when emerging from the benighted clouds of despotism; if, when exonerating herself from the intolerable oppression of unlimited authority, she had known where to erect the barriers; if she had not out∣raged every feeling of humanity, most atrociously committing acts, at which even the bosom of stoism agonizes at every pore, over which rectitude must pour the never failing tear, and at which fortitude hath learned to weep; if she had supported the consti∣tution which she swore to maintain, we should doubt∣less have felt for her like veneration, as when the gal∣lant and virtuous La Fayette, directing her councils,
<PB N="256" REF="034162_0255_0FFC64D59548A390"/>
led forth her armies, and, pointing her steps to victory and fame, extorted the mingling and unhesitating ap∣plause of an admiring world. But alas! France ex∣hibits, at this period, a spectacle, from which lacerated truth indignantly hastes, at which reason stands aghast, while morality and holy religion have received from base and murderous hands a fatal stab.</P>
<P>Perhaps the only advantage which the revolutiona∣ry tribunal can boast over the <HI>lettre de cachet,</HI> or the justly <HI>execrated Bastile,</HI> is, that not prolonging the suf∣ferings of its victims, it hasteth to bestow upon them, through the instrumentality of the executioner, a spee∣dy emancipation from its tyranny. Whole hecatombs have been immolated; every person who differeth in opinion from the ruling faction is arrested, tried, and executed. The <HI>federalist</HI> findeth no mercy; and even an <HI>avowed wish</HI> to qualify their <HI>boasted indivisibility,</HI> by a single feature of the American government, is esti∣mated as treasonable. With regard to our obligations to France, it ought surely to be considered, whether gratitude can ever teach us to abet, even the most <HI>lib∣eral</HI> and <HI>disinterested</HI> benefactor, in <HI>deeds</HI> of <HI>darkness and of death:</HI> And, when it is remembered, that the well-timed aid, from which we derived advantages so in∣disputably beneficial, was procured through the instru∣mentality of him, <HI>whom we then hailed as our magnani∣mous ally—which ally</HI> hath, by the most sanguinary men and measures, been, by violent hands, arrested in the middle of his days! when these circumstances are adverted to, they may possibly be regarded as an <HI>extenuation of our crime,</HI> although barely for the sake of evincing our <HI>loyalty to the Gallic name,</HI> we should not conceive ourselves obligated to leap the bounds of rectitude.</P>
<P>Yet, strange as it may seem, faction hath introduced its cloven foot among us; with astonishing effrontery it hath dared to list its baleful head; and, drawing the sword of discord, it is preparing to sheath it in the vitals of that <HI>infant constitution, whose budding life ex∣pands so fair to view,</HI> and whose <HI>docile texture,</HI> yielding

ample <HI>hope</HI> to <HI>cultivation,</HI> ensures the mellowing growth to every <HI>desired improvement.</HI> Is not the idea of mur∣dering in the very cradle so promising an offspring, a conception which can have received a form only in the maddening pericranium of <HI>hell-born</HI> anarchy? Is there an individual who will not devoutly say—May the Parent of the universe shield our country from the progress of that Tartarean fiend which hath so long desolated France! Yea, we confidently pronounce that every patriotic bosom hath glowed with indignation, and every virtuous sentiment hath recoiled from the frenzy of that parricide, which so licentiously suspend∣ed over the head of our matchless Chief, the execrable guillotine! over the head of that venerable patriot whose bosom is the seat of every virtue; whose disin∣terested efforts for the public weal, stand unrivalled in the records of immortal fame; whose superior talents, and whose revolving hours are invariably appropriated to the general good; whose unyielding magnanimity, hath gleamed athwart the darkest and most distres∣sing moments, the luminous rays of manly hope; who, far from bending beneath the load of national depres∣sion, hath considered every event, with the firmness of inflexible virtue; who, like another Atlas, hath still supported the mighty fabric of a various and compli∣cated government; whose penetrating genius, and ex∣panding resources, unravelleth the intricacies of dupli∣city, and presenteth the extricating hand of wisdom; who glows with the rapture of the hero upon every instance of national elevation—in one word, who was the illustrious leader, the boast, and the very soul of our armies, and who continues the brightest gem in the enfolding robes of peace.</P>
<P>Will ye not veil to the father of your country, ye associated declaimers? Is it your element to arraign, to cavil, to censure, and to exercise a kind of fanciful despotism? Why will you thus pervert talents capable of rendering you, to this younger world, the richest blessing? Yet, if ye will still pertinaciously proceed, the hand of freemen can never arrest your course;
<PB N="258" REF="034162_0257_0FFC64D113844EB0"/>
for still ye are cherished by the genial influence of that liberty, whose equal ray, in imitation of its great pro∣totype, invigorateth the poisonous as well as the salu∣tary germe.</P>
<P>But, suffer a fellow-citizen to make the inquiry—What is your object? Why are you thus studious to create divisions? Why are you ambitious of forming an <HI>aristocracy</HI> in the midst of your brethren? Ought not the nation at large to constitute one vast society of people, bound by common ties, common wishes, and common hopes? Hath any part of the Union <HI>constitutionally</HI> delegated their powers to you? To whom will you appeal? The late envoy of France, <HI>in effect, at least,</HI> threatened an appeal to the people! But surely, neither the quondam ambassador or his adherents have sufficiently attended to the origin, na∣ture, and completion of our happy constitution.</P>
<P>If ever any government might, strictly speaking, be characterized, in a rationally republican sense, <HI>the gov∣ernment of the people,</HI> the regulations made for the ad∣ministration of order, in these States, is indubitably that government. This is an axiom which I should imagine could never be controverted. Perhaps, the manner of obtaining and establishing our government, hath not, in every respect, a parallel. Delegates ap∣pointed by the <HI>free, unsolicited, uncorrupted,</HI> and <HI>unani∣mous voice of the people,</HI> were, <HI>by the people,</HI> invested with authority to weigh, ponder, and reflect; they assem∣bled, they deliberated, examined, compared, and finally arranged. To the consideration of the <HI>sovereign people,</HI> the result of the collected wisdom of our Continent was presented; every article, every sentiment was examin∣ed, in every possible view; it was analyzed and scruti∣nized, in the completest, most uncontrolled, and rigor∣ous manner. Orators embodied the whole force of their eloquence; writers exercised their most energetic tal∣ents, and in the strict examination the best productions of the press were engaged: Every member of the community had an undoubted right to investigate; public bodies lent their luminous aid; and, in the mo∣mentous
<PB N="259" REF="034162_0258_0FFC64CEB83534B8"/>
research and expected decision, friends and enemies alike combined. Behold the catastrophe—how loudly doth it pronounce the eulogy of our con∣stitution—how doth it dignify and eternize the Amer∣ican system! One State and another, time after time, gradually and <HI>deliberately,</HI> adopt and ratify a plan, which so evidently embraceth the interests of <HI>the people</HI> at large. In some of our governments, the sanction yielded is unanimous, and, in every part of the Union, the large and respectable majority of <HI>the people,</HI> is un∣exampled in the annals of legislation.</P>
<P>Surely, I say, a government thus originating, thus sanctioned, and thus established, may be unequivocally pronounced, in every <HI>proper sense, the government of the people.</HI> To whom then, from such a government, can we appeal? The answer is obvious; but, may our political Hercules crush the Hydra faction, however multifarious may be its power of mischief, or however widely diffused its poisonous influence.</P>
<P>In this era of general consternation and perturbed suspense, it is undoubtedly our wisdom to abide the re∣sult of those investigations and debates, which properly constitute the department of gentlemen, whom we have commissioned to take upon them the administration of public affairs. If the Gleaner might be permitted to breathe a wish, it would be for the general observance and establishment of order, and that every citizen would learn, <HI>habitually,</HI> to venerate <HI>offices</HI> and <HI>charac∣ters</HI> devoted to, and engaged in, the administration of justice, and to which every <HI>good and worthy member of the community is alike eligible<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>The Gleaner, from a series of accurate and unim∣passioned observations, is induced earnestly to hope, that the general government will still continue to pre∣clude all <HI>illegal interference,</HI> all <HI>foreign, unconstitutional,</HI> and <HI>unbecoming influence.</HI> And he confesses, that he experienced the enthusiasm of approbation. when he observed in the public prints, that dignified movement of Congress, which directed the galleries to be vacat∣ed, upon an indecent attempt made, to approbate men
<PB N="260" REF="034162_0259_0FFC64CB656810A8"/>
and measures, by <HI>testimonies, proper</HI> only to mark the merit of the votaries of the sock and buskin. Yea, verily, this new world is the heritage of liberty; but it is of that liberty which decidedly avoweth her <HI>sys∣tem,</HI> her <HI>regulations,</HI> her <HI>laws,</HI> her <HI>subordination;</HI> to all of which she exacteth the most scrupulous obedience. I am not ignorant, that <HI>licentiousness</HI> too often assumes the sacred name of liberty: Licentiousness, engendered by darkness, nursed by ignorance, and led forth by impudence; murder and devastation are her minis∣ters; hell-born ambition is her incentive; and the most confirmed and rigorous despotism remaineth her invariable object.</P>
<P>Liberty! heaven descended goddess, rational and refined—No, she hath not a single feature of the auda∣cious impostor, who, with such astonishing effrontery, artfully arrogateth her character and offices, and who, by a series of execrable machinations, after clothing herself in the sky-wrought robes of the bright celestial, demandeth her honours, procureth against her the most shocking and libellous declamations, and wound∣eth her in the upright exercise of those pure and whole∣some institutions, which are replete with the most sal∣utary and benign influence, upon the morals and hap∣piness of our species. Nay, the blighting and conta∣gious breath of licentiousness, stigmatizeth <HI>decent</HI> and <HI>corrected</HI> liberty, as the most degenerate and servile traitor! and, denounced by anarchy, the terms, usurper, despot, and tyrant, with every other frightful appellation which the black catalogue can produce, is liberally and indiscriminately bestowed upon her. Be∣tween liberty and licentiousness we cannot trace the smallest analogy; they have been strikingly and beau∣tifully contrasted. Liberty has been compared to an informed, elevated, and well regulated mind; her movements are authorized by reason; knowledge is her harbinger; wisdom administereth unto her; and all her interpositions are mildly beneficent: Tranquil∣lity results from her arrangements; and a serene and equal kind of contentment is her eldest born. Licen∣tiousness

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I SAID that genuine liberty recognized her systems, her laws, and her regular chain of subordination; to all of which she exacted the most scrupulous obedi∣ence; and, if this were not true, I confess that I, for one, should be inclined to deprecate her domination. Surely, that state must be fruitful of calamities, which admitteth not an acknowledged superior; where eve∣ry person hath, in every respect, an absolute and uncon∣trollable right to consult his own feelings, submitting himself to no other empire than that of his wayward passions.</P>
<P>It is not, in every sense, true, that Nature is equal in her productions. The same plastic hand that form∣ed a Newton, lends existence to an oyster. Nature lev∣els and diversifies her wide extended lawns, winds her serpentine walks, and spreads her ample fields; but she also erects her mounds, fashions her knolls, elevates her acclivities, and piles together her stupendous moun∣tains. The ocean rolls one vast world of waters; but the little stream murmurs gently and pleasingly along. The huge leviathan and the polypus, are alike inhab∣itants

of the sea. The elephant and the tatou, the ostrich and the humming bird, respire in our world, while naturalists are at a loss even to name the numer∣ous grades, which make up and complete the shades between these extremes. A various growth of flow∣ers please the eye; vegetables sustain and nourish; fruits regale the palate; and poisonous plants, obtain∣ing a luxuriant growth, rear their baleful heads. To trace the varieties of nature, is indeed a fruitful avo∣cation; the region of fancy is stocked with reflec∣tions, while, to the curious observer, engaged in the pur∣suit, hardly an hour revolves, which produces not an accession of ideas.</P>
<P>Light and shade are productive of the finest effects; the eye is offended by a continuity of the same objects; hills and vallies, succeeding each other, furnish the most enchanting views; the interjacent plain is pleas∣ingly terminated, by the sequestered grove; the glade beautifully diversifies the forest; and yonder tall ma∣jestic eminence is gracefully skirted by the enamelled meadow which is outspread beneath. The seasons succeed each other, and the revolutions of day and night, pos∣sessing their peculiar charms, are salutary and grateful. Nor is this multiformity observable only in the less no∣bler parts of the creation: The human being has va∣rieties, which may almost be pronounced endless. The degrees of intellect, if we may judge by effects, are ve∣ry unequally proportioned. Now a luminous genius darts through the complicated arrangements of nature; its pervading ken is subtil and energetic; its powers are adequate to researches the most profound; it in∣vestigates, and obscurity is no more; the arcana of ages, yielding to its animated and elucidating progress, relinquisheth the impenetrable veil; its versatility, and the depth of its observations are astonishing; and, amid the blaze of refulgent day, it lifts its aspiring head. But the natal place of this luminary, the same village, perhaps the same family, ushered into being the unfortunate idiot, whose faculties are scarcely ade∣quate to the absolute calls of existence. Some digni∣fied
<PB N="263" REF="034162_0262_0FFC64C3F8C90878"/>
minds, born to all the energy of being, devote their time and talents to inform, to rectify, to improve, and in every sense to benefit mankind; others again, are so <HI>absorbed in self,</HI> that were it not for the catalogue of their individual wants and wishes, we should not know that they continued to vegetate. If persons of this description have any principles but that of self love, they are so completely under the direction of, and as∣simulated by this their <HI>ruling passion,</HI> that it is difficult to trace, in their actions, the smallest vestige of a for∣eign influence. Is it just to refuse to merit its un∣questionable dues? Is it equitable to deny to virtue the palm of honour? Or, ought we to hesitate in do∣ing reverence to a superiority indubitable and decided?</P>
<P>Where is <HI>unvaried equality to be found?</HI> Not in heav∣en, <HI>for there are principalities and powers:</HI> Not, certain∣ly, in any of the distributions which we have traced on earth; for it is unquestionable, that <HI>variety</HI> constitutes one of the principal beauties in the arrangements of nature. Nor is it the growth of the Tartarean regions; for there the <HI>arch fiend</HI> exerciseth those powers, which proclaim his regality; and, even <HI>Licentiousness</HI> hath her chosen favourite whom she constituteth chief of the savage band of murderers. I do not say, that my reading and observation are sufficiently extensive to de∣cide; but were I to hazard a conjecture, I would sug∣gest, that, from the days of that first murderer who slew his brother, the levelling scheme hath, strictly speaking, continued a chimera, floating only in the brain of the speculatist, or figuring splendidly in the theories, which his fertile imagination hath commission∣ed to issue from the press.</P>
<P>Perhaps the late Doctor <HI>Johnson,</HI> who may be styled the monarch of literature, however rich in resources, could not have hit on an argument more effectually calculated to flash conviction upon the feelings of a certain <HI>female historian</HI> (of no inconsiderable merit, not∣withstanding) than when waiting upon her, in her decent apartments in the city of London, and assuming the humble and serious features of conviction, he ad∣dressed
<PB N="264" REF="034162_0263_0FFC64C274FDEEE8"/>
her to the following effect:—Madam, influenc∣ed by your good sense, and the irrefragable strength of your arguments, you at this moment behold before you, the proselyte of your opinions. I am at length confident, that the children of men are all upon an equal footing; and, Madam, to give you proof posi∣tive that I am indeed a convert, here is a very sensible, civil, worthy, well-behaved citizen, your footman; I make it my request that he may be permitted to sit down and dine with us. Doctor Johnson, upon this, or some similar occasion, made a remark, which, agree∣ably to the general tenor of his observations, carrieth its evidence along with it, and which the experience of every day may serve to corroborate. "Your <HI>levellers,"</HI> said the Doctor, "wish to <HI>level down</HI> as far as them∣selves, but they cannot bear levelling <HI>up</HI> to themselves; they would all have some people under them; why not then have <HI>some people</HI> above them? I would no more deprive certain characters of their respect, than of their money. I consider myself as acting a part in the great system of society, and I do to others as I would have them do to me. There would be a perpetual struggle for precedence, were there no rules to discriminate rank."</P>
<P>There is no calculating the disorders which may re∣sult from relaxing the series of subordination; if con∣viction is suspended, we need but make the trial. I am surrounded by a family of men and maid servants. I am placed upon extensive grounds, which call for the regular aid of cultivation, for all the various routine of agricultural attention. The vernal season is hasting forward—the morning is delightful. On a day so pro∣pitious much business may be accomplished: With the early dawn I quit my pillow, I supplicate Mary to di∣rect her woman to prepare me an immediate breakfast; she, carelessly, pronounces me quite as eligible to that task myself. I apply to Abigail, who refers me to another, and another; and, as <HI>equality</HI> admitteth no distinctions, the probability is, that I am finally brought back again to Mary herself. Possibly, after many en∣treaties,
<PB N="265" REF="034162_0264_0FFC64BDC35CA438"/>
the females may all combine; one bear a cup, another a saucer; a table is dragged from that apart∣ment, and a tea-kettle from this; ignorant of each oth∣er's plans, and having no one to direct, the process is impeded and confused, and when at length the motley assemblage is completed, and the refection presented, the spoiled tea, coffee, chocolate, and bread and but∣ter, all evince the opposite hands employed in their manufacture. But this is the fair side of the business; they might have engaged in a tumultuous <HI>fracas,</HI> and, consigning the whole apparatus to destruction, they might have left me no other consolation, than that of soothing my vexation, by singing, in Homeric numbers, the dismal crash of that eventful morning.</P>
<P>Well, but to proceed. Breakfast over, I sally forth. I <HI>advise</HI> that the cattle be yoked, and that such a par∣cel of manure be conveyed to yonder sterile spot. Jon∣athan insists that the horse-cart is sufficient to drag it. Thomas is of his opinion. William sides with me, and we prepare for a trial of strength; equally divid∣ed, our opposition bars our purpose; from words we proceed to blows; the females are alarmed; they take their sides; the plot thickens; appearances grow for∣midable; a doughty battle ensues; bloody noses are the consequence; and the day is sacrificed to discord. Every morning is thus ushered in; every portion of time is marked by opposition. Now the land shall be hedged with bushes, anon the ready rock shall present the barrier, and again the wooden enclosure is all the rage. To day we will plough, to-morrow we will sow. Nay, you are too early, you are too late; this is suf∣ficient, that is not enough; we will go hither and thither, every where, and no where.</P>
<P>Thus roll on the days, weeks and months. Au∣tumn is at the door, the lands are uncultivated, and famine, with its meagre stride, is rapidly advancing to our borders. Meanwhile, even in this tumultuous era, my house, my estate confesseth a potentate. An∣archy reigneth supreme, and desolation administereth her commands. To prevent, or to guard against con∣sequences,
<PB N="266" REF="034162_0265_0FFC64BBF0A75E38"/>
which every sober sentiment must deprecate, becomes impossible; no member of the family hath authority to interpose the dictatorial document, and the commands of the fiend are perforce obeyed. Who shall prevent the spreading evil? If licentiousness is successful in her imposture; if, assuming the mask of liberty, she completeth her deception; if we prostrate before this baleful destroyer, where, I demand, is my safety? What security can I have, that my neighbour, whose sinewy arm can bear away the prize of strength, will not snatch from me that patrimony, which, de∣scending from a virtuous line of ancestors, I have pre∣served, at the expense of laborious days, and many a self-denying conflict? Surely, language, in attempting an enumeration of the calamities of licentiousness, is baffled in the description! and even <HI>conception</HI> must fall short of the mischiefs which she produceth.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>theory</HI> of equality is not <HI>practicable</HI> in the contracted circle of domestic life, much less will that experiment succeed which would realize it, in regard to the heterogeneous collection of beings who consti∣tute a nation. Doth not Liberty associate her laws, her regulations, and her distinctions? Is not good gov∣ernment the basis on which she erecteth the superstruc∣ture of all those operations so beneficial to mankind? Yes, Liberty, sacred and genuine Liberty, draweth with precision the line, nor will she permit a litigation of the inherent Rights of Man. She alloweth no im∣aginary claims; she is fearful of disturbing the regular succession of order; she is fond of the necessary ar∣rangement of civil subordination; and she dreadeth that tumultuous and up-rooting hurricane, which, in∣mingling the various classes of mankind, destroyeth the beautiful gradation and series of harmony, again restoring all that wild uproar, resulting from the rude and mishapen domination of chaos. Yes, we repeat it, that people, that nation, that tribe or family, which is destitute of legislation, regulation, and officers of government, must unquestionably be in a deplorable situation. The strong will invariably oppress the
<PB N="267" REF="034162_0266_0FFC64B9B3181FB8"/>
weak; to the lusty arm of athletic guilt, imbecile in∣nocence will fall a prey, and there is no power to redress! Hence the time registered axiom, <HI>It is neces∣sary to relinquish a part, for the preservation of the whole.</HI> Liberty delegates her powers, and to this effulgent goddess, her anointed ministers, with that integrity and patriotic firmness which becometh the servants of a patroness, who still regards the children of men with an eye of benignity, fail not to render up their ac∣counts.</P>
<P>Let us suppose a people in a state of nature, and let us suppose them made up of all those varieties of con∣stitution, intellect, passions, and corporeal strength, which are commonly found in a community. Expe∣rience hath convinced them, that anarchy is pregnant with every evil; and they finally combine to form the league of government. What is the mode for the ad∣ministration of justice, which we would recommend to such a people? Possessed by a wish to render perma∣nent, and give the requisite dignity, energy, execution, and obedience to the social order which we should aim at establishing, we should be solicitous to adopt in our form of polity, that gradatory junction which would cement and bind together, in an amicable and mutual exchange of good offices, the various classes of citizens. Fancy, for a moment, invests me with the venerable and honorary character of a legislator; and, for the purpose of forming, for a set of well disposed men, a code of regulations, I imagine myself seated, with the pen of inquiry in my fingers, and my design being to compile a government of <HI>laws,</HI> rather than of <HI>individuals,</HI> I am naturally solicitous to promulgate institutions, which shall be at once salutary, efficacious and pleasing. With a view of tracing and combining an eligible plan, I might turn over huge folios of information, and, pursuing a science of such vast importance to mankind, which in its operations is capable of the highest public utility, or which may become the root of every evil, investigation can hardly be too scrupulously exact. But what would be the result of an application to va∣rious
<PB N="268" REF="034162_0267_0FFC64B5ECFE99B8"/>
writers? Doubtless we should find ourselves in∣volved in a labyrinth of opposite testimonies; and, confused by a multiplicity of contradictory and per∣haps fallacious opinions, reflection would be absorbed, and decision at a stand.</P>
<P>The ancients have remarked, that, cultivated by the hand of liberty in the dwellings of freedom, the arts and sciences flourished with invigorated charms; that neither the Persians or Egyptians understood their beauties; that from the Greeks, although too often engaged in hostilities, and struggling in the toils of poverty, they obtained maturation; that they declined with that freedom, once the glory of the Grecian re∣publics, and that, with their august patroness, winging their etherial way to celebrious Rome, they there con∣tinued their splendid career, until the immolation of liberty, in that imperial city, muffled in dark and por∣tentous clouds those intellectual luminaries; and hence, from these incontrovertible facts, it is confi∣dently asserted, that the arts and sciences can never flourish but in the soil of freedom. Yet, in opposition to a conclusion which may have been too hastil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> formed, we are told, that <HI>modern Rome</HI> and Florence have enwreathed with perfection, sculpture, painting, music and poetry; and that Florence, after the usurp∣ations of the family of Medici, made the most rapid proficiency in those arts. Ariosto, Tasso, Galileo, Raphael, and Michael Angelio; these illustrious paint∣ers, poets and mathematicians, it is observed, were not born in republics. Reubens, it is said, collected and established his school at Antwerp, and not at Amster∣dam; and in Germany, the true polish of manners is rather to be found at Dresden than at Hamburgh.</P>
<P>France hath undoubtedly furnished a striking exam∣ple of the prosperity of literature in an absolute gov∣ernment. Philosophy, poetry, dramatic eminence, oratory, history, painting, architecture, sculpture, mu∣sic—these have received the most extensive cultivation, and the highest honours in the <HI>kingdom</HI> of France: And we are moreover assured, that the <HI>cidevant</HI> subjects
<PB N="269" REF="034162_0268_0FFC64B355E813F8"/>
had astonishingly meliorated that most grateful and beneficial of all arts, <HI>l' Art de Vivre,</HI> the necessary and social art, which involves a mutual interchange of sentiments.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>contradictory</HI> are those streams of information, which yet may have originated in the fountain of wis∣dom. The superstructures of governments have gen∣erally been raised upon apprehension and compulsion; in such circumstances, error hath been almost unavoid∣able, and it can never be matter of wonder, that hu∣man systems are susceptible of improvement.</P>
<P>In the novelties of Lycurgus, the features of artifice and fraud are but too prevalent. Solon, although the votary of wisdom, and undoubtedly the mild and be∣neficent friend of mankind, yet even Solon entertained despotic ideas of the powers vested in him, and we can∣not forbear observing, that he considered himself as possessing an <HI>optional</HI> authority, to implant the germe of despotism, or to emit the rays of bland and correct∣ed freedom. Numa, by virtue of the goddess Egeria, might have originated the grossest impositions; and it is an indubitable truth, that the rights of man are irreconcileable with a relinquishment of that privilege of inquiry, which may erect a barrier to the inunda∣tion of evil. Turning, for a moment, from all those reservoirs of knowledge, which, nevertheless, I must ever unceasingly venerate, I wave the occupation of a Gleaner, and simply lighting the torch of reason at the flame of experience, I will, for the organization of my sketch of immunities, consult those sentiments and conclusions, which are the natural growth of a plain mind.</P>
<P>Common sense pronounces, that a people destitute of a leader, and destitute of legislation, loudly demand the <HI>protecting hand of a guardian power;</HI> and, liberty adds, that a chief should be obtained by the joint suf∣frages of the people at large. To this end, they must be convened in their several districts, where, uninflu∣enced by party or by passion, let them commission him, whom they esteem most worthy, to assume that august
<PB N="270" REF="034162_0269_0FFC64B1CC7B09B0"/>
title—<HI>The Father of his Country;</HI> and, after reciprocat∣ing the most solemn engagements, after consecrating him by their joint affections and benedictions, let them invest him with authority to lead them against their combined enemies, to fight their battles, and, by the wisdom of his regulations, to procure them victory, and to guarantee their just immunities. Let this their chosen patriot be aided by a general council, consisting of delegates according to the number of the people. Let these delegates be appointed by a decision, influ∣enced only by the intrinsic worth of the candidates. Let them form two distinct deliberative bodies, or houses, properly qualified and authorized to ACT AS CHECKS upon each other; and, let these three branches be invested with powers, fully adequate to all the pur∣poses of legislation. To the <HI>departments</HI> thus appoint∣ed to these <HI>high offices</HI> of trust, let the utmost veneration be annexed; but I would ordain, that the individuals who filled them, should, after a stated time, be remov∣able at the pleasure of the people. Even the First Magistrate should hold his place but in consequence of frequent re-elections; and for high crimes and misde∣meanors, he should be considered as amenable to the laws. Upon legislative acts he should possess only a conditional negative; and while his fellow-citizens were aided by his counsels, they should be secured from his encroachments. He should always be considered as the Chief Warrior of the people; but in the forma∣tion of treaties, he should call in, at least, one branch of the legislature, and the same concurrence should be necessary to the appointment to offices. The com∣merce or currency of the nation should not be sub∣jected to the prescriptions of its Executive, nor should he arrogate, in matters of conscience, even the shadow of jurisdiction. As a faithful and vigilant friend of the people, he should be unwearied in his informations, recommendations, and all such constitutional measures, as he should conceive would conduce to the public weal; and, during his administration, he should be careful to exact a faithful obedience to the laws. If
<PB N="271" REF="034162_0270_0FFC64B048845028"/>
in any single instance I entrusted him with discre∣tionary or absolute power, it shall be in granting re∣prieves, or remission of offences; for, as I would always give the scale to preponderate on the side of mercy, so I would arm the Executive with the lenity of clemency, while I debarred him the exercise of measures unduly sanguinary.</P>
<P>Yet with the dignified and honorary distinctions of government, I would be careful to invest the Man of the people. Ambassadors, and other public ministers, should mingle in his train, and every rational insignia of respect should ornament his <HI>department.</HI> His <HI>office</HI> should ensure the highest respect; and I would yield obedience to the <HI>individual</HI> as long as he was entitled to <HI>public confidence</HI> and respect.</P>
<P>The judicial power should be separate from the ex∣ecutive, and I would invest it with as large a share of <HI>independence</HI> as could consist with <HI>reciprocality</HI> and <HI>union;</HI> while the degree of guilt involved in crimes of almost every description, should be determined by the empan∣nelled peers of the culprit. "But all this is only col∣lecting the instruments, while the code of institutions are yet unfashioned." True, but as legislative acts should be the result of the most mature deliberation, we will search in the great volume of nature, we will turn over the leaves of experience, and thus selecting the gems, and from time to time accumulating our system, we will finally present the luminous compendi∣um to the consideration, and, as we hope, to the ac∣ceptation of unprejudiced reason. Meanwhile, skim∣ming the surface of my subject, I present only the rudiments of a system, which fancy hath pleasingly contemplated.</P>
<P>Doth the reader exclaim—"<HI>Surely these hints are nothing more than the lineaments of the constitution of the United States!</HI>" Well, honest friend, they are the <HI>lineaments of nature</HI>—the <HI>lineaments of liberty</HI>—they make a part of that contract to which she consents; and, without entering into the complex and admirable intertexture of those united and separate governments,
<PB N="272" REF="034162_0271_0FFC64AB4655C3E0"/>
which constitute our federalism, we pronounce, that these are the leading features of that subordination, without which, GENUINE LIBERTY would no longer irradiate our hemisphere.</P>
<P>May the parties which are originated, stimulate the exertions of her real votaries; may no description among us ever assume the gorgon head of faction; and, may the mutual jealousies, dissentions and ambi∣tion, which pervade, serve as antidotes to each other. Parties, in a state of civil and political liberty, have been compared to the passions of an individual; and, as the passions are said to be the elements of life, so the animated and resuscitating spirit of party is ob∣served to be essential to the existence of genuine free∣dom. Be it so; and may the public weal, the public tranquillity, be, by every means, promoted.</P>

<P>WITH sensations of ineffable complacency and high glee; with feelings, the felicity of which it would be difficult if not impossible to delineate, I set me down, upon this 27th day of May, 1794, to re∣count unto the <HI>good-natured reader</HI> an event, which, if I have not been extremely erroneous in my calcula∣tions, will render him, in no inconsiderable degree, a partaker of my joy.</P>
<P>I say, good-natured reader; for, without incurring the charge of credulity, I conceive I may fairly pre∣sume,
<PB N="273" REF="034162_0272_0FFC64A87A8FE1E0"/>
that persons of this description have, from time to time, been constrained to take an interest in the fate of Margaretta Melworth Hamilton. I say, <HI>good-natur∣ed reader,</HI> because <HI>the Gleaner</HI> hath never yet had the arrogance to conceive his powers sufficiently energet∣ic to arrest the attention of the phlegmatic, the satur∣nine, or the fastidious. Individuals possessing minds cast in these moulds, he hath considered as inaccessible, and he hath imagined them turning from the pages of the Gleaner, with all the frigidity of apathy, with all the glooms attendant upon rigorous severity, disgust, or contempt. Nor doth he enter this remark as a complaint; he hath been <HI>humble enough</HI> to content him∣self with the esteem of the <HI>candid</HI> and <HI>sincere;</HI> in the bosom of sensibility he fondly conceives he hath ob∣tained a place, and he is ambitious of rendering his efforts worthy that degree of consideration with which they may be regarded. Addressing then the humane, the benevolent, and the ingenuous; in one word, those who are willing to be pleased, he hardly hesitates in promising himself at least a hearing: and, he is free to own, that he possesses such a comfortable share of self complacency, as to become confident, that when∣ever he consecrates his efforts by the name of the daughter of his affection, he ensures a share of ap∣probation; nor will he consent that this idea should be imputed altogether to an over-weening conceit of his own abilities; for surely it must be acknowledged that an amiable and meritorious woman, struggling with misfortunes, is an object which virtue must ever regard with commiseration and applause. For the officious length of this exordium, I supplicate the indulgence of those gentle spirits, upon whose favour I have presum∣ed; a candidate for the patronage of benignity should hasten to gratify the feelings of susceptibility, and af∣ter narrating a few previous arrangements, without further delay, I shall pass on to a developement, which hath not only invested our daughter with high afflu∣ence, but hath, moreover, restored to her a blessing, which she entertained not the smallest conception of ever being permitted to possess.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="034162_0273_0FFC64A6C6E92658"/>
My last communications relative to Mrs. Hamilton, crowned her with those honours which bloom most becomingly upon a female brow; the propriety of her conduct in the matrimonial career could not be ques∣tioned, and her patient merit was, in her own opinion, amply rewarded, by a discovery that neither misfor∣tunes or caprice had robbed her of, or in the smallest degree abated the affectionate attachment of him, to whom her gentle heart was unreservedly devoted.</P>
<P>That tumultuous delirium of joy, of which the sketch of the scene in my reading parlour, in the month of November last, can have given but an in∣competent idea, gradually subsided into an exquisitely pleasing calm. Peace, with every accompaniment, which ever clusters in the train of tranquillity, was re∣instated in her bosom; rosy confidence, fruitful in the soil of conjugal complacency, again lifted its auspi∣cious head, and the rich perfumes which it breathed around, scattered those salutary sweets that gave to every object a face of pleasure. Margaretta seemed to regard poverty as the angel of serenity: Indeed a true knowledge of her circumstances had relieved her from a mighty pressure, which, becoming quite insupporta∣ble, had well near broken the slender thread of her ex∣istence; and an assured knowledge that she still possess∣ed those undivided regards, which she had strong rea∣son to believe no longer reciprocated, very naturally, for a time, absorbed in her gentle bosom every other consideration.</P>
<P>Some days delightfully serene, thus rolled on. I knew that the bursting storm, the tremendous and up∣rooting hurricane must succeed; but I trembled to disturb the innocent and unreflecting felicity of the moment. Mr. Seymour, the generous young man who had extricated Hamilton from his difficulties, while hopeless love produced him a wandering fugi∣tive in the southern States, had failed for some thou∣sands; and although repeated letters, glowing with friendship and matchless generosity, penned by the hand of Mr. Seymour, assured us, that he would ward
<PB N="275" REF="034162_0274_0FFC64A3F92F0DA8"/>
the blow from us, to the extremest verge of possibility; yet as he continued, for the safety of his person, a pris∣oner in his own house; as all his books, bonds, and papers, of every kind, were submitted to the inspec∣tion of his creditors; and, as he assured himself that a fair adjustment, producing an amicable compromise, would usher in his liberating hour, the utmost creduli∣ty could not flatter us with continued exemption. Mr. Hamilton too, had many other creditors, and they be∣came much more suspicious, inquisitive, and trouble∣some, than we had expected.</P>
<P>The scene once opened, my knowledge of mankind induced me to fear a rapid succession of distressing events; and necessity, therefore, impelled me to obtrude upon the halcyon hours of my children considerations which threw open the avenues of uncounted cares, and great inquietude. Serafina Clifford continued un∣wearied in her remonstrances; she was eager to dispos∣sess herself, in favour of her brother, of every shilling which she possessed; and against the ardour and gen∣erous impetuosity of her attack, honour, justice, and fraternal affection, although embodied for the purpose, maintained but a doubtful combat; until availing my∣self of the rights invested in me by my paternal author∣ity, I was reduced to the disagreeable alternative of interposing a positive prohibition.</P>
<P>Miss Clifford, in a kind of frenzy, clasped the little William to her bosom, and calling upon the shade of her departed father to witness her engagements, she vowed henceforward to devote herself and fortune entirely to him; adding, <Q>I will, my lovely child, be indefatigable in guarding the soil of thy infant mind from the admission of that fatal germ, which never fails to produce a growth of false principles, of prin∣ciples that prostitute the sacred names of honour and integrity, bestowing them upon an <HI>unsocial kind of pride,</HI> a barbarous sentiment, which compels its ad∣herents, although placed upon a precipice of inter∣minable ruin, to disdain the assistance of that friend∣ship which is warm, natural, glowing, and sincere;
<PB N="276" REF="034162_0275_0FFC649FC62BF8A8"/>
of that friendship, which, as it originates affinity and gratitude, as it is the result of the fondest attachment, and meliorated by deliberate esteem, can surely nev∣er be regarded as problematical. Sweet innocent! may the kindred blood that swells thy little veins, render thee one day less obdurate than thy dear in∣flexible parents. From this moment the interests of Serafina and thine are inseparably interwoven.</Q></P>
<P>Fear not, gentle reader, by virtue of the patriarchal dignity which I have assumed, I will, <HI>upon a proper oc∣casion,</HI> grant unto the said Serafina Clifford, a full and free absolution from this her inconsiderate vow, which I shall take care to impute to the irresistible impulse of an impassioned moment.</P>
<P>In concert with Mr. Hamilton, without delay I took measures to place the property in his possession, beyond the reach of <HI>any single</HI> creditor; regulating it in such a manner, as would incontestibly be most for the advantage of, and yield unto <HI>every claimant an equal</HI> and handsome dividend. Thus prepared for a contingency that we had but too much reason mo∣mently to expect, I requested Mary once more to call into action that admirable address which she had so repeatedly exemplified. Go, my love, said I, with all thy winning graces, and affectionate persuasion; with all thy angel softness, and reconcile our daughter to that revolution in her prospects, which must place her again a resident in this family. Margaretta was far advanced in her second pregnancy, and we judged it necessary to observe, in regard to her, the utmost del∣icacy; but we had not yet learned properly to appre∣ciate the mind of our amiable child. Those particu∣lars, which are generally so alluring to a young woman, were not considered by her, of sufficient importance to give her essential or lasting pain. An establishment, ranking as the head of a family, presiding at her ta∣ble, giving laws to a train of servants, receiving visits in her own house, with a number of <HI>et-ceteras,</HI> which have frequently the power of fascinating a young mind, were regarded as considerations <HI>comparatively</HI> of little
<PB N="277" REF="034162_0276_0FFC649E42F04220"/>
or no moment; and while conscious she possessed the affections of the man of her heart; while she retained his society; while she could clasp to her throbbing bo∣som her lovely infant; while indulged with the pres∣ence of Miss Clifford, now more than ever endeared to her, and bound to her soul by motives of the most del∣icate and indissoluble tenderness and esteem; while she enjoyed the approbating countenance of her parents, her superior understanding could scarce forbear a smile at the solicitude we discovered respecting her removal; and, relinquishing her elegant apartments, I verily be∣lieve without a single murmur, she hastened, together with her amiable friend, to those parental arms which were ever open to receive her.</P>
<P>Trials, however, awaited her. It was necessary that Mr. Hamilton, who was anxious to accelerate the hour that should honourably exonerate him from his embarrassments, and who was extremely desirous of making provision for the growing family which he had in prospect, should immediately apply to some busi∣ness, which might afford an expectation of putting him in possession of wishes so indisputably lauda∣ble. A ship bound for Europe, in which he was offered, with the probability of great commercial advantage, a very lucrative and honorary birth, propitiously presented. Of an opening so fortunate, interest loudly called upon him to avail himself; the favourable gale of opportunity was not to be slighted. But his heart bled for his Margaretta; yet manly de∣cision hesitated not, and every thing was in train for his departure. We conceived it adviseable to conceal our purpose from my daughter as long as possible; and it was not until two days previous to the period destined for his embarkation, that I took upon myself the painful task of disclosing to her an event, which we judged must inevitably take place. Mary, Miss Clif∣ford, Edward and myself, seated with Margaretta, in a retired apartment, had for some time been employed in observing her; while on her part she seemed whol∣ly absorbed in contemplating the features of the little William, who, sleeping on a pillow before her, display∣ed
<PB N="278" REF="034162_0277_0FFC649B6498CA28"/>
a countenance truly cherubic. Soul of sensibility! most unwillingly did I recall her from her maternal reverie! but necessity apparently impelling, I thus ad∣dressed her:</P>
<P>What is there that Mrs. Hamilton would not sacri∣fice, to advance the happiness of the little being, whom she hath introduced into existence? Margaretta start∣ed—it seemed as if her apprehensive bosom compre∣hended, in a single instant, the agonizing intelligence which she was about to receive. She continued, how∣ever, silent, while urged by necessity, I reluctantly pro∣ceeded—There is a duty incumbent upon parents, to∣wards their children, and from the moment of their birth they are bound to every possible exertion, which they can rationally suppose will contribute to their <HI>re∣al felicity.</HI> Upon Margaretta Hamilton claims of this sort will soon be multiplied, and the probability is, that a long train of sons and daughters will rise up and call her blessed. Margaretta will not surely be found deficient in her maternal character; the expen∣ses attendant upon the education of young people, their advancement in life, establishment, &amp;c. how quick∣ly will they succeed. It is happy, that when a single means of acquiring property fails, there are others which present.</P>
<P>The ocean opens its hospitable arms to the unfortu∣nate man, from whom every other resource is cut off; while the dangers, supposed peculiarly incident to a seafaring life are in reality chimeras, calculated only to appal persons unaccustomed to reflect. Those who acknowledge the superintendence of Providence, the existence of Deity, if they ascribe to him those powers and properties which are essential to the being of a God, must acknowledge, that his protecting arm is, upon all occasions, stretched forth; that he can pre∣serve upon the mighty waters with the same facility with which he upholdeth the dweller upon the land. The truth is, we are immortal until the separating warrant passes the great seal of Heaven; and, the breath arrest∣ed by a designation so inevitable, no arrangement can
<PB N="279" REF="034162_0278_0FFC64989B4DF998"/>
redeem. I flatter myself, my beloved Margaretta, that your mind, equal, energetic, and considerate, would not suffer itself to be over much depressed, should the vicissitudes of life produce contingencies, unavoid∣ably condemning you to a few months absence from Mr. Hamilton; two or three voyages might perhaps entirely retrieve his affairs, and you would ever after have the satisfaction to reflect that you had contributed every thing in your power; every thing which forti∣tude and uniform exertions could achieve, in order to re-instate your Edward in that independence to which he was born. I was proceeding—but I had not been sufficiently cautious. My daughter, during my ha∣rangue, frequently changed colour; the lily and the rose seemed to chase each other upon her now mant∣ling, and now pallid cheek; she trembled excessively; and upon my particular application to her, the agita∣tion of her bosom, becoming insupportable, she sunk breathless into the arms of that passionately beloved, and truly afflicted husband, who hasted to prevent her fall.</P>
<P>"My God!" exclaimed Hamilton, <Q>it is too much; restore, compose, and soothe this suffering angel, too often exercised by pangs of so severe a nature; and do, with a wretch who hath betrayed and undone her, whatever seemeth to thee good.</Q></P>
<P>Mary and Serafina soon recalled the fleeting spirit of the lovely mourner. Hamilton once more kneeled before her, and the copious tears, with which he be∣dewed the hand that he alternately pressed to his bosom and to his lips, called forth a mingling stream from the eyes of the beauteous sufferer. The scene was inex∣pressively tender, but the humid drops upon the face of my daughter annihilated at least one half of my fears upon her account. "And can you, Sir," in a tremulous accent she exclaimed—<Q>can you condemn my Edward to bondage, perhaps to irretrievable slavery?</Q> What means my love? <Q>Ah, Sir! do you not recollect British depredations? Do you not rec∣ollect the ruthless and unrelenting rigour of that
<PB N="280" REF="034162_0279_0FFC649518C216C8"/>
fate which awaits the captive, doomed to wear out a wretched life under the galling yoke of an Algerine despot? Might I but have been spared at this time! might a step so fatal to my peace, at least have been deferred, until the face of affairs wore, to the poor, desolate, and exiled voyager, a more confirmed as∣pect, I think I could have acquiesced.</Q> For a mo∣ment she paused; sighs, expressive of the deepest anguish, burst from her bosom. Again she resumed—<Q>Gracious Heaven! what an extensive and wide spreading error hath my early indiscretion proved! and perhaps its cruel consequences will follow me to the latest period of my existence! <HI>Had I waited the parental sanction, ere I lent an ear to a wretch, prac∣tised in the arts of deception;</HI> had I not blindly and precipitately given the reins to reprehensible inclina∣tion, I should never have listened to the pernicious voice of adulation; the faithful heart of my Edward would not have received a corroding wound; he would not have been impelled to a voluntary banish∣ment; he would never have had recourse to an ex∣pedient, which hath too surely involved in ruin my terrestrial hopes! Forgive me, O my parents! for∣give me, O thou best of men! and thou sleeping innocent, forgive, O forgive thy wretched mother! It is now indeed that Margaretta is completely un∣done!</Q></P>
<P>I was immeasurably affected; yet I knew that my daughter would soon become capable of reasoning. She possesses, in an uncommon degree, the power of accurately discussing points, in which she is the most deeply interested; but altogether unprepared for the present calamity, reason had been violently forced from the helm, and we unitedly endeavoured to re∣store her to that reflection, to which we well knew she was eminently adequate. The soothings of unques∣tioned friendship are the sweetest solace; they yield a balm which is endowed with the sovereign power of mitigation, and they are a consolation in almost every sorrow. It was necessary to bend the mind of Mar∣garetta
<PB N="281" REF="034162_0280_0FFC649394B529A8"/>
to our purpose, and a few hours accomplished our wishes; gradually we opened our plan; she saw the propriety of every arrangement; the necessity for the steps we had taken, and the idea, then first held up, of the possibility that the time was not far distant, which might legally immure her Hamilton within the walls of a prison, produced the expected effect. Wav∣ing her snowy hand with peerless grace, she pressed it upon her closed lips, and bowing her afflicted head, thus tacitly gave that expressive, although melancholy assent, of which, from the beginning, considering the justness of her way of thinking, we had made ourselves sure. Two days, as I said, only remained, and they were marked by a deeper sorrow, than any which has yet pierced the bosom of my daughter! It will not be doubted, that we called into action every motive which could give energy and firmness to her feelings; yet, while pensive resignation dwelt upon her lips, her altered countenance and debilitated frame evinced the struggles of her soul. It was a trial upon which she had never reckoned; in every event, she had calculated upon the supporting presence of her husband, and that she was thus unprepared for the stroke, must apologize for the agonized emotions with which she submitted to the blow! The evening at length arrived, which we conceived destined to usher in the morning, upon which our adventurer was to depart for a neigh∣bouring town, in order to his embarkation, and its progress was noted by the heart-felt sighs of corrod∣ing anguish.</P>
<P>But just at this juncture, unfortunately, as I then imagined, our Federal Government interposed the late embargo, and joy once more mantled upon the cheek of Mrs. Hamilton. Thus it is, we submit to necessity; we are convinced of the utility of certain arrange∣ments, and we are constrained, by conviction, to yield our assent to events which, nevertheless, pierce the bo∣som with the barbed arrows of affliction: Yet, if an interposing hand breaks the order to which we had reluctantly submitted; if we are conscious that we
<PB N="282" REF="034162_0281_0FFC649153923548"/>
have no how aided in producing the incident; if we have, in every respect, acted up to our duty, we seem to forget the good we had expected; we rejoice in a change, which emancipates us from those sorrows we had imposed upon ourselves; we seem to have attain∣ed the goal of felicity; and, for a little moment, we become unmindful of those compulsory considerations, which had urged the application of a remedy, ac∣knowledged indispensably requisite. Margaretta, not∣withstanding the good sense of which she is mistress—notwithstanding the remonstrances of reason—not only regarded the embargo as a reprieve, but involuntarily breathed her wishes for its continuance; and I produce it as an irrefragable fact, that our country contains not a single partizan, whose bosom glowed with more ill-advised zeal, for the extension or renewal of this same embargo. The 25th instant, however, arrived—it passed—the fleet and welcome footsteps of no new commissioned express gladdened the ear of impetuosity—and the embargo expired—Hamilton was again on the eve of his departure. Yesterday, exactly at one o'clock, we were assembled in the dining parlour. This very morning was to have witnessed the agon∣ized moment of separation—and melancholy dejection brooded in the countenance of Margaretta.</P>
<P>My servant, a man whom I have loved for these forty years, entered:—"A stranger, Sir, is importu∣nate to see you." Admit him, by all means. Marga∣retta was hasting from the parlour; she was solicitous to hide her grief from the observation of the uninter∣ested; but the stranger was close upon the heels of the servant, and not being able to make her escape, she withdrew to the window.</P>
<P>The gentleman, the stranger, I say, entered; upon his features were imprinted the strongest marks of per∣turbed and tender anxiety; and, moreover, they were features <HI>with which I was confident I had long been familiar,</HI> although, for my soul, I could not recollect at what time, or in what place, they had met my view. He, however, fixing his inquiring eyes, with impatient
<PB N="283" REF="034162_0282_0FFC648DF94DD0A8"/>
solicitude, on the face of my wife, and drawing up a heavy sigh, thus laconically apologized:</P>
<P><Q>Excuse me, Madam, excuse me, Sir—but my feel∣ings disdain ceremony.</Q> The scrutiny under which the countenance of Mary passed, was soon performed; and Miss Clifford next engaged the attention of a man, who, but for the benign ascendancy, which, amid the most tumultuous agitation I had ever witnessed, was still conspicuous in his countenance, I should have con∣cluded, entirely deprived of reason.</P>
<P>"You are lovely," he exclaimed, addressing Miss Clifford, <Q>but you are not the angel—at least, I think you are not—of whom I am in pursuit.—Tell me, Mr. Vigillius; tell me, ye incomparable pair! ye who have still continued the matchless guardians of my long lost and unceasingly lamented Margaretta, what apartment in this happy dwelling contains my only surviving treasure?</Q> Margaretta, who had sought to hide her sorrow-marked visage from the gaze of a stranger, now, lost in astonishment, mechanically turning from the window, presented to his view her tearful face; she catched a glance, and, faintly shriek∣ing, would have sunk upon the floor, had not the stranger, whom we now regarded with a kind of indig∣nant horror, snatched her to his embrace! Our re∣sentment, however, soon gave place to all those en∣raptured emotions, which the accession of high and unexpected felicity originates in the bosom, when, in a voice expressive of paternal tenderness, of paternal transport, he soothingly said—</P>
<P><Q>Compose yourself, my lovely, my admirable, my inimitable child! It is a <HI>father's</HI> arms that are at length permitted to enfold his long lost Marga∣retta!!! Arbuthnot, thou shalt no more invade my rights; it is again given me to possess my child, and all her beauteous mother stands confest! Saint∣ed spirit—this hour shall render thy elysian still more blessed!</Q></P>
<P>Margaretta shrunk not from his embraces: Strange as it may appear, her agitated spirit did not entirely
<PB N="284" REF="034162_0283_0FFC648BC619D808"/>
suspend its functions; and while she seemed, in the arms of the stranger, an almost lifeless corse, her lips yet moved, and every charming feature received an extatic kind of ejaculatory impression.</P>
<P>Among the trinkets belonging to her mother, which had come into her possession on the death of Mrs. Ar∣buthnot, was a miniature picture of her father: Per∣haps there was not a single day, on which she did not gaze with filial devotion upon this picture. It was a striking likeness; and, by its general contour, her mind was strongly impressed. Hence the effect pro∣duced, by a single glance at the original; and it was a frequent observation of this picture, that occasioned the confused recollection, for which, upon the first ap∣pearance of the stranger, I was at a loss to account.</P>
<P>It cannot be matter of wonder, that at an interview so astonishingly interesting, not an individual retained that self-command, so requisite to common forms: At length, however, recollection resumed, in a degree, its office. Mary conducted Mrs. Hamilton to a sofa, when, a flood of tears unlocking for her the powers of utterance, with a look of profound and dignified veneration, she quitted her seat, and suddenly kneeling before the honoured man, in this devotional attitude, with clasped hands, and in broken accents, she per∣turbedly questioned—<Q>Art thou a spirit blest—dis∣patched from Heaven's high court to soothe thy sorrowing child?—or art thou indeed my father? Hast thou never tasted death? and, if thou hast not, by what miracle didst thou escape those tremendous waves, which we have supposed commissioned for thy destruction?</Q> Mr. Melworth, forsooth, to say it was he, his very self, raised his kneeling child, and again clasping her to his paternal bosom, in strains of exquisite tenderness, affectionately replied—</P>
<P><Q>Be comforted, my love; be composed, my heart's best treasure; I am indeed thy father. At a proper time, thou shalt be made acquainted with every par∣ticular; and, in the interim, as I have been inform∣ed of thy embarrassed circumstances, know, that
<PB N="285" REF="034162_0284_0FFC648A40CF61D8"/>
riches, more than thou canst want, are in my gift. Thou shalt introduce me to thy worthy husband. I am apprized of the whole of thy sweetly interesting story; and thy happiness shall, if possible, be equal to thy merit.</Q> Margaretta, wild with transport, now raised her eyes and hands to Heaven, and the most extravagant and incoherent expressions of joy were upon her lips. "Then he shall not go," she ex∣claimed—<Q>Avaunt, ye brooding fiends, that hover round the land of murder!—ye shall not intercept the virtuous career of Hamilton—ye shall not pre∣sume to manacle those hands that have, a thousand times, been stretched forth to wipe the tear from the face of sorrow—Avaunt, ye hell-born fiends!—Al∣giers, united for his destruction, shall not detain him; for lo, a blessed father descends from heaven, to save his well near sinking Margaretta!</Q></P>
<P>Edward, who, from the entrance of Mr. Melworth, had remained, as it were, entranced, or petrified by as∣tonishment, roused by his fears for the reason of Mar∣garetta, now coming forward, prostrated himself at the feet of Mr. Melworth. No one possessed sufficient composure to introduce him—nor was this necessary; the strong sensations which pervaded his almost bursting heart, inscribing upon every manly and ex∣pressive feature, veneration, joy, gratitude, and appre∣hension, emphatically pointed him out, and rendered a doubt impossible.</P>
<P>But why continue a scene, which may, <HI>perhaps, be conceived,</HI> but which words can never delineate? <HI>Our mutual congratulations; our mutual expressions of felici∣ty; the best affections of which humanity is capable; the most rapturous sensations of delight; these were all in course—and these were all afloat;</HI> and I will only add, that Edward will not proceed on his voyage—that Margaretta is happy—that every creditor shall be am∣ply satisfied; and I hereby advertise—let them pro∣duce their several claims; they shall receive to the last farthing, yea, and liberal interest too. Seymour—generous Seymour!—if this Magazine shall reach
<PB N="286" REF="034162_0285_0FFC6487DEC93DA8"/>
thee, before thou hearest from thy friend, know, that the hour of thy emancipation is at hand, and that a full reward awaiteth thee, for all the munificent deeds which thou hast so munificently devised.</P>
<P>And, gentle reader, for thy consolation, I give thee my word and honour, that the very next Gleaner, by recounting to thee every particular, relative to Mr. Melworth, which shall come to my knowledge, shall, if it is within the compass of my power, amply gratify a curiosity, which thou needest not hesitate to own, and which I should have been mortified in the extreme, not to have excited.</P>

<P>Now, as the fact is, that I am anxiously solicitous to avoid every occasion of offence, I shall (taking into consideration the feelings of sensibility, and properly influenced by an idea of the ingenuity which is its ac∣companiment) wave the description of those delightful sensations, which, in rapturous succession, were the nat∣ural appendages of the introduction of the father of Margaretta. The extatic fondness with which he hung upon the accents of his daughter—the mingling pleasures and regrets—the big emotions which sur∣prised his soul, as he traced each lovely feature—those well-known features, which exhibited to his view a beau∣teous
<PB N="287" REF="034162_0286_0FFC6484EA837FC8"/>
transcript of those that he had early learned to admire in the face of her departed mother—the ex∣quisite sensations with which he traced the kindred lineaments—comparing them separately and collect∣ively with a miniature of his lady, which he wore in his bosom, and which might have passed for an exact copy of Mrs. Hamilton—the glowing expressions of paternal tenderness, with which he folded the little William to his bosom—the marked approbation, une∣quivocally demonstrated toward every movement of the husband of his Margaretta—the manly and com∣placent regards that he bestowed upon Miss Clifford—the sweet incense of expansive and immeasurable praise, that he addressed to me, styling me the saviour, the benefactor, the genuine father of his poor orphan girl—the elevated regards, short only of adoration, which he devoted to my dear Mary—those charming effu∣sions, consisting in expressive looks, broken words, and unambiguous gestures; effusions which were the spon∣taneous growth of uncommon felicity, the reciprocity of exquisite satisfaction which we abundantly inhaled—All this, and whatever else the soul of sensibility can conceive, gladly do I refer to the glowing mind of the <HI>feeling sentimentalist;</HI> and I do hereby invest imagin∣ation, in the utmost latitude of its powers, with full scope; it is impossible it can paint too high; language is indeed insufficient, and the most vivid tints of fancy can alone pourtray.</P>
<P>Nay, gentle reader, I take upon me to assert, that however elaborately thou mayest finish thy picture, after thou has bestowed upon it thy last touches, it may, after all, fall vastly short of the original; and, right sorry am I, that my powers are so circumscribed, as to render it impossible for me to place it in its genuine lustre before thee. But, finite efforts, being doomed to submit to a necessity, the effects of which it must ever be unavailing to lament; we will, without further preamble, proceed in our narration. And here I would not have thee conceive, that I am so unreasonable as to condemn thee to the drudgery of accounting for the
<PB N="288" REF="034162_0287_0FFC648247F7CB80"/>
sudden appearance of Mr. Melworth, nor can I con∣sent, that, setting me down as a descendant of Merlin, thou shouldst place in my hand the magic wand; in∣vest me with the powers of incantation, the gift of working miracles, or, of summoning "<HI>spirits from the vasty deep.</HI>" No, believe me, I am no conjurer, and the better to banish every idea of a supernatural inter∣position, I hasten to bring forward the promised facts. Imagine then, that the tumultuous and perturbed sen∣sations of ungovernable transport, which were conse∣quent upon the late developement, are succeeded by that kind of satisfaction which is the result of high com∣placency in the present, and the most agreeable antici∣pations of the future; or by that state of tranquillity, which must always be considered as a desirable sub∣stitute for the hurricane of the passions, whatever may be the magnitude of the event which produced it. The extreme of joy and sorrow, originating commotions as destructive to the order of the mental system, as the up∣rooting storm to the apparent harmony of the natural world; the mild and equal disposition cannot but re∣gard as a relief, the regular succession of events. Im∣agine that our happy circle is retired to the little apart∣ment sacred to sentimental pleasures; to that apart∣ment, upon which the step of inconsiderate levity, or indifference, obtrudeth not. Margaretta is seated be∣tween her enraptured father, and that husband, who experiences for her exemplary worth, with every rising hour, augmenting admiration and new esteem. Ma∣ry, Serafina and myself, complete the group, and Mr. Melworth, pressing the hand of Mrs. Hamilton, thus commences his interesting communications.</P>
<Q><P>I observed, my dear, the sweet blush that tinged thy lovely cheek, upon my mentioning in terms of rep∣rehension, the name of Mrs. Arbuthnot; yet you must allow for the feelings of a desolate father—but for her unforgiving and obdurate spirit, the probabil∣ity is, that your angelic mother would, at this delight∣ful moment, have partook, and doubled all those ex∣quisitely charming sensations, which swell a parent's
<PB N="289" REF="034162_0288_0FFC6480C39799F8"/>
bosom, and which present such an ample compensation for every evil. From the hour which blessed me with the hand of my Margaretta, she continued sedulously intent on procuring a reconciliation with her sister; for the companion of her youth the sigh of her bosom still arose, and while the utter improbability of obtain∣ing her wishes embittered our most pleasurable mo∣ments, her intense and unavailing solicitude visibly impaired her health!</P>
<P>I flattered myself that the period which gave thee, my love, to her arms, would supply that void in her heart, which, however ardent the attachment of your sex to the man of their choice may be, such is the del∣icacy of the female mind, a tender and respectable <HI>fe∣male friend</HI> can alone fill. Your mother, my dear, was early left an orphan. Her sister had for a long peri∣od reigned supreme in her bosom. Fate presented her not a Mrs. Vigillius; goodness so unexampled is not the growth of every clime; neither was a Sera∣fina Clifford contained in the circle of her connexions. Yet, as I had hoped, the birth of her daughter opened a source of new and exhaustless pleasure; and when she clasped her lovely infant to her bosom, she forgot, for a moment, her sister; but memory, too faithful to its office, officiously presented the mirror.—"Dear im∣placable Henrietta!" she exclaimed, "why wilt thou stand aloof? why wilt thou refuse to heighten the transports of this delicious period? Thy presence, thy sanction would indeed add a completion to my feli∣city, which would mark me the most blessed of women!</P>
<P>The novelty, however, the soft endearments, the thousand nameless perturbations, and tender interest of the maternal character, were powerful alleviations, and the tranquillity of the mother was in a measure re∣stored. Eighteen halcyon months revolved, when fate, as if envious of our felicity, presented me with a pros∣pect of obtaining great emolument, by engaging on board a ship bound for the East-Indies. I was flatter∣ed by the idea of obtaining for my Margaretta and her infant, an elegant independence, and that resolution
<PB N="290" REF="034162_0289_0FFC647D348F2788"/>
which became the superstructure of a basis so proper and so deeply laid, could not be easily shaken. Mar∣garetta, while she acknowledged the eligibility of my plan, shrunk from its execution. Her tenderly ap∣prehensive bosom foreboded a thousand evils. Yet the heroism of her character can never be too much ad∣mired.</P>
<P>"Go, my Charles"—with emotions of tender and unutterable agony, she exclaimed—"since it must be so, go!—and may the upholding hand of Heaven be, in every event, thy never-failing support!" Repeated∣ly she sobbed out the convulsed and agonizing adieu, while ingenious in inventions to retard my departure, she pressed me to her throbbing heart. "Oh! my love," in broken accents she whispered, "if we meet again, we shall then be happy. But alas! alas!" she could not add. Yet still her clasped hands and stream∣ing eyes continued to supplicate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that God, on whom her firm reliance was invariably placed. I was inexpressibly moved. My soul was little less tempested; yet the splendour of my prospects, my pre∣vious arrangements, my pledged honour, all urged me on; and, by one violent effort, I tore myself from the most beloved of women! Our mutual sufferings may be regarded as a prediction of the fatal event. It was decreed that we never more should meet! Propitious gales attended the first part of our voyage, and I had began to anticipate the rich harvest that a few painful seasons would enable me to lay at the feet of my heart's best treasure.</P>
<P>We had already doubled the southern extremity of the great continent of Africa, commonly called the Cape of Good Hope; and, shaping our course north-east to the continent of India, we were proceeding with all dispatch—when, lo! on a sudden, the scowl∣ing atmosphere gathered darkness; dreadfully por∣tentous the winds of heaven arose. Waves beat on waves frightfully tempestuous. The tumultuous ocean seemed to lash the contending skies. Louder and louder the destructive whirlwinds bellowed round.
<PB N="291" REF="034162_0290_0FFC647BAEF1FD78"/>
Hoarse thunders roared terrific peals succeeding peals. The heavens poured forth a deluge of rain, and the forked lightnings were all abroad. Surrounded on every side by the tremendous world of waters, assist∣ance was impossible—no asylum presented. The sea∣man's art was in vain, and death, in its most shocking form, appeared inevitable. But to describe the hor∣rors of our situation is beyond the reach of language. In the latitude in which we then were, there is a large ridge of rocks, they are pointed out in most of our sea charts; but if our pilot was aware of them, it was not in his power to avoid them; they accelerated that fate which, imagining the ship might live many hours, I had not so speedily expected; and, bilging instantly upon one of those rocks, a second stroke severed her in twain! The shrieks of the mariners were shocking be∣yond expression. How long they survived, or what ef∣forts they made, I am not able to say; for, seizing a part of a shattered raft, upon which, floating at the mercy of the winds, and waves, while I momently ex∣pected dissolution, I commended my spirit to that God whose protection and whose favour I had never ceased to invoke.</P>
<P>And how many of the children of men have been constrained to ask, What circumstances are beyond the reach of Omnipotence? <HI>He who holdeth in the hol∣low of his hand, the great deep,</HI> suddenly hushed the winds; and, driven upon a small uninhabited island, my first sensations, it will not be doubted, spontaneously issued in the most grateful orisons to the God of my life, who had thus graciously interposed for my pres∣ervation. But soon the image of my Margaretta, clothed in the habiliments of immeasurable woe, har∣rowed up my soul; her forlorn and helpless situation—her unprotected infant!—My God! madness was in the thought. I was on the point of again plunging into that ocean from which I had so recently escaped; but the good hand of upholding Deity still prevented me, and was still my shield. Gradually the heavens resumed a serene aspect; my mind too became astonish∣ingly
<PB N="292" REF="034162_0291_0FFC647A2C028678"/>
calm; and, drying the only vestments which now remained to me upon a sun-beat rock, whose craggy sides received the most intense rays of that luminary, beneath the foliage of a sheltering tree I stretched my weary limbs. Sleep spread over me its downy mantle, and I obtained a temporary oblivion of those lacerat∣ing reflections, with which succeeding hours, in dread∣ful order, appalled my sinking spirits.</P>
<P>Necessity compelled me to search out the good, if any remained, which was yet within my grasp. At the salutary stream I slaked my thirst; the nutri∣tious berry, zested by hunger, afforded me a delicious repast, and by one soothing hope I was still buoyed up: I traced unequivocal vestiges of the human step—ships, I was positive, had recently touched there—I might yet recognize my fellow man—I might yet be borne to my native isle. Despair, however, too often gained the ascendancy, and at such intervals, inexpres∣sible anguish overwhelmed my soul. But it is impossible to paint the unequalled calamities of his situation, who is thus circumstanced. Even the glowing imagination of a Thomson could only sketch them. Yet, not a revolving hour but heard me, to the listening echo, repeat—
<Q><L>Unhappy he! who from the first of joys,</L>
<L>Society, cut off, is left alone</L>
<L>Amid this world of death. Day after day,</L>
<L>Sad on the jutting eminence he sits,</L>
<L>And views the main that ever toils below;</L>
<L>Ships, dim discover'd, dropping from the clouds;</L>
<L>At evening to the setting sun he turns</L>
<L>A mournful eye, and down his <HI>dying heart</HI></L>
<L>Sinks hopeless; while the <HI>wonted roar</HI> is up,</L>
<L>And hiss continual through the tedious night.</L></Q>
But forever blessed be the all-gracious Disposer of events! the term of my sufferings was cut short. It was the employment of my first rational moment, af∣ter I had been thrown upon the island, to make, with a part of my clothing, a signal of distress. Upon a prominent angle ascended a small acclivity, on the summit of which stood the tall trunk of a tree, that
<PB N="293" REF="034162_0292_0FFA6529311D45D0"/>
contending storms had stripped of its branches. To this disrobed trunk I contrived to fasten the beacon of my distress, and I consecrated it, with many supplica∣tions to Him who was alone able to save.</P>
<P>The morning of the fifth day (after I had so providentially escaped the waves) broke divinely se∣rene. An amazing continuity was outstretched before me. With solded arms, and an aching heart, I con∣templated the extensive main. The frightful solitude, the awful stillness to which I was condemned, arose dreadfully terrific to my soul. I threw abroad my anxiously inquiring gaze; a cloud seemed to gather at a distance—It is not a cloud—What can it be?—Swiftly it approaches—Great God! is it possible?—Saviour of sinners! it is, indeed, the white sails of a Heav∣en directed bark!—It is bending toward me!—Ah! it recedes, and my bounding spirit dies within me!</P>
<P>Again, however, its altered course bore rapidly down upon my desolate abode. The insignia of ca∣lamity reared not in vain its petitioning head. The necessary arrangements were made. The boat was manned. My heart leaped exulting; it was too big for its prison. My tongue refused utterance, while, with that commiserating cordiality, which seamen know so well to practise, and which is a characteristic trait of their order, I was received on board the ship. To complete my joy, the captain and crew were English. The captain was a humane and venerable man, who had numbered more than threescore years: A shower of tears relieved my bursting heart. I told my tale of woe, and he regarded me with even paternal goodness. Few know how to respect the unfortunate; inestimable are the soothings of benevolence to the children of ad∣versity.</P>
<P>A tedious voyage was now to be performed: and although a proper sense of the divine interposition in my favour, forbid every murmur, yet a recurrence to those pangs which I well knew would lacerate the gentle bosom of her my soul held most dear, could not fail of pointing the keenest arrows of affliction! Ten long
<PB N="294" REF="034162_0293_0FFC6475AAADE358"/>
months (dating from the time of my departure) per∣formed their tedious round, ere the white cliffs of Al∣bion again met my longing gaze. With what extacy did I leap upon the strand. To the parent soil I low∣ly bent my head; with filial lips I kissed the kindred turf, and my bounding spirit, struggling with its ming∣ling sensations, poured forth the rapt orisons of a ship∣wrecked, exiled, rescued, and restored man! On the wings of speed I hasted to my native village; to that village which I supposed contained my only treasure. But what became of me, when, posting to the apart∣ments of Margaretta, I found them occupied by stran∣gers!—Yet, hope still whispered she had removed to some other abode; and I hasted to the dwelling of a friend, from whom I learned the sum of my misfor∣tunes!!</P>
<P>You are, my friends, acquainted with the feelings of the heart. Every feature in your expressive coun∣tenances are vouchers of your sensibility—Why should I aim at delineation!</P>
<LG>
<L>When to the height of hopeless sorrow wrought,</L>
<L>The fainting spirit feels a pang of thought,</L>
<L>Which, never painted in the hues of speech,</L>
<L>Lives at the soul, and mocks expression's reach.</L>
</LG>
<P>I drop the curtain over a train of succeeding ills; sickness, loss of reason, comfortless calamities!</P>
<P>Mrs. Arbuthnot, when she accompanied her hus∣band to Ireland, bore my child with her. My aged, widowed mother, gently remonstrated. My supposed death, and the demise of Margaretta, had centered her every remaining wish in the little prattler. Mrs. Ar∣buthnot plead the dying injunctions and bequest of her sister. This was decisive. The regulations sug∣gested by the everlastingly absent should be deemed inviolably sacred, and my mother with floods of una∣vailing tears submitted. A few painful weeks devoted to heartfelt regret, had succeeded a separation judged unavoidable, when my unfortunate mother received a line from Mrs. Arbuthnot, acquainting her that the little Margaretta was no more. This proved a finish∣ing
<PB N="295" REF="034162_0294_0FFC6473F1A12788"/>
stroke. So many calamities, in such swift succes∣sion, treading upon the heels of each other, brought down the grey hairs of my aged parent with sorrow to the grave. Could she have been spared to have witnessed the returning footsteps of the son of her youth, a gleam of joy would have diffused its genial and solac∣ing influence over her parting spirit. But Heaven de∣creed otherwise, and she closed a life, the sorrows of which had accumulated with every added moment! What could induce Mrs. Arbuthnot to pen a misrepre∣sentation, calculated to pierce with so keen a shaft the bosom of an aged and sorrow worn sufferer, I can only conjecture. Probably she might be influenced by her plan of passing the child for her own; or, she might imagine that my mother, being invested with the rights of a parent, would again demand the child, should the contingencies, peculiar to a soldier's life, remove Cap∣tain Arbuthnot (whom it was well known she deter∣mined to follow) to a remote or foreign destination; and it may be presumed that she made up the matter in her own mind, by a consideration that if she return∣ed her niece to our village, the extreme age of my mother, would soon leave her destitute of every nat∣ural guide.</P>
<P>For me, after a long and debilitating fever, ob∣taining a state of convalescence,—youth, and a consti∣tution uncommonly good, soon completed my restora∣tion. The same interest which had before placed me on board an East-India ship, procured me a second em∣ployment. I made several successful voyages. I ac∣cumulated riches; and at length saw myself possessed of affluence. But alas! tranquillity was not in the gift of affluence. In the variety by which I was sur∣rounded my heart took no interest; and it refused to acknowledge a second attachment. Yet I determined to regulate my feelings by the dictates of fortitude, and to bend my wayward spirit to a state of acquiescence in the designation of that God who ruleth in the heav∣ens. I became a citizen of the world; and, consider∣ing myself born for the universal family, and for the
<PB N="296" REF="034162_0295_0FFC647088246960"/>
emolument of my fellow men, I industriously made the most of every acquisition. Under the influence of this sentiment I proceeded in the career of life; and if my path produced not those high scented perfumes, of which the exquisite succession of domestic enjoy∣ments is susceptible, I was, notwithstanding, so far favoured, as to obtain a degree of composure. Thus rolled on succeeding years, until upon an uncommon fine night, three months since, feeling no disposition to retire to my chamber, I felt constrained to devote an hour to a contemplative walk, and after having strolled some moments upon the road-side, I bent my steps toward St. George's fields, where, experiencing an unusual kind of perturbation, with folded arms, and raised eyes, I continued my desultory aberration.</P>
<P>Methought the shade of my Margaretta accom∣panied my steps: The ample heavens, the starry lumi∣naries, the full orb'd moon, the blue expanse; these all combined to image the beauteous form of her, on whom fond remembrance still regretting dwelt.</P>
<P>An association of ideas gave birth to a wish, to pass some moments beside a sketch of those waters, on which, bidding an eternal adieu to the injured sufferer, I had heretofore cruelly embarked; and toward West∣minster bridge I rapidly took my way, which having reached, with an expedition for which I could not ac∣count, I descended the steps of the landing place; but no sooner had I put my foot upon the third stair than an unusual dash of the waters of the Thames, for which the stillness of the night rendered it impossible to assign a reason, still further accelerated my move∣ments. I hasted forward, and was only in time to seize by his garments, an unfortunate man, who had plunged into the stream, with the unwarrantable pur∣pose of putting a period to his existence. I remon∣strated against the atrocious audacity of the deed that he had well near perpetrated, in terms expressive of the horror which it inspired. For a time he preserved an indignant kind of silence; and when he deigned to ut∣ter himself, he breathed only expressions of resentment,
<PB N="297" REF="034162_0296_0FFC646F04BA0D70"/>
for what he termed my officious interposition. It was manifest that his reason was disordered, and pity grew in my soul. I addressed him in the language of com∣miseration, and he gradually became softened and com∣municative.</P>
<P>"Generous stranger," he exclaimed, "I give thee no mark of confidence in the brief recital, which as an apology for my supposed rashness, your apparent com∣miseration demands. To him, who is resolved on death, the disclosure of secrets which effect only himself, can be of little importance. Know then, that, born to af∣fluence, I was bred a gentleman. Know also, that, pursuing my pleasures in a neighbouring kingdom, I saw and <HI>loved</HI> a beauteous woman. I <HI>wooed</HI> and <HI>won</HI> her. Her parents were no more; but her brethren, her sisters, a numerous family, her fortune, her coun∣try, her religion—all these she forsook, and fled with me to our Albion coast. Indiscretion and misfortunes have robbed me of every penny which I possessed. I have no means of obtaining the common necessaries of life; the few articles of which I have not yet dis∣posed, will not discharge the debts already contracted. Those flatterers, who basked in the sunshine of my for∣tune, have now utterly forsaken me. My wife, my beloved wife, and her helpless children, are reduced to the last extremity. I have left no means unassayed, by which I could presume upon relief; but every effort hath proved ineffectual, and I have now quitted my Almira, with an expressed hope, for which, alas! there is no foundation. She will expect me with the return∣ing sun; but she will no more behold me. I can no longer exist a witness of those ills, of which I have been the wretched cause!" Need I add, that I was eager to speak, to this son of sorrow, the words of consola∣tion? Considering myself as the banker of the unfor∣tunate, his draught upon me was indisputable; and the rays of night's fair empress, lent a light sufficiently strong, to evince the authenticity of its characters.</P>
<P>I accompanied my new claimant, now incredulous, and now frantic with joy to his dwelling. I had de∣termined
<PB N="298" REF="034162_0297_0FFC646C828DD6D0"/>
to keep guard the remainder of the night. We entered softly. His little family had retired to rest. I insisted that he should instantly speak peace to his beloved. I insisted that he should not revisit the par∣lour, until the rising sun should enable me to commence my proposed arrangements. I will repose, said I, in this easy chair; or here are books, with which I may a∣muse myself. Awed by that tone of authority which I had assumed, with looks of astonishment, and the most profound obeisance, he left me; and sleep being beyond my reach, I endeavoured to obtain sufficient composure to amuse myself by reading. I turned over the books—it would not do. A new and painful kind of agitation hurried my spirits; at length a parcel of Magazines seized my attention. I glanced confu∣sedly upon the bundle. The Massachusetts Magazine caught my eye—<HI>an American production</HI>—curiosity was enlisted; I opened one and another; an irresistible impulse still urged me on; the first page of the Mag∣azine for March, 1792, arrested my ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—"<HI>Bless me, cried Margaretta,</HI>"—you will recollect, Sir, that you thus commenced the enchanting narrative.</P>
<P>The appellation <HI>Margaretta</HI> vibrated interestingly upon my ear; it was the sweet talisman of a thousand mingling sensations; no power on earth could have prevented my reading on. I accompanied you in your journey to South-Carolina, and I entered with you the city of Charleston. The little Margaretta's tap at the door possessed a fascinating power—the in∣troduction of the lovely cherub penetrated my very soul; I waited impatiently for the issue; I attended at the bed of death—but, great and good God! what were my sensations when I heard from the lips of Mrs. Arbuthnot, the well known story of my Marga∣retta's sufferings—when I learned that the dear pledge of our sacred loves was yet alive! when I recognized her in the person of the little petitioner—when I be∣came assured that she had been received by such pro∣tectors! I shrieked aloud, wrung my hands, wept, laughed, prostrated myself in adoration of a preserving
<PB N="299" REF="034162_0298_0FFC646931F57978"/>
God—traversed up and down the apartment, until, at length impelled by perturbed anxiety, I was constrain∣ed to trace my daughter's wondrous fortune through the various Magazines, which, until the close of the month of November last, presented themselves in or∣der before me. How did my full soul bless her god∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e benefactors! During the connexion with Court∣land, the most tumultuous agitations tempested my bosom; but the catastrophe, I conceived, gave her honoured guardians a title to almost divine honours. Again I became a prey to all those agonizing fears which can lacerate a father's heart. Even of Miss Clifford, I must confess, that I was not a little suspi∣cious. My feelings against thee, my son, were replete with indignation; and I bestowed upon thy supposed inconstancy a parent's malediction. But November presented the extatic eclaircissement. I saw that nothing was wanting, but what I possessed abundant ability to supply; and, in broken and almost frantic ejaculations, I sobbed out my gratitude. The dawn at length broke. Memorable, ever memorable night! Never, never can I be forgetful of the events which thou produced!</P>
<P>An early hour presented the now not despairing Altamont. He led his Almira by the hand. I had cautioned him not to shock the delicacy of her feel∣ings, by a recital of the extremity to which he had been precipitated; and he had been discreet enough to follow my advice. He had simply informed her that Heaven had sent him a friend, and this informa∣tion had proved sufficient to excite the most lively emo∣tions. Altamont began a speech expressive of his gratitude; but I cut him short, by decisively pronoun∣cing, that fate had ordained me eternally his debtor. My disordered countenance, and the energy of my manner, alarmed him; and he in his turn became doubtful of <HI>my</HI> reason. I gave him, however, a sim∣ple relation of facts. I held up the divine pages. Had I not met thee; had I not consented to deliver to thee that dividend of our common Father's interest, with
<PB N="300" REF="034162_0299_0FFC68F29C822FF0"/>
which he has entrusted me for thy behoof, I had not met these blessed records; I had not received intelli∣gence, which hath communicated to my soul immeas∣urable felicity. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> amply hath our God rewarded me for designing an act of common justice.</HI></P>
<P>Grateful tears of rapture, it will not be doubt∣ed, we mingled. Every thing was speedily adjusted to the complete satisfaction of Altamont and his Al∣mira. With the first ship, I embarked for America. The name of Colonel Worthington, of New-Haven, was my clue; and I bore with me the heaven inspired Magazines. From Colonel Worthington I learned every necessary particular. I was told, my son, of your intended voyage, of the consequent anguish of my daughter's soul. I bless God that I am in time to prevent its prosecution. Every individual shall re∣ceive his dues; that good young man, your <HI>forbearing friend,</HI> the benevolent Seymour—every one shall be happy!</P></Q>
<P>Unwilling to leave the curiosity of the reader un∣gratified, during the tardy revolution of another month, I have felt myself necessitated to curtail the narrative of Mr. Melworth. Many useful observa∣tions are omitted. The frequent interruption, breaks, and pauses, occasioned by the susceptibility of Mrs. Hamilton, and the agitation of her father; the unbounded and venerating gratitude of Edward; and the combining admiration, and rapt felicity of our whole party; all this was in course, and to every thing of this sort, I must repeat, that the silently expressive touches of that vivid pencil, which is found in the glowing hand of fancy, can alone do justice.</P>
<P>Already our young people have resumed their ele∣gant family seat. Miss Clifford is still the companion of Margaretta. Amelia Worthington is now a congrat∣ulating visitor at Hamilton-Place. Mr. Melworth is for the present a resident in that sweetly romantic man∣sion; and this very morning, the second day of July, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-four, witnes∣sing the birth of a daughter to Margaretta, hath seem∣ed to complete our family felicity.</P>

<P>THE multifarious ligaments which bind fam∣ilies together, being the handy-work of na∣ture, and essentially or closely interwoven with our existence, that shock must be indeed violent, that can burst them asunder. It is true that a long continued series of disobligation may obscure the vivid glow of those images, which nature and habit have impressed upon the intellect. Unkindness is the opaque body, which intercepts the sunny beams of luminous and in∣born tenderness; but the eclipse is seldom total, and the cheering influence of affection is frequently invig∣orated, and often becomes the more transcendent, for the momentary obstruction, by which it seemed well near enveloped.</P>
<P>Surely that heart must be strangely deficient, which the pleasing sensations that are attendant upon the first stage of being, hath not indelibly impressed; and, that mind is unwarrantably implacable, which, intrenched by inexorable inflexibility, is incapable of being roused to the tenderness of recollection; which is not softened by the remonstrances of nature, fur∣nished with arguments, drawn from a series of endear∣ing and substantially beneficial proofs, of a generous attachment. Yet I know there are a variety of com∣bustibles, which although perhaps not radically natives of the human soil, having, however, obtained a growth therein, and once taking fire, it is difficult to say where the conflagration may end. I am aware there are in∣juries which pride and self estimation, consider as un∣pardonable. It is a melancholy truth there are ob∣durate hearts; and, it may be, that the strong winds
<PB N="302" REF="034162_0301_0FFC68EFDA8F3D78"/>
of passion may obliterate, or uproot from the bo∣som every proper sensation of the soul. But grant∣ing that the empoisoned plant may become rampant in the rancorous breast, the Gleaner, while engaged in the routine of his profession, hath at no moment bound himself to select the noxious weed; he confesses he is fond of culling the flowers of humanity, and that, with these, as often as may be, he is solicitous to furnish and adorn his page.</P>
<P>To the well regulated mind, the contemplation of family harmony is inexpressibly pleasing. The phi∣lanthropic speculator views the little society unaltera∣bly attached, bound together by the strong cords of mutual affection, and rising superior to the adverse in∣fluence of separate or selfish claims, as a miniature of that vast family of man, which futurity shall see col∣lected under the protecting auspices of a benign and paternal God. Order, unbroken confidence, celestial tenderness, energetic love—in this august assembly, these shall all triumphantly officiate. Peaceful an∣gels shall hover round; discord shall find no entrance there; offences shall be no more; but truth, sky ro∣bed innocence, unimpeached integrity, unblemished virtue, and undeviating holiness, shall be established, <HI>from everlasting to everlasting, and of their dominion there shall be no end.</HI> Yes, it is pleasing to trace the strik∣ing resemblance which is exemplified in the animated sketch. Mild, affectionate and <HI>judiciously</HI> indulgent parents; duteous and confiding sons and daughters; mutually complacent, and unequivocally attached brothers and sisters. The royal bard of Israel, striking∣ly, feelingly, and poetically delineates the family of love: "<HI>Behold how good, and how pleasant it is for breth∣ren to dwell together in unity.</HI>" Well might the sacred poet summon the aid of a splendid fancy, and arrest the most expressive figures to image the fine effects and pleasing utility of domestic complacency; the rich perfumes which consecrated the anointed priest of the Hebrew tribes, the fertilizing dew descending up∣on Hermon's verdant summit, and resting with ge∣nial
<PB N="303" REF="034162_0302_0FFC68EBB1FD93B0"/>
influence upon the adjacent eminence; these but shadow forth the sublimity of that union, upon which our God hath commanded a blessing, which originates a dignified and blissful immortality.</P>
<P>Yes, it is pleasing to trace the striking resemblance which is exemplified in the animated sketch. The contemplation of domestic harmony soothes and ele∣vates the mind, and although it is undeniably true, that the philosopher will extend his regards from the little group which constitutes his <HI>relative circle, to friends, to country, to the universe at large, until he commences a citizen of the domain of heaven;</HI> yet he will not refuse to acknowledge those ardors, those hopes, and those fears, which upon his opening mind, in the white winged hours that marked his dawn of being, were, by the strong hand of nature, irreversibly engraved.</P>
<P>Affection is very properly said to descend; and it is generally true, that while we venerate with pious duty the authors of our being, while our hearts are warm∣ed for them by love and reverence, we are in the same moment impelled to acknowledge for our offspring, augmented and more energetic tenderness. Nature, it is said, hath implanted these superior and irresisti∣ble sensations, for the purpose of nerving our efforts for the preservation and advancement of the infant candidate; but, be this as it may, in whatever wise regulations it hath originated, the fact is indubitable. Family ties of every description are variously respect∣able, and variously estimable, in their various depart∣ments: I have been lately led to an appreciation of their comparative value by a disquisition on which I was a silent attendant, that aimed at deciding what relative character deserved the preference. The investi∣gation was rather curious than important; but it serv∣ed, however, to amuse, during a vacant hour, which might have been worse appropriated.</P>
<P>The attachment of a well informed and tender fa∣ther, to an amiable and grateful daughter, has been said to resemble that which is experienced by a guar∣dian angel, to the being who is committed to his charge
<PB N="304" REF="034162_0303_0FFC68EA1AAB4D10"/>
—tender, delicate, and divested of all that can debase, the paternal eye regards with immeasurable com∣placency, his beauteous, his dependent child; and the finest feelings of his soul become embodied. To pro∣tect her from every ill he is sedulously attentive; his judicious cautions hover round her inexperienced steps; his protecting arm would present the invulnerable shield; and his auspices are those of wisdom. Ever vigilant, ever upon his guard, to save her, even from the imputation of dishonour, he would consider his life as a comparatively trivial sacrifice. It is true that he is impassioned, but his ardours are those of virtue; his affections are pure, innocent, laudable, elevated, and refined; and, originating in nature, orig∣inating in God, they will be perfected in heaven. All this is irrefragably just, and yet I take leave to ob∣serve, that the <HI>fraternal</HI> department, when filled by a good and virtuous mind, more exactly answers the ideas which I have indulged, of that attendant cher∣ub, ordained to tread with holy vigils, the destined path of the expecting voyager. In contemplating the character of a father, however beneficial its offices, we can hardly forbear recollecting, that, having pro∣duced the being which is cherished, the consequent at∣tachment may be the result of that <HI>selfish principle</HI> which so universally, more or less, actuates the human mind; and, it is undeniably true, that the operation of a <HI>selfish principle</HI> essentially diminishes the lustre of the most beneficial and exemplary action.</P>
<P>A brother, it hath been divinely observed, is born for adversity; a gentle and confiding female can hard∣ly boast a more agreeable or <HI>disinterested</HI> relation; the general arrangements of nature authorizes a hope, that his protection will continue coeval with her mor∣tal career, and if he fulfils the duties of the fraternal name, he will still continue a natural, patronizing, and consolatory resource. What eye is not charmed by a view of the marked and delicate attention, which is paid by an elegant young man to the gentle and ac∣complished maiden, who is the daughter of his father
<PB N="305" REF="034162_0304_0FFC68E88559CBF8"/>
and of his mother. Grant that opportunities of this kind are extremely rare, the sensations derived there∣from are, nevertheless, in a superior degree, pleasing. The attachment of a brother to a sister, if it is genu∣ine and sincere, if it corresponds with the designation of unadulterated and upright nature, partakes the ex∣quisite delicacies and refinements of love, devoid of its tumultuous caprices, or interested and ungovernable fervors; with ineffable satisfaction it yields that pro∣tection, to which nature and education combine to give the sex a claim. It is not stinted in its regards; it is tender, elevated and refined; it is generous and com∣municable; it is sympathetic and permanent. A true brother unites the duties of the <HI>paternal,</HI> with the more equal, sweet, and social pleasures of the <HI>fraternal</HI> in∣tercourse; the heart of a brother hesitates not to ac∣knowledge the bland, endearing, and indissoluble ties of amity. A true brother is at all times a guardian friend; he rejoiceth in his fraternity; and, I repeat, that his attachment may claim kindred with those sen∣timents, which are supposed to actuate the tenderly watchful seraph, who, commissioned by the high court of Heaven, enters with the first moment of our exist∣ence upon his trust, and fulfils his celestial mission, by attending through every stage of life his progressing charge.</P>
<P>Richardson exhibits the character, proper to a Broth∣er, in the most vivid and glowing hues; but if his Grandison originated not in fiction, the portrait doubt∣less owes many embellishments to the incomparable pen of that inimitable writer. It is a melancholy fact, that eminent virtue, of whatever description, is a gem that the hand of nature, however indulgent, hath too seldom produced. Yet, for the honour of humanity, I cannot deny myself the gratification of affirming that I, at this moment, contemplate <HI>more than one brother</HI> who hath uniformly supported that endearing character. Who, as far as circumstances have called them forth, have amply proved their title to rank in the <HI>same grade with Richardson's finely imagined delineation.</HI></P>

Much do I regret that I am not authorized to name those fair examples, which, through a course of years, I have been accustomed to admire. But the emblaz∣oning voice of fame might possibly tinge their cheeks with the hue of disapprobation; for it is certainly true, that genuine merit "<HI>Does good by stealth, and blushing finds it fame.</HI>" Yet, if, while sketching the outlines of characters so replete with excellence, their celebrity should induce the finger of perception to point out the living portraits, the Gleaner presumes he ought not to be made responsible for consequences which, by the foreign traits wherewith he hath studiously diversified his descriptions, he hath been solicitous to avoid. It is indubitably an exalted and sublime kind of pleasure which we derive from a view of transcendent worth; and that writer should at least be considered as venial, who, fond of contributing to enjoyments resulting from an unexceptionable source, is careful to collect instances which adorn and elevate his species. A laudable mo∣tive is justly admitted as an advocate for the propriety of an action. If it issues pure from the fountain of rectitude, we are not, I have conceived, to be regarded as responsible, for the adventitious mixtures which it may connect, as it winds its course through the murky grounds of opinion, malevolence, misconception or de∣traction. But, be this as it may, the reflections to which this essay owes its being, have originated in a view of <HI>real life;</HI> and the probability is, that if virtu∣ous, informed and judicious parents were multiplied among us, family attachment would be continued, and individuals, branching out in their several directions, would still, however, reverting to their ancient stock, continue encircled by the bonds of amity. <HI>Character</HI> may some time preserve its ascendency over <HI>education;</HI> but education will, nevertheless, remain a powerful agent in the formation both of the heart and the man∣ners; and observation convinces us, if the <HI>principals</HI> exhibit the <HI>pattern,</HI> the family will generally be en∣dowed with the <HI>virtues,</HI> the <HI>graces,</HI> and the <HI>elegance of humanity.</HI></P>

<HI>Happy in my connexions—I have known many charac∣ters</HI> highly worthy of imitation. I have known fathers dignified by the integrity of their hearts, the clearness of their understandings, and the humane and indulgent liberality of their sentiments. I have known mothers, who, superior to the <HI>frivolity</HI> and <HI>want of character,</HI> which is rendered <HI>by education, and subsequent events, pe∣culiarly feminine,</HI> have contrinuted much to the emol∣ument and elevation of their family. Possessing minds capacious and extensively cultivated, truth seems to receive from their lips additional ornament; they express themselves with elegance, precision, and fluency—their language is the language of propriety, and they add a grace to every sentiment which they utter: the sincerity and candour of their dispositions are equalled only by the frankness which is conspicu∣ous in the manners, and gentleman-like deportment of their respectable coadjutors in the voyage of life, and all their plans for the regulation of those who are en∣trusted to their care, are marked by wisdom and una∣nimity.</P>
<P>From such parents we expect a result happy for the individuals immediately under their tuition, and auspi∣cious to society at large. They will early endeavour to endow the minds of those sons and daughters, whom they rear to maturity, with the fortitude so necessary in the voyage of life; they will fashion in the opening mind a disposition which will teach accommo∣dation to the unavoidable evils consequent upon hu∣manity; they will cultivate that spirit of patient re∣signation which is so proper for the dependent being, whose part it is to submit without a murmur to the strokes of Providence, and when called upon to resign into the hands of their Creator God, any of these little individuals, who are rendered by nature and habit incalculably dear, an opportunity being thus fur∣nished to enforce their <HI>precepts</HI> by <HI>example,</HI> no impious expressions will escape their lips; the sighs which they will swell, will be the sighs of submission; with holy acquiescence they will bend to the decrees of Heaven;
<PB N="308" REF="034162_0307_0FFC68DED48CD188"/>
in no instance violating the consistency of their char∣acters, they will support with uniform propriety, the Christian name, and they will possess that applause which should invariably attend the benevolent and the good. In the families of such parents, <HI>regularity</HI> pre∣sides. The morning is ushered in by the devout breathings of cheerful and solemnized spirits, and the return of "<HI>sober suited evening,</HI>" witnesseth their grate∣ful and pious orisons. The various duties of humanity are punctually discharged, and the hours of leisure are uniformly devoted to the cultivation of the minds of those children, whom they design as <HI>natural friends to each other,</HI> and as useful and ornamental members of the <HI>community</HI> to which they appertain.</P>
<P>It was from such a stock that the venerable and truly respectable Hortensius descended; and, having marked with uncommon satisfaction the serene pleas∣ures which gild the evening of his days, we wave the privilege of a novelist, whose character places in his gift a choice of heroes, and hazard the mentioning a character, the original of which, having continued through revolving years the boast of fraternal records, may perhaps immediately occur to the reader, who is at all conversant in the list of those worthies, that in our Columbian world have given splendor to the pres∣ent day.</P>
<P>Hortensius was bred to business, and his probity through all the complicated scenes in which he hath been engaged hath remained unimpeached. Frugali∣ty and industry are considerable traits in his charac∣ter; his efforts are crowned with success, and he is in possession of affluence. A severe disappointment in early life, relative to the maiden of his election, steel∣ed his heart against every subsequent approach of the tender passion, and ambitious of the title, <HI>Citizen of the World,</HI> he devoted himself to a series of beneficent ac∣tions, consulting in every movement the felicity of the family of man.</P>
<P>Hortensius was exemplary as a son, and it was one of his principal enjoyments, "<HI>to rock the cradle of declining
<PB N="309" REF="034162_0308_0FFC68DD2B6DC470"/>
age;</HI>" his parents continued in life to extreme old age, and after gently sloping for them their passage out of time, he laid them decently in the earth, bedewing their exit with a manly and a filial tear. In the me∣tropolis, where he was ushered into being, he hath sustained through succeeding years, and with unblem∣ished reputation, the office of an upright and impor∣tant magistrate, and he is beloved and respected as universally as he is known. Hortensius is learned, re∣ligious and cheerful, and his liberality is only circum∣scribed by his abilities. But if you would give the finishing touches to the character of Hortensius, you must borrow the pen of his sister.</P>
<P>This amiable woman, although accustomed to his benignity, can hardly mention him, especially if you advert to his benevolence, without tears. To the nu∣merous family, of which he is the head, he at once discharges the duties of a parent, and a brother; but, by her, he is considered as meriting epithets more ten∣der, more respectful, and more expressive than language hath yet fashioned; and her tongue untired, delights to expatiate upon his many virtues. She was in the bloom of life widowed of her dearest hopes, and the hour which marked the exit of him, with whom she had exchanged her youthful vows, who had been the deliberate choice both of affection and of judgment, and to whom she was devoted by every motive which can endear a bosom friend, that fatal hour yielded her a monument of woe! while the virtues of her lost companion, seemed amply to justify those demonstra∣tions of heart-felt anguish, which, notwithstanding the length of years that have since elapsed, she still occa∣sionally indulges. A number of infant sons and daughters, incapable of estimating the amount of their deprivation, while they augmented her grief, armed her with resolution to attempt encountering the ills of life. Yet, destitute of property, (for a train of pe∣cuniary misfortunes had preceded the demise of the father of her children) unaccustomed to any ardu∣ous effort, and rendered imbecile by sorrow, the prob∣ability
<PB N="310" REF="034162_0309_0FFC68D73A17E708"/>
is, she must have sunk under the pressure of calamity.</P>
<P>But Hortensius saw, he pitied, and he flew to res∣cue. A commodious and elegant habitation was pre∣pared; his sister and her little family were put into immediate possession thereof; and, taking apartments for himself under the same roof, he became her solace, her companion, and her protector; and he was, at once, the guardian, the support, and the preceptor of her children. Their education has been the most lib∣eral which our country can afford; her eldest son is now a barrister of distinguished eminence; her daugh∣ters are apportioned and married into the genteelest families, and they are considered as ornaments of their sex; while the glad emotions of their grateful hearts unreservedly hail the good Hortensius as their father and their friend; and they equitably acknowledge higher obligations to him, than they could have owed to the author of their beings, whose indispensable duty it would have been, to have reared and cherished them.</P>
<P>A view of Hortensius, placed in the midst of the charming group, is gratifying to the best feelings of the heart; he experiences the rapture of a parent, while the children of his affectionate bounty, attached by affinity, gratitude, love, and veneration, behold him as a guardian seraph, clothed in the habiliments of humanity, by that watchful Providence, who de∣signed him their benefactor, their guide, and their truly munificent resource! Doubtless, the first of blessings will be found in his train. Nay, he is already in pos∣session of that "<HI>sweet peace of mind, which goodness bo∣soms ever.</HI>"</P>

<P>NO—Atheism will never do. The prime procurer and minister of the French arrangements, at length accedes to this axiom; and Gallia, having guil∣lotined her sovereign, and blasphemously sought to dethrone and annihilate the Monarch of Heaven, be∣comes, in her present resolutions, solicitous to re-estab∣lish the Deity in her systems, to invest the Supreme with those divine honours, which the language of na∣ture hasteth to bestow, which the dictates of reason in∣variably award.</P>
<P>Opposed, from principle, to those sanguinary decrees, which, pronouncing the death-warrant of whole heca∣tombs of my species, fail not to let loose the dogs of war, I will confess, that I have not felt for the name of Robespierre any of those cordialities which consti∣tute the aggregate of amity. The anarchy and con∣sequent enormities, prevalent in France, together with those licentious principles, which have apparently been so generally embraced, I have considered as replete with incalculable evils, as the baleful precursors of ev∣ery ill which can afflict humanity! Such my senti∣ments, I expected not from the report of Robespierre, those strong and glowing sensations, which, whenever I attend to the voice of truth, most delightfully expand my soul—But I have read—and, charmed with the prevalent contour of the composition, the energy and beauty of the diction, and the demonstrative propriety
<PB N="312" REF="034162_0311_0FFC68D4279C0B90"/>
and sublimity of the observations—while I do homage to the translator, I cannot but join my suffrage to those applauses, by which America has marked the <HI>new-born</HI> piety of the French politician.</P>
<P>It is true that, as being a member of the protestant community, I am necessitated, by my creed, to re∣nounce all supplications made to saints, whatever eclat may have attended their canonization. I may not feel at liberty to cry out, "Oh! <HI>Sancta Robespierre, ora pro nobis;</HI>" yet if he, <HI>in reality,</HI> shall at length pursue the <HI>mild dictates</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>reason,</HI> every senti∣ment of my soul will combine to wish him God speed. An admirer of the report in the gross, I yet conceive that the following extracts can hardly be too often repeated, can scarcely be too strongly inculcated, or too deeply engraven upon the tablets of reflection. "What was the wish of those, who, in the bosom of the conspiracies with which we were surrounded, in the midst of the embarrassments of such a war, at the moment while the torch of civil discord was still smok∣ing, suddenly attacked all kinds of worship by violence, to establish themselves as the furious apostles of anni∣hilation, and as the fanatic missionaries of atheism? Attend only to the happiness of your country and the interests of humanity; <HI>cherish all opinions and institu∣tions which console and elevate the mind;</HI> reject those which tend to degrade and corrupt them; <HI>revive</HI> and exalt all those generous sentiments and those great moral ideas which they have wished to extinguish; <HI>reconcile by the charms of friendship, and the bonds of virtue, those citizens whom they have wished to divide. Who has given thee the mission of announcing to the peo∣ple, that the Deity does not exist?</HI> To you who are at∣tached to this barren doctrine, and who are not ani∣mated in the cause of your country, <HI>what advantage do you derive</HI> from <HI>persuading man that a blind force presides in his destiny, and strikes by chance his virtues or his vices; and that his soul is only a transient breath which is extin∣guished at the tomb? Will the idea of his annihilation inspire him with more pure or more elevated sentiments than that
<PB N="313" REF="034162_0312_0FFC68D0624A6588"/>
of his immortality?</HI> Will it inspire him with more re∣spect for his fellow men, or for himself; more attach∣ment to his country; more firmness in braving tyran∣ny; more <HI>contempt for death</HI> or pleasure? <HI>You who re∣gret a virtuous friend, do you not delight to reflect that the most valuable part of him has escaped decease?</HI> You who weep over the corpse of a son or a wife, <HI>are you consol∣ed by him who tells you that nothing more of them remains than a vile heap of dust?</HI> Unfortunate men, who expire under the stroke of an assassin! your last sigh is an appeal to eternal justice! Innocence, on the scaffold, makes the tyrant turn pale in his triumphal car: Would it have this ascendency if the tomb put upon a level the oppressor and the oppressed? Miserable sophist! from whence do you derive this right of rending from in∣nocence the sceptre of reason, and of placing it again in the hands of vice; <HI>to throw a melancholy veil over na∣ture, to drive misfortune to despair;</HI> to encourage vice, to afflict virtue, to degrade humanity? <HI>The more a man is endowed with sensibility and genius, the more is he at∣tached to those ideas which aggrandize his being, and which elevate his mind; and the doctrine of men of this character should become that of the universe.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Ah! how can those ideas differ from truth? At least I cannot conceive how nature could have sug∣gested to man any <HI>fictions</HI> more useful than these <HI>real∣ities;</HI> and if the existence of a God, if the immortality of the soul, were only dreams, they would still remain the most splendid of all the conceptions of the human mind.</P>
<P>The idea of the Supreme Being, and the immortal∣ity of the soul, is a continual invitation to justice: It is then social and republican. He who can replace the Deity in the system of social life, is, in my opinion, a prodigy of genius; and he, who without having re∣placed him, only endeavours to banish him from the mind of man, appears to me a prodigy of stupidity or perversity. If the principles I have hitherto develop∣ed are errors, I am deceived in what the world unite to revere. Observe with what art Cesar, pleading in
<PB N="314" REF="034162_0313_0FFC68CE24513DC0"/>
the Roman senate in favour of the accomplices of Cataline, lost himself in digression against the doctrine of the immortality of the soul; so well calculated did these ideas appear to him, to distinguish in the hearts of the judges the energy of virtue; so closely did the cause of vice appear to him, connected with that of Atheism. Cicero, on the contrary invoked against the traitors both the sword of the law and the thunder of the gods. Socrates, when dying, conversed with his friends on the immortality of the soul. Leonidas, at Thermopyles, supping with his companions in arms, at the moment of executing the most heroic design that human virtue ever conceived, invited them for the next day to another banquet in a new life.</P>
<P>A great man, a real hero, esteems himself too much to be pleased with the idea of his annihilation. A vil∣lain, contemptible in his own eyes, and horrible in those of other men, perceives that nature cannot afford him a more splendid boon than that of his annihilation. Religion collects mankind together, and by collecting them together you will render them better; for when men are thus assembled, they endeavour to please each other, which can only be effected by those things that render them estimable. Give to their reunion a great moral and political motive, and the love of virtuous things will, with pleasure, enter their hearts; for man∣kind do not see each other without pleasure.</P></Q>
<P>I had but recently perused the whole of this very excellent moral report, when one of the best informed, and most sentimental of my friends, put into my hands a piece selected from the London Morning Chronicle of November 29, 1793.</P>
<P>To the matured judgment of this friend I am in the habit of paying high deference; and he conceived, that whether we regarded the little narration as a fact, or an ingenious reproof of the conduct of the predomi∣nant party in France, it contained a sufficient quantum of good sense to merit preservation. It is a proper supplement for the celebrated report of Robespierre, and in my office of caterer for my readers, perhaps I

could not do better than to offer it to their acceptance. I subjoin it, therefore, with an added with, that it may contribute as largely to their pleasures, as it did to the satisfaction of the Gleaner.</P>
<P>"A few days after the bishop of Paris and his vi∣cars had set the example of renouncing their clerical character, a curi from a village on the banks of the Rhone, followed by some of his parishioners, with an offering of gold, silver, saints' chalices, rich vestments, &amp;c. presented himself at the bar of the house. The sight of the gold put the Convention in very good hu∣mour, and the curi, a thin venerable looking man, with grey hair, was ordered to speak. I came, said he, from the village of—, where the only good building standing (for the chatteau has been pulled down) is a very fine church; my parishioners beg you will take it to make a hospital for the sick and wound∣ed of both parties, they being equally our countrymen; the gold and silver, part of which we have brought you, they entreat you will devote to the service of the State; and that you will cast the bells into cannon, to drive away its foreign invaders. For myself I am come with great pleasure to resign my letters of ordination, of induction, and every deed of title, by which I have been constituted a member of your ecclesiastical polity. I am still able to support myself with the labour of my hands, and I beg you to believe that I never felt sin∣cerer joy than I now do in making this renunciation—I have longed to see this day; I see it, and am glad."</P>
<Q><P>When the old man had done speaking, the ap∣plauses were immoderate. You are an honest man, said they all at once; a brave fellow, you do not be∣lieve in God; and the President advanced to give him the fraternal embrace. The curi did not seem greatly elated with these tokens of approbation; he retired back a few steps, and thus resumed his discourse:</P>
<P>Before you applaud my sentiments, it is fit you un∣derstand them; perhaps they may not entirely coincide with your own. I rejoice in this day, not because I wish to see religion degraded, but because I wish to see
<PB N="316" REF="034162_0315_0FFC68C9F6D75E20"/>
it exalted and purified. By dissolving its alliance with the State, you give it dignity and independence; you have done it a piece of service which its well-wishers would never have had courage to render it, but which is the only thing wanted to make it appear in its gen∣uine lustre and beauty. Nobody will now say of me, when I am performing the offices of my religion—It is his trade—he is paid for telling the people such and such things—he is hired to keep up a useful piece of mummery. They cannot now say this; and therefore I feel myself raised in my own esteem, and shall speak to them with a confidence and frankness, which before this I never durst venture to assume.</P>
<P>We resign, without reluctance, our gold and silver images and embroidered vestments, because that we have never sound, that looking upon gold or silver made the heart more pure, or the affections more heavenly: We can also spare our churches; for the heart that wishes to lift itself up to God, will never be at a loss for room to do it in;—but we cannot spare our religion, because, to tell you the truth, we never had so much occasion for it. I understand that you accuse us priests of having told the people a great many falsehoods. I suppose this may have been the case; but till this day we have never been allowed to inquire, whether the things which we taught them were true or not. You required us formerly to receive them all without proof, and you now would have us reject them all without discrimination. Neither of these modes of conduct become philosophers, such as you would be thought to be. I am going to employ myself diligently, along with my parishioners, to sift the wheat from the bran, the true from the false: If we are not successful, we shall be at least sincere.</P>
<P>I do fear, indeed, that while I wore those vestments which we have brought you, and spoke in the large gloomy building which we have given up to you, I told my poor flock many idle stories. I cannot but hope, however, that the errors we have fallen into have not been very material, since the village has in

general been sober and good; the peasants are honest, docile, and laborious; the husbands love their wives, and the wives their husbands; they are fortunately not too rich to be compassionate, and they have con∣stantly relieved the sick and fugitives of all parties, whenever it has lain in their way. I think, therefore, what I have taught them cannot be so very much amiss. You want to extirpate priests; but will you hinder the ignorant from applying for instruction, the unhappy for comfort and hope, the unlearned from looking up to the learned? If you do not, you will have priests, by whatever name you will order them to be called; but it is certainly not necessary they should wear a particular dress, or be appointed by state letters of ordination. My letters of ordina∣tion are, my zeal, my charity, my ardent love for my dear children of the village—if I were more learned, I should add my knowledge; but, alas! we all know very little; to man every error is pardonable, but want of humility.</P>
<P>We have a public walk, with a spreading elm tree at one end of it, and a circle of green round it, with a convenient bench. Here I shall draw together the children as they are playing round me. I shall point to the vines laden with fruit, to the orchard, to the herds of cattle lowing round us, to the distant hills stretching one behind another, and they will ask me how these things came? I shall tell them all I know or have heard from wise men who have lived before me; they will be penetrated with love and veneration; they will kneel, I shall kneel with them; they will not be at my feet, but all of us at the feet of that good Being, whom we shall worship together; and thus they will receive within their tender minds, <HI>a religion.</HI> The old men will come sometimes from having depos∣ited under the green sod one of their companions, and place themselves by my side; they will look wishfully at the turf, and anxiously inquire—<HI>Is he gone forever? Shall we be soon like him? Will no morning break over the tomb?</HI> When the <HI>wicked cease from troubling, will the
<PB N="318" REF="034162_0317_0FFC68C407F571F0"/>
good cease from doing good?</HI> We will talk of these things; I will comfort them; I will tell them of the goodness of God; I will speak to them of a life to come; I will bid them hope for a state of retribution.</P>
<P>In a clear night, when the stars slide over our head, they will ask what those bright bodies are, and by what rules they rise and set? And we will converse about different forms of being, and distant worlds, in the immensity of space, governed by the same laws, till we feel our minds raised from what is grovelling, and refined from what is sordid.</P>
<P>You talk of Nature—this is Nature; and if you could at this moment extinguish religion in the minds of all the world, thus would it be kindled again. You have changed our holy days; you have an undoubted right, as our civil governors, so to do; it is very im∣material whether they are kept once in seven days, or once in ten; some, however, you will leave us, and when they occur, I shall tell those who choose to hear me, of the beauty and utility of virtue, and of the dig∣nity of upright conduct. We shall talk of good men who have lived in the world, and of the doctrines they have taught; and if any of them have been persecuted and put to death for their virtue, we shall reverence their memories the more—I hope in all this there is no harm. There is a book, out of which I have sometimes taught my people: It says, we are to love those who do us hurt, and to pour oil and wine into the wounds of a stranger; it has enabled my children to bear patiently the spoiling of their goods, and to give up their own interest to the general welfare. I think it cannot be a very bad book. I wish more of it had been read in your town; perhaps you would not have had so many assassinations and massacres. In this book we hear of a person called JESUS; some worship him as a God; others, as I am told, say it is wrong to do so;—some teach that he existed before the beginning of ages; others, that he was born of Joseph and Mary. I cannot tell whether these contro∣versies will ever be decided; but in the mean time, I
<PB N="319" REF="034162_0318_0FFC68C27A328388"/>
think we cannot do otherwise than well in imitating him; for I learn that he <HI>loved the poor, and went about doing good.</HI></P>
<P>Fellow citizens, as I travelled hither from my own village, I saw peasants setting amongst the smoak∣ing ruins of their cottages; rich men and women re∣duced to deplorable poverty; fathers lamenting their children in the bloom and pride of youth; and I said to myself—<HI>these people cannot afford to part with their religion.</HI> But indeed you cannot take it away; if, con∣trary to your first declaration, you choose to try the experiment of persecuting it, you will only make us prize it the more, and love it the better. Religion, <HI>true</HI> or <HI>false,</HI> is so necessary to the mind of man, that you have already begun to make yourselves a new one. You are sowing the seeds of superstition at the moment you fancy you are destroying superstition; and in two or three generations your posterity will be worshipping some clumsy idol, with the rights perhaps of a bloody Moloch, or a lascivious Thamusar. It was not worth while to have been philosophers, and destroyed the images of our saints for this; but let every one choose the religion that pleases him: I and my parishioners are content with ours; it teaches us to bear the evils your childish or sanguinary decrees have helped to bring upon the country.</P></Q>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE value of an equal and accommodating dis∣position, cannot, I conceive, be too highly appre∣ciated, too energetically inculcated, or too often ex∣patiated upon. Such, and so frequent are the vicis∣situdes of life, that an unbending mind, refusing to yield to that necessity which is imposed upon its ex∣istence, is broken by the boisterous winds which are abroad, and too frequently prostrated by those calam∣ities, or adverse transitions, to which an acquiescent spirit finds it wisdom, with humble patience, to submit. "The burden becomes light by being well borne." I have not forgot that this is an old adage, but I re∣peat, that its antiquity doth not deduct the smallest par∣ticle from its rationality; these venerable old saws fre∣quently contain the very pith and essence of sentiment, and I have often thought that the pen appropriated to the pointing out their excellence, might be <HI>much worse</HI> employed.</P>
<P>Say, thou discontented and repining mortal, what emol∣ument hast thou derived from continually tracing the dark shades in the picture? Hast thou received injuries, and dost thou find thy recompense in eternally brood∣ing thereon? Do such contemplations meliorate thy vir∣tues, or promote the sunshine of the soul? Are the ge∣nial and salutary airs of tranquillity originated or waft∣ed forward by reflections, which wound the mind, and fire the bosom with indignation?</P>
<P>Health of body, serenity of soul, sweet complacency, sprightly mirth—all these are among the victims of <HI>cherished, gloomy</HI> and <HI>corroding resentment!</HI> The soul of the vindictive is the region of horror, and the most black and baleful passions harbour there. What are
<PB N="321" REF="034162_0320_0FFC68BE55690C70"/>
the pleasures of the angry man? It is undeniably true that he is his own tormentor; and if he throws the reins upon that implacability and inveterate revenge which so fearfully predominate in his breast, his most uniform or confirmed enemy could hardly devise means more adequate or better calculated for the destruction of his felicity. Have not the attentions I have received been commensurate with that merit, with which my self-par∣tiality hath invested me? Have I to complain of cold indifference or neglect from those upon whom nature, circumstances, or amity, had furnished me with indis∣putable claims? Have I not only been defrauded of those dues to which the inviolable laws of society hath entitled me; but hath insult, and even outrage been also added? Well, it is really a pity-moving situation, <HI>and I would certainly turn as often as possible from the view.</HI> Canst thou derive either satisfaction or profit from an enumeration of thy grievances? I pity the malignant spirit, which can delight to prey upon food on which the fiends assembled in Pandemonium might joy to riot. Reader, if thou wert ever angry, then hast thou expe∣rienced the ravages which the war of the passions mak∣eth upon thy peace—like all other wars, desolation follows in the train, and reason can never estimate their profit; yet, if upon a fair calculation, the sum total proves thee a single drachm, or even a half drachm, nay, the hundredth part of a scruple the gainer; I will then consent that thou shalt in future vex thyself to a skeleton more hideous than the brain of fertile poesy ere conjured up, though sickening envy, or yellow jeal∣ousy, or fell revenge, stalked full in view—"Yes," cried Maria, <Q>the sensations which are attendant upon the contemplation of a virtuous action, are undoubt∣edly divine. <HI>I would pass by a thousand supposed injuries,</HI> but I would dwell forever upon the contemplation of genuine worth. <HI>The reflections which are the accom∣paniments of offences do not exercise, they do not invigorate the finer feelings of the soul.</HI> I listened to the pleasing matron,</Q> continued Maria, <Q>I listened with rapture, for her tongue expatiated upon the philanthropy of Alberto.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="034162_0321_0FFC68BB636DDEB8"/>
"My son," said she, <Q>was on a voyage; he was a stranger, and he took rank among the lowest grade which made up the ship's company—my son fell sick; he was dangerously ill; gloomy was his situa∣tion—but Alberto commanded the ship; he sought out my son; he soothed his woes; he lodged him in his own cabin; he attended him in person, and my son was restored to health. Immeasurable are my obligations to Alberto; and his name, next to that of the Supreme, is entitled to my utmost veneration. Alberto is my brother; I am many years his senior; I have known him the most beauteous of infants, and he gladdened the hearts of his parents. How sweet are the praises of a brother! Alberto, dear Alberto, for this, and many similar anecdotes of thy short life, I will remit unto thee all, and every one of the peccadillos, which, shading thy character, do but serve to render thy virtues the more conspicuous. Yes, the genuine benignity of thy soul shall serve as a sponge wherewith to obliterate all recollection of those asperities, that the rough contour of thy in∣born integrity so frequently presents.</Q></P>
<P>The election of Maria exemplified her accustomed penetration; for reiterated observation of proper and becoming actions, has upon the heart the most saluta∣ry effect. Was I called upon to delineate the path which would most assuredly lead to as great a share of happiness as is compatible with humanity, I should dictate to the candidate for felicity, a frequent recur∣rence to the fair side of persons, circumstances and events; almost every thing may be viewed in different mediums, and even the various emphasizing of any given narration, may furnish the same fact with fea∣tures directly opposite. Resolve then to view every occurrence in the very best possible light; and if there is a pleasing construction, seize with avidity the suppo∣sition which points to complacency. Make, I beseech thee, the experiment; determine to be pleased for one week, and then tell me how smoothly fled the hours. Here I am aware of an objection; misfortunes may
<PB N="323" REF="034162_0322_0FFC68B926667D78"/>
await, the pressure of which may cloud even fortitude itself. This is certainly true, and yet it should be re∣membered that habitual equanimity can blunt the edge even of the real calamities of life, and that every evil is undoubtedly mitigated by patience.</P>
<P>Resolution can do much, the embodied faculties of the mind, disciplined by virtue, are equal to almost any situation; and they effectually arrest the progress of that fretful <HI>ennui</HI> which is commonly the offspring of indolence, and strongly marks the want of those efforts that are so proper to a rational being.</P>
<P>Murmuring, repining, captious discontent, invidious cavilling, these are fiends armed at all points against our repose; disagreeable recollections, wounding sar∣casms, irritating recriminations—these are hunted after, as if they were some hidden treasure, and they stab our choicest comforts; they are the dark assassins, who, aiming at the vitals of tranquillity, fatally destroy our peace. Of what consequence is it who was the aggres∣sor? humanity is subjected to error, and that immac∣culate Being, to whom alone belongeth undeviating rectitude, hath given us a dignified example of forgive∣ness. Take the advice of a friend; make the most of life; enjoy with avidity; reverence virtue, make it the goal of thy wishes; pursue and overtake, cultivate phi∣lanthrophy; give ample scope to every benign sugges∣tion; take not upon thyself the character of a <HI>public accuser, or censor;</HI> but, leaving this invidious office to those to whom it may <HI>legally belong,</HI> accustom thyself to expatiate upon the <HI>good qualities</HI> of thy associates, upon the <HI>benefits</HI> accruing from an intercourse with thy con∣nexions, and upon the <HI>eligibles of life:</HI> Tread lightly upon offences; if thou shouldest awake the sleeping mischief, it will sting thee to the soul; its envenomed shafts will find their way to the deepest recesses of thy spirit. Do not magnify or even investigate the ill of∣fices which have been done thee; few circumstances can justify the perturbating scrutiny; anger will grow in thy bosom. How shocking, how deforming is an∣ger! Seneca's description of anger is not too high
<PB N="324" REF="034162_0323_0FFC68B76F6C59B0"/>
coloured; and it is just as true at the present day, as it was near eighteen hundred years since. Seneca, upon anger, may not be in your library; I take leave, there∣fore, to transcribe an extract from his admired page.</P>
<P>"He was much in the right, whoever he was, that first called anger a short madness; for they have both of them the same symptoms; and there is so wonder∣ful a resemblance between the transports of choler and those of frenzy, that it is a hard matter to know the one from the other. A bold, fierce and threatening countenance, as pale as ashes, and in the same moment as red as blood; a glaring eye, a wrinkled brow, violent motions, the hands restless and perpetually in action, wringing and menacing, snapping of the joints, stamp∣ing with the feet, the hair starting, trembling lips, a for∣ced voice; the speech false and broken, deep and frequent sighs, and ghastly looks; the veins swell, the heart pants, the knees knock; with a hundred dismal accidents that are common to both distempers. Neither is anger, only a bare resemblance of madness, but many times an irrecoverable transition into the thing itself. How many persons have we known, read, and heard of, that have lost their wits in a passion, and never came to themselves again? It is therefore to be avoided not only for moderation sake, but also for health. Now, if the outward appearance of anger be hideous, how deformed must that mind be that is harassed with it? for it leaves no place either for counsel or friendship, honesty or good manners; no place either for the ex∣ercise of reason, or for the offices of life. If I were to describe it, I would draw a tyger bathed in blood; sharp set, and ready to take a leap at its prey; or dress it up as the poets represent the furies, with whips snakes and flames. It should likewise be sour, livid, full of scars, and wallowing in gore, raging up and down, destroy∣ing, grinning, bellowing, and pursuing; sick of all other things, and most of all of itself. It turns beauty into deformity, and the calmest counsels into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: It disorders our very garments, and fills the mind with horror. How abominable then is it in the soul!
<PB N="325" REF="034162_0324_0FFC68B386B34948"/>
Is not he a mad man who hath lost the government of himself, and is tossed hither and thither by his fury, as by a tempest; the executioner of his own revenge, both with his heart and hand; and the murderer of his nearest friends? The smallest matter moves it and makes us unsociable and inaccessible. It does all things by violence, as well upon itself as others; and it is, in short, the master of all passions."</P>
<P>Say, my fair friend, doth the portrait disgust thee? Fly then, lovely sentimentalist, from the very first ap∣proaches of the fell destroyer; rude and mishapen, it assimilates into its own frightfully shocking aspect the finest features; and, beneath its horrid and imperious sway, prostrate beauty fades, and is extinct; its dep∣redations on the sweet tranquillity, proper to thy sex, are marked with the most aggravating and unnatural circumstances:—Gentle woman should studiously shun that questionable path which may remotely terminate in the most distant approximation to the hell-born fiend; for every mild, every bland and social virtue, should constitute the aggregate of the female charac∣ter. How charming is the sunshine of the soul! how friendly to the growth of mental life is the milk of hu∣man kindness! how divine is the precept—"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the royal law of love."</P>
<P>But stop—let me not presumptuously invade the province of the preacher. The fact is, thought hath followed thought, until, having overshot my purpose, I have widely deviated from my original plan: In∣deed, the want of regularity is not the least of the in∣conveniences which are the accompaniments of the vagrant tribe—but my humble pretensions must, at all times, be my apology.</P>
<P>My design was, to have devoted this Gleaner to the consideration of the utility of supporting with equa∣nimity, the unavoidable misfortunes incident to life: And I was furnished with an exemplification of the advantages I had in view to delineate, during a tour I lately made through the out-skirts of one of the east∣ern States: Thus the eccentricity of my occupation too often deranges my most favourite views, and I am
<PB N="326" REF="034162_0325_0FFC68B07401D7C0"/>
necessitated to admit the multifarious produce of an excursive or fugitive imagination; yet, although thrown from my course, I will not be prevented from presenting my example; I think it cannot fail of strik∣ing agreeably, and it may possibly give birth to those very identical reflections it was my wish to embody.</P>
<P>It was on a beautiful morning of April last that, seeking the pleasures of solitude, I wandered from the company at our little inn, and, mounting my horse, I threw the reins upon his neck, determining to leave to chance the direction of my ramble. We were equally strangers to the road, and a few miles in a country hardly emerging from a state of nature, conducted us to a thick wood, when, securing my horse to the trunk of a tall tree, I prepared to penetrate a coppice which presented the only vestige of the wants or ingenuity of man, which the eye could trace; and, proceeding onward to the extremity of the wood, which bordered a few acres of ground, equally remarkable for the sterility of its soil, and the strong indications it bore of the persevering patience and uncommon industry of its proprietors, I was roused from my reverie by a number of voices that, arresting my attention, imme∣diately drew me forward to the place from whence they proceeded. I suspected the employment of our rustics, and, lest I should interrupt operations so prop∣er to the season, I made my advances with care. The opening scene presented a poor built cottage, which, in language unequivocal, proclaimed industrious pov∣erty; the heathy appearance of the grounds evinced the stinted produce, with which they repaid the mas∣ter's culture; a few sheep and a single cow, whose thin forms demonstrated the scanty pittance on which they fed, stood forth additional vouchers of the penu∣rious soil. But a fertilizing stream, which murmured by, and bore in its bosom various descriptions of the finny tribe, diversified the view, and gave birth to the pleasures of hope.</P>
<P>A well looking man was busily employed in turn∣ing up and shaping the glebe; a sentimental carol vibrated upon his tongue, and his features were ex∣pressive
<PB N="327" REF="034162_0326_0FFC68AEEBB65E60"/>
of content. A graceful female at a little dis∣tance, round whom no less than eleven children, of different ages, were collected—was directing the eld∣est boy, a rosy-cheeked youth, in setting some plants, while she herself committed to the prepared earth, those seeds from which she cheerfully anticipated the distant harvest. The vestments of the family were the vest∣ments of penury; and if they could be considered as garments, they were entitled, for so respectable an ap∣pellation, to the unwearied diligence, which, still fol∣lowing the well worn robe, had so repeatedly repaired each time made breach, as to render it impossible to decide, of what hue or texture it was originally possess∣ed: Yet the voice of gladness echoed round, and the hi∣larity of the heart seemed impressed upon every feature.</P>
<P>I contemplated, with folded arms and grateful ad∣miration, the uncommon group. The face of the matron was not immediately turned toward me, nei∣ther had the shepherd observed me; but the children had begun to amuse themselves with my figure, when their mother, having finished her employ, was drawn by their innocent mirth to the spot on which I was fixed. I have already confessed mingling surprise and pleasure at the gay tranquillity, which was apparently the appendages of a scene so barren of good, and so remarkably devoid of the eligibles of life; but no language can express my astonishment, when, in the countenance of the penuriously garbed matron, I re∣cognized the once opulent, truly amiable, and highly deserving Flavilla!</P>
<P>Gracious God!—spontaneously I exclaimed—Is it possible? do I in reality behold the long idolized, and ever charming Miss Kneller? Flavilla, accustomed to the vicissitudes and caprices of events, uttered no per∣turbed exclamation; but, with that genuine dignity, which nature delights to confer upon a consciousness of innate worth, with a grace and manner which I have not often seen equalled in a drawing-room, pre∣senting her hand, she expressed her satisfaction in an interview so unexpected; and, leading me to her hum∣ble abode, we were soon joined by Honorius and the
<PB N="328" REF="034162_0327_0FFC68AD5B3272B8"/>
little family. I had known Flavilla from early youth: She was born to affluence, and her education had been in the first line. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kneller, had no other child; and this daughter, promising in every view, was, of course, regarded as an inestimable treasure. Honorius was the man of her heart, and her union with the youth she loved, and who recipro∣cated her attachment, received the cheerful sanction of the authors of her being.</P>
<P>Soon after the marriage of Miss Kneller, her pa∣rental friends paid the great debt of nature, leaving Honorius and Flavilla in possession of an ample for∣tune. But, from this period, thick clouds began to gather, and they experienced a most distressing reverse of circumstances. The <HI>career</HI> of their misfortunes was ushered in by a dreadful conflagration, in which their mansion-house, containing many valuable articles, was reduced to ashes; a series of calamities succeeded, un∣til, at length, of all their vast possessions, scarce a ves∣tige remained; yet a principle of rectitude triumphed in their souls; of their inborn integrity, the malice of their fate could not divest them; and discharging, with interest, the last farthing for which they were in∣debted, with the poor pittance which was left, they retired, like Thompson's Lavinia—"<HI>far from those scenes that knew their better days,</HI>" and purchased in this remote spot—<HI>'twas all they could</HI>—the barren grounds from which they have ever since obtained a scanty and hard earned subsistence. Their original stock consist∣ed of thirty sheep, one cow, and a yoke of oxen; the sheep were almost immediately destroyed by the wolves; the cow fell a victim, probably, to the steril soil to which she was confined; and, in an attempt to level a tall tree, one of their oxen was killed upon the spot. Succeeding years has reduced to the lowest state the necessaries which made up their personal and family wardrobe, and it has not been in their power to possess themselves of the smallest supplies! Yet, strange to tell, neither time nor sorrow hath been able to infix their deadly fangs in the bosom of Flavilla; health dances in her veins, and beauty glows upon her cheek; her
<PB N="329" REF="034162_0328_0FFC68AA580C72C8"/>
smiles still display the dimples of youth; and in her mildly expressive eye, corrected vivacity yet beams. It was impossible I could forbear expressing my aston∣ishment and my admiration! and when I inquired by what means they had, Flavilla especially, supported such an uncommon measure of tranquillity, in the midst of such a calamitous reverse of circumstances, Flavilla replied—</P>
<P>"It is simply this, we have considered the <HI>brevity</HI> of life, and the certainty of our removal to another, a better, and a more permanent state of being; we have adopted, realized, and reduced to practice, the sentiment of an admired poet; we have been taught by experi∣ence, that "<HI>earth-born cares are vain;</HI> that <HI>man wants but little here below,</HI>" we have fully known; and we do not expect to want "<HI>that little long.</HI>"</P>
<P>To contribute to the relief of Flavilla, or her family, is impossible; for since the discovery of her retirement, in regard to which she hath enjoined the strictest secresy, however ingenious I have been in my attempts to aug∣ment their finances, I have still found myself, and with a firmness almost unexampled, uniformly repulsed. To have put Flavilla in possession of every thing which her situation seemed to claim, would have been the highest luxury which benevolence could have tasted; but while I regret, as an individual, her steady rejec∣tion of all pecuniary assistance, I cannot but admire the genuine elevation of her high-souled sentiments. She listened, it is true, to those remonstrances with which, after more indirect methods had failed, I ven∣tured to address her; but she listened only to ascertain her rejection.</P>
<P>"No, Sir," with all the calmness of inborn superi∣ority, she replied, "I am but too much obliged in re∣ceiving your munificent proposals, but no one shall say that he hath <HI>enriched either Flavilla, or her family.</HI> Flavilla, and her family, will depend only upon <HI>Na∣ture, and Nature's God; habit hath reconciled us to our situation; we are resigned, we are contented</HI>—besides, my friend, the prospect now gradually brightens upon us; by rigid economy, we have replaced our <HI>stock;</HI> our
<PB N="330" REF="034162_0329_0FFC68A8252EE3F0"/>
children are growing up; my boys will assist their father; we have already laid the foundation of a little tenement, in which we expect to meet a tranquil close to waning life. Labour will ameliorate even the steril earth; many hands will bear from some more friendly spot the rich manure; the increase of our own fields shall yet spread us a plenteous board. See yonder flax, already it assumes a promising and healthy aspect. The finest threads are spun by my girls, and even by myself. Lydia is mistress of the weaving business; William has a fine mechanical genius, his looms are nearly com∣plete, and the well made web, the product of our own industry, will ere long furnish us with decent and be∣coming vestments."</P>
<P>Happy, deservedly happy woman! felicity, more than wealth can give, is thy well earned portion.</P>
<P>Felicity hasteth from the discordant spirit of the cap∣tious murmurer, although the child of affluence, and enveloped in gold and purple; it hasteth to the bosom of contentment; it seeketh shelter in the breast of equa∣nimity, bestowing on its votaries, although dwelling in a humble cottage, the choicest of its blessings.</P>

<P>DISGUISES are frequently the convenient asy∣lums of villany; and as they are always ques∣tionable, they are with propriety always suspected. To trace the labyrinth of folly, into which the flagitious delinquent is precipitated, requires more than human penetration. Many are the windings and doublings of the proficient in error; all his paths are intricate; he is fruitful in subterfuges, and he is enveloped in mys∣tery. I do not say that virtue hath never worn a veil, or that integrity may not suppose it necessary to hold up false lights; but I contend that the <HI>practice</HI> of <HI>deception,</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="034162_0330_0FFC68A5F4B08680"/>
being an expedient that must be acknowledged <HI>extremely hazardous,</HI> ought never to be resorted to but in the <HI>last extremity;</HI> and I am free to own, I have found a singular pleasure in indulging a hope, that truth and innocence will generally bear their own weight.</P>
<P>The smooth surface of the limpid stream out-spreads its azure flow to the most curious investigation; the orient luminary of day emits a flood of light; it issues forth a transcendent body, elevated in itself, while its splendours are confessed by every eye; and the upright ancient wished for a glass in his breast, that the <HI>possibility</HI> of concealment might be thus erased from the cata∣logue of his abilities. Ambiguity casts a veil over the most irreproachable life; it originates the <HI>invidious ar∣dours of speculation;</HI> and it gives to the features of vir∣tue the contour of folly. I confess I am charmed by frankness of soul; ingenuity and integrity of manners, carry with them their title to my unreserved esteem, and upon the honest sincere man, reason, unbiassed by fashion or habit, is ever ready to pronounce a eulogy. I abhor duplicity in every form; doubtful meanings, <HI>double entendres,</HI> playing upon words, with every baga∣telle of this description, are, in my opinion, at least in∣elegant and unbecoming; nor can I allow that they make any part of <HI>manly sense, true wit,</HI> or <HI>genuine hu∣mour.</HI> In a fair, open, consistent manner of thinking, conversing and acting, there is both dignity and pro∣priety; and an elevated reputation is the well earned reward of persevering and unequivocal worth. We list∣en, with unrestrained pleasure, to the man of unim∣peached honour; to him, whose upright soul hath never been entangled in the wiles of deceit, who hath never debased himself by an alliance with falsehood, nor sported with the credulity of his associates; who, worshipping at the shrine of truth, hath still held her inviolate, regarding all her instigations as sacred, and disdaining to purchase the <HI>smile</HI> of <HI>levity at the expense of that j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st which borrows its humour from a breach of ve∣racity;</HI> and it is then that we confer upon him the most honorary distinction, when, with unlimited confi∣dence, we repose upon his word the most unhesitating faith.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="034162_0331_0FFC68A43841A450"/>
It is dangerous to amuse ourselves with the <HI>semblance</HI> of <HI>vice; the habit</HI> of uttering <HI>merry falsehoods,</HI> will soon blunt the fine edge of our feelings, and we shall easily slide into the most <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>capital violations of truth.</HI> Integrity dignifies a character; frankness is truly ami∣able, and if the offence is not highly enormous, soften∣ed by the ingenuity of a candid acknowledgment, we are ready to press the offender to our bosoms; we al∣low him a second lease of our esteem, and it depends altogether on himself, whether we shall ever again serve upon him a writ of ejection. A moment of con∣cealment is a moment of humiliation; and although circumstances may sometimes render it necessary, yet, it is certain, that when the <HI>paths of innocence are encom∣passed by ambiguity,</HI> the lustre of her crown is dimmed; her blooming honours <HI>seem</HI> to <HI>wane,</HI> and we hesitate, while uttering those applauses which should be reserv∣ed to enwreath the brow of <HI>unequivocal merit.</HI> Myste∣rious arrangements excite suspicion; conjecture is a∣float; jealousy is roused; the aerial mischief feeds up∣on the thinnest diet, and peace evaporates in its grasp. Monimia is perturbed and agitated; not an hour in the day but a variety of tormenting ideas succeed each other in her mind; and the most vexatious inquietude, is the despot of her dreams. Monimia once boasted of her felicity, and her present sufferings are the offspring of conjecture; delicacy forbids her to question, and yet her tranquillity will never be restored, until she learns to what fair hand her loved Eugenio was indebt∣ed for the <HI>expressive device</HI> so elegantly enwreathed, and so curiously cut, which hath recently come into his pos∣session, and which he carefully preserves in the cover of his watch. Clarissa is agitated and unhappy; she accidentally discovered in the escrutoir of Horatio, a lock of hair; it was beautifully glossy; she is positive that it never made a part of her own auburn tresses; it was neatly folded in some lines, sweetly pathetic, and tenderly poetical: Perhaps the rape of that immortal∣ized lock, which Dan Pope has so sweetly sung, al∣though it interested the celestials, was not productive of more <HI>real anguish</HI>—and I persuade myself that eve∣ry
<PB N="333" REF="034162_0332_0FFC68A20915F938"/>
susceptible fair one will drop a tear over the sor∣rows of Clarissa. Cordelia, whose attachment to her nuptial lord is still unbroken, hath passed <HI>months of dis∣satisfaction,</HI> occasioned by her incertitude, relative to the disposal of a pair of sleeve-buttons, which she for∣merly presented to her Henry as a pledge of love.</P>
<P><Q>But these are all unjustifiable sources of inquiet∣ude—they are the imbecilities of the mind, and, originating in the <HI>caprice</HI> of affection, they are of too small moment to merit attention; and they are, be∣sides, too reprehensible to be countenanced.</Q></P>
<P>I grant they are at present <HI>comparatively</HI> small; yet if I am unhappy, I am unhappy, whatever may have pro∣duced the evil; and when the peace of a family, or even of an individual is involved, a full explanation, with ev∣ery attempt to soothe, is as necessary as it is generous; and it should always be remembered, that the unex∣tinguished flame, which, raging with increasing vio∣lence, pursues its desolating career, and issues in the most distressing conflagration, was once a lambent spark, whose genial warmth might easily have been suppressed, and whose agency, under a judicious direc∣tion, might have produced the most beneficial effects.</P>
<P>Yes, the peace of families is too often sacrificed to false delicacy, and to an ill-judged silence on facts and circumstances, which ought to have been scrupu∣lously narrated and critically examined. Inviolable secresy, preserved for any considerable length of time, supposing the event we are solicitous to conceal of im∣portance to those with whom we are intimately con∣nected, is hardly within the chapter of possibilities; a word, or even a look, accidentally transpiring, will give the alarm; the truth, however latent, is thus <HI>in part</HI> divulged; curiosity commenceth the pursuit, and a clue is obtained, which may be just sufficient to intro∣duce the interested person into a labyrinth, from which, never being able to extricate himself, he may be despoiled of all that treasured serenity, which he had vainly hoped would serve as a fund, for the sup∣port of a life of rational enjoyment.</P>
<P>A lovely woman at this moment rushes upon my
<PB N="334" REF="034162_0333_0FFC689E6B8933E0"/>
recollection; she is not personally known to me, but although the vast Atlantic rolls its waves between us, yet, with reiterated pleasure, I have frequently traced the lineaments of her fair mind, as I have seen it pour∣trayed in many a well-written page, the product of her inimitable pen. She hath, I am told, a pleasing exterior, and her understanding is elevated much a∣bove the level of mediocrity. Nature, when she be∣stowed upon her uncommon parts, endowed her also with an exquisite tenderness of soul. Her imagina∣tion is lively and fertile, and she has a taste capa∣ble of distinguishing, and highly enjoying the beauties of poetry. Early enlisting in the service of the Muses, she became one of their most successful votaries; and, from the beautiful parterres which ornament the Par∣nassian grounds, she hath skilfully and happily combin∣ed many an elegant fancied bouquet. She was always a nymph of the <HI>sober-suited train,</HI> and to airs the most pensively melodious her lyre was uniformly attuned.</P>
<P>Sweet Eliza! in the enchanting walks of poesy, thy feet have ceased to stray; that confirmed melancholy, which the sunny beams of hope can no longer impress, will no more permit thee to attune the neglected chords; the voice of the chantress is forever mute, and the lovely minstrel hath forgotten to charm. Unhap∣py fair one! the rose of thy tranquillity is blighted, and "<HI>thy violets, alas! have all withered.</HI>"</P>
<P>It is to the ill-judged silence of Eliza, and her ma∣ternal parent, that her misfortunes must be imputed, The story of her life is simple: I owed unreturnable obligations to her father; it was to him I was indebt∣ed for the systematic and rational mode of thinking, which has constituted the most tranquil and refined moments of my existence. He was a man in the lite∣rary line; his writings are copious and energetic; and for strength of argument, perspicuity of diction, and self-evident demonstration, he hath never yet been surpassed; but having attained, in his favourite pursuit, the highest possible excellence; he became nearly absorbed in those contemplations from which originated so large a part of his felicity, and repre∣hensibly
<PB N="335" REF="034162_0334_0FFC689CDD8910D0"/>
inattentive to every consideration which he deemed of less moment. It too often happens that real or original genius, although rich in resources, and dis∣tinguished by the most shining qualifications, is never∣theless found destitute of those very necessary requi∣sites, which can alone bestow a capability of a bene∣ficial intercourse with mankind.</P>
<P>Mr. Mortimor, the father of Eliza, made his nup∣tial choice with so little discretion, as to exchange the marriage vow with a woman, who, at the very mo∣ment she met him at the altar, knew herself to be the wife of another! With this perfidiously abandoned in∣grate, he lived in total ignorance of her criminal con∣nexion; and lavishing upon her every proof of an at∣tachment almost unexampled, until the perjured mis∣creant, having stripped him of every valuable article which he possessed, found means to abscond with the paramour of her choice, at a period when the treach∣erously betrayed Mortimor was engaged in the dis∣charge of some benevolent offices, which his philan∣thropic disposition had imposed upon him as duties.</P>
<P>It was not until after her elopement, that the turpi∣tude of her life was disclosed to him; and yet he could not, even then, although convinced of her atrocity, be persuaded to take measures calculated to bring her to condign punishment! Many years elapsed before the wound he had received admitted a cure; his ten∣derness of soul, and his innate sense of rectitude, still combated his peace, and reason, for a long time, plead in vain. At length, however, the lenient hand of as∣suaging years, aided by the intellectual accomplish∣ments, and prepossessing exterior, of a truly deserving female, effectuated the most salutary change. Hope once more dawned in his bosom; it gleamed like some heavenly visitant athwart the melancholy region of his benighted soul; by degrees it obliterated the gloo∣my ideas which hovered there, and he again asserted the native dignity of his character. To the sweet sooth∣er of his sorrows, his hours of leisure were invariably de∣voted; a sentimental intercourse commenced; it was ameliorated by the strictest amity, and it terminated in an attachment of the tenderest kind.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="034162_0335_0FFC689AAB20C968"/>
Hymen once more light for Mortimor his sacred torch; and had he attended to some legal steps, which should previously have been taken, the auspices under which he entered into this second engagement, would have been most happy: Yet, those arrangements, which slower souls would have deemed indispensable, must have occasioned delays; the process of the law was tedious; Mortimor had many enemies; obstacles might be interposed; and if upon application he should not be able to obtain the necessary form of divorce, his expectation of happiness would be defeated. What was to be done? Concealment was a ready resource; and, wrapping himself about in the veil of secresy, in his own retired apartment, in the presence of the ho∣ly priest and a few select friends, he plighted his wil∣ling faith. Mrs. Mortimor (still received merely as the friend of her husband) retained her family name; and, although many might suspect, those only who were bound to secresy could decisively pronounce.</P>
<P>At length, however, revolving months ushered into the world the infant Eliza; and impenetrable mystery standing centinel at her birth, she was produced in so∣ciety by the name of Montague; and her parents in∣troduced her as the orphan daughter of deceased rela∣tives. Indeed, having conducted their engagement with so little observance of forms, however <HI>innocent</HI> in
<HI>intention</HI> and in <HI>fact</HI> the parties in reality were, the se∣vere penalty annexed by the laws of England, against that irregularity or breach, a description of which would undeniably involve their connexion, rendered it incum∣bent upon them carefully to avoid an explanation.</P>
<P>Eliza was educated with the most scrupulous atten∣tion; she was nurtured by the hand of elegance, and trained to the observance of every virtue. As early as her opening reason authorized a confidence so im∣portant, under the strongest injunctions of inviolable silence, she was made acquainted with the secret of her birth; and that discretion, armed by filial piety, with which she guarded a communication on which was suspended the life of her father, abundantly justified the reposing a trust of such a nature in so tender a
<PB N="337" REF="034162_0336_0FFC6897B684F090"/>
bosom. Fifteen happy years were passed by Eliza, amid the soft endearments of parental tenderness; each cheerful morn was ushered in by new proofs of provi∣dent care, and the feathery hours were all marked by gentle admonitions, tender cautions, or well-judged ad∣vice; and each returning evening saw her encircled by those arms, and pressed to the faithful bosoms of per∣sons, who sealed upon her balmy lips their wishes for the repose of the night, always concluding their pious benedictions by so natural an avowal of feelings, which were the genuine offspring of a species of tenderness that perhaps cannot be surpassed. How fatal for Eliza was the hour, that just at this period robbed her of a father, who, actuated by a spirit of universal benevo∣lence, and breathing the mildest and most benign ex∣pressions of philanthropy, glowed with uncommon ten∣derness for a daughter, whom, in his most unimpassioned moments, he could not but acknowledge as highly de∣serving, every way amiable, and comprising in herself the sum total of a father's wishes.</P>
<P>The demise of Mr. Mortimor presented a moment, in which it would have been wisdom to have opened on society, with a full and unequivocal eclaircissement. Death had placed the victim the law would have de∣manded, beyond the reach of its penalties; and, clothed in the habiliments of conscious integrity, <HI>they had then nothing to hazard by an explanation.</HI> The priest, who joined the hands of the parents of Eliza, could, at that juncture, have been produced; and the few friends who were present at the marriage, were still in existence.—Alas, alas! they are now consigned to the silent tomb! and, strange to tell, letting slip the golden season of op∣portunity, Mrs. Mortimor was still known by the name of Laughton, while Eliza was addressed by that of Montague!</P>
<P>It is certain that reserves, <HI>except imposed by necessity,</HI> are never justifiable; and the <HI>necessity of mystery,</HI> ceased with the death of Mr. Mortimor. From this period five succeeding years performed their annual round, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the discreet Eliza selected from the circle of those who respectfully presented themselves as candidates for
<PB N="338" REF="034162_0337_0FFC68958CD13060"/>
her election, a youth with whom her gentle heart could unhesitatingly consent to inweave the silken bands of tender, conjugal and indissoluble amity. But her choice once made, she deferred not to banish from the bosom of him she approbated, that perturbed suspense that so fatally corrodes each promised joy; and al∣though her every step was pointed by virgin delicacy, yet did she skilfully enwreath therewith a noble and dignified frankness, which hushed that tumultuous whirlwind of the passions, that hath shipwrecked the peace of many a manly breast. Pity she was not per∣mitted to be uniformly explicit; but the maternal pro∣hibition was strangely and unaccountably interposed, and her nuptials were solemnized under that disguise, which, although justifiable for a time, was most im∣prudently continued, and should never have been worn in the presence of a man, whom, in every other respect, she had honoured by the most unbounded confidence; but she remained perseveringly, reprehensibly silent! and this silence hath been fatal to her peace. The first years of her wedded life were uncommonly serene; she bore to Altamont many fine children; and none but tranquil days seemed written for her. How pre∣carious are terrestrial joys! An untoward accident sud∣denly reversed the scene. A paper, written by herself, and addressed to her mother, breathing the language of ambiguity, deeply fraught with mystery, and yet obscurely hinting at the truth, unfortunately met the eye of Altamont! To the nicest sense of honour Atla∣mont is exquisitely alive—the soul of ingenuity is his, and the delicacy of his sentiments refuseth to tolerate the most distant appearance of deception. He drank in the contagious lines; every word operated as an envenomed draught; and while he shrunk from the fearful contents, they became, in effect, like those subtil poisons, which are said to procure immediate death; for they infixed their deadly fangs in the very vitals of that tranquillity, which he had fondly hoped was be∣yond the malice of fate.</P>
<P>Instantly the fiend, despair, embodied its ministers; they were busy about his heart; complacency was
<PB N="339" REF="034162_0338_0FFC6894086FD9E0"/>
chased from his bosom; the smiles of benevolence are no more; a deep and settled melancholy lowers upon his brow; and the sullen silence which he obstinately observes, effectually bars an eclaircissement. His house, once the seat of social happiness—now, alas! dire suspicion, dark conjecture, and baleful jealousy, hover there; and although months and years have re∣volved, no beam of elucidation hath yet illumined those heartfelt glooms, by which he is enveloped. The tear is upon the cheek of Eliza; and her dream of happi∣ness, of terrestrial happiness, is gone forever.</P>
<P>The deep melancholy which impressed the mind of Altamont, was immediately succeeded by the most alarming estrangement; his temper seems totally ru∣ined. He regards the partner of his sufferings with a mistrustful kind of indignation; she has lost his confi∣dence; she has every reason to believe she no longer possesses his affection; and, the probability is, that was she now to come forward with a full and undisguised explanation, it would produce no salutary effect; her vouchers, as we observed, are numbered with the dead; Altamont is haughty and implacable, and Eliza, hav∣ing once indisputably deceived him, it is to be feared that he will yield her no future credence!!!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To the GLEANER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Liberty Hall, <DATE>December 15th, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>UPON my word, Mr. Gleaner, I believe you are a sly old fellow, after all. Let me tell you, Sir, it ill suits with your <HI>assumed gravity,</HI> to be thus foisting yourself into the secrets of all the young, handsome, married women of your acquaintance. Mighty fine, mighty fine, truly. <HI>Delicacy, forsooth, forbid Monimia to question her husband;</HI> but <HI>delicacy,</HI> it seems, did not think proper to interfere, while she contrived to pour her pity-moving tale into the bosom of <HI>nobody knows who—one who is here, and there, and every where, and very possibly not of much importance any where. A perfect Proteus to the imagination, assuming a thousand fantastical forms, and becoming stationary in no one respectable charac∣ter; a bird of passage, emigrating from state to state, and picking up a scanty pittance, after a whole month's toil, which but ill repays the labour of travelling through the dull pages he is so studious to multiply.</HI> You may think me severe, Mr. Gleaner, but I have the satisfaction of knowing I am <HI>just;</HI> and I add, that you might have gone on with your itinerant gleaning, to the end of the chapter, for me, if you had not roused the feelings of an injured husband, by thus palpably insinuating, that you are a greater favourite with his wife than he is himself! Really, Mr. Morality, you make a very pretty <HI>consistent, heterogeneous</HI> figure; and I should like vastly to have your motley image stuck up in a print-shop, by way of relief to the studies of the chubby-faced school-boy, as he trudges along the academical way to his daily labours.</P>
<P>The wise man says, that laughter doeth good like a medicine; and it is undeniably true, that the ludicrous is a wonderful specific in every intellectual complaint. But let me whisper you, good Mr. Prig, you are a
<PB N="341" REF="034162_0340_0FFC688DF4C7FE50"/>
coxcomb; and you may bless your stars that I am not able to collect the trio, which you have huddled to∣gether in your last Gleaner; for, if I could name my fellow-sufferers, we would unite together in obtaining a most signal revenge; but you are such a doughty hero, and, withal, so evanescent a spright, that you elude the force of common exertions.</P>
<P>How you became acquainted with Monimia's tale of sorrow, is an enigma, of which it will be conceived that <HI>delicacy</HI> forbids me to seek an explanation! The probability is, that you have practised upon her sim∣plicity, and, insinuating yourself into the good graces of the afflicted fair one, by some illicit methods, you have at length obtained her confidence; and, as I am one of the best natured men in the world, extending the sceptre of my clemency, I shall view, with proper indulgence, the <HI>imbecilities of nature.</HI> Doubtless, I could have restored the tranquillity of my wife, with∣out troubling either you or myself with my observa∣tions; but, besides that I conceive your temerity mer∣its chastisement, as you have impertinently precipitat∣ed me, and an affair which was wholly mine, to public view. I am induced to believe, that the eclaircissement hath thus acquired a kind of right to publicity.</P>
<P>Monimia will remember, that I not long since paid a visit to my relations at B—. My kinsman S—has a daughter, <HI>not yet twelve years old,</HI> who is very in∣genious, and handles her scissors to admiration; <HI>she cut my watch-paper, and she will be proud of furnishing Monimia with any little fancy pieces which she may wish.</HI> On my return home, I made a display of my acquisi∣tion. Monimia, <HI>hastily</HI> and <HI>tremulously, made some round about inquiries, relative to the fair artificer—these I would not understand—I dislike every symptom of suspicion in la∣dies; suspicion looks so like jealousy, and jealousy looks so like want of confidence, I remained silent, and affected a kind of, what the ladies call, delicate embarrassment.</HI> Perhaps I was wrong; but had I been apprised that the impression made by <HI>so light a thing as a watch-paper,</HI> could have been so serious, I should certainly have endeavoured to erase it.</P>
<P>I have, Mr. Meddler, the honour—<HI>the honour</HI>—no, that's wrong—<HI>I have not the honour</HI>—I have <HI>the conde∣scension</HI>

<SALUTE>MR. VIGILLIUS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have given your examples under fictitious names, I am not furnished with a rational cause of an∣ger; and yet, Sir, you have so well pointed circumstan∣ces, that it is impossible for the real claimant to avoid assuming habiliments, which can fit no one but himself.</P>
<P>Mystery is indeed the parent of conjecture, and con∣cealment most surely engenders suspicion. Authors are doubtless justifiable, in procuring every warranta∣ble illustration of their sentiments, and of those infer∣ences which they wish to deduce; and even a <HI>desire</HI> to inform, or to improve, is entitled to grateful respect. If my Clarissa, or her favoured Altamont, can furnish either amusement or instruction to the Gleaner and his numerous readers, any little anecdote, relative to us, is extremely at their service. My Clarissa is more dear to my soul than the life-blood which warms me to ex∣istence; she hath not, she never had, nor ever can have, a rival in my affections. She reigns sole mistress in my heart, and to her peerless virtues my every thought does homage. Yet, while I avow a fealty so unreserved, I am bold enough to confess my property in the beautifully glossy look of hair, a discovery of which has been so surreptitiously obtained; that I have treasured up this lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of hair, I also acknowledge; nor will I consent to part with it, until the last breath shall quiver upon my lips. Further, my own hands severed the contested lock from the head of a lovely female, who was dear to me as nature, as amity, or as my fondest hopes of happiness. All this is most true; and it is likewise true, that this female was not Clarissa!</P>
<P>Are you immeasurably astonished? Step to the oth∣er side of the piece, and it will assume another hue. I am not a native of America; I have lived only five years in this paradise of liberty. I had a sister—good
<PB N="343" REF="034162_0342_0FFA653A5A4BA8B0"/>
God! how unfortunate was that sister! amiable as virtue, and indulgent as Heaven; she merited every thing short of adoration, from that world which perse∣cuted her, almost from the first hour of her existence. Execrable world!—the virtues of a Clarissa were nec∣essary to reconcile me to an abode among thy deeply designing and treacherously murderous inhabitants! I have forborne to narrate to my Clarissa the story of my sister's woes; her misfortunes were too strongly marked with anguish, to be imposed upon the exqui∣sitely tender feelings of that susceptible bosom, which melts with soft regrets at the tale of woe, and which has a sigh even for the common ills of life. Nay, those deplorable circumstances which hovered round the steps of my ill-fated sister, I have sedulously sought to blot even from my own memory. I would remem∣ber only her virtues, her angel goodness, her beauteous image, and her saint-like fortitude; but, alas! those recollections are so interwoven with the cruel events of her life, as to render a separation impossible.</P>
<P>Orphanaged in her earliest bud; the sport of ca∣price, malice and duplicity, through the unsuspecting morn of life; and, in her marriage choice, placing her virtuous confidence in a man, who, by a specious exterior, villanously deceived her; who wore the garb of integrity, honour, generosity, and a mild and con∣ceding disposition of soul, on purpose to betray her easy faith; who no sooner exchanged the nuptial vow, than throwing off the mask, and commencing tyrant, he became unweariedly ingenious in his devices to tor∣ment the victim of his power; who persecuted her to the death, nor suspended, for a single moment, his sav∣age and detested operations, until, with a broken heart, she yielded up her breath, falling the martyr of assum∣ed prerogative, cruelty and despotism.</P>
<P>Angelic sufferer! mild and submissive, thou utter∣ed no complaint; not a vindictive expression escaped thee; and had thy murderer possessed but common pru∣dence, the knowledge of thy unprecedented wrongs would have been consigned to the grave with thee. Through all thy hard fortune, I followed still an im∣potent spectator of thy injuries; but, while appearan∣ces
<PB N="344" REF="034162_0343_0FFC688A063E53E0"/>
were preserved, custom forbid a brother's interfer∣ence, and an impeachment of thy husband's character would have been an incurable wound to thy delicacy. What shall I further say? He who made her, regard∣ing her with sacred pity, the pity of a God, her eman∣cipation was accelerated, and she drew her last breath in my arms! I saw her lovely bosom surcease the corroding sigh; I saw her heavenly form quietly dis∣posed upon the bed of death; and, my Clarissa, it was in that agonized moment, that I severed from its kin∣dred tresses, the shining ringlet, which, straying from its inclosure, fell unconscious upon her snowy forehead.</P>
<P>I grieve that it hath been to you the source of in∣quietude; but its value, at that distressing period, ap∣peared to me immense; nor has reason or time essen∣tially depreciated its importance. I could never per∣suade myself to part with it to an artist, who would have ostensibly returned it to me, in the form of cher∣ubs, urns and inscriptions; for I have still preferred contemplating its natural beauties; and I employed my first serene moments in preparing those lines, in which to enshrine it, that have been erroneously called poetical. For the gratification of the curiosity of your readers, Mr. Gleaner, I take leave to subjoin a copy of them:

<P>IF Cordelia will take the trouble to order her ser∣vant to make the proper inquiries at Mr. Lovegold, the jeweller's, in Middle-street, she will find that her sleeve-buttons are laid up there, for the purpose of ob∣taining the necessary repairs. As Cordelia and you seem to understand one another, I thought best to give her this information through the channel of your paper.</P>

<L>"Malice doth merit, as its shade, pursue."</L>
</LG>
<P>I could very modestly propose myself as a new proof of the truth of this oft-cited sentiment, which if I mis∣take not, time and observation hath elevated into an approved axiom. I could, I say, leaving those who are offended to chew the cud of resentment, easily con∣sole myself, by so <HI>convenient</HI> an <HI>appropriation;</HI> but I freely confess, that I set a high value upon the opin∣ion of the world; <HI>I mean the worthy part of the world, to be sure;</HI> and that thus stimulated, I feel myself im∣pelled to make my defence, by producing a short sketch of my plan of operations.</P>
<P>When I was first seized with the mania of scribbling, I very wisely endeavoured to combat it by much de∣liberate consideration, and many a salutary antidote. Wisdom, attired in the alluring habiliments of tran∣quillity, and armed with the rhetoric of reason, sagely
<PB N="346" REF="034162_0345_0FFC68842B8CB650"/>
advanced her plea, and with great perspicuity, and energy of argument, she advocated that kind of seren∣ity, which is the accompaniment of the unambitious man: who, gliding down the stream of time, inhaleth not the feverish gale; but wafted onward by the equal breath of contentment, partakes its mildly influence, and lives but to bless the gently undulating zephyr, that is thus silently impelling him athwart that ocean, upon which the <HI>adventurous</HI> voyager is fated to contend with hopes and fears, and with all those tumultuous winds of passion, which frequently involving him in a fearful hurricane, fail not to wreck his peace, whelm∣ing beneath their tremendous waves the brightest moments of his existence! Wisdom pointed out the wretched state of inquietude, anxiety, nightly watch∣ings, and daily fatigues, to which that unhappy and misguided wight is condemned, who, betrayed by an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> is allured from the humble vale of soft and silent repose; from the calm possession of each social and domestic enjoyment, to encounter the various ills attendant upon a pursuit of <HI>artificial good.</HI> Wisdom enumerated a host of weary toils, of woe-begone re∣grets, of unrecompensed deeds of worth, of thankless achievements, and of barbed disappointments; and she painted in glowing colours the ingratitude of that world to which I would madly devote those hours, that might otherwise revolve, marked by the most re∣fined, rational and exquisite satisfaction.</P>
<P>Wisdom delineated the thorny circles which begirt the hill of fame; she bid me haste from the magic of her voice, from the mad contagion of her votaries; and, sheltering in the sweet and flowery walks of hu∣mility, she conjured me to embosom my aspiring views in the deepest recesses of my native shades; and, that she might forever dash my proud pretensions, and in∣vigorate that despair, which, with icy grasp, and tor∣pid influence, hovered round my steps, she represented in forms tremendously terrific, those deadly fiends, that with ghastly features, and unrelenting rigour, eternal∣ly guard the glittering domes of same. Envy, with snaky locks, empoisoned veins, and pestilential breath
<PB N="347" REF="034162_0346_0FFC68829D9A2000"/>
—Malice, with tongue envenomed, armed with ten thousand shafts of instant death, and smiling at destruc∣tion—Pale disappointment, marked by sorrow's train, with sad and solemn step, heaving corroding sighs, quaffing her copious tears, and in despondence garbed—and, last of all, deep shame, with face averted, eyes withdrawn, and red consuming anguish, confessed thy power, heart appalling, spirit wounding, soul abashing scorn. Afflicting ridicule—satires dread sting—the crit∣ic's whip, which hissed along the air—with every plague which a poor author ever knew—these Wisdom sum∣moned, and in fearful order the direful phalanx stood.</P>
<P>Yet my aspiring mind, steeled for the conflict, all in ar∣mour clad, and shielded by temerity—assuming reso∣lution, and armed by pertinacity, presumed with dar∣ing steps, and enterprizing rashness, to penetrate the embodied opposition, <HI>and Reason plead in vain.</HI> Head∣long ambition, all precepts notwithstanding, continu∣ed inflexibly persevering, and triumphed in the con∣flict. Ambition selected its ornaments, and it wore on its left breast, close to the heart, a bouquet, whose per∣fumed buds were, with intrepid daring, snatched from the stock of ever blooming hope. In this it prided much, and fondly fancied that some future day, be∣decked with sunny beams, would give the deathless flowre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to enwreath its time distinguished, time adorn∣ed brow. Thus breathing mid such odoriferous airs; incense so sweet inhaling, intoxicated reason, treading enchanted ground, by magic spells enfolded, and wrapped in gay delusion, its firmness lost—Ambition seized the reins—the die was cast—and helter-skelter round the world we drove.</P>
<P>But, seriously, although thus rashly embarked, <HI>judg∣ment</HI> occasionally officiates; and while temerity sets at the helm, <HI>she</HI> often, matron like, interposes her cau∣tionary directions, and to be duly influenced by her counsels, is a prime object, even in the arrangements of ambition.</P>
<P>There is hardly any thing I have so much feared, as the sands of oblivion; and that I might produce a stream of sufficient depth to fleet my little skiff, my
<PB N="348" REF="034162_0347_0FFC68805F3F7B30"/>
faculties, diligently exercised, have been almost con∣stantly employed. Mankind have generally furnish∣ed my reservoir; and I have set in the circles which I frequent, industriously improving a hint, marking the sentiment of worth, catching every unwrought gem, and eagerly availing myself of those circumstances, which I conceived I might <HI>honestly</HI> appropriate. Names I have been careful to conceal; and studiously embel∣ishing events, and qualifying them to convey amuse∣ment, information, or even instruction, I have produ∣ced them as candidates for the attention of a vacant moment. Thus occupied, it will cease to be matter of surprise, that I have treasured even the <HI>whispers</HI> of conversation; my ear is constantly on duty, and it hath proved to me a truly faithful scout. Collected in myself, I am often regarded as a mute in society; but I am careful to hoard every remark, and bearing the multifarious burden to my working hive, it under∣goeth a chymical process; and, after receiving in my pericranium the destined form, it is with all due hu∣mility submitted to public observation.</P>
<P>Thus Eugenio, if he will give his candour full play, may perceive, that without being the favourite confi∣dante, "<HI>of all the young, handsome married women of my acquaintance,</HI>" I may, <HI>the loquacity of the sex considered,</HI> legally become possessed of <HI>secrets,</HI> which are <HI>whispered to select friends,</HI> which are gathered from <HI>mysterious</HI> words, and which sometimes result from those <HI>expres∣sive</HI> looks, in which the <HI>female world</HI> are such proficients, and which they so well know <HI>when to assume.</HI> On the whole, while I have generally aimed at utility, I have studiously endeavoured to avoid all occasion of offence; but if my honest intentions have not been crowned with success, as it is impossible to recal the past, I can only assure Eugenio, and every reader of his descrip∣tion, that I will be indefatigably industrious to render my future numbers less exceptionable.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>"TAKE away this child," said the late benevo∣lent Dr. Cooper, while seated with the cele∣brated Dr. Franklin, in a little retired breakfasting parlour—<Q>Take away this child—her questions inter∣rupt our conversation, and are an impertinent intru∣sion upon the enjoyments of an hour, devoted to an entertainment of the highest kind.</Q> "Nay, nay," cried the philosopher—<Q>let her stay, let her stay; she is a stranger in our world, and she has a right to make her inquiries relative to the manners and cus∣toms of the people, among whom, the probability is, she has many years to sojourn.</Q></P>
<P>Men and women are too haughty, and form too ele∣vated conceptions of the distance between them and the little race of mortals who are, <HI>for a season,</HI> their dependants. There is a freedom of access, and a chas∣tized familiarity, which is very compatible with a due spirit of government; but <HI>mild dignity</HI> is an association too little known, and too rarely exemplified in the pres∣ent order of things.</P>
<P>The trust reposed in parents and preceptors, is in∣deed important; the character of the rising generation
<PB N="6" REF="034162_0352_0FFC6B2B61D88D00"/>
is in their gift, and the peace or anarchy of society must result from them. When we consider how few parents are endowed by nature, or qualified by im∣provement, for the judicious as discharge of duties so es∣sential, we are almost ready to give our voice in favour of that plan, which, in a certain celebrated communi∣ty, placed their youth under the tutelage of the State, commiting their education to persons deliberately cho∣sen, and properly qualified for their high office. Yet, against this arrangement, the authority derived from the Father of the universe, forcibly pleads! The feel∣ings of the parent indignantly revolt; and my right to direct my own child, is, in my own estimation, unques∣tionable. Well then, there remains but one remedy—Let the cultivation of the minds of the man and woman, in miniature, be of that description which will, in future, enable them to assume with advantage, the guardianship of their descendants.</P>
<P>Much, in this momentous department, depends on <HI>female administration;</HI> and the mother, or the woman to whom she may delegate her office, will imprint on the opening mind, characters, ideas and conclusions, which time, in all its variety of vicissitudes, will never be able to erase.</P>
<P>Surely then, it is politic to bestow upon the educa∣tion of girls the most exact attention: Let them be able to converse correctly and elegantly, (in their native strains) with the children they may usher into being; and, since the pronunciation is best fixed in the early part of life, let them be qualified to give the little pro∣ficients a pleasing impression of the French language; nor, it is conceived, ought it to be considered as <HI>unsexual,</HI> if they were capacitated to render the rudiments of the Latin tongue familiar. An acquaintance with history would capacitate mothers to select their nursery tales from those transactions which have actually taken place upon our globe, and thus useful knowledge would su∣persede fairy legendary witches, and hob-goblins. Geography also might be introduced, and the little prattlers, by information that the great globe whereon
<PB N="7" REF="034162_0353_0FFC6B28F41EC600"/>
they move, has received the form of that orange which so pleasingly regales their palate, would, ere they were aware, be ushered to the avenues of instruction. As∣tronomy too may lend its aid; the blazing fire may represent the sun, and the little bird revolving to its flame, on which they so impatiently wait to feast, un∣der the direction of the well informed and judicious tutoress, may gradually account for light and heat, the grateful vicissitudes of night and day, with the alternate succession of the seasons; and thus would the task of the future preceptor be rendered easy, a thirst for knowledge created, and the threshold of wisdom strewed with flowers.</P>
<P>But children commonly pass from the hands of their parents to that of their tutors at a very early period; and was I invested with the powers of legisla∣tion, or was the gift of conferring honours mine, there is no order of citizens which I would so liberally en∣dow, and raise to such distinction, as those individuals who devote themselves to the education of youth. But then they should be persons unquestionably qual∣ified for their office, and entitled beyond all contro∣versy to the approbation of their country. Arduous is the undertaking—the first abilities are requisite—and it is impossible to rate too high the worth of those who are thus suitably accomplished. Permit me, reader, to sketch the outlines of the character of a Pre∣ceptor whom I should delight to honour. Imagination this moment presents him—he blends exquisite sensi∣bility with uniform patience—he is remarkably en∣during—never hasty or impetuous—calmly deliberate in all his movements—carefully investigating, nor ever inflicting punishments, but such as both in <HI>quantity</HI> and <HI>quality</HI> are righteously due. <HI>He possesseth extensive knowledge of the science</HI> or <HI>sciences which he teaches</HI>—he is free from every external blemish, and remarkable for no unfortunate singularity—his manners are elegant, and in the best sense of the word descriptive of the gentleman. He is celebrated for benevolence—he is an indisputable philanthropist—he possesseth the hap∣py
<PB N="8" REF="034162_0354_0FFC6B276D95C8D8"/>
secret of assimilating dignity and condescension—his inborn integrity is undoubted, and he is master of sufficient address to obtain an entire ascendency over the minds of his pupils—a stranger to prejudice, he is, strictly speaking, impartial—and, to say all in one word, he embodies every virtue of which humanity is susceptible: Nor is the sketch too highly wrought, for it is assuredly true, that to accommodate the mind to the various dispositions to be found in a large school, and so to understand the intellectual arrangement of each individual as to be capable of rendering him the important services, which are necessary, must indispu∣tably require every excellence, and the utmost perfec∣tion of our nature.</P>
<P>The austere man can never be successful; he will banish smiles from the face of that season which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made for joy; and if the student is not uncommonly endowed by nature, he will create in him an aversion to his book. Severity will always operate upon the opening mind, like the chilling blasts of winter upon the tender plant; it droops its blighted head, its pow∣ers are rendered torpid, its strength is prostrated, and it is well, if the progressing principle (if I may so ex∣press myself) which is at present latent, doth not be∣come wholly extinct. Blows are the most easy expe∣dient, and are, perhaps for that reason, too often resorted too—the <HI>castigation of the boy, frequently gratifies the passions of the master,</HI> and he is sometimes vindictive and inhuman in his punishments. If the giving a <HI>wrong sound to a letter, or forgetting a sentence, is to be marked by blows—what resource, permit me to ask, has the Preceptor in the event of capital crimes?</HI> A man who is himself free from error, or, which will have the same effect upon his pupils, who is studious to conceal his foibles from their knowledge, who is solicitous to attach them to his person, and who carefully impresses an idea of his own affection toward them, who labours to obtain their confidence, and makes free use of that <HI>noble incentive, Praise</HI>—such a man will seldom, I im∣agine, find it necessary to have recourse to severity;
<PB N="9" REF="034162_0355_0FFC6B25339287A8"/>
and it is incontestibly true, that punishments, <HI>especial∣ly blows,</HI> should be repeated as seldom as possible; for assuredly, nothing can be obtained by rendering the little offender <HI>callous, familiarizing him to disgrace, or banishing from his bosom the hope of unblemished reputation. The first offences of children,</HI> whatever may be their na∣ture, should invariably be considered as venial; and it would be always right, if practicable, to convict them <HI>without a witness</HI>—we cannot be too solicitous to spare them he <HI>first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lush of guilt; the second will not be so deep,</HI> and they will too soon leap the boundaries of inno∣cence. I would <HI>affect</HI> to suppose them incapable of the turpitude of a criminal action; and I would constantly repeat, while there remained the least shadow of prob∣ability for such an avowal, that I was confident they would never <HI>debase</HI> themselves by the infamy of delib∣erate vice; thus, it is <HI>possible,</HI> that the fear of forfeiting our <HI>supposed good opinion</HI> would engage them <HI>silently to tread back the path they have reprehensibly entered.</HI></P>
<P>I remember, some time since, being greatly shocked at receiving an account of an arrangement (which I would fain hope is singular) in a certain school of some celebrity, situated in one of our sea-ports not far distant from the metropolis. Rewards are offered, and every method taken to prove a crime—say, for example, a falsehood. While the child, in all the sim∣plicity of infantile confidence, remains unconscious of the conspiracy formed against him! Irrefragable con∣viction is at length obtained, and the culprit is imme∣diately proclaimed throughout the school—he is en∣tered upon the <HI>lying list,</HI> and takes his seat upon a range which produces him a proper subject for the ill-natured ridicule of the whole flock. Nor is this enough—his name is written in capitals with the igno∣minious term, <HI>Liar,</HI> at the end of it. The defama∣tory sentence is posted up in some conspicuous place, for the <HI>inspection, not only of the children, but of every in∣dividual who may happen to visit the school; and this mark of infamy once affixed, is not taken down as long as the aggressor continues a student in this seminary!!!</HI> My face
<PB N="10" REF="034162_0356_0FFC6B22A5317048"/>
glows with indignation, while penning this relation. What has the little wretch to hope for under such tuition; after such a procedure, (labouring under the weight of a most opprobrious verdict, and the victim of unwarrantable severity) where will he find spirits to pursue, with the requisite alacrity, his appointed stud∣ies? Or how can he advantageously receive lessons from the mouth of him, who has thus unmercifully blistered his reputation? Are not the ill effects of this arrangement both upon the <HI>school in general, and the offender in particular,</HI> sufficiently obvious? Is not undue degradation, envy, rancour, implacability, everlasting, disgrace, and consequent despair, thus systematized, and embattled against that order, harmony, and im∣provement, which would inevitably result from the adoption of a mild spirit of government? Gracious God!—but let me exercise the patience that I would recommend as the uniform companion and bosom friend of the preceptor, and of which a view of the situation to which the foregoing discipline, or, more properly speaking, infamous tyranny, must reduce the offending student, had well near deprived me—and let me, with all due deference <HI>to the general merit,</HI> and <HI>superior abilities</HI> of the gentleman, who will feel himself interested in this representation, calmly ask, would it not be more judicious to aim at acting the part of an <HI>invisible spy,</HI> continuing a silent observer of every action until the transgression <HI>is evident</HI> or <HI>strongly suspected,</HI> and even then would it not be well to follow the offender by <HI>private admonitions</HI>—to address his reason; to enlist his affections; to delineate in forcible language his error, and energetically to describe the tremendous consequences of an obstinate adherence to guilty pur∣suits? <HI>Public shame, in the recess of a private interview, might be flashed in his face;</HI> probably he would shrink from its horrors, and the <HI>hope of escaping so indelible an evil,</HI> might engage him to return to the haunts of vir∣tue—might ensure his dereliction of vice.</P>
<P>Many of my readers will recollect the method pur∣sued by Gang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nell, when an inferior Ecclesiastic, for

the recovery of a beloved and notorious offender; and all who do, will not fail to applaud. It is, however, a melancholy truth, that these mild efforts will not always procure a reformation. But surely, previous to a <HI>publication of disgrace,</HI> a consultation of parents or guardians should be obtained; and as those deeply interested characters ought invariably to <HI>coalesce with the preceptors in whom they confide,</HI> no important step should be taken, without their knowledge and appro∣bation. I am aware that this precludes the idea of <HI>secrecy</HI> in regard to school discipline; and I must confess, that I seriously wish the <HI>telling tales out of school,</HI> was no longer held up as a bug-bear to children, and that the terror it has so long excited, was entirely abolished. Rectitude submitteth its administration to the strictest scrutiny; the more it is known, the more it is admir∣ed; and the arrangements of equity soliciteth inquiry.</P>
<P>The magnitude of my subject, bars the supposition that it can be too warmly expatiated upon. Children, I insist, should be brought forward with gentleness. The wise king of Israel was not <HI>always wise;</HI> and when he is found so <HI>petulantly</HI> exclaiming, "<HI>Spare the rod and spoil the child,</HI>" the probability is, that, crowded upon by the <HI>ill-regulated offspring of his illicit and multifarious amours,</HI> he had lost that balance of equanimity, which is so proper to the philosopher. The tutor should nev∣er be permitted to act the part of a despot; he should ever be free of access, and while he uniformly pre∣serves a mild spirit of government, the pupil, under proper regulations, should be permitted a sufficient lat∣itude of inquiry.</P>
<P>Every anxious parent experiences the difficulty of obtaining a preceptor, to whom he can confide the care of his children. But if the emoluments of the office were proportioned to the solicitude and impor∣tance of the undertaking, if it was more honorary, and if there were greater distinctions annexed thereto, an adequate number of candidates, of meritorious candi∣dates, would present. Countless advantages would
<PB N="12" REF="034162_0358_0FFC6B1EC942FCA8"/>
accrue to families, and consequences the most benefi∣cial, would result to the community at large.</P>
<P>The ancients, we are told, formed such just ideas of the nature and momentous consequences of education, as to esteem the cultivation of the minds of their young people among their most dignified offices; and per∣sons of the first consideration, possessing affluence, and obtaining general confidence, engaged in the arduous task, delighting to employ themselves in shaping the principles, and pointing the views, of those who were to succeed them in the great drama of life. And was not this perfectly right? The good preceptor is of course ennobled; and no just reason can be given why he should not take rank in the highest grade of the community. For my own part, I again repeat, that deliberate reflection upon the nature of his duties, and the magnitude of those effects which frequently de∣pend upon his regency, has constrained me to regard him as more consequential, and of higher importance, than even the authority which is constituted supreme in any country; nay, further, that school dame, redu∣ced by adverse circumstances to confer the rudiments of instruction, and to call into action the latent seeds of worth, is of more value (supposing she judiciously and faithfully performs the trust reposed in her) in the great scale of excellence, than she, who, from consider∣ations of wealth or beauty, receives the adulation of gathering crowds. This is an obvious truth, inas∣much as it is the exertions of the tutoress, succeeded by the more extensive operations of the preceptor, that will render easy the seat of the magistrate, and super∣cede the necessity of coercive interposition, giving uni∣versal order to take place, as naturally as the hours succeed each other, or as the blessings of light proceed from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rb of day. From whence is derived the fe∣licity of families? Undoubtedly from a due regulation of the individuals of which they are composed, and particularly from a proper arrangement of the young people who constitute such important parts thereof. From what source results the well-being of the great
<PB N="13" REF="034162_0359_0FFC6B1AB75B6EB8"/>
body of the people? Indisputably from the informa∣tion, correct movements, and order of its members. And is not the due qualification of teachers, and the faithful discharge of the duties of their office, the broad and solid basis, on which is erected the superstructure of whatsoever is necessary in the economy of private life, public usefulness, or general celebrity? I say then, <HI>if these things are true,</HI> let us encourage by every means the <HI>worthy preceptor;</HI> let us cherish him as the origin of virtue; and while we discountenance every vestige of tyranny, let us firmly resolve to strengthen the hands of those, to whom we have <HI>deliberately</HI> confided the care of our children.</P>

<P>"GOOD Mr. Gleaner," said a rural friend of mine, <Q>I think you <HI>lose ground</HI> by the prolixity of your numbers; and, to say truth, you often remind me of Farmer Straggleford, who whimsically erect∣ed a number of huge enormous granaries, which, when completed, remained monuments of his osten∣tation, for having rendered himself, by his prodig∣ious exertions, and the extensiveness of his plans, an insolvent debtor; his buildings, of course, contain nothing of value, indeed they are nearly unoccupied, and he is regarded as a poor bankrupt, who has been the fabricator of his own <HI>conspicuous insignificancy.</HI> Now, had neighbour Straggleford contented him∣self with a snug little barn, he might have kept his grounds, and, storing it every year with the ripened produce of the season, he might—</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034162_0360_0FFC6B17F085A568"/>
Say no more, Brother Thrifty, cried I—say no more; I perfectly understand you, although it must be con∣fessed your illustration is rather far fetched; yet, trust me, it shall be my endeavour in future to circumscribe, as much as possible, my excursive rambles; and agree∣able to this determination I abridge a number of sheets, that I had entitled an essay on education, confining myself to a few observations, which I most unfeigned∣ly wish may be duly considered.</P>
<P>The question whether private or public education is of the most general utility, has agitated the minds, and employed the pens, of many ingenious writers; but the subject, as far as I am informed, still remains prob∣lematical; nor shall I arrogantly pretend to decide where those Doctors of literature so widely disagree. Yet the Gleaner, without incurring the charge of temer∣ity, may perhaps be permitted to ask whether it would not be wisdom to defer the choice of public or private tuition, until the disposition of the child is ascertained? The modest, diffident mind, may stand in need of all those stimulatives that are in the gift of a large school. Retiring efforts are often roused to action by emula∣tion; and that fame which a conspicuous situation fre∣quently confers, may at once allure, and give a mo∣tive to ambition. There are minds, peculiarly attu∣ned to all the sensibilities, which are at once the ce∣ment, the ornament, and the source of those gentler virtues that connect, that meliorate, and that actuate beings who combine, and who are formed to cultivate the endearing charities, the elegancies, and the bles∣sings of social life. To accommodate an intellect of this description to the multifarious and frequently dis∣cordant scenes that are to be encountered in a world, where ill-judged asperities too often wound the exqui∣sitely delicate feelings of susceptibility, a various and extensive intercourse with mankind may be necessary. But the boy, whose bold aspiring temper precipitates him upon an undue assumption of importance, who suddenly rushes forward to those distinctions, which are only proper to maturity; such a boy, methinks, should
<PB N="15" REF="034162_0361_0FFC6B155506B0C0"/>
receive the checks of retirement; should be formed to knowledge and to virtue, amid the shades of seques∣tered life; care being taken to furnish him with those views, which may gradually accustom him to a proper estimation of himself.</P>
<P>My wishes, relative to the instruction of young peo∣ple, comprise every thing which can be considered as useful or ornamental; but I am especially solicitous, that they should be made <HI>critically</HI> acquainted with that language, in which they are destined to <HI>converse, transact business,</HI> and <HI>adjust their pleasurable pursuits.</HI> Some of my acquaintance have made greater profi∣ciency in many branches of study, than in their mother tongue; and I know persons who can pass rapidly through a Latin author, who cannot easily trace the lineage or description of the several parts of speech in their native English; who cannot readily decline a noun; who hesitate with respect to the cases nomina∣tive, possessive, and objective; and who are at a loss to follow the verb through number, person, mood, and tense.</P>
<P>Latidius should be a good Latin scholar; he has received the honours of a university; and yet it is a fact, that Latidius cannot write a billet, in which an English grammarian will not be able to point out, I had almost said, as many errors as there are lines! Is Latidius censurable for this deficiency? Perhaps he is much less so than those who had the direction of his education. Great care was taken to usher him into the world, perfectly accomplished in every requisite except his vernacular tongue; but, while engaged in the study of the <HI>dead languages,</HI> he was never taught a due deference for, or proper estimation of, his own:</P>
<P>I should not be satisfied, if my sons and daughters did not speak, read, and write English, <HI>grammatically, critically,</HI> and even <HI>elegantly.</HI> Perhaps the accurate ob∣server may, at this moment, shrewdly remark—<HI><Q>Sure∣ly, be who takes upon himself the character of Dictator, or arrogantly assumes the seat of the Censor, ought to be per∣fectly free from the errors which he condemns.</Q></HI> This is
<PB N="16" REF="034162_0362_0FFC6B12F388F670"/>
assuredly true; and, to the well-meaning and candid objector, I calmly answer—<HI>I have no where proposed my∣self as a model: It may be, that I am experimentally qual∣ified to descant upon the disadvantages attendant upon early inattention. For aught thou knowest, the Gleaner may have been doomed to the toilsome drudgery of gleaning his information, when years, diminishing the flexibility of the mental faculties, have rendered it difficult for them to re∣ceive impressions;</HI> and, if I am thus circumstanced, I may be allowed to delineate the inconveniences of, and energetically to lament a deficiency from which I so essentially suffer. Admitting, I say, this to be the case, I may, with the strictest propriety and the utmost consistency, proceed to point out the shoals which too often impede, and frequently wholly arrest my progress.</P>
<P>One thing is certain; for the rising generation, the devout orisons of my spirit are daily breathed. I have written <HI>primarily</HI> for my amusement—Truth is my pole star—I would contribute my mite to benefit my fellow-mortals—I have not designed ill—and, if I err, I hum∣bly entreat those who confer on my pages the honour of a perusal, to impute my errors rather to my head than to my heart.</P>
<P>The modern literati are generally sufficiently liberal in the eulogies which they bestow on the ancients; and, as <HI>imitation</HI> is commonly the offspring of <HI>admiration,</HI> is it not wonderful, they do not more frequently tread in their steps? Neither the Greeks nor the Romans in∣cumbered themselves with a variety of tongues; their own language always obtained a just <HI>pre-eminence,</HI> and never failed of engaging their earliest and most unre∣mitted application. The result was, natural children were qualified to converse, and to express themselves on paper, with elegance and accuracy; they were in∣itiated, in the morning of their days, into an acquaint∣ance with all the varieties of grammar; they could de∣lineate the several parts of speech; the intricacies of their language were rendered familiar to their under∣standings; they were capable of determining its com∣pass,
<PB N="17" REF="034162_0363_0FFC6B116EBA5378"/>
and of analyzing every sentence; they could, with the greatest precision, resolve each component word, placing it under its original head or description; And hence, it is said, (and the conjecture is founded in reason) proceeded those works of <HI>educated genius,</HI> which have stood the test of time, extorting a tribute of applause from every succeeding generation.</P>
<P>If I mistake not, (and upon this occasion I do what I seldom do—trust to the tenacity of my memory) there were periods, when the Romans, measuring the importance of their language by the dignity of their rational character, <HI>disdained the study even of the Greek tongue.</HI> Victors are fond of imposing their laws, their customs, and their language; and the universal preva∣lence of any particular mode of speech, would be one step toward the introduction of universal dominion. National attachment should, therefore, dictate the stu∣dious cultivation of a national language; and it may be worthy the exertions of an enlightened legislature, to erect a standard, to raise, to dignify, to perfect, and to polish a common tongue.</P>
<P>Is the student designed for the profession of any par∣ticular art or science, a vernacular language must be the vehicle of his ideas. Gentlemen at the bar de∣liver their harangues in their mother tongue; in na∣tive strains they address the impannelled jury, and jus∣tice frequently hangs upon their forcible, intelligent, and well constructed periods. The sacred Orator ad∣dresses his listening audience in familiar accents. The Representatives of our free, sovereign and independ∣ent States—Senators enrobed with power—Chief Jus∣tices delivering their solemn charges—and our august President, the Patriot WASHINGTON, invested with all that authority which <HI>virtuous liberty</HI> can confer, with every intervening grade—are all found delivering their sentiments, and arresting attention, in the well known sounds which designate the English tongue.</P>
<P>Letters are indisputably the elements of language; and the due arrangement, and fit construction of those words which they compose, is the broad basis on which
<PB N="18" REF="034162_0364_0FFC6B0E59540DF8"/>
towers the arts and sciences, forming, in their several orders, a superstructure replete with elegance, beauty and usefulness. It is from this source that the orator must draw his materials; poets too submit to its ad∣measurement; and the grave historian must be tried by its rules. Indeed, an early acquaintance with the nature, construction and latitude of a vernacular lan∣guage, is of such importance to every class of people, that it is wonderful there should be found parents and preceptors who can preserve their equanimity, while conscious that those committed to their charge are, in this truly essential part of education, almost totally neglected.</P>
<P>The train of reflections introduced by my subject, at this moment presents to my mind a person, who is now suffering much from this unnatural omission; and, as examples often enforce conviction more effectually than general remarks, I present him by way of illus∣tration.</P>
<P>Leontius, born in the midst of affluence, was nursed in the lap of plenty; and being the only son of deserv∣ing parents, who were generally judicious in their ar∣rangements, his education was regarded as a matter of the greatest moment. No expense was spared; and his preceptors were rewarded for their exertions not only with a liberal, but with a lavish hand. He had hardly completed his sixth year, when it was judged necessary he should commence his studies of the Latin tongue; and from that moment, hurried on from one stage of erudition to another, no portion of time was found to attend to his progress in that language, from which he was in a great measure to derive his future respectability. It was absurdly supposed, (if indeed it ever obtained a place in the reflections of either pa∣rents or tutor) that English would be a matter of course; and thus the boy was left to form unto himself a style, just as whim or caprice might direct. For a place at a celebrated seminary he was early presented a candidate; his acceptation was full and honorary—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e passed through the university, attending the accus∣tomed
<PB N="19" REF="034162_0365_0FFC6B0B12A2B4C8"/>
routine of instruction, and, enriched with aca∣demical applause, he received his first degree. Thus endowed, he made his <HI>entrée</HI> upon society, better quali∣fied to figure in any walk than as an English scholar. Without arrogating the gift of prophecy, it was easy to predict an event, which was precisely that which reason would have calculated. Awkward and untaught, his education had in effect produced him a stranger to those scenes in which he was hourly called upon to take a part. If he assayed the, to him, arduous task of entertaining his friends with an English book, false pronunciation, emphasis, and accent, were visible in every paragraph; comma's assumed the distinction of full stops, while the finely turned period lost all its beauty: Colons, semicolons, notes of interrogation and admiration, these were all promiscuously huddled together; and while by one continued monotony of sound, ideas were jumbled, and the auditory nerve dis∣gusted, it was in vain that his hearers fatigued themselves by an expectation of the sentiment of an author. Har∣monious accents, delicate inflexions of voice, and that animation, or energetic propriety, which is the vehi∣cle of intelligence—of these he had no idea; he seem∣ed in effect the determined foe of good reading, and he ought to have been arraigned as the murderer of sense. Candour would, however, have appeared as his advocate; and she might truly have specified, that such erroneous conclusions had obtained in his bosom, as taught him to regard every thing <HI>merely English</HI> with a sensation bordering upon contempt; and, she would have added, that he had been unavoidably pre∣cipitated upon these conclusions, by the total silence of his preceptors. As a writer, too, Leontius is highly deficient; and a girl who is dependent upon her nee∣dle for her support, supposing she has been properly educated, ought to blush if she could not surpass him in the correctness of her epistolary productions.</P>
<P>Yet it was expected that our young gentleman would attain eminence, deserve well of his country, and make his way to popularity among a race of beings who
<PB N="20" REF="034162_0366_0FFC6B0990063BE0"/>
spoke, wrote, declaimed, and transacted their commer∣cial concerns, altogether in English. Leontius was bred to no business; he was, as has been intimated, born to high pecuniary expectations, and it was presumed that his natural and acquired abilities would raise him to distinction. His exterior is dignified and preposses∣sing; and, notwithstanding his deficiencies as an En∣glish scholar, high ideas of his literature are entertain∣ed. He early wedded the discreet and beautiful Hen∣rietta, and soon became the father of a family; his parents and the friends of his youth have sunk into the grave, and misfortunes have robbed him of that patrimony, which, in the warmth of a youthful imag∣ination, he had calculated as exhaustless.</P>
<P>For Leontius what now remains? Education hath unfitted him for the preceptor of his own children—he is unqualified for every thing that is <HI>simply English;</HI> and while nature has endowed him with abilities which might capacitate him to become the bard, the essayist, or even the historian of his country, education inter∣poses its effectual barriers.</P>
<P>The want of an early and critical knowledge of a vernacular tongue, is deeply felt by a writer; an em∣ployment, which might otherwise be advantageous and pleasing, becomes real drudgery, and the experience of persons thus circumstanced, will oblige them to confess that it is something late to begin the study of a lan∣guage, after the age of adolescence hath passed away.</P>
<P>Necessity, however, hath called into action the facul∣ties of Leontius; some beautiful essays, with infinite labour, he hath completed; but he blushes at every line, lest the critic should detect him in doing violence to the subtleties of grammar; and each revolving day witnesses his lamentations that he was not early taught his mother tongue.</P>
<P>I condemn not the extensive studies in which our youth are engaged—far from it—French, Latin, Italian, and whatever else the understanding can attain, these are all little enough; but while my mind continues under the dominion of reason, I shall ever contend for a de∣cided
<PB N="21" REF="034162_0367_0FFC6B07349F8EC0"/>
preference as indisputably due to the mother tongue; and under this persuasion the necessity of en∣treating parents, guardians and preceptors of every description, continually to bear in mind what country is destined the theatre of action to those committed to their care, becomes apparent.</P>
<P>The English language is by inheritance ours. It is that in which we first breathe forth our filial grati∣tude; in those sentences which it comprises, we mani∣fest our family attachments—express our amities—shape our devotional orisons—transact business—form the most tender of all ties—address an infant family—fash∣ion the lives and manners of that family—and, final∣ly, embody that last solemn adieu, which is to precede our exit from the present to a higher order of existence.</P>
<P>The advantage of acquitting ourselves, on these occa∣sions, with propriety, must be obvious to every thinking mind; and the Gleaner imagines he can hardly be too importunate on a subject of such magnitude.</P>

<SALUTE>KIND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS Miss Melworth, now Mistress Hamilton, was unfortunately engaged previous to my application to
<PB N="22" REF="034162_0368_0FFC6B03C301E5C0"/>
you; as my plans are all under the direction of pru∣dence, and as I suppose you have some influence over her sister, Miss Clifford, if you can insure me, that she will not be so foolishly conscientious as to hold her∣self bound by a sort of a promise made to the boy William, who, it appears, is now in comfortable cir∣cumstances; and you must recollect, Mr. Vigillius, that you became a sort of a surety for the girl; these are your words, which I shall transcribe just as they stand in your twenty-eighth number. "<HI>Fear not, gen∣tle reader—by virtue of the patriarchal dignity which I have assumed, I will, upon a proper occasion, grant unto the said Serafina Clifford, a full and free absolution from this her inconsiderate vow, which I shall take care to impute to the irresistable influence of an impassioned moment.</HI>"</P>
<P>Now I say, Mr. Vigillius, if you do in reality pos∣sess such a power, and if you will absolutely and <HI>bona fide</HI> clear Miss Clifford, and the heirs lawfully born of her body, <HI>from all claims whatsoever, which the Ham∣iltons may, on any future emergency, find it convenient to lay to her estate, I will pass over the queer manner of her birth,</HI> and the odd way in which her true father con∣trived to smuggle her into his family, and she shall forthwith become my <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> wife <HI>until death.</HI> You know, friend Vigillius, there are some men of not <HI>half my property,</HI> who would be more <HI>squeamish;</HI> but so that I do but secure the <HI>main chance,</HI> I will not lose a bargain, although its instrument may not chance to be stampt with other people's ideas of legitimacy, and all that. To say truth, I think I cannot do better than to enter into your family; and, as you seem to have so much authority over Miss Clifford, (and she is now, by all account, the sister-in-law of Mrs. Hamilton) I consider her all one as a girl of yours; and being more and more determined to marry, I am in down∣right earnest in this business.</P>
<P>I have lately lost a sister, who, though she was what is commonly called an old maid, was nevertheless a very good house-wife, and managed my matters <HI>to a fraction; nothing was lost,</HI> and every <HI>penny</HI> was disposed
<PB N="23" REF="034162_0369_0FFC6B011FF13F00"/>
of to the <HI>best</HI> advantage; and yet, Mr. Gleaner, she stood me in no more, take one year with another, ex∣clusive of her board, (and, by the way, she would <HI>live upon next to nothing)</HI> than <HI>fifteen pounds per year.</HI> Was I to take a house-keeper, who would not consider my interest as her own, she might <HI>waste a great deal, and in the long run spend much more than a good, sober, discreet wife,</HI> while I should have not one of the comforts of mat∣rimony. I know, Mr. Gleaner, that you are fond of saving, and that you calculate these things; and I therefore take it for certain, that you will think with me. It is true, I have a number of other sisters—ay, and brothers too, for there are a pretty many of us; <HI>the Plodders are a numerous family;</HI> but what of all that? they are every mother's son of them married and settled; and, having all of them children, some of whom are grown up, they reckon upon me as free plunder. I can see by the twist of their features, that they have already divided my acres among them: They visit me, it is true, very often—are very com∣plaisant, and all that; but I can see, plain enough, it is for the <HI>loaves and fishes,</HI> and that were it not for the <HI>legacies</HI> for which they are hunting. I should see but very little of them. I have a thousand reasons, all clear as day light, by which I am assured they do not care <HI>three brass farthings for me.</HI> I have lately recov∣ered from a dangerous illness, and although they im∣agine they have <HI>topped their parts</HI> very well, and that they are as <HI>secure as a thief in a mill,</HI> yet I could see, plain enough, under all their pretended grief, that they were ready to <HI>sing for joy,</HI> when the <HI>physicians</HI> pronounc∣ed my disorder <HI>incurable;</HI> and, moreover, I <HI>overheard their conversation when they supposed me in a delirium;</HI> and their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> now that I have, contrary to the expectations of every one, got about again, is as <HI>plain as that two and two make four;</HI> however, if I do not contrive effectually to disappoint them, my name is not Timothy Plodder.</P>
<P>I think, therefore, Mr. Gleaner, considering (as I observed to you in a former letter) my age, that Miss
<PB N="24" REF="034162_0370_0FFC6AFF96423630"/>
Serafina and myself have no time to lose; and so if you will out of hand propose the matter, and let me know when I may see the young woman, or yourself, or her brother Hamilton, we will conclude the bargain with all possible dispatch, before my relations <HI>get scent</HI> of the business; for they absolutely grow very saucy, and I am determined to <HI>show them some little Plodders, whom they little expect to see;</HI> and then we shall know who is to be respected, and all that. I will make Miss Clifford a good husband; she shall have every thing she can <HI>reasonably desire;</HI> and I will continue, kind and respected Sir, your's to serve, <HI>until death,</HI></P>

<P>Now I mentions Miss Clifford's brother, I will tell you, Mr. Gleaner, about my own brother, our Valen∣tine—Why you must know, that my papa says, <HI>how that</HI> he has almost broken his heart; and I am sure for it, that he has made me cry as bad, every bit and grain, as if I had been reading a <HI>tragedy,</HI> or a <HI>novel.</HI> I will tell you how it was—why he would be gone from our house whole evenings together, and some∣times <HI>e'en a most all night,</HI> and my papa could never get out of him where he was, or what he was about; and so, at last, he <HI>abdicated</HI> himself from his own home, and his <HI>natural-born father</HI> altogether, and my papa could not tell where to look for him, and we never <HI>knowed</HI> till <HI>tother</HI> day we <HI>adventitiously</HI> found out, that he was privately married to Molly Brazen; to whom he used to write love-letters and <HI>epitaphs, and those sort of poetricks,</HI> directing them every one to Miss <HI>Clarinda Paragon,</HI> and signing himself her <HI>everlasting adorer, Valentine Lovelong</HI>—for my part, <HI>I thinks</HI> it is a <HI>burning shame,</HI> that he should bring such an <HI>indeliating</HI> disgrace upon names which is so <HI>monstrously fine.</HI> My papa says <HI>as how</HI> that it is all owing to your <HI>historettas</HI> and your <HI>commedies,</HI> and your <HI>plays;</HI> but I wont believe it; I knows its no such thing, and it makes me cry, out of pure vexation, to hear <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>demeanours,</HI> and all these <HI>gentilities and handsomenesses,</HI> which are taken out of <HI>these here</HI> kind of books, spoken of in so <HI>metreposterous</HI> and so <HI>absorbed</HI> a manner. I knows bet∣ter, Mr. Gleaner, I knows that Molly Brazen is a very bad girl; she is not—God forgive her—<HI>one morsel better than she should be;</HI> and she would have had my brother, if she could have <HI>cotch him,</HI> though he had never look∣ed into a book in the <HI>universal world.</HI> I <HI>knows</HI> too that I have read all the books that I could possibly get, and a <HI>great, great</HI> many they have been, more, two to one, than our Valentine ever heard of in his born days,
<PB N="26" REF="034162_0372_0FFC6AFA352CDAA0"/>
and yet no <HI>desolate</HI> deceiving man, has ever come with his <HI>deceptionary</HI> tales for to <HI>traduce</HI> me. <HI>It may be,</HI> (as I am very sure I should find him out, and soon give him his own) that I should have no <HI>objections to hear</HI> what such a sad <HI>depopulating</HI> gallant might have to say for himself; but no matter for that—this is a <HI>secret;</HI> for my papa would never forgive me if he knew I had such a thought; but as I am resolved that I will not date this, any more than my last letter, and as I shall still sign by my <HI>fiction</HI> name, my papa, unless he had to do with the <HI>black art,</HI> will never find me out.</P>
<P>Do then, dear Mr. Gleaner, tell Miss Primrose and I, whether Mr. Melworth is to have Miss Clifford? Whether Margaretta and Serafina dress their waists as short as <HI>Mrs. Modish,</HI> (who positively assures both me and Miss Primrose, she makes, with her own hands, all their apparel) says they do? What the ladies think of <HI>naked elbows,</HI> and whether they have thrown aside <HI>their modesty pieces?</HI> An answer to these questions, will <HI>insurmountably</HI> oblige your ever loving, and truly <HI>obli∣gated</HI> servant to command,</P>

<P>I AM willing to believe, as you say, that your girl was absolutely disposed of, before you received my let∣ter, making known my designs in regard to her; and I can tell you, old Gentleman, it is well for you that I am—yes, Sir, <HI>it is well for you that I am</HI>—for I am connected with a set of high-blooded blades, every in∣dividual of whom, have all reasonable attachment to my person and my interest; and we are, moreover, bound to each other, by the most solemn engagements, to aid and abet each other, upon all occasions, and to render to every member of our invincible community all possible assistance; and 'fore gad, old Square Toes,

if you had not given unequivocal demonstration, that your Margaretta was absolutely and <HI>bona fide</HI> shackled, before you was apprized of the <HI>honour I intended her,</HI> we would have made nothing of <HI>tossing your Worship in a blanket,</HI> and of leaving you, after your aërial eleva∣tion, handsomely soused in the first horse-pond in our way. I give you this information for your future government; and, as I have a new proposal to make, I expect it will be properly influential. Do not deceive yourself, good Mr. Prig, with an idea, that the para∣doxical mysteries, in which you have contrived to wrap yourself about, will much longer avail you; for Dick Bluster, Tom Pompous, Ned Mettlesome, and the rest of us, are expert at finding out the secret haunts of you <HI>sly ones;</HI> and we are, moreover, whatever you may think of it, possessed of a <HI>clue to your castle, which will lead us directly upon the ground,</HI> and we are both able and willing to turn <HI>knight-errants, to storm enchant∣ed castles, fight magicians, and deliver all the distressed damsels, who may be sound within the territory of the United States.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you are forewarned, and if you are but fore∣armed, that is, if the weapons of your warfare are not carnal, but spiritual; if you enlist only under the banners of reason, we may adjust matters amicably enough. Serafina Clifford is a fine girl, by Jupiter—my intentions are honourable matrimony, and Miss Clifford is my object; for although her <HI>birth is not quite the thing,</HI> yet she is a good generous girl; and as she appears to be in possession of the <HI>ready,</HI> I very glad∣ly make a transfer of my <HI>penchant</HI> for her little meek sister to her fair self; and I expect she will not find much difficulty in substituting as her heir apparent, a gay, handsome young fellow, instead of the little chap of whom she has appeared so passionately fond—her husband will very naturally succeed to her <HI>affections,</HI> and all her other <HI>goods</HI> and <HI>chattels;</HI> and if she continues her fondness for the smiling brats, <HI>y'clepped the comforts of matrimony,</HI> I may possibly furnish her with a plen∣ty of them, while she, continuing to supply me with

the <HI>ready,</HI> we shall thus very handsomely reciprocate obligations.</P>
<P>But, in the mean time, as I have already been fool∣ish enough to inform you that my estate was a little embarrassed, and as her sage brother may not be over and above fond of the scrapes into which that miserly and despotic old curmudgeon, Poverty, is so ungen∣tlemanly as to lead the subjects of his ragged empire; he may probably think it becomes him to make a few pragmatical inquiries, and as I do not wish to be at odds with the brother of my spouse elect, you may in∣form Edward Hamilton, that I have a handsome estate in possession; it is true, it is encumbered with a few mortgages, but the <HI>ready,</HI> which I take it for granted the young lady has in her gift, will easily clear off all these, and we shall then be as handsome and as fashionable a pair, as any of the gay circles in or about town can produce. But Edward is a sober dog—Well, hang it, so am I—and all this I am able and willing to demonstrate at whatever moment, and in whatever place, you and brother Hamilton may appoint. Please to present my <HI>humble duty</HI> to Miss Clifford, and assure her, that I am now <HI>immoveably fixed</HI>—that I am the most <HI>enamoured</HI> and <HI>impassioned of her adorers;</HI> and that I will ever continue</P>

<SALUTE>GOOD MAN GLEANER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have at last got the weather-gage of us; for you have contrived for to <HI>steer the little tight yawl</HI> Mar∣garetta, into <HI>safe moorings;</HI> while we, d'ye see, the worse luck ours, are at the <HI>mercy of wind and tide.</HI> You have proved yourself, Mr. Gleaner, an able and experienced <HI>helmsman:</HI> Many a time have I sweat for you, taking it for certain, that you would <HI>run a-shore upon the sands, or split upon the rocks,</HI> which, during <HI>one whole glass,</HI> seemed to <HI>loom</HI> for your destruction; but, howsomever, you have <HI>worked your traverse</HI> well, and have, in a wonderful manner, understood <HI>to a lee, star∣board, port, bear up, or right the helm, just as the wind has chopped about.</HI> But, mayhap, you would not have been so well off, had not your <HI>ship-mate</HI> have kept so good a look out <HI>alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI> There is nothing like mounting the <HI>top-gallant-mast,</HI> when the <HI>breakers are a-head.</HI></P>
<P>Lord, Lord!—if I had but been suffered to take the <HI>command of my own ship</HI>—but not a <HI>rope have I veer∣ed out,</HI> without orders first had and obtained from <HI>lub∣bers</HI> who never yet understood <HI>plain sailing,</HI> and who are, over and above, forever <HI>fishing in troubled waters.</HI> A thousand and a thousand times have I told Deborah Seafort what her <HI>yaws</HI> and her <HI>veerings</HI> would bring her to; and, sure as St. Peter's at Rome, she hath now run <HI>fast a-ground</HI> upon a <HI>lee shore,</HI> and here we must remain, <HI>wearing</HI> our <HI>sides,</HI> and <HI>beating,</HI> mayhap, against the <HI>rocks,</HI> if you, Sir, who seem to know ev∣ery <HI>rope in the ship,</HI> do not <HI>lend a hand</HI> to help us off. You must know, that when, by the orders of our <HI>self-created</HI> captain, Deborah Seafort, we <HI>crowded every sail</HI> for the land of matrimony, as we had a <HI>gallant ship</HI> under foot, we foolishly enough hung out ever so ma∣ny streamers; and, not having taken on board a suf∣ficient quantity of ballast, we shipped, in lieu thereof, such a cargo of <HI>self-conceit, affectation, prim-osity,</HI> and
<PB N="30" REF="034162_0376_0FFC6AEFA6668160"/>
other femalities, as rendered us so <HI>crank,</HI> that we were many a time within <HI>an ame's-ace</HI> of oversetting.</P>
<P>But, mayhap, Mr. Gleaner, if you have never ploughed the ocean, you may not understand these sea terms; and so, <HI>d'ye see,</HI> I will endeavour <HI>for to let my∣self down</HI> as much as possible. Why, you must know, that our girl Molly—for may I receive the <HI>cat-o' nine-tail upon my beam timbers,</HI> in presence of the whole ship's crew, if I ever call her Mary, or Maria, again.—I say, Mr. Gleaner, our girl Molly, being a good tight little hussy, and, withal, handsomely <HI>built, rigged,</HI> and, though I say it that should not say it, <HI>properly sound,</HI> was judged a fit match for any <HI>sea-boat</HI> whatever. I did not, as I have hinted above, like her manner of sailing, or the way which she made. Frequently has she flung out <HI>false colours,</HI> and after bringing to her lure many a <HI>gallant sail,</HI> she has <HI>up jibb,</HI> and borne away, quite in another direction. This I have pro∣nounced dastardly, and have thought fit to enter my protest; but I have been charged with fomenting a mutiny, and <HI>belayed</HI> fast in the cabin, or the ship's hold, as a meddling, dangerous and officious fellow. You will understand, that I speak by way of metaphor, simile, or the like of that. It is in vain that I have, upon these occasions, run over a whole catalogue of sea oaths, that has frightened many a Jack Tar into obedience. The women, as they say, have got harden∣ed to them, and they do not value them a <HI>rope's end!</HI> Deborah was above consulting her compass, and I have looked every moment when we should <HI>split to pieces.</HI> At length they have sprung a mast, and, entirely igno∣rant of their <HI>chart,</HI> and not knowing which way to <HI>wear the ship,</HI> and being brought to their wit's end, they have condescended to place me at <HI>the helm.</HI> But, Mr. Gleaner, this being a kind of navigation at which I am not expert, I am much in the same situation of your land-lubbers, who find themselves at sea in a storm; and I am, as it were, obliged to bend my course to the <HI>harbour of your experience:</HI> You have erected a <HI>beacon,</HI> and if you can but <HI>warp us out</HI> of the present
<PB N="31" REF="034162_0377_0FFC6AEE232F2808"/>
difficult strait, in which we are <HI>becalmed,</HI> you shall be our <HI>land mark</HI> in future.</P>
<P>It goes to the heart of me, Mr. Gleaner, to see our Molly opening the sluices of her eye-pumps, and pour∣ing forth such a torrent of salt-water sorrow. You must know, Sir, that after she had kept <HI>at bay ever so many pickeroons,</HI> she was at last brought to, by a smart, well-built <HI>brigantine,</HI> who seemed to understand every point of the compass, who was wonderfully <HI>trim,</HI> and fur∣bished out to the best advantage. Molly, knowing how to calculate her own force, would not immediate∣ly <HI>strike,</HI> and, to say truth, our spark rather played <HI>fast</HI> and <HI>loose,</HI> as the saying is—not choosing to come to an open parley. Howsomever, he contrived, <HI>d'ye see,</HI> to be constantly in <HI>the girl's wake;</HI> if ever she hoisted sail, he was sure to follow, and like the old Roman Mark Anthony, who we read of at school—who, by the bye, was as little of a <HI>sailor</HI> as a <HI>soldier</HI>—he seemed to think the <HI>world well lost for our Cleopatra.</HI> Well, but after Molly had stood out <HI>many glasses,</HI> Deborah, who is as <HI>yare</HI> as any old sea-boat need to be, having the watch, and having, as she said, thoroughly overhauled the <HI>lifts</HI> and the <HI>braces, the clew-lines</HI> and she <HI>buntlines;</HI> hav∣ing <HI>top't her yards,</HI> and d'ye see, got every thing in read∣iness, thought proper to heave out a <HI>white flag,</HI> by way of concluding upon terms of capitulation. But no sooner had we begun to <HI>veer</HI> out our <HI>fasts.</HI> than, zounds, Mr. Gleaner—for, d'ye see, it is enough to make the best minister in the United States swear—if the cow∣ardly, rascally pickeroon, did not <HI>slip his cable,</HI> and sheer off, when, hoisting every sail, he was nearly out of sight before we knew he had <HI>weighed anchor.</HI> We immediately called a council, when, according to our <HI>reckoning,</HI> the ship had sailed too many <HI>knots</HI> for a pur∣suit; and, moreover, our fair weather spark had so <HI>managed</HI> his <HI>tack,</HI> as to put it out of our power to <HI>libel the ship;</HI> and, over and above all this, it is deemed con∣trary to all rule, to <HI>give chace</HI> in this kind of navi∣gation.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="034162_0378_0FFC6AECA0ED36E8"/>
Well, here then we are—and faith and troth, all in the dumps—Deborah is constantly <HI>snivelling</HI>—I can scarcely keep above water; and poor Molly, like a dis∣abled weather-beaten yacht, is laid up. For forty years did I follow the sea—ay, and many a tough gale have I been in; but, <HI>split my timbers,</HI> if I ever knew what trouble was until now. Possibly, Mr. Gleaner, as you have already shown yourself wonderfully skil∣ful at <HI>refitting,</HI> you may be able to <HI>splice us</HI> together once more, and then, with both <HI>wind</HI> and <HI>tide</HI> in our favour, mayhap we may yet bear a good sail, and after all these storms and tempests, arrive safe at the desired port. But, Mr. Gleaner, by my soul, you must <HI>bear a hand,</HI> for our poor <HI>wave-broken invalid is almost a wreck,</HI> and she will be speedily <HI>past repairing.</HI> I am, Sir, un∣til death, your sorrowful friend,</P>

<SALUTE>WORTHY SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is just two years and four months, this day, since I had the presumption to address you before. I have seen with pleasure the gradual progress of your Margaretta; she seems to possess every sexual virtue, while her attainments render her in every view supe∣rior. A superstructure so rare, however excellent the materials, could not have been accomplished without the superintendence of uncommon abilities. The lot of the lovely orphan has been highly distinguished; and may she, as far as humanity will permit, be happily exempted from every future evil.</P>
<P>Yesterday my girl completed her twelfth year, and while every moment grows more and more interesting, my mind is struggling under the pressure of a thousand anxieties. Sophia Aimwell—tears stream from my eyes while I make the confession—is not exactly what I could wish! It is true her gentle bosom harbours no
<PB N="33" REF="034162_0379_0FFC6AE8BAFE0918"/>
particularly alarming propensities, and, that nature has endowed her with a good understanding, is also evi∣dent; but notwithstanding the variety of expedients to which I have had recourse, I have never yet been able to impress upon her mind, the necessity of <HI>appli∣cation.</HI> She seems unalterably opposed to <HI>uniformity;</HI> nor doth she ever, by her own choice, pursue either her book, her needle, or her pen, or even those lighter matters to which her attention is required, with the <HI>regularity</HI> which is, I have conceived, absolutely <HI>essen∣tial</HI> to any <HI>considerable proficiency.</HI> My wish has been to produce her in society an accomplished female; but, alas! the execution of our plans remain not with us. Sophia is particularly averse to reading and writing; novels have not yet come under her observation. I have thought it too early to entrust those fascinating volumes to her inspection. It appears, Sir, that you do not altogether approve of novels, although, sub∣mitting to the imposition of necessity, you have put them into the hand of your daughter. Pray, Sir, did you not exercise discrimination in this respect, or was Miss Melworth indulged with the free use of those books? Is it not possible to <HI>create, by habit,</HI> a taste for reading, where, unhappily, it is not inherent?</P>
<P>If it is consistent with your plans, you would do me a particular favour, if you would furnish me with cop∣ies of a few of those letters, just by way of specimen, which passed between Mrs. Vigillius, and her amiable charge, by the post that was established between their respective chambers; and, any hint of direction which you may condescend to favour me with, will be re∣ceived with much gratitude.</P>
<P>Sophia has never appeared so deeply interested in any thing, as in the story of your Margaretta; and a word from the Gleaner, will go farther than volumes written by any other pen. I am, worthy Sir, with high esteem, your constant reader, and sincere ad∣mirer,</P>

<Q><L>Joyless the man, who hails no bosom friend,</L>
<L>Whose steps no lovely woman waits to greet;</L>
<L>In his lorn self, whose pains and pleasures end,</L>
<L>Concentrated where all his wishes meet:</L>
<L>How comfortless his solitary home!</L>
<L>In cheerless gloom he wears life's hours away;</L>
<L>Around his board no smiling cherubs bloom,</L>
<L>Nor voice of pleasure wakes the opening day.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE picture which Mr. Plodder has given of his situation, is truly pitiable; and I am so far from regarding it as a <HI>caricature,</HI> that I am induced to be∣lieve its most prominent features will generally stand confessed, in the life of those, who live and die bach∣elors. I, however, once knew a happy exception to this conclusion, who, I confidently conclude, has now taken his station in a higher state of being. His de∣parture out of time was marked by the <HI>orphan</HI> and the <HI>widow,</HI> with the deepest regret—sighs and tears were a tribute which his virtues necessarily drew forth, and his memory is embalmed by the richest per∣fumes which gratitude can bestow. But the dwelling of this singular character was not a <HI>dreary solitude;</HI> it was <HI>irradiated</HI> by the <HI>smiles of infancy;</HI> and while the sons and daughters of penury, of every description, shared his bounty, the numerous offspring of a wid∣owed sister, with their truly amiable mother, who was endeared to him, as well by kindred virtues, as by consanguinity, graced his board, became unto him as the children of his youth, and not only threw into ac∣tion those paternal feelings which were inherent in his bosom, but furnished also an ample field for the exer∣cise
<PB N="35" REF="034162_0381_0FFC6AE4A6F144D0"/>
of those uncommon abilities, which were largely drawn out in the course of their education. All who knew John Parker, esquire—generally distinguished by the name of Sheriff Parker—of Portsmouth, in the State of New-Hampshire, will readily acknowledge, that the voice of panegyric can hardly swell too high a note, when sounding the praises of this great and good man, who lived and died a bachelor.</P>
<P>But it is true, nevertheless, that the life of a bachel∣or is almost invariably gloomy, or thinly strewed with rational pleasure. My friend Oswald may serve as an epitome of this class of men; he was bred a lawyer, and his youth passed in literary application; he either regarded <HI>la belle passion</HI> as below that dignity of character at which he aimed, or his moments of leisure were not sufficient to those attentions which its refinements require. Years rolled on, and succeeding seasons still found him busily engaged in scientific pur∣suits, until he attained the sober age of sixty, without having made a <HI>single attachment</HI> which could <HI>interest the heart,</HI> or forcibly engage the tender affections. The classics were enchanting; they still continued the fasci∣nating companions of his studious hours; and, although highly social by nature, his <HI>ruling</HI> propensities seem to have been, for a course of years, strangely <HI>over-ruled</HI>—but when once they were set afloat by reflection, he was roused to a melancholy view of his situation, and could not forbear regarding himself, in a very essential sense, <HI>alone in the universe.</HI> The guides of his youth, those persons whom he had been accustomed to revere, were mostly removed out of time, and the companions of his juvenile years were, to a man, "<HI>doubled in wed∣lock and multiplied in children.</HI>" Oswald was solicited to pass a month at the villa of Myrtilus, who had been his class-mate; he obeyed the summons, and he found the mansion of his friend the seat of domestic happiness.</P>
<P>During a period of twenty-five years, the life of Myrtilus had been ameliorated by the sympathies, cor∣rected sentiments, endearing tenderness, and faithful attachment, of a lovely and elegant woman; a nume∣rous
<PB N="36" REF="034162_0382_0FFC6AE263BDE700"/>
and beautifully promising family of sons and daughters seemed to emulate each other in their filial attentions; eagerly they watched every turn in his countenance, and while their animated features were impressed by glowing and duteous affection, they de∣lighted to anticipate his wishes, and were on the wing to fulfil his commands. Thomson's family piece was strikingly exemplified; the union of Myrtilus and his charming wife was cemented by sacred love; the holy priest had witnessed their plighted faith; and, enriched by his pious benediction, their mutual tenderness con∣fessed the righteous sanction. "<HI>The world, its pomp, its pleasures and its nonsense,</HI>" were to them compara∣tively of small estimation; possessing in each other what∣ever they accounted transcendantly excellent, <Q><HI>some∣thing than beauty dearer, both in the mind, and mind illu∣mined face—truth, goodness, honour, harmony and love.</HI></Q> In natural succession their smiling <Q><HI>offspring rose around</HI></Q> transcripts of either parent—<Q><HI>by degrees those human blossoms blew, while each succeeding day, soft as it rolled, evinced some new charm, the father's lustre, and the mother's bloom</HI></Q>—the skilful hand of kind assidu∣ous care, had formed their opening minds; <Q><HI>to rear the tender thought, to teach the young idea how to shoot. To pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind—to breathe the enlivening spirit, and to fix the generous purpose in the glowing breast.</HI></Q> This had been, of these blest pa∣rents, the "<HI>delightful task.</HI>" Perhaps they would have found it difficult to embody, by language, the sensa∣tions of their enraptured bosoms, when, glancing round upon their little family, <Q><HI>Nothing struck their eye but sights of bliss—All various nature pressing on the heart: An elegant sufficiency, content, retirement, rural quiet, friendship, books. Ease and alternate labour, useful life, progressive virtue, and approving Heaven;</HI></Q> and perhaps, on such occasions, the tear of luxury which strayed adown their checks, was the most expressive testimony they could give of their ineffably exquisite feelings.</P>
<P>On the contemplative mind of Oswald nothing was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost—the past, the present, and the future, crowding
<PB N="37" REF="034162_0383_0FFC6AE0800EFFD8"/>
to his view, combined to furnish a most <HI>humiliating comparison;</HI> and spontaneously he exclaimed—<Q><HI>These are the matchless joys of virtuous love; and thus their moments fly. The seasons thus, as ceaseless round a jar∣ring world they roll, still find them happy; and consent∣ing Spring sheds her own rosy garland o'er their heads: Till evening comes at last, serene and mild; when, after the long vernal day of life, enamoured more, as more remembrance swells with many a proof of recollected love—together down they sink in social sleep; together freed, their gentle spirits fly to scenes where love and bliss im∣mortal reign.</HI></Q> What an enchanting view! how beautiful, and how highly finished! Did poet ever pen superior lines?</P>
<P>Our bachelor heaved a sigh—a contrast so glaring was forcibly felt. "No young props," said he, <Q>lift their green heads for my support; not an indi∣vidual of the rising generation is bound to me by the silken bands of attachment, and this is a consequence of the arrangements of nature and of justice; for no mode of reasoning will invest me with a title to the fervours of that mind, which I have not particularly contributed to form, and in whose flexile dawn I have not been solicitous to obtain an interest. No deserving female honours me with her distinguishing regards—no gentle bosom swells for me the sigh of affection. I have not sought to lay the foundation of happiness; and it is in vain that I look for the superstructure of enjoyment. I have lived in vain, alas! for me <HI>it is now too late to form advantageous connexions, or to enter into engagements which should be the growth of many ripening suns.</HI> When I expire, my name will be extinct, and all remembrance of me will cease from the earth!!</Q></P>
<P>Our comfortless old gentleman was perfectly right in his conclusions; and we would advise friend Plod∣der to take the hint—should any mercenary female, caught by the lure of that establishment in his gift, cast her lot with him, we are apprehensive his chance for happiness will be small. It is too late in life for
<PB N="38" REF="034162_0384_0FFC6ADED08AE8B8"/>
him to begin that career, which should at least com∣mence in the meridian of our days; and, besides, we think his motive for wishing to become a married man, is rather invidious. Revenge is rarely ever the parent of that tenderness, which is so indispensably requisite in a matrimonial connexion. We think he may have judged erroneously of his kindred; it will be strange if in a family so numerous he cannot find a worthy object; we advise him to make the experi∣ment, to cultivate those attachments which nature authorizes, and to resign, at this <HI>late period</HI> (for we have good and cogent reasons to believe him turned of <HI>sixty</HI> instead of <HI>fifty</HI>) all pretensions to wedlock.</P>
<P>But however Mr. Plodder may determine, it cannot affect Serafina. The name of Clifford is now absorb∣ed in that of Seymour; and the accomplished maiden, who wore it with transcendent honour, has added one more to the list of those matrons, who give dignity to, and bestow the brightest ornament upon humanity. I will own that some months have elapsed since the receipt of Mr. Plodder's letter; and, farther, that the marriage of Miss Clifford was not then solemnized; but as I was apprized of her engagements to a <HI>worthy</HI> man, and as neither his epistle, nor that of the facetious Mr. Bellamour, contained any thing which was considered of sufficient importance to <HI>stop proceedings,</HI> I did not think it absolutely necessary to derange my plans, by an earlier attention to their letters. Uninfluenced and undismayed by the threats of Mr. Bellamour, I might have contented myself with simply announcing the marriage of Miss Clifford; but feeling a degree of compassion for Mr. Plodder, and sincerely wishing ev∣ery man and woman judiciously disposed of in holy wedlock, before they have fully completed their thir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth year, I have produced a more copious exordium, than is perhaps necessary; and, as I know a <HI>wedding</HI> is a very grateful subject to most of <HI>my fair readers,</HI> I will, after briefly narrating a few preliminary articles, invite them to that of Miss Clifford.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="034162_0385_0FFC6AD864B621E0"/>
The reader will have the goodness to recollect the important advantages which Edward Hamilton re∣ceived, during his southern tour, from a friend, resi∣dent in the State of South-Carolina; he will remem∣ber also, the subsequent embarrassments of that friend, and that circumstances induced a belief that the state of bankruptcy, into which the generous Seymour was precipitated, if not <HI>procured,</HI> was at <HI>least accelerated</HI> by his efforts in favour of Edward Hamilton. Ingrati∣tude can never take root in a noble mind; it could therefore find no place, either in the bosom of Mr. Hamilton, or that of the father of his Margaretta.</P>
<P>The abilities of Mr. Melworth were, on this occasion, commensurate with his wishes; and, after devoting a few days to paternal claims, and making ample pro∣vision for the complete adjustment of Hamilton's af∣fairs, he hasted upon the broadly philanthropic wings of benevolence, to South-Carolina. His dignified mein, conspicuous merit, and letters of address, pro∣cured him a free access to the creditors of Mr. Sey∣mour; and, with that dispatch which evinced the thor∣ough accomptant, their several claims were examined, and a fund appropriated fully adequate to the reim∣bursement of every just debt, while the unfortunate debtor, unconscious of the steps taking in his favour, wore away his melancholy hours immured within the walls of a prison.</P>
<P>The misfortunes of Seymour were not the result of misconduct; if there was a fault in his arrangements, the <HI>principle</HI> which produced it, conferred thereon a lustre which gave it, both in <HI>appearance</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> the rich colouring of the most splendid virtue. It is im∣possible but he who suffers by his extensive benevolence, and his commiseration for the unhappy, must carry with him his <HI>credentials of superior worth</HI>—must exhibit unequivocal testimonies of the justice of his title to <HI>admiration.</HI> It is true that the injunction to be <HI>just</HI> before we are <HI>generous,</HI> is worthy of observation; but if I endow a fellow creature with the means of obtain∣ing a competency to-day, and to-morrow the ship in
<PB N="40" REF="034162_0386_0FFC6AD4F8E15338"/>
which was contained my remaining property, is, by a stroke of Providence, whelmed beneath the waves, I do not see that I am <HI>greatly censurable</HI> because I did not, in the dread of this evil, withhold the solace which it was <HI>yesterday in my power to give.</HI> Mr. Seymour was of that class of men who never shut their ears against a tale of woe, and by consequence he could not lay up to himself much treasure; and when his ships of mer∣chandize were either wrecked or captured, he had no means of satisfying those rapacious creditors, who, op∣erated upon by principles the reverse of those which actuated his bosom, pursued him with unrelenting se∣verity.</P>
<P>It was not until Mr. Melworth had procured a reg∣ular course of proceedings; until every thing was in train; legal documents obtained, and the formalities necessary to his liberation completely adjusted, that he waited upon Mr. Seymour in his confinement; and he introduced himself to the then, (in his own estimation) unfortunate man, by words to this effect:—</P>
<P>"My name, Sir, is Charles Melworth. I am no stranger to the feelings of the unhappy. I am perfect∣ly acquainted with the history of your rectitude, of your misfortunes, and of your generous munificence. But, Sir, you must not expect to contribute so nobly to the necessities of an Edward Hamilton, and to exercise toward that young man such unexampled forbearance with impunity: <HI>The day of retribution is at length ar∣rived; the son of Charles Melworth, the husband of his Margaretta, must not submit to unreturnable obligations. Here, Sir, is your discharge in full; you are, from this moment, exonerated from a pressure, which must have been truly irksome to a mind like your's; and you receive this exoneration as a debt, which is your incontrovertible due.</HI> At liberty to pursue your own wishes, you will, doubt∣less, be expeditious in departing from a place so little suited to your feelings and your character. <HI>But, ere you go, as we are now upon even ground, I request a lease of your good opinion, to be continued or forfeited, as I shall, in future, merit.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="034162_0387_0FFC6AD2513DDD38"/>
Melworth might have proceeded uninterruptedly to a much greater length; the understanding of Sey∣mour underwent a kind of temporary petrifaction; astonishment absorbed his every faculty. Melworth paused in vain, and it was not until he had taken a variety of methods to rouse him to attention, that he was capable of listening to a regular eclaircissement. But to sketch his feelings, when the liberating truth first opened upon him, were a fruitless attempt; as well might I delineate to mortal view a disembodied spirit, as give the form of language to those exquisite sensations which then pervaded the bosom of Sey∣mour; he however struggled not against the extricat∣ing hand of his nobly generous friend—his composi∣tion contained not a particle of <HI>false delicacy</HI>—he was conscious that a change of circumstances would have produced in him a similarity of exertions; and his unexpected enlargement, while it confounded his ene∣mies, restored to his numerous friends that peace which his misfortunes had chased from their bosoms.</P>
<P>His emancipation, giving him an opportunity of an accurate investigation, he discovered many frauds by which he had been grossly injured; these he expos∣ed, and debts to a considerable amount were recover∣ed, while the <HI>return</HI> of several cargoes, that had been <HI>detained by the British for adjudication,</HI> by putting him in possession of considerable property, once more un∣furled for him the golden wings of successful com∣merce! Again he floated buoyant upon the stream of prosperity; and the expanding buds of hope obtained in his bosom primeval vigour. Hardly had he com∣pleted his twenty-eighth year, ere he had witnessed all those vicissitudes which I have thus hastily sketched; and he may in truth be considered as an early profi∣cient in the school of adversity. That he embraced the first possible opportunity of visiting Hamilton-Place will not be doubted; and it will readily be conceived that his arrival there was expected by his friends with uncommon impatience. Seymour was not only an accomplished man, but he had performed the part of a
<PB N="42" REF="034162_0388_0FFC6AD0AE0C9AD0"/>
guardian angel to Edward; and both Margaretta and Serafina regarded the moment which was to introduce them to a character whose virtues were unequivocal, and to whom they were essentially indebted among the most distinguished of their lives. Margaretta ad∣vanced to meet the <HI>protector of her husband,</HI> with that chaste and elegant freedom which the dignified mat∣ron knows to assume, nor did she conceive she trans∣gressed any rule of propriety when her snowy hand was extended to his manly pressure, and her lovely cheek was modestly bent to his salute. Serafina ac∣quitted herself with more timidity—her manner was characteristic of virgin delicacy; and while Seymour pressed her hand to his lips, "<HI>a higher bloom</HI>" suffused her animated features; and she permitted those civilities to which as the sister of Hamilton she was entitled, with silent complacency: Admiration and tender grat∣itude were, however, evinced in her every gesture; and her expressive eye beamed those unequivocal tokens of welcome which her tongue refused to utter.</P>
<P>Edward ardently wished to reward the deserving Seymour, by some signal token of his grateful affec∣tion. He regarded the hand of his sister as an inesti∣mable prize—too rich, in his estimation, to be con∣signed to the possession of any but his friend; and Seymour, on his part, from the moment he beheld Miss Clifford, became the most impassioned of men. But Serafina, devoted to the family of her brother, had repeatedly declared her <HI>absolute</HI> and <HI>unalterable</HI> predilection for a single life. Seymour was privately advertized of this resolution, and <HI>its motive,</HI> by Ed∣ward and Margaretta; and thus obtaining a <HI>secret clue to her affections,</HI> he made his approaches with that address, which, in this age of <HI>finesse,</HI> seems to be a nec∣essary part of the character of a finished gentleman. Had he directly attacked the fortress, by the common methods of assailment, the possibility is, that, prepared for an event, an expectation of which might have been induced by a variety of circumstances, she would resolutely have maintained her ground; but, proceed∣ing
<PB N="43" REF="034162_0389_0FFC6ACF28708A00"/>
covertly to undermine, he slowly made his advan∣ces, until, gradually sapping the foundation of her re∣sistance, a coalition became an event in course. <HI>Ham∣ilton and his charming wife; the little gentleman, whom Serafina regarded as a prodigy, with the infant Margaret∣ta; these were the themes of panegyric, on which the enam∣oured designer copiously dwelt, during those interviews that were frequently extended far beyond the limits which would have answered the wishes of common amity.</HI> The hours passed unheeded by; they were sentimental and refin∣ed; the heart of Serafina was deeply impressed; she was conscious of her situation, and she secretly ex∣claimed—"<HI>Yes, these delicious moments, snatched with the man who hath thus imperceptibly interested my best affec∣tions, are productive of more highly zested pleasures, than I have ever yet experienced.</HI>"</P>
<P>Edward and Margaretta saw that their utmost wish∣es for their lovely sister was on the point of gratifica∣tion, and they felicitated themselves on the prospect of an establishment for Miss Clifford, that was every way commensurate with her beauty and rare qualifications. They were careful not to interrupt the progress of a union they had so much at heart. <HI>Apparently uncon∣scious</HI> of the growing importance of a friend, to whom they were so warmly attached, not a single observation escaped them; and thus was Serafina <HI>entrapped</HI> and <HI>captivated,</HI> before she had received the least suspicion of the combination formed against the singular resolu∣tion she had avowed.</P>
<P>Seymour is one of the most accomplished men I ever beheld; his person is uncommonly handsome, and wonderfully prepossessing; his manners are easy and dignified; his morals are unexceptionable; and, me∣liorated in the school of adversity, he unites, in him∣self, every requisite which can insure felicity to a con∣fiding female. To Serafina he every moment became of still more consequence, until, imaged upon her every thought, <HI>that hour was marked by frigid insipidity, that presented not the man of her heart</HI>—that witnessed not his indefatigable and tender assiduities.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="034162_0390_0FFC6ACCCE2E3BD8"/>
It was after his return from one of those little neces∣sary absences, which Serafina secretly lamented as real misfortunes, that, finding her alone, with his accus∣tomed freedom, he took a seat by her side; and, after relating a new instance of the benevolence of her broth∣er, he fixed his fine eyes tenderly upon her; the ready tear, at the recital of Edward's virtues, had strayed unbidden from its chrystal source, and was making its pearly way adown her lovely cheek, when, unable longer to resist his feelings, he took her not reluctant hand, and impressing upon i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>second kiss of love,</HI> he ardently exclaimed—"Ah! Madam, <HI>how happy is your brother! I love you, Miss Clifford—passionately love you—and every faculty of my soul does homage to your peerless perfections: Forgive, loveliest of women, the freedom of a declaration, which I can no longer withhold. Surely, the sister of Edward Hamilton may still preserve that enviable character, and yet condescend to wear the title of the tender friend of Seymour. Turn not, I beseech you, from my ar∣dent gaze—if I am reprehensible for devoting my every thought to you, thus, on my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended knees, sweet arbitress of my fate, I supplicate forgiveness—while, with the same breath, I solemnly protest, that an error so extatic, can nev∣er be relinquished, but with my life.</HI>"</P>
<P>Serafina, overcome by a declaration which she had long fervently wished, had averted her face for the purpose of regulating those tender emotions, that, ris∣ing in rebellion against their lovely mistress, crimsoned her face, and filled her eyes with the most delicious tears she had ever shed. Soon, however, resuming her native fortitude, she wiped from her checks those of∣ficious drops; and, smiling with more beauty than poets ever yet attributed to the dewy morn, with mild dig∣nity (having previously entreated the supplicating Sey∣mour to quit his humble posture) she thus responded: "You are, Sir, entitled to my utmost frankness—the confidence which you repose in me, invests you with this claim. I had formed a resolution to continue single: Penetrated by the virtues of my brother, and my not less amiable sister, I knew not that the universe
<PB N="45" REF="034162_0391_0FFC6AC947EB67A0"/>
produced similar excellence—But you, Sir, appear to me to possess a mind fraught with those perfections I have delighted to trace. To adhere to my plan, <HI>after conviction of the error which originated it,</HI> would draw upon me the accusation of obstinacy. True, I imag∣ined myself unalterably attached to it; but why should I blush to find—why hesitate to confess—<HI>that justice necessitates me to relinquish it</HI>—that I relinquish it to the virtues of a Seymour—and, that I can have no ra∣tional objection to binding, by yet added ties, merit so unequivocal to a family, to which I am, by affinity, gratitude, and inclination, unalienably attached? <HI>Ac∣cept, Sir, this attachment, as a pledge of that, which du∣ties, yet superior, will impress upon my bosom.</HI>"</P>
<P>Serafina ceased to speak—she trembled excessively; and, by a kind of involuntary motion, threw her hand∣kerchief over her glowing face—Seymour caught her hand in extasy—But it was not our design to finish this scene; and not a step further will we proceed therein.</P>
<P>The now affianced lovers received the congratula∣tions of their friends, with their accustomed dignity of character; no unnecessary delays were permitted; a few revolving weeks produced the bridal morn; Sey∣mour plighted his faith with Serafina at the altar. Mr. Melworth, with that delicacy and propriety, for which he is remarkable, officiated as the nuptial father of Miss Clifford, and the venerable Urbanus <HI>received, while bending angels registered, their vows.</HI> Serafina was a beautiful transcript of Margaretta; her dress was white muslin, wrought after the same elegant pattern of the robe, which had been worn upon a sim∣ilar occasion by her friend. But our party was not so select as that which had graced Margaretta's wedding-day. Some choice spirits attended the relations of Mr. Seymour, from South-Carolina; and they were resolved, as they said, to make a day of it. Their boisterous mirth, however, did not essentially impede the pleasure of the sentimentalist. Margaretta, aided
<PB N="46" REF="034162_0392_0FFC6AC648B9AC50"/>
by Mary, presided; and it is unnecessary to observe, that hilarity was chastised by delicacy. The evening was concluded by an elegant rural ball, and every arrange∣ment announced the ample fortune and capacious heart of the munificent Hamilton.</P>
<P>Mr. Seymour has erected a neat edifice in the neigh∣bourhood of Hamilton-Place; he has displayed much taste in his buildings and his gardens; but his elegant fancy has been no where so conspicuous as in a beau∣tiful grove, on which he has bestowed every embel∣lishment of art and nature; and his seat, principally discriminated by this enchanting spot, is best known by the name of Seymour-Grove.</P>
<P>Mr. Melworth too, has tried his talents at architec∣ture, and he has distinguished the paradisiacal retire∣ment which he has completed, by the appellation of the Cottage of Amity. Thither, when we would inhale pleasures of the purest and the highest kind, our re∣spective families collect; and if mortality is ever the abode of felicity, this mansion is, upon these occasions, its residence.</P>
<P>Serafina's attachment to the family of her brother, is, if possible, augmented since her marriage, and her regards are abundantly reciprocated.</P>
<P>Margaretta has introduced into being her third in∣fant, to whom she has given the combined names of Mary-Augusta. Serafina continues her predilection in favour of the little William; but Mary whispers me, that a few months will probably produce a new candi∣date for the affections of Mrs. Seymour, who will, doubtless, generalize, or render less marked, her at∣tachment to the children of her brother; and, in the mean time, she has perfect complacence in her matri∣monial connexion; she regards her husband as the first of men, and hesitates not to confess herself the happiest of women.</P>

<P>HONEST Captain Seafort is in possession of the full commiseration of our respective families. The Melworths, the Hamiltons, the Seymours, with Mary, and myself, swell for him the sigh of regret. We wish indeed he had taken the <HI>command of his own ship,</HI> and we would gladly lend our aid to furnish the <HI>hawser, which should warp the bark into smooth water.</HI></P>
<P>If we comprehend Captain Seafort, when he says—"<HI>frequently has she flung out false colours, and after bring∣ing to her lure many a gallant sail, she has up jibb, and borne away quite in another direction</HI>"—we cannot altogether acquit Miss Seafort. It is true, a weak, inconsistent, and irregular mode of conduct in the commerce be∣tween the sexes, from its <HI>supposed characteristic</HI> features, hath been hitherto tolerated, or has not excited that degree of contempt, and severity of reprehension, in the <HI>female,</HI> as in the <HI>male</HI> world. But in this enlight∣ened period, when the sex seem emerging from the clouds which have hitherto enveloped them, and the <HI>revolution of events is advancing that half of the human species, which hath hitherto been involved in the night of darkness, toward the irradiating sun of science,</HI> we had <HI>ho∣ped</HI> that women would have been contented to have resigned their charter for absurd and cruel trifling, and that a <HI>female coquette</HI> would have been held in as much detestation as a <HI>male.</HI> We allow, however,
<PB N="48" REF="034162_0394_0FFC6AC25B7C8B78"/>
that <HI>old habits</HI> are not easily relinquished; gradually the morning breaks, and we are willing to wait, until mid-day, for the meridian perfection of the sex.</P>
<P>For Miss Seafort, we hope she will call into exer∣cise the heroism of the female character. Upon the glassy stream of tranquillity, her own efforts must again produce her. It is surely a pity to yield a <HI>coxcomb such a triumph,</HI> as her continued inaction, and melan∣choly <HI>wearing away, upon the flats of apathy,</HI> would be∣stow. She will consider that by the "<HI>false colours she has hung out,</HI>" she has in some measure provoked the attack, that she is in one view <HI>the aggressor</HI>—that if she <HI>hath suffered,</HI> she hath also <HI>inflicted sufferings;</HI> and that although it is evident she hath not merited the neglect of him for whom she mourns, yet it is rare that re∣taliation is consigned to the individual hand of him, who was originally aggrieved: The past, we know, cannot be recalled, and we counsel Miss Seafort to view her accounts with the world as adjusted, the bal∣ance struck, and her arrearage fully paid. We rec∣ommend it to her to <HI>begin her traverse anew, to place her worthy father at the helm, and to hoist every sail, and keep a steady course, until she once more makes the harbour of rectitude.</HI></P>
<P>It may be an alleviation of her misfortunes, to con∣sider, that the silly fellow, who, without suffering his words to invest her with a legal claim upon him, has barely amused himself with her easy credulity, would, had it suited his convenience to conclude with her a matrimonial bargain, have become either <HI>neglectful</HI> or <HI>domineering;</HI> the character of an idle, unprincipled, and dissipated young fellow, is not <HI>necessarily</HI> ameliora∣ted by marriage; and a <HI>virtuous woman has no resource but her tears.</HI> Miss Seafort cannot <HI>esteem</HI> her "<HI>fair weather spark.</HI>" His conduct is not calculated to give a favourable impression of his mind. Let her remem∣ber that <HI>love, not grounded upon,</HI> nor <HI>invigorated by esteem,</HI> is more evanescent than the structures reared by the aërial illusions of fancy. The life of a woman of <HI>senti∣ment</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> wedded to a man she cannot <HI>esteem,</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="034162_0395_0FFC6ABEF36B5098"/>
is a constant warfare. <HI>Alas! that the welfare of society, and the laws of our country, admit no remedy for so com∣mon an evil!</HI></P>
<P>A man, thus circumstanced, it is notorious, is in possession of various means of dissipating his chagrin, and of eluding the shafts of disappointment—but a woman, (such are the laws which <HI>propriety enact</HI>) must waste her life in <HI>silence,</HI> and in <HI>solitude.</HI> Miss Seafort may be assured, that first attachments are <HI>frequently ill-judged;</HI> that <HI>they are not indelible;</HI> and that a <HI>woman</HI> of <HI>spirit,</HI> if she commits the <HI>conflict to resolution,</HI> will assur∣edly entitle herself to the honorary wreath of victory. <HI>The homage paid to first love is a pernicious idolatry.</HI> The sentiments entertained of the <HI>durability</HI> of <HI>la belle pas∣sion,</HI> have <HI>usurped</HI> a prevalence, which hath consigned the hours of many an amiable female to unavailing regret. I contend that <HI>love, in a good mind, will assur∣edly expire, if not nurtured by esteem;</HI> nay, further, <HI>I as∣sert that it is in fact a short lived passion,</HI> that its dissolu∣tion is unavoidable, its own intense ardours naturally procure its destruction; and <HI>meliorating esteem is the Phenix which ascends from its ashes.</HI></P>
<P>How deplorable is the situation of that wedded pair, who are not endowed with the requisites to insure mu∣tual esteem; their conduct is necessarily under the daily observation of each other, and to the penetrating eye of keen and momently investigation their minds are frequently unveiled. How careful then should the sexes be to endow themselves with those intellectual qualities, which will procure mutual confidence and mutual complacency. Let Miss Seafort cultivate the worthy propensities of her nature; let her either con∣tinue single, or wed a man of a sound understanding and cultivated mind, of pleasing manners and <HI>mild integrity,</HI> and I hazard my reputation on the trial. I pronounce positively, that her situation will be <HI>much more eligible,</HI> than if she had given her hand to the fop who now probably derides the aggravated anguish he hath originated.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="034162_0396_0FFC6ABB42EB6020"/>
I will confess, that my resentment is forcibly exci∣ted against an idea which hath committed such devas∣tation on the peace of society. I am determined that my children, the little Margaretta, and Mary-Augus∣ta, shall receive timely impressions of the impotency of that <HI>chimera,</HI> endowed by imagination, with in∣vincibility; and they shall be early taught, that dis∣cretion ought never to quit the helm of a female mind; that <HI>reason</HI> is ordained to triumph over every <HI>weak idea.</HI> In one word, <HI>we will help them to attain the government of their passions.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Lavinia is a melancholy instance of the fa∣tal consequence of an unlimited indulgence of those sen∣sibilities, which, under the requisite control, frequently make the felicity, and are always the ornament of humanity. She possessed a heart, glowing with every sentiment which is dictated by benevolence; she was eminently capable of friendship; disdaining suspicion, her confidence in the <HI>appearances</HI> of virtue was exactly what it should have been in long tried worth, and her susceptibility was extreme. Born to an opulent for∣tune, she had multiplied opportunities of gratifying the propensities of a munificent mind, and she was re∣garded by the sons and daughters of penury as the angel of consolation. She had lost her father in her in∣fancy, and she continued the only prop of an amiable mother, of whom she was the richest solace; she was beautiful in her person, of a pleasing understanding, and highly accomplished; her manners were a transcript of her mind, open and undesigning; and a man of feel∣ing would have suffered death, rather than have pur∣loined the tranquillity of a bosom so exquisitely at∣tuned, or betrayed the confidence reposed in him by such transcendent excellence. I think I have never seen a more amiable female than Lavinia; I recollect attending Mary and Margaretta, on a visit made to her and her worthy mother. Margaretta was then a child—she had been with us only one month; but young as she was, the prepossessing Lavinia captivated her little heart. A large party was assembled, La∣vinia
<PB N="51" REF="034162_0397_0FFC6AB9BA9446E0"/>
extorted general admiration; her <HI>equal attentions</HI> to her numerous guests, the elegance of her move∣ments, her solicitude to contribute to the pleasures of every individual, her duteous attention to her mother, the eagerness with which she hastened to divest her of every care, while the eyes of her enraptured parent followed her with an expression of extacy, which I have seldom seen equalled, and never surpassed; all this was calculated to produce the highest degree of approbation, and she necessarily received the hom∣age of every eye. At our request, she played and sung, and her execution gave general satisfaction; dancing constituted a part of our entertainment, and the movements of Lavinia were attuned by harmony. Every heart congratulated the mother of such a daughter; and we became assured that Emly-House was indeed the abode of felicity.</P>
<P>From this sketch it will be imagined that the edu∣cation of Lavinia had not been neglected; and indeed, the truth is, that her anxious and tenderly interested mother had spared, in the cultivation of her mind, neither pains nor expense; nor was there any defi∣ciency, except in those <HI>cautionary guards</HI> with which young people should invariably be furnished, particu∣larly when their sensibilities are manifestly glowing, and their brilliant imaginations are sketching scenes, which, alas! the present lapsed state of humanity will never give them to realize. To throw a restraint up∣on the confiding innocence, the fine feelings, and gen∣erous propensities of the opening mind—<HI>to plant the germ of suspicion</HI> in that soil which hath hitherto pro∣duced only a growth of the most sweet scented flowers, is an act which seems to wear an invidious aspect, and it is undoubtedly a painful effort; yet, such is the imbecility of our nature, and such, in many instances, its depravity, as to render it the duty of every pre∣ceptor, to endeavour as early as prudence will permit, or reason can digest the information, to give his pupils an accurate view of "<HI>man as he is.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="034162_0398_0FFC6AB831F94620"/>
It will not be doubted that the personal charms, fine accomplishments, and <HI>independent fortune</HI> of La∣vinia, produced many candidates for her favour. In fact, she was surrounded by a little army of admirers; but although her heart refused to surrender to any of those passionate declarations, which assailed her ear, (and she invariably received every one who distinguish∣ed her by his regard, with that ingenuous frankness, which, upon these occasions, always marks the conduct of an amiable woman) they still persisted in their so∣licitations, affirming that her avowed preference of an individual should alone constitute a period to their pursuit. Among the acquaintance of Lavinia, figured conspicuously an accomplished youth, for whom her gentle bosom had long sighed. All her secret wishes were breathed for Alphonso, but Alphonso had never taken rank among the number of her declared ad∣mirers. This, however, was, by the enamoured La∣vinia, imputed to an <HI>excess of del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y;</HI> and often did she whisper a selection from a favourite ballad:—"<HI>Among the rest young Edwin bow'd, but never talk'd of love.</HI>" Mean time, every day, and almost every hour, gave new energy to the assiduities of Alphonso; and no opportunity passed unmarked by his distinguishing attentions. In those rural walks, in which it was the custom of Lavinia to accompany her juvenile compan∣ions, Alphonso was still by her side; for her the ripen∣ed berry was culled, the elegantly fancied bouquet was presented with a modest and impressive air, and, to encircle her auburn tresses, he enwreathed a garland of the choicest flowers.</P>
<P>He was careful to procure for her every new pub∣lication, and he would pass whole days in reading to her those volumes which he judged worthy her atten∣tion; <HI>every impassioned sentence</HI> he would render still more glowing, never forgetting, by <HI>emphasis</HI> and <HI>gesture,</HI> to point to the <HI>heart</HI> of Lavinia each moving senti∣ment. Often did he fix his eyes, <HI>apparently beaming with love, on her glowing face; on these occasions he would assume a tender air, sigh deeply, place his spread hands upon
<PB N="53" REF="034162_0399_0FFC6AB69508DF58"/>
his heart, anon clasp them in a kind of enthusiastic rap∣ture; and rarely ever did he conclude this well acted farce without a tear, which he affected to conceal, and which the too credulous Lavinia never failed to impute to delicacy, strength of affection, and unexampled respect.</HI> He was inva∣riably her conductor to places of public resort; and he seemed to regard every gentleman who offered himself by way of escort, as an invader of his prerogative.</P>
<P>Thus rolled on the halcyon months. Lavinia's at∣tachment every hour augmented; all her sensibilities were in full force; her unbounded confidence was en∣gaged, and her highest complacency ensured. Of du∣plicity she had formed but a vague idea; she had heard, it is true, of the existence of a propensity which she esteemed <HI>monstrous,</HI> and it ranked in her mind, with the stories of giants and hobgoblins, which she had received from her nurse, in her days of childhood. To have imputed nefarious purposes to Alphonso, she would have regarded as a most cruel outrage against the brightest assemblage of virtues, which ever irradiated a human bosom; <HI>and to restrain the expansive flights of an ardent and luxuriant fancy, she had never been taught.</HI> She esteemed—she loved—and at the shrine of tender friendship, she offered the most impassioned vows. The numerous friends of Alphonso and La∣vinia, gave them to each other; the world announced their marriage as an event which would speedily take place; her professed admirers, conceiving she had made her election, decently withdrew their pretensions, avowing a manly resolution, to act, in future, "<HI>a brother's part.</HI>" Alphonso continued to evince himself in every action, and in every arrangement, the most <HI>impassioned of lovers;</HI> and yet, strange to tell, his tongue had never uttered a <HI>single sentence,</HI> which announced what <HI>his eyes were continually proclaiming;</HI> which amounted to the simple declaration—<HI>I love you.</HI> The mother of Lavinia beheld with approbation the grow∣ing attachment of her beloved child—she regarded Alphonso as a man every way worthy of her daughter; and she anticipated a rich harvest of domestic felicity,
<PB N="54" REF="034162_0400_0FFC6AB421249E80"/>
when Lavinia, wedded, should augment her joys, and probably give to her embraces a blooming offspring, amid whose endearing caresses she should breathe her last maternal sigh.</P>
<P>At length, however, the wary matron could not for∣bear to question—"It is strange, my dear Lavinia, that Alphonso is not <HI>more explicit</HI>—you have received his attention with all that indulgent complacency, which is proper to a modest and a decent girl; he cannot doubt your approbation; what then can suspend his most unequivocal declarations? What delays his ap∣plication to your mother?" Lavinia <HI>blushed expressive∣ly;</HI> but it was not, however, a <HI>blush of conviction.</HI> The doubt, implied in the observations of her mother, she conceived derogatory to the <HI>immaculate honour of the man, whom she deemed incapable of error;</HI> and she had never before felt so much inclined to arraign the can∣dour, and even the justice, of her, who, from the first dawn of reason, she had regarded as a perfect model of every excellence. <Q>Alphonso, she replied, is the most <HI>delicate of men</HI>—of his ardent love I have had <HI>incon∣testible proofs</HI>—a thousand times has the most une∣quivocal declarations trembled upon his lips; but that <HI>uncommon respect</HI> which inmingles with his re∣gards, his tender <HI>awe of me,</HI> hath hitherto restrained the fervour of an avowal, which is <HI>but delayed.</HI> Ought I to regard as reprehensible a mode of conduct, manifestly the result of his <HI>consideration for my feelings?</HI> Alphonso, Madam, is not to be influenced by <HI>common principles;</HI> he is affectionate, amiable, and disinter∣ested; his passion is <HI>sentimental,</HI> precisely of that de∣scription which I wish; and so eligible is my present situation, indulged, as I am, with the presence and tender approbation of my dear mamma, and amply gratified by the full enjoyment of those pleasures, which I derive from contributing to the relief of the necessitous, that, provided the assiduities and tender friendship of Alphonso is allowed me, I cannot form a higher idea of earthly felicity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="034162_0401_0FFC6AB02DA8C050z`"/>
Thus was the matron silenced; and she the more readily acquiesced in the sentiments of her daughter, as her upright mind could not conceive of turpitude so <HI>enormous,</HI> as that which must excite a being, <HI>deliber∣ately to perpetrate the murder of the peace of a fellow creature, without a single apparent motive to stimulate to a deed of such atrocity.</HI> She also knew how to estimate the value of her daughter; she was conscious of her exquisite beauty, and rare accomplishments, and she was sensible that her fortune was amply sufficient to gratify the most ambitious views; an impartial decision would, she confidently imagined, pronounce her in every respect the equal of Alphonso, and she therefore gave to the winds her maternal anxieties.</P>
<P>In this train matters continued many weeks longer: Alphonso contrived to extend his treacherous entangle∣ments to the utmost possible duration. Perceiving, however, that he had at length attenuated the thread to the very point of breaking, he thought proper sud∣denly to decamp; and having made up his mind, he announced to the family, quite in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manner, his intention of taking a journey, mentioning it as a thing of course, and, quaintly enough, expressing his wishes that he might soon meet again, friends, whom he should <HI>ever value.</HI></P>
<P>The mother of Lavinia now saw clearly the fate of her beloved child; but she hesitated to make a discov∣ery, an apprehension of the consequence of which, fill∣ed her with immeasureable dread! while Lavinia still continued ingeniously reasoning away appearances. Alphonso was still the best, and most undesigning of men—she confidently expected his speedy return; nor did she experience any other regret, than what his ab∣sence occasioned, until many succeeding posts passed without bringing her a single line; then, indeed, her utmost tenderness and candour was put to the test, to invent apologies, or to account for a conduct so am∣biguous. Still, however, <HI>the particular days in which the post returned, might have slipped his memory; his letters might have been written; his servant might have delayed
<PB N="56" REF="034162_0402_0FFC6AADDCEB7140"/>
to put them in the office; the courier might have been un∣faithful.</HI> In short, struggling to detain the deluder hope, there was scarce an absurdity which she would not have admitted, rather than suppose that bosom, where she had treasured up her dearest expectations of earthly bliss, should have relinquished every good. Conviction, however, could not be delayed; it per∣force obtained; and when she learned that the beau∣tiful Monimia had become the object of his pursuit, she could no longer doubt.</P>
<P>She received the information with a steadiness and composure, which was more terrifying to her mother, than the most violent exclamation of grief. She shed no tears, nor uttered a single complaint; but, folding her snowy arms, with a look expressive of the deepest woe, and all the aggravated anguish of a broken spirit, she meekly bent her head in token of resignation; and while evidently assaying to arm herself with fortitude, overpow∣ered by the magnitude of the struggle, she fainted in the arms of her agonized parent! On her return to life, she gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tokens of a deranged intellect; and the disorder of her mind hath hitherto baffled the power of art. For a time, her lucid intervals cherished the hope of a perfect restoration; but her sensibility was extreme; and, <HI>unaccustomed to yield the control of the passions to the regency of reason, is it wonderful that, upon an occasion so cruelly calamitous, she became unequal to the combat?</HI></P>
<P>Let the Monimia's of the female world beware, however meritorious they may be—they do not, they cannot surpass the amiable, the highly accomplished Lavinia; and an Alphonso who could meditate the destruction of a happiness so well founded, as was that of the now desolate sufferer, is abandoned enough to harbour the most atrocious purposes.</P>
<P>The glimmerings of reason which Lavinia discov∣ered, during the first weeks that succeeded her misfor∣tune, were transient, and more and more unfrequent; and the faint traces of recollection which she evinced, produced the most heart affecting melancholy that
<PB N="57" REF="034162_0403_0FFC6AAC44701BC0"/>
can be imagined. She is now a confirmed maniac; and so total is her derangement, that some months have elapsed since she has manifested the smallest atten∣tion even to her mother. She frequently holds long ideal dialogues with Alphonso, responding for him, and it is observable that she utters the answers which she shapes for him <HI>precisely in his tone of voice.</HI> Accord∣ing to the caprice of the time being, she alternately upbraids and soothes him; and she is, by turns, grave and gay. Now with floods of tears she weeps his exit, chanting at his supposed obsequies, the funeral dirge; and anon, in an extacy of joy, she felicitates herself on his restoration to virtue and to her; not a sentiment does she utter in her strongest paroxysms, but is chastised by delicacy, but is descriptive of the purity and benev∣olence of her soul. The scattered gems glitter with transcendent lustre upon the dark clouds in which she is enveloped; and it is hardly possible to conceive a more calamitous situation, than to be marked down the hourly witness of her plaintive sorrows. Yet this task is assigned to a fond, an aged, and a widowed mother. To other hands she refuseth to relinquish the care of her poor unfortunate! "No mercenary hireling" she exclaims, "shall inflict upon my gentle child, unnecessary sufferings. It is enough, that the blossoms of her youth have been thus untimely blight∣ed. It is the part of her mother to soothe, as far as circumstances will admit, her woe stricken spirit; and no earthly consideration shall induce me to yield my melancholy charge, or quit for a single hour my faultless mourner!" Every night her bed is prepared in the apartment of her daughter; and she takes no sustenance but what she receives in her presence. Alas! alas! what a heart piercing contrast is mo∣mently exhibited, to those scenes which she had con∣templated as unveiling to her declining life, when, in the full enjoyment of her complacent hours, the chil∣dren of her beloved daughter passed in vision before her.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="034162_0404_0FFC6AA9E1222998"/>
Lavinia, like another Maria, is suffered to wander over the grounds which make a part of her paternal inheritance. Her insanity being of the melancholy and pathetic kind, she is never boisterous or unruly; her mother, and her woman, are continually the com∣panions of her rambles; of these she takes no other no∣tice, than barely to petition, in the most supplicating tone of voice, for any article of which she happens to fancy herself in want: She is particularly fond of stray∣ing amid those walks to which Alphonso was attach∣ed; and every tree and shrub is addressed by her in the most pity moving strains!</P>
<P>When death shall deprive Lavinia of her guardian parent, the augmentation of her calamity will be in∣calculable. Nor can this event be far distant—accele∣rated by the sad catastrophe of her daughter's once luminous expectations, and by her hourly sufferings, it must soon take place. She will sink into the grave; a distant branch of her family will succeed to her in∣heritance, who, very probably, regarding the deranged Lavinia as an incumbrance to the accession which awaits him, will, by <HI>pretended necessary severity,</HI> hasten the demise, which it will be his interest to procure!!!</P>
<P>I visited Emly-House not long since—great God, how changed is the aspect of every object which presents! The servants, the apartments, the superb furniture, every thing seemed to partake the general gloom! In a remote chamber I beheld the aged mother—her head white as snow—on her bended knees, with suppli∣cating hands, and streaming eyes, she was conjuring her daughter to relinquish a purpose, which she had recently declared, of putting an end to an existence that (with greater manifestations of reason than she had demonstrated for a long period) she affirmed was no longer to be endured. I joined, <HI>with an assum∣ed authority,</HI> the entreaties of her mother, when, waving her hand, in a manner descriptive of inexpres∣sible anguish, she bowed her assent to our united re∣monstrances. Never did I behold loveliness so pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣trated; she is astonishingly emaciated—her pallid cheek
<PB N="59" REF="034162_0405_0FFC6AA67356E9F0"/>
is wan as death—the dimples which played around her enchanting mouth, are succeeded by the cavities of woe—no expression of gladness beams from her sky tinctured eye, a fixed melancholy is brooding there; the lines of her fine face are deeply sunk—a premature old age seems rapidly advancing; <HI>and her folded arms, (a posture she generally prefers)</HI> while they indicate re∣signation, proclaim her, also, in the same moment, irretrievably the child of unrelenting misfortune!!!!</P>
<P>Could Alphonso now behold her—even Alphonso would pity.</P>

<P>IT appears that the declaration of Miss Clifford's marriage, has answered only one part of the letter of my fair correspondent, Miss Monimia Castalio; and, as I make a point of paying the most minute at∣tention to the epistles addressed to me in my official capacity, before I commence my responses to the wor∣thy Mrs. Aimwell, I will briefly reply to the remain∣ing query contained in that address.</P>
<P>Let me see—Miss Monimia Castalio and Miss Prim∣rose wish to know, what the ladies Hamilton and Sey∣mour think of <HI>naked elbows;</HI> whether they have thrown aside their <HI>modesty pieces,</HI> and whether they dress their <HI>waists as short</HI> as <HI>Mrs. Modish</HI> says they do? Now, that I may give to my anxious inquirers every possible gratification, I shall answer their queries both <HI>generally</HI> and <HI>particularly:</HI> And,</P>
<P>First, <HI>generally.</HI> It is not true, that the ladies are in the habit of employing <HI>Mrs. Modish.</HI> It is notori∣ous,
<PB N="60" REF="034162_0406_0FFC6AA3A5C0E2F0"/>
that this <HI>sometimes</HI> excellent modeller, at <HI>all times pertinaciously</HI> insists upon her own whims, however ab∣surd and fantastical they may chance to be, and that she frequently precipitates her determined votaries in∣to the most ridiculous vagaries. Margaretta and Sera∣fina take a cursory view of her followers, and adopt only such regulations as are proper and becoming; they are never fond of extremes; and hence the sud∣den transitions of fashion cannot produce them <HI>outrée figures.</HI> If a particular colour is said to be the <HI>rage,</HI> and it does not happen to suit their complexions, they do not impose upon themselves the necessity of wear∣ing it; their ambition is, to display their fine features and persons to the best advantage, and this their pre∣dominant wish in dress is never prostrated to any in∣ferior consideration; they have no violent desire to be considered as the <HI>standards</HI> of mode, or to be exalt∣ed to the <HI>summit of taste;</HI> they have heard a favourite poet say, that
<Q><L>Beauty, when unadorn'd, is then adorn'd the most;</L></Q>
and, following the example of all other commentators, they contrive that the text should square exactly with <HI>their own ideas previously conceived;</HI> they produce it as an antidote to all extravagance in the materials or modification of their habiliments; discarding <HI>pomp,</HI> they adopt <HI>elegance,</HI> and generally appear as if attired by the Graces.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>particularly.</HI> I have never heard them give an opinion relative to <HI>naked elbows;</HI> but, since the request of Miss Monimia Castalio, I have accu∣rately observed their sleeves, or, to speak more tech∣nically, the dress of their arms, and with the assistance of my good Mary, I may perhaps present an intelligi∣ble view of this section of their garments. It seems they have never worn long sleeves, except when rid∣ing; and hence, it will rationally enough be conclud∣ed, they have no violent predilection for a long sleeve; but I will whisper in the ear of my fair readers, a truth to which they may not perhaps immediately recur—
<PB N="61" REF="034162_0407_0FFC6AA202C26FA8"/>
<HI>they have uncommonly fine arms:</HI> Their sleeve, then, de∣scending one quarter of an inch, more or less, below that well turned curvature <HI>y'clepped</HI> an elbow, there re∣ceives its graceful slope, the extreme edge being orna∣mented with muslin, slight gauze, blond, or Brussels, as may suit the quality of the gown, or the occasion on which it is to be worn. They have not thrown aside <HI>their veils of modesty</HI>—God forbid they ever should—but with regard to <HI>modesty pieces, so called,</HI> in all their varieties, or those parapets upon parapets, behind which breast-work the fair intrencher seems to challenge the attack—as a sub∣stitute for all these, their delicate muslin, simply edged with a border, varied agreeably to the elegance of their fancy, is drawn round the neck, and fastened with a knot of ribbon behind, over which the handkerchief receives a form somewhat conformable to the reigning taste. For their waists, as they never appeared like <HI>inverted cones, so their skirts have not yet obtained an addi∣tional half yard in length, for the purpose of usurping that part of the body where the blond tucker formerly obtained a station.</HI> If the ladies make up a new dress, they so far condescend to the then fashion, as not to render themselves conspicuous for their non-conformity; and I believe this piece of accommodation makes up the sum total of their compliance with the fashionable world.</P>
<P>Thus having adjusted, as I conceive, this <HI>important</HI> particular, I turn with pleasurable alacrity to the ma∣ternal epistle of the truly deserving Mrs. Aimwell. Tremblingly alive to every thing which can affect her beautiful charge, does not Mrs. Aimwell too readily admit those corroding apprehensions which undermine her peace? She confesseth that nature hath been liber∣al, and that the mind of her daughter is exempt from those adverse inclinations which too often, even in the bosom of childhood, become fearfully productive. Ought she not then to felicitate herself upon the happy disposition of her Sophia? I pronounce that patience and perseverance will perfect her wishes. Miss Aim∣well hath but recently attained her twelfth year. It is
<PB N="62" REF="034162_0408_0FFA654C1304CA28"/>
rather early to expect a love of uniformity, and a pur∣suit of regularity, <HI>as a matter of choice.</HI> The season of youth is happily marked by vivacity; and the playful candidates for more substantial good are filled with interesting wonder at every novel scene that comes un∣der their observation. They love to walk, set, or stand, precisely as an imagination which does not readily submit to the sober agency of reason, shall dic∣tate. The young lady in question at present, takes rank among this little eccentric class of beings; but under the judicious auspices of Mrs. Aimwell, she will eventually become that accomplished female, who will exhibit an exact transcript of the model already form∣ed in the mind of her excellent mother.</P>
<P>Yes, indeed, I do conceive that the hand of skilful cultivation may implant an ardent thirst for knowl∣edge; or, in other words, a love of reading in that mind of which it was not the original growth; nay, further, I affirm, upon the authority of experience, that the useful and fertile exotic will take as deep root, flourish as luxuriantly, and produce as plentiful a har∣vest, as in its native soil; and perhaps the conforma∣tion of this artificial taste, is one of the <HI>most eligible uses which can be made of novel reading.</HI> Curiosity in the minds of young people is generally if not always up∣on the wing; and I have regarded curiosity, combined with necessity, as the grand stamina of almost every improvement. Narrative, unencumbered with dry re∣flections, and adorned with all the flowers of fiction, possesses for the new plumed fancy a most fascinating charm; attention is arrested, every faculty of the soul is engaged, and the pages of the interesting and en∣tertaining novelist are almost devoured. Thus an at∣tachment to reading is formed, and this primary ob∣ject once obtained, in that paucity of those kind of writings, <HI>which the watchful parent will know how to create,</HI> the entertaining biographer will become an acceptable substitute; the transition to history will be in course; geography constitutes an essential part of history; and the annals of the heavenly bodies will ul∣timately
<PB N="63" REF="034162_0409_0FFC6A99F1126890"/>
be studied with avidity. Pope's Homer may originate a taste for poetry, even in the very soul of frigidity; and a perusal of the beautifully diversified and richly ornamented numbers of the Adventurer, induces a perigrination through every essay which has been written, from the days of their great primogeni∣tures, Steele and Addison, down to the simple num∣bers of the humble Gleaner. In this view, novels may be considered as rendering an important service to society; and I question whether there is not less risk in placing volumes of this kind in the hands of girls of <HI>ten or twelve years of age,</HI> than during that in∣teresting period which revolves from <HI>fifteen to twenty.</HI> The mind is instructed with much more facility, at an early age, than afterwards; and I have thought that many a complete letter writer has been produced from the school of the novelist; and hence, possibly, it is, that females have acquired so palpable a superiority over us, in this elegant and useful art. Novels, I think, may very properly and advantageously constitute the <HI>amusement</HI> of a girl from <HI>eight to fourteen years of age, provided always that she pursues her reading under the ju∣dicious direction of her guardian friend:</HI> By the time she hath completed her fourteenth year, (supposing the voice of well-judged and tender premonition has occasion∣ally sounded in her ears) I am mistaken if her under∣standing will not have made such progress, as to give her to rise from the table with proper ideas of the light∣ness of the repast; of the frivolity of those scenes to which she hath attended; of their insufficiency, as sources of that kind of information which is the off∣spring of truth, and of their inability to bestow <HI>real knowledge,</HI> or those substantial qualities that nerve the mind, and endow it with the fortitude so necessary in the career of life.</P>
<P>Under the requisite guidance, she will learn properly to appreciate the heroes and heroines of the novelist; repetition will create satiety, and she will have risen from the banquet before the consequences of her intox∣ication can materially injure her future life. She will
<PB N="64" REF="034162_0410_0FFC6A9869AC5D90"/>
have drank largely, it is true, but revolving hours will give her to recover from her inebriety, and happily those hours will intervene ere yet she is called to act the part assigned her; and she will have extracted every advan∣tage within the reach of possibility, from this line of reading, while the pernicious effects attributed thereto, can in no respect essentially hurt her.</P>
<P>When a torrent of novels bursts suddenly on a girl, who, bidding adieu to childhood, hath already entered a career, to her of such vast importance, the evils of which they may be productive are indeed incalculable! aided by a glowing imagination, she will take a deep interest in the fascinating enthusiasm they inspire; each gilded illusion will pass for a splendid reality; <HI>she will sigh to become the heroine of the drama; and, selecting her hero, it is possible she may be precipitated into irremediable evil, before she may have learned to make a just estimation of the glittering trifles, by which she is thus captivated.</HI> I say, therefore, I would confine novels to girls from eight to fourteen years of age; and I would then lay them by, for the amusement of those vacant hours, which, in advanced years, are frequently marked by a kind of <HI>ennui,</HI> the result, probably, of a separation from those companions, with whom we have filled the more busy scenes of life.</P>
<P>I grant that novels, under proper direction, might be made much more extensively subservient to the well being of society, than, <HI>with a very few exceptions,</HI> they have ever yet been. Was not <HI>love, unconquerable, unchanging, and omnipotent, their everlasting theme,</HI> they might abound with precepts and examples conducive to the best of purposes. This remark leads to the consideration of the question proposed by my anxious correspondent. <HI>In my toleration of novels, have I not exercised a discriminating power?</HI> Most assuredly I have. There is a class of novels, and of plays, which it ap∣pears to me should be burnt by the hands of the com∣mon executioner; and were it not that the <HI>good natured world</HI> generally takes part with the sufferer, I could
<PB N="65" REF="034162_0411_0FFC6A96E319EA88"/>
wish to see strong marks of public odium affixed upon the authors of those libidinous productions.</P>
<P>But it is as painful to dwell upon subjects of repre∣hension as it is pleasurable to hold the pen of pane∣gyric—let me hasten, therefore, to a selection which I have conceived indisputably worthy of preference; and, in the first grade of those writings, that take rank under the general description of novels, and that are entitled to the highest notes of eulogy, I have been accustomed to place the history of Clarissa Harlowe.</P>
<P>In my decided approbation of this admired pro∣duction, I have the satisfaction to reflect that I am not singular. My paternal grand-father, who was one of the most respectable characters of the era in which he lived, indulged, perhaps to excess, an invincible aver∣sion to novels. Yet, the Holy Bible and Clarissa Har∣lowe, were the books in which he accustomed his daughters to read alternately, during those hours in which he attended to them himself. The Rev. James Hervey, Rector of Weston Favell, in Northampton∣shire in England, celebrated as well for an exemplary life and purity of manners, as for the elegance and piety of his literary compositions, in a treatise written upon the education of daughters, recommends Clarissa, as a suitable present to those young ladies, who are to be trained in the paths of virtue and propriety; and a <HI>late writer,</HI> has asserted, that Clarissa Harlowe is the <HI>first human production now extant.</HI> He hesitates not to place it, for <HI>literary excellence, above the Iliad of Homer, or any other work, ancient or modern, the sacred oracles excepted.</HI></P>
<P>But without taking it upon me to defend this opin∣ion. I will only say, that it appears to me admirably well calculated as a useful companion for a female, from the first dawn of her reason, to the closing scene of life. It has been said that many a Lovelace has availed himself of plots, fabricated and developed in those volumes, which would never else have entered his imagination—be it so, I only contend for the placing them in female hands; and I affirm that they con∣tain
<PB N="66" REF="034162_0412_0FFC6A955C3154B8"/>
the best code of regulations, the best directions in every situation which they exemplify—in one word, the best model for the sex, that I have ever yet seen pourtrayed. The character of Clarissa, it has been as∣serted, is too highly wrought: but I ask, what perfec∣tion did she possess that we should be willing to dis∣pense with, in the female, who we should delineate as an accomplished woman! Was I to advance an objection against a work of such acknowledged merit, I would say that it is the character of Lovelace, and more par∣ticularly of the Sinclairs, the Martins, the Hortons, and the Harlowes, of those pages, which are <HI>too highly wrought.</HI> It is surely much more easy to conceive of an amiable woman, acting precisely as did Clarissa, than of that degree of turpitude and inexorable se∣verity, which must have preceded the perpetration of actions so black, and the manifestation of rigour so ill sounded and unrelenting.</P>
<P>It has been generally imagined that Clarissa's only deviation from strict propriety, consisted in her flight from the protection of her father; but a moment's re∣flection will evince the error of this conclusion—<HI>that cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a fault to which I am compelled.</HI> Clarissa met her betrayer with a design to remonstrate, and to con∣ciliate, but with a <HI>determined resolution not to abandon the paternal mansion;</HI> it appears that she was precipi∣tated upon that fatal step, and, environed by the deep laid machination of the deceiver, her escape would have been miraculous, yet she continued to struggle, and even at the moment she was hurried away, the beauteous sufferer still vehemently protested against accompanying the wretch, who was armed for her destruction. Clarissa's <HI>error</HI> (<HI>if indeed, all circumstances considered, she was ever in any sort reprehensible</HI>) must be traced further back; it consisted in her <HI>correspondence after the parental prohibition, and in her consenting to meet the treacherous villain.</HI> Yet, when we take a view of the <HI>motives</HI> which stimulated her to those decisive measures, we can scarcely deem her censurable; and
<PB N="67" REF="034162_0413_0FFC6A93A018B0A8"/>
she extorts from every bosom that kind of applause, which we spontaneously yield to persecuted merit.</P>
<P>Love, in the bosom of Clarissa, was always subservi∣ent to virtue. It would never have taken the lead of duty; and, had she been left to the free exercise of her fine faculties, had she been permitted to call into action those rare abilities of which she was mistress, she would have <HI>completely extricated herself from every embarrassment.</HI> Love, in the bosom of Clarissa, was the <HI>noblest of principles;</HI> it was uniformly solicitous for the <HI>genuine felicity, establishment and elevation of its object;</HI> but it would never have permitted her to have allied herself to a man, who could <HI>barbarously triumph in the destruction of that sweet peace of mind, which is the bosom friend of the innocent and of the good; who could inhuman∣ly meditate the ruin of those confiding females who were en∣titled to his pity and his protection.</HI> Liberated from the resentment of her hard hearted relations, and moving in that enlarged and elevated sphere, to which her matchless intellect and uncommon information en∣titled her, she would doubtless have investigated. The libertine would inevitably have stood confessed, and would as assuredly have been discarded from her fa∣vour. In one word, love, in the bosom of Clarissa, was what I wish, from my soul, it may become in the bosom of every female.</P>
<P>The deportment of Clarissa, after Lovelace had so artfully betrayed her into a step which her judgment invariably condemned, has been the subject of much cavilling; she is accused of undue haughtiness; but surely such censurers have not well weighed either her character and situation, or that ambiguous mode of conduct, which the despoiler so early assumed. How often did he <HI>hold her soul in suspense,</HI> and how necessary was it for his nefarious purposes thus to do.</P>
<P>But I am not now writing a criticism upon Clarissa; the foregoing hints will inform Mrs. Aimwell what class of novels I particularly approbate; and I proceed, agreeably to her request, to select a few of those let∣ters, which made a part of the correspondence be∣tween

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>NO courier ever produced a letter with an air of greater importance than did our boy Plato, when, ten moments since, he handed me yours. Indeed he seems much elated with his new office; and I freely own to you, my dear girl, that I am fond of giving pleasure even to Plato. When pleasure results from duty, as in the present instance, it can hardly be en∣joyed too luxuriantly. Those beings who are fre∣quently subjected to the caprice of the petty tyrants whom they serve, derive their existence from the same source with their masters and mistresses; their destina∣tion is also similar to ours; and, considering the natur∣al love of liberty which predominates more or less in every human bosom, and the pangs which must conse∣quently result from servitude, it is a duty incumbent upon us to render that state of subordination in which servants are providentially placed, as easy as possible. Reflection will suggest the policy of this conduct, con∣sidered in every view; and as the face of things is continually changing, and it is difficult to say what events time may produce—our fate may, in future, remain with him, who is to day under our direction: At any rate, if we would insure to ourselves a fund of pleasing reflections, we must treasure up those proper and becoming actions, which will alone stand the test of accurate investigation.</P>
<P>I thank you, my love, for your letter: It is a charm∣ing specimen of what I am to expect in future; and as you have so well profited by my premonitory address, I calculate upon your continued docility, and antici∣pate from this correspondence the most desirable con∣sequences.</P>
<P>You are captivated by the Count de Poland, by his generosity to his niece, by Olivia, and by the sprightly Lady Morpeth; and this is precisely what I expected from my Margaretta. The young mind embraces with
<PB N="69" REF="034162_0415_0FFC6A8C8AF9CC98"/>
extacy the most prominent excellence, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dearing ardour, delighteth to expatiate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>too</HI> am an admirer of the <HI>consistent</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Count de Poland; his <HI>fraternal virtues</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> bosom the most exquisite sensations of which it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ceptible; I mark, with pensive sympathy, his a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tion at the view and subsequent recollection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> faithful Ananette, with the <HI>poor bent six-pence in her closed hand;</HI> and, if there is a melancholy luxury in tears, my penetrated spirit partakes thereof, as I fol∣low him to the chamber of death, as I behold his emo∣tions at the emaciated appearance of his angel sister, and as he bedews the hand of the expiring saint with those testimonials of attachment which, doubtless, were most consolatory to her fleeting spirit!</P>
<P>His renewed and aggravated sorrow at the sight of the work-bag, the gift of blissful days—his emotions as the last offices were performing—the night passed in the chamber of the beatified Maria—the extreme anguish of his soul, as he perused the woe-fraught re∣cital, addressed to his <HI>still confided in affection,</HI> by the pen of his injured, his matchless sister—all this is beau∣tifully pathetic; and, when he folds to his throbbing bosom, the smiling legacy of departed excellence—when he commences the parent of the interesting lit∣tle orphan—when he vows, upon the clay-cold hand of her deceased mother, to fulfil every wish which her maternal heart (while yet it beat in its mortal tene∣ment) had expressed—when he recognizes this his sol∣emn vow, as registered in the awful presence of the Almighty, and calls upon his justice to deal with him according to the exactness with which he shall perform it!—when I trace him in the execution of the duties he had so naturally assumed—when I view him by the bed's side of the lovely slumberer, and mark with what fond complacency he contemplates the features of sleeping innocence—when I see him bending one knee on the floor, his face close to the heart-affecting cherub, and pressing her forehead with the caresses of manly affection—in every of these scenes, the corresponding
<PB N="70" REF="034162_0416_0FFC6A8B0479F348"/>
feelings of my sympathetic bosom are beyond expres∣sion. The description of the waking infant is highly finished: I behold, in idea, the long dark eye-lashes, suddenly contrasted by those mildly beaming splendors, which produced upon the paternal Count such enchant∣ing effects. In short, the whole of that animated page is truly charming; and I will confess to you, my dear, that it is with passages of this complexion, I am most pleased in the Count de Poland.</P>
<P>Ah! my Margaretta, I once had a brother!—ques∣tion me not relative to this brother. His fraternal bo∣som is now as insensate as the cold by which it is cov∣ered; his mind was the seat of every virtue. Had he lived—but I forbear—Let me not press upon the sweet bud of your opening youth, with those deeply surcharged sorrows, which a retrospect would occa∣sion—let me drop over them the impenetrable veil of silence!!!</P>
<P>With the maternal character of Mrs. Osmond, and with the discretion of Lady Edgerton, I am much pleased: But it is not the fault of novelists, to be nig∣gard of the virtues or the graces to those characters which they produce as objects of admiration. Hold∣ing the pen of distribution, it is easy for them to com∣mand an assemblage of every excellence; and these splendid habiliments, <HI>never impaired by use,</HI> will suit as well the hero or heroine of the present era, as those who figured centuries ago. <HI>The pecuniary fund of the novelist is also inexhaustible,</HI> and the liberality of those endowments, drawn therefrom, is only bounded by that sense of probability, which happens to exist in the mind of the munificent conferer of those aërial bestow∣ments. To say truth, my love, that particular, which seems least to have commanded your attention, in the Count de Poland, is precisely <HI>that which, in my opinion, constitutes its principal value;</HI> it is a trait rarely met with in works of this kind; but it is, nevertheless, sus∣ceptible of high improvement; and was it often dwelt on, exemplified, and richly coloured, it would proba∣bly produce, upon the mind of the youthful reader, the
<PB N="71" REF="034162_0417_0FFC6A865D679E50"/>
most beneficial effect. Are you at a loss to compre∣hend me? I will be more explicit. <HI>I mean the com∣plete triumph, which Lord Harenbrook and Lady Morpeth obtained over an inconsiderate attachment, that seemed vio∣lently to have tempested the mind of the enamoured swain, and to have made no inconsiderable impression upon the heart of the fashionable nymph.</HI> Her recovery from those paths of dissipation, into which she had been betrayed by a pernicious plan of education, is truly acceptable to the interested reader; and the <HI>grateful attachment,</HI> which, it is apparent, she ultimately conceives for Lord Mor∣peth, is a completion of her character.</P>
<P>Indeed, nothing can be imagined more absurd, than the endowing a hasty predilection, formed in <HI>childhood,</HI> or at best, in the days of <HI>inexperienced youth,</HI> with <HI>invin∣cibility!</HI> I do not say that such attachments are al∣ways improper: If they are approved of, after accu∣rate investigation, and crowned by the sanction of guardian friends, their permanency is desirable, and we ought studiously to cultivate every sentiment which can contribute to their establishment. But the <HI>election</HI> of the <HI>uninformed</HI> mind is seldom <HI>judicious,</HI> and the <HI>im∣mortality</HI> which we confer thereon, exists no where but in an over-heated imagination. <HI>A happy marriage</HI> is nothing else but the <HI>highest state of friendship,</HI> of which the sons and daughters of mortality are capable; and, in the choice of a companion for life, <HI>perfect esteem</HI> should point the election. If you discover either of the young ladies, to whom your gentle bosom is already so tenderly attached, to be unworthy of your regard, although she may still be followed by your anxious wishes for her restoration to virtue, yet you will no longer confer on her your <HI>confidence;</HI> and, was the same <HI>resolution</HI> in exercise, a discovery of the want of merit in the object, <HI>until then beloved,</HI> would as easily <HI>obliterate</HI> the attachment existing between the sexes, and we should shrink from the idea of embarking on the important voyage of life, without the rich cargo of esteem.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>The glowing ardour of the youthful mind,</L>
<L>By no admeasurement of years confin'd,</L>
<L>Dwells all extatic on the notes of praise;</L>
<L>In fervid hues each common act pourtrays:</L>
<L>And when, by gratitude and love impress'd,</L>
<L>The bosom's avenues are thus possess'd,</L>
<L>Bending obedient to the forming hand,</L>
<L>As Reason points, the faculties expand.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO arrest the warm affections of the youthful voyager, very little address is requisite. Easily susceptible of impressions, the opening mind generally estimates persons and things, with the benefits which accrue therefrom, agreeably to its own vivid imagina∣tion; and its calculations, accumulated by a productive fancy, highly o'ertop the judgment of reason. Grat∣itude, if not spontaneous, is implanted in the glowing bosom, almost without an effort; and <HI>affection, stamped by gratitude,</HI> is a substantial basis for the superstructure of education. To convince young people of our en∣tire attachment, and that all our views, and every ar∣rangement relative to them, are directed to their pres∣ent and future advancement, is <HI>indisputably</HI> of the greatest importance. Children will receive lessons with confidence and advantage, from the lips of those whose tender attachment they do not consider as prob∣lematical; and reciprocity of regards, between the teacher and the taught, is absolutely indispensable.</P>
<P>Happily, in the mind of Margaretta, an indelible conviction of our unalterable and disinterested attach∣ment was early produced; and a reciprocation of re∣gards, a decided preference, and even veneration, for our characters, with that calm reposing confidence,
<PB N="73" REF="034162_0419_0FFC6A81A5C9EF58"/>
which naturally results from affection so entire, and esteem which she conceived so well grounded, origin∣ated in her gentle bosom the warmest sensations, and ultimately procured the very best effect. Many of her letters are too expressive of the impassioned feelings of a fervid and enthusiastically grateful heart, to meet the public eye; and, as Mrs. Aimwell requires only a specimen, I am at liberty to suppress them; selecting others, as they may happen to occur, without attend∣ing to the order in which they were written. The fol∣lowing are, however, in course.</P>

<HEAD>To my honoured MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MAMMA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO not know that there is so happy a being in this world, as your little Margaretta. Your letters, best of friends, are more pleasing to me than I can find words to express. Alas! alas! who would have thought it?—When my aunt Arbuthnot used to weep over me, apprehending that she should leave her poor child quite friendless, she would sigh as if her heart would burst; and I, for my part, had no wish, but to go to sleep on the dear bosom of her, whom I supposed to be my mother, and never, never more to wake in a world, where I thought there was no one to cherish and to love the poor little creature, who was so soon to be deprived of her only friend! Were any one now to see the rich joyful Margaretta, as happy as the days are long, would it be possible to conceive her the same little destitute child, who shed so many tears in Mrs. Thrifty's house in Charleston? Dear me!—the <HI>big waves swallowed up my father!—my mother broke her poor heart!—and my aunt too, very soon followed to that better world, whence she can no more return, and ev∣ery body said, there was no one remained to take care of me!</HI>—But God has sent two blessed angels to take charge of me; and for this I will prostrate myself be∣fore him every morning and evening, and love and honour him all my days.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="034162_0420_0FFC6A801B539B00"/>
Well now, I think, if I should be a third time or∣phanaged, I should never again hold up my head! You know, mamma, <HI>you have taught me</HI> to make <HI>obser∣vations</HI> and <HI>comparisons;</HI> and so, standing in the bow window the other day, I could not help weeping at the fate of the plant, which we have so long cherished and watched with so much care. It was the last stormy day—and, although it had stood upright during the burning heat of summer, and the heavy rains of au∣tumn, yet, the torrent that burst upon it from the first wintry storm, stripped it of all its leaves, and levelled it with the earth, from which it has never since lifted its head. Just so, thought I, it would fare with thee, Margaretta; thou hast survived the loss of thy parents, and of thy second mother; but, if envious death should deprive thee of thy present guardian friends, thou must never think to look abroad again; thou must lie down with the prostrate plant, and all thy fine expectations will be trodden to the ground! Dear me! my tears fell like big drops of rain. You remember, my mam∣ma, that you had the goodness to wipe them away with your own handkerchief, that you kissed my cheek, and wished to know the cause of my sorrow. I could not then speak—but I determined to write you about it—they were partly tears of joy, and partly of sor∣row—of joy, for the present; and of sorrow, for what may happen; but your indulgent smiles soon left nothing in my little heart but joy and gladness. Cer∣tainly, as Mrs. Trueworth says, if I am not the best, I shall be the worst young body in all this world; and if I should ever be ungrateful to you or my papa, I shall deserve the displeasure of every good person.</P>
<P>Lady Morpeth's disrespect for her excellent parents surprised me very much; and although I was pleased with her fine qualities, yet, on account of this circum∣stance, it was some time before I could be reconciled to her character—But what a shocking woman was Lady Ann Fostess! <HI>Are there such ladies in England as Lady Ann Fostess?</HI> fie upon them, if there are! I am sure they are not worthy to be called ladies;
<PB N="75" REF="034162_0421_0FFC6A7D6C26BFE8"/>
and if they are, in reality, to be found in Old Eng∣land, how happy am I that I have escaped to this new world, where <HI>sincerity and kindness are created king and queer, and where all their subjects obey their laws.</HI> I wish, mamma, you had written me your sentiments of Lady Ann—I am sure you must detest her.</P>
<P>I trust I shall never have a friend whom you do not approve; and you speak the very heart and soul of your Margaretta, when you say, that if any of my associates were to addict themselves to those habits, which you and my dear papa have pointed out to me as reprehensible, I should immediately become desir∣ous of separating myself from them, however dear they might have been to me; and I do believe it is impossible I should continue to love those, whom you assure me are unworthy of my attention.</P>
<P>Miss Hayden has been diverting herself this hour past, with what she calls our <HI>funny</HI> correspondence; she rushed into my chamber, (you know she visits when and where she pleases, without ever thinking it neces∣sary to ask her mamma's permission) having found her way up the back stairs, just as I was preparing to write. She had not stopped to put on either hat or scarf, and her appearance was so wild, that it absolute∣ly frightened me! She says she believes it is the first time that ever people wrote to each other under the same roof, when they could talk together every hour if they pleased; and she would not be so silly, <HI>even though her mamma should require it!</HI> After this she wished to <HI>see your letter,</HI> but I refused to gratify her. I know she does not <HI>spell properly,</HI> and she reads very badly, with the very <HI>tone of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which you, mamma, dislike;</HI> and she pay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not the least regard even to a full stop! It is true, that she cares for nothing but running about from place to place. She was a <HI>whole month</HI> in making a shirt for her father, and it was <HI>ill made</HI> after all. They say she lays in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nine o'clock!</HI>—and I know that when any one tells her of her faults, she only laughs at them for their pains; and she says she is de∣termined to enjoy herself in her own way! Indeed,
<PB N="76" REF="034162_0422_0FFC6A79F091C6E0"/>
mamma, I was not sorry when she took her leave, and neither Miss Clifford nor myself would drop one tear, if she should never pay us another visit. She thinks herself handsome; but <HI>one of her eyes is plainly a darker blue than the other,</HI> and I am sure, therefore, she cannot be beautiful. I am glad, however, I did not show her my mamma's letter—the testimonies of the affection of so beloved a mother, are too valuable to be exposed to <HI>such eyes,</HI> by her ever grateful, ever duteous</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To MARGARETTA MELWORTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>necessity</HI> of uttering to my Margaretta the lan∣guage of censure, of penning the line of reprehension, will ever inflict upon my own bosom, pangs correspon∣dent with, if not superior to, those which she may, up∣on those occasions, experience. Contrary to my wonted custom, I deny myself the indulgence of responding to your last epistle in course. Your account of Miss Hay∣den is so <HI>foreign from your usual style,</HI> so unlike every trait I have hitherto observed in a mind, of which I had <HI>conceived I had obtained an intimate knowledge,</HI> and, altogether, so extraordinary, as to demand my first and undivided attention. Solicitous to preserve the tranquillity of your bosom, and to eradicate the very seeds of detraction, I am, by consequence, upon this subject, solemnly serious.</P>
<P>"Miss Hayden rushed into your chamber without hat or scarf." Well, my dear, she is quite in our vicin∣ity, and this was nothing more than a neighbourly mark of sociability; and if her mamma chooses to toler∣ate her excursions <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> her inclination leads her, without so far interesting herself, as to take the direction of her movements, I do not see that <HI>we</HI> are called upon to take upon us the invidious character of her censors. Her education is not committed to our charge, nor have <HI>I, much less you,</HI> any right, either to arraign or condemn.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="034162_0423_0FFC6A77386312E8"/>
I would have my girl regard the faults that may pass under her observation, as <HI>cautionary occurrences,</HI> that may direct her to avoid the rocks on which too many have split; but she must not be <HI>eager to detect, nor hasty to expose.</HI> If, from whatever motive, there has not been that plan in the education of Miss Hay∣den, without which, <HI>scarce any thing valuable can be achieved,</HI> is she not therefore invested with a claim to your kind commiseration? If the health and leisure of her mamma, had permitted her to bestow that atten∣tion, which is so absolutely requisite in the cultivation of the mind and manners, the probability is, that her orthography would have been as unexceptionable, her reading as elegant, and that she might have used her needle as expeditiously, as girls, who have been thus systematically taught, generally do. Early accustom∣ed properly to appreciate time, she would not then have slumbered away her hours in bed, but each re∣turning morning, as it gilded the eastern sky, would have witnessed the glad orisons of the lovely maiden, would have marked in its progress those habits of in∣dustry so proper, and so becoming, especially to the season of youth. I am not pleased with your refus∣ing to show Miss Hayden my letter. It would have been better if, with your usual sweetness, you had put it into her hand, if you had replied, to the ridicule she endeavoured to throw on our correspondence, in words to this effect: <Q>Why, Miss Hayden, my mamma ap∣proves of this arrangement, and she is undoubtedly a better judge of the utility of the plan than I am; it is her wish to render letter writing familiar to me; and she thinks the books which she recommends to my perusal with those adventitious events that may be worth treasuring up, will be more deeply infixed in my memory, if I dwell upon them long enough to commit my remarks thereon to paper, than if I passed them by in a cursory manner; besides, she is thus presented with an opportunity of forming my taste, and correcting my judgment, which might not otherwise have been afforded her. With regard
<PB N="78" REF="034162_0424_0FFC6A74AEFA65D0"/>
to our dwelling under the same roof, I have heard my mamma observe, that we are as really separated by the walls of our respective apartments, as if we were placed in different kingdoms. It is often as difficult to recollect the features of a friend who is in the next room, as if he was removed to the em∣pire of China. Spirit is not, in this particular, ei∣ther embarrassed by distance, or assisted by vicinity. On the wings of imagination, I can transport myself to the mansion of any family I have visited in Philadelphia, with as much celerity, as I can be <HI>thus borne</HI> to the parlour, where I every day meet my assembled friends; nay, if spirit, when acting in∣dependent of material organs, is in no sort govern∣ed by their admeasurement, I can as easily peep in∣to the city of London, <HI>with my bodily eyes,</HI> as into the next room, <HI>provided I made no advances to the neighbouring apartment;</HI> and, seated at my writing desk, without an observer, I do as certainly address an <HI>absent parent,</HI> as if she had been unfortunately called to cross the vast atlantic.</Q></P>
<P>After you had delivered yourself to the above ef∣fect, if Miss Hayden had continued her ludicrous com∣ments, it would have been easy to have changed the subject; and, conscious of your own superiority, you must have experienced in such a procedure, a perfect calm. But, on the contrary, you have made your∣self the aggressor—your indignation is roused by the prattle of a girl whom you <HI>affect to despise</HI>—you un∣kindly refuse a request that you could have granted without the smallest inconvenience to yourself—you enumerate circumstances, with the odium of which, she is not justly chargeable—you produce them against her, and, with a degree of rancour of which I had not supposed you capable, by pointing out an <HI>almost imperceptible blemish</HI>—you endeavour to detract from those personal charms, which Miss Hayden is general∣ly acknowledged to possess!!</P>
<P><HI>Natural defects, suppose them to be irremediable,</HI> should never be pressed into the catalogue of faults, since I
<PB N="79" REF="034162_0425_0FFC6A71F0631D90"/>
am not to be responsible for that which in no sort de∣pended upon me; they may properly excite our <HI>silent commiseration,</HI> or, if occasion calls it forth, our <HI>expres∣sed sympathy;</HI> but a person remarking upon them in any other way, incurs the guilt of <HI>malevolence, injustice,</HI> and <HI>impiety.</HI> Of <HI>malevolence,</HI> because it is a manifest indi∣cation that we are ill disposed towards a fellow crea∣ture. Of <HI>injustice,</HI> because, as I have just hinted, we thereby condemn, or make an individual suffer, for a circumstance not to be avoided, and which the voli∣tion of the being, whose misfortune we thus aggra∣vate, was no how accessary in procuring. Of <HI>impiety,</HI> because we thus irreverently subject to ridicule, and tacitly arraign, the wisdom of that Supreme Being who presents his productions precisely in the order and manner which, to his unerring judgment, seem∣eth best. There can be but <HI>one good reason,</HI> for hold∣ing up to the view of the world at large, or the indi∣vidual in particular, a deformity either in the intel∣lectual or animal conformation. It is superfluous to add that this is <HI>reformation,</HI> and where this is not the object, those who remark thereon are both <HI>officious</HI> and <HI>ill-natured.</HI> The truth is, the person of Miss Hayden is uncommonly beautiful, her understanding is natur∣ally good, and had her education been proper, she would undoubtedly have been acknowledged a very lovely young person. The variation in her fine eyes, scarcely amounts to a <HI>mote;</HI> it can hardly be deemed an imperfection.</P>
<P>The voice of praise from the lips of my Margaretta will always sound sweetly in my ear. Not that I would wish you an indiscriminate panegyrist—by no means, but let <HI>your silence</HI> give evidence of your pow∣ers of discrimination. Applaud with all the energy of language, when incense so rich becomes <HI>righteously due.</HI> But forbear to <HI>publish</HI> (unless to answer some valuable purpose, that can be no otherwise accom∣plished) <HI>the errors which you may remark.</HI> Believe me, my love, the injurious consequences of detraction are incalculable; when once the comment of severity has
<PB N="80" REF="034162_0426_0FFC6A706C886400"/>
escaped your lips, it is beyond your control, and while it may inflict the deepest wounds, a remedy re∣maineth not in your gift; you can only lament the melancholy effects of your indiscretion. Often, also, have I known the tale of slander to implant in the bo∣som of the propagator its deadly talons, and the un∣wary detractor hath himself become the ultimate sacrifice.</P>
<P>But to dwell on the evils of detraction, would require powers more energetic than words can command. De∣traction is the first-born of envy, the fiend of society, and the fell despoiler of honest same. <HI>Beware</HI> then, my child, of its blighting influence; let your friend Miss Clifford also <HI>beware, for there is not a calamity written in the book of adversity, of which it may not be productive.</HI> I am fearful you have treated Miss Hay∣den unkindly. I recollect when she quitted your cham∣ber that she passed the parlour window in tears; and your avowed complacency in her departure, and sub∣sequent declaration, with that of your friend, relative to her future visits, abundantly justify my suspicion. Miss Hayden is a mild tempered girl, and her easy good humour, when told of her faults, evinceth the serenity of her disposition. <HI>To point out faults,</HI> is an office that ought to be sacred to that <HI>experience which is the growth of a length of years, or to that tried friend∣ship that hath stood the test of various situations. Marga∣retta Melworth is yet too young to take upon her this impor∣tant task:</HI> If you can influence your companions by the <HI>propriety</HI> and <HI>beauty</HI> of your <HI>example,</HI> it is well; <HI>admo∣nition</HI> and <HI>censure, must be referred to a riper age.</HI> If you have, indeed, deported yourself with undue reserve, superciliousness, or mortifying neglect, you have but one way of restoring yourself to my good opinion. Seek Miss Hayden—and in your own amiable manner cancel a fault, which I am willing to consider as pro∣ceeding from a want of reflection—cancel this <HI>essential deviation from the consistency of your character,</HI> by conde∣scending to <HI>solicit</HI> a reconciliation. Remember, my love, <HI>acknowledgment</HI> of <HI>error,</HI> always adds additional lustre
<PB N="81" REF="034162_0427_0FFC6A6CECA16658"/>

<P>Do not, my daughter, suffer the freedom of my re∣marks upon this occasion, to envelop your future senti∣ments and actions in a veil of mystery or <HI>concealment;</HI> seek not to restrain the frankness of your disposition; but let your lovely bosom be still open to my inspection. If I am <HI>strict to mark; if I carefully search out the deform∣ing weed, it is because I would utterly exterminate from so fair a soil, every thing which can offend.</HI> Your virtues, I predict, will be permanent; your faults, I pleasingly believe, will be trivial; and from the eyes of a censori∣ous world, I shall still be solicitous to conceal the er∣rors of my child. Anxious for the consistency of her character, I shall, as often as I see occasion, freely cor∣rect; and while I point out those mistakes, upon <HI>which persons less interested will be silent, or, perhaps, assail her ear with the strains of adulation, I shall thereby best evince my maternal regards.</HI></P>
<P>I am, my dear, enchanted by your letter; and al∣though I have hasted to erase from so fair a page the extraneous blot, I have not been the less captivated by its beauties. Your figure of the fallen plant is charm∣ing—it robbed me of some delicious tears—May my favourite flower be never more surcharged by woe—may the ready prop be still presented—may the blos∣soms of her youth be sheltered from every evil—may her life be a life of usefulness—and may the sweet com∣placency, attendant upon deeds of worth, be the com∣panion of her declining years.</P>
<P>Looking over your letter, I find I have yet to re∣spond to the article relative to Lady Ann Fostess. You wish I had written my sentiments respecting this character: Why, my love, it requires no develope∣ment; <HI>atrocious, in a high degree,</HI> its glaring enormities must strike the most superficial eye; and, as it is un∣pleasant to dwell upon instances of such depravity, I

spontaneously turn with disgust from the view. But, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ossibly, I have mistaken the purport of your question; and you may only be desirous to know if I imagine there exists a being in <HI>real life, who might have sat for the picture of a Lady Ann Fostess.</HI> Alas! my dear, I regret that my veracity impels an answer in the affirm∣ative. Yes, indeed, your native island has produced a plentiful growth of vice, as well as virtue. But you are not to suppose <HI>duplicity, treachery,</HI> and <HI>haughty ar∣rogance, confined to the Albion shore</HI>—Alas! no. Should I suffer you to retain the sweet delusion, in which in∣nocence hath, in the present moment, cradled your ideas, experience would, ere long, convince you that America is not exempted from their desolating prog∣ress; that human nature is every where the same; and that, in addition to the <HI>substantiality of virtue, her cau∣tionary guards must still remain on duty.</HI> It is with re∣luctance that I rouse my girl from the golden dream, in which I have so long permitted her to slumber; but it is necessary that she should gradually view ob∣jects as <HI>they really are,</HI> lest, suddenly awakened by the hand of violence, she might, <HI>at too late a period, make discoveries fatal to her peace.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAREST, BEST OF FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE you and my papa are continued in this world, there is no misfortune that can happen to your Margaretta, which will be so heavy as
<PB N="83" REF="034162_0429_0FFC6A6874122B70"/>
your displeasure. I saw, immediately upon my enter∣ing the dining parlour this day, that you did not look upon your poor girl exactly as you have heretofore done—your eye, as it met mine, did not say, "Mar∣garetta, you are a good girl, and I am,"—as I re∣member you have frequently styled yourself—"<HI>your approbating mother.</HI>" You called me too, "<HI>Miss Mel∣worth!</HI>"—and although you looked tenderly upon me, when this coolness drew from me a sigh, which indeed came from the bottom of my trembling bosom, yet I could see, <HI>too plainly,</HI> that you were not reconciled to me; and I should immediately have thrown myself at your dear blessed feet, entreating you to tell me in what I had offended, and supplicating your forgive∣ness, had I not been sure and certain, that your disap∣probation was occasioned by my letter, and had you not given it as a rule, that I should not refer, in con∣versation, to those letters, until the close of a corres∣pondence so delightful to me. The wonder is, how I continued at table—but dinner over, I was no longer able to suppress my emotions, and I flew to my cham∣ber to weep over a fault, that I was sure I had com∣mitted! Plato followed with your letter—with trem∣bling lips I kissed the seal—I hastened to read, and the reason for the unusual reception I had met, was fully explained! I read it over and over again, blushing and weeping by turns. Ah, mamma! it is impossible I should ever commit a second error of this kind! Most sincerely do I despise myself, while my mother appears more an angel than before! You are all good∣ness and sweet condescension to every body—every one whom I know has told me this again and again; and besides, I see it myself every day—how then could I act so very different from my mamma! How many tears has my strange behaviour cost me! and, what is worse than all, I, who should give nothing but pleas∣ure to my mother, have wounded her bosom also!</P>
<P>Well, but when my poor heart was almost ready to burst, I began to see that there were many lines in your letter, from which I ought to take comfort. You
<PB N="84" REF="034162_0430_0FFC6A64FB6CEBD0"/>
did not say, your poor orphan child had <HI>forfeited your good opinion forever</HI>—no indeed, no such thing—there was yet one way left, by which I might again become your <HI>own Margaretta;</HI> and, dropping down on my knees before the chair, (in which you usually sit, when you pass those charming moments in my chamber, that you bid me call the visits of my maternal friend) I thanked God and my blessed mother, for the consola∣tion contained in that dear charming line, <HI>that there was yet one way left, by which I might be restored to your good opinion</HI>—and jumping upon my feet, I clapped my hands out of pure joy; and so, mamma, I immediate∣ly tripped down stairs, <HI>without either hat or scarf,</HI> (for I thought it right to punish that impertinent pride, which had officiously brought upon me so much evil) and sat off in pursuit of Miss Hayden. When I en∣tered her parlour, I began an apology; but she, not in the least attending to what I was about to say, threw into my arms a little lap-dog, which she said was the most beautiful creature in the world; that her mamma had just purchased it for her; and, "Margaretta," she added, <Q>you will be pleased when you hear, that for this one indulgent action of my mamma's, (for she herself detests lap-dogs) I am determined to become the best girl in the world! Come hither, Florus—poor fellow—rest upon your mistress's lap—there—lay still. Yes, Miss Melworth, I will, if possible, be∣come as good as Miss Clifford, or yourself, and I am sure I cannot have better models.</Q></P>
<P>I will confess to you, my mamma, that I was mor∣tified to observe Miss Hayden had thought my rude∣ness <HI>(for indeed it deserves no better name)</HI> below her attention. At that moment I could not forbear ac∣knowledging her superiority; and, had it not been that I must have <HI>passed from your care,</HI> I would gladly have changed characters with Miss Hayden; so much did her <HI>manner</HI> of passing by my unbecoming conduct, exalt her in my opinion. But, waving my hand, with an expression of gratitude for her kind sentiments of Miss Clifford and myself, I said, while a blush of con∣scious
<PB N="85" REF="034162_0431_0FFC6A6250542530"/>
inferiority crimsoned my cheek—I have called upon you this afternoon, dear Miss Hayden, to make confession of the impropriety of my late behaviour to you; to ask your forgiveness; to solicit your future friendship; and to request, as a token you are indeed reconciled unto me, that you will read the letter, which, on an occasion so truly dishonourable to myself, you expressed a wish to see.</P>
<P>Miss Hayden, notwithstanding Florus was reposing upon her lap, immediately rose from her chair, and, throwing her arms about my neck, she burst into tears! Never, methought, did any one, <HI>except my mam∣ma,</HI> appear so lovely. As soon as she had a little re∣covered herself from the surprise into which my ad∣dress had thrown her, she affectionately said—<Q>I will not deny that I thought you, Miss Melworth, a little disobliging; you are generally so fond of giving pleasure, that any thing of a contrary kind from you is so much the more unpleasant: But when I relat∣ed the circumstance to my mother, she thought that my flippant conduct might have drawn upon me your dislike, and she advised me to set about an al∣teration of manners, which I was partly resolved to do, even before she made me a present of my little Florus; and when I saw you enter this afternoon, it gave me more pleasure than I can say. I thought there could not be a better time to set about <HI>my ref∣ormation, as mamma calls it;</HI> and I was rejoiced too, that you thought enough of me to visit me. With regard to forgiveness, it is too much to say. I was, I remember, very provoking; I felt uncommon∣ly mischievous. Let these expressions of endear∣ment</Q>—and she kissed my forehead—<Q>help us to forget the past, and let me be considered in future, as a wild good-natured girl, who is determined to improve by your example.</Q> I caught her hand with grateful tenderness, and just at this moment her mother entered; she looked both astonished and de∣lighted at seeing us so affectionately engaged; we re∣lated the termination of our misunderstanding, and she too shed over us tears of joy.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="034162_0432_0FFC6A60CB729E48"/>
I produced from my pocket-book your dear letter, and put it into the hands of the young lady with a look of entreaty; she kissed the paper, and presented it with inimitable gracefulness to her mamma. Mrs. Hayden read it and commented upon it, in a way calculated to improve both her daughter and myself. I have heard you say, mamma, if I remember right, that Mrs. Hayden is an accomplished woman: She regret∣ted that her Emily had been so little attended to; she wished she may be permitted to peruse as many of the letters of a correspondence so <HI>well judged,</HI> as might consist with propriety; and, that if it were not too great a favour, she might sometimes be permitted to make one of those reading parties, of which she had heard so much, and from which it was evident, Miss Clifford and myself had derived such essential advan∣tages. I ventured to assure both the ladies, that it would add to the happiness of my mamma, if Miss Hayden would regularly join us upon our stated read∣ing hours, (was I right, mamma?) and she will, ac∣cordingly, meet us in the reading parlour when we next assemble. I took my leave, with repeated assur∣ances, that I would endeavour, by future acts of kind∣ness, to cancel the disobligation of the past; and, has∣tening to my own apartment, I could not enjoy a mo∣ment until I had given you this circumstantial account.</P>
<P>And now, mamma, again kneeling at the chair you have so often filled, I do most earnestly supplicate your forgiveness for the trouble I am sensible I must have given you. Let me entreat you, in your own charm∣ing words, "<HI>Restore your Margaretta to your good opin∣ion;</HI>" for indeed, indeed, she is lost to every comfort until you do! When I see you at tea will you again look kindly upon me, kiss my cheek, and call me once more your good little girl? If you assure me of your full and free pardon, and of your restored approbation, then will my poor heart leap for joy; and then, and not till then, will your ever dutiful child be again your truly happy</P>

<HEAD>To MARGARETTA MELWORTH.</HEAD>
<P>COME to me, my angel child—come to me imme∣diately—wait not for the distant hour of tea. Upon an occasion so every way answerable to my fondest hopes, we will dispense with forms—we need not re∣cur by words to an affair, the termination of which has filled my bosom with unutterable joy—words will not be necessary; and if they were, I should not have it in my power to command them. But my eyes, so lately darting the chilling glances of reserve, are now humid with the gush of tenderness, and they shall speak every thing my Margaretta wishes—every thing she so richly merits. Come to me, my best girl, and let me imprint upon that lovely cheek, the fondest kiss I have ever yet bestowed—we will mingle some delicious tears, and I will clasp to my bosom, with augmented complacency, as the richest boon which Heaven can bestow, my sweet tempered, my virtuous child!</P>
<P>I await your presence in my chamber—no one but your father, whose raptures are equal to my own, will witness our interview—we are alike impatient to be∣hold our now faultless Margaretta. Delay not, sweet love, but hasten to the arms of your <HI>approbating mother,</HI></P>

<P>Margaretta, thus receiving permission, rushed in∣stantly into our apartment, and such were the rapidity of her movements, that, ere we were aware, flinging herself almost breathless at the feet of her mother, and clasping her knees in a kind of extasy, she exhibited a spectacle the most charmingly interesting which can be imagined. Mary raised her in her arms—alternately we pressed her to our bosoms, and, until that moment, I had never experienced transports so exquisitely de∣lightful!</P>
<P>Thus ended an affair, that some may possibly regard as a "<HI>much ado about nothing;</HI>" but Mary, availing her∣self of the ascendency she had obtained over the mind of her daughter, <HI>had purposely wrought it up to the high∣est
<PB N="88" REF="034162_0434_0FFC6A5949404558"/>
importance.</HI> She was solicitous to uproot every propensity which discovered the most remote tendency to the malignancy of scandal. She conceived, that as impressions are generally made with success in the early part of life, she could hardly be premature in her efforts to implant a proper detestation of this <HI>hydra evil;</HI> and the event proved she had acted judiciously; for this little circumstance, with all its consequences, was indelibly stamped upon the mind of Miss Melworth; the serious solemnity with which it had been attended, engraved it there; it confirmed her the irreconcileable foe to detraction in all its varieties; and she recoils, with a kind of horror, for which perhaps she does not always stop to account, from the very semblance of a malevolent remark; nor do I believe she has, from the above era to the present moment, ever uttered a single sentence, that could, by any rational construc∣tion, be termed <HI>invidious.</HI></P>
<P>It was the design both of Mary and myself, to pro∣duce our daughter, in that career on which she was entering, both theoretically and practically, a philan∣thropic moralist. And to this valuable end were di∣rected both my admonitions and precepts, as well as the conversation and letters of her mother. We were well aware of the vast importance of the <HI>first informed movements of reason,</HI> of <HI>first principles,</HI> and of a <HI>com∣mencement in the path of rectitude.</HI> We were sensible that individuals, connected in society, necessarily de∣pend upon each other; and that, of course, our felicity or infelicity is more or less deducible from sentiments and arrangements beyond our control. We proposed to Miss Melworth the general approbation of man∣kind, as an object worthy her unremitting pursuit; and, as we could not conceive of a human being so insignificant, as to bar the possibility of his, or her, future influence upon our prospects, so we taught her to estimate the good will of every individual as a de∣sirable acquisition. It must be remembered, however, that we always inculcated the necessity of circumscrib∣ing a wish for universal applause, in itself laudable,
<PB N="89" REF="034162_0435_0FFC6A57B86DFFC8"/>
within the boundaries of virtue; that we erected our standard of rectitude, and first of all, carefully impressed an idea of the <HI>superior importance of self-complacency, and of approving Heaven.</HI> But, having taken down in short hand, as I was seated at my writing-desk, in a closet adjoining to Margaretta's, a few disjointed sentences, which fell from the lips of my wife, during one of those hours appropriated to the instruction of her beloved charge, I transcribe them from my minutes.</P>
<Q><P>There are, my love, a variety of means, by which you may insure to yourself the general good wishes and esteem of all those with whom you associate; and this, too, without parting with a shilling of your prop∣erty, or the smallest inconvenience to yourself. Nay, on the contrary, it may happen that you will thus procure considerable pecuniary emolument; and you will certainly reap incalculable mental advantages; your bosom will be tranquillized, and you will possess that harmony of intellect, which few events will be ca∣pable of interrupting. But let me be more particular: Avoid engaging warmly as a disputant; deliver your sentiments, when called upon, with calmness and dig∣nity; and never assume a <HI>decisive</HI> air, or tone of voice.</P>
<P>Accustom yourself to dilate on pleasing facts; dwell with pleasure on every good action; <HI>advocate the cause of the absent,</HI> and do not suffer yourself to repeat those instances of misconduct, which you may have heard. Hide the faults which may happen to come under your observation, with as much care as if they were your own; never make them the subject of your animadversions, except you have <HI>good ground</HI> for imagining that you shall thereby effectuate some <HI>valuable purpose.</HI> Be scrupulously exact in your ob∣servance of that intercourse of civilities, pronounced, by a certain class of people, <HI>essential to good breeding.</HI> It is true, we may regard those ceremonies as trivial; but nothing, <HI>in fact,</HI> can be indifferent, on which the <HI>inestimable enjoyments of society are made to depend;</HI> in∣deed, a regular observance of punctuality, in every department, will always be recognized as a virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="034162_0436_0FFC6A55D5052E08"/>
But while I counsel you to be a tenacious ob∣server of the <HI>etiquette,</HI> established in those circles in which you may happen to move, as far as it relates to others, being careful, in no instance, to draw upon yourself the accusation of neglect, I would wish you, on your own part, to rise superior to those, in <HI>reality, little</HI> punctilios; be not easily betrayed into resentment; do not indulge an irritable disposition of mind, nor sub∣ject your associates to the necessity of moving as if they trod on glass, for fear of wounding your feel∣ings. There is one rule to which it will be well con∣stantly to adhere—never take offence at any inatten∣tion you may have reason to suppose undesigned; when you are in reality injured, accept an apology; and let that <HI>mild indulgence, so proper to a being subjected to error, be ever prominent in your conduct.</HI> With the ex∣ample of my grandmother, of celebrious memory, I have been particularly charmed; as often as she found the shafts of slander aimed against herself, if the ca∣lumniator ranked in the number of her ostensible friends, it was her custom to take an early opportunity of visiting them, <HI>not to reproach them,</HI> but to evince, by the augmented urbanity and indulgent forgiveness of her manners, how little she merited their censure: If the maligner was found among the sons and daugh∣ters of penury, she never failed of bestowing upon them some extraordinary and liberal mark of the un∣common elevation of her spirit. Thus did her <HI>enemies become her warmest panegyrists, and every malevolent princi∣ple was absorbed in the splendor of her almost peerless virtues.</HI></P>
<P>But while I am solicitous to put you in possession of the good opinion of that world, upon the great the∣atre of which you are so soon to make your <HI>entrée,</HI> I wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld not, however, wish you to purchase it at the expense of the integrity or sincerity of your character. May undue commendation never be found upon the lips of my Margaretta; <HI>adulation debases the mind;</HI> and while I recommend the mantle of candour, with the same breath I would insist, that no temptation should extort a eulogy upon the indiscreet or the unworthy.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="034162_0437_0FFC6A530E0979B0"/>
Be not hasty to make professions of friendship, nor credit those feverish impressions, which probably are, at best, but the paroxysms of an hour; but regard the <HI>deliberate and uniform esteem of persons of established vir∣tue and reputation, as an incalculable treasure, and endeav∣our to preserve their good opinion, by pursuing those attain∣ments that, when possessed, will infallibly bestow upon you the perfumed wreath of sweet applause.</HI></P>
<P>Much hath been said respecting the virtue of secret-keeping, and the necessity of electing a discreet confi∣dant; let me rather hope that you will have <HI>no secrets to keep.</HI> You will, I dare believe, be careful to obtain, and to perpetuate, that equity of thinking, and pro∣priety of acting, which will paint your cheek with the hue of innocence, endow with modest confidence your words and actions, and insure a continuity of that charming serenity and cheerful expectation, that at present triumphs in your bosom. Yet, it is true, that there are a thousand little delicacies, contingent alarms, hopes and fears, which alternately predominate in the female mind. These may create embarrassments, ob∣scuring, possibly, the better way, and enveloping in clouds those enjoyments, that, under proper regula∣tions, would unquestionably bestow the richest com∣placency. Of all those <HI>entanglements,</HI> and <HI>intricacies of every description,</HI> the breast of a <HI>maternal</HI> friend is the only proper repository. Years almost necessarily en∣dow with experience; and <HI>affection, directed by knowl∣edge, is demonstrably the surest guide.</HI> A judicious moth∣er, rising superior to considerations, which generally influence a younger and <HI>less interested confidant,</HI> will not cherish ill founded hopes, nor give energy to those passions that are founded in weakness; <HI>but she will do better; by her systematic efforts, she will annihilate the dif∣ficulty,</HI> and again lead the footsteps of the lovely trem∣bler into the beamy paths of peace. A mother will neither indulge nor soothe those errors, which are pro∣ductive of imbecility; her plan is, to crush in embryo every thing that may have a pernicious influence up∣on the future progress of her child, <HI>to nerve by resolution,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="034162_0438_0FFC6A4EC8AC69C8"/>
and to cultivate that fortitude so necessary in the ca∣reer of life; and hence it is, that a mother should be considered as the only proper confidant of her daughter.</P>
<P>I will confess, my dear, that I am not only satisfied, but perfectly charmed with your conduct. Your res∣olution to become exactly what I wish, has been inva∣riably reduced to practice; and the sweet conscious∣ness, and tender ingenuousness of your apologies, have totally cancelled those mistakes, on which you have been precipitated by inexperience. Never, I bless God, have I discovered in you a blameable impatience of reproof, nor censurable haste to procure your own justification; all <HI>aggravating, self-applauding</HI> replies, <HI>implied accusations of rigour, audacious pertness and self-sufficient loquacity, or discontented gloomy reserve, sullen glances, angry and provoking gestures, with dumb indigna∣tion</HI>—from all these you have still been wholly exempt, and I have to acknowledge your mild submission, sweet discretion, and affectionate duty, as the richest solace, both to your father and myself.</P>
<P>Such also is your conduct to our domestics, as to merit our highest approbation. The authority which I have thought proper to delegate to you, has been admirably supported. Without assuming arrogance, or that imperious haughtiness, so vexatiously distressing to dependants, you have conducted with dignity, amelio∣rated by condescension; and this hath insured you both respect and esteem. I am pleased with your <HI>man∣ner</HI> of <HI>directing;</HI> and the habit you have so happily ac∣quired, of <HI>requesting the assistance</HI> of those about you, is certainly preferable, both in <HI>form</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> to that peremptory commanding tone of voice, and imperious style of language, so generally adopted. Nothing can merit contempt, but unworthy actions; and you therefore rightly judge, that the individual, who, in the order of things, is employed in the lowest useful occupa∣tion, provided he sills his sphere with propriety, should not only be exempted from scorn and derision, but <HI>is, in reality, superior to the crowned head,</HI> whose life is a
<PB N="93" REF="034162_0439_0FFA65446684E6A0"/>
combination of atrocious crimes. It is well observed, that good servants should be regarded as humble friends. I am persuaded it will ever be your aim to make their yoke easy; and I repeat, that in this house, the mild benignity of your temper, and your engaging deportment, without in the smallest degree diminish∣ing the consideration due to you, as the daughter of our election, has established you in every heart. It has been your object to mitigate the unavoidable evils, and to lessen the respective burdens of those in∣dividuals who compose our household; and I observe with pleasure, that you have become the sovereign lady of their affections.</P>
<P>I am not apprehensive, that the rendering you the praise, so indispensably your due, will be, in any sort, injurious. You will not, I flatter myself, be un∣duly elated—far otherwise—the noble energies of your disposition will be thus stimulated to yet higher excel∣lence. Nothing is more disgusting than an overween∣ing self-sufficiency and presumptuous pride, particu∣larly in young persons; modest diffidence carries with it its own recommendation. I should blush to find my Margaretta; except induced by particular circum∣stances, making herself the heroine of her own narra∣tions. Those events which may be importantly inter∣esting to you, and from which you conceive you derive an elevation of character, will, too probably, fatigue in the recital; the indifferent will consider them as insip∣id; you will be subjected to ridicule, and assuredly draw upon yourself the odium of <HI>egotism and imper∣tinence.</HI></P>
<P>It is wisdom to cultivate a complacency in the scene under your present observation. <HI>Contentment is the richest gem within the grasp of mortality;</HI> hardly any price can be too great for so valuable an acquisition; it is a <HI>substitute</HI> for almost every lesser enjoyment, and often supplies, with much respectability, the place of higher orders of felicity. <HI>You cannot call back the past, you may never attain the future, and,</HI> surely then, I may repeat, <HI>it is wisdom to cultivate complacency in
<PB N="94" REF="034162_0440_0FFC6A4D42C08B48"/>
the present,</HI> and to use all possible diligence to accom∣modate your mind to a situation, which you have it not in your power to ameliorate, however <HI>ineligible</HI> it may, <HI>in fact, be.</HI></P></Q>
<P>My minutes go no further, yet they may serve to give an idea of those sentiments, which were repeatedly and carefully inpressed upon the mind of Margaretta; and I can scarcely imagine the reader will think their introduction in this place stands in need of an apology.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR MAMMA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is impossible for any words of mine to say, with what unequalled pleasure I read over and over again, those letters which you have condescended to write to me. I have this morning been placing them according to their dates. I have bestowed upon them more kisses than there are lines; and, conjoining them with a piece of purple ribon, I can thus turn to them the more readily; the impression made by the folds will gradually disappear, and, while I live, I shall be able to preserve them. The last ten letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These letters do not appear.</NOTE>, contain∣ing directions for my conduct, in all those situations in which you suppose I may possibly be placed, I shall certainly read, at least once, every day.</P>
<P>Surely, never—no, never—was poor, rich orphan so completely blessed as your Margaretta. When you
<PB N="95" REF="034162_0441_0FFC6A4BB1431580"/>
went through Evelina yesterday, I could scarcely for∣bear interrupting you by an expression of those feel∣ings of gratitude, which were all collected, if I may so say, in one delightful emotion of exquisite and almost ungovernable joy! Evelina, it is true, did not find a mo∣ther; but Mr. Villars was exactly such a man as my ten∣derly indulgent father; and, methought, it was my own dear papa who was addressing Lady Howard, when he so affectionately says, <Q><HI>That child, Madam, shall never, while life is lent, know the loss she has sustained. I have cherished, succoured and supported her, from her earliest infancy to her sixteenth year.</HI></Q> Good, kind gen∣tleman—I was uncommonly affected. I have been looking over Evelina again this morning; and, on my knees, I pray God, that both you and my papa may be able to say of your Margaretta, as Mr. Villars of his Evelina, that she has amply repaid your care and affection, and that she is all which your fondest wishes had anticipated.</P>
<P>Evelina was very happy to meet in Lord Orville, a friend so like her papa. Is it not very uncommon, mamma, for so young a gentleman to be in the exercise of those virtues which seemed to have found a home in the bosom of the venerable Mr. Villars?</P>
<P>But Evelina deserved every thing—Was she not, my mamma, a <HI>faultless character?</HI> Surely the English reviewers, of whom I have heard so much, must have spoken highly of those volumes. I have again been weeping over the sufferings of Lady Belmont—Sir John Belmont I also pity—May God protect me from the cruel impositions of base and interested men! I think, mamma, you did not give your opinion of Eve∣lina. Your next letter, I hope, will teach me how I ought to think of it; and may I never take a step without your kind advice and direction, and may I always continue your affectionately dutiful,</P>

<HEAD>To MARGARETTA MELWORTH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR CHILD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>RARELY doth a day pass without furnishing me with some new reason to love and admire my Marga∣retta. You have experienced that I am not niggard of praise, nor is it proper I should be so. I would as soon withhold from you the light of heaven, lest you should become enamoured with the beauty of your face, or the symmetry of your person, (neither of which you have been any how instrumental in pro∣curing) as I would keep back those commendations decidedly due to unequivocal merit, in the fear they might be productive of self-conceit.</P>
<P>Praise operates upon the youthful mind like the vernal shower upon the tender plant, or like the clear shining of that parent orb, whose genial ray succeeds the fertilizing irrigation. And I am, at this moment, in possession of a motive sufficient to extort applause even from the frigidity of apathy. Yes, my love, since you retired to your pen this morning, I have made a discovery, that, while it <HI>elevates to a degree of rapture, the complacency I am in the habit of experiencing in my child,</HI> incalculably augments my confidence in her virtues.</P>
<P>You recollect when your papa first informed you, that you should receive, at the close of every week, a small sum, as pocket money, (which has since been regularly paid you) he at the same time assured you, it should remain entirely at your own disposal; that he would never require, or receive an account of its expenditure; and that, however you might think proper to enter it in your calculation of expenses, it should, on no occasion, be subjected to his inspection; and by this assurance he has ever since been religiously bound. I will confess to you, my dear, that having never observed even a vestige of this money, I have had a strong curiosity to know in what manner it was bestowed; but regarding the <HI>wishes</HI> of your father as <HI>rules</HI> for my conduct, I have forborne to investigate;
<PB N="97" REF="034162_0443_0FFC6A456AA04AE0"/>
and, as the sum was small, I was the less anxious re∣specting it. This morning, however, has produced a most unexpected and captivating eclaircissement. In∣duced, by its beauties, to prefer a walk to a book, I strolled further than I have done since the illness under which I so long laboured, and which filled the bosom of my Margaretta with such tender apprehensions. It happened in my walk, that I passed the cottage of Me∣lona, whom I have not seen for more than a year; and, indulging a hope, that time, aided by necessity, might have procured that reformation, for which my coun∣sels had been ineffectual, I felt a strong inclination to look in upon the poor woman. I passed her humble threshold, marking, with pleasure, an appearance of neatness, I had never before witnessed in the dwelling of Melona.</P>
<P>The cottage, you know, has two apartments; no person was in that which I entered; but it bore strong testimony of the cleanliness and industry of its mistress; and, moreover, the buz of a spinning-wheel saluted my ear! This is excellent, thought I, and just as I was about to enter the other room, little Peggy open∣ed the door, and carefully shutting it after her, tripped into the street. The child had her eyes so steadily fix∣ed upon the spelling-book, which she held open in her hand, that she did not observe me; and the grateful noise of the spinning-wheel still continued. Peggy's apparel was strikingly descriptive of <HI>scanty means, dili∣gently employed to the best possible advantage;</HI> and this cir∣cumstance, together with the new face which every thing in the cottage of Melona assumed, determined me to interrogate the child, expecting, from her inno∣cence and simplicity, a clue of direction for my ap∣proaches to her mother. I soon overtook her, and in∣terrupted her studies with a—How are you, my pretty little Peggy? She had no recollection of me, and not having reflection enough to teach her to wonder at my knowledge of her name, with a childish kind of bash∣fulness, she dropped a courtesy, and said, "Pretty well I thank you, Madam." Where are you going, Peggy?
<PB N="98" REF="034162_0444_0FFC6A43E197FDA8"/>
"I goes every day to school, Ma'am, now-a-days." And what do you read in, pray? "I reads in this here spelling-book; and I studies my lesson every morning." That is very proper, my dear; you seem to have a very handsome spelling-book, quite new; I hope you take care of it: Who gave it to you, Peggy? "That I must not tell, Madam; for Miss Melworth would be angry if I should." Miss Melworth! said I, almost gasping for breath; why, child, what has Miss Melworth to do with it? "I must not say, Madam, for Miss Margaretta herself bid me not to speak; but for all that, my mamma says how that she is an angel, and that she has saved us all, and made her a thousand times <HI>gooder</HI> than she was before; but this is all a se∣cret, and I would not tell for the world."</P>
<P>Here I will own to you, my love, that your <HI>per∣severing</HI> superiority originated in my bosom, admira∣tion of my daughter, and accusation of myself. But determining to trace every step, by which you had ef∣fectuated so valuable a change, I took Peggy by the hand, and once more entered the cottage of Melona. "<HI>The wicket opening with a latch,</HI>" gave us a ready ad∣mittance into its back apartment. Melona threw her eyes over a countenance she had so long known; a crimson blush instantly suffused her cheek, and was as instantly succeeded by a death-like paleness; her wheel stopped, and, sinking upon a chair, it was with difficulty that the immediate application of my salts preserved her from fainting.</P>
<P>When she was a little composed I began my attack, and managing with some address, I soon obtained the full confession of a secret, which adds another beauti∣ful trait to the character of my Margaretta. She in∣formed me of your appearance under her humble roof upon the week you first received your little sti∣pend—of your sage admonitions—of your earnest en∣treaties that she would permit you to put her little Peggy to school—of your proposal to purchase the spinning-wheel—of the assistance she had received from you during her illness, and that of her husband—and
<PB N="99" REF="034162_0445_0FFC6A4212AFA160"/>
of the happy change a patronage so unexpected had produced in her life. Reflecting, she said, upon the great goodness of so young a lady, upon her stooping to take such a compassionate interest in her affairs, and condescending to urge her, with such extraordinary earnestness, to assist herself to have pity on her husband, to have pity on her poor little Peggy, and to make the best of that little which was allowed her, filled h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r with grief, joy and astonishment—grief, at her own unworthiness and great wickedness—and joy and astonishment, that a <HI>little angel had come down from Heaven, to dwell among the sinners of mankind</HI>—(I give you her own words.) She immediately made a vow, that nothing stronger than water should, in future, pass her lips; and, that she might have no temptation to forfeit a resolution so salutary, she forthwith com∣mitted <HI>the intoxicating distillation, hitherto carefully con∣cealed for her own particular use,</HI> to the stream which winds its way at a little distance from the cottage; and, being earnestly bent upon a thorough reform, her application became as remarkable as her previous negligence had been; and habit reconciling her to her new walk, frugality, neatness and industry, with all their captivating charms, soon burst upon her.</P>
<P>Melona informs me, that she long refused to receive any part of your weekly stipend; but that, on your positive assurance, that the kindness of your parents had left you no wish ungratified; that you possessed an undoubted right to dispose of this sum exactly accord∣ing to your own pleasure; and, that her acceptance was the only compensation she could make to you for the interest you so kindly took in her welfare, she had at length consented to receive from you weekly dona∣tions; that you had furnished her husband with many articles necessary to his business; and that you par∣ticularly paid for the instruction of Peggy. But she added, that she believed, she and her little family were not your only pensioners! Matchless child! My God! how I glory in my Margaretta! or rather, in those heavenly propensities, with which thou hast en∣dowed
<PB N="100" REF="034162_0446_0FFC6D8030CEC428"/>
her. I inquire not, my beloved girl, for a list of your dependants; enjoy, <HI>in this particular, the lux∣ury of concealment; but it shall be my care, that your means shall be immediately augmented; she, who knows so well how to dispose of money, must not be circumscribed within such narrow bounds.</HI></P>
<P>Do you not think I came home in raptures with those peerless virtues which I have the honour to cher∣ish and to protect? I could hardly, upon this occasion, arrogate to myself the title of your Mother, and I felt my mind spontaneously prostrating before an intel∣lect, whose brilliant dawn surpasses the meridian ef∣fulgence of common intelligence.</P>
<P>Plato met me with your letter. I was prepared to accede to any request of yours—and, as your father does not return until the evening, I reserve, till that period, the pleasure of a circumstantial account of Me∣lona and her cottage; of the means by which I ob∣tained the delightful particulars which I shall narrate; and of bestowing upon the brow of merit, the wreath of unequivocal applause. Shall we not, my dear, en∣joy a most enchanting evening? Well, but you solicit my sentiments of Evelina. Surely, my Margaretta is an enthusiast in her gratitude—<HI>but the enthusiasm of virtue is a noble enthusiasm.</HI></P>
<P>The plot of Evelina is well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and happily executed. It is a novel to which we can return with pleasure, even to a second or third perusal, and this is more than can be said of common productions of this kind. The style is familiar and easy; and the ideas seem naturally to grow out of each other.</P>
<P>Evelina is said to be a first production, and, if so, it is entitled, or the abilities of its author, to high admi∣ration. But I think you will esteem Cecilia (which is a publication of the same author) as a work which merits a <HI>decided preference.</HI> The character of Albany, in Cecilia, is a highly finished original, and has for me peculiar charms. <HI>I do not say it is natural;</HI> but I could wish to render such characters <HI>official,</HI> and to <HI>multiply them in society.</HI> Miss Burney's publications have hith∣erto
<PB N="101" REF="034162_0447_0FFC6D7B2AB1BFA0"/>
done honour both to her fine genius and benevo∣lent heart; and, I think, they have much appropriate excellence. I am ignorant in what class the reviewers have placed the productions of Miss Burney; but jus∣tice must award them a very high rank in the literary line. Yet, it appears to me, that Evelina, as a com∣position, is not without a blemish; and, I conceive, the heroine herself <HI>is strikingly deficient</HI> in one particu∣lar, which constitutes a capital requisite in the compo∣sition of a <HI>young and amiable woman.</HI> The task of a censurer must always appear invidious; yet, for the sake of my Margaretta, who warmly demands, "<HI>Was not Evelina a faultless character?</HI>" I express my senti∣ments without reserve. Evelina then, was <HI>greatly want∣ing in that delicacy,</HI> which should have marked her de∣portment to Madame Duval. Madame Duval had been <HI>denied the aids of education; this was her misfortune, rather than her fault; and a well informed, amiable de∣scendant should have thrown over this defect the veil of du∣ty,</HI> and not have sought every opportunity to have <HI>exposed it in the most glaring colours!</HI> In the letters ad∣dressed to her <HI>reverend correspondent,</HI> the old lady is rarely mentioned without a sketch of her bad English, as, <HI>"Ay now," cried Madame Duval, "that's another of the unpolitenesses of you English, to go to talking of such things as that: Now, in Paris, nobody never says nothing about religion, no more than about politics.</HI>" And again, "<HI>I would have you learn to be more politer, Sir,</HI>" &amp;c. &amp;c. Was it, I ask, the part of a <HI>well disposed, well educated young lady,</HI> to hold up to view errors of this kind, when found in the mouth of a person, <HI>whose years,</HI> and <HI>whose affinity,</HI> entitled her to a more <HI>candid</HI> and <HI>dutiful</HI> representation?</P>
<P>It appears that Madame Duval was indebted to na∣ture for nothing but the charms of her person, and that her temper was very unhappy and cruelly implacable; yet it is not insinuated, that <HI>her enormities were greatly multiplied.</HI> She is, however, treated as the most atro∣cious of criminals; and, by the instigations of a Cap∣tain Mirvin and the <HI>lover of her grand-daughter,</HI> she re∣ceives
<PB N="102" REF="034162_0448_0FFC6D79A70837D0"/>
the most absurd and cruel outrage. The <HI>gentle</HI> Evelina, <HI>who is apprized that some mischievous plot is in agitation against her grandmother, sets out without a single remonstrance,</HI> attended only by the servants, to accom∣pany her to a justice of peace, <HI>although she had expressed previous fears of entrusting herself to her care!</HI> A farce, of which I cannot see the <HI>wit,</HI> succeeds. <HI>The poor old lady is made to believe herself in the possession of a savage banditti—her apprehensions for her life are apparently well founded—she is torn from the carriage by masked men—she is dragged along the road, cruelly agitated, shook, and thumped about—stuck fast in a ditch—her legs bound—tied to a tree—and, robbed of her head dress, she is thus left to her own contemplations, while her grand-daughter continues in her chariot, listening to a tale of love!!</HI></P>
<P>In one sense, Evelina must be considered as <HI>accessary to these unwarrantable proceedings; a single hint would have saved her parent all the cruel mortifications to which she was subjected; but this hint she withheld!</HI> If conduct so reprehensible is <HI>too gross, even for a romping miss, in pursuit of fun,</HI> how must it detract from the character of a pupil of the venerable Villars? <HI>Surely, Evelina should not have been astonished, (considering the propensities of Madame Duval) at the slap which she received in her face—and the unrestrained violence of the old lady's disposi∣tion, is, upon this occasion, rather too conciliatory. An air of ridicule</HI> is thrown over this doleful narrative by Evelina, who, giving it in the manner of the poor suf∣ferer, intersperses it with such sentences as this—"<HI>I am sure, I dare say, I am out of joint all over, &amp;c.</HI>" Evelina is a <HI>silent observer of the mirth of the servants, and confes∣ses that she was, herself, almost compelled to laugh at the pity-moving recital!!</HI> For a conduct so unequal to every other instance of her blameless life, there can be but one reason, the fear of offending a <HI>sea-monster,</HI> on whom she in no sort depended, and from whom she could, in any moment, escape to that sanctuary, which had, for so many years, continued the asylum of her innocence. But, if the fear of giving offence is an apology for Evelina, can it be considered as such
<PB N="103" REF="034162_0449_0FFC6D7822CEB0B8"/>
for the venerable Villars, to whom every circumstance is related, and <HI>from whom she receives not the smallest re∣proof?</HI> It is impossible to inculcate upon the mind of young people too high a respect for years; age is ever entitled to veneration, and we should regard the feel∣ings of persons in advanced life with the utmost de∣ference. It is true, that Madame Duval had been im∣placable to the mother of Evelina; but it does not ap∣pear, that the young lady had embraced a vindictive plan; and it is also true, that the mother of Evelina had <HI>imprudently confided in a libertine!</HI> Nor can we oth∣erwise account for this rashness, considering that she too had passed eighteen years of her life with the re∣spectable Villars, than by supposing she inherited a portion of the imbecility so strongly marked in the conduct of her parents. The agonies of Madame Du∣val, on the death of lady Belmont, should, to erring mortals, have palliated her offence; and it ought al∣ways to have been remembered, whatever were her faults, or foibles, that she was still the grand-parent of Evelina.</P>
<P>At a transaction so enormous as the unprovoked attack upon Madame Duval, we conceive additional disgust, from the consideration that it was perpetrated by persons taking rank in a circle, which, we are in∣duced to suppose, was the seat of elegance. But, for the honour of human nature, I trust, no one of its fraternity ever sat for the picture of a Captain Mirvin. I know not what the British sailors may be, but I have had an opportunity of making many observations upon various characters among that class of people in this country, and I have never yet met with a resemblance to this extravagant caricature! Do but recur to his capital enormities, plotting so unwarrantably against a female, who was countenanced as a visitor to the respectable Lady Howard; and, in the close of the third volume, throwing the whole company, consisting of genteel, well bred persons, into consternation, alarm∣ing the ladies, and distressing every individual! Are you not ready to ask, could exploits of this nature have
<PB N="104" REF="034162_0450_0FFC6D7654083838"/>
been submitted to in any civilized country under heaven? The general terror excited upon that singular occasion, (it is unnecessary to observe that I refer to the introduction of the monkey) with the blood stream∣ing from the ear of poor Lovel, would have drawn upon the malevolent plotter of the outrage, the vindictive resentment and consequent chastisement of a horde of savages.</P>
<P>Yet this invader of the rights of hospitality and betrayer of the peace of society, is first announced to the reader, by the penetrating, refined and sentimental Lady Howard, <HI>as the man of her daughter's heart, and as a personage, whose unexpected</HI> return had given birth to joyful surprise.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive how a lady of Mrs. Mir∣vin's refined sensibility, could ever unite herself to such a man▪ but, having thus done, <HI>the propriety of her subsequent conduct will not admit a doubt.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot say I am pleased with those descriptions, which attribute to humanity a greater degree of de∣formity than consists with experience. It is a sufficient apology for the <HI>exaggerated delineation of an exalted character, that it may have its use.</HI> It frequently <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> a <HI>spirit of emulation;</HI> and, although we may not reach the goal of perfection, yet every advance we make thereto, is a very valuable point gained, and certainly an ample compensation for our most arduous efforts. But vice and folly are <HI>sufficiently odious,</HI> when exhibited in their own native colours; <HI>and, while I can see no benefit in heightening the imbecility and atrocious de∣pravity of the species, I am fearful that the transgressor, when called to the observation of hues still blacker than the turpitude of his own enormities have ever yet assumed, may thence conclude his offences comparatively venial.</HI></P>
<P>The trivial scenes interspersed through the pages of Evelina and Cecilia, are, it is said, too frequent and too prolix; but I am not convinced of the justice of this remark; and I have to say, that whatever may be the defects (and no human performance is without its blemish) of those inestimable productions, their beau∣ties
<PB N="105" REF="034162_0451_0FFC6D74C7A1A4D0"/>
are of <HI>the first order.</HI> And I repeat, that their right to rank with compositions of the first class, in their line, is indisputable.</P>
<P>The character of Lord Orville is indeed highly fin∣ished; it is enriched with every virtue of which our nature, in its present state of degradation, is suscepti∣ble. Nor do I find it difficult to conceive of a sensi∣ble, discreet young man, whose mind has been early occupied by sentiments of propriety, acting, upon ev∣ery occasion, precisely as did Lord Orville. The ven∣erable Villars may also be regarded at nearly faultless. The most beautiful passages in Evelina are to be found in his letters. How tenderly affecting is his address to Lady Howard, by his Evelina! It can hardly be read too often.</P>
<P>Do you not think, my Margaretta, <HI>that I too, make my applications?</HI> But every heart must be interested in such a character; and after having, in idea, followed with him his orphan child to the ordeal over which she victoriously triumphed, we listen, with inexpressible pleasure, to his concluding address.</P>
<P>I adopt the language of this venerable man as a pe∣riod to this letter. <Q><HI>These wounds, which the former severity of fortune hath inflicted, are healed by the ulti∣mate consolation of pouring forth my dying words in bles∣sings on my child! Closing these joy-streaming eyes in her presence, and breathing my last saint sighs in her loved arms! Grieve not, Oh child of my care! grieve not at the inevitable moment; but may thy own end be equally propitious! Oh mayest thou, when full of days, and full of honour, sink down as gently to rest—be loved as kindly, watched as tenderly as thy happy</HI> mother! <HI>and mayst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when thy glass <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> run, be sweetly, but not bit∣terly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by some remaining darling of thy affections, some yet surviving</HI></Q> Margaretta.

<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not blame your tears, my dear; the loss of your young friend is a serious calamity, and it is natural to weep over our misfortunes. Horatio was a promising youth; his demise has overwhelmed with distress a worthy family, and the well grounded hopes of tender and judicious parents are thus laid in the dust. But, my dear Margaretta, while I allow you to regret the removal of Horatio, I cannot justify your impassioned exclamation—"To what purpose was he so good, so wise, so learned, and so every way accomplished?" Does not my daughter know that virtue, transplanted to a celestial soil, will flourish with immortal beauty? The faculties, while embodied in this clay-built tenement, are <HI>literally</HI> muffled by the dense and heavy materials, in which they are envel∣oped. The mind is only in its dawn of being; but the valuable acquirements which it attains while here, are not, upon its emancipation, lost; far otherwise—they are rather introductory to that career, which is to be continued and perfected in future worlds.</P>
<P>The student of history becomes acquainted with all those characters that have borne conspicuous parts upon the vast theatre of this globe. The philosopher, devoted to the study of nature, attaining those blissful regions, shall pursue, with abundant advantage, his delightful employ. The astronomer will behold, with astonishment, where other systems rise! Suns, which
<PB N="107" REF="034162_0453_0FFA655EEA8ACAF8"/>
have not even theoretically darted a single ray on his inquiring mind, will then burst in resplendent lustre to his enraptured gaze. The laws of attraction, of gravitation, the centrifugal and centripetal force of bodies; these will be fully understood. <HI>Causes,</HI> as well as <HI>effects,</HI> will stand confest; and knowledge, combining complacency, will accumulate in sublime progression. Every laudable investigation, which may be ranked un∣der the head, of intellectual contemplations, will prob∣ably be resumed with augmenting energy, while the virtues, attaining their native skies, will flourish with immortal beauty.</P>
<P>Thus the young Horatio may be considered as an amiable novitiate, who obtaining, while here, the ru∣diments of science, is now removed to a superior sem∣inary, where every acquirement worth preserving will receive the highest finishing of which it is suscep∣tible. This reflection is a source of infinite con∣solation, and often have I experienced its soothing ef∣ficacy. I was once tenderly attached to a youth, beau∣tiful, virtuous and informed as Horatio. His under∣standing unfolded with uncommon brilliancy; an insatiable thirst for knowledge gave him to pursue, with eagerness, those branches of literature which were proposed to his consideration, and he acquired in his little span, a vast stock of erudition, for which, alas! he had no use in time! From this youth I received even filial attention; but he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off in the bloom of life, and melancholy hours were written for me.</P>
<P>On my b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded knees, with every rising day, I offer up my orisons of devout thankfulness to that God, who hath given my Margaretta to fill up the void in my bosom, which the demise of a youth so beloved had left therein; and I will, ere long, put into your hands a collection of my letters in manuscript, address∣ed to this son of my affection, while he was a student at the academy of—, including a concise view of persons and events; and, in the mean time, as you have already made considerable proficiency in the study of biography and history, I request you, as an
<PB N="108" REF="034162_0454_0FFA655D357447C8"/>
exercise from which will result obvious advantages, to answer me unreservedly, according to the dictates of your deliberate judgment, to the following questions.</P>
<P>First, To which of the heroes, whose actions are re∣corded by Plutarch, you give the preference?</P>
<P>Secondly, Whom you esteem most of all the mon∣archs who have swayed the British sceptre, from the year eight hundred and twenty-seven, which united the kingdoms of the heptarchy, under Egbert, when he was solemnly crowned king of England, unto the accession of George III. to that throne?</P>
<P>Thirdly, What were your sensations as you read, and what are your sentiments of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, Henry IV. of France, Charles I. of En∣gland, and Peter the Great, Czar of Russia?</P>
<P>And, fourthly and lastly, although I do not enjoin you to weigh with accuracy the <HI>murders of a Cortez,</HI> although I expect you will pass rapidly over the pages in which a Montezuma bled, and in which are regis∣tered the massacre of an innocent and defenceless people; yet, my dear, I am solicitous to know whom you characterize as the most amiable of all those ad∣venturers, who, quitting the chalky cliffs of your native land, crossed the broad Atlantic, to obtain establish∣ments in North-America?</P>
<P>It is by the careful investigation of proper, great and virtuous actions, as performed by others, that the glow of emulation is enkindled in our bosoms. We gaze at each transcendent excellence, until our minds acquire n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w energy; they are nerved by fortitude, and we are rendered equal, as far as opportunity calls us forth, to the most consistent and uniform exertions.</P>
<P>The time we devote to the reading of history, or to the perusal of the lives of eminent persons, who have <HI>really acted a part upon this globe,</HI> is indeed <HI>well spent.</HI> It put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us in possession of a fund of knowledge; for a narration of <HI>facts is, decidedly, information;</HI> while the page<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the novelist can, at best, bestow only the light∣er or more trivial embellishments; they originate in fiction, and the pleasures in their gift are as evanescent
<PB N="109" REF="034162_0455_0FFC6D6C8A3CD1B0"/>
as the passing breeze; they may amuse for the moment, but they constitute no <HI>valuable part of erudition.</HI> An ignorance in geography or history, supposing the means of instruction have been furnished, is a just cause of reproach; but I should not blush to acknowl∣edge my daughter wholly unacquainted with a large proportion of those novels, which are daily issuing from the fertile resources of imagination. That my lovely charge may, by every possible means, gain that im∣provement which will render her a valuable member of society, and a truly amiable woman, is the unceasing wish of her maternal friend,</P>

<HEAD>To my honoured MOTHER.</HEAD>
<P>THANK you, my mamma, for permitting me to weep for Horatio; you are in all things indulgent; and I cannot but blush for an expression of sorrow, which is, indeed, unbecoming in a young creature, who has been privileged by receiving your instructions, and observ∣ing your example. I will no more <HI>regret the virtues of Horatio;</HI> but I will endeavour to obtain those ac∣quirements which shall render me a fit companion for him in that world whither he hath flown.</P>
<P>You, my mamma, have often been afflicted, and yet you are cheerful and happy! It will be my pride to tread in your steps, and for two very good reasons; first, I shall thus become amiable and virtuous; and, secondly, I shall give joy to your maternal bosom. To be called your daughter, and to merit, in any de∣gree, that distinction, is my highest ambition; and while I am thought worthy to succeed the beloved child whom you mourn, I shall indeed be the happy Margaretta. The letters which you are to give me, are a new instance of your goodness; my treasures are daily augmenting, and my gratitude ought to be proportioned.</P>
<P>I have again carefully looked over the volumes of biography and history, which I have so lately read in
<PB N="110" REF="034162_0456_0FFC6D6B01483B58"/>
your presence; and, although they are all fresh in my memory, yet I can hardly tell how to give an opin∣ion respecting them, and, but in obedience to the wishes of my Mother, I should not presume to express my sentiments.</P>
<P>Plutarch has recorded so many great actions, that I am almost lost in astonishment while I read his pages; but, after hesitating who, of all his heroes, to name upon this occasion, I have thought that as Aristides so generally obtained the appellation <HI>just,</HI> he must have possessed superior excellence; and, upon attentive∣ly examining his deeds of worth, I cannot say that he did not deserve the title which he received. I am ready to ask, Was not Aristides a perfect character? and, since you have put me upon the comparison, I have taken the liberty to conceive, that there are not many of the English kings worthy to be compared with him.</P>
<P>If Edward VI. had lived, as he was so early re∣markable for virtue and for learning, he might have exceeded all who went before; and I should not then have hesitated in my answer to the second question of my dear mamma. The reply of the son of Henry VI. upon being interrogated by the prince whom he deem∣ed a usurper, relative to his appearance in England, betokened an intrepid mind: But this youth was bar∣barously murdered. Henry VII. was a good king; he is said to have rendered his subjects powerful and happy, and to have wrought a great change in the manners of the people. Henry V. is a celebrated and victorious warrior. The Black Prince is rendered il∣lustrious by many virtues. Goldsmith tells us, that he left behind him a character <HI>without a single blemish</HI>—that time could scarcely alleviate the sorrows occasion∣ed by his death—that his affability, clemency, and lib∣eral disposition, is extolled by many historians; and that, although he was born in an age in which milita∣ry virtues alone were held in esteem, he cultivated the arts of peace, and seemed ever more happy in <HI>deserving praise, than in obtaining it</HI>—<HI>But he was not a monarch.</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="034162_0457_0FFC6D6884158070"/>
Thomson's Edward and Eleonara, has prepossessed my mind in favour of that monarch. Shall I, my mamma, greatly err, if I give the preference to the hero of the poet? Suffer me to point out a few in∣stances wherein I have been charmed with the charac∣ter of that sovereign.</P>
<P>At an early period, when Prince of Wales, he ap∣pears fighting the battles of his father, whose rebellious subjects had taken arms against him. Fired by the insults offered to his royal parents, he pursues and takes vengeance upon them; he submits, with calm resignation, to the hardships imposed upon him, and becomes a voluntary hostage for his father: he extri∣cates himself with great dexterity from the difficulties in which he was involved; he escapes from the am∣bitious Leicester, and suddenly appearing the brave leader of his armies, his presence insures success; he hastes, with filial eagerness, to snatch his father from the threatened danger; he overcomes, in single com∣bat, the rebel Gordon, a veteran trained to arms, and skilled in combat! He does more; for, <HI>good</HI> as he is brave, he obtains his pardon, reinstates him in the king's favour, and restores him to his family and estates! He mourned for his father with true filial sorrow. When he came to the throne, <HI>he might have been despotic; but he contented himself with limited power.</HI> In the midst of danger he discovered great intrepidity; no circumstance could diminish his valour; he was never vindictive but when he conceived the exigencies of the State required it. We are informed, that he added much to the real emolument of his subjects; <HI>that he was solicitous for the tranquillity of the people,</HI> and was seldom arbitrary but with a view to their interest. He was devout, fond of justice, essayed to distribute it indiscriminately, and <HI>confirmed the rights of the people.</HI> Such is the character of Edward I. and yet, methinks, many of his actions were deeply tinged with severity.</P>
<P>To read the life of the Queen of Scots without tears, appears to me impossible. I prefer <HI>Doctor Stuart</HI> to <HI>Doctor Robinson,</HI> and I view Mary as the most injured
<PB N="112" REF="034162_0458_0FFC6D6506091AE0"/>
of women. I cannot regard her as a murderer—I am distressed if she is accused—I am fond of considering her as blameless. <HI>I do not love Elizabeth</HI>—I am aston∣ished to find her at any time the object of admiration; and I feel disappointed, that no remarkable calamity overtook her as a punishment for her cruelty to a woman so unfortunate and so meritorious! The Earl of Murray I detest, nor did I part with a single tear at his assassination.</P>
<P>Henry IV. of France (excuse the arrogance of your girl) was, I conceive, <HI>inferior</HI> to the Duke of Sully. I have been ready to think he owed his greatness, in many instances, to his minister; he is often extricated by him from his difficulties, and saved from the most dishonourable connexions; yet the king is frequently angry with the duke without a cause. Besides, <HI>the king was an apostate;</HI> and the duke of Sully, although im∣portuned by his sovereign, who enforced his arguments by the most splendid offers, preserved his religion inviolate. The duke is tenderly attached to his family, while the king very soon enters into habits of intimacy with persons who were supposed to have procured the death of his mother! nor does he pay much attention to the feelings of his sister! And indeed I am ready to ask, Was not the duke of Sully, as well as Aristides, with∣out a fault? The action of Ravaillac was horrid, and, methought, I felt the wound which pierced the side of the king.</P>
<P>The fate of king Charles has cost me unnumbered sighs and tears. Surely, had the advances which he condescended to make, been accepted, he would have become the father of his people. The heroism of Lady Fairfax, at the trial of the unfortunate monarch, excites my gratitude and my admiration. When the royal sufferer takes leave of his children, and when, for the last time, he presses his in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant son to his bosom, I can scarce control the anguish of my spirit; a sick∣ness comes over my heart, and I feel as if I were about to part with the dearest of my friends. I follow Charles to the scaffold—I attend to the good bishop—
<PB N="113" REF="034162_0459_0FFC6D6268E2C818"/>
I behold the venerable sufferer—I listen to his em∣phatic "REMEMBER"—I see his head extended on the block, his hands out-stretched! and I shudder at the fatal blow!—I turn from the bleeding trophy of rebellion!—I execrate the enemies of the martyred monarch!—I join in the lamentations of the deeply affected spectators; and, I think, I would not be Eliza∣beth of England, nor Oliver Cromwell, although I might thus be raised to the empire of the whole world.</P>
<P>I take pleasure in travelling with the Czar Peter; I admire him while in Holland and England. He was called great—but I had rather he had been less rigorous to his son.</P>
<P>You have taught me, Madam, to venerate the char∣acters of those matchless men, who, quitting their native country, and those commodious habitations where they enjoyed the elegancies of life, crossed the wide Atlantic, and took up their residence in a wil∣derness, where even the articles necessary to their existence were with difficulty obtained; thus encoun∣tering various hardships, for the sole purpose of ob∣taining liberty to worship God agreeably to the dictates of their consciences; and I attend, with superior satisfaction, to the actions of persons, who were thus distinguished for patience, fortitude and piety.</P>
<P>But, when I am required to say which I admire most, I again feel as when making a choice among Plutarch's Greeks and Romans; and I am ready to conceive, that the naming one would render me guilty of disrespect to the rest; yet my mother would not put a question to her girl unbecoming for her to answer, and I cannot but feel a pleasure in accommo∣dating myself to her requests. Mr. Johnson, of Clips∣ham, seems to have exercised himself in acts of kind∣ness towards America; he was an upright and pious man; after his death, the people of Massachusetts evinced the estimation in which they held him, by <HI>directing their bodies, as they departed out of time, to be interred around him.</HI> But the perusal of the life of
<PB N="114" REF="034162_0460_0FFC6D60E4DBF960"/>
Govenor Winthrop has given me inexpressible satis∣faction; he was early distinguished in Suffolk, and his being appointed a justice of peace at the age of eighteen, is a striking proof that he was supposed to possess supe∣rior virtue. He enjoyed an estate of many hundreds a year; but he hesitated not in parting with every thing which was eligible in his prospects, when they were set in competition with his integrity and his religion. Placed, by general consent, at the head of the new formed colony, he was eleven times chosen its gov∣ernor, and it appears that he conducted with prudence and justice. The death of Governor Winthrop, who was styled, the Father of the infant State, caused a general lamentation throughout the colony; and his virtues, it is said, were many, while his errors were few—perhaps he had no superior.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear mamma, have I endeavoured to obey you. <HI>Often attending to conversations passing between my papa and you, on interesting points in history, I have expressed myself with the greater confidence.</HI> I know you will have the goodness to point out my mistakes, and tell me how I ought to think of persons and things, and I request you to write me a separate letter upon each of the subjects you have proposed, and thus add to the number of those pleasing obligations, which you have long been in the habit of conferring upon your ever duteous and affectionate</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have, my love, fully answered my expecta∣tions, and I <HI>pronounce decisively,</HI> (a liberty which you know I seldom allow myself to take) that few young women have made better improvement of their time and advantages than my Margaretta; and, as I am in the habit of gratifying all your reasonable wish∣es, I shall, according to your desire, address you in separate letters upon the principal points to which I have required your attention.</P>
<P>I did not calculate on precision of comparison from my daughter. Plutarch, after carefully collecting the materials for the lives which he hath written; after weighing every circumstance, and digesting them with that admirable regularity in which they are handed down to us, is often at a loss to estimate the <HI>compara∣tive</HI> excellence of his heroes. He narrates particulars, places them in a parallel view, and seems rather to leave the decision to his readers. My purpose, in the exercise which I have exacted, was to insure your ac∣curate attention; well knowing, that the disquisition of a subject, a conference on its merits, and, more espe∣cially, those researches which are requisite to the mak∣ing up of an opinion that we are to commit to writing, is the most probable means of impressing the mind. Besides, we cannot too often contemplate virtuous ac∣tions. Stimulated by the approbation that will, indis∣putably, sooner or later, attend on rectitude, we be∣come
<PB N="116" REF="034162_0462_0FFC6D5A9BBEC880"/>
enamoured thereof, and, aiming at those excel∣lencies which may entitle us thereto, we seek to implant in our bosoms every good and proper principle.</P>
<P>The heroes of antiquity, grouped together, may be considered as a splendid constellation, illumining those tremendous periods, which, fraught with blood and murder, unveiled scenes that seemed to threaten the universal wreck of nature! Lycurgus, the Lacedemo∣nian legislator, evinced his integrity in the most ardu∣ous actions of his life; no difficulties were too great for his enterprizing spirit. Zealous for his country's weal, he endured every hardship; visiting the learned men in various cities, that he might, by their collected wisdom, become qualified to consult the general good. His valour was equal to his love of information. In early life he was proof against the assault of perfidious beauty; he cheerfully resigned royalty; and, although some of his regulations, apparently at variance with nature, may be deemed rigorous and cruel, yet we cannot call in question his probity, nor the light in which he himself regarded his institutions, when we find him voluntarily yielding up his life, in the hope of insuring their perpetual operation.</P>
<P>Solon, the Athenian law-giver, united wisdom and clemency; his philanthropy was demonstrated by his <HI>remission of debts,</HI> and his exempting the <HI>body from seiz∣ure in cases of insolvency.</HI> He abrogated the bloody laws of Draco, and equity was the basis of his pro∣ceedings: He ordained, also, that no one should <HI>speak evil of the dead.</HI> Thespis, the immortal father of the drama, was cotemporary with Solon.</P>
<P>Numa Pompilius was a virtuous prince. He seemed born to humanize the ferocity of the Romans; he cul∣tivated the arts of peace; and his supposed intercourse with the goddess Egeria, giving him the ascendency over the minds of the people, he became indeed a sov∣ereign, and he employed his power for the emolument of his subjects. His acceptance of the royal dignity was in conformity to their persevering importunity, and he justified their utmost confidence. His institu∣tions
<PB N="117" REF="034162_0463_0FFC6D579CD55900"/>
were descriptive of wisdom; he erected public edifices; he shut up the temple of Janus; and, al∣though he exercised sovereignty for the space of forty-three years, this temple was never again opened dur∣ing his reign. Numa exhibited an example of justice, clemency and goodness; and the benign virtues of humanity prevailed throughout his dominions. The sources of contention were cut off; the gentle breezes of complacency were abroad; the healthful and tran∣quillizing occupations of agriculture were diligently pursued; the authority of religion was established; the people saw good days; festivity gladdened their hearts; and amusements, under the auspices of virtue, were established. Italy assumed a face of confidence and contentment; an amicable intercourse succeeded those hostilities which had distracted the land; a per∣suasion of security obtained, and commerce revived.</P>
<P>Valerius became illustrious by his virtues. He was the <HI>friend of the people;</HI> his condescension to their feel∣ings obtained for him the sirname of Publicola. He demolished, without hesitation, the superb mansion which gave them offence; he inverted the <HI>insignia</HI> of authority as he approached their assemblies; thus in∣ferring his reverence for their sentiments, and his ac∣knowledgment of their sovereignty. By these judicious concessions he cut asunder the sinews of envy, and es∣tablished himself in the hearts of the many. He was the first Roman consul that ever mounted a triumphal chariot; and the oration which he delivered at the funeral of Brutus, is said to have originated that cus∣tom among the Romans. Publicola enacted wise and equitable laws, and he communicated to his adminis∣tration the requisite energy. He gave liberty to of∣fenders, condemned by the consuls, to appeal to <HI>the people.</HI> No person could legally exercise any office, who had not been elected by the free suffrages of <HI>the people; and he exempted the poor from any custom,</HI> or <HI>im∣post of any description!</HI> He ordained questors; he exer∣cised himself in acts of liberality; and he was indus∣trious in establishing all <HI>that equality which is consistent
<PB N="118" REF="034162_0464_0FFC6D5615FE18B0"/>
with the regular administration of government.</HI> He was an intrepid warrior; he was victorious over the ene∣mies of his country; he was frequently elected consul; his triumphs were repeated; and he died, honoured and regretted. The Roman ladies, to demonstrate their high sense of the merit of this illustrious citizen, <HI>appeared in black one whole year after his decease.</HI> If Solon's definition of happiness is admitted, <HI>Publicola was happy, for he was virtuous; he served his country honourably as a legislator and a general, and his services were gratefully compensated. He died amid the continued victories of the republic, which had attained respectability under his auspices; and to him is referred the splendor and ancestry of the noble houses of the Publicoloe, the Messalloe and Valerii.</HI></P>
<P>Marcus Furius Camillus bore many honourable of∣fices under the Roman commonwealth. Perhaps, if we except the Decii and the Regulii of the Roman history, it records few, if any lives, that exhibited more uniform and glowing patriotism. He was five times chosen dictator; and his deeds of worth rendered the family of Furia illustrious. The authority which de∣volved singly upon himself, he judiciously communicat∣ed; and when he was associated with others, the ele∣vation of his understanding, giving him to <HI>originate</HI> every seasonable and important regulation, rendered his superiority apparent. It is remarked of him, that he <HI>commanded without envy,</HI> and that his contemporaries <HI>cheerfully</HI> yielded him the <HI>preference.</HI> It was during a contest relative to Camillus, that the Roman ladies evinced their patriotism by parting with their jewels; in consideration of which, a decree passed the senate, that orations should be pronounced at the funeral of meritorious women. The indignation with which Ca∣millus received the infamous pedagogue who betrayed the Falerian youth, basely conducting the students committed to his care into the Roman camp, and his equitable decision relative to the traitor, demonstrates the wisdom and integrity of his character; while his re∣marks, on that memorable occasion, are descriptive of
<PB N="119" REF="034162_0465_0FFC6D525AACD3B0"/>
magnanimity, heroism and rectitude. <HI>War,</HI> said he, <HI>is of itself a sufficient evil; oppression, cruelty and bloodshed are in its train: Nevertheless, the man of probity will still square his actions by the rule of right; he will not accept a victory obtained by perfidy; but he will trust to his own valour to procure for him that decision, which the jus∣tice of his cause may authorize him to expect.</HI> Virtue, as it often happens, was, in this case, its own reward. The unexpected restoration of the Falerian children, with the marks of ignominy bestowed upon the per∣fidious preceptor, were circumstances which enkindled in the bosoms of the well near distracted parents, the most ardent veneration for the Roman character; and while their emancipated sons extolled Camillus as their father, their god and their deliverer, ambassadors were immediately dispatched to the Romans, and an advan∣tageous and a bloodless peace was obtained.</P>
<P>Yet Camillus, at a period when he was involved in the deepest domestic calamity, when the cheek of the warrior was wet with the tears which fell over the early grave of the son of his bosom, became the victim of ingratitude! Arraigned by the ill-founded malice of the people, he anticipated judgment, and only es∣caped an ignominious sentence, by submitting to vol∣untary banishment. But, unlike Coriolanus, during his exile, his good genius still hovered round the city of Rome, and, as her guardian angel, he watched over her for good. The Gauls attacked and destroyed the city, massacreing the senators in their robes of dig∣nity; but the exiled hero was fruitful in resources, and his most arduous efforts were embodied for the relief of his desolated country. As a private soldier, associating with a veteran band, he obtained a signal victory over the common enemy; <HI>and, so sacred did he hold the authority legally appointed, that he refused the com∣mand which he was solicited to assume, until the represent∣atives of the State, then besieged in the capitol, should elect him to that office!</HI> The heroism of an individual pro∣cured the necessary investiture; and, thus armed with <HI>regular powers,</HI> his actions proclaimed the patriot, the
<PB N="120" REF="034162_0466_0FFC6D50D70EC178"/>
hero and the warrior! He led an army against Bren∣nus; disappointed the mercenary views of that Gaul; set the battle in array; obtained a decisive victory; extricated his native city; entered Rome amid the ac∣clamations of the citizens, and was received with every possible demonstration of joy! Camillus rebuilt the city of Rome, and was honoured by the appellation of its second founder. He enjoyed, for the fourth time, that triumph which he had so well deserved! In short, he attained the highest summit of human glory.</P>
<P>Cincinnatus is enrolled in the brightest annals of fame! His magnanimity, his abilities and his moder∣ation merit the sublimest eulogy. Departing from the rural haunts of peaceful virtue, he saved Rome, obtained a triumph, and returned to that retirement, where he had so successfully reared to maturity that noble patriotism, which, in the hour of danger, had nerved his arm, and led him forth to victory!</P>
<P>Cimon, the Athenian, it is said, "<HI>possessed all those qualities that dignify the soul.</HI>" He was zealous for his country's weal; his politics were upright; he was an accomplished general; modest, when raised to the highest employments and most distinguished honours, liberal and beneficent, simple, and averse to ostenta∣tion. He had the glory of <HI>curbing</HI> the vanity of his countrymen, and dissuading them from acting tyran∣nically; and he uniformly inveighed against that pro∣pensity, which taught them to sacrifice virtue to profit, and honour to power.</P>
<P>Philopoemen, <HI>produced in the old age of Greece,</HI> is characterized as the last of her sons. He was an un∣daunted warrior; he trained his countrymen to arms, and led them forth to victory: Many were his valorous deeds; and he continued, through a long life, the de∣termined enemy of tyrants. The integrity of Philo∣poemen was not to be corrupted; and such were the impressions of his rectitude, that no Lacedemonian dared to offer him a bribe. The citizens of Sparta wished to tender him the sums, accruing from the sale
<PB N="121" REF="034162_0467_0FFC6D4D80F5AAA0"/>
of those valuable articles, which had been the proper∣ty of the tyrant whom he had subdued by his valour: But they were aware that much address was requisite, and they committed the business to Timolaus; who, after undertaking it, upon observing the wisdom, jus∣tice, temperance and moderation of Philopoemen, despairing of succeeding, pronounced him superior to seduction, and returned to his employers without exe∣cuting his commission! A second attempt was alike ineffectual; a third trial, however, enabled him to produce the gratuity; when Philopoemen, rejecting the largess, calmly observed to the Spartans, that it would be economical to reserve their gold for those <HI>unprincipled men, whose nefarious purposes</HI> might else ac∣complish the public ruin.</P>
<P>Philopoemen was the eighth time appointed general of the Achaeans, after he had completed the seventieth year of his age! What mortal could achieve he great∣ly wrought: But misfortunes overtook the winter of his days. He was imprisoned by Dinocrates; and when the impoisoned chalice was placed in his hands, he questioned the messenger of death relative to the horsemen who were in his train, and upon being in∣formed they had escaped, he replied with a smile, "<HI>It is well</HI>—<HI>we are not every way unfortunate;</HI>" and, swallowing the fatal draught, uttered not another sen∣tence! The Achaeans revenged his death. The body of the hero was placed upon the funeral pile—the con∣secrated urn received the ashes, and it was adorned with garlands of flowers. Polybius, the historian, conveyed it to his native city. The whole army, drawn up in solemn procession, attended the venerable re∣mains. People, of all ranks and conditions, flocked from the towns and villages, to meet the sad retinue; pressing, with tears and lamentations, to touch and embrace that sacred urn, in which was deposited all that was mortal of him, who had so often delivered them from impending evil. He was interred with ev∣ery demonstration of respect; and statues arose to his memory in all the principal cities of Greece.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="034162_0468_0FFC6D4B59BDB0F0"/>
But Plutarch pronounces decisively, that neither Philopoemen, nor any other warrior, can be compared to Titus Quintius Flaminius, in regard to benefits conferred upon the Grecian States. Titus combined gentleness of manners and piety with his valour. He was steady in his friendships; and his clemency to a conquered foe was exemplified in many instances. He was judicious in his arrangements: deliberation preceded his actions; and his bravery was tempered by wisdom. Being victorious over Philip of Macedon, he left him in the possession of his realm and crown; and he manifested great tenderness to the Etolians.</P>
<P>I pity the reader who is not elevated to a tone of extacy, when, borne on the wings of imagination, he presents himself amid the assembled Grecians, and lis∣tens to the proclamation of the Roman herald.</P>
<P>Greece had been torn by intestine dissensions, and alternately the prey of contending nations. At length, subdued by the Romans, she looked for despotism and bondage. The Macedonians were expelled; they were totally dispossessed of all their conquests in Greece, and their garrisons were, by consequence, re∣moved.</P>
<P>They were without a remedy, wholly at the mercy of the victor. That the Romans would relinquish the cities they had conquered, was improbable; the very idea was infinitely absurd and romantic. Solacing themselves, however, with the prospect of that repose which peace might confer, they prepare to celebrate the Isthmian games. A vast concourse of people are assembled—every heart is replete with expectation—persons of the highest rank mingle in the crowd—a decree is to be promulgated; <HI>a decree of their conquer∣ors; and their fate hangs upon the lips of those who have obtained the power of decision.</HI> Hope and fear alternate∣ly prevail; but the most sanguine expectancy could only calculate upon being indulged with a mild sys∣tem of government. See how the agony of suspense is impressed upon every deeply interesting countenance! Hark! the trumpet sounds—silence is proclaimed—
<PB N="123" REF="034162_0469_0FFC6D48A804CFE0"/>
the herald advances into the centre of the ARENA—he is about to speak—What will he say?—Hush, hush, let not a breath interrupt.</P>
<P><Q><HI>The senate and people of Rome, and Titus Quintius Flaminius the proconsul, having overcome Philip and the Macedonians, declare the Corinthians, the Phocians, the Locrians, the Euboeans, the Magnesians, the Thessalians, the Perroebi, the Achoeans, and Phthiots,</HI> FREE FROM ALL KIND OF SERVITUDE. ALL THESE NATIONS SHALL LIVE IN AN INDEPENDENT STATE, AND BE GOVERNED BY THEIR OWN LAWS!!!</Q></P>
<P>The herald is but imperfectly heard—the multitude is exceeding great—the sudden burst of joy has inter∣cepted and split asunder his sentences—Let him speak once more—a profound silence obtains—Again, with a loud voice, he proclaims, "<HI>The senate and people of Rome,</HI>" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—Not a syllable is lost—not a doubt remains—Gracious God! is it possible?—but they are fully assured of their happiness, and their raised hands and streaming eyes express the unutterable transport of their bosoms! A universal shout of joy succeeds!—a shout, which is resounded by the far dis∣tant shore—their united acclamations split the sur∣rounding atmosphere—and, <HI>Plutarch informs us,</HI> im∣peded, <HI>in their aërial passage, the feathered tenants of the sky!</HI></P>
<P>The Isthmian games are neglected—more elevated and important attentions engross their minds—they crowd around the Roman chief—But description, how insufficient! how totally inadequate as a vest∣ment, to enrobe those exquisite sensations, which this scene embodies and sublimes! Surely, the genius of humanity must lament that Rome ever deviated from a mode of conduct, at once so upright and so splendid.</P>
<P>Leonidas defending the straits of Thermopylae—Epaminondas, the brave victim of heroic patriotism—Pelopidas, his magnanimous friend—Agis, struggling in the cause of virtue, and submitting to death with heroic constancy—Socrates, expiring beneath the stroke

He was highly patriotic; the public good was the prime object of his pursuit; and, to a consideration so im∣portant, he cheerfully prostrated his individual glory; yet, in fact, he thus rendered himself truly illustrious. I regard the action, by which Aristides relinquished his authority to Miltiades, among the most splendid of his life; the consequences were happy; he thus extermin∣ated the noxious seeds of jealousy and contention, which, taking root, gave indications of a plentiful growth; and he taught the Grecian warriors the ad∣vantage of being led to battle by a veteran, experi∣enced in the toils and arts of war; nor could inferior chiefs, thenceforward, refuse to follow an example so evidently productive of general utility. Justice is said to be the most prominent virtue which Aristides pos∣sessed; it raised him from the humble walks of life to the highest honours his country could confer; and the ascendency with which it invested him, giving a colour to the plea, that the liberties of Athens were in danger, became the foundation of that verdict of the <HI>ostracism,</HI> by which he was banished. "Hath Aristides ever injured you?" said the hero, to an illiterate stran∣ger, who, ignorant to whom he applied, requested him to inscribe the devoted name upon the shell. "Not in the least," replied the cynic, "neither do I so much as know him; but I am weary of hearing every where of <HI>Aristides the just.</HI>"</P>
<P>His prayer, at departing from Athens, breathed the true spirit of that kind of philanthropy, which is nearly allied to Deity; and his conduct during his banishment, together with his coalition with Themistocles, taking measures, <HI>from devotion to the public good, to advance to the highest eminence, the reputation of an inveterate foe, gives him an incontrovertible right to that splendid immor∣tality, which is entitled to deathless praise.</HI> Who can set bounds to their admiration, when they behold the enterprising hero, bidding defiance to every danger—forcing his way, at the extremest peril, through the enemy's fleet, and suddenly presenting himself in the tent of Themistocles, not with the language of re∣proach,
<PB N="126" REF="034162_0472_0FFC6D40176D6020"/>
but in a tone that announced the friend of his country, glowing with unabating zeal for her interest, and ready to devote himself to her service?</P>
<P>The virtues of Aristides seem, on this occasion, to have attained the highest pitch of which humanity is susceptible; the intrigues of Themistocles had procured his banishment, and the invidious calumniator was then invested with that authority, to which the services and transcendent merit of the illustrious exile had given him an indisputable title! Yet he is superior to resent∣ment—he takes no retrospect of injuries. The state of Athens is in danger, and he utters not a recriminating sentence! In one word, he approximates to divinity. The concentrated riches of the universe, in the estima∣tion of Aristides, would not have been held as an equivalent for the liberties of Greece; and had he still sojourned in mortality, he would have waged war with her enemies, so long as the sun and the moon endured.</P>
<P>His benign efforts were industriously employed to mollify the enkindling resentments of chiefs, engaging in the common cause; and he gained every thing by his pacific interposition.</P>
<P>His address relative to the disaffected Grecians, can∣not be too much applauded; nor do I conceive, that, in this instance, he sacrificed justice, since the two de∣linquents, against whom he proceeded, were confessedly the <HI>most culpable,</HI> and the rest were referred to the battle, as an ordeal, by which they might silence the clamours of accusation, and produce a conviction that they had never imagined any thing prejudicial to the welfare of Greece. Aristides exemplified both his policy and his justice, by the decree which declared the victorious citizens alike eligible to the offices of government, and which authorized an <HI>impartial election of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the great body of the people.</HI></P>
<P>We find Aristides repeatedly opposing himself to the treacherous policy of Themistocles, and it appears that the Athenians at length knew how to appreciate properly, the abilities and the virtues of those two
<PB N="127" REF="034162_0473_0FFC6D3D34A52858"/>
warriors. I have conceived a design, said Themisto∣cles, which will be of vast advantage to the State, but its success depends upon its continuing a profound secret. Communicate your design to Aristides, cried the Athenians, and we will abide by his decision. The project was, to burn the combined navy of Greece, which conflagration would have invested Athens with sovereignty. But one judgment can be formed of this scheme—it was infamously perfidious. "<HI>Nothing,</HI>" said Aristides, as he gave in his report to the assembly—"<HI>could be more advantageous, and nothing could be more unjust.</HI>" We conceive a high idea of the <HI>integrity of the Athenians, and of their unbounded confidence in Aris∣tides,</HI> when we hear them, without waiting to investi∣gate, command Themistocles to relinquish his purpose.</P>
<P>The dignified condescension of Aristides induced the confederated forces to solicit his acceptation of the general command of their united army; and his matchless integrity constrained the Lacedemonians to supplicate the Athenians, that he might have leave of absence, while he examined, in person, the compli∣cated revenues, and assigned to every citizen their due proportion of the expenses accruing from the general burden of the war. Yet this personage, rendered illustrious by an assemblage of virtues, led a life of poverty, and daily practised a close observance of the most rigid frugality. His candour and moderation were frequently apparent. Themistocles continued the determined foe of his virtues; yet he "<HI>refused to join in the prosecution of that citizen,</HI>" when his practices being unveiled, he was finally accused of capital crimes, and he possessed too much real dignity of mind, to insult him in his misfortunes.</P>
<P>My Margaretta repeats her question, "<HI>Is not the character of Aristides perfect?</HI>" I answer—we have hith∣erto only attended to the fair side of his conduct. Perhaps Aristides attained to as much rectitude of life, as hath ever yet fallen to the share of a being who is subject to the assaults of passion, who is the sport of contingencies, and who too frequently finds himself
<PB N="128" REF="034162_0474_0FFC6D3ABB6E4778"/>
involved in a labyrinth of error. But neither Aristides nor any other <HI>mere mortal,</HI> since the defection of him who was placed in the garden of Eden, hath ever yet been, <HI>strictly speaking, wholly exempted</HI> from the effects of that imbecility, which, from the abovementioned pe∣riod, hath, more or less, pervaded human nature. But Plutarch says, "<HI>that he was firm and steady in his behaviour, immoveable in every thing that appeared just, and incapable of using the least falsehood, flattery, disguise, or deceit, so much as in jest.</HI>" True, he does so, and this very assertion is another proof of the imperfection of <HI>poor human nature.</HI> Plutarch is highly respectable as an historian, and yet his life of Aristides expressly contradicts this summary which he has given us of his character; for, besides that, he seems to adopt the opinion, that the enmity of Aristides and Themisto∣cles originated in an <HI>unwarrantable</HI> attachment, which they had mutually conceived to a beautiful individual. He represents <HI>Aristides the just</HI> as strenuously combating a measure of great importance and advantage, <HI>merely because it had been proposed by Themistocles!</HI> I confess, on this occasion, he acted in contradiction to the general rectitude of his mind; <HI>but he did act,</HI> and a conscious∣ness of the impropriety of his conduct, extorted from him a confession, "that the Athenians would never be safe, <HI>till they threw Themistocles and himself into the Barathrum.</HI>"</P>
<P>I am aware that his matured judgment amply cor∣rected this error; but neither were his riper years en∣tirely free from blame. As a treasurer, he discharged his trust with that integrity which made so essential a part of his character; but upon surrendering up his accounts, being accused by Themistocles, and other nefarious incendiaries, of embezzling the public monies, although he was honourably acquitted by the <HI>chief and best men of the city, and continued in his office,</HI> he affected, during the course of a complete year, an utter derelic∣tion of his former probity; he courted the approbation of those who robbed the public, and passed their ac∣counts, without that equitable investigation and detec∣tion
<PB N="129" REF="034162_0475_0FFC6D385248ADE8"/>
of treachery, to which he had been accustomed. It is true, that upon his second re-election, he thus ob∣tained the privilege of rebuking the Athenians, by the following address: <Q><HI>When I discharged my office faithfully and honourably, I was reviled and disgraced: but now, when I have suffered your treasury to be robbed by these public plunderers, I am admired and applauded at the best of citizens.</HI></Q> It is also true, that this plan might be politic. Athens, thus warned, probably reaped the benefit in her subsequent regulations and appoint∣ments; but surely it is a circumstance which destroys the assertion of his biographer, for he appears during the transactions of a year, <HI>capable of "using falsehood and deceit."</HI> Thus, if we would not be missed, the necessity of an accurate investigation of even the best authors, becomes obvious.</P>
<P>But having adjusted our first point, we proceed to the second. You have very naturally accounted for your predilection in favour of Edward I.; but your favourite poet has enriched the drama, by rendering another English monarch the hero of his production. Alfred the Great was surely not inferior even to Aristides. I will confess to you, my daughter, that I have never read the history of this prince without the most animated and pleasurable sensations. I may be an enthusiast in my admiration of his virtues; but he appears to me to have united in himself every ex∣cellence which can dignify or adorn humanity; and I experience a degree of elevation, in the consideration that this magnanimous monarch was of that order of beings, in which nature hath conferred on me, also, the gift of existence.</P>
<P>Let us, my good girl, take a cursory view of the splendid actions which rendered illustrious one of the most distinguished lives that is to be found in the an∣nals of human nature. The favourite son of a father, who, from misjudging fondness, neglected his education; we find him, at the age of twelve years, ignorant of the lowest rudiments of literature; but the productions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard, recounting the valorous deeds
<PB N="130" REF="034162_0476_0FFC6D36CCAE71D8"/>
of heroes, are rehearsed in his presence, and his noble faculties are roused to action; an ardent thirst of knowledge, and desire of virtue, pervades his bosom, and his <HI>maternal parent</HI> cherishes the princely emula∣tion, which is thus happily originated. The elevated and penetrating genius of Alfred was superior to every impediment. Both English and Latin were soon attained, and his progress in every useful and ornamental study was astonishing. The death of his father placed his brother Ethelred upon the throne, by whom he was deprived of his patrimony; yet, relinquishing at the shrine of public safety, his sense of individual wrongs, he bravely fought the battles of his brother. Providence at length invested him with the sovereign authority; but his dominions were previously reduced to the very brink of destruction, and his pros∣pects were indeed truly lamentable. The progress of the Danes was fearfully rapid. Agriculture was arrested in its most essential operations—the grounds remained uncultivated—the sacred temples were laid in ashes—every resource seemed cut off, and despair, with tremendous aspect, stalked through the desolated land! yet virtue, valour and wisdom united in the person of Alfred—the trio was august—it was equal to the most astonishing achievements—the clouds gradually dispersed—every evil was redressed—and confidence, regularity and felicity were restored!</P>
<P>ALFRED, justly receiving the epithet GREAT, was anointed by Heaven, the deliverer, restorer and pro∣tector of his prostrate country; and although his first onsets were unsuccessful, and the Danes still continued their barbarous ravages, yet no misfortune could repress his heroic ardour; but yielding, for a season, to those melancholy necessities, imposed by an enemy, rendered powerful by successive victories, whose per∣fidy no treaty could bind, and constrained also by the superstitious fears of those few followers who remained, he relinquished the ensigns of royalty, dismissed his attendants, and, clad in a shepherd's garb, he took his way to the cottage of a herdsman, to whom his rank
<PB N="131" REF="034162_0477_0FFC6D3548AAE328"/>
was unknown; where, in this disguise, he continued, impatiently expecting the hour, when he might advan∣tageously present himself, and reduce to practice those preconcerted plans, which were to emancipate his bleeding country. Equal to every situation in life, he supported himself with propriety during this reverse of fortune. Music constituted the prime source of his amusement, and hope illumined his hours. Thomson lays the scene of the most interesting of his dramatic productions, in this rural abode of royalty. The Masque of Alfred opens with a dialogue of the shep∣herd and his wife, respecting the stranger who resided in their cottage. It commences in the following beautiful manner:
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Emma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shepherd, 'tis he. Beneath yon aged oak, all on the flowery turf he lays him down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Corin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soft! let us not disturb him, gentle Emma. <HI>Poor though he be; unfriended and unknown; my pity waits with reverence on his fortune.</HI> Modest of carriage, and of speech most gracious. As if some saint or angel in disguise had graced our lowly cot∣tage with his presence—he steals, I know not how, into the heart, and makes it pant to serve him. Trust me, Emma, he is no common man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some lord, perhaps, or valiant chief, that from our deadly foe, the haughty, cruel, unbe∣lieving Dane, seeks shelter here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Corin.</SPEAKER>
<P>And shelter he shall find. <HI>Who loves his country, is my friend and brother.</HI> Behold him well. Fair virtue in his aspect, even through the homely russet that conceals him, shines forth, and proves him noble. Seest thou, Emma, you western clouds? <HI>The sun they strive to bide, yet darts his beams around.</HI></P>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The succeeding scene between Alfred and the Earl of Devon, is deeply interesting; but as your father intends reading for us this evening Thomson's Alfred, I forbear a continuation of my extracts.</P>
<P>The auspicious era at length dawned, and the dis∣persed Saxons once more rallied round the standard of their prince. But a hazardous enterprize remained;
<PB N="132" REF="034162_0478_0FFC6D2FDBD54650"/>
a knowledge of the numbers and situation of the foe was absolutely indispensable; and Alfred, at a loss to whom to confide an undertaking so important, devoted himself to the perilous investigation! In his rustic habiliments, with his harp in his hand, he passed the Danish lines—amused the soldiers—addressed in the most soothing strains, the admiring officers; and thus procuring an introduction to the Danish prince, con∣tinued with him many days; until, obtaining the requisite information, he departed to that retreat from whence he issued those commands which placed him at the head of an army, resolutely determined to make for their lives and their liberties a vigorous stand! The consequence was glorious. The Danes, astonished to behold again in the field, a power which they had considered as totally annihilated, gave way on every, side; a decisive victory was obtained; and, although those who escaped, again intrenched themselves, yet speedily surrendering at discretion, they experienced the clemency of the conqueror. From this period Alfred continued victorious; a series of brilliant suc∣cesses utterly expelled the treacherous invaders, while the fleet which he appointed, destroyed their vessels, and defended the English coast. It was now that he attained the extreme acme of human glory. His territories were extended far beyond the domain of his predecessors. The Welsh monarchs acknowledged his superiority; the Northumbrians accepted the sove∣reign whom he appointed; no enemy remained; and general peace was restored.</P>
<P>Twelve years of profound tranquillity ensued, and Alfred appropriated this interval to the originating, restoring and establishing whatever could be consid∣ered as contributing to the welfare of his subjects, whom he regarded as his children. The cities rav∣aged by the Danes, were rebuilt; a regular militia, well ordered and equipped, was embodied. He num∣bered and registered the people, and, placing weapons in their hands, he taught them to defend themselves. He divided the kingdom into classes, assigning to each
<PB N="133" REF="034162_0479_0FFC6D2E58ADD348"/>
a respective routine of duty; thus the lands were cultivated, while well appointed and duly regulated bands held themselves in readiness to repel an invading foe. The navy, also, obtained a due share of his foster∣ing care; an able and completely furnished fleet, con∣sisting of one hundred and twenty ships of war, were stationed along the Albion coast; and the English, in this reign, became expert in sailing and in naval en∣gagements; and thus were succeeding incursions ad∣vantageously repulsed.</P>
<P>He next turned his attention to the embellishment of the kingdom which he had thus delivered and pro∣tected; he enacted laws, and established the most judicious regulations. The wisdom of his civil insti∣tutions is highly celebrated. The trial by jury, that grand palladium of justice, is ascribed to him; and to such perfection had he conducted the system which he originated, and so well did the morals of his subjects harmonize therewith, that he is said to have ordered bracelets of gold to be hung up in the high-way, as a challenge to robbers, which bracelets remained in perfect security. He was the uniform friend and patron of literature; this necessarily ameliorated the manners, and humanized the habits of the people. He mounted the throne at a period when his subjects were enveloped in the most profound ignorance. The <HI>character of the age was ferocious;</HI> and the fluctuating state of the English government, together with the depredation of the Danes more especially, impressed upon that nation the features of barbarism. The Latin tongue was almost wholly unknown in England; and Alfred took measures to allure to his dominions the most learned men of Christendom. He renovated the University of Oxford, and conferred on that seminary many privileges. He was truly economical of his own time, regulating his hours to the best advantage, and appropriating them most judiciously: Grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, architecture, and geometry, con∣stituted a part of his studies. He is celebrated as an historian; his knowledge in music is said to have been
<PB N="134" REF="034162_0480_0FFC6D2A79D705A8"/>
respectable; and his poetical talents were in high esteem. He was fond of allegory; he translated from the Greek, the fables of AEsop; and many of his pro∣ductions are handed down to the present day! Thus did the example of the sovereign furnish a powerful incentive to application and improvement. He also liberally encouraged the mechanical arts. His palaces were constructed of brick, and his example was properly influential. He patronized manufactures of every description; and every useful invention, was, by the munificence of the prince, suitably rewarded. Com∣merce and navigation, which he invariably cherished, furnished him with the elegancies of life; and England was at length taught how to appreciate the value of justice, tranquillity and industry.</P>
<P>"It was," says a respectable historian, <Q>after a glorious reign of twenty-nine years thus spent in the advancement of his subjects' happiness, that he died in the vigour of his age, and the full enjoyment of his faculties; an <HI>example to princes, and an ornament to human nature.</HI> To give a character of this prince, would only be to sum up those qualities which constitute perfection. Even virtues seemingly oppo∣site, were happily blended in his disposition; <HI>perseve∣ring,</HI> yet <HI>flexible; moderate,</HI> yet <HI>enterprising; just,</HI> yet <HI>merciful; stern in command,</HI> yet <HI>gentle in conversation.</HI> Nature, also, as if desirous that such admirable qualities of mind should be set off to the greatest advantage, had bestowed on him all bodily accom∣plishments—vigour, dignity, and an engaging open countenance. In short, writers have taken such delight in describing the hero, that they have totally <HI>omitted the mention of his smaller errors, which doubtless he must have had, in consequence of his humanity.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I am sufficiently acquainted with the mind of my daughter, to feel a conviction that her sentiments of ALFRED the GREAT, will be perfectly in unison with those of her tenderly affectionate</P>

<P>THE lively imagination which you, my dear, pos∣sess, together with your exquisite sensibilities, so properly balanced by reason and by judgment, cannot, I think, but be productive of the most pleasing conse∣quences. Your strong emotions as you read, will serve to impress on your mind the events you contem∣plate, and thus you will treasure up a fund, which will, through life, constitute a source of emolument and pleasure.</P>
<P>Your sentiments of Elizabeth are such as her con∣duct to Mary very naturally originate; and it is cer∣tain, that her cruelty to that princess would have stamped, even upon the life of an angel, impressions of guilt, never to be effaced; and yet it cannot be denied that <HI>Elizabeth was capable of dignified actions.</HI> I approve your preference of Stuart. The historian engaged in exonerating from reproach the memory of the dead, is, I conceive, entitled to praise; and I can more ea∣sily forgive the writer, who multiplies or exaggerates the virtues of deceased persons, than he who <HI>imputes to them crimes which, while living, they detested!</HI> The vio∣lence done to Dido, in this respect, cannot, I have imagined, be justified, even by the <HI>license which is al∣lowed to poets.</HI> The best authors concur in represent∣ing Eliza, or Dido, as a most intrepid and magnani∣mous princess. Deprived, by the hand of a barbarous
<PB N="136" REF="034162_0482_0FFC6D26A6E04D10"/>
brother, of the husband of her youth, to whom it ap∣pears she was <HI>fondly attached,</HI> and attended by her sis∣ter and a few faithful followers, she fled from her na∣tive realm; when, encountering with heroic fortitude, the hardships inseparable from her enterprize, she found∣ed, or established, the city of Carthage; she enlarged and beautified it; she inclosed it by a strong wall, and erected in it a citadel; her subjects rapidly increased; she laid the foundation of a flourishing commerce; and her administration combined justice, wisdom and prudence. Her institutions, and the form of govern∣ment which she introduced, are pronounced by <HI>Aris∣totle, the most perfect that had ever been known in the world;</HI> and Polybius informs us, that monarchy, aris∣tocracy and democracy, all concentred therein.</P>
<P>Her attachment to the memory of her murdered husband continued inviolable. Agreeably to the idol∣atrous custom of the times, she ordered divine honours to be paid to him; and while she was indefatigable in her endeavours to promote the advancement of her subjects, she remained wedded to his memory; thus exhibiting a pattern of female delicacy, propriety and faithfulness. A consciousness of the happiness which she communicated tranquillized her bosom, and her life would have closed serenely, but for the interested proposals of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bas, a neighbouring prince, who sought her in marriage. The Carthaginians, fearful of of∣fending their sovereign by an explicit communication of the overture, practised that kind of punic subtilty, for which they were afterwards so remarkable; and the unsuspecting Dido, ensnared by their address, found herself in a situation, which, of all others, she most deprecated. With streaming eyes she appealed to her deceased lord, and, continuing firm to her plighted vows, laying her hand upon her breast, with dignified resignation she pronounced. "<HI>Give me three months for deliberation, and I will go where my own fate and that of my people calls me.</HI>" In this interval the funeral pile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rose, which ascending precisely at the stipulated mo∣ment, she voluntarily relinquished a life, which she
<PB N="137" REF="034162_0483_0FFC6D2419D9A148"/>
could no longer, consistent with the public weal, pre∣serve free from a second hymenial engagement.</P>
<P><HI>This is the Dido of the historian,</HI> and authors ascribe to her uncommon attractions and an <HI>unconquerable chastity.</HI> Yet she is precipitated from the sublime height upon which her achievements and her merit hath placed her, and described <HI>in an immortal poem, which hath been, and will be read by thousands who never look into history, as a lascivious wanton! The slave of imbecility, sacrificing the prime honour of womanhood, and finally becoming the victim of an illicit passion!</HI> Strange as this (I had almost said sacrilegious) violation ap∣pears, our astonishment is heightened, when we learn that some writers deny that Dido was even a cotem∣porary with AEneas! Surely <HI>this licentious degradation of a character, eminent for virtue and abilities, was unworthy the rare talents and acknowledged benevolence of the Mantuan bard.</HI></P>
<P>You will see, my love, as my prime object in these letters is, to engage you in the study of history, that this exordium is not altogether digressive.</P>
<P>Doctor Stuart proposes himself as the <HI>historian,</HI> and not as the <HI>panegyrist</HI> of Mary; and <HI>as his means of inform∣ation were probably as direct and infallible as those of any other writer,</HI> I yield him my <HI>cheerful</HI> and <HI>grateful</HI> cre∣dence. <HI>Mary, as delineated by Stuart, descends to posterity, an interesting and deeply injured princess.</HI> Deprived of her father in the early bud of infancy, the complexion of the times rendered it expedient, that, passing from the care of her mother, she should receive her education in France. The opening powers of her mind autho∣rized the fairest expectations; her disposition was amiably mild, and her understanding was even splen∣did; she was a proficient in elegant needle work; she obtained an accurate knowledge of the Latin tongue; she could converse with propriety and fluency in French, Italian, and Spanish; she attained a high degree of excellence in painting, poetry and music; her dancing was inimitable, and her movements com∣bined a grace irresistibly enchanting. Many writers
<PB N="138" REF="034162_0484_0FFC6D2297F0C0F0"/>
have expatiated on the beauty and elegance of her exterior; and her personal and mental attractions, rendered her charming beyond any woman of the age in which she lived. Her early years passed under the happiest auspices, and her marriage with the Dauphin, opened her way to the highest regal dignity. Mount∣ing the throne of France, she was placed in a sphere which she was well calculated to fill, and her talents and her virtues became properly conspicuous.</P>
<P>But alas! how momentary was the bliss!—the evanescent vision soon fled, and the youthful queen was arrayed in the melancholy garb of widowhood! From this moment she seems marked the daughter of sorrow. The death of her mother rendered her return to Scotland indispensable; and, with an aching heart, she prepared to obey the dictates of duty. Is there, who shudders not, as she receives, while yet in France, the homage of the contending parties? Gladly would we remove her from the toils and tumults of a turbulent administration, and shelter her amid those so∣cial haunts which she would dignify and adorn. Yet, conscious of integrity, and with a heart glowing with the benevolent purpose of appeasing conflicting passions, destroying animosities, and healing every breach, she prepared for her voyage to her hereditary dominions.</P>
<P>Although zealously attached to the religion in which she had been educated, and which was the election of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>per years, yielding, nevertheless, to the popular current, she judiciously placed her confidence in those lords, who were <HI>avowedly in the Protestant</HI> interest; and it appears that all her plans were conciliatory. What a vast accession of care instantly devolved upon her, and what a fearful conflict awaited!!!</P>
<P>Elizabeth—the powerful Elizabeth, nearly allied to her in blood, but the determined foe of her virtues and her pretensions, was irreconcileably offended by the early declaration which had been made of her right to the crown of England; and her inveteracy was apparent in almost every action; but the firmness and penetration of Mary was fully equal to every <HI>open</HI> and
<PB N="139" REF="034162_0485_0FFC6D21154CB2A0"/>
<HI>avowed</HI> attack; and it was only to the studied artifice of dissimulation, that she became a victim. Her answer to Throgmorton, while she continued in Paris, relative to the treaty, binding her to abstain <HI>forever</HI> from assuming the title and arms of England, was at once descriptive of her wisdom and her address, and con∣firmed the favourable ideas which were entertained of her character.</P>
<P>Elizabeth commenced hostilities by denying Mary a safe conduct to her dominions; and the remarks of the Scottish princess on this occasion were spirited and proper. Taking leave of the royal family of France, at St. Germains, she proceeded to Calais, where she embarked for Scotland. And, connecting the deplo∣rable circumstances of her life with its tragical catas∣trophe, our sensibilities are roused almost to agony, as we witness her departure from a scene which had naturally engaged her fondest partialities. The in∣fantile joys, the soft indulgence, and fostering care, which hovered round her morn of life, the felicity and dignity of her wedded days, passed in review before her, and her regrets were proportioned to the pleasures she had experienced—we acknowledge their propriety—we mark the deepening anguish impressed upon ev∣ery feature—we hear her exclaim, as the Gallic shores recede from her gaze, "<HI>Farewel, France! Farewel, delightful country! I leave thee, never to return!</HI>" We listen to the tender iteration; her perturbed sighs vi∣brate upon our ears; the intervening shades of night officiously obtrude; and, with the lovely mourner, we watch the returning dawn; eagerly we catch a parting look, and we seem to inmingle our streaming tears with those of the royal sufferer. Yet we bless the enveloping mist which sheltered her from the em∣issaries of the inhospitable Elizabeth; and when we behold her in her native dominions, amid the acclama∣tions of her gratulating subjects, we become solicitous to deceive ourselves, and we would fain disperse, in these happy presagements, the deep gloom which a knowl∣edge of succeeding events hath thrown about the heart.</P>

For a time, the tenderest considerations gave to the beauteous queen, in the bosom of manhood, an affect∣ing interest! Introduced into being during the calam∣ities of her country—a sovereign in her cradle—expos∣ed to dangers while yet unconscious of suffering—crossing the ocean to receive that shelter her native realm could not afford—now mounting buoyant upon the wings of prosperity, and anon plunged from the highest elevation, and immersed in all the anguish attendant upon the entire wreck of those hopes which reason had authorized! These circumstances endear∣ed her to the bosom of sympathy; while her youth, her figure, her natural and acquired abilities, and the beneficent mildness of her disposition prepossessed al∣most every heart in her favo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. The commencement of her administration demonstrated a depth of under∣standing and a maturity of reflection, rarely to be found in the bosom of youth, beauty and royal birth. To the establishment of the Protestant faith she expli∣citly agreed, reserving only to herself that mode of worship to which she was <HI>conscientiously</HI> attached. Could the most uniform discretion have decided more judi∣ciously? Justice would have awarded the stipulation, and loyalty would have evinced its gratitude by the most cheerful and exact observance. Yet, a fearful storm began to gather; the queen was affronted in the exercise of her religion, and the renewed declara∣tion of her pacific wishes was ineffectual, as a barrier, to the impetuous torrent of ferocious zeal, which was bursting upon her. She proceeded, however, in her tranquillizing plan; and <HI>an attempt at innovation in the established religion was made death!</HI> But still the brutal spirit of the times relented not: Knox proceeded in his inflammatory harangues, and his sovereign was disturbed and insulted! <HI>Nature</HI> pointed out the Lord James Stuart <HI>(one of the leaders of the reformed religion)</HI> as a proper object of the queen's confidence; and she accordingly bestowed upon that nobleman strong marks of her attachment: But alas! he was a wretch, who was seeking to elevate himself upon the ruin of her

from whom he derived his importance. Elizabeth, too, cherished the most malignant passions, suffering her hatred to her rival to reach the extreme of rancorous malevolence! But Mary, although surrounded by in∣veterate foes, who were variously interested in her de∣struction, borne forward on the stream of innocence, and fanned by the gales of conscious rectitude, pursu∣ed her steady and equal course. Strange, that to a conduct not only <HI>unexceptionable,</HI> but highly <HI>meritorious,</HI> the professors of the <HI>mild and peaceable doctrines of chris∣tianity</HI> should unnaturally oppose themselves, <HI>inconsist∣ently</HI> taking rank with the most determined of the queen's enemies! Open, generous, inexperienced and confiding, she embarked against ignorance, bigotry, perfidy and the most ferocious cruelty; and, in a con∣test so unequal, it cannot be matter of astonishment, that she ultimately became the sacrifice.</P>
<P>Many sources of inquietude combined; parties were daily more and more exasperated; the age was infi∣nitely profligate; and events, truly distressing, which human efforts could neither foresee nor prevent, were almost hourly succeeding. The queen, superior to partiality, referred offenders to a court of law, and only interfered by extending her royal clemency, as of∣ten as the safety of her subjects and her personal secu∣rity would admit. The animosities of the disaffected nobles filled her with the deepest regret; whatever party prevailed, joy was a stranger to her bosom; the sympathies which she experienced for the sufferers, barred the entrance of pleasure; and her mind, accus∣tomed to the refinements of science and of reason, the abode of the virtues and the graces, was now, by stern necessity, surrendered up a prey to anxiety, perturba∣tion, and a host of fearful apprehensions. In a situa∣tion thus cruelly embarrassed, she became still more solicitous to secure the amity of the English queen. Negociations for an interview were opened, and on her part, every advance, consistent with regal dignity, was cheerfully and sincerely made. But hatred is a dead∣ly poison, and no emollients can arrest its progress.
<PB N="142" REF="034162_0488_0FFC6D16E714CA90"/>
The nefarious duplicity of Elizabeth was triumphant; and after the place and time of their meeting was ap∣pointed, she had the address to delay, and finally en∣tirely to set aside this desirable event!</P>
<P>Without a friend—destitute of a protector—no guar∣dian hand to point the better way, we spontaneously lament the fate of a woman so young, and so environed by danger. The daring attempt of Chatelard was a specimen of the evils to which she was subjected; but his succeeding punishment should entirely free her from the shadow of suspicion. Proposals of marriage were made her by many crowned heads: while the clashing interests of contending parties, and their consequent intrigues, seemed an insuperable bar to a conjugal en∣gagement. Elizabeth, opposed in every possible situ∣ation to the advancement of Mary, even <HI>exceeded her∣self in adroitness of finesse,</HI> relative to her marriage. She was indefatigable in raising obstacles thereto; and she dictated, remonstrated and objected, in a style so imperious, that if the Queen of Scots had not pos∣sessed unequalled discretion, would have procured an utter dereliction of her conciliatory views; but her reversionary expectations, relative to the crown of England, still kept her true to her system.</P>
<P>At this crisis of affairs, the feminine heart will con∣fess a high degree of exultation, at the view of Mary taking her seat in the great council of the nation. See! she looks, she moves a queen. She is solicitous to imprint upon the public mind the most favourable impressions: All the dignity of majesty is blended with the most benign demonstrations of complacency. She enters the senate-house—the insignias of royalty are displayed—she is richly habited—she is beautiful as the daughters of paradise—she ascends the throne—she addresses the three estates—persuasion dwells upon her lips—and her words are replete wish affection, wisdom and prudence. Lovely woman! how savage and how unrelenting was that premeditated and deter∣mined cruelty which decreed thy ruin!</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="034162_0489_0FFC6D1560F33228"/>
It was at this juncture that the Protestant preachers renewed their clamours; the improvements originat∣ing with the queen, were made to assume the hue of criminality; and even the ornaments of her person became the subject of their inflammatory declamations. With that severe reformer, Knox, Mary condescended to expostulate: He had laboured to procure the con∣demnation of the adherents of the mass! What detest∣able insolence! How cruelly inconsistent would he have rendered the administration of his sovereign! and how insulting were the importunities which directed her <HI>to execute</HI> persons for those religious observances, <HI>which she herself practised,</HI> and from which she derived her most solid enjoyments! Mary represented to Knox the <HI>inclemency of intoleration, and the horrid barbarity of devoting men to death, merely for an opinion.</HI> It is diffi∣cult to conceive of words or ideas more shockingly gross, than those which constituted his indecent replies. <HI>Samuel hewing Agag to pieces; Jezebel's false prophets, and Baal's priests</HI>—these were brutally held up to view, until <Q><HI>Mary, fall of astonishment at the boundless audac∣ity of the man, and too sensible of the insulting freedom of his speech,</HI> burst into tears!</Q> But the zealot persisted to justify his conduct, and she commanded him to depart from her presence. Viewing the Queen of Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as conscientiously attached to the religion of her ances∣tors, we cannot but admire the continued moderation with which she replied to those rude requisitions, that finally insisted on an utter abjuration of her hereditary faith! Yet her firmness remained unquestionable; and she <HI>equitably</HI> determined not to deprive of <HI>life, tranquil∣lity,</HI> nor <HI>estate, merely on account of religious sentiments.</HI></P>
<P>The queen endeavoured to excite the officers, in their different departments, to a performance of their respec∣tive duties, by an augmentation of salaries. She pre∣sided in person in the courts of law, exciting emula∣tion, and accelerating the course of justice; thus dem∣onstrating her early attainments, and her right to the utmost respectability of character. She was solicit∣ous to establish herself in the hearts of her people; and
<PB N="144" REF="034162_0490_0FFC6D1210A951E0"/>
she was laudably ambitious of fame. May the bles∣sing of Heaven rest upon that historian, who hath, at this late period, renewed those laurels, which, plucked by the rude hand of prejudice and superstition, might else no more have wreathed the brow of so meritorious a candidate for excellence.</P>
<P>The revolt of the Earl of Murray was attended with circumstances of aggravated atrocity; but was never∣theless excited and abetted by Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Mary at length effectuated her marriage with Lord Darnley. The exterior of this nobleman was prepos∣sessing, his address captivating, and the queen was tenderly attached to him. It was not a connexion calculated to excite the jealousy of Elizabeth; it was <HI>primarily concerted by herself;</HI> yet it consisted with her insidious policy to <HI>affect displeasure;</HI> and, possibly, <HI>the few halcyon</HI> days allowed to Mary, might be to Eliza∣beth a subject of serious regret.</P>
<P>At this period, the majority of the Scotch preserved their loyalty, and the people in general entertained proper sentiments of the dissimulation and intrigues of Elizabeth. The festivity, consequent upon the royal nuptials, gave place to hostile preparations! The queen, at the head of a formidable army, appeared in the field; the Earl of Murray and his adherents were put to flight, and immediately took refuge in England; while Elizabeth, with her accustomed duplicity, secret∣ly patronized, and ostensibly condemned them. Mary, having thus conducted to an honourable issue an in∣surrection sufficiently alarming, might have tasted the sweets of domestic peace and tender amity, had she not been written in the book of fate, irreversibly un∣fortunate.</P>
<P>Darnley possessed a mind incapable of a refined at∣tachment. His capacity was below a mediocrity! Those superficial accomplishments, which captivate at first sight, soon lose their effect; and Darnley, alas! could not command esteem! He was arrogant, haugh∣ty and jealous; no entreaties could subdue his obstina∣cy; and he was at once inconstant and inflexible, rude
<PB N="145" REF="034162_0491_0FFC6D0FA36B65E8"/>
and contemptible. In short, the queen too late discov∣ered a melancholy truth; and painful experience con∣vinced her that she had made a most unworthy election! But although love, spreading its downy pinions, fled from the bosom of Mary, (and it is too certain that its place was not supplied by esteem) yet <HI>virtue,</HI> regent in her breast, continued the bulwark of her honour. A sense of duty took the lead, and kept her steady in the path of rectitude. It is true, she wept the precipitancy of that step which had decided her fate; but, notwith∣standing Lord Darnley's coldness, and unmerited neglect, although incontestible proofs of his infidelity were frequently furnished, yet she still remembered that he was her husband, and failed not to consider what was due to her own character, as a wife and a queen.</P>
<P>The supposition that Mary was improperly attach∣ed to Rizzio, could only have originated in the dark bosom of prejudice, heated by bigotry, and stimulated by the extremest rancour. Rizzio was old, ugly and misshapen—and "it is a wild absurdity to imagine that the queen would submit to the caresses of de∣formity and old age." His assassination in her pres∣ence, at a time when her interesting situation ought to have engaged the utmost tenderness of her husband, (especially when her high dignity and superior accom∣plishments are remembered) was indeed a barbarous outrage, and must shock even the most phlegmatic feelings of humanity. The subsequent treatment of the queen; the drawn dagger, pointed at her bosom; the tremendous threats which were sounded in her ears; her imprisonment, and the audacious reproaches to which she was subjected; the attempt to infix upon her unsullied honour an indelible stain; and all these atrocities passing under the eye, and sanctioned by the man on whom she had conferred the highest honours, and even raised to a throne—these aggravating circum∣stances rank this black transaction, when considered in all its parts, among the most horrid and enormous crimes which were perpetrated in those days of tur∣pitude and murder. Yet even these deep transgres∣sions,
<PB N="146" REF="034162_0492_0FFC6D0E1FB7EB38"/>
a disposition superior to malignity, enabled the queen to forgive—she consented to a reconciliation with the king—she approbated an act of amnesty—she remitted the offences of the delinquent Murray, who again sought his own emolument in a restoration to her favour—and observing, with an air of dignity, that she utterly detested every species of inhumanity, she nobly sanctioned the act of oblivion.</P>
<P>While the barbed shafts of misfortune were thus piercing the bosom of the Queen of Scots, a white moment was however at hand; and when she ushered into being her first-born son, she in that instant forgot all those sorrows which, with such accumulating weight, had pressed upon her. The birth of the roy∣al infant was celebrated in Scotland by every possible demonstration of joy—while Elizabeth mourned this event, as a serious calamity! Alas! alas! how do the virtues fade in that bosom, into which the deform∣ing fiends, <HI>jealousy</HI> and <HI>envy,</HI> have made their deso∣lating entrance!</P>
<P>At this period, we are again constrained to regret the uniform unworthiness of the king, and his total deficiency in all those qualities inherent in a noble mind. But his haughtiness was still unsubdued! Yet, through all the deepening glooms which he so injudi∣ciously assumed, through all his ungrateful returns to the tenderness of the queen, even to the hour of his melancholy exit, we trace, on her part, a uniform ex∣emplification of prudence and virtue; and we repeat, that the precepts of religion, together with an exqui∣site sense of the delicacy of her situation, and the con∣sideration she owed to virtue and to herself, was, in her bosom, an effectual substitute for that affection which the demerits of the king had banished from thence!—To-morrow, my dear, we will pursue this in∣teresting subject.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>MARY, utterly averse to the departure of the king, opposed it by every proper method; and her condescension, upon this occasion, was truly amiable, truly feminine. But his peevishness and his obstinacy remained invincible, and it was in those in∣teresting moments that he conceived the ungrateful design of divesting Mary of that sovereignty to which she was born—of placing the crown upon the head of his infant son, and of assuming, as his father, that au∣thority he was so ill qualified to maintain. Yet the queen, although apprized of these proceedings, perse∣vered in the mild system she had adopted; and, while her hours of retirement were devoted to sorrow, she continued in public, to disguise her grief by an assum∣ed gaiety; and her elegance, urbanity and native dignity, prepossessed in her favour all those with whom she associated.</P>
<P>The perturbed situation of her mind brought on, however, a dangerous illness: It was apprehended her last moments were at hand: and she yielded herself, with holy resignation, to her fate. The king contin∣ued unmoved, nor deigned, even at the moment when her death was pronounced inevitable, to make her a single visit. But she was restored to health; and in the succeeding indisposition of the king, she exhibited a reverse of conduct, which reflects the highest honour upon her principles and her humanity. Uninfluenced by the remonstrances of those who eagerly solicited her to procure a divorce, her husband's danger awakened the tenderest sympathies of her generous bosom, and she ceased, in the calamity of the moment, to remem∣ber her manifold injuries! Days and months had re∣volved,
<PB N="148" REF="034162_0494_0FFC6D0679F56318"/>
and their lenient influence had blunted her keen sense of the wrongs she had received. She was by nature placable; her anger resembled the passing cloud, which, for an instant, intercepts the mildly beam∣ing radiance of day; and while her streaming eyes evinced her grief, no vindictive passion harboured in her bosom! Her tender melancholy paved the way to the renewal of her affection, and every sense of disobli∣gation, every idea of his inferiority, like the vision of some dark and comfortless night, instantly vanished away. The king too, placed, in his own apprehen∣sion, on the verge of dissolution, experienced the saluta∣ry sensations of remorse; and he reproached himself, in the bitterest terms, for his ingratitude to the queen. The news of his relenting was expeditiously conveyed to her; and all that impassioned tenderness he had originated in her bosom, rushed upon her memory—the felicities of wedded amity—the hour, which in the bloom of youth, and the full perfection of her personal charms, devoted her to Darnley—the lovely infant whom she hourly pressed to her bosom—these inter∣esting considerations obtained in her mind their due weight; and, quitting her palace in the depth of he wintry months, she hastened to attend him; with af∣fectionate assiduity she hovered round his bed of lan∣guishment, and her presence, and her endearments op∣erated as the sweetest solace; the mind of the king became tranquil, and health again glowed in his veins. He accompanied the queen to Edinburgh, and her demonstrations of fond solicitude were unwearied.</P>
<P>It was at this juncture, that the nobles, who, by an aggravated representation of the king's offences, had cherished the resentments of the queen, apprehensive that the consequences of the reconciliation between the royal pair would be destructive to themselves, contriv∣ed and perpetrated the murder of the king! The supposition that Mary was accessary, consenting, or even privy thereto, is devoid even of the shadow of probability; It was forged in the dark haunts of igno∣rance and credulity; and it is confuted by a circum∣stantial
<PB N="149" REF="034162_0495_0FFC6D04F50B21D0"/>
series of well attested facts—by the mildness, moderation, tender sympathy, and genuine piety, which were conspicuous traits in the character of the queen—by the testimony of many who endured the extremest torture—by the dying asseverations of all those who were executed for this crime—and by the declaration of Bothwell, who, having dragged out a number of years in close imprisonment, in his last moments made a complete confession of his own guilt and her innocence. The anguish, horror and consternation of the queen▪ at the fatal intelligence, were equal to the enormity of the crime which had been perpetrated; and she affirm∣ed, that if her kingdom and her life were the forfeit, all those who had procured a catastrophe so shocking, should be prosecuted to the death. She called on her assembled nobles to assist her in her just purpose, of delivering up to condign punishment, offenders so atrocious; and, with streaming eyes and heart-affect∣ing earnestness, she conjured them to leave no means unessayed, which might involve the remotest probabil∣ity of a surrender so important. She pathetically la∣mented, that in a moment, when the sunny beams of hope had revisited her bosom, when the clouds, which gathered round her prospects, had began to disperse, and the serene pleasures of domestic life were opening to her view, she should thus fatally, by the audacious hand of guilt, be overwhelmed in sorrow, and consign∣ed over, the hapless victim of a transaction, dark, une∣qualled, and tremendous!</P>
<P>The circumstances attendant upon the king's death, were sufficient to enkindle in the bosom of humanity the keenest regret: and to this cause the extreme de∣jection of Mary is to be attributed. The most af∣fectionate and meritorious of men could not have been lamented with more unequivocal demonstrations of grief. Immured in the deep recesses of her castle, she resigned herself to the most lively sorrow: her apartments were hung with black; the light of the sun was excluded; and the faintly burning taper but served to mark the glooms which hovered round her.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="034162_0496_0FFC6D0370784788"/>
But emerging at length, from this extreme of grief, she adopted the most vigorous measures for appre∣hending the regicides. Many circumstances produced in her mind a persuasion, that the conspirators had aimed at involving her in the king's death, and her orders for the prosecution were unequivocal and ab∣solute. The sum of two thousand pounds, together with an annuity for life, was tendered to any individ∣ual who should give information of the perpetrators of this horrid transaction; and this largess, with the addition of a free amnesty, was proffered to the con∣spirator, who should make an unreserved disclosure of his own guilt and that of his accomplices. In conse∣quence of this proclamation, placards were affixed in various public places, accusing the Earl of Bothwell, and others, as the murderers; but as those papers and placards insinuated, that <HI>the queen herself had been a party concerned,</HI> she very justly estimated their innocence by her own. Bothwell, solemnly attesting his integri∣ty, loudly demanded a trial, and he inveighed bitterly against his calumniators; no positive proofs were ad∣duced of his guilt; the Earl of Lennox alone appeared against him, and not a single witness to corroborate the charge was produced. The queen's council <HI>affect∣ed</HI> to consider Bothwell as the subject of rancorous malice; the <HI>principal nobility warmly espoused his cause,</HI> and they charged the Earl of Lennox with acting un∣der the influence of the most ignoble passions. The queen had frequently remarked that Lennox was sus∣picious, revengeful and passionate. The defamation, in such general circulation, might probably result from his arrangements; and besides, the impression that the assassin was armed against her own life also, being indelibly infixed upon her mind, a design so atrocious, with respect to her, could not consist with the unbroken fealty, and uniform homage, which the conduct of the Earl of Bothwell had invariably exem∣plified. Bothwell was, however, brought to a public trial, and the jury acquitted him of all share in the king's murder! I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this judgment is an evidence of
<PB N="151" REF="034162_0497_0FFC6D00F92136B0"/>
their criminality; if it is viewed as a mockery of law and justice, however ignominious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may be deemed, it cannot arraign the conduct of the queen; nor can she, by any rational construction, be involved in its guilt. Circumstances, relative to the criminality of Bothwell, which have since transpired, were then en∣veloped in mystery; yet, that there existed presump∣tive proofs, sufficient to justify the strongest suspicions, cannot be denied; and, moreover, his licentious habits forcibly pointed the public odium.</P>
<P>The queen remained in entire ignorance of the de∣signs formed upon her by Bothwell; his behaviour indicated, in her apprehension, nothing more than that respectful attachment which was due to his sovereign; she was grateful for his zealous exertions to promote her interest; she regarded him as a man of talents; and she allowed him that consideration, which she conceiv∣ed due to his abilities. Her unprincipled nobles, however, industriously seeking her ruin, agreed, amid the tumultuous riot of a banquet, to point out this man of crimes as a proper person to become the husband of their sovereign! and they ratified a deed, in which they extolled the integrity of Bothwell, the antiquity of his lineage, and the essential services he had render∣ed the state. They expatiated upon his trial for the murder of the king, upon his subsequent offer to meet his accuser in single combat, affirming them to amount to a perfect justification of his innocence; and they declared themselves fully convinced of his integrity.</P>
<P>Bothwell was now in the precise situation at which his audacious wishes had long pointed. His subse∣quent seizure of the queen was the finishing stroke, and fully completed his nefarious climax of villany. Mary's infinite astonishment at so daring an act of pre∣meditated violence, from a man whose submissive man∣ners had given her the highest idea of his respectful fidelity, and the bitterness and indignation which she expressed, corresponded exactly with the whole tenor of her preceding life. Her resentment was the resent∣ment of outraged virtue, and her reproaches character∣ized
<PB N="152" REF="034162_0498_0FFC6CFDCE270FE8"/>
the queen and the woman, offended in a manner <HI>too atrocious to be forgiven.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto we have contemplated Mary as an orna∣ment to humanity. She hath struggled with many evils—she hath frequently been deeply injured—but she hath passed the ordeal brightened by calamity. Her dis∣cretion, her fortitude and her perseverance have given her to emerge from every cloud; and from the hour of her birth, to the era now under contemplation, while there hath been an ample field for commendation, there hath been little to extenuate. <HI>Would that we could blot from the history of Mary, the name of Bothwell.</HI> Over a connexion so fatal we would drop the curtain. <HI>Surely, surely, it ought never to have taken place</HI>—<HI>it was, in every view, improper! Delicacy, virtue, and all those considera∣tions which are peculiarly sexual, receive, by this transac∣tion, from the most lovely and deserving of women, a fatal stab! and the tearful eye of humanity weeps over the many woes to which it was introductory.</HI> If Mary possessed no means of escaping from the captivity, in which she was held by Bothwell, she should have repelled, to the utmost of her power, every act of personal violence; and those injuries which she could not avoid, would neither have contaminated her mind, nor infixed a stain upon her honour. <HI>The reception of the unprincipled offender, as her husband, sanctioned his guilt; and, in this instance, effectually prostrated her own character! Mary should have died, rather than have taken this step!</HI> The bond, obtained from the nobles, may, and undoubted∣ly does, <HI>greatly palliate the business;</HI> but a high degree of culpability remains. Alas! alas! this is an indeli∣ble stain, nor can any process, however ingenious, re∣move from a character, which impels both our love and admiration, a spot which female dignity will not cease to deplore! We cannot, <HI>in this particular,</HI> agree with the elegant historian of Mary; nor can we acknowl∣edge, that "<HI>recent terror</HI>" (especially if those terrors are produced by the <HI>nefarious practices of an audacious offender</HI>) the more readily disposeth the mind to give admittance, in favour of the violator, to the softer passions.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="034162_0499_0FFC6CFB723C2B20"/>
But we dwell with pain on this part of the career of our heroine. The sun, we know, admits of spots; and no human being, we have already concluded, is exempt from error. The calamities which, from this period, in rapid succession overtook, and finally whelmed beneath their combined pressure, this inter∣esting unfortunate, if they cannot <HI>obliterate,</HI> do, never∣theless, <HI>abundantly expiate;</HI> and it should ever be re∣membered, that she was encompassed about by subtil and designing adversaries, who sought their own exal∣tation in her destruction! who, notwithstanding the solemn instrument with which they had armed her seducer, delayed not to embody their adherents; and after taking every method to blacken the reputation of their sovereign, thereby exciting against her the pub∣lic odium, made haste to appear in arms, for the pur∣pose of opposing her authority! It was not enough that they had confederated to strip her of fame and tranquillity; she must also be despoiled of her crown and sceptre, and abridged of that liberty, which is the nat∣ural right of every human being! With humid eyes we have attended to the forlorn sufferer! we have marked her perturbation, her distress, and the humili∣ating insults which she received from him, who had become her husband! his rude, indecent and brutal behaviour has excited our utmost indignation; we have beheld those reiterated indignities and calam∣ities, arming the hand of the despairing queen against her own life! and we have unhesitatingly exclaimed—Surely, there is no species of suffering to which she is not subjected! Her separation from the finished vil∣lain, who had so treacherously betrayed her, and her voluntary surrender to the confederated nobles, fur∣nished a temporary relief; while their respectful recep∣tion of, and flattering address to their sovereign, soothes, for a moment, our fondest wishes for her restoration. Had the least spark of humanity or integrity remained among them, the queen had been saved. But it was a dissolute age; the reign of perfidy had commenced; black clouds gathered; and the storm advanced, tre∣mendously terrific!</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="034162_0500_0FFC6CF9EDA96460"/>
We follow the queen to her imprisonment; we be∣hold, with glowing resentment, the fresh insults to which she is subjected; we mingle our tears with the sympathetic multitude, who lament the degraded maj∣esty of their sovereign! we listen to her sorrows; our attachment to the beauteous mourner is augmented, and we are ardently solicitous to snatch her from im∣pending danger! The renewed duplicity of the no∣bles fills us with detestation and horror; yet we can scarcely forbear to do homage to that credulity and "<HI>beautiful humanity,</HI>" which characterized her, even in the most melancholy situations of her life. By the ma∣chinations of her enemies she was now completely envi∣roned—<HI>letters from her to her seducer were forged</HI>—and she was, alas! irretrievably undone. See! she is stripped of her robes of royalty!—she is meanly attired!—she is closely immured within the walls of a prison!—and she is committed to the custody of a person, <HI>who from powerful motives is predisposed to heap upon her every species of the bitterest mortification.</HI> The triumph of Eliz∣abeth was at length complete!—her insidious prac∣tices had procured the downfal of her meritorious ri∣val, and a detail of the real or supposed errors of Mary, vibrated upon the ear of the English queen, as the sweetest music.</P>
<P>By a series of enormous cruelties, matchless rude∣ness, terrifying threats, and various species of barbari∣ty, the Queen of Scots was compelled to sign deeds, which contained a resignation of her authority, and the perturbed anguish of her spirit, while affixing her name to instruments, which she deigned not to read, is beyond the power of description. The visit of the Earl of Murray to the royal prisoner, opens a scene of art, perfidy and cruelty too black for contemplation! Accomplished villain! thy ingratitude, and thy crimes to thy sovereign, must render thee a subject of detes∣tation to the latest posterity!—Horrid traitor! how is the honest mind agonized by the feelings to which thy transgressions give birth; and how effectually hast thou secured thine own infamy, by labouring to tra∣duce
<PB N="155" REF="034162_0501_0FFC6CF79DE9A760"/>
the source from whence thou derivest thy exalta∣tion! Was not Mary thy sister, as well as thy sovereign? Didst thou not know, notwithstanding that solemn robe of sanctity in which thou wrapped thyself about, that thy nefarious ambition and enormous practices would bring down upon thy devoted head a fearful ruin? Couldst thou suppose that those lascivious ex∣pressions, of a <HI>coarse, irregular and illicit passion,</HI> which thou inserted in those execrable letters, so atrociously forged for thy sister and thy queen, could be passed upon the world as the production of that <HI>elegant, in∣formed and polished mind which inhabited the bosom of the injured sufferer?</HI> Could <HI>prudence, chastity, and every vir∣tue, which can give dignity to our sex, so suddenly become lost to honour, play the wanton, and utter the most profli∣gate sentiments in a language only adopted by beings grown old in vice, and attaining the last stages in the career of in∣famy?</HI> These considerations are of themselves suffi∣cient to fasten upon thee, the guilt of forgery, in those vile scrawls, with which thou attempted to affix upon thy royal mistress imputations of the darkest hue; but, separate from these, the proofs now standing up∣on the page of history, while they establish (in the ap∣prehension of the <HI>impartial investigator</HI>) beyond all controversy, the innocence of the queen, stamp the strongest conviction of thy infamy and thy ingrati∣tude.</P>
<P>"<HI>Those letters,</HI>" says the able historian, <Q><HI>are in di∣rect contradiction to the tenor of the queen's life, and to the testimony of undoubted monuments of history.</HI> The friend∣ship of the nobles for Bothwell; his murder of the king; his eagerness for a trial; their protection of him; his acquittal; their bond, inculcating his inno∣cence, and pressing the queen to take him for her hus∣band; her conveyance to Dunbar; her seduction; her marriage; their rupture with him; their permission of his flight; their accusation of him in his absence; their attempt to involve her in his wickedness; their rebel∣lion; the indignities with which they treated her; her imprisonment; her forced resignation of the crown;

the elevation of Murray to the regency; and, in fine, the project of the letters, as the apology of their own proceedings, and the evidence of her guilt—<HI>These transactions, so particular, so united, and so concurring, are all the parts of a system which carries in its bosom the full conviction of their deep deceit, their unprincipled profligacy, and their intrepid and sanguinary ambition. They were now to achieve the last act of their drama; and by the death or utter humiliation of the queen, to secure their future tranquillity.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The execution of Bothwell's servants, who, notwith∣standing the attempts to render them accusers of the queen, departed protesting her innocence, and declar∣ing, in the presence of Almighty God and his attend∣ant angels, that they conceived the Earls of Morton and Murray, the procurers, through Bothwell's in∣strumentality, of the king's murder—furnish, if it were wanting, abundant confirmation of her integrity and of the guilt of her adversaries.</P>
<P>Mary's escape from Lochlevin, and from her ma∣lignant blood-thirsty soes, diffuses over the tragical page a momentary gleam. We bless the sensibility of the youthful Douglas—we hail the emancipated queen, and we would gladly dwell upon the narration of her short-lived triumph!—The act of amnesty, which, with such unparalleled clemency, she tendered to transgressors of so deep a die, was exactly conform∣able to that divine benevolence, which gave a lustre to all her actions. But nothing less than her utter ruin could complete the sanguinary views of her virulent adversaries. The queen, urged by the impetuosity of her council, submitted her cause to the issue of a bat∣tle. An event judging world hath condemned this pro∣cedure, as injudicious—her faithful adherents were de∣feated—and the victory obtained by the regent, was completely decisive!!! Our sensibilities are infinitely agonized, while we take a view of the desolate suffer∣er, who beheld from a rising ground the flight and slaughter of her friends; and no words can delineate the sorrows by which she was overwhelmed. Hope,
<PB N="157" REF="034162_0503_0FFC6CF0F4777908"/>
that had so recently dawned in her bosom, now bid her a pangful adieu! Despair assumed the regen∣cy, and fearful apprehensions surprised her soul.</P>
<P>Arriving, by hasty and perturbed movements, at Dundrenan, under the pressure of unequalled grief, she commenced her melancholy deliberations! In this forlorn condition, whither could the lovely wanderer direct her way? This was the pathetically interesting question. To abide in Scotland, was, in her idea, certain death!—To retire to France, which had witnessed her days of splendor, in her present state of humiliation, the thought was replete with anguish. Application had been made to Elizabeth, <HI>who had practised her wonted finesse</HI>—she had <HI>soothed</HI> Mary during her captivity—she had solicited her to seek the means of escaping from imprisonment, and to accept an asylum in her domin∣ions—she had promised her she would meet her on her way—that she would receive her with all those demonstrations of amity due to their consanguinity, and to that affection she professed to entertain—and she had presented her, as a memento of her amity, a ring of great value.</P>
<P>Mary, naturally confiding and gentle, was yet more softened by affliction: She regarded Elizabeth as a friend in adversity; and the impressions made by acts of kindness, at such a period, are efficacious and per∣manent. She estimated the mind of Elizabeth by that transcendent generosity and genuine benevolence which was ever glowing in her own bosom; and she hasted to make the perilous experiment! The Lord Herries and the Archbishop of St. Andrews, on their knees remonstrated against her resolution to depart for Eng∣land—but they remonstrated in vain. Embarking, in a fatal hour, she crossed the stream, and appeared sud∣denly in the dominions of a queen, who had, for many succeeding years, been assiduous in her efforts to em∣barrass and distract her councils—who was the con∣firmed enemy of her fame and person, and who had invariably received and succoured her most deadly foes!!!!</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>HUMANITY, my dear girl, must lament Eliza∣beth's depraved politics, as they related to the Queen of Scots. Whatever question involved the interests of Mary, seemed to possess the power of rous∣ing to action the most nefarious propensities—of nar∣rowing her views, and of yielding her up to the do∣minion of envy, jealousy and every ignoble passion! When the Queen of Scots, soothed by the recent expressions of commiseration which had been transmit∣ted her by Elizabeth; and allured by the <HI>tender appel∣lation, sister,</HI> confided in that sympathy which is con∣stantly prompting the efforts of delicacy, and origi∣nating those acts of kindness that are calculated to succour and restore the children of adversity—when, notwithstanding the mystery which too often envel∣oped the conduct of Elizabeth, Mary evinced her noble
<PB N="159" REF="034162_0505_0FFC6CEB585F6528"/>
and unsuspecting nature, by seeking shelter in her kingdom; by electing her the arbitress of her fate, and committing her dearest interests to her decision—Elizabeth was then furnished with a most desirable opportunity of erasing from the annals of her admin∣istration, every deforming trait; of removing the odium which rested upon her transactions relative to her royal kinswoman; and of insuring to herself the unbounded applause and veneration of posterity. Her unfortunate rival was sufficiently humbled; and by the indissoluble ties of love and gratitude, she might have bound the gentle and affectionate Mary forever to her bosom.</P>
<P>Elizabeth, in her own dominions, was nearly des∣potic; she maintained an ascendency in the Scottish councils: It would have been easy for her to reinstate the Queen of Scots upon her throne; and such a pro∣cedure would have been princely, it would have been great, and nobly worthy the combined claims of sex, of kindred, of misfortune, and of Queenship! It would have been an action suited to the majesty of the sovereign of a powerful and gallant nation. But if Elizabeth could not soar so high, had she marked the arrival of Mary by those tender offices of friendship which are the balm of life—had she received her as her guest, yielding her those honours which were due to her rank—had she exercised her authority and in∣fluence to render her situation eligible—had she indul∣ged the lovely mourner with those intercourses of amity, which in every period of her life were so com∣pletely in unison with her feelings—the sorrows of her heart had been assuaged; we should have regarded Elizabeth with complacency, and sought for the mo∣tives of her limited kindness, in that policy, to the ob∣servance of which, the exigencies of state may fre∣quently condemn the philanthropic mind.</P>
<P>But the conduct of Elizabeth was unsexual, unjust, and infinitely cruel. The desolate queen, rudely de∣nied admission to her presence, was condemned to perpetual imprisonment; and Elizabeth, while she was
<PB N="160" REF="034162_0506_0FFC6CE8E3847FB0"/>
ingenious in devices to hold her suffering captive in the most agonizing suspense, assayed to justify her inhos∣pitable rigour, by pleading those crimes with which she stood charged by her audacious subjects! Yet the queen of England had caressed the Scottish nobles, when deformed by ingratitude, and recent from the haunts of rebellion! whose hands were imbrued in blood, and on whose lives were infixed the deepening stain of guilt!</P>
<P>Mary, in the anguish of her spirit, solicited for an interview—conscious of her innocence, she only wished to be heard; but, alas! no sympathy pervaded the bosom of Elizabeth—she triumphed in the misfortunes which she was assiduously employed in accumulating; and that dignified arrangement which would have restored an outraged and an afflicted queen to the ample and unalienated possession of her hereditary honours and prerogatives, found no place in her delib∣erations! Pity she could not have known that by acting the part of a sister and a queen, she might have en∣wreathed her brow with a garland, the perfume of which would have been immortal; but she chose to proceed in the crooked path she had so perversely entered.</P>
<P>The Earl of Murray was encouraged to accuse his sovereign before the English queen, while Mary stood astonished at the presumption of that princess, who interpreted her wish to narrate in a personal interview her misfortunes, and to exculpate herself from the calumnies of her rancorous foes, into a desire of a public trial, and a submission to her jurisdiction! What heart but bleeds at the perusal of a letter ad∣dressed by the Scottish princess to the malevolent Elizabeth.</P>
<P><Q>I came into your dominions to ask your assistance, and not to save my life. Scotland and the world have not renounced me. <HI>I was conscious of innocence—I was disposed to lay all my transactions before you; and I was willing to do you honour, by making you the restorer of a queen. But you have afforded me no aid
<PB N="161" REF="034162_0507_0FFC6CE650340688"/>
and no consolation. You even deny me admittance to your presence. I escaped from a prison, and I am again a captive. Can it expose you to censure to hear the com∣plaints of the unfortunate? You received my brother when he was in open rebellion. I am a princess, and your equal, and you refuse me the indulgence.</HI> Permit me then to leave your dominions. Your severity encourages my enemies, intimidates my friends, and is most cruelly destructive to my interests. You keep me in fetters, and allow my enemies to conquer my realm. I am defenceless, and they enjoy my author∣ity, possess themselves of my revenues, and hold out to me the point of their swords. In the misera∣ble condition to which I am reduced, you invite them to accuse me. <HI>Is it too small a misfortune for me to lose my kingdom? Must I also be robbed of my in∣tegrity and my reputation?</HI> Excuse me if I speak without dissimulation. In your dominions I will not answer to their calumnies and criminations. To you, in a personal conference, I shall at all times be ready to vindicate my conduct; but to sink myself into a level with my rebellious subjects, and to be a party in a suit or trial with them, is an indignity to which I can never submit. <HI>I can die, but I cannot meet dishonour. Consult, I conjure you, what is right and proper, and entitle yourself to my warmest gratitude;</HI> or if you are inclined not to know me as a sister, and to withhold your kindness, abstain at least from rigour and injustice; be neither my enemy nor my friend; preserve yourself in the coldness of neutral∣ity; and let me be indebted to other princes for my establishment in my kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>How pathetically interesting, how modestly digni∣fied, and how characteristic of the amiable writer. But Elizabeth remained unmoved; the enemies of Mary were inspirited, sanctioned and patronized, while the interposition of her friends was wholly disregard∣ed. Commissioners for the trial were appointed, and they were directed by Elizabeth to proceed in such a manner, as to infix upon the reputation of the Queen
<PB N="162" REF="034162_0508_0FFC6CE4B62D4EF8"/>
of Scots an indelible stain! Yet in the course of their investigation, incontestible proofs of her honour press∣ed upon them, and they could not but commiserate a princess so unfortunate. The deputies of Mary insist∣ed that she should be heard, but their remonstrances were disregarded. "<HI>An accusation,</HI>" said they, "<HI>is given; the person accused is anxious to defend herself; this privilege is denied to her, and yet a demand is to be made for the vouchers of her guilt! What is this but an open violation of justice?</HI>" Thus was every measure cruelly calculated to deepen the distress of the Scottish queen. Tremendous was the crisis she had obtained—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ick darkness overshadowed her—of crimes of the deepest dye she was accused, and <HI>pretended proofs</HI> were on the point of being produced! Had she been <HI>conscious of guilt, she would have shrunk from the ordeal,</HI> but she <HI>im∣plored</HI> and <HI>demanded</HI> permission to confront her adver∣saries; and this <HI>privilege,</HI> this <HI>important request,</HI> this <HI>right,</HI> was barbarously denied her! The artifice and duplicity of Elizabeth succeeded but too well; for al∣though no formal decree was obtained, yet upon the credit of papers proved (by <HI>internal conviction, and a se∣ries of incontestible facts,</HI>) atrocious forgeries, an attempt was made to stamp upon the public mind a lasting impression of Mary's guilt. Mary insisted that the determination of a cause which had obtained such gen∣eral attention, ought to be a verdict of guilt or inno∣cence; and with agonized earnestness she still pressed to be heard; nor can her unyielding, intrepid, and proper remonstrances, be understood in any other view than as corroborating proofs of her integrity.</P>
<P>Elizabeth's final determination not to admit the pleadings of Mary, is agreeable to the whole tenor of her behaviour to her royal prisoner; and having ban∣ished all compunction from her bosom, she dreaded to appear before that innocence she had consigned to de∣struction. <Q>She was sensible of the eloquence, the high spirit, and the address of Mary; and while she trembled to oppose herself to these, she apprehended, as more terrible in so illustrious an assembly, the in∣terest
<PB N="163" REF="034162_0509_0FFC6CE3333CED98"/>
of distress, the dignity of unmerited misfor∣tunes, and the pride of injured integrity. She was alarmed with guilty terrors; the image of a hated rival in the moment of victory haunted her; and her disturbed imagination painted the lofty de∣meanour of the Queen of Scots—her indignant emo∣tions, and the lightning of her eye. She could not think of consenting to a measure, where she had ev∣ery thing to lose, and nothing to gain; and she was too wise to exhibit herself an open and detestable monument of spleen, disappointment, perfidiousness, rivalship, jealousy and anger.</Q></P>
<P>Thus did Elizabeth sacrifice true glory to her pas∣sions. Had the Queen of Scots been less beautiful, less accomplished, and less meritorious, she had not become the victim of hatred and perfidy. When it is remembered that the ingrates who appeared to ac∣cuse their sovereign, absolutely stood charged by the Earls Huntley and Argyle, as the abettors of the king's death, and that the expectation of the formal presentment of the protestation of the two Lords, ac∣celerated the dismission of the murderers from the court of Elizabeth, it will excite equally our astonish∣ment and our indignation; and humanity will blush at a transaction, which perhaps has not a parallel in the annals of history!</P>
<P>In the midst of those dark clouds in which Eliza∣beth was seeking to envelope the Scottish princess, her beauty and various accomplishments made upon the duke of Norfolk an indelible impression; and, con∣vinced of her innocence and her integrity, he sought with impassioned ardour to obtain her hand in mar∣riage; but to indulge Mary with the soothings of am∣ity, would have been a mitigation of her fate, that came not within the plans of Elizabeth; and at the moment when the mutual esteem of this illustrious and amiable pair had ameliorated into the tenderest love, the attachment of the duke of Norfolk proved his ruin, and he lost his life upon the scaffold, while the innocent object of his preference was subjected to
<PB N="164" REF="034162_0510_0FFC6CDDCB64DEC0"/>
fresh indignities! At this period, to pronounce in the presence of Elizabeth, the name of the Queen of Scots, was sufficient to distort her countenance by all the fren∣zy of passion; and the Earl of Huntington, interested in procuring the death of Mary, was associated with her more humane keeper! he was ferocious, and un∣feeling, and his commission authorized his inhuman severities! her distresses were to Huntington matter of exultation—her favourite domestics were torn from her—the number of her servants were curtailed—the most scrutinizing watch was set upon her conduct—or∣ders were issued for intercepting and conveying to the queen of England, letters written in the confidence of tender friendship; and if her prison should be surround∣ed with a force adequate to her rescue, Huntington had directions to assassinate her!!</P>
<P>The Earl of Murray renewed and continued his traitorous practices. He had covenanted with Eliza∣beth to surrender to her the son of Mary, whom she was solicitous to involve in the ruin of his mother, and to receive from her the Queen of Scots, with full lib∣erty to inflict upon her whatever indignities might suit his wishes—when he was arrested by the dart of death. Nor do I wonder that my Margaretta shed no tears at his exit. His talents, though exercised in the most criminal practices, were great; and these, with a prepossessing exterior, opened his way to that dignity, of which he was eminently unworthy. Yet a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his death, Mary, pious and affectionate, lamented a brother, whom she considered as launched into eternity under the pressure of unparalleled guilt.</P>
<P>The enormities of which the English queen had been guilty to the Scottish princess, enkindled in the bosoms of foreign princes the deepest resentments; but their remonstrances served only to call into action the ad∣dress and perfidious dissimulation of Elizabeth! The death of Mary was only wanting to fill up the measure of her wrongs; and although even her enemies, who witnessed her behaviour, declared that the <Q>candour, sincerity, and moderation, which she displayed, were
<PB N="165" REF="034162_0511_0FFC6CDC48C3BE70"/>
full assurances to them that on her part <HI>there was no occasion to apprehend any improper policy or art;</HI></Q> yet pretences to effectuate her ruin were industriously sought and embraced. Mary, in the midst of her mis∣fortunes, still remembered that she was a queen; no im∣proper concessions escaped her; the severities exercised toward her, produced no undue humiliation; her mind retained its native magnanimity; <Q><HI>and she pitied the ty∣rant who could add contumely to oppression, and deny her even the comforts of a prison.</HI></Q> Elizabeth, and her courtiers were daily affecting to discover plots, and machinations; every nefarious purpose was imputed to Mary; and the English queen was indefatigable in her endeavours, to impress upon the public mind, a per∣suasion that her existence, and the prosperity of the realm, were incompatible with the emancipation of the Queen of Scots. Mary had flattered herself that when years should permit her son to assume the reins of government, and to act decisively, her sorrows, through his intervention, would know a period; and this maternal hope operated upon her grief worn mind, as the sweetest solace. But Elizabeth had been careful to implant in the mind of the prince the seeds of distrust and animosity against his royal parent; and while she excited and countenanced the rebellion of his subjects, she directed and awed his councils, and through her influence the embroidered garment which his moth∣er, in the dreary solitude of her prison had finished for him, together with the jewels which she had intend∣ed as a memento of her affection, were returned, with indecent marks of disrespect!!</P>
<P>Elizabeth was pursuing with the son the same track which had produced the ruin of the mother; and <HI>forged</HI> letters were employed by her ambassador, Ran∣dolph, for the purpose of depriving him of the confi∣dant whom he loved. Under such accumulated evils it is not matter of astonishment that the health of the captive queen was rapidly declining; yet, although the most pressing representations on this subject were made to Elizabeth, they were ineffectual to procure her the
<PB N="166" REF="034162_0512_0FFC6CDAC0153D80"/>
smallest abatement of the rigours of her confinement! She was unfeelingly denied the presence of the friends who would have soothed her sorrows! and she was even refused the means of taking that air and exer∣cise, on which her existence seemed to depend!</P>

<P>THE intelligence of the seizure and imprisonment of her son to which the intrigues of Elizabeth had largely contributed, was a fresh stab to the unfor∣tunate queen; and from her letter to Elizabeth, produ∣ced by this event, I cannot forbear a few extracts. <Q>I am informed from undoubted authority, that my son has been surprised by rebels; and I am tortured with apprehension, lest he should be reduced to the peculiar infelicities of that situation under which I have suffered so long.</Q> After some expressions de∣scriptive of her just indignation, she adds—<Q>since equi∣ty and right must stoop to the tyranny of your scep∣tre, I shall carry my appeal to the eternal God, <HI>whose dominion is over all the princes of the earth.

from Lochlevin, and was about to give battle to my rebellious subjects, I dispatched to you, by ex∣press, the diamond which you sent me, as a token of your love; and I craved your aid. I thought that what I had received as a pledge of your affections, would awaken them; and, when you bestowed it, I was not only flattered with large promises of your assistance, but you even bound yourself by your royal word, that if I should betake myself to your domin∣ions, you would advance to your frontiers and meet me in person. I fondly relied upon your honour; and, in my adversity, I took the resolution to throw myself into your arms, and to commit to your pro∣tection my diadem and my person. <HI>But I was rude∣ly stopped upon my journey, encompassed with guards, and confined in strong places; and, from the first moment of my captivity, to the present hour, I have endured afflic∣tions more bitter and grievous than death itself. Twelve tedious months have passed since all communication between my son and me, either by letter or messengers, has been in∣terrupted. You are studious to tear asunder the nearest and the kindliest ties of nature, and to separate and di∣vide a mother and a son!</HI> Is it fair or reasonable that I, <HI>who am a mother,</HI> should be restrained not only from giving council to my son, but that the distresses of his condition should be artfully concealed from me? <HI>Let me beseech you by the cross and the passion of Christ our Redeemer, that you will bind to yourself him and me, in everlasting gratitude, by permitting me to re∣fresh my decayed body somewhere out of England, after the languors of so long and painful, a confinement.</HI> For me, this world has lost its greatness; and if a prison is still to be my lot, if I am to know no joy on earth, do not interrupt and oppose me in my hopes of heav∣en. Let me have a Catholic priest to direct me in the road to another life, and to perform to me the offices of that religion in which, I have lived, and in which I am to die. <HI>Reassume the natural kindness of your disposition; soften your displeasure to a princess who is so nearly related to you in blood; attend at length to

my just complaints; let a tender reconciliation take place between us; let not the groans and sighs of my afflicted soul ascend any longer unto God; and let me depart in peace from this scene of sorrow.</HI></Q></P>
<P>James would gladly have associated with his mother in the government of Scotland; but Elizabeth nefari∣ously opposed plans for the establishment of Mary, which she herself, to answer a then present purpose, had originated. The rebels of Scotland boldly urged their claims upon Elizabeth, by affirming that they had lost the confidence of their sovereign, and their patrimonial inheritance in consequence of their combinations in her favour! That Mary was eager to emancipate her∣self from the tyranny and cruelty of Elizabeth, is be∣yond a doubt. A queen, detained in prison, and bar∣barously treated, while her virulent adversaries are permitted to ravage her native realm—A mother, sep∣arated, during twenty revolving years, from a son, whose opening mind she had wished to form, embraces with ardour, every proposition by which she may hope to return to her dominions, be restored to the exercise of her royal prerogatives and to her maternal duties—These were the crimes of which Mary, during her cap∣tivity, was assuredly guilty; and upon this foundation was raised the superstructure of that process, which, procuring her death, terminated gloriously for herself, and blasted with eternal infamy her malignant adver∣sary. The cruelties exercised towards Mary in her prison, is an outrage to humanity; any instance of be∣nevolence or pity, exhibited to the Scottish queen, was construed into a breach of fidelity to Elizabeth, and her flatterers became emulous in acts of cruelty; while a hope was entertained that the aggravated calamities to which the royal prisoner was subjected, would pre∣cipitate her upon some rash action, by which she would become in reality a criminal. But her integrity re∣mained inflexible; and her upright mind, nerved by conscious innocence, engaged with ardour in the habits of piety; and, supported by the consolatory truths of religion, continued greatly superior to the detestable
<PB N="169" REF="034162_0515_0FFC6CD2104563D8"/>
plots fabricated for her destruction. Her adversaries were enraged at the inefficacy of their diabolical ar∣rangements; and, frustrated in their most sanguine purposes, Leicester, prime minion to Elizabeth, dis∣patched assassins to seize, in the gloomy recesses of the prison, that life which had been subjected to such a se∣ries of calamities!</P>
<P>But here, even the virtues of those hard-hearted sav∣ages, Paulet and Drury, made a stand! They spurned the emissaries of Leicester, and felt the degradation to which they were subjected. Yet, notwithstanding they stopped short of death, they were in the exercise of the utmost rigour. Her apartments, but two in number, were poorly furnished; neither were they sufficient to shield her from the inclemencies of the weather; and, that they might inflict on her every species of indigni∣ty, they rendered her prison a receptacle for common offenders; confining in her view, a young man, whom, after much persecution, they deprived of life, without judge or jury! They were industrious in cutting off every avenue, which could possibly become an inlet of pleasure to the unoffending victim of their rigour. Through the medium of a servant, she had indulged the benevolence of her nature, by a regular distribu∣tion of charity among the sons and daughters of want, who abode in the vicinity of Tutbury Castle! And who but must execrate that unequalled inhumanity, which, having discovered, sternly denied even this soothing, alleviation of her unparalleled woes?</P>
<P>But Elizabeth had not yet attained the summit of her wishes; and, persevering in her atrocious career, her obsequious parliament gratified her by an un∣precedented statute, which made <Q><HI>a sovereign and in∣dependent princess answerable for her conduct to the sub∣jects of another potentate!</HI></Q> Thus was the way open for the accomplishment of that tragical catastrophe, at which the sanguinary views of the English queen had so long pointed; and it only remained to involve the Scottish princess in real or <HI>suppositious</HI> guilt. To ensnare and betray the injured sufferer, arts the most
<PB N="170" REF="034162_0516_0FFC6CD061B67A58"/>
exquisitely iniquitous were employed; nor was any temptation left unessayed, which might allure her in∣to practices against the dignity and life of Elizabeth. Babington's conspiracy presented a favourable occa∣sion, and every probable measure was embraced to engage her therein; but her virtue and her discretion remaining inaccessible, was proof against every as∣sault; and <HI>forgery</HI> became once more the <HI>dernier resort</HI> of her implacable foes! Letters were written for her, to which she was an utter stranger; and upon those letters were founded her trial and subsequent execu∣tion!! Her closet was rudely broken open, without her previous expectation of such an event, and her cabinets, borne to Elizabeth, were examined in her presence; yet, amid the multiplicity of papers they contained, to the no small regret of her enemies, <HI>a criminating syllable was not to be found!</HI> The magna∣nimity and genuine dignity, with which Mary replied to the commissioners appointed to proceed against her, astonished and confounded even her most deter∣mined foes. "It is," said she, with admirable com∣posure, <Q>a matter altogether uncommon, that Eliza∣beth should <HI>command me to submit to a trial, as if I were her subject.</HI> I am an independent sovereign, and will not tarnish, by any meanness, my high birth, the princes my predecessors, and my son. To speak to me of commissioners, is a vain mockery of my rank. <HI>Kings alone can be my peers.</HI> The laws of England are unknown to me, and I have no coun∣sellors, to whose wisdom I can apply for instruction. My papers and commentaries have been taken from me; <HI>and no person can have the perilous courage to ap∣pear as my advocate.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The desolate captive persisted in denying the au∣thority of the commissioners, yet she was aware that they would, notwithstanding, proceed to her trial; and a sweet hope of obtaining that triumph, to which her integrity entitled her, induced this truly interesting sufferer to wave for a moment her hereditary queen∣ship, and to appear before the tribunal of those usurp∣ers,
<PB N="171" REF="034162_0517_0FFC6CCEDEB4FA28"/>
who were predetermined to condemn her. Dig∣nity, modesty, majesty and innocence, were strongly pourtrayed in the <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of her defence; and an attention thereto must wring sympathy from the coldest heart that ever beat in a human bosom. "The accusation," said she, <Q>preferred to my preju∣dice, is a most detestable calumny. I was not en∣gaged with Babington in his conspiracy; and I am altogether innocent of having plotted the death of Elizabeth.</Q> After having produced irrefragable proofs of her integrity, she adds—<Q>I will confess that I have yielded to the strong impulses of nature; and that like a human creature, encompassed with dan∣gers, I have exerted myself to recover my greatness and my liberty. The efforts I have made can ex∣cite no blushes in me, for the voice of mankind must applaud them. Religion, in her sternest moments of severity, cannot look to them with reproach; and to consider them as crimes, is to despise the sanctimonious reverence of humanity, and to give way to the suspicious wretchedness of despotism. But the attainment of my kingdom, the recovering of my liberty, and the advancement of that religion which I love, could not induce me to stain myself with the crimes which are objected to me. I would disdain to purchase a crown by the assassination of the meanest of the human race. To accuse me of scheming the death of the queen, my sister, is to brand me with the infamy which I abhor most. It is my nature to employ the devotion of Esther, and not the sword of Judith. But amidst the inclement and unprincipled pretensions, which my adversaries are pleased to invent, to overwhelm me with ca∣lamities and anguish, I can trace and discover the real cause of their hostility and prosecution. <HI>My crimes are, my birth, the injuries I have been compelled to endure, and my religion. I am proud of the first, I can forgive the second, and the third is a source to me of such comfort and hope, that for its glory I will be con∣tented that my blood shall flow upon the scaffold.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="034162_0518_0FFC6CC84D87B308"/>
The soul-affecting pleader evinced her exquisite sen∣sibility and deep sense of gratitude, when, during her trial, reference being made to the Earl of Arundel, with streaming eyes she pathetically uttered the mem∣orable exclamation, which has been so often cited: <Q><HI>Alas! alas! how much has the illustrious house of Howard endured for me!</HI></Q> Beauteous and deeply wronged mourner! never was calamity more dignifi∣ed, never was sorrow more ennobled! In vain did she solicit permission to justify herself before the Brit∣ish parliament, or Elizabeth and her privy council. Her enemies continued deaf to her solicitations, and with unprincipled effrontery, under the sanction of a legal process, in which the greatest outrage was done to justice, sentence of death was passed upon the Queen of Scots! nor was the execution of this unprecedented sentence long delayed!!</P>
<P>Measures were taken to procure the consent of James to this violation of hospitality, decency, and nature! But the proposal filled him with astonishment, grief, indignation and remorse. He spurned, with filial de∣testation, every suggestion upon this head, and hasten∣ed to dispatch to Elizabeth the most spirited and re∣sentful representations, upon the enormous violence of her proceedings. Foreign princes also, struck with the utmost consternation, and infinitely shocked at the im∣perious presumption of Elizabeth, presented her, upon this melancholy occasion, the most pressing remonstran∣ces; but nothing short of the death of Mary could sat∣isfy those baleful passions, which had obtained a tre∣mendous ascendency in her bosom. Mary received her sentence with uncommon satisfaction, and even triumph! She however regretted, that she could not obtain the attendance of a clergyman of her own per∣suasion! But submitting to necessity, she still preserved her equanimity; and when her keepers poorly deprived her of those tokens and insignia of royalty, by which she had till then been distinguished, she calmly said, <Q><HI>In despite of your sovereign, I will die a queen—my royal character is indel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le; and I will surrender it with my
<PB N="173" REF="034162_0519_0FFC6CC6CA02ED60"/>
spirit, to the Almighty God from whom I received it, and to whom my honour and my innocence are fully known.</HI></Q> She disdained to supplicate for life; and her last let∣ter to Elizabeth is descriptive of piety, resignation, he∣roism, and the utmost elevation of mind.</P>
<P><Q><HI>I am happy, Madam, that I am arrived at the last stage of my long and lamentable pilgrimage. My fate, though altogether unmerited, I shall encounter with cheerfulness.</HI> There are now a few circumstances only which at∣tract my attention; and for those it is proper that I apply directly <HI>to yourself.</HI> In England, which has de∣parted from the true religion, I cannot hope to be interred with the kings, our progenitors, according to the ceremonies of the Catholic church. In Scot∣land, the sepulchres of my ancestors have been pro∣faned and violated. When my enemies, therefore, have glutted themselves with my blood, I entreat, that my remains may be carried by my domestics to France, where the bones of my mother are deposited. There, my body, which never knew any quiet while my soul was united to it, will rest in peace. As my second request, I beg that I may not be abandoned to the secret tyranny of my adversaries. They may consume me with lingering torments; or, what I dread more, they may sully my fame with foul slan∣ders. Let my execution be public, that there may be undoubted witnesses, who may bear testimony to my firmness in my religion, and make an honest re∣port of my dying agonies. It is my third request, that my servants may depart out of your dominions without molestation, and that you will permit them to enjoy the legacies which I am to bequeath them in my testament. These favours I implore you to grant, <HI>in the name of Jesus Christ; by our consanguin∣ity; by the soul of Henry VII. our common progenitor; by our royal dignity; and, by the respect which you bear to our sex!</HI> It will please me to receive an answer from you: Nor accuse me of presumption, that, while I am leaving this scene of things, I take the lib∣erty to remind you, that you are not to live forever;
<PB N="174" REF="034162_0520_0FFC6CF79DE9A760"/>
<HI>and that there is a tribunal, before which you must ap∣pear, to render an account of your proceedings against me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The silence of Elizabeth to these requests, and the comfortless and alarming suspense in which that silence involved Mary, would, had the unprecedented cruelty of the English queen admitted an aggravation, have given the finishing touches to her system of barbarity! Mary, however, continued to possess an astonishing measure of internal tranquillity; and her firm affiance in Jehovah remained a never failing source of consola∣tion. Elizabeth, with an air of levity, signed the death-warrant of the Queen of Scots; yet, fearful of the consequences, she sought, by renewed application to the dagger of the assassin, to remove from herself the public odium. Through the instrumentality of Davidson and Walsingham, she recommended it to the keepers of Mary, <Q><HI>to shed privately the blood of their royal prisoner! Though a sovereign princess, and entrusted with the cares of a great nation, she blushed not to give it in charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her ministers, to enjoin a murder! and this murder was connected with every circumstance that could make it most frightful and horrid. The victim for whose blood she thirsted, was a woman, a queen, a relation! who was splendid with beauty, eminent in abil∣ities, magnanimous under misfortunes, and smiling with innocence!</HI></Q></P>
<P>The manner in which Mary, on her bed of languish∣ment, received the annunciation, that the ensuing morn∣ing was appointed for her execution—her characteristic remark thereon—her dignified composure amid the rude and unfeeling insults to which she was subjected—the elevated strains in which she assayed to comfort her weeping domestics!—her serenity at supper!—the ten∣der leave which she took of her servants!—her amia∣ble condescension and pious counsel—her letters to her friends—her adjustment of her testament—her solemn devotions—her peaceful and saint-like slumbers—the serenity of her morning preparation—her distribution of her wardrobe and jewels—her reception of the eu∣charist
<PB N="175" REF="034162_0521_0FFC6CC380B00298"/>
—the fervour of her kneeling devotions—her raised eyes, clasped hands, and soul-affecting attitude—the holy confidence with which she poured into the ear of Deity, her sufferings and her wishes—the heavenly serenity with which she presented herself to the high sheriff—her address, when coming forth, to Melvin, who had for many days been prohibited her presence; <Q><HI>Lament not, honest Melvin; but rather exult that thou shalt see Mary Stuart delivered from all her woes. The world, my good Melvin, is but vanity; and an ocean of tears would not suffice to bewail its sorrows.</HI></Q>—The en∣viable composure and self-command with which she deported herself, while subjected to the shocking inso∣lence of the Earl of Kent—the graceful dignity with which she advanced to the scaffold!—her majestic car∣riage—the mingling emotions of commiseration, rev∣erence and admiration, which pervaded the bosoms of the attending spectators—the fortitude with which she ascended the scaffold, surveying, with inimitable benig∣nity and heart-piercing tranquillity, the block, the axe, and the executioners!—the streaming eyes of surround∣ing witnesses, exhibiting a contrast to her unexampled heroism—her gentle mildness, amid the shameful indig∣nities and unbecoming insults, which were heaped up∣on her by the Dean of Petersborough—the augment∣ing lamentations of her men and women servants, and the <HI>impressive manner</HI> in which she urged their silent submission—her recommendation of queen Elizabeth to the protection of the Almighty!—her maternal rec∣ollection of her son—her energetic address to the Re∣deemer of the world!—her last adieu—the astonishing serenity with which she placed her neck upon the block!—All, and every of these circumstances, form a climax, which is greatly worthy of the life to which they constitute so magnanimous a close!</P>
<P>Elizabeth, ere she struck a blow so fatal to her own reputation, should have recollected, that the atrocious deed could not be consigned to oblivion; that it would descend to posterity in all its horrors! that, at the tri∣bunal of succeeding generations, her exquisite dissimu∣lation
<PB N="176" REF="034162_0522_0FFC6CBECDD18190"/>
would avail her little; and that, stript of the false colours, in which she attempted to evade the pub∣lic odium of this black transaction, the murder which she contrived to perpetrate, would be considered in all its deformity! The perturbed sensations, sighs, groans, and deep anguish, which marked the concluding hours of Elizabeth, and which operated so forcibly as to ex∣tend her, for the ten succeeding days and nights imme∣diately preceding her exit, upon the floor of her apart∣ment, exhibit a striking contrast to that serenity which illumined the parting moments of the Queen of Scots, and forcibly point the difference between the sensations of that mind, which, stained with guilt, becomes the abode of remorse, and the calm reflections of the bosom which hath cherished the propensities of integrity, and in which white-robed innocence hath delighted to dwell.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that Elizabeth resigned with her life, all pretensions to that crown, of the titles and succession of which she was so tenacious; that the son of Mary mounted the English throne; that a princess, lineally descended from her, in the fourth generation, had the glory of uniting and consol∣idating the realms of England and Scotland, under one general government; and that, if we except the usurpation of Oliver Cromwell, the British sceptre hath, from the death of Elizabeth, been continually swayed by the posterity of the Queen of Scots.</P>
<P>Desirous, my dear Margaretta, to delineate to you my sentiments, together with the reasons on which they are grounded, I have engaged in a more copi∣ous detail than I had designed; yet it may lead you to an accurate study of an interesting piece of history; and I shall not dilate so largely upon our remaining subjects. I am charmed with the elegance of your translation from Madame Dacier. Your Achilles seems to weep his Patroclus dead, in all the dignity of grief; and your improvements give complete satisfaction to the bosom of your truly affectionate mother,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is of importance to form just ideas of per∣sons and things, I advise you, my dear, to give Sully's Memoirs a second perusal; and, that you may do this both with profit and pleasure, I proceed in my cursory remarks.</P>
<P>You ought, my love, to consider that the Duke of Sully was, <HI>comparatively,</HI> a private man. Henry was born for a nation, and the duke was born for the king. Henry undoubtedly possessed the talents of a great warrior and a great monarch—Sully was an able minister of incorruptible fidelity and uncommon dis∣interestedness. But while we do justice to this illus∣trious statesman, we cannot, however, regard him as a faultless character; we think the treachery and dissim∣ulation by which he obtained from the Count of Sois∣sons, and the Princess Catharine, their marriage con∣tract, was highly reprehensible; nor are we quite satis∣fied with the duke of Sully for so frequently holding up to public view the dissensions of the royal pair. He too often unveils his hero; he dwells too circumstantial∣ly upon that part of his character in which alone he was vulnerable. It is true the importance of the minis∣ter is thus augmented, but this does not diminish our disgust at the recital; and when he relates <HI>so much,</HI> and with an affectation of delicacy, pretends to <HI>conceal a great deal,</HI> lest it should obscure the lustre of his master's glory, the imposition becomes grossly palpa∣ble; we lose sight of the uniformly faithful servant, and behold only the ungenerous and absurd egotist.</P>
<P>Sully, it must be confessed was always at hand to extricate, but he is not <HI>therefore</HI> invested with a <HI>general</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="034162_0524_0FFC6CBAA6F53C70"/>
superiority of character. The mind <HI>impassioned,</HI> and debilitated by any <HI>particular circumstance,</HI> becomes, in the <HI>moment of imbecility,</HI> unequal to cool deliberation; and, amid the hurricane of the passions, it is incum∣bent upon the man of reason to point the better way, If Henry's displeasure at his minister was frequently without a cause, his resentments <HI>appeared to him</HI> just; and when investigation discovered his error, his frank acknowledgments were worthy his character; and the noble condescension with which he invariably sought a reconciliation, was an abundant compensation for any vehemence of passion to which his ardent na∣ture subjected him. Constantly the first to condemn himself for every intemperate act or expression, he delayed not the reparation, which was always as am∣ple and explicit as language could render it; and he declared that consequent on every amicable eclaircisse∣ment his slumbers were more sweet, and he esteem∣ed the adjustment of these grievances as an addition to his felicity. We cannot deny, that if the value and importance of the minister was thus demonstrated, a most enchanting idea of the frankness and candour of the monarch is also given. Henry was aware of the natural vehemence of his disposition, and his good sense was constantly arming him against the inroads of passion. He was fully sensible of the errors into which the angry man is often precipitated; but virtue nerved his bosom, and he successfully opposed the as∣saults of impetuous rage. A series of calamities, to∣gether with his innate sensibility, invested him with self command. Reason took the lead, and every resentful impression submitted to her dictates; he became mild by habit, and reflection rendered him uniformly just.</P>
<P>Generosity was inherent in his soul; and his innate consciousness of superiority, while it was far removed from the <HI>debasing effects</HI> of self partiality, invariably taught him to disdain a malicious or ignoble action. Sully observes, that Henry <Q><HI>never forgot to reward any additional trouble by some new instance of his bounty, and that every proof of kindness made upon his mind an
<PB N="179" REF="034162_0525_0FFC6CB7AFE083F8"/>
indelible impression;</HI></Q> and indeed his liberality was on all occasions truly princely.</P>
<P>No, my dear—Sully was not the principal artificer of Henry's glory; nature had early marked upon the mind of the youthful prince the features of heroism; his face was an index of his mind, and an elevation of expression and a prepossessing frankness formed its general contour. His manners were insinuating and full of vivacity; and even in the commencement of his career, his virtues and his talents extorted the approbation of all who knew him; while his bravery and his military abilities rendered him the soul of his party. Henry cannot be justly charged with a want of tenderness, because Sully's memoirs preserve no record of his regrets on account of the death of his mother. It should be remembered that at the demise of the queen of Navarre, Rosny did not occupy that place in the king's bosom, to which his merit after∣wards introduced him. Catharine de Medicis was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stress of sufficient address to garb her treacherous and bloody politics in the alluring habiliments of respectful kindness; the Queen of Navarre, her family and adherents, were effectually deceived; nor did the wisdom, experience and remarkable penetration of the Admiral de Coliquy, escape the snares which had been laid with such exquisite dissimulation.</P>
<P>The massacre of St. Bartholomew, which may be principally charged to Catharine de Medicis, will al∣ways stand prominent in the list of bloody transac∣tions. Neither high birth, riches, virtue nor talents, were a protection from the fury of those licensed mur∣derers, who were inhumanly let loose upon an unsus∣pecting multitude! Peaceable and unarmed, the de∣fenceless inhabitants imagined themselves in the utmost security, when, in one tremendous moment, the horri∣ble destruction commenced. More than ten thousand persons, with circumstances of aggravated and unpar∣alleled cruelty, were barbarously butchered! and so comprehensive was the infernal mandate which au∣thorized this shocking carnage, that it extended even
<PB N="180" REF="034162_0526_0FFC6CB4319B99A8"/>
to infants at the breast. The streets ran with blood; and, "<HI>kill, kill, massacre, the Huguenots,</HI>" was the watch-word of the furiously zealous Catholics! That Henry, in a catastrophe so deeply tragical, should feel his individual griefs absorbed in the national infamy, in the national calamity, is a circumstance which evinces the patriotism of his character; and it became him also to oppose, to the unprincipled and insidious designs of Catharine de Medicis, a plan which might serve as a barrier to those mischiefs she still contem∣plated. Henry was in no instance deficient in sensi∣bility. His sister had made an unworthy choice, and it became him, as her sovereign and her brother, to di∣rect and point her confidence; nor can his fraternal attachment with propriety be questioned.</P>
<P>Henry's first reception of Rosny does honour to his feelings, to his gratitude, and to his liberality; and if he was blest with an able minister, his minister also was amply recompensed. The confidence which the king reposed in Sully, was a proof of his wisdom and penetration; for it was the regularity and economy of the youthful candidate for his favour, which first ad∣vanced him in the esteem of his sovereign; and this election, in a monarch, young, brave, impassioned, and in some instances devoted to pleasure, fully evinced the solidity of his understanding. But a fondness for order seemed inherent in the bosom of Henry—<Q><HI>He was born with the virtues and method of economy, and therefore practised them without constraint.</HI></Q> He dis∣tinguished judiciously; and, discriminating characters with the utmost precision, while he divested falsehood of its glare, he seemed to possess a kind of intuitive knowledge of truth.</P>
<P>His martial genius, intrepid bravery, and full pos∣session of military talents, in all their splendid variety, was evinced by his remarks, while yet a child, upon the terrors of the veteran soldier; by the ardour which the relation of battles enkindled in his youthful bo∣som; by his undaunted heroism and just observations at the battle of Moncontour, when he had hardly attained
<PB N="181" REF="034162_0527_0FFC6CB193297CB0"/>
his sixteenth year; by his address and bravery, in quelling the mutineers in the city of Eause, while his remission of their offences gave those indications of his clemency, which his succeeding life abundantly con∣firmed; by his admirable conduct at Nerac, extricat∣ing himself by his valour from imminent danger; by the order of his march to, and his attack of, Cahors; by the hardships which, for five succeeding days and nights, he endured before that city; and by his un∣daunted and memorable reply to those who counselled a retreat—<Q><HI>'Tis Heaven which dictates what I ought to do upon this occasion. Remember then, that my retreat out of this city, shall be the retreat of my soul from my body. My honour requires this of me; speak therefore to me of nothing but fighting, conquest, or death.</HI></Q> Henry's resources in the midst of difficulties, and the splendor with which he emerged from the most desperate cir∣cumstances, with the facility with which he accommo∣dated himself to the most laborious occupations in the military department, conducting the miners in person, and animating the workmen by every proper exertion, together with his capability of enduring fatigue, can∣not but excite our astonishment! His victory at Con∣tras—his commiseration for the children of adversity, and the veneration in which he held the meritorious soldier—his generous aid of Henry III.—his arrange∣ments upon the death of that prince—the invincible resolution with which he surmounted difficulties suffi∣ciently powerful to overcome a host of warriors—his astonishing intrepidity in opposing himself, with only <HI>three</HI> thousand followers, to an army of <HI>thirty</HI> thousand men, alternately keeping guard in person, directing the trenches, snatching his hasty sustenance in the ditch, and denying himself a moment's respite from his un∣paralleled fatigues—are so many splendid claims upon our admiration! His success, in a combat so unequal in point of numbers, as was the battle of Argues, as∣sumes a miraculous aspect; nor can we withhold our veneration, while listening to his reply to the Count de Belin, who expressed his surprise at the inadequate
<PB N="182" REF="034162_0528_0FFC6CB00A7D12E8"/>
number of his troops—<Q><HI>You see not all, my friend; for you reckon not God and my claim, who fight for me.</HI></Q> The action of Argues would singly have secured the immortality of Henry; but his arduous struggles and uniform bravery multiplied his exploits, and gave them a brilliancy worthy of the finished chief which nature had designed.</P>
<P>The military hero unites conduct with courage; he coolly deliberates; and, what he theoretically resolves, he practically pursues. Henry IV. exhibited this com∣pletion of character in a very eminent degree; and Sully observes, that <Q><HI>he never suffered his ardour in bat∣tle to hinder him from following t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e calmer dictates of wisdom.</HI></Q> At the battle of Ivry the Gallic hero gathered fresh laurels: The excellent disposition of the several divisions, the valour with which he fought, and the victory obtained over numbers so greatly dis∣proportioned to his own, covered him with glory. On the evening preceding this action, and in his subsequent conduct, he gave striking proofs of a virtuous as well as a great mind; and his tenderness for Sully, who had been wounded in the battle, is strongly <HI>evincive of that sensibility, in which you suppose him deficient.</HI> Henry, considered as a warrior, in pursuit of glory and of a crown, (his right to which was incontestible) gave a remarkable proof of the transcendent goodness and ex∣quisite compassion of his heart, by raising the siege of Paris, at a moment when its conquest was within his grasp, merely to prevent that carnage which he had discovered his soldiers meditated, in revenge for the massacre of St. Bartholomew; and his permitting the besieged those supplies which it was in his power to cut off, was a fresh triumph of humanity. <Q><HI>I am not sur∣prised,</HI></Q> said Henry, <Q><HI>that the Spaniards and the chiefs of the league have no compassion upon these poor people; they are only tyrants: For me, I am their father and their king, and cannot bear the recital of their calami∣ties, without being pierced to the soul, and ardently desir∣ing to bring them relief.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="034162_0529_0FFC6CAC3A28D6F8"/>
The enemies of Henry bore testimony to his rare qualities, particularly to his intrepid bravery. <Q><HI>By heavens,</HI></Q> said they, <Q><HI>this prince deserves a thousand crowns for his valour!</HI></Q> The ardour with which the king exposed his person on many occasions, and the vehemence with which he yielded to his insatiable thirst for glory, triumphed, in some instances, over that pru∣dence which was generally a balance to his undaunted courage. Among those daring exploits, which were strongly tinctured with rashness, may be reckoned the action of Aumale; where he opposed himself, at the head of one hundred soldiers, to the Prince of Parma, whose army consisted of thirty thousand effective men! But the valour and conduct of his retreat is perhaps unrivalled in history. The reply of Henry to the re∣monstrances of his friend, is the best apology which can be given for these deviations from his generally wise and prudent movements—<Q><HI>I cannot do otherwise; and, since it is for my glory and crown that I fight, my life and every thing else ought to be of no consideration with me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>An instance of the king's humanity occurs at Dreux; where, in the moment of victory, arresting the progress of death, he distributed sums, proportioned to their ne∣cessities, among those who, thus doubly conquered by his prowess and by his munificent clemency, could hardly help taking rank among the most faithful of his subjects.</P>
<P>Victory attached itself to the person of Henry where-ever he commanded; and it was universally acknowl∣edged, that to his own bravery and excellent arrange∣ments, he was indebted for the splendor of his arms. At the campaign in Burgundy, and the battle of Fon∣taine Francois, he even surpassed himself. The enemy with whom he fought were two-thirds superior in num∣ber; but the Gallic hero was abundantly adequate to the most arduous achievements; and his exploits dur∣ing that action appear almost miraculous: Every thing, he was sensible, depended upon his own exer∣tions; and, at the head of one hundred and fifty horse,
<PB N="184" REF="034162_0530_0FFC6CA9E32FFAF8"/>
he arrested the flight of that division of his army which had been routed; he opposed himself bare-headed to the impetuosity of the victors; and, completely defeat∣ing the enemy, snatched from them a triumph of which they seemed already secure; and this admirable and well-timed exertion of valour, happily saved his followers from that general carnage which would in∣evitably have ensued. But I do not aim at enumerat∣ing all the battles and sieges in which this monarch was engaged. I only glance cursorily over the ac∣tions of a hero, who was neither elated by prosperity, nor depressed by adversity. He communicated a por∣tion of his ardour to those among his followers who were the least ambitious of glory. He was equal to every military duty; and his invincible bravery and indefatigable application excited that noble emulation, which is the parent of great actions.</P>
<P>But it is not as a military hero, EXCLUSIVELY, that Henry is entitled to applause—he was a patriot king. His subjects shared equally his regards, while merit was sure to obtain his patronage. His entrance into Paris strongly marked his benignity, and his paternal attachment to his people. His soldiers, exactly disci∣plined, exhibited a degree of regularity that would have done honour to a well ordered family; and, tak∣ing possession of the squares and streets, in military ar∣ray, the populace sustained not the smallest injury. His enemies experienced his clemency; and in that triumphant moment when he might have taken ample vengeance, <HI>a general amnesty was proclaimed,</HI> and all those who had borne arms against him were fully and freely pardoned. On the petition of the injured towns and villages, which, from the tremendous devastation made by the overflowing of the Loire, were stripped of all their possessions, Henry thus directs his minister: <Q><HI>God has given me subjects that I may preserve them as my children: Let them meet with tenderness and charity from my council. Alms are always highly acceptable to God, and in cases of public misery more especially so. It would be heavy on my conscience, if I neglected to do every
<PB N="185" REF="034162_0531_0FFC6CA75EB87C98"/>
thing I can for their relief.</HI></Q> Thus, in word and in deed, did Henry consult the public weal. He consid∣ered himself as placed at the head of a numerous fam∣ily, whose happiness it was his duty to consult; nor did he hesitate in relinquishing his most favourite pur∣suits, if he might thereby contribute to the felicity or emolument of his kingdom.</P>
<P>Henry's clemency to delinquents was descriptive of the utmost lenity and tenderness of disposition. He preserved his serenity and cheerfulness, even when suf∣fering from the stroke of the assassin, who had aimed an ineffectual blow at his life. He laboured to preserve Mareschal Byron and other conspirators; and he mag∣nanimously passed by every offence, as far as was con∣sistent with the safety of his person and kingdom. The noble frankness with which he received all those, who, from whatever motive, had joined the league against him, greatly augments the splendor of his renown. His way to the throne of France had been strewed with difficulties and misfortunes, of a nature which required all his bravery and fortitude to surmount; but, having attained his hereditary right, he proved himself greatly worthy the royal authority with which he was cloathed. His reception of Admiral Villars, who had thrown himself at his feet, whom he hastily raised, observing, that such submission was due only to God—of the Duke of Maienne, whom he tenderly embraced, and of many others, was truly magnani∣mous, and serves to evince the inborn grandeur of his soul. The cheerfulness of his disposition endeared him to his friends and the nation at large. <Q><HI>The lineaments of his face,</HI> says Sully, <HI>had that agreea∣ble liveliness which forms a sweet and happy physiognomy, and perfectly suited that engaging easiness of manners, which, though sometimes mixed with majesty, never lost the graceful affability and easy gaiety, so natural to him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The veracity of Henry was numbered among his prominent virtues. He pronounced an inviolable ad∣herence to truth, the first requisite in a man of genuine bravery and worth; and, when dictating the articles

of capitulation at a siege, the sacred regard he was known to pay to his word, rendered it to the besieged as acceptable a pledge, as the strongest bonds which suspicion could invent. Henry's feelings, as a father, hath not been surpassed: As a husband, if he was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uxorious, he was at least manly and polite; and when it is remembered, that his matrimonial connexion was only the superstructure of policy, candour will confess, that this was the utmost which ought to have been ex∣pected from a prince superior to dissimulation. If Mary de Medicis had been blest with discretion, and possessed of those attractions, address, and feminine del∣icacy, which have distinguished some ladies, she might, perhaps, have rendered Henry affectionate. It is to be lamented, that Margaret of Valois was not to his taste. I have always been particularly affected by the history of this princess; her merit appears to me incontestible: Her dignified resignation of the king; her unremitted attention to the person who succeeded her, and the rational attachment she continued to evince for the royal pair, are circumstances which announce her truly noble, and place her, in my opinion, with the first of women.</P>
<P>Henry evinced his love of literature, by his patron∣age of learned men; and it is with regret we proceed to say, that virtue must deplore the deep shade, too often thrown over the shining qualities of the Gallic hero. His illicit attachments frequently enveloped in clouds the noble endowments of a mind, capable of exhibiting a finished model of transcendent excellence. Yet, while we lament a deviation so capital, it is with pleasure we repeat a fact, which must be considered as an <HI>essential palliation of this single error. Henry never suffered a pursuit of pleasure, of whatever description, to arrest those valuable purposes which marked the magnanim∣ity and heroism of his soul.</HI></P>
<P>But, you observe, that Henry was an apostate, while the Duke of Sully preserved his religion. I am, my dear, pleased with your warmth upon this occasion; and yet it is true, that actions, proper and becoming to
<PB N="187" REF="034162_0533_0FFC6CA33947C9B0"/>
an individual, are not always suitable to the head and representative of a numerous and enlightened people. From a monarch, youthful, ardent, and devoted to mil∣itary fame, we are not to expect an unyielding system of divinity. Henry was bred a Calvinist; and per∣haps this is the only reason which produced him, in the commencement of his career, a Protestant. The in∣terests of humanity loudly demanded a sacrifice of his particular mode of worship; and it is surely highly derogatory to our holy religion, to suppose it calls up∣on us to immolate the lives of thousands, merely for the establishment of a tenet, which cannot <HI>rationally</HI> be regarded as affecting the present interest or future feli∣city of the creature. Perhaps the zeal of religion has betrayed many upright minds, and it may have enkin∣dled <HI>false fires</HI> in the bosom of the <HI>persecuted,</HI> as well as the <HI>persecutor.</HI></P>
<P>France bled at every pore; she was torn by intestine divisions; and her extensive provinces were on the eve of being deluged in blood!—Ought Henry to have perpetuated the misery of millions, merely for the sake of ideas, which, <HI>strictly speaking, cannot be said to consti∣tute the fundamental articles of religion?</HI> Henry was a patriot king—Must he exhaust those talents which were calculated to establish the happiness of a nation, in destroying a people he was born to protect? Henry was a meritorious prince; he was entitled to felicity—Must he devote himself to the calamities attendant up∣on endless hostilities? If the king embraced the Cath∣olic faith, he thereby became a minister of peace; he might lull to sleep, or utterly exterminate the fiery zeal of persecution; the gentle spirit of tolerance might be cherished and invigorated; it would be in his power to arrest and remedy the progress of those disorders which had desolated France; and a happy or tragical catastrophe was apparently involved in his decision. The beneficent influence of a philanthropic example, recommended by, and originating from, the throne, would disseminate the mild principles of peace, love, and general fraternity. France demanded of.
<PB N="188" REF="034162_0534_0FFC6C9F3470CE00"/>
Henry a restoration of her internal quiet. Tranquil∣lity, affluence and safety were in his gift. Lacerated, and almost expiring, while she well near despaired of relief, she yet forcibly and energetically pronounced, that Henry's abjuration of Calvinism would be a balm for every wound; that hostilities would then cease; and peace, with its attendant train of felicities, would once more bless her wide domain! And what was the concession which Henry was required to make? <HI>Not a dereliction of his God, either in the character of Creator, Redeemer, or Preserver;</HI> and the liberality of his sen∣timents induced a persuasion, that the Architect of all worlds was equally served by the <HI>sincere</HI> Catholic as by the Protestant. The observation of a few ceremonies was the supernumerary he was called upon to embrace; and, considering the forfeiture embosomed in his rejec∣tion, reason will candidly acquit him. Besides, the king being a Protestant <HI>only in name,</HI> had never investigated the peculiar tenets of his sect; and the Catholic priests, called upon at this juncture to defend their sentiments, produced in the royal presence their most specious ar∣guments; while their Calvinistic opponents, <HI>convinced of the necessity of the king's conversion, veiled before them; either declining to defend themselves, or purposely employing weapons which they knew to be unequal to the combat!</HI> Sully insists, that <HI>internal conviction was thus, in fact, forced upon the mind of the monarch;</HI> and, as the inmost recesses of Henry's heart were ever open to Sully, the above representation extorts our full assent to the opin∣ion of that minister.</P>
<P>"But Sully preserved his religion inviolate." It appears, my dear, that the Duke of Sully had thor∣oughly examined his faith, and that it had become the deliberate election of his riper years. Neither was he involved in the same necessity with his master; his <HI>individual aggrandizement</HI> would have been his only in∣ducement to the relinquishment of his religious senti∣ments; and a motive so decidedly interested ought never to gain the ascendency in a noble mind. It should also be remembered, that Henry's abjuration
<PB N="189" REF="034162_0535_0FFC6C9C9C6AB820"/>
was strongly enforced and accelerated by the advice of Sully.</P>
<P>The truth is, Henry was a philanthropist; and those beneficent plans which, at an early period, occupied his mind, not confined to France, included the whole Christian world. Indeed it is from those general ar∣rangements, which, calculated upon a large scale, em∣braced all Europe, that he is more particularly enti∣tled to the appellation <HI>great;</HI> and, the probability is, that had he accomplished his vast purposes, his wishes would only have been bounded by the universe. Hen∣ry was well qualified for the completion of his mag∣nanimous design; he possessed an accurate knowledge of the state and various interests of all those countries, the general emolument of which he contemplated; and his intrepidity, profound wisdom, and rare abilities, had become a universal theme. If I understand the vast project which Henry had conceived, its object was to fashion all christendom into one great family, or extensive republic, which republic was to be equitably parcelled out into hereditary and elective monarchies and sovereign republics; amenable, however, in some leading arrangements to a general council; and the division was to be made in such a manner as to remove every occasion of jealousy or apprehension; thus ar∣resting the progress of the devouring sword, and put∣ting a stop to that effusion of blood, and those perpet∣ual hostilities, which are an outrage to humanity. The members of this august union were to be regulated and governed by one general plan; their presiding head, or chief magistrate, was to be elected from the several potentates by the free suffrages of the whole; and the affairs of this complex commonwealth, were to be ad∣justed by general and inferior assemblies, consisting of deputies from the individual States of this Christian republic; men were to be protected in the free exercise of their religion; toleration was to be established, and the rights of conscience held inviolate.</P>
<P>Henry, in the contemplation of this splendid achieve∣ment, magnanimously determined to reject all com∣pensation
<PB N="190" REF="034162_0536_0FFC6C9B18D187E8"/>
for the expense and hazard of the enterprize. The boundaries which he affixed to the several powers, effectually barred France from all <HI>acquisition of territory;</HI> and he only reserved to himself the glory of dissemina∣ting over the face of Europe the rich blessings of har∣mony and peace. That Henry should have been ca∣pable of conceiving this plan, at a period when France was reduced by intestine divisions to the verge of de∣struction, and when he himself was nearly overwhelm∣ed by misfortunes, is truly astonishing! and that when thus struggling with calamity, he was able to originate and organize the most ardent and beneficial under∣taking that could occupy the mind of man, is a cir∣cumstance which must remain an incontestible proof of the grandeur of his intellect. This prodigious and stupendous design, was, at first, utterly rejected by Sully; and he ingenuously confesses that his rejection proceeded from a temper naturally cold, cautious and unenterprizing. But upon examining the project in all its parts, he ardently adopted it; and, as delineated in his memoirs, it appears not only practicable, but highly rational.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that Queen Elizabeth had projected an enterprize, which answered in all its parts, feature by feature, to that of the Gallic hero, and this previous to the commencement of their correspondence upon this grand subject, and long before it had a being in the mind of Henry. It is to the honour of Elizabeth that she was solicitous to effectuate a revolution so import∣antly beneficial, without having recourse to arms. Sul∣ly suggests an idea, that Henry, after the conference at Dover, was indebted to the English Queen for the per∣fecting of some parts of his scheme. But the Gallic mon∣arch, and his minister, were enthusiastic admirers of Elizabeth; they were filled with astonishment at her po∣litical abilities; they declare they cannot bestow praises upon her adequate to her merit; they conceive that in <Q><HI>respect of wisdom, penetration, and all the other per∣fections of the mind, she was not inferior to any king, the must truly deserving of that title.</HI></Q> Henry conceived
<PB N="191" REF="034162_0537_0FFC6C98B6A82830"/>
she merited immortal praise; and he lamented for her, at her death, "<HI>as for a second self;</HI>" and indeed Eliza∣beth's capability of conceiving, adjusting and cherishing a plan so magnanimous, together with her whole con∣nexion with Henry, reflects a lustre on her character, that greatly adds to the fervor of those wishes, which would endow her with <HI>consistent magnanimity;</HI> it cannot but redeem for her a moiety of our esteem; and we would gladly impute her whole transactions with the Queen of Scots to the influence of some infernal in∣stigator, who, throwing a veil over her better genius, impelled her to deeds truly diabolical.</P>
<P>At length, every thing was prepared for the com∣mencement of those operations which were to termi∣nate in the establishment of peace and equality, throughout the christian territory. The treasury of Henry was amply replenished, his resources were pro∣digious, his army was embodied, his arrangements were made, allies were engaged, and contingencies were provided for, when the death of the Duke of Cleves, with the consequent disputes relative to the suc∣cession to his dignities and possessions, opened the way to, and gave the signal of, onset.</P>
<P>But alas! the days of Henry were numbered! and this august prince became the victim of that dark and inhuman zeal, whose bigotted policy hath frequently been stained by the blood of the most excellent among mankind. It was, indeed, a fearful moment, and muffled in clouds, dark and portentous—the superin∣tending genius of France, and of Europe, relinquished its guardianship—the fiends of murder assumed the regency—and, when we reflect upon the sudden disso∣lution of the splendid prospects, which rose so fair, and promised such vast emolument, around the dagger of the fell assassin, ten thousand augmenting horrors gather?</P>

<P>I DO not, my dear, regret the tears you shed over the meritorious sufferer—Compassion ameliorates the bosom; rouses the virtues, and prepares us for the exercise of all those kindly offices, which our relative or social duties may require.</P>
<P>In the history of Charles I. of England, the <HI>im∣partialist</HI> will lament a virtuous and amiable prince, misled by education, rendered unhappy by a combina∣tion of causes, and finally betrayed to death by a treacherous and hypocritical miscreant, who, <HI>in effect,</HI> usurped his offices and dignity. The endearing be∣nignity and sweetness of disposition, which Charles so eminently possessed, had, previous to his accession to the regal dignity, enthroned him in the hearts of the people. Nature had implanted in his bosom all the qualities which go to the composition of a <HI>patriot king</HI>—but strong impressions of the sacred, irrevocable, and heaven descended prerogative of majesty, had been deeply made upon his infant mind. His father had spared no effort to endow his son with sentiments, which he himself had been unable to defend in any other way than by his pen; and Charles, conceiving himself under obligations to transmit, undiminished, to
<PB N="193" REF="034162_0539_0FFC6C92D91A8B50"/>
posterity, those divine rights, delegated to him as a sacred deposit, esteemed every encroachment as a crim∣inal invasion of those privileges, for which he had be∣come responsible.</P>
<P>With plans, originating in views receiving from pa∣ternal influence and authority the stamp of rectitude, he mounted the English throne; and his measures were by consequence very inclement to that ardent love of liberty, which then began to animate the pub∣lic mind, and to induce a conviction that the descend∣ants of one common Parent must have inherited, from nature, an inherent and equal right to the transcend∣ent felicities, attendant upon <HI>rational</HI> FREEDOM. Yet Charles, <HI>taught by experience,</HI> would have become the father of his people; but the unbending spirit of the times, once roused to action, and aided by unprinci∣pled, interested, and hell-born ambition, laid low a monarch, who, however widely he had mistaken the path, was, nevertheless, anxiously solicitous to promote the happiness of his people.</P>
<P>The marriage of Charles with a princess of the Roman Catholic persuasion; his attachment to the Duke of Buckingham; the war, in which he engaged, in consequence of that attachment; the unconstitu∣tional demands which his necessities impelled; his unwarrantable extension of authority, in levying ship money; the frequent dissolution of parliament; ille∣gal taxes; arbitrary imprisonment; billeting soldiers; martial laws; the severe and ill-judged zeal of Laud; the attempt to establish Episcopacy in Scotland; the prosecution of the citizens of London, in the star cham∣ber; the despotic proceedings of that court, and the repetition of extorted loans—were among the leading causes, which procured the ruin of a prince, calculated to give dignity to, and reflect honour on, any situation in life, in which he might have been placed. The noble stand, made by the people of England in defence of civil liberty, and their arduous struggles for those rights and privileges, which ought, indeed, to be con∣sidered as unalienable, can never be too much admired;
<PB N="194" REF="034162_0540_0FFC6C9125E6ED38"/>
they are entitled to the esteem and veneration of man∣kind; and the manly and undaunted firmness, with which the Hampdens of that eventful day, opposed themselves to the encroachments of arbitrary power, will continue, to the latest posterity, to command the esteem, and excite the emulation of every bosom, ca∣pable of that fervid and animating glow, which a love of freedom will invariably inspire. But, when the amiable monarch, convicted of those errors, which, originating in education, had been cherished and con∣firmed by intemperate councils, acceded to every de∣mand which freedom, organized by reason, and sub∣mitting to the necessary regulations of government, could suggest—when his rebellious subjects, in defiance of every amicable overture, audaciously continued their practices against the dignity, the government, the peace, and even the life of their sovereign—every indignant feeling takes the alarm, and we hesitate not in pronouncing their proceedings truly unwarrantable, and highly atrocious. A combination in favour of the <HI>Magna Charta of Nature</HI> must ever ensure appro∣bation; but an attempt to seize those <HI>prescriptive rights of the executive,</HI> which the experience of all ages has pronounced requisite to the due administration of or∣der, and the support of that subordination, which em∣bosoms the general weal, is a crime, the fearful conse∣quences of which, no human foresight can calculate.</P>
<P>Charles, mild and peaceable, and attached with even paternal tenderness to his subjects, entered with the utmost reluctance into those sanguinary measures that were deemed necessary to the preservation of re∣gal authority. Vigorous exertions, at the commence∣ment of the civil war, might have arrested that torrent of misfortunes by which he was afterwards over∣whelmed. But the clemency of the monarch suffered the moment to pass, in which, by proper and decisive movements, he might have obtained his own terms.</P>
<P>It does not appear that the design was simply to remove obstructions, nor to repair a decaying fabric; a project abundantly more comprehensive than that of
<PB N="195" REF="034162_0541_0FFA65567294BEE8"/>
curtailing the <HI>obnoxious privileges</HI> of the crown, while its <HI>beneficial powers were extended,</HI> was formed. Every baleful passion was abroad—misrepresentations and malignant aggravations were countenanced. Ani∣mosities obtained, with every passing moment, an as∣tonishing augmentation of inveteracy; and the daring purpose was conceived and systematized, of utterly de∣stroying the venerable structure of government, and of abolishing forever that power, which had been, for a succession of ages, regarded as the foundation or chief pillar in the English constitution!</P>
<P>Deplorable was the state of the monarch! Sur∣rounded by difficulties beyond the reach of human wisdom to surmount, or even to control! And as if these were not sufficient, an attempt was made to fas∣ten upon him the odium of those very calamities which pierced his bosom with the deepest sorrow! nor did the finger of malevolence fail of pointing him out as the author of that horrible massacre in Ireland, of the rise and conduct of which he was entirely ignorant, and which every principle of his soul detested. In the struggle between the king and the parliament, many brave men lost their lives. Upon the virtues of the <HI>Falklands</HI> and the <HI>Hampdens</HI> of that distressful period, every reader will pronounce a panegyric. Their magnanimity, patriotism, undaunted bravery, and va∣rious accomplishments, although opposed in arms, will ensure them the undivided admiration of every succeeding generation. In the chalice prepared for the king, every bitter ingredient was to be infused; and the parliament, apprized of his conjugal tenderness and fidelity, contrived to stab him in the tenderest part, by preferring an impeachment against the queen! Nor indeed was any species of contumely spared; the private papers of the royal pair were seized and <Q><HI>pub∣lished by the command of parliament, who took a vulgar and brutal satisfaction in ridiculing all those tender effusions which were never drawn up for the public eye!</HI></Q> It is impossible to attend, without the extreme of grief and indignation, to the supplicating monarch! to the con∣temptuous
<PB N="196" REF="034162_0542_0FFC6C8F8B2F6B28"/>
silence of parliament! to the several stages of his degradation! to that surrender which his impe∣rious necessities impelled! to the subsequent ingrat∣itude of the Scots! to the rude and barbarous zeal of the clergy! to the indecent transfer of the king's person, and the variety of indignities which he suffered in the various stages of his imprisonment! to his seizure by Joyce! to his being led about at the pleas∣ure of the prevailing party! now a prisoner with the army, and anon with the parliament, while he is on all sides the victim of perfidy and unwarrantable am∣bition!—These accumulated calamities, I say, wound the soul of sensibility, and are an outrage upon every sense of humanity and propriety.</P>
<P>Imagination presents the interesting and highly in∣jured prince. We behold his venerable head, prema∣turely bleached by misfortune! his beard is neglected, and even his apparel, worn and decaying, evinces his desolate situation! one decrepit servant only attends him! he is forsaken and solitary! he exhibits an af∣fecting example of the instability of human grandeur! Over this melancholy figure of a deeply oppressed sove∣reign, we cannot but weep—every sentiment of com∣miseration is embodied—and we spontaneously rever∣ence the royal captive!</P>
<P>In the fate of Charles, and Mary, Queen of Scots, who was his immediate grand-parent, there is, in many instances, a striking resemblance. Like her's, his troubles in a great measure originated in religious dis∣sensions. The same spirit, which in the days of Mary persecuted Popery, now manifested equal acrimony against Episcopacy; and the same vehemence was in ex∣ercise against the use of the liturgy, as had been hereto∣fore opposed to the mass. Both those sovereigns had the grief to meet in hostile fields their rebellious sub∣jects, and both were compelled to fly for shelter to an implacable foe; both were betrayed, and in both in∣stances a <HI>special edict</HI> was procured, on which to ground the process that aimed at the lives of those illustrious sufferers! They were alike stripped of the externals
<PB N="197" REF="034162_0543_0FFC6C8A27B3C9B0"/>
of royalty, and they <HI>ineffectually</HI> preferred their ardent solicitations to be heard in their own defence in the presence of the two houses of parliament! while, by a usurpation of authority, and under the regency of di∣abolical passions, they were alike produced upon the scaffold. The fortitude and noble serenity of Charles was as exemplary as that of his royal ancestor; but although his own misfortunes wrung no tears from his eyes, or degrading complaints from his lips, his very soul was pierced for the calamities of his friends! Yes, it consists with the testimony of history to assert, that no consideration of his sufferings, as an individu∣al, could destroy his equanimity of temper; and al∣though separated from the beloved companion of his bosom, and dethroned by those rebellious subjects who were hourly aggravating their crimes, by heaping up∣on degraded majesty every species of indignity! Al∣though cruelly maligned, and bitterly inveighed against, imprisoned by his most obdurate foes, and infamously treated! yet, strange to tell, the benignity of his countenance, and the equality of his deportment continued uniform and unbroken, while every move∣ment seemed to say—<HI>In defiance of those accumulated evils, which have combined for my destruction, I am still a sovereign; and, supported by conscious rectitude, the sub∣limity of virtue confers upon me that kind of elevation of which no earthly power can despoil me.</HI></P>
<P>The soul-affecting meetings between Charles and his children, having moistened with the <HI>temporary</HI> tear of remorse and commiseration, even the eye of the obdurate Cromwell, must in truth be beyond the power of description! Charles supported, through his mock trial, an admirable presence of mind; and his intrepid fortitude and heroic firmness, while encoun∣tering those various and brutal indignities to which he was subjected, evinced that true magnanimity, which could only have belonged to a mind radically virtuous. The noble independence of lady Fairfax, and that un∣daunted heroism with which she bore her personal tes∣timony, even in the presence of the murderers of the
<PB N="198" REF="034162_0544_0FFC6C86D30C6378"/>
king, against those sanguinary proceedings avowedly aimed at the life of her sovereign, will reflect eternal honour upon her memory!</P>
<P>To arrest the progress of measures so atrocious, it was in vain that foreign princes interposed their good offices; the pressing remonstrances of the <HI>relenting</HI> Scots were disregarded, and the pathetic supplications of the weeping Henrietta were ineffectual! The Falk∣lands and the Hampdens of that day, were, alas! no more! The affrighted virtues had either fled the Al∣bion shore, or were sequestered in the bosom of a few upright persons, whom the turpitude of the times had deprived of all power! Yet amid this general derelic∣tion of humanity, and prevalence of profligacy, we hail, with glowing admiration, the names of the Duke of Richmond, the Earls of Hertford, Southhamp∣ton, and Lindsay, who greatly solicited permission to relinquish their lives, if they might thereby redeem from death their highly injured and virtuous sovereign! Nor can even the frozen bosom of apathy refuse, to this attempt to extricate the unfortunate prince, those unequivocal expressions of applause, that transcendent worth must ever extort! The manly demeanour and heavenly composure, which Charles exhibited, during the interval between his sentence and his martyrdom, his exemplary piety, the ardour of his devotion, the cheerfulness with which he marked the approaching hour of emancipation, adverting to the closing scene as a "<HI>great and joyful solemnity,</HI>" and his address to the sorrowful clergyman who attended him in his last moments, are so many finishing strokes of a character in which we involuntarily take an interest, and to which we feel ourselves unalterably attached. What must have been the rectitude of that life, a retrospect of which could furnish no other subject of remorse, than that <HI>extorted consent</HI> which he yielded to the death of the virtuous Strafford! Especially when it is remembered, that the Earl himself nobly insisted on being made the sacrifice of a reconciliation between the king and the people, and that the withholding the
<PB N="199" REF="034162_0545_0FFC6C85481E1060"/>
royal sanction would not, upon that occasion, have pre∣served the generous nobleman. This transaction, however, pressed hard upon the mind of the monarch, and he mentioned it with regret upon the scaffold.</P>
<P>Charles possessed the virtues of the heart in an un∣common degree, and his talents were undoubtedly great. Historians delineate him as a man of superior worth, and uniform probity. They describe him as the most finished gentleman, the most ardent and faithful friend, the most humane and compassionate master, the tenderest parent, the most affectionate husband, and exemplary Christian, that the times in which he lived produced. Nor can we wonder at the sighs, tears, and lamentations, which we are told marked his exit!!</P>
<P>Peter the Great is our next subject; and this mon∣arch, in regard to many circumstances, stands, <HI>as far as I have known,</HI> upon the page of history without a parallel. A cloud gathered round the morning of his days, and his education was little attended to; but genius surmounts every difficulty; <HI>rich in native splendors, it is self illumined;</HI> it is superior to every envelopement, and no barriers can confine its progress. The youthful Czar early discovered an insatiable thirst for knowledge; his first arrangements were de∣scriptive of military ardor and talents; and enlisting in the lowest grade, in those regiments which he in∣stituted, organized and established, he became a can∣didate for preferment; nor would he accept promo∣tion, until his abilities had rendered his right thereto incontestible. When we behold the Czar of Russia engaged as a labourer in the ship-yards of Holland and England, we hesitate not in conferring upon him the sirname of Great! And we are at a loss which to admire most, the singularity or the independence of that mind, which, in defiance of custom, and those enervating indulgencies in the gift of royalty, em∣braced such unparalleled measures for the benefit of a community, which his predecessors had been accus∣tomed
<PB N="200" REF="034162_0546_0FFC70AD39946AE0"/>
to consider as created for their individual emolument.</P>
<P>Peter was laudably ambitious of acquiring every useful attainment, and his information was various and respectable. With an eye of the closest investigation he visited the artificer, and his knowledge in the mechanism of those arts, to which he attended, was proportioned to his indefatigable diligence. In Istia, and in the academy of sciences in Petersburg, they still exhibit those bars of iron, which Peter himself, without the aid of an assistant, shaped at the forge of Muller, affixing thereon his own mark. He demand∣ed of Muller the wages which he allowed to other workmen, and he purchased therewith a pair of shoes, which he was particularly fond of displaying, always observing, <Q><HI>I have earned them well by the sweat of my brow, with hammer and anvil.</HI></Q> Peter drew from every circumstance all possible information; and, fond of considering himself as the <HI>pupil</HI> of <HI>contingencies,</HI> he was solicitous to make the greatest proficiency. His talents as a soldier were far above a mediocrity; and although he was sometimes unsuccessful, yet being taught the art of war by Charles XII. of Sweden, his military fame became considerable.</P>
<P>The Swedish monarch ascended the throne of his ancestors, at a period when the nation, (whose sceptre he swayed) had attained the summit of prosperity; but, seized with a kind of military frenzy, he aban∣doned his native dominions, fought with prodigious intrepidity a number of battles, and achieved such astonishing exploits, as plunged his subjects into a train of evils, which well near accomplished their ruin!</P>
<P>It was from this hero that Peter learned the art of war; yet the better genius of the Czar finally prevail∣ed over his master; and, after obtaining some impor∣tant advantages, the decisive victory of Pultowa estab∣lished his celebrity, and he had the glory of reinstating the deposed Augustus upon the throne of Poland.</P>
<P>The Czarina Catharine, ranks among the most ex∣traordinary women of whom history records an ac∣count.
<PB N="201" REF="034162_0547_0FFC70AB0F851178"/>
The child of misfortune, she was reared by the beneficent interposition of pious charity; but, elevated by her beauty and her talents, to the throne of Russia, she proved herself abundantly worthy of the confidence reposed in her. She was the constant companion of the Czar in all those enterprises which he undertook both by land and sea; and she was, it is said, both an able counsellor, and a brave general. By her wisdom and her presence of mind, Peter was repeatedly ex∣tricated from the verge of destruction, particularly when he was encompassed on every side at the battle of Pruth, and in the naval engagement with the Swedes, in the gulf of Finland. The order of St. Catharine was instituted by Peter, in honour of this Empress; and the investiture of the candidates were in her gift. Peter appointed this illustrious woman to succeed him in the empire; and her arrangements up∣on his death were descriptive of consummate prudence. The academy of sciences, at Petersburg, was establish∣ed by her; she augmented the navy, and prosecuted the project of discovering a north-east passage to China.</P>
<P>Russia is indebted to Peter the Great for her civili∣zation; he endowed her with power, respectability and dignity. He distributed her ennobled citizens in sev∣eral parts of Europe, that they might thus acquire and bring home those improvements so necessary for the public weal; and large gratuities were tendered to foreigners of ability, who should consent to become denizens of Russia. His institutions and establish∣ments, were numerous; his armies were organized and disciplined after the most approved models; his fleets thronged those seas which wash the Russian shores; he erected fortresses, and multiplied commo∣dious harbours; and, allured by a patronage so pow∣erful, the arts and sciences, in the reign of Peter the Great, first sound an asylum in Russia. As a legisla∣tor, he was respectable. Petersburg hails him as its founder; and many other cities which he reared, and canals which he trained, bear witness to his industry,

and to the wisdom of his administration. He is said to have been a munificent prince; and his punishments are described as the superstructure of justice. He is characterized as upright, assiduous and modest; and we are also informed that he had sufficient self-com∣mand to deny himself the intemperate use of ardent spirits, of which he was immoderately fond.</P>
<P>Yet many vices are attributed to Peter, who certain∣ly, in some instances, was not <HI>great;</HI> and even my Margaretta complains of his rigour to his son. But, my love, Alexei was stained with many crimes, be∣side that of rebellion; and you will recollect that much praise has been ascribed to the rigid virtue of the elder Brutus, who <HI>unrelentingly consented to the death of his of∣fending children.</HI></P>
<P>It is now, my dear, late at night; you are fast lock∣ed in the arms of sleep; and may your slumbers be peaceful. This letter, which I am to place on your toilette, will meet your early attention in the morning; and if you arise in perfect health, and in the full exer∣cise of all your sweet and amiable virtues, tranquillity will be continued to your affectionate mother,</P>

<HEAD>To MARGARETTA.</HEAD>
<P>I REPEAT, my dear, that I am charmed with the glowing energy and sympathetic ardour of your youthful bosom. The earnestness with which you per∣sonate the identical character traced by the historian,
<PB N="203" REF="034162_0549_0FFC70A66C6C0648"/>
(which so completely divests you of every other con∣sciousness, producing a temporary oblivion of yourself, and giving you eagerly to embrace the joys and sor∣rows of the virtuous hero or heroine) is my security for your improvement; and I think it can scarcely happen, that the studies you pursue should not endow you with a fund of useful information.</P>
<P>In your selection from the worthies who first plant∣ed the virtues of civilization in this younger world, you have evinced much judgment. The private and political character of Governor Winthrop is perhaps without a blemish—<HI>his civism was the growth of reason</HI>—and he entertained principles which, as I conceive, are the essence of all those governments that are the super∣structure of rectitude, or, in other words, that comprise the well-being of both the <HI>governor</HI> and the <HI>governed.</HI> If there was a tinge of error in the sentiments or ad∣ministration of this time honoured sage, it resulted from that spirit of religious intolerance, which in his parting moments he feelingly regretted.</P>
<P>In tracing the eventful life of William Penn, the celebrated founder of Pennsylvania, my mind is im∣pressed with an uncommon glow of admiration. It has been observed, that the persecuted man becomes, in his turn, an inexorable persecutor: But Penn is an illustrious exception to this general rule. He seems to have possessed, from nature, a mind firm and dignified, and it was apparently imbued with every virtue that can sublime or adorn humanity. His uniform adher∣ence to the religion of his election; the patient firm∣ness with which he endured the displeasure of a belov∣ed and revered parent; his close conformity to the dictates of conscience; and the noble independence with which he surrendered himself to observances that subjected him to the censure of the grave and the ridi∣cule of the gay, are unquestionable instances of the superiority of his mind, and commandingly demon∣strate a genius rendered luminous by its own inborn splendors, and cultivated by studious application. Even his enthusiastic zeal, <HI>as it was never tinctured by
<PB N="204" REF="034162_0550_0FFC70A4276839F0"/>
cruelty,</HI> is amiable and endearing; and we bless the fervid imagination, which, however pertinacious in its tenets, in no moment yields to the dark and murderous hues of prejudice.</P>
<P>Penn's religious sentiments early involved him in many inconveniences; we find him while a student at the university of Oxford, subjected to the penalties an∣nexed to non-conformity; the resentments of his father were grievous and durable! He was frequently im∣prisoned; but he appeared equal to every calamity; and the elevation of his spirit was not to be subdued! He disdained, with honest warmth, that emancipation from his bonds which was to be the purchase of an abjuration of his principles; and his captivity was em∣ployed in literary pursuits. It appears that he exhib∣ited a complete example of rectitude; and had he been long held in durance, it would have confirmed the odium of those measures by which he had been so arbitrarily detained: But, acquitted by the verdict of a legal process, his prison doors were thrown open; and the indignation of his father giving place to the splen∣did virtues of a son, who reflected the highest honour upon his name and lineage, an act of amnesty suc∣ceeded, and the demise of the old gentleman put him in possession of a handsome patrimonial inheritance. His opulence, however, in no degree diminishing his devout and unalterable attachment to Quakerism, he still continued obnoxious to an intolerant government. He was again imprisoned in the tower of London, whence he was transferred to Newgate, from which place, (after malice and tyranny had made an inef∣fectual discovery of their malignant inveteracy) he was at length released.</P>
<P>Penn visited many parts of Europe, and he was al∣ways industriously employed, both by preaching and writing, in disseminating those sentiments which he re∣garded as the offspring of truth: He conferred the high∣est lustre upon the sect to which he adhered; indeed his probity, philanthropy, mildness of disposition, talents, literature, and great goodness of heart, must be con∣sidered
<PB N="205" REF="034162_0551_0FFC70A29F205E58"/>
as conferring respectability upon human nature at large; and it was a most beneficent arrangement in the economy of paternal Providence, which made Penn a proprietor in this new world. His abilities as a leg∣islator have been extensively celebrated; and many of his regulations have been adopted by the wisdom and experience of later days. We bless the propitious events and favourable gales which wafted him across the broad Atlantic; and we mark with complacent veneration his judicious system of government, and the mildness of his administration. His upright con∣duct relative to the aborigines of this country, so cal∣culated to secure their affectionate confidence, was de∣scriptive even of parental kindness, and was attended with the most beneficial effects. His sacred regard to the rights of conscience, induced him to establish, with∣out reserve, that kind of toleration which admits the free exercise of all those religious sentiments that orig∣inate in an acknowledgment of the great First Cause, and produce the individual amenable to the laws of society: And thus was Pennsylvania rendered an asy∣lum for the persecuted of every persuasion; while this circumstance, says an elegant and judicious writer, "<HI>contributed more than any thing else to its prosperity,</HI>" Penn, in fact, effectuated his philanthropic purpose—<Q><HI>He supported power in reverence with the people; and he secured the people from the abuse of power;</HI></Q> and we are almost ready to pronounce the term of his admin∣istration, a renovation of the lapsed nature. Indian ferocity was ameliorated by the uniform exercise of probity and tenderness: Mild equality assumed her most captivating aspect; and the colony is said to have exhibited a striking resemblance to a <Q><HI>father and his family; the latter united by interest and affection; the former revered for the wisdom of his institutions, and the indulgent use of his authority. Those who were am∣bitious of repose found it in Pennsylvania. The commu∣nity were the same equal face—no one aspired, no one was oppressed: Industry was sure of profit, knowledge of esteem, and virtue of veneration.</HI></Q> But the patriot
<PB N="206" REF="034162_0552_0FFC709D533EB260"/>
legislator, stimulated by the strongest incentives, de∣parted for his native land, and clouds gathered round the infant government. Yet humanity cannot consider the philanthropic chief as in any degree reprehensible. The English prisons were filled with his persecuted and suffering brethren; and his powerful interposition, on his return to the Albion shore, procured the en∣largement of no less than thirteen hundred of his friends, who were held in durance.</P>
<P>The plan of the city of Philadelphia, which is de∣cidedly the metropolis of America, and which at∣tracts the attention and extorts the admiration of strangers of every description, was completed under the auspices of Penn; and it may be a question, whether, in proportion as succeeding proprietors have departed therefrom, they have not diminished the beauty, elegance and convenience of the city.</P>
<P>A superficial observer may be ready to ask—Since Penn was so nearly exempted from the depravity which adheres to the individuals of humanity, how are we to account for the calamities which encompassed him, for his frequent imprisonments, and for the misfortunes which seemed to attend the evening of his days? But reflection will suggest the ineffable consolations attend∣ant upon a course of virtue; and reason will not fail to point to that refulgent day, which, dawning in worlds beyond the sky, will assuredly succeed the long, dark and heavy night of mortality.</P>
<P>The volume of manuscripts, so lately put into your hands, which contains many letters upon history, ren∣ders it unnecessary to continue my remarks in this line. My future subjects will be circumscribed within more narrow bounds; and I have, perhaps, said enough to stimulate your researches. I break off abruptly, to inclose the landscape which you have so accurately pencilled, to our good friend, Mrs. W—. The post sets off in less than an hour; and I only add, that you are, at this moment, every thing I wish. I am your affectionate mother,</P>

POSSIBLY, the number of letters, which my solic∣itude to comply with the wishes of Mrs. Aimwell hath engaged me to furnish, may not have been in unison with the feelings of the generality of my readers. I am aware, that when a husband and a father sit in judgment upon the productions of a beloved wife and daughter, an impartial decision can hardly be expect∣ed. If, however, I am considered as reprehensible, apologies will but augment my error; and therefore, after addressing a few lines to my young friend, Miss Aimwell, I put a period to those efforts, which have had their origin in a tender anxiety for the improve∣ment and felicity of the young proficient.</P>

<HEAD>To Miss SOPNIA AIMWELL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY GOOD YOUNG LADY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BLUSH not at receiving a letter from an old man, who is a sincere admirer of your sex, and who cannot see an amiable and deserving young girl, but he imme∣diately becomes interested in her movements, and anx∣ious relative to her destination. Borne on the wings of imagination, he pierces the envelopement of futurity, he contemplates her, established a useful and important member of society, at the head of a well regulated family, or performing a subordinate part with that pro∣priety, in which consists the prime excellence and val∣ue of existence. If he reverses these agreeable expecta∣tions, he beholds her adding to the circle of frivolity, seeking to fill up time by pursuits unworthy the atten∣tion of a rational being, and turning with disdain from those qualifications, which are justly reckoned among the first acquirements in female life. Surely, the <HI>af∣fected idler,</HI> who boasts an <HI>utter detestation of family at∣tentions, and a total ignorance of domestic duties;</HI> who, absorbed in the multifarious enchantments of cards, scandal and fashion, becomes ardently ambitious of being considered as elevated to the very <HI>summit of insig∣nificancy,</HI> is truly and disgustingly ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="034162_0554_0FFC7099294B9438"/>
I will own to you, young lady, that in proportion as I conceive the charming maid is about, by her blameless and praise-worthy conduct, to add to the respectability and dignity of human nature, or to in∣crease the number of useless triflers, who wear away their hours without <HI>plan, object, or even motive,</HI> I feel inclined to bestow my benediction, or otherwise, to yield to the impulse of contempt; and I will further confess, that I generally make my admeasurement of the destined progress of the interesting adventurer, by the commencement of her career.</P>
<P>Your mamma intimates that you love my Marga∣retta, and that you will be influenced by the Gleaner. This information points the ardour of my wishes as they relate to you, and renders me doubly solicitous respecting those occurrences, the effects of which, in a great measure, depend upon the use you make of your present hours. A young lady has taken a capital step, and obtained an admirable basis for the super∣structure of improvement, when she learns properly to appreciate the value of time. Those important moments in which you may secure a fund, that will serve as the resource of revolving years, are rapidly passing off; and it should be your care, to mark them by such attainments as may endear you to your friends, and render you acceptable to society at large.</P>
<P>Your predilection for me will induce you to read attentively the letters of Margaretta and her mother, which have been produced to public view principally for your emolument: But do not, my dear, accept their sketches of persons, writings and events, merely upon trust. With the best intentions in the world they may have erred; and I recommend it to you, to turn to the several authors they have occasionally mentioned, and after a careful perusal of the volumes from whence they deduce their conclusions, compare your ideas with their's; let me know the result; and thus give me an opportunity of tracing the coinci∣dence, which I persuade myself will appear in the sen∣timents of elegant and informed minds. If Miss
<PB N="209" REF="034162_0555_0FFC7097524F2240"/>
Aimwell accommodates herself to my wishes, deter∣mining to grant a request, which is made with even paternal fervour, I am mistaken if her mamma will again have reason to complain of her want of attach∣ment to her book.</P>
<P>But, trust me, dear Miss Sophia, it is hardly possible to possess any thing valuable, without a due attention to method. If you slumber away a large proportion of the twenty-four hours, and apply yourself to the pursuits of the day as chance or necessity directs, your life is a scene of confusion; what may be the work of <HI>any hour,</HI> is too often the work of <HI>no hour;</HI> and in the mean time you are squandering that which the wealth of both the Indies can never redeem. Summon, my lovely young friend, that resolution which is now, it may be, dormant in your bosom; indecision and in∣dolence are alike enemies to the proficiency of indus∣trious virtue. Resolve to appropriate your hours, and let their regular return present your needle, your book, your pen, or your pencil. Happily, yours is the age of flexibility, and a little perseverance will establish those habits, which will transform your ex∣ercises into the most essential requisites of your felicity. I can hardly conceive it possible to insist too frequent∣ly or too importunately upon the incalculable value of order. It seems to me to be the stamen of every important attainment; it may be denominated the central orb of virtue; and it influences, invigorates and beautifies, both the aggregate and the minutiae of life.</P>
<P>Reflect a little—You are summoned to make one in a party of pleasure; music, dancing, and all those so∣cial enjoyments that distinguish the convivial circle, it is expected will constitute the amusement of a scene, at which discretion is to preside. But as the occasion will require a more than ordinary attention to your dress, as alterations are to be made, and ornaments are to be procured, much time must be devoted to preparation; and as these particulars naturally come under the direction of your mamma, she engages to
<PB N="210" REF="034162_0556_0FFC7094C055D4A8"/>
devote herself to the business. But the question is, <HI>when will she commence her employment? ten days</HI> are to elapse previous to the promised period, and there is surely <HI>time enough.</HI> To-morrow the robe shall be made; the next day the head dress—and so on. To-morrow arrives, and the appropriated hours are still deferred; day after day revolves, and the necessary arrangements are yet at a stand! Mamma busies her∣self as chance directs, and she is occupied by her mis∣cellaneous avocations agreeably to the caprice of the moment. The important day at length presents, <HI>and nothing is done;</HI> what a scene of bustle and confusion succeeds; you must absolutely either tarry at home, or make your appearance very ill drest.</P>
<P>Should your house-maid be suffered to neglect or to perform the business of her station without a due respect to order, your apartments would exhibit a scene of anarchy, and you might chance to repose upon a bed badly prepared, or perhaps not made at all. Your cook, thrown from her accustomed routine of duty, would serve your table with spoiled viands; and you are to congratulate yourself that your mam∣ma possesses that spirit of government, which assigns to proper persons and hours the business of the day; thus producing that uniform regularity so essential to domestic tranquillity. But you are not only to <HI>admire,</HI> but also to <HI>imitate.</HI> If industry and method are so essential in the inferior occupations of life, they are more indispensably requisite in the important business of forming and maturing the talents, pointing the virtues, and educating that intellect, upon which depends the future conduct of the youthful voyager.</P>
<P>Excuse, my good young lady, these hints, and con∣tinue to cherish in your gentle bosom that flattering prepossession, which you have hitherto acknowledged for your sincerely attached friend,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PERHAPS there is not, in the gift of art, a more prevailing incentive to propriety of conduct, than the <HI>hope of reward.</HI> To look for a recompense, is very consistent with the dependent state of humanity; and it belongeth only to the Father of Intelligence, to move <HI>essentially</HI> and <HI>independently</HI> upon the great square of rectitude.</P>
<P>Reason no sooner begins to bud, than the child is stimulated to act rightly, by the hope of a sugar-plum, a gingerbread toy, or that more honourable inducement, a mother's approbating smile. The student calleth into action every effort, allured by the prospect of a new book, the eulogy of the preceptor, or an accelerated holi∣day; and the man of letters, while he indulgeth con∣templations congenial with his nature, is rendered more indefatigable in his researches, by the honest hope of a splendid name. As the love of fame is more or less influential on every mind, it may be properly charac∣terized a universal passion; and we conceive, that the expectation of an honorary, if not of a lucrative compensation, frequently bestoweth the motive, and furnisheth the prevalent excitement, to good and proper actions.</P>
<P>Under this persuasion we are induced to wish, that in every commonwealth, town and village, some par∣ticular guerdon was assigned, to be annually bestowed on such persons as had attained, in pursuits confessedly useful, a superior degree of excellence. I recollect, some years since, perusing a volume written by Mad∣ame de Genlis, which contained a circumstantial ac∣count of an institution, that would, if I mistake not, could I transcribe it accurately, exactly illustrate my
<PB N="212" REF="034162_0558_0FFC708ED51C76F8"/>
meaning. Unfortunately, Madame de Genlis is not in my library; and a sketch, drawn from a memory not remarkable for its tenacity, will be necessarily im∣perfect. However, without aiming at the method or language of this admired lady, it may be sufficient for my present purpose, if I am able to preserve the most prominent features of a narration that gave me much pleasure at the time, and indelibly impressed on my mind a high sense of the utility of an <HI>expressly specified public recompense</HI> for eminent or singular virtue.</P>
<P>The institution, which is beautifully and elegantly commemorated in the pages referred to, received its establishment at a very early period after the com∣mencement of the Christian era; It was the growth of Salency, a village in Piccardy, and owed its being to a St. Medard, who was a native of that peaceful hamlet, and sole proprietor of the territory. Surely, the mind of this St. Medard must have been chaste, elegant, and highly susceptible of every virtue. But those amateurs of excellence, who have not traced the Festival of the Rose in the highly embellished writings of the French authoress, are here presented with an op∣portunity of judging for themselves.</P>
<P>The institution is called, the Festival of the Rose: The prize contended for, is annually furnished—this prize is a hat, fancifully decorated with roses—and the elevation it confers, enhances its value far beyond all price. The candidates for this expressive emblem are females—it is always the reward of indisputable supe∣riority—all claims but those of virtue, are inadmissi∣ble—the distinctions which originate in the gifts of fortune, beauty of person, or grandeur of descent, in∣volve not the smallest pretensions to this honorary meed—and it is invariably adjudged by the voice of impartiality. The ceremonies attendant on the inves∣titure, are said to be the most ancient which are now extant. Many centuries have witnessed its influence, and have reaped from its excitements the most substan∣tial benefits. Three village maidens are proclaimed candidates for the ensuing year; and the ancestors of
<PB N="213" REF="034162_0559_0FFC708D50CB4D18"/>
these girls must be, for many preceding generations, persons of irreproachable lives and unimpeached man∣ners. What an irresistible motive is thus furnished for the observance of every rule of right! The desire of descending with honour to posterity, and of surviv∣ing even the icy darts of death in our offspring, is, I presume, inherent in every mind; and the knowledge, that a scrutinizing investigation of our actions would annually succeed, even after we had ceased to be visi∣ble upon this globe, would indubitably insure a more general and exact circumspection of conduct.</P>
<P>The claims of the three lovely competitors, when established by meritorious ancestry and personal worth, are formally presented to the Lord of Salency, whose office it is, to elect from this trio, the candidate whose conduct, on a strict investigation, he shall regard as the most faultless. Every considerable action is brought to view; the best possible information is sought; wit∣nesses are heard; circumstances are compared; the most upright conclusions are formed; and the Lord of Salency proceeds to proclaim the beauteous para∣gon, queen of the approaching year. Nor is his task invidious; for emulation, in the bosom of females, whose minds are properly turned, and who are edu∣cated with such splendid expectations, never degene∣rates into envy—they are sensible that an election must be made—they are within the circle of excellence—it is glorious to be considered as a candidate—to make one of such a trio, they have stood upon the verge of perfection—another year may witness a confirmation of their claim—they have only to commence anew their efforts—those efforts which the corrosive murmurs of discontent would forever blast—and they hesitate not to join the acclamations, which responsive hail the lovely <HI>competitor.</HI> Many days previous to the ceremo∣ny attendant on a bestowment of the prize, the name of the successful candidate is publickly announced, and the sacred aisles reverberate her praises; a certain day in the year is appropriated to the celebration of this festival; its revolution is rendered important, by the
<PB N="214" REF="034162_0560_0FFC70876F5366F8"/>
reward it confers on virtue, and it is graced, by every effort of rural taste. It is selected from the vernal season—its pleasures are long anticipated, and its dawn is marked by all the fervour of youthful expec∣tancy, sanctioned by the matured complacency of lengthening years. To the sequestered haunts of vir∣tue, the Lord of Salency shapes his path, and he en∣ters, with a kind of veneration, a cottage which has reared to maturity such transcendent excellence; he receives the hand of the daughter of worth, and he conducts her, who is arrayed in all the charms of tri∣umphant modesty, to receive the reward, deliberately and righteously adjudged to merit.</P>
<P>The rays of royalty have sought to cast over this institution, additional lustre. A monarch of France, persuaded of its beneficial effects, and charmed with its simplicity, dispatched a favourite nobleman, who was commissioned to present to the matchless maid a ring of value, with a ribbon of expressive blue; and from this epoch the crown of roses is adorned by a blue ribbon, which flows therefrom in graceful stream∣ers; while amid the time honoured wreath, a ring obtains a conspicuous situation; and the chosen maid∣ens, who are selected to make up the train of the queen, wear on their shoulders a blue ribbon in the manner of a scarf; thus carefully preserving the memory of an attention, which they naturally regard as truly dignifying. The queen, <HI>on the day of her coronation,</HI> is distinguished by every possible mark of elevation; the procession is interestingly and pleasing∣ly affecting; the new elected sovereign is attended by twelve young girls, arrayed in white garments, and decorated by blue ribbons fancifully disposed; twelve youths, who likewise wear the uniform peculiar to the day, form her escort. She is preceded by bands of vocal and instrumental music; and the commencement of the procession is announced by the martial, deep toned, and animating sound of the drum. The streets of the happy village are lined by long and thick ranges of admiring spectators, who are collected for
<PB N="215" REF="034162_0561_0FFC7085EB8F3EC0"/>
the purpose of rendering to merit the voluntary hom∣age of the heart. Through these ranks the dignified maiden passes along—every tongue joins to applaud, and spontaneous benedictions mark her footsteps. On the lips of the surrounding matrons dwells the eulogy of discretion—assembled fathers hail the auspicious era; they recount the meritorious maidens whom they have seen thus triumphantly conducted to the fane of virtue, they compare the present with the past, and, divested of every particle of misanthropic rancour, they mingle in the mirthful train.</P>
<P>In the centre of the temple, a consecrated seat is converted into a kind of temporary throne, which, adorned with more than regal splendor, receives the elevated nymph. Religious rites succeed, which having performed, the venerable clergy lead the van, and the Lord of Salency, taking the hand of the elect∣ed lady, is joined by her appropriated train, and fol∣lowed by the populace, who in goodly numbers throng the streets, while loud and continued acclamations are heard, until they reach the chapel of St. Medard, when a sudden and affecting silence pervades the whole of this promiscuous multitude. The officiating clergyman then holding in his hand the emblematical∣ly decorated hat, with a solemn and affecting tone of voice, pronounces thereon a blessing. He expatiates with devout energy on the ways of wisdom, <HI>they are indeed strewed with flowers.</HI> Behold how bending thousands prostrate at the shrine of virtue; see how well, even in this life, her votaries are rewarded; ob∣serve how lovely is her appearance; she is captivating as the morning of life, beautiful as heaven, and grace∣ful as the daughters of paradise. Thus proceeds the man of God, still holding the crown of roses, while the enchanting maiden kneels at his feet. What an ele∣vating and truly interesting scene! how deep must be the impressions of such a moment! what noble incen∣tives to rectitude are hereby furnished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the spectators are universally affected; the humid drop glitters in every eye; while not a heart but melted by the sweet
<PB N="216" REF="034162_0562_0FFC70845C371178"/>
and persuasive voice of truth, seemeth to experience on the spot, the intuitive glow of virtue. Religion appears enrobed in loveliness; a kind of pious awe is conspicuous in every countenance; while the priest, having in a dignified, animated, and solemn tone of voice, completed his pathetic eulogium, places upon the meritorious head, that crown which in the estima∣tion of reason, is of more intrinsic value than all those splendid gems that ever yet encircled the brow of royal∣ty. The solemn act of coronation thus decently and properly performed, a <HI>Te Deum</HI> commences, in the course of which, the procession is again formed; and the blooming sovereign, attended as at the first, and dis∣tinguished by her well earned crown, enters once more the church; and, proceeding to the middle of the choir, takes her stand as before, exhibiting, until the conclusion of the service, an example of modest and genuine devotion.</P>
<P>The rites of public worship being concluded, our young queen hath next to receive the renewed homage of an affectionately attached and crowded audience, who attend her to a consecrated spot, fitted up by the hand of rural elegance, in which beautiful recess, this daughter of excellence, and queen of innocence, is met by duteous and expecting subjects, who approach her with those simple gifts that make up the riches of the village swain, and which she receives as the volun∣tary tribute of well disposed loyalty. She is then es∣corted with the same demonstrations of respect, to her usual place of residence, where it is at her option to spread for her noble conductor and his retinue, the feast of innocence. This feast consists of all those ru∣ral delicacies which are in the gift of elegant simplic∣ity; and the healthful viands, disposed by the hand of taste, constitutes a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repast, becoming the hilarity of virtue, and well suited to the guests, who are sum∣moned to partake thereof. If I mistake not, Madame de Genlis informs us, that there have been instances, where the crown of roses has been, for many succes∣sive years, decreed to the same individual candidate,
<PB N="217" REF="034162_0563_0FFC7082D42954C8"/>
until, perhaps, (for the diminution of virtue so illustri∣ous, could not but be marked with exquisite regret) the lovely model had sunk the claims of maidenhood, in those more complicated duties, which are involved in the dignified character of a matron.</P>
<P>If it should be imagined that our fair authoress in the recital, from which the foregoing particulars are rec∣ollected, is leading us over the enchanting grounds of fiction, it is still capable of improvement; and the scheme, although the offspring of imagination, may, nevertheless, when made the subject of legislative con∣sideration, suggest hints, and be productive of plans, friendly to the cause of every species of excellence. From conspicuous rewards of merit, the female world seem injudiciously excluded. To man, the road of preferment is thrown open—glory crowns the military hero—the bar, the pulpit, the medical career, the hus∣bandman, the merchant, the statesman, these all have their <HI>points</HI> of <HI>eminence;</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> blended <HI>with first rate abilities, may conduct their possessor even to the Presi∣dential Chair of the United States.</HI> But the sex, agree∣ably to existing regulations, can enjoy but <HI>secondary</HI> or <HI>reflected</HI> fame; and he, who shall be happy enough to add a new motive, to those virtues which are natal in the female bosom, will, undoubtedly, deserve well of mankind.</P>
<P>On this subject I am reminded of an observation I lately heard from the lips of <HI>one</HI> of the most valuable of our countrymen. In our hostile fields he contin∣ued a long tried and well approved veteran; <HI>and his victorious arm, since the completion of the revolution, hath been employed in quelling an audacious insurrection.</HI> In the bosom of peace he is a respectable and illustrious citizen, actively engaged for the promotion of the general weal; his leisure hours are, nevertheless, devoted to literary pursuits; and his well written manuscripts, will, I pleasingly believe, enrich this younger world with a number of truly elegant and useful productions. This Christianized sage observed,—He had often thought that in proportion as the
<PB N="218" REF="034162_0564_0FFC707E77BAB170"/>
female proficient advanced in the career of excellence, in exact such proportion she <HI>regained her superiority in the scale of being. "It is evident,"</HI> said he, "<HI>that the woman was originally the head of the man,</HI> for thus the sacred text pronounceth—<HI>The consequence of thy trans∣gression shall be, that thy husband shall rule over thee,</HI>" from whence he inferred, <HI>that, previous to her declension, she was invested with sovereignty;</HI> otherwise, her supposed punishment must have been considered as an unmean∣ing parade of words.</P>
<P>Perhaps the desire of sway attributed to females, may invest this idea with a powerful stimulus to pro∣priety of conduct; and yet I should question the sta∣bility of a superstructure erected upon such a founda∣tion. But I am, nevertheless, free to own, that if I cannot implant <HI>intrinsic</HI> worth, I have imagined, that even the <HI>semblance</HI> thereof bestows upon society a fairer polish, and is attended by more <HI>salutary consequences, than a total neglect of appearances.</HI> For if the conduct, from whatever motive, is irreproachable, and the tur∣pitude of the heart is confined therein; it is the indi∣vidual alone who can be considered as the sufferer.</P>

<P>HAD indulgent Heaven entrusted me with the care of a young family, I should have been solicitous to have implanted in their opening minds, as early as possible, a fervid wish for as great a share of <HI>independ∣ence,</HI> as might have consisted with that <HI>subordination,</HI> in which they were designed to move. He, whose prin∣cipal funds of enjoyment are securely laid up in his own breast, can draw his bills without the incumbrance of formalities; and, as he will be in little danger of
<PB N="219" REF="034162_0565_0FFC707CF26C5EF8"/>
making false calculations, he will rarely ever find them protested. A spirit of independence naturally involves an attempt to call into action those efforts, from which the respectable establishment at which we aim, must generally result; and he, who possesses ability to shape his own fortune, provided integrity is the main spring of his movements, will assuredly find the justice of his claims upon the esteem of mankind fully acknowl∣edged.</P>
<P>I should not be so anxious respecting the particular employments of my children, if their avocations were reputable, as that their talents and qualifications might be such, as would give them to fill their stations with advantage to those with whom they were con∣nected, and with honour to themselves. An attempt to bias the mind of a child, can hardly be justified by reason: Nature should make her choice; and the parent, with all those aids he may be able to command, should implicitly follow her direction. Yet, while I acknowledge the propriety of such a procedure, I am free to own, that ambition, irresistibly operating in my bosom, would spontaneously point my views to the learned professions; and was the suffrage of my wishes decisive, I should certainly qualify my son to take upon him the duties of an able lawyer. I am aware that it is commonly supposed such an election is un∣friendly to the morality of the individual thus appro∣priated; but, I am very far from adopting this prej∣udice; it is unquestionably rational to conclude that he who is constantly occupied in the contemplation of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong,</HI> in weighing the merits of the various pretensions which may come under his observation, will find his understanding enlarged and informed—will learn properly to appreciate; and <HI>if his mind is rightly turned,</HI> he will naturally become enamoured with the beauties of virtue, and evince an utter dere∣liction of vice.

that truly illustrious patriot,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is perhaps unnecessary to observe, that this Essay was written previous to the accession of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> illustrious personage to the presidential chair.</NOTE> John Adams, Esq. Vice-President of the Union; a man who is not only the pride and ornament of Columbia, but who is also rendered, by his rare abilities, highly eminent amid those celebrated nations of the elder world, where science, virtue and patriotism invariably command the meed of well-earned applause.</P>
<P>I once knew a lawyer, (but he is now dead to me) nature had stamped upon his breast her most exquisite sensibilities. Integrity, too, was the prime source of his actions; he would never accept an exorbitant fee; he uniformly refused to cloud the pure atmosphere of his understanding, by those pleas which are condensed in defence of a bad action; and as he was constantly the advocate of virtue, if he ever lost a cause, the odium rested either with the jury, or with those hon∣ourable Judges, to whose special verdict the decision was referred. About the skirts of his heart no chica∣nery ever hung; and while he possessed an infinitude of ready wit, in the most intricate pleadings which he was ever necessitated to deliver, he uttered no sentence which originated in sophism, or which would not bear the closest investigation of reason.</P>
<P>Quickness of perception, brilliancy of imagination, fluency of expression, and pointed wit—these are among the qualifications which <HI>he</HI> ought to possess, who would assume this important profession; nor can the young novitiate attain to any considerable degree of eminence, however fervid his pleadings may be, if those requisites are not, in some measure, inherent in his nature. But when these are all embodied, led on by judgment, and retained in defence of truth, what can resist their prog∣ress? An action may be sometimes so intricate, as to require the best informed judgment to develope its complexure; and yet it is true that a sudden thought may turn the whole course of the pleadings, which, from apparent necessity, had almost extorted a mani∣festly cruel, or, perhaps, <HI>in effect,</HI> unrighteous verdict.</P>

Doubtless, my readers have frequently admired the pleadings of the ingenious Portia, in the Merchant of Venice. Suffering the terrors of apprehension for the worthy Antonia, we are ready, in his favour, to break the staff of justice, and to violate those laws by which the sacred bands of government are closely bound, and all its salutary and essential rights protected. We listen with eagerness to the newly announced advocate; and we experience a degree of horror while we hear him pronounce, <HI>that the Venetian law cannot deny</HI> the forfeit: that there is no power in Venice can alter a decree, &amp;c. &amp;c. Yet we are soothed by his beautiful expostulation—<Q><HI>The quality of mercy is not strained; it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven, upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed; it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</HI></Q> But the sentence is passed!—Antonia must prepare his bosom for the knife! and we are ready to wish ourselves possessed of the power of the basilisk, that so we might dash from ex∣istence the inhuman Shylock, who stuns us by his vociferations. <Q><HI>A Daniel come to judgment; yea, a Daniel. O wise young judge, how I do honour thee,</HI></Q> &amp;c. But if our indignant feelings are wrought up to the highest pitch, how exquisitely gratifying is the instan∣taneous transition; and how do we echo those applau∣ses bestowed on the disguised Portia, when she emphat∣ically proceeds to say, <Q><HI>Take thou thy pound of flesh; but in the cutting, if thou dost shed one drop of Christian blood, thy lands and good, are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate,</HI></Q> &amp;c. Thus, upon a single thought, obvi∣ous when conceived, the scene of death is changed; justice preserves her sacred rights, and mercy beams triumphant.</P>
<P>Every reflecting mind must have remarked how frequently the concatenation of ideas associates remote resemblances, and under this influence, the develope∣ment produced by Portia, brings to my recollection a little narrative that I received from a person of intel∣ligence and observation. It is not, either in its process or object, so sanguinary as the tale arranged by Shake∣spear;

yet, as in lieu of the enchantments of fiction, it connects the credentials of truth, it may, in that view, as well as from the circumstances it involves, arrest the attention of the reader.</P>
<P>A gentleman residing in one of the small towns in the neighbourhood of the city of Dublin, and possessing a genteel competency, not only supported the reputa∣tion of an ancient family, but even added additional lustre to those claims his ancestors had possessed upon the esteem of mankind. He knew the full value of the independence he enjoyed; and, although genuine hospitality, that true Hibernian trait, sustained no diminution in his individual character (his style of living being in fact munificent) he was yet well aware that the observation of a regular system of economy was the surest foundation for the continued exercise of that liberality which was inherent in his nature. Having no offspring of his own, he had taken into his house a favourite nephew, who naturally be∣came the object of all those tender feelings and various emotions that succeed each other in the bosom of a parent. His education was on the most liberal plan; and every incitement to improvement was generously furnished. The judicious arrangements which had been adopted, were crowned by success, and the young gentleman attaining his twenty-first year, pos∣sessed a mind well informed, admirably intelligent, and extensively accomplished. It was a received opinion that he would succeed to his uncle's estates, and the youth himself had imbibed, as a matter of course, these reversionary expectations. The old gentleman was sensible of this consequence of his indulgent pat∣ronage, and it became to him a source of anxiety. He saw it probable that his nephew, entertaining an idea that a respectable establishment was already secured to him, would aim at no meritorious achievement—that he would devote himself to a life of imbecile inactivity, supinely passing those hours which should be marked by application, diligence and usefulness; and, solicitous to teach him properly to estimate his own value; to
<PB N="223" REF="034162_0569_0FFC7072D8B66698"/>
rouse to action the energies of his soul, and to open his views to those resources which depended entirely upon himself—he deliberated long, fondly struggling with that ardent affection which nature had authorized, and habit confirmed. At length, however, he had recourse to an expedient that was, perhaps, as singular as it proved propitious; and on the evening of a se∣rene day, devoted to literary ease, our good old gen∣tleman summoned his nephew to his closet, address∣ing him to this effect:</P>
<P>"I think, Sir, it is now some months since you have written Man, and from your first dawn of being, I have still supported you. Nature hath furnished you with solidity of understanding, and she hath connected therewith great brilliancy of imagination; nor have the aids of education been wanting. Perhaps my plans have been too extensive; but the event will either furnish my acquittal, or fasten upon my mind a con∣viction of error. I have hitherto discharged to you, Sir, the part of a parent; you have been in all respects distinguished as though you had been in fact my son; yet you are not my son; you are only my brother's son. You possessed no legal claims upon me, but I have qualified you to shape your own fortune, and that too in a reputable and genteel line of life: You know, Sir, that the necessary steps have been taken to furnish you with credentials for your appearance at the bar—those credentials you now possess; and your future eminence rests wholly on your own efforts. But you are yet to learn that from this night you are to look for no fur∣ther aid from me! I have provided two excellent horses, and an honest man to attend you in quality of a servant. With to-morrow's sun you must depart for Dublin, there to take such steps for your reputable establishment as your deliberate and best informed judgment shall dictate. Here are twenty guineas—they will serve you till you come to some decision. I sincerely wish you success; but whatever may be your circumstances or exigencies, expect no further favour from me, nor ever reckon on another shilling of my
<PB N="224" REF="034162_0570_0FFC70706B28DFB8"/>
fortune. This is the last time I will ever meet you until you are invested with that property and respec∣tability which shall give you a right to the independ∣ence that abilities like yours ought ever to command. Neither will I, until that period shall arrive, hold with you the smallest intercourse. This hour I draw the separating veil; and I am, with regard to you, to all intents and purposes, as if I had ceased to exist! Farewel, young man! May God go with you, and may the blessings of virtuous industry rest upon your head."</P>
<P>The careful, the paternal friend, having thus uttered himself, (to conceal emotions which he had till that moment governed) rushed instantly from the closet, and sought shelter in the retirement of his bed-cham∣ber; while the young man, sinking under a thousand mingling sensations, and almost petrified by astonish∣ment, passed the night in a manner which may be better imagined than delineated. He, however, knew his uncle too well to remonstrate; and, actuated by disappointment, tender regret, and perhaps a tinge of resentment, with the early dawn he bid adieu to that native village, and to those sweetly rural haunts, which, from his infantile days, had been to him an Eden of delight; where he had imaged all that he conceived of bliss, and sketched such years of happi∣ness, as never yet revolved since paradise was forfeited by man's transgression.</P>

<P>DEJECTED, forlorn, and almost despairing, our young adventurer reached Dublin. A spacious inn afforded him shelter; but, ah! how dissimilar to that paternal mansion he had perforce relinquished!
<PB N="225" REF="034162_0571_0FFC706EE1ACED08"/>
He wished for a retired apartment, and he requested to see the landlord. The host entered; and the eye of our sorrowful youth immediately marked a fixed melancholy which seemed to brood in every feature of his face. Softened by what he then conceived the most dreadful of misfortunes, his sympathetic feelings were easily arrested, and he spontaneously questioned—"What is the matter, landlord?" The landlord, unlike to other landlords, was not disposed to be com∣municative; he returned an ungracious answer, and as if to avoid further interrogation, abruptly quitted the apartment. "<HI>This poor man,</HI>" said our young proficient in the school of adversity—"<HI>this poor man is afflicted;</HI> affliction is fond of society; I will court his confidence, nor will I yield the pursuit until I have extorted the secret of his sufferings." Again he rang, and again summoned the landlord, who, with the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wo-begone countenance, made his second appearance. "Suffer me, Sir, to repeat my inquiries; I am not actuated by idle curiosity, but calamity seeks compan∣ionship; I, too, am a son of sorrow, and we may possibly aid each other." "<HI>No, Sir,</HI>" returned the landlord, "aid is out of the question; but my story is easily told, and it is too notorious for me either to expect or with concealment.</P>
<P>"This inn, Sir, with all that it contains, was once mine. The traveller, each day, contributed to aug∣ment my honest gains, and I deemed myself beyond the reach of indigence. But, alas! on one fatal evening, three gentlemen, apparently possessing integ∣rity, and abounding in affluence, took apartments under this roof: They were engaged in a law-suit, and they had claims to establish, which required time to investigate. They deposited in my hands a large bag of gold, to an immense amount, obtaining my promise that I would not deliver it, except the where party united to demand it. Some weeks had succeeded this transaction, when, going abroad in the morning, as I imagined to prosecute their business, one of the associates returned in great agitation, conjuring me to
<PB N="226" REF="034162_0572_0FFC706B65781638"/>
produce the gold, affirming that their cause was brought on, that they should obtain a verdict on that day, and, if they were not possessed of the immediate means of gratifying their advocates, it would be lost for want of the necessary efforts in their favour. In a moment of weak credulity, I yielded up the deposit, nor was apprized by a single foreboding of the ruinous consequences, until the return of evening brought the other two coadjutors. I met them with a face of con∣gratulation, concluding they had obtained a fortunate decision; but judge of my surprise when I learned that many days would probably elapse, before they could be gratified by a hearing, and that they had not yet made their arrangements. My astonishment was beyond expression; yet I was not apprehensive of the conse∣quences to myself. Conscious of my own integrity, I simply related the truth, and asked them what steps they would take? With abundance of <HI>sang-froid,</HI> they replied, they had no steps to take—they had deliv∣ered a sum of money to my care, obtaining my prom∣ise that it should continue as a deposit, not to be relin∣quished but at the united demand of the parties con∣cerned; and that, of course, they should assuredly require it at my hands! Nothing could exceed my consternation; they delayed not to make their requi∣sition, and they took care it should be attended by the legal formalities. Neither my abilities nor my incli∣nation admitted of a reimbursement so unjust. I made application to council, and was flattered by a certainty of a favourable issue. An action was speedily com∣menced. Pleadings have been heard, and lawyers' fees, together with many <HI>etceteras</HI> have exhausted my resources. I have been barbarously pillaged—to-mor∣row is the day appointed for a final hearing—ruin stares me in the face; and if I escape imprisonment for life, both myself and family must be turned out houseless wanderers, commencing in the evening of our days, the sad progress of indigence and beggary!"</P>
<P>"You are then positive that judgment will go against you," replied the young novitiate. "O, most un∣doubtedly,"
<PB N="227" REF="034162_0573_0FFC7068EA485740"/>
cried the landlord, "the law, I am told, cannot be wrested in my favour." "Permit me," returned our adventurer, "to obtain your confidence; you behold, in me, a person qualified to take upon him the part of an advocate for the oppressed; and, if you will join me to your council, I feel assured that your affair will terminate happily." "What, Sir," exclaimed the landlord, "are you seeking the glean∣ings of those hard earned gains, which your wealthy brethren have so rapaciously plundered? No, Sir, I have no more pieces to squander; and I should not be sorry, if I knew I should never more behold the face of one of your mercenary profession."</P>
<P>The young man, allowing for the petulancy of a person, who apprehended himself on the eve of becom∣ing the victim of misfortune, pointed by injustice, mildly returned—"It is necessary, landlord, in order to your being considered as my client, that I receive a retaining fee. I have, in my own mind, no doubt of obtaining a successful issue to your business; one guinea, however, will be sufficient; and if I do not procure a verdict in your favour, I pledge my honour that I will return it." The landlord drew up a heavy sigh—"<HI>You look like an honest man—you may be an honest man—God forbid that I should ever suspect an honest man. Here, take it—'tis my last piece, and may it redeem its master's property.</HI>"</P>
<P>Matters thus adjusted, the eventful morning at length dawned; the court was assembled, and the ad∣vocates for the plaintiffs and defendant prepared to call into action their most energetic abilities; while a respectable jury, arranged in due form, stood fixed in mute and solemn attention. The council for the plaintiffs urged, that the deposit had absolutely been made, and a promise obtained that it should remain as a sacred trust—they expatiated eloquently and learnedly on these facts; and they concluded with a solemn appeal to the jury, praying for a grant of that restitution, which they so justly demanded. The council for the defendant endeavoured to invalidate
<PB N="228" REF="034162_0574_0FFC70668471C588"/>
those affirmations, insisting on the expediency of strong∣er proofs. It was their plan to perplex, by cross ex∣amination, and at any rate, to procure a suspension of the final determination. In short, it became evident that <HI>law,</HI> and <HI>apparent</HI> justice, were for once constrain∣ed to appear in opposition to a decision, which the un∣biassed equity of every mind would have unhesitating∣ly pronounced; and no hope for the poor, despoiled, and betrayed landlord seemed to remain.</P>
<P>Just at this juncture our young gentleman produced himself at the bar. It was his first pleading, and his mien and gestures were marked by a graceful and prepossessing diffidence. His diploma was unques∣tionable, and he was announced as an advocate for the defendant. A confused murmur pervaded the court; and the council, on both sides, betrayed une∣quivocal marks of disapprobation. It being, however, beyond their power to contest his credentials, he was permitted to proceed; and, with a modest assurance, he concisely delivered his sentiments.</P>
<P>"My lords, and gentlemen of the jury—I stand up as council for the defendant; and to avoid giving this honourable court, and this respectable jury, any further trouble, we divest ourselves of every subterfuge—we acknowledge the justice of the pleadings of the council for the plaintiffs—we freely acknowledge the deposit, and the conditions on which said deposit was made; which conditions were, that no part of the property should be returned, without the presence of the parties severally interested; and whenever <HI>the three individuals, from whom we received the trust, shall all unite to make the demand, precisely conformable to the letter of the obliga∣tion, into which we entered,</HI> we are ready to deliver up the whole of the deposit, with which we were charged."</P>
<P>Astonishment immediately moulded the features of the court; the extricating expedient was so simple, so obvious, so exactly conformable to the <HI>letter,</HI> as well as <HI>spirit</HI> of equity, and in the same moment so replete with protection to the upright but too credulous landlord, that it was wonderful it had not before oc∣curred.
<PB N="229" REF="034162_0575_0FFC706402F6CA00"/>
But it is hardly possible to give an idea of the unbounded joy of an Irish populace, assembled upon such an occasion. Their sympathetic feelings had irresistibly engaged them on the side of the suffer∣ing host, who it seems had uniformly sustained the character of an honest man. Loud and affecting ap∣plauses reverberated from every quarter—they embrac∣ed the young advocate in their arms—they would have borne him to his lodging upon their shoulders, and they could hardly be prevailed on to remit these clamorous testimonials of their approbation. The landlord—but agreeably to my usual custom, on every of these occasions, I very freely bequeath the delineation of his transports, and his gratitude, as an exercise for the imagination of the susceptible reader.</P>
<P>To our young adventurer, the high road to fame and fortune was now thrown open; handsome grati∣fications were poured in from every quarter—he as∣cended with rapid steps the hill of eminence, and he soon became enriched beyond his most sanguine expec∣tations. The whole of the judicious plan, laid by his venerable, his paternal friend, now became obvious to his understanding; he sighed to embrace once more the hand of him, who, having endowed him with ca∣pability, had compelled him to those movements, from which originated his splendid fortunes; and or∣dering, upon a remarkable fine morning, a superb equipage, he took his way to his native village, at∣tended by every vestige of that independence, which his uncle had made the condition of their future inter∣course. The shades of evening brought him to those well known haunts, where he found the good old man, reclining in an arbour, which formed a fit recess for age and contemplation. With expressions of grate∣ful, duteous and unbounded affection, he instantly prostrated himself at the feet of this venerable parent, (whom he properly and pathetically hailed as his guar∣dian genius) and his reception exceeded his fondest hopes.</P>
<P>The old gentleman evinced his wonted firmness and dignity of character; but these prominent traits
<PB N="230" REF="034162_0576_0FFC70627AB08D28"/>
were, however, blended with all a father's tenderness. Having raised his nephew, he clasped him to his bos∣om—"You are welcome, my son—right welcome to these aged arms, and to this, your rightful heritage—Think not you have any information to give me—the faithful being, whom I bestowed on you as a servant, has been my constant correspondent; and, in conse∣quence of my instructions, he has proved a close ob∣server of your actions. No movement has been con∣cealed from me: and my emotions almost deny me utterance, while <HI>I pronounce that I know, and I approve.</HI>"</P>
<P>This respectably venerable sage continued, to life's extreme, a complacent witness of the elevation and confirmed celebrity of his nephew; and ere he closed the scene of mortality, his last rational act pronounc∣ed this son of his adoption the sole heir of all his pos∣sessions. Those of my readers who are acquainted with the private history of the celebrated Mr. Delany, one of the most able and eminent law practitioners in the city of Dublin, will readily recognize these outlines.</P>

<P>I PITY, from my soul, every candidate for literary fame! If they are warm in the pursuit, and en∣gaged with ardour in the profession of their election—if they are industrious in their application, and unof∣fending in their subjects, diligently labouring to endow them with every valuable property, of which they are susceptible—if the precepts they inculcate are enforced by the example of their own lives—if they do and are all this, they certainly have <HI>much merit,</HI> and are entitled to no stinted share of that applause, for which they are probably solicitous. But alas! how are their steps environed with peril! their family, their education, their persons, their characters—these all become stand∣ing subjects of conversation! while their matter, and
<PB N="231" REF="034162_0577_0FFC705E51DC4018"/>
their manner, are regarded as free plunder, and the invidious critic is deaf to the voice of candour!</P>
<P>What author but trembles at the critic's lash! and how many are deterred from the eventful path, by the ap∣prehension of the lion in the way! And was <HI>real merit</HI> soothed and encouraged, were faults detected and pointed out with mildness, was strict <HI>impartiality observ∣ed, and justice always the aim,</HI> I, for my part, should bid the lion roar on, wishing, very sincerely, that his terrors might become properly influential.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of some persons of sound judgment and great abilities, that nothing more is left for a modern writer, than to give a <HI>new dress to old ideas;</HI> but great men are not infallible, and possibly this con∣clusion may be rather hastily drawn. Solomon said "<HI>there was nothing new under the sun;</HI>" but since the days of Solomon, what profound discoveries have been made; how momentous, how honorary, and how useful! How have the arts and sciences improved, and how has knowledge increased in the world. The use of the loadstone—printing, that capital vehicle of in∣formation—the art of war, <HI>meliorated</HI> by the composi∣tion and use of gun-powder, &amp;c. &amp;c. while hardly a day passes, on the which novelty peeps not out.</P>
<P>It is, perhaps, true, that the heaviest charge prefer∣red against literary adventurers, is that of plagiarism: After an original thought, a hue and cry is raised—it is traced from author to author—the cheek of inno∣cence is tinged with the indignant blush, excited by suspicions of fraud; and a group of respectable char∣acters are supposed to stand convicted of the high crime of <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>wittingly purloining their neigh∣bours' goods.</HI></P>
<P>To condemn, upon presumptive evidence, is both treacherous and cruel, and it is a procedure which finds no place in the decisions of equity. I do not contend that plagiarism is never practised—far from it; I be∣lieve it constitutes the essence of many a volume, and that it is a kind of depredation, which is too often the <HI>dernier resort</HI> of the scribbler; but I <HI>insist,</HI> and I can
<PB N="232" REF="034162_0578_0FFC705CBB965D30"/>
produce proof positive of my assertion, that the charge of plagiarism is frequently <HI>unfounded,</HI> and consequent∣ly <HI>unjust.</HI> Originality is undoubtedly rare, and it is probable it will become still more so. A writer finds many subjects touched, and retouched, if not wholly ex∣hausted; and, should his abilities embrace a new ob∣ject, or even a novel arangement, he is condemned, ere he can establish his hypothesis, however self evident it may be, to combat the giant prejudice, to wage war with a host of cavillers, to oppose himself to the bur∣nished shafts of criticism, and to withstand the secret machinations of envy. But, every discouragement notwithstanding, I humbly conceive there is much more originality in the world, at this present time, than is commonly imagined.</P>
<P>What, I would ask, constitutes originality? or, in other words, cannot an original thought be twice con∣ceived? Let not the critic sneer, before he permits me to explain myself. An idea is expressed in conver∣sation, and a stander-by declares—"<HI>I had this moment the same thought, Sir.</HI>" Query: In whose bosom was the idea original? Suppose, that in the days of Ho∣mer, there had arisen, in the wilds of America, or in any other remote part of the globe, a genius, who had delineated every idea of that immortal bard, who had painted the charms of another Helen, arming monarchs and heroes in the licentious cause of a per∣fidious woman! whose fertile brain had teemed with other Hectors, skilfully opposing them to that Achil∣lean arm, which was nerved for their destruction; suppose his sentiments, his similies and expressions had been nearly similar; and, (since nature, liberal in her operations, might have produced a <HI>second prodigy,</HI> the suggestion cannot be justly said to wear the fea∣tures of <HI>impossibility</HI>) suppose proof irrefragable had been furnished, that not the smallest intercourse had subsisted between these children of indulgent munifi∣cence, and that they had not even a knowledge of each other's existence; should we not, in such an ar∣rangement, have characterized both bards, as possessing original excellence?</P>

For my own part, I am so far from regarding it as wonderful, that a <HI>similarity of talents should exhibit a similarity of ideas, and even of expressions, that I am really astonished such similarity is not more frequently demonstra∣ble.</HI> Let us reflect for a moment—Two beings, en∣dowed with strong understandings and clear percep∣tions, are educated in different and far distant parts of our world; but their language, their government, and particularly their religion is the same; from the same decalogue their precepts are drawn; virtue is the goal to which they are pointed, and from one source every excitement to virtue is educed. Matu∣rity is at length attained; and, setting down to con∣template a given subject, ought they to be accused of plagiarism, although their productions receive a kin∣dred stamp?</P>
<P>The good divine, whose mind hath been early im∣bued from that identical fount at which his cotempo∣raries have quaffed, receives a like education, and like academical honours; and with religious sentiments exactly corresponding with his brethren, he mounts the pulpit, and opens the sacred book, ordained at once a standard of his testimony, and the origin from whence he is to deduce those momentous truths, on which he is to expatiate. His text cannot vary, and he may be a stranger to the <HI>flagitious crime of stealing,</HI> although the branches growing upon one root, should resemble each other.</P>
<P>A writer may, <HI>without being a just subject of repre∣hension,</HI> enrich his page with the most brilliant thoughts of another; <HI>he may himself be deceived;</HI> from extensive and miscellaneous reading, scattered ideas, sentiments, and sometimes sentences, are collected. The volume of memory containeth many pages; and from child∣hood to ripening and declining years, what multifa∣rious images are inscribed thereon. From this reserv∣atory we naturally draw, and, it <HI>may sometimes happen,</HI> that ideas deduced from thence, <HI>may be mistaken for original productions of the mind.</HI></P>

I once had a friend—were I at liberty to name him, every individual, acquainted with his <HI>uncommon worth,</HI> would bow to his superior merit: Ah! how have his fine qualities and gigantic talents been ob∣scured by a train of adverse circumstances, all pointed and brought home to his bosom, by a natural propensity to melancholy. Unfortunate son of genius! I drop a tear over thy present misfortunes, while I recollect, with unabating admiration, the radiant commencement of thy career. I know it, dear Sir, this apostrophe is nothing to the present purpose; and I sit corrected.</P>
<P>This poet (for a genuine poet he verily was) possessed a strong understanding, with a correct judgment, and a glowing fancy; and, what is not commonly an appen∣dage to these advantages, his memory, also, was aston∣ishingly retentive; and he was as far removed from the <HI>practice</HI> as he was from the <HI>necessity</HI> of plagiarism. Our bard, thus highly qualified, employed himself one morning in penning a poetical epistle to a friend, whose abilities were respectable. The epistle finished, forwarded and received, was perused with much sur∣prize; for, strange to tell, it contained a number of lines that were found verbatim in a favourite author, with whose productions the person addressed had recently furnished his library! and <HI>said lines bore on their margin no quotation marks!</HI> It is the part of a <HI>sincere friend</HI> to point out a fault, and our poet was questioned on the subject; he detested plagiarism, and positively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his entire property in the problematic essay; but, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></HI>—the book was pro∣duced, and the poet eagerly seizing it, cast his eyes on the title page, which he no sooner traced, than instantly recognizing, he clasped it to his bosom with all that strong enthusiasm and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></HI> which ever marked his character. The volume proved an <HI>old acquaintance, which had been the delight of his boyish days, and of which he had long been in pursuit;</HI> and it appeared, that writing in a similar manner, and on the same topic, he had drawn those lines from the store-house of memory, where they had been many years safely lodged, un∣conscious
<PB N="235" REF="034162_0581_0FFC7054706EC208"/>
that the well adapted fugitives were not the <HI>true born offspring of his own brain.</HI> Now this, gentle reader, is a kind of plagiarism, if such it can be called, which cannot come under the description of fraud; and whatever may be the <HI>effect</HI> of its <HI>operation,</HI> it is in∣disputably <HI>guiltless</HI> in its source.</P>
<P>But, while <HI>I pledge my veracity</HI> for the <HI>authenticity</HI> of the foregoing anecdote, I readily grant that circum∣stances seldom concur to produce events of this com∣plexion; and, conceding thus far, I expect that every person accustomed to reflection, will unhesitatingly ac∣knowledge the propriety of what I have advanced, (viz.) <HI>that similarity of ideas and expressions, when the subject is the same,</HI> may often originate in different minds, evidently obtaining in those bosoms, where inborn integ∣rity and conscious propriety had implanted <HI>so strong a sense of right and wrong,</HI> as to create a just and spontane∣ous abhorrence to whatever could, <HI>in the remotest degree, be denominated plagiarism.</HI> I had lately an opportunity of conversing on this subject, with a female, to whom I am <HI>naturally attached</HI>—she has for many years been a scribbler, and she feelingly lamented that she had re∣peatedly seen ideas, and complete sentences, issue from the press, which had long been contained in her manu∣scripts, and which she had flattered herself with the privilege of presenting, as <HI>original thoughts!</HI> This, however, happened more frequent in her prosaic, than in her poetical productions; yet, even in the last, she adduced some instances of considerable similarity; from which, by way of illustration, and for the amuse∣ment of the reader, I take the liberty to select two. On the 28th of January, 1784, this penwoman wrote some lines on a particularly interesting occasion, which lines contain the following simile:
<Q><L>As the fond matron, while the flame ascends,</L>
<L>Which her whole int'rest in one ruin blends,</L>
<L>Wildly exclaims—Give me my infant train;</L>
<L>Possess'd of them, the strokes of fate were vain:</L>
<L>'Scap'd from the wreck, she sees her girls and boys,</L>
<L>And one short moment perfect peace enjoys.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="034162_0582_0FFC7052EA127A30"/>
<HI>Early in the year</HI> 1784, copies of the whole of this poem were put into the hands of several gentlemen, who may perhaps recollect it; but still it is <HI>only a manuscript;</HI> and it is not until within a few months, that she has met with that beautiful production, enti∣tled, the Botanic Garden, the offspring of an elegant European pen, <HI>first published in the year</HI> 1793; in which she observed, in the following highly finished lines, <HI>the same thought.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>" Th' illumin'd mother seeks with footsteps fleet,</L>
<L>" Where hangs the safe balcony o'er the street;</L>
<L>" Wrapt in her sheet, her youngest hope suspends,</L>
<L>" And panting, lowers it to her tip-toe friends:</L>
<L>" Again she hurries on affliction's wings,</L>
<L>" And now a third, and now a fourth she brings;</L>
<L>" Safe all her babes, she smooths her horrent brow,</L>
<L>" And bursts thro' bickering flames, unscorch'd, below."</L>
</LG>
<P>Now it is <HI>demonstrably certain,</HI> that neither of these writers <HI>borrowed,</HI> or, more plainly speaking, <HI>purloined</HI> from each other. Producing, therefore, the foregoing lines as a proof in point, I proceed to the second in∣stance. Previous to her perusal of the Botanic Gar∣den, she had been requested to write an ode on a very affecting occasion: This ode was to be publickly chaunted, for the benefit of a worthy young man; and it was an address to the benevolence of the audi∣ence. It is not my design to give the ode entire; I on∣ly transcribe the part which is necessary to introduce the lines that she imagined similar—thus they are expressed:
<Q><L>YE spirits bland, from heav'n descend,</L>
<L>Around this hallow'd temple bend,</L>
<L>With aspect all benign:</L>
<L>Philanthropy, first-born of truth,</L>
<L>Of paradise the fairest growth,</L>
<L>Replete with powers divine.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Hov'ring around, we feel you press,</L>
<L>This consecrated fane to bless,</L>
<L>Its pious rites to guard:</L>
<L>Benevolence, religion twines</L>
<L>With blest munificence designs,</L>
<L>And is its own reward.</L></Q>
<Q><PB N="237" REF="034162_0583_0FFC70510D611C20"/>
<L>Benevolence, whose genial sway</L>
<L>Commission'd hath the new-born day,</L>
<L>And burst the pris'ner's chains—</L>
<L>Its progress can arrest despair,</L>
<L>Can smooth the furrow'd brow of care,</L>
<L>While mild compassion reigns.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Thus, when enwrapt in Howard's guise,</L>
<L>To mortals lent from yonder skies,</L>
<L>And borne on mercy's wing;</L>
<L>The depth of human woe he sought,</L>
<L>With lenient balm assuaging fraught,</L>
<L>Returning light to bring—<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The ode was published; and the writer was some time afterwards attracted by a resemblance in the fol∣lowing energetic lines, found also in the Botanic Garden:
<Q><L>The spirits of the good, who bend from high</L>
<L>Wide o'er these earthly scenes their partial eye,</L>
<L>When first array'd in virtue's purest robe,</L>
<L>They saw her Howard traversing the globe;</L>
<L>Saw on his brow her sun-like glory blaze,</L>
<L>In arrowy circles of unwearied rays.</L></Q></P>
<P>Many are the instances, which, from my own indi∣vidual experience, I could record; and my volumes of manuscripts, that I was positive were enriched with many original thoughts, from my delay to publish, have now, alas! been generally forestalled. My plans, my ideas, my metaphors, <HI>ah, well-a-day!</HI> in almost ev∣ery thing I have been anticipated; and whenever my lucubrations are presented, <HI>innocent as I am,</HI> the prob∣ability is, that I shall find myself indicted in the high court of literature for the debasing crime of plagia∣rism! Yet these Essays, although the offspring of many a careful hour, deducing very possibly their highest charm from novelty, have now lost, even in my own estimation, much of their power to interest and to please; and I do not, I am free to own, very deeply lament their fate.</P>
<P>But a recent discovery having stripped of originality this my youngest born, <HI>my pet,</HI> that I have cherished
<PB N="238" REF="034162_0584_0FFC704DED23CD28"/>
with such unremitted tenderness, culling for it the fairest flowers, <HI>gleaning</HI> every sweet, and adorning it up to my best abilities; and now to find, that after all, I have been rearing the bantling of another! It is really almost too much for my philosophy to bear; nor can my atmost equanimity prevent the hag vexa∣tion from adding another score to those furrows, which time and disappointment have already so deeply indented!!!</P>
<P>No, I can never part with it—still it is the child of my adoption, and I must ever remain its protecting father. Sympathizing reader, I will tell thee the sto∣ry. Thou knowest how much I have prided myself upon the <HI>title</HI> of these numbers: It was ample enough for my purpose; it was unassuming; yea, as humble as the smallest particles which fall from the granary of the opulent dealer; and yet by the wonderful force of its elastic power, it could extend itself over the vast fields of science, wandering upon the superficies of the grounds, and snatching those gems which are some∣times the reward of industrious mediocrity.</P>
<P>It was, I have a thousand times said, a complete shield <HI>from every accusation of literary theft.</HI> It was—in short, it was abundantly commensurate with my most sanguine wishes; and what, in my estimation, inexpressibly enhanced its value, was, that I imagined it had <HI>never before been thus appropriated.</HI> Judge then, what were my sensations, when, two days since, turn∣ing over a volume written by Voltaire, I observed, among his account of literary publications, the follow∣ing paragraph, which, by way of exciting thy com∣miseration, I shall transcribe, verbatim.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Miserable pamphlets!—the Gleaner!—</HI> the Fault∣finder, &amp;c.—<HI>Wretched productions! inspired by hun∣ger, and dictated by stupidity and a disposition to lying! &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To find my <HI>boasted title</HI> thus unexpectedly flashed in my face; and to meet it, too, <HI>coupled with infamy!!!</HI>—But my feelings may be better <HI>imagined</HI> than <HI>described;</HI>
<PB N="239" REF="034162_0585_0FFC704BA048C928"/>
and the candid reader, while he acquits me of an in∣stance of <HI>plagiarism,</HI> so <HI>impolitic</HI> and so <HI>absurd,</HI> will not fail to sympathize with, and to vindicate</P>

<P>MANKIND are too prone to consider opulence and grandeur as synonimous with the first en∣joyments this world has to bestow; and every effort is made for the purpose of assuming that style of living, which may produce us candidates for a rank in assem∣blies that are frequented by persons who are pro∣nounced the first people in a village, a town, or a city. Alas! alas! how erroneous is this calculation! Under the smiling countenance, which, to the super∣ficial observer, appears the seat of contentment, what woes, what clustering evils may rankle! The broad laugh, descriptive of such extravagant marks of glee, why it may be the frantic expression of despair; while those contemplative features, where pensive re∣flection sits enthroned, may be the index of a mind attaining tranquillity by viewing persons and things precisely in that arrangement which ensureth compla∣cency. Appearances, it is undeniably true, are not to be trusted; and the experience of every day evinceth, that a superb house, rich furniture, and splendid equipages, are not always <HI>infallible</HI> marks of the af∣fluence of their possessor.</P>
<P>My friend, Pelatiah Carewell, was returning home∣ward, after a wearisome journey, taken for the dispo∣sal of some articles of traffic, for which his frugality
<PB N="240" REF="034162_0586_0FFC704977ACF5D0"/>
induced him to imagine he could not afford to pay the commissions consequent on committing their sale to other hands. Nearly exhausted by fatigue, he had hardly strength sufficient to urge forward his horse, who seemed equally as dispirited as his master. He was in an open sleigh, on a very rough road; it was in the inclement month of January, and the rude winds buffetted those locks which time had plentifully sprinkled with venerable grey. Thus was Carewell circumstanced, when a superb carriage, finished in the highest taste, passed rapidly by him; the horses, richly caparisoned, were in a foam; the curtains in the front of the carriage were closely drawn; it was attended by two servants, whose livery was perfectly well known to Carewell; and by a glance catched at the side glasses, he discovered a gentleman who was the companion of his boyish years. They were natives of the same little hamlet, were bred at one school, and began business with similar prospects. But Claudius had left the rural seat of his ancestors, and for many years had figured on a very large scale in the metrop∣olis. He had been a noted speculator, had dipped deeply in navigation, and had accounts open with ev∣ery capital house in and about the city. Carewell imagined the present expedition of Claudius had for its object a visit of state to his aged parents, who still continued at the village; and he reflected on the ele∣vated situation to which fortune had raised his quon∣dam school-fellow, with sensations tinged with the deepening hues of envy.</P>
<P>How partial, thought he, are the dispositions of what we term Providence; from the hour in which I could write man, I have observed a uniform system of economy; the beloved woman, who did me the hon∣our to accept my hand at the altar, hath exemplified, through her whole life, a perfect model of discretion. Frugality has been the order of our house: every un∣necessary expense has been absolutely precluded, and yet my circumstances are very moderate; and if I would not leave pennyless those whom I have intro∣duced
<PB N="241" REF="034162_0587_0FFC7047E5F42BD8"/>
into being, I am, in advanced life, necessitated to continue those exertions, and that rigid observance, which has attended me through my commercial career.</P>
<P>Claudius, on the contrary, entered on the privileges of manhood with marked avidity; he plunged head∣long into the stream of pleasure; he has never been known to deny himself a single indulgence; his build∣ings are magnificent, his furniture is in the highest style, his town and country houses are crowded with servants, his dress is that of a nobleman, his equipages are multiplied and splendid, and both himself and fam∣ily are in the first line at every place of public and private amusement. What, in the name of wonder, is the source of his prosperity? and to what cause am I to trace my own comparative depression?</P>
<P>Such were the murmurings of Carewell; he drew up a heavy sigh, and gloomy discontent pervaded his bosom. It was just at this juncture that the high sheriff of the county passed him, as it seemed, in full chace! This was a phenomenon that arrested the whole attention of Carewell; for an officer of justice had never before been known to visit the peaceful hamlet of B—. His curiosity urged him forward, and he had no sooner reached his own dwelling, than he learned that Claudius had been taken into custody, just as he was entering the door of that cottage in which he drew his first breath! that his fine estates were all attached, and that it was supposed, upon an equi∣table distribution of those possessions which Claudius had so nefariously obtained, his numerous creditors would not receive a single shilling on the pound!!</P>
<P>Carewell dropped a tear over the errors and the misfortunes of Claudius. He entered his little par∣lour—neatness presided, the blazing hearth had receiv∣ed the polish of industry, the kettle boiled for tea, the elbow chair was placed in order, and Amanda, with open arms, and a smile of rapture, welcomed his re∣turn. His children, too, crowded around him; and a little spruce waiting maid, under pretence of ar∣ranging
<PB N="242" REF="034162_0588_0FFA656AB7B7D310"/>
the tea apparatus, catched a peep; while a domestic, who had grown grey in his service, took the opportunity of replenishing the fire, to hail once more the benign countenance of his master. Carewell seat∣ed himself—his eyes and hands were raised to heaven, and exclamations the most extatic burst spontaneously from his lips.</P>
<P>"This decent and completely finished tenement is my own; my income, combined with my regular ex∣ertions, bestows on me the blessings of competency; every thing about me is elegant: Amanda is the most amiable and tender of women: my children come forward with dispositions that authorize the most pleasing expectations; no man can advance a demand which I cannot immediately discharge. What is show, pomp, and all the retinue of fashionable pleasures? real happiness dwells not with them. Gau∣dy apparel, cards, plays, assemblies—henceforth I spend no sigh on such frivolities. Contentment shall meet me in the bosom of my family, and gratitude, eternal gratitude, shall raise her altars in my breast."</P>
<P>Carewell and Claudius are contrasts which are strongly marked; but the intervening shades are many, and from their example more than one useful lesson may be dedu∣ced; the fallacy of appearances are strikingly exempli∣fied, and we learn to estimate the value of economy. We have said that profusion is not generosity; and the propriety of this observation must be sufficiently ob∣vious. Many a time has the humane and well design∣ing Eugenio been called to lament that his extrava∣gant benefactions to prostitutes, vagabonds, and par∣asites, have prevented his bestowing small sums, that would have furnished honest industry with the means of obtaining a livelihood. Society is not benefited by the shilling I squander on him, who, depositing it in the next whisky or rum shop, will issue thence a dis∣grace to his species, and probably in a state of inebri∣ety, which, rendering him incapable of attending to himself, may produce him, with dislocated or broken limbs, a burden on the next parish. But how clear
<PB N="243" REF="034162_0589_0FFC704527285A60"/>
are his claims on my property, who sues for the means of equipping himself with the implements of agricul∣ture, manufacture, commerce or navigation. The truth is, the necessity of <HI>discriminating,</HI> must be appar∣ent to every sober observer. <HI>Principle, plan, regularity, economy, charity</HI>—a wise man will embody every of these requisites, and to their combined administration he will constantly submit his movements.</P>
<P>Stories seem naturally to produce or grow out of each other; and a little narration, although perhaps not exactly analagous to the foregoing observations, floats, notwithstanding, amid the visions selected by fancy.</P>
<P>Flauntinetta was educated by the hand of discre∣tion; but it is not always that education can overstep nature, and Flauntinetta continued vain, silly, and consequently devoted to all the vagaries of folly. She lost her father in her infancy, who, reposing per∣fect confidence in the good understanding, integrity, and tenderness of her mother, had left the whole of a very decent property at her absolute and sole disposal; and committing also her daughter to her direction, he had resigned into her hands the authority with which nature had invested him. Flauntinetta was soon capable of calculating her mother's income; she knew she was in easy circumstances, and her warm imagination represented her funds as sufficient for ev∣ery thing, which vanity and ambition had taught her to consider but as reasonable appendages to a young lady of her figure and rank, and who was, besides, an only child. Honoria had educated her daughter on the most liberal plan; and, labouring to implant in her opening mind a persuasion that the mere exteriors of pomp were beneath her attention, no day past, in which she was not solicitous to instil some elevating principle or meliorating truth. Flauntinetta, how∣ever, continued refractory; she sickened for the haunts of dissipation; was never happy but when visit∣ing or receiving visits; and those public entertain∣ments, which she was not permitted to partake, were
<PB N="244" REF="034162_0590_0FFC7041C9A77750"/>
viewed with the deepest regret. Silks of the richest kind, laces of the highest price, jewels, &amp;c. &amp;c. these all made a part of her reprehensible wishes; and ev∣ery maternal check produced an altercation, during which she tacitly accused Honoria of mercenary mo∣tives, of undue severity, and want of affection.</P>
<P>Honoria, while she assiduously endeavoured to tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her views into a right channel, and to erect those cau∣tionary guards, which her tenderness and her anxiety convinced her were necessary, firmly persevered in prohibiting every improper indulgence. She was a <HI>discreet</HI> as well as a <HI>fond</HI> mother; and her affection was chastened by judgment. The circles in which she permitted her daughter to mingle, passed individ∣ually under her judicious inspection; and instead of the richly covered brocade or golden tissue, the gen∣teel person of Flauntinetta was habited in a neat, plain lutestring; her laces were chiefly English rather than Brussels; and whenever her muslins were wrought, the flowers were the result of her own in∣dustry. She was sometimes seen at a public assem∣bly, but more frequently at a play; and these amuse∣ments, with private dancing parties, occasional visit∣ing, and some rural excursions, during the fine weath∣er, constituted the routine of her diversions.</P>
<P>But these economical regulations were a constant source of vexation to Flauntinetta. "<HI>See, mamma,</HI>" she would exclaim, "<HI>how richly yonder lady is habited;</HI> she looks divinely enchanting, and absolutely moves a goddess." "And see, my dear," returned Honoria, "yon beauteous nymph, how exactly that plain mus∣lin is fitted to her elegant form; she is a lovely young woman; her countenance is an index of serenity, and I could almost venture to pronounce, that friend∣ship, truth and honour, with every feminine virtue, are the residents of her bosom." Still, however, Flauntinetta entirely disapproved her mother's con∣duct; and she determined, whenever fortune should put it in her power, to make herself large amends for
<PB N="245" REF="034162_0591_0FFC703F2D2AA328"/>
the penurious discipline to which she was, for the present, constrained to submit.</P>
<P>Thus rolled on the hours and days, which at length ushered in the destined morn, equally dreaded by Honoria, and wished by Flauntinetta. It was the morning that was to witness her espousals to a man of merit, and of handsome property. The beauty of Flauntinetta had procured her an establishment, that, had her mind corresponded with her person, would have been fully commensurate with those fine qualities she would then have possessed. And Honoria, ere she resigned that power over her daughter, with which nature and the confirming arrangements of her hus∣band had invested her, enforced with <HI>increasing ardour</HI> all those excellent precepts she had so often inculcated; but Flauntinetta heard her with alarming coldness, secretly resolving to disobey her in every particular! and she was no sooner a house-keeper, than, rushing into the stream of dissipation, she mingled with the most inconsiderate of its votaries, freely indulging in amusements which reason and discretion refused to warrant. Over the mind of her husband she obtained an entire ascendency, who was ready to exclaim with Milton's Adam, <Q><HI>That what she wills to do or say, seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best; all other knowl∣edge in her presence falls degraded.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Honoria still hovered round her, and like the mat∣ron bird would have pointed out the danger; but the prudent regency of Honoria was no more; and Flaun∣tinetta, who had ever regarded her mother in a false point of view, now triumphed in her liberty, constant∣ly receiving the admonitions of her anxious parent with an averted face, and such freezing expressions as would have thrown the icy darts of death at any affec∣tion less than maternal. A period of five years, how∣ever, terminated the career of vanity, and the catastro∣phe was truly deplorable! Sickness followed in the train of poverty, and a melancholy and premature death brought up the rear!</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="034162_0592_0FFC703D70345118"/>
Flauntinetta, the long incorrigible Flauntinetta, became a widow; and both herself and children were totally destitute!! It was in the moment of her ca∣lamity, that the eyes of her understanding being open∣ed, she consequently beheld the revered guardian of her youth, adorned with every virtue which can digni∣fy humanity; and, once more sheltered under the ma∣ternal wing, she hath, at length, learned to estimate the value of rational tranquillity.</P>
<P>To Honoria she feels the weight of her obligations; but even delicacy hesitates not to cherish and to avow the most unbounded gratitude to the source from whence existence is derived; and she is frequent and fervid in her acknowledgments, that she is indebted to the discretion and economy, which she so often and so madly profaned; that her children have yet a paren∣tal dwelling; that they are indulged with the means of education, and of making decent figures in those cir∣cles, in which their birth and their expectations give them a right to mingle.</P>

<PB N="247" REF="034162_0593_0FFC703A6B306198"/>
passions are frequently mollified and duly attem∣pered by acts of kindness: Yet it is a melancholy truth, that there are individuals who are proof against the interference of tenderness; and it is beyond a doubt, that in such instances coercive measures become absolutely indispensable. Adversity sometimes proves a powerful operator; it throws down the barriers reared by the impious hand of atrocity; it breaks in pieces the nefarious purpose; it assuages the tumult, and smooths the asperities of the soul; and it brings to light and establishes those sentiments of virtue, which were prostrate in the bosom. A well authenti∣cated illustration of this truth is strikingly presented in the records of a family, who have long been respectable dwellers in the State of New-Hampshire.</P>
<P>Mercator, an opulent gentleman, in the interior part of that division of our country, beheld the wealth he possessed, and all the independence it conferred, as the fruits of his own industry; and having in early life ate the bread of carefulness, he knew how to appreciate the harvest, consequent on his laudable exertions. He had laid in her grave the affectionate companion of his youth; but he continued wedded to her memory, and two boys, the only surviving pledges of their mu∣tual love, shared equally the affections of his bosom. Their education was precisely the same; but nature, true to herself, asserted her own prerogative; and, in defiance of every rule of art, produced them perfect contrasts to each other.</P>
<P>Acetus, the eldest, was a prodigy of vice! Deprav∣ed, to the utmost degree of which humanity is capable, he seemed to know no joy but in the most daring acts of atrocity; and it was wonderful that he stopped short of an ignominious death. Yet, although highly criminal, he, however, possessed the most insinuating address; and having the art to throw over his enormi∣ties the transient veil of concealment, he had obtained, while on an excursion at a distance from his native village, the heart of a truly amiable woman, whom he wedded; and it was hoped that a virtuous connexion
<PB N="248" REF="034162_0594_0FFC7037E1FF1448"/>
would produce his reformation. But ill habits are not easily corrected. The libertine too soon threw off the mask; and the misfortunes of the ill-fated Matilda, with her two beautiful children, were pronounced ir∣remediable!</P>
<P>Adrastus, the younger son of Mercator, was indus∣trious, frugal and discreet; and with the exercise of generosity and every ennobling virtue, he was familiar. To Acetus, as his eldest born, Mercator had appropri∣ated the better half of his possessions; and he pursued every method which involved the least probability of rendering him worthy his name and family: Alter∣nately he remonstrated, soothed and threatened; but Acetus was inaccessible to every mode of attack; and large sums, conferred by the indulgence of his father, instead of being converted to the aid of an injured wife and her helpless innocents, were devoted to the bottle, squandered at a gaming table, or lavished on prostitutes! Mercator had but one step more to take: He assured Acetus, that his succeeding to any part of his estates rested wholly on his total change of conduct. Acetus smiled at the unmeaning threat. That Mer∣cator should disinherit him, he conceived, an event not contained in the chapter of possibilities; and, confid∣ing in the <HI>severely tried affection</HI> of his father, he disre∣garded this, as he had every other previous measure, and persevered in the path of ruin!</P>
<P>Months rolled on. Mercator drew near the close of life; and, being in the full exercise of his reason, he deliberately proceeded, in the most solemn manner, to the constituting that testament, which, bequeathing to Adrastus, his youngest son, his vast possessions, pro∣claimed that young man his sole heir, and legally cut off all the prior pretensions and natural expectations of Acetus! A few succeeding weeks placed Mercator upon his death-bed; and his dissolution, accelerated, possibly, by the atrocious irregularities of his enor∣mously offending son, was speedy and unexpected!</P>
<P>The hopes of Acetus now utterly extinguished, all the energies of his soul took the alarm; and despair,
<PB N="249" REF="034162_0595_0FFC703571C758E0"/>
in his bosom, became the parent of the most astonish∣ing exertions! With a kind of sullen indignation, he strode from the mansion of his late father, and making sale of the few moveables which remained to him, in a tenement constituting a part of the paternal estate, and now devolving to his brother, he pathetically addressed the innocent victim of his unwarrantable irregulari∣ties: "Go, my Matilda," in a tone of despondency he exclaimed, "go—return to the scene of thy better days—<HI>I bless God that thou hast yet a father to shelter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>—Take these cherub children; bear them to the author of thy being—he will receive them—<HI>he is in∣deed a father</HI>—Acetus has no more a dwelling—<HI>I dis∣dain the little moment that I breathe under this roof!</HI> Leave me, my Matilda, sole object of my love and of my commiseration—leave, to his unparalleled mise∣ries, thy wretched husband. <HI>Acetus has not now the ability to provide for Matilda, or to succour her infants.</HI>" Through all the devious paths of vice, in which Ace∣tus had so daringly strayed, Matilda had never wholly lost that ascendency, which a mildly virtuous woman so naturally maintains, even in the bosom of culpabil∣ity; yet, on this occasion, her tears and her remon∣strances were ineffectual! On her bended knees she supplicated him still to continue her the partner of the woe-fraught scene—but she supplicated in vain; and, well near sinking under the mighty pressure of her calamities, she returned to that abode, which had wit∣nessed her early hopes and fears, and from whence, on the wings of high-plumed expectation, she had so late∣ly flown. But, to receive the hapless wanderer and her lovely children, a father's wide extended arms, and still more ample heart, were tenderly expanded; and she continued with this revered and natural protector, a melancholy and beautiful model of sweet propriety.</P>
<P>Acetus, penetrating very far into the interior part of the country, laid out what he had raised from the sale of his goods in uncultivated lands, which he pur∣chased at a low rate; and he immediately applied himself, with unremitted diligence, to the felling trees,
<PB N="250" REF="034162_0596_0FFC70318A64DBB0"/>
and all those preliminary arrangements, so necessary upon new grounds. To all his bad habits, in one de∣cisive moment, he bid an eternal adieu; and suddenly he became that very Acetus, which the good Merca∣tor had, through a long succession of years, laboured to produce. His efforts were prodigious; what man, industriously intent upon emolument, could accomplish, he assuredly did: But still he was alone; and having expended every shilling he could command in his orig∣inal purchase, he had not the means of procuring la∣bourers, nor could he obtain those additional grounds which were highly necessary to the completion of his estate. It was at this juncture, that the difficulties of his situation appeared to him in their most glaring colours, when a blank cover supplied him with bills to the amount of one thousand pounds! It was to no purpose that he diligently sought to investigate the source of this opportune relief; and, in a manner equally mysterious, sums, answerable to his <HI>real exigen∣cies,</HI> were from time to time furnished.</P>
<P>At the expiration of a few years, Acetus saw him∣self enriched beyond his most sanguine expectations. His grounds were extensive, remarkably productive, and uncommonly well stocked. His buildings were multiplied, many of them elegant, and all of them in excellent repair. Heaven smiled propitious on the re∣claimed prodigal, and all his enterprizes were crown∣ed by success.</P>
<P>In an elegant carriage, constructed for the occasion, Acetus appeared before the paternal dwelling which had sheltered his Matilda. The tender mourner had continued ignorant of the fate of her husband! Acetus was to be in all things eccentric! Mechanically she approached the window—she raised her humid eyes—Acetus issued from the carriage!—"Gracious Heav∣en!" she exclaimed, "continue my reason—my Ace∣tus approaches. My children, behold your father!" In a moment she was in the arms of her husband!—Acetus was restored to her—this circumstance was of itself calculated to render her, beyond expression, hap∣py
<PB N="251" REF="034162_0597_0FFC702D0F0DB2E0"/>
—But he was restored to virtue too—and was be∣come worthy, not only of the tenderness of an affec∣tionate wife, but of the approbation of reason, and the esteem of every good person.</P>
<P>Acetus, accompanied by the father of Matilda, spee∣dily removed his family to his own ample and commo∣dious seat. Arrangements, prescribed by discretion, and sanctioned by reason, now took place. Matilda was the charming directress, and happiness became the order of their lives. It was just one month after Ma∣tilda was reinstated in all those privileges and immuni∣ties, to which she was in every view entitled, that Acetus received the subjoined letter from his brother.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>ADRASTUS to ACETUS.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER, my Acetus, did a mere mortal experience more extatic feelings than I, at this moment, luxuriant∣ly enjoy. The night of mystery is passed, and the morning of elucidation breaks upon us—Acetus shall no more continue estranged from his Adrastus—I am emancipated from my bonds—events are fulfilled, and concealment is at an end. Inclosed, you have the <HI>last solemn act of our honoured father,</HI> with all those papers which should be its accompaniments. <HI>You will see it is written by his own hand</HI>—that it is duly witnessed and perfectly accurate. You will see, that conferring upon you a legal claim to one half of all his possessions, it indisputably confirms your natural right; and, you will also observe, that <HI>it is dated ten days later than the instrument, under which I inherit.</HI> Being a spectator of the strong emotions of his soul, while penning this <HI>last writing,</HI> a high sense of his paternal goodness, and of his unalterable attachment to <HI>his Acetus,</HI> is indelibly impressed on my bosom. Having completed the in∣strument, he inclosed it in an address to me, which, with all imaginable solemnity, he put into my hands. I transcribe it for your perusal: When we meet, the original shall be subjected to your inspection.</P>
<P>"My son, my dear Adrastus, preserve this writing, and, as you value my blessing, let no eye trace its con∣tents,
<PB N="252" REF="034162_0598_0FFA6571EC7FC8E0"/>
nor ear hear its purport, until the full time shall arrive, which I have assigned for its operation; and, Adrastus, <HI>observe me well,</HI> in proportion as you are faith∣ful to me, and my poor unfortunate wanderer, may the benediction of our God rest upon you. I doubt you not, Adrastus; but a business of such importance demands all your integrity, and the strongest energies of filial and fraternal affection. On my demise, let the testa∣ment first ordained, which constitutes you my sole heir, come into immediate operation—let it not be suspected that there exists any other disposition of my property; and, I charge you, Adrastus, be unto your brother as his guardian angel—observe, carefully, the effect which my <HI>supposed severity</HI> will produce; if, as I flatter my∣self, it should rouse to action those energies now dor∣mant in his soul—<HI>if it should blow to a flame the latent spark of virtuous industry,</HI> follow him with such assist∣ance as his wants and his exigencies may require—<HI>Permit a momentary struggle, but O! let it not be unneces∣sarily severe, nor too long continued;</HI> and, above all things, keep him in ignorance of the source, from whence he receives the benefits which you are to confer. Every thing, my Adrastus, is entrusted to your discretion—let it not fail you in this, the most arduous transac∣tion of your life! When years have rolled on, and your brother shall be confirmed in habits of rectitude—(and, at this moment, a <HI>holy confidence in the common Fa∣ther of our spirits,</HI> assures me that this period will even∣tually succeed) when he shall learn to do justice to the virtuous Matilda—when he shall have passed one irre∣proachable month with that lovely and incomparable woman—then—and, <HI>by the sacred authority of a father, I command you, not till then,</HI> let my last will be put into his hands; let it be accompanied with a regular ac∣count of the interest, which may have accrued on those possessions, which, but for his continued irregularities, should have devolved to him at the period of my death; and, after reimbursing yourself for the sums you may, from time to time advance, let the full arrearages be de∣livered up.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="034162_0599_0FFA6575D2EEDCE0"/>
"Thus, my Adrastus, while the sigh of anxiety swells my bosom, I repeat that I have constituted you the guardian, <HI>during the continuance of his insanity,</HI> of your unfortunate brother. My sons are equally dear to me. Acetus has wandered in oblique paths; but Heaven will restore him, and the transporting event, even in the region of blessedness, shall augment the enjoy∣ments of your tenderly attached father."</P>
<P>Well, my brother, you have read, and your feelings doubtless correspond with the occasion; the bounty of our honoured father has still followed you; his paternal goodness has been the continued source of your emolument; his revered memory is now exone∣rated from every reproach; and I deliver up the trust reposed in me with more gladness of heart, than I should experience in the succession to a princely inher∣itance. <HI>Adrastus shall no longer be banished from the dwelling of his Acetus. Family harmony will again triumph,</HI> and my utmost wishes will be fully gratified. With to-morrow's sun I will embrace my brother, and the ever lovely Matilda. Do me the favour to speak of me to your children; my introduction will be less formal, and I am impatient to clasp the youthful strangers to my bosom. Accept the fraternal saluta∣tions of your unalterably attached</P>

<Q><L>Customs, time honour'd, let us still revere;</L>
<L>Stampt by antiquity, they have their worth,</L>
<L>When in the train of wisdom they appear,</L>
<L>And are of truth and gratitude the growth.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a common practice to arraign the despotism of custom; and, <HI>lovers of liberty,</HI> we revolt from every thing which would begirt us with the lines of necessity. The truth is, depraved nature spurns at government of every description; and since the fatal
<PB N="254" REF="034162_0600_0FFA65799FE94FC0"/>
era which engendered pride in heaven, and plunged a third part of its denizens into the abyss of guilty dis∣obedience, a spirit of disorganization hath prevailed; and it is only in proportion as the disorders in the mental world are rectified, and the mind informed, that we become solicitous for the general good, and are confirmed proselytes to the beauty and propriety of order. It is undeniably true, that customs, inju∣rious to the well being of society, have sometimes ob∣tained undue influence; against these, to set ourselves in array, is laudable; but still, those rules which have obtained the sanction of revolving ages, should not, it appears to me, be discarded for trivial inconvenience.</P>
<P>My reflections have been thrown into this train by a little incident, and a simple tale, which perhaps I cannot do better than narrate, as the subject of this Essay. It was on the evening immediately preceding our last annual Thanksgiving Day, that a worthy tradesman, seated in my parlour in a contemplative at∣titude, with folded arms, and eyes fixed on the cheer∣ful hearth, as if he was preparing to pronounce a pane∣gyric upon the beauties of my fire side, very gravely re∣marked: <Q>This Thanksgiving Day is really an im∣position on the free citizens of this State. It hath absolutely swept away more of my running cash, than would have supported my family decent∣ly for a full month. I declare I should rejoice greatly to see the observance of a period, which orig∣inates so much extravagance, erased from our cata∣logue of old fashion customs, and I would very readily sign its death-warrant.</Q> There is some reason in your complaint, said I; and if it has noth∣ing to recommend it but barely custom, I also would freely consign said day to oblivion. It is true, it may be urged, that it is rational and pious to devote a par∣ticular day to offer up our joint praises, and to manifest our united gratitude to that omnipotent and all-gra∣cious Being, who gives us so richly to enjoy; but to this it will be replied, that our orisons and thanksgiv∣ing ought to ascend with every returning day, that
<PB N="255" REF="034162_0601_0FFC702B7526C020"/>
God is not now honoured by the blood of those inno∣cents, which are the usual victims of a Thanksgiving Day; that luxury enervates both bodily and intellec∣tual health; and, that my friend, the tradesman above cited, is not the only sufferer from the extravagant profusion of a Thanksgiving Day.</P>
<P>All this is pointed by conviction; but my mind, fond of investigating, doth not easily yield its assent to a disputed hypothesis; and in the course of the week which contained our last annual gala, I termi∣nated a sentimental ramble, during which I had se∣riously reflected on the subject, by a visit to a valuable woman, whom I have long known; and observing, that in her accustomed manner she had distinguished the era by distributing to the necessitous, I could not forbear remarking on that benevolence which was eminently prevalent in her bosom; while, on her part, that she might effectually arrest words which were issu∣ing in a panegyric on her virtues, she immediately drew my attention to an unfortunate female, with whom she had just parted. This female was born in a rank of life generally exempted from servile depen∣dence; for he who derives his support from the real or imaginary exigencies of the opulent, admitting he is industrious and frugal, almost necessarily commands respectability; and the young Ursula was cradled in the tranquil recesses of competency; she was nourish∣ed, cultured, and reared to maturity by parental ten∣derness; and the peaceful morning of her days was protected by a father's love. But Heaven deprived her of her maternal parent, whose place was soon fill∣ed by a step-mother; and a train of those evils suc∣ceeded, which too commonly result from second mar∣riages, when children were the offspring of the first.</P>
<P>Ursula was marked the daughter of sufferance; but a short interval succeeded her father's ill judged connexion, ere she was reduced to the necessity of pro∣viding for herself; various misfortunes have attended her solitary steps; and, mortified and dispirited by the prostration of her early hopes, the disposition of
<PB N="256" REF="034162_0602_0FFC7029DD01DF70"/>
her mind hath acquired a gloomy kind of acrimony; she hath passed through life without forming a par∣ticular connexion, a prey to regret, dissatisfied with herself, and with a world to which she is so little in∣debted. She is now far advanced in years, and she is struggling with infirmities. A scirrhus, from the progress of which she at times suffers exquisite pain, is gradually poisoning the springs of life; yet she may still live long; and although her exertions to obtain the <HI>means of living</HI> have been marked with unremitted industry, she hath, notwithstanding, been frequently reduced to the last extremity. Of pecuniary inconve∣nience, however, she hath seldom been heard to com∣plain. She hath almost invariably preserved a decent kind of pride, which hath imposed upon her lips, in this respect, the seal of silence.</P>
<P>But on the day immediately preceding our last Thanksgiving, comparing, doubtless, the aspect of this returning festival to those which had formerly met her view, her fortitude forsook her; and, pale, emaciated and desponding, she sought the parlour of my philanthropic friend. The children of misfortune know where to apply; and the road to the dwelling of the beneficent matron was pointed by a thousand good actions.</P>
<P>"<HI>What shall I do, Madam?</HI>" said Ursula, as she en∣tered the apartment, <Q>I fear, alas! I fear that I must at length submit to the rigour of my fate. <HI>To-morrow will be Thanksgiving Day,</HI> and I have not enough in the world to purchase a single basket of coal!</Q> "Pray what is the price of a basket of coal?" Probably the fifth part of a dollar, more or less, ac∣cording to the caprice or mercenary disposition of the vender. <Q>Not enough to purchase you a basket of coal! Astonishing! but cheer up, Ursula, you shall spend your Thanksgiving Day with me; and I would advise you to recollect that He who commanded you into being, hath all hearts at his disposal; that he is the friend of the destitute; and that the calami∣ties to which we are subjected, are the dispensations
<PB N="257" REF="034162_0603_0FFC7033E83F7F50"/>
of paternal wisdom, of paternal love.</Q> Ursula bow∣ed in silence; she was too full to speak; but an af∣fecting kind of patient resignation seemed gradually to pervade her grief-worn countenance.</P>
<P>Just at this period, a gentleman entered the apart∣ment: He had occasionally seen Ursula, and he was a man of humanity. Ursula, afflicted, and much op∣pressed, would have modestly retired; but our philan∣thropic gentleman detained her. <Q>How are you, Ur∣sula?</Q> "Well, I thank you, Sir," returned the poor unfortunate. "You do not look well, Ursula—<HI>to-morrow will be Thanksgiving Day</HI>—I would have every heart glad <HI>on that day</HI>"—and he gave Ursula a handsome benefaction. Excellent memento! we will record this circumstance in favour of <HI>Thanksgiving Day;</HI> and, if it is found, that the custom of administering to the necessities of our fellow-mortals, is coeval with this festival, we will, without hesitation, pronounce its eu∣logy.</P>
<P>Ursula courtesied, burst into tears, and withdrew. A ray of hope once more illumined the bosom of the cheerless traveller; she was animated to new exertions, and again resuming her plans of industry, she imme∣diately sat out for the purpose of securing some work, which a fear she should not be able to accomplish, had induced her to relinquish. On her way, she looked in on a person, whom she had been regularly in the habit of assisting, for the reimbursement of a debt, incurred in order to provide herself with a small bed, on which to repose her weary limbs. Ursula possessed great rec∣titude and integrity of soul; and the reflections occasion∣ed by a recollection of engagements she might possibly never be able to fulfil, had frequently tortured her bo∣som; but she now met her creditor with an invigor∣ated prospect of being one day able to discharge the last farthing.</P>
<P>Lucinda was her creditor; she is a young and ami∣able woman; she is an orphan too, and altogether dependent on her own efforts for her support: But, while ingenuity is her handmaid, competency hovers
<PB N="258" REF="034162_0604_0FFC70267788A8D8"/>
round her; and those females, whom she so largely contributes to adorn, must experience genuine compla∣cency, while they contemplate so fair a model for those of the sex, to whom niggard fortune hath been parsimonious of her favours. Admirable young wo∣man! upon thy decent features, elegance and becom∣ing modesty sits enthroned; propriety mingles in thy train; and, while I admire thy virtues, I will daily pray, that thy love of independence may be crowned by success.</P>
<P>"Ursula," said Lucinda, <Q>you are indebted to me just fourteen shillings—to-morrow will be <HI>Thanksgiv∣ing Day</HI>—Were it in my power, I would prepare <HI>for this day,</HI> by an action which should calm every per∣turbed mind, wipe the tear from the cheek of sor∣row, and hush to peace the sigh of anguish; but, however limited my abilities, what I can, I will—From henceforth, that is, from <HI>Thanksgiving Day,</HI> you are free; and remember, that for your future work you are entitled to full and prompt payment.</Q> This was not the first time Lucinda had tasted the luxury of doing good; for never had she sent a bundle of work to Ursula, in which she did not convey a half-worn gown, cap, skirt, &amp;c. &amp;c. Yet, let me repeat, Lucinda cannot command a single penny, but what she receives as a compensation for her ingenious and persevering efforts at her needle. She is single and un∣protected—but consistent virtue still remaineth an in∣vulnerable shield! Do you wish to know what spot contains this wonderful paragon? Go then, and do homage to a little milliner, not a hundred miles from Cornhill!</P>
<P>Ursula blest her youthful benefactress, and return∣ed to communicate her good fortune to my benevolent and sympathizing friend. It seemed, upon that day, that the genius of benignity had been busily employed in favour of Ursula. By a removal, to which she had been suddenly and unexpectedly necessitated, she was lost to some well disposed persons, who had frequently assisted her; neither was her place of refuge within the
<PB N="259" REF="034162_0605_0FFC702324CB1528"/>
knowledge of those officers of the church, with whom she communicated, who had been entrusted with the distribution of benefactions, collected for the use of the indigent children of sorrow; a kind hearted man had interposed in her behalf, and her proportion of the charitable appropriation awaited her, at her hum∣ble abode.</P>
<P><HI>Thanksgiving Day</HI> arrived—it was whispered that Ursula had said she had not sufficient in the world to purchase a basket of coal—one and another, on <HI>that day,</HI> contributed more or less liberally; and a cheering ray of competency, diffusing its genial influence over the declining life of poor Ursula, her heart was made glad.</P>
<P>Thanksgiving Day is, in our country, a munificent festival. It hath, in every view, its beauty and its propriety—all orders, and every description of peo∣ple, assemble, to offer up their general acknowledg∣ments, and devout orisons to the Parent of the uni∣verse. The week, on which this jubilee is appointed, is devoted to the most benevolent purposes—to the recog∣nition of the claims of the unfortunate, to the implant∣ing, in the bosom of the orphan, the bud of hope, and to the making the <HI>widow's heart sing for joy.</HI> See the thronged streets—crowds of destitute persons assert their <HI>accustomed prerogative</HI>—they pass on to the dwell∣ings of affluence—the season, habit, and the feelings, consequent thereon, conspire to render liberality still more liberal. Every present want is supplied, gene∣rosity is constituted almoner, a face of hilarity displac∣es that anxiety, which naturally clouds the brow of suf∣fering poverty; they return to their now joyful retreats—they smile over the sudden plenty—their hearts overflow with gratitude—their spirits are attuned to praise—their dispositions are in unison with their fel∣low-citizens—they chant the song of <HI>thanksgiving</HI>—they join in grateful prostrations to the God of their life; and, the expectation of this <HI>Thanksgiving Day</HI> fre∣quently serves to mitigate the calamities, and to soften the penury, of the intervening year.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="034162_0606_0FFC70219FD52F68"/>
Let me, therefore, leaving my honest friend, the thrifty tradesman, to lament for his "<HI>running cash,</HI>" frankly acknowledge myself a confirmed advocate for THANKSGIVING DAY. May the wisdom of our legisla∣tors continue to recommend, and may our well dispos∣ed and orderly citizens cheerfully obey—may they honour this festival in their <HI>accustomed manner</HI>—may it still be distinguished as the <HI>poor man's holiday</HI>—and may it be the coeval of this Columbian world. Yes, I will own, that I am enthusiastically fond of following, as far as may consist with rectitude, the example of my ancestors. I bow with reverence, to the holidays which they have consecrated as sacred; and, above all, I am extravagantly—yea, passionately, fond of <HI>Thanksgiving Day.</HI></P>

<Q><L>Why is Patronius always in the right?</L>
<L>Is he endow'd with supernatural light?</L>
<L>Certainly not—but reason points his way,</L>
<L>And in his breast her powerful dictates sway.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great secret of deciding with accuracy, abid∣eth in the breast of deliberation; hasty conclu∣sions must ever be hazardous, and a rational man will never submit that to chance, which patient and atten∣tive investigation may reduce to certainty. I have for many years had the felicity of ranking Patronius among my intimate friends; we have lived in the most unreserved confidence; and I do not recollect a single instance, wherein he has ever been necessitated to re∣tract an opinion which had received publicity from his adoption.</P>
<P>He is never assuming; his sentiments are always advanced with modesty, and by consequence the blush of error never tinges his cheek. I am aware that this is a high panegyric, but an analytical examination of the system of Patronius, will, if I mistake not, evince
<PB N="261" REF="034162_0607_0FFC702015329ED8"/>
the practicability of a wise man, whatever may be his internal perceptions, <HI>appearing to observers</HI> always in the right.</P>
<P>It is one of the first principles of Patronius, to listen to the sentiments of those with whom he associates, before he hazards even a conjecture of his own; and as he has an aversion from controversy, he never ven∣tures upon a subject, except with a view of <HI>giving</HI> or <HI>receiving</HI> information. He is, on no occasion, the noisy disputant; he will not <HI>contradict peremptorily,</HI> nor assert <HI>dogmatically;</HI> he does not presume that a thing <HI>is, or is not,</HI> precisely as it happens on a cursory view to strike his perception. He is a close reasoner, <HI>but then he is a reasoner;</HI> his disquisitions are marked with calmness; and he would prefer remaining silently attentive during the most interesting conversation, to the uttering a single syllable in favour of an hypothesis which he conceived false and untenable. Hence, it will be concluded, that he is much more frequently a hearer than a speaker, and this, indeed, of necessity happens; yet persuasion dwells upon his lips, and his opinions are rarely ever ascertained, that they are not instantaneously adopted. His character is marked by firmness; he is known to be consistently virtuous; and his <HI>movements,</HI> rather than his <HI>language,</HI> are <HI>decisive.</HI> He is an accurate definer; and when he speaks, silence, in rapt attention, bends to hear. He proposes his subject at large; marks, with precision, its general contour; expresses those ideas suggested by an aggre∣gate view thereof; and methodically proceeds to indi∣vidual observations, from whence he deduces his com∣prehensive and self-evident conclusions.</P>
<P>Truth is the great object of his pursuit; and his research after this inestimable gem is uniformly con∣ducted with moderation. He is a pupil of the Socra∣tic school; and, by a regular series of questions put to his opponent, the invidious task of refutation is soft∣ened, and his tenets are established without involving those rancorous feelings which are too commonly the appendages of disputation. By this mild mode of
<PB N="262" REF="034162_0608_0FFC701DB47BFD48"/>
convincing, Patronius is sure never to offend. Persons are imperceptibly informed; they admire his under∣standing, without envying its brilliancy; and I have frequently seen the brow of this accomplished victor adorned by the cheerful voices and ready hands of the grateful vanquished, with the fairest laurels that ever grew in the aromatic haunts of animating praise! From interrogatory arguments, Patronius derives an obvious, advantage; he is spared the arrogance of assertion; conviction is gradually produced; and ev∣ery one is ready to join issue in opinions which become self-evident, which they have helped to elucidate, and which, with a pleasing persuasion of their authenticity, pervade the mind. Thus are the feelings of compla∣cency invigorated; prejudice imperceptibly undermin∣ed; and that pertinacious adherence to a favourite sentiment, so natural to human pride, when attacked with less judgment, skilfully divested of its imposing power. Patronius generally leaves it to his little au∣dience, to furnish with the garb of words, the conclu∣sion which he has irrefragably demonstrated; and hence, should his reasoning undesignedly have connect∣ed a latent error, he is spared those unpleasant sensa∣tions which would have attended the necessity of yield∣ing his hypothesis, had he proposed or defended it with obstinacy: Thus he is a stranger to the <HI>culpability</HI> of error; and my eulogium is, <HI>strictly speaking,</HI> a sober fact—its <HI>conscious blushes never ting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his cheek.</HI> I grant that Patronius has been rarely equalled; and that he is placed in our world, a luminary of the first magni∣tude; and yet, I humbly conceive, I may propose him as a model for imitation; for although we may never reach the summit he hath attained, emulation may nevertheless produce its effect; and every advance we make toward the point of rectitude, will be honourable to ourselves, and beneficial to society.</P>
<P>Patronius has the felicity to combine those qualities which have been supposed heterogeneous; and, while his movements are the result of cool deliberation and noble firmness; while his conduct is under the guid∣ance
<PB N="263" REF="034162_0609_0FFC701A55329AF0"/>
of prudence and propriety, the fervour and con∣stancy of his regards amount to the enchanting and amiable enthusiasm, inseparable from sublime and ho∣ly friendship. Patronius evinceth that a strong and well regulated mind is susceptible of <HI>every excellence;</HI> and his actions may, in the same moment, be consid∣ered as the spontaneous growth of nature, and the re∣sult of educated wisdom—they are rich and abundant∣ly productive; they are luxuriant as the wild and in∣discriminating impulses of unsystematized liberality: But a <HI>nice</HI> investigator will observe them carefully pruned by reason, and circumscribed by the inclosure of discreet munificence.</P>
<P>I do homage to the active mind of Patronius. In∣tellect, it is said, will always command respect; and, from full conviction, I receive this sentiment into my <HI>treasury</HI> of <HI>incontrovertible facts.</HI> Will a weight of years destroy the energy of talents so conspicuously em∣inent? If it will, we could almost breathe a wish to arrest the progress of time; and with a little variation we apply and devoutly aspirate the Homeric petition in favour of Nestor; "What now thou art, Oh! ever mayst thou be; and age the lot of any sage but thee." But the uniform temperance of Patronius, will entitle him to an old age of health; while his mind will continue cheerful and active, pursuing un∣interruptedly a course of usefulness to the latest period of his mortal existence; thus finishing his career with those meliorated splendors that in the morning of his days shining with strong effulgence, emitted the fairest hopes of meridian excellence. While he lives he will possess the applause of his fellow men; and posterity will learn to venerate his memory.</P>
<P>"The applause of his fellow men!" cries Apathy; "And pray, good Mr. Gleaner, of what use will this be to Patronius? Please to inform us to what the ap∣plause of his fellow men will amount? Fame is a wind blown vagabond; she delighteth not in durable habi∣tations. <HI>Virtue, in the person of WASHINGTON, hath en∣deavoured to render her stationary;</HI> but the flood of light
<PB N="264" REF="034162_0610_0FFC7017D7D6BCC8"/>
with which she hath encompassed the hero, hath at length become insufferable; it hath struck blind a number of well meaning individuals; and it hath so far excited the rancour of the screech-owls of our day, that, if the guardian chief should not suddenly escape to his native skies, it will be wonderful if they do not for the time being; envelop him in that dense atmos∣phere which circumscribes their own ideas; it will be astonishing, if, encircling him by the murky clouds of envy, they do not despoil him of the vagrant fame. Yet, lured by the charms of a conduct irreproachable, should fame continue to enwreath <HI>the honoured brows of Washington,</HI> as worth so rare is seldom the growth of mortality, pretensions more equivocal must submit to the veil of obscurity, or consent to become the sport of alternate censure and applause. Praise is an airy com∣modity; a breath bestows it, and a breath retracts; it soothes for a moment, but it soon evaporates; it ener∣vates the mind, insinuating a persuasion, that, having reached the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of intellectual attainments, every future effort is superfluous, and it renders us im∣patient under the most gentle and necessary reproofs. For my part, although I may admire your Patronius, I nevertheless throw my gauntlet, and positively as∣sert the inutility of every species of commendation; being fully able to prove its inability to confer happi∣ness, and its inefficacy on the morals of mankind. He who expects his peace from the eulogizing voice of fame, is making his couch on the pointed thorns of ca∣price—is building a superstructure on the fluctuating waves of opinion, than which nothing is more futile and unstable. I trust not then the treachery of senti∣ment, the bubble fame is not an object of my pursuit; and I am regardless of the opinion of the world."</P>
<P>Stop, stop, Mr. Apathy—attend a moment, if you please. The world is a vast, an ample theatre, and its inhabitants are an audience to each other—we are alternately actors and spectators; and, if we hold in contempt the opinion of those who are assembled as our judges, the probability is, we shall soon view with
<PB N="265" REF="034162_0611_0FFC701650199118"/>
indifference those virtues, the attainment and practice of which, is the purchase of their esteem; and it is to be feared we shall ultimately become unworthy of the good we have learned to despise. I should trem∣ble for a son or daughter who regarded with indiffer∣ence the sacred interests of reputation. To what pur∣pose are we diligently employed in embellishing our persons, or in polishing our manners? these adventi∣tious graces make no <HI>essential</HI> part of inborn integrity, or of a solid understanding; yet, they are pleasing ex∣teriors, which render us acceptable to those with whom we associate. But, was there no individual whom we wished to impress—was there no heart, on whose fair tablets we were anxious to stamp ideas of our merit, these external ornaments would, perhaps, be but little studied; nay, in defiance of custom itself, the probabili∣ty is, they would gradually be totally laid aside.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Sir, I say again, I regard not the opinion of the world; my period of emancipation has arrived, and I, at length, feel myself superior to its censures or its applauses.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Alas! alas! Mr. Apathy, you have then lost an admirable incentive to consistent rectitude, and you have but one step further to go—you have only to throw off those feelings of restraint, which have hith∣erto influenced you, in regard to that all-pervading Being, who created the world and those intelligencies whom you now so heroically despise—you have only to leap this barrier, and you rank with the four-footed tenants of the soil! your fears and your expectations are, like theirs, bounded by the gratification of the mo∣ment. To the duration of communicable good, you are a stranger; for you cannot participate the enjoy∣ments of those, whom you contemplate with such un∣feigned and systematic contempt.</P>
<P>But, as I would hope this globe, in its extensive round, contains not the human being, who is, in his heart, at all times, and upon every occasion, an unwa∣vering Atheist; so I pleasingly believe, that there exists not a rationally intelligent man, or woman, who is not
<PB N="266" REF="034162_0612_0FFC701231AED770"/>
ambitious of that fair fame, which is, sooner or later, the accompaniment of virtuous deeds.</P>
<P>The Gleaner, solicitous to cultivate the good and amiable qualities of his readers, would endow them with that delicacy which trembles at the voice of ac∣cusation, and which, enwrapping itself in the mantle of propriety, is sedulously careful to avoid even the shadow of suspicion. He would endow them with that kind of sensibility, or exquisite perception, which should produce them primarily desirous of rendering themselves well pleasing to Deity; and, thus insuring the approbation of their own hearts, he would next implant the ardent wish to conciliate the esteem, affec∣tion, and judiciously distinguishing applause of wor∣thy persons of every description; nor could he, it is humbly conceived, present his friends, the younger part of them particularly, with a more powerful stim∣ulus to, or truly efficacious talisman of, CONSISTENT VIRTUE.</P>

<P>AS there is no idea, by which I am so exquisitely tortured, as that of annihilation, I naturally turn, with disgust and horror, from the reasonings of him, who, laying impious hands on that principle of
<PB N="267" REF="034162_0613_0FFC700FE5D783E8"/>
animation which originates in Deity, would confound it with the common mass of matter; and who, with grub like industry, having enveloped himself in his earthy cone, entertains as little expectation of breaking his sepulchral enclosure, as the reptile who thus me∣chanically encrusts itself.</P>
<P>"Mamma," said my little grand-daughter to Mar∣garetta, "Mamma, where do butterflies go?" I re∣peat, that a child may ask a question which would puzzle a Sir Isaac Newton to resolve. But although neither the wise nor the untaught may be able to des∣cant <HI>learnedly</HI> on the destination of butterflies, yet do we take inexpressible pleasure in tracing their various and surprising transmutations, and in dwelling with eager attention on their eventful career, until, borne on the gentle zephyr, they become tenants of the aërial world.</P>
<P>May not the butterfly be considered as a humble figure of the creature Man? In its reptile state it seems fastened to the earth; it is indefatigable in its attempts to obtain that subsistence it will need but a little while. At length it is evidently on the decay; it sets about preparing for its departure; it makes ready the filaments in which it enwrappeth itself; it enfolds and contracts them; gradually they become a sepulchral crust, in which securely enveloped, the de∣ceased insect <HI>apparently bids a final adieu</HI> to the busy scenes in which it hath taken so laborious a part. But mark the astonishing change: These habiliments of death are thrown off—the hideously disgusting form is no more—its newly acquired wings are expanded—they assume a variety of hues, and look as if designed in the gayest moments of a fertile and brilliant imag∣ination. Hardly will the little flutterer deign to rest on the bosom of that earth, to which it formerly so closely adhered; and, perched on some beauteously fragrant flower, and indulging in all the rich variety of ambrosial food, it sips the embosomed sweets. With what astonishing celerity its movements are per∣formed—lightly it pursues its elevated path, and we
<PB N="268" REF="034162_0614_0FFC700E5E637310"/>
gaze with admiration upon its wonderful improve∣ments. Was not the whole process submitted to our observation, we should call in question its reality; and cold philosophy would teach us, first, to reason—second∣ly, to doubt—and, finally, to embrace the creed of infi∣delity.</P>
<P>Man, in his present state of being, moves heavily on this opaque globe—he is principally solicitous, respect∣ing matters which appertain wholly to this life—he is often anxiously oppressed, while every accession to that property he is carefully seeking to augment, does but increase his burdens. But whatever impediments may seem to bar his way, he, however, advances on∣ward—he attains the period when his quick sense of earth-born joys is no more—he verges on the days on which he can say he hath no pleasure—for a little mo∣ment he abides, and his open grave is prepared—he is inclosed in the narrow house, and the green turf clothes, with undistinguishing verdure, the hallowed spot where he reposes. Do we say that we have bid him an eternal adieu? we do not speak correctly; for, in the morning of the resurrection, he shall burst the bar∣riers of the grave—he shall issue from the chambers of the tomb. Behold how mortality hath put on immor∣tality—he is beautiful as the inhabitants of the celes∣tial world—he hath become as a winged seraph—he mounts, he soars on high—he pursues his trackless way—he attains the heaven of heavens, and he min∣gles with the angels who surround the throne of Deity.</P>
<P>Is my figure exceptionable?—I shall not contend—I did not expect it would answer in all its parts. I think, however, some of its features will be acknowl∣edged striking; and I could as easily, had I not ocu∣lar demonstration, believe the resurrection of the body, inclosed in yonder tomb, as I could lend my credence to the egg, the worm, the cone, the aurelia, and the butterfly.</P>
<P>Yet, I do not vehemently insist on the resuscitation of this time-worn tenement. In the bloom of youth, and vigour of my days, my reluctance to a final sepa∣ration
<PB N="269" REF="034162_0615_0FFC700C318980D8"/>
from organs so incomparably well adapted to my exigencies, was extreme; but a length of years have revolved—the fine machine is going to decay—I begin to detect its inconveniences—it is a heavy clog upon my purposes—and, when I am bounding for∣ward with all the celerity of thought, I am retarded and pulled back by its unwieldy properties. I natur∣ally wish for a vehicle more agile; and imagination, darting into futurity, anticipates accommodations more consonant with my wishes. Hardly a day passes, in which I do not discover, in my present residence, new instances to prove that the building is greatly im∣paired; nor is this a circumstance of regret. My glass informs me, that time hath furrowed my face; that my eyes no longer sparkle with the vivacity of youth; that the glossy ornaments of my head are rap∣idly giving place; that my form is bent; that I hob∣ble in my gait, &amp;c. &amp;c. No matter—my attachment to this earthly residence is also on the decline, and I will support, with fortitude, the sufferings which may be necessary to its dissolution. Whether my all-wise and omnific Father will raise it again on a nobler principle, is a question that cannot greatly agitate my mind, since I know that his paternal goodness will or∣dain for me, precisely that habitation, which shall be the best calculated for the full enjoyment of all my faculties. If I—if my best self can escape from this wreck of nature, I am then sure to be as "<HI>blest as I can hear;</HI>" and, the <HI>superiority</HI> and <HI>inferred durability</HI> of spirit, is beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>"Certainly not," cries the opposer, <Q><HI>for the mental</HI> faculties decay with the corporeal; <HI>thus evincing the truth of the hypothesis, which describes them as both per∣ishing together.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But against such a comfortless and derogatory sen∣timent I enter my protest. The immortal principle of life, retaining, <HI>in this debilitated body,</HI> its pristine vig∣our, glows indignant at the humiliating idea; and, notwithstanding the <HI>decaying organs by which it operates,</HI> it still asserts its own inherent fervours. <HI>Age</HI> cannot,
<PB N="270" REF="034162_0616_0FFC6FBB54BDEFC0"/>
in <HI>reality,</HI> curtail the inborn powers of the soul; their elasticity, for want of use, may be abridged, but their <HI>native energies</HI> can never depreciate. From the mo∣ment in which the immortal mind becomes a sojourner in mortality, certain organs, by which it is to operate, are assigned to the celestial resident, and these organs become the medium of its manifestations. In infancy the mental faculties are under a necessity of awaiting the acquirements of that progressing machine, in which they are enveloped; and the reason is obvious; the most skilful artist must be furnished with instruments proper to his occupation. In the vigour of manhood the soul still finds many a laudable wish ungratified—its habitation is not in every respect accommodated to its views—it would move with all the rapidity of mo∣tion—it would take the wings of the morning, and compass the globe in a day—it would design and exe∣cute in one and the same moment—and the restless anxiety it experienceth is a presumptive proof, that it is appointed to a higher and more perfect state. Old age arrives—and the <HI>bodily organs, ordained for dissolution, experienceth the imbecility that marked the state of child∣hood</HI>—the imprisoned spirit assays to quicken the slug∣gish stream—it endeavours to rouse the torpid pulse—it would render flexile the stiffening sinews—with tremulous anxiety it searches every compartment, throws its inquiring glance through each avenue, and would act upon the complicated machine as in those days when it appeared so much under its command—but it will not be—and it is in vain to struggle against a statute which hath passed the great seal of Heaven. The retiring immortal at length becomes conscious that it is on the eve of its departure; it collects its scattered faculties, and, submitting to that state which bears a strong resemblance to inactivity, and which is imposed by necessity, it awaits, with more or less resig∣nation, the approaching moment of its final emanci∣pation. But shall we for this expatiate on its dimin∣ished lustre, strip it of its immortality, prepare its fu∣neral dirge, and consign it to the gulph of oblivion?
<PB N="271" REF="034162_0617_0FFC7009DE2EAF40"/>
Strange perversion of ideas! most illogical conclusion! and truly unworthy sacrifice of all those commanding incentives to virtue and splendid hopes, that originate in an expectation of future existence.</P>
<P>That it is highly irrational to characterize the im∣mortal mind, from the <HI>demonstration</HI> it maketh of its faculties by the medium of <HI>decaying bodily organs,</HI> is apparent from a variety of considerations. An illus∣trative figure this moment presents. I take my seat in the midst of a respectable company—a musician is introduced—I have heard much of this performer—he is very eminent, understands every branch of music, is unequalled in the line of his profession, and particu∣larly excels upon the piano-forte—the instrument is opened, and he commences his efforts with a favourite piece of music. But what a futile attempt!—sounds the most discordant issue from the piano—not a single note is in unison—the flats and sharps are confounded—he is out of time—<HI>a child, practising his lesson,</HI> would have produced better tones. O horrid! I exclaim; surely, the artist is either grossly deficient, or he has <HI>lost those exquisite powers of execution, for which he has been so highly celebrated; his faculties, probably, are on the decay.</HI></P>
<P>"Mistaken man," replies the master of the house, "your conjecture is erroneous; nothing can be fur∣ther from the truth. <HI>The instrument, my good Sir, is out of tune; nay, more, an accident hath despoiled it of its principal keys; the complicated machinery is obstructed in its most capital parts; in short, it is worn out by time, disastrous removals, and unskilful usage.</HI>" Ought I not to feel conscious of my injurious estimation of the mu∣sician? Does not the circumstance of the <HI>decayed in∣strument</HI> restore my high raised ideas of <HI>his abilities?</HI> and will it not be proper, that I henceforward render him the homage which must ever be due to superior acquirements?</P>
<P>I confess, I take a superior pleasure in tracing, im∣proving and cherishing, every idea which establishes the <HI>pre-eminence, independence</HI> and <HI>immortality of the mind;</HI> and, in the multifarious reflections I have anxiously
<PB N="272" REF="034162_0618_0FFC700783FF2D98"/>
made on this subject, I have derived much consolation, from recurring to the surprising activity the spirit of∣ten evinces, when the bodily organs are fast locked in the embraces of the <HI>image</HI> of <HI>death.</HI> I have thought, that the action of the spirit is in no moment <HI>entirely suspended;</HI> and although I have passed many nights without a <HI>consciousness</HI> of having dreamed, yet it does not therefore follow, that the mental faculties have been unemployed. The most pleasing visions have sometimes gathered round my sleeping hours; meth∣od and propriety have been in full exercise; but when the re-action of the corporeal organs has re-called the vagrant spirit, only disjointed images have remain∣ed, and it has been beyond my power to recover a sin∣gle connected idea. Again, I have only been able to recollect that I <HI>have dreamed,</HI> without the vestige of an impression, by which I could trace the nature of the vision. From these facts I gather, that I may dream without being at all conscious, after the shadows of the night have fled, that my mind has been thus occu∣pied. It appears to me of consequence, to establish the <HI>constant activity</HI> of the soul; for, if it can, for a single moment, be divested of its consciousness and the appendages of animation; if it can <HI>slumber with the body,</HI> it may slumber for ages, it may lose its identity, it may sink into oblivion; and we are, by consequence, conducted to the comfortless verge of materialism! But having expressed myself freely on this subject in an Essay, which may in future be submitted to the public eye, I wave it for the present.</P>
<P>I know that dreams are whimsical, perplexing and fallacious; yet we do not always understand their ori∣gin or tendency; and, I conceive, there may be anal∣ogies in nature, of which we are entirely ignorant. One thing appears to me certain, that dreams furnish no inconsiderable evidence of that <HI>pre-eminence, inde∣pendence</HI> and <HI>immortality,</HI> which I am solicitous to con∣firm. A person far advanced in years, and entering on the winter of life, every day accumulates infirmi∣ties. Suffering under a severe paroxysm of the gout,
<PB N="273" REF="034162_0619_0FFC70054230D250"/>
after a succession of hours marked by anguish, nature, quite exhausted, forgets itself in the arms of sleep; to the couch of misery the pain-worn body is still con∣fined; but the gladdened spirit, as if felicitating it∣self on its momentary exemption, indulges the full ca∣reer of fancy. The scene is instantly changed—a sur∣prising revolution succeeds—youth again blooms on the cheek—the nerves are new strung—the sinews re∣sume their wonted agility—the blood flows briskly through the veins—health braces the frame—hope glows in the bosom—the heart leaps for joy—all is enchantment, the enchantment of the morning of life—he contemplates the tenderest attachment—he forms new connexions—he becomes impassioned—and he feels over again the ardours of youth. But alas! the fleeting vision is on the wing—a creaking door—an impertinent footstep—the charm is broken—and the mind is again embodied by age, infirmity, and conse∣quent suffering. Yet, I ask, has it not thus produced a proof of its <HI>pre-eminence</HI> and <HI>independence;</HI> and may not its <HI>immortality</HI> be fairly inferred?</P>
<P>But it is said, that we vainly deduce a proof of the immortality of the soul from dreams, since there are existing many strong reasons to suppose, that dogs and several other animals dream. And let them dream—they have my cheerful permission; nor have I any objection to those <HI>faithful creatures bearing me company in my native sky.</HI> I should be charmed with a treatise which should prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the future and immortal existence of every animated being. I should be right happy to witness the era predicted by the prophet Isaiah, who tells us, that the lion and the lamb shall lie down together; and should they be led by the hand of blooming innocence, the scene would be still more highly wrought. In one word, could I answer my little Margaretta's question, "<HI>Where do butterflies go?</HI>" it would become to me a new source of pleasure.</P>

<P>PERHAPS there is no individual, who is impress∣ed with a higher idea of the advantages resulting from extensive literature, than myself. I cheerfully do homage to science; a conviction of its excellence necessitates me to place it among the first of blessings; and I would enjoin persons of all descriptions to seize with avidity every opportunity of accumulating knowl∣edge. He who has neglected to store his mind with ideas, to invigorate the intellectual powers, and to habituate himself to reasoning, comparing, investigat∣ing, and concluding, hath not only forgotten to con∣stitute a fund on which he might occasionally draw, but hath also defrauded society of that assistance which mankind had a right to reckon on from his abilities; and thus committed a crime against his species, for which, alas! it is beyond his power to atone.</P>
<P>But while I deliberately render all possible respect to those acquirements, so indispensably requisite to him who would run with honour the career of life, I can∣not forbear confessing my <HI>superior admiration</HI> of those fortuitous candidates for applause, who, in a great measure unassisted by the schools, have reached the highest eminence to which a human being can aspire; nor does this diminish the odium so justly affixed up∣on him, who, inattentive to the means of information with which he has been furnished, produces himself upon the world an unlettered blank, waiting the cas∣ual impressions of every interested compositor, whom chance may direct to fill up the vacant pages.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="034162_0621_0FFC6FFFE879B1C0"/>
But circumstances may have combined to deny the means of instruction; and the proprietor of genius may pass those years when he should have been entered and continued the pupil of science, without receiving those adventitious aids, which, with lapidarian influence, would have given to acknowledged merit the most brilliant polish; and if under a predicament unques∣tionably disadvantageous, he attains to eminence, if although unfashioned by the cultivating hand of a preceptor, he bursts through those intercepting clouds in which a variety of unpropitious arrangements had enveloped the morning of his days, and, rich in native resources, blazes forth in meridian lustre, we surely can∣not hesitate to subscribe to the justice of that decision, which, eternizing his name, invests him with immor∣tality. It is true he will not combine the learning of a Johnson; his diction may be neither elegant nor correct; he will be in the situation of a man who has to shape his materials, as well as to construct his pile of building; but he may strike out some bold originalities, his superstructure may possibly create a new order in literature, and he may form very just pretensions to rank with those venerable ancients who have, through a long succession of ages, possessed the admiration of mankind. Grammaticaster may un∣doubtedly convict him of a false use of nouns and pro∣nouns, of confounding modes, tenses, verbs and ad∣verbs, and of the heinous crime of mistaking a colon for a full stop; but the judicious critic will not ex∣pect to find the child of nature miraculously impressed with an accurate knowledge of the refinements of dic∣tion, nor intuitively familiar with those rules which originated in convenience, and are the production of the combining efforts and continued improvements of succeeding centuries. The candid investigator will be occupied, while perusing the compositions of unculti∣vated abilities, in searching for those natural beauties that are the offspring of genius; these he will point out to public view, while he will take a sublime pleas∣ure in <HI>imagining</HI> the summit his author would have at∣tained, had he been assisted by education.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="034162_0622_0FFC6FFCDD307D08"/>
Had Grammaticaster lived in the days of Shake∣spear, he would undoubtedly have attacked, with true Zoiluan rancour, the splendid Bard of Nature. The <HI>two Witches solus,</HI> which Shakespear is said to have introduced, would have excited his most splenetic indignation; and he would have sought out, with in∣defatigable avidity and wonderful ingenuity, those bagatelle, denominated defects, thence <HI>decisively</HI> pro∣nouncing the divine poet of Avon wholly destitute of merit of every description. Poor Grammaticaster, how his soul is wrung by envy! See where, with fiend-like aspect, he hovers over the flowery haunts of genius; malignantly industrious, he is busy in collect∣ing the deforming weeds, which, amid a garden so richly furnished, have perchance sprung up; these, with invidious cunning, he combines; he eyes them with all a murderer's savage exultation; <Q><HI>he grins over them a ghastly smile;</HI></Q> and, after passing them through his pericranium, he produces them from the magic process as high crimes in the court of lit∣erature!</P>
<P>The conduct of the admirer of Shakesperian worth, or, in other words, of him who is capable of viewing with a steady eye the luminous path of genius, is the reverse of this. He traces the embodied prodigy to his morn of life; he beholds him the son of care; im∣perious circumstances deny his continuance even at a free school; he is accustomed to the most rigid econ∣omy, and he is initiated into all the penury of traffic; he is early bound by the ties of matrimony, and to a life of labour he is apparently destined. An accident, however, of a dark and unwarrantable hue, appears to be the procuring cause which unexpectedly engages him in the most arduous pursuits; and these preced∣ing facts will augment the astonishment and admira∣tion of all those who candidly reflect upon his subse∣quent achievements, and upon the unequalled elevation to which he soared; they will operate as a sponge, which will, <HI>in effect,</HI> erase from his pages all those pec∣cadillos, that in an author receiving a regular educa∣tion
<PB N="277" REF="034162_0623_0FFC6FFB5484C6F0"/>
would have been unpardonable. Far from im∣peding his eagle flight, they seem to point more forci∣bly his inimitable attainments; they are foils, which like spots in the sun, strikingly contrast his original lustre, and irresistibly enforce the vigour of an under∣standing, that hath proved a rich and inexhaustible source, from which many a lesser light has borrowed its effulgence.</P>
<P>Miss Hannah Moore, (the celebrity of whose char∣acter might almost sanction error) writing to Mrs. Montague in favour of the milk woman of Clifton, and speaking of Shakespear, elegantly embodies those ideas which I am solicitous to enrobe. But Voltaire characterizes this prodigious and incomparable genius, as a <HI>barbarous poet!</HI> Milton also is ranked in the same class by this <HI>civilized writer!</HI> yet it will not be within the compass even of a Voltaire, to diminish those splendours necessarily attached to luminaries of the first magnitude in the literary hemisphere.</P>
<P>As the satellite of Miss Moore, the milk woman must still be considered; and, if it is true that an adverse cloud hath for a time intercepted the beneficent rays of that resplendent orb, preventing the continuance of their genial influence on the humble daughter of ge∣nius, the innate refulgence of an intellect, both elevat∣ed and informed, will undoubtedly consume every opaque impediment which hath officiously obtruded; and she will once more receive to favour the gentle female whom she hath presented to observation, and whom she so kindly sheltered.</P>
<P>Woodhouse, the Crispian bard, extorts our pity and our admiration: Like the milk woman, common read∣ing and writing comprized the whole of his educa∣tion; and, from an application to even these useful branches of study, he was taken when he was only sev∣en years of age. Perhaps Miss Moore's account of Mrs. Yearsley, might be strictly applied to Woodhouse; but, be this as it may, he was, however, bred a shoe∣maker, at which business, he was no more than a journeyman, and condemned to labour with indefati∣gable
<PB N="278" REF="034162_0624_0FFC6FF9CFD47D80"/>
industry, for the support of a beloved wife, and an infant progeny. We cannot but venerate both his genius and application; while we view him seated at his depressing employ, the pen and ink are at his el∣bow; he arrests the couplets as they present, and, penning them down for future revision, he again pur∣sues the duties of his occupation. Of his thirst for knowledge, we receive a very high idea, when we contemplate him after a day passed in earning the scanty pittance adjudged the price of his labour, ap∣propriating those hours usually devoted to the restora∣tive slumbers of the night, to the obtaining that intel∣lectual food, fortunately so amply supplied by books, with which the indulgence of his patron at length furnished him; and we yield him our full commisera∣tion, when we hear him in his poem, entitled Spring, pensively complain, not indeed so much for himself, as for the beauteous fair one whose fate was entwined with his. The circumstances and scanty advantages of the poet, induces us to allow to his lays their <HI>full merit; and the invidious attempt to point out a blemish,</HI> would seem to connect a degree of criminality. Thus thought the elegant bard of the Leasowes, when, with the utmost tenderness, and a benevolence truly charac∣teristic, he commended, sanctioned and patronized; while his dignified condescension was only equalled by the gratitude of Crispin, who was ambitious of elevating almost every poetical essay, by the admired name of Shenstone.</P>
<P>Imagination, when tracing the progress of genius, unassisted by education, necessarily stops to drop a tear of regret over the misfortunes, and to render the tribute of applause, indisputably due to the merit and sublime genius of Chatterton. Uncommon youth! with what facility did he arrest and annex whatever could enrich and embellish; and how wonderful was the progress of this untutored bard! Excellent young man! de∣frauded, whilst thou sojourned among mortals, of whatever could soothe, invigorate, or sustain; thy ex∣istence became the forfeit! and nought, alas! remains
<PB N="279" REF="034162_0625_0FFC6FF5F40D60E0"/>
for posterity, but to raise a monument to thy memory, which shall endure as long as the smallest vestige of intellectual worth shall continue.</P>
<P>But the efforts of genius, unassisted by education, are alike entitled to superior panegyric, whatever track it may pursue. To the natural powers of a Brindley, the celebrated projector of navigable canals we do reverence; and, while we envy the felicity of the Duke of Bridgewater, who first called into action talents, so inherently energetic, we unhesitatingly confess that the total ignorance of art which Mr. Brindley evinced, while submitting to the investigating interrogations of the House of Commons, renders still more conspicuous the magnitude of his understanding.</P>
<P>The contemplation of the powers of nature, is, undoubtedly, a delightful employ: <HI>Native</HI> talent in∣vests with <HI>independent</HI> lustre; and every instance of <HI>unaided excellence,</HI> stamps an idea of the <HI>inherent value of intellect.</HI> Mankind are proportionably dignified, as the <HI>inborn worth</HI> of that celestial emanation, which animates them to action, is acknowledged and established; and, impressed with this sentiment, I am free to own, that I trace with singular satisfaction, the brilliant efforts of untaught abilities, warmed to admiration and stim∣ulated to exertion by the unborrowed rays which they emit; I love to bask beneath the genial beam; and I hoard, with all a miser's industry, the golden treasure.</P>
<P>KULIBIA, a Russian peasant, commemorated in Cox's travels, is a rich instance of the wonderful powers of nature; he will ever be grouped with examples of ex∣traordinary genius; and the bridge, thrown over the river Neva, which he projected, with many other achievements of his <HI>untutored</HI> abilities, will continue to bear testimony to the sublimity of his intellect.</P>
<P>The consideration of neglected education hath been the ground, on which the superstructure of female abil∣ities hath been reared; it hath invested women of elevated understanding with an indisputable claim to <HI>superior</HI> estimation; for when successfully struggling with those discouragements which are peculiarly sexual;
<PB N="280" REF="034162_0626_0FFC6FF46EDBB658"/>
depressed by a situation necessarily humiliating; and checked by the invidious sneer of the supercilious and pedantic critic; when, in defiance of every impediment, with talents almost wholly uncultivated, they boldly seize the palm of merit, we are unavoidably compelled to yield them that respectful veneration <HI>due only to mind,</HI> and which intellectual excellence must ever extort. But the apology for female deficiencies, furnished by want of education, will not, in future, be acknowledged as valid; the partial distribution of advantages which has too long obtained, is, in this enlightened age, rapidly giving place to a more uniform system of information; and the frequently contested question, respecting the intellectual pretensions of the sexes, may one day be discussed on fair and equal ground.</P>
<P>In the family of Alexy Michaelovitch, Czar of Russia, a striking instance is recorded where superiority of understanding shone forth with decided brilliancy in the female line. Feodor and Ivan, sons of the Czar, evinced in every particular a marked inferiority of intellect, while their sister, the Princess Sophia, was endowed by nature with all those shining talents, and that solidity of understanding in which her brothers were so remarkably deficient. Eminently qualified for her high station; although a woman of uncommon beauty of person, she combined therewith first rate abilities. She possessed an extraordinary knowledge in the theory of government; and she knew how to reduce to practice its true spirit. Of persons of genius and learning she was the avowed and liberal patroness; and the introduction of polite literature into Europe, was encouraged and sanctioned by her example. At an era when the lowest species of composition both assumed and disgraced the name of morality, this elegant princess occupied her leisure hours in transla∣ting the Medicin Malgrelui of Moliere. She also composed a tragedy, supposed to be the first extant in the Russian language; and a circumstance which adds essentially to the merit of this essay, is, that it was
<PB N="281" REF="034162_0627_0FFC6FF20C775478"/>
the production of a period when the most dangerous intrigues were excited and fomented against her ad∣ministration; when the spirit of rebellion was abroad; and, when, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consequence, every faculty of her mind seemed totally engrossed by the most momentous affairs.</P>

<P>IF all those persons, who are ambitious of taking rank in what is called the first grade of society, would be careful to adopt those manners which are descriptive of the <HI>real</HI> gentleman, of the <HI>real</HI> lady, if they would be solicitous to attain those virtues inhe∣rent in the bosom of the truly noble, we should not so often be called to observe the indignant blush pervad∣ing the cheek of modesty, we should not so frequently lament depressed worth, nor witness the meritorious claims of the truly deserving crushed by the overbear∣ing arrogance of those, whose only pretensions to dis∣tinction are grounded upon opulence.</P>
<P>A sensation of painful and insurmountable disgust has sometimes arrested my perception, when I have made one in the drawing-room of an imperious wom∣an, whose awkward efforts to assume that dignity which is never annexed to affectation, have rendered her truly ridiculous. The approach of timid excel∣lence is announced; it enters in the person of a fe∣male, whose unassuming manners and retiring sweet∣ness instantly call up to recollection Mary Woolston∣craft's beautiful apostrophe to modesty. She is adorn∣ed with all the graces which designate the milder vir∣tues; she might be considered as originating the par∣agraph
<PB N="282" REF="034162_0628_0FFC6FF06E586CF8"/>
adverted to; and at her appearance the most prepossessing sensations rush upon the mind. The la∣dy of the drawing room advances a few steps, then recedes back, <HI>stands erect, courtesies formally, looks for∣bidding, and assumes, as she supposes, airs of importance;</HI> while, in the estimation of reason, she is only giving an exhibition of <HI>insufferable haughtiness.</HI> In the mean time, the lovely maiden (perhaps in some way a de∣pendant) is abashed at a reception so little correspond∣ent with her wishes. Of her want of consequence, and the invidious triumph of the lady, there are many witnesses; she is covered with blushes; she seems to shrink into herself; confused and discomposed, she hastens to a seat; and, divested of that innate compla∣cency which true politeness is solicitous to cherish, she listens in silence during the continuance of her ill-fated visit, to a redundance of nonsense, dissertations on fashion, and refinements on scandal.</P>
<P>True politeness is but another name for benevo∣lence. It is studious to contribute to the ease and happiness of those with whom it is connected—it de∣lighteth to give consequence to timid worth—it seek∣eth to elevate the humble mind, and it disdaineth to affect ignorance of those characters and persons whose claim to attention is indubitable, and <HI>whom it hesitates not to caress in its private parties.</HI> Nature, when she produces her offspring, invests them with <HI>equal claims;</HI> and <HI>death</HI> reduces them to one <HI>common level</HI>—but vari∣ous are the paths which intersect the passage from the cradle to the grave: Subordination is undoubtedly necessary to the well-being of society; and, without seeking to sap the foundation of institutions which in∣volve the public weal, we only contend for that affa∣bility which is proper to every condition, and well calculated to ameliorate those mortifying circum∣stances attached to humble life.</P>
<P>The celebrated Mrs. Wright, introduced by her un∣common talents to a personal knowledge of the nobil∣ity and gentry of the kingdom of England, had, dur∣ing her residence in that country, an opportunity of
<PB N="283" REF="034162_0629_0FFC6FECF92D0238"/>
making many characteristic observations; and, in one of her letters, she humorously contrasts the manners of the woman well educated, and possessing habitual and <HI>real superiority,</HI> with those of a female, conducted by a variety of fortuitous events to move in a sphere for which neither her natural nor acquired abilities had qualified her. Mrs. Wright devoted a fine winter morning to calling <HI>en passent</HI> on several of her patrons; and among the number of those whom she attended, and who were ambitious of obtaining celebrity, by in∣serting in their list of acquaintance the votaries of ge∣nius, was the lady of a baronet, who had been raised from obscurity, to <HI>all</HI> the privileges annexed to rank and title.</P>
<P>In the superb mansion of this <HI>chance created lady,</HI> Mrs. Wright, after sending up her name, was reduced to the necessity of waiting a tedious interval; and, al∣though the chilly blasts of December were abroad, no genial blaze decorated, by its cheering flame, the gloomy chimney! It is true the elegant apartment, in which she waited the convenience of <HI>the lady,</HI> was or∣mented in high taste; but this circumstance did not possess a sufficient interest in the bosom of Mrs. Wright to charm her sense of suffering; and she regarded the summons, which admitted her to the presence of the proprietress of the mansion, as an emancipation from a very unpleasant situation. The reception she obtain∣ed, was, however, not more to her taste. <HI>The lady</HI> as∣sumed the most petrifying airs of superiority; and both her language and her manner were cold as the icy breath of the northern tempest: But Mrs. Wright, having the address to curtail her visit, hurried away to lady N—, at whose toilette, <HI>san ceremonie,</HI> she was immediately admitted, and instantly engaged in that pleasing interchange of civilities, which so frequently marks a female <HI>tete-a-tete.</HI> Lady N—chatted fa∣miliarly; soothed the self complacency of our Ameri∣can adventurer, by eulogizing the art in which she con∣templated future eminence; and, after completing the labours of the toilette, agreeably to a previous appoint∣ment,
<PB N="284" REF="034162_0630_0FFC6FE9E14DC1C0"/>
accompanied her to the royal presence; and the benign condescension of the British queen, was evinced by still higher demonstrations of affability, than those which had graced the manners of lady N—.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wright, penetrated with the most lively grati∣tude, set no bounds to her joy or her admiration; and, after narrating the particulars of this interview, she observed, that in exact ratio as she approached the lib∣eral and splendid source of genuine magnificence, the mild regency of urbanity became more strikingly ap∣parent.</P>
<P>Thus the orb of day, with regular munificence, dif∣fuseth over the globe its genial influence; while the glow-worm sparkles only for those who take their sta∣tion within its narrow limits.</P>
<P>From a gentleman intimately conversant with Mrs. Wright, I have been furnished with some anecdotes relative to this extraordinary woman, which, as their authenticity is unquestionable, I shall present, as a bi∣ographical sketch, that I presume will not be altogeth∣er uninteresting.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wright was a branch of a family, residing in Crosswicks, in the Jersies, of obscure extraction, and humble circumstances; but remarkable for the pecu∣liarities, which distinguished its individuals. Of her father, Mr. Lovel, many singularities are narrated; but, as it appears that his life was unoffending, he had a right to the indulgence of his innocent caprices. After his demise, his eldest son determined to erect for himself a dwelling, agreeably to the fashion of his own ideas; and he combined with this resolution the ex∣traordinary ambition of preparing the materials with his own hands. He not only designed, but executed; and, both the tenement and its furniture were the pro∣duction of his ingenious industry, while every article evinced the skill of a master! He next constructed a spinnet, from which, <HI>self taught,</HI> he drew such tones, as are not often surpassed. The violin, too, became sub∣ject to the versatility of his genius; and he both made
<PB N="285" REF="034162_0631_0FFC6FE85A13DF70"/>
that pleasing instrument, and executed thereon the most extensive compositions.</P>
<P>It appears, that either from want of ability or in∣clination, Mr. Lovel, the old gentleman, had not been over solicitous respecting the education of his children. Mrs. Wright was apprenticed to a mantua maker, with whom she continued, until she was mistress of her business. She formed her matrimonial connexion early in life, which connexion was unhappy; and her little family drew their whole support from her indus∣trious application. But, although her conduct during this part of her life was truly meritorious, yet, as her exertions were apparently the result of necessity, they did not pointedly evince those remarkable talents, which eventually produced her in the first circles in the me∣tropolis of England; nor did the demise of Mr. Wright produce an immediate change in her arrangements—the mantua making business still afforded her a kind of subsistence—her week's work procured her week's support, and her hours revolved in their accustomed routine, until an accident, rendered important by its consequences, originated a surprising revolution. A woman, offering wax figures for sale, stopped at her door; when Mrs. Wright, possessing a large share of that curiosity inseparable from superior abilities, ques∣tioned her relative to the composition of her commodi∣ties; and, for a small consideration, obtained that infor∣mation which proved to her the source of uncommon celebrity, and great pecuniary emolument. The celes∣tial spark of genius, so long dormant, was instantly blown into a flame; and, immediately throwing up her business, she became the ingenious fabricator of a new and astonishing creation! Her success was be∣yond her most sanguine expectations: from fancy fig∣ures, she proceeded to particular resemblances; and from her fashioning fingers grew the most finished likenesses. General admiration was excited, and the gratitude of those, who beheld exact transcripts of their beloved connexions thus multiplied and perpetuated, knew no bounds.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="034162_0632_0FFC6FE6D365E970"/>
Bordentown, where she had resided during her mar∣riage, soon became too narrow a field for the display of talents so rare, and she removed to the city of New-York, where she advanced rapidly in the career of fame! She soon furnished a spacious apartment with her figures, consisting of the most celebrated per∣sonages, in sacred and secular history, associated with respectable moderns, and beings, copied from her own imagination. By the liberality of her patrons, she was amply supplied with the necessary dresses, and her rooms became the resort of the curious, the gay, and the idle. Her next attempt was painting; and her essays, in this elegant art were by no means destitute of merit. Among other performances, she painted a miniature of Governor Tryon, which was esteemed an admirable likeness. Thus, uncommonly qualified by the liberal hand of nature, the orbit of this younger world being judged a sphere too contracted for abili∣ties so splendid, she was encouraged to cross the Atlan∣tic; and, furnished with letters to Doctor Franklin, then resident in England, and many other respectable characters, she bent her course over the great waters, taking with her some of her most capital pieces, as specimens of her abilities. Governor Tryon enclosed, by Mrs. Wright, the miniature she had painted, as a present to his sister, then maid of honour; this proved a most happy introduction. The lady, charmed with the accuracy of the similitude, was proportionably pleased with the instrument; and it is hardly neces∣sary to add, that her good offices were, from that mo∣ment secured. The protection and assistance of Doctor Franklin was in course, and the nobility and gentry, of every description, were numbered as her patrons. To her American collection of illustrious personages, she added, while in England, the most celebrated char∣acters of that nation. Even their majesties submitted their heads to the process of her art, and a just tribute of applause was rendered her, by all ranks. Lord Chatham was among the foremost of her favourers; he was an admirer of <HI>native genius,</HI> and a likeness of
<PB N="287" REF="034162_0633_0FFC6FE4A3687FB8"/>
this truly patriotic and deserving nobleman, the pro∣duction of her ingenuity, now figures among the prin∣cipal ornaments of Westminster Abbey.</P>
<P>Thus countenanced, and thus supported, her income, it will be readily believed, was sufficiently lucrative: She generally averaged nineteen guineas per week; and, considering the rapid progress she had made to attain∣ments so splendid, considering her origin, and group∣ing in the same view her established and unequivocal celebrity, we are ready to suppose her in possession of a fulness of felicity; but, it is, alas! true, that per∣manent happiness is not the growth of humanity.</P>
<P>As Mrs. Wright possessed great depth of understand∣ing, her intellectual powers were, of course, much exer∣cised, and the calculation of the probable consequences of events, was to her a continued source of inquietude. She was a profound politician, and her regrets, on ac∣count of the struggles in which her native country was involved, were immeasurably afflicting. Her attach∣ment to the soil on which she had drawn her first breath, was natural, if not laudable; but, it is to be wished that she had forborne to engage in a contest, so invidi∣ous, as that of an ardent disquisition, relative to pub∣lic men and measures; especially, as it seems to have put a period to those advances she was so rapidly making toward a splendid establishment of herself and family. It has been observed, that, although she was capable of the most solid and forcible reasoning, yet, her conversation was often so fervid and irregular, as to originate an idea of a derangement of intellect; this, probably, was the result of a warm imagination, a de∣ficiency in early instruction, and a want of the habit of methodizing her ideas; and, from this trait of incohe∣rence in her observations, and manner of expressing her sentiments, her character, <HI>in fact inoffensive,</HI> may possi∣bly have been misunderstood. But, be this as it may, she experienced unequivocal marks of the decline of public favour; and a conviction so painful, together with combining circumstances, induced her to pass over into France, where, under the auspices of Doctor
<PB N="288" REF="034162_0634_0FFC6FE22957B5B0"/>
Franklin, she was known, distinguished, and esteemed. At the close of the war, she, however, returned to England, thus demonstrating a decided preference to the Albion shore; and she expressed the warmest wish∣es for the perfect restoration of amity and unreserved confidence between the United States and their par∣ent country. This astonishing woman finished her mortal career in the month of March, 1786.</P>
<P>In the family of Mrs. Wright, genius seems to be hereditary: Her son now takes rank in the first line of painters in the island of Great-Britain; and we can∣not but wish him a double portion of that spirit of em∣ulation, which is ever stimulating to the highest attain∣ments in the gift of fame.</P>

<P>LET me execute the projected excursion in the month of competency; when the ripened fruits of Autumn, have received their richest finishing, and the life supporting vegetable, crowned by maturity, invites the reaper's hand. This is the selection of many a judicious traveller; but besides that the curtailed days of September and October frequently spread the evening shades, before the distant tour is performed, I have many other cogent reasons for preferring the vernal months to a more advanced season.</P>
<P>The morning of the year lifts its young head, and the enthusiasm of enchantment is in its gift; and although I do not contend for its intrinsic superiority over the more substantial blessings attendant upon
<PB N="289" REF="034162_0635_0FFC6FDE7AA780C0"/>
harvest home, yet, to the pleased eye of contemplation, it is adorned with inimitable charms. Many and ob∣vious are the advantages it possesses—its succession is the wish of every heart—it displaceth the long dreary nights, which, with gloomy regency, have pervaded the wintry months—it unbars the gates of life—the snow clad mountains once more lift their green heads—the howling blasts of winter are no more—the tepid airs are abroad—descending showers succeed each other—the mildly beaming sun emits its genial rays—all nature assumes an interesting aspect—and the pleasures of possession are inseparably blended with those of anticipation. Look where the spreading branches are loaded with the sweet scented and promise giving blossom. See the flowery tribes expand their odoriferous leaves—the surrounding atmosphere is richly perfumed—every breeze bears its proportion of the grateful effluvia, and we bless the salutary gale. The mellow toned warblers of the vernal season pursue their azure path, or enchantingly carol in the branches. The orient beams of light smile along the ethereal plain; not a view but is stampt with the most pleasing impression of which it is susceptible—but is fraught with images of rational pleasure; nor can we do less than partake the general joy.</P>
<P>Just returned from a tour of friendship, my heart at this moment glows with all those complacent sensations inspired by an extensive view of nature, garbed in her most fascinating charms. My excursion has led me through a delightful division of the Union, diversified by grove crowned hills, romantic vales, enamelled meads, and broad meandering streams. My route lay along Connecticut river, and through that part of the State of Massachusetts, which led me over Charles river, Malden, Beverly, and Essex Merrimack bridges. Every observer who hath traced this circuit, will readily acknowledge that it takes in a tract abounding with the sublime and beautiful. The most rapt sensa∣tions rushed on my soul, while the poverty of words necessitated me to remain silent.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="034162_0636_0FFC6FDC933E1A08"/>
The last mentioned bridge pronounces a panegyric on the abilities of the ingenious Mr. Palmer. It is totally different from the others, and appears to me to be a complete piece of architecture. It hath a sin∣gle arch which measures 160 feet from base to base, and its elevation in the clear is forty feet above high water mark. The liberty, granted by the legislature of Massachusetts, for the erecting this bridge, was, I am told, clogged with conditions of a singular nature; but the particular stipulation designed to crush it, has given it the noblest effect; its stability, by a wonderful contrivance, has received an aërial completion; and, while it exhibits every idea of durability of which its materials are susceptible, it happily unites what is not always combined with this fundamental advantage, a light and airy contour; and its finishing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>truly elegant. Great commendation is due to the meritorious artist. With much labour he hath since thrown a bridge over that difficult stream, commonly known by the name of Bloody Point Ferry; and he is now, we are told, employed in the Federal City, where, we doubt not, his talents and application will receive an adequate recompense.</P>
<P>Essex Merrimack bridge is useful and productive beyond the most sanguine expectations of the proprie∣tors. It joins an enchantingly romantic little island to the main land: Its works are so wholly detached, as to wear the appearance of two bridges; and the convexity produced by the arches, is extremely beau∣tiful. A commodious house of entertainment, con∣taining dancing and dining halls, are frequently the scene of those pleasurable hours which the gentlemen and ladies of Newbury-Port devote to hilarity: it is distant from that respectable emporium only three miles, on a fine level tract, ornamented on either hand with trees of various growth, elegant seats, distant hills, and verdant plains. From the window of this convivial tenement, we have a view of a beautiful grove on the right, and the towering bridge on the left; and, I am inclined to think, our country produces few more
<PB N="291" REF="034162_0637_0FFC6FD89DECD7C8"/>
captivating scenes than are to be found upon Merri∣mack bridge, and its environs.</P>
<P>I have enjoyed some delightful hours in the course of my tour; I have brightened the chain of amity, and the heart of confidence is invigorated. My af∣fections expand, they glance comprehensively on the universal family of man; and I feel that humanity, of whatever description, or wherever found, is inscribed by the finger of Deity, is in possession of the unalien∣able rights of fraternity.</P>
<P>Warmed by the genial heat of a vernal day, the in∣valid quits the solitude in which he hath been immur∣ed; he inhales the salutary breeze, and he becomes invigorated by the parent beam. The resurrection of the year is also a solace to old age, and it is frequently regarded as a figure replete with consolation. "How fares you, Plato?" cried my friend, "I thought this fine season would bring you along; and I am glad to see you with all my heart."</P>
<P>Plato is a black man, born in Africa, who has num∣bered, according to the most accurate calculation which can be obtained, one hundred years; and he was for sixty years of his life the confidential friend and faithful servant of his master. The good old gentleman, when dying, evinced his high sense of the merit of Plato, by bestowing on him his liberty, and bequeathing him a piece of land, spacious enough to afford him, and a woman whom he had wedded, an ample support. A neat built cottage was upon the ground, it was suitably and conveniently furnished, and the legacy comprized the necessary farming uten∣sils.—"I am glad to see you with all my heart, Pla∣to," said my friend—"<HI>Tanke,</HI> Sir, <HI>tanke,</HI>" replied Pla∣to, "I come one <HI>pring</HI> more; I do know if I <HI>eber</HI> come agen; but all winter, when <HI>e cold weder</HI> and <HI>e torms</HI> come one after <HI>anoder,</HI> I <HI>tink</HI> I go and see maser's friends soon <HI>eber e come pring.</HI> I got no new <HI>quaint∣ance,</HI> maser's <HI>quaintance</HI> good enough for Plato; so I <HI>go e</HI> see <HI>dem,</HI> and <HI>den</HI> Plato <HI>e</HI> go home, make <HI>e</HI> old woman glad to hear <HI>e</HI> friends all well."</P>

Happy advantage of years, which thus properly throws down those distinctions of which we were once so tena∣cious: which gradually slopes the way to that equality, reserved for us in the silent tomb; and which may probably, in some degree, obtain, in the more perfect state of being on which we verge. Plato's spring was a kind of renewal of his youth; and the anticipated regency of the vernal months, helped to cheer and buoy up his spirits when the wintry blasts sounded fearfully in his ear.</P>
<P>A few weeks since, and the trees disrobed of their verdant foliage, bent beneath their icy burden; the vigour of the season arresting the progress of the ready boatman, imposed upon his industry its incontrovertible embargo. How strongly pointed is the captivating reverse—the jocund swain resumes his agricultural employ; he carols gratefully as he hastens over the dewy lawn; he turns the fertile glebe; he strews the promise giving seed; and the golden days of harvest rise to his imagination. The rosy milk maid passes cheerfully on; she joins the music of the groves, war∣bling, as she trips along, the rustic lay. Aurora, with her purple fingers, hath opened the gates of morn; the heavens are fringed with gold; the sun-beams glitter over the azure vault, and the children of econ∣omy resume their various employments.

<P>I love the various excursion; and the different man∣ners and customs, observable even in neighbouring towns, are to me sources of instruction as well as amusement. Perhaps, were I to characterize my countrymen from my own experience, I might orig∣inate very erroneous ideas; yet the faithful recorder will register as he observes; and, impelled by truth, I have to say, that as far as hath come under my ob∣servation, Columbia hath not neglected to acknowledge the claims of the stranger. Wherever I have wan∣dered,

hospitality hath hailed me welcome; and the grateful greetings of civility, when far distant from my native haunts, hath vibrated pleasantly on my ear. With a contemplative eye I have passed on, and the tracing of resemblances hath been one of my pleasures: many a dignified matron hath reminded me of my be∣loved Mary; to the sympathizing fair one I have re∣counted the story of her conjugal faith, and the loves of my Margaretta and her Hamilton hath arrested the attention and interested the feelings of the beau∣teous female, who, unacquainted with their personal attractions, could only be influenced by a predilection for intrinsic worth.</P>
<P>But I give place to a lady whose tour of pleasure seems not to have corresponded either with her expec∣tations or her merit, and whose remarks may serve as a proper supplement to this Essay.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have assumed an office, (whether properly qualified or not) the duties of which point out a cogni∣zance of, and an effort to correct, as well the petty deviation, as those enormities which essentially involve the peace of society, I take the liberty to address you on a subject, that, although little attended to, is frequently productive of real inconvenience. That few people possess the power of <HI>pleasing,</HI> the experience of every day incontrovertibly pronounces. I could make a thousand reflections, all very much to the pur∣pose; but I will confine myself to a single instance, being fully convinced that it will present both my de∣sign and its illustration.</P>
<P>Embracing the long days of this uncommonly fine season, I determined on a jaunt, from which I calcu∣lated on receiving a prodigious deal of pleasure; but to my great disappointment, I was so tormented by the <HI>civilities</HI> with which I was hourly persecuted, that I was kept in a continual state of vexation. I will confess to you, Mr. Gleaner, that the necessity of re∣fusing
<PB N="294" REF="034162_0640_0FFC6FD331EDC8B8"/>
any request, importunately urged, agonizes me beyond description; and I have frequently done vio∣lence to my most favourite wishes, and broke in upon plans that have been regularly arranged for a whole year, merely because I had not the firmness to with∣stand the solicitations of those, who did not care three brass farthings what became of me or my views.</P>
<P>But, to begin my journey—I sat out, escorted by my brother, a modest, docile young man, altogether as unequal to opposition as myself; we had taken places in the stage, a front seat in which is generally thought the least eligible; but as it was my wish to inhale the perfumed breeze, and to indulge myself with viewing the beauty of the surrounding prospects, I had stipulated for one of those seats. I was not, however, permitted to occupy it; my remonstrances were ineffectual; <HI>the travellers too well understood what belonged to politeness,</HI> to let me remain in a situation ex∣posed to dust, wind and sun; and I was compelled to take my quarters in a back seat, where I was absolute∣ly nearly suffocated in the want of air, and had noth∣ing in view but the number of very <HI>civil persons,</HI> who had thus contrived, with a politeness on which they plumed themselves very highly, to intercept every oth∣er prospect. After many days, during which I was persecuted with a multiplicity of attentions, all of a nature similar to that which placed me in the rear of the carriage, we arrived at a village in the neighbour∣hood of Philadelphia, whither I had been drawn by my desire of visiting a female friend, who had past some weeks at my father's. My friend is one of the few who is versed in all those delicate and minute at∣tention, which soothe and assist, while they neither op∣press which soothe; but, alas! by hard necessity she is depend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a set of beings, whose ideas bear no more affinity to her's, than, darkness to light; and un∣fortunately she possesses no power to influence their movements.</P>
<P>I am naturally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd of tranquillity, and that I might be indulged in my own way, I had no sooner
<PB N="295" REF="034162_0641_0FFC6FD051F72AB8"/>
reached the abode of my friend, than, avowedly for the purpose of contributing to my felicity, a numerous family, in all its branches, was thrown into confusion; a redundancy of apologies poured from every mouth, and they expressed, in the most moving terms, their regrets that their abilities were not proportioned to my superabounding merit. The children, too, were in dishabille—Mary's slip happened to be the worst she had; Catharine's holiday shoes were immediately or∣dered out; and the eldest son, that he might exhibit his parts to the best advantage, was directed to pin on those ruffles which were sewed to tape, and carefully reserved to ornament his person on those gala days, which occasionally occurred in the family; but a new scene of disorder was thus opened, one of those said ruffles was unfortunately lost, in search of which the whole house was engaged, and every thing turned topsy turvy; yet, although each individual largely shared the perplexity produced by this accident, the search proved ineffectual, and master Johnny was re∣duced to the necessity of setting down to supper with only one solitary ruffle! The good man of the house was thus furnished with an admirable opportunity of expatiating on female <HI>nonsicallities</HI> and <HI>primosities,</HI> and his satirical remarks were only suspended for the pur∣pose of helping to load my plate. I was importuned to consider myself at home, and I was accused of a want of complacency in those viands, which it was <HI>evident</HI> they had with <HI>infinite labour collected for the sole purpose of gratifying my ladyship.</HI></P>
<P>Supper over, I flattered myself, fatigued as I was, that I should at length be permitted to make my es∣cape to the chamber of repose; but, ah me! I found to my inexpressible chagrin, that we were then only beginning the fifth act of the drama; the whole fam∣ily were drawn out, and peremptorily ordered to sing for my <HI>amusement;</HI> and their tedious chansons, love ditties, and ballads, were chanted in rotation, encored and repeated in concert, until, at the instance of my sympathizing friend, I was permitted to retire. On

the ensuing day, scorched by the intense rays of a meridian sun, I was dragged over grounds, that evinc∣ed nothing so much as the ill taste of the owner, and returned to take my seat at the dinner table, where the incidents which occurred seemed but a continua∣tion of the scene opened the preceding evening</P>
<P>A round of visits succeeded, all of which were in the same style. I recollect one afternoon, a timely shower having given a peculiar sweetness to the even∣ing breeze, being on one of these same visits, I antici∣pated the pleasure of my walk homeward, distant about two miles; but this very shower, from which I had promised myself so much, proved a new source of vexation. The lady of the house, fearful that I might take cold after the rain, insisted on my accept∣ing a cloak; it was to no purpose I assured her it would be particularly inconvenient to me; she was not to be outdone in good breeding; the cloak was pro∣duced—it was a <HI>thick satin, lined, and full trimmed with a rich dark sable!</HI> I glowed spontaneously at its ap∣proach! but notwithstanding all my resistance, I was arrayed in this cloak; and I returned to my tempo∣rary home in a profuse perspiration. I might, Mr. Gleaner, proceed in my narration; but I have nearly got to the bottom of my paper. If I am properly en∣couraged, you may hear from me again; and, in the mean time, I take the liberty to add, that I have con∣ceived <HI>true politeness to consist in making people easy, and in permitting our connexions to enjoy themselves in their own way.</HI> I am, good Mr. Vigillius, your most obedient humble servant, and constant reader,</P>

<Q><L>Benevolence—can we too often trace</L>
<L>Those lineaments which mark thy angel face?</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL the energies of benevolence, responsive sym∣pathy, heavenly commiseration, a heart to con∣ceive the most extensively munificent plans, a head to fashion, and perseverance to execute—All these I have seen contained in the compass of one little frame; and this frame, invaded by the despoiler, was constantly struggling to make head against the inroads of an in∣satiate victor, whose despotic sway will continue, until the renovating morning, when He, whose government is universal, shall annihilate the power of a tyrant, who hath hitherto exulted to destroy.</P>
<P>Pleasant were his convivial hours; laughter rejoiced in his presence; but his mirth was unoffending, and all the sons of humour flocked to his standard. Ami∣ably tender-hearted man! the stroke which severed thy beneficent spirit from the debilitated tenement it inhabited, gave death to the high-plumed hopes of all those, who, calculating on thy capacious benevolence, were in the habit of expecting from thee emancipation from every difficulty. Thou wert hailed as the friend of the destitute, who experienced, as surely as they made application, either thy bounty or thy extricating interference. While a single piece remained, thy purse continued open; and when thy immediate powers of aiding thy suffering brethren were exhausted, thy access to kindred benevolence, facilitated by thy un∣common merit, furnished additional supplies; and such were thy resources, that the means of replenishing thy own funds were still at thy command. Often have I blest thy liberal purposes; and well did I know the goodness of that heart, which, alas! hath now ceased to beat!</P>

It can hardly be necessary to name a man, whose general celebrity was so strongly marked. The sons of sorrow will not forget to revere his memory; the lisping tongues of the children of gratitude will still chant the praises of the philanthropist; and the un∣bounded benevolence of a Joseph Russell may wake to extacy the yet unborn admirer of transcendent excel∣lence. Doubtless, he was a branch of the Shandian family; "<HI>the milk of human kindness,</HI>" with a never ebbing current, flowed in his veins; nor did any Le Fevre languish, within his knowledge, to whom he did not hasten to administer the oil and wine of consola∣tion. I recollect an anecdote relative to this benevo∣lent man, not perhaps generally known; and, as I conceive it will strikingly evince his affinity to the Shandian stock, I feel impelled to produce it. The circumstance adverted to, took place in his youth, when his pulse beat high for pleasure, and the hilarity of his disposition frequently presented him at the shrine of genuine humour.</P>
<P>A party of young men had determined to devote a morning to shooting. Russell, the soul of every enjoy∣ment, was solicited to join in the predatory scheme; and, unskilled in the science of refusal, the tenderness of his disposition was for once sacrificed to his accom∣modating temper. The evening preceding the ap∣pointment was spent in preparation for the important enterprize; and, at the peep of day, accoutred <HI>cap-a-pie</HI> for the occasion, he joined his depredating comrades. They marched for a time in a compact line; but judg∣ing that so formidable a body would spread the alarm through the little community, against whose rights they were plotting, they conceived some manoeuvring necessary; and, departing in separate directions, they prepared to ambush the little beings, who, alas! pos∣sessed neither policy nor defence, sufficient to enshield either their own lives, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that of their beloved nest∣lings.</P>
<P>Russell placed himself in a cumbent posture on the velvet margin of a limpid stream, almost surrounded
<PB N="299" REF="034162_0645_0FFC79494AC1B538"/>
by the tall trees that towered on its banks; his piece, primed for execution, was by his side, and scarce a breeze interrupted the peaceful serenity of the scene. The sun was just rising above the horizon, and its ra∣diant influence, darting through the foliage, spangled every dew-drop, and glittered over the azure bosom of the slowly winding rivulet. The birds, at length, flut∣tering in the branches, began the progress of the day. A parent robin perched on an extreme bough, im∣pending exactly over the head of our young adventurer, unconscious of the mischiefs that awaited him, incau∣tiously kept his airy stand. The ambushed foe present∣ed his piece, took aim, grasped the trigger, and was on the point of discharging his piece, when the un∣wary warbler, apparently in the moment of his fate, poured forth from his little throat such a stream of melody, as was more than sufficient to arrest the pur∣pose of a much greater adept in the science of bird-killing. The fascinating notes vibrated on the ear of Russell with swan-like efficacy; he dropt his piece, and again reclined perdue; he still listened; but his design was to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear,</HI> and not to <HI>destroy.</HI> The robin was soon joined by numbers of the feathered choir, who, mingling their matin lays, continued melo∣diously chanting; the ambient zephyr echoed the strains; every breath was in unison, and the music of nature floated around. It was a scene worthy of benev∣olence, and the rapt soul of Russell acknowledged its congeniality. "Blest innocents!" he cried, <Q>go, war∣ble in the ear of the maternal bird, and glad, by your sweetest carols, the domestic nest; narrate, my little flutterers, how you have disarmed your enemy, and say, that against lives so unoffending, his hand shall never more be raised.</Q> The birds, as if obedient to his mandate, or, more strictly speaking, alarmed by the sound of his voice, spreading their party-coloured wings, instantly dispersed; and Russell, shouldering his firelock, triumphantly left the grove.</P>
<P>To the raillery consequent on the tenderness of his nature, he was fully equal. His party had, what they
<PB N="300" REF="034162_0646_0FFC518BDABBDF40"/>
termed, a successful morning; and the feathered vic∣tims they produced, evinced the <HI>deathful</HI> valour of their exploits. Russell, on that memorable day, feasted on vegetables, in all their maturity of excellence and rich variety; he consecrated the era sacred from the repast of blood; and the ripened strawberry, meliorated by refined sugar and a flowing bowl of cream, crowned his dessert; nor was he ever after known to attempt aught against the defenceless and tuneful inhabitants of the grove.</P>
<P>I have thought that Russell's robin was a fit com∣panion for Uncle Toby's fly; and, that the annals of benevolence may no longer record the Shandian ebul∣lition as a solitary instance, it is here inserted. I con∣tend also, that the benign feelings which preserved the life of the robin, were original in the bosom of Rus∣sell; for, at that period, his eye had never travelled over the heterogeneous pages of Tristram Shandy.</P>
<P>The action, however trivial, was indicative of the disposition of the man; and it may be viewed as a sin∣gle thread of that web, the texture of which was equal and consistent. He was, in the most extensive sense, a philanthropist; the poet has perfectly delineated him. His sympathy and humane exertions primarily embrac∣ed those whose alliance to his blood naturally demanded his aid; but the rays of his beneficence, diverging from a centre so virtuously infixed, extended their genial in∣fluence to his fellow-citizens at large; and the human being existed not, whose claim to his regard he refused to acknowledge. Nay, his capacious mind, emanating from the Parent of the universe, encircled, by its over∣flowing aspirations, every being of every description. He anticipated the extermination of evil; and he saw, in imagination, vice, and its concomitant, sorrow, ban∣ished from the wide extensive circle of all intelligence. No wonder then that earth possessed, in his estimation, superior charms, and that, viewing it as the production of a supreme and beneficent Architect, it was dressed for him in smiles. When the severing angel caught from his embraces hose he best loved, he felt, it is
<PB N="301" REF="034162_0647_0FFA65BBEA921DF8"/>
true, a pang; but that pang was transient; and, wip∣ing from his cheek the natural tear, his elevated spirit rejoiced in the assurance, that he also was in a state of progression, and that he should soon rejoin them in a new and improved state of being. Thus he passed on; and, while he blessed the bounties of Omnipotence, the virtues of heaven were imaged in his bosom. Spirit of Pope! immortal bard! forgive this appropriating paraphrase of thy rich and beautiful versification; a description of the philanthropist must invariably in∣volve thy well selected ideas; and it suits with thy mu∣nificence to bestow, from thy abundance, a portion of that thou canst so well spare.</P>
<P>Benevolence—philanthropy—The name and charac∣ter of Mr. Joseph Russell has been considered as synoni∣mous with these virtues. Should I attempt to particular∣ize his deeds of worth, innumerable instances would crowd around. Thronging fellow-citizens, aided by counsel and by pecuniary gratuities—bankrupts reinstated—the little tenement and household goods of the widow redeemed from the merciless grasp of the unfeeling creditor—helpless orphans accommodated with pater∣nal friends—public measures, tending to the general good, powerfully supported—strangers hospitably re∣ceived, and taught to hail a second home.</P>
<P>What were the feelings of the amiable, the youthful La Fayette! How swelled the bosom, and how beat the pulse of his worthy preceptor, when, in the hum∣ble guise of persecuted foreigners, their wandering footsteps first pressed the threshold of the benevolent Russell! first met, in that celebrated abode of genial hospitality, a reception so amply suited to their exigen∣cies and their merits.</P>
<P>But vain in my recital. A virtue so uncommon, and marked by such a multitude of instances, dazzles by its refulgence; and, although many of his philan∣thropic exertions, which should have been recorded by the living fingers of immortal fame, enveloped by in∣gratitude, and clouded by a train of succeeding cir∣cumstances, are nearly erased from the tablets of hu∣manity;
<PB N="302" REF="034162_0648_0FFA65C0173383A0"/>
yet they are registered in the archives of heaven; from their imagined obscurity they shall again emerge; and, in the day of retribution, they shall blaze forth with additional splendor.</P>
<P>But hark! what plaintive sounds are those which vibrate on the ear? The voice of the pensive Elmira, borne on the stream of imagination, strikes suddenly on my memory; it breathes the sweet accents of grat∣itude. Let us listen to its pathetic strains.</P>
<P>"Forbear, my friend," she exclaims, "Oh! forbear—close not the page of panegyric, until I pour thereon my tributary sorrow—until I recite a simple tale, and give a list of benefits, which demand of acknowledg∣ment the boldest note that ever yet hath issued from lively gratitude. My days of prosperity were passed at a distance from the philanthropist; I had heard of him by the hearing of the ear, but my eyes had never seen him. My morn of life was happy; cherished in the bosom of parental tenderness, and blest with every requisite which my situation demanded, no rational wish remained ungratified. My wedded days succeed∣ed; and my power of contributing to the felicity of my connexions, was rendered more various and pleas∣ing. I dreamed not of portending evils, established, as I conceived, in life; I looked not for the bursting storm. Suddenly, however, it arose, and it deluged all those fair prospects which had blest my youth; surrounded by the waves of adversity, I was nearly overwhelmed by its billows. Writs of attachment; irritated creditors, and sheriffs' officers surrounded those doors that were barricaded with a frightful kind of vigilance. Abridged of liberty, that gem of incalcu∣lable value, whose cheering influence gilds by its own genial rays, even the cottage of freedom, I steeped the hours in tears; and, at the shrine of comfortless calamity, both my health and my reason were alike im∣molated. My name was unknown to the philanthropist, but my sufferings became its passport; and, unsolicited, the benevolent Russell had the goodness to plead my cause: Persuasion dwelt on his tongue; there was a
<PB N="303" REF="034162_0649_0FFA65D15247DEE0"/>
kind of magic in his virtues which generally operated successfully. What mortal could achieve, he did; and, to mitigate those ills he could not cure, he bent his utmost efforts. Change of air, exercise, a long journey—these were proposed by medical gentlemen for the restoration of my prostrated health and spirits. I commenced my melancholy excursion; my unknown friend met me on my way: It was in the beautiful village of D—, that I first saw the philanthropist; he essayed to chase sorrow from my mind, and to rekindle in my bosom the pleasures of anticipation. His kind interference followed me to the end of this tour of necessity; and he mingled with the dearest of my friends to gratulate my return. Nor did his beneficent efforts cease here; he was indefatigably persevering in my favour, taking in my fate the deepest interest, aiding me with genuine delicacy, triumphing in every propitious event, and warding, as far as he might, every adverse cloud. His acts of goodness to me, were the coevals of his being, and the last day of his abode in mortality witnessed his benevolent at∣tentions.</P>
<P>"Cruel was the stroke of death; it prostrated the hopes of the desolate; it precipitated from the summit of felicity to depths of sorrow the female whom he judged worthy of his confidence; it blasted the filial expectations of that incomparable young man, who, it is said, inherits with his father's name his uncommon virtues; and it clad in mourning the PUBLIC MIND. Benevolent Man! Matchless Citizen! and now, indeed, <HI>Divine Philanthropist!</HI> Let the tears that marked thy exit, proclaim thy value. But <HI>reflection</HI> arrests the tide of sorrow; it imposes silence on my lips, and I bow obedient to the behests of THE ALMIGHTY."</P>
<P>Poor Elmira!—yet we believe her gratitude hath not too far emblazoned; and we therefore constitute her sketch a true specimen of the benevolent and un∣commonly useful life of the late uniformly philan∣thropic and <HI>virtue honoured</HI> JOSEPH RUSSELL.</P>

<P>WITH the subject of my last number I was intimately acquainted; his virtues were daily under my observation, and I was familiar with his deeds of worth. But, to the Honorable <HI>Thomas Rus∣sell,</HI> whose name I am ambitious of inserting in my list of worthies, I was personally unknown; yet, I have frequently listened with rapture to the authentic nar∣rator of his meritorious deeds. The record of his life, is a record of splendid actions—of actions, which, gem∣med by compassion, and its attendant sympathies, uniformly gave to his character the highest lustre. With admirable propriety has the energetic Divine
<PB N="305" REF="034162_0651_0FFA65E18AEBB720"/>
adapted the sacred text; and a paraphrase thereon might be entitled, an admeasurement of the virtues and the usefulness of this universal benefactor.</P>
<P>"<HI>When the ear heard me, then it blessed me.</HI>" Forlorn and disconsolate, the children of adversity were en∣compassed about by sorrow; they looked, and there was no one to help, when suddenly the renovating voice of commiseration vibrated gratefully on the ear. Cheer up, ye sons and daughters of sorrow, behold the almoner of your God! Our common Father hath en∣trusted me with a portion of his property, that I may distribute to the necessities of the destitute: Come, therefore, my friends, and permit me to bestow that, to which your claims are indubitable. "<HI>When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;</HI>" nor is this strange, since so few people know how to approach the children of penury, with that consideration which their circum∣stances demand; no wonder that the voice of him who was exercised in acts of benevolence, should extort ap∣plause, even from the perception of frigidity.</P>
<P>"<HI>When the eye saw me, it gave witness to me.</HI>" Yea, verily, from the contemplation of benignity, we derive sensations truly pleasurable; we trace, with a kind of conscious pride, those actions which confer a dignity on humanity; and, if sickening envy is composed by the powerful opiates of self-interest, we give full scope to our admiration; our eyes are suffused by the tear of rapture; they delight to mark the philanthropist, and they follow, with ineffable complacency, so illustrious an ornament to humanity. "<HI>When the eye saw me, it gave witness to me</HI>"—the reason is obvious—"<HI>Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</HI>" Excellent motives of com∣placency! indisputable testimonies of transcendent merit! he bent an ear to the lamentations of poverty—he presented the means of living, and thus cut asunder the bands of affliction—he protected the fatherless—he hailed, with the gentle soothings of paternal conso∣lation, the bereaved orphan—he became the guide of his youth—he constituted the fund from which he
<PB N="306" REF="034162_0652_0FFA65E37496AD50"/>
drew an ample support—in one word, he was the pat∣ron of his life.</P>
<P>"<HI>The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me.</HI>" Do we not see the desolate stranger?—he has not where to lay his head—he is an exile from the place of his nativity—his natural connexions are no more—his spirit is broken by infirmities—the sorrows of his heart have invaded the seat of life—his brow is furrowed by those cares, which, alas! have proved ineffectual—his pallid cheeks are hollowed by the excavating hand of agonizing woe—his frame is emaciated—he trembles on the brink of the grave—"<HI>he is ready to perish.</HI>" But Russell was the friend of the friendless—"<HI>of him that had none to help him.</HI>" Hark! do we not hear the ben∣edictions of gratitude?—they are wafted upon the per∣fumed gale of fame—"<HI>he who was ready to perish</HI>" now swells high the notes of praise—existence assumes to him another aspect—hope is restored to his bosom—motives for attachment to life are suddenly multi∣plied unto him—his wants are liberally supplied—and, upon the head of his munificent benefactor, his tongue invoketh blessings.</P>
<P>"<HI>And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy!</HI>" Poor, desolate mourner! at the period which inhumed in the gloomy mansions of the grave, him in whom her soul delighted, her widowed spirit calculated on an unbrok∣en succession of melancholy days; but the heart of the good man still beat compassionately. In the bosom of Russell dwelt the virtues of commiseration—pleasant is the voice of amity, its honied accents sounded grate∣ful on her ear, and her heart once more "<HI>sings for joy.</HI>" Yes, undoubtedly, the path of Russell was the path of rectitude; it was pointed by righteousness, and wisdom influenced his election; for admirable is the judgment of that philanthropist, who becomes "<HI>eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, and a father to the poor;</HI>" who investigat∣eth the cause of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he oppressed; who "<HI>searcheth it out,</HI>" and arrests the decision of iniquity; who procureth a righteous hearing, and becometh an advocate for the afflicted. Such actions are indeed "<HI>as a robe and a dia∣dem;</HI>"
<PB N="307" REF="034162_0653_0FFA65EBBAD7D7C0"/>
they are productive of general benefit, and they are entitled to universal applause.</P>
<P>That Mr. Russell richly merited the eulogy of virtue, the unaffected sorrow with which all ranks of people re∣garded his exit, fully evinceth. To repeat, that he well discharged the filial duties, and was the principal prop of a venerable parent, who still lives to mourn his depart∣ure; to celebrate his attachment to the orphan children of a deceased brother; to dwell on his delicate and faith∣ful affection to the amiable females who successively be∣came the partners of his heart; to descant on his pater∣nal goodness to those of whose existence he was the au∣thor; or, to expatiate on his beneficent regards to the individuals who composed his household, would be but a superfluous attempt to distinguish and dignify propen∣sities, which are the residents of almost every bosom; and, had Mr. Russell possessed only these common at∣tachments of humanity, which are but a <HI>refined modifi∣cation</HI> of <HI>self-love,</HI> he would have merited no tributary lay, and his panegyrists would have incurred the charge of adulation. But to the <HI>friend of the friendless,</HI> to the universal benefactor, the bard of integrity spon∣taneously raiseth the song; and, although the ear of death is heavy, that it cannot hear, yet we pleasingly believe, that the immortal spirit sleepeth not; nor is it irrational to suppose, that it sometimes bends from its etherial elevation, listening with complacency to the effusions of gratitude, to the expressed commendations of those virtuous children of men, whose approbation it once delighted to merit.</P>
<P>To communicate benefits is truly godlike; and, in proportion as we are made instrumental in disseminat∣ting happiness to our fellow-creatures, exactly in such proportion we imitate Him who went about doing good. The exercise of munificence is invariably re∣garded with a glow of satisfaction; and perhaps this vestige of an illustrious and divine original, is never totally obliterated from the heaven-born mind. That Mr. Russell was eminently conspicuous for the <HI>number</HI> and <HI>value</HI> of his beneficent acts, the concurrent testimo∣nies
<PB N="308" REF="034162_0654_0FFA65F6EF4CC7A8"/>
of those who best knew him unanimously pro∣claim. Seldom have we known a character who hath so fully united the suffrages of all ranks in this partic∣ular; and it is, we conceive, on this ground, that the splendor and eclat of his life is chiefly rested.</P>
<P>His integrity and punctuality as a merchant; his extensive commercial knowledge, with the vast advan∣tages which accrued from his mercantile career, were but the appendages of sound policy, ingenuity, habit and application. The easy manners, the gracefully elevated deportment, the freedom of access, and gen∣uine politeness, attributed to Mr. Russell, but designate the gentleman. Early introduced to, and making a respectable part of, the most genteel circles, it would have been rather surprising, if his deportment had not been that of a man thoroughly well bred. His wealth, and consequent importance, might possibly place him at the head of those societies, over which he presided with honour to himself, and advantage to them; and his opulence may be supposed to have been his passport to many other honorary distinctions. But it has been presumed, that affectionate sympathy and unreserved sincerity are not <HI>generally</HI> the <HI>necessary result of an inter∣course with what is called high life;</HI> and for these pro∣ductive virtues, we are inclined to give the deceased philanthropist full credit; they were unquestionably inherent in his bosom; and hence issued those fertiliz∣ing streams, which made glad the sons and daughters of sorrow; hence originated that cheerful and equal disposition of mind, and that frankness of temper, which banished suspicion, and authorized the most un∣equivocal confidence; and, to the same source we may likewise trace his unbounded hospitality, and that man∣ly and grateful welcome, with which he ever greeted the footsteps of the stranger.</P>
<P>Religion diffused over the excellent qualities of his heart her meliorating influence; he reverenced her laws, and bent in humble acquiescence and filial obe∣dience to her dictates. Her ministers possessed his re∣spectful and distinguishing regards; he constantly lent
<PB N="309" REF="034162_0655_0FFA65F9F7E2FDD8"/>
them his countenance; he was particularly fond of patronizing men of merit in this line; and the hand∣some benefaction which he bestowed on the fund ap∣propriated to the relief of those among their widows, whose circumstances are embarrassed, is evincive of his attachment to, and consideration for, this venera∣ble body. Here again we are brought round to a contemplation of that liberality, on which we have chosen principally to rear the superstructure of his fame. It is said that Mr. Russell annually appropri∣ated <HI>twelve thousand dollars</HI> to private charities! What an ample relief must this sum, distributed by the hand of economy, have afforded to those indigent sufferers, who were the pensioners of his bounty! How do the virtues which give birth to such liberal arrangements command esteem! how do they endear the man, and exalt the citizen! And who but must painfully regret the exit of a personage, by whose departure such rich and copious streams are, alas! suddenly dried up? Who but must supplicate the Fountain of munificence, that they may again spring forth in the lives of his descendants? who, if they pursue the path marked out for them by their illustrious ancestors, will unquestion∣ably insure to themselves the highest possible honours, the esteem, confidence and approbation of their fellow∣men, the peace of their own bosoms, and the plaudit of their Creator.</P>
<P>But the munificence of Mr. Russell was not <HI>exclu∣sively</HI> shared by those claimants, to whom his judgment apportioned occasional gratuities; nor was it wholly confined to the citizens of Columbia. Mankind in gen∣eral, according to their necessities, seemed to be the object of his beneficence, while his diffusive and equal regards extended their genial influence to the far distant shore. Instances of his generosity are, questionless, echoed in many a clime; but a recent example, strikingly in point, may serve as a close to this sketch.</P>
<P>A respectable house in a celebrated European em∣porium, (the capital of which was supposed immense) celebrated for punctuality and probity, suddenly stop∣ped
<PB N="310" REF="034162_0656_0FFA65FCDC368CA8"/>
payment, and astonishment pervaded every de∣scription of our merchants. This misfortune was not attributed to ill conduct, but rather to a succession of adverse accidents; and an arrangement was speedily produced, which enabled one of the firm to visit Ameri∣ca, for the purpose of collecting outstanding debts. This gentleman arrived in the town of Boston, the metropolis of Massachusetts, (which place Mr. Russell then dignified by his presence) under the pressure of very unpleasant circumstances. Both the house and heart of the generously hospitable Russell were open for his reception. A travelling prince could scarcely have been received with higher marks of respectful atten∣tion; and he found in the bosom of this worthy fami∣ly, during his abode there, an elegantly pleasing asy∣lum. But this was not enough—the kindness of the American merchant stopped not here. From the pe∣riod which announced the failure of the European house, no commercial negociation had been entrusted to its firm. Under such a cloud the wary trader stood aloof; but the bosom of Mr. Russell possessed a sym∣pathetic chord, which, as surely as his eye glanced on the children of adversity, uniformly vibrated to pity; he regarded the claims of misfortune as sacred; and he conceived, that the suffering individual imposed on him duties which were indispensable. Through the <HI>powerful aid</HI> and <HI>extensive influence</HI> of Mr. Russell, two ships, richly laden with West-India productions, and calculated, with their cargoes, to amount to not less than <HI>forty thousand pounds,</HI> were consigned to the pros∣trate house! The emoluments arising from the sale of these valuable appropriations, let the arithmetician compute. What an advantageous re-commencement of business was thus furnished▪ and what a benign lustre is thereby thrown over the American name! But a further act of beneficence remains to be re∣counted.</P>
<P>On the departure of the European, Mr. Russell, with that delicacy which is the appendage of munifi∣cent actions, presented him with bills, for his separate
<PB N="311" REF="034162_0657_0FFA6601071F5958"/>
and sole use, to the amount of <HI>five hundred pounds ster∣ling;</HI> inclosing, also, like sums for similar purposes, to the unfortunate gentlemen with whom he stood con∣nected!!! To throw the veil of silence over virtues thus splendid, would, we conceive, betray a phlegmatic or an envious mind; and the advantages resulting from eulogizing the meritorious dead, are too obvious to need enumeration.</P>
<P>The panegyrist of the everlastingly absent, if he lev∣ies no tax on survivors, cannot be accused of interest∣ed motives; he has but expressed his admiration of what he has conceived <HI>abstractedly good;</HI> he does not do homage to the creature, for he regards every vir∣tue as emanating from Deity; and he is morally and religiously certain, that he risks nothing by prostrat∣ing before the image of his Creator, wherever it may consist with the arrangements of Omnipotence to im∣press it.</P>

<Q><L>Who can the coming moment designate,</L>
<L>Or to enjoyments give a certain date?</L>
<L>Those scenes that promise most, by fancy wrought,</L>
<L>And with enthusiastic ardour sought,</L>
<L>Full oft disgust the fond believing heart,</L>
<L>While disappointment tops her blighting part.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Again—when wrap'd in clouds the view appears,</L>

<L>The unexpected good we grateful bless,</L>
<L>And all its magic influence confess.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE experience of every day evinces that hu∣manity is subject to error; those calculations that we fancy we have made with the greatest accuracy, frequently, by proving the reverse of truth, betray our total ignorance both of causes and effects. I have
<PB N="312" REF="034162_0658_0FFA6605487BE3E8"/>
sometimes feasted, by anticipation, for many days, on the refined and genuine pleasures which I confidently believed would result from the collection of a select party of sentimentalists, who were, by appointment, to devote a few hours to the social enjoyments of conver∣sation. My heart has beat high with expectation, and I have hasted with avidity to the place of rendezvous; but, in vain have I watched for the moment of senti∣ment; in vain sighed for the richly enrobed thought, which I might bear as a trophy from a scene where I had calculated to partake the feast of reason; for, strange to tell, the gems of intellect were muffled in the thickest clouds—not a ray was elanced—and the company have separated without a single observation which could merit an inscription upon the tablets of memory!</P>
<P>But, if I have been necessitated to confess that expec∣tations, originating in reason, have proved fallacious, my mortification has been amply balanced by oppor∣tunities from which I have reaped a large supply of intellectual enjoyments, where I have looked for taste∣less silence, or noisy mirth.</P>
<P>Considerations of interest, the duties of good neigh∣bourhood, or motives of general civility, have fre∣quently introduced me to parties, that, but for the obligations thus imposed, I should have avoided. Yet, in these resorts, a rich repast has awaited me! Nature, unadulterated, and replete with sterling worth, has stood confessed; silence, impressed by respectful at∣tention, has hung on the lips of the hearers, and thus endowed with energy even the <HI>timid speaker.</HI> Inquiry has produced inquiry; a subject of conversation has obtained the general ear; individuals have alternately expressed their sentiments; rational conclusions have been deduced; and I have returned home, informed, complacent and happy.</P>
<P>"<HI>We are to have a pantomimical exhibition at the Thea∣tre—will you go, Mr. Vigillius?</HI>" said an inquirer; No, Sir—I detest pantomimes. Speech was bestowed on man as a distinguishing mark of superiority; and
<PB N="313" REF="034162_0659_0FFA68CAE97AFCF0"/>
it is, methinks, a strange depravity of taste, which, reject∣ing this dignifying advantage, confineth the performer to dumb shew: Besides, I have an insuperable aversion to the degradation of the "<HI>human form divine." Man was made in the image of his Maker,</HI> and I regard the debasement of this image, as absolute profanity. The antic gestures which the pantomimical performer fre∣quently assumes, in my opinion, do violence to every idea of propriety; and I pity the mind which is suffi∣ciently vitiated to draw amusement from such fantas∣tical sources.</P>
<P>"<HI>I will not dispute the correctness of your taste, Mr. Gleaner,</HI>" returned the gentleman, "<HI>but the pantomime is to be preceded by Shakespear's Tempest, or Enchanted Island.</HI>" What lover of the drama but feels his bosom glow at the mention of this immortal bard? I had read the Tempest, but I had never seen it on the stage; and a friend, whose judgment no votary of science hath ever yet impeached, had informed me its <HI>stage effect</HI> was wonderful.</P>
<P>Yes, I will go by all means; and, elated by the most sanguine expectations, in a front box I obtained a front seat. The curtain drew up; and the tempested ship—the billowy waves—the storm of thunder and lightning—the affrighted mariners—the crash of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alling mast, all together, obtained their full effect; and I could scarcely have believed it in the power of fiction to have raised such a hurricane in my breast. But, from this moment, I experienced little else but disap∣pointment and disgust. Some of the finest sentiments were so mangled and mutilated, that it became impos∣sible to re-unite them, or to endow them with that divine energy, thus extinguished by their dissolution, which was breathed into them by the creative bard, when they first received the vital principle. Whole speeches were so mouthed and misrepresented, that we smiled were we should have wept; and were fretting with vexation, when the genuine wit of the inimitable author should have excited the most mirthful approba∣tion! Yet the part of Prospero was well supported; he
<PB N="314" REF="034162_0660_0FFC518A035122E8"/>
seemed apprized of the gravity of his character, and he seldom forgot his dignity. Ariel, also, the spirit Ariel, her sylph like movements would indeed have become an inhabitant of the blue expanse; she was exactly what we could have wished her, as near celestial as the habiliments of mortality would permit; not a soul but blest the winged vision, and not a hand but was raised to approbate her emancipating ascen∣sion. Her "<HI>follow, follow, follow,</HI>" still vibrates melo∣diously on my ear; indeed, even the most phlegmatic must confess that Miss Harding is a very lovely and a very promising child. With respect to the other performers, they generally overtopped or undervalued their parts; and, although Dorinda and Miranda were very engaging women, yet they seemed to have little idea of that artless simplicity with which the education they were supposed to receive, should have invested them; and I suspect it will be some time before they will be qualified for an assumption of Shakespear's capital characters.</P>
<P>The play over, I was hurrying away, with the pain∣ful reflection that I had lost an evening; but in the moment of my intended departure, I was arrested by the observation, that a <HI>serious pantomime</HI> was to be pre∣sented. <HI>A serious pantomime!</HI> repeated I. I will stay then, and see of what stuff a <HI>serious pantomime</HI> is com∣posed. La Forete Noire, or the Picture Discovered—this was the title of the piece; and, to my great aston∣ishment, it possessed every feature of a well conceived and regular comedy. The plot was evident and strik∣ingly worked up; it had its <HI>Protasis,</HI> its <HI>Epitasis,</HI> and its <HI>Catastasis;</HI> and these introduced a most happy <HI>ca∣tastrophe.</HI> Whether the <HI>unities</HI> are strictly preserved, I cannot exactly determine; but if they are not, while Shakespear abounds with precedents of the utmost latitude in this respect▪ an inferior author will hardly become inconsolable for such defects. On the drawing up of the curtain, Madame G— was discovered at her toilette; from her work-bag she drew a parcel of letters, from which, selecting one, she seemed almost
<PB N="315" REF="034162_0661_0FFC5188780FD650"/>
to devour the contents; and while she traced and re∣traced the lines, we read, in her agitated countenance, the strongest emotions; Suddenly she arose, and now, with quick and perturbed steps, anon solemn and slow, she traversed the stage, evidently struggling to obtain that self-command, which may put her in possession of some degree of calmness—her efforts prove ineffectual, and she hastens to the wainscot, where, touching a secret spring, the pannel flies back, and exhibits a por∣trait, to which she addresses the most impassioned aspi∣rations. Every one readily concluded that the picture was the resemblance of a person whose image was unquestionably engraven on her heart, and whose letters she had been so fervidly perusing. On the ap∣proach of footsteps she retouched the spring, and the friendly pannel again concealed the object to whom she had been breathing her tributary sighs. A figure, on whose brow the dignity of manhood sat enthroned, next approached; she hastened to meet him; and we hesitated not to pronounce him the original of the portrait, the writer of the letters, and the man of her affections. A tender interview having succeeded, the almost distracted fair one warned him of approaching danger; and, so irresistible, so heart affecting were her pleadings, that, yielding to her energetically enforced wishes, and tearing himself from her embraces, he reluctantly made his escape from the open casement to which she had conducted him. Our heroine then approached an apartment, and a particular signal produced from thence a beautiful boy, whom she em∣braced with such animated transport, as induced us to pronounce, without hesitation, that she pressed him to a maternal bosom: After she had evinced, by a variety of animated gestures the inherent claim he possessed to her protection, she led him, all agitated and trem∣bling, to her toilette, and, putting into his hands a letter, the perusal of which produces in the child the unequivocal expressions of surprise, affection and filial duty, she has once more recourse to her treasure behind the wainscot; she points it out to the little
<PB N="316" REF="034162_0662_0FFC51829D85DC80"/>
cherub, who, in a transport of duteous attachment, assays to grasp the respected figure, leaps on his feet, throws abroad his hands, clasps them in a petitioning attitude, as if soliciting a father's benediction; and, in short, demonstrates, beyond the power of language, every emotion which could be supposed to triumph in the affectionate bosom of innocence, on an unexpected discovery of the author of its being. Just at this junc∣ture, a loud noise interrupted the sweet and amiable effusions of young attachment; the boy was hurried to his place of concealment, the picture veiled, and the lady prepared to meet the approaching storm; nor was she long held in suspense. Her father entered, and, ignorant of the marriage she had clandestinely procured, he was accompanied by a person, whom from his dress we conclude to be an ecclesiastic, whom he commands her to receive as her future husband. The authority of this father was marked by austere severity; he en∣joined with unrelenting sternness, and it was evident that he would admit of no appeal. The lady entreat∣ed, but her supplications were ineffectual; her tyran∣nic father continued obdurate. It appears he is one of those grey beards, against whom Octavian, in the Mountaineers, is so justly exasperated; and of course he is peremptory and despotic, and his weeping daughter is left to receive the man in black as her intended lord and master. He, good soul, appears to possess a comfortable share of <HI>sang-froid,</HI> and a most ludicrous scene ensues, to which the lady puts an end by making her escape; when her would be lover sneaks off in a manner which may be termed mock heroic.</P>
<P>The secreted child then presents himself, who, peeping from his confinement, and finding no one to cross his path, is compelled, by a very natural curiosity, to retrace the lines which had given him such surprizing information; he seizes the work-bag, and, skipping with it to the front of the stage, places himself in a convenient attitude for examination; one letter is taken out, and another, and another,
<PB N="317" REF="034162_0663_0FFA65B9418BCC38"/>
which, not proving the paper he wished, are careless∣ly tossed about, until, with childish impetuosity, he grasps the whole parcel, and after throwing them promiscuously over the floor, relinquishing the pur∣suit, he hastes to catch one more glance at the be∣loved portrait, by which he had been so much cap∣tivated. With skilful hand he touches the ready spring, the obedient pannel yields to his pressure, and he again exhibits those testimonies of a duteous heart which are so becoming, and in him so hazardous. But as the tremendous thunder and the lightning's glare, to him who had promised himself a serene sky, or as the roar of the hungry lion, to the traveller who dreamed of security, thus fearfully portentous sounded the tread of authority in the ear of the poor affrighted victim, who, all trembling and appalled, flew to his place of shelter, regardless of the letters that strewed the floor, and utterly forgetting to veil the treasured portrait. The old gentleman entered, and, starting with astonishment at the lettered floor, he happened to stumble upon the explanatory paper which the boy had overlooked; he reads, and a hur∣ricane of the passions succeeds; all is revealed; the clandestine marriage, the child, his secret residence, the pannel—he raises his eyes, and the uncovered picture vouches the authenticity of every syllable! He traverses the stage, stamps, distorts his figure, and acts a part proper for the madman, which sur∣prise and unrelenting cruelty had rendered him. With demonstrations of ungovernable rage, he makes his way to the sanctuary of innocence; and, rudely seizing the little sufferer, he seems about to sacrifice him to his vengeance; but the uproar producing the entrance of two ill-looking fellows, the beauteous boy, with expressions of savage barbarity, is commit∣ted to them! In vain the little unfortunate kneels and supplicates; his pleadings avail him not; and the ap∣pearance of his mother, while it heightens the agony of the scene, procures no relenting in the breast of the grandfather! She weeps, prostrates and implores;
<PB N="318" REF="034162_0664_0FFC5180CBA00F18"/>
but had she assailed the rude winds, or the impen∣etrable rock, her intercessions had been as effectual; driven to desperation, she seizes the lovely child, and once more presses him to her maternal bosom; by command of her savage parent, he is torn from her embraces, and forcibly hurried away by the ruffians to whom he is committed! while the distressed lady, fainting in the arms of her attendant, is borne off, and the scene is thus terminated.</P>
<P>We were next introduced to a dreary forest, where we met the little exile, for whom we were so deeply interested, with the two ruffians, who seem on the point of imbruing their hands in innocent blood!! By the most heart-affecting gestures, the little mourner discovers the agony of his soul; but mercy is denied him, and he trembles on the verge of eternity, when he is suddenly rescued by the captain of a banditti, who, putting those <HI>authorized</HI> assassins to flight, takes the boy under his protection. The robber's design to guard the child was unequivocally expressed, by his wrapping him in his enormous cloak; and when the succeeding scene presents the assembled banditti, pro∣ducing their various booty, we are prepared to admire their chief, who uncovers the rescued innocent as the fruits of his expedition. The disgust expressed by the nefarious fraternity, is the consequent result of their depravity; and we cannot but tremble for the little wanderer, although apprized that his protector is at hand, when we find him on the point of being sacri∣ficed to the turpitude of their feelings. His second rescue by the commander of these atrocious offenders—his subsequent pleadings for him whose hand was raised to take his life—the appeal of the chief to his subordinates—his striking comparison between the un∣merited clemency of that infant, and their unmanly and groundless malice—with the extorted applause and reconciliation which ensued, were finely imagined, and a most wonderful piece of acting.</P>
<P>On the dispersion of the robbers, we are called to witness a struggle in the bosom of the little hero, be∣tween
<PB N="319" REF="034162_0665_0FFC517E916D49D8"/>
his gratitude to his preserver and his filial af∣fection. He wore on his breast the miniature of his mother; this picture captivated the robber, and he endeavoured to prevail on the boy to relinquish it. Agitated to an extreme, he entreats permission to re∣tain it—any thing else he would part with—but that picture, clasping it to his heart, that picture must still remain with him. The robber offers him in exchange an elegant watch—this charms him—he seizes it with avidity, views it over and over, admires it much, claps it to his ear—and then, catching the picture, presses it to his lips, and, with a smile of self-complacency, de∣livers up the watch. The robber, (I can hardly pre∣vail on myself so frequently to bestow on him this de∣testable epithet) charmed by the strength of his filial affection, and admiring so much firmness in a mind so young, made him a present of the watch, and led him off in triumph.</P>
<P>The eventful forest then presents the lady herself, surrounded by the banditti. Either a voluntary exile from her father's house, or driven thence by his savage cruelty, she had wandered forth, and, ere she was aware, her trembling steps had led her to those haunts of horror!! All the energies of commiseration are now roused to action. A female—in a thick forest—surrounded by the most hardened wretches—no eye to pity, and no hand to protect. The abandoned villains evidently meditate the worst of purposes—rudely they grasp her hands—they seem to confer on a division of their prize—and, like savage beasts of prey, they exult over their agonized victim. The distress of the lady is beyond description—her fine tresses hang in disor∣dered ringlets on her well-formed shoulders—anguish riots in her pallid countenance—and succour, alas! is placed beyond all rational hope. At this moment, the captain of the banditti, accompanied by his little fa∣vourite, makes his appearance—a transient gleam of joy illumes the grief-worn countenance of the lady—she snatches her child to her bosom—but alas! the chief, more enchanted by the original than the picture,
<PB N="320" REF="034162_0666_0FFC5178C9486378"/>
immediately prefers his ferocious suit—he is rejected with spontaneous marks of detestation—a pointed po∣niard seems to be the alternative, to which, presenting her defenceless bosom, she smiles beneath the expected stroke. The mode of attack was then changed; and, while her beloved child is held by two of the most hardened of the banditti, a sword is pointed at his breast, which, it appears, her continued refusal will pierce with the stroke of death! Is it possible to imag∣ine a situation more shockingly interesting? Her feel∣ings were wrought up to a degree of frenzy—despair nerved her efforts—and, with more than mortal cour∣age, she flew, and, snatching the boy, fled with him from her pursuers! Again, however, she was over∣taken; but in the struggle, the general attention being arrested by the lady, the boy escaped, and she is borne off by the banditti.</P>
<P>But the pantomime draws towards a close, and hope begins to dawn. We are presented with the hero of the piece; his figure is commanding, and his counte∣nance unites the traits of those virtues, which go to the conformation of the gentleman and the soldier. His company is drawn up on the stage, and he is in the act of performing the manual exercise, when sud∣denly a little cherub, agitated and trembling, rushes forward, and, kneeling at the feet of the military com∣mander, supplicates his extricating hand; and, to make certain the assistance which he solicited, he presents the picture of his mother, then a suffering captive in the hands of the most abandoned of the human race. The picture was instantly recognized; and astonish∣ment, paternal affection, joy, grief, love, detestation, pity, indignation, tender apprehension, and determined bravery, in one pathetically interesting and tumultu∣ous contrast, were strikingly grouped. But no time was to be lost. Instantly, in a manner expressive of the hurricane in his breast, catching his son in his arms, and followed by his soldiers, he pursued his way to that recess of atrocious villany, to which his little guide directed. The consequences were precisely
<PB N="321" REF="034162_0667_0FFC51760D4B07C8"/>
what might have been expected; the robbers were sur∣prised in those haunts which they had believed secure; a skirmish ensued; fire-arms were employed; success declared on the side of rectitude; the banditti were completely defeated; and the victor, when in the mo∣ment of plunging his sword into the bosom of their chief, finds his arm arrested by his heroic boy, who forcibly representing the obligations he was under to this generous delinquent, who had repeatedly rescued him from the stroke of death, induced his father to raise him from the despairing attitude he had assumed, and to extend unto him the hand of forgiveness.</P>
<P>The parent of the lady now enters. Sorrow had meliorated his breast, and he seeks his daughter in that forest whither he supposes she had wandered. Trans∣ports unutterable grew in his soul at this rencountre; reconciliation and pardon dwelt on every feature and in every expressive gesture; and the piece concludes with an act of general amnesty, which possesses the power of conferring happiness upon every worthy individual.</P>
<P>I will not say that I have given an accurate sketch of <HI>La Forete Noire.</HI> I saw it only once—some months have since elapsed, and my memory may have been treacherous; but, during its presentation, I was inter∣ested, alarmed and soothed, and the finest feelings of my heart were in exercise. From Shakespear's Tem∣pest I expected much, but I had the mortification to witness its murder! Pantomimical mummery I abhor∣ed—yet the pantomime proved a rich entertainment; and, felicitating myself on the various talents with which humanity is endowed, I was happy they could be thus called into action; and I rejoiced in that ac∣commodating pliability which bestowed the power of embodying the feelings, even without the aid of lan∣guage.</P>

<Q><L>If the soft bands of amity entwin'd,</L>
<L>And kindred motives sway'd each letter'd mind,</L>
<L>The scatter'd rays of genius to collect,</L>
<L>And all its broad diverging pow'rs connect—</L>
<L>With hues more vivid, science then would glow,</L>
<L>And arts expansive, to perfection grow:</L>
<L>But arm'd against themselves, their efforts die,</L>
<L>No kindling heat the sep'rate sparks supply;</L>
<L>Corrosive mildews sick'ning envy spreads,</L>
<L>And desolation marks the path she treads!</L>
<L>Her fatal progress worth innate impedes,</L>
<L>Hope fades appall'd, and prostrate science bleeds!</L></Q>

<P>I COULD wish, methinks, that men of letters, and professors of the fine arts, would, by mutual con∣sent, form themselves into one great and illustrious commonwealth, appointing their several officers, com∣mittees of correspondence, and persons duly qualified to examine the claims of every candidate, who became desirous of a situation in their community; and I should, moreover, be solicitous that the republic, when organized, should be careful to impress on the minds of their delegates, the necessity of observing, in the in∣vestigation of those pretensions which might come be∣fore them, the strictest <HI>impartiality.</HI></P>
<P>There are grades in the intellectual as well as the natural world; and he, who may fill one station with respectability, may be utterly inadequate to the duties of another. Yet, let not the mental energies be de∣pressed; perseverance may do much; efforts gather strength by action, and emulation, lending wings to
<PB N="6" REF="034162_0672_0FFC54A0E7BF0898"/>
ambition, becomes an irresistible stimulus. The classic periods of a Belknap are not the production of every pen, nor is the energy of a Ramsay the growth of every mind; yet, the story of this new world, and the interesting events of the revolution, may become the exercise of humbler talents; and, garbed in simple language, may, for a certain class of readers, possess peculiar charms. From the lyre of Philenia issues the most captivating strains; correct, and highly polished, her deathless page may stand without a rival; but, shall the <HI>lowly muse,</HI> for this, resign those magic pow∣ers, which give lustre to the eye of grief, and sweetly whisper the soothing joys of mild tranquillity? Forbid it, every rich, ennobling motive, which swells to emula∣tion. No—rather let the trembling candidate, mark∣ing Philenia as a star of guidance, call into action eve∣ry glowing energy, each blest incitement, which may allure to eminence, and adventurously assay the radi∣ant path, in which the lovely vision, with beamy ex∣cellence, so splendidly succeeds.</P>
<P><HI>Well directed</HI> ambition, is, perhaps, the master spring of every great achievement, and order should consti∣tute the stamina of a literary republic. I would have every description of intellect exactly in its proper place; I contend, only, that the smallest spark of genius, so far from being quenched by <HI>cold neglect,</HI> or extinguish∣ed by the <HI>chilling blasts of criticism,</HI> should be furnished with those incitements, which are calculated to blow it into a flame; and, was genuine fraternity the broad basis of the commonwealth, which I have imagined—was every individual closely united in the bonds of af∣fection, a reciprocity of good offices would be studi∣ously cultivated, a combination of efforts procured; and the archives of the corresponding secretary, being considered as the sacred repository of every ingenious plan, or literary attempt, the united abilities of the wide extensive republic, thus concentrated, would be∣come a magazine of rich materials, from which the beautiful and august temple of arts and sciences would attain a degree of perfection hitherto unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034162_0673_0FFC5499EE2E24C0"/>
It has been a general complaint, especially among a particular class of men, that genius has never, except in the short luminous intervals of one or two brilliant epochs, been advanced to that elevation, to which its rare qualities gave it an indisputable claim; and yet, my memory, at this moment, furnishes me with in∣stances, that render this hypothesis rather problematic∣al. Pindar, we are told, continued, almost a complete century, one of the brightest luminaries in the literary hemisphere. Warriors of the first description, and statesmen of the most elevated rank, contended for his regards. His sacred poesy was acknowledged by eve∣ry order of the people—it filled the temples of the gods; and his divine odes, songs, and paeans resound∣ed through the Delphian aisles. The ministers of Apollo, erecting his statue, placed it among the most conspicuous ornaments of their temple; and the Py∣thean voice audibly pronounced, that one half of those early fruit offerings, with which the pious Religionist, on each returning year, failed not to gratify the con∣secrated attendants of the Delphian rites, should be regularly appropriated to him! Thus was the poet, while enrobed in mortality, invested, by the voluntary arrangements of gratitude, with a participation of di∣vine honours! and, when he ascended to the celestial abodes, his remains were distinguished by every dem∣onstration of the high estimation in which he was held. His fellow-citizens decreed, as a testimonial of their veneration, the monumental pile; artists combined their most arduous efforts, and the beauty of the ceno∣taph which arose in the hippodrome, and which was consecrated to the memory of Pindar, continued to ex∣tort the admiration of every observer, during six re∣volving centuries. Nor was this all—his uncommon worth and singular abilities became the heritage of his descendants: In the days of Plutarch, the posterity of the bard received a portion of the sacred victim. The house which he had inhabited became a barrier to the vindictive progress of the enraged Spartans; and even the Macedonian chief did a kind of homage to this dwelling.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034162_0674_0FFC549864F13EB0"/>
It is true, the fate of Homer may be opposed to the splendid fortunes of Pindar; but every thing relative to that prince of Grecian poesy seems to be envelop∣ed by the thick folds of obscurity. I remember once to have read a life of Homer, wherein I was informed that he received the name <HI>Homer</HI> instead of <HI>Melesigenes,</HI> by which he was originally designated, in consequence of his <HI>blindness;</HI> and yet, the same writer afterwards asserts, not only that <HI>seven cities</HI> contended for the honour of his birth, but also, that there were <HI>seven dif∣ferent Homers,</HI> who lived at distant periods of time, and whose abilities and fortunes were various. Query: <HI>Were these Homers all blind?</HI> Perhaps all that is cer∣tain of the <HI>inspired author</HI> of the Iliad, is, that his <HI>mental powers were unrivalled;</HI> and that his fame, col∣lecting added lustre from each revolving age, hath thus evinced its <HI>unquestionable right to immortality.</HI></P>
<P>Apelles received for his picture of Alexander, grasp∣ing a thunder-bolt, the full sum of four thousand pounds. He stood high in the favour of his sovereign, who seemed to conceive scarce any gratification too liberal for talents so conspicuous; even the beautiful Campaspe was not withheld, and Apelles continued, through life, to enjoy all those honours which his trans∣cendent abilities richly merited. But antiquity fur∣nishes many proofs of the respect which was, in the early ages, paid to <HI>mind,</HI> and the high estimation with which <HI>intellectual superiority</HI> was regarded; nor am I willing, hastily, to conclude that the moderns are wholly deficient in this particular.</P>
<P>The career of Addison was both honorary and lu∣crative; and, from the fortunate moment which put a copy of his Latin verses into the hands of Dr. Lan∣caster, he seems to be reaping all those marks of ap∣plause which were due to his genius and his appli∣cation. That noble patron of letters, Sir John So∣mers, the Macenas of the court in which he lived, obtained for Addison, from his sovereign, a pension of £. 300 per annum, to discharge his travelling ex∣penses,
<PB N="9" REF="034162_0675_0FFC5496D7DB96F8"/>
subsequent to which we find him the attendant of prince Eugene. He was rewarded for the celebrat∣ed poem which he entitled the Campaign by Godol∣phin—he accompanied lord Halifax to Andover—he was repeatedly secretary for the kingdom of Ireland—he was created one of the Lords Commissioners of trade—and lastly, he obtained the post of Secretary of State.</P>
<P>The literary fame of Pope was equal to the warm∣est expectations that ever bard, even in the moment of poetic frenzy, could have indulged; and his pe∣cuniary emoluments also invested him with a hand∣some property. The subscriptions which he obtained for the translation of the Iliad amounted to £. 6000; and he received beside, from Linto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the bookseller, no less than £.1200. After a patronage so liberal, he purchased his celebrated recess at Twickenham, where he realized the luxury of filial tenderness, sen∣timental retirement, the independence to which he was ardently attached, and that kind of friendship which is the rich growth of disinterested esteem. Yet the literary annals of the British page recounts the story of a writer, of no inconsiderable celebrity, who absolutely yielded up his existence for the want of that support so necessary to its endurance. But possi∣bly, in this instance, <HI>economy</HI> and <HI>conduct</HI> might be wanting. Prudence is not always the appendage of genius; and the most liberal benefactions may prove insufficient, if discretion is not consulted in their ap∣propriation. Later times have given us an example in the person of the unfortunate Savage; the efforts of his friends, to place him in any degree of inde∣pendence, were rendered ineffectual by his irregular conduct. Occasional largesses but furnished the means of renewed imprudencies; and the pension he receiv∣ed from Queen Caroline was annually squandered in a privacy, attended with circumstances of ambigu∣ity, from a knowledge of which his sense of propri∣ety impelled him to exclude his most intimate friends. But his justly celebrated biographer realized all the sweets of an easy competency, accompanied by the soothing reflection, that what he possessed was she
<PB N="10" REF="034162_0676_0FFC549340DEC740"/>
well earned reward of natural endowments, and of acquirements which perhaps have not frequently been surpassed.</P>
<P>But whether the general suffrage of mankind hath preponderated in favour of genius, I do not presume to determine; my present object is only to establish a persuasion of the necessity of a union of plans, and a combination of efforts, in order to the procurement of any desirable end. It is with pain I have marked the operation of that rivalship among the children of science, which too often terminates in a rooted aversion from each other. The acrimony and confirmed hatred of competitors, in any profession, is as unjustifiable as it is injurious; and it is from a view of the alarming effects, too often consequent on a similarity of preten∣sions, that I have taken the liberty to suggest the necessity of some general arrangements, which may open a line of communication, promote fraternity, and establish confidence and affection.</P>
<P>I am aware, that, agreeably to the decision of the Abbé Raynal, those are attentions which ought to be regarded as wholly foreign from the contemplations of an American. According to that writer, the rays of genius never have, nor ever will, shed their genial in∣fluence on the benighted bosom of a native of this younger world; punished even <HI>beyond</HI> the <HI>fourth gen∣eration</HI> for the crimes of their ancestors, they are doom∣ed, <HI>by the pen of this philosopher,</HI> to experience an utter dereliction of all those rare abilities, which could give them a title to enroll their names in the annals of fame! But transcendently excellent as was the Abbé Raynal, he was however cloathed in the habiliments of mortality; and while thus invested, we are not to stamp his ideas with the seal of infallibility. America has given birth to philosophers, politicians, and war∣riors of the first description; she numbers also a long list of celebrated proficients in the polite arts—West, Copeley, and Trumbull, natives of her soil, now take rank in the highest class of their profession, on the Al∣bion, shore; and it is said <HI>their admired productions are
<PB N="11" REF="034162_0677_0FFC548CD2493A88"/>
referred to, as a proof of the flourishing state of painting in the island of Great-Britain!</HI> We are fearful to give this article of information all the colouring of which it is susceptible, lest we should be suspected of a design to invigorate that censurable and acrimonious kind of rivalship, we have professed a solicitude to suppress.</P>
<P>Apelles, when painters are <HI>the subject,</HI> will always be observed as a prominent figure; and the finished touches of his pencil were marked by the winged en∣voys of fame. Yet did Apelles extend his regards to every competitor; he was conscious of that superiority with which nature had endowed him; and he ingen∣uously confessed that he supposed himself without rival or imitator, in the gracefulness of his figures and atti∣tudes; but, with that grandeur of soul which in∣volves a detestation of all unnecessary prevarication, he acknowledged his inferiority in many other branch∣es of his art. For the purpose of viewing and admir∣ing the performances of his cotemporary, Protogenes, he travelled to Rhodes. The <HI>first rate</HI> talents of Pro∣togenes would have blown up the passion of jealousy in a mind less liberal; but, disdaining to submit to an impulse so ignoble, he transfused into the breast of the artist the sentiments of laudable ambition. He drew him from his solitude, enhanced the value of his pic∣tures, and, pointing out to the Rhodians his elevated abilities, he extorted from them that applause, which, while they were lavish of their commendations of a stranger, they had, until that period, denied to worth which was the growth of their own soil.</P>
<P>Addison and Pope appear to have been, in some sort, under the influence of a spirit of literary acrimo∣ny: Envy, it is but too obvious, more than glanced on their minds; and the murky clouds of discord, dim∣med, for a moment, the pure lustre of two of the brightest luminaries in a constellation, which will con∣tinue to irradiate the latest ages. Of their disunion, posterity will judge; partizans will enlist upon either side; and it is left for the careful investigator of lit∣erary annals, to decide who was the aggressor, or with
<PB N="12" REF="034162_0678_0FFC548B49001B90"/>
whom the continuance of rancour remained. But the enthusiastic admirer of Addison, will blush, while con∣templating the accusation lodged against the elegant moralist, whom he hath ever delighted to honour; he can scarcely believe him susceptible of duplicity, or that he could possibly, while descanting on a meritori∣ous production,
<Q><L>Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,</L>
<L>And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer!</L></Q>
If, however, the fact is incontestibly proved, and it is reduced to a certainty, that "<HI>Atticus is the man,</HI>" ge∣nius itself will drop a tear, and the lover of dignified humanity will lament that the infirmity of a mind so truly ennobled, had not been consigned to oblivion.</P>
<P>As this, our sixty-ninth number, may probably stand accused of incoherence, we take leave to state, <HI>in few words,</HI> a subject, the importance of which we have been labouring to impress. We would open to the votaries of genius, in every part of the habitable world, where they may be supposed to sojourn, a channel of communication; we wish to see candidates for fame associated in every possible view; we are desirous they should cultivate toward each other a spirit of lenity and of candour; we have been aiming to excite an <HI>emulation of good offices;</HI> and we ardently recommend an <HI>unremitted exercise</HI> of the <HI>habits of affection.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ATTACHED to my country, and wishing her, very sincerely, a full harvest of opulence and fame, I would endow her with all those meridian
<PB N="13" REF="034162_0679_0FFC5489B6E3C200"/>
splendors which encircle nations, that have for many centuries been pressing onward to the goal of eminence. Yet, however precipitate my wishes may be, sober rea∣son convinces me, that every thing has its adolescence, and that the maturing hand of time, and the sunny beams of invigorating applause, are requisite to bring forward the germ, which the blighting breath of ill∣timed severity may blast in its bud. Under this con∣viction, I read with candour the American page, and I am solicitous to receive, with the <HI>utmost indulgence,</HI> every literary attempt.</P>
<P>Uniformly open to these impressions, my regrets on account of the fate of a Comedy, which made its ap∣pearance in the Theatre in Federal-Street, Boston, in the winter of 1795, may be easily imagined. I pre∣tend not to write a critique on that play. <HI>I confess a partiality for the author, and I do not therefore hazard an opinion;</HI> yet I take leave to repeat a well known truth: the production has never been brought to the test; it was performed but once; the players were generally deficient in their parts; and more than one of the comedians confessed, that they came on the stage with scarce a recollection of the sentiment which they were to express!! And yet this mutilated presentation has been deemed sufficient to procure a decision on the merit of the production!</P>
<P>I will own, that I have attended with some dis∣pleasure to comments, which were evidently the re∣sult of a want of information, and which were, never∣theless, pronounced with all the peremptory warmth of rancorous criticism. One coxcomb observed, that the piece was nothing else but a string of tedious, in∣sipid, unconnected dialogues, without even the smallest <HI>vestige of design,</HI> and that he found it altogether impos∣sible to continue in the play-house during its presenta∣tion. A second wished the author had not kept <HI>the den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ument</HI> out of sight until the last scene in the last act! It would have been better, he said, if the catas∣trophe could have met the view of the audience <HI>at ev∣ery turn,</HI> and thus given them an interest in, <HI>and pre∣pared
<PB N="14" REF="034162_0680_0FFC5486C74BCC40"/>
them for, the event!!</HI> A third conceived he evin∣ced his candour by allowing, that if <HI>the play could be metamorphosed into a novel, it might be endured!</HI> and a pretty Miss of twenty, titteringly expressed her hopes, that if the Comedy should be presented again, the players, in the <HI>plenitude of their theatrical knowledge, might for the honour of America, have the goodness to be∣stow on the paltry production—"What?</HI>"—Why, Mr. Gleaner, nothing more nor less than <HI>a plot!!</HI></P>
<P>It seems, that the feelings of the writer of this Dra∣ma, depressed by remarks of this description, officiously handed her both by friends and enemies, has declined the second presentation, which the justice of the Man∣ager honourably tendered her: Yet the Comedy, not∣withstanding the disadvantages under which it labour∣ed, was certainly candidly received by the audience; and, desirous to furnish those who have any degree of curiosity, with an opportunity of examining for them∣selves, I have obtained permission to transcribe the manuscript in question, with a view to its obtaining a place in your periodical publication.</P>
<P>Your work is confessedly a Miscellany; and, as there can be no impropriety in your admitting, among the variety it contains, dramatic performances, you may probably find it convenient to give it a regular continuation through the numbers of the Gleaner.</P>
<P>The author of <HI>the Medium,</HI> disgusted with an ap∣pellation which has been sufficiently productive of vex∣ation, now entitles her Comedy "<HI>Virtue Triumphant;</HI>" and you will have the goodness to introduce it to the public by this appellation.</P>

<P>Allow me, Sir, to say, that Miss Clairville is neither mean nor servile; <HI>she is the companion of Mrs. Bloomville;</HI> and she possesses sterling worth, sufficient to invest her with importance and independence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! <HI>Importance</HI> and <HI>independence!</HI> a girl, without either family or fortune, <HI>important</HI> and <HI>independent!</HI> ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish, Sir, you would consent to see Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know her, Sir, <HI>I know her;</HI> she is a needy adventurer, who came over here in the train of a French lady; and, imagining America was the land of Utopia, she preferred a continuance here to a re∣turn to blood and murder, and she hath now set up the <HI>very honourable</HI> trade of fortune-hunting. There, Sir—there is her character <HI>in toto,</HI> and her hopes are the natural result of her situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, you would not be thus irrational in matters of business; you would not judge and con∣demn a lot of merchandize by hearsay only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Mr. Weston, you seem to take a violent interest in this preposterous affair; and you must give me leave to tell you, Sir, that I do not take it well of you, Sir—No, Sir, I do not take it well of you, Sir.</P>
<STAGE>[Walks about in disorder.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, Sir, to offend you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had Charles Maitland taken it into his head to have <HI>fallen in love</HI> with the cherry-cheek'd daughter of any reputable mechanic, with whom I could have clubb'd the difference, and met on the true point of <HI>brotherhood,</HI> I might, perhaps, have been satis∣fied
<PB N="18" REF="034162_0684_0FFC547AED690FA0"/>
—But this foreigner—this Anglois Francois—this Mademoiselle—No, no, Charles shall never bring me to this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, Sir, you are right; your son, I be∣lieve, never will bring you to this; and had you heard him out last evening, you might probably have dis∣missed your anxieties relative to Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dismissed my anxieties relative to Miss Clair∣ville!</HI> Why, wha—what! How is that, Sir? Be so good as to explain yourself, Mr. Weston.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the young gentleman would have nar∣rated every circumstance relative to his attachment to Miss Clairville—his prepossession in her favour from the first moment he beheld her—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I never liked this love at first sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>He would, Sir, have laid before you the various methods by which he has assailed her heart—all the rhetoric of love has been exhausted—flattery, protestations of eternal constancy, of immortal tender∣ness—these have been all in vain, while the young la∣dy still remains firm and unyielding in her rejection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; and your son, despairing of suc∣cess in his own character, and confiding in your well known goodness, contemplated the obtaining your sanction, that, thus reinforced, he may make his attack with the greater probability of success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! very fine—very fine, truly—all this is very fine—but it will not do, Sir—it is all trick—mere trick, Mr. Weston—yet, let me see—since our little actress is in her heroics, it can do no harm to see how long she can spin out the play, and you may tell my son, that as his Dulcinea <HI>is resolved never to descend from her altitudes,</HI> I reverse that part of his sentence which relates to his banishment.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Enter a Servant, who presents a card to Mr. Maitland.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>[<HI>Maitland reads.</HI>]</SPEAKER>
<P>Matronia Aimwell presents her most respectful compliments to Mr. Ralph Maitland, and if he is disengaged, she will do herself the honour
<PB N="19" REF="034162_0685_0FFC54744844C688"/>
to call on him in half an hour, on business of import∣ance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now what can her <HI>important</HI> business pos∣sibly be? But tell her that I shall wait her com∣mands with all reasonable satisfaction; and, d' ye hear, throw open the shutters in the best parlour—set the new vases in order; let them be furnished with fresh flowers—run for Frize, the barber, and let my razors, powder and perfume-box be all ranged in my dressing-room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Servant.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, strange things do happen every day, and this Matronia is a whimsical kind of a woman, um, um, um—but I must prepare to meet her; and, in the interim, you, good Weston, will see and converse with my son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish, Sir, you would conclude to see Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Weston, determined as I am, it is not in the power of argument to move me.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Maitl.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it—if he was less systematic, and less opinionated, there might be some hope for my young friend. But, coolly inflexible as he is, even the virtues of Miss Clairville will plead in vain.</P>

<P>THE more I reflect, the more calamitous my situation appears! Methought my father's parting words amounted to a malediction!

Alas! alas! this dear obdurate girl was born for my undoing!!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good morning, Sir; have you prepared your written address to your father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Weston. <STAGE>[sighs deeply.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>But was not this your intention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was, Sir; but feeling a growing apathy which I determine to encourage, I forbear to prosecute my design. I am become fond of misery, Weston; I will woo it to my embraces, and it shall henceforth be my mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishing! Has Miss Clairville ceased to charm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! name her not—her breast is harder than adamant! Colder than the snow which tops the Alps—to warm her to the genial meltings of pity, is impossible; and she has no chords in her soul attuned to sacred sympathy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Discretion is a rare accomplishment in a maiden under twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Discretion, Weston! If she was awake to tenderness, it is impossible she could be always thus wise. I tell thee, man, I have followed her upwards of two years; and, although I have watched her every movement, yet not one dear conceding moment, one propitious word, nor even an unguarded look, hath ever blest my ardent wishes! And yet, Weston, I have not to accuse her of pride, undue reserve, nor incon∣sistency—however she manages it, for my soul I can∣not help acknowledging that her whole conduct seems one uniform exemplification of dignified propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy if your pretensions were sanctioned by your father, your difficulties would speedily vanish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Weston, you are too sanguine! my father's active interference in my favour, is not to be expected; and if it were, the probability is, that this haughty beauty would shrink from what her extreme delicacy would teach her to term an obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must forget her, then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="034162_0687_0FFC547131F99FF8"/>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forget her!! What, forget beauty, vir∣tue, and all those peerless accomplishments that give their possessor a claim to rank among celestials? For∣bid it Heaven, forbid it love, and every tender senti∣ment, which in bands indissoluble shall ever bind my heart to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you ever learned any thing from her, of her extraction or connexions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only general insinuations, ingeniously cal∣culated, as she supposed, to damp the ardour of my pursuit, and which have but served to add another rivet to those chains that bind me eternally hers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is truly politic: Were women but sen∣sible what charms unite in a candid, generous and frank deportment, even their love of sway would teach them to renounce the wily arts of deception.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you bring any news, Sir?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>News, old boy, what of news? Why thou lookest plaguy glum. I should hardly have run through fire and water to see thee, if I had prophesied such a reception; and I have, <HI>bona fide,</HI> laboured more to make myself visible in this apartment, <HI>than ever Alex∣ander the great did, in cleansing the Herculean stables.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Idiot. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> What has been the mat∣ter, Captain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>The matter! Why one lady insisted that I should dine with her; a second, that I should take tea; and a third, that I should pass an hour <HI>tete-a-tete:</HI> But at Bloomville's I was absolutely arrested; my hat and cane purloined; and I concluded I was made a prisoner for the day.</P>

<P>You have been at Major Bloomville's, then; How did you make your escape?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="034162_0688_0FFC546A85BA5AB8"/>
<SPEAKER>Capt. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>A stratagem, Charles—a mere stratagem. <HI>Hector surprised and captivated Troy by stratagem.</HI> You are to know that I am an immense favourite with the ladies at Bloomville's; for the Major, he is one of your sober dogs; but the lady of the house might vie with the mother <HI>of the Scratehii, when she visited king Solomon to admire his wisdom;</HI> and the charming Eliza, for whom, by the way, I have conceived an insur∣mountable <HI>tendresse,</HI> is as beautiful as a vestal, and not <HI>even Penelope, when she stole her father's images, was a greater thief;</HI> for, with one glance of her bright eyes, she hath pilfered the stout heart of a soldier, who has had the honour to serve under the great WASH∣INGTON; who escaped from the savages with half a dozen wounds, upon the tremendous fourth of Novem∣ber, and who hath since been principally concerned in quelling the whisky insurrection.</P>

<P>What can this Madam Matronia possibly want with me?

Now, if she should chance to have taken a liking to my person too—he, he, he—there is no calculating <HI>the caprices of the sex;</HI> but fair and softly. I have had one wife—one good wife too—and on <HI>just</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> distribution, <HI>one good wife</HI> is as much as ought to fall to the lot of <HI>one man:</HI> To continue a bachelor is <HI>one extreme,</HI> repeated mar∣riages is another; a <HI>Medium</HI> is my hobby horse, and dearly do I love to canter thereon; therefore, and for this reason, among many others that might be urged, dear, good, faithful Gertrude, I will continue loving and constant to thy memory.</P>

<P>Sir, I have taken the lib∣erty to call on you this morning on very particular business.</P>

<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, you do me a great deal of honour. Pray be seated.</P>
<STAGE>[They take seats.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you are very polite; but I really feel a little awkward.— <STAGE>[Hesitating confusedly, blushing, and looking down.]</STAGE> New to negociations which custom hath in some sort interdicted my sex, a degree of em∣barrassment may be compatible with the most upright intentions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I am entirely at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very obliging, and I flatter myself, that, in this my native place, my character is so well established, that a person of Mr. Maitland's well known candour will not see the necessity of scruples; and, although the nature of my request may be allowed to excite your surprise, yet as my honour hath hitherto remained unimpeached, you will not think it a very improper one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! Lord! what shall I say to her? <STAGE>[A∣side.]</STAGE> As to that, Madam—as to <HI>improper,</HI> and all that, it is hardly possible to say any thing about it. Some things are proper, and some are improper—I am not fond of extremes—others are—and so we wrap it up, Madam. I prefer liberty; <HI>I have been married, Madam</HI>—you have not; every one to his fancy. I, for my part, am perfectly content as I am.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Maitland appears embarrassed; takes out his snuff-box, and plays whimsically with the lid.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good heavens! what can he mean? <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Sir, I must confess you are a little ambiguous; but, to prevent every possibility of mistake, I will be very explicit. I have invested the whole of my property in
<PB N="25" REF="034162_0691_0FFC5464DF424DD8"/>
bank stock—I have immediate occasion for one thou∣sand pounds, for which I will give my note; there are some formalities attendant on drawing money out of our public repositories, which I am willing to spare myself; and, if you can conveniently furnish we with this sum on my engagement that it shall be returned to you in one month, the purpose, <HI>the whole purpose</HI> <STAGE>[bowing]</STAGE> of my visit here this morning, will be pleas∣ingly answered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that all? <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Madam, I am hap∣py—I had thought—I, I, I, am extremely happy, upon my soul, and I will fetch you the bills immedi∣ately. Well, I am greatly relieved. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE></P>
<STAGE>[Exit Maitland, precipitately.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Rising and crossing the stage.]</STAGE>
<P>Well, this is singular, upon my word; ha, ha, ha, truly ridiculous. It is beyond a doubt, that this good old gentleman supposed me a candidate for the vacant place in this elegant mansion! Surely it should teach me a lesson; for, if pursuits, far from being reprehensible, and a purpose that indisputably wears the garb of virtue, cannot shield from injurious suspicion, how are the vo∣taries of folly exposed to the multiplied shafts of cen∣sure! Unhappy sex! whose ways are environed with peril; surely we should not fail hourly to invoke the guardian care of attending angels.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Enter Mr. Maitland.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, Madam, here they are—exactly one thousand pounds; and you have only to sign this bond, and the business is finished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Seats herself and writes.]</STAGE>
<P>Sir, the facility with which you have complied with my wishes, and your confidence in my honour, hath made me eternal∣ly your debtor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! it is a mere <HI>bagatelle;</HI> never mention it, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Assure yourself, Sir, that I shall be punctual; some affairs of great urgency have impelled the ap∣plication of this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="034162_0692_0FFC546201B871E8"/>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It matters not, Madam; I make no in∣quiries—life is always subject to vicissitudes! and, to say truth, I have myself been lately thrown from the equality of disposition that I am accustomed to pre∣serve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really! I trust no accident hath happened in your family, Mr. Maitland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, an accident of the greatest possible magnitude!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I ask of what nature, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>My son, Madam, my only son, hath thought proper to <HI>fall</HI> irretrievably (as he says) in love with one Eliza Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this the accident which hath so dis∣turbed you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is there in it so strange?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, Sir, if I express my wonder at your regarding this event as a misfortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ought I not to regard it as a misfor∣tune, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not, Sir—Eliza Clairville possesses more dignity of sentiment than any young person I have met with; she is a high soul'd girl, and has more of mind than commonly falls to the lot of mortality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so; but I hate all extremes; and I had rather she were less aspiring.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish she would cease to play off her light airs on my boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Warmly.]</STAGE>
<P>Sir, a sense of obligation ought, perhaps, to seal my lips; but, thus urged, I must say you do Miss Clairville much wrong; and I take a par∣ticular pleasure in repeating that she is the most fault∣less young lady within my knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Madam, how long have you known her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Years, Sir—ever since she has been in the country; the lady, under whose protection she left
<PB N="27" REF="034162_0693_0FFC545D0CF7C360"/>
France, yielded her reluctantly to my care; and, re∣garding her as a model of discretion, I bestowed her up∣on my niece, on her marriage with George Bloomville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how long has my hopeful son been enlisted in her service?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your son, Sir, was early captivated by the charms of Miss Clairville; nor should you have want∣ed the fullest and most timely intelligence of this event, had there existed the smallest probability of a union of the parties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand you, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I pledge my honour, my life, my repu∣tation, that you shall never be entitled to call Eliza Clairville daughter, but by your <HI>unbiassed</HI> and <HI>avowed</HI> choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, very well; <HI>this looks well;</HI> the young woman may be prudent; and if she behaves properly, she will merit my thanks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my visit has been unexpectedly prolong∣ed: I wish you a good morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>To shield her from the gathering storm,</L>
<L>With faithful vigils should descend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! if Eliza's plaints could woo</L>
<L>The seraph from the bending skies,</L>
<L>Then might her feeble steps pursue</L>
<L>That smooth shorn path which peace supplies.</L>
</LG>
</SP>
<STAGE>[She rises and advances forward.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it will not be—music has not charms sufficient to remove the melancholy pressure by which I am borne down. Unhappy girl! orphan∣aged in my dawn of being—thrown on the com∣passion of strangers—rendered, by the malice of my fate, an outcast from that compassion—exiled in a foreign land—involved in a hopeless passion—every sentiment of my soul approving him, whom virtue im∣pels me to reject! Wretched, wretched Eliza! ill-fated maiden! it is only from the icy darts of death thou canst expect relief!</P>
<STAGE>[She walks about, agitated and unhappy.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Enter Charles Maitland from the house.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, forgive this intrusion; I sought you in the house; your servant informed me you were here; and having business of importance to myself, I so far presumed on your indulgence as to follow you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>The visits of my friends, Mr. Maitland, can never be unwelcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>How cutting is this indifference! <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Perhaps, Madam, I ought to esteem myself happy, that I am admitted in the number of your friends; and yet, Miss Clairville, to purchase a dearer title, had I worlds to bestow, I would think them well re∣linquished!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is matter of regret to me, Sir, that instead of that sentimental intercourse, which it would be one of my felicities to cultivate, you should thus snatch ev∣ery
<PB N="29" REF="034162_0695_0FFC545879134078"/>
opportunity of reference to a subject, which ought never to have been introduced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ought never to have been introduced, Madam! Can, then, the rational Eliza think so se∣verely of that tender connexion, which hath received the sanction of all ages, and which is the source of ev∣ery felicity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; Eliza Clairville does not think se∣verely of wedded amity; she respects, as she ought, the sacred ties of mutual love; but when fate inter∣poses its insurmountable bars, it surely must be consid∣ered as the height of folly, to be thus unceasingly at odds with destiny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Eliza, did you but know the dag∣gers which your words convey, you would exercise more lenity. Once more I solemnly protest, that, to call you mine, no sacrifices would be deemed too great! with you, each spot would seem a paradise! without you, life remains a barren wilderness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, this is too much; your looks too abso∣lutely border on frenzy! If you persist in what I can scarce forbear to term an ungenerous persecution, I must, however reluctantly, request Mrs. Bloomville to deny me to your visits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Madam, you may spare that request. I have called on you this morning to make one last effort; the success of this effort I have already seen; and, with to-morrow's sun, I bid you, perhaps, an ev∣erlasting adieu!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Alarmed, and off her guard.]</STAGE>
<P>How, Cha—Mr. Maitland—What can you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simply this, Madam. Traversing the Mall this morning with a friend, of whose worth, while in New-York, I had repeated proofs, we accidentally dis∣covered that, added to the ties of amity, we were also kindred of the melancholy mood. Allied by misfor∣tune, we have agreed to become companions in exile; and, with the coming day, I depart from those native haunts, which <HI>my Eliza</HI>—forgive the freedom of a de∣spairing youth—can alone teach me to value!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="30" REF="034162_0696_0FFC54542CCF7368"/>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you serious, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you the approbation of your father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father will suppose me on a tour of busi∣ness. <STAGE>[Eliza, much disordered, melts into tears.]</STAGE> Good Heaven! Miss Clairville, what mean these tears? Surely, the purple stream that warms me to existence, is not so precious in my estimation. Oh! could I flat∣ter myself, that tenderness for me impelled the kindly gush—But no—it is impossible—Eliza, in what have I offended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Maitland, your unimpeached veracity forbids me to question your sincerity—You certainly leave town to-morrow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly; unless I should be so super∣latively blest, as to be honoured by a countermand from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>In such a moment as this, then, virtue her∣self will permit a degree of relaxation. You have of∣ten, Mr. Maitland, accused me of insensibility: Alas! you little knew the heart you thus arraigned; it was cast in the mould of tenderness, and its dearest senti∣ments have ever been the offspring of friendship and of love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But these blest sentiments refused to sanc∣tion the vows of Maitland!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will be very explicit, Sir. Had I been addressed by a man, whom my <HI>heart</HI> and my <HI>judgment</HI> had approved, and who had been born the <HI>equal</HI> of my <HI>humble family and lowly fortunes, to a single moment's sus∣pense he should not have been condemned; my extended hand, accompanying my yielding heart,</HI> our mutual attachment should have received the sanction of the holy priest; and it would have become my study, to ameliorate the interest I had obtained in his bosom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming, inimitable woman! I would have died to have originated an affection so divine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Charles, is it possible you have yet to learn, that you are indeed the friend of my choice—that my tenderest wishes are your's? Nor will I blush
<PB N="31" REF="034162_0697_0FFC545054046B90"/>
to own, that if propriety and virtue would permit, this hand should be only your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Seizing her hand, and bowing upon it.]</STAGE>
<P>Heavens and earth! What do I hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hear a truth, Sir, which, had not <HI>insur∣mountable</HI> obstacles have opposed our union, should long since have been familiar to your ear—You hear a truth, for which my breast should still have been a grave, had not the precipitancy of your departure extorted it from me: But the knowledge that we are to meet no more, hath produced, by way of justice to my feelings, a declaration, which sincerity hath a thousand times suggested. And now, Charles, may eternal blessings crown your virtues—receive my last adieu!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>What means my angel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, as you depart on the morrow, a mo∣ment like this may not again present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And think you, dear, enchanting girl, that, so unexpectedly attaining the summit of felicity, I will thus voluntarily relinquish my stand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Charles Maitland will not de∣ceive me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>My projected banishment was on the ago∣nizing presumption, that Eliza never could be mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it is as true, as that her each pulsation beats for thee, that she never can be thine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You deal in paradoxes, my love!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>My meaning must surely be obvious: Eliza Clairville will never unite herself to a man, whose fam∣ily detests her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hope that my father may be pro∣pitiated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>That hope is not the offspring of probabili∣ty; it may serve to illumine the pages of a novel, or produce a happy denoeument to the fifth act of a play; but as it consists not with reason, let us not indulge it. No, my friend, prosecute your intended plan, and ten∣der remembrance shall be dear to our bosoms! in dreams we will converse, and in future worlds we shall be happy! Once more, adieu!</P>

<P>Madam, those mere <HI>bagatelles,</HI> on which the censorious world is pleased to comment so severely, would be placed by me, to the account of youth, a consciousness of superior beauty, and extreme inexpe∣rience, were I sure she regarded me with that decided preference, which a husband has a right to expect.</P>

<SPEAKER>Major B.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, not absolutely. Augusta Bloomville has too much pride to submit to actual de∣basement; yet, give me leave to observe, that, bred in the school of honour, I have imbibed a soldier's delicacy, and I am ready to say, "<HI>Cesar's wife should not be suspected.</HI>"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, indeed, grieved to find my niece so little domesticated, and so regardless of your interest; but I had flattered myself, that the innate rectitude of her mind had rendered her conduct, in other respects, irreproachable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far be it from me, Madam, to accuse my Augusta; and <HI>yet, to you, her more than parent,</HI> it may not be wrong to say, that I live in a state of mar∣ried solitude! that my Augusta, all charming as she is, constitutes to me, a source of agonized inquietude! Shop-hunting, visiting, cards, balls; these make up the routine of her life; while her husband can scarce obtain the smallest attention!</P>

<P>Well, well—I am not desirous of quarrel∣ing with Augusta for any thing. I was last night at
<PB N="39" REF="034162_0705_0FFC54376180E780"/>
the assembly, where, if I had not <HI>expired</HI> at the thought of your absence, I should have been the happiest being in the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed; for at the very moment when I was on the point of securing my number, who should enter the ball-room, but the very <HI>enamorata</HI> that I met at the New-York assemblies; drawn thither, undoubt∣edly, by my irresistible ladyship, and evidently im∣proved in every fascinating grace!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was indeed fortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortunate! it threw me into the most happy flow of spirits imaginable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did chance give him to you for a partner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Colonel never dances—so we enjoyed a most enchanting aside conversation, cut in at whist, came off victorious in the rubbers, and thus concluded a divine evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why will you not indulge me with the name of your redoubtable hero?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I mean to present you with the name and person of my <HI>Adonis</HI> in the same moment; and, by the way, he hath engaged to escort me to your <HI>levee</HI> this very afternoon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be happy to see him, undoubtedly. Pray, what figure did our ladies make before this stranger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O the frights! but he had eyes only for me. There was Mrs. Gadabout, most preposterously dressed, and Miss Trimwell, loaded with finery, while Betty Brilliant seemed a moving jeweller's shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! O Scornwell! you are mon∣strously severe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, too, was that antiquated dame, Arabella Worthy, whose face is a perfect antidote to every idea of conviviality; not a female but seems to shun her; and yet, because, <HI>forsooth! she chooses to com∣mence Argus to her baby-faced daughter, she never misses an assembly!</HI> Ha, ha, ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishing! Ha, ha, ha!</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such <HI>outree</HI> heads—such a redundancy of silks, laces, ribbons and feathers—O it is ridiculous! truly ridiculous, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Dorinda, you have given me as per∣fect an idea of them as if I had myself been present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! by the bye—Do you know that I ab∣solutely saw Tom Dapperwit and Miss Lovett, pass, arm under arm, down the covered promenade last evening? that off down to the ground, eyes rivetted, and tongue as smooth as oil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible? I had thought that affair was entirely given up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! she is the very quintessence of prude∣ry—But now I think of it, I promised to accompany her this morning, on a visit to Mrs. Arabella Worthy, <HI>and I make it a point not to break my word.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, dear, Dorinda, I shall expect you at tea, accompanied by your agreeable Colonel. Adieu.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Adieu. <HI>Ma chere amie.</HI></P>
<STAGE>[Exit Miss Scornwell.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This <HI>chere amie</HI> of mine, is wholly absorbed in what <HI>she terms pleasure</HI>—I, too, have made the ex∣periment; I have plunged into a life of gaiety, and the conclusion, which forces itself upon me, does not decide in favour of dissipation. Would, that fate had given me an object in which I could take an interest!—But I must not indulge reflections of this nature—it shall not be long before I will set about a reformation; and, by way of exordium, as I have a few leisure mo∣ments, I will devote them to Miss Clairville.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have too much neglected the good Eliza of late: There is a kind of dignity and uniform pro∣priety in her deportment, which involves a tacit cen∣sure upon the whim and levity of my more splendid acquaintance.</P>
<STAGE><PB N="41" REF="034162_0707_0FFC543339F2DE90"/>
[<HI>Enter Miss Clairville.</HI>]</STAGE>
<P>Miss Clairville, we have, for many weeks, been much estranged; permit me, my dear, to assure you, that this circumstance does not contribute to my felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do me honour, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam! Why that formal appellation? Let me be known as your Augusta; and address me as in those happy days, when order led the hours, and my aunt presided our sweetly indulgent monitress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was, indeed, a blissful period.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that sigh, Eliza? that swelling bo∣som, and that falling tear? Give me leave to tell you, that I have still a heart to feel for the sorrows of my Eliza.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too good, Augusta. My sorrows should be all my own, while happiness remains for Mrs. Bloomville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie! fie! Eliza, do not let despair, with blighting influence, blast your opening prospects. I shall yet see you blest in your own way—the amiable and deserving wife of Maitland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Is he not truly worthy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! he is all luxuriant fancy can image, mid its golden dreams of happiness—In figure, unex∣ceptionable—in grace, inimitable—in mind, the mod∣el of perfection—firm as integrity—melting with sym∣pathy for every child of woe—manly and brave, as conscious worth can render him—mild as the gentle breath of zephyr—candid as mercy—open as the lib∣eral hand of Heaven—and frank as young sincerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>O brave! <HI>It is evident, however, that his picture is drawn by the lavish pencil of his mistress;</HI> but, do you know that this same idol of your's was once on the very point of devoting himself to me; and that your saucy face, very mal-apropos, presented itself to rob me of my conquest? However, be not alarmed, child, I am not vindictive; and I shall give my voice for a speedy wedding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="034162_0708_0FFC542F421DA428"/>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall never be the wife of Charles Mait∣land, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is to hinder, in the name of goodness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will never obtrude myself on a worthy family, which would justly consider me as an obstacle to their advancement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will find means to conciliate the elder Mr. Maitland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were he to condescend to woo me for his daughter, I would persist in my rejection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange romantic girl!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, in vindication of this, my <HI>unaltera∣ble determination,</HI> I will furnish you with some particu∣lars relative to myself, which I have not, till now, thought it necessary to divulge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am all attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I drew my first breath in humble life—my parents commending me to the care of an opulent and noble family in England, left me an infant or∣phan; and my only patrimony was their benediction. From the family in which I was thrown, I received an education which might have suited royalty; but ere I had completed my fifteenth year, my patroness, the first of women, swelled her last sigh! Forgive my tears; the unexampled goodness of my lost benefactress, must ever excite them; they are a tribute due to her inestimable worth!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your tears are natural, and I cordially sympathize with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>My happiness fled with my angel protectress; the family estates devolved on the youngest son, who, of a numerous progeny, alone survived: This gentle∣man was a bachelor, and many years my senior; the ill state of health under which he at that time laboured, with the immoderate grief occasioned by the death of his excellent mother, who had long been his only pa∣rent, induced his physicians to advise a residence of some months in the south of France, and it was judged necessary I should accompany him. What shall I say—a sense of gratitude and honour seems to tie
<PB N="43" REF="034162_0709_0FFC542DB7B33760"/>
my tongue, and the shade of my departed benefactress arbitrarily imposes silence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without being a conjurer, I can easily de∣cypher the consequences; your quondam guardian was metamorphosed into a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I imagined him a bright exemplar of every virtue; but, forgetful of the ties of honour and the delicacy of my situation, he was capable of forming a deliberate scheme of seduction! and, while he assumed the guise of a tenderness truly paternal, he was cruelly plotting my ruin!!!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord! I almost gasp for you! By what means did you receive the knowledge of his infamous designs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>From a faithful friend, who, like a guardian seraph, hovered round my steps, and procured me a sight of letters, written by his own hand, wherein the deep laid scheme was fully arranged!!!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>These, indeed, were indisputable evi∣dences. How did you escape?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>The proofs, as you observe, were irrefragable; and, when he commenced his plan of operation, by inviting me to a little tour, in the progress of which, he engaged to make me certain communications which would importantly involve my future prospects, my vigilant friend received me to her arms, and secretly procured me a rank in the family of that lady, then on the eve of her departure from France, with whom your excellent aunt first saw me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your history, Eliza, is indeed eventful; but for my soul I cannot see a single circumstance which <HI>reason</HI> can consider as a bar to your union with Maitland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Madam, you must have seen that I am lowly born, portionless and unfriended! and shall I come like a heavy cloud on the prospects of that good young man! a step so reprehensible, would indeed evince me unwarrantably interested; nor will I enter a family whose every attention I should regard as a <HI>condescension which would tinge my cheek with the hectic of conscious inferiority.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="034162_0710_0FFC542899D92830"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not perceive, Eliza, that it is hardly consistent with your <HI>flighty sentiments,</HI> to set such a <HI>prodigious value on money?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do but submit to a necessity which the <HI>despot, Custom, hath rendered irreversible;</HI> and besides, Madam, who that hath experienced the <HI>luxury of wiping the tear from the haggard cheek of penury,</HI> will deny, I had almost said, the <HI>omnipotence</HI> of money!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I will only say that you are a dear, irresistible, romantic girl: But, as the dinner bell rings, we must haste to meet our guests, and we will seize the first opportunity of conversing further on these momentous affairs.</P>

<STAGE>[Enter Robert, preceded by Charles Maitland.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>DEAR heart! dear heart! these old eyes are almost blind with weeping! and my grey hairs, I verily think, will be brought with sorrow to the grave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Robert, be comforted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir! how can I be comforted? There is no good got by wandering from home. Master Charles, a young man, as you are, can have no idea of the mischiefs which abound in this wicked world!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to have forgot those principles which should support your age; you should remember that I shall have the same protection in distant lands that has been my refuge in America.</P>

<PB N="45" REF="034162_0711_0FFC542716C99E40"/>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is very true, Sir, but— <STAGE>[sighs deeply.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what, Robert?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But these are perilous times, Sir; very perilous times; it looks as if there would not be a mother's son left in the Old World; and, when I con∣sider how often I have carried you in these arms, it afflicts me sorely, Master Charles, that you should run after wars, and murders, and bloodshed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not going to the field of battle, Robert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no knowing what may take place, Sir; and then this Colonel Mellfont belongs to the English—every body says they will have bloody times in England, Master Charles; and, for my part, Sir, I think them are best off who have least to do either with French or English.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie, fie, Robert, these prejudices are un∣worthy of your benevolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, may be so, may be so; but my heart strangely misgives me; and if you go, poor Robert will have seen you for the last time! and who is there left to pity or to care for me!!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father will take care of you, Robert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Sir, Master is very good; but—but— <STAGE>[weeps.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor old man! I do not like to see thee weep. Hast thou visited our friends in Stricken Alley, as I requested?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Sir! could you have heard their piteous lamentations, I am sure it would have melted you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lamentations, Robert?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; for at the same time that I gave them your liberal benefaction, I informed them of your intended departure; and such a general shout of sor∣row, old as I am, I never before heard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor unfortunates!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then such blessings as they poured on you—His reward will be great, said one—It cannot exceed his deservings, said another—May the good God protect him, said all.</P>

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel myself enriched by their united ben∣edictions.</P>

<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what, dear Sir, will become of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>They shall still be my care.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who will take care of Madam Eliza, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, Robert?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, Sir, but, in my humble opinion, there never was a more heavenly minded young lady; and I have said it a thousand and a thousand times, that she was the exact resemblance of my young Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; for whenever I have carried her your letters, she has been so gracious, and has inquired so kind after my little orphan grand-children!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Clairville is indeed an angel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, when I have ventured to speak of your charities, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of my charities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; how you took the poor man out of prison; purchased all his goods at auction; and, after restoring both them and him to his wife and children, how you gave him a sum of money to begin business again: How you were constantly taking the part of the oppressed. When I have told her all these things, and much more, Sir, she would turn away to wipe off the tears, and then, lifting up her white hands and beautiful blue eyes to heaven, Robert, says she, your Master is a good young man, and a blessing will surely attend him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was my Eliza so kind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Sir, I cannot remember the half of what I have heard her say; but we all think, if once you come together, there will not be a poor person within a hundred miles of your dwelling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Robert, we must all submit to ne∣cessity. Go, my good fellow, and desire Mr. Weston to step hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will go, Sir.—It breaks my heart to think of his turning out into the world in these bad times.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Robert.</STAGE>

<PB N="47" REF="034162_0713_0FFC541E44CDA128"/>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor old man! I am not ashamed to own that the parting with him is not the least of my inqui∣etudes. But my Eliza, exalted pattern of every ex∣cellence! may Heaven shield thy virtues: Surely the gifts of fortune are estimated at the very lowest rate, when they are withheld from merit so transcendent, and profusely showered on vice and folly.</P>
<STAGE>[Enter Weston.]</STAGE>
<P>Well, Weston, what says my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>He takes the matter precisely as you ex∣pected; he thinks your absence will be temporary; laughs at the idea of your perpetual banishment; and pleases himself with anticipating your victory over a passion which he pronounces extravagant, the mere consequence of youth and inexperience: And he doubts not, he shall see you in the full enjoyment of that happy calm which is the offspring of reason, and the corrected successor of the heyday of the blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mere duplicate of what he said to me not an hour since.—I have narrated to you my eclair∣cissement with Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>That eclaircissement must have been very satisfactory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Weston, so it was; and yet, strange as it may seem, while the recollection of her tenderness elevates me above myself, a recurrence to her <HI>deter∣mined resolution</HI> spreads over my soul a kind of melan∣choly calm, which very much resembles despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>But ought you not rather to implant hope thereon, or at least to forego your design of quitting us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks flight implies cowardice, while the exercise of manly firmness might restore your peace; and, it should be remembered, that we ought to <HI>sustain</HI> rather than <HI>quit</HI> our posts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see that my removal from hence is quitting my post.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="48" REF="034162_0714_0FFC541B38EB0F68"/>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem stationed here by Providence; it is your native place, and your munificence has ren∣dered you a general blessing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not my intention to elude the designs of Providence; I will pursue commerce, and if my father's overgrown fortunes should come into my pos∣session, I will devise a regular system, which shall ren∣der them as useful as their magnitude will admit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellent young man! surely the interpo∣sition of Heaven will be manifested in your favour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is little merit in bestowing on the necessities of others what we cannot possibly appro∣priate to our own emolument. Have you adjusted those accounts which I committed to your care?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have carefully executed your wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are the receipts past?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there remains but one account open; Major Bloomville is considerably in arrears to me, but as I have reason to think his circumstances a little de∣ranged, I will not make application to him.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Enter Robert.]</STAGE>
<SP>

<P>The deep grief, of which this fellow's countenance is expressive, really affects me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Weston.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must indeed interest your humanity; but I will now devote myself to those preparations which yet remain to be made previous to your departure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, Mr. Weston.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Weston.</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Enter Colonel Mellfont.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Maitland, your most obedient—I have called on you to learn if you held your pur∣pose, relative to your journey; but I could hardly per∣suade your servant to permit my entrance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a weak old man; and, much con∣cerned at the prospect of my departure, he has, perhaps,
<PB N="49" REF="034162_0715_0FFA65CCA5210CF8"/>
conceived a kind of prejudice against the person, to whom he imputes a design, which he imagines so ill advised. There is some allowance due to years, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly. Poor fellow, I would glad∣ly dry his tears—I always feel compassion for persons in a state of servitude and dependence, Mr. Maitland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are perfectly right, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your servant, Mr. Maitland, has an added claim to my attention; old age, and grief, are power∣ful recommendations to that heart, which hath been long a proficient in the school of affliction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often been fearful that your bosom harboured some latent cause of grief; and our last con∣versation, without explaining the nature of your mis∣fortunes, has confirmed my suspicions, given me a very important interest in your happiness, and originated a wish that I could be any how instrumental in produc∣ing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are truly friendly; but, as the knowl∣edge of my misfortunes can be of no immediate im∣port, it may suffice to say that I am unhappy; that I wander from place to place without diminishing my sorrow, and that I hardly expect a remedy this side the grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir; I can commiserate, with∣out being impertinent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, the probability is, that the accusa∣tion of impertinence will devolve upon me; for, I am induced to put a question, which only a long and ap∣proved friendship can justify. I am informed, that you quit this town with a declaration that you will never return to it again! and that you are driven hence by unsuccessful love! Can this be true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks, Mr. Maitland, the lady must have made an erroneous calculation, who refuses to ex∣change her vows with your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very polite, Sir; but mine is no uncommon case. Fortune, blind to the perfections of
<PB N="50" REF="034162_0716_0FFA65CF850FD278"/>
the most charming and accomplished of women, sat her down in her book of distributions, pennyless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does your father approve of your attach∣ment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means; he condemns it as the gross∣est absurdity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how happens it that he has no eyes for merit so conspicuous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father has never yet seen Miss Clair∣ville. An excess of delicacy leading her to conceive that visiting in promiscuous company, and frequent∣ing public places, would ill accord with her humble fortune—she is only to be met in the circle of a few in∣timate friends, with whom my father is not conversant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is unfortunate—if you could, by any means, procure an interview, youth, beauty and innocence might become very powerful pleaders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, my father will not see my Eli∣za; and, if he could even be brought to consent to our union, it is more than probable Miss Clairville would reject our united supplications; for, while she has, in the most unequivocal terms, avowed her preference, she has, <HI>with the same breath, declared that she will never meet me at the altar, but on equal ground.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is noble, it must be confessed; but it is easier to <HI>form resolutions than to persist in them;</HI> in∣deed, the capability of such a determination, is, in it∣self, a prodigious effort, especially in a young woman. She, doubtless, has her advisers—are any of her friends within my knowledge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you mixed in the same circles with Miss Dorinda Scornwell, while in New-York; her in∣timacy with the Bloomville family, gives her frequent opportunities with my Eliza.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This may be a happy circumstance. I will request the honour of her private ear. I have of∣ten known female influence acquire an ascendency, which demanded the utmost address to surmount.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Sir, you are about to engage in a very untoward affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="51" REF="034162_0717_0FFC5419913CCFB0"/>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not. I have some knowledge of the character of your father—if I could converse with him on your subject, I have a pre-sentiment that I could inspire him with a degree of complacency for my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would find it an Herculean labour; but I will step to the library, where, at this hour, he is commonly to be found, and I dare say he will be with you in a moment.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Charles.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Written in the irreversible decrees of fate, the son of sorrow! I would extract a balm for my lac∣erated bosom from every fair occasion, in the which I can mitigate the ills, that seem allotted for a fellow creature: Indeed, the power to soothe the woe-fraught mind, partakes essentially the nature of divinity. O Howard! Howard! illustrious philanthropist! thou wert the veriest mental epicure that ever <HI>mere humanity embodied.</HI></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Enter Mr. Maitland senior, and Charles.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave, Sir, to introduce to you my very worthy friend, Col. Mellfont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Servant, Sir—servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, Sir, happy in an opportunity of paying my respects to the parent of a young person, to whom my heart hath, for a considerable time, been not a little attached.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am obliged to you, Sir; but, as to happi∣ness, Sir, it is an <HI>extreme</HI> which may do well enough as a Utopian plant, but which has never yet been found to take a very deep root in America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>We accustom ourselves, Sir, to a language, which, although perhaps, strictly speaking, is not chaste; yet, as it is generally understood, receives, nev∣ertheless, a current acceptation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, very likely, very likely—this world is given to see things through a false <HI>medium.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perfectly of your opinion, Sir; the world is, indeed, given to error; it is only a select few who see things as they are; while the blinded multitude,
<PB N="52" REF="034162_0718_0FFC5415F6315A20"/>
borne in the vortex of folly, will continue their idle whirl on the very brink of destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a striking sentiment, Sir—"<HI>the blinded multitude, borne in the vortex of folly, will continue their idle whirl upon the very brink of destruction.</HI>" I congrat∣ulate thee, Charles, on having attained so valuable a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have long been deeply impressed with a very high sense of the worth of Col. Mellfont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very obliging, gentlemen.</P>
<STAGE>[Bowing.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you deserve it; you have spoken ration∣ally. I have always been a cool, deliberate man, Sir, a lover of reason, and a friend of equality: Some of my countrymen hate Frenchmen—some hate Englishmen—these are both extremes, Sir; but, for my part, I love a man of worth, let him be the growth of what clime he will. <HI>I am a true brother of the Roy∣al Arch—my motto is equality, and I embrace the brotherhood with my whole heart, Sir.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admirable, Mr. Maitland—truly admira∣ble! I have often wondered at the early virtues of my friend Charles; but, as his youth has been formed under the genial influence of an example so transcend∣ently excellent, I shall henceforward cease to wonder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ah! Charles is well enough for a young man, as young men go—he has, perhaps, a few youthful follies that stand in need of pruning, and he may make a tolerable figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot but regret, Sir, whatever pleas∣ure I may anticipate from the tour, that he is so soon to be removed from your guardian observation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is his own choice, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, Sir, this choice may be influenced by circumstances. I suppose, my friend, that you would prefer a father's wing, to a state of wandering, amid that world of which you, at present, know so little?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Sir; but, such is my unhappy situation, that those scenes which have heretofore con∣tributed to my felicity, now stand forth, mementos of the severity of my destiny!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="53" REF="034162_0719_0FFC54124DA15D58"/>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! let him make the experiment, Colo∣nel—let him make the experiment—he talks of never returning; but, this is all mere romance: we shall soon see him again, like the prodigal son, cap in hand; and he will then know how to distinguish prop∣erly, and to make prudent calculations, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you are my father; I therefore owe you reverence, and I will be patient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Patience! ah, there is not a better ingredi∣ent in life, Charles, than patience; it is the very es∣sence of Moderation—cultivate patience, boy, and thou shalt have my blessing with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spoken like a father! I dare say, Sir, it is your wish that your son should prosecute business under your own eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; but, if he, not having received a sufficient quantum of <HI>centripetal force,</HI> is thus neglect∣ful of the laws of <HI>gravitation,</HI> thus <HI>centrifugally</HI> in∣clined, and <HI>chooses to fly off in a tangent, I shall not consti∣tute his antipodes—I shall not weep myself into a Niobe;</HI> I can tell him that, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you permit me, Sir, as the friend of your son, and the admirer of yourself, to speak with freedom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, I have all suitable regard to free∣dom; and it is my wish to support liberty of speech, by all means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In perfect confidence then, that I shall not offend, and with all due deference to your superior judgment, I will say, that I do not know any event that can have a more probable tendency to establish a young man in life, with the fairest prospects of tranquil∣ity, than an early connexion with a discreet and de∣serving young woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, provided always, that the choice of the said young woman be discreetly made, Colonel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what, Sir, in your opinion, constitutes a discreet choice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Equality, Sir;</HI> by all means, <HI>equality.</HI> If I have got ten thousand pound, the case is clear, she
<PB N="54" REF="034162_0720_0FFC540F4906F190"/>
must lay down ten thousand pound; and thus it will appear a connexion of cool, deliberate prudence, and not the impassioned, high flying result of romantic folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, are there not qualities infinitely more valuable than riches?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, Sir; and if it were a law as irrevocable as that of the Medes and Persians, that no one, who possessed money, should superadd merit, I would assuredly give my voice in favour of merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would, certainly, Mr. Maitland, find an exquisite pleasure in transplanting virtue into the most friendly soil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave to tell you, Colonel, once for all, that I am not fond of your <HI>exquisites</HI>—moderation is my desideratum; and my plan is, to abide by its dictates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Moderation is certainly highly estimable, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, now, Col. Mellfont, in things of less consequence, you would be in the exercise of prudence—you would not stake a thousand pound, in a game of whist or quadrille, against six-pence, Colonel. My name is Ralph Maitland, Sir; and I am determined to act for myself—I have not yet got into my dotage, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You ought, undoubtedly, Sir, to be your own master; and you are right, in supposing I would not hazard a thousand pound against six-pence; and yet, Sir, I should conceive, that a thousand pound was well laid out, in purchasing a virtue, in communicating felicity, or, in placing a fellow-creature in the rank, for which nature seems to have designed her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! ah! all this is very fine talking; but <HI>virtue</HI> is not to be <HI>bought</HI> and <HI>sold,</HI> nor, do I pretend to write notes, critical and explanatory, on the designs of nature; and, moreover, Colonel, you are quite wide in your calculations, for I am not ignorant of the pur∣pose for which you have given yourself all this unnec∣essary trouble; but, I say, you are quite wide of the
<PB N="55" REF="034162_0721_0FFC540DC1D31A20"/>
matter; it is not in my power to communicate felicity, for the young woman, being a rational young wom∣an, is herself perfectly convinced, that her connexion with my son would, in the nature of things, be highly preposterous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This conviction must have proceeded from a sweet and amiable disposition; it has made me a lover of her character; did she assure you of this her∣self, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, no Sir, I never saw her in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you not think it would be proper you should pay her a visit of acknowledgment on this occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps it may, Sir; and in order to con∣vince Charles that I will comply with him in all that is reasonable, I do not much care if I call upon the girl on <HI>this business.</HI></P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Enter Robert.]</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Capt. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we men of the sword do not exert our∣selves, and be seen in our places, we shall be treated with as little respect as a <HI>dead Carthagenian,</HI> and as our employment is undoubtedly honourable, even as hon∣ourable as was that of the great <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Constantinople, when he swore eternal enmity to the Russian Scipio's,</HI> so I think proper to behave with dignity, and to show, on all occasions, a becoming spirit.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my serenity, a fascinating girl!</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I have had friends, Sir; with gratitude I make this confession; and the privilege of ranking Mr. Maitland in the number, is a circumstance which furnishes a relief, that is, <HI>on the present occasion, truly necessary.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have ever, Miss Clairville, given thee a moment's pain, I repent it from my soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I, Sir, take leave to make the same ac∣knowledgment: An interference with your plans has ever been foreign from my intention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt it not, Madam. Wilt thou permit one question? Has my son's departure thy appro∣bation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, Sir, I have no right to give an opinion respecting his movements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam; friendship alone will author∣ize thee; and, as I respect thy judgment, I take the liberty to solicit thy sentiments on a step so important as his contemplated tour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do me too much honour, Sir; but, as I feel a degree of confidence in your indulgence, I will say, that I think young men of observation cannot fail of reaping advantage from a knowledge of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unexampled prudence! But perhaps, Miss Eliza, thou dost not love, or, as young ladies phrase it, thou hast no preference for my son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Greatly agitated.]</STAGE>
<P>Hah! Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Canst thou, Miss Clairville, rise so far su∣perior to the forms and fashions of thy sex, as to tell me plainly, how thy heart stands in regard to my son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Circumstanced as I am, Sir, your question, it must be owned, is a little singular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, Madam; but my freedom is a proof of my esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="61" REF="034162_0727_0FFC53F89A49FEE8"/>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be distinguished by you, Sir, must un∣questionably be highly gratifying to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider me as an <HI>old man,</HI> and do not hesitate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have ever reverenced years, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not evade my question, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not make a merit with you, Sir, for an avowal which will be entitled to no praise. From the first dawn of my reason, I have been accustomed to admire virtue, even to a degree of enthusiasm; and I have been taught to feel a strong predilection in fa∣vour of every genteel and graceful accomplishment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I do not wish to conceal, that I have not felt my attachment to the virtues and the graces diminish, because they happen to be personified by Charles Maitland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this ingenuous declaration thou dost not wish to conceal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; for, not choosing to present myself as a candidate for matrimonial life, I care not who knows, that I have no heart to give.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is very natural for a young woman to contemplate an establishment by wedlock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, Sir; but, as I believe there are <HI>joys</HI> and <HI>sorrows</HI> peculiar to every situation in life, and, as I have conceived that it is not so much the <HI>part, as the acting well that part,</HI> which entitles <HI>the per∣former to respectability,</HI> so I am <HI>determined to rest satis∣fied</HI> with that character in the Drama, in which the <HI>great Manager</HI> seems to have cast me my lot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admirable young woman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your approbation, Sir, is truly soothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast thought very deeply, Madam, and made uncommon proficiency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Adversity, Sir, is an excellent school.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Walks about irresolute, and appears much moved, after which he says:]</STAGE>
<P>I have conceived, Miss Clairville, that there was a natural beauty in proprie∣ty, <HI>an unalterable rule of right, and an eternal fitness of
<PB N="62" REF="034162_0728_0FFC53F7167CB6C0"/>
things;</HI> nor will I yet relinquish my principles. Op∣position to thee, enchanting maid, must constitute the extreme of obstinacy; while, in thy lovely bosom, every virtue hath found a calm and happy asylum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Weeping.]</STAGE>
<P>Alas! Sir; you little know the imbecility of that heart which you would thus exalt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou shalt weep no more, my love—Know me henceforth as thy protecting father—the wishes of my son have now the fullest sanction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazement!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wilt thou not accept me as thy paternal friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Kneels.]</STAGE>
<P>On my knees, Sir, I supplicate eternal sunshine on that dear paternal bosom—but know, Sir, <HI>that my sacred, my irrevocable vow is registered in heaven</HI>—I can never wear the envied title of your daughter, except a miracle should render me the equal of your son; nor can even the wishes of Mr. Maitland recal the solemn hour which witnessed a transaction, that renders his unexampled condescension forever in∣effectual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishing! What hast thou done, Eliza?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me, Sir; but, fearing that my ten∣derness would one day betray my resolution, I bound myself by ties indissoluble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>My persevering obstinacy has undone my son! Rise, Eliza, dear, rash, heroic, and uncommon girl! What step remaineth to be taken?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Rising.]</STAGE>
<P>To submit to destiny, Mr. Mait∣land; and remember that this life is but a passage to a better scene of things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a hard necessity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>You accuse me of rashness, Sir: You be∣hold in me an orphan, friendless, poor, and claiming no natural protector! nor did I ever yet behold the being, whom I could challenge as relation! Consider, Sir, is such a female a fit companion for your son? Subordination, rank and degree, are of divine origin∣al; the lines are justly drawn; and he who breaks the rank assigned him by his Creator, is surely an aggressor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="63" REF="034162_0729_0FFC53F442D37AF0"/>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, uncommon girl! never were my own sentiments so well expressed before—it were a crime of no inferior dye, to urge thee further—I cannot even wish thee to relinquish ideas, originating in divine propriety. But what, Miss Clairville, are thy plans? Wilt thou permit me to regard thee as the daughter of my affection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>My utmost gratitude is due to Mr. Mait∣land—But, although orphanaged with my first breath, I have received from strangers that kind of education which secures my independence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>High-soul'd girl! it is impossible to fasten on thee the shadow of an obligation! Dost thou ex∣pect to see my son before his departure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, Sir: As if in love with anguish, we have appointed this evening to exchange the last farewel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maitl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming frankness! Admirable young la∣dy! I tear myself from thee. Thou hast made large inroads on that calm equality of disposition, which it hath been the study of my whole life to cultivate; and I hasten from thee, to recover that firmness of which I stand so much in need. Accept, Miss Clair∣ville, my cordial benediction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>May Heaven grant you peace, Sir. <STAGE>[Exit Mr. Maitland precipitately, and much disordered.]</STAGE> My soul has been too highly wrought, and the retirement of my chamber is necessary to restore me to the power of <HI>assuming a calm which I shall never feel.</HI></P>

<STAGE>SCENE—An Apartment in Miss Dorinda Scorn∣well's Lodgings.</STAGE>
<STAGE>[Enter Miss Scornwell and Jenny.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, Jenny, you say that Mr. Charles Maitland is really going to flee his country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Ma'am, <HI>sartingly.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where didst thou get thy knowledge, Jenny?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you know, Ma'am, you sent me to Mrs. Lacewell's for a new head—and so, seeing a
<PB N="64" REF="034162_0730_0FFC53F1D91B0C38"/>
crowd of people about Master Maitland's house, what does I do but pop my head in for a few moments, and there I found the whole house in tears, Ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, could your ingenuity devise no cause why the whole house should be in tears, except the departure of the young gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear, Ma'am. Master Robert was in a piteous taking—and so, says I, what is the matter? says I. Why, says they, Master Charles is going to leave us, says they; and we shall all break our hearts, Miss Jenny, says they.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mighty important matter to break hearts, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so I thought, Ma'am; but it didn't become a servant, as I was, to say so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, did not your curiosity inquire the reason of his departure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Ma'am; and they says, Ma'am, how that it is all for the love of Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nonsense—that creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so I thought, Ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is really intolerable, that servants should give themselves such liberties; but thus it is, they are eternally fabricating motives for the conduct of their betters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so I thought, Ma'am—'Tis quite <HI>in∣tolerant,</HI> says I, and impossible besides—But they says, that old Mr. Maitland will never consent to the match, and that he is willing young Mr. Maitland should go to the wars, in hopes that it will break the neck of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the wars, Jenny?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma'am; for they says, as how that nobody goes over the seas, in these <HI>trepidation</HI> times, without fighting, Ma'am—so young Mr. Maitland may stand a chance of getting a wooden leg, or, may be, have his head chopped off by the <HI>Gluttoner,</HI> who, they says, is so greedy as to swallow a thousand heads for a breakfast—and then, I thinks, Ma'am, he will pay very dear for the love of Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ridiculous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="034162_0731_0FFC53EE725F37C8"/>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so I said, Ma'am—It is the <HI>hyperdis∣tic</HI> of folly, says I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flee his country, indeed! Let me hear no more of it, I charge you, Jenny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, truly, Ma'am—and I told them all this—Says I, Mr. Charles, says I, knows better than all that there; and if he might have Miss Dorinda Scornwell, I am sure she is better than she, every day she rises, says I; and a <HI>more richer, and a more prettier, and a more handsomer</HI> lady into the bargain—and, says I, if she is a <HI>little older, what of that, says I, we cannot be always babies.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma'am, I did not spare them—not I—and I told them it was all as <HI>falsity as falsity could be;</HI> for that you were never desirous to marry Master Charles in all your born days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishing! Where will your imperti∣nence end? <STAGE>[outer bell rings.]</STAGE> Take yourself to the door, Miss Impudence, and see if there is no message for me.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit Jenny, muttering.</STAGE>
<P>The ignorance of this wench is intolerable; yet I cannot say that I feel perfectly indifferent with regard to this extraordinary decampment: Maitland was once my favourite; and, were it not for the attention paid me by the irresistible Colonel, I should still think it worth while to throw some impediments in his way—But what a captivating successor is Colonel Mellfont; descended from a noble family, and of princely for∣tunes—it is true, he is my senior; but maturity hath its advantages—there can be no doubt entertained of my conquest of the Colonel's heart; his being here is a strong evidence, and his mark'd politeness at the as∣sembly last evening, is proof positive.</P>

<STAGE>[Exit Jenny.</STAGE>
<P>Now shall I be the envy of the whole town—the la∣dies will so rail—the gentlemen will so ogle—and at plays, balls, and card parties, I shall assume such a well bred indifference, stare so confidently, and insult my inferiors with an air so genteel, so careless, and so de∣lectably imperious, that it will be divinely charming!—<HI>Bloomville will absolutely break her heart</HI>—ha, ha, ha! <HI>Poor thing! her fortunes have long been on the decline</HI>—But I will trip to my dressing-room, consult my glass, and set my features in the best imaginable order.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir! you are very polite; but I have some business of importance, which claims my previous attention.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as to that, Sir, the word <HI>business</HI> admits of various significations—there are domestic affairs, there are commercial affairs, and a multiplicity of affairs—all of which come under the description of business, and all of which, I do assure you, Captain Flashet, I most truly detest.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Madam—certainly—I should conceive, a lady of your good sense would detest all these.</P>

<P>Miss Scornwell, I have taken the liberty to solicit this interview, on an affair of tender importance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[confused and looking down.]</STAGE>
<P>S—i—r, you are—I never was at such a loss for words in my life.</P>
<STAGE>[Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, Madam, a request of a very deli∣cate nature to make to you; and I flatter myself, in a bosom so compassionate, I shall not want an advocate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I hardly think Colonel Mellfont can request, what Miss Scornwell ought not to grant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are truly polite, Madam; I am aware that I have not been long enough in the list of your friends, to authorize my becoming your petitioner—but I throw myself entirely on your mercy, well know∣ing that in an ingenuous female mind this <HI>celestial</HI> vir∣tue bears extensive sway.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I must own—I—I—I think, Sir, as you say, that our acquaintance is not of very long standing; but I believe I may trust to the honour of Colonel Mellfont—a soldier, Sir, will not betray a woman's confidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No man of virtue, Madam, will ever be∣tray a trust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perfectly of your opinion, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a plain man, Madam, and rather ad∣vanced in years; a tale of love will come but awk∣wardly
<PB N="71" REF="034162_0737_0FFC53DC6A51E0A8"/>
from my tongue; and it is so long since I have practised the language of supplication, that I am real∣ly at a loss for proper terms, in which to clothe my address.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I can dispense with forms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, Madam; I have known much of sorrow, and hence, perhaps it is that my feelings vibrate, even to agony, at a tale of woe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Probably, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the tender bosom of my amiable friend has ever been interested by the perturbed sensations of an impassioned attachment; if she can <HI>experimentally</HI> decide on the tyranny of the despot Love, <HI>even when success awaits his progress,</HI> she will be able to form an idea of the sensations of that heart in which hope is almost extinct, and her fair hand will be lent to ex∣tricate an unhappy man whom despair hath nearly engulphed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>S—i—r, however little I may know of love, were it consistent with delicacy, I could own—I could acknowledge that my heart is far from being insensible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can she mean? <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> It would be impertinent, Madam, to press you further; and I will proceed to urge my suit with that energy with which deep feeling naturally inspires a man who is <HI>grown old in misfortune.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel Mellfont can never plead in vain; and, I must say that it will be a distant day before <HI>his years will be considered as impeding his hopes.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, Madam—again I thank you; and, thus confirmed, I will proceed to say, that my yound friend, Charles Maitland—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles Maitland, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, Charles Maitland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss. Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what of Charles Maitland, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles Maitland is the most despairing and impassioned of men!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, I—I—I thought—I supposed—I—I—I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Madam, did you suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="72" REF="034162_0738_0FFC53DAE748C340"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you had been speaking of yourself, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam; certainly not; I have not the happiness of knowing the lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>What lady, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Clairville, Sir! and is this the mighty matter that has occasioned all this fuss?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fuss! Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean to insult me, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>God forbid!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Sir, what is Miss Clairville, or Charles Maitland to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you, Madam, condescend to hear me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[angrily.]</STAGE>
<P>O by all means, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was told you were intimate with Miss Clairville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> intimate with Miss Clairville!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was told so, Madam; <HI>and, judging by my own feelings,</HI> that you must have acquired an ascendency over her mind, I took the liberty of soliciting this inter∣view, for the purpose of supplicating for your interest in the bosom of this young lady in favour of my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have offended, Madam, I beg pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be as well not to lose him, how∣ever. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Pray, Sir, of what use was it supposed I could be in this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have some hope, Madam, that the attractions of Miss Clairville may soften the opposition of the elder Mr. Maitland; and we entertained an idea, that the securing the aid of Miss Scornwell, would be one principal step toward propitiating the mind of the young lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[haughtily.]</STAGE>
<P>Sir, you are deceived; Eliza Clairville is not of the number of my acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not Miss Clairville a resident in the family of Major Bloomville?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir: She is a <HI>low bred girl,</HI> with a tolerable face; a kind of upper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervant, whom the
<PB N="73" REF="034162_0739_0FFC53D8788C97D0"/>
childish good nature of Mrs. Bloomville sometimes permits to make one of the mutes in her private parties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was informed she was a young person of superior worth and accomplishments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a gross misrepresentation, Sir; how∣ever, I dare say, if you obtain the father's approbation, and if the son is in earnest, (which, I assure you, I very much doubt) you will find little difficulty in obtaining the young woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to think, Miss Scornwell, that it is possible you yourself may be deceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will find the girl precisely such as I have described her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, I shall deeply lament the infatuation of my young friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>She may please the eye, Sir; but, believe me, her power over Colonel Mellfont will extend no further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your sentiments, Madam, are a perfect contrast to those of Charles Maitland; and you will forgive me, if, in a point so nice, I suspend my judg∣ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Sc.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, you are undoubtedly at liberty to decide for yourself; and I, Sir, shall take the liberty to decline all interference in this preposterous business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[rising.]</STAGE>
<P>Well, Madam, I have only to beg pardon for this ill fated application. I shall have the pleasure of meeting you at Major Bloomville's anon. Your most obedient, Madam.</P>

<STAGE>SCENE—An Apartment in Major Bloomville's House</STAGE>
<STAGE>[Enter Matronia and Mrs. Bloomville.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, really, my dear aunt, this early visit makes me very happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I flatter myself, my love, that you do not now need to be told, my chief business in life hath long been to contribute to your happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not—but why so serious, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you not my niece, my very niece, Au∣gusta?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not these hands convey you from the breathless remains of your sainted mother, to that lov∣ed retirement, where it became my only consolation to inform and to soothe your infant mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>My obligations to you, Madam, are im∣measurable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say, Augusta, in those interesting moments, did you not sweetly promise you would transfer to me all that vast stock of duty, which, had she lived, would have been the unquestioned right of my angel sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, Madam; but you terrify me beyond expression!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>And tell me, dear Augusta, have I not mer∣ited your confidence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have merited my confidence, my gratitude, my every thing—but whither does all this tend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Augusta, I weep for you: How hap∣pens it that I have been the last to learn your unfor∣tunate situation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="75" REF="034162_0741_0FFC53D338FEF140"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfortunate situation, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Augusta! the whole town is loud in its comments—you are scarce ever in your own house. Did happiness dwell at home, Augusta would meet her there!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, I am not to be accountable for the censorious malice of an invidious world!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your husband, your family—I blush while I make the confession, are entirely neglected!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has Mr. Bloomville given himself airs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Airs, Augusta! your husband is too indul∣gent!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Madam, as you were never married, you do not know what these men—the best of them, are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had my Edward lived, Augusta, and had Hymen sanctioned our plighted vows, it should have been my study to have made him happy—I would have wept, when he wept—I would have rejoiced in his smiles; and my convivial hours should all have been his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam! a very trite adage is at my tongue's end, which I am half mad to utter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it, Augusta?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bachelor's wives, and old maid's children, are finely governed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange, strange levity! In the name of Heaven, from whence proceeds this change of charac∣ter? I remember when you would weep at a tale of woe, and utter sentiments that would have become a saint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, you are too serious—indeed you are!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never shall I forget the divine morality that passed those beauteous lips, when thou wert rescued from impending death by the very man whom thy well-timed charity had saved from ruin. Ah! Augus∣ta, why hath not thy wedded days presented the ripen∣ed fruit which thy early virtues promised? [<HI>weeps.</HI>]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would, I could dry those tears, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="76" REF="034162_0742_0FFC53D07B38E380"/>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can, Augusta—My early sufferings de∣volved my every hope on you; and, in your happier lot, I fondly calculated all those virtuous pleasures, and that tender glowing friendship, which, but for Ed∣ward's death, had blest my lengthening years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, you lov'd, you fondly lov'd your Edward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>What says Augusta?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I confess a truth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I seek not for disguises.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then know, my dear maternal friend, though much too late the sad confession, that I have never loved!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishing! Can this be Augusta Bloom∣ville?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, verily—and hence she seeks, in vari∣ed dissipation, to suppress that chagrin, so dangerous if indulged!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the name of Heaven, Augusta, why did you marry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because—because—because it was the fashion, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I charge you, on your obedience, that you be more explicit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a right to my most humble du∣ty, Madam. Major Bloomville was a soldier of rank, of family, and of fortune—of unquestioned bravery, and gentle manners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, very well, Augusta.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, Madam, he did not particularly please me; I experienced not those strong sensations which I have heard described; and my unconscious heart was as light as the party-coloured wing that skims the blue expanse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed in your narrative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>To admire Major Bloomville, became the fashion—rival maidens contended for the military he∣ro; and my vanity was agreeably flattered by bear∣ing off a prize on which so many bright eyes had been fixed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="77" REF="034162_0743_0FFC53CAE9E65180"/>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But with what sentiments did you marry Major Bloomville?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Long before that solemn hour, which made us ostensibly one, I was fully sensible of the situation of my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why did you not deal frankly with your lover?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wanted resolution, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did you not confide in me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Madam, I feared the comments of an invidious world, and trembled at its censures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I, Augusta, could have borne you guilt∣less, becoming myself responsible for your imaginary errors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never doubted your indulgence; but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what, Augusta?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my coward heart, esteeming Major Bloomville, and avowing no tender preference for any individual, shrunk from the various inferences, which receding would have furnished—and met him at the altar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[deeply sighing.]</STAGE>
<P>Alas! Augusta; the solemn hour which witnessed the perjured vow, hath register∣ed the guilty deed in heaven!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Guilty,</HI> Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Augusta—for in the presence of angels and of men, you made professions which were foreign to your heart! on us too surely you imposed, while bright celestials blushed at the transaction!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Weeping.]</STAGE>
<P>Wretched, wretched Augusta!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You betrayed the tender confidence and fond attachment of a worthy man!—implanted mid his fairest hopes the bitter seeds of anguish, and did him a most heinous injury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me, revered woman, thou who form∣ed my youth to virtue, is there no way by which I may yet recover the path of honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Augusta; forgiveness dwells in heaven! let your husband's wishes become your future study, and rectitude shall once more crown your hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="78" REF="034162_0744_0FFC53C966414A08"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shape thou my course, guardian of sacred virtue, and I will ne'er recede.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reflection, my beloved Augusta, doth not show you so very faulty, as your frankness, delicately susceptible, hath represented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blest indulgence! O speak, and soothe my soul to harmony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You esteemed the man to whom you gave your vows—loved no one else—and your fidelity re∣mains inviolate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>It surely does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps your gentle bosom was never form∣ed to combat the ungovernable ardours of imperious love; all are not fated to submit to its tyrannic sway: Love is an impassioned flame which oft consumes the noblest principles—it is a fierce monopolizer; and, trust me, dearest, at best an evanescent fire, which storms its little hour, usurping every thought, and then in air evaporates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your words possess an honied influence, that steals into my soul with healing power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friendship is still the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of every married pair—Friendship eternal is; it dwells in hea∣ven, crown'd with immortal beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what remains for thy Augusta?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Respect your husband's virtues—dwell on each splendid trait that marks his character; if he has faults, extend the ready mantle; let them not harbour in your bosom; but, far as you may, erase them from remembrance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blest casuist! a path so strewed with flow∣ers should seem the great reward of peerless virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Virtue is always pleasant, and her rewards are with her!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Already, Madam, my heart acknowledges that sweet complacency, from which, alas! it long hath been estranged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a blest omen; and indeed, Augusta, in every view your husband merits much; he is at this moment struggling with embarrassments, which his
<PB N="79" REF="034162_0745_0FFC53C7D214A980"/>
tenderness for your peace constrains him studiously to conceal from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I trust, Madam, that in this instance your information may be erroneous; for it was but yester∣day that Mr. Bloomville sent me home a rich emboss∣ed tea urn; and as I did not stand in need of such an article, I think it could not be the offering of depressed circumstances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Augusta, I have full authority for what I say; nay, I have myself this very day taken up mon∣ey as a relief to his pressing exigencies. The urn but serves to prove his fond solicitude to please; and at such a crisis it is indeed an uncommon instance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. B.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Weeping.]</STAGE>
<P>How barbarously have I re∣quited such unexampled worth!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Matr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dry up thy tears, girl; thy future happiness depends in a great degree on thy own conduct; from pecuniary embarrassments Matronia can extricate thee; mean time, Miss Clairville needs thy consolatory soothings; hasten to her, dearest, and I'll prepare to meet thy guests.</P>

<P>Ha! if you knew all!—but the world nev∣er saw such a pattern of wifehood as your Augusta is determined henceforth to exhibit. But enough of self—I would disperse those piteous sighs which tear your gentle bosom.</P>

<SPEAKER>Col. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy mother was my eldest sister, and on∣ly two revolving months witnessed her wedded life. Thy father, Colonel Seymour's death, plunged her into a fixed melancholy, deeply impressing on her mind, that she should not survive her infant's birth. Some circumstances of her life had induced her to con∣ceive, that persons, bred to an expectation of affluence, could not so easily be formed to virtue, as those who saw themselves the offspring of poverty; and, thus conceiving, she bound her family by engagements truly solemn, that, in case she bore a daughter, the secret of her birth should never be disclosed to her, until she had completed her sixteenth year. The event too well justified the prediction of thy mother; in giving thee existence she yielded up her own; and her family con∣sidered her injunctions as sacred.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>The hero's soul, by dauntless valour nerv'd,</L>
<L>From honour's radiant path hath never swerv'd;</L>
<L>Brave though he is, yet judgment points his way,</L>
<L>And peaceful counsels in his bosom sway.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PERHAPS there is not, in the whole catalogue of masculine virtues, a more desirable attainment, than that <HI>systematic bravery,</HI> which is the result of prin∣ciples, deduced from a <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>philosophical view of the propriety of those arrangements, consequent on the agen∣cy of a prescient and all-wise First Cause.</HI></P>
<P>The true hero enters the field of battle with intrepid valour—his innate serenity of mind is produced by a regular and well digested train of reflections—with a degree of tranquillity, beyond the reach of accident, he mounts the breach, and, with manly firmness, he leads on the martial band—the alacrity of his move∣ments are obvious; and, with fortitude unappalled, he prepares to meet the foe—innumerable deaths sur∣round, yet he continues uniformly sedate—he devi∣ates not to the right, nor to the left; but, to more than probable destruction, he marches on, and the language of his conduct seems to be: "To die is not an evil; when found in the bed of honour, it is even eligible. As death is a <HI>natural,</HI> it is, <HI>therefore, a beneficial event:</HI> If I am under the guidance of a <HI>supreme, all-wise, and all-gracious Being,</HI> his regulations in regard to me, must be replete with judgment, rectitude and mercy. To die is the lot of humanity; the present mode of existence must terminate; and every man, at some pe∣riod or other, must inevitably submit to the pangs of dissolution. Let me, then, meet the angel of death, while engaged in a laudable pursuit; I shall only be removed from one scene of things to another; the curtain will arise upon a higher order of beings; and I shall still continue under the cognizance of a pater∣nal Creator. Honour demands my attendance in hos∣tile
<PB N="89" REF="034162_0755_0FFC53AB91DA6B58"/>
fields; let me, then, cheerfully obey: The voice of my country hath called me forth; the career is meritorious; glory beams its most transcendent rays; and, at the destined goal, I shall receive my laurel crown. Avaunt! then, every ghastly spectre; nor presume to pervade, by the chaotic influence of disor∣ganizing hesitation, the region of my imagination. Length of days are not <HI>principally</HI> to be desired—let me rather devote my life to the service of those with whom I stand connected—let me rather dignify the term of my probation, by achievements which deserve to be immortalized! In a righteous cause I have drawn my sword—if I fall, my exit is both expected and honorary, and I am prepared to meet my fate—if I escape, it shall be my care to ascertain the justice of my claim to the warrior's meed, and Fame's loud clarion shall resound my deeds of arms!"</P>
<P>Thus, come life, come death—tranquillity is the he∣ro's portion; integrity presides in his bosom, and val∣our is his birth-right: He goeth forth to the battle, and his countrymen, his friends, and his brethren, fall around!—Humanity drops a tear—but fortitude is still an invulnerable shield; while, undismayed by dan∣ger, and beyond the reach of personal apprehension, he triumphs in the midst of slaughter; and if, at length, the missive weapon urged against his life, should transfix, by a mortal wound, he smiles beneath the icy darts of death—his equanimity is still the same; and with placid composure he will resign his breath. Such are the endowments he ought to possess, who en∣tereth on a military career.</P>
<P>The true hero is also a uniform patriot—his ambi∣tion is circumscribed by the public weal; and so well doth he love his country, that, although he possesseth the soul of valour, yet, if the councils of peace are dic∣tated by, and consist with honour, he will embrace them as his chief <HI>desideratum.</HI> He loves, and he will protect his country—her emolument is the <HI>ultimatum</HI> of his wishes; but still he is a citizen of the world, and the wounds of humanity transfix his sensibility.
<PB N="90" REF="034162_0756_0FFC53A8EC576CD8"/>
He is the guardian of the people's rights—but he gird∣eth not on the sword, except the manifesto of their grievances is stamped by the broad seal of justice. A well regulated government is the sovereign dictator of all his actions—his arrangements are the result of or∣der, and his appeal is to the laws which are ordained. He loves his country—but he is not solicitous to en∣large her boundaries—he remembers that Rome, when she styled herself mistress of the world, was not, in fact, more respectable than when her lust of domina∣tion was confined within a narrower circumference. He is not actuated by that wild ambition, which, with maddening influence, urged the baleful progress of the Macedonian chief—he feels no Robespierian thirst for human blood—he will never cry havoc, but when hard necessity compels—nor will he, but in the last ex∣tremity, let loose the dogs of war. Thus, while every circumstance of his life evinceth the energy of that <HI>amor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> which gloweth in his bosom, the broad philanthropy of his disposition is still proclaiming him the friend of man.</P>
<P>The profession of arms is useful and respectable. The Patriot Warrior is deservedly in possession of the esteem of mankind; and, if he acts a consistent part, he is an ornament to human nature. It is in this walk that a WASHINGTON, the illustrious Hero of this younger world, hath reaped undying laurels! and his immortal deeds illume, with new-born splendors, the brave man's path!</P>
<P>His early virtues authorized the most splendid predic∣tions; and, although sequestered in his first years amid his native shades, the neighbourhood of his Vernonian groves contained the only witnesses of his youthful prog∣ress; yet, from the studies in which he was engaged, re∣sulted the most substantial and best kind of information, while the useful and the pleasing enriched and adorn∣ed his mind. The mountain breeze endowed him with the glow of health; and he procured, from the pleasurable and salutary toils which diversified the en∣chanting scenes of rural life, a firm robust constitu∣tion,
<PB N="91" REF="034162_0757_0FFC53A767A27048"/>
expanded limbs, and a graceful, majestic, and well proportioned exterior.</P>
<P>His filial piety was early evinced. At that period of ardent expectancy, when the vivid buds of hope be∣gan to unfold their tender leaves; when tip-toe imag∣ination assumed its richest colouring, and the opening prospect was arrayed in the most splendid hues; just as the interesting youth had attained his fifteenth year, <HI>although entered, under the most favourable auspices,</HI> on board a ship of war, and only not embarked—in a moment so critical, he was withheld from the event∣ful pursuit, by the tender remonstrances of a mother, who, not availing herself of the authority with which nature had invested her, condescended to employ the language of entreaty. Soon, however, the venerable matron called into action that Grecian firmness, which was inherent in her bosom; and the youthful hero, while engaging in the military career, was enriched by the maternal benediction.</P>
<P>How honorary were his first onsets! and how strik∣ingly did they evince the unequalled abilities, that gave him an indisputable claim to those united suf∣frages, which have so repeatedly proclaimed him the <HI>Man of the People</HI>—the man who deserved, and who hath received, both the military and the civic wreath.</P>
<P>Illustrious citizen! how faultless and how glorious are the splendid transactions which have marked and dignified thy eventful life! What American but must delight to trace the gradual steps, by which thou hast advanced to thy present, <HI>perhaps unparalleled, eminence!</HI> Viewed in the aggregate, or in detached instances, thy administration must furnish the bosom of every contem∣plative Columbian with immeasurable complacency! A glow of conscious exultation pervades reflection—thou art our countryman! we claim kindred with thy worth; and we derive a kind of respectability from this national affinity! Let us <HI>trace</HI> and <HI>retrace—the theme is rich—its interest to an American ear will still accumulate; and revolving ages will confess it inex∣haustible!</HI></P>

It was a happy moment, in which our venerable legislators hailed a Washington, as Commander in Chief of the forces of United America! Armed with the weapons of defence, and girding on the sword of power, his progress was astonishing, and his achieve∣ments truly important! Confusion fled at his ap∣proach; discipline ranged itself under his banners; order presided in his arrangements; and simple, un∣trained villagers became a regular army of brave, pa∣tient, and effective soldiers! The termination of the first campaign was worthy of the <HI>philanthropic soldier;</HI> and HUMANITY will record those dispositions, which reduced the British to the <HI>necessity</HI> of yielding up the metropolis of the State of Massachusetts, <HI>without the effusion of a single drop of blood,</HI> among the foremost of his deeds of worth. But every thing was to be ex∣pected from a Chief so amply endowed by nature, and who blended with the <HI>first abilities,</HI> that <HI>prudent caution</HI> so requisite in the catalogue of a <HI>soldier's virtues</HI>—who, while he was never <HI>arrogant</HI> or <HI>assuming,</HI> was, on every great occasion, <HI>nobly firm</HI> and <HI>becomingly dignified.</HI></P>
<P>The best principles of philosophy were early im∣planted in his bosom. His <HI>passions, all arranged by rea∣son, were kept in uniform subjection.</HI> He knew no party; and against the inroads of prejudice he erected the strongest barriers. He was incapable of illiberal views or conclusions; and his movements, ever dictated by a sound understanding and a well regulated judgment, were invariably marked by propriety. Accustomed accurately to investigate, he became familiar with both the <HI>probable</HI> and the <HI>possible.</HI> He understood the rela∣tive concurrence of events, and was, in a good degree, prepared for the consequences of the measures which he adopted. Always contemplative, his faculties were habituated to exercise; and hence his mind became invigorated and capacious, while he acquired the power of readily recognizing truth, and of embracing, in the midst of difficulties, the most salutary and extricating expedients. To this effect is the sketch, which those, who are the best informed, have given of the <HI>Hero of
<PB N="93" REF="034162_0759_0FFC53A119315740"/>
this new world;</HI> and the splendor of his career hath surpassed the highest strains of eulogy!</P>
<P>His reply to the annunciation of his appointment to the conspicuous and honorary station, to which the combining suffrages of his country had elevated him, while it is amiably ingenuous and truly noble, is also evincive of unassuming worth and interesting diffidence. Modesty is a gem, which, advantageously disposed, may sparkle becomingly, even among the assemblage of manly virtues; and it frequently diffuseth a lustre over the bravest exploits! Illustrious man! admira∣tion is tasked, when seeking to clothe, in language ad∣equate to their splendor, the matchless deeds which have marked a life so fraught with usefulness! It is not astonishing, that his election to office was unani∣mous—it is not surprising, that he was received, by all orders of people, with every demonstration of applause, nor, that the army, in particular, evinced their confi∣dence by the most unequivocal acclamations of joy.</P>
<P>Our theme is indeed richly copious; and we invite the reader to pursue it through the pages of the next Gleaner.</P>

<P>HOW prodigious must have been those talents, which were capable of conducting and effectu∣ating in a part of the country, to which the hero had been recently introduced, "within musket-shot of twenty British regiments, the disbanding of one army, and the enlistment of another!" But the path of this new star in the military hemisphere, seemeth to have been literally progressive.</P>
<P>All eyes were toward him; and every tongue was emboldened to express the various sentiments of an ex∣tensive and a fluctuating populace, which, ignorant that their army was, in many instances, destitute of
<PB N="94" REF="034162_0760_0FFC539BCBBB47D8"/>
arms and ammunition, presumptuously dictated meas∣ures that, if adopted, would have insured immediate destruction; and they ungratefully ascribed improper motives to the Commander of their forces, (who, from reasons of the soundest policy, concealed the distresses of his soldiers) because he did not rush to an instant, and probably fatal, decision!! But the Patriot War∣rior loved his country; and, <HI>more firm</HI> than the Roman Fabius, he disdained to submit, <HI>even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a day,</HI> to the ill-informed impetuosity of an imperious multitude. His reputation was at stake—but his mind was truly noble; and, with inherent magnanimity, while assur∣ed of his measures, he <HI>silently</HI> submitted to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tulent reflections of invidious and injudicious men! How indisputably did he merit those testimonials of appro∣bation, which marked his entrance into Boston! The voice of a <HI>rescued</HI> and <HI>gratulating</HI> people—Can strains more enchantingly sweet vibrate on the hero's ear? To be hailed as the DELIVERER of his distressed, and almost despairing fellow-citizens—What <HI>car-borne</HI> vic∣tor ever deserved or enjoyed a <HI>triumph</HI> more truly, more affectingly elevating! The general assembly of the Union applauded, and the concentrated voice of Massachusetts thus addressed him: "<HI>May you still go on, approved by Heaven, revered by all good men, and dreaded by these tyrants, who claim their fellow-men as their property.</HI>"</P>
<P>Thus wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d forward, he proceeded on, nobly per∣severing, amid circumstances of the most depressing aspect. Innumerable were the difficulties and hard∣ships with which he was condemned to struggle; alarming disappointments of many high-raised expec∣tations, general dejection, and an almost total defection of resources! What must have been the feelings of the <HI>Patriot Warrior,</HI> on the repeated desertions, so dis∣graceful to the American character, which, at some disastrous periods, were the events of every hour! How must he have agonized, while witnessing the uni∣versal gloom pourtrayed in the countenances of his reduced troops—"<HI>the militia departing in whole compa∣nies,
<PB N="95" REF="034162_0761_0FFC539A3926C0A8"/>
and their example infecting the regular regiments,</HI>" while subjected, by the necessity of retreating, to the most mortifying sensations, and forbid by prudence to exonerate himself from the defamatory remarks, originating in those inevitable movements! Yet, by that innate probity which ever maintained its regency in his bosom, he was once more rendered greatly su∣perior to the ills that encompassed him; and, confi∣dent that his line of conduct would best conduce to the accomplishment of that independence, at which America justly aimed, he calmly submitted to a mo∣mentary envelopment, anticipating the elucidating crisis, which, withdrawing the veil, would present causes and effects in their true point of view.</P>
<P>Cowardice, also, dared to produce among the ranks of freemen, its dastardly adherents!! O WASHING∣TON! what were the conflicts of thy heroic spirit, at that portentous era, when all thy rhetoric was em∣ployed in vain—when both thy example and thy au∣thority were ineffectual to the rallying those <HI>panic-struck men,</HI> who abandoned thee in thy utmost extremity!!! It cannot be matter of surprise, that, in a moment so tremendous, thou wert deserted by thy wonted sereni∣ty—that the calm region of thy bosom became unu∣sually tempested, and, that the hurricane within well near prostrated the barriers of reason.</P>
<P>This most interesting period of the American revo∣lution, and the effect of these calamitous events on the mind of her hero, is strikingly sketched by the histori∣an: "The General having embarked in the Ameri∣can cause <HI>from the purest principles,</HI> viewed, with infi∣nite concern, a behaviour so shameful! His soul was harrowed up with apprehensions, that his country would be conquered, her army disgraced, and her lib∣erties destroyed. He anticipated, in imagination, that the Americans would appear to posterity in the light of high-sounding boasters, who blustered when danger was at a distance, but shrunk at the shadow of opposi∣tion. Extensive confiscations, and numerous attain∣ders, presented themselves in full view to his agitated
<PB N="96" REF="034162_0762_0FFC5396EC7879C8"/>
mind. He saw, in imagination, new formed States, with the means of defence in their hands, and the glo∣rious prospect of liberty before them, levelled to the dust. Impressed with these ideas, he hazarded his per∣son, for some considerable time, in rear of his own men, and in front of the enemy, with his horse's head toward the latter, as if in expectation, that, by an honourable death, he might escape the infamy he dreaded from the dastardly conduct of troops, on whom he could place no dependence." To this hu∣miliating and dispiriting 15th of September, 1776, succeeded a train of calamities; for, although the dis∣mayed soldiers, in one gallant action, retrieved their military fame, misfortune, with baleful wing, still brooded over the American standard. Unutterable was the distress of the hero; and his embarrassments and regrets, when retreating with his few remaining followers, destitute and forlorn, without the means of procuring the indispensable necessaries of life, must have exceeded even the powers of conception! "Scarce an inhabitant of the towns through which he passed, could be induced to join his almost deserted standards, while he beheld numbers daily flocking to the royal army, to make their peace and obtain protection. When he contemplated on the one side, a numerous, well appointed, and full clad army, dazzling the eyes of the soldiers with the elegance of uniformity, and on the other, a few poor fellows meanly cloathed, sinking under the pressure of accumulated wants, and flying for their safety, what words can describe his <HI>augmented</HI> sufferings, as he thus witnessed the American army re∣linquishing its General—the people giving up the cause—some of the leaders going over to the enemy—and the British commanders succeeding in every en∣terprize!"</P>
<P>But the Genius of Columbia, and of Washington, at length arose triumphant! It suddenly pierced the dense clouds which had so long obscured its radiance! Trenton and Princeton first experienced its resuscitating influence—brilliant was its progress—and august the
<PB N="97" REF="034162_0763_0FFC539370785B10"/>
arrangement, which, in the most critical conjuncture, stationed the hero betwixt the contending parties! See! he marches on to death or victory! his exhorta∣tions and his example are now gloriously influential! The soldiers bravely follow, and incalculable advantages are obtained!—decisive consequences ensue—captivat∣ed towns are evacuated—the clouds are rapidly dis∣persing—and the <HI>sun of liberty,</HI> with genial influence, once more expands the tender buds of hope!—But, to descant upon the merits, the hardships, and the splendid and substantial services of a Washington, vol∣umes are insufficient!</P>
<P>Truly arduous was his task. "To preserve order," says the narrator of his actions, "and subordination, in an army of free republicans, even when well fed, clothed and paid, would have been a work of diffi∣culty—But to retain them in service, and restrain them with discipline, when destitute, not only of the comforts, but often of the necessaries, of life, requires address and abilities of such magnitude, as are rare∣ly found in human nature. In this choice of difficul∣ties, General Washington not only kept his army to∣gether, but conducted with so much discretion, as to command the approbation, both of the army and of the citizens."</P>
<P>Glorious meed! May the benign rays of gratitude, cherished through these emancipated States, ever gild the laurels which it entwines. Every true American, passing on from these success crowned scenes, will hail with pious rapture the memorable day which placed the Patriot Warrior at the head of these infant repub∣lics. Just such a Father—just such a Leader—just such a Guardian of our long contested rights, our ex∣igencies required. Grateful and upright retribution! happy unanimity!—thus did the hero merit—well had he earned the righteous tribute—and, in the an∣nals of America, the 30th of April, 1789, must ever be considered as a prominent epoch; for on that day, her beloved WASHINGTON received the investiture, which cloathed him with all the authority that FREE∣MEN COULD CONSENT TO DELEGATE.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="034162_0764_0FFC5391EA94FC58"/>
See where he stands! an object of the highest ven∣eration to his admiring countrymen—traits of affec∣tionate and respectful gratitude are impressed on every countenance—thousands are collected—all ranks and descriptions of people demonstrate the gladness of their hearts, by unequivocal marks of hilarity—a general joy is diffused—and every tongue proclaims the hero, as the FATHER, the DELIVERER, and the illustrious PROTECTOR of his country! And now the oaths of office are administered—Mark! what fervour of devo∣tion glows in his manly features, as he repeats the sol∣emn affirmation!—See! with what inimitably becom∣ing piety, he bends to kiss the sacred volume!—Hark! what a burst of applause succeeds—loud and repeated acclamations! Oh! may he long live to iterate a tri∣umph so august, an elevation so unparalleled!</P>
<P>A spectator has happily sketched the uncommonly interesting scene, and expressively delineated his conse∣quent feelings. "It seemed," says he, "from the number of witnesses, to be a solemn appeal to heaven and earth at once. Upon the subject of this great and good man, I may perhaps be an enthusiast; but I confess, I was under an awful and religious persuasion, that the Gracious Ruler of the universe was looking down at that moment, with peculiar complacency, on an act which, to a part of his creatures, was so very important. Under this impression, when the Chancel∣lor pronounced, in a very feeling manner, "Long live GEORGE WASHINGTON!" my sensibility was wound up to such a pitch, that I could do no more than wave my hat with the rest, without the power of joining in the repeated acclamations which rent the air!"</P>
<P>From that eventful era, what transcendent wisdom hath marked the regency of this illustrious, this <HI>time-honoured man!</HI> How accurately hath he distinguished merit! how deliberate are his counsels! how firm and impartial are his decisions! and how judicious are his rewards! While he is the patron of the good, he regards even the sons of sedition with lenity: Their progress over the western mountains, was marked by
<PB N="99" REF="034162_0765_0FFC538CB4256938"/>
the hero with such regrets as became a patriotic chief; yet, amid the impending storm, his equanimity re∣mained unruffled; with placid dignity he assumed that power, which, as a sacred deposit, he had accepted; while the angel pity presided at his deliberations, and sweet mercy pointed all those arguments which the heavenly pleader knew to urge. The poor delinquents were viewed with paternal tenderness, and humanity dropped a commiserating tear! Rectitude, however, asserted its prerogative, and the sword of justice was <HI>more than half unsheathed</HI>—This was enough—Dis∣cord, appalled, and shrinking from the awful face of offended government, sought shelter in oblivion; and the golden reign of order was again restored.</P>
<P>Thus honourable hath proved the military career! thus splendid is the path of the <HI>Patriot Warrior!</HI> Envy sickens at the view; but her pointed arrows have lost their murderous powers—the slanderous tongue of envenomed faction is either mute or ineffec∣tual—and through thy borders, blest Columbia! the healing voice of truth, peace, and unexampled pros∣perity, auspiciously reverberates.</P>

<P>IT is a melancholy truth, that the best minds, when outraged by injuries, and rendered callous by a se∣ries of unmerited misfortunes, too often become the
<PB N="100" REF="034162_0766_0FFC5815338C55B8"/>
receptacles of inflexible austerity. The virtuous phi∣lanthropist, urged by his ardent love of mankind, paints individuals agreeably to his sense of moral rectitude; he hath imaged in his mind a pleasing model, he de∣lineates the virtues which he conceives attainable, he is solicitous for the elevation of the human character; what he wishes, he considers as practicable; and, adopting an admeasurement of accomplishments that rarely ever exist, he is continually subjected to disap∣pointment, and that kind of disgust, which terminates in a cynical arrangement of those propensities that were originally replete with the best affections of which humanity is susceptible.</P>
<P>The little narrative, selected as the subject of this Gleaner, is a striking proof that misanthropy obtains its most rampant growth in the soil of virtue; that misfortunes are its manure, the impassioned sighs of anguish its genial atmosphere, and the torrents de∣scending on the cheek of woe its fertilizing showers.</P>
<P>Octavian was a youth, whose dawn of being au∣thorized the highest expectations; amid an assemblage of the most brilliant qualities, he possessed that endear∣ing benevolence and tenderness of disposition, which would become those attendant seraphs appointed to hover round the children of mortality. The young philanthropist was an enthusiast in his attachment to his species, and he was fond of believing their virtues inherent, and their vices the result of casualty or for∣eign agency. His education was truly judicious, and every year served to advance and to ameliorate those rare qualities that enriched his mind. His sensibility was extreme; and the ardour of a luxuriant fancy taught him to regard this globe as a paradise, and its inhabitants as administering spirits, ordained as aids to each other. Even reason seemed to quaff the intox∣icating draught; and as his fine understanding was embellished by a pleasingly prepossessing exterior, and the demise of his excellent parents had early made him the entire master of a very handsome property, persons were not wanting, who, by the exercise of cap∣tivating
<PB N="101" REF="034162_0767_0FFA66119B3A2760"/>
urbanity, contributed to heighten and to con∣tinue the sweet delusion.</P>
<P>Thus accomplished, and thus circumstanced, did the young Octavian commence the eventful career of life. Honour, highly wrought, and glowing with the most liberal purposes, was created the master spring of ev∣ery movement; while rich in conscious worth, and estimating persons and things by his own feelings, he seemed to tread enchanted ground, gaily anticipat∣ing more happiness than the calculation of experience would assign to a million of mortal lives. He looked around, and the wide extensive globe, with the blue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rene of heaven, alike conspired to swell his heart with ineffable rapture; his path was strewed with flowers; pleasures, laudable in their source, were the compan∣ions of his days; and from the far distant haunts, and situations the most barren, he industriously extracted a motive for complacency. Thus enchantingly the lu∣cid vision swam before him; suspicion slept in its cav∣erns; friendship assumed its most benign aspect; and love, garbed in all the captivating allurements of youth and beauty, unveiled before him its bewitching fea∣tures; the irresistibly commanding passions asserted their inborn vigour, and every faculty was engaged. Nature, when she attuned his heart to the refinements of amity, rendered him also capable of the tender pas∣sion in its utmost extreme, and its ungovernable emo∣tions and delicious tumults rushed forcibly on his per∣ception; a vision of halcyon days succeeded; freely he indulged the dream of fancy; and, without a single pause of discretion, he wedded the young, the gay, the beauteous <HI>Messalina,</HI> incautiously entwining those bands which were to ensure felicity, or to tinge with the blackest hues his future destiny!</P>
<P>But Octavian hesitated not to affirm, that he had attained the summit of bliss; and it must be confessed, the catalogue of his enjoyments was ample; virtuous, rich, sentimental, enamoured with the world, blest with a chosen friend, whom he conceived attached to him by every tie which the most cordial amity could
<PB N="102" REF="034162_0768_0FFA6618FA456778"/>
throw about the heart; and, to complete the picture, wedded to a female who had been followed by a crowd of candidates for her favour, who <HI>apparently</HI> returned his tenderness with equal ardours, and whose move∣ments seemed the result of discretion; was there a good which Octavian possessed not?—Once more he turned his admiring gaze, and the face of contentment gladdened his eye, while the voice of congratulation vibrated sweetly on his ear. He had been accustomed to embrace <HI>appearances</HI> as <HI>realities;</HI> and while benefi∣cence acquired new energy in his bosom, again he blessed the celestial countenance of humanity.</P>
<P>In this delirium some months rolled away; but the child of prosperity generally becomes a mark for the envenomed shafts of the invidious. <HI>Envy set on foot her machinations—injurious reports were whispered</HI>—the feel∣ings of Octavian were wounded, and the darts were urged by those on whose <HI>good offices he had fondly calculated.</HI> Friendship, truth and honour, he no longer supposes them the inmates of every bosom, and suspicion rankled in his breast. He traced the tale of scandal, and some <HI>oblique hints</HI> glanced on the faith of that <HI>early friend,</HI> whom, from the first dawn of reason, he had cherished as his life's rich treasure. For a moment he became petrified by the <HI>intimation,</HI> while horror aimed at his peace an icy dart. Alas! from that fatal period the dark passions were all unchained: Mistrust, assuming the ascendency, commenced its regency, and the obser∣vations of so indefatigable and eagle eyed a scrutator produced a conviction of the blackest perfidy. The discovery was, however, gradual; at first, prevarica∣tion, equivocal or hollow appearances of kindness, a manifest declination of wonted attentions, the ardours of attachment indisputably subsiding, the total dis∣appearance of those honest transports which had swell∣ed each glowing feature, estrangement succeeding, the silken bands of amity, "<HI>string after string,</HI>" by cold reserve, "<HI>were severed,</HI>" the habits of generous confidence gave place to icy distance, and the agoniz∣ing era at length presented, when insult, contemptu∣ous
<PB N="103" REF="034162_0769_0FFA664D5277E3D8"/>
disdain, and barbarous ridicule keenly pointed the perfidy, which thus beyond a doubt was demonstrated. The injuries Octavian had received were most atro∣cious; under the sacred name of friendship, the aban∣doned wretch whom he had trusted had seduced the too credulous Messalina! who, becoming an easy prey to the destroyer, imbibed with avidity his licentious principles; while abundantly more criminal than the well known Ninon de L'Enclose, (who broke no sol∣emn vows) her amours were notoriously multifarious, and caprice was ordained distributor of her guilty favours!!!</P>
<P>Poor Octavian! who but must weep his unmerited fate! <HI>The world, on which he leaned,</HI> has pierced him through with many sorrows; from what an eminence is he precipitated! how hath his golden dream of hap∣piness vanished! how agonizing is the void in his bos∣om! All else he might have borne—but to the over∣whelming force of a calamity so deeply aggravated, what Stoic fortitude could have remained inaccessible? In that tremendous hour, which gave indubitable con∣viction of the infidelity of the deluded Messalina, what conflicting emotions, what soul harrowing pas∣sions were concentrated! There, where his confiding heart had fondly trusted, where he had accumulated his best and dearest wishes! she, who was the object of his unbounded admiration, who he was positive united every thing which he believed of virtue, who was the universe to him!!—Suddenly conviction was forced upon him; the ties of love are rudely torn asunder, and the cup of felicity is dashed from his lips! Octavian saw himself alone in the world; an object of trust existed not; thick darkness enveloped his mind, and he sickened at the journey of life! Di∣vested of motive, the vigour of exertion expired, and the blandishments of hope were at an end. The con∣sequences were natural; for while retrospection was replete with all the anguish of regret, the pencil of fu∣turity was employed in sketching visions the most dark and comfortless; and the constant recurrence of
<PB N="104" REF="034162_0770_0FFA664FCC131080"/>
memory to those gaudy visions, which had so deeply imposed on the confiding morning of his existence, loudly proclaimed in the ear of his understanding, that suspicion, ever on duty, was the only guard he could oppose to the base treachery of deep, designing, artful man.</P>
<P>Thus those sentiments, formerly arranged by mild benignity, taking their hue from the most endearing sweetness of disposition, now arming against each oth∣er, produced a chaos in his breast; where bloomed the sweet flowers of complacency, there sprung the poisonous weeds of mistrust and bitterness of spirit; while those rich fervours which nerved the glowing purposes of benevolence, now miserably warped by disappointment, heightened the rancour of the misan∣thrope, pointed his implacability, and produced him the determined enemy of his species; and thus on the ruins of philanthropy were unfurled the misanthropic banners; gloomy malevolence raised high its ram∣parts, and war, inveterate war, was declared against humanity! His abhorrence of mankind hourly aug∣mented; nor did he assay to struggle with feelings which procured him a transient and savage relaxation from inquietude; but studiously cultivating the severest austerity of disposition, after procuring a divorce from the perfidious woman who had completed his ruin, he took refuge in the retired recesses of his own apartments, uniformly secluding himself from every inquirer.</P>
<P>It was at this period, that, urged by pity, and wish∣ing to point his views to that futurity, which is to dis∣tressed humanity truly consolatory, I often presented myself at his door; but although I petitioned in a supplicating tone for entrance, I could never gain ad∣mittance; and, trusting that reason, when time had ameliorated his deep regrets, would resume her saluta∣ry guidance in his bosom, I forbore to press upon his sorrows the continuance of a request altogether una∣vailing, and obviously considered as impertinent.</P>
<P>There were others, however, who, more persevering or more curious, forcibly passed those doors, which
<PB N="105" REF="034162_0771_0FFA667206804A98"/>
Octavian had determined to bar against every foot but that of one domestic, whose services the exigencies so intimately inwoven with existence rendered absolutely necessary. The unfortunate man received the intrud∣ers with inflexible resentment; and, accusing them of an unwarrantable violation of those privileges to which as a citizen he was entitled, he added, that he had looked for security within his own walls, but that he was fearful the globe could furnish no place of refuge against the inroads of an animal so savage as the human; and sternly insisting on their immediate de∣parture, he affirmed that if they continued their un∣welcome molestations, as he should be far from oppo∣sing himself to their united strength, he should be ne∣cessitated to commence the life of a wanderer, seeking some remote cavern, where he might hide himself from the hated visage of beings who excited his most abhor∣rent feelings, and from whom his full soul revolt∣ed!! Our gentlemen, abashed by a rebuff so uncom∣mon, and so determined, hastily retired. But Octa∣vian, suspecting that he should be subjected to their future encroachments, suddenly withdrew himself from their knowledge; becoming a voluntary exile from fortune, friends, and all those blooming hopes, which, in the gay metropolis where he received a being, had approached him in the most fascinating garb. Imme∣diately on his departure, a man of merit, who was his relation, took possession of his estates; from which the unhappy and still notoriously guilty Messalina receives an annual provision.</P>
<P>I have frequently conversed with the present posses∣sor of those estates; but his silence to every question relative to his kinsman, hath been firm and invariable; and I despaired of obtaining further information of the lost Octavian, until prosecuting some weeks since a journey which I was necessitated to make; in con∣sequence of an unavoidable detention, I was benighted in the midst of a road that I had seldom travelled; and a sudden and violent shower of rain, adding to the inconvenience of my situation, I hastened for
<PB N="106" REF="034162_0772_0FFA669BC6F55770"/>
shelter to a neighbouring wood, where I had not remained many moments, when a remote glimmering attracting my attention, my curiosity was irresistibly excited; and I determined to follow the clue which the light presented: Dismounting, therefore, and securing my horse, I made the best of my way over the roughest road I have ever passed; when, arriving at a small cottage, almost embosomed by a tall growth of trees, I knocked vehemently at the door; and the pelting rain at that moment so strongly enforced the propriety of my demand, that a reluctant entrance was cautiously granted: The door was opened by an old man, bent by a weight of years; and the wary hesitancy which marked his movements, contributed not a little to augment my surprise.</P>
<P>"<HI>It is a man, Sir,</HI>" in faultering accents, said he to a grotesque figure, who, with folded arms, occupied a corner of the hermitage. "<HI>Well, well,</HI>" returned the Recluse, in a tone of displeasure, "<HI>let him continue during the violence of the storm, but when that shall abate he must not delay his departure!</HI>" With an address the most insinuating I could assume, I approached the fe∣rocious master of this mysterious cell, who, catching a glance of my countenance, hastily endeavoured to con∣ceal himself from my observation. The expression of anguish which suddenly pervaded his features, was, however, but too evident; and under an assumed ac∣rimony, it was obvious that he harboured the most corroding glooms! His sorrows were contagious; my sympathetic feelings instantly confessed their power, and commiseration impelled an essay to alleviate his misfortunes. Summoning therefore all the rhetoric of which I was master, I proceeded to urge whatever I imagined might assuage the anguish of a mind strug∣gling with the ills of life. He heard me with a kind of sullen disdain, when, taking advantage of my first pause, and waving his hand with an emotion of de∣spair, to my great astonishment he replied, "<HI>I know you, Sir—I know you, Mr. Vigillius,</HI> from my boyish years I have known you; <HI>you are said to be a man of

virtue;</HI> but I am not to be deceived; my name is Oc∣tavian, Sir—the <HI>suffering, the betrayed Octavian; I was betrayed by virtue, Sir; hear this, and learn the necessity of your instant departure.</HI> I detest the affectation of rec∣titude—it is but a mask to conceal the blackest pur∣poses; but if you would still wear the semblance of integrity, I charge you to conceal the place where my wretchedness hath found an asylum. No one until now hath penetrated my retreat; my secret hath been lodged only in the bosom of this aged man, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he person who makes me the necessary remittances, <HI>whose interest it is to be faithful, as his possession of my prop∣erty depends on his silence.</HI>"</P>
<P>Had Octavian been fully aware of the alteration he had sustained, his secret might have remained in his own bosom: I should never have recognized him; that expression of divine benevolence, which mantled on his cheek, had given place to a deep and hollow countenance, the hue of which was become pallid and unpleasing; on his smooth and well turned forehead, grief had imprinted her furrowing characters; habit had bent his fine figure, while sorrow, anticipating the hand of time, had bleached his head, every hair was white, and his unrazored beard swept venerably on his bosom! If the stranger at first sight had strongly interested me, the early loved and long lamented Oc∣tavian now took full possession of every faculty of my soul; and, grasping his hand with a sudden exclama∣tion of pity and admiration, I pressed it alternately to my lips and to my bosom.</P>
<P>"<HI>No, Sir, I will not leave you;</HI> Providence has con∣ducted me to this cell, and nothing but violence shall turn me from the path to which our common Father hath directed me!" A transient acknowledgment of surprise escaped Octavian, at the energy of my words and manner; and, in defiance of his impassioned re∣monstrances, devoting the whole night to him, I la∣boured to awaken him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o those sympathies, which had so long remained prostrate in his bosom. I confessed that he had been the victim of a deep designing vil∣lain,
<PB N="108" REF="034162_0774_0FFA66F3040E5868"/>
associated with a perfidious woman; but his mind, I observed, had been too highly wrought, and his con∣fidence in mankind in the aggregate, imposing on his understanding, had blinded him to the necessity of in∣vestigation. I acknowledged that vice, in its most odious practices, was but too prevalent; yet I asserted that examples of generous rectitude were frequent in our world; and I held up to his view many instances, selected from the present day. Good and evil, it was notorious, alternately predominated; and it was a du∣ty, highly incumbent on minds fashioned like his, in∣stead of remaining sequestered amid the solitary wilds of nature, to occupy their understanding and their judgment in devising methods for the extirpation of crimes, and for the promoting and establishing the interests of virtue.</P>
<P>These were the themes on which I largely expatia∣ted; but, alas! my efforts effectuated not the desired purpose: And, while he affirmed that his hatred and detestation of his species were utterly insurmountable, the <HI>vehemence of his manner enforced a strong conviction of his sincerity.</HI> Repeatedly he implored me to leave him; but my persevering solicitude was not easily overcome; nor did I quit the cottage, until I obtained what I esteemed a capital concession, permission to repeat my visits. And should I be the fortunate instrument of restoring Octavian to the world, with all those social feelings with which the omnipotent hand of his Creator endowed him, I shall then possess at least one claim to the gratitude of mankind; and I shall, in such a pro∣pitious event, with honest exultation, again produce him an object worthy the attention and approbation of the most meritorious among my readers.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>To all the various grades that mark mankind,</L>
<L>Discriminating manners are assign'd:</L>
<L><HI>Propriety</HI> erects her decent bounds,</L>
<L>And every sense of real worth surrounds;</L>
<L>She points her land-marks, designates her lines,</L>
<L>Consorts with order, and with truth combines;</L>
<L>Each just distinction studiously preserves,</L>
<L>Nor from her radiant course one moment swerves.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is, undoubtedly, a beauty and a consist∣ency in uniform propriety, which is beyond the reach of those irregular flashes that are sometimes the production of caprice or chance; and we may as ra∣tionally rank the efforts of the Egyptian magicians in the same class with the divine mission and heaven sanctioned miracles of the Israelitish law-giver, as com∣pare an action, however <HI>beneficial in itself,</HI> which is merely the result of a momentary impulse, to that systematic virtue that is founded on the arrangements of reason, confirmed by habit, and matured by expe∣rience.</P>
<P>Propriety, said a friend of mine, is my deity—and if we must commence idolaters, I do not see that he could have chosen better: Nay, I will go further, and while I am beyond a doubt with respect to the <HI>only true</HI> object of adoration, I will hazard a question whether the <HI>self-existing</HI> First Cause may not, <HI>in fact,</HI> be wor∣shipped under the comprehensive term <HI>propriety?</HI> It is certain that every thing useful and becoming must proceed from the Author of every good; and, while we render homage to the Parent of the universe, it may not be essential whether we hail him as "<HI>Jehovah, Jove, or Lord.</HI>"</P>
<P>I am free to own, that I am wonderfully attached to this same Propriety; I would caress her as my bosom friend; she should be an attendant ever on duty; and I would constitute her the inseparable companion
<PB N="110" REF="034162_0776_0FFA68B6086B6540"/>
and guide of every moment of my existence. I have a set of nerves so whimsically consorted, that by a confusion of characters, unbecoming usurpations, and a gross departure from the lines evidently designated by nature, I am absolutely unhinged, plunged into a kind of melancholy, and rendered, for the time being, totally unfit for society. Indeed every violence done to order, is naturally succeeded by deformity; and it is undeniably true, that there are no arrangements so perfect, but may be essentially benefited by regularity.</P>
<P>Many an individual has passed a laborious existence in pursuit of an object he hath never obtained, merely because his efforts have been improperly directed. I know a lady, born and educated in one of the southern S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, in which she still continues to reside, who pos∣sesses talents sufficient to render her respectable, and in whose bosom a solicitude to please has been from in∣fancy the ruling passion: She is now far advanced in life; she is in possession of affluence; and she was ear∣ly wedded to a gentleman who concedes to her full power to consult, in every respect, her own taste: He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sons and daughters are all advantageously disposed of in wedlock; and she devotes her time and fortune to attempts at conciliating esteem; yet it is at this mo∣ment altogether problematical, whether this well mean∣ing old lady has the good fortune to please any indi∣vidual except her husband! How shall we account for a circumstance so adverse? We answer—she is not under the domination of propriety. It is evident she possesses great goodness of heart; her apartments are the resort of the rich, the young, and the gay; she is free of access to persons of every description, who can form the smallest pretensions to decency; her table is elegantly furnished; and her music, her wine, and her suppers, are the theme of many a tongue. Balls, card-parties, and morning collations—of these she is lib∣eral; and, as it is her choice to see company at home, she seldom subjects her guests to the expense of enter∣taining her in return. Her benefactions are numerous; she is ambitious of supplying even <HI>imaginary wants;</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="034162_0777_0FFA68B875384098"/>
and the ribbons and laces which ornament many of the younger part of her acquaintance, are the pro∣duction of her undistinguishing bounty.</P>
<P>Her life has been unoffending; I never learned that she was in any instance essentially culpable; and yet I have always heard her mentioned with contempt, and that kind of ridicule which has manifestly evinced that her whole plan of operations has been radically wrong. To instance—she mingles with every descrip∣tion of guests; and, although it is long since she hath passed her grand climacteric, she is still garbed in ha∣biliments so fantastically gaudy, that, was a girl of sixteen thus clad, she would inevitably draw upon herself the combined censures of prudence and of elegance. But it is not enough that she is reprehen∣sible in the choice of her apparel; her person, thus preposterously arrayed, is now seated at the card-table, and now placed at the head of the dancing party, grouped with girls and boys, who, while they soothe her by the most flattering encomiums, impatiently wait the opportunity of turning her into derision; she <HI>walks down the ranks;</HI> and, having unfortunately <HI>no ear for music,</HI> she is commonly out of time and place; and, in the same moment that she is thus ridiculous, she fancies herself the object of universal admiration!</P>
<P>Poor deluded lady, should thy eye ever glance over this page, let not its sincerity offend; trust me it is penned by one who is suitably impressed by a due re∣spect for thy virtues, and who has repeatedly combated in thy behalf. It is beyond a doubt, that thy solicitude to please is not only justifiable, but laudable; and the prime error in thy arrangements, hath been the ne∣glecting to engage that <HI>propriety</HI> which is a guide every way adequate to the conducting us through the most intricate paths. That thou hast missed thy goal, cir∣cumstanced as thou art, cannot be matter of wonder: We regret thy disappointment, and as we are in pos∣session of such documents concerning thee, as convince us that thy ruling passion is still strongly operative in thy bosom, we are happy that it is not yet too late to
<PB N="112" REF="034162_0778_0FFA68C590EEBF50"/>
sketch for thee a plan, which, if adopted, will infalli∣bly invest thee with that desideratum at which thou hast so long ineffectually aimed.</P>
<P>We will be careful to abridge thy pleasures as little as possible; and, as society may be requisite to cheer the winter of age, we will agree that thy extensive ac∣quaintance shall be the coevals of thy convenience. Of parties of pleasure, under the direction of amity and corrected hilarity, we decidedly approve. Music has been styled intellectual food; and dancing combines the advantages of exercise, with convivial enjoyment. But, although we unhesitatingly allow thy frequent as∣semblies, we cannot admire thy <HI>individual wanderings;</HI> thy smiles and thy presence may sanction youthful glee, while no <HI>antique movements absurdly point the ven∣erable appearance thou hast received from the hand of im∣pressive time.</HI> Dost thou want exercise, thy convenient carriages wait but thy command to waft thee to the charming recesses of the village groves; and all the rural pleasures of which the peaceful hamlet is produc∣tive, are at thy command. A celebrated writer in∣forms us that the polished sons and daughters of France always refuse to mingle in the dance, after they have passed the age of thirty. <HI>French etiquette</HI> has long been distinguished and observed; and I am free to own, that I admire the <HI>propriety</HI> of this reso∣lution.</P>
<P>There is, unquestionably, a period when the man∣ners of the human being ought to assume a dignity of character, when they cannot consistently nor graceful∣ly descend to frivolity; and we should be careful that we do not forfeit that respectability, which is the pre∣rogative of years. Observe the time-honoured matron who hath enlisted under the banners of <HI>propriety;</HI> her brow is not contracted by severity—she presides in the circles of gaiety, without casting a cloud on their en∣joyments—she mingles in the parties of the youthful candidates for pleasure; and those remarks which she is occasionally induced to make, drawn from the treas∣ury of wisdom, are calculated both to delight and in∣form.
<PB N="113" REF="034162_0779_0FFC5813AE36DB38"/>
Her sentiments are the growth of a good un∣derstanding, enriched by experience, and they are pointed by candour; she is regarded as a model, and beloved as a friend; her language is never adulatory; and yet she hastens to render that just tribute of praise which should be considered as the unalienable reward of merit. When she is under the necessity of pointing out a fault, the persuasive energy and conviction of her remarks, combine that kind of mildness, which is always sure to soothe, while they effectuate the reform∣ation they are designed to procure; her looks, her movements, her every arrangement, is descriptive of <HI>propriety;</HI> condescending dignity is inscribed on the features of her finely expressive countenance, and all who behold her are constrained to admire and to ven∣erate the truly <HI>consistent matron.</HI> By the benedictions of the young people of both sexes, she is constantly followed—they court her society with avidity, and re∣tire from her presence cheerful, grateful, and compar∣atively happy. In her gratuities she judiciously <HI>dis∣criminates,</HI> and she uniformly prefers aiding the efforts of the deserving orphan, who, by the assistance of her needle, is struggling to obtain a decent support, to the pleasure of adding a few yards of lace to the ornaments of her greatest favourites. Once I knew such a female; but alas! she is now no more—the big stream of una∣vailing sorrow marked her exit; the virtues clad in sables joined the funereal procession; <HI>propriety</HI> mourned the decease of the most unoffending of her votaries, while the regrets of all ranks of people were produc∣tive of a general lamentation. Sweet is the recollection of her life; and her memory, embalmed by her worth, will endure until the powers of retention shall be con∣signed to oblivion.</P>
<P>If those in whose bosoms a desire to please irresisti∣bly predominates, gave themselves time to reflect—if they would establish the regency of <HI>propriety,</HI> conviction would unavoidably follow, and they would then know that a regular and persevering conformity to her dic∣tates,
<PB N="114" REF="034162_0780_0FFC5810C4CE6C48"/>
is the only career, the unclouded splendor of which can effectually silence the clamours of rancour and the hootings of envy. The confounding different periods of time and destroying those discriminating marks which are calculated to designate characters, must always disgust; the man who would mount the breach, cloathed in canonicals, would be alike prepos∣terous with him who should ascend the pulpit, arrayed in a suit of full trimed regimentals! and the giggling Miss who has just completed her tenth year, habited in the gravely fancied garb, designed to enrobe the decent limbs of the venerable matron, is not more ridiculous than the woman of sixty, whose ill chosen ornaments an∣swer no other purpose than to render her an object of derision! The truth is, she thus excites attention to the years she hath numbered, forcibly pointing her longev∣ity by the very method she hath taken to conceal it! her gay apparel seems to multiply the furrows on her face, every unbecoming article apparently deepens her wrinkles, and renders still more hollow the hollow of her cheeks.</P>
<P>Custom has judiciously affixed to the various ranks in society its ascertaining marks, and we cannot see her barriers thrown down, or the rushing together of the different classes of mankind, without regret. Had I been born a female, it is very possible I might have con∣ducted as females do; but however this might have been, I think I could not have denied that the fantas∣tical trappings of dress are <HI>always</HI> indicative of a frivo∣lous mind. It must be confessed that plainness of ap∣parel is much more descriptive of dignity of character than embroidered vestments, furbelowed robes, or full dressed caps. Singularity of dress is a peculiar trait in the principles of quakerism, and the garb of this sect is calculated to give a rational impression of their tenets. The plain quaker-coloured sattin, neatly sewed togeth∣er, the milk white muslin or lawn, fashioned into the becoming handkerchief and well set colf—in short, the <HI>tout ensemble</HI> of the modest quaker's attire hath gene∣rally
<PB N="115" REF="034162_0781_0FFC580D77542B58"/>
extorted the most unequivocal testimonies of ap∣probation. A maiden thus clad prefers at first sight her claim to our esteem—we are not impelled to an ap∣preciation of the value of that time she hath murdered at her toilette—we have no useless appendages to calcu∣late, and we indulge a pleasing hope that she has devot∣ed her hours to the cultivation of her understanding.</P>
<P>I do not recollect ever to have heard a single gentle∣man expressing his sentiments on dress, who has not been decisive in his preference of the quaker habit. I know some men who are mute on almost every other subject, who, whenever this is introduced on the tapis, are even eloquent in the avowal of their admiration—and ladies of the best understanding have regularly giv∣en their voices on the same side of the question. How then does it happen that every description of women among us, quakers excepted, are ambitious of exhibit∣ing as much of show in their apparel, and of making as glittering an appearance as their ideas of the rules imposed by elegance and propriety will admit? This is an enigma reserved for THE SEX to explain; and in the mean time it may be presumed, that when the pe∣riod arrives which shall render it <HI>fashionable</HI> to accustom females to an early attention to <HI>useful studies,</HI> which shall teach them to reason, investigate, and compare, and to invigorate their understandings by a compre∣hension, and a consequent adoption of those arguments which result from sound sense, and are recognized by truth—when, I say, in the history of human nature, this period shall have displaced the administration of frivolity, I will pledge my reputation that their dress will become an object of less importance, that it will be remarkable for its simplicity, and that every ab∣surdity will be banished from the toilette.</P>

<P>I say, husband, there is straw enough; and you miss many a <HI>jonteel</HI> opportunity. Major Cam∣den for instance—he could not appear so <HI>alegunt</HI> with∣out a power of money. I warrant you, his trunks contain many a good pound; and, as he is in such haste to get rid of his cash, as to part with it to every shameless beggar, no one could say, it would not be doing a <HI>perlite</HI> thing, to assist him in the disposal of it.</P>

<STAGE>[Mr. Rambleton and Major Camden just rising from the breakfast table.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—I would travel many a rood to see this wonder of a man: I have never doubted his in∣trepid valour and inborn patriotism; but, are his mil∣itary talents so great as you describe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hold them to be unequalled, Sir. Hav∣ing the happiness to be born in the neighbourhood of Mount Vernon, I have enjoyed the patronage of the General, and I have been an eye-witness of the most glorious achievements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot you furnish me with some exam∣ples? I should dwell with singular pleasure on a re∣cital so interesting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fame early marked the steps of the youth∣ful Warrior; and his political address, undaunted bravery, and military talents, were all evinced in his journey from Winchester, his defence of Fort Necessi∣ty, and his judicious arrangements after Braddock's defeat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>His conduct would indeed have done hon∣our to a veteran.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="123" REF="034162_0789_0FFC57F0C7DDA430"/>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, Sir, were there no other proofs of his uncommon military abilities, but the victorious ac∣tions of Trenton and Princeton, (both of which were the result of his superintending genius) they were alone sufficient to place him on the highest summit of martial glory!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young man, I admire thy generous warmth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir! had you seen him in an hour of the greatest public depression—his noble bosom torn with apprehensions for his oppressed country—hazard∣ing his person in front of the enemy's line—animating his followers by example, as well as precept—and, with intrepid valour, pressing on <HI>to death or victory!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>May eternal blessings crown his honoured head!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Various are the scenes which have wit∣nessed his undaunted bravery; while his unyielding fortitude and equanimity, under the pressure of com∣plicated evils, authorize the most elevated ideas of the firmness and magnanimity of his mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is hardly possible to reverence his virtues too highly; and yet, the ignominious death of Major Andre has taught some people to question his sen∣sibility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gracious God! Had they witnessed the struggles, which the fate of that interesting, brave, and truly accomplished man occasioned in the bosom of the Warrior, they would have learned to venerate the sorrows of a martial spirit. But, Sir, there are periods, when <HI>sacrifices on the altar of public opinion be∣come absolutely indispensable.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly there are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Question his sensibility, Sir! he deeply laments the calamities of the war! and, while his soul bleeds for his country, the delicacy of his feelings ac∣knowledges a suitable sympathy with the unfortunate of every description.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>This finishing of his character gives me in∣expressible satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="124" REF="034162_0790_0FFC57EF41AEFC08"/>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I glory in my country, Sir; and, while I do reverence to Warriors, Philosophers and States∣men, whose fame shall reach the utmost verge of pol∣ished humanity, I forget not to estimate, as they de∣serve, the merits of those matchless soldiers, whose hardships have been incredible—who have withstood the most splendid offers of the enemy, when, at the same moment, their footsteps over the frozen ground were tracked by their blood!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heroic men! they merit more than lan∣guage can express! How long have you served in this unequalled army, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father had designed me for mercan∣tile life; but, on the commencement of hostilities, he received letters from a friend abroad, which determined him to arm me in my country's cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ramb.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Little does he suspect the hand which penned those letters; but, though my bounding heart would leap into his bosom, I will not yet disclose myself.</HI> <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> To bear arms in defence of the invaded Rights of Man, is truly honourable, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, Sir; and many brave citizens have lately joined our standards. Some hours hence, the noble volunteers will rendezvous on that parade where first we met: Should your curiosity lead you thither, you may observe a specimen of that spirit which actuates the bosoms of FREE AMERICANS!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I will not lose the opportunity, Sir.</P>
</SP>

<P>MISFORTUNE upon misfortune!

</SP>
<STAGE>[Enter Harriot Montague.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Emily, where have you hid yourself; why I have had the most divine ramble imaginable, and have been searching the house over to make you a partaker of my felicity; but tell me, dear, has not this straw hat and lilach ribbons a most fascinating effect? O I have been so enchantingly flattered—But I protest you look as if you had been in tears! you are melancholy, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Harriot, not melancholy, only tranquil; but where have you been, my love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Been! why, you shall hear: I just looked in on Mrs. Fallacy, and found her exercising her talents at ridicule, by describing to neighbour Chit∣chat in a manner truly ludicrous, the party she last night entertained, in such a high style of elegance, and with such apparent affection—Ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And could this give you pleasure, Harriot? it has, I assure you, a contrary effect on me; <HI>I shall henceforth, never enjoy myself in her society.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never enjoy yourself in her society, Emily? why she is the most <HI>sprightly and agreeable woman in the world.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so, <HI>but I should be confident that I, in my turn, should be served up as the subject of her unwar∣rantable mirth:</HI> And, indeed, Harriot it is an eternal truth, <HI>that whoever will divert you at the expense of any one with whom they are apparently in the habits of friend∣ship, will not hesitate to sacrifice you, whenever occasion offers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, this may do well enough for you plodding, sentimental girls; but I, who resolve to enjoy the present moment, am determined to laugh where I can, and not be so grossly absurd as to throw myself into the horrors by anticipated evil—ha, ha, ha! laughing, my dear, is absolutely necessary to my exist∣ence—ha, ha, ha.</P>

<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a happy girl, cousin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so I think, Emily; for who should I meet at Mrs. Fallacy's but Miss Worthy, Arrabella Clermont, and Eliza Meanwell; so, gallanted by Al∣berto Stanhope, away we scampered, and had the most delectably romantic promenade that can be conceiv∣ed of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had <HI>Major Camden</HI> been of the party, the pleasure you seem to have derived therefrom, might have been accounted for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>For pity's sake, Emily, be quiet, or you will absolutely make me as melancholy as yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will the name of Major Camden make you melancholy, cousin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, it is a perfect antidote to every mirthful idea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing! I had thought you regarded him as your future husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>So mamma would have me, Emily; but if ever I do marry, child, it will be a distant day; and I pray Heaven that Major Camden may not be the man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can be your objection to Major Camden? he is young, rich, handsome, gay, generous, informed, and polished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! Emily—why, you have given him qualities enough for a line of high sounding Alex∣andrine measure; and, if you had but arranged them musically, I should have set you down as a most ex∣cellent poet: Could you not transpose them, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>How agreeably a heart at ease can trifle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, my dear girl, seriously, and in your own way, I allow Major Camden every attribute which you have so liberally bestowed upon him: I sincerely esteem him; but for love, <STAGE>[courtesying humour∣ously]</STAGE> I must beg your pardon for that, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is my aunt acquainted with your sentiments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, child, I do not <HI>often</HI> keep <HI>secrets</HI> from my mother; she has the most contemptible idea of love—but <HI>entre nous</HI>—I believe she has been cruelly
<PB N="128" REF="034162_0794_0FFC57E3A06361C0"/>
wounded by the little archer; this, however, is conjec∣ture; for there is a mystery in the story of my good mother, which, although my curiosity is wound up to the highest pitch, I could never yet unravel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is strange she should wish you to enter into engagements at which your heart relucts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not more strange than true, Emily. Major Camden commenced his acquaintance with my mother by saving her from imminent danger: She was taking an airing on a very rough road—her hor∣ses took fright—the driver was thrown from his seat—a precipice was in view—and her destruction had been inevitable, had not Providence sent Camden to her assistance, who saved her life at the risque of his own!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shudder at her danger! It was indeed an heroic action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gratitude of my mother was un∣bounded; mine also was powerfully engaged—for a time it deceived me: Camden declared himself my lover; but although I have long since understood the situation of my own heart, I am not permitted to deal explicitly with Major Camden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>But on what principle can my aunt proceed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has a most exalted opinion of Major Camden—tenderly loves her daughter—and thinks the passions should always be under the government of reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigh ho!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>And heigh ho! say I—but, hang it, your glooms are contagious, I believe: I'll never stir a single step in pursuit of cross accidents, I'm resolv'd: <STAGE>[hums a tune.]</STAGE> "The world, my dear Mira, is full of deceit." <STAGE>[Swims gracefully in a minute; strikes sudden∣ly into a cotillion step; and warbles a gay air.]</STAGE></P>

<P>Amiable vivacity!</P>

<P>Well, husband, do you give information in∣stantly; and, as soon as his toryship is secured, you shall take this picture to the jeweller's, and pretend that it belonged to one of the rich relations, of which you have so often boasted, and that you are obliged to part with it; and thus we shall find money to supply ourselves with cloaks, masks, &amp;c. &amp;c. in which we shall be so disguised, that our own natural-born fathers would not know us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. V.</SPEAKER>
<P>What ails you, husband?—the goods of a tory are free plunder!—why, we are doing the <HI>most handsomest</HI> thing in the world; and, as we shall not break the trunks until the last moment, we are perfect∣ly secure.

<STAGE>[Alberto Stanhope and Harriot Montague are discovered, sitting on the turfed seats, and engaged in close conver∣sation.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Alberto, I can only repeat, that I do most sincerely regret this clandestine intercourse; in compliance with your importunities, I have given you this meeting. The world considers me as a gay, unthinking girl; yet I have my moments of reflec∣tion. My preference of you I will not deny; but the, if possible, <HI>augmented indulgence</HI> of my mother, hath
<PB N="141" REF="034162_0807_0FFC57BAEB4AA440"/>
roused to action every proper sentiment, and the high∣est sense of the duty which I owe her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alberto.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, Harriot, your heart now decides in favour of Camden! but let him take care—</P>
<STAGE>[They rise.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, pshaw! Stanhope, this is exactly in his style. <STAGE>[Throws herself into a fencing attitude.]</STAGE> Yet, don't put yourself in a passion, man; for I pro∣test, I begin to think he has absolutely thrown off his allegiance, and that he is, at this very moment, fo∣menting a rebellion against his sovereign lady!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alberto.</SPEAKER>
<P>What means my Harriot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>entre nous,</HI> I suspect he has conceiv∣ed a most violent <HI>penchant</HI> for Emily Lovegrove.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alberto.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven grant it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be delectable! they would make the most charming sentimental pair in the world! and I take every opportunity of leaving them togeth∣er, not doubting but their <HI>private interviews</HI> will won∣derfully increase their <HI>tendresse.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alberto.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does my Harriot draw this conclusion from her own experience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Striking the powder out of his hair with her fan.]</STAGE>
<P>Yes, villain; and hence she resolves to make no more assignations.</P>

<P>But what are we to do, my angel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do! why, sit down, like the babes in the wood, and cry ourselves to sleep, and see what little robin red-breast will prepare our leafy covering.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alberto.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee, do not thus trifle with my feel∣ings—You have forbid my application to your mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I knew it would be ineffectual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alberto.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Again taking her hand.]</STAGE>
<P>In the name of Heaven, how shall I proceed? Shall I engage my fa∣ther to intercede for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ah! these managing people under∣stand each other best; and it is as well to proceed in the good old fashion way: <STAGE>[looks at her watch.]</STAGE> But it

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Emily, where is Harriot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell, Madam; but she is fond of walking, and, I suppose, is improving this fine day, by indulging in her favourite exercise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Emily, young people generally understand each other. There was a time, when I conceived the heart of my girl entirely devoted to Major Camden; but she has of late given me reason to regard her at∣tachment as problematical. Am I to impute this ap∣parent change to caprice, or to a growing disgust?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Confused and hesitating.]</STAGE>
<P>Why, really, Mad∣am, it is not for me to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your <HI>looks,</HI> Emily, and your <HI>manner,</HI> con∣vince me that you <HI>could</HI> say a great deal! I am engag∣ed in gratitude, in honour, to Major Camden—my promise is irrevocable. I had the full consent of Har∣riot; and the world expects their speedy union. Tell me, Emily, if you know aught which can militate against my plans?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Trembling and blushing excessively.]</STAGE>
<P>Pray, Madam, excuse me! pray do!</P>

<P>What a fortunate relief! <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harriot, where have you been rambling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Rambling, sure enough, mamma!</HI> why, half the town over; and I am so delightfully fatigued—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my love, take off your scarf, and let us have a little serious chit-chat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I your leave to retire, Madam?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="143" REF="034162_0809_0FFC57B199B52958"/>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>To love him, mamma!</HI> why, that is a busi∣ness I have never yet begun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Harriot, I am serious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, mamma, seriously, although I esteem Major Camden, I can never marry him; for I can never <HI>love him, mamma.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you <HI>esteem him, my dear, it is sufficient.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>God bless you, Madam! you would not surely insist that my hand should be a solitary gift?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> my dear, is a <HI>chimera,</HI> which has undone your mother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>For your advantage, Harriot, I will sketch some particulars of my life, which I had intended to keep forever from your knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please, mamma.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I married your father, although I regarded him as the first of men, yet I felt not for him <HI>what is called, love.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[archly.]</STAGE>
<P>And was you <HI>very happy</HI> with my father, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, Harriot. I engaged in a round of dissipation—I continued the most cen∣surable pursuits; and at length <HI>imagined</HI> myself ten∣derly attached to a person, who was every way the <HI>inferior of</HI> your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your father continued his forbearance, until convinced, by circumstances, that he had a rival in my affections! when, leaving me at our country seat, without a single remonstrance, and taking with him your brother, then only four years old, he depart∣ed for this city, leading me to expect he would return with the coming day! <STAGE>[weeps.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, proceed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were then but two months old: The first post brought me a letter, in which he inform∣ed me, that, as he was convinced I was unalterably attached to another, he should bid me an eternal
<PB N="144" REF="034162_0810_0FFC57B00D606870"/>
adieu!—that he took with him our son, as the only solace of his exile—that he left me the uninterrupted possession of his town and country house, with a suffi∣cient income to support myself and daughter—and he concluded by wishing me, with the man of my heart, all that felicity on which he supposed my fond imagi∣nation had calculated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>For God's sake, Madam, proceed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came immediately to town; but he had embarked on board a ship, bound to some part of Europe! From season to season, for a long time, I encouraged hope; but, although nineteen years have since revolved, not a single syllable, either respecting himself or my son, hath ever blest my ears!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gracious Heaven! both my father and my brother may be yet alive!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! No—I feel it is impossible! my wounds bleed afresh at this recital! they have long since bid adieu to a world, to which I am chained a miserable captive! <STAGE>[weeps agonizedly.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forbear! best of mothers! forbear these tears. Surely, surely, your experience does not decide in favour of an Hymen unblest by love!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Observe me, girl; although I was indis∣creet, I was never criminal; and the moment of your father's departure convinced me of my error—<HI>the charm was broke</HI>—<HI>I detested the author of my sufferings</HI>—<HI>I never after saw him;</HI> and, to my great satisfaction, I learned that he immediately quitted the continent. I dwelt with unutterable admiration on your father's virtues; and had I possessed worlds, I would have parted with them all to have purchased his return!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Madam, your story is indeed instruc∣tive: But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what, my love?—I am indebted to Major Camden for my life—you have received him with approbation—he is every way worthy; and, next to yourself, Harriot, he is now the dearest object of my affections!—But alas! my love, you are ill—
<PB N="145" REF="034162_0811_0FFC57AE837C1318"/>
my woe-fraught narrative has been too oppressive! Heaven guard my child! Let me lead you to your chamber.</P>

<P>O dear, Sir!</P>

<P>Yes you do, yes you do; and if I was twenty years younger, Madam, I do assure you I should feel strongly inclined to strike about myself.</P>

<P>Strike about, Sir!</P>

<P>Yes, widow, I would make my bow, squeeze your ladyship's hand, whisper soft things in your ear, hint indirectly at marriage, and publish the bans in less time than you could finish your wedding cap.</P>

<P>You are disposed to be pleasant, Sir! but as this is a subject on which I never jest, I beg leave to say, that had you the faculty of renewing your youth, and were to advance with the most serious pro∣posals, I should not hesitate in putting my negative thereon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stanh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Well I profess this is somewhat surprising! but mayhap I am not to your taste; do you not hold matrimony to be a musical<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Musical,</HI> a term used in many of the interior parts of the New-England States, to express every thing convenient, excellent or elegant: thus, they say a musical horse, day, garment, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> thing.</P>

<SPEAKER>Stanh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, my son has taken a violent fancy to a good handsome young woman of whom you have the disposal. I perfectly approve his choice, and have waited on you to endeavour to obtain your consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can my niece have made a conquest of such importance already? <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE> Why, Sir, the young woman you mention is calculated, both in mind and person, to command affection as well as esteem; had her father lived, her consequence would doubtless have been augmented; but I shall make every effort in my power, which I can suppose will be for her advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stanh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, she cannot stand in need of proper aid, under your care.</P>

<P>Sir, if your son can render the young lady propitious, he shall have my best wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stanh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I was made to believe that you were not favourably inclined in this affair, but the best are liable to mistakes; you have done me a very par∣ticular kindness, Madam; Alberto will run mad with joy! and I will make all possible dispatch to inform him of his happiness. Sweet lady, I take my leave, and shall ever be your most obedient humble servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, your most obedient. <STAGE>[Exit Stanhope.]</STAGE> Quite a whimsical old gentleman, on my word; his way of thinking, too, is rather singular, for Emily's fortune is a mere trifle, and Alberto, accomplished as he is, might form the most aspiring expectations. I will take the earliest opportunity of sounding my niece, and govern myself by her wishes.</P>

<P>Why child, a single scribbler, scratching his malicious noddle, may fabricate his abuse, and the cynic has only to preface his invidious production by the little comprehensive monosyllable <HI>we</HI> think and <HI>we</HI> wish, while he thus hands my name to thousands, who would not otherwise have known <HI>that I had an existence.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Harriot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Emily; but their <HI>curiosity</HI> would be called into action—it would impel them to <HI>inquire;</HI> I should come out an <HI>innocent sufferer,</HI> be allowed <HI>my full share of merit,</HI> and acquire a <HI>prodigious deal of consequence;</HI> ha! ha! ha!

<P>Then you would be very irrational, my dear, for envy is a powerful stimulus to the mi∣santhropic mind, and <HI>merit is ever the mark at which it aims its most envenomed shafts.</HI> But we have strange∣ly wandered from our subject—I am positive, Emily, that my friend Camden is not indifferent to you.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE passed one of those days, that, on sober reflection, I would gladly reiterate. The morning rose delightfully serene; and, having offered at the shrine of Deity our early orisons, I proposed to Mary a visit to our children; an enchanting little jaunt produced us at Hamilton Place. Edward met us with customary expressions of kindness, and Marga∣retta with those demonstrations of affection that have ever marked her conduct. We passed some delightful moments amid the captivating endearments of the little William and his sisters, and their society operated as the sweetest solace to our minds. On the entrance of less interested friends, we were, however, constrained to dismiss the lovely prattlers; and, bestowing on them the benediction of affection, we committed them to the care of a faithful woman, to whom Margaretta, when <HI>unavoidably engaged,</HI> is in the habit of entrusting them.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="034162_0830_0FFC576FDDD2CFB8"/>
The commencement of the conversation, after the children had retired, took a turn extremely adverse to my wishes—<HI>British enormities,</HI> and <HI>British ingratitude</HI> was the theme; and I, who spontaneously shrink from instances of <HI>human depravity,</HI> naturally turned with disgust from the subject. It is true I am a Gleaner; but, I am, nevertheless, at a world of pains to winnow my multifarious collections; and I must be fully con∣vinced of their utility, before I can consent that the bitter ingredients should obtain the ascendency even in a single essay. Fortunately for me, the course of those observations, which were issuing with a sufficient quantum of acrimony, was unexpectedly arrested, and conducted into an opposite channel, by the interference of a young gentleman, a Captain L—, whom I have long regarded with no small complacency: The seeds of every virtue are implanted in his breast; but conceiving an aversion from the <HI>ostentious parade</HI> of excellence, he hath, I have imagined, embraced a contrary extreme; and his fine qualities, are, conse∣quently, veiled by appearances, which the superficial regard as expressive of propensities directly opposite to those that are paramount in his bosom. Young as he is, he seems precisely to have estimated the value of the human character; the man of <HI>real virtue</HI> will ever find him warmly attached to his interest; and he is sincerely beloved by every one to whom he is <HI>fully known.</HI> All the energies of his soul have to-day been called into action; and his fine eyes, sparkling with even more than their wonted lustre, while he plead the cause of truth, evinced the <HI>kindred virtues</HI> which are inherent in his bosom.</P>
<P>He introduced his testimony by observing it was very probable the Britons might, in many instances, have been offenders, but that his own experience was an exception to clamours, which he imagined were far too general; and he proceeded to inform us, that, having taken the command of a ship, he had crossed the Atlantic with all the prejudices of an American; that, with the pride of a young man enthusiastically
<PB N="165" REF="034162_0831_0FFC576E3A64E5F8"/>
devoted to his country, he had anchored in the river Thames; that he went on shore prepared to repel insults, and with a high sense of the haughtiness and ingratitude of the English nation. Circumstances, however, soon produced a pleasing revolution in his mind; the disposal of a large and various cargo, in∣troduced him to different descriptions of people, all of whom he found easy of access, and fair and open in their dealings. The knowledge that he was an American, seemed to augment his consequence; and every one appearing eager to serve him, he was led to wonder whither the arrogance and reserve attrib∣uted to those Islanders had vanished. Retiring to his ship, he was indulging a reverie on this subject, when an unknown voice, observing to one of the ship-mates, who was lighting him into the great cabin, that he had but recently heard the name of the commander, arrested his attention; he had scarce time to form a conjecture, ere the stranger presented himself before him.</P>
<P>"Your name, Sir, I am informed, is L—; but information is superfluous; your features have taken too great hold on my mind ever to be erased there∣from."—The stranger advanced with open arms—The American stood collected—"You have the ad∣vantage of me, Sir; I have not the pleasure of know∣ing you."—"Probably not, Sir; and yet I have often clasped you to my bosom; you used to be ambitious of a place on my knee; and your innocent remarks have amused me, during some very gloomy hours. My name is P—. I was captured by Captain N—, commander of the ship S—▪ a man, <HI>in whose bosom true nobility seemed inherent.</HI> I have said a thou∣sand times, that his spirit was too big for his body; and when, after my return home, I put to sea again, one of my leading motives for wishing to make a prize of Captain N—, was, that I might be furnished with an opportunity of emulating his acts of generosity. But in your father's house, Sir, I found even a pater∣nal home. God bless the honoured man—Does he
<PB N="166" REF="034162_0832_0FFC57696BC9F9E8"/>
still live? If he does, the wandering sufferer may yet obtain a friend and father, who is not only an honour to the American name, but to humanity at large."</P>
<P>Captain L—, it will not be doubted, received a man so deeply impressed with the virtues of his father, and on whose bosom the <HI>laws of gratitude</HI> seemed im∣printed, with the requisite attention. The grateful Briton would have conducted him immediately to his house; he entreated him to take up his quarters there; and, although pained by a refusal, his frequent invita∣tions, while he continued on the river, hardly left him an unappropriated day. Captain P—quitting his employ on the ocean, had entered into a line of business which empowered him to supply the naviga∣tor with many articles of which he was in want; and the American commander, with a view of giving him the preference, made continual application to his warehouse: But occupied, previous to his departure, in closing his accounts, he commissioned the person whom he had employed to discharge the debts he had contracted, to wait on his hospitable friend for his bill; when, to his great astonishment, he was informed that he had no pecuniary demands upon him. He imme∣diately hastened to the compting-house of the merchant.—"What can you mean, Sir, by the message I have just received? Am I not indebted to you for articles to a considerable amount?"</P>
<P>"No, indeed, Sir," returned the <HI>sea disciplined veteran,</HI> while an honest tear glittered in his eye—"<HI>Your father has rendered it impossible for you to become my debtor!!</HI> I wish to God the articles to which you refer, were of greater value. Commend me to the good man to whom you are returning; and if you are not disposed to affront a brother Sailor, you will mention this affair no more." This was sufficient; our young gentleman was necessitated to <HI>defer the day of retribution.</HI> They drank together a parting bottle; and he hoisted sail with far other ideas of English men and manners than those with which he had cast anchor.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="034162_0833_0FFC5767E96ADC08"/>
While Captain L—was concluding his recital, we were joined by Seymour and his Serafina, who had recently returned from an excursion into the State of Vermont; and they related a little narrative alto∣gether in point; for the <HI>authenticity of which the Gleaner pledges his veracity.</HI></P>
<P>Captain A—, a British officer of family and for∣tune, was one of the many brave men, who, induced by a sense of duty to their sovereign, or erroneous ideas of the cause in which they engaged, armed and embodied themselves for the purpose of exterminating from this new world all opposition to the mandates of a government, usurping an unwarrantable sovereignty, and peremptorily insisting on the power of binding, in all cases whatsoever, a people separated from them by the broad Atlantic, and who had never been repre∣sented in their national or legally constituted assemblies.</P>
<P>Captain A—shared the fate of many of his associates in the war; and after a number of marches and counter-marches, he was reduced to the necessity of surrendering to those undisciplined men, whom he had hardly deigned to consider as soldiers. He was committed to the care of a Major B—, then station∣ed in a metropolis, well known in the commercial world; this officer, from the dawn of the revolution, had glowed with a holy zeal in his country's cause; he was foremost in those ranks who distinguished themselves in defence of that liberty, for which such countless heroes fought and bled; and in addition to the rank of Major, he was invested with that of Com∣missary of Prisoners. Captain A—received every indulgence of which his situation was susceptible; the Commissary knew how to appreciate his virtues, nor was any effort left unassayed, which it was imagined might render his captivity easy. Love, all potent love, seconded these benign arrangements, and the brave, the humane soldier was in every view a con∣quered man; but he was received by the lovely subdu∣er of his heart with enchanting lenity; honour was regent in her bosom, frankness dwelt on her lips, and
<PB N="168" REF="034162_0834_0FFC576173A3B618"/>
she intuitively felt that she might confide. The pa∣rental sanction awarded her election; the holy priest received their vows; and to a heart so faithfully de∣voted, the bonds of captivity became indeed silken.</P>
<P>Thus blest by friendship and by love, it cannot be matter of astonishment, that a strong predilection in favour of America triumphed in his bosom; nor that he was with the foremost in offering up his ardent vows for the success of her battling chiefs. It is true, when the final adjustment of the preliminaries of peace left the prisoner at liberty to return to his na∣tive country, that, accompanied by his Honora, he departed with the rest; but he departed with a de∣termined resolution to return as soon as the posture of his affairs would permit; and on his arrival in Eng∣land, he was so indefatigable in procuring those ar∣rangements, which were necessary to the sale both of his patrimonial and acquired estates, that he very speedily re-embarked for this new world. His voyage was prosperous, and he arrived here, flushed with the most pleasing expectations.</P>
<P>Dispatch necessarily attends the transactions of an active and an ardent mind, and but a short period elapsed, ere he possessed himself of a large tract of most excellent land in the Genessee country, where, taking his stand, he conceived the laudable resolution of col∣lecting round him as many industrious, well disposed and sober citizens, as should feel a freedom to embrace plans, which combined as their object, not only his own emolument, but the advancement of the country of his adoption, and of all those individuals who might be disposed to adopt his views. It is hardly possible to conceive of a situation more pleasingly elevated than that of bestowing protection, with the means of competency, and observing in return the spontaneous fruits of gratitude. Yet Captain A—was but half blest; for his most diligent researches could discover no vestige of the friend, who in the night of adversity had illumined, by his beneficent interposition, the thick darkness by which he was surrounded.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="034162_0835_0FFC575FD944AC78"/>
Major B—, from the era which disbanded the American army, had been involved in a series of mis∣fortunes! Generous, perhaps to an extreme, and emi∣nently humane, the necessities of his dependents were, <HI>in effect</HI> his own; he was wedded to a woman, lovely in her person, and superior in her mind; his infant train, even in the estimation of a disinterested observer, were highly promising, and the care of an ancient and widowed mother devolved solely on him. No pecu∣niary reward awaited his services; his pay had never exceeded his expenditures; and the close of the war consigned him to penury.</P>
<P>Would that his fate exhibited a solitary instance! Oh, America, America! where is the harvest which thou hast treasured for thy war-worn chiefs? Is pov∣erty the wreath which thou reservest for the brow of thy soldiers? When will my country be fully exon∣erated from the charge of ingratitude? When will she assign to deeds of worth a suitable and adequate compensation?</P>
<P>Major B—possessed an undaunted spirit, and, with a view of warding off the impending evil, he had tak∣en up sums of money, expecting that, by some propi∣tious adventure, he should be able to extricate himself from his embarrassments. Hope was warm in his bosom, and he was sanguine enough to imagine he should be able to discharge the last farthing of his arrearages; but all his enterprises failed; the waves of misfortune swiftly succeeded each other; an arrest terminated his career, and he was immured within the comfortless walls of a prison. That he should long remain in durance was, however, improbable; every sentiment of humanity embodied for his release, and his known integrity and irreproachable character pro∣cured his enlargement▪ Yet he was thrown pennyless on an unfeeling world; and the consequent situation of those beloved claimants, who possessed the dearest right to his aid, produced sorrows which harrowed up his soul; reason tottered on her throne, and he was driven to the verge of desperation.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="034162_0836_0FFC575E55CF0DB8"/>
Reflection, however, at length produced a melan∣choly calm; the storm of the passions subsided; and, resolving to retire far from the knowledge of those with whom he had once associated, he took shelter on the extreme verge of a newly located township, in the State of Massachusetts, bordering on that of Vermont. Here, despoiled of every other resource, and sinking under a weight of calamity, his health impaired and his spirits broken, the brave, the benevolent officer, with a wife who would have added new lustre to a diadem, with a lovely and interesting family of children, and an aged mother—here, in this desolate spot, renting a small house on the country road, and putting up a bill for entertainment, he depended for his subsistence on the necessities and caprices of the passing traveller; while the scanty pittance he thus obtained, was attend∣ed with such a variety of humiliating circumstances, as to render the burden of life almost insupportable!</P>
<P>It was on a fine evening in June, just as the parting rays of the sun had darted his setting beams on the west∣ern mountains, that this meritorious sufferer indulged his corroding melancholy at the door of his cottage. Sorrow had well nigh obliterated from his memory all traces of Captain A—, and he remained in entire ig∣norance of his return to America. A superb phaeton appeared in the road, and, conscious of his situation, he shuddered at its approach. It stopped—a servant alighted, and a gentleman and lady issued from the carriage. Nothing of this kind had ever before made its appearance in that place, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its vicinity, and the spirit of the care-worn soldier almost died within him. He surveyed his guests; and as he reverted to the insuf∣ficiency of that provision which it was within his abil∣ity to make, the anguish of his mind was more than proportioned to the occasion. It was too late, however, for the travellers to proceed farther that night; no other public house was within many miles; and with an air of ineffable benignity, the gentleman handed the lady in∣to the cottage; but hardly had he passed the thresh∣old, when, glancing the highly honoured Veteran, in a
<PB N="171" REF="034162_0837_0FFC5755A1C1B558"/>
voice of extacy, inmingled with astonishment, he ex∣claimed:</P>
<P>"<HI>Great and good God! who do I see?</HI>—Major B—, is it possible, or do the visions of the night once more mock my wishes? Tell me, are you indeed my incom∣parable friend?" He hastened forward—in a moment they were locked in each others arms; the unfortu∣nate man almost gasped for breath; to respond was not immediately in his power. At length, however, he articulated—"<HI>Yes, yes, I am indeed your once happy—now desolate friend. My prospects</HI>—<HI>where are they? Fled</HI>—<HI>gone forever.</HI>" "Cloud not," interrupted Captain A—, (for the feelings of the reader have doubtless already recognized the grateful Briton) "could not, I charge you, the happiness of this unexpected meeting, by unavailing reflection; but, embracing henceforward the same hopes and fears, let us, on this memorable evening, reciprocate vows of eternal amity, and let us mutually consent to put it beyond the power of fate again to separate us."</P>
<P>The expressions of Mrs. B—and Mrs. A—were even more impassioned than those of the gentle∣men; they had been attached in early life—and the night was spent in mutual congratulation, mutual re∣citals, and reiterated professions of undiminished and unalterable regards, while the travellers failed not re∣peatedly to bless that curiosity, which, leading them to make the tour of the eastern States, had thus bestow∣ed on them the objects whom they had so long una∣vailingly pursued.</P>
<P>To penury, and all its gloomy attendants, Major B—has now bid adieu. Captain A—presented him with a deed of gift, conveying to him, and his heirs for ever, as a patrimonial inheritance, one thou∣sand acres of the best of his land. Two thousand more are his, at half the price for which they are sold to original purchasers; and he is to dispose of these to the best possible advantage. His eldest daughter is adopted into the family of his patron, and treated in every respect as a child of his house; he is furnished
<PB N="172" REF="034162_0838_0FFC57541E460BB8"/>
with sufficient sums to remove his family; a commo∣dious habitation is erected for him on his own grounds; again he basks in the full meridian of society and of friendship, and the sun of prosperity gilds the evening of his days. The sensations of his soul are frequently too big for utterance; he gazes on his matchless bene∣factor, and the tear gushes in his eye; ardent affection, and grateful admiration are impressed on his manly features, while gestures, abundantly more expressive than the most emphatic language, pourtray the ener∣gies of his soul.</P>
<P>His venerable parent lived only to see the clouds of adversity disperse; her parting spirit blest the reful∣gent beam of light, and hastened, without a re∣maining regret, to the paradise of its GOD.</P>

<Q><L>Local affections e'en as nature cling;</L>
<L>About the heart their tenfold cords they sling:</L>
<L>A gordian knot with magic skill they tie;</L>
<L>While close enwrought the complex fibres lie.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YES, it is possible, there may perhaps have been individuals, who, in the most extensive sense of the word, have merited the appellation, <HI>Citizens of the World</HI>—whose strong minds, struggling successfully against every view which hath not received a general contour, and prostrating at the shrine of human na∣ture, in the aggregate, have conducted as if the vast globe was their country, the venerable pair o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eden their immediate parents, and every wide-spreading col∣lateral branch of the family of man, alike entitled to their good offices.</P>
<P>Yet, I take leave to ask the reflecting and intelligent reader, if this divine expansion is not, strictly speaking, the property of Deity? and whether those who affect his attributes are not guilty of arrogant assumption? Man is a limited being; his movements are circum∣scribed
<PB N="173" REF="034162_0839_0FFC5752998CAA28"/>
within narrow bounds; his eye can take in, at a single view, but a small portion of our world: If he would transport himself from place to place, his progress, impeded by a variety of incumbrances, must be gradual; and if he would traverse the globe, he must devote to the arduous enterprize the revolution of many succeeding months. Every individual is nec∣essarily descended from a particular family; nature implants her attachments, and the hand of violence can alone uproot them.</P>
<P>The Deity views, at a single glance, the universe outspread before him—he is not confined to time, or place: Every created being is the offspring of his commanding <HI>fiat;</HI> and the unbounded diffusion of his copious and impartial regards, is therefore an effect necessarily resulting from a great and Omnipotent Cause. When we are disencumbered from these ma∣terial machines, and move with the velocity of spirit, the probability is, that we shall partake more essen∣tially the properties of our Divine Original. But dif∣ferent dispensations authorize a varied economy; and the difficulty (and, in almost every instance, the im∣possibility) of surmounting inherent and local attach∣ments, may, perhaps, like every other prominent fea∣ture of nature, be attended with its coeval advantages.</P>
<P>"I cannot, for my soul," said Albinus, as arm un∣der arm he crossed State-street with Degeneus—"I cannot, for my soul, obliterate my local partialities. Born in London, the name of an Englishman operates as a kind of charm; I involuntarily yield him a moi∣ety of my affection; and I am better pleased to meet a good character from that country, than from any other part of the globe." I would advise Albinus not to attempt the extermination of his local partiali∣ties: In other words, I would advise him not to en∣ter the lists as a combatant against <HI>parent Nature.</HI> Hath not the preferable love of country, hath not fam∣ily attachments their advantages? In what period of the world was not the real patriot held in admiration? and is not patriotism another word for a zealous de∣votion
<PB N="174" REF="034162_0840_0FFC574F9C56AF38"/>
to the interests of our country? It is certainly laudable to cultivate and invigorate a spirit of <HI>general philanthropy;</HI> but still, is it not according to the course of things, that the ardent glow should embrace "<HI>friends, parents, neighbours, first?</HI>" until, in a regular progression, circles thus formed succeed each other, while nature views complacent, the order and gradual advances of her children.—Let us pause to investi∣gate for a moment.</P>
<P>The fact advanced is, I presume, self-evident; and I conceive its utility is as clearly demonstrable. The approbation of those with whom we are connected, frequently furnishes the most powerful incentive to virtue. Every local preference produces a motive to proper and becoming actions; they continually ope∣rate as so many mentors, suggesting and nerving the purposes of virtue. Shall I wound the tender bosom of her to whom I am indebted for my existence? Shall I transfix the paternal feelings of that white-headed man, who, from my first dawn of being, has watched over me for good? Shall I outrage the manly tender∣ness which my brothers have cultivated toward me? Shall I call a blush into the cheek of my sisters? Shall I do violence to the confidence of friendship, or cover with confusion the countenance of my fellow-citizens? These are considerations which sometimes operate on the man, keeping him steady to the ar∣rangements of rectitude, even when the agency of the vicegerent in his breast is suspended, or becomes inef∣fectual in its administration.</P>
<P>Are we removed from that spot of earth, where first the purple stream commenced its vital flow? the re∣port which echoing fame will waft to those dear na∣tive haunts, becomes, in our estimation, an object of the greatest magnitude. What ideas will the narra∣tion of such and such an action originate? How will my connexions, who still continue there, be affected by such a particular step? and what will they think of my conduct, on any occasion, on which all the ener∣gies of my soul may have been called into exercise?
<PB N="175" REF="034162_0841_0FFC574CCF1E2DA0"/>
Thus I am induced to think, that a venerating attach∣ment to the opinions, and a solicitude for the approba∣tion, of those with whom we were early in the habits of amity, have a tendency to originate and confirm a regular system of propriety, to establish a scrupulous accuracy of conduct, and frequently to operate as the talisman of every laudable exertion. I am not a friend to the <HI>despotism</HI> of prejudice; I would discountenance <HI>undue</HI> partialities; and I contend only for the utility of <HI>prominent</HI> and <HI>distinguishing,</HI> not <HI>exclusive,</HI> regards. He, whose range is the universe, will, too, probably, become also an itinerant in virtue; or at least, the dissipation of his views may gradually consign his merit to oblivion. I do not assert, that my ideas may not be erroneous; I pretend not to fill the chair of infallibility; but it is, perhaps, well to put the best face on a <HI>necessity,</HI> which seems comprised in the very complexure of our nature.</P>
<P>Local attachments, we have said, (and we believe, with a few exceptions, it will be found true) insinuate themselves into, and become interwoven with, the very fibres of our existence; and their invincibility, when it is remembered that we are under the direction of un∣erring Wisdom, is a commanding proof of their util∣ity. Much time hath elapsed since I bid adieu to my native place; but neither years nor distance can ob∣literate the sensations which cluster round reflection, as I contemplate that, <HI>to me,</HI> interesting spot. It was the scene of my early pleasures; and the recollection of its dear domestic haunts are right precious to my soul. There, too, were passed the most agonizing mo∣ments I have ever yet endured. The authors of my being have long since slept in the dust; but their ashes hallow that earth, which will ever be entitled to, and which will still possess, my veneration. Misfortunes elouded my youth—my path was marked by sorrow. Many painful events have conspired to throw a gloom over the place of my birth—I would not return to it—I would not again commence a dweller there; but my most ardent benedictions will ever rest upon it;
<PB N="176" REF="034162_0842_0FFC574746241908"/>
and the affectionate attachment and approbation of its inhabitants will still constitute one of the principal sources of my complacency. I rejoice in its prosperi∣ty; and I cannot hear it named with applause, but my heart acknowledges an accompanying glow of sat∣isfaction.</P>
<P>The love of our country has been deemed a univer∣sal passion; and strong must be the interest that can supersede its operations. It is observed, that the na∣tives of every climate, and the subjects of every State and kingdom, are so strongly operated on by local at∣tachments, and their consequent partialities, as to con∣ceive their own spot of earth the best of all possible situations. The elegant songstress of the Albion world does not paint too highly, when she says:
<Q><L>The <HI>peasant of the Alps</HI> his cottage forms,</L>
<L>And builds his humble, happy home.</L>
<L>Unenvied is the rich domain,</L>
<L>That far beneath him on the plain</L>
<L>Waves its wide harvests, and its olive groves:</L>
<L>More dear to him his hut, with plaintain thatch'd,</L>
<L>Where long his unambitious heart attach'd,</L>
<L>Finds all he wishes—all he loves.</L></Q></P>
<P>Instances have been known, where a fondness for the scenes of infantile life, and the sportive days of boyhood, have enabled persons, in an advanced stage of their existence, to encounter numerous difficulties, for the purpose of visiting a spot, which fancy hath continued to paint in all the vivid colours bestowed on it by the glowing imagination of youth. It is true, if, urged by tender recollection, they quit their <HI>more</HI> commodious accommodations, the probability is, that, rendered peevish and frigid by years, and not allow∣ing for the vicissitudes of time, the termination of a fatiguing jaunt may generally give them expressions and feelings, similar to those of Doctor Johnson, when, departing from the city of London, he devoted a por∣tion of his time to the pleasingly remembered haunts of Litchfield. Yet, I conceive, the multiplication of instances of this kind will not break the charm: The
<PB N="177" REF="034162_0843_0FFC5745BACD0A20"/>
fascinating influence of juvenile pleasures will still re∣main; they will take possession of the heart with pleas∣ing accompaniments; and <HI>memory</HI> will still revert to the native lawns, the native hills, groves, meadows, rocks, and streams, with all those corresponding rap∣tures which thrilled the bosom, when first the dawn of admiration awakened every sense to the sweet enthusi∣asm of new-born rapture.</P>
<P>Yes, the <HI>amor patrioe</HI> is a natural, a beneficial, and a laudable passion—May it ever glow with Decian energy in the Columbian bosom—May we continue to regard, with filial veneration, our country's Warriors, her Patriots, and her Statesmen—and may we enume∣rate, with fervid exultation, those able proficients in excellence, who daily throng the splendid paths of fame!</P>
<P><HI>Naturally</HI> and unalterably attached to this New World, I love and revere its Constitution, its laws, and its government; and I would obliterate every circumstance that might either immediately, or eventu∣ally, envelop in clouds its dignity, its honour, or that national magnitude, to which it is so rapidly advanc∣ing. Columbia has been accused of ingratitude! and of exercising an impolitic and penurious economy, in her pecuniary rewards, to those to whom she has dele∣gated the most important trusts! Possibly, Uzza like, I may be actuated by undue officiousness, when I would assay to put forth my hand to touch the tottering ark; and yet I cannot forbear to mourn the fate of those unrewarded veterans, who are consigned to all the glooms necessarily attendant on blasted expectations; and who, wounded by ingratitude and neglect, are at this moment struggling with those depressing evils, which are the appendages of disappointment, penury, and consequent regret. And is that arrangement, I would ask, which appropriates to <HI>first rate abilities,</HI> for exertions that require <HI>every faculty of the mind, and all of life,</HI> only a scanty pittance, that will scarcely com∣mand the articles necessary to existence, either honour∣able or judicious? Are not such measures calculated
<PB N="178" REF="034162_0844_0FFC574436FF4110"/>
to drive from the most important offices, men who would do honour to their country? Will it not fill the places of government with needy adventurers, who are drove to the last extremity for a bare subsistence? and will not <HI>the people</HI> eventually suffer, for the nig∣gardly system they may at present impose?</P>
<P>I am personally acquainted with some gentlemen, highly meritorious as individuals, whose abilities are splendid, whose integrity is without a blemish, and whose accurate discharge of the trust reposed in them hath met with universal approbation: Yet these gen∣tlemen have been compelled to relinquish their employ∣ments, merely because the emoluments annexed there∣to, were inadequate to the support of their families! Devoted as I am to my country, I will repeat, that I lament the necessity which is multiplying instances of this description! and with all humility I ask—Is it not worthy the wisdom of government to consider, whether a remedy for this growing evil is not within the limits of its authority?</P>

<P>"I LOOKED in on Publicola this morning," said my friend, "and I found, on his reading desk, the Holy Bible, the Centinel, and Johnson's quarto dic∣tionary; and, hence I conclude Publicola orthodox in his religious sentiments, found in his politics, and cor∣rect in his literature." These were your conclusions, returned I; but another would have been better pleas∣ed to have observed on the reading desk, Paine's Age

of Reason, Robespierre's sanguinary code, and a trea∣tise on the utility of the guillotine—its various <HI>user,</HI> and the different <HI>cases,</HI> in which, by <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>received construc∣tion,</HI> it might be put into action.</P>
<P>It will ever remain an incontrovertible fact, that, while the understandings of men are dissimilar, they can never contemplate persons or things in the same point of view; and, if they would learn to dissent with moderation, and discard from their vocabulary a lan∣guage, for which, madness only can apologize, this world of ours would be a much more tolerable place of residence, than, in the present disposition of party, it is likely to become.</P>
<P>It is true, I cannot regard a <HI>pure unmixed democracy</HI> as that precise form of government, which is, in <HI>all its parts,</HI> the most friendly to the best interests of mankind. I cannot think that the <HI>art</HI> of legislation is within the knowledge of <HI>every man.</HI> He whose mind is <HI>filled</HI> with agricultural or commercial pursuits, whose education and subsequent occupation has been <HI>principally</HI> direct∣ed to a particular business or profession, cannot, I have conceived, obtain sufficient leisure to investigate, with the requisite attention, the great <HI>art of government;</HI> and, as I have regarded power, in <HI>unsteady</HI> and <HI>unskil∣ful</HI> hands, as a great evil, so I have called that man misguided, and an invader of the public peace, who, advancing the doctrine of claims, hath inflated the fanciful and superficial with erroneous ideas of retain∣ing prerogatives, which, by their own free suffrages, they had voluntarily relinquished. He who violently or insidiously destroys the unquestionably necessary series of subordination, who produces the various class∣es of mankind as usurpers on those orders, which, in the scale of being, take rank above them, must inevi∣tably throw a nation or a state into strong convulsions; nor, will reason authorize such an attempt, save in the last extremity. When the officers of government are chosen—when they are legally inaugurated, and have, in due form, taken their appropriate places, I am free to confess that I adopt, in an unqualified sense, the
<PB N="180" REF="034162_0846_0FFC573B9A1FBA98"/>
sentiment which Homer hath put into the mouth of his Pylian sage; and, at least until a <HI>succeeding election,</HI> I would say,
<Q><L>Be silent, friends, and think not here allow'd,</L>
<L>That worst of tyrants, an <HI>usurping crowd.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I confess that a <HI>Federal representative Republic</HI> is the government of my election, and under the constitu∣tion of the United States of Columbia I would choose to pass my days; yet, I possess no right to impose my sentiments on my brethren; nor can I be justified in flashing the <HI>lie in his face,</HI> who would maintain op∣posite principles. A paragraph is produced in to-day's paper, which I conceive fundamentally and totally wrong; but, is it not possible that the veracity of the writer may, nevertheless, remain unimpeachable? may he not have been misinformed, and under the impres∣sion of an error, in which circumstances, beyond his control, may have involved him? may he not have given precisely that representation which appeared to him literally true? and, would it not best consist with the character of the rational man, to respond with mildness, and that candour which generally points the luminous rays of conviction?</P>
<P>Every sense of propriety is lacerated by the ungen∣tlemanlike warmth, with which a certain class of po∣litical writers handle each other; and, for myself, when pursuing my vocation, in my accustomed routine of duty, I essay to <HI>glean,</HI> in those copious fields, the scat∣tered grain which may perchance remain, my feelings are too often barbarously mangled by the briars and thorns with which they abound. If great national questions are to be agitated, why not enlist under the banners of reason, and manage the important proposi∣tion with cool and temperate discussion? Why not light the torch of investigation, and, after deliberately and minutely scanning one by one, circumstances and positions, why not calmly submit the decision to the unbiassed suffrages of a great, an enlightened, and a free people? Why must the reputation of <HI>individuals</HI> be blackened, and sentiments and opinions arraigned,
<PB N="181" REF="034162_0847_0FFC573A12015448"/>
altogether foreign from the subject in debate? Why is <HI>philosophy</HI> maligned, and the <HI>caution of wisdom</HI> con∣tumeliously attributed to the most unworthy and de∣basing of motives? Why is firm, unyielding integrity, warm and glowing in the common cause, accused of the temerity which marks the aristocrat—of absurdly aspiring to a monarchical establishment, and of those unwarrantable views which the soul of rectitude abhors?</P>
<P>If there exists reasons why particular men are not competent or eligible to certain offices of state, would it not be noble, and in the true Horatian spirit, to sac∣rifice <HI>private feelings to the public weal;</HI> and, heroically appearing even against the dearest of our friends, pro∣duce to the public eye, those unpropitious features, or pernicious plans, which, endangering the common∣wealth, unquestionably render the candidates, embrac∣ing such adverse sentiments unworthy the confidence of their constituents? If the reprehensible particulars were, with all requisite decency and honest frankness, boldly pointed out; if chapter and verse were cited; and if <HI>the name</HI> of the accuser was affixed to the im∣peachment, the matter then properly introduced to the public mind, would be in an honourable train, free inquiry would succeed, and truth thus placed within our reach, the crest fallen culprit would sink to the ob∣livion which he merits; while the hero, who, influenced by no other motive than zeal for the public cause, risked the eternal enmity and gave a mortal blow to the reputation, perhaps of a friend, would be crowned with those unfading honours which should ever be re∣served for the real patriot.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted that the <HI>anonymous defamer,</HI> al∣though adorned with news-paporial distinctions, ever obtains the smallest consideration. Was the dignity of legislation mine, it should stand conspicuous in my code of laws, that every <HI>unclaimed</HI> and <HI>unsupported</HI> alle∣gation, intended as derogatory to a character, should be esteemed as operating, in all respects, to the <HI>building</HI> up, <HI>elevating</HI> and <HI>confirming said character;</HI> and, did calumny thus <HI>defeat its own purpose,</HI> only the disinter∣ested,
<PB N="182" REF="034162_0848_0FFC57388F091730"/>
and truth taught man of principle, when seri∣ously and loudly called on by his country's exigencies, would assume the invidious task of holding up to a na∣tion's view, as circumstances might require, the discrim∣inating glass; which, divesting of every adventitious covering, would display the candidate such as he real∣ly was.</P>
<P><HI>Disorganizers of government, fomenters of confusion, friends to anarchy.</HI>—Discarding all these irritating epi∣thets of reproach, I would rather denominate that re∣spectable class of citizens which, at present, constitute the democratic party, <HI>misguided sons of liberty.</HI> It is matter of serious mortification, that we cannot exoner∣ate the advocates of the cause of our election from the odium of unjustifiable and indecent warmth; but, when, as if no human delinquent could furnish an ex∣ample sufficiently atrocious, the arch incendiary, who filled the beautifully tranquil walks of paradise with disobedience, disorder, and consequent death, is sum∣moned from his Tartarean domains, as the prototype of combinations of men who certainly enrol in their catalogues, names which are an honour to human na∣ture—when, I say, such intemperate and inflamma∣tory instances of aggravation are notorious, the vota∣ries of reason must blush for the unwarrantable out∣rage which is thus done to virtue, in the persons of those whose lives have been squared by her dictates. We are desirous of seeing virtue and vice, truth and error, delineated in the strongest colours: but, let them not be blended with the rage of faction, nor deformed by the frenzy of passion; let reason hold the pencil; let the style of painting be that of veracity; let the tints be accurately combined, and meliorated by can∣dour; let the disposition of light and shade evince the touches of a master—of a master thoroughly informed and perfect, as well in execution as design; and let the striking exactness of the resemblance stand con∣spicuous.</P>
<P>We pity the mind which is not sufficiently expansive to embrace the man of worth, whatever his political,
<PB N="183" REF="034162_0849_0FFC573282FEEFF0"/>
or even his religious sentiments may be; and al∣though the present head of the Columbian Union concentrates in his own great and virtuous mind every excellence which can adorn humanity, it yet be∣comes us to acknowledge the lustre of those gems which demonstrably irradiate the bosoms of surrounding worthies? We thank God that the superabounding weight of merit abundantly preponderates in the Fed∣eral scale; but we would be therewith content; and, ceasing to detract from the virtue of individuals, who <HI>lament what they esteem ruinous in the administration of our government, or even of the Constitution itself,</HI> we would allow them all the applause to which they are incon∣trovertibly entitled. Nor need we have recourse to unrighteous methods; the decision is in proper hands, and the majority will entwine in their investigations that wisdom which shall point out the man of virtue as a successor to the august Father of this younger world, which shall raise to the presidential chair, him whose brave, undaunted spirit, unappalled in the midst of danger, hath risen superior to every trial. <HI>The oft proved friend of his country's cause,</HI> who, unawed by the acrimonious breath of faction, and unbiassed by the adulatory strains of interested men, will pursue the shining path of rectitude.</P>
<P>Let us then cease by unmanly reproaches to cor∣rode the festering wounds of discontent; we are indeed brethren, and contention is therefore most improper! It will never cease to be true, that <HI>divided</HI> we shall fall an easy prey to an invading foe, and that our bond of union is the talisman of our prosperity. We would rather hear an enumeration of the virtues of our oppo∣nents than attend to a disquisition of errors, which <HI>our political ideas render self evident.</HI> And prominent in the list of meritorious characters, who have become the victims of malevolence, we distinguish the respectable name of J—s! Ill mannered zeal hath christened him the Demagogue of a faction, but candour sits en∣throned on his brow, and from his tongue issues the mellifluous strains of lettered eloquence; he is possess∣ed
<PB N="184" REF="034162_0850_0FFC5730E4655E18"/>
of extensive information while native genius uni∣formly irradiates his theme; with men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and genuine talents he must ever take rank, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the woe-worn bed of languishment, gratitude will raise to him a song of praise. Humane physician! thy panegyric, penned as we presume by the hand of one who knew thee well, hath sounded gratefully on the ear of complacency; and we have blessed the sooth∣ing strains. Yet, strange to tell—the malignant vo∣cabulary of acrimony hath been exhausted, to supply epithets expressive of the libellous and unfounded slanders, which have doubtless wounded the exquisite susceptibility of a man whose abilities and amiable be∣nevolence, would reflect honour on the most luminous cause: Such are the murderous effects of party rage!!</P>
<P>Yea, verily, instances of merit cluster in the minor∣ty; and, if our information is accurate, its principles have strongly attached the elegantly moral poetess, and faithful historian, who at the head of female litera∣ture in this new world, undauntedly dares to think, and as undauntedly dares to write, while we cannot but do homage to that <HI>noble independence</HI> which seems natal in her bosom.</P>
<P>But if we are disgusted by the dark hues in which the enthusiasts of opinion, paint the intellectual qual∣ities of their opponents, we are both astonished and shocked, at the impious absurdity of <HI>ridiculing</HI> the fig∣ure, complexion, or particular features of a fellow creature, whose ideas do not exactly square with those, which we arbitrarily impose, as the very quintescence of rectitude. Are these fit subjects of animadversion? or are we to be made responsible for their supposed ir∣regular proportions; our intellectual propensities, our actions of every description, these, or at least the gov∣ernment thereof, may be imagined in some sort sub∣ject to our control; but it must be contrary to every rule of justice and decency, to arraign a man at the bar of a respectable public, or to subject him to the licentious grin of invidious ridicule, for arrangements wholly independent of him, and for which, therefore, he cannot be accountable.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="034162_0851_0FFC572F585F26A8"/>
Are we not, we would ask, the workmanship of the Supreme Architect of heaven and earth? And are the productions of the one self-existent being, to be sub∣jected to the malevolent criticism of those, who are al∣so wholly dependent on the all-commanding <HI>fiat</HI> of that God whom they thus irreverently and impiously offend? To assign particular qualities to a particular size, or association of features; if, by Lavaterian inge¦nuity, established as a <HI>general</HI> rule—must, nevertheless, like most other <HI>general</HI> rules, admit its <HI>exceptions;</HI> and, although, even the laughter loving Sterne may expa∣tiate on "<HI>fat contented ignorance,</HI>" tacitly rendering ex∣tension of limbs, synonimous with a vacant or uncul∣tivated mind; yet, while the venerable figure of a Johnson presses on our recollection, we cannot admit his unqualified decision.</P>
<P>The man who has not music in his soul (says the immortal bard of Avon) is fit for treason, for actions of the blackest hue—let no such man be trusted. But we have known the milk of human kindness, and sweet benevolence, with firm integrity, flow in the bo∣som, and indelibly imaged on the spirit, of him who could not name a single note of music, nor could dis∣tinguish the finished composition from the wildest strains which float upon the ear of fancy. But let the <HI>licensed poet enjoy his free domain,</HI> while we, unversed in that fine frenzy by which from earth to heaven and heaven to earth he glances, leave his unbridled muse to climb Parnassian heights, gladly embracing truth as reason shall direct us.</P>
<P>We think attempts to reconcile the contending par∣ties, would be an office worthy the acceptance of pa∣tient virtue. England and France, 'tis said, divide our politicians; and, admitting this assertion, much may be said for either party. On one side, <HI>ancient kindred</HI>—<HI>parental acts of kindness</HI>—<HI>similarity of customs, of manners, of language and religion,</HI> with combining influence, may have obliterated that keen sense of injuries, and repeated outrages, which once obtained in the American bosom. On the other hand, <HI>assistance

nobly granted in the hour of dark oppression and greatest need, involving sacred gratitude, apparently connects a na∣tion's honour;</HI> but who sees not, that, discarding these contending claims, <HI>unerring justice</HI> should be created umpire, and invested with full power to draw the line.</P>
<P>Let the advocates for these clashing opinions re∣member, that affinity attenuated through many suc∣ceeding generations, loses in energy what it gains in extension; and, that from the man and woman once inhabitants of Paradise, we all originated. Let the friends of the Gallic interest also recollect that the generous Frenchmen, whose opportune assistance nerv∣ed for decisive combat our battling heroes, have either thrown off those mortal habiliments in which they joined our warriors, or, by despotic rigour deep im∣mured, wear out what remains of life in comfortless imprisonment! Was the appeal to me, I would thus determine, or thus presume to counsel—Americans, assert yourselves—Embrace that independence for which ye fought and bled!—Submit to exigencies which you cannot avert—and trust to those whose better judgment hath been your star of guidance—Give national reliance ample way—Maintain a char∣acter, <HI>a national character and preference; and learn to fill the rank by great events assigned you</HI>—Disdain to wear the badge of foreign influence—cultivate an exchange of good offices with every nation who will accept your consistent and dignified advances, but do not pusilla∣nimously court their favour—Preserve inviolate your national honour—Learn to defend yourselves—<HI>Be neither Frenchmen nor Englishmen</HI>—<HI>be AMERICANS;</HI> and delay not to <HI>embrace</HI> as <HI>brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Your contentions grate barbarously dissonant on the ear of LIBERTY. The radiant goddess is wounded by the hands of her children. Hark! she shrieks terrifi∣cally! See, her venerable form appears—her cap and staff are thrown unheeded by—arrayed in flowing robes of sky tinctured blue, she moves majestic—her parental bosom, lacerated by those whom she fondly cherished, issues a purple stream—they have aimed at

her vitals a fatal blow—her altars are thrown down—and they have ignorantly assayed to embrue their hands in the fountain of her existence. "<HI>Go,</HI>" she exclaims, "<HI>Go, direct my erring children:</HI> They are dearer to my soul than the light of heaven. But subordination, equal laws, salutary institutions, firm adherence, and impartial administration—these are the stamina of my being; divested of these indispensably requisite observances, I am muffled in clouds—my steps are marked with blood—anarchy, with murde∣rous, fiend-like visage, is in my train—the flames of discord are in my path—<HI>the universe expires in my grasp, and the reign of chaos is restored!!!</HI> WASHINGTON is my vicegerent on earth—let my sons obey the Patriot Warrior—let them venerate the unrivalled sage, and they may yet be happy. Peace, order and good gov∣ernment—these are the specifies for my bleeding wounds, and the renewal of unreserved confidence and harmony among my descendants, the only pana∣cea for the injuries inflicted on a denizen of the celes∣tial world."</P>
<P>She said, and, enveloping her grief-worn counte∣nance in her starry mantle, suddenly she sunk amid the whelming shades of night. And may the wisdom of our regulations, the order of our movements, and the complete restoration of that <HI>fraternity</HI> which should be the glory of FREE AMERICANS, give her speedily to emerge from thence; while, arrayed in new-born splen∣dor, she bestows consistency, union, patriotism and dignity on this younger world, thus proclaiming CON∣FEDERATED COLUMBIA the children of her adoption.</P>

<P>THE reader is requested to consider the four suc∣ceeding numbers as supplementary to an Essay, which made its appearance, some years since, in a pe∣riodical publication of a miscellaneous nature. The particular paper to which I advert, was entitled, <HI>The Equality of the Sexes;</HI> and, however well I may think of that composition, as I do not conceive that the sub∣ject is exhausted, I have thought proper, treading in the same path, to set about collecting a few hints, which may serve as additional, illustrative, or orna∣mental.</P>
<P>And, first, by way of exordium, I take leave to congratulate my fair country-women, on the happy revolution which the few past years has made in their favour; that in these infant republics, where, within my remembrance, the use of the needle was the prin∣cipal attainment which was thought <HI>necessary</HI> for a wo∣man, the lovely proficient is now permitted to appro∣priate a moiety of her time to studies of a more ele∣vated and elevating nature. Female academies are every where establishing, and right pleasant is the ap∣pellation to my ear.</P>
<P>Yes, in this younger world, "the Rights of Women" begin to be understood; we seem, at length, deter∣mined to do justice to THE SEX; and, improving on the opinions of a Wollstonecraft, we are ready to con∣tend for the <HI>quantity,</HI> as well as <HI>quality,</HI> of mind. The younger part of the female world have now an inesti∣mable prize put into their hands; and it depends on the rising generation to refute a sentiment, which, still retaining its advocates, grounds its arguments on the incompatibility of the present enlarged plan of female
<PB N="189" REF="034162_0855_0FFC5723DEE7BA58"/>
education, with those necessary occupations, that must ever be considered as proper to the department and comprised in the duties of a judiciously instructed and elegant woman; and, if our daughters will combine their efforts, converts to the new regulations will every day multiply among us. To argue against facts, is indeed contending with both wind and tide; and, borne down by accumulating examples, conviction of the utility of the present plans will pervade the public mind, and not a dissenting voice will be heard.</P>
<P>I may be accused of enthusiasm; but such is my confidence in THE SEX, that I expect to see our young women forming a new era in female history. They will oppose themselves to every trivial and unworthy monopolizer of time; and it will be apparent, that the adorning their persons is not with them a <HI>primary</HI> object. They will know how to appreciate personal advantages; and, considering them as bestowed by Nature, or Nature's God, they will hold them in due estimation: Yet, conscious that they confer no <HI>intrinsic</HI> excellence on the <HI>temporary</HI> possessor, their admeasure∣ment of <HI>real virtue</HI> will be entirely divested of all those <HI>prepossessing ideas,</HI> which originate in a beautiful exte∣rior. The noble expansion conferred by a liberal ed∣ucation will teach them <HI>humility;</HI> for it will give them a glance of those vast tracts of knowledge which they can never explore, until they are accommodated with far other powers than those at present assigned them; and they will contemplate their removal to a higher order of beings, as a desirable event.</P>
<P>Mild benignity, with all the modest virtues, and ev∣ery sexual grace—these they will carefully cultivate; for they will have <HI>learned,</HI> that in no character they can so effectually charm, as in that in which nature de∣signed them the <HI>pre-eminence.</HI> They will accustom themselves to reflection; they will investigate accu∣rately, and reason will point their conclusions; Yet they will not be assuming; the characteristic trait will still remain; and retiring sweetness will insure them that consideration and respect, which they do not pre∣sume

to demand. Thinking justly will not only en∣large their minds, and refine their ideas; but it will correct their dispositions, humanize their feelings, and present them the <HI>friends of their species. The beauteous bosom will no more become a lurking-place for invidious and rancorous passions;</HI> but the mild temperature of the soul will be evinced by the benign and equal tenour of their lives. Their manners will be unembarrassed; and, studious to shun even the <HI>semblance of pedantry,</HI> they will be careful to give to their most systematic ar∣guments and deductions, an unaffected and natural ap∣pearance. They will rather <HI>question</HI> than <HI>assert;</HI> and they will make their communications on a supposition, that the point in discussion has rather <HI>escaped the mem∣ory</HI> of those with whom they converse, <HI>than that it was never imprinted there.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that every faculty of their minds will be occasionally engrossed by the most momentous con∣cerns; but as often as <HI>necessity</HI> or <HI>propriety</HI> shall render it incumbent on them, they will <HI>cheerfully</HI> accommo∣date themselves to the more <HI>humble duties</HI> which their situation imposes. When their sphere of action is en∣larged, when they become wives and mothers, they will fill with honour the parts allotted them. Ac∣quainted, theoretically, with the nature of their spe∣cies, and experimentally with themselves, they will not expect to meet, in wedlock, with those faultless be∣ings, who so frequently issue, armed at all points, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeming brain of the novelist. They will learn properly to estimate; they will look, with pity's soft∣est eye, on the natural frailties of those whom they elect partners for life; and they will regard their vir∣tues with that sweet complacency, which is ever an attendant on a predilection founded on love, and hap∣pily combining esteem. As mothers, they will assume with alacrity their arduous employment, and they will cheerfully bend to its various departments. They will be primarily solicitous to fulfil, in <HI>every instance,</HI> what∣ever can <HI>justly</HI> be denominated <HI>duty;</HI> and those inter∣vals, which have heretofore been devoted to frivolity,
<PB N="191" REF="034162_0857_0FFC571BC8DE66A8"/>
will be appropriated to pursuits, calculated to inform, enlarge, and sublime the soul—to contemplations, which will ameliorate the heart, unfold and illumine the understanding, and gradually render the human being an eligible candidate for the society of angels.</P>
<P>Such, I predict, will be the daughters of Columbia; and my gladdened spirit rejoices in the prospect. A sensible and informed woman—companionable and se∣rious—possessing also a facility of temper, and united to a congenial mind—blest with competency—and rearing to maturity a promising family of children—Surely, the wide globe cannot produce a scene more truly interesting. See! the virtues are embodied—the domestic duties appear in their place, and they are all fulfilled—morality is systematized by religion, and sublimed by devotion—every movement is the offspring of elegance, and their manners have received the high∣est polish. A reciprocation of good offices, and a mu∣tual desire to please, uniformly distinguishes the indi∣viduals of this enchanting society—their conversation, refined and elevated, partakes the fire of genius, while it is pointed by information; and they are ambitious of selecting subjects, which, by throwing around humanity, <HI>in its connexion,</HI> additional lustre, may implant a new motive for gratitude, and teach them to anticipate the rich fruition of that immortality which they boast. Such is the family of reason—of reason, cultivated and adorned by literature.</P>
<P><HI>The idea of the incapability</HI> of women, is, we conceive, in this <HI>enlightened age,</HI> totally <HI>inadmissible;</HI> and we have concluded, that establishing the <HI>expediency</HI> of admitting them to share the blessings of equality, will remove every obstacle to their advancement. In proportion as nations have progressed in the arts of civilization, the value of THE SEX hath been understood, their rank in the scale of being ascertained, and their con∣sequence in society acknowledged. But if prejudice still fortifies itself in the bosom of any; if it yet en∣listeth its votaries against the said despot and its fol∣lowers, we produce, instead of arguments, <HI>a number of
<PB N="192" REF="034162_0858_0FFA660F14F45D58"/>
well attested facts,</HI> which the student of female annals hath carefully compiled.</P>
<P>Women, circumscribed in their education within very narrow limits, and constantly depressed by their occupations, have, nevertheless, tinged the cheek of manhood with a guilty suffusion, for a pusillanimous capitulation with the enemies of their country. Quit∣ting the loom and the distaff, they have beheld, with indignation, their husbands and their sons flee in bat∣tle: With clasped hands, and determined resolution, they have placed themselves in their paths, obstructing their passage, and insisting, with heroic firmness, on their immediate return to death or conquest! They have anxiously examined the dead bodies of their slaughtered sons; and if the fatal wounds were receiv∣ed in front, thus evincing that they have bravely faced the foe, the fond recollection of their valour has be∣come a source of consolation, and they have sung a <HI>requiem</HI> to their sorrows! Women, in the heat of ac∣tion, have mounted the rampart with undaunted cour∣age, arrested the progress of the foe, and bravely res∣cued their besieged dwellings! They have successfully opposed themselves to tyranny and the galling yoke of oppression! Assembling in crowds, they have arm∣ed themselves for the combat—they have mingled amid the battling ranks—they have fought heroically—and their well-timed and well-concerted measures have emancipated their country! They have hazard∣ed the stroke of death in its most frightful form; and they have submitted to bonds and imprisonment, for the redemption of their captive husbands!</P>
<P>The character of the Spartan women is marked with uncommon firmness. At the shrine of patriotism they immolated nature. Undaunted bravery and unim∣peached honour, was, in their estimation, far beyond affection. The name of Citizen possessed, for them, greater charms than that of Mother; and so highly did they prize the warrior's meed, that they are said to have shed tears of joy over the bleeding bodies of their wounded sons!</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="034162_0859_0FFC571A43F14AE8"/>
When Europe and Asia were infested by armed multitudes, who, emigrating for purposes of devasta∣tion and settlement, perpetrated the most ferocious acts, among all those various tribes of unprincipled invaders, <HI>no discriminating line seems to have marked the sexes;</HI> wives submitted to similar hardships with their husbands; equally they braved the impending dan∣ger; and their efforts and their sufferings were the same: Nor can their habits of endurance and patient fortitude admit a rational doubt.</P>
<P>The women of Hungary have rendered themselves astonishingly conspicuous in their wars against the Ot∣toman Empire—But proofs abound; and numerous actions might be produced to evince, that courage is by no means <HI>exclusively</HI> a masculine virtue. Women have frequently displayed an intrepidity, not to be sur∣passed by men—neither is their bravery the impulse of the moment. They not only, when trained by educa∣tion, and inured by subsequent habit, rise superior to the fears of death; but, with unimpassioned and se∣date composure, <HI>they can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>—they can struggle with the fatigues and inconveniences—they can fulfil the duties, and they can support the irremediable ca∣lamities of war. They have achieved the most sur∣prising adventures; indulgencies have been extended to them on the well-fought field; and they have ex∣pired with the weapons of death in their hands! Ac∣tuated by devotional zeal, and stimulated by the sub∣lime expectation of an opening heaven, and a glorious immortality, they have rushed into the flames, have ascended the scaffold, have suffered the dismemberment of their bodies, have submitted to the tortures of dislo∣cation, and to the most excruciating racks, in defence of truth! nor hath the voice of murmuring or com∣plaint escaped their lips!</P>
<P>Women have publickly harangued on religion—they have presented themselves as disputants—they have boldly supported their tenets—they have been raised to the chair of philosophy, and of law—they have written fluently in Greek, and have read with great
<PB N="194" REF="034162_0860_0FFC5718A93F18E8"/>
facility the Hebrew language. Youth and beauty, adorned with every feminine grace, and possessing em∣inently the powers of rhetoric, have pathetically con∣jured the mitred fathers and the Christian monarchs to arm themselves for the utter extirpation of the en∣emies of their holy religion.</P>
<P>In the days of knight-errantry, females, elevated by the importance with which they were invested, dis∣criminated unerringly between the virtues and the vices, studiously cultivating the one, and endeavouring to exterminate the other; and their attainments <HI>equal∣led the heroism of their admirers;</HI> their bosoms glowed with sentiments as sublime as those they originated; generosity marked their elections; the impassioned feelings, the burst of tenderness, were invariably blend∣ed with honour; and every expression, every move∣ment, was descriptive of the general enthusiasm. Pride, heroism, extravagant attachments; these were common to both sexes. Great enterprizes, bold ad∣ventures, incredible bravery—in every thing the wo∣men partook the colour of the times; and their taste and their judgment were exactly conformed. Thus the sexes are congenial; they are copyists of each oth∣er; and their opinions and their habits are elevated or degraded, animated or depressed, by precisely the same circumstances.</P>
<P>The Northern nations have generally been in the habit of venerating the Female Sex. Constantly em∣ployed in bending the bow, in exploring the haunts of those animals, who were the victims of their pleasures and their passions, or of urging against their species the missive shafts of death, they nevertheless banished their ferocity, and assumed the mildest manners, when associating with their mothers, their sisters, their mis∣tresses, or their wives. In their ample forests, their athletic frames and sinewy arms were nerved for bat∣tle, while the smiles of some lovely woman were the meed of valour; and the hero who aspired to the ap∣probation of the beautiful arbitress of his fate, author∣ized
<PB N="195" REF="034162_0861_0FFC5714EBD7D4C8"/>
his wishes, and established his pretensions, by em∣inent virtue, and a long series of unbroken attentions.</P>
<P>A persuasion, that the common Father of the uni∣verse manifests himself more readily to females than to males, has, at one period or another, obtained, more or less, in every division of the globe. The Germans, the Britons, and the Scandinavians—from these the supposition received an easy credence. The Grecian women delivered oracles—the Romans venerated the Sibyls—among the people of God, the Jewish women prophesied—the predictions of the Egyptian matron were much respected—and we are assured, that the most barbarous nations referred to their females, what∣ever they fancied beyond the reach of human efforts: And hence we find women in possession of the myste∣ries of religion, the <HI>arcana</HI> of physic, and the ceremo∣nies of incantation. Writers assert, that several nations have ascribed to women the gift of prescience, con∣ceiving that they possessed qualities approximating to divinity; and the ferocious German, embosomed in his native woods, renders a kind of devotional reve∣rence to the Female Sex.</P>
<P>Such is the character of those periods, when women were invested with <HI>undue elevation;</HI> and the reverse presents THE SEX in a state of humiliation, altogether as unwarrantable. The females among the savages of our country, are represented as submitting to the most melancholy and distressing oppression; slaves to the ferocious passions and irregular appetites of those tyrannical usurpers, who brutally and cruelly outrage their feelings. They encounter for their support, in∣credible hardships and toils, insomuch that, weary of their own wretched existence, the women on the banks of the Oronoko, urged by compassion, not unfrequently smother the female infant in the hour of its birth; and she who hath attained sufficient fortitude to per∣form this <HI>maternal</HI> act, esteems herself entitled to ad∣ditional respect. Commodore Byron, in his account of the inhabitants of South-America, informs us, that the men exercise a most despotic authority over their
<PB N="196" REF="034162_0862_0FFC5710E9243618"/>
wives, whom they consider in the same view they do any other part of their property, and dispose of them accordingly: Even their common treatment of them is cruel; for, although the toil and hazard of procur∣ing food lies entirely on the women, yet they are not suffered to touch any part of it, till their imperious masters are satisfied, and then he assigns them their portion, which is generally very scanty, and such as he has not an appetite for, himself.</P>
<P>Thus have the Sex continued the sport of contin∣gencies; unnaturally subjected to extremes; alter∣nately in the mount of exaltation, and in the valley of unmerited degradation. Is it wonderful, then, that they evince so little stability of character? Rather, is it not astonishing, that their attainments are so numer∣ous, and so considerable? Turning over the annals of different ages, we have selected a number of names, which we purpose, in our next Essay, to cite, as vouch∣ers of THE SEX's merit; nor can we doubt, that their united suffrages will, on a candid investigation, effec∣tually establish the female right to that <HI>equality with their brethren, which, it is conceived, is assigned them in the Order of Nature.</HI></P>

by the circumstances and the persons, but the foun∣dation is the same." This celebrated and truly re∣spectable biographer has yielded every thing that we wish; and the testimony of so nice a distinguisher must be considered as a very powerful auxiliary.</P>
<P>It is not our purpose to analyze the properties of mind; we are inclined to think, that accurately to dis∣criminate, or draw the intellectual line, is beyond the power of the best informed metaphysician within the purlieus of humanity. Besides, as we write for the <HI>ma∣ny,</HI> and as it is notorious that a number of <HI>well attested facts</HI> have abundantly more weight with <HI>the multitude,</HI> than the finest spun systems which ever issued from the archives of theory, we shall proceed to summon our witnesses, arranging their testimonies with as much or∣der, as the cursory turning over a number of volumes, to which a deficiency in memory necessitates us to apply, will permit; and here, (lest the patience of our readers should reluct at the idea of the mot∣ley circle, to which they may apprehend they are to be introduced) we take leave to inform them, that we shall be careful to abridge, as much as possible, the copious depositions which may present.</P>
<P>Many centuries have revolved, since the era, when writers of eminence, giving a catalogue of celebrated women, have made the number to amount to eight hundred and forty-five: From these, and succeeding attestators, we shall select a few, not perhaps the most striking, but such as occur the most readily. Our ob∣ject is to prove, by examples, that the minds of women are <HI>naturally</HI> as susceptible of every improvement, as those of men. In the course of our examination, an obvious conclusion will, we conceive, force itself on ev∣ery attentive and ingenuous reader. If the triumphs and attainments of THE SEX, under the various oppres∣sions with which they have struggled, have been thus splendid, how would they have been augmented, had not ignorant or interested men, after clipping their wings, contrived to erect around them almost insur∣mountable barriers. Descartes expatiated on the phi∣losophical
<PB N="198" REF="034162_0864_0FFC570CAC428D18"/>
abilities of <HI>the sex;</HI> and, if their supporting themselves with astonishing equanimity under the com∣plicated oppressions to which they are not unfrequent∣ly subjected, may be called the practice of any branch of philosophy, the experience of every tyrant will evince their proficiency therein. But the highly re∣spectable and truly honourable court, is, we presume, convened; the jury are empanneled, and we proceed to the examination of the witnesses, leaving the plead∣ings to those silent suggestions and inferences, which, we are assured, will voluntarily enlist themselves as advocates in every ingenuous bosom. The pending cause, as we have before observed, involves the estab∣lishment of the female intellect, or the maintaining the justice and propriety of considering women, as far as relates to their understanding, in <HI>every respect,</HI> equal to men. Our evidences tend to prove them—
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> Alike capable of enduring hardships.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> Equally ingenious, and fruitful in resources.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Their fortitude and heroism cannot be sur∣passed.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> They are equally brave.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fifthly,</HI> They are as patriotic.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sixthly,</HI> As influential.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Ninthly,</HI> As capable of supporting, with honour, the toils of government. And</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Tenthly,</HI> and <HI>Lastly,</HI> They are equally susceptible of every literary acquirement.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And, <HI>First,</HI> They are alike capable of enduring hardships. A proposition so self-evident, supercedes the necessity of either arguments or witnesses. On the women of Brittany, and the females among the savages of our own country, fatigues almost incredible are im∣posed. Imbecility seems to have changed sexes; and it is in these instances, <HI>masculine weakness and feminine vigour.</HI> THE SEX, enervated and sinking amid the luxuries and indulgencies of an Asiatic climate, are
<PB N="199" REF="034162_0865_0FFC570B26097128"/>
elsewhere hardy and courageous, and fully adequate to all those exertions requisite to the support of them∣selves and their supine oppressors; and these well au∣thenticated facts, are, I conceive, alone sufficient to prove the <HI>powerful and transforming effects of education, and subsequent habits.</HI> But we need not take a voyage to Brittany, nor penetrate the haunts of savages, to prove that women are capable of suffering. They are the <HI>enduring sex;</HI> and, by the irreversible constitution of nature, they are subjected to agonies unknown to man∣hood; while I do not recollect that they are exempt∣ed from any of the calamities incident to humanity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They are <HI>equally</HI> ingenious, and fruitful in resources. Female ingenuity will not, we apprehend, be controverted; every day furnishes fresh proof of their invention, and their resources are a consequence. We select, however, a corroborating instance, which, from its salutary effect, seems to claim a preference.</P>
<P>A certain sovereign, of avaricious memory, was so fond of amassing treasure, that he arbitrarily compelled a very large proportion of his subjects to labour in the mines; but while his majesty's ingots were rapidly augmenting, the grounds remained uncultivated; fam∣ine advanced with hasty strides; and the dreary pros∣pect every moment gathered darkness. No one pos∣sessed sufficient intrepidity to remonstrate—the despot's nod was fate—from his decrees there was no appeal—and the love of life, although its eligibles may be in a great measure diminished, is generally a paramount passion. In this emergency, the ingenuity of the queen suggested a resource that snatched the nation from the horrors of that <HI>dearth</HI> which had seemed so inevitable. She secretly employed an artist to produce an exact imitation of those luxuries, in which the king most de∣lighted, a variety of fish and fowl—bread and fruits of the most delicious kind, made of pure gold, were expeditiously completed, and displayed in order on the <HI>costly</HI> board—the table was highly decorated—and, when every thing was complete, the king, (after hav∣ing been purposely diverted from taking his customa∣ry
<PB N="200" REF="034162_0866_0FFC5C7D097C7F50"/>
refreshment) was ushered into the banqueting-room. His Majesty took a seat—for a moment, astonishment suspended even the clamours of hunger, and his mind was occupied by admiration of the imagination of the queen, and the deceptive abilities of the artist. The event was proportioned to the most sanguine expec∣tations of the lady. The mines were suddenly dis∣peopled, and the earth again produced the necessary support.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Their fortitude and heroism cannot be sur∣passed. Listen to a woman of Sparta, reduced by mel∣ancholy casualties to a state of servitude—She was captured, and afterwards sold as a slave. The question was put by him on whom her very existence seemed to depend—<HI>"What knowest thou?" "To be free,"</HI> was her characteristic reply: But the unfeeling despot, unin∣fluenced by indubitable indications of a noble mind, proceeded to impose his ignominious commands; to which she dispassionately returned, "<HI>you are unworthy of me;</HI>" and instantly resigned herself to death. For∣titude and heroism was a conspicuous trait in, and gave uncommon dignity to, the character of the Ro∣man ladies. Arria, the wife of Paetus, a Roman of consular dignity, is an illustrious instance of that trans∣cendent elevation, of which the female mind is suscep∣tible. With persevering firmness, and a tenderness not to be exceeded, she continued unwearied in her en∣deavours to procure the life of her husband—long she cherished hope; but, when the pleasing vision fled, and the portending storm was bursting over their heads: In that tremendous moment, while the disap∣pointed man, trembling on the verge of dissolution, had not the courage to point the deadly weapon—with that exquisite delicacy, true fortitude, and <HI>faithfulness of affection, which is so highly sexual, she first imprinted on her own bosom the characters of death;</HI> and, animated by that sublime consciousness becoming a being more than half celestial, she then presented him the pointed dagger, with this consolatory assurance—"<HI>Paetus, this gives me no pain.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="034162_0867_0FFA662BB5438368"/>
But fortitude and heroism are not confined to the Greek and Roman ladies; we have pledged ourselves not to multiply examples unnecessarily, otherwise a crowd of witnesses presenting, we could with difficulty suppress their testimony. Yet we find it impossible so speedily to close this part of our examination; and from the multitude of examples in the Island of Great-Britain, we produce the Lady Jane Gray, who seemed an exemplification of every virtue and every grace which has been attributed to the male or female character. The excellent understanding the received from nature was opened and improved by uniform ap∣plication. At sixteen, her judgment had attained a high degree of maturity. She was at that age an a∣dept both in the Greek and Latin languages; and she was able to declare that her Greek Plato was a more pleasing entertainment to her than all those enchanting pleasures usually so captivating to the unexperienced mind. Nurtured in the bosom of parental affection, and of tender friendship—happy in the distinguishing regards of her sovereign, and permitted the sublime en∣joyment of intellectual pursuits, she had no ambition for the pageantry of royalty, and her advancement to the throne was an era, over which she dropped the melancholy tear. We are sensible that in adverting to these traits in a character, affectingly interesting, we do in fact anticipate other divisions of our subject; but, contemplating a mind thus richly furnished, it is diffi∣cult to consider separately, endowments so nicely blend∣ed, and reflecting on each other such unusual lustre.</P>
<P>The passage of the Lady Jane, from the throne to the scaffold, was very short—her imposed queenship continued only ten days; yet she seemed displeased at their duration, and she received, with <HI>heroic fortitude,</HI> the message of death. The lover and the husband, whose vows she had recently accepted, was also under sentence of death; and, on the morning assigned for their martyrdom, he solicited for a parting interview; with solemn firmness she refused his request—yet her resolution originated not in a deficiency of tenderness;
<PB N="202" REF="034162_0868_0FFA662DE5682048"/>
but it was nerved by an apprehension that her sensi∣bilities, thus stimulated, might surmount her fortitude. With modest resignation she pursued her way to the place of execution—the officers of death, bearing the body of her husband, while the headless trunk yet streamed with blood, met her on her passage—neither of them had completed their seventeenth year—she looked—she sighed—and then, reassuming her compos∣ed sedateness, desired her conductors to proceed—she mounted the scaffold with an accelerated step—she ad∣dressed the surrounding spectators—she committed the care of her person to her woman; and, with a coun∣tenance descriptive of serene dignity, bowed her head to the executioner. Thus perished a spotless victim of despotism and of bigotry in the bloom of youth and beauty, rich in innocence, and adorned with every lit∣erary accomplishment and sexual grace. Latest pos∣terity will lament her fate, and many hearts will join to execrate the sanguinary measures which procured it. Under this head we produce but one more testimony.</P>
<P>Miss Anna Askew, a young lady of great merit, and possessed also of a beautiful exterior, lived during the tyranny of Henry VIII. of England; a despot, who seemed to conceive the female world created on purpose to administer to his pleasures, or to become the victims of his cruelty and implacability. Miss Askew was arraigned as a transgressor; her crime was, a denial of the <HI>real presence in the eucharist;</HI> and for this atrocious offence, she was rigorously imprisoned, and subjected to a series of barbarities that would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>graced even savage inhumanity. Yet in a situation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> involved trials, that in a succeeding reign proved too mighty for the <HI>resolution even of the virtuous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> continued unshaken. With unyielding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she vindicated the truth of her opinion, and her hourly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were offered up to her Father God. The chancellor, a bigoted Catholic, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> questioned her relative to her abettors; but she nobly disdained to present an accusation, the conse∣quences of which she so rigorously experienced: Her
<PB N="203" REF="034162_0869_0FFC5C7B5F47E770"/>
unbending integrity furnished the pretence, and she was, without further delay, put to the torture; but still her fortitude receded not; and her heroic silence evinced her abundantly superior to their unmanly cruelties. The enraged chancellor, in whose presence she suffered, transported with diabolic zeal, grasping with his own hands the cords, violently stretched the rack, and almost tore her body asunder; while yet unappalled, her fortitude forsook her not, and her triumph over her barbarous tormentors was complete.</P>
<P>Her death-warrant was next made out, and she re∣ceived the sentence which condemned her to the flames, as an emancipation from every evil. All her joints dislocated by the rack, she was borne to the place of execution; and there, after being bound to the stake, was offered her life on condition of retracting her sup∣posed error; but she consistently rejected an existence to be purchased only by the forfeiture of that con∣sciousness of rectitude, which the virtuous so well know how to prize; and as the flames that were her passport to regions of blessedness, enkindled around her, a song of thanksgiving was on her lips, and her exultation evidently augmented.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> They are equally brave. Bravery is not a quality which figures <HI>gracefully</HI> in the list of female virtues, nor are we anxious it should take rank in the catalogue—far from it; we should rather lament to see it become a characteristic trait. We would have women support themselves with consistent firmness under the various exigencies of life, but we would not arm them with the weapons of death: Yet, when con∣tending for <HI>equality of so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l,</HI> it may be necessary to prove the <HI>capability</HI> of the female mind, to rear to perfection whatever seeds may be adventitiously implanted there∣in.

This magnanimous female beheld the streaming wounds of her expiring father, in the fatal moment in which he was slaughtered on the field of battle; and, instead of yielding to those tender sensibilities originat∣ing in nature, and generally associated with valour—instead of lamenting his fate by sighs and tears, or the wordy exclamations of clamorous sorrow, she undaunt∣edly seized that sword and shield now rendered useless to the venerable warrior, and, arming herself therewith, reanimated the dispirited soldiers, led them once more to the charge; bravely opposed the Turks, who, hav∣ing forced a gate, were rapidly advancing; and glo∣riously avenged the death of her father, by driving them back to the shore, and compelling them to take refuge in their vessels.</P>
<P>Jane of Flanders next presents: This lady, during the imprisonment of her husband, nobly supported the declining honours of her house: With her infant son in her arms, she met the assembling citizens, and pa∣thetically deploring her misfortunes, she secured their exertions in her favour. She sustained with unyielding firmness the attacks of a vigilant and active foe. In the frequent sallies made by the garrison, she herself led on her warriors. At the head of three hundred horse, with her own hand she set fire to the tents and baggage of the besiegers, thus necessitating them to desist from the general assault which they were in the moment of commencing; and, although intercepted in her return to the citadel, she nevertheless fought her way through one quarter of the French camp, and rejoined her faithful friends in triumph!</P>
<P>Margaret of Anjou is a decisive proof that courage is not <HI>exclusively</HI> the property of man—Brave, indefati∣gable and persevering—fruitful in resources—support∣ing by her genius and her exertions a pusillanimous husband—repeatedly emancipating him from prison, and replacing him on a throne which he had lost by imbecility, and which he was unable to retain—and equal to every thing which depended on undaunted courage, she headed her armies in person; directed

their arrangements; and proceeded from rank to rank, animating them by her undaunted intrepidity and judicious conduct; and, when borne down by misfor∣tunes, and apparently destitute of every resource, sud∣denly she emerged, and, followed by numerous armies, again appeared in the field; nor did she submit to fate, until she had fought, as a general and a soldier, <HI>twelve decisive battles!!!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THEY are equally patriotic. We have, in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me measure, forestalled this article. The Grecian women have produced their testimonies, and that preference which they demonstrably mani∣fested to the character Citizen; estimating it beyond the endearing appellations, Wife and Mother, incon∣trovertibly establishes their sex's <HI>capability</HI> of experienc∣ing with an ardour <HI>not to be exceeded,</HI> the patriotic glow; and yet it is true, that sexual occupations fre∣quently humiliating, and generally far removed from whatever has a tendency to elevate the mind, may rationally be supposed to chill, in the female bosom, the fine fervours of the <HI>amor patrioe.</HI></P>
<P>Women are not usually exercised in those extensive contemplations which engage the legislator: They are not called on to arm in their country's cause; to ap∣pear in the well fought field, or to put their lives at hazard: But when they part with him in whom is centered their dearest hopes, who blends the char∣acters lover, friend, husband and protector—when they resign to the hostile career the blooming youth
<PB N="206" REF="034162_0872_0FFC5C6EA24E6CC8"/>
whom from infancy they have watched with all a mother's tenderness, and whose rich maturity hath become the pride and consolation of their declining life—in those moments of anguish, their heroism and their fortitude are indisputably evinced. Nor is the patriotism of the chief arrayed for the battle; nor his, who devotes himself with all a statesman's integrity to the public weal, condemned to an ordeal more severe.</P>
<P>The <HI>patriotism</HI> of the Roman ladies, procured a senatorial decree that funeral orations should be pro∣nounced from the rostrum in their praise: Repeatedly they saved their country. And the <HI>patriotism</HI> of the mother and wise of Coriolanus, while it snatched Rome from impending ruin, devoted to inevitable de∣struction the husband and the son: Hence towered the temple consecrated to feminine honour; and it must be confessed they had purchased this distinction at a very high price. The venerable Senate, too, again interposed; public thanks were decreed; and men were ordered, on all occasions, to yield prece∣dence to women.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> They are as influential. The ascendency obtained by females, is so notorious, as to have become proverbial. Instances are multiplied, wherein women have bent to their purposes the strongest masculine understanding. Samson, the victim of female blan∣dishments, is not a singular instance. The example cited under the last article, is in point. Coriolanus rejected with unbending severity supplicating friend∣ship, garbed in senatorial robes; succeeding deputies plead in vain—The ministers of religion, cloathed in sacerdotal habits, joined in solemn procession—they crowded around the warrior, commissioned to advocate a sinking people's cause; still, however, he continued obdurate, inflexibly firm and steady to his plans. But Veturia and Volumnia, his wife and mother, attended by the most illustrious of the Roman ladies, appear—they shed torrents of tears—they embrace his knees—the hero is disarmed—his heart is melted—his resent∣ment and his resolutions vanish together—and Rome is saved.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="034162_0873_0FFC5C6D1BE1E4C8"/>
<HI>Seventhly,</HI> They are as energetic, and as eloquent, Women always decree with fervour: Did it depend on them, their movements would be decisive. Their expressions are often as strongly marked, as they are vehement; and both their plans and the execution thereof, are endowed with all the vigour that existing regulations will permit. Their eloquence is indispu∣table. Possessing a richness of fancy; their words are sufficiently copious; and education, when they are indulged with its aids, prescribes the proper rules. Aspasia, of Miletus, it is well known, taught the im∣mortal Socrates rhetoric and politics. And, when Rome groaned under the enormous cruelties of her second Triumvirate, the three barbarians by whom she was enslaved, and who had armed themselves for the destruction of her citizens, as if desirous of spread∣ing every possible calamity, seized not only the lives, but the treasures of the people, and equally greedy of gold as of blood, after exhausting every other mode of plunder, turned their rapacious views on those respect∣able matrons, who had hitherto been exempted from pecuniary exactions; an exorbitant tax was levied on every individual female, and the consternation oc∣casioned by this unheard of assumption, was propor∣tioned to the distress of which it was productive.</P>
<P>In this extraordinary emergency, the oppressed fe∣males earnestly solicited the aid of those advocates who were appointed to plead the cause of the injured and defenceless; but the orators, fearful of incurring the displeasure of those who had usurped the power of life and death, refused to interfere; and no means of redress appearing, submission to an imposition acknowl∣edged grievous, seemed inevitable: It was, however, reserved to the talents and exertions of Hortensia to furnish the desired aid.</P>
<P>This lady inherited all the abilities of her father; and she presented herself a voluntary advocate for her sex. With modest intrepid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y she opened, conducted, and closed the pleadings. Persuasion dwelt on her tongue: Her arguments resulting from rectitude,
<PB N="208" REF="034162_0874_0FFC5C69C2A327D8"/>
were pointed by reason: And it will be conceived that her rhetorical powers must have been of the first rate, when it is remembered that <HI>the countenances of the tyrants betrayed sudden and evident tokens of that remorse which was then first enkindled in their bosoms;</HI> the hue of guilt pervaded their cheeks, and they hastily repeal∣ed the injurious decree. For the brow of Horten∣sia, fame prepared an immortal wreath: To the ut∣most gratitude of her cotemporaries she was entitled: Her triumph was the triumph of virtue and of talents: She enkindled even in the callous breasts of assassins, the almost extinguished sparks of humanity; and she stands on the page of history, a pattern of dauntless courage, and an example of genuine eloquence.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> They are as faithful and as persevering in their attachments. Here countless witnesses crowd on retention, and the greatest difficulty is in choosing judiciously. Repeatedly have I seen the faithfully attached female, firmly persevering in that affection which was first implanted in the soil of innocence, and fondly watching with tender anxiety every symptom of the diseased man: With patient assiduity she hath hung over the couch, and sought to mitigate the pangs of him, whose licentious conduct had brought ruin on herself and her unoffending children! Had circum∣stances been reversed, <HI>divorce</HI> would have succeeded—a hospital must have sheltered the helpless woman; and, had she received from the man she had injured any trivial attention, the unmerited gratuity would have resounded through the circle of their connexions, been dwelt on with rapture, and echoed by every tongue. But when virtue is the basis; when acts of kindness cement the union, THE SEX in many instan∣ces have set no bound to that faithful attachment which their hearts have exultingly acknowledged. Filial duty—conjugal affection—persevering constancy—these receive in the female bosom the highest perfec∣tion of which they are, in the present state, susceptible.</P>
<P>The young Roman, supporting her imprisoned pa∣rent by the milk of her own chaste bosom, if unparal∣leled
<PB N="209" REF="034162_0875_0FFC5C632E694960"/>
in history, would yet, in like situation, obtain many imitators; and the feelings of a daughter would prompt, for the relief of the authors of her being, the noblest exertions. The celebrated Mrs. Roper, eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Moore, continued his affec∣tionate solace during his imprisonment: With heart-affecting anguish she rushed through the guards to catch, from the illustrious martyr, a last embrace. Bending under a weight of calamity, she obtained permission to pay him sepulchral honours; and, re∣gardless of the tyrant's power, she purchased the vene∣rable head of the meritorious sufferer: Yet, too noble to permit the consequences to fall upon another, with dauntless courage she became her own accuser; and, loaded with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etters for two crimes, "for having watch∣ed the head of her father as a relique, and for having preserved his books and writings," appeared with un∣concern before her judges—justified herself with that eloquence which virtue bestows on injured merit—commanding admiration and respect—and spent the remainder of her life in solitude, in sorrow, and in study.</P>
<P>But women, unable to support existence, when de∣prived of those with whom they have exchanged the nuptial vow, have mounted the funeral pile, and hast∣ened to rejoin their deceased partners in other worlds. Portia, the daughter of Cato Uticensis, and wife of Brutus, hearing of the death of her husband, disdained to live; and when debarred access to the usual weapons of destruction, made her exit by resolutely swallowing burning coals of sire! Julia, the wife of Pompey, ex∣pired upon seeing his robe distained with the blood which she imagined had issued from his veins. Molfa Tarquinia, rendered illustrious by genius and litera∣ture, of unblemished virtue, and possessing, also, a beau∣tiful exterior, although one of the brightest ornaments of the Court of Ferrara, and receiving from the peo∣ple of Rome, that unprecedented honour, the freedom of their city, mourned, nevertheless, through a long life, until the hour of her dissolution, the husband of
<PB N="210" REF="034162_0876_0FFC5C5FE06E71C8"/>
her youth. Artemisia, wife of Mausolus, rendered herself illustrious, and obtained immortality, by her devotion to the memory of her husband. The Mau∣soleum, which she reared in honour of him, was con∣sidered as one of the seven wonders of the world; and it gave name to all those succeeding monuments, which were distinguished by extraordinary marks of magnifi∣cence. Artemisia expired, the victim of inconsolable regret and tender sorrow, before the Mausoleum was completed. Victoria Colonna, Marchioness of Pesca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ra, ardently engaged in literary pursuits, while fame did ample justice to her productions; yet, separated by the stroke of death, in the morning of her days, from an illustrious and gallant husband, appropriated her remaining years to unceasing grief, lamenting, in her pathetic Essays, the long-lost hero. The celebrat∣ed Mrs. Rowe, equally conspicuous for genius and virtue, continued faithful and persevering in her at∣tachment to her deceased husband; nor could a length of years abate her regrets.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> They are capable of supporting, with equal honour, the toils of government. Semiramis appears to have associated all the virtues and vices which have received the masculine stamp—she extended her em∣pire from Ethiopia to India, and subdued many na∣tions—her buildings and gardens were also magnifi∣cent—and she governed, in many respects, judiciously. Artemisia, queen of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ria, and daughter of Lygda∣mis, possessing, during the minority of her son, sovereign authority, distinguished herself, both by her counsels and her personal valour. Amalasuntha governed with the greatest justice, wisdom, and prudence. Julia Mammaea educated her son, Alexander Severus, im∣planting in his bosom the seeds of virtue, and adorn∣ing him with every princely accomplishment: He was worthy of the high rank to which he was raised, and disposed to become the father of his people: His mother presided in his councils; the era of their ad∣ministration was tumultuous and hazardous, and its
<PB N="211" REF="034162_0877_0FFC5C5E5BAB57F0"/>
disastrous termination is one of the events which the student of history will not fail to deplore.</P>
<P>Zenobia united genius and valour—she was digni∣fied by the title of Augusta. After the demise of her husband, the supreme authority devolving upon her, she governed with rectitude, firmness, and intrepidity. She preserved the provinces in their allegiance, and added Egypt to her dominions. Moreover, when led into captivity, she knew how to <HI>bring into subjection, her feelings; she endured misfortune with the heroism of a no∣ble spirit, and found a solace for the loss of royalty, and the pageantry of a throne, in those rational pursuits, which solitude and freedom from care uninterruptedly permit.</HI> Longinus was her preceptor and friend; and she was worthy of his tuition and preferable attachment. Elizabeth of England was endowed with energetic talents; her reign was glorious for the people over which she presided; she was undoubtedly a great pol∣itician, and governed with uniform vigour; she is characterized as possessing much penetration, and an understanding fruitful of resources; her foreign ne∣gociations were conducted with propriety and dignity; her mind was opened and polished by all the aids of an extensive education, and adversity was among her preceptors. Christina, queen of Sweden, governed her subjects twenty-one years, with uniform wisdom and unimpeached prudence, when she magnanimously resigned her crown; thus giving a rare example of an elevation of intellect, which has not been surpassed.</P>
<P><HI>Tenthly,</HI> and <HI>Lastly,</HI> They are equally susceptible of every literary acquirement. Corinna, it is said, tri∣umphed a fifth time over the immortal Pindar, who had publickly challenged her to contend with him in the poetical line. Sappho, the Lesbian poetess, was admired by the ancients—she produced many poems, and was addressed as the tenth Muse. Sulpicia, a Roman lady, who lived under the reign of Domitian, was called the Roman Sappho. Hypatia, beautiful, learned, and virtuous, the daughter of Theon, presided over the Platonic school at Alexandria, about the close
<PB N="212" REF="034162_0878_0FFC5C5CD8FFE318"/>
of the fourth century; she was judged qualified to succeed her father in that distinguished and important office; her wisdom was held in universal esteem; and from her judgment no one thought proper to appeal: Persons cloathed in public authority, even the first magistrates, deliberated with her on the most urgent and important emergencies; this unavoidably drew around her succeeding circles of men; yet she main∣tained her intercourse with characters of various de∣scriptions, without the shadow of an impeachment of her reputation, until basely traduced, in a <HI>single instance,</HI> by bigotted and interested calumniators. Cassandra, a Venetian lady, attained an accurate skill in lan∣guages, and made great proficiency in the learning of her time; she composed with facility, both in numbers and in prose, in the language of Homer, Virgil, and Dante; she was a proficient in the philosophy of her own and preceding ages; she rendered theology har∣monious; she supported theses with brilliancy; she lectured publickly at Padua; she blended the fine arts with her serious studies; and the mild complacency of her manners constituted the completion of her character: She received homage from sovereign pon∣tiffs, and sovereign princes; and she continued an or∣nament of her Sex, and of humanity, one hundred and two years.</P>
<P>The daughter of Sir Thomas Moore, Mrs. Roper, already cited under the eighth article, whose virtues were polished by literary attainments, corresponded in Latin with the celebrated Erasmus, and successfully appropriated many years of her life to study: Her daughter inherited her erudition, and her amiable qualifications. The Seymours, sisters, and nieces of a king, wrote elegantly in Latin. Isabella of Rosera, in Spain, by her substantial arguments, natural deduc∣tions, and able rhetoric, greatly augmented the num∣ber of believing Jews; the great church of Barcelona was open for the exertion of her pulpitorial abilities; and she acquired much honour by her commentaries upon the learned Scotus. France knew how to esti∣mate
<PB N="213" REF="034162_0879_0FFC5C5643A7D250"/>
the talents of the Dutchess of Retz; she pursued her studies amid the seducing pleasures of a court; and, although young and beautiful, spoke the ancient languages with propriety and elegance. Mary Stuart, queen of Scotland, possessing all the advantages of exterior, and every sexual grace, assiduously cultivated her mind: Her learning was as remarkable as her beauty; she could, we are informed, write and speak six languages; her numbers enchanted the Gallic ear; and, at an early age, she pronounced before the French Court a Latin oration, calculated to convince her hear∣ers, that literary pursuits are proper to the Female Sex. Beauty could not plead in vain; the lovely speaker exemplified, in her own character and attain∣ments, the truth she inculcated; she was, herself, that happy combination, the practicability of which she la∣boured to impress; and conviction undoubtedly irradi∣ated the minds of her audience.</P>
<P>In the thirteenth century, a young lady of Bologna, pursuing, with avidity, the study of the Latin lan∣guage, and the legislative institutions of her country, was able, at the age of twenty-three, to deliver, in the great church of Bologna, a Latin oration, in praise of a deceased person, eminent for virtue; nor was she indebted for the admiration she received, to the indul∣gence granted to her youth, or Sex. At the age of twenty-six, she took the degree of a Doctor of Laws, and commenced her career in this line, by public ex∣positions of the doctrines of Justinian: At the age of thirty, her extraordinary merit raised her to the chair, where she taught the law to an astonishing number of pupils, collected from various nations. She joined to her profound knowledge, sexual modesty, and every feminine accomplishment; yet her personal attractions were absorbed in the magnitude and splendor of her in∣tellectual abilities; and the charms of her exterior only commanded attention, when she ceased to speak. The fourteenth century produced, in the same city, a like example; and the fifteenth continued, and acknowl∣edged
<PB N="214" REF="034162_0880_0FFC5C54B999F8C0"/>
the pretensions of THE SEX, insomuch that a learned chair was appropriated to illustrious women.</P>
<P>Issotta Nogarolla was also an ornament of the fif∣teenth century; and Sarochisa of Naples was deemed worthy of a comparison with Taffo. Modesta Pozzo's defence of her Sex did her honour; she was, herself, an example of excellence. Gabrielle, daughter of a king, found leisure to devote to her pen; and her lit∣erary pursuits contributed to her usefulness and her happiness. Mary de Gournai rendered herself famous by her learning. Guyon, by her writings and her sufferings, hath evinced the justice of her title to im∣mortality. Anna Maria Schurman of Cologne, ap∣pears to have been mistress of all the useful and orna∣mental learning of the age which she adorned: She was born in 1607; her talents unfolded with extraor∣dinary brilliancy: In the bud of her life, at the age of six years, she cut, with her scissors, the most strik∣ing resemblances of every figure which was presented to her view, and they were finished with astonishing neatness. At ten, she was but three hours in learning to embroider. She studied music, painting, sculpture and engraving, and made an admirable proficiency in all those arts. The Hebrew, Greek and Latin lan∣guages were familiar to her; and she made some prog∣ress in the oriental tongues. She perfectly understood French, English and Italian, and expressed herself elo∣quently in all those languages; and she appropriated a portion of her time, to the acquirement of an exten∣sive acquaintance with geography, astronomy, philos∣ophy, and the other sciences: Yet she possessed so much feminine delicacy, and retiring modesty, that her tal∣ents and acquirements had been consigned to oblivion, if Vassius, and other amateurs of literature, had not ushered her, in opposition to her wishes, upon the the∣atre of the world: But when she was once known, persons of erudition, of every description, correspond∣ed with her; and those in the most elevated stations, assiduously sought opportunities of seeing and con∣versing with her.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="034162_0881_0FFC5C5337BD2E28"/>
Mademoiselle Scudery, stimulated by necessity, ren∣dered herself eminent by her writings. Anna de Par∣thenay possessed great virtues, great talents, and great learning; she read, with facility and pleasure, authors in the Greek and Latin languages; she was a rational theologician; she was a perfect mistress of music; and was as remarkable for her vocal powers, as for her ex∣ecution on the various instruments which she attempt∣ed. Catharine de Parthenay, niece to Anna, married to Renatus de Rohan, signalized herself by her atten∣tion to the education of her children; and her mater∣nal cares were crowned with abundant success: Her eldest son was the illustrious Duke of Rohan, who ob∣tained immortal honour by his zeal and exertions in the Protestant cause; and she was also mother to Anna de Rohan, who was as illustrious for her genius and piety, as for her birth. She was mistress of the Hebrew language; her numbers were beautifully ele∣gant; and she supported, with heroic firmness, the ca∣lamities consequent upon the siege of Rochelle.</P>
<P>Mademoiselle le Fevre, celebrated in the literary world by the name of Madame Dacier, gave early testimonies of that fine genius which her father delight∣ed to cultivate. Her edition of Callimachus was re∣ceived with much applause. At the earnest request of the Duke de Montansier, she published an edition of Florus, for the use of the dauphin; she exchanged let∣ters with Christina, queen of Sweden; she devoted herself to the education of her son and daughter, whose progress were proportioned to the abilities of their interested preceptress: Greek and Latin were fa∣miliar to her; and she was often addressed in both those languages, by the literati of Europe. Her trans∣lation of the Iliad was much admired. She is said to have possessed great firmness, generosity, and equality of temper, and to have been remarkable for her piety. Maria de Sevigne appropriated her hours to the in∣struction of her son and daughter; she has enriched the world with eight volumes of letters, which will be read with pleasure by every critic in the French lan∣guage.

The character of Mary II. Queen of Eng∣land, and consort to William of Nassau, is transcend∣ently amiable. She is delineated as a princess, endowed with uncommon powers of mind, and beauty of per∣son. She was extensively acquainted with history, was attached to poetry, and possessed a good taste in compositions of this kind. She had a considerable knowledge in architecture and gardening; and her dignified condescension, and consistent piety, were tru∣ly admirable and praise worthy—Every reader of his∣tory, and lover of virtue, will lament her early exit. The Countess of Pembroke translated from the French, a dramatic piece; she gave a metrical edition of the Book of Psalms, and supported an exalted character.</P>
<P>Anna Killigrew, and Anna Wharton, were eminent, both for poetry and painting; and their unblemished virtue, and exemplary piety, pointed and greatly en∣hanced the value of their other accomplishments. Catharine Phillips was, from early life, a lover of the Muses; she translated Corneille's Tragedy of Pompey into English; and in this, as well as the poems which she published, she was successful. Lady Burleigh, Lady Bacon, Lady Russell, and Mrs. Killigrew, daugh∣ters of Sir Anthony Cook, received from their father a masculine education; and their prodigious improve∣ment was an ample compensation for his paternal in∣dulgence: They were eminent for genius and virtue, and obtained an accurate knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages. The writings of the Dutchess of Newcastle were voluminous; she is produced as the first English lady who attempted what has since been termed polite literature. Lady Halket was remark∣able for her erudition; she was well skilled, both in physic and divinity. Lady Masham, and Mary Astell, reasoned accurately on the most abstract particulars in divinity, and in metaphysics. Lady Grace Gethin was happy in natural genius and a cultivated under∣standing; she was a woman of erudition; and we are informed that, at the age of twenty, "<HI>she treated of life and morals, with the discernment of Socrates, and

<P>WE take leave to repeat, that we are not desirous to array THE SEX in martial habiliments; we do not wish to enlist our women as soldiers; and we request it may be remembered, that we only contend for the <HI>capability</HI> of the female mind to become pos∣sessed of any attainment within the reach of <HI>masculine exertion.</HI> We have produced our witnesses; their dep∣ositions have been heard; the cause is before the pub∣lic; we await their verdict; and, as we entertain all possible veneration for the respectable jury, we shall not dare to appeal from their decision.</P>

We cannot, indeed, obtain a list of the names that have done honour to their Sex, and to humanity, during the period now under observation: The lustre of those minds, still en∣veloped in a veil of mortality, is necessarily muffled and obscure; but the curtain will be thrown back, and posterity will contemplate, with admiration, their manifold perfections. Yet, in many instances, fame

has already lifted her immortalizing trump. Madame de Genlis has added new effulgence to the literary an∣nals of France. This lady unites, in an astonishing degree, both genius and application! May her inde∣fatigable exertions be crowned with the success they so richly merit—May no illiberal prejudices obstruct the progress of her multiplied productions; but, borne along the stream of time, may they continue pleasura∣ble vehicles of instruction, and confer on their inge∣nious author that celebrity to which she is indisputably entitled. France may also justly place among her list of illustrious personages, the luminous name of Ro∣land. Madame Roland comprised, in her own ener∣getic and capacious mind, all those appropriate vir∣tues, which are characterized as masculine and femi∣nine. She not only dignified THE SEX, but human nature in the aggregate; and her memory will be held in veneration, wherever talents, literature, patri∣otism, and uniform heroism, are properly appreciated.</P>
<P>The British Isle is at this moment distinguished by a constellation of the first magnitude. Barbauld, Seward, Cowley, Inchbald, Burney, Smith, Radcliffe, Moore, Williams, Wollstonecraft, &amp;c. &amp;c.—these la∣dies, celebrated for brilliancy of genius and literary attainments, have rendered yet more illustrious the English name.</P>
<P>Nor is America destitute of females, whose abilities and improvements give them an indisputable claim to immortality. It is a fact, established beyond all con∣troversy, that we are indebted for the discovery of our country, to female enterprize, decision, and generosity. The great Columbus, after having in vain solicited the aid of Genoa, France, England, Portugal, and Spain—after having combated, for a period of eight years, with every objection that a want of knowledge could propose, found, at last, his only resource in the pene∣tration and magnanimity of Isabella of Spain, who furnished the equipment, and raised the sums necessary to defray the expenses, on the sale of her own jewels; and while we conceive an action, so honourable to
<PB N="219" REF="034162_0885_0FFC5C44E37D4FD8"/>
THE SEX, hath not been sufficiently applauded, we trust, that the equality of the female intellect to that of their brethren, who have so long usurped an un∣manly and unfounded superiority, will never, in this younger world, be left without a witness. We cannot ascertain the number of ingenious women, who at present adorn our country. In the shade of solitude they perhaps cultivate their own minds, and superin∣tend the education of their children. Our day, we know, is only dawning—But when we contemplate a Warren, a Philenia, an Antonia, a Euphelia, &amp;c. &amp;c. we gratefully acknowledge, that genius and applica∣tion, even in the female line, already gild, with efful∣gent radiance, our blest Aurora.</P>
<P>But women are calculated to shine in other charac∣ters than those adverted to, in the preceding Essays; and with proper attention to their education, and sub∣sequent habits, they might easily attain that independ∣ence, for which a Wollstonecraft hath so energetically contended; the term, <HI>helpless widow,</HI> might be ren∣dered as unfrequent and inapplicable as that of <HI>help∣less widower;</HI> and although we should undoubtedly continue to mourn the dissolution of wedded amity, yet we should derive consolation from the knowledge, that the infant train had still a remaining prop, and that a mother could <HI>assist</HI> as well as <HI>weep</HI> over her offspring.</P>
<P>That women have a talent—a talent which, duly cultivated, would confer that independence, which is demonstrably of incalculable utility, every attentive observer will confess. THE SEX should be taught to depend on their own efforts, for the procurement of an establishment in life. The chance of a matrimonial coadjutor, is no more than a probable contingency; and if they were early accustomed to regard this <HI>un∣certain</HI> event with suitable <HI>indifference,</HI> they would make elections with that deliberation, which would be calcu∣lated to give a more rational prospect of tranquillity. All this we have repeatedly asserted, and all this we do invariably believe. To neglect polishing a gem, or
<PB N="220" REF="034162_0886_0FFC5C43608DA610"/>
obstinately to refuse bringing into action a treasure in our possession, when we might thus accumulate a hand∣some interest, is surely egregiously absurd, and the height of folly. The <HI>united efforts of male and female</HI> might rescue many a family from destruction, which, notwith∣standing the efforts of its <HI>individual</HI> head, is now in∣volved in all the calamities attendant on a dissipated fortune and augmenting debts. It is not possible to educate children in a manner which will render them <HI>too beneficial</HI> to society; and the more we multiply aids to a family, the greater will be the security, that its individuals will not be thrown a burden on the public.</P>
<P>An instance of <HI>female capability,</HI> this moment occurs to memory. In the State of Massachusetts, in a small town, some miles from the metropolis, resides a wo∣man, who hath made astonishing improvements in ag∣riculture. Her mind, in the early part of her life, was but penuriously cultivated, and she grew up al∣most wholly uneducated: But being suffered, during her childhood, to rove at large among her native fields, her limbs expanded, and she acquired a height of stature above the common size; her mind also became invigorated; and her understanding snatched sufficient information, to produce a consciousness of the injury she sustained in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he want of those aids, which should have been furnished in the beginning of her years. She however applied herself diligently to rem∣edy the evil, and soon made great proficiency in writ∣ing, and in arithmetic. She read every thing she could procure; but the impressions adventitiously made on her infant mind still obtained the ascendency. A few rough acres constituted her patrimonial inherit∣ance; these she has brought into a state of high cul∣tivation; their productions are every year both useful and ornamental; she is mistress of agricolation, and is at once a botanist and a florist. The most approved authors in the English language, on these subjects, are in her hands, and she studies them with industry and success.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="034162_0887_0FFC5C3C9C1792F8"/>
She has obtained such a considerable knowledge in the nature of soils, the precise manure which they re∣quire, and their particular adaption to the various fruits of the earth, that she is become the oracle of all the farmers in her vicinity; and when laying out, or appropriating their grounds, they uniformly submit them to her inspection. Her gardens are the resort of all strangers who happen to visit her village; and she is particularly remarkable for a growth of trees, from which, gentlemen, solicitous to enrich their fruit-gardens, or ornament their parterres, are in the habit of supplying themselves; and those trees are, to their ingenious cultivator, a considerable income. Carefully attentive to her nursery, she knows when to transplant, and when to prune; and she perfectly understands the various methods of inoculating and ingrafting. In short, she is a complete <HI>husbandwoman;</HI> and she has, besides, acquired a vast stock of general knowledge, while her judgment has attained such a degree of ma∣turity, as to justify the confidence of the villagers, who are accustomed to consult her on every perplexing emergency.</P>
<P>In the constant use of exercise, she is not corpulent; and she is extremely active, and wonderfully athletic. Instances, almost incredible, are produced of her strength. Indeed, it is not surprising that she is the idol and standing theme of the village, since, with all her uncommon qualifications, she combines a tender∣ness of disposition not to be exceeded. Her extensive acquaintance with herbs, contributes to render her a skilful and truly valuable nurse; and the world never produced a more affectionate, attentive, or faithful woman: Yet, while she feelingly sympathizes with every invalid, she is not herself subject to imaginary complaints; nor does she easily yield to real illness. She has lately been indisposed—and a life so valuable, when endangered, embodied a host of fears for its safety: With difficulty she was persuaded to lie down upon her bed; and the young woman who attended her, and to whom she had endeared herself by a thou∣sand

good offices, after softly closing the shutters and door of her apartment, privately summoned the aid of a physician; and when the medical gentleman made his appearance, she accompanied him to the apartment of her friend; but behold, the bird was flown! and when pursued, she was found at a distance from her habita∣tion, directing some labourers, who were employed in her service, and who, she was fearful, were not suffi∣ciently attentive to her previous instructions. The event proved she had acted judiciously; for, braced by the fresh air, her nerves new strung, assumed their usual tone, her sickness vanished, and her native vig∣our returned.</P>
<P>Although far advanced in years, without a matri∣monial connexion, yet, constantly engaged in useful and interesting pursuits, she manifests not that peevish∣ness and discontent, so frequently attendant on <HI>old maids;</HI> she realizes all that independence which is proper to humanity; and she knows how to set a just value on the blessings she enjoys.</P>
<P>From my treasury of facts, I produce a second in∣stance, equally in point. I have seen letters, written by a lady, an inhabitant of St. Sebastian, (a Spanish emporium) that breathed the true spirit of commerce, and evinced the writer to possess all the integrity, punctuality and dispatch, which are such capital requi∣sites in the mercantile career. This lady is at the head of a firm, of which herself and daughters make up the individuals—Her name is <HI>Birmingham.</HI> She is, I imagine, well known to the commercial part of the United States. She was left a widow in the infancy of her children, who were numerous; and she imme∣diately adopted the most vigorous measures for their emolument. Being a woman of a magnanimous mind, she devoted her sons to the profession of arms; and they were expeditiously disposed of, in a way the best calculated to bring them acquainted with the art of war. Her daughters were educated for business; and, arriving at womanhood, they have long since established themselves into a capital trading-house, of
<PB N="223" REF="034162_0889_0FFC5C37F6D0E5E0"/>
which, as has been observed, their respectable mother is the head. She is, in the hours of business, invaria∣bly to be found in her compting-house; there she takes her morning repast; her daughters act as clerks, (and they are adepts in their office) regularly prepar∣ing the papers and letters, which pass in order under her inspection. She signs herself, in all accounts and letters, <HI>Widow Birmingham;</HI> and this is the address by which she is designated. I have conversed with one of our captains, who has often negociated with her the disposal of large and valuable cargoes. Her consignments, I am told, are to a great amount; and one of the principal merchants in the town of Boston asserts, that he receives from no house in Eu∣rope more satisfactory returns. Upright in their deal∣ings, and unwearied in their application, these ladies possess a right to prosperity; and we trust that their circumstances are as easy, as their conduct is meri∣torious.</P>
<P>"Would you, good Mr. Gleaner, station us in the compting-house?" No, my fair country-women, ex∣cept circumstances unavoidably pointed the way. Again I say, I do but hold up to your view, the <HI>capa∣bility</HI> of your Sex; thus stimulating you to cultivate your talents, to endeavour to acquire general knowl∣edge, and to aim at making yourselves so far acquaint∣ed with some particular branch of business, as that it may, if occasion requires, assist in establishing you above that kind of dependence, against which the free∣born mind so naturally revolts. Far be it from me, to wish to <HI>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sex</HI> you—I am desirous of preserving, by all means, those amiable traits that are considered as characteristic—I reverence the modesty and gentleness of your dispositions—I would not annihilate a single virtue; but I would assiduously augment the faithful∣ness and affection of your bosoms. An elegant pane∣gyrist of your Sex, hath assigned you the superiority in the feelings of the heart; and I cannot more emphat∣ically conclude my subject, than in his beautifully pa∣thetic language:</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="034162_0890_0FFC5C3673FC9418"/>
"The pleasures of women must arise from their vir∣tues. It is by the cradle of their children, and in viewing the smiles of their daughters, or the sports of their sons, that mothers find their happiness. Where are the powerful emotions of nature? Where is the sentiment, at once sublime and pathetic, that carries every feeling to excess? Is it to be found in the frosty indifference, and the sour severity of some fathers? No—but in the warm and affectionate bosom of a <HI>mother.</HI> It is she, who, by an impulse as quick as in∣voluntary, rushes into the flood to preserve a boy, whose imprudence had betrayed him into the waves—It is she, who, in the middle of a conflagration, throws herself across the flames to save a sleeping infant—It is she, who, with dishevelled locks, pale and distract∣ed, embraces with transport, the body of a dead child, pressing its cold lips to her's, as if she would reani∣mate, by her tears and her caresses, the insensible clay. These great expressions of nature—these heart-rending emotions, which fill us at once with wonder, compas∣sion and terror, always have belonged, and always will belong, only to Women. They possess, in those moments, an inexpressible something, which carries them beyond themselves; and they seem to discover to us new souls, above the standard of humanity."</P>

<P>IT was on a serene evening, just as the empress of night commenced her mild career, that Adolphus with folded arms, and a heart on which was impressed
<PB N="225" REF="034162_0891_0FFC5C2E890AD5A8"/>
the most lively traits of devotional gratitude, paced and repaced the sea girt strand of a wealthy emporium, whither he had been carried by the hope of commer∣cial advantage: His bosom was tranquillized by the el∣igibility of his then situation; and the sunny beams of prosperity had invigorated all those gay expectations that, shrinking from the clouds of adversity, prostrate before the storms of life. A ship, the property of A∣dolphus, had a few hours before cast anchor in the stream—the shore resounded the cheerful voices of the mariners, and the dashing of the waves vibrated gratefully on his ear.</P>
<P>Yet the chalice of misfortune had been mixed for A∣dolphus; recently he had tasted the bitter draught, and it was to the humane interposition of strangers that he was indebted for escaping the necessity of swallowing the very dregs. Shipwrecked on a foreign shore—to∣tally unknown, and possessing not a shilling of proper∣ty. He had at this desolate period experienced the utmost energies of philanthropy, and the efforts of be∣nevolence had not only extricated him from that ruin which his circumstances seemed inevitably to involve, but, administering liberally to his necessities, had pro∣cured him eligible accommodations and returned him in safety to his native country. "And oh! exclaimed Adolphus, may I never cease to acknowledge the vast ar∣rearage, by succouring to the utmost of my power every son and daughter of misfortune; and when I shall for∣get to extend to the hapless stranger, whose right is in∣scribed by adversity, a portion of my regards, may I be dead to the pleasures of existence, and may the grate∣ful swell of complacency no more expand my bosom. Gracious God! it is owing to the exertion of that sympathetic glow which thou hast implanted in the breasts of the far distant children of humanity, that my gentle Anna has yet a protecting friend, that my little helpless family again hear the responsive voice of a father, soothing them to peace, and pointing them to the goal of virtue."</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="034162_0892_0FFC5C2B585297D0"/>
Just at this moment, a barge, launching from the shore, was on the point of proceeding to the ship. Adol∣phus hailed the bargemen, and leaping on board, the well plied oar soon produced him beside the Atalanta. Entering the ship, he contemplated for a moment the splendors of a superb evening, with the additional ad∣vantages of a beautifully extensive water prospect. The moon shone forth in full orbed majesty, and he was indulging a most delightful reverie, when his attention was suddenly arrested by an agonizing shriek issuing from the cabin, the accent of which was evidently fem∣inine. Instantly he descended the stairs, when an el∣egant and interesting woman, on whose features was impressed the frenzy of despair, wringing her snowy hands, in a tone of the deepest anguish, exclaimed, "<HI>My God, it is impossible! surely it is impossible</HI>—<HI>some vil∣lain has basely traduced him!</HI>" Again she shrieked aloud, when, raising her eyes with a fearful kind of horror, and observing numbers gather about her, she clasped her hands in evident terror, and her calamitous reflections for a time defeating themselves, she would have sunk lifeless on the floor, had not the attentive Adolphus received her in his arms.</P>
<P>Under his humane direction, every necessary step was taken for her recovery; and she too soon opened her eyes on a world in which her peace had been cru∣elly wrecked. During her suspended animation, he had learned that the immediate cause of her distress proceeded from a verbal message, containing much ap∣parent ingratitude, delivered to her in the name of a per∣son from whom she expected protection, and who she had informed by letter of her arrival. And, with the hope of implanting that confidence which he judged necessary for her situation, he informed her that he himself having been a son of sorrow, his sympathy was the offspring of experience; that the ship and cargo was his property, and that being largely in arrearage to the unfortunate, if she ranked in that truly respectable description, he was ready to discharge his debt to her in whatever mode might best correspond with her wishes.</P>

Astonishment seemed to arrest, in the countenance of the lady, the progress of grief; but assuming an air of dignified composure, she replied: "You must be sensible, Sir, that your address is out of the common course. Accept, however, my grateful thanks for what∣ever of kindness it contains; and be assured that my dis∣tresses are not of a <HI>pecuniary</HI> nature; it is not in your power, Sir, to relieve me. God forbid that in a case of so delicate a nature, I should stand in need of foreign in∣terposition. Unfortunately I have had too many wit∣nesses of a sorrow which is perhaps occasioned by a blameable susceptibility. Those about you can inform you that a misunderstanding hath taken place between my husband and myself; but all will, all must end well. I have been wrong to be so much disquieted, and that sympathy which you mention, induced by polite∣ness, will undoubtedly apologize for me, if I say that I have need of solitude to collect my scattered spirits." Adolphus, after assuring the beautiful unknown that if her future exigencies demanded the extricating hand of a friend, her recognition of him would confer a pleas∣ing obligation, drew from his pocket-his address, and placing it in the hands of her woman, bowed respect∣fully, and, quitting the cabin, took with him those ob∣servers whom her apparent sufferings had drawn thith∣er. Several days revolved, and he continued ignorant of the fate of the lady; for reflecting on the elevated solemnity with which she replied to his proffered aid, he conceived himself obliged in honour to desist from further inquiries. At length, however, the following letter was put into his hand:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 15th, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A GOOD countenance is indeed a letter of recom∣mendation—and that benignity which irradiated your features, when, on the fatal evening of the 1st instant, you took such an apparent interest in the poor unfor∣tunate, who then evidently excited your commisera∣tion, is my security for your continued favour. Alas! for me, that I am reduced to the necessity of a reliance
<PB N="228" REF="034162_0894_0FFC5C252B057168"/>
on one to whose very name, but for my wretched situ∣ation, I had remained a stranger. Yet it is fit you should be furnished with a few leading particulars, relative to the person who now earnestly solicits your protection. Take then, worthy Sir, in few words, the outlines of a life until within these two past years, mark∣ed only by obedience, and consequent tranquillity.</P>
<P>My family name is—, I was born in the capital of Scotland—my father then possessed, and still con∣tinues to fill, an eligible and lucrative public employ∣ment—my mother died at a period when, hushed in the cradle of innocence, I was insensible to every pain or pleasure, not originating in my immediate wants, and her place was so well filled by her successor as to leave my opening reason only natural regrets for this event. The attachment of my parents was apparent∣ly equal, and I was blest by every proper indulgence. Born in affluence, I early received every advantage of which my tender years was susceptible. The impor∣tant era of sixteen found me at a celebrated boarding school, where the ill judged liberties allowed to young ladies too often lay the foundation of misfortunes that terminate not but with their mortal existence. It was during my continuance at this seminary, that I saw and loved the too insinuating Sebastian; his address is easy, his figure manly, and the whole contour of his person strikingly impressive. He made his advances with well dissembled delicacy; his ardent protestations of inviolable love were cloathed in the habiliments of friendship; and when at last his language became more decisive, prepared for a declaration that I wished, I re∣ceived the avowal of his tender attachment with all those demonstrations of complacency which youthful sincerity suggest, and which virgin modesty hesitates not to authorize. Satisfied of the fervour of my own regard, I calculated on a mutual passion, and my lov∣er possessed my unbounded confidence. Fatal delu∣sion! Wretched esservescence of fancy—ye have mis∣erably undone me; and, strange to tell, I live to lament the folly of my too easy faith.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="034162_0895_0FFC5C23A7D309B0"/>
You will observe, Sir, that my path was plain before me, and Sebastian was immediately referred to my father. But what was my astonishment when that father, ever attentive to my best interest, utterly refused to sanction my choice, positively interdicting all future intercourse with Sebastian, and making my continu∣ance at the seminary to depend wholly on my obedi∣ence to his commands. Ah, why did he trust to the discretion of a giddy love-sick girl. I betrayed his honest confidence; and easily finding opportunities of conversing with the seducer, the result of our frequent meetings was a clandestine marriage; but no sooner had I become a wife, than all the daughter rushed on my soul. I fondly loved, revered, and next to adored my father; and it was the cherished hope of obtain∣ing a reconciliation that gave me courage, in the face of a solemn prohibition, to commit an offence that alas! has thrown me out of his protection, and which has, I have every reason to fear, banished me forever from his affections! Every method hath been pursued, both by Sebastian and myself, which we judged might ob∣tain our pardon; but our conciliatory attempts have proved ineffectual. Prayers and expostulations have been in vain—my father, my beloved father continues inexorable! Since the declaration of my marriage, I have never once beheld his benign countenance. My mother, my brothers, and my sisters, alas! his pro∣hibition extends to them also! He refuses to receive my letters; and, when in the perturbation of my soul I still pressed them upon him, they were repeatedly re∣turned unopened, and no language can describe the consequent anguish of my spirit.</P>
<P>During my supplications for a reconciliation, the at∣tention and unrivalled tenderness of my husband con∣tinued unremitted; but at its close I saw, or thought I saw a visible abatement of his kindness! I was, how∣ever, willing to place this circumstance to a natural cause; and, solicitous to believe what was so intimately connected with my <HI>tranquillity,</HI> I persuaded myself that he only took rank with the generality of married men.
<PB N="230" REF="034162_0896_0FFC5C1DC6E06428"/>
It was at this juncture that the decline of my health made it necessary I should take lodgings at Bath, while business detaining Sebastian in London, a temporary separation seemed unavoidable; and I struggled to em∣brace that composure which she who hath swerved capitally from the path of duty will find it very dif∣ficult to regain.</P>
<P>Thus was I circumstanced, when a letter was brought me from Sebastian, acquainting me that he was on the point of embarking for America; that very advantageous proposals had been made him, the emol∣ument of which depended on his immediate closing therewith, and on his collecting together every shilling of property he could command. He entreated me therefore to think favourably of him, and the step he meditated, and to send him as speedily as possible every thing of value that I could conveniently part with. He informed me that he contemplated an establish∣ment in P—; and that on a supposition, my health and inclination would meet his wishes, he had made arrangements for my passage to the new world, on board the Atalanta, which ship was to sail in one month after his embarkation. The letter containing this unexpected intelligence, was replete with expressions of unalterable attachment; and I, who entertained no doubt of my husband's honour, never regarded their sincerity as questionable. The little interest in my gift was cheerfully surrendered—my rings, my jewels of every description, every thing that could be turned into ready money, were all transmitted to the metrop∣olis; and I only reserved my watch, the value of which was enhanced by having been the property of my mother.</P>
<P>With a degree of alacrity, astonishing even to myself, I set about preparing to follow; and I in reality ex∣perienced a degree of satisfaction in the idea of quitting those dear native shores, where I was considered as an alien to those persons whom I shall never cease to re∣vere, and for whom the sigh of my bosom still arose. I left England with those kind of feelings natural to a
<PB N="231" REF="034162_0897_0FFC5C1C41C80A18"/>
daughter and a wife thus circumstanced: But every difficulty was lightened, by the prospect of finding my∣self, at the close of my voyage, under the protection of the man to whom my heart was most passionately de∣voted. I flattered myself that, strangers in this new world, our consequence to each other would necessari∣ly augment; and the halcyon days of mutual love and confidence passed in vision before me.</P>
<P>With the first possible moment after my arrival, I dispatched a line of intelligence to Sebastian, and I re∣ceived, by way of answer, a <HI>verbal declaration, that ex∣cept I could procure a reconciliation with my father, I must never more expect to see his face!!!</HI> You, Sir, witnessed the effect of this astonishing annunciation. Yet, after the first ebullition of grief and surprise had a little sub∣sided, I persuaded myself that it had been worded dur∣ing a moment of insanity; and I thought it became my character to seek an eclaircissement. Obliged as I was by your proffered assistance, my spirit was not then sufficiently broken to submit with composure to my hu∣miliating situation, and I am fearful that I received your unmerited attentions with undue haughtiness; but that delicacy ascribed to your character, will, I trust, enable you to account for my feelings. From the hour of my debarkation I have assiduously sought my husband, but he as studiously avoids me—we have not yet met. I have repeatedly addressed him by letter—I have expostulated, soothed, and entreated, but without effect—his answers are all in one peremp∣tory style—he will never again see me, except my father explicitly approbates our union. My father's admeas∣urement of the mind of this barbarously mercenary man, was, it appears, perfectly just. Repeatedly did the anxious parent assure me that his only object in seeking an alliance with me, was that fortune which he vainly imagined could not be withheld from me. Alas! alas! at this fearful moment, dreadfully do I realize the truth of this sentiment! Sebastian has left this city, and is, I am informed, gone on a party of pleasure to L—. Thither I would pursue him. Could I once more see
<PB N="232" REF="034162_0898_0FFC5C1AA7414930"/>
him, I think I should be satisfied; but I have not the means of a journey, and I have unavoidably contracted debts which it is beyond my power to discharge. What shall I say? In what words shall I clothe my presump∣tuous requests? Possessing your address, I avail myself of your generosity—yet, believe me, worthy stranger, I would never have made this application—my last breath should have issued at the cold shrine of poverty, ere I had thus dared, had not the tongue of informa∣tion ascribed to you <HI>the first of virtues</HI>—<HI>had not I learned that you are wedded to a lovely woman, who possesses all your heart.</HI></P>
<P>I say then, do you lend me your credence? do you admit my narrative as <HI>authentic? Will you pay my debts? Will you hear me to the dwelling of her you love?</HI> L—is your native home, your seat of residence? Thither I am anxious to proceed. <HI>Will you seek out my poor misguided husband, and endeavour to restore him to the path of reason? Will you</HI> do all this? and on a supposition that my earthly father refuses to accept the bill that my necessi∣ties once more impel me to draw on him, <HI>will you be contented to look for reimbursement to the common Parent of humanity?</HI> If you can answer these questions in the af∣firmative, follow the bearer of this tedious scroll, and entitle yourself to the everlasting gratitude of her, who overwhelmed by affliction, rests her last hope on the honour and liberality of a stranger.</P>
<P>Accept, Sir, my warmest wishes for the continuance of your felicity; and withdraw not your supporting countenance from the desolate, and truly wretched</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Adolphus hastened on the fleetest wings of philan∣thropy—every thing the injured Henrietta had re∣quested was exactly attended to. He speedily dis∣patched a letter to his lady, recounting every par∣ticular; and the gentle Anna delayed not to address the fair mourner in those soothing strains of consola∣tion, which an elegant female knows to select, and which, penned by the hand of tender pity, possess an assuasive influence, calculated to blunt the edge of the
<PB N="233" REF="034162_0899_0FFC5C11C9A1F140"/>
most impressive grief. She assured Henrietta that a more welcome guest could not pass her threshold; and she urged her immediately to fly to an abode, the val∣ue of which would be enhanced by her presence. Adol∣phus having accomplished the business that detained him, conducted Henrietta to L—, where she was re∣ceived by his amiable companion, in a manner exactly answerable to his wishes. A series of delicate attentions were uniformly embodied, and no effort was wanting, which it was judged might lessen the chagrin of the un∣fortunate stranger. Sebastian, however, continuing to elude her pursuit, she at length became convinced of his unworthiness; and every vestige of esteem being up∣rooted from her bosom, the tender passion in a mind corrected by misfortunes, of course subsided, and she had no remaining wish but that restoration to her fami∣ly which pardon and reconciliation could alone procure.</P>
<P>Adolphus meditated a voyage to England, and the wishes of Henrietta accelerated his purpose. Arrived on the Albion shore, he procured an introduction to a confidential friend of the father of Henrietta. This friend was in the commercial line, and Adolphus be∣came his customer. He made it the interest of a per∣son so necessary to his views, to visit him at his lodg∣ings; and in the course of a conversation contrived on purpose, he, as if by accident, mentioned Mr.—; in∣quiries relative to his family succeeded. "How many daughters has Mr.—, Sir? Is Miss Eliza his eldest daughter?" "Alas! no—his eldest daughter is a source of much anxiety to her father.—Offending him by an ill-judged marriage, he was for a time inplaca∣ble—and the poor lady hath wandered, we hardly know whither. You seem moved, Sir—surely you are not acquainted with her story!—yet our last knowl∣edge of the lovely fugitive, was her taking shipping for America—and alas! without a protector! Your looks are expressive, Sir—Have you any intelligence to communicate? Have you seen her—heard of her? Where can she be found? Does she live? Is she hap∣py? Speak, Sir! for God's sake, speak."</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="034162_0900_0FFC5C10440A9F48"/>
"I will, Sir, and with happiness proportioned to your own. I left the lady at my house in L—; she was in health, and she constitutes the dearest solace which, during my absence, remains to the partner of my heart." This was enough—the inquirer, rushing from the apartment, was immediately out of sight; and, speed∣ing to the family of Henrietta, her kindred soon throng∣ed about the welcome messenger of peace—father, mother, brothers, sisters, alternately clasped him to their bosoms—grasped his hands—poured fourth their glad orisons to Heaven, and invoked blessings on the instru∣ment of such immeasurable good. Now they eagerly questioned, and anon expressed the unutterable emo∣tion of the heart, by the big tears of pity, love, and gratitude; and their detestation of the villain Sebas∣tian, was only equalled by their admiration of her hu∣mane protector. Gladly would they have endowed him with the better part of their possessions; and the father of Henrietta, particularly, was unbounded in his demonstrations of the rapt enthusiasm of gratitude.</P>
<P>Adolphus returned to America, bearing the olive branch, enriched with the paternal benediction, and con∣veying letters copiously fraught with unreserved love, returning confidence, and the most unequivocal marks of an entire reconciliation. Reiterated invitations were also wafted over—she was conjured to bless once more those native haunts, to take shelter in that pater∣nal abode, where, from the hour of her departure, peace had been a stranger—and the comparatively happy Henrietta only delays her voyage to England, until she can obtain from our Legislators a dissolution of that contract into which she so indiscreetly entered, and which she now so deeply laments.</P>
<P>The Gleaner, while engaged in the routine of office, hath collected the foregoing <HI>well authenticated narrative,</HI> and he imagines it will interest the reader. The intelli∣gent mind will deduce therefrom a lesson. It furnish∣es another instance of the misfortunes attendant on a connexion unsanctioned by duty, of the propriety of obedience, and of the transient duration of love, unsup∣ported by esteem.</P>

<P>WHEN I do not deeply commiserate the un∣happy debtor, in whose bosom probity and punctuality are inmates, I shall be utterly lost to every recollection of the various calamities to which my species are subjected. I do not say that the cred∣itor has not cause of complaint; he either loaned his property from motives of friendship, or he parted with it, indulging an expectation, that it would accumulate an interest which would still augment his stores; and, if he cannot be charged with extortion, the transaction was undoubtedly justifiable: In either of these cases, to despoil him of that which was legally his own, is a disappointment on which he did not calculate, and which must be considered as injurious.</P>
<P>Yet if the creditor is in easy circumstances, and the man in whom he confided is the victim of misfortunes neither to be foreseen nor prevented; if it is notorious that he has ever been upright and open in his dealings; if he continued, to the utmost verge of possibility, punctual in his payments—What then?—Why then I declare, I regard a creditor thus connected and thus circumstanced, as in a very enviable situation. To every benevolent mind, ambitious of accumulating good and proper actions, my reason will be obvious. He is hereby furnished with an opportunity of calling into exercise the noblest faculties which dignify human nature: It is at his option to embody the virtues—he
<PB N="236" REF="034162_0902_0FFC5C0D0B180AC8"/>
can pour into the wounded bosom of the sorrow worn sufferer, the healing balm of consolation—he may even imitate Deity—he can forgive like that God who dealeth liberally, and upbraideth not.</P>
<P>Behold the oppressed man—he is bowed down by calamity—his heart is fashioned by rectitude—it is the sanctuary for every honest principle—but his best con∣certed efforts have proved abortive—misfortunes have issued as a torrent, and they have deluged his most sanguine expectations! With folded arms, contracted brow, and features, on which is imprinted the deepest anguish, he occupies his seat in that apartment where triumphed every refined and virtuous enjoyment, but from which, alas! the face of pleasure seems now forever banished! His gentle, his sympathizing com∣panion—but, strange to tell, her power to soothe is no more!—"Dear source of domestic happiness," he exclaims, "I have undone thee; thy manifold virtues but point the drawn dagger to my soul—every earthly blessing should be thine—but he, in whom thou hast placed thy unbounded confidence, hath miserably failed thee. Ruin hath overtaken me—imprisonment awaits—and for thee and thy dear infants, where, amid this wide unpitying world, will ye find a place of shelter! Gracious Heaven! reflection harrows up my soul; and I tremble on the verge of distraction! God of compassion, vouchsafe to bestow thy consolations on these desolate children of adversity, and calm those sorrows which it is beyond the reach of human wisdom to assuage." The afflicted fair one clasps her hands in speechless agony—her eyes are raised to heaven—she is bathed in tears—and her inarticulated miseries affect beyond description: The affrighted children cluster round—they cannot develop the source of her sufferings, but they behold her exquisitely distressed—their little hearts are attuned to sympathy, and they mingle their infantile cries. With a wild air she presses them alternately to her bosom—she pours forth the maternal benediction, and it is conceived in all the
<PB N="237" REF="034162_0903_0FFC5C0695032E50"/>
energy of sorrow, while a more deeply agonizing scene can hardly be imagined!</P>
<P>Well, Sir, he owes you many thousands—granted—but has he squandered those thousands in unwarrant∣able indulgencies? Has he not been judicious in his plans; industrious in the prosecution of his business; and frugal in his expenditures? and is not this melan∣choly catastrophe produced by events wholly beyond his jurisdiction? Besides, should you take the only step which can heighten his sufferings—should you arrest and throw him into prison—will this pay your debt? will it not rather put it wholly out of his power to make those disbursements which we acknowledge are your due?</P>
<P>See that door—it is more than half open; for those victims of calamity are not solicitous to elude the pursuit of justice, or to hide from the ear of curiosity what they cannot conceal from themselves. For the love of Heaven, dear good Sir, step home; Borne on the wings of benevolence, you will not be long, and prepare a writing which shall remit the debt until the time when a more favourable turn in his affairs may enable him to discharge your demands; and suffer me to entreat, to conjure you, by that Godlike benev∣olence which is at this moment originating in your bosom the noblest purposes, to give the heavenly ema∣nation way—to continue to aid his future efforts—to assist in building him up; and, in addition to the divine expansion which you will thus indulge, you may yet receive more than an equivalent for every benign exertion.</P>
<P>But discretion whispers that you are primarily to study your own convenience, and not imprudently place that property beyond your reach, which your own exigencies may claim. This argument has weight; and if, my dear Sir, there are not expenses you are in the habit of allowing, from which you can, in a small degree, deduct, it must be considered as unanswerable. Suppose, for example, you were to lessen the number of bumpers you swallow in the course of a day; wine,
<PB N="238" REF="034162_0915_0FFC5BD7ED50C4E0"/>
drank in small quantities, operates as a cordial to the languid spirit—it is a noble restorative, possessing even medicinal powers; but a too frequent and copious use thereof, destroys its effect; and in the voluptuous embraces of familiarity its virtues expire. Is not the angel pity an inhabitant in the gentle bosom of your lady? doth not she possess that charming benignity which should ever stand conspicuous in the female character? and are there no articles in her department which she can retrench? Do you go three times a week to the theatre? go but once, and appropriate the four dollars you thus rescue to the necessities of this poor bankrupt; and I dare pronounce that the entertainment you receive at the play-house will pos∣sess augmented charms. In general, it is true, that the infrequency of enjoyments enhance their value, but the pleasures of benevolence never create satiety. A repetition of virtuous actions becomes still more productive of the most refined, delightful and elevating sensations; and the reason is obvious, their origin is celestial; they will bloom immortal in the Paradise of our God.</P>
<P>Well, then, my good Sir, under the auspices of these deductions and regulations, even economy enlists on the side of philanthropy.—Bless me! how expe∣ditiously you have prepared your articles of enlarge∣ment!—But let us not delay—the door, as I said, is more than half open, and we will enter together—The paper is presented—it is seized with a trembling hand—its contents are read aloud—Gracious Heaven! what an astonishing transition! But let me briefly sketch its effects. A shock of electricity could not have been more instantaneous, or more general: The orient beam, succeeding to a night of darkness—No, this will not do—Reader, I have attempted too much—there are scenes, over which a skilful painter will drop the veil—Permit me to relinquish my design—and let it suffice to say, that despair in one glad moment is consigned to oblivion—that the expression of anguish is no more—that the cherub, Hope, throws on every feature its all radiant beams—and the emancipated
<PB N="239" REF="034162_0904_0FFC5C028B1251F0"/>
man has now no struggles but to evince his immeasur∣able sense of obligation, his consequent gratitude, and the indefatigable zeal with which he will henceforward devote himself to the interest of his next to divine cred∣itor. His lovely friend more than partakes his felicity; the sudden tide of joy seems well near to overwhelm her gentle spirit: The children cling around the knees of their common benefactor—intuitively they hail their guardian friend; and they will in future be taught to place his name next to that of Him, who is the alone proper object of religious worship and adoration! Are there, this side the elysium of the blessed, enjoyments more exquisitely delightful, more truly elevating than those which are to be obtained from the contemplation of scenes like this? and, is it not true, that the charac∣ter of him who is in the habit of producing them, ap∣proximates, upon these occasions, to the Author of every good?</P>
<P>The cruelty of imprisoning a man for debt, after he hath yielded the last farthing he possesses, appears to me in a very heinous point of view. It is amazing that there should be on this globe, nations who em∣body in their code of civil regulations, a legal right to commit this great evil! That decree which ranks a man, merely because he hath been unfortunate, with the malefactor who is convicted of capital enormities, is surely detestable, and every idea of rectitude must revolt from its impositions. Liberty is too inestimable a blessing to be abridged, but in cases which involve offences of the deepest dye. <HI>If the insolvent debtor has secreted his property, the ground is then changed</HI>—the affair wears another face—he becomes <HI>criminal,</HI> and must fall into that class of men, whose degeneracy merits condign punishment. But if his actions are <HI>ir∣reproachable,</HI> he is only <HI>unfortunate</HI>—he is entitled to the utmost tenderness; and I would as soon arrest him because he had laid in the grave the wife of his bosom, or the children with whose existence his own seemed inseparably interwoven.</P>
<P>Travellers into the interior parts of our country, inform us there are many tribes and nations on which
<PB N="240" REF="034162_0905_0FFC5C0108A36918"/>
we liberally bestow the epithet <HI>savage</HI> and <HI>barbarous,</HI> that stand astonished at the privileges we annex to wealth, and the consideration with which it is regard∣ed. That <HI>gold</HI> and <HI>silver</HI> should confer <HI>honour</HI> upon its <HI>possessor,</HI> strikes them as a great absurdity; they con∣ceive that an equal distribution of a commodity, <HI>com∣manding the necessaries of life,</HI> would be becoming ra∣tional beings; and when they are told that a deficien∣cy of the glittering mischief, frequently arrests persons in the bloom of life, separates them from all they hold dear, and hurries them away to a dreary confinement, putting a period to those exertions that they are still capable of making, and that might be equally for their own emolument, and the benefit of that society, of which they constitute a part! Listening to such recitals, they question the veracity of the narrator, and when convinced by circumstances of the real existence of this barbarous trait, in the government of those who term themselves the civilized part of mankind—they, in their turn, become accusers; they evince the strong∣est marks of astonishment, and horror; nor do they hesitate in charging the authors of such an injurious institution, with an utter dereliction of every sentiment proper to humanity.</P>
<P>A thought this moment occurs to my mind—Would it not be beneficial, was it made an act of the legis∣lature to appropriate public funds for the relief of the <HI>honest debtor?</HI> would not such a benevolent provision be the best calculated to prevent fraud? and would it not strikingly pourtray that true parental tenderness which ought to be a predominating feature in every government? First, it would prevent fraud; for no persons but those who had <HI>demonstrably</HI> yielded up their last farthing, should be entitled to the benefit of the funds; and thus every sufferer would <HI>become eager to deliver up the whole of his effects:</HI> and secondly, it would be evincive of the parental tenderness of government, for it would hold out to its oppressed children, that last resource, which would prevent their ship-wrecked hopes from total destruction: And it would be well to apportion the sums appropriated, according to the
<PB N="241" REF="034162_0906_0FFC5BF72FCAB5F0"/>
merit, previous situation, and losses of the sufferer; if he had been embarked in enterprises calculated to <HI>promote the public weal—if his exertions had beautified a town or city—if he had sunk beneath the magnitude of an undertaking too arduous for his abilities</HI>—if his education had been liberal—his habits of living, generous—his sentiments refined, and his ideas capacious—if he had parted with a large property, without justly incurring the imputation of extravagance: A man thus circum∣stanced should receive from the appropriated funds, according to the wisdom of the legislature, propor∣tionable assistance. If we are not misinformed, the legislature of one of our sister States, lately granted a lottery to a meritorious citizen who had been emi∣nently unfortunate, for the purpose of paying those just debts, which, through a series of to him disastrous years, had enormously accumulated, and which involv∣ed, in their consequences, many deserving individuals. I would have purchased a ticket in that lottery, although I had been sure it would have proved a blank.</P>
<P>I think it impossible to behold a deserving man sud∣denly precipitated from an eminence which seemed to be his birthright, and reduced to the necessity of ming∣ling with those pensioners of an hour, to whom custom hath rendered their situation tolerable, without the sigh of regret, and the tear of commiseration. What elegant building is that which rears its milk white front with modest dignity? the surrounding prospects are truly picturesque; nothing can be imagined more paradisiacally enchanting, more truly delightful. This well planned and well executed model of architecture, rises on an eminence which commands a handsome street; the views from the different wings of the building present a sketch of both town and country; thus connecting, in idea, with its other advantages, those social pleasures that constitute the most valuable enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>"Pray, has the person, who designed and reared this commodious mansion, continued to occupy it
<PB N="242" REF="034162_0907_0FFC5BF5AC1C1958"/>
many years?" "Alas! no—It is at this moment inhabited by a stranger!!! He, who contemplated this residence as an asylum for his children's children, borne down by a tide of misfortunes, after relinquish∣ing his last penny to clamorous creditors—after con∣tinuing immured within the walls of those apartments during many gloomy months, a close prisoner, hath at last removed with a wife, whose merits entitle her to the first distinction, and a family truly amiable—this oppressed and disappointed man hath removed"—"Where, where hath he removed?"—"He now occu∣pies, in an obscure part of the city, inconvenient lodg∣ings, up three pair of stairs!!!"</P>
<P>Alas! alas! how distressing are these vicissitudes! and how worthy the efforts of a virtuous community, bound together by the bands of fraternity, and seeking to promote that <HI>kind of equality which is the offspring of reason</HI>—How worthy the efforts of such a people, to devise for so heart affecting an evil, a suitable remedy.</P>

man a shilling." This was well—But if Commodus could have added, that, with each revolving year, he reserved something as the resource of accident, or by way of making provision for those days, in which the <HI>grasshopper becomes a burden,</HI> it would have been better. In the winter of life, how inadequate are human ef∣forts, either to cater for the wants of the body, or to gather in that celestial food, so necessary for the im∣mortal spirit, <HI>then oppressed by its connexion with a debil∣itated mass of matter, which, verging on dissolution, of ne∣cessity impedes the powers it envelops.</HI> The spirit, <HI>ema∣nating from the fountain of life,</HI> and embodied by its clay-built tenement, must generally find the operation of its faculties conformable to the constitution of those agents, <HI>by which it is to effect its purposes;</HI> and hence it follows, that an enervated, or aged body, <HI>retards,</HI> if not wholly <HI>suspends,</HI> (except in instances of uncommon energy of understanding) the <HI>visible</HI> manifestation of those abilities, still inherent in the soul.</P>
<P>I scarcely know a more melancholy object than <HI>old age, combining poverty and disease!</HI> To depend, for our daily bread, on the caprices of those about us, is a situation, at all times, and in every view, sufficiently painful: But it must be peculiarly so, to those who have been accustomed, in youth, to administer to their own necessities. I should regard dependence, even on my children, as a painful circumstance. It is natural for a parent to <HI>bestow protection and support;</HI> and when these benefits become retrograde, we are subjected to that kind of shock, which an inversion of the laws of nature usually creates.</P>
<P>Is there, whose feelings are attuned by complacen∣cy, while a family of the following description passes in review before him? Its principal is in the meridian of his days; and he is supposed to have filled his part, in the various scenes in which he has been called to act, with propriety, and with honour—he is rearing to ma∣turity, a number of sons and daughters—and he has, besides, taken to his dwelling, the old man and woman who are the authors of his being. Age has been de∣nominated
<PB N="244" REF="034162_0909_0FFC5BF0CD229068"/>
a state of second childhood; and, perhaps, aged persons may be so circumstanced, as to stand in need of the utmost tenderness.</P>
<P>Observe, now, the regulations in this little commu∣nity. The children are nurtured by indulgence—their wants, and even their caprices, obtain attention—their infantile prattle is enchanting—their wonderfully apt sayings, and the strength of memory they evince, are copious themes, which arrest the ear, and monopolize almost the whole attention, of every visitor—their ques∣tions are never considered as impertinent—they are commended for a laudable curiosity, and responded to with patience—At table, their appetites are consulted—mamma reserves every choice bit for them—and the deference they injudiciously receive, too often renders them tyrants in miniature. Does sickness show its pale face among them?—the distracted parents would move the universe in favour of the little sufferers—with unwearied supplications they assail the ear of Heaven; and on heir restoration to health, joy rekindles in their bosoms.</P>
<P>But let us reverse the picture. Behold the venera∣ble pair!—Mark! with what hesitancy and manifest perturbation they make known those wishes, which in∣volve the smallest alteration in their situation—their most rational requests are characterized as unjustifiable complainings; <HI>and the utter impossibility of pleasing old people,</HI> is expatiated on, with all the aggravating re∣dundancy of language. Remarks, originating in the wisdom of years, are delineated as the tiresome lo∣quacity of old age; and, if they attempt to retrace those scenes, in which they passed the morning of their lives, the symptomatic garrulity is made the subject of petulant ridicule. Neglected, and consequently deso∣late, they seem as if of another, and inferior, class of beings—or if, willing to take a part in what is passing, they question, or remark, they are either accused of tiresome inquisitiveness, or are heard with a contemp∣tuous kind of silence. If they are delicate in the choice of their viands, they are pronounced intolera∣bly
<PB N="245" REF="034162_0910_0FFC5BEBB3A0DBA0"/>
burdensome, while every look and gesture seems to say—"<HI>You have occupied your stations on this globe long enough, and you should not delay descending into that grave, on which you seem to totter.</HI>" Should their accu∣mulating infirmities confine them to beds of anguish, even the penurious attendance they receive, is rather the result of duty, than inclination, while their return to a state of convalescence is marked by no soothing congratulations; and the melancholy, the venerable sufferers, have only to lament in concert their humil∣iating situation, and to regret, that the efforts of those years, during which they possessed the ability, did not secure a sufficiency to insure that degree of independ∣ence, which might have prolonged their enjoyments, and continued their respectability: Yet does that son, whose dawn of being they watched with tender pa∣rental solicitude, obtain, from the general voice, a large share of applause, for the <HI>filial duty</HI> with which he supports his aged, and otherwise destitute, parents.</P>
<P>Reader—this is not a far-fetched or high-coloured picture. The Gleaner has witnessed instances, even more aggravated than the example he produces; and while he is aware, that there are persons, figuring as splendid ornaments of humanity, who have derived their highest enjoyments from "<HI>rocking the cradle of declining age,</HI>" he must, nevertheless, continue to de∣plore the melancholy circumstances, to which <HI>old age and dependence</HI> are too frequently subjected.</P>
<P>A spirit of independence has been regarded as na∣tal in the bosom of Americans. We would rouse the latent spark, and stimulate our countrymen to become, as far as a state of society will admit, consistently in∣dependent. Do not leave contingencies to answer en∣tirely for themselves—cultivate habits of industry, and combine economy. If, in the full bloom of youth, and all the vigour of health, your abilities can no more than answer your exigencies, where are the re∣sources of sickness, and of age?—<HI>It is proper you should reflect</HI>—and it will be well to remember, that small sums, deducted from the expenses of every day, and
<PB N="246" REF="034162_0911_0FFC5BEA2D2D6248"/>
judiciously laid out, may accumulate a fund, which may serve as the richest solace to the winter of life. Europeans charge Americans with a ridiculous, if not an unwarrantable, kind of extravagance. We are ap∣prehensive, the accusation is not wholly ill founded. If our information is accurate, the Parisians, possest of property, to an amount which would almost seem incredible to an American ear, receive our first charac∣ters, not even excepting those in the diplomatic line, with abundance of civility, indeed; but their enter∣tainments are as little burdened with expense as possible—they consist, generally, of soups in their variety, and such showy trifles, as stand them in a very small amount—and if the Londoner adds a pudding to his surloin, his guest must be of no ordinary description. On the other hand, Europeans, visiting an American metrop∣olis, stand astonished at the lavish profusion every where displayed.
<Q><L>Our tables groan with piles of costly food,</L>
<L>And all is more than hospitably good.</L></Q>
But it is not in the provisions of the table exclusively, that we are thus remarkably profuse. Buildings, fur∣niture, equipage, dress, and public amusements—Is it not to be feared that, in all these particulars, many of our citizens exceed their income? and are we not ad∣vanced in the arts of luxury, whole centuries further than is proper to an infant nation, still struggling un∣der many burdens, and laudably solicitous to raise and equip that navy, which may serve as a defence to our extensive sea-coast?</P>
<P>Let not the reader imagine, we are seeking to ren∣der him niggardly penurious—God forbid. We would have him open as the light of heaven to the <HI>real necessities</HI> of a fellow-creature: and for <HI>this reason,</HI> he should be constantly in the exercise of that econo∣my, which is undoubtedly closely allied to generosity. The consequence of American extravagance, is pre∣cisely that which reflection would predict. Property is continually fluctuating; and it is observed, that an inheritance, however ample and productive, is rarely
<PB N="247" REF="034162_0912_0FFC5BE38C9FA8B0"/>
found in the same family, to the third or fourth gen∣eration. Persons, we are informed, who are citizens either of France or Great-Britain, and who possess, in their own right, an easy competency, do not usually consider either the principal or the interest, as the proper resource of health and vigour: <HI>The exigencies of the day are supplied by present industry;</HI> and the funds already acquired are reserved as the solace of that fu∣turity, during which, it is almost certain, they will become unequal to any arduous undertaking. Their sons and daughters are early taught the useful arts of diligence and economy; they soon become sensible of the value of independence, and are elevated by the consideration, that it is, in an important sense, within their reach.</P>
<P>A refugee, quitting her native country, during the late contention between England and her, then, colo∣nies, obtained, after landing upon the Albion shore, a commodious situation in the city of Bristol. She was a woman of observation, and, by consequence, of in∣formation; and her remarks on the manners and cus∣toms of the people, among which she was so unexpect∣edly placed, were judicious, and worthy of that solid∣ity and penetration, which were conspicuous traits in her character. But, among the various observations she was from time to time induced to make, no cir∣cumstance astonished her so much, as the frugality and unremitted application of persons possessing property, which, in America, would have been judged a suffi∣cient foundation for the full indulgence of the appen∣dages of luxury; And among other instances of this description, which she collected, she often mentioned with admiration, a young woman, enjoying, in her own right, several thousand pounds sterling, which were absolutely at her own command, who, to her great surprise, earnestly solicited the favour of being employed as her milliner.</P>
<P>Captain L—lately gratified me by a recital, for the truth of which he pledged that honour that hath never yet been forfeited. While he lay on the river
<PB N="248" REF="034162_0913_0FFC5BE206B9A630"/>
Thames, among the watermen who <HI>industriously</HI> ply on that celebrated stream, was a Mr. Swale, who distin∣guished himself for his integrity, <HI>diligence,</HI> and punc∣tuality. He was particularly attached to my friend, taking in his movements a decided interest, and dis∣daining to avail himself of those advantages, which youth and inexperience seemed to have placed within his reach. His demands were never exorbitant; and he took care to guard our young adventurer against those frauds, to which he might probably be subjected from persons less scrupulous. In short, the services rendered by Mr. Swale were many and important; he was ever upon the wing to execute his wishes, and would hasten with alacrity on messages of the most in∣significant or trivial import. Neither the dress nor appearance of Mr. Swale varied essentially from the brethren of his order. He kept a kind of ordinary, whither the officers of those ships, laying in his vicin∣ity, frequently repaired, for the purpose of taking those occasional refreshments that their exigencies required.</P>
<P>Captain L—was surprised to find Mr. Swale oft∣en refusing, from those to whom he professed an at∣tachment, any compensation for the articles which he furnished; and his fears, that the man might eventu∣ally become the victim of his own liberality, induced him to press on him the full price for every repast he had taken in his ordinary. Mr. Swale was a general favourite with the American commanders, then lying on the river—there was something clever about the man—and his facetious good humour, with the cheer∣ful alacrity with which he accommodated himself to their wishes, induced them frequently to solicit his so∣ciety when they met at the ordinary. It was at one of those unceremonious associations, that Captain L—expressed to a comrade his regret, that his ship could not proceed on her voyage, until he had received sev∣eral hundred pounds, which would, at the expiration of a certain number of days, be due on the bills in his possession. He observed, that he had fully accom∣plished every other part of his business; and while
<PB N="249" REF="034162_0914_0FFC5BDBB23E7510"/>
he calculated the probable damage the detention might occasion, he lamented the loss of those favourable gales which seemed to invite his departure.</P>
<P>"Make yourself easy, Captain," replied Mr. Swale, "the money is at your service—give me the bills—re∣ceive from me their value—hoist your sails—and God send you a prosperous voyage." Captain L—eyed the waterman with a look of incredulity and surprise: He was at a loss how to understand him—Was he in∣dulging that vein of humour for which he was so re∣markable? Was his benevolence so far interested, as to stimulate him to <HI>attempt</HI> borrowing the money? or, could he really command the sum in question? My young friend wears an honest countenance, and the perplexity of his mind being impressed on his fea∣tures, Mr. Swale added: "O! upon my troth, Cap∣tain, it is true—your waterman would advance a much larger sum, to help an honest man, impatient to return to his family and friends: The money, as I told you, shall be ready at a minute's warning; and we will scorn to make any words about it."</P>
<P>Captain L—, divided, between admiration of the waterman's generosity, and astonishment at his ability, contented himself by expressing, in general terms, his gratitude, and immediately went in search of a person, who had offered to advance the money, upon a con∣sideration which he had deemed exorbitant: Yet, the urgency of his affairs had necessitated him to balance in his mind, the probable consequences of acceptance or rejection; and he had determined to come to a con∣clusion that very evening. He related to the usurer Swale's offer, and the commercial gentleman replied: "Ah! that Swale has taken many a guinea out of my pocket; he possesses forty thousand pounds ster∣ling, independent of the world; and he is eternally engaged in acts of this kind, for which we dealers in money owe him little thanks." Captain L—re∣turned, accepted the generosity of the waterman, who appeared overjoyed in an opportunity of obliging him,

weighed anchor, and departed, bestowing a hearty benediction upon <HI>industry and benevolence.</HI></P>
<P>And such is the order of events. Industry, con∣sorted with frugality, prepares the funds of benevo∣lence; and thus we are put in possession, not only of <HI>independence, but of the means of conferring the most essen∣tial benefits.</HI></P>

<P>IT may be a question whether the opinion that riches <HI>necessarily</HI> contract and indurate the heart, is the result of accurate investigation, or whether in the first instance, hastily adopted, it has not rather, like many other positions, obtained respectability from its anti∣quity and almost general reception. For myself, I must confess that I regard the <HI>truly virtuous man as superior even to the ensnaring blandishments of prosperity;</HI> and I have imagined his proper and beneficent actions <HI>circumscribed only by his power.</HI></P>
<P>If it is certain that riches do inevitably prostrate the best affections of the soul, it is incumbent upon us to avoid, by every means, the accumulation of wealth, and we should admonish our children to shun a precipice so replete with danger.</P>
<P>Persons filling eminent stations, and possessing afflu∣ence, are <HI>thus rendered conspicuous:</HI> Their good and bad deeds are the subjects of observation—<HI>depraved minds dwell with malicious satisfaction on the latter,</HI> and every unfeeling trait is attributed to the <HI>contagion of circum∣stances.</HI> But were the different ranks of men to pass
<PB N="251" REF="034162_0917_0FFC5BD308D22DC0"/>
in review before us, we might find reason to lament, in individuals of every rank, a similarity of disposition. Nature would probably appear equal in her distribu∣tions, while we were constrained to acknowledge that <HI>Virtue</HI> continued <HI>Virtue,</HI> even on a throne; and that, although retired to those sequestered haunts, where the splendor of opulence darted not even an oblique ray, <HI>Vice, nevertheless, retained its original deformity.</HI></P>
<P>Applied to, on a certain occasion, by a female in distressed circumstances, for pecuniary assistance, the state of my finances at that time would not admit of my affording the sufferer any considerable relief; and, although I was on easy terms with many persons in affluence, whom I felt strongly impelled to address, yet accustomed to consider <HI>riches as steeling the heart,</HI> I conceived that, wafted on the stream of pleasure, and marking their hours only by a succession of enjoyments, they would hardly find leisure for a tale of sorrow. "<HI>I advise you not to think of soliciting the great;</HI>" said Cynicus, "take my word for it your supplications will be ineffectual; and you will besides subject yourself to ridicule, if not to more serious reprehension." I was before hesitating, relative to the utility of an experi∣ment which I was constrained to confess assumed a very unpromising aspect; and the sentiments of Cyni∣cus were not calculated to stimulate my efforts. Ca∣lamity, however, pressing hard on my supplicant, the pleadings of commiseration were not to be resisted; and I boldly resolved on an immediate appeal to the feelings of my honourable acquaintance.</P>
<P>It was, I recollect, a charming morning in the month of june—and the hours from nine to one were devot∣ed to the prosecution of my design. I do not know that there is a period of my life, on which I can reflect with more rational and complete satisfaction. The sen∣sations consequent on an observation of those benign propensities which occasionally operate on the human intellect, on propensities which unquestionably ema∣nate from the Divine Author of every good, are im∣measurably delightful. To the parlours of the opu∣lent
<PB N="252" REF="034162_0918_0FFC5BCE915D57D0"/>
I found a ready admittance, nor was I excluded even from the <HI>bed side of the invalid.</HI> If I were at lib∣erty to give names, and to delineate circumstantially, I could a tale unfold, at which the lover of humanity would exult, and the heart of sensibility be made glad. It is with difficulty I check the ardour of my feelings—I would emblazon deeds of worth—I would present them to a listening world; and thus enkindle the glow of emulation. Yet, circumscribed by the prohibitions of delicacy, I am only permitted to say, that I narrat∣ed particulars, and was heard with respectful attention; that the angel pity became my advocate, and tears of commiseration streamed from many an eye; that my application was received with <HI>acknowledgments—every individual expressing a sense of obligation for the opportunity afforded of relieving a child of sorrow.</HI> Yes, the feelings of benevolence were benignly excited; exertions were cheerful, prompt and copious; and the exigencies of a distressed and desolate petitioner were amply supplied.</P>
<P>I am sensible it would be easy to produce a contrast to this successful morning; and an instance of <HI>penurious opulence,</HI> this moment glides along the avenues of rec∣ollection. Paucius is advanced in years—it is beyond his power to expend his income—he has no child, and his accumulating infirmities must very soon lay him in the grave. Yet Paucius has never been detected in a <HI>voluntary</HI> contribution to the relief of the necessitous; and the annual tribute for charitable appropriations, which the regulations of society extort from him, is yielded with no common pangs! Some business, rela∣tive to a mortgage, <HI>the day of redemption having ex∣pired,</HI> obliged him, on a severe morning in January, to leave home very early. It was a critical moment—he stepped into his chariot without breakfast—and, being in haste, he was not so well guarded against the inclem∣ency of the weather, as he would otherwise have been: He however arrived at the destined village, felicitating himself that he was in <HI>time to put the patrimony of a fe∣male orphan beyond her reach;</HI> and, having thus <HI>pleas∣antly finished the affair,</HI> he resolved to return home by a
<PB N="253" REF="034162_0919_0FFC5BCD0B7A1C40"/>
shorter road. But, mark the folly of human wisdom—John, unacquainted with the new route, lost his way; and keeping his master abroad a full hour beyond his ex∣pectation, our <HI>poor hero</HI> was well nigh perishing with cold and hunger. Conscience, that faithful vicegerent, ever opportune in its admonitions, forcibly impres∣sed on his mind the distresses of those children of penury who were doomed, with each revolving day, to reiterate sufferings that he now found almost insup∣portable. What wonders are wrought by sympathy! In a tremulous voice he addressed his servant:</P>
<P>"<HI>John, it is a bitter day—a bitter day, John;</HI> remem∣ber, when I get home, that I send poor James's wife and children a little fuel; and, do you hear, I will add something for a breakfast too! <HI>Heaven help us; we shall not live here always!</HI> I say, John, you will be sure to remember!" John stared, doubted, and replied, "<HI>Yes, Sir, I will be sure to remember;</HI>" and, lashing his horses, he proceeded with more than usual rapidity, until he produced his master at the gate of his own dwelling. Paucius entered—the armed chair, the blazing hearth, the smoaking kettle, and well spread table, awaited his coming—he fed luxuriously. John, too, made his breakfast, and, bowing most submissively, informed his master that he was ready to convey his bounty to the family of James. "Stop, John—stop, John," cried Paucius, "we will defer what we were speaking of—It is no matter now, child, <HI>the weather is quite moderate to what it was, and I dare say the wind will soon be southerly.</HI>"</P>
<P>No, I do not affirm that benevolence predominates in every instance. Would to God that I could thus pronounce. I only contend that it is found <HI>indiscrimi∣nately</HI> with rich and poor; and that it is neither con∣ferred nor diminished by wealth.</P>
<P>Two days since, as I was chatting with Marcella, in a little sanctuary where she receives her supplicants, a female assistant introduced a sorrow-worn veteran; he bowed low to Marcella; the lines of his expressive countenance were affectingly marked; and while he
<PB N="254" REF="034162_0920_0FFC5BC54EB30408"/>
addressed her, (whose patronage he solicited) the dig∣nity of the soldier, still strikingly visible, was strongly contrasted by a deep sense of humiliation. "I am a poor man, Madam—<HI>I was engaged in defending the lib∣erties of America—I lost my right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a cannon-ball at the battle of Bunker Hill</HI>—I have a sick wife, and a fami∣ly of suffering children—my health is gone—I am old, Madam—there is a cold winter coming on; and I am a petitioner to persons of ability for the means of liv∣ing." What an appeal to the feelings of an Ameri∣can! But Marcella is governed by reason; she does not indiscriminately lavish the bounty of Heaven; she made the proper inquiries; her chariot was ordered out; on that very afternoon she visited the family of the soldier; his report was just; and both he, and his, are entered among those who are entitled to her bounty.</P>
<P>I repeat, it is pleasant to record instances of benigni∣ty; and, on this subject, thought produces thought, while many a little anecdote presses on my memory. An interesting female, long since numbered with the dead, now meets my view. Her figure is still before me—tall, thin, and emaciated almost to a skeleton—poverty, loss of friends, and wasting sickness, had done more toward furrowing her check, than the gently in∣denting hand of time. She was a widow, and her chil∣dren were all helpless; her manners were simple and unadorned; she was altogether void of affectation; and I believe she could not have fabricated an untruth, al∣though she might thus have succeeded to much wealth. It did not seem her aim to move the passions: She only observed, while holding in her trembling hand a small parcel of powdered maize—(and she delivered herself in a tone of uncommon humility and resignation) "<HI>I have worked diligently during this long day, and this is all I have gotten.</HI>" There was something in her countenance which pointed her words; and a languid beam, escap∣ing from her expressive eye, forcibly made its appeal to the heart. It happened that I was, at that moment, seated in the bow window in the parlour of Amanda,
<PB N="255" REF="034162_0921_0FFC5BC227840EF0"/>
while that lovely woman, standing in the door, was giving some directions to her gardener. The pity mov∣ing female had placed one foot on the lower stone of a flight of steps which led to the house, when she uttered the before cited sentence—"<HI>I have worked diligently dur∣ing this long day, and this is all (holding up the maize) that I have gotten.</HI>" "Step in, honest friend," said Aman∣da, (and Heaven bless you, involuntarily exclaimed my heart) "you seem not well able to labour; accept this glass of wine, it will do you good."</P>
<P>The poor woman waited not for entreaty; with an air of genuine gratitude she swallowed the draught. "Thank you, Madam; your wine is a cordial to which I have not of late been used." "Take a seat," cried Amanda, "<HI>I wish to converse with you.</HI>" The patient sufferer raised her eyes with an expression of astonish∣ment; and, glancing on her time-worn vestments the glow of sensibility, which instantly pervaded her fea∣tures, seemed to say, "Alas! alas! I dare not avail myself of your condescension." Amanda could read the countenance—"<HI>No matter,</HI>" she rejoined, "I do not accept your apology; your garments are vouchers of your industry—I wish to know if you have any children?"—"Yes, indeed, Madam, I have no less than <HI>six</HI> children, and they are all young: We did bravely as long as Robert lived and was able to labour; but he fell sick and died, and all that we had was not more than sufficient to lay him in the ground; yet, after a while, we did well again, until I caught a fever which left me very low, but I am now getting better; my children, I bless God, are all well; and I would not part with one of them, if I might gain the riches of the world; this meal will once more satisfy their hunger: and, after all, it might have been worse—He that made us, will, I doubt not, provide for us; and we shall hereafter meet Robert again in a better world." Her apparent tranquillity and <HI>genuine piety</HI> was extreme∣ly affecting. Amanda took out her purse—She consult∣ed in her benefaction her own liberal heart; while the indigent sufferer, bursting into tears, attempted in
<PB N="256" REF="034162_0922_0FFC5BC0A35FC170"/>
vain to give utterance to her feelings. Amanda con∣tinued to watch over this daughter of sorrow—she visited her at her cottage—she contributed largely to her support—her consolatory soothings mitigated the pangs of dissolving nature, and she is still the friend of her children.</P>
<P>Is it possible that the utmost malice of fortune can involve Amanda in a situation which will deprive her of the rapturous glow of self-complacency, while she reflects on this transaction? But the life of Amanda hath exhibited an unbroken series of well-judged char∣ities.</P>
<P>I turn over another leaf, and a new scene presents: A debtor, once immured within the walls of a prison, now hails the incalculable blessings of light and liberty. He made application, by letter, to the teacher of a religious society, supplicating for some <HI>small pecuniary assistance during his captivity.</HI> It was on a Sabbath Day, just when the man of God was ascending the sacred desk, that the address was put into his hands; and, adapting his discourse to the situation of the pris∣oner, he introduced and pathetically expatiated there∣on. Every word he uttered was pointed to the hearts of his hearers; and, glowing with benevolence, a number of those, whose abilities corresponded with the liberality of their sentiments, assembled in the ves∣try, where they cheerfully made up a sum more than sufficient to procure the enlargement of the unhappy solicitor. The deputed committee repaired expedi∣tiously to the prison, the money was deposited, and the overplus presented to the captive, who, thus un∣expectedly liberated from a comfortless confinement, was suddenly restored to a beloved family, which had been nearly overwhelmed by despair. The whole of this business was planned and accomplished within three revolving hours; it seems to have been conduct∣ed in the true spirit of Christianity, and is highly wor∣thy of imitation.</P>
<P>Eugenio was a principal in the affair; but to Eugenio acts of kindness are familiar; I rejoice that he takes rank in the circle of my religious friends;
<PB N="257" REF="034162_0923_0FFC5BBF1D724CB0"/>
he makes it a rule to recompense injuries, as often as it is in his power, by a pecuniary benefaction. A person, not long since, who was a stranger to his uncommon virtues, entirely misconceived an interest∣ing transaction, and became in consequence his im∣placable enemy. It was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain that Eugenio assayed to justify himself; his foe was rude, vehement, and highly imprudent, and he lost no opportunity of in∣veighing against him. Eugenio assured him that he would embrace the first occasion of seeking revenge; and he advised him, therefore, to be more sparing of his invectives. Thus, for some time, they proceeded; the aggressor adding to, and aggravating his offences, and the aggrieved as constantly avowing his vindictive purposes. Misfortunes at length overtook the angry man; "<HI>woes do indeed too often cluster;</HI>" he was strip∣ped of the means of living, and confined a close prison∣er within the <HI>bare walls</HI> of a little tenement, which alone remained to him.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenio's hour of retribution was at length arrived;</HI> he immediately took in his affairs an active part; he approached him with that kind of respect, which true benevolence knows to pay to the children of adversity; he liberally administered to his necessities, and he con∣tributed largely to his re-establishment. The first visit Eugenio paid to the dejected and deeply humbled man was inexpressibly affecting; his resentments were all prostrated, malice was disarmed, admiration triumph∣ed—and as he folded his exalted benefactor to his bos∣om, tears of unfeigned contrition bedewed his cheeks.—How noble was the revenge of Eugenio.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CONFESS myself a convert to the opinion I last evening pertinaciously combated—Tranquillity of mind is not <HI>necessarily</HI> either conferred or destroyed by <HI>exter∣nal circumstances.</HI> Mrs. Hamilton, with beautiful mod∣esty,
<PB N="258" REF="034162_0924_0FFC5BBD95EABBA8"/>
advocated this sentiment; and although you continued silent, your approbation of your daughter's arguments was strongly expressed in your countenance.</P>
<P>My morning's ramble has produced a conviction that I hasten to acknowledge; for I am anxious to support an hypothesis, which I now conceive stamped with truth and reason. The storm having subsided, the keen severity of the air, operating as a bracer, gave a very high tone to my spirits, and I determined to look in on a number of my connexions. I shall not aim at giving you a regular detail of my visits—two only are to my present purpose.</P>
<P>The first was made to an old gentleman, who for the greater part of his life has enjoyed every thing which competence can bestow; but reduced by a se∣ries of misfortunes to penury, after having numbered more than threescore and ten years, he is now pennyless! he has taken shelter in a single apartment suited to his circumstances; and I found him alone, hovering over the remains of a coal fire, but ill calculated for a tenement much out of repair, and a season so truly in∣clement. I looked around, no vestige of sustenance of any description appeared; I suspected he was wholly destitute of the necessaries of life; and although I felt myself incapable of uttering a syllable, my distress was deeply marked upon my features; he read my concern, and laying his spread hand upon his bosom, with a smile of ineffable complacency, he gratefully said—</P>
<P>"Ah my friend, you are mistaken; it is true, for those three days and nights during which the storm hath continued, I have not seen a human face; it is true, that my pitcher of water, and a small portion of bread, the last of which I have just swallowed, hath been my only sustenance; but never have I passed three more happy days. Stretched on that little bed, or traversing up and down this lonely recess, <HI>I have enjoyed sweet communion with my Maker; the bliss of heaven is begun in my bosom; I have, Sir, no regrets, no apprehensions, no impatience; I am all blessed hope, rap∣turous anticipation, and calm resignation.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="034162_0925_0FFC5BBC0FDE31E0"/>
I was beyond measure astonished; and, solicitous still to detain the saint, who seemed on the wing to depart, I instantly quitted his abode; and, entering she mansion of a son of affluence, the blazing hearth triumphed over the rigours of the season. Nature, in a variety of her most beautiful productions, bloomed around; the birds warbled enchantingly in their gild∣ed enclosures, and the genial month of June seemed suddenly restored.</P>
<P>"<HI>Where is your master?" "He is very ill, Sir.</HI>" I sighed from a double motive; but I was admitted, on sending up my name. I found my opulent friend deeply suffering from indisposition of body, and irre∣pressible inquietude of mind; surely, thought I, Mrs. Hamilton is right. His disease was the erysipelas. "I am sorry, Sir, to find you so much indisposed." "Oh faith, I shall never love the name of a saint again as long as I live, this same Saint Anthony has used me so scurvily." "It is a pity indeed you are not be∣low, you have quite an <HI>artificial</HI> summer there." "Yes, faith; but many honest people in this town feel it to be a very <HI>natural</HI> winter for all that." "True, Sir; and I have this moment witnessed a scene which corroborates your assertion."</P>
<P>I then gave in my little narrative; my affluent friend was benevolent and liberal; the disorders of his mind and body seemed to suspend their progress, and he eagerly replied, "I remember this same old gentle∣man lent me, when I was a boy, fourteen pense; now I do not believe I ever paid him that little sum; please to open that draw, take them crowns, and beg his accept∣ance; <HI>they may answer both principal and interest.</HI>" He instantly rung the bell—Thomas appeared, who was commissioned immediately to convey to Mr.—a variety of necessary articles, to add thereto <HI>a bottle of that old spirit, reserved for special occasions;</HI> and he was directed to let no day pass without bearing to the ven∣erable man a portion of the choicest viands which his table afforded.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="034162_0926_0FFC5BB8A192CD88"/>
Our philanthropic invalid seemed now in possession of felicity, similar to that which had become stationary in the bosom of the old gentleman; and I said, softly, surely tranquillity is only to be found with <HI>virtuous and proper actions.</HI> I feel complete satisfaction in thus penning my renunciation of error; and I have, dear Sir, the honour to be your most obedient, very humble servant,</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HARDLY a day passes that does not furnish some new instance of the paucity of national attach∣ment in our country. We regret much the frequent occasions which impel us to reiterate expressions of concern, on account of an evil so truly alarming. The real patriot must necessarily lament the present aspect of affairs. French men and measures—English men and measures. These do in fact divide the majority of the people; while those who rally round the standard of America are reduced to a very inconsiderable party.</P>
<P>We are far removed from the elder world; the wide Atlantic is our barrier. Persons of information affirm, that we possess within ourselves the sources of independ∣ence; and it is certainly true, that the interior of our country, reduced to a state of cultivation, would become amply productive, largely supplying every <HI>essential ar∣ticle of life.</HI> Necessity is pronounced the mother of in∣vention—Improvement follows; and those elegancies, or superfluities, to which we are attached, would, by a natural process, become the growth of America. Why then do we not <HI>radically throw off every foreign yoke</HI>—as∣sert
<PB N="261" REF="034162_0927_0FFC5BB22ABAF318"/>
ourselves, and no longer delay to fill our rank as free, sovereign, and independent States?</P>
<P>While I am writing, a circle of ladies in the next room are discussing this very subject, and a respectable female, in an elevated tone of voice, declares, she had rather take the fashion of her garments from an American presidentress, than from any princess in Eu∣rope. We wish this idea was adopted, from the State of New-Hampshire, to those far distant and extensive banks, whose verdant borders are washed by the waters of the Ohio; and that American habiliments, politics, and sentiments of every description, might hencefor∣ward receive an American stamp.</P>
<P>Perhaps our deficiency in national partiality is in nothing more apparent than in the little taste we dis∣cover for American literature. Indigenous produc∣tions are received with cold neglect, if not contempt, or they are condemned to an ordeal, the severity of which is sufficient to terrify the most daring adventur∣er. Mortifying indifference, or invidious criticism—these, in their respective operations, chill the opening bud, or blast its expansive leaves, and the apathy with which we regard the toils of intellect, is truly astonish∣ing. An original genius hath produced a sentiment of the following nature: <HI>If the first rate abilities, cloathed in the habiliments of mortality, were passing through the streets of our metropolis, they would be elbowed by the crowd, knocked down by a truckman, or rode over by a hackney coach.</HI> And we add—better so, than if they were con∣signed to the lingering tortures of the rack, or con∣demned to suffer death under the axe of a mangling and barbarous executioner.</P>
<P>We do not say that the office of a <HI>candid critic</HI> is not beneficial, and even <HI>essential:</HI> But when an author, or his productions, are to be dissected, in the name of every principle of humanity let a <HI>man of feeling preside</HI>—let the operation be conducted by an artist, who, possessing the abilities to discriminate, will be governed by the admo∣nitions of decency. An informed, judicious, and well disposed critic, will not wholly reject the influence of
<PB N="262" REF="034162_0928_0FFC5BAEB32790D8"/>
sympathy; and his feelings will induce him, when call∣ing into view a glaring absurdity, to produce, if possi∣ble, some pleasing selection, which may soothe the bo∣som he is thus necessitated to lacerate. When a work is to be analyzed, if the plot is deficient in conception, and in adjustment—if the ideas are extravagant, the events tragical, and the catastrophe improbable—the critic, if he is not a <HI>usurper,</HI> if he is legally invested with the robes of office, will, however, find something to ad∣mire in the style; and if it abounds with just senti∣ments, and classical allusions, he will produce them, not only with marks of decided approbation, but with triumph.</P>
<P>The stage is undoubtedly a very powerful engine in forming the opinions and manners of a people. Is it not then of importance to supply the American stage with American scenes? I am aware that very few pro∣ductions in this line have appeared, and I think the reason is obvious. Writers, especially dramatic wri∣ters, are not properly encouraged. Applause, that powerful spring of action, (if we except the ebullitions of the moment) is withheld, or sparingly administered. No incentives are furnished, and indignant genius, con∣scious of its own resources, retires to the intellectual banquet, disdaining to spread the feast for malevolence and ingratitude.</P>
<P>If productions, <HI>confessedly indifferent,</HI> were, from the ascendency of local preferences, <HI>endured in their turn, and received with manifest partiality,</HI> it would, perhaps, stimulate to more polished efforts, and the Columbian Drama might at length boast the most finished pro∣ductions. But so far are we from evincing this predi∣lection that even performances, decidedly meritorious, are almost forgotten. Tyler's plays are strangely neg∣lected; and the finished scenes of the correct and ele∣gant Mrs. Warren, have never yet passed in review be∣fore an American audience. Was the American taste decidedly in favour of native worth, the superintend∣ants of the Drama would find it for their interest to cherish indigenous abilities, and the influence of
<PB N="263" REF="034162_0929_0FFC5BAB8E754370"/>
patronage would invigorate and rear to maturity the now drooping plant.</P>
<P>To the celebrity of Mrs. Warren, it is beyond the power of the Gleaner to add: Yet, accustoming him∣self to join issue with those who yield the palm to ge∣nius, he is constrained to say, that her excellent trage∣dies abound with the pathetic, the beautiful, and the sublime, and that they apparently possess sufficient scenic merit and variety of situation to bestow those <HI>ar∣tificial advantages</HI> which are necessary to insure their <HI>stage effect.</HI> Camps, palaces, cities—a view of the orb of day, just emerging from the shades of night—as∣sembled senators—citizens passing up and down—a procession of priests, senators, and nobles, addressing, in the attitude of supplication, a Vandal tyrant—gardens, grottos—a wilderness, an alcove—shouts of victory—a prison, a battle—repeated acts of suicide. A succession of these objects, would, it is presumed, completely gratify the wishes, even of the most vision∣ary audience; and we should assuredly attend with heightened and inexpressible pleasure to that energet∣ic, beautiful, and soul affecting actress, Mrs. S. Powell, while in the characters of Edoxia, or Eudocia in the Sack of Rome, and of Donna Louisa in the Ladies of Castile, she delivered sentiments truly interesting, highly wrought, and tenderly pathetic: We have of∣ten in imagination listened to the language of Louisa, from our favourite performer, and most admirably has she pointed every sentence.</P>
<P>We conceive that Mrs. Warren, while delineating Donna Maria, traced in her own strong and lumi∣nous intellect the animated original which she present∣ed; and, making up a judgment from information, which we presume accurate, we have not hesitated to pronounce our celebrated countrywoman the <HI>Roland</HI> of America. The address of Donna Maria to Lou∣isa, in page 119, is truly beautiful. The character of Gaudentius in the Sack of Rome is finely conceived, strongly interesting, and well supported; his reflections on discovering his murdered father, are natural and
<PB N="264" REF="034162_0930_0FFC5BA68384C1C0"/>
highly finished; and it is impossible to read without a degree of pensive solemnity his soliloquy in the grot∣to. Maximus mourning his Aredelia dead, must com∣mand the sympathetic gush; and while the story of the empress is replete with instruction, her accumulat∣ed woes pierce the bosom of sensibility. Don Juan∣in the Ladies of Castile, exhibits virtues which an∣nounce him the kindred spirit of his Maria; and his native independence, his valour and his magnanimity are uniformly exemplified. The virtues of Conde Haro we spontaneously revere; and we listen, with pe∣culiar satisfaction, to sentiments resulting from benev∣olence and a just idea of the rights of man, as they are delivered by the adverse chief, while the woes of Don Francis and Donna Louisa excite our tenderest feelings.</P>
<P>Contemplating these specimens of our drama, con∣fessedly excellent, a very natural inference presents—If compositions of this description find no place on the American stage, what can the more humble ad∣venturer expect? Are not the present arrangements highly impolitic? Is it not probable that talents, now dormant, might by proper encouragement be called into action? Is it not possible that paths, yet untrod∣den in the regions of nature and of fancy, remain to be explored? and that under the fostering smiles of a liberal and enlightened public, Columbian Shake∣speares may yet elevate and adorn humanity?</P>
<P>The efforts of one of the most celebrated dramatic writers of the present century are said to have origi∣nated in accident. If our information is correct, Mrs. Cowley was both a wife and mother before she had at∣tempted even a paragraph for a magazine or newspa∣per; her pen, appropriated to the claims of kindred or friendship, had produced only private letters, and to the toils of genius she was a stranger. But being present at the theatre, during the representation of a very indifferent play, which from caprice or partiality was, however, received with uncommon marks of ap∣plause, she was forcibly struck with the insignificancy
<PB N="265" REF="034162_0931_0FFC5BA4FA6186B0"/>
of many of the dialogues; and, conceiving that a me∣diocrity of talents, with the requisite application, would be fully adequate to similar productions, she re∣tired from the play-house with an irresistible desire to enter a career, at once lucrative and honorary.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cowley was an early riser; and she passed the hours redeemed from the pillow, in the nursery with her children, who were under such regulations, as to admit of her pursuing, with pleasure and advantage, her needle, her book, or her pen. It was on the morn∣ing immediately succeeding the evening she passed at the play-house, that, quitting the nursery for the break∣fasting parlour, she presented her husband with the two first scenes in the first act of her comedy, called The Runaway. Mr. Cowley was most agreeably sur∣prised, and not only gave his sanction to her enterprise, but warmly urged the prosecution of her plan. The play was accordingly finished, and entrusted to a friend who was commissioned to enclose it to Mr. Garrick, then manager of Drury Lane Theatre, as the production of a lady. A period was fixed for Mr. Garrick's de∣cision on the merit of the piece, and its eligibility for the stage; at the expiration of which period, the friend of Mrs. Cowley waited on the manager, requesting his candid opinion. The sentiments of Mr. Garrick were instantly most flatteringly developed, not by an answer in form, but by a number of interrogations, worded in his accustomed energetic manner.</P>
<P>"For God's sake, where has that lady lived? where is she now? who is she? cannot I see her?" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Mrs. Cowley was soon introduced to Mr. Garrick—their first meeting was in a beautifully romantic tem∣ple, which he had reared to the honour of Shakespear; and they exchanged some brilliant compliments, which received point from their allusion to the <HI>bard of Avon.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Cowley's play was brought forward with eve∣ry possible advantage—the road to wealth and fame was thrown open to its fair Authoress; and we are told that no year has since revolved on which she has
<PB N="266" REF="034162_0932_0FFC5BA3733ABF00"/>
not produced one, or more, highly finished drama. Such are the fruits of judicious applause.</P>
<P>The Comedy of the Runaway was the last play that Mr. Garrick ushered to public notice.</P>
<P>A letter, received last evening, presents a pertinent close to our subject.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE present prevalent rage for every thing theatri∣cal, may render the substance of the following little an∣ecdote, relative to a celebrated performer, acceptable to your readers; and if your sentiments correspond with this idea, you will give it a page in your miscellany.</P>
<P>Certain assemblies, <HI>y'clepped spouting clubs,</HI> in the city of London, have frequently been sanctioned by the presence of many of the nobility, among whom the Dutchess of—was in the habit of amusing herself, by observing, in those nurseries of the drama, the va∣rious abilities of young persons, who, animated by a patronage so respectable, exhibited with every possible advantage. It happened on one of those occasions, that the Dutchess saw and distinguished Mr. Holland; and she immediately marked him down as a future or∣nament of the British stage. Holland was a young man, well connected, and of decent life and manners; nature had been liberal to him, and he was by no means destitute of the aids of education. The stage had long possessed his warmest wishes; but the great point was, to make his <HI>debut</HI> under an auspicious pat∣ronage; and the Dutchess, informed of his views, im∣mediately conceived the resolution of recommending him to Garrick; she had often conferred on this cele∣brated dramatic performer <HI>substantial</HI> marks of her ap∣probation; and it did not consist with his interest to negative a youth, for whom her Grace had avowed a predilection. But if we may credit report, Garrick <HI>did not always lend his countenance to merit;</HI> it is certain he was opposed to Holland's advancement; and, ob∣taining intelligence of an introductory letter to be de∣livered
<PB N="267" REF="034162_0933_0FFC5A81ED8876B0"/>
into his own hand, he determined never to be at home to the bearer. Holland repeatedly assailed his door, but the <HI>great man</HI> was always denied, and the youth despaired of gaining admittance in his own character.</P>
<P>He was not, however, discouraged; and his ingenu∣ity helping him to an expedient, he obtained, at the price of half a guinea, the habit, basket and tally of the lad who served the family of Garrick with hot rolls; when, presenting himself before the door of him whom he regarded as the arbiter of his future destiny, he informed the servant in waiting, that his master having taken a new apprentice, it was necessary old arrearages should be paid off; and that he had accord∣ingly given him a small bill, which he had directed him to deliver to Mr. Garrick. Garrick, ever atten∣tive to those kind of claims, admitted the baker's lad without difficulty; and, seated in his elbow chair, in a morning gown of <HI>crimson</HI> damask, he received with abundance of state the folded paper, which prov∣ing, to his great surprise, the introductory letter of the Dutchess, the redoubtable hero of the sock and buskin, caught in the toils, sternly questioned, "Pray, young man, was there no way of presenting this letter but in disguise?"</P>
<P>"None that occurred to me, Sir; I have repeated∣ly waited on you without success, and I have at length embraced the expedient of serving your Honor with bread."</P>
<P>"Well, it must be confessed you have a fruitful in∣vention, and having thus ingeniously made your <HI>entree,</HI> I presume you imagine yourself fit for any thing."</P>
<P>"At present, Sir, <HI>for nothing but serving your Honor with bread.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Upon my word, you are wonderfully ready; but we wish for a specimen of your theatrical abilities—begin if you please." Holland, throwing himself in∣to a commanding attitude, immediately with great pathos and propriety delivered a pathetic piece, appo∣site and striking; and the <HI>hauteur</HI> of Garrick was for a
<PB N="268" REF="034162_0934_0FFC5A8068C21118"/>
moment suspended; but, determined not to be pleased, he threw into his countenance a freezing quantum of frigidity, and superciliously said, "Mighty apt, and studied no doubt for the occasion; but you will please to favour us with an exhibition of your <HI>comic</HI> pow∣ers; you must be <HI>great</HI> in every way."</P>
<P>"Alas! Sir, I have at this moment no <HI>comic</HI> ideas!"</P>
<P>"But you must learn to assume; <HI>you are to com∣mence actor, you know.</HI>" The youth, flinging from his hand the tally, which he had held until that instant, tripped lightly over the floor, and, selecting from one of Mr. Garrick's best parts a favourite passage, he sud∣denly became prime minister of frolick; his attitude was that of humour—mirth revell'd on his cheek—Tha∣lia moulded every feature, laughed in his eye, and play∣ed on his tongue; and even the risibles of Garrick con∣fessed his astonishing powers; but recollecting himself, and assuming great solemnity, he gravely observed: "Let me tell you, young man, there is a wide differ∣ence between reciting here, in a private apartment, and in appearing on a British stage, before the most august audience in the world."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Sir, I conceive that I am now before the <HI>most august audience in the world.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, young gentleman, this compliment may be well turned; but permit me to remind you, the British audience is made up of the most respectable characters, of persons possessed of power and ability to decide irrevocably your fate; and on the drawing up of the curtain, you are immediately in the presence of thousands, who will conceive themselves vested with full authority to pronounce your immediate annihila∣tion! What think you will be your feelings at such a moment! Can you stand an ordeal so severe?"</P>
<P>"Excuse me, Sir, I humbly conceive I have as de∣cent a stock of <HI>assurance</HI> as your Honor, or any other man in existence." "By Jove," returned Garrick, "<HI>I believe it.</HI>" And, strange as it may seem, this last stroke captivating the manager, Holland was im∣mediately

engaged, who soon becoming the favourite of the public, always commanded full houses, and before the completion of a single year, his stated sala∣ry was one thousand pounds per annum; he contrib∣uted greatly to the emolument of the Drury Lane theatre, and the penetration of her Grace was held in high veneration.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>JUST returned from visiting my friend Leonora, I sit myself down to sketch for your Miscellany, an account of this my second excursion; and I do assure you, I feel, while thus employed, that sort of satisfac∣tion, which a well-disposed woman will always experi∣ence, when she can, without doing violence to her ve∣racity, expatiate upon the social pleasures of existence.</P>
<P>But, first, it may be proper that I attempt giving you an idea of the character of my friend. Although she was some years my elder, she continued at the boarding-school at which I was placed, during the whole term appropriated to my instruction; and, next to the dear woman to whom I am indebted for the vital glow of animation, she contributed most to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh∣ion and to inform my opening mind; she cultivated my taste; and, originating in my bosom sentiments of
<PB N="270" REF="034162_0936_0FFC5A7269D9DE00"/>
propriety, she taught me to esteem only those enjoy∣ments which were sanctioned by reason. Nature had thrown into my composition a vein of satire, which I often reprehensibly indulged; but Leonora bestowed upon my manners the prepossessing polish of benignity.</P>
<P>She is a model of true politeness; and, understand∣ing <HI>the precise point of good-breeding,</HI> while she is solicit∣ous to accommodate herself to all those circles which she graces by her presence, she is careful not to <HI>oppress by her civilities.</HI> Her deportment is uniformly a strik∣ing exemplification of <HI>lady-like dignity;</HI> and I have a thousand times witnessed the ineffable sweetness of her temper. She has been at once the guide and compan∣ion of some of the happiest moments of my life; and the tears which I shed at her departure from A—, as they were impelled by selfish considerations, so they will be reiterated as often as the importance of unfold∣ing events, enforce the necessity of the presence of my sweet and amiable monitress.</P>
<P>The striking exterior and rare accomplishments of Leonora, produced corresponding effects; and, after that mature deliberation which the magnitude of her subject required, she elected from her train of ad∣mirers, as the companion of her future life, a young gentleman, who, born and educated in Philadelphia, possesses a handsome property in that city. His patri∣monial inheritance was considerable; and his industry and frugality have made large additions thereto. The marriage of Leonora has been most happy; it has connected the highest felicity of which wedlock is sus∣ceptible, while every pleasure has been enhanced by a lovely train of sons and daughters, who, the probabil∣ity is, will one day constitute the fairest ornaments of society.</P>
<P>Neither Leonora, nor her Evander, have any predi∣lection for the dissipation, in which a city life almost necessarily engages persons of fortune; and Evander, cheerfully quitting a metropolis, where his ancestors had figured with much respectability, and where he him∣self had snatched a thousand juvenile pleasures, has
<PB N="271" REF="034162_0937_0FFC5A6C8275D260"/>
retired with his little family to an elegant recess, upon the skirts of a broad and extensive river. Here, surren∣dering himself to those enjoyments, to which his am∣ple income entitles him, his hours revolve, marked by r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tional and refined tranquillity. Having never seen Leonora from the time of her departure from A—, I was repeatedly summoned to her abode; and her retreat from the garish and tumultuous scenes of the busy town, added new ardour to my wishes once more to embrace her.</P>
<P>But a journey of some hundreds of miles was to be taken; and having no other means of making my ex∣cursion, than in the several stage-coaches, where I had recently endured much vexation, places for my brother and myself were again secured; and, departing from the capital at peep of day, business still reposing on the lap of silence, as we rattled through the streets, we encountered not a single human being; the shops were as fast closed as in the dead of night; and the appear∣ance of the buildings, on either hand, seemed descriptive of the continued slumbers which the inhabitants still in∣dulged. Thus passing on, we were at full liberty to ob∣serve, without interruption, that magnificent scene, with which nature, with every returning morn, presents the amateurs of her arrangements. I have very seldom beheld the august luminary of day so resplendent; an uncommon degree of tranquillity pervaded my bosom; my health was perfect; and the tone of my mind such as rendered it highly susceptible of all those pleasures, deducible from a view of the sublime and beautiful.</P>
<P>For the information of those persons who have not witnessed the progress of the morning, from the first appearance of the dawn, to the moment when the plastic parent of day, <HI>apparently</HI> emerging from the skirts of the horizon, bursts in all its splendors upon the dazzled eye, I assay to sketch the gradual devel∣opment, which forcibly arrested our attention.</P>
<P>The death-like stillness, immediately preceding the opening dawn, strikingly contrasts the animated pic∣ture, then pressing upon the threshold of observation;
<PB N="272" REF="034162_0938_0FFC5A69BB0B2878"/>
and we began our journey at that precise instant, when the intense darkness which enrobes the dreary night, drawing aside its intercepting veil, gave place to the mild light of the crepuscle, which, progressing from the horizon, whitened the whole face of that lucid curtain, that so beneficially shades the surrounding heavens. Every succeeding moment seemed to change the aspect of things; for the cheering influence of that circle, which had bestowed upon the azure firmament its silver hue, advancing from the east, and embracing the wide-extended concave of the skies, all those nu∣merous objects that we had scarcely perceived, throng∣ed rapidly upon the eye—the new-born day commenced its progress, and the Aurora succeeded the crepuscle—the gentle zephyrs were abroad—they seemed to disperse the gloomy vapours of the night—the con∣densed atmosphere became more pure—the verdant earth assumed its most beautiful tints—and the breath of morn was perfumed by a variety of sweets. We ascended a rural eminence, which commanded a pleas∣ing view of the thrifty hamlet, and the air resounded with the matin calls of the village chanticleer, while birds, of various notes and plumage, warbled upon the neighbouring branches.</P>
<P>Business resumed its industrious career—the hus∣bandman, attended by the invigorated steed, harnessed for use, appeared upon the plain—travellers thronged the road—and workmen, accoutred for the day, hast∣ened to their respective occupations.</P>
<P>Mean time, the broad horizon assumed celestial dies—the brightening crimson streaked the blue vault of heaven—passing clouds were tinged with the most vivid hues—the Aurora momently increased; and, advertised by this beautiful harbinger, we eagerly ex∣pected the ascension to which it pointed, and nature at length presented us with the most transcendent of her works. The orb of day magnificently uprose; it burst upon us in all its radiance; and, as we eyed its majestic progress, we fully acquitted those sages, who, unimpressed by the truths of revelation, prostrat∣ed
<PB N="273" REF="034162_0939_0FFC5A66B8A67100"/>
at the approach of this august "<HI>parent of seasons</HI>" and "<HI>king of day.</HI>" The splendors of a <HI>rising</HI> sun as∣sume the most benign aspect—we blest the genial orb, and marked with gratitude its progress.</P>
<P>It happened that a beautiful little girl, on her way to a rural academy, who had never before beheld the morning footsteps of the orb of day, was seated in our vehicle. Her extacies and her astonishment were in∣effable. Never shall I forget her ingenious attempts to give language to her sensations—Perhaps it was the first moment she had ever discovered a want of words. With the endearing ardour of youth, she assured her papa, who accompanied her, that she would never again forego an opportunity of beholding a scene, which surpassed every thing that had before en∣gaged her attention; and if her resolution and perse∣verance are equal to her sweet enthusiasm, and amia∣ble susceptibility, I predict that, pursuing her studies with uncommon avidity, she will become a highly ac∣complished woman. Her enchanting expressions and youthful wonder, I am free to own, augmented to me the felicity of the morning; and I embrace this op∣portunity of reiterating my acknowledgments of grat∣itude, to this lovely candidate for future excellence.</P>
<P>Fortunately for me, (that this jaunt might in every thing exhibit a perfect contrast to my journey of vex∣atious memory) our party consisted only of this charm∣ing child, her father, my brother, and myself; so that I had an absolute command of the spacious vehicle, in which we were thus adventitiously and pleasingly dis∣posed: Of the front and back seats I was alternately an occupant; for both Miss and her papa, while they too well <HI>practised the art of pleasing,</HI> to overpower me by the dictatorial and oppressive repetition of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> would, nevertheless, upon the slightest indication of my wishes, have placed them∣selves in any corner of the vehicle which might have suited my convenience. Thus charmingly we came on, enjoying delightfully the picturesque views, which luxuriant nature, in our progress over a prodigious
<PB N="274" REF="034162_0940_0FFC5A65299E53D0"/>
fine extent of country, every where displayed before us. We breakfasted in a little tenement, that seemed fitted up by the hand of neatness; and, bringing with us the sauce of appetite, the healthful viands which were prepared for our refreshment, seemed to possess a new and uncommon flavour.</P>
<P>So passed the first day of our journey—and the sep∣arating from our associates in the evening, who then reached the seminary, occasioned our first regret. The second day, however, proved equally propitious; the stage was not crowded; nor were we overburdened by <HI>ill-judged civilities.</HI> One old gentleman, led by an observation of a fellow-traveller, made many philo∣sophical remarks upon the journey of life. He ration∣ally said, that mankind, considered as the work of an all-wise Architect, must have been created with an <HI>ul∣timate view;</HI> and that, as the august Creator was gen∣erally acknowledged to unite wisdom and power, and to be omnipotently and benignly good, the purpose of creation must primarily <HI>have been, the final felicity of the creature, who was formed precisely according to the plan of a sovereign, self-existent, and independent Being:</HI> Nor (he added) did it appear, that the children of men were <HI>endowed with any faculty, which conferred a capa∣bility of counteracting the original designs of Infinite Wis∣dom.</HI> "I say, then," continued our christianized reasoner, "<HI>that our being's end and aim is happiness:</HI>" We are, in the present scene, struggling for a better state of existence. Had we not tasted what we reckon evil, we should not have known how, properly, to ap∣preciate the good; and the hour cannot be far distant, when, being "<HI>born again, we shall see the kingdom of heaven,</HI>" and become the subjects of that happy ar∣rangement, <HI>which leaves no "pause of bliss.</HI>" For the departure of my friends, therefore, I shed no tears—when they enter this life, it is then they are but em∣bryoes—they pass through the dark valley—and <HI>the moment of their exit from this, is their birth into the celes∣tial world.</HI> Hence, upon every such event, which comes under my knowledge, I forget not to shall, by
<PB N="275" REF="034162_0941_0FFC5A5D448EFA18"/>
a song of triumph, the liberated spirit; <HI>and I am confident, that my gratulations contribute to enhance the felicity of the new-born celestial.</HI>" Yes, the old gentle∣man was perhaps whimsical; but we were amused, and passed the day in his society very pleasingly: In∣deed, we continued remarkably happy in our asso∣ciates, until the evening of the sixth day, when, with the setting sun, we reached the Recess of Amity.</P>
<P>To do justice to the manner of my reception at the paradisaical villa of Evander, is beyond the power of language. Leonora, whom I so immeasurably love and honour, attended by Evander, and accompanied by her sons and daughters, (a beautifully interesting group) met me at the outermost gate of the <HI>recess;</HI> and I saw, at one glance, that her native elegance and urbanity had become the inheritance of her children. As they conducted me to their mansion, the most af∣fectionate expressions spontaneously burst from their lips, and I was welcomed with those demonstrations of joy, which were highly worthy our long continued amity. Evander is informed, sentimental, and man∣ly; he is rich in mental resources; he is well calcu∣lated for the pleasures of a sequestered life; and the serenity of his soul impresses upon his fine countenance strong indications of that "<HI>peace of mind, which good∣ness bosoms over.</HI>"</P>
<P>The mansion of Evander is embosomed by tall trees, which throw around its avenues a venerable shade, and, penetrating the time-formed enclosure, up∣on a gentle acclivity the well-built tenement presents its snow-white front. It is entered by a gravel-walk, inclosed on either side by a neat railing, and bordered by a rich growth of various and beautiful flowers. The verdant plats, too, on the right and left, are charming additions: Indeed, every thing is highly rural; and the most pleasing expectation takes posses∣sion of the mind. The house is spacious, and seems to unite the ideas of simplicity and opulence: The out-houses are judiciously disposed, and admirably com∣modious. I have said, that the estate of Evander, is
<PB N="276" REF="034162_0942_0FFC5A5BBAA7D6B0"/>
washed by a copious and fertilizing river, and its wind∣ing course, forming a number of indented points, most pleasingly diversifies the view, and produces a truly enchanting effect.</P>
<P>The tract of land in the possession of Evander, is a location, comprising many hundred acres; it is a patrimonial inheritance, and in a high state of cultiva∣tion; it possesses great fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate. Many weeks passed before I had measured it with the steps of an investigator; for I was not <HI>pre∣cipitated</HI> over the grounds, at the <HI>pleasure of the propri∣etor, but cheerfully attended when I proposed a walk.</HI> The lands, as I said, are rich, and abundantly productive; and the air, highly impregnated with sweet fern, and other fragrant odours, breathes an aromatic gale, while we gratefully quaff its salutary properties. Woods and lawns, hills and dales, meandering streams, and trees, of various growth and fruit, alternately arrest the eye. The maple tree, among the rest, (the saccha∣rine quality of which promises to become a new source of independence to this continent) yields to the inhab∣itants of the recess, its richest sweets. Nothing can be imagined more highly picturesque, than many of the views upon this fine and well improved estate. The uniformity of the verdant plains is not sufficiently extensive to offend; gentle ascents are thrown over the grounds; these are adorned by the richest ver∣dure, and variegated by tall trees, which, spreading their ample foliage, lift their green heads, delightfully finishing the scene. The groves and vistas upon the estate of Evander, may be considered as ample and commodious aviaries, where the birds melodiously war∣ble; and no luckless hand, armed for their destruction, dares to molest their operations.</P>
<P>There is, in agricultural life, a degree of independ∣ence, that at once ennobles and tranquillizes the spir∣it; it bestows that security, which is very conge∣nial with the feelings of humanity. Thomson ele∣gantly describes the felicities of rural retirement; and Evander is, in fact, the sentimental recluse delin∣eated
<PB N="277" REF="034162_0943_0FFC5A5A35D94F10"/>
by the poet. Order and propriety preside in his family; his Leonora is ever rationally indulgent; and her abode is the residence of harmony.</P>
<P>A retired apartment in the recess is consecrated to devotional exercises; it is their little chapel; and thither, with each returning morning, and succeeding evening, the individuals of this happy family collect, to do homage to that Supreme Being, whom they con∣sider as their Creator, Redeemer, and Preserver, whom they are taught to regard as a Universal Father, and from whose benevolent arrangements they confidently look for a state of the highest ultimate felicity. To their morning orisons succeed the employments of the day, and they occupy their appropriated hours.</P>
<P>It is the great business of Evander and Leonora, to render their children good and happy: They are themselves their preceptors; and their abilities are fully adequate to this important avocation. The in∣dividuals of the interesting little group, without an exception, evince an insatiable thirst for knowledge; and, as each valuable propensity is excited and drawn forth by their admirable parents, it will readily be conceived, that their education advances with propor∣tionable celerity. They are already entered students of nature; and, anticipating a few years, by the help of imagination, I listen to their investigations, deriv∣ing both information and pleasure, while they trace the flowers which they collect in their woodland walks, to their respective classes, orders, and species. Their proficiency in music and drawing, their time of life considered, is prodigious. They can already sketch a resemblance of the landscape which pleases them; and never shall I forget the sweet magic of their voic∣es, whether they perform a <HI>solo,</HI> or join in full con∣cert: Yet, although their abilities in this way are un∣questionable, they are <HI>not solicitous</HI> to charm you, whether you will or not; and a degree of retiring re∣luctance is sufficiently manifest.</P>
<P>The bustle of parade, and all those ceremonies con∣sequent on an ostentatious display of opulence, are al∣together
<PB N="278" REF="034162_0944_0FFC5A58B0AEA968"/>
unknown at the Recess. Genuine hospitality assumes its most captivating garb, and <HI>real enjoyments</HI> are obtained. Unembarrassed by ill-judged importu∣nities, guests are permitted to make their own elec∣tions, while, with flattering alacrity, every individual is on the wing to gratify their wishes; and justice im∣pels the acknowledgment, that I have never passed days more rationally serene than at this sentimental retreat. Tumult and disorder, of every description, are banished thence—business and pleasure are alike regularly arranged—the bill of fare for every day is stated—the several divisions of the week present their appropriate covers—and if the unexpected arrival of company (which, in this family, is always a pleasing, circumstance) necessitates an augmentation of their number, the requisite steps are taken without confu∣sion, or the observation of the traveller.</P>
<P>Evander and Leonora are the common benefactors of their necessitous neighbours. The answer of a peas∣ant to a stranger, inquiring who inhabited the elegant mansion of Evander, will give an idea of the senti∣ments entertained of them by the humble tenants of the soil.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Why, Sir, we does not know how it is; but if it be no offence, and if one may speak as one thinks—why, then, Sir, we thinks as how that a family of angels dwells there.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Such, Mr. Gleaner, are my friends, Evander and Leonora; and I confidently pronounce, that if happi∣ness dwells upon this globe, she has taken up her resi∣dence in their charming Recess.</P>

<P>I DO not know when I have seen a more charming evening than the last—the stars shone with unusual brilliancy; and the moon, in full orbed majesty, be∣stowed on the scene her highest finishing. Standing in my door, I was induced, by the delightfully im∣pressive serenity that every where prevailed, to indulge in a contemplative ramble, which I closed by a peep upon Margaretta, shortening the distance, by turning my steps to a winding path-way across the meadows, that we have fashioned for the convenience of seeing each other, with that facility which our unalterable at∣tachment demands. I found that lovely woman oc∣cupied in a manner truly congenial with her feelings, and completely worthy her character. She had em∣ployed her afternoon in preparing letters, which she proposes to dispatch to the several emporiums in the Union, that they may be on their way to Europe and the West-Indies, for the purpose of relieving a deso∣late female, whom Providence has thrown under her protection.</P>
<P>On entering the parlour of my daughter, I beheld her seated on a sofa with an interesting stranger, who was clad in deep mourning. Margaretta was endeav∣ouring, in strains of soft commiseration, to soothe and tranquillize the perturbed spirits of the fair afflicted, while the mingling sensations of grief, joy, gratitude, and admiration, apparently struggling in the bosom of the stranger, proving too powerful for a frame that had encountered severe and repeated shocks of adver∣sity, she was on the point of fainting, when Mrs. Ham∣ilton, ringing for her woman, assisted in conducting her to an apartment, previously appropriated, to her

accommodation. Wrapping my arms about me, I waited in silent astonishment for an eclaircissement, which I doubted not would confer additional splendor on the character of my daughter. She soon returned, with the desired explanation on her lips; and while she recounted the substance of the following sorrow-marked narrative, her fine eyes were lighted up with an expression, which even surpassed their native lustre—the fervour of benevolence communicated to her en∣chanting countenance a dazzling radiance—she seemed all soul—and the most systematic stoic must have pro∣nounced her irresistibly lovely.</P>
<P>Mr. Hamilton has thrown across an extensive piece of ground, a gravel-walk, which he has taken much pains to level and beautify: Every day the gardener is employed in cleaning, smoothing and polishing its surface; and, in point of order, it is not inferior to any of our public walks. It is contrasted, on either hand, by enamelled lawns, cloathed with delightful verdure; and it is bordered by tall trees, whose en∣twining branches form a gratefully capacious shade. At the bottom of this charming vista, a glassy stream winds its meandering course; and its pleasing mur∣murs produce a romantic effect. It is separated from the grounds by a white Chinese railing, and terminat∣ed by a gentle acclivity, the summit of which is crown∣ed with trees of various growth. This walk, which is properly the Village Mall, is entered by arched gates, and it is furnished with convenient seats. Free egress and regress is allowed to the decent villager; and, as the curiosity of the travelling stranger fre∣quently draws him thither, during the spring, summer, and autumn months, a servant is stationed in the Mall, who tenders cool lemonade, wine, milk, and a variety of fruits, and other light refreshments, which are easi∣ly prepared, and which, to the way-worn passenger, are often highly acceptable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hamilton appropriates a stated period in ev∣ery fine day to this enchanting walk; she is generally accompanied by her children; and those among her
<PB N="281" REF="034162_0947_0FFC5A4A9AC8BC38"/>
humble or necessitous friends, who have any petition to prefer, frequently meet her there. The morning of yesterday, being remarkably mild, she entered the promenade at an earlier hour than usual. William, who is a sentimentalist from the cradle, tripped by her side. She led the little Margaretta by the hand. Mary-Augusta was borne in the arms of a rosy cheeked Hebe, who particularly superintends the gambols of the children; and the tenderly interested parent, thus presiding the guardian of innocence, seemed to move a being of a superior order, while that complacency, which is the offspring of uniform goodness, manifestly irradiated every feature. She had not advanced many paces, when her attention was arrested by a female, clad in the habiliments of sorrow, who, kneeling before one of the seats, was apparently offering up her suppli∣cations to the common Parent of the universe. Her gestures were descriptive of extreme anguish of spirit; and they were sufficiently expressive to interest the ten∣derest commiseration.</P>
<P>Margaretta, directing the children to pass on, ap∣proached the suffering stranger with that kind of cau∣tious deference, and respectful veneration, with which those, who enjoy the sunny beams of prosperity, should uniformly regard the sons and daughters of misfortune. Far from interrupting the rites of devotion, she spon∣taneously raised her hands and eyes to heaven, by a silent ejaculation calling down from thence, that ben∣ediction which might invest the prostrate mourner with returning peace. It was in this moment of affecting sympathy, that the truly interesting supplicant, quit∣ting, with heart piercing sighs, her kneeling posture, turned suddenly round, and beholding Margaretta in the pious attitude of petitioning the Omnipotent Cre∣ator, a crimson hue suffused her grief-worn counte∣nance, which was immediately succeeded by a death∣like paleness.</P>
<P>Margaretta respectfully seated the trembling un∣known, and placing herself beside her, addressed her in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> language of consolation. The stran∣ger,
<PB N="282" REF="034162_0948_0FFC5A47A0F47E30"/>
after gazing with fixed astonishment, at length in∣terrupted—"Ah! Madam, I cannot be mistaken—your figure, your features, and, above all, your peace-speaking and highly soothing accents, all combine to announce you: The world cannot have produced such another. You are, you must be, Mrs. Hamilton! Two miles from B—, I was told, the angel resided; and, impelled by necessity, I have measured my weary steps to this abode. Speak, dear lady—Are you not, indeed, that Margaretta Hamilton, who is so well known to the family of the unfortunate?" "My name is Margaretta Hamilton, Madam," replied my daughter, "but I cannot but wonder, by what chance it is rendered familiar to you!" "Excellent lady!" rejoined the stranger, "the trump of fame is listed on high; and it faileth not to proclaim those meritorious votaries of virtue, whose deeds of worth, registered in immortal annals, confer an elevation, <HI>which will en∣dure, when every earth-born pleasure may be engulphed in oblivion!</HI>"</P>
<P>Margaretta, bowing, observed that, to whatever ac∣cident she might owe the present address, she should certainly feel it incumbent upon her, to call into action every effort, which might contribute to the relief of a person, apparently so deep a sufferer, and that she only waited to learn her wishes, in order to engage in the most prompt execution thereof. The stranger, now clasping her hands, with a wild air exclaimed: "Ge∣nius of benevolence! my spirit prostrates before thee!—Yes, Madam, my name is Wretchedness! Fortune, family, husband, children—these are all buried beneath the waves of calamity! That little parcel," pointing to an enfolded handkerchief she had thrown on an ad∣joining seat, "contains my whole of worldly prop∣erty! I slept last night in an apartment, which is no longer mine; and I have not, now, where to lay my head!"</P>
<P>Previous to this exclamation, the children had join∣ed their mother; and little William, in the true spirit of infantile philanthropy, catching the falling hand
<PB N="283" REF="034162_0949_0FFC5A44879D8A08"/>
of the pity-moving stranger, sobbed out: "You shall go home with mamma, Madam—papa will love you, too—and you shall sit in my chair—and when night comes again, and you are tired, you shall lay down on little William's bed, and we will sleep to∣gether—Shall we not, mamma?"</P>
<P>The children of Margaretta, accustomed to a con∣stant succession of strangers, never shrink from a new face; and the charming sensibility, which the little fellow so properly evinced, communicated to the bo∣som of his mother, those rapt sensations that disdain the garb of language. The fair unfortunate dropt upon his lovely face the tear of silent admiration; and Margaretta, after clasping him to her heart, and enriching him with her maternal benediction, dismissed him and his sisters, bidding them expect a continuation of their walk at the close of day—when, turning to the weeping mourner, she thus addressed her: "And now, Madam, you may, without interruption, pour into my ear the tale of woe, which my foreboding heart assures me, the catalogue of your sufferings will unfold."</P>
<Q><P>"Uniform benignity," replied the fair unknown, will never consider the child of sorrow as an intrud∣er; and, to the patient hearing of benevolence, the pressure of calamity is a sufficient passport. I have sought you, Madam, on purpose to lay before you my situation, to supplicate your advice and assistance; and, the better to entitle myself thereto, I will briefly narrate the most essential circumstances of my life. I have, I bless God, no scenes of guilt to unfold, although I have sometimes thought that, too much elated by prosperity, the arrogance of my elevation may have placed in my hands the chalice of affliction.</P>
<P>I was born in Belfast, in Ireland. My father is, or <HI>was,</HI> a distiller of some eminence; and his industry and frugality placed his family in a situation, which, without doing any great violence to language, may be termed affluent. I had the misfortune to lose my mother while young; and the indulgence to which she had accustomed me, rendered that cold reserve, and
<PB N="284" REF="034162_0950_0FFC5A4305CAF0D0"/>
those restraints that were perhaps necessary, and to which I was almost immediately subjected, painfully irksome. Girls naturally shrink from the control of a step-mother; and, although I have known many wor∣thy women, who have meritoriously discharged the ar∣duous duties of that department, yet the odium, too generally affixed to the character, is not essentially di∣minished. For me, I gladly availed myself of the goodness of my father, who placed a boarding-school education in my option; and I was entrusted to the care of two respectable maiden ladies, who had long been in the habit of instructing young girls.</P>
<P>In this seminary, while no genteel accomplishment was neglected, the pupils were required to prepare for themselves every article of their apparel: Our judi∣cious preceptresses observing that, if the contingencies of life reduced us to the necessity of calling into ac∣tion any extraordinary exertions, resources would thus be multiplied, and that, even on the supposition, we were adopted into the family of prosperity, useful knowledge would never impede our advancement. Often have I blessed the provident care of these ven∣erable women: The habits of economy and industry, to which they accustomed me, at all times beneficial, have lately proved my only support.</P>
<P>At fourteen, I returned to the abode of my father, where I continued until I had completed my seven∣teenth year; at which period my sister wedded Mr. James L—r, a portrait painter, of considerable abili∣ties, who possessed a plantation in St. Christopher's, to which island she agreed to accompany him. My two brothers, and two of my maternal uncles, having long meditated a settlement in America, embraced this op∣portunity of putting their plan in execution; and I could not resist the inducement which so fair an occa∣sion furnished, of reputably freeing myself from the jurisdiction of an assuming and petulant woman. I petitioned my beloved father, for leave to accompany the individuals of our family, who were about to de∣part; and such was the mildness of his disposition,
<PB N="285" REF="034162_0951_0FFC5A3BF06CD1F0"/>
that it was with difficulty he ever put a negative on the wishes of his children: Yet he affectionately re∣monstrated, until, on my assuring him, that after visit∣ing the new world I would again return to his em∣braces, he condescended to withdraw his objections, and bestowed upon me a benediction, which was as the richest treasure to my soul.</P>
<P>We left Ireland immediately on the close of that war, which emancipated the United States from the domination of Great-Britain, and after a propitious passage, we landed in Maryland. Here our family separated. My sister accompanied her husband to St. Christopher's. One of my uncles, attended by my youngest brother, accepted an advantageous offer of visiting Portugal, where, it is probable, they are now doing business; and my other uncle, dissatisfied with his situation, departed from us with an avowed inten∣tion of purchasing an inheritance in the Northern States. My eldest brother took a house in Maryland, the superintendence of which he committed to me; and our days passed on in tolerable tranquillity. My brother contracted an acquaintance with several gen∣tlemen in Pennsylvania; and, visiting Philadelphia, we passed some happy days in that metropolis.</P>
<P>It was on our return to Maryland, that I first saw Doctor M—, a young man, who appeared to me possessed of every virtue. His extraction was French; but he spoke English with facility. He had studied physic with Doctor—of Philadelphia; and he was then commencing the career of life, under the auspices of a good understanding, much information, some property, and great benevolence of heart. His atten∣tions to me were marked by the tenderest assiduities, and my prepossession in his favour augmented with every pasting moment. Dear object of my soul's best affection! how is it that I endure a world, from which, alas! thou art forever flown?—But peace, my burn∣ing heart—yet a little while, and I shall forget to weep—I shall rejoin, in regions of blessedness, him, to whom my early vows were so rapturously devoted!</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="034162_0952_0FFC5A3A3B859068"/>
Doctor M—, Madam, solicited my hand in marriage; and my brother, availing himself of the authority delegated to him by my father, conferred upon our mutual attachment the fullest sanction. My lover possessed grounds in Cape Francois. It was his determination to enter into business at the Cape; and my brother had long contemplated a removal thither. We were soon established at Cape Francois; and our nuptials were not long delayed; after which, my brother, urged by motives of interest, once more changed his residence for a situation in St. Vincent's.</P>
<P>Yet, although our family party was thus strangely dispersed, my husband continued the assiduities of the lover. My father had written to us; and, bestowing upon our union the most unequivocal approbation, he enriched us with his paternal blessing, and I esteemed myself the happiest of women. Doctor M—, emi∣nent in his profession, was successful beyond our most sanguine hopes: The birth of children crowned our wishes; and three promising girls seemed to complete, for me, my sum of joy. My sister L—r was not so happy as to become a mother; and with much reluc∣tance I yielded, to her frequent importunities, my first pledge of love. I parted with my dear Amelia with floods of tears; and she accompanied her uncle L—r to the Island of St. Christopher's. Alas! these eyes have never since beheld her; and I am ignorant if either she or my sister are yet in existence! Imme∣diately on her departure, the troubles in the West-India islands commenced. A friend, driven from her hab∣itation, sought and obtained shelter with us. She had not been many days our inmate, when she was seized with the small-pox. Neither myself, nor my children, had ever passed through that fatal disorder—she con∣tagion was communicated—I was brought to the verge of the grave—and my babes—my darling babes—became the victims of the despoiler! Yet, I bless thee, O my Redeemer! on their behalf; for, sheltered in the bosom of their God, they thus escaped the dis∣astrous fate, for which their hapless parents were re∣served!
<PB N="287" REF="034162_0953_0FFC5A38B9B4C420"/>
I mourned over the early graves of my in∣fants; but my dear, my affectionate husband was continued to me; and, although the small-pox had made shocking ravages in my face, his tenderness was in no sort diminished, and his delicate attentions were, if possible, more marked, more uniform than before. Generous lover! friend! husband!—But, great and good God! he is now numbered with the dead! while I, comfortless and forlorn, can only recount the story of my woes, and wish, in vain, for that parting sigh, which is to waft me from this scene of wretch∣edness!</P>
<P>Forgive me, Madam—I will resume my narra∣tion. Months rolled on; and when, ushering into being my fourth infant, I became the mother of a lovely boy, joy once more revisited my lacerated bo∣som—but transient and momentary was the gleam. Upon the very evening on which my little cherub had completed his third week, after folding him to my throbbing heart, I committed him to the care of his nurse—she conveyed him to his apartment—and I saw him no more! Doubtless, he perished in the gen∣eral wreck! It was midnight, when the blacks rush∣ed on us—every thing was rifled—My husband, my adored husband, was murdered in attempting to de∣fend me!—and the sword was pointed at my bosom also! At such a crisis, it is astonishing that I recog∣nized the very man whom I had employed as my hair-dresser, and whom I had repeatedly rescued from suffering. Coward nature, appalled at the fearful car∣nage, mechanically exclaimed—Is it possible? Am I to receive the stroke of death from him, who is in∣debted to me for unnumbered acts of kindness? The barbarian was struck with a sentiment of remorse—he manifested a desire to save me—and while he as∣sayed to lift me over the dead body of my murdered lord, I fainted in his arms.</P>
<P>Of events immediately succeeding I am ignorant. My first recollection, after this tremendous moment, places me on the wide ocean—in the cabin of a vessel
<PB N="288" REF="034162_0954_0FFC5A3025AF4338"/>
—stretched on the captain's matrass, who had hu∣manely yielded it to my necessities—and surrounded by strangers of both sexes, who, like me, had escaped the dagger of the assassin. How I came on board, I could never exactly learn. The probability is, that the black man so far interested himself for my safety, as to see me conveyed out of the island; and it is won∣derful, that although I was only arrayed in the <HI>robe de chambre</HI> in which I slept, my watch, bracelets, neck∣lace, and rings, were found upon me: But ah! Mad∣am, at that soul-torturing period, what was the an∣guish of my spirit! Stripped in one calamitous night—But why attempt to delineate?—my sorrows do indeed surpass the power of description! From the passengers and the ship's company, I am induced to believe, I received every possible attention: But my reason suspending its operations, I was landed in Alex∣andria, in Virginia, in a state of insanity!</P>
<P>For five months after my arrival in America, I continued without the smallest recollection of my former self. My alienation of mind was, as I am told, of the most heart-affecting kind; and my lamentations were only interrupted by that laugh of frenzy, which is deeply fraught with woe, and which strongly inte∣rests the feelings of humanity. No lucid interval pre∣sented; and I was pronounced a confirmed maniac. Youth, however, and a good constitution, at length surmounted my malady, and I was gradually restored to a recollection of that extremity of wretchedness which I had endured. It was at this period, that I deliberately meditated putting an end to a mode of existence, which had become truly burdensome; and it is to be imputed to the benevolent exertions of a Mrs. THOMPSON of Alexandria, that I sunk not be∣neath the weight of woes, which had so fearfully ac∣cumulated for my destruction. The extricating hand of this lady was benignly extended; she poured into my wounded mind the oil and wine of consolation; she new pointed my hopes, and taught me to observe an opening heaven, and a commiserating God; nor
<PB N="289" REF="034162_0955_0FFC5A2EA1CCD500"/>
were her well-judged efforts to soothe and tranquillize my bosom, altogether ineffectual.</P>
<P>I recollected, in the first moment of calm reflec∣tion, having heard in the West-Indies, that my uncle had purchased an estate in B—; and possessing an invincible desire to throw myself into the protection of some one of my family, (the individuals of which, must, to this hour, imagine I suffered death in Cape Francois) I formed the resolution of immediately pro∣ceeding to my uncle; and parting with those ves∣tiges of my former splendor, which had been almost miraculously saved from the wreck of my fortune, with the money arising from the sale, I equipt myself for the commencement of a journey, which my igno∣rance in the geography of the country induced me to imagine, a day or two would terminate. It proved, however, to a desolate and forlorn stranger, a tedious period, the glooms of which were only illumined by the hope of soon finding myself in the arms of an af∣fectionate relative. Detained in New-Haven by ill∣ness, I am largely indebted to a Mrs. BROWN, who lets lodgings in that city, and whose disinterested be∣nevolence is beyond all praise. What shall I say, Madam? I came on to B—. My little money (for my jewels were disposed of, much below their value) was exhausted. No tender friend remained to receive me. My uncle had never been heard of at B—. I was pennyless, and a stranger! For some fearful days my efforts became prostrate! Despair, with hasty strides, was advancing in my bosom; yet hope still struggled there; and, strange to tell, I still continued in existence!</P>
<P>The Hibernian Society interested itself in my fa∣vour; and from them, and from the Free Masons, I received small gratuities: But my mind, not sufficient∣ly accommodated to its situation, shrunk from the idea of lessening the fund reserved for distressed indigence; and, moreover, a continuance of these benefits was as little to be calculated upon, as endured. My applica∣to the French and English residents in B—was in∣effectual;
<PB N="290" REF="034162_0956_0FFC5A2D1AD24D70"/>
they declared it was beyond their power to relieve me. I had hoped, through their interposition, to return to Ireland, where I am entitled to an estate, independent of my father, devised to me by my grand∣mother; and my patrimonial inheritance I have still to receive. Could I reach Ireland, my pecuniary wants would know an end; but this I have not the means of doing. I have attempted to write; but, desolate as I am, I have no means of conveying my lamentable epistles. I have endeavoured to obtain support by my needle, and I have, in a measure, suc∣ceeded; but ill health impedes my efforts. To your character, Madam, I am no stranger. Some propi∣tious spirit seemed to whisper me, that from you I should meet commiseration and relief. From your name, from your virtues, my last hope receives its vi∣tal glow; and towards Hamilton-Place, as my only resource, my feet have involuntarily bent their way.</P></Q>
<P>Such was the <HI>purport</HI> of the distressed lady's affecting narrative. I have scrupulously preserved its leading features. Susceptible readers will find no difficulty in supplying those frequent breaks and pauses, which nat∣urally occurred during a recital, that was delivered in a manner so unaffected and artless, as to leave on the mind of Margaretta no doubt of its authenticity. They will also imagine those nameless sympathies, which oc∣casionally darted from the benign countenance of my daughter, and which, fraught with assuaging energy, expressed abundantly mere, than is in the power of words to utter.</P>
<P>With grace inimitable, and a manner all her own, she assured the sorrow-pierced stranger of her <HI>ability</HI> and her <HI>readiness</HI> to assist her: Nor will those, who have traced the liberal virtues of Mrs. Hamilton through the pages of the Gleaner, consider as prob∣lematical the generous warmth with which she will supply the present exigencies, and consult the future emolument, of this extraordinary proficient in the school of affliction; and it is indeed certain, that when, with becoming respect, and all the ardour of munifi∣cent
<PB N="291" REF="034162_0957_0FFC5A2A4F20A670"/>
hospitality, she led, to her happy mansion, the daughter of misfortune, she devoutly blessed a pater∣nal God, who had thus placed within her reach, the <HI>power</HI> of ameliorating those ills which had made such large inroads on a mind so deeply stricken: And both Edward and Margaretta are, at this moment, busily employed in concerting measures, by which they may gently slope, for the afflicted sufferer, what yet remains of life.</P>

<Q><L>Bright Hospitality, with garland crown'd,</L>

<L>Mid nature's wilds, where'er the trav'ller roams,</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE mazy dance, the festive song, the table lib∣erally spread, the well filled bowl, and sparkling glass—these are all in the gift of Hospitality: Nay, more, FRIENDSHIP resideth in her haunts, and VIRTUE loveth to dwell in her presence: The social pleasures weave a chaplet for her brow; and she may be con∣sidered as the parent of communicative urbanity. Pleasant is the feast which she spreadeth for the stran∣ger. She looketh with peculiar benignity upon him, who, wandering far distant from his native abode, hath been urged forward, either by motives of curios∣ity, amusement, or profit; and the exhausted travel∣ler, having reposed on the bed of down, ariseth from the slumbers of the night, to echo the panegyric which hath been resounded by a thousand tongues.</P>
<P>The State of Virginia, we are informed, is classed high in the records of Hospitality. Its extensive boundaries contain many towns and hamlets; and the commodious villas are scattered up and down at easy
<PB N="292" REF="034162_0958_0FFC5A23DEE77408"/>
distances. To the feet of the traveller these villas are well known—they are the mansions of Hospitality. Often have we attended, with superior pleasure, to our very amiable friend, Mrs. J—of Philadelphia, while she hath dilated on the Hospitality of the Virginians. The bosom of this lady is the seat of the virtues; and it is her's to expatiate, with enchanting energy, on the deed of worth. She is a beautiful and a lovely wo∣man; and her features, animated by sensibility, are irresistibly captivating. She is in possession of afflu∣ence; but gold, in a scattered and thinly inhabited country, will not always purchase those requisites, which are so essential to the traveller, worn down by fatigue, and exhausted in the want of refreshment.</P>
<P>Mrs J—accompanied her husband on a tour of business, through the State of Virginia; and her tongue will never be tired of eulogizing those hospita∣ble republicans. Born and educated in the regular city of Philadelphia, where previous knowledge, let∣ters of introduction, or many weeks probationary resi∣dence, must authorize the claim of attention, the frank civilities, and prompt Hospitality of the Virginians, added to their intrinsic worth the powerful charm of novelty.</P>
<P>Virginian Hospitality hath superseded the necessity of houses of public entertainment. The occupation of an inn-keeper is, in that State, very unprofitable. A public house is, therefore, rarely to be met with, and they are generally of the lowest class. Our Philadelphians do not seem to have been perfectly ap∣prized of this circumstance, or, if they were, it had not been in their power to provide against its incon∣venience. They entered the State of Virginia, unfur∣nished with letters of introduction; and their first day's progress was lengthened, tedious, and destitute of those refreshments, which their necessities urgently demanded. Night rapidly advanced—already her ebon veil obscured the light of heaven—they were ig∣norant of their route, and entire strangers in that part of the country—A foot passenger approached—
<PB N="293" REF="034162_0959_0FFC5A2259EE65B0"/>
"Friend, can you direct us to a tolerable inn, where we may pass the night?"</P>
<P>"<HI>An inn!</HI> Lord bless us! <HI>we have no good inns—not we.</HI> Some twenty miles from hence, they say there is a sign-post; but, <HI>Measter,</HI> the like of you never troubles themselves about that there; <HI>for these all goes to</HI> COLONEL CHICHISTER's, [we do not omit or transpose a single letter of his name] which is main glad to see <HI>um,</HI> and makes <HI>um</HI> right down welcome. COLONEL CHICHISTER lives in the <HI>huge</HI> house, hard by; and I <HI>thinks as how,</HI> you cannot do better, than to go right to <HI>un, Measter.</HI>"</P>
<P>"What do you say, my dear?"</P>
<P>"<HI>Say! why, it is impossible we can think of intruding ourselves upon strangers.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Nay, my dear, there is no other alternative: We must either sleep in the open air, or put the Hospitali∣ty of COLONEL CHICHISTER to the test. Coachman, drive on—Stop—this is the mansion—go in—make my compliments to COLONEL CHICHISTER—let him know I am a citizen of Philadelphia, and that, as a be∣nighted traveller, I ask an asylum for the night."</P>
<P>The Colonel was almost immediately at the coach door—blest Hospitality was seated on his brow—Mr. and Mrs. J—were ushered into his dwelling—the lady of the mansion was exactly suited to her situation—not the shadow of restraint existed—urbanity was in full exercise—affability presided—every circum∣stance evinced that the occurrence of the evening was not a <HI>novel event</HI>—and our travellers seemed as if reit∣erating those social pleasures, which they had so fre∣quently indulged in the bosom of the dearest of their friends. Plenty and elegance combined to spread the feast. Their lodging was prepared by taste and neat∣ness; and their rest was balmy and restorative. COLONEL CHICHISTER urged their abode with him, during many revolving days; and, constantly engaged in the exercise of the most liberal and extensive Hos∣pitality, he seemed unconscious of any extraordinary
<PB N="294" REF="034162_0960_0FFA661ABA43E4C0"/>
exertion. We produce COLONEL CHICHISTER as a specimen of Virginian Hospitality. Similar acts of kindness rendered the tour of the Philadelphians truly delightful; and their most grateful recollection hov∣ers round those abodes of urbanity.</P>
<P>Surely, every propensity, calculated to give energy to an attachment which ought to pervade the bosoms of individuals who date their origin from the same progenitors, should be sedulously cultivated; a mutual exchange of good offices should designate humanity, and the powerful operations of sympathy enzone the great family of man. Such an ameliorating arrange∣ment would largely contribute toward lessening the evils attendant on that depravity, which has so fatally contaminated our common nature, and we should not be reduced to the necessity of lamenting the prevalence of invidious reserve, envy and rancour.</P>
<P>The philanthropist will view, with painful regret, the disaffection which, in many parts of America, so pointedly subsists between the natives of the town and country. Habits, customs, manner of pronunciation, &amp;c. &amp;c.—these are made sufficiently consequential to erect barriers, that look with a very unfriendly aspect on the mutual good understanding we would recom∣mend; and all the malevolence of wit is too often in exercise.</P>
<P>YES—it is true, WE HAVE ENTERED A VERY COPI∣OUS FIELD; and, had our attention been turned there∣to, at an earlier period, from a soil so abundantly pro∣ductive, we should have GLEANED <HI>very largely:</HI>—But being, in imitation of our superiors, <HI>about to resign the cares of office,</HI> and take, perhaps, a long farewel of our readers, we are constrained, by that civility which we are seeking to inculcate, to give place to a number of claimants, whose names have long stood foremost in our catalogue of correspondents.</P>

<P>YES, good Master Gleaner, we are now no longer <HI>a-ground.</HI> You so well lent us a hand, <HI>d'ye see,</HI> that we soon <HI>cleared the rascally sands;</HI> and, <HI>warping</HI> off, and slowly <HI>wearing</HI> round, we were once more afloat on the stream—not but what the wind was often in <HI>our muns;</HI> and after <HI>beating in its eye</HI> ever so long, we were obliged to <HI>strike a hull,</HI> during many a tedious watch: But what of that?—it hath at length <HI>veered</HI> about to the right point of the compass; we have <HI>weathered the shoals of Disappointment;</HI> and, I assure you, Master Gleaner, on the word of a tough old seaman, that, having shipped a large cargo of your experience, to∣gether with the ballast of your remarks and advice, <HI>and all that there,</HI> we once more bear a good sail.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, we have now got the <HI>weather-gage</HI> of sor∣row; nor do we care a <HI>rope's end</HI> for what is past. Molly took on piteously over the poor <HI>disabled</HI> Lavinia; but suddenly <HI>tacking</HI> about, she wiped up her eyes, and throwing open her <HI>dead lights, clapped Pride at the helm,</HI> who, <HI>d'ye see,</HI> soon steered her wide of the harbour of Despair. It would certainly have been cowardly for to have laid up for life, because <HI>as how</HI> we had made one bad bout; and to continue in the dumps all the voyage, and all for the sake of a villainous lubber, who had given us the slip, would have been a plaguy deal worse than a dead calm: Molly thought so too; and after whimpering a long time, at length, as I was say∣ing, resolved for to steer by your compass; and taking in her <HI>drifted</HI> affections, she soon <HI>belayed</HI> them along side of discretion, and <HI>splicing</HI> them to a good jolly temper, we obtained a <HI>stiff gale,</HI> and, as I said, <HI>weath∣ering the breakers,</HI> our girl became her own woman again.</P>
<P>After this, Master Gleaner, we <HI>shipped a mate,</HI> who, understanding every rope in the ship, is quite to our
<PB N="296" REF="034162_0962_0FFA6625B4B973A8"/>
mind; and though I say it, that should not say it, he is as honest a lad as ever stepped on board a ship. Well, the bargain was struck, and having new <HI>trimmed our sails,</HI> and <HI>hoisted our colours,</HI> we are now almost in port.</P>
<P>Deborah, <HI>d'ye see,</HI> would have clapped the whole ac∣count of our former spark, <HI>and all that there matter, under the hatches:</HI> But <HI>avast there, says I,</HI> none of your hugger-mugger smuggling doings for me—all fair and above board, says I—and so I set myself about <HI>unquoil∣ing</HI> the whole secret; and the young man was not so squeamish a milk-sop, as to like us a <HI>rope's end</HI> the worse, for all that.</P>
<P>We have lately heard, how that our old comrade has been <HI>overhauled</HI> by a smart sea-boat, who, throwing on board her <HI>grappling-irons,</HI> has made him a prisoner for life; and it is said, that he will hardly hold his head above water again: But howsomever this be, our Molly is to be married this very day se'nnight; and I, having received <HI>shipping orders,</HI> this here letter is to <HI>pipe all hands</HI> (your good woman, and all your family—the Melworths, Hamiltons, Seymours, <HI>and all them there</HI>) to the wedding. Our parson wishes huge∣ly to see you; and you cannot do less, than to be pres∣ent when he secures the <HI>bowling-knot.</HI></P>

<P>"<HI>All this is very fine,</HI>" said my uncle <HI>Wiseacre,</HI> as he laid down one of your numbers—"<HI>this here Mr. Gleaner is very fine, to be sure; but he always puts me in mind of a fresh-water spark,</HI> who once undertook to navigate a vessel, and who, being, one evening, (in plain English) desirous that the candle should be put

out, thought proper to give his orders in some of his high-flown gibberish. "<HI>Extinguish that nocturnal lu∣minary,</HI>" said he. "<HI>Oy, oy,</HI>" said the honest tars—and to work they went upon the ropes, conceiving, to be sure, that the ship's tackling had received some new∣fangled name. "<HI>Extinguish that nocturnal luminary, I say,</HI>" repeated the captain. "<HI>All's gone,</HI>" replied the mariners, still letting go the clew-lines, bunt-lines, &amp;c.—and still the candle continued burning. A third time the orders were vociferated to as little purpose, when the captain, in a bitter passion, entered his com∣plaint to the mate, who just then mounted the deck, storming violently on account of the insult he had re∣ceived. "<HI>O! never mind it, Sir,</HI>" cried the mate, "<HI>leave it to me—you shall soon be obeyed;</HI>" and turning to the sailors—"<HI>My lads,</HI>" quoth he, "<HI>douse your glim</HI>"—and "<HI>the nocturnal luminary was forthwith extin∣guished.</HI>"</P>

<P>"<HI>I KEEP no calendar of grievances,</HI>" said my uncle. We believe you have <HI>too rigidly</HI> adopted this <HI>generally good rule.</HI> You are accused of a fatiguing <HI>sameness,</HI> and of dwelling uniformly on the light side of events. It is said, you colour too highly, and that you give your sketches from a fool's paradise. Now I, you must know, undertake to defend you, and insist upon it, you are always under the guidance of truth—For, says I, two persons, setting out in a stage-coach to∣gether, may take a resolution to keep a record, which
<PB N="298" REF="034162_0964_0FFC5A1645D0C500"/>
may serve as a memorial of their excursion: The one may commit to paper, <HI>only those incidents from which he has derived satisfaction;</HI> while the other, on the contrary, may keep a faithful account of <HI>every vexatious occurrence:</HI> Compare those journals, and it is clear, they must exhib∣it a <HI>complete contrast;</HI> yet, their respective writers have been equally solicitous to preserve <HI>only facts in their collection.</HI> Thus the Gleaner seems to prefer delineat∣ing the virtues; and I do not see that he is obliged to envelop his descriptions in a sombre veil.</P>
<P>Yet, my good Sir, although I thus advocate your cause, I am, nevertheless, obliged to confess a wish, that you would give us both sides of the question; and the sole end of this letter is, to entreat you would pub∣lish a few <HI>invidious Gleaners;</HI> and remember, if they are highly tinctured with scandal, they will secure the sale of your books, and the fame of their author. A few anecdotes of private families, malevolently dished up, and plentifully besprinkled with <HI>hints, which suggest much more than is expressed,</HI> will produce a wonderfully happy effect.</P>

<P>IT is matter of wonder, that you, who profess such an attachment to your country, should, in your chap∣ter upon the progress of uneducated genius, have quite forgotten to enumerate a number of your countrymen, whose pretensions in this line are indisputable.</P>
<P>Mr. W—, one of the most celebrated painters now flourishing in Europe, is the first upon this list. His father, an honest Quaker in Pennsylvania, had fol∣lowed the occupation of a cooper, by which he had obtained a frugal support for his family. His inten∣tion was to confine his son Benjamin to the adze; and the education which he gave him was suited to this view: But the perseverance of genius being generally
<PB N="299" REF="034162_0965_0FFC5A14B726E968"/>
indefatigable, young Benjamin's chalk-strokes were oftener observed to sketch the <HI>human face divine,</HI> than to trace professional circles; and he performed such exploits, as excited the admiration of the whole village where he resided.</P>
<P>These manifestations gave his father much concern, and he seriously remonstrated against them: "Benja∣min, I charge thee to desist. I tell thee, Benjamin, thou art in the road to ruin; and if thou continuest therein, <HI>verily, verily, thou wilt be a vagabond. I must smite thee, Benjamin, if thou dost not leave these profane fooleries, and apply thyself to thy business.</HI>"</P>
<P>Benjamin endeavoured to submit to authority; but the fire of genius was not to be controlled; and a neighbour opening a public house, he undertook, on condition that he would provide the materials, and keep his secret, to paint him a sign. His leisure hours soon performed his promise; and it was exhibited with great triumph. In a country village, an event of this kind is prodigious; and the villagers collect∣ed, not to criticise, but to wonder, and to applaud: Among the rest, the father of Benjamin presented himself—</P>
<P>"And pray, friend, where didst thou pick up this famous piece of business?"</P>
<P>"If I dared to tell you, Sir—<HI>if I was sure it would not displease you</HI>—"</P>
<P>"<HI>Nay, nay, friend—Pray, why shouldst thou think it would vex me?</HI> Verily, thou hast excited my wonder; and I must entreat thee to explain thy meaning."</P>
<P>"<HI>But thou wilt be angry with Benjamin.</HI>"</P>
<P>This was enough—the secret was out. The old gentleman was greatly astonished; and, rationally concluding, that it was in vain to struggle any longer against the unequivocal decision of nature, he advised Benjamin to depart for the great city, Philadelphia, and there set up the business of sign-painting. The lad, not waiting for a repetition of this advice, took a hasty leave of his native village; and, proceeding to Philadelphia, his uncommon merit drew upon him
<PB N="300" REF="034162_0966_0FFC6219CEA6B3B0"/>
general attention. His success exceeded his most san∣guine expectations; and he speedily embarked, with strong recommendatory letters, for England, where the rapid progress which he has made, is well known to all those who have the smallest acquaintance with the history of the fine arts.</P>
<P>You are, Mr. Gleaner, advised to collect carefully, every instance of indigenous talents which falls in your way; and, as corresponding secretary to the fraterni∣ty, embodied for the purpose of promoting emula∣tion, I promise you all the assistance which we can command.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YES, FRIEND; <HI>the Saviour of sinners</HI> hath fully reconciled me to this appellation, and human nature again stands forth, invested with unalienable claims to my affection. This day, the heretofore wretched, but now comparatively happy Octavian, quitting his cottage, enters once more a world, which he had conceived he had forever renounced—enters it with new and rational views, determining to devote himself, and all that he can command, to the emolu∣ment of beings, whom he now considers of incalculable value.</P>
<P>Blessed was the night which led thee, my friend, to my <HI>then</HI> dreary abode; I would say, as for that night, let it be curtained by a veil of lucid azure; over its
<PB N="301" REF="034162_0967_0FFC6217844239A8"/>
annual round may the stars of heaven glitter with un∣usual lustre, and may it rise on my memory, the splen∣did epoch of my emancipation from tenfold darkness. The volume, which your second visit bestowed upon me—alas! why was I so long a stranger to that vol∣ume?—it is a treasure beyond all price. The beautiful simplicity of its language, and rich variety of its im∣agery—these, while they embellish, are, however, to be regarded as the most inconsiderable part of its worth. How sublime is its system of ethics! and how <HI>noble the forgiveness of injuries which it inculcates!</HI> Justly is it called the book of God; for to it is communicated the powers of <HI>restoration.</HI> Before its refulgent blaze my malignant passions prostrate, my resentments are all subdued, and I am again alive to that divine philan∣thropy, which enkindles in my bosom the best feelings of the heart.</P>
<P>What a consistent whole does this sacred book pre∣sent! It displays the Omnipotent Creator, as ruling the universe according to his righteous pleasure; as calling into existence a nature, formed by his omnific word, and pursuing a path which his <HI>wisdom foreknew.</HI> It exhibits this nature under a cloud, and subjected, <HI>for reasons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st known to paternal Deity,</HI> to a variety of er∣rors. It points to that auspicious era, when our nature, emerging from the thick darkness by which it was en∣veloped, shone forth in primeval splendor. It displays before my astonished view, <HI>God the Creator becoming God the Redeemer;</HI> and, hurrying me rapidly along through numerous intervening events, it unveils to my enrap∣tured perception, the final consummation of that august plan, the influence of which pervadeth every division of time. It exhibits the period, when crimes in their va∣riety shall be blotted from the universe; <HI>when what we have characterized as evil, shall serve to point and enhance the succeeding good;</HI> when rectitude shall be enthroned in every bosom, innocence triumphant, and peace es∣tablished throughout the wide dominions of the great Source of being. Yea, it shows me the sons and daugh∣ter of men, of <HI>every description,</HI> (even those <HI>transgressors,
<PB N="302" REF="034162_0968_0FFC621565B16A00"/>
who, finding their way hard, have come through much trib∣ulation, and washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb)</HI> collected in one grand assembly, and forever <HI>inaccessible to the progress of sorrow.</HI> Finally, it shews me the Parent of the universe, wiping from <HI>every face, every tear.</HI></P>
<P>And what am I, who presume to cherish <HI>implacable indignation</HI> against those beings, for whom Emanuel shed his blood? I shudder at myself! Hath the un∣happy woman, who has cost me so dear, sinned beyond forgiveness? What though <HI>she is lost</HI> to virtue—Did not the God who formed her, bow the heavens and come down, to seek and <HI>save that which was lost?</HI> and is she not the purchase of a suffering Redeemer?</P>
<P>Yes, I will return to the world—Adieu, ye sequest∣ered haunts; ye have witnessed those blissful illumina∣tions, which render the vast globe a paradise. The wandering, the lost Messalina, shall receive from my hand the book of God; possibly, it may produce im∣mediate reformation; but if not, she will one day be separated from that evil spirit, and those contaminat∣ing propensities, which precipitate her into such atro∣cious offences. I shall never renew with her my for∣mer engagements: Yet this resolution is not the off∣spring of resentment; but avoiding all particular ties, I henceforth devote me to the <HI>great family of man;</HI> seeking, by every means, to promote the felicity of in∣dividuals, who are so dear to their Creator, God. You, my friend, to whom I am largely indebted, will rejoice in a measure, the propriety of which you have fre∣quently enforced. The benevolence of my kinsman will also be amply gratified by this change—He will still continue my steward—he will remain in the man∣sion-house of our common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and, at my demise, a large proportion of my possessions will revert to him.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>RESPECTED SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GOOD minds are represented as viewing, with be∣nign complacency, the man, who, renouncing his er∣rors of principle, or of practice, enters with firmness the path of rectitude; and, under a persuasion of the truth of this sentiment, I presume to address you, in∣dulging a hope, that, not having bestowed a final malediction on that Alphonso, with whom you were so righteously offended, you will countenance the en∣gagements which he is about to form, and permit him to rank among those whom you direct by your coun∣cil, and sanction by your approbation.</P>
<P>But, that I may, in some measure, authorize my claim to your attention, I take leave to observe, that the lovely woman whose wrongs excited your indigna∣tion, is now <HI>perfectly restored to reason;</HI> and, that she may exemplify every benign attribute of divinity, she hath extended unto the man who hath so deeply in∣jured her, <HI>free</HI> and unreserved forgiveness. Her ven∣erable parent, too, lending a condescending ear to my supplications, bestows on my ardent vows her maternal benediction; and, for myself, when I say, that my sum of happiness exceeds the anguish by which it was preceded, I cannot give it a higher colouring. As it is to you, Sir, that I am principally indebted for both, I consider it incumbent on me to present you with a brief narration of facts, which may, in some de∣gree, palliate errors, otherwise enormous.</P>
<P>My father, departing this life, while I was yet an infant, I was left wholly under the care of my mother; and, as she had no other child, she <HI>literally</HI> devoted the remainder of her life to her son—she consulted me in
<PB N="304" REF="034162_0970_0FFC6210A66A9840"/>
every thing; and she carried her blameable indulgence to a most extravagant height. All persons who have made the early part of existence, in any sort, their study, must have observed the marked attachment which children uniformly discover to novelty. This propensity in me was gratified in every possible way; my diet, my apartment, and even my preceptors, were changed agreeably to the infantile caprice of the mo∣ment; and thus a kind of artificial inconstancy was grafted upon a wayward humour, which should have been corrected; and I was rendered <HI>habitually irresolute.</HI> Had I not been fond of my book, I should have reach∣ed manhood destitute of information; but nature, in many particulars, struggled against the ill-judged ten∣derness of my mother, who was, in every other instance, the best and most rational of women. Her demise happened soon after I had reached maturity; and the indecision of disposition, which had been so erroneous∣ly cultivated, was in nothing more manifest, than in the fluctuation of my mind, respecting my matrimonial election. A succession of amiable females alternately triumphed in my bosom, until Lavinia, dispossessing every other object, became the sovereign lady of my affections.</P>
<P>From a person so completely calculated to inspire love and perfect esteem, it could scarcely be imagin∣ed my heart could ever wander; yet, my uncertainty, in this respect, suspended a declaration which, never∣theless, the ardour of my attachment spontaneously dictated. I had not, as was supposed, formed a plan to destroy the peace of my beloved Lavinia; and the truth is, that, although I entertained a hope of being able to incline her, by my continued assiduities, to au∣thorize my pretensions, yet, such was the consummate prudence of her conduct, that, while I was permitted to view her as my <HI>tender friend,</HI> I never once conceived, that an avowal of my love was <HI>necessary to her tran∣quillity.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was I circumstanced, when the versatility of my humour once more gained the ascendency; and I
<PB N="305" REF="034162_0971_0FFC620E75975C40"/>
coolly relinquished a pursuit, in which I had so warm∣ly engaged. My attachment to Monimia was short-lived; every interview convinced me of her inferiority to the accomplished woman I had abandoned; she was by nature a coquette; and the <HI>hauteur</HI> of her tem∣per was insufferable. Absence from Lavinia, evinced the durability of her power, and I would instantly have sought her presence, had I not believed that my coldness and neglect, had given a fatal stab to that predilection with which I flattered myself she once honoured me.</P>
<P>A fixed melancholy took possession of my mind; it became a matter of indifference to me in what part of the globe I wandered; and, urged by a hope of dissi∣pating the glooms in which I was enveloped, I em∣braced the opportunity of embarking with a friend, for the purpose of making the tour of Europe. I had been absent near two years, when, meeting in France with our fair countrywoman, Madam B—, whose elegant <HI>Ruelle</HI> is the resort of every American who forms the least pretension to taste; Columbian litera∣ture very naturally made a part of our conversation. Madam B—put into my hands a manuscript which she said was to make one of a number of essays, in∣tended for publication; and, adding, that she had but recently received it from the Author, with whom she regularly corresponded, she gave me permission to put it into my pocket for the amusement of a leisure hour.</P>
<P>Retiring to my lodgings, I unfolded the manuscript; but no tongue can describe my astonishment, when I traced, in the character of Lavinia, the angel whom I conceived I had forever lost—when, in the delineation of Alphonso, I read the story of my own highly rep∣rehensible conduct! It is true, I was not conscious of a <HI>design so atrocious</HI> as was imputed to me; and yet, as I contemplated the disastrous event of that amity which had promised so fair, the anguish of my spirit was inexpressible.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="034162_0972_0FFC620C1CD27AA0"/>
The ardour of my attachment to my lovely friend, was rather augmented than diminished. Time and observation had confirmed my sentiments of her <HI>in∣comparable merit;</HI> and her image was indelibly impress∣ed on my mind.</P>
<P>With the first opportunity, I returned to my native country. Instantly I sought, and prostrated myself before the mother of Lavinia. She heard, believed, and pitied. I saw, frequently I saw, my soul's treas∣ure: But, great and good God! how changed! On me she bestowed not the smallest attention; and my misery was complete.</P>
<P>A blessed expedient, however, at length occurred to me; and, placing myself near her, during one of those fanciful and soul-piercing dialogues, which you so pa∣thetically represent the dear unfortunate as holding with me, I responded to her remarks, precisely in the manner she had the day before dictated for me. An expression of extreme astonishment immediately per∣vaded her countenance; and, bursting into a laugh of frenzy, (no words can give an idea of the poignant anguish of which that laugh was descriptive) she turn∣ed hastily round, and, beholding the vision which had so long floated only in the region of fancy, with fold∣ed arms, and a statue like appearance, substantiated before her—recollection at that moment glimmered saintly on the disk of reason; and, uttering a heart-piercing shriek, she fell senseless into my arms. It was with difficulty she was restored to life—a burst of tears succeeded—the first she had shed for many months—we bles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the copious effusion, predicting therefrom the happiest effects; No, were we disappointed—gradually she returned to reason, love, and her enraptured Al∣phonso! and hardly will the angelic sufferer permit me to express any part of that compunction, which, for a time, nearly overwhelmed me.</P>
<P>The hour which is to complete my felicity, is not far distant; and I have to entreat you, Sir, in the name of my venerable parent, in that of my beloved Lavinia, and of my own, that you would act as the
<PB N="307" REF="034162_0973_0FFC6208C57FD258"/>
nuptial father of my angel friend; and that, when I shall receive at the altar, the greatest blessing which Heaven can confer, it may be bestowed by the man to whom I owe more than my existence.</P>

<P>I AM one of a circle of females, who, submitting to certain regulations, assemble once every week in ro∣tation at our respective dwellings, appropriating an evening to needle-work, conversation, and reading. We collect winter and summer, precisely at six o'clock, and separate at ten—two hours are devoted to read∣ing, and two to conversation, &amp;c. &amp;c. The lady, in whose parlour we are guests, entertains us with a book, and the choice of the author is also referred to her. The rest of the company employ themselves with their needles, or otherwise, at their pleasure. Our design is to ameliorate, by every probable meth∣od, the morals, opinions, manners and language of each other; and to this end, we are under solemn en∣gagements to remark on the errors, and even trivial inaccuracies of gesture, or of speech, which are obser∣vable in the individuals of our association; <HI>but no mem∣ber can be accused who is not present;</HI> we are sedulously solicitous to improve, by every possible means; and we style ourselves, THE PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY.</P>
<P>Cards, scandal, and the male sex, are excluded; and it is one of the articles, to which we have severally sub∣scribed, on no occasion to discuss the actions, <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad,</HI> of any absent person, with whom we have at any peri∣od of our lives been conversant—A moment's reflec∣tion will give the reason of this regulation. The tongue of the eulogist, <HI>prone to exaggerate,</HI> too frequently <HI>de∣tracts</HI> from the merit of those persons who are occa∣sionally introduced to illustrate the virtues of a fa∣vourite;
<PB N="308" REF="034162_0974_0FFC620742218458"/>
and therefore, being solicitous to shun even the semblance of malevolence, living characters, <HI>in our confederated capacity,</HI> never pass in review before us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Virtues</HI> and the <HI>Vices, abstractedly considered,</HI> with a disquisition of the literary performances to which we attend—these, when we are not called on to the dis∣charge of our <HI>reciprocal mentorship,</HI> constitute our sub∣jects; and we also devote a part of our time to the de∣vising <HI>ways</HI> and <HI>means,</HI> for the augmentation of a little fund, which we have originated for the use of necessi∣tous persons.</P>
<P>The numbers of the Gleaner have singly come un∣der our consideration, and you may one day learn our sentiments respecting them; at present, I am only at liberty to say, that we read, with approbation, your <HI>sketches of celebrated women,</HI> and that, although you did not aim at a <HI>general collection,</HI> we are, nevertheless, surprised at your omitting two illustrious characters, whose names I am commissioned to entreat you would insert, either by way of note, or as you shall judge best.</P>
<P>The first is <HI>Margaret of Valdemar,</HI> who lived in the fourteenth century, and who, being left a widow, as∣sumed, during the minority of her son, the reins of government, discharging the duties of her high station to such universal acceptation, as to secure to herself, on his demise, by the voluntary suffrages of a brave and martial people, a continuance of regal dignity; and who, thus ascending the throne of a free and independ∣ent nation, subdued contending warriors, and succes∣sively united, in her own person, by her superior wis∣dom and magnanimity, the crowns of Denmark, Nor∣way and Sweden—who, having gloriously vanquished her enemies, extended her benign compassion to her most inveterate foe, and who, by her vigour, talents, decisive measures, and the astonishing ascendency of her princely virtues, maintained, during the remainder of her administration, throughout her extensive do∣minions, that tranquillity, which was beyond the reach of those monarchs, who were her predecessors, and of these who succeeded her.</P>

The second extraordinary personage, whom <HI>the Progressive Society</HI> takes the liberty to recommend to your notice, is <HI>Dorothy Schlozer,</HI> who was born on the 10th of August, 1770, and who early possessed an ac∣curate knowledge of the German, French, English, Italian, Swedish, and Dutch languages—who was also well versed in the Latin and Greek tongues, and who wrote elegant Latin verses—who was extensively ac∣quainted with the various branches of polite literature—who was skilled in geometry and architecture, and attached to the mathematics in general—who was a proficient in mineralogy, <HI>visiting, in person, the deepest mines, and bestowing minute attention on the several stages of the work</HI>—who was, besides, a perfect mistress of every female accomplishment, needle-work, drawing, and music—and who danced with so much taste and elegance, as to render every gentleman in a ball-room solicitous for the honour of her hand—whose knowl∣edge of history rendered her a most entertaining asso∣ciate—whose modesty, urbanity, and good sense, were equally combined—and, finally, whose astonishing ge∣nius and rare acquirements, producing her a candidate for academical honours, conducted her to the venera∣ble Assembly of Professors, held at the house of the Dean, on the 25th of August, 1790, where, submitting to a <HI>critical</HI> examination, she was, <HI>nem. con.</HI> declared competent to the degree of philosophy, when she was presented with a laurel wreath, with which honorary crown she returned to the arms of her enraptured fa∣ther. "<HI>Her degree was publickly conferred in the Uni∣versity Church, and her diploma presented to her, on the grand day of the Jubilee, September</HI> 17<HI>th,</HI> 1790," when she was no more than twenty years, one month, and seven days old.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SAGE SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LATELY passed an evening in a large company, which unanimously agreed, that you could not do bet∣ter than to write a Gleaner on the <HI>origin and progress of evil.</HI> You are to know, that our party was much divided in their opinions on this subject: Some assort∣ed the <HI>eternity of evil;</HI> others insisted, that, as it had a beginning, it must undoubtedly have an end; and a third class <HI>positively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its existence in any shape whatever!</HI></P>
<P>A few of the arguments made use of, in defence of the latter, as the most novel sentiment, I shall sketch for your information. A favourite line from a favour∣ite poet, was exultingly introduced: "<HI>From seeming
<PB N="311" REF="034162_0977_0FFC6200A9F0DCB8"/>
evil still educing good</HI>"—and the participle <HI>seeming</HI> was emphasized with great energy. The advocates of this opinion decisively said, that every thing was now in the <HI>best possible situation;</HI> and this they inferred, not on∣ly from the wisdom of the great Disposer of events, but also from the manifest inquietude produced by any sudden change. The cobler, unexpectedly receiving a purse of gold, suspended his morning and evening song; care became an inmate in that bosom, once the seat of tranquillity; nor was his mirth restored, until the glittering mischief was reclaimed by its proper owner. It was asked, How could that be character∣ized <HI>evil,</HI> which, it was acknowledged, could not be more eligibly disposed? Persons, it was said, <HI>appar∣ently</HI> miserable, are not, in <HI>fact,</HI> so: Ask the man who cannot command a shilling, at what price he estimates his <HI>limbs,</HI> his <HI>senses,</HI> his <HI>reason,</HI> his <HI>prospect of future hap∣piness;</HI> and, if he understands how to appreciate these blessings, properly, he will be found to possess immense riches. Sickness, loss of friends, and even death it∣self—Are these to be considered as <HI>evils?</HI> Certainly, that is not, <HI>strictly speaking, an evil, which is absolutely necessary to the completion of our felicity</HI>—it is, at most, but a <HI>seeming evil.</HI></P>
<P>"How often," said an old gentleman, "does a mo∣mentary pang produce the most exquisite enjoyment. I remember, when I was a young man, I had a broth∣er, whom I, at that time, loved beyond any other hu∣man being. My brother made a voyage to the East-Indies; and, after the tedious term of two years had elapsed, the ship, on board of which he embarked, ap∣peared in sight. Eager to embrace him, I jumped into a boat, which was just pushing from the quay: We had not proceeded far, when we observed the col∣ours hoisted <HI>half mast high!</HI> and the captain and the mate, standing in full view upon the deck, we had positive assurance of <HI>their</HI> safety. I knew it was not customary to display colours after that sort, except on the death of one of those officers, or of the supercargo,
<PB N="312" REF="034162_0978_0FFC61FE5C23F2F0"/>
which department was filled by my brother. The melancholy conclusion, therefore, forced itself upon me—he was undoubtedly no more—and the anguish of my spirit is not to be described. It happened, at that moment, that my brother, expecting to find me among the passengers in the boat, had placed a tele∣scope in a direction, which brought even the features of my face under his immediate inspection; and, ob∣serving the sudden alteration in my countenance, his sympathetic feelings explained the cause, when, quit∣ting instantly a situation which so effectually concealed him, he came forward to the side of the vessel, and, bowing most gracefully, laid one hand on his heart, extending the other in a manner inimitably expressive.—God knows, his figure seems, at this moment, pres∣ent to my view; and I shall never forget the exquisite transports I then experienced: Nor, <HI>since it was pro∣ductive of so much eventual happiness, can I regard, as an evil,</HI> that affection for a common sailor, which induced his comrades to announce his death, in a manner that was an acknowledged departure from the rule, usually observed on these occasions."</P>
<P>You, Mr. Gleaner, will, I apprehend, pronounce this, strange <HI>sophistical reasoning.</HI> We certainly ought to be very cautious, how we embrace such subtilties: But I will not forestall judgment. An appeal to you was generally approved, and concluded on. The mat∣ter is before you; and we expect your answer with impatience.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE GLEANER UNMASKED.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>And now in my own habiliments array'd,</L>
<L>I quit those scenes where I so oft have stray'd;</L>
<L>The curtain dropt, illusions are no more,</L>
<L>Gladly my borrow'd prowess I restore;</L>
<L>Well pleas'd, resigning an unwieldy part,</L>
<L>To blest reality I yield my heart.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BUT, gentle reader, in the moment when throw∣ing aside the veil, I appear before thee in <HI>propria persona,</HI> acknowledging myself to be that identical <HI>Constantia,</HI> whom possibly thou mayest recollect, as fill∣ing some pages in the Boston, and afterwards in the Massachusetts Magazine—In the moment, I say, when thou art recognizing, <HI>in thy friend the Gleaner, this said Constantia,</HI> it may be proper to render unto thee a reason, why I have endeavoured to pass myself upon thee in the masculine character; and as I now take leave of every <HI>unnecessary</HI> disguise, it is my determina∣tion to be very explicit.</P>
<P>Observing, in a variety of instances, the indifference, not to say contempt, with which female productions are regarded, and seeking to arrest attention, at least for a time, I was thus furnished with a very powerful motive for an assumption, which I flattered myself would prove favourable to my aspiring wishes. I an∣ticipate, on this occasion, the <HI>significant shrug</HI> and ex∣pressive smile of the <HI>pedantic petit-maitres;</HI> Esop's fa∣ble of the <HI>Ass in the Lion's skin,</HI> will be triumphantly revived; and it will be affirmed, that the <HI>effeminacy</HI> and <HI>tinsel glitter</HI> of my style could not fail of <HI>betraying</HI> me at every sentence which I uttered. But, having passed the rubicon, it is necessary that I possess suffi∣cient firmness to remain undismayed by the attacks of
<PB N="314" REF="034162_0980_0FFC61FA271F4240"/>
the ill disposed critic. My ingenuity did not furnish me with any expedient, so well calculated for conceal∣ment, as the envelopment in which I enwrapped my∣self; and having conceived, that in my borrowed character I should become abundantly more useful, I felt assured that this consideration was in reality suf∣ficient to justify the measure.</P>
<P>Another strong inducement to the assumption and continuance of my disguise, was the opportunity it af∣forded me of making myself mistress of the unbiassed sentiments of my associates. A few persons were im∣measureably partial to my essays; and, as it generally happens, those were the individuals with whom alone I was <HI>intimately</HI> conversant. I had the good fortune to elude the penetration of my best friend, and he read in my presence my first Essay, entitled the Glean∣er, without the shadow of a suspicion of its author. Thus I went on; nor was it until my thirty-third num∣ber, which contains the story of Eliza, that the person, to whom I am principally accountable for my con∣duct, declared his conviction that I was the real author of the Gleaner. <HI>The fact,</HI> from which the little narra∣tive of Eliza originated, I received from my husband; I might have predicted the consequence—I was of course detected.</P>
<P>But I had yet a further reason for concealment; I was ambitious of being considered <HI>independent as a writer;</HI> if I possessed any merit, I was solicitous it should remain undiminished, nor did I harbour a wish that my errors should be imputed to another; and I imagined I could effectually accomplish my views in this particular, by suffering my connexions of every description to remain in total ignorance of my plans; nor in I conceive myself culpable in thus acting, since I was not seeking to wound the feelings of any human being, and it was hardly possible I could <HI>essen∣tially</HI> dishonour those affectionate friends, to whom my heart has ever acknowledged the most ardent and grateful attachment.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="034162_0981_0FFC61F8A39D5710"/>
<HI>Rosseau</HI> has said, that although a female may <HI>ostensibly</HI> wield the pen, yet it is certain some man of letters sits behind the curtain to guide its movements; and, con∣templating this assertion, I imagined that if those of the <HI>literati,</HI> to whose aid either friendship or affinity might entitle me, were not so far of my council as even to be informed of my designs, they would at least be exempted from those censures which my folly or pre∣sumption might involve.</P>
<P>A celebrated writer of the present century observes, that "a <HI>woman</HI> ought never to suffer a <HI>man</HI> to add a <HI>single word</HI> to her writings; if she does, the man she consults, let him be who he may, will always pass for the original inventor, while she will be accused of put∣ting her name to the works of others;" and surely the feelings of rectitude must revolt even at a suspicion of this kind.</P>
<P>Thus much I have thought proper to say, by way of responding to some invidious remarks, which my <HI>manner</HI> of conducting the foregoing papers, particular∣ly their masculine character, have occasioned.</P>
<P>The reader is already apprized, that the numbers which constitute the first volume of the Gleaner were ushered into the world in that very respectable miscel∣lany, the Massachusetts Magazine; and my original design was to continue them in that publication. My secret was now generally known, but I had no reason to be dissatisfied with the reception given to my hum∣ble attempts, and I had many pages prepared for the press. It has frequently been asked, both in public and private, "why the Gleaner was discontinued?" The very respectable and learned gentleman, whose love of literature induced him, on the resuscitation of the Magazine, in the spring of 1795, to become its editor, complained, and with reason, of the paucity of original productions, which immediately succeeded the arduous engagement into which he had entered: yet, for myself, largely indebted to the candour of the new editor, I am free to own, that if any consideration
<PB N="316" REF="034162_0982_0FFC61F5D31F1888"/>
could have induced me to continue a writer in that publication, my perfect confidence in the superintend∣ent to whose revision my sketches would have been submitted, must have furnished the motive. But dur∣ing the suspension of the miscellany so often adverted to, a <HI>serious accusation was preferred against me,</HI> the na∣ture of which, in my own apprehension, effectually barred my appearance in its pages.</P>
<P>I have pledged myself to a public, which I do most sincerely venerate, to render a reason, "<HI>why</HI> the Glean∣er was not continued in the Magazine;" and although I might content myself with observing, that its irreg∣ularity, and the uncertainty of its duration, together with the years which must have elapsed, ere the com∣pletion of my plan could have been exhibited, were ex∣tremely adverse to my views; yet, agreeably to my en∣gagement, I had arranged a circumstantial detail, which developed the <HI>real cause</HI> that hath produced me, in my <HI>individual character,</HI> a candidate for the indulgence of my readers; <HI>my design,</HI> however, is superseded; a few sincere friends, whose disinterested attachment cannot be considered as problematical, and from whose judg∣ment reason hesitated to appeal, warmly remonstrating against it, rendered it incumbent upon me to deliber∣ate—deliberation produced conviction—and, certain that a recurrence to facts, which were productive of much infelicity, can answer no valuable purpose, I gladly consign the promised narrative to oblivion; and if a recollection of my proposals for this publica∣tion should procure an impeachment of my veracity, I trust, when it is known, that my original intention has been relinquished from the fear of agita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g the feelings of malevolence, the pleadings of candour will procure my absolution.</P>
<P>If the manner in which my dramatic essays are introduced, should require an apology, it may be suf∣ficient to observe that it was requisite to the uniformity of my plan; and I have presumed that as it was my wish to promote, by those productions, the interests of
<PB N="317" REF="034162_0983_0FFC61F390392ED8"/>
rectitude, they will not, in this <HI>enlightened age,</HI> give offence even to the most <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>delicate</HI> mind; their history may, in some future period, amuse the curious; and for the present, it only remains to say, that, as I constructed them without a coadjutor, it is but justice their errors, of every description, should rest entirely upon my own head.</P>
<P>Nor are the numerous faults with which these volumes may abound, to be imputed to any other individual. In this arduous enterprise, however daring, I have stood alone. To the toil of writing letters to myself, I have been condemned; and to this cause the candid will impute that want of variety of which they have doubtless complained. The aberra∣tion of unassisted fancy, however unwearied the intel∣lectual research, does not always answer the wishes of its proprietor; and, although the infrequency of origi∣nal views may be lamented, it must, nevertheless, be submitted to.</P>
<P>My sketches have <HI>seldom</HI> been drawn from <HI>living characters;</HI> but I will confess I have experienced supe∣rior pleasure in once more embodying those virtues that I have seen exemplified by persons who have bid adieu to those scenes which they have heretofore illumined by their presence; and imagination has delighted to produce them again in that radiant career in which it was their great business to soothe and to bless the FAMILY OF MAN.</P>
<P>To my very respectable and numerous Patrons and Patronesses, I am largely indebted. It would be my pride to enhance their pleasures. Could I, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> return for the liberal countenance by which they have hon∣oured me, bestow on them tranquillity, with every attendant blessing, it would be equally my duty and my felicity thus to do: But, although my efforts are inadequate to any important effect, I cannot, how∣ever, suppress the fervid emotions of gratitude with which my breast is replete. The most ardent wishes for their happiness are wafted warm from
<PB N="318" REF="034162_0984_0FFC61F040570940"/>
my heart. May the good they communicate be re∣turned a thousand fold into their own bosoms—and may they, when encompassed about by those misfor∣tunes to which humanity is incident, reflect <HI>rationally</HI> on the <HI>brevity</HI> of the present scene, and upon the incal∣culable bliss which awaits them in the regions of im∣mortality.</P>
<P>Such are, and such will continue to be the fervent aspirations of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Their highly obliged, Truly grateful, And very humble servant, CONSTANTIA.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
