<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE EPIDEMICAL FEVER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I first determined on publishing the pre∣sent pamphlet, it was my intention to have presented the Public with a Work not inferior to the one pub∣lished by that indefatigable man, and meritorious Au∣thor, Mr. Mathew Carey, of Philadelphia▪ and to accomplish this desirable object, I applied to several medical friends to write a Dissertation upon the dis∣ease, with a statement of such important facts as came within their knowledge, and promised to furnish them with all that I could obtain. In this pleasing anticipa∣tion, however, I have been much disappointed, for each and all declined undertaking the business, for lo∣cal reasons. I mention this circumstance as an apolo∣gy for my coming forward, I trust, before an indulgent Public. The great satisfaction which many strangers may derive from perusing an accurate list of the deaths, and thereby discovering, in a degree, whether or not, their friends and connexions are still living, in∣duced me to procure the statement which is annexed to the Work.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to hazard any opinion what∣ever, upon the disease, whether imported or originat∣ing in local causes; but simply to collect the several letters and other publications which have appeared on the subject, and which I conceive will be found any way interesting or satisfactory to the reader. The proceedings of the Health Committee, the different
<PB N="6" REF="028538_0004_0FD937FDF0338210"/>
letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are arranged agreeable to the dates on which they appeared.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be considered a duty incumbent on me to say something concerning the situation of the city, previous to the introduction or appearance of the disease: and in these remarks, as well as in any others I may have occasion to offer, I shall be as laconic as the nature of the subject will permit.</P>
<P>New York was, doubtless, one of the most increas∣ing and flourishing cities in the United States. Some idea may be formed of its rapid population, by remark∣ing, that in the year 1791 it contained about 4,700 families, and in May 1795 about 9,000. This state∣ment is from the City Directory, which is annually tak∣en. Since the commencement of the present war be∣tween France and the combined despots, the necessaries of life had progressively risen, till they had arrived at an enormous price, and in many particulars beyond what was ever remembered here before. Such is the effect the war had, and still continues to have on Ame∣rica, at least this part of it, notwithstanding our <HI>boasted neutrality:</HI> What is still more distressing, the rise of mecha∣nical labour had by no means been equal, or bore a just proportion to the former. The one had risen, in many in∣stances, an hundred per cent. while the other, generally speaking, had not rise more than from twenty-five to thir∣ty. The rent of houses had also nearly doubled, particu∣larly those which were situated in the most public streets.</P>
<P>These circumstances rendered it difficult for people in moderate stations, to do more than maintain and edu∣cate their families. The city, however, was fast in∣creasing in luxury and pride, those barriers to happi∣ness; and many who considered <HI>virtue</HI> and not <HI>num∣bers,</HI> the strength of a republic, dreaded the future consequences. Splendor, pomp, and dissipation, were at a shameful height. Money was in great demand: The interest frequently given was from two to three per cent a month.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028538_0005_0FD937FFD30B4E20"/>
In consequence of the enormous price of rents, ma∣ny families, particularly among the Irish emigrants, were reduced to the necessity of living, or rather exist∣ing, in damp cellars, and among this class of people it will be found that the disorder was most prevalent, and operated most powerfully. I believe it may be safely asserted, that a very large proportion of those, in tole∣rable situations, who had proper medical aid in the ear∣ly stages of the disorder, and were regularly attended afterwards, perfectly recovered in the course of ten or fifteen days.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to a few remarks on the general symptoms of the disease.</P>
<P>"THIS malady, in many instances, has been pre∣ceded by an unusual flow of spirits, though for the most part a degree of stupor has been observed; some hours after they are attacked with violent pains in the head, back and loins: The bowels are extremely cos∣tive, seldom yielding but to powerful purgatives, and the tongue soon becomes considerably foul. In some cases, the pulse is strong and tense; the countenance flushed; the eyes greatly inflamed; the pains more violent, and respiration very laborious. In others, and more particularly those of a slender habit of body, the pulse is weak, though frequent; the face rather pale and of a yellowish tinge; a constant desire for sleep; soreness over the whole system, and extreme debility. About the third and fourth days the symptoms become more violent; the tongue is dry and covered with a black scurf; the appetite greatly impaired; respiration more difficult; the pulse scarcely to be discerned; sud∣den startings, when in a dose, as though affrighted; a sense of weight around the praecordia; the body more yellow, but particularly the face and breast; the ex∣tremities cold; the stomach unable to retain its con∣tents, and what is thrown up in vomiting, has the ap∣pearance of black coffee grounds; a hemorrhage of the fauces, and frequently a discharge of blood with the
<PB N="8" REF="028538_0006_0FD9380535C13B00"/>
stools, which were now perfectly black; convulsive motions of the superior extremities, and shortly death terminated the scene. The body now put on every appearance of immediate putrefaction.</P>
<P>In one person whom I had an opportunity of visiting, attacked in this alarming manner, the lower extremities were almost black; the evacuations involuntary; the parts to which blisters were applied, were seemingly mortified; the blood oozed out of every part where it could find vent, and in fact he was a perfect mass of putrefaction, before the vital functions were sus∣pended<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS. Of George Davis.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark, that a very great dif∣erence of opinion prevailed among the physicians, both as to the disease and the treatment of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Another circum∣stance which engaged much of the public attention was the appearance of an advertisement in the newspapers, against the mode of treating the disease by the practiti∣oners in general, and challenging them to defend their practice. The author was Mr. Alexander Cuthill, taylor. Which of the parties were right is not my province to determine; but to state facts is my object. In some instances the doctors positively refused visiting a patient who had been seen during his indisposition by Mr. Cuthill; and in others discontinued their visits on finding that he also came to the house where the sick person lay. I leave the public to draw what inference they please from these facts.</P>
<P>A general opinion has prevailed, among medical cha∣racters in particular, that the present epidemic has made its appearance in a greater or less degree, among us du∣ring the autumns of the last three or four years. That a malignant fever did rage here, during the months of September and Oct. of 1791, is a fact, and on compa∣ring the symptoms with those of the present disease, they will be found not dissimilar. It is worthy of no∣tice that the fever in 1791 first made its appearance
<PB N="9" REF="028538_0007_0FD93807FB3760C8"/>
within a few yards of the spot where it has proved most fatal the present season.</P>
<P>"About the middle of August, 1791, a contagious fever appeared in the city of New York, which first discovered itself near Peck slip, a part of the city thick∣ly inhabited; its houses generally small, and badly ventulated: many of the inhabitants were in indigent circumstances, which is a frequent cause of the want of cleanliness. Here it raged a considerable time; it then began to spread, as some attendants on the sick be∣came affected, who lived in other neighbourhoods.—</P>
<P>By this means it was carried to different families, and most generally could be traced from this source. It likewise proved more particularly fatal near the place where it first appeared, than in any other part. Thus, at length it spread through the city, until about the middle of October, when the weather growing a little cooler, the disease greatly abated, and in a short time nearly disappeared. I have been informed by several physicians of reputation, who reside and practice in the country, that many of the boatmen who frequented the city from Long Island, and the upper part of Hud∣son's river, carried the disease home, where it proved fatal to several<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor William Moore, an eminent physician of New-York, informed me that a gentleman of Lime, in the state of Connecticut, was on a visit to this city when he became a patient of his, in whom the disease was evidently marked, attended with large vibices; he, however recruited considerably before he left the city: on his pas∣sage to Lime he relapsed, and died shortly after he reached home. The greater part of his family caught the contagion, and soon be∣came affected with a similar disease; which proved fatal to his mo∣ther, and some other persons in the family.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the same time in the south western part of the city, an intermittent and remittent fever prevailed, to∣gether with a few cases of dysentery. This caused much dispute among physicians as they generally na∣med the disease from the cases which they had an op∣portunity
<PB N="10" REF="028538_0008_0FD93809A3BBFAD0"/>
of seeing most prevalent. Some called it a remittent, others billious; some typhus, putrid, or ma∣lignant; and others, following Sydenham, <HI>febris, bili∣osa remittens.</HI></P>
<P>In consequence of a few cases terminating suddenly fatal, together with the very unjust, as well as unge∣nerous judgment of some physicians, in determining every disease to be the putrid fever, fear spread from mind to mind like a devouring famine, and terror, fre∣quently more hideous than the disease itself, wrought on the minds of the credulous and weak. This, in some cases, greatly increased the malignity of the fever: in others again, even a slight head ache caused them to despond, and threw them into a state of languor more easily conceived than described; but without the real symptoms of the fever. Whether this diagnostic was given through ignorance, or as a professional trick, in order to gain applause, by making many and speedy cures, is uncertain; however, it was nevertheless so considered. Thus some physicians obtained a credit in curing the complaint, without possessing any real merit.</P>
<P>This disease, generally, in the first place, affected the person with a sense of chilliness, alternating with gen∣tle flushings and a sense of soreness of all the muscles; the face appeared pale, the features shrunk, the body weary, as if it had undergone some great fatigue, at∣tended with yawnings and stretchings of the extremities; a disinclination for any bodily exercise; and when any exertion was made, it was attended with sluggishness and unweary sensations. The pulse at this time was weak and frequent; the mental faculties were likewise impaired, and frequently a small pain in the head, at∣tended with sighings and anorexy: respiration being anxious and rather small at this stage of the disease.</P>
<P>In some cases the following symptoms took place without the patient's knowledge of the former having past: they however, in general, preceded, violent pains in the head, back, loins; a pulse more tense, full, and
<PB N="11" REF="028538_0009_0FD9380B01644708"/>
something increased in fullness. (In one case the pati∣ent compared the pulsation of the temporal arteries, to the striking of a hammer against his temples. In some a delirium came on immediately after the cold stage, so that the persons affected got out of their beds, and wandered about their rooms or houses. Sometimes nausea and vomiting appeared early in the disease, which proved very troublesome, and greatly debilitated the patient. Respiration was now rather laborious than anxious; the skin dry and hot, belly most com∣monly costive, though some had a gentle diarrhoea from the beginning of the disease; no appetite, but a great desire for drink, particularly any united with ve∣getable acids, as the acid of lemons, &amp;c. the adnatae of the eyes, in some, were much inflamed, so that the light became scarcely tolerable; the countenance, on the first and second days, in many, appeared much flushed, attended continually with a violent head ache, so as frequently to produce delirium, with restlessness and watchings, which greatly exhausted the patient's strength; the tongue was generally dry, and in the beginning of the disease covered with a whitish scurf, and the patient complained much of anxiety, or a great sense of weight at the praecordia; the excrementitious discharges, whether natural, or produced by art, were very fetid and disagreeable.</P>
<P>About the third day the inflammatory symptoms greatly changed to those of a putrid kind, or a remis∣sion took place; if the latter did not succeed, the tongue became dry, and began to be covered with brown or black <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ordes; not long after the teeth and lips put on the same appearance; respiration became now anxious, with an increased prostration of strength: the vital functions at this time were much more dis∣turbed; watching, or a comatose state, now took place, if it had not before appeared; and even those who did sleep, enjoyed it but for a few moments, when they waked as if in a fright: the pulse became
<PB N="12" REF="028538_0010_0FD9380EF6BC2948"/>
smaller, weaker, and more frequent; thirst was greatly increased; nausea much more intolerable, together with the sense of oppression at the stomach: those who had not vomited before, had that direful symptom added now to the others; the contents of the stomach, which were thrown up in the act of vomiting, were generally of a fetid nature; the voice began to be changed; small petechiae appeared about the neck and breast, when the body, and even the room, unless well ventulated, had a cardaverous smell. The pa∣tient kept continually rolling or turning in the bed, and frequently picking the bed-clothes. In some, the bowels, at this stage of the disease, were very costive, so that recourse was obliged to be had to artificial means, whenever it became necessary to evacuate their contents: in others, a profuse diarrhoea considerably increased the weakness of their debilitated bodies. Most generally on the fourth or fifth day of the dis∣ease, with those to whom it proved fatal, all the last mentioned symptoms were greatly increased, together with a cardaverous smelling sweat, which would appear on the body, when the trunk was hot, and the ex∣tremities cold: the pulse became more frequent, irre∣gular, and sometimes intermittent: the person would lay on his back, with his knees drawn up, and his body appearing as if falling down in the bed; his voice low, and scarcely perceptible: he was now senseless of persons standing around, or any of their proceedings: the pulse in this stage of the disease was so weak as scarcely to be felt; the extremities put on a livid appearance. From the comatose state, which had already taken place, the patient could hardly be roused by the strongest stimuli of sound and light, though in the beginning of the disease he was scarcely able to bear the most gentle; and if he should be roused from the situation, in a few moments the same would again succeed. The urine and stools were fre∣quently involuntarily discharged; a hiccup followed,
<PB N="13" REF="028538_0011_0FD9381064F0F090"/>
if it had not before taken place; and the person, in consequence of universal debility producing inability to discharge the natural secretion in the bronchial vessels, appeared as if choaking with phlegm, or something pent up in the trachea: convulsions, or subsultus ten∣dinum, now affected the frame; the eyes put on a glassy appearance, and death, in a short time, closed the scene.</P>
<P>This was the general course of the symptoms in those to whom the disease proved fatal; but in some, they came on a little sooner, in others later: in some the pe∣techiae, and even maculae and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ices, extended over the body before death, though all shewed evident signs of putrescency directly after.</P>
<P>In one person, on the afternoon of the second day, an entire intermission of his symptoms took place; on the morning of the third, they returned with increased violence, when a vomiting came on with apthae appear∣ing in the mouth and fauces. Upon taking a few drops of any thing in the stomach, vomiting would immedi∣ately be produced, which terminated in hiccup; this continued a few minutes; it would then subside until any thing was again swallowed, when the same cir∣cumstances returned. Petechia appeared on his neck and breast the fifth day, and as nothing could be retain∣ed on his stomach, he was supported with glysters of broth for several days, to which, as there was no other way of administering it, the red bark was added. The pulse in this person remained good, until within a few hours of his death, when it began to diminish, weaken and become intermittent. From this time it was remark∣ed any thing would remain on his stomach; the hiccup ceased, and death in a few hours closed the scene. This was on the morning of the seventh day.</P>
<P>In some the disease made its appearance in a more gradual manner, without any inflammatory symptoms attending it, and most commonly those were protracted beyond the eleventh or fourteenth days, when a remis∣sion
<PB N="14" REF="028538_0012_0FD93816637047E8"/>
or intermission took place, or the person sunk un∣der the disease. There were some who recovered, as well as those who perished, on whom petechial eruptions appeared; and the stomach in many of those who sur∣vived was very much disordered.</P>
<P>Some had other accidental symptoms accompanying the disease, such as a dry ickling cough, pains in differ∣ent parts of the thorax, twith other catarrhal and pneu∣monic symptoms; so that some physicians were induced to declare it a simple inflammatory fever and treat it ac∣cordingly. In other patients a billious yellowness ap∣peared over the surface of the body, the vessels in the adnatae of the eyes were filled with bile, and attended with the other symptoms of Dr. Cullen's species of ty∣phus, the icteroides.</P>
<P>Many of those who survived the disease were a long time troubled with rheumatic pains of a chronic nature, or a small eruption over the surface of their bodies, which seemed to be caused by the debilitated state in which the disease had left them; and the eruption ap∣peared to depend particularly on a weakened action of the extreme vessels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Addoms's dissertation on the malignant fever which prevail∣ed in the city of New-York during the months Aug. Sept. and Oct. 1791.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>I have thought proper to quote the preceding account of the fever which prevailed here in 1791, from Dr. J. S. Addoms' dissertation; and shall now return to the object of this publication.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia, "It was some time before the disorder attracted public notice<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mathew Carey.</NOTE>;" very opposite was the case in New York, for before the complaint made any progress whatever, the Health Committee pro∣ceeded to the discharge of their duty. The first death which created alarm was that of Dr. M. Treat, Health officer of the port, on the 29th of July. By some it is believed he took the infection by visiting a vessel
<PB N="15" REF="028538_0013_0FD938183B0A6910"/>
from the West Indies, having a malignant fever on board; by others (physicians) it is positively asserted that he did not die of an imported disorder; but by all, I believe, it is allowed that he died of the epidemic which has since proved so fatal to many.</P>
<P>The disorder first made its appearance in July, at the upper end of Water street, near New slip, and here it continued for a very considerable time, not spreading out of that street, a few instances excepted, until the month of September, after which, in some degree, it prevailed throughout the city; but ultimately proved most mortal in the street where it commenced. Near New slip there had recently been opened a small street, called George street; it had been much neglected; was very filthy, and principally inhabited by people in indigent circumstances; not less than sixty persons were buried out of it, within the small compass of twenty houses. The disease also proved very fatal about the Fly market, and from thence, in Water street, to the Coffee house. The alarm became pretty general in the beginning of September, and the citizens at that period commenced removing into the country. The recent sufferings of Philadelphia and Baltimore, occa∣sioned a greater fear of infectious fevers than would otherwise, probably, have existed. The hasty burials after death, was also a cause of great <HI>dread;</HI> the mode was no less terrifying: For the speedy removal of the dead, a hearse was provided, drawn by an horse, and attended by two men. As soon as the breath was out of the body, these men were sent for; they usually brought a coffin and tarred sheet with them, in which the corpse was wrapped, put into the coffin, and drove off to Potter's Field, a place purchased for the burial of strangers and the poor, and entered without the at∣tendance of single connexion or friend to bemoan their loss. It is asserted, and doubtless is a fact, that in many instances the hearse came for the sick, while yet living, and that coffins have been in the house for some
<PB N="16" REF="028538_0014_0FD9381982B154C0"/>
hours before the death of the persons for whom they were destined. No excuse can be plead for such pro∣ceedings, but the general consternation which prevailed.</P>
<P>The fever itself did not, in many instances, occasion more alarm than the hearse; as a proof of this many cases might be enumerated of women fainting away at the sight of it, and being sometime before they perfect∣ly recovered; and in others it has occasioned hysteria, and a fever succeeded. One striking instance of the effect of fear, and which came within my own knowledge, was in a young woman who for some days dreaded the disease: at length she was seized with it, and a delirium in a day or two ensued; during the whole of her in∣disposition, which was five or six days, she constantly complained against the hearse and tarred sheet, and al∣most her last request when dying, was, that the family would not suffer her to be buried in this manner.</P>
<P>About the middle of September, some persons, by what authority I know not, undertook burning tar one night in the streets: This became a topic of conversa∣tion, and among those of weak minds increased the a∣larm: in short, a coincidence of circumstances like these doubtless operated to the disadvantage of the city, as the rumour spread through the country, much exagge∣rated, and thereby, in many instances prevented sup∣plies from coming into town.</P>
<P>The sufferings of the poor were great; a Lazaretto was prepared for their reception, and a physician and nurses appointed to attend them: but unfortunately great prejudices prevailed against it, and many were of an opinion that the patients did not receive proper at∣tention, particularly from the nurses: as I have not been able at this early period, to procure satisfactory documents on the subject, I shall suspend any animad∣versions.</P>
<P>"The Lazaretto, or pest-house at Belle Vue, a few miles from New York, on the East River, has, though a healthy place, and under good regulations, been con∣sidered
<PB N="17" REF="028538_0015_0FD9381D38981538"/>
by the people at large, <HI>as the house of death.</HI>—So odious is the very idea of being placed there, that there is high probability the objection of mind atten∣dant upon their getting into new quarters, and the anxiety and fatigue consequent upon being moved thi∣ther, have contributed, in several instances, to lessen their chance of recovery.</P>
<P>The governors of the City Hospital gave directions, in pursuance of there being a Lazaretto provided for those sick of the yellow fever, that no case, supposed to be of that, or any other infectious disease, should be admitted into that charity. It was reported that several poor persons, who had been recommended as patients to the Hospital, were considered by the phy∣sicians as improper, by reason of suspected contagion, to be admitted into the house. In consequence of re∣jection there, it has happened that men, like calves and other live stock, have been put upon carts at the Hospital, and drawn thence in succession to the doors of several of the members of the Health Committee, over the stony roughness of the pavement, and under the scorching rays of a noon-tide fun! a procedure which stirred up indignation, as well as alarm, in the citizens who saw it.</P>
<P>The general anxiety, caused by a concurrence of fearful circumstances, operated so powerfully upon many per∣sons whose children were students of Columbia College that applications for leave of absence, in order to remove to the country, became very frequent. The students participated the alarm of their parents and guardians, and became intent on departing. The greater part discontinued their attendance on the lectures, by direc∣tion of their friends, and the rest withdrew themselves by degrees, so that in a few days nobody appeared on the ringing of the bell, and the professors gave up their labours of tuition. There was never any formal ad∣journment of the College. The prevailing sentiment
<PB N="18" REF="028538_0016_0FD9381E88E563B8"/>
of the board of professors was, "That no such thing ought to take place, as not warranted by any real cause of alarm."</P>
<P>Much praise is due to the Health Committee for their attention to the distresses of the poor, and it is not to be doubted, but some valuable citizens were snatched from the jaws of death by their timely assist∣ance. Mr. Frederick Steymets, a member of this body, fell a victim to the disease, much lamented by all who knew him. His attention in the discharge of his duty was unlimited, and it is expected, will ever be remembered with gratitude by all good citizens. Capt. Buchanan, who voluntarily offered his services to visit the sick, and distribute such monies as were put into his hands by the Committee, also died of the epidemic: It is only necessary to remark that this worthy man fulfil∣led his duty with promptitude, and that he afforded the poor and indigent all the consolation and relief that was in his power; society has lost in him a valuable mem∣ber. There are many more whose services have been of equal importance with those already enumerated; but among these I shall name one man only; a man who sacrificed every kind of interest to assist and relieve the distressed, and whose philanthrophy it is hoped will ne∣ver be forgotten. I refer to Mr. Levi Wayland; to enumerate his virtues would require more time than can be well spared; I shall therefore only remark that he was a good citizen, and a sincere friend: He died of the epidemic, in the 31st, year of his age, on the 12th, of October.</P>
<P>Having given a sketch of the principle occurrences that took place during the months of August, Sept. and Oct. I shall next proceed to arrange the proclamations, letters, &amp;c. of the governor, Health Committee, &amp;c.</P>

to the spread of any malignant disease, but at the same time convinced of the necessity of a faithful detail of facts, as far as they have come to their knowledge. When the public is addressed on this subject, the Com∣mitte of Health think proper to declare, that in their opinion, no circumstance has existed in this city which ought to have occasioned the alarm which is said to have gone forth. It is true that a fever precisely like one which has twice, in the course of four or five years been observed, in the autumnal seasons, in this place, has a∣gain made its appearance. Some sea-faring men have fallen victims to it. It is suspected to have originated on board a certain vessel which lay at Fitche's wharf, but of this there can be obtained no decided evidence. Notwithstanding which, the vessel has been ordered off in the stream. It is suspected also, but without de∣cided evidence, that our late worthy health officer fell a victim to some unguarded exposure, to an infected corpse on board a vessel. Besides him, notwithstand∣ing the most diligent enquiry, we have obtained infor∣mation of not more than eight deaths happening among our citizens since the 20th of last month, from fevers, supposed in any degree malignant. The number of per∣sons killed by the imprudent use of cold water, has been remarkable, and labourers and others actively employ∣ed, ought to be frequently cautioned on this head. The Committee have taken the most prompt and effec∣tual measures to guard the health of their fellow citizens; a house is prepared at Belle Vue for the reception of sick persons, who may be suspected of infection, with very agreeable accomodations, subsistence, and medical aid.</P>
<P>All vessels coming from Foreign countries, from which there is any reason to apprehend the introduc∣tion of infectious fevers, are now obliged to remain be∣low Governor's Island, until visited by the health offi∣cer, and a regular permit for their entry be granted. The citizens ought to consider it their duty individually to report to the committee, any person who may at∣tempt
<PB N="20" REF="028538_0018_0FD9382548ED85C0"/>
to evade this precaution, that the penalty of the law may be enforced. The practitioners of physic in the city, have been particularly requested to be early and faithful in reporting any dangerous or suspicious case. A hearse is provided, and may be readily ob∣tained by an application to the chairman of the Com∣mittee, or any one of the aldermen, for the early buri∣al of the dead, whenever it shall be thought necessary, a practice earnestly recommended during the hottest season, it being a well established fact, that the body of a patient who during life could give no infection, may yet, when a corps, be suddenly rendered capable of so doing in a great degree. The Committee are of opinion, from taking into their consideration, the pre∣sent state of the health of the city, the uncommon de∣gree of heat in the weather, and the lengthy period it is yet to elapse, before the season arrives which is usu∣ally observed to check the progress of autumnal dis∣eases, that great care and circumspection are necessary. Moderation, regularity and cleanliness, are especially recommended.</P>
<P>The cleanliness of the streets, yards, cellars and markets, and the removal of all putrescent matter, are objects of very great importance, and ought to be par∣ticularly attended to, especially in those parts of the city, which are contiguous to our Eastern waters.</P>

<HEAD>In the name and by the authority of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (L. S.) By Thos. Mifflin, gov. of the said commonwealth. A PROCLAMATION.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas the Board of Inspectors of the Health Of∣fice of Philadelphia have reported to me, that it ap∣pears from authentic information to them exhibited, that an infectious or contagious disease exists in the city of New-York, in the state of New-York, and that there is reason also to believe, that a similar disease exists in the town of Norfolk, in the state of Virginia, so that the safety and health of the citizens of Philadelphia require a stoppage of intercourse with the said infected places. <HI>Therefore,</HI> in pursuance of the duty in such case on me enjoined by law, but with a sincere regret for the un∣happy occasion, I, the said Thos. Mifflin, governor of the said commonwealth, have deemed it expedient to issue this proclamation, hereby prohibiting for the term of one month, or until such prohibition shall be by proclamation lawfully revoked, all intercourse between the said city of Philadelphia, and the said city of New-York and the said town of Norfolk, and any place or places within five miles thereof, respectively, as well by land as by water, under the penalty of three hundred dollars, to be recovered from, and paid by each and e∣very person transgressing the said prohibition in the man∣ner herein after specified, agreeably to the terms and directions of the act of the General Assembly, in such case made and provided: and to the intent, that suita∣ble and sufficient measures may be taken and pursued for carrying into effect the said prohibition, I have fur∣ther deemed it expedient hereby to request that as well

the mayor, aldermen, and other officers of the city, as the inspectors of the Health Office of the port of Phila∣delphia, shall and will, with all possible vigilance and lawful authority and power, guard the various avenues or entrances into the said city of Philadelphia, by land and by water, so that any person or persons having been in the said city of New-York, or the said town of Norfolk, within the space of ten days, and attempting to transgress the said prohibition, by approaching near∣er to the said city of Philadelphia, than five miles, shall be forthwith remanded to the place or places where such person or persons respectively came or shall be conveyed (at the discretion of the said mayor and al∣dermen, or of the said inspectors) to the Hospital on Staten Island, and there kept as long as the case may require. And all citizens, particularly those who have been in any wise concerned, or shall be acquainted with the intercourse between the said city of Philadel∣phia, and the said infected places, are earnestly exhort∣ed and enjoined to give to the mayor, or some other magistrate of the said city, or to the inspectors of the Health Office, the earliest information of any and eve∣ry attempt, which shall be made to transgress, or evade the prohibition aforesaid, in order that the offender or offenders may be dealt with according to law.</P>

<HEAD>To Dr. Amasa Dingley, President of the College of Physicians, New York.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When the Committee of Health, at the commence∣ment of the present alarm, addressed to their medical fellow citizens a letter, requesting their aid and advice,
<PB N="28" REF="028538_0026_0FD9383A426D2B88"/>
in the execution of their trust, it was not only thought the most prudent (because the most silent) but it was viewed and intended to be as respectful a mode of con∣sulting them as any that could be devised. It is, there∣fore, with some astonishment, as well as sincere regret, they hear that <HI>many if not most,</HI> of the medical charac∣ters of this city have been so far offended at this pro∣cedure, as actually to resolve to withhold the informa∣tion and advice they have solicited, and which is so ne∣cessary to their successful endeavours to serve their fel∣low citizens.</P>
<P>If this information is just, they presume it must be founded on a mistaken opinion, that it was the inten∣tion of the Committee indelicately to interfere with the attending physician in the examination or management of his patient—a conduct which they have studiously avoided, and of which they believe no instance can be produced, where the attending physician himself has given them the necessary information: but where this information has been withheld, and they have received from other quarters, well attested accounts of a dan∣gerous case, as the only means of information in their power, they have been constrained to send and make the necessary enquiry, that they might at least save their fellow citizens from the danger which in such cases would attend a procrastinated funeral, and the neglect of proper precaution respecting the bedding, cloathing and chambers of the sick, and this explana∣tion, will, they make no doubt, with any candid man, acquit them of the charge of inattention or disrespect. But if the information they have received is founded rather in the peculiar sensibility of individuals, than in the impression their conduct has made on the minds of medical gentlemen in general, then it exposes the pro∣fession to the unmerited censure of having suffered too punctillious an attention to etiqutte to have interfered with an important and essential duty.</P>
<P>At any rate, however, it is now, as it ever has been,
<PB N="29" REF="028538_0027_0FD9383EC513D9B8"/>
the unanimous wish of the Committee, cordially to unite with the medical gentlemen in their endeavours to a∣vert or lessen the misfortunes with which this city is threatened, and to avail themselves of their united counsel and information; they therefore have directed me to address to you this letter, and to request you will communicate it to the society, over which you preside; that no misunderstanding or trifling punctilio may lessen their utility, or in any wise defeat their exertions, in the truly important objects of this institution.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The College of Physicians of New-York, respectful∣ly acknowledge the receipt of your letter, by order of the Committee; and it is, "with some astonishment, as well as sincere regret," that they find an implicati∣on of censure in the said letter, on "many if not most of the medical characters in this city," in your suppo∣sing they had formed a resolution to withhold any ne∣cessary information and advice from the Committee, and which might have been necessary for your "suc∣cessful endeavours to serve their fellow citizens."</P>
<P>Whether the suggestion, so injurious to the practiti∣oners of this city has arisen from the illiberal insinuati∣ons of the Dean of the Faculty of Physic of New-York, is a subject they deem highly worthy of the enquiry of the Committee, as it must have been obvious that some of the measures recommended by the said Dean, were calculated to defeat the important objects for which you were instituted, as they must inevitably operate to the great injury of the unfortunate patients to be removed, the distress and affliction of his friends, and unfounded
<PB N="30" REF="028538_0028_0FD93840C24FC818"/>
alarm of the public, and an infraction of the laws of hospitality, and the social compact, without drawing the attention of the citizens to the real sources of dan∣ger.</P>
<P>How far this implication may have been applicable to some medical characters in this city, is not for them to investigate; but they conceive it a duty they owe to themselves and to the public, to assure you, that no such dispositions are to be found in their body; on the contrary, they have individually, after the receipt of your first letter, communicated all the information, as well as all the cases of a dangerous nature, to the Com∣mittee, which they judged necessary and proper for them to know, in order for your making the most pro∣per arrangements for the preservation of the public health, and the alleviation of the misfortunes of those of the poor, or others who might suffer dangerous sickness.</P>
<P>They sincerely hope that such enquiries as the Com∣mittee may deem expedient to be made, will on all fu∣ture occasions be conducted with such candor, deco∣rum, and unequivocal information, as may not be inju∣rious to the patient, disrespectful to the physician, or lead to any unjustifiable alarm of the public mind, at the same time preserve the dignity of the Committee.</P>
<P>They are happy, on all occasions, to avoid all those quarrels and disputes which have so long disgraeed the Faculty of Physic of New York, and therefore it is deemed highly inexpedient to enter into any theoreti∣cal account of the present sickness. But from all the facts that have occurred under their observation, they are not yet convinced that there is any thing essentially different in the disease, now exciting such general alarm, from what has been commonly observable at this sea∣son of the year.</P>
<P>They believe, and are compelled to observe, that the measures recommended by the said Dean, relative to the arrangements of Belle Vue hospital, the visitation
<PB N="31" REF="028538_0029_0FD93844C3C1C6D8"/>
of the unfortunate patients, the interment of the dead, and several other particulars are of such a nature, as are highly interesting to the reputation of this city; and it now becomes a serious question, whether it would not be wise and prudent in the Committee to adopt new and more salutary measures.</P>
<P>They cannot but hold in abhorrence every attempt at dictatorial usurpation; that there is not a member of their body who has not been regularly licensed as the law directs, and they flatter themselves that they are duly sensible of the sacred nature of those obligations, which ought to govern their conduct as practitioners; and at the same time they feel it an important and es∣sential duty to countenance every man or body of men, labouring for the public good.</P>
<P>They also find it necessary further to remark, that there are no points of "etiquette," as you are pleased to term them, which have ever been suffered to inter∣fere "with an important and essential duty."</P>
<P>They most sincerely wish, "that no misunderstand∣ing or trifling punctillio," may lessen the public utility of either institution, by obstructing the channel of truth, but at the same time they think proper to suggest the propriety there would be in recommending to the medical department, annexed to your body, a more cautious expression of language on the nature of the supposed prevailing epidemic; by these means the alarm will not be increased from the source of ostensible au∣thority.</P>
<P>They also assure the Committee of their readiness on all occasions, cordially and unanimously to unite with the Committee of Health, in their endeavours to avert or lessen the misfortunes with which this city may at any time be threatened, by epidemics or other dan∣gerous diseases.</P>
<P>I am, therefore, directed to address to you this let∣ter, and to request you to communicate it to the Com∣mittee, in which you have the honor to preside, and re∣quest
<PB N="32" REF="028538_0030_0FD93847C96D3928"/>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your Excellency's proclamation of the 31st of last month, prohibiting all intercourse between this city and Philadelphia, induced me to write the following letters to the President of the Medical Society in this city.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>New York, <DATE>4th Sept. 1795.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By a proclamation of the governor of Pennsylvania, dated the 31st day of last month, all intercourse be∣tween this city and Philadelphia is prohibited for the term of one month, or until that prohibition shall be revoked.</P>
<P>The reason assigned for this prohibition is thus ex∣pressed in the proclamation—Whereas the Board of
<PB N="34" REF="028538_0032_0FD9385091385B10"/>
Inspectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia, have reported to me, that it appears from authentic informa∣tion to them exhibited, that an infectious or contagi∣ous disease exists in the city of New York, in the State of New York, and that there is reason to believe that a similar disease exists in the town of Norfolk, in the State of Virginia, so that the safety and health of the citizens of Pennsylvania require a stoppage of inter∣course with the said infected places, Therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This proclamation, by exciting alarms and appre∣hensions throughout this and the neighbouring states, and in foreign countries, naturally tends to produce embarrassments to the commerce of this city; and to interrupt that intercourse with the country which is at all times necessary to the convenience and interests of both. Hence it becomes important to examine and ascertain with precision, whether any and what degree of credit is due to the information alluded to in the abovementioned report of the inspectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia. No infectious or contagious disease can exist and prevail in this city, without the knowledge of the gentlemen who practice physic in it; and as the greater part of them are members of the Medical Society over which you preside, I request the favour of you to summon a meeting of the society, and to lay before them this letter.</P>
<P>They will oblige me by reporting to me an accurate statement of such facts and observations as may in their opinion be necessary to the forming a right judgment relative to the existence, nature, and extent of the dis∣ease in question.</P>
<P>If such a disease does really exist and prevail here, it should candidly be admitted and made known, that the dangers resulting from it may be guarded against. If, on the contrary, the reports concerning it are ill founded, care should be taken to prevent their continu∣ing to gain credit.</P>
<P>Although the truth of the frequent reports made and
<PB N="35" REF="028538_0033_0FD9385180CA4D10"/>
published by the Health Committee has not been im∣peached, yet as the before mentioned proclamation appears to be grounded on information more alarming than what those reports afford, I think it advisable to enquire whether it is warranted by any facts within the knowledge of the members of your society.</P>

<P>About six weeks ago, in a particular part of the ci∣ty, being very low, and having an eastern exposure, a fever has been observed to exist, marked by the vio∣lence of those symptoms which are acknowledged to characterise those of the malignant sort. This fever, in a short time, attacked a considerable number of per∣sons, in proportion to the space which it occupied, and proved fatal to more than is usual with us, and which (previous to the salutary and heavy rains we have late∣ly had, and the consequent cloudy and cool weather) assumed an aspect which called for, and justified every prudent exertion that could be made to investigate its origin, and check its progress.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, however, the sensibility of the pub∣lic mind, on a subject of this nature, giving reality to apprehension, converted the necessary efforts for securi∣ty and prevention into sources of fear and terror. Hence probably have arisen most of the exaggerated reports which at first alarmed our own citizens, and
<PB N="36" REF="028538_0034_0FD9385207E3CA68"/>
being sent abroad, have excited the apprehensions of our neighbours, and given origin to measures more timid as they respect themselves, and more injurious to us, than the nature of the case in any wise justified.</P>
<P>The collective opinion of this society, as the result of attentive observation is—With regard to the conta∣gious nature of this disease, most of the members are of opinion that it is not contagious, and all agree that it is so little so, as to afford no apprehension of its being communicated from man to man, out of the sphere of its original and local atmosphere.</P>
<P>As to its origin, suspicions have been entertained by a few physicians, that it may have been imported, whilst at the same time there are many among us who consider it as little more than that species of fever which has more or less prevailed in this city at the same season, for several years past, rendered, by the extraordinary heat, and some local sources of malignity, more violent and fatal than usual.</P>
<P>If the Board of Inspectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia have received any information respecting the disease in question, other than that from the Health Committee of this city, which they deemed <HI>authentic,</HI> we are extremely sorry that they should have been in∣fluenced by it, from a persuasion that such information was equally unfounded as unauthorised.</P>
<P>We assure your excellency that we have no disposi∣tion to disguise or conceal facts, nor do we hesitate to declare our opinion, that the alarm which has gone a∣broad, has been unreasonably great, and quite dispro∣portionate to the actual state of the disease, which, as we have already observed, has been confined to a very inconsiderable portion of the city. It affords us great pleasure to be able to inform your excellency, that this complaint is fast diminishing, and that the general health of our city has been throughout the summer, and continues at this moment, unusually good.</P>

<P>The Committee of Health in this city was appoint∣ed for the express purpose of guarding against the in∣troduction and progress of infections distempers, and they have manifested great vigilance and attention to the discharge of their duty.

<P>The alarming and exaggerated reports in circulation, that a dangerous and infectious distemper prevails in this city, will be corroborated by the proclamation of the governor of Pennsylvania; prohibiting all intercourse between us and Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I think it prudent to obtain from you and others, and transmit to the governor of that state, authentic and conclusive information relative to the question whe∣ther any such distemper does exist and prevail here.</P>
<P>The reports which you have from time to time pub∣lished, are for the most part concise and summary; and it is not necessary that they should in common be other∣wise. On the present occasion it may be useful to re∣port to me a more particular and circumstantial state∣ment.</P>

<P>I took the earliest opportunity to lay your letter of the 6th inst. before the Health Committee, when they made immediate arrangements to comply with your ex∣cellency's wishes. This you will find contained in the enclosed report, which after mature deliberation was adopted by the Committee; it is as particular and cir∣cumstantial a statement as they have it in their power to make, and which, I believe, is very near a real state of facts.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In answer to your excellency's letter of the 6th inst. requiring from us a particular and circumstantial state∣ment of such facts, relative to the disease which has lately made its appearance in this city, or have come to our knowledge. We beg leave to submit the following.</P>
<P>On the 20th day of July, Dr. Malachi Treat, the late health officer of this port, visited the brig Ze∣phyr from Port-au-Prince, on board of which he found three persons ill of fever, and the corpse of one that di∣ed that morning. The Doctor calls the fever in his report a billious remitting fever. The brig was order∣ed to ride quarantine. On the 22d day of July. Doc∣tor Treat was taken ill, and died on the 30th of a fever marked by a yellow skin, hemorrhages, vomiting of a black matter, resembling coffee grounds, and all such symptoms as characterise billious fevers of the malignant kind. On the 25th day of July, four persons from on board the ship William from Liverpool, which arrived here several weeks before (all the crew having, previ∣ous to that day, and during the voyage, been perfectly healthy) were taken ill of fever, attended with similar symptoms, and all died within seven days.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="028538_0037_0FD9385CE5EC57F0"/>
The ship lay at a wharf at the foot of Dover street, in the south easterly part of this city, which lies ex∣ceedingly low, is much of it made ground, has an eastern exposure, and (from the streets having been raised about three years ago, which threw the yards and lots into hollows of considerable depth) is almost unavoidably liable to great collections of offal and filth of all kinds; is a part of the town very much crouded by poor in∣habitants, and contains a great number of lodging houses in which seamen and strangers of the poorer class com∣monly reside: and from all these causes, is unques∣tionably the most unhealthy part of this city; and ever has suffered most from the regular autumnal diseases as well as from any new and uncommon complaint. From all which circumstances, we entertain no doubt, but that the seaman of the ship William contracted the disease of which they died here, and did not introduce it into this city. A little before, and immediately after the attack of the seamen of the ship William, which first called the attention of this Committee, several o∣ther persons in Water and Front streets, and in the neighbourhood of Dover street, were seized with fe∣ver, which especially in those cases which proved mor∣tal, was marked by severe vomitings, a yellow skin, hemorrhages, and in some cases a vomiting black mat∣ter resembling coffee grounds, and which generallly ter∣minated within seven days; and proved fatal to more in proportion to the number seized, than is usual in the ordinary complaints of this season, in this city.</P>
<P>From that time the disease continued to spread in that neighbourhood, extending itself to a few houses lower down towards Peck's slip, to one or two in Pearl street and Cherry street, but principally upwards, to∣wards the ship yards; the number of deaths increasing slowly until the 9th of August, from which, to the 11th inclusive, thirteen died; from that day the num∣ber of deaths reported to us have gradually decreased, so that nine only are reported to have died within the
<PB N="40" REF="028538_0038_0FD938604C56B100"/>
last five days; and in all, from the 30th of July to this day, eighty-nine deaths have been reported to this Committee: forty-four persons in all have been sent to Belle Vue Hospital, of which the greatest number have been seamen and strangers, who have arrived in this city, sick of various complaints, and of this number, several in the very last stages of their disease; twenty have died; sixteen have been discharged cured, and eight remains in the house, most of them convalescent.</P>
<P>The number of deaths includes all the cases which to our knowledge have happened between the 26th of July and the 7th of September inclusive, either in this city, at the New York hospital, or at the hospital at Belle Vue, arising from fever in the least approaching to the character of this disease.</P>
<P>And as this Committee have made every exertion in their power to obtain the necessary information, they do not hesitate to say, that this statement is sufficiently correct to afford the basis of every public measure, which may be thought necessary for our own safety, or for the security of our neighbours.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The suspension of all intercourse between this city and Philadelphia is inconvenient to them, as well as injuri∣ous to us. The information which induced their Health Office to apply to their governor for this suspension, was doubtless such as in their opinion justified that mea∣sure. There nevertheless is reason to believe that more credit was inadvertently given to it, than it deserved.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="028538_0039_0FD9386442A1A520"/>
Whether a contagious disease does exist and prevail in this city, is a question to which a satisfactory an∣swer can only be formed from correct statements of well authenticated facts, and the opinions of men well in∣formed and meriting confidence.</P>
<P>On the present occasion, I think it adviseable to ob∣tain such statements and opinions, and to transmit them to the governor of Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>If it should appear from them that the usual inter∣course between this city and Philadelphia may be re∣stored without any danger to the latter, the prohibi∣tion which suspends it, will of course be revoked.</P>
<P>I have requested and received from the Medical So∣ciety in this city their report on this subject, and when to this is added the late publication of the Medical gen∣tlemen who compose the society called the College of Physicians, the sentiments of the faculty relative to it will be ascertained.</P>
<P>As the Common Council of the city is composed of magistrates and other members from the different wards and as a dangerous infectious distemper cannot be pre∣sumed to prevail here, without exciting their notice and attention; I request from them a statement of such in∣formation as they may possess, together with their opi∣nion relative to this interesting subject.</P>
<P>These documents, with the report of the Health Committee, will afford to the governor of Pennsylvania the best and most authentic evidence that the nature of the case will admit of; and such as cannot fail to reduce the many exaggerated reports that are in circulation, to the standard of truth.</P>

<P>On the receipt of your excellency's letter of the 9th inst. I referred the statement, which it contains to the consideration of the Board of inspectors and the Board of Physicians, appointed by law, to prevent the intro∣duction of infectious diseases into this commonwealth; and I have now the honor to inclose copies of my letter and their report for your information.</P>
<P>It is a source of sincere regret to every citizen of Phi∣ladelphia, that the recent intelligence from New York renders the existence of a contagious disease in that ci∣ty no longer a matter of doubt or apprehension. We are confident, therefore, that while we cherish every sentiment of a just and liberal sympathy, the citizens of New York cannot disapprove our using those pre∣cautions, which are necessary to prevent the extension of so great a calmity. It could certainly be no allevia∣tion of their sufferings, that the inhabitants of Phila∣delphia should be exposed to the same affliction; and your excellency will readily allow, that every embar∣rassment, as well foreign as domestic, that may be the effect of a suspension of the intercourse between the two cities, will operate equally against both. This con∣sideration of interest as well as every motive of duty, jus∣tice and humanity, will prompt me to seize the earliest mo∣ment, in which the prohibition contained in my proclama∣tion may be safely revoked; and I shall esteem any informa∣tion that your excellency may be pleased from time to time

<OPENER><DATELINE>Health Office, Philadelphia, <DATE>Sep. 16th, 1795.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In our communication to your excellency of the 4th inst. we had the honor to inform you, that the inspectors of the Health Office proposed a further joint meeting with the Board of consulting physicians, on the Wednesday following; We accordingly met this day; the result of our consultations we have now to detail to your excel∣lency. And first we shall notice the following pas∣sage in your letter. "That governor Jay may be ap∣prised of the facts on which your opinions and reports have been founded, you will be pleased to furnish me with a particular statement, to accompany my answer to his letter."</P>
<P>Previously to our advising the intercourse between the two cities to be stopped, we have received informa∣tion by a number of oral and written testimonies, that a dangerous and malignant fever existed in the city of New York. It will hardly be expected we should mention the names of those persons from whom we re∣ceived information, either verbal or written; to give up the names of those we conversed with on the sub∣ject could answer no good purpose: and in respect to
<PB N="46" REF="028538_0044_0FD93871271BCF70"/>
mentioning the writers of letters, or extracts of letters, from whom we derived a considerable share of information, would we conceive be an useless as well as unpardonable breach of confidence. Suffice it to say, the informa∣tion was such as on which we conceived we could safely depend, and in this body of evidence it may not be amiss to mention it comprised the reports of the Health Committee of New York, and letters from their port physician.</P>
<P>These united testimonies tended to establish that the late Health Officer of the port, Dr. Treat, who con∣fessedly resided in a healthy part of the city, on the 20th of July visited the brig Zephyr, just arrived from Port an Prince, on board of whom was the corpse of a man who had died that day, as also three persons sick of a fever, all three of whom died in a few days after; that Dr. Treat was taken ill about the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and died on or about the 30th of the same month, of a fever; the symptoms of which was of the most malignant kind, and such as is characteristic of what is commonly called the yellow fever; that shortly after the part of the crew of the ship William from Liverpool were taken with a fever apparently of the same nature, and all died (in a statement since made by the Health Committee of New York and communicated to your excellency by governor Jay, we have to lament the omission of a most material circumstance; it is whether or not the brig Zephyr had any communication with the William; they only tell us she was ordered to perform quaran∣tine) our private information goes to shew that there actually was a communication between those vessels; if this information is well founded, the contagion may be readily traced from the Zephyr to the William.</P>
<P>From about this time a fever of the same nature with that of which Doctor Treat and part of the crews of these vessels died, was observed to break out in a par∣ticular district of that city, confined within a small space and continuing to increase insomuch that in the course
<PB N="47" REF="028538_0045_0FD938750BE63FD8"/>
of the month of August we are told about eighty per∣sons (some augment this number greatly) died of the same kind of fever within that district only: if this statement may be depended on, and we think it corro∣borated by the documents transmitted by governor Jay, we have no hesitation in saying, that the citizens of Phi∣ladelphia had cause for serious alarm, for it is much doubted if a greater number died in Philadelphia du∣ring the same month, of the disorder which prevailed in, and afterwards proved so calamitous to our city, du∣ring the summer and autumn of 1793.</P>
<P>In both cities the disorder appears to have broke out about the same time of the year, and is remarkable for a similarity of progress, except that in the present month it has as yet less spread over the city of New York than it did with us: but may not this be ascribed to the plentifully rains, a cool and favorable state of the at∣mosphere and other natural causes which have prevail∣ed this season in a remarkable degree (the reverse of which was the case in the summer of 1793) than to a less degree of malignancy in the disorder: besides if the constitutions and habits of the citizens of New-York are indisposed to imbibe the infection, are we sure the Philadelphians are not predisposed to take it, and would it become us as guardians of the city's health to try the experiment for the sake of conviction: rather would it not be more prudent to make use of every reasonable means the most likely to avert an impending calamity; the answer is obvious.</P>
<P>It is of small moment to the point in question, whe∣ther the disorder was imported, or originated in the ci∣ty from local causes; it is sufficient to prove it contagi∣ous; and that it is so under certain situations and cir∣cumstances few will deny, who attentively consider the foregoing statement. Dr. Treat received the conta∣gion from visiting the brig Zephyr, and the crew of the William received it from the same vessel, from whence it was imbibed by the citizens of New York,
<PB N="48" REF="028538_0046_0FD93876CBEF8AC0"/>
more immediately contiguous to its original sources of contagion, and predisposed to take the infection.</P>
<P>From the above statement we think it will be readily admitted that the disorder now prevalent in the city of New York, is of the same nature with that which pre∣vailed in Philadelphia in the year 1793, and that in certain situations and circumstances it is also contagious: if these facts are admitted, we think they will suffici∣ently justify the measures we recommended.</P>
<P>Thus we have given to your excellency the principal facts, on which were founded our opinions and reports, and our reasons for their justification.</P>
<P>In respect to the Proclamation prohibiting the in∣tercourse between the two cities, we have to inform you that it was the unanimous opinion of the joint Boards, that there does not now appear any reason for revoking the said Proclamation; on the contrary, con∣sidering the prevailing hot weather, and the recent ad∣vices from New York, it was our unanimous opinion, that the Proclamation should not only be continued; but that it ought to be strictly carried into effect.</P>

You may be assured, Sir, your benevolences will be faithfully applied, and will excite in your favour the repeated prayers and blessings of many a mourning fa∣ther, disconsolate widow and helpless orphan.</P>
<P>I sincerely lament that at so early a period after a calamitous and distressing pestilence had in some mea∣sure desolated the city of Philadelphia, and excited to∣wards her, in her afflicted state, the tear of sympathy and the hand of benevolence of her neighbours, the Almighty Ruler of heaven and earth should have found too just cause to remind us, that we also are beings de∣pendent on his sovereign will, and that we have not re∣quited him with gratitude for the many very signal bles∣sings and unparalleled prosperity we have enjoyed since the late revolution, and our return to our dwellings; and by this distressing visitation, to impress on our minds, that under him human beings are dependent on each other, by making us in turn the objects of the commise∣ration and benevolence of our sympathising neighbours.</P>
<P>I fervently hope and wish that you, sir, and your re∣spected fellow citizens, may never again witness such distressing scenes as you have lately experienced; and that the affliction which has now come to the doors of my fellow citizens, may be sanctified to the survivors, and teach us, that unless supported by the Divine Hand the things of this life, which we so highly prize, are very vanity, and life itself a mere vapour.</P>
<P>We were very sanguine in our expectations, about 4 weeks ago, considering the then general state of health in this city, beyond all former seasons, that the epidemic which was then confined to a small district of the city, and which since has caused so much alarm and distress, and deprived us of some valuable citizens, would have been confined there and finally subsided; but the warm weather and fears of many, and want of caution in
<PB N="52" REF="028538_0050_0FD93880C4156130"/>
others, has caused it to spread from that quarter some∣what northward and principally eastward to the ship yards, where it has been most fatal among the poor emi∣grants, who lived and died in filth and dirt; and altho' the cool air of the close of Sept. had much diminish∣ed the mortality, and had given us reason to hope that the judgment would be speedily removed, it has again, by the uncommonly warm weather, or perhaps unknown causes, become very alarming, and has taken off a few individuals, I suppose, not exceeding 30 or 40 in the whole, south-west of the Fly market and Crown street, and west of Broad street, continued into the Bowery, exclusive of the Hospital.</P>
<P>The number of deaths has however, again decreased from 29 on Sunday evening, to 22 on Monday, and 17 on this evening (the whole number now being 525) and we have reason to hope and expect, from the small number of new cases which have come to the know∣ledge of the Health Committee on the last evening, that, with the blessing of heaven, the disease will soon subside, and permit our affrighted fugitive fellow citi∣zens, who are scattered in every quarter around us, to return to their dwellings in safety, and again open the intercourse between us, and our more happy neigh∣bours; the want of which has in a very great degree enhanced our misfortunes.</P>
<P>Accept our unfeigned thanks, Sir, for the interesting and friendly part you have taken in our days of calami∣ty and distress; and believe me to be with sentiments of great personal respect and esteem,</P>

<P>But three persons have died on the last four days in this city, and but three at Belle Vue since the 27th of October, of fever in any degree resembling our late epidemic.</P>
<P>The alarming situation in which this city has lately been, is calculated to excite the most serious reflections—to inspire feelings of veneration for that all control∣ing Power who in the midst of such judgment numbers mercy!—We trust that it has been under a sentiment of grateful dependance on him, that we have been en∣couraged to fulfil the duties you had entrusted: And we trust that while congratulations are repeated upon returning seasons of health, all hearts may be disposed to improve to moral and virtuous purposes both the threatening and felicitating dispensations of heaven. Your Committee at this period cheerfully recognise those principles of undeviating veracity, which during
<PB N="54" REF="028538_0052_0FD9388908ACAC30"/>
the increasing terror of their fellow citizens, directed their daily reports respecting the progress of disease. It is with great satisfaction that they have found it evinced by their experience, that such exact details as they have made to the public, instead of increasing those terrors, have tended, in a great measure, to subdue them; and the accomplishment of this is of immense importance to public happiness and convenience; fear mitigates its objects. During the existence of a cala∣mity of this kind, circumstances will be ever exagge∣rated, by the timidity and credulity of individuals.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, however, that falsehoods have been propagated from the basest, meanest, and the most despicable motives; by some as an apolo∣gy for their panic apprehensious, by others, from the sensibilities of self interest, and to gratify a sordid lust of gain. Lies have been propagated for the sake of the wonderful, and the excitement of surprize, by per∣sons ungenerously forgetful of the extensive mischiefs naturally originating from this source—despair, deser∣tion, poverty, famine and death!</P>
<P>Perhaps an ill-judged tenderness for their reputati∣ons has prevented the publication of the names of some offenders. Had the falsehood repeated with great confidence in the country had any proper foundation, our city would long since have been nearly desolated.</P>
<P>We turn with pleasure to the recollection of circum∣stances more creditable to hmanity; and to acknow∣ledge the liberality of those of our fellow citizens who have contributed to alleviate the distresses of the sick and suffering poor. The generous inteferences of sympa∣thy from Philadelphia, and some neighboring villages, demand our lasting gratitude: Such instances of mutual good will and beneficence remain grateful memorials of the fraternity of a free and virtuous people.</P>
<P>From these resources, 8837 dols. have been received; and your Committee feel a responsibility in the faith∣ful and just distribution. Its proper objects being nu∣merous,
<PB N="55" REF="028538_0053_0FD9388B0746CB00"/>
and often probably not within the sphere of individual knowledge, each of the members of the Com∣mittee is associated with two respectable citizens in seeking out the sick, and relieving those to whom their charity is directed.</P>
<P>Circumstances have not been wanting to shew the happy influence of temperance, cleanliness, and cold upon the late epidemic. But while we rejoice that benevolent nature has given power to these agents to set bounds to its ravages, let us recollect that they are assiduously to be employed. We feel it incumbent on us to remind our fellow citizens of this truth, particu∣larly those who are returning from the country. Houses which have contained the sick, should be carefully ventulated; and things that have been employed by them, that cannot conveniently be cleansed by water, should be subjected freely to the action of cold.</P>
<P>It is not impossible that neglect in those particulars may occasion a few solitary instances of this disease un∣til we have experienced intense frost. For though we flatter ourselves it is extinguished as an epidemic, and our streets free from all infection, we have before us the experience of other places to impress the necessity of such precautions.</P>
<P>Among the arrangements made by the Committee to prevent the spread of infectious disease they consider early interments and the use of the hearse, as one of the most important. Satisfactory proofs of its utility might be detailed. It is to be wished that the good sense of the community might be exerted to conquer any prejudice which may remain in opposition to a prac∣tice of burial so much more convenient than the com∣mon mode, and so much more safe.</P>
<P>The present state of Belle Vue hospital is pleasing; not only from it we anticipate the speedy extinction of all disease therein, but from the happy and comfortable situation of the sick, and from the satisfaction expressed by them with respect to their medical aid and attend∣ance.
<PB N="56" REF="028538_0054_0FD9388C3620CBD8"/>
But three new patients have been received dur∣ing the last ten days. There are now thirteen sick in the hospital, twelve of whom are considered as out of all danger. Since its first establishment, eighty nine persons have been discharged, cured; the deaths have been published with our daily reports.</P>
<P>It is with great satisfaction that we remark that al∣though some of the people have been slightly affected with the epidemic no one has died.</P>
<P>Much to the injury of the unfortunate persons who have been sent to this place, its circumstances have been grossly misrepresented. The sick have in conse∣quence, in numerous instances, sought this asylum with hearts aching with anxiety and despair.</P>
<P>A senior consulting physician was early appointed to visit it occasionally from this city. From its first esta∣blishment, one, and since the 24th of Sept. two, phy∣sicians have constantly resided within its walls. A new building has been erected during the sickness, and no expense has been spared to render the sick commodious and happy. A Committee from this Board have made frequent visits and examination of its circumstances, and from time to time have witnessed with pleasure its improving state.</P>
<P>A more vigilant, humane, or attentive man was ne∣ver appointed purveyor to an hospital, than our late worthy member Mr. Frederick Steymets, whose death reminds us of the loss of our other friend and associate, Dr. M. Treat, who there is reason to suspect, was also a victim to the discharge of faithful duty. The public will join with us in deploring the loss of such worthy and respectable members of society.</P>
<P>Before we dismiss the subject of the hospital, it is but just that we acknowledge our sense of the merit of Dr. Alexander Anderson, and Dr. M'Farlin, resident physicians at Belle Vue.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The former of these gentlemen engaged with zeal and virtue, at early period and under discouraging circumstances, in their ardu∣ous duty.</NOTE> Both for their persevering

attention, humanity and fidelity to the sick, they have deserved well of their country.</P>
<P>The Committee being employed in arranging expen∣ditures, and in the settlements of accounts, request that all persons having demands upon them, present the same to alderman Furman, 106, Broad Way, on or before the 20th instant.</P>
