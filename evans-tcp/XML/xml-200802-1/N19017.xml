</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the first parents of mankind had violated the covenant of their God, all their pleasing prospects were destroyed. Futu∣rity, to them, was wrapt in impenetrable darkness. Conscious guilt and terrifying expectations filled their minds, while they waited, nor waited long, the awful decision of their offended Sovereign.</P>
<P>IT is not rational to suppose, that they could even conjecture any scheme, which promised the least hope of escape from the threatened punishment
<PB REF="024747_0004_0FC86845874E1248"/>
to disobedience. Confused with guilt, shame and terror, they attempted, but in vain, <HI>to hide from the presence of the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii.8.</NOTE></P>
<P>HITHERTO divine goodness reigned toward man. Divine mercy, now needed, began to dawn, and thenceforth shown brighter and brighter <HI>to the perfect day</HI> of revealed truth. <HI>Then</HI> came gospel grace to the condemned, through a Redeemer. Then was <HI>first</HI> made known the promisory declara∣tion of the eternal God, that <HI>the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF upon the lapse of man, the Almighty had have forthwith deprived the transgressors of the light of life, and there have ended for ever the hu∣man race, it would have been perfectly just. But mercy suspended justice; in the display of which, God said to man, Live, <HI>I have found a ransom.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiii.24. comp. 1 Tim. ii.9,</NOTE> While the angel of justice guarded <HI>the tree of life,</HI> by which man's life was to have been perpetuated, the angel of mercy, if I may so speak, pointed to ano∣ther and better <HI>tree of life,</HI> even Jesus Christ, who, for man, <HI>hath brought life and immortality to light.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i.10.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN this glorious scheme of redemption, all the perfections of Deity harmonize. It continues the human race, which without it must have been ex∣tinct, puts man into a salvable state, under a new covenant of grace; according to which, sin is de∣servedly punished, and God can <HI>be just, and the justifier of the sinner which believeth in Jesus.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii.26.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024747_0005_0FC86847C18177B0"/>THIS admirable plan of grace and salvation to man, was gradually opened from the first promise to <HI>the fulness of time.</HI> Then Jesus Christ, <HI>the Sun of Righteousness,</HI> the light and life of the world, a∣rose with divine splendor, and mightily dispelled the clouds of ignorance, error and uncertainty which darkened the moral world. In <HI>this</HI> plan, as revealed in the scriptures, is contained the will of God to man. According to this, we are to learn what God is, and what we should be. To know and conform to the will of God thus made known, is the first duty and highest happiness of man. It is his proper study, and should be his supreme concern.</P>
<P>LET it be our endeavour, my hearers, to search the will of God to men, not only in those things which <HI>have been,</HI> and <HI>now are,</HI> but <HI>those</HI> also which <HI>shall be</HI> made plain by accomplishment. Not indeed with vain curiosity, nor the presumptuous thought of <HI>searching out the Almighty to perfection,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xi.7.</NOTE> but, that we may see more reason, and be more excited to believe and obey, to adore and praise with increased fervency and firmness.</P>
<P>WITH such views, let us attend to the will of God expressed in our text. It is a prophetic dis∣course of Isaiah respecting the purity, enlargement and glory of the church of God. In the whole chapter, the prophet evidently looks forward to gospel times, and seems in one passage, to extend
<PB N="8" REF="024747_0006_0FC8684AEFDD9DC8"/>
his views to the permanent blessedness of the church triumphant. He begins the chapter with great animation. <HI>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.</HI> Many more blessings of a similar nature are promised, and the chapter is closed with the words of the text. THY PEOPLE ALSO SHALL BE ALL RIGHTEOUS, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE prophet addresses himself to the Church, or Zion. THY PEOPLE SHALL BE ALL RIGHTEOUS, therefore, may intend, that all the professing peo∣ple of God shall be internally and personally righteous; that <HI>every one that nameth the name of Christ shall depart from iniquity.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii.19.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE expression may extend in its meaning, to the conversion of the Gentiles from dumb idols to the living God, and the spread of christianity through the world▪ The former is the most probable. In either construction, the increase and prosperity of the church are intended. This is to our present purpose.</P>
<P>THE people thus <HI>righteous</HI> SHALL INHERIT THE LAND FOR EVER. This may teach us, that the church and all good people are the peculiar choice and care
<PB N="9" REF="024747_0007_0FC8684D492650D0" MS="y"/>
of God, and shall be preserved. For <HI>them</HI> more es∣pecially, the earth is upheld, and made fruitful. For <HI>them,</HI> civil governments are instituted and changed, the nations controled, and the world continued. They shall possess, and <HI>eat the good of the land.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. i.19.</NOTE> <HI>All things are theirs.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii.21.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE BRANCH OF MY PLANTING, THE WORK OF MY HANDS, are expressions which evidently, in this place, intend, and apply to the church. Elsewhere, THE BRANCH signifies the same.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. iv.2.</NOTE> In other passages of scripture it has a different meaning. Jesus Christ is frequently intended.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isa. xi.1. Jer. xxxiii.15. Zac. iii.8.</NOTE> So by THE WORK OF GOD'S HANDS, we are sometimes to understand his works of creation and providence. But the church, in∣cluding religion, is emphatically THE WORK of God. Hence the prophet prays, <HI>Lord, revive thy work.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hab. iii.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Lord will prosper the church, THAT HE MAY BE GLORIFIED. In and by the church, God is <HI>actively</HI> GLORIFIED. But his care and love mani∣fested toward her, and by all his works of mercy, of justice, and of judgment among the nations, he is, and he will be <HI>objectively</HI> GLORIFIED. The divine conduct towards the church, from first to last, is, and will be vastly more for the glory of God, than all his other works and ways respecting the children of men.</P>
<P>A LITTLE ONE SHALL BECOME A THOUSAND, AND A SMALL ONE A STRONG NATION, point us to the
<PB N="10" REF="024747_0008_0FC8684EC317DAD8"/>
vast increase of the church, as to number and influ∣ence from small beginnings. The words may also have respect to the growth of states and empires, under the smiles of Heaven.</P>
<P>I THE LORD WILL HASTEN IT IN HIS TIME. The Almighty will accomplish the prophecies and pro∣mises of his holy word in favor of Zion, and WILL HASTEN IT in the <HI>fittest time;</HI> or in Christ's time, when the triumphs of his cross shall be spread, and <HI>all shall bow the knee to Jesus, and confess that He is Lord to the glory of God the Father.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xlv.23. Phil. ii.10, 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM our text in its connexion, the following comprehensive doctrine naturally arises, viz.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the church hath been small in her beginning, yet the Lord hath encreased her, and will do so more abundantly, even to greatness and glory; and in order to this, he hath, and will cause earthly powers and governments to subserve her interests.</P>
<P>TO confirm and illustrate this doctrine, and pre∣pare the way for some occasional improvement and practical remarks, I shall take a brief view of the <HI>small beginning and progress</HI> of the church and peo∣ple of God; of what the Lord <HI>hath done, is doing, hath promised,</HI> and, therefore, <HI>will perform</HI> IN HIS TIME, in behalf of his <HI>peculiar people.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="024747_0009_0FC868515D08F7D8" MS="y"/>LITTLE needs be said to prove, that the church hath been very small in her beginning, and the cause of religion in the world apparently weak and neglected. From Adam to the flood, through the space of about six hundred years, we find on sacred record, as leading characters, only Abel, Seth, Enoch and Noah. It is probable, however, that the pos∣terity of Seth, who are supposed to be called <HI>the sons of God,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi·2.</NOTE> did maintain, for some time, the wor∣ship of the true God; untill they formed contracts of marriage with <HI>the daughters of men,</HI> who are also supposed to be the descendants of Cain.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stackhouse's Compl. Body of Div. p. 312</NOTE> Be this as it may. There was a general corruption of manners immediately preceeding the flood. <HI>All flesh had corrupted his way.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi.11.</NOTE> The earth was deluged with wickedness before it was with water. <HI>Eight</HI> persons only were saved from the deluge.</P>
<P>IF we trace the visible church for hundreds of years farther, even to the twelve Patriarchs, still we find her very small. In Christ's time, tho' <HI>many were called,</HI> yet <HI>few</HI> were <HI>chosen.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xx.16.</NOTE> Centuries after Christ, error and wickedness prevailed, and <HI>gross darkness covered the people.</HI></P>
<P>SHOULD we pass by all periods and places but those of <HI>our</HI> forefathers, the smallness of the church, and of the people is obvious. A <HI>small</HI> number from Holland, whither they had fled from civil and ecclesiastical oppression and persecution in Eng∣land,
<PB N="12" REF="024747_0010_0FC868528F5E6AF0"/>
landed at Plymouth, December 22d, 1620. That number was soon greatly diminished by mor∣tal sickness. They were A LITTLE, A SMALL ONE. But A LITTLE ONE HATH BECOME A THOUSAND, AND A SMALL ONE A STRONG NATION, both as to the church and the state. THE BRANCH OF GOD's PLANTING hath increased, not only in this, but in other countries; not only in our days, but in other periods of the world. Compare the church in Noah's and Abraham's time, with her state and number when Israel was delivered from Egyptian bondage, and when the chosen nation flourished in Canaan, and the increase appears great.</P>
<P>IN the reign of king Solomon, <HI>things went well in Judah,</HI> and in all Israel. The civil polity of the state, and the religious interests of the church were happy and flourishing. Then was built and con∣secrated for the special presence and public worship of God, the magnificent and vastly expensive tem∣ple. Then the church prospered, and <HI>Mount Zion, beautiful for situation,</HI> was <HI>the joy of the whole earth,</HI> and the temple the admiration of the world.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xlviii.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>AT the time of Christ's advent, religion was in a declined state. By the preaching of John the Bap∣tist, it was revived. Multitudes believed his doc∣trine, and received his baptism: and <HI>all men ac∣counted him a prophet.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiv.5.

felt the power of divine truth, and followed him: insomuch that the chief priests and pharisees said▪ <HI>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xi.43.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the days of the apostles, tho' persecution and death stared christians in the face, yet the church under the effusions of the Holy Spirit, increased by thousands in a day.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts ii.41.</NOTE> Although in succeeding centuries, there was a great declension from pure christianity; heresies were broached; sectaries multiplied; false teachers arose; corrupt and de∣signing men insinuated their specious, but poisonous doctrines among the credulous and ignorant peo∣ple, and superstition, bigotry and error shed their baneful influence far and wide; yet the light of the gospel was not wholly extinguished. From the days of Martin Luther, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and John Calvin and others soon after, religion hath revived. The church, on the whole, hath prospered, notwithstanding all her severe trials, and even bloody persecutions. <HI>Kings have been nursing fathers, and queens nursing mothers to her.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xlix.23.</NOTE></P>
<P>I MUST omit to mention the various success and trouble of the Church in Europe, during several centuries, and only touch upon the progress of re∣ligion, and spread of the gospel in our land.</P>
<P>THE great number of regular churches and the many thousands of people, in the New-Eng∣land states especially, have arisen chiefly from <HI>one
<PB N="14" REF="024747_0012_0FC86859FB4249C0"/>
flock</HI> which first settled at Plymouth. It was <HI>little, poor, defenceless.</HI> Only <HI>one hundred and seventy-one</HI> years since, our ancestors inspired with the love of liberty and religion, relinquished their pleasant, na∣tive soil and cities, and preferred a strange land, a howling wilderness. Their <HI>zeal for God</HI> braved all dangers. Though pressed with innumerable diffi∣culties and hardships, they fainted not. <HI>The Lord was their helper.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii.6.</NOTE> They passed the dangerous atlan∣tic as <HI>with a staff,</HI> like Jacob over Jordan; and now, behold they <HI>are become two bands</HI>; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii.10.</NOTE> yea, a nu∣merous, A STRONG NATION! In a manner which hath fully manifested the hand of God, hath he <HI>driven out the heathen before us.</HI> He hath gotten glory to himself by prospering this BRANCH OF HIS OWN PLANTING.</P>
<P>AT a view of these <HI>great things</HI> which <HI>God hath done for us,</HI> are we not constrained, in a mixture of adoration, wonder and joy, to adopt the words of the Psalmist, <HI>Come and see the works of God!</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">lxvi.5.</NOTE> Let us also join him farther, and say, <HI>O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">ver. 8, 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>AT different times, and in many places, the Lord hath sent down his spirit in the <HI>rain of righteousness,</HI> by which many have been <HI>turned from the error of their ways to the wisdom of the just.</HI> Witnesses for God and the church have been raised up, so that her <HI>cords have been lengthened and her stakes strength∣ened.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isai. liv.2.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="024747_0013_0FC8685E79FED510"/>IN <HI>this</HI> town, we believe, the Lord hath revived his <HI>own work</HI> of grace, at times, and made additi∣ons to his true church. Notwithstanding the char∣ges of enthusiasm and disorder alledged by some, which we pretend not were wholly groundless, we have good reason to believe, that the periods refer∣ed to,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The years 1741, 1742 and 1763. In the first of these years, fifty; in the second, sixty-five; and in the third, fifty persons were added to the church in full com∣munion. From ten to twenty in other years.</NOTE> were days of God's power upon men's hearts, and that many were made willing to receive and obey the Lord Jesus Christ for ever. Some still live witnesses and monuments of the mighty grace of God in those days, whose firmness in faith and holiness of life prove their renovation from a carnal to a spiritual mind.</P>
<P>THUS the church universal and particular hath been increased from small beginnings. She will continue to grow, until HER PEOPLE SHALL BE ALL RIGHTEOUS, AND SHALL INHERIT THE LAND FOR EVER.</P>
<P>WE will now take a general view of what the Lord <HI>hath done</HI> for his church and the cause of religion; by which it will appear, that earthly powers and governments have, and must submit to the church, and promote her interest.</P>
<P>THIS is not argued upon the hypothesis, that civil government, in its nature and tendency, is in∣imical
<PB N="16" REF="024747_0014_0FC868625CA603D0"/>
to the church, and therefore, must be sub∣jected as an enemy; but upon this truth, that <HI>the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwel∣lings of Jacob</HI>: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psa. lxxxvii.2.</NOTE>—that in God's view, the church is far more important and excellent, than the state. Therefore, while good governments and rulers tend and aim to support and advance her interests, all unrighteous principalities and powers shall be over∣ruled, and made subservient to the same cause, even the cause of truth and righteousness, goodness and grace, peace and happiness.</P>
<P>IN the direction now given to our thoughts, an extensive field is opened. It affords ample scope for the pen of the learned and the good, and is highly worthy their attention. In this field, there∣fore, I can take but here and there a step, through deficiency both of time and ability.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be the dispositions of the great men of the earth; whatever the tendency of any particular forms of government; whatever <HI>devices</HI> there may be <HI>in the hearts of men</HI>; yet the Lord hath the hearts of all in his hands, and <HI>his counsel shall stand,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xix.21.</NOTE> to the confusion and ruin of his ene∣mies, and the advancement of religion and his <HI>little flock. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty: he judgeth among the gods.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psa. lxxxii.1.</NOTE> There is no event too high for his control, nor too small for his notice.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="024747_0015_0FC86863BB6231B8"/>AS soon as the spirit of wickedness burst forth in the murder of pious Abel, <HI>the righteous Lord who loveth righteousness</HI> interposed. He espoused the cause of his favourite, fixed a mark of infamy and divine displeasure upon the murderer, and banished him to a foreign country. When <HI>the wickedness of man was great, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi.5.</NOTE> in what an astonishing manner, as to mercy and wrath, did the Almighty manifest himself! The <HI>Ark,</HI> a stu∣pendous work, was prepared for the salvation of the church, and the reception of the creatures which were to preserve their species in the earth, while the whole world of man and beast, and every living thing beside, were destroyed by a flood of waters!</P>
<P>THE antediluvians were, no doubt, immensely numerous. By the computation of some, <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Whiston's and Burnet's Theory.</NOTE>
<Q>the number, in the times near the flood, would easily amount to above 500,000 millions; that is, to a thousand times as many, as our present earth has, in all probability, now upon it; and indeed, to ten times as many, as the earth, in its present constitution, can be supposed capable of main∣taining.</Q>
<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Stakh. comp. body div.</NOTE> And yet, God destroyed those millions in his wrath, and saved alive <HI>eight</HI> persons only who were found righteous!</P>
<P>THE divine procedure toward Abraham, Lot, and the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, is
<PB N="18" REF="024747_0016_0FC86866575E4108"/>
another wonderful instance of God's care for his people, and vengeance to his and their enemies. The disposition of the Lord to shew mercy to men in every consistent way, and his tender respect to the righteous, are fully evinced in his familiar discourse with Abraham, concerning the then has∣tening destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; in the close of which, he affirms, that if there could be found <HI>ten righteous</HI> persons in those cities, he would not destroy them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii.32.</NOTE></P>
<P>ST. Peter speaking of the vindictive justice of God to the wicked, and his mercy to the righte∣ous, says, <HI>He spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in a flood upon the world of the ungodly; and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conver∣sation of the wicked.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. ii.5—9.</NOTE> This proves what he farther says, <HI>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.</HI></P>
<P>ABUNDANTLY did the Lord show favor to Abra∣ham, Isaac and Jacob; more especially to the for∣mer. He conversed with him as a friend, face to face. He condescended to make a covenant with him, and greatly to bless him. In the singular affair of his offering in sacrifice his only son Isaac, by divine command, scarce any thing human ap∣pears. It seems all of God! all divine!</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="024747_0017_0FC8686A9D3D8CC8"/>TO provide for his chosen, and <HI>save much people alive,</HI> the Lord over-ruled the wicked intentions of the brethren of Joseph, in selling him into Egypt. They meant it unto <HI>evil,</HI> and to frustrate his dreams; <HI>but God meant it unto good,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. l.20.</NOTE> and to accomplish them more conspicuously.</P>
<P>GRIEVOUS famine compelled the Patriarchs to visit Egypt. But God being with them, they found it the way to distinguished blessings. Their increase in number and wealth excited the jealousy, and nourished the avarice of the monarch of Egypt. Perhaps, earthly powers were never more assidu∣ously and cruelly exerted to cramp the growth of a people, and yet gain advantage from them, than were those of Pharaoh and his court. And never were attempts more compleatly frustrated. <HI>The more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ex. i.12.</NOTE> In process of time, the despised Hebrews successfully resisted the power, and spoiled the glory of Egypt. The God of heaven was with his people. <HI>His understanding is infinite. He tak∣eth the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong. But he saveth the poor from the hand of the mighty.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job. v.13, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE cruel edict by which all the male children were consigned to a watery grave, in the river Nile, when the tyrant's charge to the midwives proved ineffectual, gave rise to the affecting expedient by which Moses was saved from untimely death, and tenderly nursed by the daughter of the inhuman

Pharaoh.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. i.</NOTE> In this way, Moses was better qualified for the arduous work to which he was afterwards called; and in due time he delivered his people from bondage.</P>
<P>THE Lord turneth the evil machinations of op∣pressors to their own ruin, and causeth them to promote the interest and happiness of those they would destroy. <HI>He exalteth the horn of his people, even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psa. cxlviii.14.</NOTE></P>
<P>CAN any thing be more conspicuous, than the hand of God through all the sufferings and deli∣verances of his chosen people in Egypt, and all their tedious journey from thence to the promised land? Can we read or hear of the miraculous <HI>pillar of cloud by day, and fire by night,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ex. xiii.21▪ 22.</NOTE> to direct the untried way of Israel; of the mighty power of God in divid∣ing the red sea, that his people might pass thro' on dry ground, and his awful wrath in returning the waters to the utter destruction of the Egypti∣ans, and not be disposed religiously to admire, and profoundly to adore?</P>
<P>AT a serious view of these things, can we doubt whether the Lord maketh a difference between the righteous and the wicked? whether he will defend his church, and destroy her enemies? hath not enough been offered to convince us, that earthly powers and governments have been made subservient and submissive to the church; and that those which would not, have been miserably bro∣ken

<P>I WILL pass by <HI>many,</HI> and take notice only of a <HI>few</HI> more important events which strikingly evince the tender care of the Lord for his church, his wrath to her enemies, his abhorrence of sin, and his all-controling influence upon the great men and governments of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="024747_0020_0FC8687070B7E0C8"/>TO punish for abounding iniquity, a holy God, who <HI>will not justify the wicked,</HI> visited his <HI>chosen</HI> nation with desolating judgments. He permitted Nebuchadnezzar, the haughty Chaldean monarch, to lay waste <HI>the holy city and temple,</HI> and to lead captive the people. <HI>But though in wrath he smote, yet in favor he had mercy.</HI> Nebuchadnezzar, hav∣ing made havock in Jerusalem, falls himself <HI>into the hands of the living God.</HI> According to the word of the Lord by Daniel, <HI>he was driven from his throne and from men, had his dwelling with the beasts of the field, was wet with the dew of hea∣ven, 'till his hair was grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. iv.32 — to the end.</NOTE> 'till he acknowledged and submitted to the God of heaven.</P>
<P>BELSHAZZAR, his son, and his successor in the kingdom, while impiously feasting, and profaning the vessels of the house of God, <HI>saw</HI> to his amaze∣ment, a portentous <HI>hand-writing on the wall.</HI> This, Daniel only could interpret.

<P>THE restoration of the Jews from the Baby∣lonish captivity to their own land, and former privileges, is still farther evidential of the divine care for his people. This great event the Lord effected, by <HI>stirring up the spirit of Cyrus, king
<PB N="23" REF="024747_0021_0FC86878FA2BE820"/>
of Persia</HI>; who <HI>made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it in writing. Thus saith Cyrus, the Lord God of heaven hath given me all the king∣doms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

<P>THAT this was all the work of God, must be obvious to every mind, when we turn to the pre∣diction of Isaiah, near two hundred years before the events took place. Speaking of God,—<HI>That saith of Cyrus, he is my Shepherd, and shall perform my pleasure, even saying to Jerusalem, thou shall be built; and to the Temple, thy foundation shall be laid.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. xliv.23.</NOTE> <HI>Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, &amp;c.

No∣thing, scarcely, more than the events above recited, can verify the words of the prophet in our context, which extend to present and future, as well as <HI>now</HI> past nations and periods. Speaking of Zion, or the church, he saith, <HI>And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto

<P>PASSING over in silence many interesting scenes, and marvellous displays of divine perfections, from the rebuilding of the temple, through the times of Christ and his Apostles, the final destruction of Jerusalem and dispersion of the Jewish nation, and centuries after, I request your attention, for a few minutes, to the times, and <HI>the operation of God's hand,</HI> within the compass of our observation.</P>
<P>IS it not manifest, that the ways of God to men in our days, are astonishing, and coincide with his doings in ancient times? Doth he not, in many ways, discover the same favor for the righteous, care for the church, and displeasure toward the wicked oppressors of mankind? Hath he not, <HI>with a mighty hand and a stretched out arm,</HI> judged a∣mong the nations,, humbled the pride of tyrants, wrested from them the instruments of cruelty, and
<PB N="25" REF="024747_0023_0FC8687E04F00DA8"/>
vindicated the rights of the oppressed? In several instances, <HI>a nation hath been born at once,</HI> by poli∣tical regeneration. <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">America, France, Poland.</NOTE> Millions of people in dif∣ferent countries, have been emancipated from the griping hand of despotic government, and by happy constitutions formed with wisdom and de∣liberation, put in possession of glorious liberty. May not all see, who religiously discern the times, that the Lord, by his providence and grace, is car∣rying on, as from the morning of time, an inscru∣table, but yet perfectly consistent plan for the in∣struction, reformation and salvation of mankind?</P>
<P>THE late, mighty revolutions in this and other countries, are fraught with important consequen∣ces to mankind, and mark distinguished eras in the annals of nations. Beyond controversy, they are the work of God. It is true, they have been attended with temporal evils. Many individuals have suffered extremely: but still, those very changes so injurious to a few, are favorable to the morals and the happiness of men in general. Re∣publican governments, in their nature, are ever more friendly to virtue and rational enjoyments, than monarchical. A people suddenly liberated from a state of absolute subjection to the will of a sovereign of nobility, are likely to run to the op∣posite extreme of licentiousness; yet, when the administration of free government takes place with wisdom and energy, they see their duty and interest united, and soon settle in the medium of just sub∣ordination and rational obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="024747_0024_0FC868849CF4A4B8"/>VAST progress is made in the science of civil government. This knowledge is reduced to prac∣tice in many places, and the happy effects are en∣joyed. The genius of the Christian religion is more clearly perceived; superstition and bigotry are more done away; and we hope in God for a brighter exhibition of the gospel in practice.</P>
<P>IN America and Europe, the civil and religious "rights of man" are better understood, and more fully enjoyed, than in former periods: Hence, the spirit of civil and religious liberty prevails, except in a few places. The nations of chistendom, and different denominations of christians, are more than ever convinced, that <HI>the kingdom of God,</HI> among men, <HI>is not meat and drink;</HI> that it consisteth not in external forms, human creeds, articles of faith and modes of worship, but <HI>in righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv.17.</NOTE>—that it is not saying, <HI>Lord, Lord,</HI> but <HI>doing the will of God,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 18.</NOTE> that constitutes the good man. <HI>He that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii.21.</NOTE></P>
<P>OUR federal and state governments are propiti∣ous to religion. It is, however, wished by some, that for the good of society, if from no other mo∣tives, the visible observance of the sabbath, and the public worship of God, were more strictly enfor∣ced by the civil arm.</P>
<P>MEN of liberality in sentiments are of the opi∣nion, that such an exercise of civil power would be
<PB N="27" REF="024747_0025_0FC86885C9FCB3A0"/>
very beneficial to the community, and perfectly compatible with the principles of a free govern∣ment.</P>
<P>OUR rulers, in general, are men of religion, as well as men of wisdom. At the head of the Union sits our beloved and admired PRESIDENT, the friend of mankind, the glory of his country, and the ornament of human nature. He com∣pletes the unrivalled character by adding that of a christian. From his exalted station, he recom∣mends religion with peculiar advantage, and en∣forces it by an example as great as it is singular, and as illustrious as it is rare. Long may he live a blessing to his people. Eternally may he wear a crown of glory.</P>
<P>IN the churches of our Lord in America, peace and harmony are generally enjoyed among bre∣thren, and between ministers and people. <HI>Our young men are raised up for prophets, and the sons of the church for nazarites</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amos ii.2.</NOTE> to God. Schools and Colleges are encouraged; useful knowledge is promoted and happily diffused through the great body of the people. In a word, such is the pre∣sent, harmonious, and, on the whole, growing condition of the church in this land; such are the strides of liberty and free inquiry in this and foreign lands; such the diminution of Papal in∣fluence and bigotted zeal where they have long ty∣rannized, that we have reason to hope, that the promised period is not far distant, when, under the
<PB N="28" REF="024747_0026_0FC86887432B33F8"/>
spirit of truth, <HI>all shall know the Lord from the least unto the greatest,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxi.34. Heb. viii.2.</NOTE> <HI>and the righteousness of the church shall go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxii.1.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN a political view, I will only add, that (con∣sidering the youth of the people, and the infancy of our national existence) the present, flourishing state and progress of arts, agriculture, commerce, learning and knowledge in general, the wisdom and energy of the federal government, the union, harmony and population of the people, the natu∣ral resources and vast extent of our country, have the most pleasing and promising aspect on the fu∣ture growth and greatness of our nation. May the God of our fathers, whose right hand hath PLANTED and nourished THIS BRANCH, make us a people <HI>willing and obedient,</HI> and cause this land for ever to be <HI>the glory of all lands,</HI> for national pros∣perity, civil privileges, social happiness and pure religion.</P>
<P>AGREEABLY to my plan, I have a few words to offer on the future greatness and glory of the church, according to the promises of <HI>God who can∣not lie.</HI> Your patience is requested.</P>
<P>IF there be any thing in nature, beyond the reach of our bodily senses, on which we may safely depend, surely it is the <HI>truth</HI> of divine reve∣lation. Nothing of the kind, could have been better proved than the scriptures. Every passage
<PB N="29" REF="024747_0027_0FC8688BDA6A0A08"/>
that hath not been, will be accomplished. GOD WILL HASTEN IT IN HIS TIME, in <HI>the set time to favor Zion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psa. cii.13.</NOTE>. <HI>Glorious things are spoken of Zion;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psa. lxxxvii.3.</NOTE> such as we cannot, in any rational construction, suppose are fulfilled. The greatness and glory, the purity and influence of the church are yet to come. This is but the cause of goodness and happiness; and this a God of infinite benevolence and mercy will ever plead. Jesus Christ, the blessed Son of God, descended from the throne of the universe, assumed human nature, submitted to unspeakable sufferings and ignominious death, <HI>that he might redeem, purify,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii.14.</NOTE> and raise to glory, a church from among men; and that in and by her, God might receive the greatest glory and praise. She is <HI>the bride, the Lamb's wife.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi.9.</NOTE> Christ will nourish and honor, as well as love her. He hath proved, that she is dearer to him than life. Her duration, and final victory over all her spiritual enemies, are secured. She is <HI>founded upon a rock;</HI> and her almighty Redeemer, her bridegroom hath promised, that <HI>the gates of hell shall not prevail against her.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mat. xvi.18.</NOTE></P>
<P>TO establish farther these sentiments, I shall have recourse to the infallible oracles of God. There it is promised, <HI>That in the last days, the moun∣tain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And they shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears
<PB N="30" REF="024747_0028_0FC8688E5261CF80"/>
into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. ii.2, 4.</NOTE> Notwithstanding the increase of the church hither∣to, as mentioned, the vast spread of christianity since the days of our Savior, and that many nations and kingdoms embrace the religion of Jesus; yet, at this day, such multitudes bow not to Christ, so many nations know not his gospel, and such wars and fightings actually exist in many parts of the world, that we cannot believe, that the above prediction is fully accomplished.</P>
<P>ANOTHER prophecy of Isaiah to the same point, is worthy of notice. Speaking of the happy state of the kingdom of Christ, he saith, <HI>The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid: the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed, their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice—den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">xi.6, 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> Here universal, social a∣greement, and religious harmony of the most jar∣ing tempers, discordant sentiments, and opposite characters, are predicted, under the peaceful reign of the Prince of peace.

<P><PB N="31" REF="024747_0029_0FC86894447B4EF0"/>THAT we might depend upon such great things in behalf of the church, the Lord speaketh in the most absolute manner. <HI>Look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth; for I am God and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, that unto me every knee shall bow, and every tongue con∣fess.

<P>IN the accomplishment of these predictions, is included the return of the Jews from their long dispersion into all quarters of the globe, to believe
<PB N="32" REF="024747_0030_0FC86896C1145A18"/>
in the Savior already come. When the precious promises and prophesies of God's word shall be thus compleated, for which the church and godly people now wait and pray, then will commence the period termed the millenium. Then will be the thousand years special reign of Christ on the earth. That day is considered as emphatically the latter-day-glory of the church.

<P>SOME improvement adapted to the present oc∣casion is now to be made.</P>
<P>WE, my brethren of <HI>this</HI> church and town, may, in part at least, adopt the answer of the rebuilders of the temple at Jerusalem to those who inquired of them. <HI>We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ex. iv.11.</NOTE> Tho' unavoidable difficulties have retarded the work, yet it is now compleated.

While we felicitate ourselves, they, we doubt not, sincerely congratulate us, that a public spirit, and religious respect for the interests of the church, and the worship of God, have pre∣vailed among us, with so much peace and unani∣mity.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="024747_0031_0FC86898388A7108"/>WE <HI>rejoice</HI> and are <HI>glad,</HI> that as affectionate friends and brethren, we may say to one another, <HI>Let us go into the house of the Lord.

For those days,<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Built about eighty years ago.</NOTE> it was a house more spacious and distinguished, than <HI>this</HI> for the present times.</P>
<P>TO aid our meditations, on this occasion, and excite us more religiously to <HI>regard the operation of the Divine hand,</HI> and the times that pass over us, I shall take a brief, historical view of the town and church, as far as records and my knowledge of facts will permit.</P>
<P>THIS TOWN was incorporated as a plantation, at <HI>Musquetequid,</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">The original Indian name.</NOTE> by the name of CONCORD, by an act of the General Court of the then pro∣vince, held at <HI>Newtown,</HI> September 3d, 1635. <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">This is made certain by the records in the Secreta∣ry's office of this Commonwealth.</NOTE>
<PB N="34" REF="024747_0032_0FC86899B5D6C6A0"/>
The town was fairly purchased of the natives, and payment duly made to their satisfaction. The tract of land first purchased, was <HI>six miles square;</HI> the centre being very near the spot where the Meeting-house now stands. <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><P>The purchase, payment, extent, &amp;c. of the town, are certified by the depositions of two white men, viz. William Butterick and Richard Rice, and two christian Indians, viz. Jehojakin and Jethro. They unitedly testify and say, "That they were present at the making the bargain for the town of Concord.—That at the house of Mr Peter Bulkeley. (the Rev. <HI>P.</HI> Bulkeley) Mr. Simon Willard, Mr. John Jones, Mr. Spencer and others, did purchase of Squaw Sachem, Tahattawau and Nimrod, a tract of land six miles square, the centre being the place (or near) where the bargain was made.—That said Wil∣lard and others did pay for said land in wampam peage, hatchets, hoes, knives, cotton cloth and chintz, to the said Indians.—And, that Wappacowet, husband to Squaw Sa∣chem, received a suit of cotton cloth, a hat, a white, linen band, shoes, stocking and a great coat, on account of said bargain.—That in the conclusion, the Indians decla∣red, that they were satisfied, and that the English were welcome."</P>
<P>The above depositions were taken by authority, before Thomas Danforth, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Cambridge, and are recorded in the town-book of Concord, in lieu of the first town records which were <HI>burnt.</HI></P></NOTE> Additions were afterward made by grant and purchase.</P>
<P>IT appears, that the first settlers of the town, were very careful to have a just and fair title to the soil. They were not only just, but generous. Charity obliges us to believe, that they <HI>feared God and regarded man,</HI> and exemplified to the Savages the religion of Jesus; the love of which induced
<PB N="35" REF="024747_0033_0FC868A3357EA808"/>
them to encounter innumerable hardships, <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Johnson's Wonder-Working Providence of Zion's Saviour in New-England.</NOTE> in this then dreary wilderness. History informs us, that the first adventurers suffered extremely, both from want and fatigue; but, that
<Q>they endured manfully the greatest difficulties and forest labors that ever any people with such weak means have done.</Q>
<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> This was the first inland settlement in New-England, at any considerable distance from the sea-shore. In that day, it was a long and tedious journey from Cambridge to Concord. They had to pass a gloomy, pathless wilderness, through brush, briars, swamps, &amp;c. So that, not only their clothes, but their flesh was torn, and their strength sometimes exhausted. <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> A larger number came at first to this place, than usually begin new settle∣ments.

<P>IN the infancy of this town, it was remakably protected from the rage of the savages. It is ra∣tionally supposed that the full satisfaction which the Indians received, when they sold the land, ren∣dered them more peaceable towards the inhabi∣tants. Especially, did the God of his praying

<P>The Rev'd. <HI>Daniel Bliss</HI> was ordained, March 7th, 1738. At that time, the church consisted of eighty members.

and preached, many who now hear me, having both seen and heard him, are more competent jud∣ges than I am. He died, May 11th, 1764, aged 49.</P>
<P>THE Rev'd. <HI>William Emerson</HI> was ordained, January 1st, 1766. His love for his country in∣volved in a distressing war, prevailed over the tenderest ties of social, domestic and pastoral con∣nections. <HI>That</HI> love, however, must have been aided by a sense of duty, and hope of greater use∣fulness, or it had not been so invincible. He left his beloved flock, and endeared family, to join the army, at Ticonderoga, August 16th, 1776. He fell a prey to dire disease, October following, at Rutland, Otter-Creek. Could he have died in the presence of his family and friends; or could the kind hand of a partner, a child, a parent have administered cordials, in <HI>that</HI> solitude, it had been some consolation, and even the distresses of a dying bed had been mitigated. But I forbear. Infinite wisdom directed otherwise. His covenant God did not forsake him. We have plenary evidence, that he died in strong faith for himself and his family, and like a christian hero. We doubt not, he is a conqueror through Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>UNDER his ministry, almost eleven years, sixty-six persons were admitted to full communion, and five hundred and six baptized. His memory must still be dear to this people. <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Being Mr. <HI>Emerson</HI>'s immediate successor, and hav∣ing had some personal acquaintance with him, it may be expected, and with good reason, that I take more notice of him and his character, than of my other predecessors.</NOTE> Tho' his animat∣ing

<P>THE present Speaker is the seventh pastor of the christian society here. He was ordained Novem∣ber 11th, 1778. Since that time sixty-two per∣sons have been admitted to full communion, and four hundred baptized, <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">It is judged, that about three-fourths of the chil∣dren born in town are baptized.</NOTE> in this church. Since the death of the Rev'd. Mr. <HI>Bliss,</HI> when the church hath been vacant, one hundred and twenty-six have been baptized. The present number of communicants is one hundred and fifty-one. <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">It is now, and long has been the practice with us, that many make a prosession of religion, and yet attend not the holy supper.</NOTE>

Of the unworthiness of the present pastor, to fill <HI>a golden candlestick</HI> of Jesus Christ, and the small success in his work, it is more suitable for him to be deeply sensible, than to give a description.</P>

In this work, you, my brethren of this town, have done yourselves honor. The harmony that has prevailed, is com∣mendable. That a large society should all agree in judgment, and have the same mind in circum∣stantials, is scarce possible.

<P>BUT, let me not forget to mention the worthy deeds of the <HI>fair</HI> sex of this town.</P>

<P>LET us now, my brethren, duly consider the design for which <HI>this</HI> house is built, and improve it accordingly.</P>
<P>LET <HI>this</HI> day of dedication be a day of united and personal conversation of ourselves to God and his service. Let <HI>this day</HI> be the epoch of general conversion to God; and more memorable for our thorough reformation, and <HI>careful departure from all iniquity,</HI> than for any other transactions.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="024747_0043_0FC868BEABBBC918"/>To do thus is our privilege, and will forever be our happiness. <HI>Here</HI> may the eternal God, whose servants we are, condescend to dwell by his spirit and grace.

Your skill is displayed. Your works praise you. But, let me tell you, there is an art more excellent; the <HI>divine</HI> art of living religiously to that God, <HI>who dwelleth not in temples made with hands.</HI> In the exercise of <HI>this</HI> art, you must, each one for your∣self, on Christ the foundation, rear the spiritual building of faith and holiness. You must your∣selves be the living <HI>temples of the living God,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii.16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii.10.</NOTE> Otherwise, this house which ye have builded, will witness against you, and ye will not be admitted into the <HI>new Jerusalem,</HI> and the temple of God above. O build for eternity!</P>
<P>A FEW practical remarks shall close this dis∣course.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> IN all the concerns and increase of the church, God should be acknowledged and praised. This is peculiarly the duty of a people professing godliness, and embracing christianity. As <HI>in all our ways,</HI> so especially in religious concernments, we should <HI>acknowledge God, ask wisdom of him,</HI> and be ever ready to say, <HI>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truths sake.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psa. cxv.1.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="024747_0045_0FC868C8F8ED9FA8"/>SINCE the canon of scripture hath been com∣pleated, such visible manifestations of Deity are not to be expected, as were frequent under the Theocracy of the Jewish nation; yet the Lord is not the less present with his people, and hath not the less love to his church. Her support and increase ever have been, and ever will be of the power and grace of God. <HI>For his own Name sake,</HI> he will preserve and prosper Zion. Collectively and in∣dividually, she is dear to him <HI>as the apple of his eye.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xvii.8.</NOTE> The Lord Jesus Christ <HI>is head over all things to the church;</HI> and hath <HI>all power given unto him▪ both in heaven and in earth.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. i.22. Mal. xxviii.18.</NOTE> To our Savior God let christians ever seek, and offer unceasing praise.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> IT is the obvious duty of all to im∣prove, and co-operate with every revival of reli∣gion. Every commotion among people, with pre∣tensions to religion, is not a genuine concern to know and obey the Lord. <HI>Every spirit is not of God.</HI> We are, therefore, directed to <HI>try the spirits, whether they are of God.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. iv.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> But there are times, when the Spirit of God is sent down in more plentiful ef∣fusions; when <HI>the Lord cometh and raineth down righteousness. Then</HI> the minds of men are more susceptible of divine impressions, and opened to receive the truth. For such times the godly pray, as did the prophet, <HI>O Lord revive thy work.</HI> When such seasons do come, and people are inquiring the way to heaven, the ministers of the gospel should be very attentive to discern, and faithful to
<PB N="48" REF="024747_0046_0FC868CA972CDC80"/>
improve the favourable opportunity for the con∣version of sinners, and the comfort and confirma∣tion of believers. Those who are <HI>men</HI> in Christ also, tho' not teachers, should gently lead <HI>babes</HI> to <HI>the sincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby.</HI> All should welcome and join such influ∣ence as disposes sinners to inquire <HI>what they shall do to be saved,</HI> and <HI>the wicked to forsake his way.</HI> All should be very careful not to <HI>break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii.20.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> I SHALL here be permitted, I trust, a very natural remark which respects the ministers of Christ. It arises, my fathers and brethren, from our office; and is contained in the words of the apostle: <HI>We then are workers together with God.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi.1.</NOTE> We are commissioned and sent forth for the express purpose of promoting the interests of religion, the increase of the church, and the sal∣vation of precious souls. We are engaged in the same glorious cause of <HI>peace on earth and good will to men,</HI> leading to heavenly glory, with the God of all grace, the Savior of sinners, and the Spirit of truth. Men never were employed in a better cause than <HI>that</HI> which we plead. It must be pleasant to a benevolent mind, to proclaim pardon to the guilty, salvation to the wretched, and to <HI>beseech</HI> sinners <HI>to be reconciled to God.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v.20.</NOTE> Can we be indo∣lent? Shall we not exert ourselves? Yes; through Christ strengthening us, we will <HI>take heed to our∣selves, and to our doctrine.</HI> We will carry the church, and the souls of our people, in the arms
<PB N="49" REF="024747_0047_0FC868CC0807A230"/>
of our affection and prayer, to the throne of grace. We will pray so fervently, preach so faithfully, and live so piously, as to <HI>save both our∣selves and them that hear us.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv.16.</NOTE> To encourage us, we may call to mind what our Lord said to his first ministers; <HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii.20.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> IN the darkest times, as to religion, there is ground for faith and hope. God is in the church, and is engaged to defend and prosper her. IN HIS TIME HE WILL HASTEN IT. The <HI>burning bush</HI> which Moses saw in <HI>Horeb,</HI> justly represents the church. <HI>The bush burned; but was not con∣sumed. The Lord was in the midst of the bush.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ex. iii.2, 4.</NOTE> So he is in the midst of the church, in all her afflic∣tions and trials, and will never suffer her to be <HI>consumed. The Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</HI> The most glo∣rious works of God, before the children of men, have been in behalf of the church. Our discourse has been chiefly to this point.</P>
<P>SHOULD <HI>mothers</HI> prove monsters, and <HI>forget</HI> to nourish their tender babes, <HI>yet, saith the Lord, will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands, thy walls are continu∣ally before me.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isa. xlix.15, 16.</NOTE> With such precious promises of such an Almighty Friend, the church may <HI>rejoice in hope,</HI> amidst the most gloomy appearances.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="024747_0048_0FC868D2902E5968"/><HI>Fifthly.</HI> WE remark, the unavailing power of the enemies of the church, and of religion. To such enemies we may say, <HI>Perceive ye how ye pre∣vail nothing?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. xii.19.</NOTE> Were they duly to read the holy scriptures, and consider the divine procedure, they would tremble at the thought of being enemies to religion, and the people of God. Every moment they are exposed to the insupportable wrath of an infinite and angry God, whose government, good∣ness and church they oppose. They who set themselves against the honor of God, the peace, happiness and salvation of men, may be certain, that, in such a mind, they <HI>shall perish, and be ut∣terly wasted. To the Lord belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii.35.</NOTE> It is <HI>the madness of folly</HI> to oppose <HI>that</HI> cause which the infinite God is engaged to promote, even to the utter destruction of its enemies.</P>
<P>THE church may say, as Elisha said to his ser∣vant, when a host compassed the city to destroy him. <HI>Fear not; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Kings vi.16.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT has been shown abundantly, that no wisdom, nor might, nor dignity of man, can prevail against God. <HI>If God be for us, who can be against us?</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii.31.</NOTE> Consider these things, ye who forget God, who
<PB N="51" REF="024747_0049_0FC868D38642D820"/>
submit not to his government, who despise the church, who make light of Christ, and practise not his holy religion. Collect your thoughts, and see, <HI>who hath hardened himself against God, and hath prospered?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job ix.4.</NOTE></P>
<P>ONCE more. Our duty, interest and happiness, all urge us to join the cause of God and religion, of Christ and the church. This is obvious thro' the whole discourse. Let all who hear me, be persuaded to this. Let every one <HI>bow the knee to Jesus Christ,</HI> and regulate their faith and practice by his heavenly doctrines and example. My hearers, <HI>it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii.47.</NOTE> <HI>Choose this day whom you will serve;</HI> and henceforth, may we all be the true disci∣ples of Jesus Christ, and qualified to join the church triumphant in endless glory.</P>
<P>WITH overcoming faith, lively hope and ardent prayer, let christians look forward to the future peace, purity and glory of the church, predicted and promised in the holy scriptures. The pros∣pect is calculated to animate you in duty, and to comfort you under sorrows. I have a disposition to dwell upon this thought; but, perhaps, I have already been too lengthy.</P>
<P>I WILL close, therefore, with the prophetic words of the Psalmist, ultimately expressive of future, spiritual blessings to the gospel church and children of God. <HI>They shall fear thee, as long
<PB N="52" REF="024747_0050_0FC868D4F766A9B8"/>
as the sun and moon endure, throughout all genera∣tions. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass; as showers that water the earth. In his days shall the righteous flourish: and abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth. He shall have domi∣nion from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth: they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him▪ and his enemies shall lick the dust. His name shall endure for ever; men shall be blessed in him, and all nations shall call him blessed.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxii.</NOTE> Let us all join in the praise, while we add, <HI>Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doth won∣drous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory.</HI> AMEN AND AMEN.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ibid.</NOTE></P>
