<P>Madam,</P>
<P><HI>A</HI>S I was casting in my mind to present you with something in token of my high Esteem for your Vertue, I happily met with these <HI>Last Hours</HI> of a Young <HI>French</HI> Lady; in which I found so many things rare &amp; admi∣rable, useful &amp; edifying, divinely transporting and inflaming, that I concluded it a Gift most agreeable and comporting with your Pious and Devout Inclinations; and therefore was soon determin'd in my thoughts to De∣dicate

this <HI>Translation</HI> to you, as judging it (setting aside my own Faults) most word thy of your Acceptance. For what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> imagined more strange and wonderful, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to see so tender an Age, so weak a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so dedicate an Education, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the most formidable of all thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>King of Terrors,</HI> but Triumphing and trampling on him?

What more transporting, than to hear a Soul wounded with Divine Love, send forth its flaming Desires to the Glorious and All-Beautiful Object of them? Or what can be thought more engaging and inciting to Vertue, than to see not only the Peaceful, but Joyful Latter End therefor; and what great Triumphs and Exultations attend it, even in the most difficult and affrighting Circumstances of the last Scene of Life?

<P>All the Night long she was rehearsing the most pathetical Verses of the Psalms; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the morning (being <HI>Monday</HI>) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Catholick</HI> being come to see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> out Nine of the Clocks, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his grief upon the score of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ckness, she answer'd his Civility, and withal gave him an account of her <HI>Faith, and the Hope that was in her</HI>; assuring him, she was resolved to Die in that Religion, which she was brought up in, and always had profess'd. Some few days after this, a <HI>Divine,</HI> by name Monsieur <HI>Boursault,</HI> being come to visit her, discoursed her a little while, and then Pray'd with her; she instancing to him, after his Prayer was ended, what part of it had most affected her. This whole day (as the foregoing). she pass'd in continual sighs and tears; often cryed out, <HI>Oh</HI>! <HI>how much weak∣ness and infirmity, O my God, am I sensi∣ble of</HI>! <HI>Oh</HI>! <HI>how unworthy am I to appear before thee</HI>! If thou, O Lord, mark my transgressious, I shall not be able to a∣bide it. B<HI>ut, O my God, I beseech thee speak peace unto me, and say to my Soul,</HI> I am thy Salvation.</P>

<L>Incline thine ear to hear my voice,</L>
<L>And pity on me take:</L>
<L>As thou wast wont, so help me, Lord,</L>
<L>Lest life should me forsake.</L>
<BIBL>Psal. 119.149. <HI>Old Translation</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>Since my Sins do abound, O Lord to make thy Grace much more abound towards me, <HI>Rom. 5.20.</HI> Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving kindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy mercies, <HI>Psal. 69.16, 17, 18.</HI> And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble. O haste thee, and hear me. Draw nigh unto my Soul, and save it, for thy mercies sake.</P>
<P>WITH these she rehearsed also seve∣ral admitable Sentences she had learn'd out of a Book Intituled, [<HI>Comforts a∣gainst the Terrors of Death</HI>;] which be∣ing slipt out of our mind, are not men∣tioned here.</P>
<P>SHE having been from the <HI>Sabbath</HI> Morning in continual frights and dis∣quiets, occasion'd by the sense of her Sins, and her apprehension of God's Judgments found her Spirit calmed,
<PB N="13" REF="001933_0007_0FBA1EDB837792C0"/>
and her mind much compos'd, about Seven of the Clock in the Evening, when she felt the Comforts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and was fill'd with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Joy and Glory which God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their hearts, who are struck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a lively sorrow for having offend∣ed Him</P>
<P>NOW at the time of these happy in∣spirations it was, that she hearing them, who were about her, talk of giving her something to refresh her Body, said to them, <HI>All that is done to me, is to no pur∣pose; for from my God I have received the only Remedy my Soul so much long'd for. I called upon the Lord in my trouble, and the Lord heard me at large. I feel my God is on my side: therefore I will fear no evil. For the right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord brings mighty things to pass,</HI> Psal. 118.5, 6, 16. <HI>The Lord has inclined his ear unto me: therefore will I call upon him as long as I breath. The snares of Death compassed me about, and the pains of Hell gat hold of me. I found trouble and heaviness; but I will call upon the Name of the Lord: O Lord, I beseech

thee, deliver my Soul. Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. The Lord preserves the simple: I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and he helped me.

<P>HERE she making a stop, they gave her that which was prepared for her; and some of the Company telling her she should endeavour to take some rest, she answer'd, That the Rest and Peace she felt in her Soul, was her sole joy and happiness.

<P>THEN another saying to her, <HI>But, Madam, suppose God would spare you to us</HI>—Here she reply'd, without giving the party leave to go on, <HI>Not my will, O Lord, but thy will be done,</HI> Mat. 26.39. <HI>Nevertheless it is far better for me to depart and be with my Saviour,</HI> Phil. 1.23. <HI>But, O my God, Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</HI> And so proceeded to the end of the <HI>Lord's Prayer</HI>; and

your Posterity, and establish his Co∣venant with them for all Generati∣ons, as long as the Sun and Moon shall endure.</Q> Then the proceeded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give her Blessing to the young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦dies her Sisters, (whom the call'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her) and likewise to her Brothers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣thers-in-law, Sister-in-law, and Niece, though they were absent. And after this, desiring they would all come near her, who were in her Chamber, and had (in company with the Chaplain) watch'd with her the Night before, she in a most tender manner embrac'd and bless'd them all; speaking to every one of them according to their respective conditions, &amp; that so pertinently &amp; pro∣prly, that she was the admiration of all.</P>
<P>AND in a particular manner she shwe'd a great deal of respect to <HI>Mon∣sieur de la Colombrie,</HI> (who was Steward of the House) expressing her acknow∣ledgment to him for his great concern and affection for their Family, desiring him to continue the same. Then speaking to his Wife Mrs. <HI>de la Colom∣broe,</HI> said to her, <Q>Come and rejoyce
<PB N="33" REF="001933_0019_0FBA1EFBD835D0A0"/>
with me, and take your share of these delights I am filled with, as feeling my self the most satisfi'd and happy Person in the World.</Q> And afterwards directing her Speech and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hortation to the whole Company, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <Q>My dear Friends, leave off sin∣ning, I pray you: You see what cru∣el disquiets mine have caus'd me: Let us, according to our Calling, e∣difie the Church of God, and shew good Examples in our Lives and Conversations.</Q> <HI>Let us</HI> (as the Apostle advises) <HI>live soberly, righteously, and god∣ly in this present World</HI>: Tit. 2.12. And <HI>whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are good report; if there be any ver∣tue, if there be any praise, let us think on these things,</HI> Phil. 4.8. <Q>O how great is my love for you, my dear Friends; I love every one of you alike in JESUS CHRIST, for I have no more affection to my own Mother, Brothers, and Sisters, than all other persons I know. I am in charity with all the World,

would e'n love my Enemies, if I had any.</Q></P>
<P>NOW she hearing some body weep about her Bed, said, <Q>Don't y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mourn for me, but mourn for y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Sins.</Q> Then presently recalling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> words, she thus express'd her self: 'Oh, let us lament and bewail our Sins! And for a proof she was not mov'd at all with the Tears they shed on her ac∣count, added, That <HI>now she knew no bo∣dy after the flesh,</HI> 2 Cor. 5. 16. Which saying of the Apostle she had learn'd of Monsieur <HI>Royer,</HI> to whom a pious Lady spoke it on her Death-bed. Whereupon she calling him to mind, wished him all happiness, and gave him the Character of a real Good Man; saying, <Q>He is a person whom I have always observ'd to be most piously and charitably inclined. I pray God bless him, and more and more increase his Gifts in him. Would I could see him, I know he would speak comfortable words to me, and we would edifie one ano∣ther.</Q> Here she repeated her earnest

wishes for a Blessing upon Monsieur <HI>de Malnoe,</HI> whom she always call'd her good Pastor, and her dear Pastor, and embracing him, heartily pray'd, that he might ever live quietly and in peace with his Brothers, and Prosperity ne∣ver depart from his Family; saying to him, 'I heartily beg of God to bless 'you and your Ministry. And she at the same time expressed also a great desire to see Monsieur <HI>de Brissac,</HI> pray∣ing God likewise to bless both him and his. Thus having spoken for a while to the Standers-by, she began again to return her thanks to God, with the same zeal and servency as before; say∣ing with <HI>David.</HI></P>

<P>THUS she took great delight in the paraphrasing of the Scripture; seem∣ing, as it were, to have receiv'd a new <HI>Vocation</HI> from God, and above all, <HI>that</HI> of teaching every one their duty: Nei∣ther was she wanting in the stirring up herself to the performance of her own, who often rehears'd these Words of the Psalmist: Psal. 34. 1, 2. <HI>I will al∣ways give thanks unto the Lord; his praise shall ever be in my mouth.

<P>IN the mean time they that stood by, looking on a Watch that was upon the Table, and perceiving there∣by (it being now past Mid-night) that she had been speaking above six Hours, were much astonished, consi∣dering the vehement palpitation of her
<PB N="39" REF="001933_0025_0FBA1F0C422E7CA8"/>
heart, and the difficulty she had to fetch her breath: Which made the Company desire her to leave off dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ursing, for fear of spending her self so much. But this advice was so un∣welcome to her, that he presently, with some indignation, answered, <Q>I cannot hold my tongue, I must speak for, <HI>My heart is inditing of a good mat∣ter,</HI> Psal. 45.1. <HI>O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will sing and give praise with the best member that I have,</HI> Psal. 108.1.</Q> After which, she remaining silent for a little while, broke out im∣mediately into these Words: <Q>O what pain do I suffer in holding my peace!</Q> And indeed she had no soo∣ner left off speaking, but they heard a Ratling in her Throat that was very troublesome to her: but she neverthe∣less continu'd still to entertain her self with God; when the Company with∣drawing, the Lady her Mother laid down her self by her, and both of them had a pretty good rest that Night.</P>
<P>THE next Morning (being Thurs∣day) after she had had some discourse
<PB N="40" REF="001933_0026_0FBA1F1638D83B18"/>
with the Lady her Mother, she gave her hand to a Gentleman of the Neigh∣bourhood, that was come to visit her: and observing him to weep, said to him, <Q>What, Sir, do you weep? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it because God has a love for me, and will take me to himself?</Q> Here she alledg'd the Example of <HI>Josiah</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI> whom God took out of the World, because he loved him, that he might not see those Calamities that were to befal the City of <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> and the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation. Then she speaking to the Lady her Mother, said, <Q>O dear Mother, how well compos'd am I at this time! I feel no pains at all; but am very easie, and do perceive my Saviour has deliver'd me from all my fears and troubles: Therefore I will give him eternal thanks and praise.</Q> Where∣upon she presently began to recite se∣veral Psalms (both in Prose and Verse) as the VI.XXV.XXVII.XXXII.XXXIV.LXVI.CIII.CXVIII.CXLVI; insisting particularly upon those places that were most proper for
<PB N="41" REF="001933_0027_0FBA1F17848C7D60"/>
her condition, and afforded her most comfort: which she uttered with so much zeal and devotion, that it made the Lady her Mother say to her, <Q>Well dear Child, thou art a going to make one in the Quire of Angels and Seraphims, and shalt very suddenly sing the Song of the Lamb. Yes, (answered she) I shall make sweet Melody, and sing everlasting <HI>Hallelu∣jahs</HI> to his Glory.</Q> And perceiving the Lady her Mother was very atten∣tive to what she said, added, <Q>Good Mother, we must always endeavour to edifie our Neighbours by praising God; and administer such Comfort to them, as we would be glad to re∣ceive our selves at God's hand.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER this, a Gentlewoman ask∣ing her, whether she would not take something, she answered, <Q>I have no will of my own; bring me what you will, and do what you please with me, it will be all one to me.</Q> Then she turn'd to another Gentlewoman, that was just come into the Room, who I expressing her self to have been much
<PB N="42" REF="001933_0028_0FBA1F19D3708060"/>
edified by the good things, she had heard her speak the night before, this devout Patient reply'd, <Q>My dear Friend, don't you wonder at my speaking so long with so much bold∣ness and freedom, who was ever bashful, and of few words? These are Gifts of God not to be forgotten.</Q> Which having said, she look'd about, and perceiving the Lady her Mother weep, said to her, <Q>Tis not you, dear Mother, have cause to shed tears; 'tis Madam</Q>—(she meant a Gen∣tlewoman, who was Mother to one that was turn'd a <HI>Papist</HI>) <Q>who has a reason to bewail her Daughter. But as for yours, she is going to him who is the Dispenser of true Glory, and not of Vanities.</Q></P>
<P>SOME hours after this, the Young Ladies her Sisters coming to sit upon her Bed, the Lady their Mother came and sate with them; and as she was saying to God, <HI>Behold, Lord, here am I, and the Children thou hast given me,</HI> Isa. 8.18. Patient answer'd, <Q>Dear Mother, let us yield thanks to God.</Q> <HI>But what
<PB N="43" REF="001933_0029_0FBA1F1CAFADEEC0"/>
shall I render to the Lord for all his Bene∣fits towards me?</HI> Psal. 116.12. <Q>Pray, my dear Mother and Sisters, afford me your assistance to bless my God, and never mourn for me; for I am too happy, in that my good God calls me to himself. How miserable (alas!) should I have been in the World, where we do nothing else but offend Him, go through a great deal of trouble (being our own Tormen∣tors) and in a word, run after Va∣nities, and mind nothing but Pride.</Q> To which the Lady her Mother ans∣wered, <Q>My dear Child, thou wast very far from being worldly minded, and have any vain or proud thoughts. O Mother (replied she) you did not know the bottom of my heart: Cer∣tainly I had Pride in me, and would fain have made a shew in the World; and (perhaps) if I had remain'd longer in it, it would have prov'd my undoing. Pray God keep our Brethren, who are expos'd to great trials.</Q> Some of them she did name, and added, <HI>Let him that thinks he stands,

take heed left he fall,</HI> 1 Cor. 10.12. <HI>The world passes away, and the lust thereof; but he that does the will of God, abides for ever,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.17. Then applying her self to the Young Ladies her Sister she said to them, <Q>Dear Sisters, keep always constantly to God's Word, and store your selves well with it.</Q> (<HI>Lord, thou hast magnified thy word above all thy Name,</HI> Psal. 138.2.) And withal she charged them to learn the Psalms of the late Monsieur <HI>Conrart's</HI> Translation, and Monsieur <HI>Gilberts</HI>; picking out (first) such as afforded most comfort. As for herself, she had got twenty five of the former, and twelve of the lat∣ter, by heart, at thirteen years of age; and the whole Book of Psalms, accor∣ding to the Old Translation, which she had learn'd at the late Lady Mar∣chioness <HI>de Verat's,</HI> that was both her Aunt and God mother, with whom she liv'd for a time. She had also several of them in Profe by heart, which she extreamly delighted in, and though she was very perfect in sundry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and most of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fying place,
<PB N="45" REF="001933_0031_0FBA1F2117778D98"/>
of the Scripture, (which she could say without Book) yet she did off com∣plain of her want of memory.</P>
<P>AFTER a little pause, she began fresh to speak, and applying her self to one of the Young Ladies her Sisters, she exhorted her above all, to learn a certain Prayer out of the fore-menti∣oned Book, called [<HI>Comforts against the Terrors of Death</HI>] for God's Assistance and Grace to Die well, and advised her to use the same daily, and intimating, that God had granted to her all the Petiti∣ons therein. She was also wont to re∣peat every Morning the 90th Psalm.</P>
<P><HI>LORD, thou hast been our Refuge from one Generation to another,</HI> and so on, to the end.</P>
<P>A GENTLE WOMAN of the Neighbourhood having brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo Daughters to her, whom she had desired the night before to see, she said to them, <Q>My dear Friends, have always the fear of God before your Eyes, and never depart from that Eternal truth which is in his Holy Scriptures. O∣bey
<PB N="46" REF="001933_0032_0FBA1F22C6675FB0"/>
your Parents and Superiours;</Q> And <HI>love not the World, neither the things that are in the World; for if any man love the World, the love of the Father not in him,</HI> 1 Joh. 2.15.</P>
<P>AT the same time she remembred four or five other She-Friends of hers, wishing them with her, and one a∣bove the rest, whom she ever had a great kindness for, and recommend∣ed her to the Lady her Mother, de∣siring her to take care of, and pro∣vide for her. And the Lady her Mo∣ther naming her some others, she ear∣nestly pray'd God to bless them all and in a particular manner implor'd his Divine help and assistance for one, who lay under an extraordinary great Affliction.</P>
<P>WHEN she was in health, she was not more backward, than she was for∣ward and desirous to speak now she was sick; delivering her self with a great deal of freedom, and omitting nothing of what she knew to be edify∣ing. After which, she fell into a lit∣tle slumber, and rested about an hour,
<PB N="47" REF="001933_0033_0FBA1F244242ACA0"/>
and then awaking, one of her Physi∣cians was surpriz'd to find her so well compos'd, she neither speaking, nor looking like one that was sick, but on the contrary having a serene counte∣nance, and a free and undisturbed mind. He did also wonder to hear her talk so well, as she did, of her condition; but yet for all that, he now began to despair of her Recovery, considering her great shortness of breath and weakness of her Stomach, that was not able to bear any thing; Nevertheless, she took whatever he gave her, saying to him, <Q>Sir, I will do any thing you shall please to di∣rect and prescribe; for since you are called to look after me, and give me relief, it behoves me to follow your Directions.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lady her Mother, whose sor∣row was greater than can be imagin'd, and who had no other comfort than what she receiv'd from her observing the Holy and Blessed Frame she was in, said to her, <Q>O dear Child, how edi∣fying were thy Words to the last
<PB N="48" REF="001933_0034_0FBA1F295DF422F8"/>
night, and are still! Aye, surely (replyed she) my mind was then much at liberty, and I had a great deal more freedom in my utterance than ever before. I was speaking very eloquently and freely of the wonderful works of God; and my mouth did utter things I never knew before. I then was made acquainted with the Mysteries of our Salvation, which are not to be known here be∣low. I cannot express them to you, for they are <HI>Things unspeakable</HI>; and through Mercy, I continue still in this Heavenly condition.</Q></P>
<P>THE rest of the day she was very still, and felt almost no pains, except when they gave her something; for that did set her a coughing. Her slumbers were frequent; and as she waked, always address'd her self to the Chaplain, and congratulated her hap∣py condition, rejoyced and triumph'd in the Grace she had receiv'd the day before. The only Subject of her En∣tertainment, was the HOLY SCRIP∣TURE,<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="4 pages" DISP="〈4 pages missing〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="001933_0035_0FBA1F2B6B78E800"/>
THOU hast dealt graciously with thy servant, O Lord, according to thy word, Psal. 119.65. <Q>It is that word that gives wisdom to the simple; therefore I will never forget it.</Q></P>
<P>TO this she added also divers other places of the Scripture; and then me∣ditating a little, she said, <Q>Now my fear is over,</Q> and (with St. <HI>Paul</HI>) <HI>There is now no condemnation to me, who am in CHRIST JESUS. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifies: Who is he that con∣demns? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again, who is ever at the right hand of God, making intercession for us,</HI> Rom. 8.1.33, 34. Upon which the Chaplain taking occasion to tell her she had done like that prudent Mer∣chant in the Gospel, who fought for and bought that Pear of Price; she answer'd, <Q>Aye, 'tis my Saviour has' made me a Present of this invaluable Jewel! For, Sir, is it not true, that <HI>none can affirm JESUS to be the LORD, but by the Holy Ghost?</HI> And that none can love him, but by the same
<PB N="54" REF="001933_0036_0FBA1F2C843FCC90"/>
Spirit? It is even He that has put this Word into the mouth of his Handmaid. O the unutterable Com∣fort and Relief this Word admini∣sters to me! It is you, my dear Mo∣ther (speaking to my Lady) who taught it me. You have so well in∣structed us, and shewn us a good Ex∣ample, which I wish I had better im∣prov'd. By this you have procur'd our Family the favour of God, whom I heartily pray to continue it, and more and more increase his. Blessings upon you, and prosper all your ways.</Q> To which Discourse the Lady her Mother made this reply: Dear Child, <Q>these Instructions and edifying words you now utter, I apply as so many Checks and Reproaches to my self, for my not having performed my Du∣ty in all respects, as I ought to have done. I pray God give me Grace to do better for the future, according to my Calling;</Q> and as <HI>it is in vain that</HI> Paul <HI>plants, and</HI> Apollos <HI>waters, except God give the increase</HI>; 1 Cor. 3.6. <Q>so I beseech him to prevent and bless my

endeavours with his Divine Grace, and Heavenly Benediction.</Q></P>
<P>THE rest of that day, and part of the following night also, were spent in like Conversations. But towards the Morning the Patient took some little rest; and as she awaked, asked what a Clock it was. To which they answered, that it was upon the stroke of Three, she cry'd out, <Q>O my God! shall the Sun shine once more upon my Sufferings? Lord, thou couldst, if it were thy pleasure, make this I the dawning of the Day of my De∣liverance and Eternal Sabbath; and then would I say with a holy trans∣port of mind</Q>, <HI>Behold now is the ac∣cepted time; behold, now is the day of Sal∣vation,</HI> 2 Cor. 6.2.</P>
<P>UPON which the Lady her Mother said, <Q>I hope every one of us shallonce see that Day, when we may say one to another</Q>, <HI>Thy Sun shall go down no more, for the Lord is an everlasting Light to thee; and the days of thy mourning are ended,</HI> Isai. 60.20. <Q>Aye, dear Mo∣ther,</Q>

<P><Q>O Death! thou that bring'st good tidings, how welcome wouldst thou be to me, by casting me into the Arms of my dearest Friend, who <HI>has lived me before the foundation of the World!</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS day she was visited again by one of her She-Friends, who being come to her Bed-side, express'd an ex∣tream sorrow to see her in this Condi∣tion, and with that gave her her hand,
<PB N="57" REF="001933_0039_0FBA1F3507E75C78"/>
which the Patient squeezing in hers, reply'd to her, <Q>O my Dear, did you but know the Divine Consolations my God has bestow'd upon me, and how happy I am, you would confess with me, that I should have been mi∣serable, without this his gracious Vi∣sitation.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER this, she had about an hour's sleep, out of which being a∣waked, she said, <HI>What is our Life</HI>? Truly, <HI>it is even a vapour that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away,</HI> Jam. 4.14. Therefore, <HI>O Lord, teach
us so to number our days, as that we may apply our hearts to Wisdom,</HI> Psal. 90.12. <HI>What is Man, that thou art mindful of him; and the son of man, that thou visitest him,</HI> Psal. 8.4. <HI>When his breath goes forth, he returns to his Earth,</HI> Psal. 146.4.

but the things which are not seen, are e∣ternal,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.18.</P>
<P>THEN she said, <Q>Pray let my Chaplain be call'd in, that he may comfort me. O the comforts of the Holy Ghost are the refreshment of my Soul.</Q> <HI>LORD, how sweet are thy words to my taste, yea sweeter than honey to my mouth!</HI> Psal. 119.103.</P>
<P>WHEN the Chaplain was come in, she said to him, <Q>Come, Sir, <HI>Let us go boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need,</HI> Heb. 4.16.</Q> Where∣upon he answering, <Q>Why don't you say, [Let us go and implore for Mer∣cy] rather than say, (as with confi∣dence you do) <HI>Let us go, that we may obtain mercy</HI>;</Q> She replv'd, <Q>Sir, it is because I find a Redeemer there, who has <HI>bought me with a price</HI></Q>, and said, <HI>Him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast out</HI>; 1 Cor. 6.20.

<P>DURING this whole day (which was Wednesday) she spake many other admirable things, that could not, all of them, be remember'd. One would have thought by seeing her, that her Soul was set loose from the Body. She had quite forgot the Earth, and all Ties and Relations here; her only thoughts being now to unite her self with her God by Meditation, till she might be more perfectly united to him, in Heaven.</P>
<P>ABOUT Evening shc felt a great drought in her Throat, and was very thirsty; yet they durst not give her a∣ny thing, by reason her Stomach could not bear so much as one drop of fair Water, without bringing of it up, and that with a vehement Cough, accom∣pany'd with a stoppage and shortness of breath; they therefore only call'd for an Epitheme, to allay her great pal∣pitation of heart. But she little re∣garding

the Relief they were willing to her Body, cry'd out on a sudden, <Q>LORD JESUS! thou my Heavenly Physician, apply the Merits of thy precious Blood to me; for that alone can infallibly heal my Soul.</Q></P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after this, she fell into most cruel Agonies, which made her take very little rest all that night: but yet she continu'd to com∣fort her self in God; seeking no where else, but in his Word, for a Remedy to all her griefs. And in these circum∣stances she often cry'd, <HI>Speak, O Lord, for thy servant hears,</HI> 1 SAM. 3. 10. <Q>Speak thou, O my God, to the Soul of thy poor Hand-maid.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH having said, she asked a Gentleman that was opening the Win∣dows on her Chamber, what time of the day it was; he answer'd, It was almost day-light; adding, <Q>Madam, why do you ask me this Question? Have you a mind to do as <HI>David</HI> did, and rise by break of day to praise God? No, Sir, (reply'd she) I can't

<L>Early, my God, before 'tis light,</L>
<L>And all the Stars are up, but that which makes the day.</L>
<L>Whilst Heav'n alone with flames is bright,</L>
<L>And all below is hurl'd in sable vell of night,</L>
<L>Which they can neither draw nor take away;</L>
<L>Early I'll worship, and one glance from thee,</L>
<L>E're 'tis with others day, shall make it noon with me.</L>
<L>And as this dry and thirsty Land,</L>
<L>Where the ground, ready to expire for want of Rain,</L>
<L>Gaping, and out of breath does stand,</L>
<L>And shews its very bowels shrivled like its sand;</L>
<L>And having drunk, gapes for more drink again:</L>
<L>The Wilderness and I in this agree;</L>
<L>For as that thirsts for Rain, so, Lord, I thirst for thee.</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="001933_0044_0FBA1FFA5A445998"/>I thirst thy glorious Power to see,</L>
<L>As I have seen it in thy Temple heretofore;</L>
<L>When ravish'd with thy love to me,</L>
<L>To die I was content, could I hut so love thee;</L>
<L>And so to die, this Life would chuse no more:</L>
<L>Those thoughts so high my fainting Spi∣rit do raise,</L>
<L>That through my lips they force their voice in Songs of praise.</L>
<L>For this I'll bless thee, and on high,</L>
<L>To thy Great Name send up my praises whilst I live;</L>
<L>For since at present I enjoy</L>
<L>A mind content, it shall prepare for more supply.</L>
<L>Though thou at present only that dost give;</L>

<L>Than what my Body had from most deli∣cious food.</L>

<P>ABOUT Four of the Clock her Illness so encreas'dupon her, that she felt most intollerable pains; which was perceiv'd both by the sharp Shreeks, and lamentable Cries she from time to time put forth, and by the violent Convulsion-fies she suffer'd, that distor∣ted her Arms, and bent her Body dou∣ble. But for all this, her mind was still the same, and lost nothing of its strength and freedom.</P>
<P>IN one of these Fits she did cry to God, <Q>Lord, have Mercy on me.</Q> <HI>Let this Cup pass from me: Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt,</HI> Mat.26.38. In another Fit (which one would have thought would have thrown her out of her Bed, so vehemently it ross'd her Body) she cry'd out, <Q>Thunder, Lightning, bruise, break to pieces,
<PB N="64" REF="001933_0046_0FBA1FFEC5248B28"/>
and do what thou wilt with this poor Body; yet will I still love thee, O my God! Yea, I will always bless thee, for thy wondrous Love &amp; Mer∣cy to me.</Q></P>
<P>AT another time, as she felt a Fit a coming again upon her, said, <Q>Verily, <HI>Thine Arrows have wounded me</HI> already; Yet, O my God, though thou shouldst multiply thy Plaugues upon me to in∣finity, yet would that but the more increase my love towards thee.</Q></P>
<P>Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving kind∣ness is good; turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble! hear me speedily. Draw nigh unto my soul, <HI>Psal. 69.16, 17, 18. And</HI> thou, LORD JESUS, come; yea, come quickly, <HI>Rev. 22.20.</HI></P>

<BIBL>Psal 142.7. <HI>Sandys.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P><Q>I most humbly beseech thee O Lord, mitigate and allay my pains, and speedily place me with thee.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be

done,</HI> Luk. 22.42. Then she looking on the Lady her Mother, said to her, <Q>Dear Mother, I now suffer the cruel wounds and pangs of Death.</Q></P>
<P>AGAIN, at another time, when her violent pains seized her, she cry'd out, <Q>Pray to God for me, my dear Friends; pray assist me: I am quite spent. I am now a drinking the very dregs of the Cup of Affliction.</Q> Upon which the Chaplain said to her, <Q>Madam, God deals now with you, as he did once with his only begotten Son, with whom he never was more pleased, than when he lay under his deepest Sufferings. O (answered she) I do wholly submit my self to God's will.</Q> <HI>For when I am weak, then am I strong. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,</HI> 2 Cor. 12.10. Phil 4.13.</P>
<P>NOW the Fits returning very thick upon her, she cry'd to God, <Q>O my good Lord! How much do I <HI>suffer! But it is thy will, and it is mine too. Grant I may suffer patiently for that it is acceptable with thee,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.20.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="001933_0048_0FBA200481CC4808"/><Q>And I beseech thee, O Lord, <HI>Set a watch before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips,</HI> (Psal. 141.5.) that I may I notspeak unadvisedly with my tongue, or murmur against thee. For it is my earnest desire, always to bless and love thee, O my God.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER a little pause, she turning to the Company, said to them, <Q>I pray God shorten your Agonies, when any of you shall arrive at your latter End.</Q> And then again she called up∣on God, in these words of <HI>David</HI>:</P>
<Q><P>O thou on whom my soul for help relies, Let my distres find pity in thine Eyes.</P>
<BIBL>Psal. 57.1. Woodford.</BIBL></Q>

<P><HI>The sorrows of death compass me round about,&amp; the pains of hell have got hold upon, me I find trouble &amp; heaviness,</HI> Psal. 116.3. <HI>Hide not thy self from me in the needful time of my distress.

make my trouble known unto thee.</HI> <Q>Have mercy, Lord, on thy poor Hand-maid.</Q> <HI>My heart fails, and my Soul saints within me.</HI> All these passages she rehears'd at several times, in the midst of her ter∣rible pains: for she had not now breath to speak for a long time together.</P>
<P>AFTER this, she sate up in her Bed, and with a tone that would have made one think she was not the same per∣son, cry'd out,</P>
<Q><L>Why art thou troubled, soul, and restiess grown,</L>
<L>As if forgotten through despair,</L>
<L>As if thy God had left his care,</L>
<L>And lower, than indeed thou art, cast down?</L>
<L>Trust in him still, for thou his Name shalt praise:</L>
<L>And whom his absence has depress'd his sight shall raise.</L>
<BIBL>Psal. 42.11. Woodford.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THEN the Lady her Mother say∣ing to her. <HI>Like as a Father pities his Children, so the Lord pities them that fear him,</HI> Psal. 103.13. <Q>Aye, dear Mo∣ther, (answer'd she) your love is no∣thing in comparison of that my Sa∣viour

<P>WHENEVER she had any intervas From pain, she sate up in her Bed, praising God for the relief and ease he gave her, saying, <Q>I will ever bless and love thee, O my good God.</Q> And when her grief return'd, she held her sides with her hands, and excited her self to patience, with these words: [<Q>Courage, my Soul, still bless thy God; Courage, my Soul, still love thy God.</Q>] <HI>For the sufferings of this present World, are not worthy to be com∣pared with the glory which shall be revealed in us</HI>: Rom. 8.18. <Q>Though indeed my pain is very grievous.</Q></P>
<Q><L>And grief to th' Earth my soul low does bond,</L>
<L>That scare in sighs lean to Heav'n ascend;</L>
<L>Consum'd with care my soul and life decay,</L>
<L>And in my wasted flesh unwillingly do. stay.</L>
<BIBL>Psal. 31.10. Woodford.</BIBL></Q>
<P><PB N="69" REF="001933_0051_0FBA200CC74CA700"/>NOW her violent pains returning upon her, she cry'd out again, [I am quite spent.]</P>
<Q><L>O let me gather strenght, before</L>
<L>I pass away, and be no more.</L>
<BIBL>Psal. 39.13 sandys.</BIBL></Q>
<P><Q>O my God, thy Correction is ve∣ry severe; yet will I kiss the Rod wherewith thou chastifest me.</Q></P>
<P>WHEREUPON the Chaplain said to her, <HI>If you were without chastisement, then were you a Bastard, and not a true born Child:</HI> for you know, <HI>Whom the, Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every Child</HI> he receives, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.8, 6.

My Saviour has suffer'd for me</Q>; and <HI>if I suffer with him, I shall reign with him also.</HI> <Q>He had Vinegar and Gall given him to drink, and was wounded to the very heart for me.

<P>IMMEDIATELY after this, her pains seizing her again, she cry'd, <HI>All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me,</HI> Psal. 42.7. Which the Chaplain hearing, said to her, <Q>But, <HI>Madam,</HI> you don't add, that the Waves of his Mercy, and the Billows of his Grace have o∣ver-whelmed you also. Aye, (re∣ply'd she) 'tis very true, the Grace and Mercies of my God, are greater than all the Miseries I undergo.

In which she had not long continu'd but the Pangs of Death came upon her; she had vehement risings at her Sto∣mach; her Countenance was fallen; sweat proceeded from her Body in a∣bundance; the Ratling in her Throat increased; and her Eyes grew dim and were distorted. And being in this condition, one of her Acquain∣tance, by name Madam <HI>Herault,</HI> touch'd her arm, thinking she was a departing: But she recover'd of this Fit; and these Agonies being somewhat over, her Eyes re-ssum'd the same briskness and liveliness as before; she rubbing them with both her hands, to disperse the Clouds that had begun already to co∣ver them. Her Countenance also was restored to its former gaity and chear∣fulness; and she was heard to make a Melody, in singing the 84th <HI>Psalm.</HI></P>
<Q><L>How beauteous is the place where thou</L>
<L>Thy presence, Lord, dost grant!</L>
<L>O how I long t' approach thy Courts,</L>

<P>And so on</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="001933_0054_0FBA2015F7EAAAB0"/>THIS was a great surprize to many of them that were there; and yet, that was not all: For after she had took a little breath, and slumber'd (as be∣fore) a very little while, she stirr'd up her self anew, and began to sing the XCII Psalm. <HI>Patrick.</HI></P>

<P>THUS far only she went, tuning it to the Treble of <HI>Claudin,</HI> with all the Ornaments, and Graces that could be: And then falling again into the like slumber, she remain'd in it as long as the first time; after which, she tund the LXXX Psalm, whereof she sang these following Verses only. <HI>Sandys.</HI></P>

<P><HI>O</HI> GOD of all Flesh and Father of our Spirits, I know that any Death of thy Beloved Ones, is precious in thy sight, and that whatsoever mine may be, thou wilt take care of my Sal∣vation.

O Lord, thou knowest all thy works from Everlasting. Thou, with one glance, discoverest the deep∣est Abyss, and seest to the very bottom of Eternity. As thou hast precisely ap∣pointed the Hour of Death, so hast thou been pleas'd also to determine the man∣ner of it. O Great &amp; Living God! it is my duty wholly to acquiesce in thy A∣dorable Providence, &amp; absolutely sub∣mit my self to thy wise Decrees.

Finally, that my Soul may not be snatch'd away by any sort of violence, but that I may freely commend it into thy Fatherly Hands. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
