<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A SHORT contemplation of the animal oeconomy will convince us that life cannot be perpetual, under the present mode of existence: For we quickly perceive, by the law of our nature, we are subjected to changes, disease and death. From the first disease that affected man, the healing art must have taken its origin; as it is natural to believe that mankind must have been thus early impelled by sickness and pain to seek the remedies that nature afford∣ed for the removal or mitigation of their misery.—It is a pleasing and useful speculation, to trace our art from this embryo state to its present condition of improvement and maturity. In the dawn of medical knowledge, the evo∣lutions of the human mind must have been slow and imper∣fect. Great distress must have been suffered before many medical facts could have been investigated; and after all, these must have been the result of individual exertion. But, in the course of revolving time, and by the progress of civilization, the collective energies of men, under the be∣nign influences of freedom and the social compact, are con∣centred to a point, for accelerating the perfection of the art and sciences. Among these, if you except agricul∣ture, and the art of teaching children to think accurately and act well, the first in use, and the first in dignity, is the Healing Art, or the Science of Life—Yours is the hap∣piness <HI>"to associate for the express purposes of promoting
<PB N="6" REF="026892_0005_0FD22BFEB9521A50"/>
social and professional intercourse, as a happy means of disse∣minating medical knowledge; of investigating the diseases and remedies peculiar to our country, and thereby to lessen human misery; and of giving respectability and order to the practice of Physic."</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Constitution and By Laws of the Society.</NOTE> And, I trust, it may be added, of collecting, methodising and publishing medical facts and observations for the benefit of this age and of posterity.</P>
<P>LET it then be the design of this discourse, to call your attention to the <HI>Improvement of Medicine:</HI> For this will necessarily lead me, concisely, to point out some of the principal objects of the Institution, by which the advanta∣ges derivable from this establishment will be rendered ob∣vious to the Community; and, to shew some of the means of making the Institution useful to the citizens, and honor∣able to its members.</P>
<P>THE novelty of the occasion, as well as the mixed aspect of medical affairs, seemed to require that something should be offered on this subject. A short essay on some therapeu∣tic subject, perhaps, would be more acceptable to several of the members.—But, to adopt this plan, I trust, will fulfil your design in appointing an anniversary discourse, and at the same time, be productive of more general utility.</P>
<P>A DIFFIDENCE of my own abilities, would have forbid∣den my appearing before you on this occasion, had I not been confident of enjoying the exercise of that candour and generosity of sentiment, while an attempt is made to per∣form the duty you have assigned me, which has been so often conspicuous in your stated meetings.</P>
<P>THE medical and philosophical societies in Europe have already done much to promote and accomplish the excel∣lent
<PB N="7" REF="026892_0006_0FD24B403A7C9C48"/>
designs for which you are associated. They have brought us to the gate of the temple of nature; they have drawn aside the veil of ignorance and mysteries; they have invited us to enter and accompany them, as patient inquirers in the investigation of life, health, and disease.—With the other parts of united America, let us join our Brothers of the old world, in this excellent work of the study of nature. Thus shall we pay a debt that is due to society and mankind, and "learn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pythagorae aurea carmino.

<P>No<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> America is replenished with a rich variety of objects for the improvement of every branch of medicine—After we have attended to the geography of our country, one of the first subjects that should arrest our attention, is the effect that is produced on the public health, by the progress of agriculture, and the consequent salutary changes of our climates.</P>
<P>THE changes of temperature, and local situation, that are constantly taking place on this globe, afford subjects for useful medical researches.—It may be permitted to adduce a few facts to illustrate this point.—All the northern and western parts of America, exhibit a good picture of the ancient condition of most of the European climates:—</P>
<P>IN 860, the Mediterranean was covered with ice:</P>
<P>IN 1296, the Baltic was frozen from Gothland to Sweden:</P>
<P>AND in 1423, the ice bore riding from Prussia to Lubeck.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="026892_0007_0FD24B443AA8FBA8"/>
IN the time of Galen, it was observed, that the peach-tree could not flourish in Italy, by reason of the cold of the winter.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Dr. Forster's observations during Captain Cooke's voyage round the world, 1772—1775; page 81.—Henry Home's sketches of the his∣tory of man.—Drs.

See the improvements in agriculture, and introduction of fruits into the Western Empire; and chap. 9, climate of Germany and its effects on the natives in the time of Decius.—Dr. Hunter's Georgical Essays.</NOTE></P>
<P>DURING these periods, most of the kingdoms in Europe were overshadowed by impenetrable forests, and the greater part of the people lived by hunting and plunder. But, after a long interval of mental and moral darkness, when agriculture, with the other arts, were restored, we find no satisfactory account of the progressive melioration of those climates, by clearing the countries of their forests and perfecting agriculture. The solution of this problem is left for the Physicians of America. To effect this de∣sirable object, many ingenious experiments and researches are necessary.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vide Jefferson's notes on Virginia.—Captain Carver's Travels.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT will be useful to make methodical registers of the thermometer, barometer,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">From the history of the barometer, we know, that the weight of the atmosphere is greater at one time than another, in the ratio of one tenth of the baroscopic column of mercury; so great a difference cannot but greatly affect us who are subject to it, seeing it amounts to 3200 lb.

This will require a multiplicity of meteorological observa∣tions; and by experiments with the eudiometer and other chemical investigations, perhaps, it will be found, that the true cause of intermitting fevers, and various other disorders, both epidemic and endemic, is the carbonic

By knowing the nature of the cause, we shall gain much towards effecting a cure of these destructive maladies.</P>
<P>THESE inquiries will also assist the Physician in explain∣ing and describing endemic and epidemic diseases, as well as the diseases of cattle and all sorts of animals. And, as the pathology of vegetables is a most interesting subject in the materia medica, and in husbandry and gardening, the farmer will remember that these studies will extend to the diseases of his fruit-trees, his wheat, his corn, and all the productions of the farm. Will not the farmer then associate his labours with the physician to record useful facts on these subjects? May not these studies enable medical men to ascertain the origin of epidemics with more success and certainty than has hitherto been done? Of how much utility this may be to the commercial and political interests of our country, need not be mentioned before this enlightened audience.</P>
<P>BUT to effect these purposes completely, it will be necessary to be constantly making additions of the best modern publications to the Society's Library, which is already an object of considerable advantage, especially to the junior members. A Library has been called medicine for the mind: A Medical Library is a common bond of union among Physicians, and it renders the acqui∣sition of knowledge cheap and easy.</P>
<P>DR. SIMS, President of the London Medical Society, and an honorary member of this institution, in his observa∣tions
<PB N="10" REF="026892_0009_0FD24B2B3A0AD748"/>
on epidemics, says, that his Medical Library, which consisted of four thousand volumes, was inadequate to furnish a sufficient number of authentic facts, from which an accurate history of epidemic diseases could be made.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Memoirs of the Med. Society of Lond. vol. 1, 1787.</NOTE> This proves the necessity of collecting new facts, at the same time that it shews the usefulness of a common and well-chosen Library.</P>
<P>THE philosophy of the Atmosphere and Winds, so far as they influence health, is an important subject. Which winds are most salutary, and which most noxious? The effects of Evaporation, Rain and Snow, on health, remain to be explained. Is water held in solution in Calorique—is it dissolved in air? Where do our most re∣markable winds begin—and where cease to blow? In what sort of weather, and in which seasons of the year is oxygene gas, or the vital part of the atmosphere, and hydrogene, or inflammable gas,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. CAVENDISH has shewn that this gas is at least ten times lighter than common air: Mr. Lavoisier contends that it is one of the compo∣nent parts of water, and it is by him called hydrogene. It is supposed to afford their principal nourishment to vegetables, and thence to animals, and is perpetually arising from their decomposition.—This source of it in hot climates, and in summer months, is so great as to exceed estima∣tion.—Vid. Dr. Darwin's Botanic Garden▪</NOTE> subject to the greatest increase or diminution? In dry seasons, what becomes of the water taken up by evaporation, and what new combinations take place to produce a condensation and precipitation of water? In attending to this sublime Chemistry of Nature, should we not carefully observe and record electric and magnetic Phaenomena? These are inquiries worthy of the attention of a society of Physicians.

When we discover the nature and relations of phaenomena and facts, we acquire a science. When we apply the result of science as rules of conduct, we practise arts.—Vid.

<P>THE rapid improvements in agriculture, and the increa∣sing commerce of these <HI>States,</HI> constantly bring us acquainted with new articles in diet. The comparative effects of all these, as well as those that have been habitual to the people, ought to be carefully noted and explained.</P>
<P>THE diseases that will probably be produced by manufac∣tures in our country, will become an object of the greatest consequence in a political point of view. It is to be expected that new diseases will be discovered; but of those that are now known among the class of citizens, who are employed in the very useful labors of mechanics, there are many that have not yet found a safe and perfect remedy. As it is probable that most of the manufactures of these states will be carried on by means of machinery, for facilitating the opera∣tions, rendering the productions better and cheaper, and superseding manual labor; the diseases of all sorts of ingeni∣ous artisans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The surprising advances of Chemistry and the effects of its application to manufactures; the wonderful combinations of Chemistry and Mecha∣nics, for the reduction of labour—These are the happy means by which bankruptcy has been hitherto averted.

In many, the ill effects of a sedentary life will be united with the danger that arises from being exposed to poisonous bodies and vapors necessarily employed in the manipulations and operations of art. The substances, therefore, which occupy the labors of the artist, also become objects highly worthy of the study and observation of the Physician.</P>

THE mariner, from the distinguished rank that he holds in modern society, and especially in all commercial nations, deserves great attention from the Physician. Several of the diseases of seamen, and particularly the scurvy▪ have hitherto baffled medicine. The investigation and cure of their diseases remain, in a great measure, for the future labours of medical men. In doing this, many facts may be ascertained for the explanation of that most remarkable property which exists in animal bodies of accommodating themselves to the various condi∣tions of life; such as the changes of climate, heat and cold, diet, action of body and mind, sleep and watching, the healing of wounds and the re-union of broken bones. To the honor of our country it may be said, that a large proportion of the mariners are well instructed, and they have an inquisitive spirit of observation. They can furnish useful hints and remarks that ought to be examin∣ed, because they may lead to useful conclusions.</P>
<P>To investigate the diseases of mankind with success, we must learn to look up to the heavens, as well as down to the earth. The question respecting the effects of solar and lunar attraction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Mead, De Imperio Solis et I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nae.</NOTE> on health, remains yet to be solved, particularly as these effects may influence fevers, hepatic diseases, puerperal medicine, animal secretion and excretion, and the diseases of the mind.</P>
<P>VESALIUS, that great, injured name,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Opera Andreae Vesalii, and Manning's Physiology.</NOTE> was the first author of note who adventured to detect the errors of Galen. In his work <HI>De Corporis Humani Fabrica,</HI> first publish∣ed in 1543, he attempts to prove that the gravity of the
<PB N="13" REF="026892_0012_0FD24B4B936B7F20"/>
fluids contained in the veins and arteries, exerts no manner of effect within them, so far as relates to the principles of hy∣draulics. There are, however, some pathological appearances that favor the supposition that the effect of the gravity of the fluids in not entirely lost, in their living and containing vessels or tubes, particularly in hydropic patients. But, the doctrine of Vesalius has lately been adopted by an ingenious author,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Joannis Brunonis, M. D. Elementa Medicinae. Sect. cvii. cx. Editio prima.</NOTE> who has rejected, entirely, the mechanical philoso∣phy from his system, after it had long been ingeniously defended by Boerhaave and others. There belongs to animal and vegetable bodies, an organization differing essentially from all other modifications of matter. And, to this organization there is superadded a quality, called, <HI>irritabi∣lity, nervous, inherent or contractile Power,</HI> by some; <HI>Excitabi∣lity,</HI> by others, on which the functions of life depend. There∣fore all the supposed analogies, with the innumerable errors thence resulting, between animate and inanimate bodies, ought to be rejected from rational Medicine. On this subject much remains to be done.</P>
<P>IT is one of your professed designs to establish an exten∣sive chemical museum, to contain all the natural productions of this state, that are the objects of medical chemistry. This must necessarily furnish a large correspondence with the non∣resident members, who are gentlemen of learning and inge∣nuity, and being on the places that furnish these productions, much of the honor of perfecting this establishment will fall to them.—Our country is rich in articles of Botany,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>My highly respected friend, Dr. S. L. MITCHILL, Professor of Chemistry and Botany, in the College of New-York, has favored me with a communication containing the following note on a Botanic Garden; and a translation of Girtanner's Theory of Respiration, (vid. page 22.) which are inserted on account of their beneficial aspects on the true interests of our country; as well as for a testimony of my sincere respect and esteem for the virtues and talents of that Gentleman:</P>
<P><HI>"Note on a Botanic Garden."</HI></P>
<P>"The Trustees of Columbia College, have made BOTANY a part of their system of public Education; but, although they have constituted a Professorship, and appointed a Professor, still no provision has hitherto been made for a Botanic Garden. This establishment is so nearly connected with Botany, that the Lectures must ever be very lame and defective without it. Nothing but a more full conviction of its importance and utility, is want∣ing, to set on foot such an institution, and to carry it into effect. A <HI>Botanic Garden</HI> is one of the genteelest and most beautiful of <HI>public improvements.</HI> It comprizes within a small compass, <HI>the history of the vegetable species of our own country,</HI> and by the intro∣duction of <HI>exotics▪</HI> makes us acquainted with the plants of the <HI>most distant parts of the earth.</HI> By facilitating experiments upon plants at this time, when the theory of nutrition and manures is such an interesting desideratum, it may be considered as one of the means of affording substantial help to the labours of the Agricul∣tural Society, and of improving in some degree the practice of modern husbandry. When these things are duly considered, it can scarcely be doubted that Botany will receive a further share of <HI>public patronage.</HI>"</P></NOTE> and our
<PB N="14" REF="026892_0013_0FD24B4D0D4CB190"/>
materia medica might be copiously furnished in America, from all the three kingdoms of nature. A history of these substances, some of which are contained in the unsettled west∣ern territories, is a desideratum in physic; I hope therefore it will not be deemed too enthusiastic to anticipate the happy day when New-York shall boast of its Pharmacopoeia, that shall vie with those of Europe, in its account of new and more successful remedies, effected by the associated labours of this society.</P>
<P>THE investigation of the American Materia Medica,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As a specimen of what has been done in this way, see Materia Medica Americana, potissimum regni vegitabilis. Autore, D. J David Schoepf. 8vo. Erlangae, 1787.</NOTE> would lead us to a better acquaintance with the state of medicine among the Indians; and to a more perfect

knowledge of the antiquities of our country. We shall have more reason to undertake this desirable work, when we advert to what has been said on the subject, by one of the most celebrated writers on the Materia Medica, that this or any other age has produced.</P>
<P>PROFESSOR Cullen did not hesitate to assert, that, the errors of false experience are so numerous, that, the writings on the Materia Medica are for the most part a compilation of mistakes and falshoods. And he adds, that, these errors arise from the obstinacy of old pro∣fessors, and their blind attachment to theory, as well as the vanity of young physicians being the authors of obser∣vations that are hastily made and dressed in the closet; and, besides, many of the operations of nature have been falsely imputed to the effects of medicines pretendedly sound∣ed on experience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the accurate delineation of true and false experience, by Dr. Zimmermann, in his treatise on experience in physic.</NOTE> So distant are they from a true and faithful delineation of nature.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Cullen's Treatise on the Mat. Med. vol. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>AFTER these facts are mentioned, it will be scarcely necessary to enumerate the frauds and sophistications of Chemistry and Pharmacy.</P>
<P>To avoid error, under all these circumstances, would require the hands of Briareus, together with the eyes of Argus—And, how can these evils be removed, but by explaining the materia medica of our own country?</P>
<P>On this occasion, it may not be improper to observe, that by abolishing all <HI>nostrums,</HI> or <HI>secret remedies</HI> in your society, and by making it a sufficient cause of ineligibility to the membership, if any Candidate should hold, use or vend
<PB N="16" REF="026892_0015_0FD24B369F3351E8"/>
any nostrum, you have, in this particular, vindicated the profession from the imputation of quackery. The to∣leration and encouragement of this practice, have, with the enchantments of Mesmer's animal magnetism, and other popular impositions, uniformly been most fertile and dis∣graceful sources of empiricism.</P>
<P>WITH their government, the French have regenerated their medicine, the annals of which have not been stained with blood, like those of their politics; because their war has not been carried on against reason and truth, but a∣gainst error and tyranny.</P>
<P>FRANCE, in her present volcanic state, like fiery AEtna, perhaps, may destroy a Pliny, but, she has however, thrown out many precious substances, that will enrich the world. Among these the <HI>Nouveau <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de Constitution, pour la Me∣decine en France,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See a translation of this excellent work in the Med.

From this plan we learn, that the Medical Society at Paris have exerted the most active vigilance to oppose the dangerous illusions of ignorance; and the nation have decreed, that for the future, <HI>"No Medicines shall be kept secret."</HI></P>
<P>IT remains among the desiderata of the healing art, to shew the advantages that may result to medicine from Electricity; and to determine in what cases and in what manner this powerful agent may be further employed for the advancement of the health and happiness of mankind.

operations of nature. To give a triumph and consum∣mation to the art, requires a complete examination and discovery of its action and effects on animal bodies. In doing this, we have reason to hope, that many of the perplexities that have hitherto embarrassed the doctrines of inflammation and animal heat, as well as several other phenomena of the animal economy will be happily solved.</P>
<P>Is electricity an inflammable fluid, subject to a law of elective attraction? If heat be the oscillatory motion of the minute particles of bodies, wherein does animal and vegetable heat differ from that of inanimate or unorganized<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'Organization, le sentiment, le movement spontané, la vie, n'exist∣ent qu'a la surface de la terre, et dans le lieux exposes a la lumiére. Traité de Chymie par M. Lavoisier.</NOTE> bodies? What are the extremes of heat consistent with animal and vegetable life? What degrees of heat are sufficient to destroy animal, vegetable, mineral, and aerial poisons and contagions? The subject of poisons and contagions opens an immense field for the re∣searches of Medical Philosophy.</P>
<P>IT still remains to determine the full effects of warm and cool bathing, both partial and general, on animal bodies. The baths lately made in this city and its neigh∣bourhood, afford excellent opportunities for experiments in this subject. What are the combined operations of moisture, under different degrees of temperature, motion and pressure▪</P>
<P>IT is now well known, if a person should be immerged two feet under water, and the area of his skin be fifteen feet, he would sustain a weight of circumfluent water, pres∣sing on his whole surface, added to that of the air, equal to two thousand two hundred and eighty pounds. How
<PB N="18" REF="026892_0017_0FD24B31259542F8"/>
will the circulations, thoracic and abdominal viscera, perspira∣tion and the nervous system, be affected by these circumstances?</P>
<P>THE ingenious, but unfortunate Stark, by experiments on his own body, found that the perspiration is almost twice as much, during those hours when the body is naked, as it is in an equal space of time, when covered by our ordinary garments:—By the same clear and decisive expe∣riments, it appears, that the perspiration is not half so great for a given number of hours in the night, when in sleep, as it is for the same number of hours in the day, when awake. These discoveries have yet had very little influence on the practice of physic.</P>
<P>IF we except the discovery of the circulation of the blood, and that of the absorbent system, no modern discovery is more useful than that of the perspiration. Is not this disco∣very to be perfected by future statical experiments?</P>
<P>WE are constantly told, that almost all diseases depend on an increase or diminution of the perspiration; and that cold constantly checks, and heat increases it. Perhaps we seldom know when it is checked, or when it is increased.—In connection, with this subject, will it not be useful to at∣tend to the effects of air and earth-bathing on animals.</P>

medical world, to dissipate the darkness of hypothesis and system, by the most successful application of philosophy and general principles to THE SCIENCE OF LIVING MATTER; and if this author has been more successful in demonstrating that man is nothing of himself, but depends altogether on extraneous causes, and that all his dormant energies must be wakened into motion by these causes, before he can exhibit the phaenomena of sense, perception, thought, reasoning and action; then it follows, that Philosophy, which is the immoveable basis of this doctrine, must be more intimately studied by Physicians than formerly. Hence, all the frivolous objections of some, against this doctrine, that it leads to idleness and super∣ficial study; and all the vain pretensions of others, that a few months of inattentive reading and a little practice, according to this theory, are sufficient to make a good Physician, fall with their authors to the ground.</P>

His subtle genius did discover the nice connections and differ∣ences of animal facts and animal functions: And, his profound and luminous judgment, by long and laborious inductions, led him to conclusions, that, in their ultimate practical effect, must be the source of innumerable evils, or of uncounted blessings to mankind. Are these conclu∣sions true? Let them be acknowledged. Are they false? Let them be confuted. Are they a mixture of truth and error? Let the gold be separated from the dross.</P>

IT yet remains, to determine the advantages that may accrue to Medicine, from a faithful relation of unsuccess∣ful cases. We learn from the writings of CICERO and JULIUS CAESAR, not only the virtues, but also the defects and errors of these personages. Physicians ought not to be unwilling to publish their want of success in the administration of Medicines; for this has hitherto been a department in physic which has been much neglected: Though Hippocrates and some others who have been greater BENEFACTORS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Among the Physicians of this class in America▪ Dr. Z.

It is sufficient to instance the subjects of Digestion and

Respiration. The former has been almost exhausted by the lucid experiments and by the ingenious and successful labours of Stevens, Spallanzani, Hunter, Senebier, and Carminati; and the latter has been happily elucidated by Priestley. Crawford, Lavoisier and Girtanner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>"Mr. Girtanner's Theory of respiration is briefly this:" "During respiration the oxygene-gas of the atmosphere is decompounded. One part of the oxygene unites with the venous blood and changes its dark co∣lour into a scarlet. Another part of the oxygene combines with the car∣bone which is disengaged from the venous blood, and forms carbonic acid gas. A third portion of the oxygene connects itself with the carbone of the dark coloured mucus, which is separated in the branches of the Trac∣hea in considerable quantity; and in like manner turns to carbonic acid gas. A fourth portion of the oxygene, combines with the Hydrogene se∣parated from the venous blood, and constitutes the watery exhalation ma∣nifest in the breath.</P>
<P>"The caloric of the decompounded oxygene gas continues in part with the combined oxygene, and together with it, forms a combination with the venous blood; and hence proceeds the greater quantity of calo∣ric in the arterial than in the venous blood▪ as Crawford has remarked. Another part of the caloric goes into union with the carbonic and gas. A third part of it enters into the formation of the Halitus."—The pro∣ducts of respiration he enumerates are these; 1st, a fluid animal oxyde, <HI>arterial blood.</HI> 2d, Carbonic acid gas. 3d, water. And 4th, a small quantity of uncombined caloric.

<P>THE stomach and the succus gastrious, afford an excel∣lent lesson of instruction. Who would not wish to profit by it in all his enquiries? If we imitate the wonderful operations of the organ so happily explained by the before-mentioned authors, we shall find, that many a bulky volume of hypotheses will pass down the <HI>primae viae</HI> of our minds, without leaving more than a few sentences of useful truth, to invigorate the mind of the Physician in the acquisition of medical knowledge.</P>
<P>THESE facts will soon induce us to believe, that error is the sole cause of the misery of man. That the detection of error is the discovery of truth, is an excellent aphorism. A faithful detail of medical errors, properly managed, would
<PB N="24" REF="026892_0023_0FD24B5EA7F3BCC8"/>
have the happiest effect on practice—It would prevent the misapplication of talents and time, and so facilitate the way to truth. This can no where be done so well as in a Medical Society—For, the truths that are dispersed among various persons, may be here collected and united into one general mass of knowledge, which will enlarge the mind, and regulate the judgment of the practitioners, who having regularly received instructions from particular teachers, are now to consider the ARS MEDENDI as their best teacher—The variety of facts, that each may shew to the other, will prevent partial views, and inspire comprehen∣sive conceptions; thus the judicious Physician, to whom are committed the dearest interests of society, will be enabled to steer his course more safely between the dangerous extremes of dogmatism and empiricism. It is very apparent that this practice must lead indirectly and ultimately to a great improvement in medicine—The collision of mind with mind, ought to strike out some light, and we ought to collect the scattered rays to a focal point, by which some of the darker and more interior recesses of the temple of medical science might, in a future period, be happily illuminated.</P>
<P>IN the present state of society, it is difficult to obtain subjects for facisitating the study of Phisiology and Patholo∣gy. The morbid appearances of dead bodies are examined under great embarrassments—If we unite to demonstrate to the public the advantages of these enquiries, we may hope to obtain the interest of the wise and prudent part of the citizens in favour of these pursuits. Prejudice and feeling are opposed, but reason may do much to remove these obstacles. The best apology that ever could be of∣fered for what has been done in this business is, that <HI>"me are sometimes induced to violate the laws of society to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those of nature."</HI>—But we should reflect, that the laws of

society are a part of the general system of nature, and therefore, they cannot be violated in these instances with impunity.

The liberty of offering a sorrowful homage to their ashes is then a precious right, to delicate minds; and the power of choosing that which their sensations dictate, cannot, without injustice, be taken away."</P>

In the exten∣sive and fertile territories between these extremes, we observe the Mohawk, Senaka and Genesee; next, the in∣tersecting branches of the Delaware and Susquehannah, and then the beautiful ponds, canals and smaller lakes, appear before us. And may we not anticipate the north∣ern and western inland lock-navigation? All these masses of water are situated in a climate that is exposed to the most sudden changes, storms and tempests; and in the winter, to intense cold. Now let us behold the travel∣ler, whelmed beneath the ice, the fragile bridge of his delusive way! Here let HUMANITY come in aid of life and restore the SUFFERER to the bosom of love and gratitude—then will HE wipe the tear of sorrow from the eye of conjugal and filial affection!

<P>IN America we have always enjoyed, what France has lately restored to her Citizens, the union of Medicine with Chirurgery, which constitutes the Healing Art what it was in the Hippocratic Age. To separate the practice of Physic from that of Chirurgery, would be like a disunion of Light and Fire—Medical Surgery is, therefore, highly interesting to the Physician and to the public—Perhaps, it is reserved for the Physicians of America to discover the best methods of preventing or superceding many of the severer operations in surgery—Too much praise cannot be given to the humane, judicious, prompt and dexterous operator. But when will the presumptuous exercise of the bloody scalpel and catlin of Radcliffe and Sigault be suspended? When will their vanity, rashness and pertinacity no longer boast of what is in reality the greatest disgrace of the healing art?

<P>LET the sober, wise and judicious part of the public now determine, how much praise is due to Physicians for investigating and radically curing many of these diseases.</P>
<P>A FEW years ago, it was considered as a kind of daring impiety, for a Physician to attempt the cure of several diseases of the mind; particularly those of the moral faculty. But as long as we believe that men have the power of resisting inclination, and to weigh the motives of action, we need not fear the consequences of trying the full effects of medicines that may operate by physical necessity on man. And, let it be remembered, when Hipparchus undertook to number the stars and trace their motions, his attempt was also derided as impious; because, it was considered as a work that baffled all human labor and observation, and could be done only by the Deity.
<PB N="30" REF="026892_0029_0FD24B6D5CB18CF0"/>
Mark what followed: The labors of Hipparchus enabled Paul, a Florentine Physician,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In 1474, he corresponded with Columbus, on the probability of finding India, in the west. Life of Columbus▪ by Ferdinand Columbus.</NOTE> to make maps and charts, by which he demonstrated to Columbus the globurality of this Planet. All the events in nature are wonder∣fully connected together by infinite wisdom, and conspire to make one complete and harmonious plan of Providence! Had it not been for what has falsely been called the rash im∣piety and enthusiasm of Hipparchus, the old world would never have come to the knowledge of America; and instead of associating together, under a free government, to promote the interests of humanity, most of us who are present would, at this moment, have been the vassals of some European despot, as was once the lot of our persecuted ancestors.</P>
<P>MAY it be the distinguished fortune of some American Physicians, to become in the medical world, what Hippar∣chus and Columbus were in Astronomy and Navigation!</P>
<P>To the praise of America, there is a native of this country, who, by uniting the three characters of Philo∣sopher, Patriot and Physician▪ (need I name Dr. Rush?) has done much towards investigating, explaining and curing many of the mental diseases. But much still remains to be done.</P>

on health and disease. The ebulitions of enthusiasm, with dreams, visions, trances, and all the illusions of the senses, particularly sight and hearing, should likewise engage the serious and careful attention and study of medical men. And, while we contemplate the injustice and impolicy of the slavery of the poor Africans, in our boasted republican and free governments, shall we forget to observe the effects of slavery on the health, temper, genius and cha∣racter of the people, who advocate and practise this trafic and bondage of man?</P>
<P>THE doctrine of the association of ideas is more useful to the Physician, than to the Professor of any other art. Whoever knows how to avail himself of this subject in the practice of physic, may be said to be in possession of a key to unlock many of the apartments of the cabinet of nature. How often, by this talismanic charm, may the morbid condition be changed to the healthful! This was the BRAZEN SERPENT and the TALITHA-CUMI of Dr. Willis, when he cured the King of England.</P>
<P>WHILE medicines are administered to change the dis∣eased action, or to remove the irregular action, to equal∣ize the excitement and to vary its degree, and thus to re∣store health and happiness; we find ample scope for scrutinising the operations of the mind, when we shall often obtain the greatest advantages in changing the train of ideas.</P>

The advantages are too obvious to need any comment. Many of them are of such a nature, that they never can be effected by individuals, but must depend solely on the united labors of societies of active and in∣genious men. Active men, it must be remembered, for all who are not active in these societies, are like negative quantities, which being added to positive, too often make the whole negative.</P>
<P>IN conformity with the design of this Anniversary Meeting, many more particulars might be mentioned, if the time and your patience would permit: Suffice it, to remark, wherever there is organization, spontaneous mo∣tion and life, there are the concomitants of Humanity, Disease and Death; and there are the objects to engage the attention and employ the study of the Physician.</P>

ARE we convinced of the advantages of uniting our exertions to accomplish the useful purposes which have been mentioned? Opposition of pretended interest and partial views will effect nothing. Union, every thing. Wise men are seldom satisfied with their own opinions, till they are confirmed by the suffrages of the rest of mankind. This is the age in which the mysterious quackery of <HI>Abracadabra</HI> ought to be no more; for Dogmatism can no longer trample on Genius and Merit. Let us, there∣fore, be amalgamated together.

<P>AN eloquent foreigner observes, that "union is an irresist∣able panacea against the evils of pertinacity. It is union that composes the understanding and tranquilizes the affections;

she stills the tumult of the passions, she supersedes perso∣nal antipathies, she disenchants the deluded senses, she dissipates the clouds by which truth is obscured, she sheds the rays of distinction on the apostle of truth; he presents her with modesty, he is received without unfa∣vorable prepossessions." Let us, then, unite our labours for the common good of Society: Thus shall we render this Institution useful to the People, and honorable to its Members.</P>
<P>THE patriotic Citizens will give their approbation to an Establishment which has the public health for its object. May we not hope, that, the enlightened Legislators of a free People will give their sanction to its Incorporation?

<P>I AM sensible, many objections are urged against all sorts of Incorporations in a free government. But, these all arise from the effects of the ancient Incorporations being misapplied to the present state of Society. Incorpora∣tions, were invented by the Emperors of Germany, in fa∣vor of the Peasantry, when the Barons▪ or Chieftains, under the feudal system, conspired together, in a formi∣dable Aristocracy, against the Kings. Then it became the policy of Kings to check the encroachments of the Patri∣cians,
<PB N="35" REF="026892_0034_0FD24B7B84645BF0"/>
or Nobles, on the usurped and regal power; and artfully to strengthen and increase this power, which was ever operating the degradation and misery of mankind, by giving, as it was then falsely called, privileges to the Plebeians, or Peasantry, and so defending them against the equally unjust claims of the Barons, in uniting them in the support of Monarchy, which was constantly at war with Aristocracy. In America, there is no Peasantry; but in room of it, a collective and united body of Husband∣men, called THE FREE YEOMANRY. There are more modern Corporations, with peculiar powers, which have ended in monopolies. These, first, fattened on the blood and tears of the natives of the East and West-Indies, and having become enebriated with the sweat, extorted from the slave-wearied limbs of the Sons of Africa, they, afterwards, corrupt Society, with their unjustly accumulated wealth, and destroy themselves. In all those periods, the people were oppressed by an arbitrary Government, which did nothing relative to Medicine; if, you except the despotic decrees of the Parliament of Paris, respecting antimony; and the disgraceful edict of Charles V. to regulate Venefection.</P>
<P>INCORPORATIONS may be reformed, as well as any other political institutions. May it be a part of modern policy to establish certain incorporations, under such condi∣tions, as will check the violence of democracy; and tend, by promoting useful knowledge, to the support, perhaps, to the perpetuity, of elective, free and well-balanced governments.</P>
<P>THE wisest physician<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hippocrates de aere, locis et aquis.</NOTE> of antiquity observed, that the Asiatics were less warlike and more effeminate than the

Europeans. This he attributed, in part, to their climate, but principally, to the form and administration of their governments, which were all despotic and subject to the arbitrary will of their kings. We have the happiness to live under a free government. At this time we scarce need recur to Longinus to be informed, that, <HI>'Liberty is formed to nurse the sentiments of great geniuses, to inspire them with hope; to push forward the propensity of contest one with another, and the generous emulation of being the first in rank.'</HI> Our government, then, must produce great effects, not only on the genius, but also on the health of the people. The former will enable Physicians to observe with accuracy, and future ages will expect that their duty should have impelled them to record with fidelity, THE EFFECTS OF FREE GOVERNMENTS ON THE HEALTH OF THE CITIZENS.</P>
<P>FREEDOM! all-hallowed name! Thou friend of man! at thought of thee, our hearts are warmed with thy celestial fire! Already do we behold a host of thy heaven-descended offspring:</P>

<L>When Bacon, "from the gloom</L>
<L>Of cloistered monks, and jargon-teaching schools</L>
<L>Led forth the true Philosophy, there long</L>
<L>Held in the chain of words and forms</L>
<L>And definitions void,"—</L>

<P>thy victorious benignant hand guided his illumined mind: When he marked out the limits of human knowledge, thou didst inspire him. When Newton, greatest sage! calcu∣lated, thou wast with him. When Baile became the advocate-general of Philosophers, then didst thou give a subtlety and inspire a confidence unknown to man before. When Locke made all the mental world his own, thy friendly genius guided him through all the deep research,
<PB N="37" REF="026892_0036_0FD24B7D06B967B0"/>
and pointed the way to truth. In Milton, immortal name! thou didst teach mankind that disobedience to the will of Heaven is the true cause of all the tyranny and misery in nature. When Clarke and Butler, by moral demonstration, proved to be wildered men the truth of that reli∣gion, first taught in Judea, by Jesus of Nazareth, which carries in its divine bosom, peace on earth and good will to men; thou didst dispel the darkness of superstition. When Raleigh, Ridley, Sidney, Russell and Hamden expired, in sealing the truth with their precious blood, thou, O FREEDOM! didst consecrate their names, in the sacred temples of Virtue, Honor and Fame.</P>
<P>IN thy venerable Rousseau, thou hast pourtrayed all thy charms; by his eloquence hast thou delineated the beauty and power of truth; and by his strength and courage, didst thou substantiate thy choicest blessings. In thy own Voltaire, thy benediction to all mankind was God and Liberty. In him didst thou avenge the cause of humanity and deliver Europe from the yoke of the ancient despotism of Asia: In him didst thou give to truth the sacred impressions of genius; and by his strong arm didst thou shake the disgraceful remains of feudal and gothic vassalage. When Montesquieu and Beccaria restored to humanity, her long lost charms, thy friendly spirit did direct them.</P>
<P>PRIESTLEY, illustrious sage! The fruitless effort to save a sinking realm is his crime: The greatness of his virtues and his sufferings prove the despotism and misfortunes of that nation, whose history his future fame will adorn. He, O FREEDOM! hath fought, successfully fought, under thy holy banners, and broken the fetters of reason. By him, hast thou confounded the blind partizans of antiquity, and demolished the antique pillars of the temple of super∣stition. But, in Britain shall it be said▪ that, Erskine his

friend, and the friend of Paine, can no longer defend the palladium of Liberty; and that he having become the christian victim of the riotous triumph of mad hierar∣chical bigotry, such as would have disgraced the reign of Dioclesian or Nero, must flee his native land. Welcome, thrice welcome, to this western world: thou bringest with thee all the treasures of knowledge of all ancient and modern time. Come and animate the Americans with the amiable example of thy virtues.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This was written after Dr. Priestley had informed several of his friends in America of his intention of leaving England, on account of civil and religious persecution, and fleeing to America, the asylum of those who flee from the Tyrants of the old world.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN Mirabeau, Condorcet, and that bright phalanx of patriots and heroes, arrayed, in the divine panoply of reason, waged successful war against the many-headed mon∣ster, Tyranny, thou, O FREEDOM! didst nerve their mighty arm with more than herculean strength.</P>
<P>THESE are the men whose fame will live forever: These are the benefactors of mankind: their glory will embrace all the future generations of men. Who can stop the progress of their works! What can check the progress of truth! As soon might man stretch forth his feeble arm and say to you bright orb of day, retire and cease to shine.</P>
<P>BUT, what shall we say of the Legislators and Heroes of America? These all uttered their voices, strong as reason and sublime as heaven, saying, <HI>Let America be free, and America was free.</HI> Under the auspices of that freedom, in this Hall, are we now assembled.</P>
