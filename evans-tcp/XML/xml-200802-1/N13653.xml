<BIBL>II CHRONICLES IX.8:</BIBL>
<Q>Blessed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to set the on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God; because thy God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore made be that king over them, to do judgment and justice.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE words were spoken by the Queen of Sheba, of whom honourable mention is made by our Saviour, in that she came from a far country to hear the wisdom of Solomon; who, when she had come and proved him with hard questions, declares, that although the report she had heard of his wisdom and grandeur did far exceed her belief; yet having heard his wisdom, and seen the grandeur and magnificence of his kingdom and attendance, she finds reason to acknowledge that the half was not told her. And upon a view and reflection on these things, she, with wonder and admiration, breaks forth in the language recorded in my text: <Q>Blessed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God; because thy God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice</Q>.</P>
<P>THESE expressions discover an excellent spirit of discernment, wisdom and understanding in this royal female. Although a heathen, yet she acknowledgeth the true God, and expresseth her belief of his governing providence in the affairs of this world, and in disposing of men to places of public trust, power and authority; and with devout acknowledgments ascribes glory to him, saying "Blessed be the Lord thy God," &amp;c.—</P>
<P><PB REF="017236_0005_0FA0B924228ED128"/>THE dignified character of the civil ruler is here also exhibited in its proper light. They sit upon God's throne, and are vested with their authority for the Lord their God. All power is of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Their authority is deri∣ved from him, and is to be used for him: they are his vicegerents, acting by delegated authority from him; for which cause they are some times stiled Gods. Thus she observes to Solomon, that he was seated upon God's throne,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Although there was a special propriety in representing the kings of Israel as seated upon God's throne in that Israel was a Theocracy, yet I can see to impropriety in applying this to civil rulers in general; which I con∣ceive is warranted by the apostle who has said, "the powers that be, are obtained of God."</NOTE> and was made king for the Lord his God.</P>
<P>WE may here also observe the accurate penetration and judg∣ment of this dignified female, in that she not only traceth civil government from its true source, as it is derived from God; but also wisely observes the great ends and purposes to be served by the exercise of that power which particular persons, by the allot∣ments of divine providence, are vested with; which is to do good by the exercise of their authority to those over whom they govern. Men are vested with civil power, not for their own sake; but for the benefit of those among whom they are to exercise their autho∣rity. For thus she observes to Solomon, "that it was because God loved Israel, to establish them forever, that he had made him king over Israel, to do judgment and justice." Those two expressions, "judgment and justice," are expressive of the whole exercise of civil government. Civil rulers are to do judgment, that they may discountenance and restrain all manner of sin and wickedness, by inflicting a proper punishment upon offenders; and they are to do justice by an equitable decision of all contro∣versies which arise between a man and his neighbour.</P>
<P>THUS we have the remarks of a female upon the nature, ends and purposes of civil government: and what pity is it that any who value themselves upon being called <HI>men,</HI> should come behind her in the knowledge of these things; or if vested with any branch of authority, should so fail in the exercise of it, as to fall under the reproof of an old woman!</P>
<P>IT is not necessary to suppose this Gentile queen was directed
<PB N="7" REF="017236_0006_0FA0B9248A2949B0"/>
by inspiration when she uttered these words: it is sufficient to give a divine sanction to my text, that it here stands recorded by an in∣spired pen-man for our instruction and admonition; wherein we not only find the dignity and duty of civil rulers pointed out; but also many motives briefly touched, to excite them to the prac∣tice of it. Their duty is to do judgment and justice. They must do judgment by punishing the vicious, therein rendering them∣selves a terror to evil-doers. As a man can have no right to hurt his neighbour; so neither to hurt himself: whence it appears to belong to the civil magistrate to punish personal as well as relative offences. And they must also do justice, by making equitable decisions between contending parties.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed that the power of legislation is not here so directly spoken of; but yet, as doing judgment and justice is the great and important service which civil rulers are to perform for the community, therefore when they are acting in a legislative capacity, it must be their special care to enact such laws, that the executive authority may be rendered blessings to a people by the due exercises of judgment and justice upon all occasions. Indeed, the kings of Israel seem to have been vested with little or nothing of that power which is of the legislative kind. God himself had framed their laws by the ministry of Moses, not only for their edification as a religious society, or visible church; but also for their good government as a civil state. We have there given us an excellent and truly divine model of civil government, worthy to be imitated by all nations. There laws are but few; expressed in few, but plain terms, easy to be understood. They are for the most part, general rules of equity; and but few special statutes for particular cases. Some few particular statutes in certain cases are given, which might serve as a pattern for the instruction of ex∣ecutive authority, to direct them to the righteous application of the more general rules of government in all particular cases that might arise; which men of interity might easily apply, so as to execute good judgment, and true equity among a people. When legisla∣tive powers essay to frame particular statutes that may be a rule for the executive authority in every case that shall arise, it is necessary that their statutes should be very numerous; which not only makes it more difficult to find men sufficiently acquainted with the law to put it in execution; but also, many times wicked,
<PB N="8" REF="017236_0007_0FA0B926251627E8"/>
designing and crafty men invent ways to shelter evil actions under the letter of the law; or to screen themselves from justice, because the judges are obliged to proceed according to the express terms of particular statutes. Indeed, where civil justice is to be admi∣nistred not by particular statutes, but by the application of general rules of equity, much will depend upon the wisdom and integrity of the judges; which would make it peculiarly necessary in the ap∣pointment of executive authority to practise upon the advice of Jethro to Moses, "To provide out of all the people able men such as fear God, men of truth hating covetousness". Might we de∣pend upon having men of this character for the administration of justice, we might be safe in our persons and properties without such a multiplicity of particular statutes. For a man of an honest heart will, for the most part, readily see how to apply general rules of righteousness to particular cases, so as to do judgment and jus∣tice, without being confined to the express terms of particular statutes.</P>
<P>But whether the affairs of a people are to be administered by the application of general rules of righteousness or particular sta∣tutes adapted to each several case; yet it is of singular moment that civil rulers, in every capacity, should consider themselves as being made rulers over a people for the Lord their God. The apostle Paul agrees with our text and speaks of civil rulers as mi∣nisters of God for good. Rom. XIII 4. They are God's minis∣ters, in that they are to serve him, acting as it were in God's stead, in doing both judgment and justice. It is a manifest inference from the divine perfections that sin shall not go unpunished: and these perfections of the Deity ought to be patterned after by all such as are stiled God's on earth, all such as bear rule among men; that it may be truly said, that they act as his servants, vicegerents, or representatives, in doing judgment upon transgressors. Every well regulated state will make laws to discountenance and restrain vice and immorality of every kind. To be sure this is the case with this state. We have reason to rejoice that our wise and good rulers have from time to time, made good and wholesome laws to restrain the vicious, to put wickedness to shame, and prevent the contagion of evil example from leading others astray. And it is the peculiar province of those who are authorized to put the laws in execution, to render themselves blessings, great and extensive blessings to the people in doing judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017236_0008_0FA0B926CFAFBF40"/>INDEED, such civil officers will meet with many trying cases, in their putting the good and wholesome laws of the land into execution. If they are not men of virtue and integrity, the fear of offending on the one hand, or the hope of making friends on the other, to serve their own private interest, or ambitious views, may prove powerful temptations to connive at breaches of law, or to warp the law aside from its true intention, and frustrate the salutary purpose for which it was made, either by executing so small a punishment as not to render themselves terrors to evil∣doers; or allowing some room for criminals to make their escape from punishment. Or if we allow the judges to be men of real integrity and uprightness, yet the tender feelings of humanity, especially in very criminal cases, may be great temptations to bear the sword in vain, not approving themselves the ministers of God, the avengers to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. But if they are ministers of God, act by authority derived from him, are to pattern after his perfections, and be finally accountable to him for the manner in which they conduct in their office; they ought and must execute the good and wholsome laws of the land in do∣ing judgment and justice. It is true, that although several per∣sons may be found guilty of transgressing the same statute, yet there may be great difference in the aggravating circumstances of the transgressions of different persons; which has given rise to that common proverb, "the severity of the law is cruelty," which may sometimes have too great an influence upon the tender feelings of the judge, inclining him to relax the punishment, to the detri∣ment of the public, whose peace and prosperity often requires the faithful execution of judgment upon the transgressors. But such is our happy civil constitution, that our legislative authority always have a power to relax the penalty to particular persons, where the circumstances of the case, and the public good requires it; so that the executive authority may, with safety and righteousness, pro∣ceed in the execution of the law, leaving all such relaxations of the punishment as any particular case may require, to the proper board.</P>
<P>THE civil peace and prosperity of a community require in the first place, that good and wholesome laws should be enacted, for the distribution of judgment and justice; but if the laws, when made, exist only on paper and ink, what benefit can a people de∣rive
<PB N="10" REF="017236_0009_0FA0B927987EFF00"/>
from them! The divine law is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword; and surely, his ministers ought to make the laws which they execute, bear some resemblance to his, in these respects; which if done, the benefits to society cannot easily be reckoned up: But if those whose office it is to put the laws in execution, instead of giving vigor and efficacy to them, do suffer them to languish and die in their hands; it is not easy to count the evils which must necessarily follow from it.</P>
<P>SUCH officers cloud and darken their own reputation. It is truly an honour put upon a man, to be vested with any branch of civil authority; thereby an opportunity is put into his hands to do the more good in the world, to render himself a more extensive blessing, and merit the honorable esteem and regard of mankind. But yet, if a man doth not honor his office, his office will never honor him. The higher a man is raised in civil rank, the more contemptible will he be in the eye of mankind, if his conduct is not suitable to his station, so as to answer in some good measure, the just expectation of mankind from him, the solemn ties of the oath of God under which he is laid, and the important purposes for which he was dignified. Men may pity, but must despise those who thus betray the trust which the public have reposed in them.</P>
<P>NOR does the mischief flop here; but the law itself becomes de∣spised and contemned, when men find they may transgress without fear of punishment. And while some few laws are thus suffered to be trodden under fear, it emboldens wicked and designing men to disregard all law, to despise government, and trample upon the authority; it opens a wide door to anarchy, confusion and every evil work. And in this case, tho'e become the greatest sufferers, who are most worthy, and most deserving of protection. Men of honestly and uprightness, who make conscience of their ways, are hereby laid open to insult and oppression; while the wicked are suffered to prosper in their wickedness. For if the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do.</P>
<P>AT some periods there is a much greater tendency to anarchy and licentiousness among a people, than at others; and never was there greater danger of these evils, in this land, since the first set∣tlement of it, than now. While these American states were de∣pendent on the British crown, such were the measures of admini∣stration, adopted by the British ministry, and by the King himself,
<PB N="11" REF="017236_0010_0FA0B92873B584B0"/>
that it became necessary for us, in the defence of our just rights and privileges, to rise up in opposition to their proceedings. And although many of those measures taken in the land, were very jus∣tifiable, in that case; yet some of them were not without their bad tendency and effects upon some people's minds. The less judicious part of mankind, who are not so discerning in the pro∣per and necessary measures of civil government, have perhaps, been emboldened to find fault with, and oppose all government. And it is very obvious that one course to be taken, to prevent or remedy evils of this kind, is not to relax the laws; but to carry the reins of government with a steady hand; and that all the good and wholesome laws of the land should be diligently and carefully executed in doing judgment and justice among the people. Greater strictness and severity in the execution of the laws, seems necessary in the present times, to prevent the dangerous and growing evils with which we are threatned.</P>
<P>IT is the anxious apprehension of many, that at present, we have more reason to fear misery and distress arising from that spirit of licentiousness, and that tendency to anarchy and confusion, which seems to be working in the land, than we have from our open enemies. Therefore it concerns every one to guard against, and do what in us lies, to prevent such evils. But it especially concerns civil rulers, whose more immediate care it is to maintain peace and good order, to exert their authority in support of the law, which can be done only by their diligence and <HI>faithfulness</HI> in doing judgment and justice among the people; protecting, sup∣porting and encouraging the virtuous; and frowning upon and punishing the vicious. The virtue of patriotism, at such a day as this especially, ought to meet with all countenance and respect; and on the other hand, the opposite vice of treachery calls aloud for the pursuit of vengeance. Our noble patriotic army, which under God, is our chief bulwark, and the support of every thing dear and valuable to us, ought by no means to be neglected; but should receive all possible support and encouragement. So like∣wise all such friends to the state, which act in lesser circles, ought to meet with support and encouragement; while such as are ini∣mical to our freedom and protection expose themselves to our just indignation. Such as are inimical and treacherous, have acted very different parts in the present day. Some have acted an open
<PB N="12" REF="017236_0011_0FA0B9290C061C18"/>
part, and have gone and joined the enemy; while others have chosen still to continue at home among us; who have been much more hurtful to us, and helpful to the enemy, than those who have gone off, and openly joined them. They, many of them, maintain a secret correspondence with the enemy, give them intel∣ligence, carry on a clandestine trade with them; they lie as a dead weight, throwing every clog and hindrance in the way of all our movements and efforts for our own defence; to them it is princi∣pally owing, that our paper currency has suffered such a great and rapid depreciation; and our land so exhausted of provisions to feed the enemy, as greatly to distress and discourage our own army. Every argument therefore, which will justify us in our opposition to Great Britain, strongly plead for our most vigorous efforts to detect, and make examples of such secret enemies as endeavour to conceal themselves among us. It cannot therefore surely, be sup∣posed, that a civil officer, of whatever rank, whose duty it is to execute the law, should shew more lenity towards a tory, than to a friend of his country; or be, by any means, backward, or inti∣midated from doing judgment and justice in that case, yea, or in any other, wherein the peace and good order of the state are inte∣rested. Nor are there any weighty and powerful motives wanting, to quicken every one to diligence in the duties of his station. Our text suggests several considerations of great weight, to influ∣ence those who are cloathed with authority, to exert themselves in their own stations, to preserve and promote the peace, good order, and prosperity of the people. As</P>
<P N="1">I. THE hand of God is acknowledged, in putting men into their several ranks and offices, in a civil state. Thus faith the Queen to Solomon, "Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delight∣eth in thee, to set thee on his throne." It is the Lord's doing, and his hand is to be acknowledged in it. "For promotion cometh not from the east, nor from the west; but God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another." Whatever methods are used in choosing men, and investing them with authority, yet all is under the controul of the wise and all-governing providence of God. For "the lot is cast into the lap, but the whole dispo∣sing thereof is of the Lord." When therefore men are called into places of public trust and improvement, they are to remember,
<PB N="13" REF="017236_0012_0FA0B929D4E015F0"/>
that the finger of God is in it. Which consideration, if duly at∣tended to, plainly shows a special obligation hence arising, to quit themselves with diligence and faithfulness, in their public trust. Nor are they to look upon the call of God in his providence, which has seated them in places of public improvement, as im∣posing a burthen, but as conferring a blessing, for which, accord∣ing to the example of the queen in our text, God's name is to be blessed. For there is not only an honour thereby put upon a person, but also an advantage for more extensive good and useful∣ness in our day and generation.</P>
<P N="2">II. CIVIL rulers are likewise to consider that their power is the power of God. Our text represents them as seated on God's throne; and put into office for the Lord their God. And the apostle Paul tells us, "There is no power but of God; the pow∣ers that be, are ordained of God." Rom. xiii. 1. God himself is the supreme Governor of the world. But it is his pleasure not to perform the whole of government immediately himself, but to im∣prove his servants, as his instruments, in the exercise of some in∣stances of it. Thus the apostle speaks of the angels of light, as ministring spirits, sent forth to minister unto them which shall be heirs or salvation. Heb. 1.14. That noble order of beings esteem it an honour to be employed in public services, even for the good of mankind who are so far below them. And they are faithful, zealous and very active in it. For we are told that "he maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire." And shall not men, when thus honored and authorised of God, feel them∣selves animated to diligence and faithfulness? They are rulers un∣der God, and are to act in God's stead in doing judgment and jus∣tice in their several ranks and stations. Hence it is that they are stiled Gods. Psalm LXXXII 6. "I have said, ye are Gods, and all of you are children of the most high." If then, civil rulers are put into office that they might exercise this branch of divine au∣thority, and make use of God's power in doing judgment and jus∣tice among their fellow creatures; it surely ought to animate and influence them to diligence and faithfulness in it. And is it not a kind of sacrilege to pervert this divine prerogative to bad pur∣poses? Or even not to improve it to the good ends for which it was conferred upon them?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="017236_0013_0FA0B92A9C9AA1C0"/>III. ARE civil rulers God's ministers? Are they not then, ac∣countable to him for their conduct in that station? Although they are Gods, they shall die like men. Death is the great leveller of mankind, which swallows up all distinctions which have taken place in this life, puts both rulers and ruled upon an equal foot∣ing in the grave, that they may stand in an equal rank in the day of judgment. The great men of the earth will be treated with no more ceremony and respect in that day, by their judge, than the meanest beggar on the dunghill; but every one must give an ac∣count of himself to God, for his improvement of the talents he has received. God's servants here in this life, receive their talents some more, some less; some receive ten, others one; and accord∣ing to their receipts, must their account be. All the solemn scenes therefore, of the day of judgment, and all the rewards and punishments of an incomprehensible eternity, stand before every one, before rulers as well as ruled, as so many motives to diligence and faithfulness in the duties of their station.</P>
<P N="4">IV. GOOD and faithful rulers are represented as expressions of the love of God to a people. It was because God loved Israel to establish them forever, that he sat such a wise king over them to do judgment and justice. Good rulers are a great blessing, and the administration of judgment and justice will be of unspeakable advantage to a people. And when a people are favoured with such, they are to look upon it a token for good, an expression of divine love, and a reason to excite them to bless the Lord. The Queen of Sheba, in our text, though not interested in the prospe∣rity of Israel, blessed God under a view of it. To be a blessing in the world, a blessing in our place, day and generation is a very de∣sirable thing. Therefore when Abraham was sent abroad in the world, that he might be supported and encouraged to duty under all trials and difficulties, God promised to make him a blessing. Gen. XII.2. Those who are vested with civil authority are there∣by put into a capacity to render themselves blessings, great and extensive blessings in the world: but then they are so, only in case of their due and faithful discharge of their public trust. And shall not this be attended to as an effectual argument, and prevail∣ing motive to stir up such to diligence and faithfulness? Can any one bear the thought of being held up to view, and placed in a
<PB N="15" REF="017236_0014_0FA0B92B80E92398"/>
conspicuous station in civil life, that he may appear as an instance of God's anger against a people, rather than as an expression of his love? And be indeed a curse rather than a blessing? No, I would hope better things, though I thus speak.</P>
<P N="5">V. IT is farther implied in our text, that such civil rulers as will do judgment and justice, are peculiarly necessary to the establishment of a state. It was because God loved Israel, to establish them forever, that he gave them such a wise ruler as Solomon was.</P>
<P>THE stability, strength and firmness of a state very much de∣pend upon the skilfulness and faithfulness of its rulers. While good government is maintained, the State will flourish, and make a respectable figure in the world; but when civil rulers neglect their duty, slacken the reigns of government, and are not careful to maintain righteousness and equity; the State becomes fickly and will soon fall into decay. History will furnish us with many ex∣amples of states that have flourished in the world, while regularity, order and good government were maintained in them; but have af∣terwards fallen into disgrace, and crumbled into nothing, through the corruption and perversion of government.</P>
<P>THESE American states are now in their infancy, and but just rising up, and making their appearance in the world; much still remains to be done for their establishment. To this end the war must be vigorously prosecuted; the army be kept up, be suitably provided for, encouraged and rewarded; and our enemies counter∣acted in all their plots and schemes. We have a very powerful enemy to oppose, aided and assisted by treacherous and secret ene∣mies among ourselves; for whose detection and suppression the vigour of law and utmost vigilence and activity of our rulers, seem peculiarly necessary and important. Good government also must be kept up among ourselves; which is the most effectual method to obtain respect, credit and influence abroad. A well establish∣ed state will be a terror to a foreign enemy, and be always ready to make a defence against every attack. There can be no better security against the approach of an enemy, than to be in a well∣prepared state for a defence. And one principal thing in which preparedness for making a defence consists, is to be in a state of peace, regularity and good order among ourselves; which never
<PB N="16" REF="017236_0015_0FA0B92C0C2C5D10"/>
can be the case, without the due exercise of civil government, in the faithful administration of judgment and justice among a peo∣ple. Whether we regard the internal strength, peace and prospe∣rity of the state, or its external honour, respect and influence; civil government must be maintained, good and wholesome laws must be enacted, and life and vigor given them by such as are authori∣sed and betrusted with the care of putting the laws in execution. The safety of the whole state, and the good, the safety and interest of each individual of which the state is composed, loudly call for these things at the hand of civil rulers.</P>
<P N="6">VI. ARE civil rulers God's ministers? Then surely, they may hope for his blessing on them, and presence with them, in the dis∣charge of the duties of their station. Difficulties are to be expect∣ed, and trying discouragements must be encountered and over∣come; wherein we need to attend to every animating consideration; among which, this surely must be of great weight, that "God is with us." Civil rulers are cloathed with authority by God, they are seated on his throne, and employed in his service; and may therefore hope for his blessing to crown their faithful endeavours in the duties of their station. The encouraging hopes of civil ru∣lers in this case are not only warranted from their being God's servants, but they are also much supported by experience, and the manifest tokens of the divine presence, in supporting the cause of truth and righteousness; and especially in the things which tend to the establishment of this, as well as of the other independent states of America. Time will not allow me to enumerate parti∣cular instances; but the over-ruling hand of divine providence has been often so conspicuous in the events of the present war, as to extort a confession, even from infidelity itself, that it is God that fighteth for us; which tokens of the divine presence ought to have a very animating and quickening influence upon every rank and order in the civil state to exert themselves for the establishment, peace and prosperity of the state.</P>
<P N="7">VII. CIVIL rulers have powerful motives to diligence and faithfulness in the duties of their station, from the prospect of a divine reward. Are civil rulers God's servants? Then to him they must look for their reward. No wonder, if in this life, they
<PB N="17" REF="017236_0016_0FA0B92CD7A28980"/>
meet with unkind returns from an ungrateful world; but their labour is with the Lord, and their reward with their God. If they are truly faithful, yet a little while, and they shall receive that blessed <HI>euge,</HI> Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE way for a people to be blessed with good rulers, is to secure an interest in the love of God. It was because God loved Israel, that he set a wise king over them. All our blessings come from God, the father of lights, from whom descends every good and perfect gift. When a people corrupt themselves, abuse their privileges, and yield themselves to their own lusts, to be led away by an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God; they forfeit his favours, provoke his anger, and pull down his judgments upon themselves. God will then curse their bles∣sings, take away his abused favours, remove from them the hedge of his providence, and open the door for a variety of calamities to make inroads upon them. Nothing therefore can be of greater concern to us, both with respect to our temporal and eternal interests, than to secure the favour and love of God. For we have the testimony of the apostle, that "Godliness is pro∣fitable unto all things, having the promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come." And the wise king of Israel, spoken to in our text, also tells us, "That righteousness exalts a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people." God once gave Israel a king in his anger, and took him away in his wrath. If therefore civil rulers do not prove blessings to a people; although such rulers may be highly criminal in not answering the good purposes of their appointment, yet the people ought first to look at home, and remember that it is some God provoking wicked∣ness among themselves, that is the reason why divine providence has not smiled upon them, and given them the blessing of good rulers.</P>
<P N="2">II. WHEN a people are blessed with good rulers, the hand of God is to be acknowledged in it, with praise and gratitude. Even this gentile queen in our text, blessed God on account of his love
<PB N="18" REF="017236_0017_0FA0B92E58380708"/>
to Israel, in setting a wise king over them to do judgment and justice. Good rulers are a great blessing to a people, while they, with diligence and faithfulness, attend to the duties of their station, administering judgment and justice, in the execution of the good and wholesome laws of the land. The benefits thence arising are very great and desirable; which ought to be acknowledged as coming from the same divine Benefactor, who is the bountiful given of all our enjoyments. To him therefore, a tribute of praise and thanksgiving is due from a people thus smiled upon of hea∣ven. This is a favour which carries its bonds of duty along with it; and the people are to express their gratitude for it, not in words only, but in actions; by leading peaceable and quiet lives in all godliness and honestly, under this good and faithful administration of civil government. It belongs to the people to give countenance to, and to support and encourage civil rulers in their administ∣ration of government. This will render the ruler's duty the more easy to him, and the more efficacious and beneficial to others. Yea, this is what people are obliged to do, for conscience toward God; and is one way in which they are to express their praise and thanksgiving to their divine Benefactor for the blessings of good government.</P>
<P>THE public occasion of this day, calls upon me, in a particular manner, to address the important thoughts contained in my text, to the General Assembly of this State now convened. And first to his Excellency our Governor:</P>
<P>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY:</P>
<P>OBEDIENCE to your Excellency's commands having called me into this desk, upon this public occasion; give me leave, sir, to congratulate you for the singular honour God has put upon you, in your early introduction into the chief seat of authority in Connecticut, when it was a colony to the British crown; conti∣nuing you in that seat through the revolution, to this day; and improving you as a very important instrument in his hand, for the establishment of this free State. Although your vigorous efforts, and spirited endeavours in the defence of our liberties and privileges, and for the effectual establishment of this State, are such as merit the esteem and thanks of the public; yet all such
<PB N="19" REF="017236_0018_0FA0B92F086C5B58"/>
among us as wish success to the British arms, look on them with an evil eye; and will therefore, by all means in their power, seek your removal. But promotion cometh not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: God is the judge, he putteth down one, and setteth up another. So long as God has any further services for you to perform, in this public station, your excellency shall sit secure, in this chief seat of government, and as we trust, will use your authority for the Lord your God, and for the good of the State over which you preside.</P>
<P>LET me also address myself to his honour, the DEPUTY GOVERN∣OR, to the honourable members of COUNCIL, and the respectable REPRESENTATIVES of the people, in General Court assembled.</P>
<P>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOURS, AND WORTHY GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>IT is my duty to remind you, as directed in my text, that you are by the providence of God, seated upon his throne, and put into office for the Lord your God. And we encourage ourselves to hope that it is because he hath loved this State, to establish it forever, that he has called you to your several public stations, to do judgment and justice. That you may be the happy instruments of so great a blessing, and an expression of the love of God to this people, it is not only necessary that good and wholesome laws should be enacted, but also enforced by the executive authority of the State: life and spirit, vigor and efficacy must be given them among the people, by proper officers, who will exert themselves, in carrying the law into execution. Such officers are not only to serve the people at large, but they are more im∣mediately the servants of this General Assembly. You have the appointment of them; and therefore reason dictates, that to you they should be accountable for their conduct in their stations.—If there are any who betray their trust, neglect the duties of their station, or act an unworthy part, surely the people may justly expect some remedy, from the Assembly. The first and most effectual method to establish this State, is to establish the influence of law and rule in the minds of the people; which can only be done by giving life and spirit to the law, by diligence and faithfulness in the execution of it. To hold the reins of
<PB N="20" REF="017236_0019_0FA0B92FC70DE880"/>
government with a slack hand, especially in such a day as this, when people are so apt to break over all rule and order, will open a door to many evils which afterwards cannot easily be re∣moved. When men are called up to public view, and ranked in the several stations of civil government, for maintaining order and regularity among a people, an opportunity is given them to become extensively useful; but whether they shall be esteemed as an expression of God's love to a people, or of his anger; whether they shall be a blessing, or a curse, must be made appear by their conduct in their station.</P>
<P>THE people of Connecticut, when they were a government, and now since they have been an independent State, have had reason to bless God that he has placed such upon his throne of civil power, and made them rulers for the Lord their God, as have been happy instruments of our civil establishment, by their wisdom, diligence and faithfulness in doing judgment and justice. And we hope and pray still to continue under the divine smiles in this respect; and that it will appear that God loves this people still, and has it in view to establish us more and more, by giving us such to fill the several stations in the government, as will approve themselves rich blessings by diligence and faithfulness in their several departments.</P>
<P>As a considerable number of Ministers of the Gospel are present in this Assembly, I shall now take the liberty to address may discourse to my brethren, in the sacred character.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI></P>
<P>MANIFEST it is, that it comes within our province, to use our endeavours to promote the administration of judgment and justice among the people of our charge. Indeed, to win souls to a saving union with Jesus Christ, must be the chief and great scope of our labour: but then, it concerns us so to acquit ourselves in the ministry which we have received of the Lord, that we may be able to say, "We have not shunned to declare the whole council of God." All the doctrines of the gospel are to be laid open, that the people may be found in the faith; and the scope and tendency of these truths, for the purpose of holy living, must be urged upon their consciences. To preach morality, is as really preaching Christ, is when we preach articles of faith.—

And as it becomes a good steward of the manifold grace of God, to deal out to every one, a portion in due season; so there are certain times when we have special calls in divine providence, to warn against particular sins; and more especially to urge the practice of some particular duties; which calls of divine provi∣dence may be easily known by all such as duly observe the signs of the times, and the common practice of the people. The great prevalence of iniquity in the present day, is obvious to all men, which is a loud call to us, to cry aloud, and spare not, to lift up our voice like a trumpet, to shew our people their trans∣gressions, and the house of Israel, their sins. And although it belongs to civil officers to execute judgment on transgressors; yet, it also belongs to us to warn the wicked, that they may turn from their wicked ways. It belongs to us, not only to bear testimony against vicious practices; but also, to encourage our rulers in their vigorous endeavours to suppress all vice and im∣morality; and to inforce upon the people due subjection to order and good government; which plainly appears from that special charge of the apostle Paul to Titus, in Tit. iii.8. "This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to main∣tain good works: these things are good and profitable unto men."</P>
<P>LET me finally direct my discourse to the people at large.</P>
<P>You see in the text, that civil rulers are seated on God's throne; they are vested with authority for the Lord their God; and the design of God therein, is to shew his love to a people by their exercise of this authority, in doing judgment and justice.—It belongs therefore to every one, not only to be in subjection to government themselves, but also to support and encourage civil rulers in the discharge of their office. For shall we acknowledge that the administration of judgment and justice is the great bles∣sing which God means to confer upon a people by the ministry of civil rulers, and yet not be careful ourselves to abstain from those vices, and to practise those virtues in which the great and good purposes of civil government are answered? Nor is it enough that we confine our own conduct within the rule of duty; but it belongs to every one to discourage and discountenance all
<PB N="22" REF="017236_0021_0FA0B9316B601C58"/>
vice and immorality in others, by being ready to bear testimony against them that do evil; and giving countenance to good and faithful rulers in the discharge of their trust, in the execution of the law.</P>
<P>To conclude. That we may be blessed with good rulers, it is the duty of every one, to shun those land defiling and God provo∣king abominations which pull down divine judgments upon a people; and earnestly seek to God, that he would shew his love towards us, in placing such upon his throne among us, as shall faithfully do judgment and justice: To enforce this, I shall con∣clude with that apostolic injunction, 1 Tim. ii.1, 2. "I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for kings and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."</P>
