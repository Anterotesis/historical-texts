<P>Where then is our <HI>Courage,</HI> or rather where our Shame! can we <HI>bear</HI> this? then fold up your <HI>En∣sign,</HI> and hush your <HI>Drum,</HI> put off your <HI>Scarlet,</HI> and lay down your <HI>Arms;</HI> and let me leave the <HI>Desk,</HI> with that <HI>first of Lamentations</HI> over <HI>Judah,</HI> when she had destroy'd her self; "<HI>She that was Princess among the Provinces, how is she become tri∣butary?</HI></P>
<P>But let us <HI>recover our Arms?</HI> CHRIST our <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Captain lives!</HI> Of Him it is testified, that <HI>He liveth.</HI> He can <HI>humble</HI> and reform us; respirit, revive and restore us. Of his <HI>Fulness</HI> we may re∣ceive, and <HI>Grace for Grace.</HI> Whatsoever we <HI>ask</HI> of the <HI>Father</HI> in his Name, He will do it. One Day is with Him as <HI>a thousand Years,</HI> and a thousand

Years as <HI>one Day,</HI> Our <HI>Centuries</HI> pass quick, and how <HI>Sovereign</HI> is the Rise and Fall of Families, Cities, Provinces and Kingdoms in every <HI>Cen∣tury</HI> almost! but <HI>Thou art the same, and thy Years shall not fail.</HI> Heb. i. 12.</P>
<P>One <HI>Generation goes</HI> and <HI>another comes,</HI> but the <HI>Word of the Lord endureth for ever;</HI> the <HI>same</HI> to e∣very Generation. This <HI>Word</HI> which by the <HI>Gos∣pel</HI> is preached to us, was also to our <HI>Fathers,</HI> and received by Them with Love, Fear and Reve∣rence. The LORD has commanded it <HI>to a thou∣sand Generations.</HI> We will not <HI>hide</HI> it from our Children, but <HI>show</HI> to the Generations to come the <HI>Praises</HI> of the Lord and his Strength.</P>
<P>Know therefore, that the <HI>Lord thy God,</HI> He is GOD; the <HI>faithful</HI> God, which <HI>keepeth Covenant and Mercy with them that love Him, to a thousand Generations; and repayeth them that hate Him to their Face, to destroy them.</HI> He is the Lord <HI>our God,</HI> his <HI>Judgments</HI> are in all the Earth. <HI>Seek the Lord and his Strength, seek his Face evermore; glory ye in his holy Name. Return</HI> unto <HI>Me,</HI> saith the <HI>Lord,</HI> and I will return unto <HI>you.</HI> Let our Souls <HI>answer,</HI> with the lamenting <HI>Church, "Turn thou us and we shall be turned; renew our Days as of old.</HI> Wilt thou not <HI>revive</HI> us again, that thy People may <HI>rejoice</HI> in Thee! shew us thy <HI>Mercy,</HI> O Lord, and grant us thy <HI>Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>If CHRIST in the <HI>Cloud of Glory</HI> will cover our <HI>Camp,</HI> and dwell in our <HI>Churches,</HI> we shall yet be <HI>safe</HI> and flourishing. But else in vain is <HI>Salvation</HI> hoped for from the <HI>Hills</HI> &amp; Mountains. Worthy is the LAMB to receive <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Riches,</HI> and <HI>Wis∣dom</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> &amp; <HI>Blessing!</HI> JESUS has sent his <HI>Angel</HI> to <HI>testify</HI> of Him in his <HI>Churches;</HI> HE is the <HI>Root and Offspring of</HI> David, <HI>and the bright and Morning Star.</HI></P>
