<HEAD>TO The Flock of CHRIST under my Pastoral Care.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly Beloved,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Importunity, and the Reasons on which it is founded, have prevail'd upon me to publish these Discourses, when no∣thing else could have overcome my Aver∣sion to the Publication of them. I must confess that such a publick Record of the Wonders of GOD's Power &amp; Mercy in your Settlement &amp; Increase to this Time, is but a proper Testimony of Gratitude to your great <HI>Preserver;</HI> and may be of Use to perpetuate the Memory thereof <HI>in your Families, and throughout your Generations, that the Me∣morial of them may not perish from your Seed; but that the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their Children.</HI> With this moving Argument you have obtained my Consent, and so you will clear me of the <HI>Odium of withholding more than is meet.</HI></P>
<P>Having therefore this Testimony in your Hands, you may frequently review it, to see the Dealings of GOD with you and your Fathers, and your <HI>Calling</HI> to <HI>exalt him,</HI> and <HI>trust</HI> in Him. Let it▪ be a Remembrancer to fix in your Minds the Sense of God's <HI>ancient loving Kindnesses,</HI> and your strong Obligations to an∣swer the pious Design of your Transplantation into <HI>this Wilder∣ness.</HI> May those Words of Grace to the People of Israel be remembred and verified unto us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> 2 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>Thus saith the Lord, I remem∣ber thee, the Kindness of thy Youth, the Love of thine Espousals, when thou wentest after me in the Wilderness, in a Land that was not sown: Israel was Holiness unto the Lord, and the first Fruits of his Increase; all that devour him shall offend: Evil shall come upon them, saith the Lord</HI></P>
<P>The uncommon Sufferings and Hardships our Fathers endur∣ed in their wearisome <HI>Pilgrimage</HI> in this Wilderness <HI>to seek a godly Seed,</HI> should endear their Memory to us, alleviate the Pressure of our own Troubles, and obviate all our Complaints. Alas! our Sufferings are not worthy to be compared with theirs, <HI>in the Days of their Pilgrimage;</HI> who were in Perils by Robbers, in Perils by their own Country Men, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the Wilderness, in Perils in the Sea, in
<PB N="ii" REF="004367_0004_10044E1AAF1200C8"/>
Perils among false Brethren, in Weariness and Painfulness, in Watching often, in Hunger and Thirst, in Fastings often, in Cold and Nakedness: Why should we then complain and murmur <HI>that the former Days were better than these?</HI> It is true, GOD may justly complain of us, that <HI>as we have been in∣creased, so we have sinned against him, and that from the Days of our Fathers we are gone away from his Ordinances and have not kept them.</HI> But yet <HI>he has not changed our Glory into Shame,</HI> nor <HI>taken his Kingdom from us.</HI> Our temporal Prosperity and In∣crease is an encouraging Argument that we are still <HI>beloved for the Father's Sake,</HI> and for the Sake of the many Thousands in this Land that <HI>fear God and think upon his Name.</HI></P>
<P>I am sensible of the Darkness and Difficulty with which some of the Affairs of Government are perplexed at this Time; <HI>the Province is in great Affliction,</HI> but yet <HI>we are not in Despair,</HI> so long as <HI>our wise Men that are among us are our Pilots, and rule with GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And the revival of Religion among all Orders and Ages of Persons, and particularly of a public charitable Spirit (which we should all <HI>earnestly covet</HI>) would greatly contribute to ex∣tricate us from all our Difficulties and Dangers: for the Re∣ligion of Jesus consults the Prosperity of the State as well as of the Church; and the Practice of Godliness will serve the great Interest of both. For <HI>the Throne is established by Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Righteousness exalteth a Nation,</HI> but <HI>Sin is the Reproach and will be the Ruin of any People. Thus speaketh the Lord of Hosts, saying, execute true Judgment, and shew Mercy and Compassion every Man to his Brother, and oppress not the Widow, nor the Fa∣therless, the Stranger, nor the Poor</HI> Zech. 7. 9, 10.</P>
<P><HI>Holy Brethren, Partakers of the heavenly Calling,</HI> let my Coun∣sel be acceptable to you, to approve your selves good and use∣ful Members of the State, and shining Examples of Piety in the Church, <HI>praying always, with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, for the Peace of Jerusalem, and seeking its Good, because of the House of the Lord▪ Now the Lord of Peace himself give you Peace always by all Means. The Lord be with you all. You are the Seed of the blessed of the Lord and your Offspring with you▪</HI> I write unto your <HI>Fathers, Young Men,</HI> and <HI>little Children,</HI> and ho∣nestly design the Glory of GOD and our mutual Edification in the Composure and Publication of the following Discourses; humbly beseeching the <HI>God of our Fathers,</HI> and <HI>the God of all Grace</HI> to accompany the same with his Blessing, to make me a faithful Pastor to your Souls, and bless all my Administrations to serve the Interest of our common Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I trust you will cordially accept this Token of unfeigned Love to you, and Desire of your eternal Felicity.</P>

<HEAD>A MEMORIAL OF GOD's Goodness.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ISAIAH LXIII. 7.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I will mention the Loving-kindnesses of the LORD, and the Praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us: And the great Goodness towards the House of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving-kindnesses.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Day compleats a Century since the Foundation of this first and ancient Church was laid. Memorable have been the interchangeable Providen∣ces of God towards it in this Period, as we may well suppose in the pre∣sent mutable State of Things: But it hath survived the various Changes of Time, <HI>according to God's Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving kindnesses. Having therefore
<PB N="2" REF="004367_0006_10044C50E6773AA0"/>
obtained Help of God, we continue unto this Day,</HI> a Mo∣nument of his sparing Mercy under the visible Decays of Piety among us; and have this happy Opportu∣nity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon the Lord's Day when the Administration of the Lord's Supper was attended, and the Church solemnly renewed the original Church Covenant. The Church was gathered on Monday <HI>Sept</HI> 16. 1639.</NOTE> to commemorate and mention the Loving-kind∣nesses and Praises of the Lord, according to all he hath bestowed on us in particular, and his great Good∣ness towards his People in general, in the Dispensati∣ons both of Grace and Providence.</P>
<P>These Words are a devout Meditation and Expression of God's great and unwearied Goodness to his Church, and the Praises due unto him for it. They were spo∣ken either by the Church, or by the Prophet in their Name, and are written for our Learning, and if I mis∣take not, will afford us some pious Instructions and Reflections sutable to the Business of this Day.</P>
<P>Here I shall observe this important Truth as com∣prehending the Sense of the Text, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That it has been the exemplary and pious Care of the Church of God to mention his Loving-kindnesses, and Praises, accord∣ing to all that the Lord hath bestowed on them in the Riches of his Mercy; to make a solemn Mention &amp; Me∣morial of the Riches of the divine Goodness, as indeed the Church of Christ on Earth, the Church Militant <HI>is full of his Riches.</HI> The Words of the Text are very empha∣tical and full to this Purpose; they abundantly express the Memory of his great Goodness, they express the greatest Sense and Acknowlegement of the Church of Israel, for the great Goodness which God had bestow∣ed on them and on their Fathers, according to his Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving-kindnesses.</P>
<P>In discoursing on this Subject I shall endeavour to shew, 1. That it is the Duty and hath been the pious Practice of God's People to preserve and express the Memory of his great Goodness to them. 2. It is also their Duty, and hath been their pious Care to express the Praises of the Lord in Remembrance thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004367_0007_10044DC45833CD00"/>
I. I am to shew, that it is the Duty and hath been the pious Practice of God's People to preserve and ex∣press the Memory of his great Goodness to them. This is the pious Resolution of the Church of God, <HI>I will mention the Loving-kindnesses of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us, and his great Goodness towards the House of Israel.</HI> This supposes a due Commemoration and Sense thereof, and that the Heart is warmed with deep Meditation thereon: For out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth utter∣eth the Memory of God's great Goodness, as the de∣vout Psalmist declares<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm 39. 3.</NOTE>, <HI>My Heart was hot within me, while I was musing the Fire burned, then spake I with my Tongue.</HI> Again,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm 77. 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>I will remember the Works of the Lord; surely I will remember thy Wonders of old; I will meditate also of all thy Work, and talk of thy Doings.</HI> Whereas Forgetfulness of God, &amp; his wonderful Works, robs him of the Glory of an honourable Mention of them; therefore the People of God should take great Care to keep in their Minds the Remembrance of his wonderful Works both to themselves &amp; to the Church, lest they bury any of them in ungrateful Oblivion, and restrain their grateful Acknowlegements of them: So they should refresh &amp; strengthen their Memory by fre∣quent Recollection &amp; Meditation of them; that they may be always ready to mention them to the Praise of God. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. It well becomes the People of God to make so∣lemn Mention of his Loving kindnesses to themselves. <HI>I will mention the Loving-kindnesses of the Lord, accord∣ing to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us.</HI> Every one that is godly will take particular Notice of God's Loving kindness to himself, and be ready to speak of it to the Glory of God.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psalm 66. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Come and hear all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</HI> So should every particular Church and Society of Christians consider and declare what <HI>great Things the Lord hath done for them;</HI> as the Church of Israel celebrates the Memory of God's wonderful Works to
<PB N="4" REF="004367_0008_10044D93D7B79820"/>
them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm 126 3.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord hath done great Things for us, where∣of we are glad;</HI> as in their Plantation-Growth, Preser∣vation, and remarkable Deliverances from manifold Dangers. But how great is the Sum of them! That Declaration of the Psalmist should be often in our Lips<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm 40 5.</NOTE>, <HI>Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful Works, which thou hast done, and thy Thoughts which are to us-ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee. If I would declare and speak of them, they are more then can be num∣bred.</HI> But the more remarkable Instances of God's Loving kindness should be sutably noticed &amp; celebrated by us as we are a Body of People, or a Communion of visible Saints, a Church of Christ.</P>
<P>The planting and settling of Churches is the <HI>Work of the Lord that he may be glorified.</HI> God sends his Gospel into <HI>one Place of his Dominion,</HI> and not into a∣nother, affords to one Nation the Means of Salvation, and not to another, <HI>one Piece is rained upon,</HI> and made fruitful with the Doctrines of Grace and Salvation, <HI>and the Piece whereupon it raineth not, withers and is nigh unto Cursing▪</HI> This is a mysterious Dispensation of the infinitely wise, good and holy God: He giveth no Account of this Matter, but <HI>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when we plead with thee; righteous in all thy Ways, and holy in all thy Works. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</HI> It must be resolved into the divine Sovereignty; <HI>Even so Father, for so it seem∣ed good in thy Sight.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. 11. 25, 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus it pleased the sovereign and only wise God to set up his Candlesticks and cause the Light of the glo∣rious Gospel to shine <HI>in these dark Places of the Earth which were full of the Habitations of Cruelty,</HI> not a Century and half ago▪ This is the Doing of the Lord, and it should be marvellous in our Eyes.</P>
<P>These Churches have abundant Cause <HI>to sing of the Mercy,</HI> the distinguishing Mercy <HI>of the Lord,</HI> in plant∣ing, watering, increasing and defending them to this Time: <HI>If it had not been the Lord who was on our Side,</HI> may these New-English Churches say, <HI>if it had not been the Lord who was on our Side, when Men rose up against
<PB N="5" REF="004367_0009_10044C87CEC956E0"/>
us, then they had swallowed us up quick, when their Wrath was kindled against us. Our Help is in the Name of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth.</HI></P>
<P>We should with the Church of Israel of old set up our <HI>Ebenezer,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 7. 12.</NOTE> our Stone of Help and say, <HI>Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</HI></P>
<P>This Church of Christ in particular should do it this Day, <HI>Set up </HI> a Memorial of the divine Goodness, and <HI>mention the Loving-kindnesses of the Lord, according to all that he hath bestowed on us.</HI> This, this is the Day of the Gladness of our Heart, for <HI>God's manifold Mercies</HI> to us and to our Fathers, and if it be the Day of <HI>our Espousals to Christ</HI> we shall have Cause enough to <HI>rejoyce in the Lord always with Joy unspeakable;</HI> The Lord grant it may be so <HI>in his good Pleasure</HI></P>
<P>This is a very proper Time to recollect, consider and rehearse <HI>what great Things God hath done for us,</HI> as a Church and People, and for every one of us in particular, that we may be sutably prepared, disposed and quickened to praise the Lord for them: Let us not neglect and miss the happy Opportunity, but diligent∣ly improve it to the Glory of God, and to our Fur∣therance in Christian Knowlege, and practical God∣liness.</P>
<P N="2">2. It becomes the People of God to mention his great Goodness towards the Church in general. <HI>I will mention the great Goodness towards the House of Is∣rael, which he hath bestowed on them.</HI> This indeed is a very copious Theme, and who is sufficient to give the sacred History? <HI>Who can utter the mighty Acts of the Lord? Who can shew forth all his Praise?</HI> But it is our Duty, and it should be a sacred Pleasure to re∣volve in our Minds, and declare with our Mouths the wonderful Works of God to his Church in all Ages; tho' we are not able to set them all in order.</P>
<P>The Prophet, or the Church, whoever it is that speaks here, doth not confine the Consideration of the divine Goodness to themselves of that Generation, but gene∣rously extends the Review of it to distant Ages of the Church that were past; and mentions his great Good¦ness
<PB N="6" REF="004367_0010_10044BE1E531CE08"/>
to the Church in general: And indeed there is such a summary of Church History in the holy Bible from the Beginning of Time as may furnish rich Mat∣ter for our delightful Exercise in the Duties of Religion, both for Meditation, Praise and Discourse. <HI>O how great is his Goodness</HI> which he hath bestowed on the Church from Age to Age.</P>
<P>As the Church of Israel were formed and preserved by a Series of remarkable Providences, so God took Care to preserve the Remembrance thereof in several Ways to the latest Posterity. Particularly,</P>
<P>Of their very remarkable Deliverance from the <HI>Aegyp∣tian Bondage,</HI> and miraculous Preservation in the Wil∣derness forty Years, till their Introduction and Settle∣ment in the Land of Cannan. These Things are so full of the Wonders of God's Power &amp; Mercy that they well deserved to be commemorated and acknowleged <HI>in all their Generations,</HI> and indeed in all Ages of the Church.</P>
<P>Accordingly, God commanded his People Israel to transmit the Knowlege of them down to all their Ge∣nerations: <HI>That one Generation might praise his Works to another</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psalm 73 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>. <HI>That the Generation to come might know them even the Children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their Children, that they might set their Hope in God, and not forget the Works of God, but keep his Commandments</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm 44. 1.</NOTE> <HI>We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us what Work thou didst in their Days, in the Times of old.</HI></P>
<P>This was one wise and effectual Method God took to preserve the Knowlege of his Will and Works in the Church of Israel, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> PARENTAL INSTRUCTION.</P>
<P>Moreover, God instituted several Memorials or Mo∣numents of his wonderful Works of Mercy to them. So the Passover was instituted <HI>in Remembrance of his Mercy</HI> in bringing them out of Aegypt, when he <HI>slew all the First-born in Aegypt, a Night to be much ob∣served to the Lord in their Generations.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Exod. 12. 26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>It shall come to pass, when your Children shall say unto you, What mean you by this Service? That ye shall say, It is
<PB N="7" REF="004367_0011_10044E49C8A79F38"/>
the Sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over the Houses of the Children of Israel in Aegypt, when he smote the Aegyptians, and delivered our Houses.</HI> Yea, so great was the Deliverance, that God hath preserved the Me∣mory of it in the Preface to the Decalogue or Moral Law, which <HI>is in these Words,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. 20. 2.</NOTE> <HI>I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt, out of the House of Bondage.</HI> You may observe also, that in the Repetition of the Law of the Sabbath<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. 5. 15.</NOTE>, the Observation of it is enforced upon the Israelites, from the Consideration of that Deliverance, <HI>And remember that thou wast a Servant in the Land of Aegypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty Hand, and by a stretched-out Arm, therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath∣Day:</HI> Though originally instituted in Memory of the Creation.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gen. 2. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Song of <HI>Moses</HI> recorded in <HI>Exodus</HI> 15. is a stand∣ing Memorial of the great Deliverance God gave them by the Destruction of the Host of the Aegypti∣ans in the Red-sea.</P>
<P>Their miraculous Preservation in the Wilderness forty Years, where God fed them with <HI>Manna,</HI> and <HI>gave them of the Corn of Heaven, and they did eat Angels Food,</HI> was commemorated by the <HI>Golden Pot that had Manna,</HI> and was put in the Ark within the Vail<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. 9. 4 Exod. 16 32; &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>In like manner, God was pleased to preserve the Remembrance of his miraculous Work <HI>in dividing the Waters of Jordan</HI> for the Armies of Israel to pass safely through, as on dry Land, by causing <HI>twelve Stones to be taken out of the midst thereof, and set up in Gilgal for a Memorial</HI> forever<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Josh. 4 6, 7.</NOTE> Thus <HI>God made his wonderful Works to be remembred,</HI> his wonderful Works to the House of Israel, in that remarkable Period from their memorable Deli∣verance out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to their Introduction to <HI>Ca∣naan,</HI> which prepared their Way for their future Esta∣blishment and Prosperity.</P>
<P>As God hath had a Church in the World from the Beginning, so he hath taken special Care of its Pre∣servation
<PB N="8" REF="004367_0012_10044C526AAB4B48"/>
and Support: It is built upon Christ <HI>the Rock of Ages,</HI> so <HI>the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</HI> The <HI>Burning Bush</HI> is not consumed. <HI>Many a Time,</HI> may the Church say, <HI>have they afflicted me from my Youth,</HI> yet <HI>they have not prevail'd against me.</HI> The World, the Flesh and the Devil act in Confederacy against it, yet it stands secure against all the Assaults that have been made upon it, from Earth and Hell. The Lord is in the midst of it, its Glory and Defence, <HI>For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a Wall of Fire round about, and the Glory in the midst of her</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Zech. 2. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>Sometimes the Glory of the Church has been made <HI>thin,</HI> and the true Worshippers of God have been <HI>few</HI> in Number, yea <HI>very few.</HI></P>
<P>In the Time of great Declension in the Church of of Israel, in the Days of the Prophet <HI>Elijah,</HI> he veri∣ly thought in himself that he <HI>only was left, and of the People there was none with him,</HI> that <HI>feared God, and thought upon his Name, no not one.</HI> But yet at that Time there <HI>was a Remnant left</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 19. 14 18.</NOTE> "God always pre∣serves a Remnant in the heaviest Judgments which he brings upon his People" <HI>A Remnant shall be saved</HI> in Times of the greatest Defection &amp; Apostacy from the Faith.</P>
<P>So in the Times of antichristian Superstition and Ty∣ranny for several Centuries together, before the dawn∣ing of the Reformation the christian Church seem'd to be buried in the Rubbish; <HI>Darkness covered the Church,</HI> and <HI>gross Darkness the People:</HI> And there was but little Hope of its Recovery and emerging out of that sinking and ruinous State, but then it was <HI>Time for God to work,</HI> with whom all Things are possible; <HI>by whom else should Jacob arise when he is small and without Strength,</HI> to his former Strength, Beauty and Glory? And indeed God raised up some <HI>Confessors</HI> of Christ and his sacred Truths in the most declining and corrupt State of the Church, some of whom sealed the Truth with their Blood;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The learned <HI>Dr. Edwards</HI> in his Answer to that Objection of the Papists <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Protestant Religion is new and upstart,</HI> has given us a Catalogue of the Confessors of Christ and his sacred Truths from the Rise of <HI>Popery</HI> in the seventh <HI>Century,</HI> to the Time of Reformation in the sixteenth <HI>Cen∣tury</HI> Among many other glorious Defenders of the Faith, these that follow deserve a particular Mention: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Bede.

<P>Then in the sixteenth <HI>Century</HI> flourished that eminent Re∣former, <HI>Martyn Luther,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Thus there have been Testimonies against Popery in every Age, and the true Protestant Religion may be fairly vin∣dicated from the Imputation of Novelty.</P></NOTE> 'till at length above two

of it to this Day, so it becomes them to <HI>mention his great Goodness</HI> to it in all the Revelations of his Word and Spirit, from the first and ancient Promise of the Messiah, in <HI>Gen</HI> 3. 15. to the compleating of the sa∣cred Canon <HI>in the Fulness of Time:</HI> By which the People of God in all Ages of the Church have had the Knowlege of his Will, and the Way of Salvation by Jesus Christ revealed to them, more darkly indeed under the mosaick Dispensation, and distant Ages of it, but now clearly and universally by the Gospel, and the Promulgation of it among the Gentiles.</P>
<P>For many Ages the Church was very much confin'd to the Jews within the Limits of <HI>Canaan,</HI> to them <HI>per∣tained the Adoption, the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promises, and of whom as concerning the Flesh, Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever</HI> Thus <HI>he shewed his Word, Statutes, and Judgments to Israel, he had not dealt so with any Nation.</HI></P>
<P>But when Christ the Glory of his People Israel, was manifested to them, in the Fulness of Time, he spread the Knowlege of God and his Grace, <HI>preaching Peace to them that were afar off, and to them that were nigh,</HI> both to Jews and Gentiles: And gave it in Commissi∣on to his Apostles to christianize the whole World of Mankind, and preach the Gospel to every Creature: So the Scripture was fulfilled<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Isai 9 1, 2. <HI>compared with</HI> Mat 4 14, 15, 16.</NOTE>. <HI>The People which sat in Darkness, saw great Light, and to them which sat in the Region and Shadow of Death, Light is sprung up.</HI> And thus Christ is a Light to lighten the Gentiles, as well as the Glory of his People Israel.

<P>The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God in revealing Christ and the saving Doctrines of the Gospel to the Church is <HI>very great; Surely God is good to Israel</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Second SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>HAving in the Morning opened the first general Head, which is to shew, That it is the Duty and hath been the pious Practice of God's People to pre∣serve and express the Memory of his great Goodness to them, I shall now apply my self, by divine Assist∣ance, to shew in the second Place, That it is also their Duty, and hath been their pious Care, to express the Praises of the Lord in Remembrance thereof; <HI>I will mention the Praises of the Lord</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The blessed God is <HI>worthy to be praised:</HI> The Ful∣ness and Glory of his own Perfections shining forth in his Word and Works, challenge the Adoration and Praises of the whole World, <HI>All his Work: shall praise him, and his Saints shall bless him O give Thanks un∣to the Lord, for he is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever.</HI> Worthy is the Lord to receive Blessing &amp; Praise, for all the Displays of his Glory in the Works of Crea∣tion, Providence and Redemption. <HI>Oh that Men would
<PB N="14" REF="004367_0018_10044D33A1570CA8"/>
praise the Lord for his Goodness, and for his wonderful works to the Children of Men!</HI> All the Hosts of Hea∣ven and Earth should join in this divine Service, <HI>Let every Thing that hath Breath praise the Lord.</HI> Thus we see the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised, and his Greatness is unsearchable; <HI>Who can shew forth all his Praise? The Book of Psalms</HI> is full of the high Praises of God, and to mention them <HI>in order</HI> would be to repeat a great Part of it: <HI>Praise ye the Lord,—for Praise is comely for the Upright.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It has been the pious Practice of the standing Church of God to praise him for his Loving kindnesses to themselves <HI>I will mention the Praises of the Lord, according to all that he hath bestowed on us.</HI> The de∣vout Psalmist very frequently calls upon his own Soul, and upon the Church of God to praise the Name of the Lord, for his great Mercies to himself and them. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm 31 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> <HI>Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewed me his marvellous Loving kindness.</HI>—So he invites the Church of Israel to celebrate his Praises,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem, praise thy God, O Zion,</HI> for he hath done great Things for them, both upon temporal and spiritual Accounts as the Psalmist proceeds to testify in the following Verses.</P>
<P>It well becomes every <HI>Soul apart,</HI> every <HI>Family apart,</HI> and every particular <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Congregation apart</HI> to celebrate the Praises of the Lord with joyful Lips, and with sincere Hearts, that is, in the most chris∣tian and gracious Manner, for <HI>whose</HI> thus <HI>offereth Praise, gloriforth God.</HI></P>
<P>Every particular Church of Christ and Communion of Saints, have Reason, more or less, to mention the Praises of the Lord, for his <HI>marvellous Loving-kindness</HI> to them: and they should be ready to this delightful and heavenly Employments and frequently exercise themselves in it: every Member separately, and all the Members conjointly; especially on some solemn Occasions of Recollection and Rejoycing in the Good∣ness of the Lord, such as is this Day, wherein we are celebrating the Memorial of Christ's Resurrection, and
<PB N="15" REF="004367_0019_10044E5CE83C3B60"/>
by a wonderful Concurrence of Circumstances, we are also commemorating the Favour of Christ in the Plan∣tation, Preservation, and Increase of this Church for a Century past. Let us then <HI>say among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great Things for us, whereof we are glad, we will rejoyce and be glad in his Salvation,</HI> for under his Shadow we shall live among the Heathen. <HI>Let us sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed glori∣ously, the Lord is our Strength and Song, and he is be∣come our Salvation; He is our God, and we will pre∣pare him an Habitation, our Fathers God, and we will exalt him.</HI></P>
<P>If we exercise our selves in the serious Considerati∣on and Meditation of God's wonderful Works to us we shall find Matter enough for devout and affectio∣nate Thanksgiving to his glorious Name. Who can refrain himself upon this solemn Occasion? Who can but prophesy? Who is so stupid and senseless as to re∣strain the Praises of the Lord? <HI>The Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up Children; He is our Father that hath bought us, he hath made us and esta∣blished us.</HI> Let it never be said, <HI>Tell it not in Gath,</HI> that <HI>we have rebelled against him.</HI> Such was the shame∣ful Charge God, fastned upon his People Israel, after all his Kindness to them, in 9. &amp; 10 Verses of the Context, <HI>In all their Affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Presence saved them▪ In his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the Days of old, but they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.</HI> Let us take heed lest we fall after the same Example of Disobedience.</P>
<P N="2">2 It has also been the pious Practice of the People of God to celebrate his Praises for his great Goodness to the Church in general. <HI>I will mention the Praises of the Lord, according to the great Goodness towards the House of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them, according to his Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving kindnesses.</HI> Here is an uncommon Fulness and Fluency of Speech, proceeding out of the Abundance of the Heart of the Speaker, to express the extraordi∣nary Kindnesses of God to his Church.</P>
<P>As God has taken Care to preserve the Memory of his Goodness to Israel, in several significant Institutions,
<PB N="16" REF="004367_0020_10044E1C5A9E8F58"/>
so they have in Obedience to the divine Authority ce∣lebrated the Memorials thereof.</P>
<P>Particularly, the Institution of the <HI>jewish Passover</HI> in Remembrance of God's delivering them out of the Aegyptian Bondage, which they observed to the Lord in their Generations, to the Period of the Mosaick oeco∣nomy: When Christ the true <HI>Passover was sacrificed for us,</HI> and instituted the Ordinance of the <HI>Supper</HI> as a sacramental Representation of his Death to be obser∣ved in the Christian Church, to the End of the World, <HI>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lord's Death till he come,</HI></P>
<P>So the Change of the Sabbath was made in Com∣memoration of the Resurrection of Christ, as it was first instituted to be a Memorial of the Creation of the World. <HI>For he that is entred into his Rest, he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. 4 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The jewish Church had many publick Records and Memorials of God's Wonders to them of old, as the <HI>Song of Moses,</HI> in Memory of their Deliverance at the <HI>Red-sea</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Exod. 15</NOTE> The Song of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak,</HI> rehear∣sing the righteous Acts of the Lord, and expressing his Praises for delivering them from the Hand of <HI>Si∣sera</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Judges 5</NOTE> What a publick and grateful Testimony did King <HI>Solomon</HI> give of God's Covenant Faithfulness with the Israelitish Church at the Dedication of the <HI>Temple</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 8, 56.</NOTE>? <HI>Blessed be the Lord that hath given Rest unto his People, Israel, according to all that he promised, there hath not failed one Word of all his good Promise, which he promised by the Hand of Moses his Ser∣vant.</HI> And what is the 136th <HI>Psalm</HI> but a Song of Praise and standing Memorial of God's great Goodness to them, beginning and ending with a solemn Exhorta∣tion of Praise to God? <HI>For he is good, for his Mercy endureth forever:</HI> Which Clause is repeated in every Verse of the Psalm, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> twenty-six Times▪ We read also of the Song of the Church in the New-Testament, <HI>They sung a new Song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof, for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of

every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</HI> So we have <HI>the Song of the Angels, and of the Church, say∣ing with a loud Voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blessing</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. 5 9, 10, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus the Church gives unto God the Glory due unto his Name, and shews forth his Praise from Age to Age: <HI>One Generation shall praise thy Works unto ano∣ther, and shall declare thy mighty Acts: They shall a∣bundantly utter the Memory of thy great Goodness, and shall sing of thy Righteousness</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm 145.</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover, considering that all the Instances of God's Loving kindnesses both to our selves and others, are free and unmerited, we must acknowlege our selves to be under all possible Obligations of Love and Gra∣titude to the gracious Donor of them. <HI>By Grace we are saved: By the Grace of God, we are what we are: Every good Gift, and every perfect Gift is from above.</HI> Thus it is said in the Text, <HI>which he hath bestowed on them, according to his Mercies, and according to the Mul∣titude of his Loving-kindnesses:</HI> This is the true Scource and Fountain of all our Blessings, and we hold all of his free Mercy. <HI>Glory be to God in the highest.</HI> Let us praise God according as we have thought of his Loving kindness, in the midst of his Temple: And such as fear the Lord, will speak often one to another.</P>
<P>I have now finished the doctrinal Part of my Text, and shall now proceed to make some APPLICATION of what has been said: <HI>First,</HI> With Respect to this Church and Congregation in particular. <HI>Secondly,</HI> With Respect to the Churches in this Land in general, ac∣cording to the Direction of the Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Doctrine invites us to mention to the Praise of God <HI>the Multitude of his Mercies</HI> to this Church and Congregation in particular. Let us be constrained to it; let the Multitude of his Loving-kindnesses con∣strain us, and let us not forget any of his Benefits. Let us this Day <HI>remember the Works of the Lord, and his Wonders of old:</HI> And I desire to be your Remembrancer

of these Things before the Lord, to speak of his Glory in his holy Temple, that God may be glorified, and we our selves instructed and comforted.</P>
<P>Now then, Let us look back to the original Planta∣tion and Settlement of this Town and Church, and observe the several Steps of divine Providence in our Rise, Growth and Establishment as it is this Day, <HI>ac∣cording to God's Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving-kindnesses.</HI></P>

<Q><P>Mr. <HI>Wheelwright,</HI> says he, was a noted Preacher of the congregational Way, and so remain'd as long as he liv'd: He was a Member of <HI>Boston</HI> Church, was desir'd by many to be their <HI>Teacher,</HI> with Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> and <HI>Wil∣son,</HI> but the church being to well supplied, the Church by Vote on <HI>Oct.</HI> 30 1636. allowed him to preach to some of their Members remov'd to <HI>Braintree</HI> for the pre∣paring for a Church <HI>gathering there</HI> as the Vote expresses it; Was in the same Sentiments with Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> who in his <HI>Way of Congregational Churches cleared,</HI> expresses a great Value for him, and expresly tells, us tho he gave some Offence in some Passages at the Assembly (which he since upon further Conference &amp; Consideration retract∣ed) yet neither the Church not my self (notwithstand∣ing those unsafe Expressions) did ever look at him either as an Antinomian or Familist: Many of us knew that he had taken good Pains against both &amp; in that very Place where he was wont to preach, that is <HI>Braintree</HI> then a Branch of <HI>Boston</HI> Church.</P>
<P>The State indeed did censure Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> in March 1636. 7 <HI>not for his Opinions</HI> but for a Sermon which they judg'd <HI>contemptuous and seditious.</HI> And in Novemb. following, <HI>disfranchised</HI> and <HI>banished</HI> him for <HI>justifying</HI> the same. Yet <HI>Boston Church</HI> never saw Cause to censure him. But on Jan 6. 1638, 9. they dismiss'd him with <HI>some</HI> others of the Brethren to the Church of <HI>Exeter:</HI> After which he was reconcil'd to the <HI>Court,</HI> afterwards became Pastor of the congregational Church at <HI>Wells,</HI> and in 1662, of the congregational Church at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> where he liv'd in great Esteem to his death in 1679.</P></Q>
<P>It is certain the Proceeding of the Government against Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> and others much grieved and offended many good People in the <HI>Colony,</HI> and some removed to <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> among whom was <HI>William Coddington</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the manificent Donor of our School Lands, which now rent at l.142 from which this Town have reaped great Benefit in good Schools for many Years past.</P>
<P>The good People at <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> quickly sent to the <Q>said Mr. <HI>Wheelwright,</HI> and urged him much to come to them, but he refused their earnest Invitation and Call of him to minister to them: <HI>This cannot be sufficiently re∣gretted.</HI></Q></P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Let us begin our second Century with new and bet∣ter Frames, Tempers and Resolutions than we have e∣ver had; and make it our constant and zealous En¦deavour to express a grateful Sense of the divine Fa∣vours in the Virtues and Praises of a Life devoted O God: <HI>As a chosen Generation a peculiar People, shew∣ing forth the Praises of him who hath called us out of Darkness into this marvellous Light</HI> and Liberty, and <HI>commanding our Children and Housholds to keep the Way of the Lord</HI>—that the Lord may <HI>abundantly bless us</HI> in all our Generations. <HI>I will make thy Name to be re∣membred in all Generations, therefore shall the People praise thee for ever and ever</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psalm 45 ult.</NOTE></P>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>I can't well help inserting here the following Paragraph out of Mr. <HI>Rapin,</HI> which will please the ingenious Reader.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>Charles</HI> Vth's resigning the Empire to his Brother <HI>Ferdinand</HI> he delighted very much in mechanical Curiosities, and particularly had great Variety of Clocks which he tried a long Time to cause to strike exactly together, but could never bring it about; Whereupon he broke out in∣to this remarkable Exclamation; <Q>How vain and foolish is it for Princes to endeavour to make all their Sub∣jects to be of one Mind in Religion, when no Art is able to make a few Clocks strike together.</Q></P>
<P>This was truly a wise Restraction worthy to be inscribed in Letters of Gold, upon the Door Posts of every Poten∣tate and Prince on Earth: And has been established by the Unsuccessfulness of the several Acts of Uniformity, pass'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reigns of the British Monarchs, since the Reformation. And is justified by the present Toleration.</P></NOTE>

It is certain God did great Things and marvellous for our Fathers, in their first Plantation &amp; Settlement in this Country, when it was a Land not sown, and pos∣sess'd by brutish Salvages. Our Fathers saw the Hand and Work of God and <HI>were glad;</HI> and they frequent∣ly met together for religious Conference, <HI>to mention the Loving kindnesses of the Lord, and the Praises of the Lord, according to all that he had bestowed on them.</HI> They spake often one to another of these Things to the Praise of God, and their mutual Edification and Comfort.</P>
<P>And it becomes us also the Posterity of those great and good Men, who <HI>bare the Heat and Burden of the Day</HI> to speak of them with Pleasure and Gratitude.</P>
<P>The Preparation and Room God made before our Fathers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Rev. Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> in his Chronological History of <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> has carefully collected the Memoirs of ancient Things for the Instruction of this and succeeding Generations: A Work of vast Labour and general Usefulness, deserving the Praise and Acceptance of <HI>the Multitude of his Brethren.</HI> And may it please the sovereign God to lengthen our his useful Life, for the finishing this great Undertaking, and farther Services in the Church of Christ.</P>
<P>I shall take the Liberty of transcribing some material Passages from his History to my present Purpose.</P>
<P><Q>Divers Attempts, says he, are made to settle this rough and northern Country: First by the <HI>French</HI> who would fain account it Part of <HI>Canada.</HI> And then by the <HI>English,</HI> and both from meer secular Views; but such a Train of Crosses accompany these Designs of both the Nations, that they seem to give it over as not worth the planning: Till a pious People of <HI>England</HI> not there allowed to worship their Maker according to his Institutions only, without the Mixture of humane Ce∣remonies, are spirited to attempt the Settlement; that here they might enjoy a Worship purely scriptural, and leave the same to their Posterity.</Q></P></NOTE> should be marvellous in our Eyes, and is worthy of a very particular Remembrance; as for In∣stance, in a great <Q>Plague that befel the Natives in <HI>New-England,</HI> which wasted them exceedingly two or three Years before the coming of the English; by which so many of them died, that the living were
<PB N="32" REF="004367_0036_10044E37A04E85E8"/>
not able to bury them, and their Skulls and Bones re∣mained above Ground at the Places of their Ha∣bitations for several Years after.</Q></P>
<P>God hereby testifying that the Iniquity of the <HI>Amo∣rites</HI> was full &amp; that he was making Room for a better People.</P>
<Q><P>So remarkable also was the Providence of God in conducting our Fathers to the Place where they at first sat down,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It was on the 9th of <HI>Nov</HI> 1620. that they made Land, <Q>after long bearing the Sea; and on 31st of <HI>Dec.</HI> follow∣ing, they kept their first Sabbath on the main Land, at the Place now well known by the Name of <HI>Plymouth.</HI> At this Time Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> fixes the Aera of their Settle∣ment here.</Q></NOTE> for it was beside their Design to settle on this northern Shore; being bound to some unknown Country further southward about <HI>Hudsons River:</HI> But by their being guided hither they then unknowingly escaped the greatest Dan∣ger of falling among the Multitude of Salvages at that Time filling the Countries about <HI>Hudson's River,</HI> and were landed in a Place of greater Safety, where God prepared the Way for this feeble Company by thinning the Natives.</P>
<P>And as evident an Interposition of Providence was the extraordinary Restraints laid upon those that surviv'd that were disposed to do hurt to God'<HI>s lit∣tle Flock</HI> in this Wilderness. The whole Number that arrived at <HI>Cape-Cod</HI> Harbour consisting but of 101 Souls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Within five Months Time, above half their Company are carried off by Sickness; whom they account as doing in this noble Cause, whose Memories they con∣secrate to the dear Esteem of their Successors; and bare all with a christian Fortitude and Patience, as extraordi∣nary as their Trials.</Q></NOTE></P></Q>
<P>Thus God was pleased in a wonderful and extraor∣dinary manner, to introduce and settle this handful of People on this strange and distant Shore; and to pre∣serve them alive, and establish them thro' a Series of kind and powerful Providences, in the midst of an in∣finite Variety of distressing Difficulties and Dangers.</P>

We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us, what Work thou didst for them in their Days, in the Times of old: How thou didst drive out the Heathen with thy Hand, and plantedst them, how thou didst afflict the People, and cast them out: For they got not the Land in Possession by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm save them; but thy Right Hand and thine Arm, and the Light of thy Countenance, because thou hadst a Favour unto them.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psalm 44. begin.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Thus God brought a Vine into this Land</HI> from a far Country, <HI>and cast out the Heathen and planted it, he pre∣pared Room before it and did cause it to take deep Root, and it is filling the Land. She sent out her Boughs in∣to the Sea, and her Branches unto the River. Return we beseech thee, O God of Hosts, look down from Heaven, and behold and visit this Vine, and the Vineyard which thy Right Hand hath planted, and the Branch that thou madest strong for thy self: So will not we go back from thee,: Quicken us, and we will call upon thy Name. Turn us again, O Lord God of Hosts, cause thy Face to shine, and we shall be saved.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm 80. 8, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>God enabled our Fathers to do Wonders in their In∣fant-State, both in the <HI>Wars of the Lord</HI> against a bar∣barous Enemy, and in <HI>Works of Piety.</HI></P>
<P>But one of the most memorable Instances of a pub∣lick heroick Spirit in our Ancestors, is the founding the <HI>College</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A General Court held at <HI>Boston,</HI> Sept. 8. 1636. advanced l. 400 towards building a College.</P>

<P>The College was founded in 1639.
