<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantages of a publication of this kind to the practitioner in medicine, are 'tis presumed, too obvious to need enumeration; I shall, therefore, only premise a few necessary observations relative to the work itself.</P>
<P N="1">I. The doses of medicines &amp;c. are set down as for adults; and therefore, the prescriber will easily vary them for other ages. For example, children of two years old may, in general, take about a third part of the doses for adults; or a little more; and so in proportion for other ages, the constitution being also considered.</P>
<P N="2">II. Where it could conveniently be done, I have mentioned the intervals at which the medicines are to be repeated: but these may be varied at the prescriber's discretion. For brevity's sake I have in many places, used the word frequently; by which I would have it understood, that every three, four, six, eight, &amp;c. hours are meant, according to the exigency of the case.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="vii" REF="018456_0005_0FA76D0DF33223E0"/>III. When any particular indication is to be answered, the classes, as cathartics, diuretics, astringents &amp;c. may be referred to; under which heads, as many of the compositions and simples as were judged necessary, are arranged.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The limits assigned to the work would not admit of formulae; nor do I think them by any means necessary. The doses of all the articles usually administered are set down; and I will not suppose, that there is any medical practitioner, who cannot give directions for making them into draughts, boluses, or other forms that may be required. The vehicles should be either perfectly innocent, as pure water, simple syrup &amp;c. or of similar virtues with the medicines to be given. And if two articles of the same virtues, cathartics for example, are employed, it scarce need be mentioned, that the dose of each must be proportionably less. It may be added, that ingre∣dients of a volatile nature should be given in a liquid form, lest their virtues exhale; very nau∣seous ones should, if convenient, be given in the form of pills or boluses.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="viii" REF="018456_0006_0FA76D0E8932DBC0"/>V. In the alphabet I have, for the most part, made use of English names; or at least have referred from those where technical terms are employed.</P>
<P>This work was drawn up originally for my own use, and in the course of practice, I have found it very convenient to refer to occasionally. It was the opinion of those medical Gentlemen who saw the Manuscript that it would be equally useful to others, and this was my motive for mak∣ing it public.</P>
<P>If this work assist the practitioner's memory in matters already known, at least till he has leisure to consult larger works, where necessary, my design is answered.</P>

<HEAD>THE MEDICAL POCKET-BOOK; FOR THOSE WHO ARE, AND FOR ALL, WHO WISH, TO BE, PHYSICIANS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ABORTION.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. Pain in the back, loins, and lower part of the belly; shiverings; a flux of blood from the womb; nausea, anxiety, palpitation of the heart, syncope, an opening and moisture of the os tincae. Most commonly happens between the second and fourth months of pregnancy, though it may occur later. It may be occasioned by frights, falls, strong emetics or cathartics, or by any violent commotion of body or mind.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Bleeding is necessary if the pulse will bear it. The medicines should be of the tonic and sedative kind, as tinct. rosar. or decoct. cort. with tinct. theb. The body should be kept lax with clysters, or otherwise; the diet light broths, and the like; and the patient should be kept very still and quiet in bed.</P>
<P>If, nevertheless, abortion follow, discontinue the corroborants, and give spermaceti medicines with tinct. theb. &amp;c. as after child-birth.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ABSCESS.</HEAD>
<P>TREATMENT. Common abscesses may be treated by bringing them forward with proper cataplasms, and when ripe, opening, digesting, and cicatrizing. Avoid evacuations during the suppuration, unless inflammation require. See also Boil, Phlegmon, and Ulcer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ABSORBENTS.</HEAD>

<HEAD>AGUE.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. The fit begins with cold shiverings; a small quick pulse; pain in the back and head; nausea. To these succeed great heat and fever, which terminate in sweats. The urine dur∣ing the fit, pale, clear, and without sediment; but in the interval, turbid, with a copious sediment of a reddish colour.</P>
<P>In the Quotidian Ague, the fit returns once in a day.</P>
<P>In the Tertian, every other day.</P>
<P>In the Quartan, the intermission is of two whole days.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. First give an emetic, and afterwards a gentle cathartic. If the intermissions are not regular, saline febrifuges should be administred till that objection is removed; then give the bark, in substance, one drachm, every two hours during the intermission, adding tinct. theb. or other astringent if it run off by stool. If the stomach will not bear the powder, give it in decoction, infusion, or the extract in pills. Pulv. fl. chamaem. chalybs. rad. serp. virg. elix. vitr. acid, or the like, may be added according to circumstances. The repetitions may be less frequent after the fit has been missed once or twice. Vitr. caerul. gr. ss. dissolved in one ounce of proof spirit, and given before the fit, had succeeded in some desperate cases.</P>

<HEAD>ANEURISM. Or an enlargement of an Artery. (known by its pulsation.)</HEAD>
<P>TREATMENT. Bleeding, and proper evacuations; with low spare diet. Lead may be bound down pretty tight on the part. If these fail, recourse must be had to the operation of tying it above and below the tumour.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANGINA GANGRENOSA, Or putrid sore Throat.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. Giddiness in the head, alternate heat and cold, and at length, after some hours, constant great heat: sometimes vomiting or purging; pains in the head; eyes inflamed and watery, as in the measles; anxiety, faintness, sore throat, with florid colour; or else, a broad irregular spot, of a pale white colour surrounded with red. On the second or third day the face, neck, breast, and hands swelled, and as if erysipelatous; an efflorescence of many small red pimples sometimes appears on the arms and other parts. The throat sloughs, ulcerates, and is very painful. Offensive taste and delirium towards night.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Avoid bleeding and evacuation, gentle sudorifics excepted; and purging should be checked. Give first a gentle emetic, then medicines with contrayerva and conf. cardiac; or decoction of bark. Gargle or rather syringe the throat with decoct. pect. cum rad. contray. to which, vinegar, myrrh, and honey of roses may be added. If the sloughs do not separate, touch them with a rag dipped in a mixture of mel. aegypt. one drachm, and two ounces of the preceding gargle; or gargle with water acidulated with sp. of salt. To restore the patient give bark and elix. vitrioli, with proper strengthening diet.</P>

<P>SYMPTOMS. A sudden privation of sensation, and voluntary motion. The face red and bloated; the mouth commonly open; the pulse strong and quick, especially at first; respiration strong, and attended with snorting.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Bleed freely, and apply cupping-glasses to the head, neck, or between the shoulders; strong clysters and cathar∣tics; blisters should be applied to the back and legs, and sinapisms to the feet. Medicines of the warm nervous kind, as castor, valerian, camphire, assafoetida, and volatile salts, should frequently be administred.</P>
<P>Authors distinguish between a sanguineous and pituitous apoplexy: The first arising from a turgidness of the vessels of the brain; the last, from serous matter in the ventricles. In the latter case, emetics of the antimonial kind are serviceable, though often hurtful in the former, bleeding should also be prescribed with caution in the latter. A soft, mild, and opening regimen is prescribed for patients subject to the sanguineous, and a contrary one, with exercise, for such as are recovered from a pituitous apoplexy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPETITE Canine.</HEAD>
<P>TREATMENT. If an acid in the stomach be the cause, vomit, and give testaceous powders, magnesia, or alcalis. If worms, give anthelmintics. If it be natural, or proceed from other causes, oils, fat meats, and broths, milk, and flour diet will be proper. Also opiates; smoaking tobacco is likewise of service.</P>

loss of appetite, oppression, flatulency, and frequent eructations. At length the cheeks become red, the eyes prominent, and there is such an anxiety and sense of suffocation, that the patient can only breathe in an erect posture, and can scarce speak or expecto∣rate. If he happen to sleep he snores much; at the height of the fit is desirous of cool free air; sweats about the neck and fore∣head; coughs up a little frothy matter with great difficulty; no fever, pulse extremely small and weak; urine pale and copious; as the fit abates, an expectoration of mucus; the urine becomes higher coloured, and deposits a copious sediment.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. During the fit bleed, if age or weakness do not forbid; blister between the shoulders, or at the pit of the stomach; the body should be opened with gentle cathartics; then give the pectorals and expectorants, joined, if necessary, with antispasmodics and sedatives.</P>

<HEAD>CANCER.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. A round unequal tumour, of a livid colour, sur∣rounded with varicose vessels, and seated in the glandular parts of the body. Some cancers are fixed, others moveable; some pale, others red and inflamed; sometimes they remain harmless for years, at others they increase hastily; ulcerate, and discharge a foetid sanious ichor, and soon prove mortal.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Bleeding; in case of inflammation, cooling laxatives; salt water, extract. cicutae, magnesia, soap or the like, in small doses as alteratives. Externally, apply lint only if the tumour break. Hemlock fomentations have been found serviceable, as hath also the herb called clivers. Calmness of mind and proper regimen must be observed; but extirpation with the knife, where it can be done, is the only certain remedy. For Cancer in the womb, see Womb.</P>

<HEAD>COLIC, Hysteric.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. This is a disease to which women of lax and gross habits, and of irritable dispositions chiefly are subject. It be∣gins with violent pain in the region of the Stomach, mnch green and yellow matter is vomited, and great lowness of spirits succeeds; the pain goes off in a day or two, and frequently returns again in a few weeks with equal violence. Sometimes 'tis attended with jaundice, which in a few days goes off.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Avoid bleeding and purging, unless plethora or costiveness indicate; clear the stomach with warm water, cha∣momile tea, &amp;c. then give a carminative antispasmodic, with opium; (as castor, conf. card. philon. conf. paulin.) which may be occasionally repeated.

<HEAD>COLIC Inflammatory, or inflammation of the bowels.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. A vehement, burning fixed pain is felt in the parts most affected, with heat of the whole body, quick pulse, loss of strength, anxiety aad restlessness.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Bleed largely, and repeat it if necessary, and the pulse will bear it; procure stools with soft mild cathartics, as ol. ricini, oily mixtures with manna, and tart. solub. or the like; or if these will not stay, with pills of extract. cath. and opium; emollient clysters should be frequently given, and soft emollient liquids drank; the bowels should be fomented, bladders of water, bags of salt, or oats heated, the skins of animals just killed ap∣plied to the part; and the warm bath should be prescribed if these prove ineffectual. In case of violent vomiting, give the saline draughts in the act of effervescence; and the pain and spasm, if violent, may be abated with pills of crude opium; blisters may be applied to the part affected; the fumes of tobacco thrown up the fundament in case all other cathartics fail; or give quicksilver.</P>

<P>SYMPTOMS.

<PB N="21" REF="018456_0019_0FA76D1C68F98468"/>
the intestines seem drawn to the spint, with convulsive spasms; the pain continues without remission for several hours together; pulse as in health; no fever, but rather lowness; when at length the pain abates, an odd tingling is felt along the spina dorsi, which extending to the legs and arms, they become weak and paralytic.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Vomit several times with warm chamomile tea, then give opium in pills or otherwise, as also by clyster; the pain and tension being removed by these, give gentle cathar∣tics, such as ol. ricini, infus. sen. with salts, and the like; laxative clysters may also be prescribed; bleed, if the pulse be high; stool being procured, an anodyne, carminative, and anti∣spasmodic may be given, as camphire, valerian, castor, conf. card. or the like, with opium. If the pain return, have recourse again to opium pills; if paralytic symptoms come on, embrocate the limbs and spine with lin. vol. camphorat. or other warm liniment. If convulsions, give musk with opium. After the disorder, bark, with bitters and rhubarb, should be ordered; together with a light, but nutritive diet. Flannel may also be worn round the waist.</P>

<HEAD>DROPSY.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. A collection of water or serum in some part of the body. Before the disorder is perfectly formed it is called Cachexy; when the lymph is accumulated in the cellular membrane it is called Anasarca, or Leacophlegmatia; when there is a collection of water in the abdomen, it is termed Ascites; if in the brain, Hydrocephalus; if in the breast, Hydrops pectoris; if in the womb, Hydrop. Uteri; and if in the scrotum, Hydrocele.</P>
<P>In common dropsies the legs usually swell, and a dent or pit remains for some time after pressing the flesh with the finger: the
<PB N="26" REF="018456_0024_0FA76E5C36554570"/>
appetite abates; the face either bloats or becomes thin and pale; little urine is made; thirst, slow fever, shortness of breath, las∣situde and heaviness; these symptoms obtain especially in the anasarca and ascites. In the hydrocephalus, convulsions, squint∣ing, shunning the light, opening of the sutures, and vomiting of bile, commonly attend, especially if the disease be far advanced.</P>
<P>TREATMENT In the Anasarca and Ascites, purges with Jalap, scammony, calomel, gamboge, elaterium, or the like, twice or thrice a week. Tinct. cupri, tinct. cantharid. sal diuretic. or sal absinth. with bitter infusion. Emetics and sudorifics, blisters and scarifications, prescribed with due caution, have often good effect, otherwise, they may do harm. Bark may be given if the strength flag, or consumptive symptoms appear. Weak liquids of all kinds used to be avoided, but are now allowed freely with success, especially after the drastic purges. In this complaint bread is generally ordered to be toasted, and flesh to be baked, roasted, or broiled. Smoking is of great use, and mustard seeds taken whole have often good effect.</P>
<P>If the disorder ariseth from the too copious use of weak liquids, or obstructed perspiration, sudorifics are much to be depended upon. If from drunkenness, riding on horseback and the use of wine, or rather geneva diluted with water, in moderate quantity, will be useful. If from a consumptive tendency, diuretics, joined with corroborants. If after great loss of blood, or from tedious fevers, cathartics should not be used too freely, but chalybeate bitters should be chiefly relied on. In the Ascites, tapping must be performed, if the methods above recommended fail.</P>
<P>In Dropsy of the breast, diuretics are chiefly to be employed, cathar∣tics only occasionally. Blisters applied below the breast, and even on the thighs or legs and kept open, are also very effectual.</P>
<P>In the Hydrocephalus internus, a salivation excited by mercury has of late been recommended; purges may be given, and medicines of the carminative and antispasmodic kind. Blisters, setons, and issues should also be prescribed.</P>
<P>In the Dropsy of the womb, emetics, stimulating clysters, and occasionally cathartics; diuretic, attenuant, and resolvent medicines should be given; and fomentations and vapour baths advised.</P>
<P>In the Hydrocele, let out the water with the trochar at the bottom part of the scrotum; but when water is contained in the cellular membrane, treat it as an Anasarca.</P>

<P>TREATMENT. Cordials are best during the fit; the body should not be costive; opiates may be occasionally given; the part should be wrapt in flannel, and relaxing or other topical appli∣cations,
<PB N="37" REF="018456_0035_0FA76E6884C7ADB8"/>
as the case may require; a temperate diet, exercise, friction, and the Bath waters; some have ventured to blister the part with success.</P>

<P>It is of more consequence here to describe the symptoms in the dog than those of the patient. We may know the dog to be mad by
<PB N="40" REF="018456_0038_0FA76E6B46CE62C8"/>
his dull heavy look, endeavouring to hide himself; seldom or ever barking; angry and snarls at strangers, but fawns on his owner; refuses all food, droops, hangs down his ears and tail, and often lays down as if going to sleep; this is the first stage.</P>
<P>He now begins to breathe quick and heavy, shoots out his tongue, slavers, and froths at the mouth; looks half asleep; flies sud∣denly at bystanders; runs forward in a curve line; at length he knows not his owner, his eyes become thick and dim, and water runs from them; tongue of a lead colour; grows weak and faint; often falls down, then rises; and attempts to fly at some∣thing; grows mad and furious; the nearer to this state, the more dangerous the bite.</P>
<P>If the state of the dog cannot be obtained, he may be known to have been mad, or the disorder may be known to be this by the following effects, which will come on sooner or later: The bitten part begins to be painful, wandering pains comes on gradually, with heaviness and uneasiness; disturbed sleep, frightful dreams, startings, spasms, sighing, anxiety, love of solitude, pains shoot from the bitten part up to the throat, with straightness, sensation of choaking, and horror or dread at sight of water or other liquids, which is a sufficient characteristic of the disease.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Cut out the bitten part immediately, which is the only certain cure: cupping-glasses should then be applied; cauterize and wash it daily with salt water, or ung. caerul fort, keeping it open with escarotics; bleed, if the vessels be full; vomit with merc. emet. flav. give mosch. to xvi. gr. cinnabar half a scruple (to which camphire and pil. sapon. to vii. gr. may be added) at night, and a purge the next morning; bathe in the sea, or cold bath, and give a sudorific; repeat these for a week daily, and three or four times at the next full and change of the moon.</P>
<P>Ung. caerul. mit. applied externally, and turbith mineral given inwardly, so as to raise a salivation for several weeks, are said to be efficacious, The usual remedy known is now the Ormskirk medicine, but this has failed in a variety of cases.</P>

<P>SYMPTOMS are generally low spiritedness, (the disorder being chiefly in the imagination) heaviness, oppression, and despon∣dency: yet at times uncommon chearfulness and flow of spirits; timidity, anxiety, fear, dread of dying, short cough, difficult breath, flatulency, pale urine, pains in the head, odd fancies, spasms.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Bark, and other tonics; nervous antispasmodics as castor, valerian, assafoetida, &amp;c. attenuants, as volatile salts and spirits; bitters and chalybeats if no fever; emetics, aperients,

<HEAD>HYSTERIA.</HEAD>
<P>In women, are similar to the hypochondriacs in men, but usually more violent, and attended with convulsive fits; which usually come on with oppression at the breast, difficult breathing, a sense of something rising in the throat, which seems to threaten suffoca∣tion: convulsive motions; frothing at the mouth; laughing, and sometimes crying. May be known from a mere syncope by the pulse and breathing continuing, whereas in a syncope they are not perceptible; it also comes on gradually, but a syncope more suddenly; in that, the fit is of short continuance, in this, usually much longer: with a colour in the face, which is not the case in a syncope.</P>
<P>TREATMENT of the disorder itself, as in the hypochondriasis. In the fit volatile foetids, singed feathers, &amp;c. may be applied to the nostrils; and cold water and volatile foetids given. The feet and legs may be placed in warm water; the pure cold air should be freely admitted; cold water may be sprinkled on the face and breast; and if a plethora be indicated, bleed; other∣wise cautiously avoid it. In this disease, particular attention should be given to the state of the menses, &amp;c.</P>

<P>SYMPTOMS.

Tumours at length appear in the groin, armpits: or behind the ears; and then the fever abates, but returns if the tumours sink. Foetid breath and sweat; livid spots, sometimes broad, and suddenly disappearing. Carbuncles arise in the worst state of the disease, which seldom suppurate kindly, but appear as red fiery circles; are small tumours with corrupted flesh underneath, and are attended with great itching. The symptoms, however, vary according to the constitution and state of the air, but these are the most general.</P>
<P>TREATMENT.

<P>TREATMENT. If necessary bleed, and purge with elect. e scam∣mon. sena, &amp;c. Pulv. doveri, or other anodyne sudorific, may be given.

It is however, distinguished into Sea and Land Scurvy.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. In the Sea Scurvy, the juices are disposed to putridity from the use of animal food, and moist air; antisep∣tics therefore will be proper, as vegetables, vegetable acids, fruit, cyder, &amp;c. infusion of malt, in defect of these or liquors made of molasses or sugar. Bark, and elix. vitr. acid. are good. Liquids impregnated with fixed air for common drink, and wholesome air.</P>
<P>The Land Scurvy, (improperly so called) is rather a cutaneous disease; scurfy or scabby eruptions appear, either partially, or more universally; often with itching and heat.</P>
<P>The antimonial alteratives, with gentle mercurials, are often effi∣cacious; aq. calcis composit. succ. scorbutic, or the like, may be used with them.

<HEAD>SMALL-POX.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. Chilliness, shivering, heat, pain in the head and back, sickness and pain at the stomach, and sometimes vomit∣ing; fever, costiveness, convulsive fits sometimes in children, which is a good symptom. On the third or fourth day the eruption appears, like flea-bites, in the face, breast, arms, body, and feet successively; pains and soreness in the throat. The eruption being compleated, the fever goes off or abates. The eruptions fill, or maturate like boils, and the skin between them is also red; the eye-lids, face, hands, and feet, swell successively; the pocks from red, grow whitish and smooth in the body, and yellow and rough in the face, full of a white matter. About the seventh day from the eruption, (sometimes the ninth) they dry, or turn as it is called, and scale off, leaving red marks, and sometimes pits behind.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. If the pulse be full and strong at the beginning, bleed; and if necessary, or the period be sufficiently early, purge, and give an emetic. During the eruptive fever, cooling febrifuges, with laxatives, or clysters occasionally; but if the symptoms require it (as low pulse, &amp;c.) gentle cordials and diaphoretics. After the eruption, little is generally required but a gentle anodyne at night, proper diluents, and if necessary, opening clysters, &amp;c. If purging come on, check it with caution; if delirium or fever, apply blisters; and if the pock sink, give bark, with proper diaphoretics and cordials; especially if malignant or putrid symptoms, or petechiae appear. Spt. vitrioli dulcis is also good in these cases, as are sinapisms to the feet.</P>
<P>In the confluent kind, all the symtoms are worse than in the distinct. The eruption makes its appearance a day or two later, and does not come to its height till the eleventh or fourteenth day after; the fever also continues after the eruption appears, and a sali∣vation comes on, which must by no means be checked. The patient requires to be supported more in this case than in the other; care, however, must be taken in both kinds to avoid too much heat, or a heating regimen; and pure, and even cool

air, where no objection appears, is salutary. If the pustules are opened, and the matter let out, so much the better; especially if danger of their sinking or striking in appear. Purging is esteemed proper after this disease.</P>
<P>To inoculate for the Small Pox, take a little matter from a pustule, after the eruptive fever, on the point of a lancet, and insert it in the arm (by making a small puncture or two) between the true and scarf skin, which may afterwards be pressed down with the slat side of the lancet. Three or four days afterwards the punctures appear inflamed; in about three days more the pre∣cursory symptoms come on, and at length the eruption.</P>
<P>Previous to the inoculation, a mercurial purge or two may be administered, if the patient is of a full or gross habit; and he should also be restrained to a milk and farinaceous or vegetable diet, avoiding especially high seasoned food. It is found best to keep him out of bed, and even now and then in the cold air. The symptoms are generally so favourable, that little assistance is required from medicine, except a few mercurial purges after the disorder goes off.</P>

<HEAD>VENEREAL Disease.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. A few days after an impure coition, a titillation about the glans penis; heat and pricking pain in making water; then a discharge of matter from the urethra, at first whitish, and in small quantity; afterwards yellow or green or even reddish, and more copious. If it be suffered to proceed, inflammation and excoriation follow; painful erection or chordee. Sometimes phymosis (or an inability of drawing the skin back over the glans.) paraphymosis, (or an inability of drawing the skin forward so as to cover the glans,) swelling of the testicles, chancres, bubors, scabby erup∣tions, nocturnal pains, nodes, carious bones, ulcers in the throat and nose, &amp;c.</P>
<P>TREATMENT, In the beginning, bleed, if nothing forbid; and give a cooling purge, a small dose of calomel, merc. calcinat. or other proper mercurial, every night; and nitre, with gum arabic, and some gentle lenitive, several times in the day; repeating the purge occasionally. If these are not judged sufficient, a small quantity of ung. caerul. fort. may be rubbed into the thigh or leg every night. The parts should be kept clean by washing them with warm milk and water. This course should be persisted in till the virulence is subdued, after∣wards a few cooling purges; and bals. capiv. with astringent, or other injection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, if gleet or ulcer remain, will usually be sufficient.</P>
<P>Buboes are generally advised to be dispersed with ung. caerul. fort. but if they are advanced, they should be brought forward by proper suppuratives, opened and digested thoroughly off, which is usually attended with the most salutary effects. Abscesses in perinaeo, should, if possible, be dispersed.</P>
<P>Chancres may be anointed with ung. caerul. fort. after washing them with aq. phagedaenic. For the Hernia Humoralis see T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ti∣cles. see also Phymosis.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="018456_0067_0FA76E925999DD10"/>When the disorder is a Confirmed Lues, we should either salivate, or at least keep the blood for some time highly charged with mercury; for either of which purposes calomel, or merc. calci∣nat. &amp;c. should be given inwardly; and half a drachm or a drachm of ung. caerul. fort. rubbed every night into the thighs. In short, the whole dependence must be on mercury for destroying the virulency, other remedies being only had recourse to occa∣sionally, according to the symptoms that arise. Thus, inflam∣matory symptoms are to be removed by bleeding, purging or other proper medicines; ulcers, abscesses, &amp;c. should be treated as required in such cases; but the disease which is the cause of these should be principally attended to, and when that is subdued by a proper mercurial course, the other symptoms will either disappear, or may be removed by requisite methods. A Gleet, for example, will sometimes remain after the disorder is cured; and must be treated with corroborants, and, if necessary, astrin∣gent injections; the cold bath, and a strengthening diet.</P>

If from spasms, the saline draughts, and proper opiates; medicines of the nervous class, joined with laxatives; and, if necessary, a blister to the back. If from inflammation, bleeding, cooling diluents and febrifuges, as the saline draughts, with proper laxatives; and anodynes at discretion. If from weakness of the stomach, bark, bitters, or other corroborants; premising a vomit if judged necessary. Chalybeate waters are also proper. If the stomach be sore, as it is termed, the bals. traumat. spermaceti, or other balsamics, are good. In vomitings, the best form of medicine is pills.
