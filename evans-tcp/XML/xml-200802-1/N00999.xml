<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Nehemiah IX. 33.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Howbeit, thou art Just in all that is brought upon us: for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT there is a certain and most exact Providence of God, over all the Affairs of Man-kind in this World, from the highest unto the meanest and most minute, inconsidera∣ble things, and all the circumstances of them; is a truth so great, so plain and obvious, that it is agreed upon both in Reason and Religion; as may be gathered from the Apostles quota∣tion, Act. 17. 28. <HI>For in him we live and move and have our being</HI>—: It is true also that the Mysteries of Common, but especially of special Pro∣vidence, are so great, so deep, so wonderful and sometimes so amaze∣ing, that men are fain to stand still, and say as in <HI>Job</HI> 11. 8. <HI>It is as high as heaven, what canst thou do? deeper then hell, what canst thou know?</HI> And 'tis at no time more so than in the way of God's Judgments, and most of all when his own People are the Subjects of those Judgments; then oft times there is occasion to Repeat and Ruminate upon that Excla∣mation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 33. <HI>How unsearchable are his Judgments and his Ways past finding out!</HI> But, be the Premises of this kind what they will, we must alway obstinately hold fast that sure Conclusion, <HI>Psal.</HI> 36. 6. <HI>Thy Righte∣ousness is like the great mountains; thy Judgments are a great deep:</HI> or else we shall make Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience in these great deeps. And in this Chapter wherein our Text is; We may observe the method and pains which <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and the Godly <HI>Jews</HI> with him, take for the clearing up, and establishing of this Conclusion, as 'tis laid down in our Text. This <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did unto that poor afflicted People answer his name; the Comfort or the Rest of the Lord: For in that cri∣tical
<PB N="2" REF="001193_0004_0FB0FEB2920937D0"/>
and troublesome Juncture, much of their Comfort and Rest from the Lord, was conveyed unto them by his instrumentality: he was the Instrument of procuring for, and settling among them, the revival of their former precious and pleasant things in a great degree, after the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity.</P>
<P>He was by birth a <HI>Jew;</HI> by quality a Courtier belonging to the Em∣perour of <HI>Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reatest Monarch in the World; by office the Go∣vernour of the <HI>Jews</HI> his Brethren; by Precession and Practice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d zealous▪ Servant of the true God; he was a man of most Excellent Spirit, retaining and maintaining▪ a firm and stedfast integrity, an in∣violate, unstrain'd and exemplary fidelity to his God, his Religion and his Country; all temptations, entanglements, and enchantments of the Court, he had been so long Conversant in notwithstanding; and served and was accepted of his Prince in serving his God and his Country, set∣ling and strengthening of them in Church and State, managing with a prudent, pious, gracious and successful Conduct, for more than fifty years. And herein join'd in a most sweet, happy and satisfactory una∣nimity with them, with the Rulers, with the Priests, with the Levites, and the Rest of his Brethren.</P>
<P>In Prosecution of which in this Nineth Chapter, he and they do so∣lemnly and publickly take notice of the Scheme of Gods wayes unto that People, and their wayes unto him; and do Alternately touch upon some of the main points of both, from their beginning unto that time: Until at length in this 33. <HI>v.</HI> the words of our Text, they come unto and fix upon, a very▪ solemn Vindication of the Name of God; by asserting his Justice in all his Judicial proceedings against and dealings with them, together with a close Animadversion upon themselves.</P>
<P>The Words may be look't upon under a threefold Consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. Either as a brief, summary, but sad and sorrowful Recapitulation, and Representation of their own Lamentable Estate, and the ill terms they were in with the Lord their God,—<HI>In all that is brought upon us</HI>—God had brought many and dreadful things upon them, which they had now the fresh and lively sense of.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or as an humble and penitential Confession of their own Sins, a∣gainst the Lord their God; an holy, and just, and good, and gracious God; they do with shame of face and grief of heart confess; That tho' God had been very sharp and severe with them, yet they were them∣selves the only Culpable and procuring Causes of all.—<HI>For we have done Wickedly.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Or as a testimonial Vindication given in, and to be left upon Re∣cord for God; to clear him and his Cause, in the whole Controversy between him and them.—<HI>Howbeit thou art Just.</HI>—There are then two Branches of the Text.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="001193_0005_0FB0FEB3AD6F12B0"/>
1. A Justification of God, with respect unto his Judgments inflicted upon his own and only People, the People of <HI>Israel:</HI> And this argued from his Works, and in particular from his Works of Judgment, which they had been the Subjects of. <HI>Howbeit thou art Just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right: q. d.</HI> Be the Case how it will with us, and indeed it is bad enough, sad enough, and dreadful enough, as to things past and present, and dismal presages there are for the future; yet we must and do, freely and openly Justify the Lord our God, in and under all▪</P>
<P N="2">2. A Condemnation of themselves; with respect unto their own Sins; their Condemnation is argued from their Works, and their Works of Iniquity.—<HI>But we have done wickedly;</HI> it is in plain, full, downright termes, without any extenuation, or mincing the matter. So that the Doctrine which results from hence is this.</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>That although the Judgments which God brings upon his own Sinning People, are very many, and exceeding great; yet He is most Just in all of them.</HI></P>
<P>They do in our Text make a plump and full acknowledgment of this Truth: when the Case between God and themselves comes to be considered, they do before the whole World, Heaven and Earth, give in clear and full evidence to this Truth, however it does reflect upon themselves; that God is most Just in all his Judgments upon them; and by parity of reason, the like testimony must be given for him, with respect to his proceedings against any other such people of his own, whom he shall visit with his Judgments as he did them: And indeed this is a ruled and settled Case: The Prophet is express and ample in his at∣testation hereto. Dan. 9. 14.—<HI>For the Lord our God is Righteous, (or Just) in all his Works; i. e.</HI> in his works of Judgment upon his own People; for these are the works which the scope of the Text is directed unto. Also that is very pertinent and pregnant for the Confirmation of this Truth which is given in and recorded, <HI>Ezra</HI> 9. 18.—<HI>O Lord God of Israel thou art Righteous.</HI> Speaking of his Judgments which had overtaken, and taken hold of that Sinning People of the Lord. This Doctrine consists of four single Propositions.</P>
<P>PROPOSITION <HI>I. That God's own People may be a very Sinful People.</HI> This People of the <HI>Jews</HI> were God's own and only People; they were so by common Estimation, by Profession, and by solemn Covenant-Transaction, they had Avouched the Lord for their God, and God had Avouched them for his People; and yet they were a very Sinful Peo∣ple: So it may be with any other People of God in this World: they may be so really, not rightfully; there's no allowance for them to be
<PB N="4" REF="001193_0006_0FB0FEB531E2A910"/>
so, but there's certain experience that they are so. It was observed by the Wise man of old, <HI>That there's not a Just man upon the Earth that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not:</HI> And this is a very forcible way of proving this Position which he had then undertaken the demonstration of. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 8. 46. There are al∣ways Sins of Infirmity in the best persons, and in the best people in this World; but they are Sins of Enormity and gross Iniquity which are here spoken of: for they must be such, to bring a People of God under the just denomination of a Sinful People; and they are truly &amp; properly a Sinful People, when they are a Degenerate People, fallen off from God, from what they profess and pretend to be; sometimes have been or by Covenant are bound to be; <HI>When they are turned into the degenerate plant of a strange Vine unto God,</HI> Jer. 2. 21. When they have lost their piety towards God, their equity, honesty, charity and morality towards men; and the contrary, impiety, prophanity, im∣morality and vitiosity take place instead thereof; and this becomes their common and epidemical case: As 'tis said to be, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. 5, 6. <HI>The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint;</HI> and they make a trade of Sin, and are accustomed unto Sin, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13. 23. they commit Sin as if it were their business, <HI>Hos.</HI> 10. 13. <HI>Ye have plowed wickedness.</HI> When 'tis so with a People of God, they are then a very sinful people: And that God's own People may become such is evident, not only from what the Holy Scriptures tell us others have been, but from what experience tells us we our selves are. A lively and graphical Exemplification of this aw∣ful truth, we have this day in our selves.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That manifold and dreadful Judgments are the Proper, and will be the certain portion of God's People when they are become a very Sinful People.</HI> If God's People become a depraved, deformed, degenerate sinful people, they must fall under the Severities of God's Judgments. <HI>Judgment must begin at the House of God,</HI> 1 Pet. 4. 17. and they are severe Judgments, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 19, 20. <HI>Do they provoke me to anger, faith the Lord? do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces? Therefore thus faith the Lord God, Behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground, and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</HI> These Judgments of God, are all those penal evils which are inflicted by God in a way of judicial proceeding; and whatever others do, God's own Sinning Peo∣ple besure shall not escape; <HI>Ames</HI> 3. 2. <HI>You only have I known of all the fa∣milies of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</HI> And there is an unparallel'd Severity in the Judgments of God upon his own Sin∣ning People; there is no Severity in this World like it, unless it be that of the <HI>Sword of the Lord against the Man that is his fellow:</HI> thus much is
<PB N="5" REF="001193_0007_0FB0FEB66B00E558"/>
implyed in our Saviours words, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. 21. <HI>For then shall be great tribu∣lation, such as was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>That these manifold and severe Judgments, they are God's Judgments.</HI> All penal evil is from God, as the supream, principal effi∣cient cause of it, <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 6.—<HI>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> Deut. 32. 39. <HI>See now, that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me; I kill, and I make alive: I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand,</HI> Isa. 48. 7.—<HI>I make peace and create evil:</HI>—Be the Instruments and Second Causes who &amp; what they will, God does plainly and peremptorily ascribe and appropriate Judgment unto himself as his: <HI>Isa.</HI> 37. 26. <HI>Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass:</HI>—God is the Author who does appoint &amp; inflict these Judgments; and he is the orderer and manager of them in the measures, steps and progress thereof, from first to last, even to the least circumstance and accident thereof: <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 30. <HI>But the very hairs of your head are all num∣bred.</HI> The Judgment of all persons is from the Lord, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29. 26. <HI>But every mans judgment cometh from the Lord.</HI> The Judgment of all Nations is from the Lord, <HI>Hab.</HI> 3. 6. <HI>He stood and measured the earth: he beheld and drove asunder the nations:</HI> And therefore it must needs be true concern∣ing the Judgments which come upon his own People. This might be made illustriously evident, by a particular consideration of the Judg∣ments which were inflicted upon the Jews in their Captivity; they were all of them the Lords Judgment, as to kind, time, degree, instruments, extent, duration, issue, effects and consequents thereof; this is fully tho' briefly expressed and asserted, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 21. 12, 13. <HI>Therefore thus faith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem &amp; Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem, as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. IV. <HI>That God is most just in all these Judgments of His.</HI> Tho' they are upon his own People, and are very many, and very great, yet God is most just or righteous in all of them: He is truly and su∣perlatively just, or which is the same thing, Righteous in them all; in appointing and inflicting, ordering, continuing and issuing them, in all the parts, articles, circumstances and punctilio's of them, from first to last, from beginning to end; He is absolutely, perfectly, inviolably and infinitely just and righteous. What's said of the Judgments of his mouth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 9. <HI>That they are righteous altogether;</HI> does suit &amp; quadrate well with the Judgments of his hands. The Heavens make known
<PB N="6" REF="001193_0008_0FB0FEB921AD9118"/>
this, <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 6. <HI>The heavens shall declare his righteousness.</HI> The Angels proclaim his Righteousness, <HI>Rev.</HI> 16. 5. He is fixed unchangeable and immoveable, as a Rock in regard of his Righteousness, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 4. <HI>He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he.</HI> He is universally and everlast∣ingly so, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89. 14.—<HI>Justice and Judgment are the Habitation of thy Throne.</HI> This is a sure uncontroulable conclusion, tho' men can't al∣ways see how to draw it out of the premises. This made the holy Prophet say, <HI>Jer.</HI> 12. 1. <HI>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy Judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the Wicked prosper? Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?</HI></P>
<P>This Justice of God it is not his Essential but his Relative Justice; whereby he gives unto all his Creatures that which does belong unto them. For as he is just in himself, in his own Nature, <HI>Isa.</HI> 45. 21.—<HI>A just God.</HI>—Altogether just, and most just, even Justice it self; so he is just in all his works and doings to his Creatures, and therefore in his Works of Judgments to his People: He renders to them those Judg∣ments which do of right belong unto them, according to a Rule of Justice; and the Rule of Relative Justice, it is the Will of God. God originally owes nothing to his Creatures, therefore that only is their due which he Willeth unto them, that Will of his therefore is the Rule of moral Justice. The Will of purpose it is the Secret and Everlasting Rule of this Justice; His Will of Precept 'tis the Written Rule of this Justice: And his Law considered as a Covenant, as 'tis under the Sancti∣on of Promises and Threatnings, is the Rule according to which his own People may expect he will dispense Justice unto them, in the way of his Judgments. Against this Rule there is no exception to be made by us; no not against his Judgment of eternal Condemnation upon the Re∣probate who perish, being Reprobated according to the Will of God; for their eternal Reprobation, and so their Condemnation it is according to this righteous Rule of Justice between God and man▪ therefore the blessed Apostle does with a disdainful detestation reject the very thoughts of impeaching the Justice of God, in the Reprobation of them that are according to Scripture Phrase, <HI>hated of God;</HI> as it is Written, <HI>Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteous∣ness with God? God forbid.</HI> The Argument to prove it follows: <HI>For he faith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have Mercy, and I will have Compassion on whom I will have Compassion,</HI> Rom. 9. 13, 14, 15. And it is added to close all,—<HI>and whom he will he hardneth,</HI> 18. v. However impudent∣ly and unreasonably, and in defiance of the whole Scope of the Argu∣mentation, some would understand the Apostle of Temporal Judgments of this Life, thereby to Enervate the Decree of Reprobation. And if
<PB N="7" REF="001193_0009_0FB0FEBA6F00D258"/>
this Judgment of God be so uncontrolably Just, because it is according to, and the product of his Will; much more may we, and <HI>must</HI> we con∣clude that all those Judgments spoken of in our Text and Doctrine; even the Judgments of God upon his own People, are most Just: for they are the accomplishment of his Decree, which is altogether Just; The Execution of his Law which is most holy, just and good: And the fulfilling of his Covenant in the just threatnings thereof, which are put thereinto; <HI>if his Children forsake my Law, and walk not in my Judg∣ments; if they break my statutes and keep not my Commandments: Then will I visit their transgressions with the Rod, and their iniquity with stripes:</HI> And these are the Judgments of God upon his own People, in which He is most just.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> Hence we may infer, that there is an absolute necessity of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, to make Peace with God for us. When the Justice of God is offended and provoked to proceed in a way of Vengeance, which is the work of provoked Justice, inflict∣ing Judgment upon the Sinner, there's nothing to be justly expected, but the just ruin and utter confusion of those, who by their Sins have drawn it forth, unless there be an Atonement made: So God speaks. <HI>A fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. I will heap mischiefs upon them, I will spend mine arrows up∣on them. They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction:</HI> Deut. 32, 22, 23, 24. And this Vengeance will not be recalled, unless the Anger of God cease; and this Anger will not cease, unless provoked Justice be atoned; and Justice will be atoned only by the Satisfaction and Intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ. If there be no Satisfaction, &amp; so no atonement made, the Justice of God will take satisfaction by distraint upon the Sinner, which way of satisfaction we are fore-warned to take heed of. <HI>When thou goest with thine adversary to the Magistrate: as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayst be delivered from him, lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.</HI> Luk. 12. 58, 59. There's a way of reconciliation made known in the Gospel by Je∣sus Christ. <HI>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself,</HI>—2 Cor. 5. 19. And as this is the way of atonement for persons, so it is for peo∣ples also. God of old directed his people to this way. <HI>Gather your selves together, O Nation not desired: before the decree bring forth:</HI>—<HI>Seek ye the Lord.</HI>—<HI>Seek righteousness,</HI> &amp;c. Zeph. 2. 1, 2, 3. The Lord Jesus Christ is the only hiding place for a people from the Storms of God's Anger.<HI><PB N="8" REF="001193_0010_0FB0FEBBC7B3E0C8"/>
Isa.</HI> 32. 2. <HI>And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a cover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the tempest:</HI> This was the Sacrifice which of old was for the Con∣gregation; which we read of, <HI>Numb.</HI> 15. 25.—<HI>for all the Congregation.</HI> Mr. <HI>Ainsworth</HI> reads it, for every <HI>Congregregation,</HI> for every <HI>Tribe,</HI> and for every <HI>City,</HI> and for every <HI>Synagogue</HI> in the Land. We have need of an Atonement for every Congregation, for our Rulers in their Congrega∣tion, for our Courts in their Congregation; for our Ministers and for our Churches in their Congregations; for our Towns, for our Col∣ledge and Schools in their Congregations; and for our Souldiers and Military Forces in their Congregations. And there is no other Sacri∣fice of atonement, for every, or for any Congregation, but only the Lord Jesus Christ. So that there's necessity of him for our Atonement.</P>
<P>There's a necessity of the Lord Jesus Christ to appear and stand be∣fore God for us; for we have sinned in every Congregation, and Sin∣ners cannot stand: <HI>If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Lord, shouldest mark iniquity, O Lord, who should stand,</HI> Psal. 130. 3. There is no person, nor Congregation of persons a∣mong us, but would be afraid, and dread to appear before this holy, just and righteous God in their sins; they would cry out, as we read, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 76. 7. <HI>Thou, even thou art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</HI> There is no standing for us before God. <HI>He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</HI> Hab. 1. 13. If we should offer to stand before him, whether it were in a way of opposition or supplica∣tion, it could come to no other than what the Lord speaks of, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27. 4. <HI>Of setting briers and thorns,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>which he would go through and burn up together.</HI> But our Lord Jesus Christ he can stand for any, and for e∣very Congregation of us. Therefore,</P>
<P>There is a necessity also that he should stand for us, to speak on our behalf as an Advocate; He is the only Advocate whom we can rely upon, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2. 1.—<HI>And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Fa∣ther, Jesus Christ the righteous.</HI> We have a necessity of a Friend in the Court of Heaven, to speak for us before the just and holy God, or there will be no hopes of an Atonement.</P>
<P>And there is a necessity for the Lord Jesus Christ to offer up to God an acceptable Sacrifice for us; without a Sacrifice there is no Atone∣ment; and there is no other Sacrifice but Blood, which will atone any unto God, and 'tis only the Blood of Jesus Christ that is of any value in this case: And this is of an alsufficient and infinite value; <HI>it is the Blood of God,</HI> Acts 20. 28. <HI>And this will cleanse from all sin,</HI> 1 Joh. 1. 7.</P>
<P><HI>USE II.</HI> Hence we may make this deduction; That it is our great present and indispensable duty to justifie the Lord our God in all his proceedings against us. We read in <HI>Isa.</HI> 26. 8. of the way of
<PB N="9" REF="001193_0011_0FB0FEBE9B6B0718"/>
God's Judgments towards his People. As 'tis with a Body natural, crazy ill-habited Bodies, are fain to be put into a way of Physick, or there is no hopes of them: A single dose will only irritate their Mala∣dies, and so make them worse. So 'tis with a Sinful People of God, as they are a Body Politick; the Great and All-wise Physician rather than lose them, he will put them into a way of Physick: God has long been in a Way and Course of Judgments with us; these are his Physick: under the prescriptions and directions of his Word, many a bitter and dreadful Dose has he exhibited unto us; many a Cup of trem∣bling has He mixed for us: And is, like a wise and considerate Artist proceeding from those Medicines which are more gentle and easy, unto those that are more strong and potent; as if He would at length come to the use of such as will certainly kill or cure; mend us, or end us. Thus <HI>He i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Way of His Judgments:</HI> now we should remember He is <HI>most Just,</HI> and accordingly Justify him in this Course and Way of his Judgments. There are many left alive and now among us, who can remember the beginning of this Way of Gods Judgments, which He has setled us under, and which we should Justify him in. We are Gods own People, and I suppose, it may truly and not improperly be said, in some great respects, that we are the only People of God in this quarter of the World. That has been in some remarkable manner accomplished upon us, which was spoker, of Israel of old, <HI>Lo, the People shall dwell alone, they shall not be reckoned among the Nations,</HI> Numb. 23. 9. And that also, <HI>Chap.</HI> 24. 9. <HI>Blessed is be that blesseth thee, and cursed is be that curseth thee:</HI> they generally have made broken undertakings of it, in the end at least, who have attempted any thing against Gods Israel in this Wilderness; this lonely corner of the Earth. We have many a broken <HI>Leviathans Head</HI> by us to shew. But yet we are become and are a very sinful People. The Lord may say justly of us, <HI>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Ass his Masters Crib; but Israel doth not know, and my People doth not consider. Ah Sinful Nation, a People laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that are corrupters, they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of Israel to anger, they have gone away backward,</HI> Isa. 1. 3, 4. We are become an ignorant, inconsiderate, corrupted, corrupting, backsliding, provoking People. This we have many a time had full and undeniable Convicti∣on of, divers Ways, and especially on such occasions, as the present is; the Servants of the Lord, whom he hath sent to us to speak in his Name, in this Place, by an induction of particulars, they have caused us to see the Word of the Lord. That we may say, <HI>as for our Sins, we know them.</HI> And we are a very afflicted People, our whole Land is so from one end of it to the other; tho' some places and parts of it more than others, at present: but it may soon be as bad in all places as 'tis in any; for God

has done by us, as he speaks, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 7. 24. <HI>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the Heathen upon them:</HI>—God has brought the very worst of the Hea∣then, the Antichristian Heathen upon us; a People whose Consciences are debauched with Popery. It may e'en be said of our Land as we read in <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</HI> 3. 7. <HI>I saw the Tents of Cushan in great affliction, and the Curtains of the Land of Midian did tremble.</HI> It is a very trembling and dreadful con∣sideration to think, What God has done, and in the way of his Judg∣ments is doing against his own, his only People, his acknowledged and dear People; his People between whom and Himself there has been so much Love, so great kindness, such intimate acquaintance, and sweet communion for so long time; yet we must justify him in all, and say as the <HI>Jews</HI> here do, <HI>Howbeit thou art Just in all that is brought upon us:</HI> in the whole Scheme of Judgments which we are under: This is our great present and universal duty; it is the Work and Duty of the whole Representative body of the Country, in all orders and degrees of Per∣sons, in Church and State. And to do it this day, even this day; which though it has been wont to be a Great Day, a Festival Day, a Day of Joy and Gladness; and though we do enjoy those good things to this Day, which do afford us matter of Joy and thankfulness: yet upon ac∣count of the just Judgments of God, and his heavy hand upon us, his near and dear People, who have been to him as the <HI>Apple of his Eye:</HI> upon account of the, I fear, irreparable breach, between him and us, We have just cause to make it a day of Lamentation and Mourning; and to justify God in all. I would not under-value the Mercies of our great and good, and long suffering GOD; nor the favours of the Queen our Sovereign, which though undeserving, we yet enjoy. But I fear the Talent of Lead, is hastning to be shut down upon the Ephah of our Wickedness, as the expression is, <HI>Zach.</HI> 5. 7. I mean that our Sins are hastening to their full measure: and when the Vessel is full the Cover is shut down upon it; and when the measure of our iniquity▪ is filled up, we shall be concluded under the Wrath of God: yet let us Justify God, for we must either justify or recriminate, and condemn him; and to charge and rise up against him, would be to add Rebellion to our Sin; as he was taxed for doing, <HI>Job</HI> 34. 7. Which would be an unanswerable affront to the Majesty of Heaven, an arrogance in the Exaltation of it, <HI>Job</HI> 40. 1, 3, 4, 17. But rather, <HI>Let us give glory unto God, even the glory due to his Name,</HI> Psal. 29. 2. And this will be done by giving him the glory of his Justice, or Righteousness, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by getting and possessing our selves with real, clear and deep apprehensions, and sense of this Justice or Righteousness of God. And by making an open, free, ingenuous, pa∣thetical, emphatical Confession of it to the Glory of God: And thus of late His EXCELLENCY, the COUNCIL and <HI>General Assembly,</HI> have
<PB N="11" REF="001193_0013_0FB0FEC0EAB011F0"/>
expressly, solemnly, publickly and seasonably, in their Printed Decla∣ration, <HI>Given Glory unto God.</HI> And in our Publick Days of Humiliation, we have professed, to joyn in the same thing; and wherein we have professed to take Shame to our selves, and thereby to justify God. So we have done in all FASTS and HUMILIATIONS, or else we have not observed them unto the Lord, but been guilty of their Sin, <HI>Zach.</HI> 7. 5. Thus we should still Justify him.</P>
<P>In Particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Justify Him in all the Evils and Errors which we have fallen into.</HI> It is the property of man to err; now however Sinful, Shameful or Mise∣rable our Errors have been, or our selves by reason of them, yet God is to be Justifyed in all of them. Though it is the guise of Sinful and E∣vil men, and too much ours, to take notice of the Errors and Evils of others, so as only to blame, and shame, and reproach, and vilify them for the same, so as to be alienated from, despisers, and haters of those that fall into Errors; and too little to remember and regard the hand of God in it: and to say at least practically, as the Enemy does, <HI>The Lords hand hath not done all this,</HI> Deut. 32. 27. As if there were no Judg∣ment of God in all of it. Whereas 'tis indeed a most severe and sore Judgment of God, especially when the Chief among a People fall into Sins and Follies; the Heathen observed this, <HI>Delirant Reges plec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untur Achivi.</HI> And the Scriptures testify to it. God is angry with <HI>Israel</HI> and then <HI>David</HI> must be left unto, and be obstinate and unmoveable in, the folly and sin of numbring the People, as 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24. 1. <HI>God was angry with Israel and Zedekiah both;</HI> and then he is left to refuse and reject the Counsel of the Prophet, tho' most faithful and agreeable. <HI>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord</HI>—<HI>for thro' the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out of his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the King of Babylon,</HI> 2 King. 24. 19, 20. These were the sore Judgments of God upon them. And we have had our Errors and Evils; our Sins and Follies, both Personal and Publick: yet we may say with respect unto them, as <HI>David</HI> of himself, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 12. <HI>Who can understand his Errors?</HI> And whatever these have been; tho' men are not without blame, yet there is the Judgment of God in them, so far as they are penal or afflictive to us. And the more publick these are in Church or State, the more grievous is the Judgment of God upon us. So that, if there be some of those in the foremost Ranks among us, who fall into the Evils and Errors of Immoralities, in Conversation; <HI>So that the box of precious Ointment send forth an evil Savour,</HI> as the expression is, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 10. 1. Or if there be some, who should be like Mount Sion, which cannot be moved, who fall from their own stedfastness, and are tossed to and fro like Children, and forget the Errand into this Wilderness,
<PB N="12" REF="001193_0014_0FB0FEC26B44B0D0"/>
to Plant pure Churches, and to uphold pure Worship and Ordinances. Or if there be some who ought to <HI>Hold fast the form of sound Words,</HI> 2 Tim. 1. 13. But yet dont walk with a right foot according to the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Gospel, as the Word signifies, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 14. But do entertain and endeavour to maintain with obstinacy of mind, such things for truth, as have a direct tendency to destroy Holiness to subvert our Churches, to dissolve our Constitution, and to rase our Foundations, and so wound JESUS CHRIST in the House of his friends; if I may allude to <HI>Zach.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 6. Or if there be a spirit of Contention and Opposition, a <HI>Perverse Spirit</HI> mingled among us, which refuses healing, and a Spirit of Malig∣nity and Persecution, Secretly breathing among us; and there be sad effects of these things, so that we cry out, <HI>Hinc illae Lachrymae!</HI> Hence iniquity abounds, and hence <HI>Love waxes cold,</HI> Charity faints; hence offen∣ces, fears, disgusts, jealousies, evil surmizings, animosities, great and mutual prejudices, incureable and yet insupportable Alienations, Oppo∣sitions and Litigations; and it may be grievous and violent Paroxysms, and Convulsions, which endanger and threaten the Confusion of the whole. Such flaws and cracks in the Foundation, make grievous fractures in the Superstructure, and make all shake and tremble: Hence if our Civil State shake, if our Churches shake, if our Colledge shakes, if our Hearts and Faith shake; if these things blast our hopes, frustrate our expectations, grieve our Souls, dishonour God, and destroy us; so that hereby God accomplishes upon us the threatening denounced, <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 1, 2 3. <HI>For behold the Lord the Lord of Hosts doth take away from Jerusalem and Judah, the Stay and the Staff</HI>—<HI>the mighty man, and the man of War, the Judge, and the Prophet, and the Prudent, and the Ancient, the Captain of Fifty, and the Honourable, and the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r:</HI> Such Political Deaths are the sore and very grievous Judgments of God, and the expressions of his hot and sore displeasure: Howbeit we must justify him and say, He is just in all that is brought upon us, by our own Sins and Follies.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Justify God in all the Penal Evils that have been upon us.</HI> There have been Evils upon us in a way of very observable and successive course; for those not only of the First and Second, but also of the Third Ge∣neration have experienced it. So that we may even say with <HI>Moses; All our days are passed away in thine anger, Psal.</HI> 90. 7.—9. And the latter evils have been greater than the former. We have been striving and st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugling mightily with the Evils which God has caused to take hold of us, and all-sorts and degrees of men among us; and He has held us so fast under the same, that tho' we have tried as it were by force to shake our selves, and by flattery of God to obtain help from him; yet we may even say, <HI>that the tale of our bricks have been doubled.</HI> In the E∣vils which have been upon our Persons, our Liberties, our Estates, our

Peace, and almost all our Good Things; from Heaven, from Hell, from Earth, from Fire, from Water, from Enemies on every hand. So that there has often been occasion to say, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 46. 8. <HI>Came see the Desolations which the Lord hath made.</HI> Howbeit he is most just herein; <HI>For he has exacted of us far less than our iniquities have deserved,</HI> Job 11. 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Justify God in all the Evils that are upon us.</HI> Though our Evils are changed, yet our Evil State is not changed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we are hedged in.

And however unjust, unrighteous, deceitful, treacherous and devilish men have been; <HI>though their throat has been as an open sepulchre, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd with their tongues they have used deceit,</HI> &amp;c. as <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 13,—18. Yet God is most just.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Justify God in all the Evils which do impend over us.</HI> They need be no great <HI>Physiogmonists</HI> in the face of times, who shall tell us, that our Sky looks <HI>Red</HI> and <HI>Lowring.</HI> I shall not undertake to predict our future por∣tion: yet there are some Prognosticks so apparent upon us, that with∣out vanity, or intruding into things not seen, there's reason to look up∣on our case as brought to this sad <HI>dilemma, That either we must be put into some hotter furnace than we have yet known,</HI> for the purging away our dross▪ or expect to undergo a Divine but woful dereliction, as they did <HI>whom God gave up to their own hearts lust, Psal.</HI> 81. 12. Or they that after all were found <HI>Reprobate Silver,</HI> in <HI>Jer.</HI> 6. 28, 29. Unless the times of re∣freshing from the presence of the Lord should first dawn upon us, and cure all.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Justify God in all the Evils that shall come upon us.</HI> Tho' threatned and present evils should be removed or diverted, &amp; the gathered Clouds dissipated; yet other evils unforeseen and unsuspected may break forth upon us suddenly, like that spoken of, <HI>Isa.</HI> 30. 13, 14.—<HI>Whole breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.</HI> God may heap mischiefs, and spend his Arrows upon us, as <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 23.—26.

<P N="6">6. <HI>Whatever becomes of us, God is to be Justifyed.</HI> Whether we do sink or swim, whether we live or dye, be established or confounded; for truly with reverence to his Holy Name be it spoken, <HI>God seems to be at a loss what to do with us;</HI> and is often saying of us? <HI>How shall I give thee up Ephraim?

Yet we must put our mouths in the dust, and confess plainly, that God is and will be most just.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Justify God whatever comes from us.</HI> Whatever God do expect from us, tho' he expects we should be <HI>Children that will not lye, Isa.</HI> 63. 8. Tho' there should be some <HI>Reformations</HI> and Amendments; for there's little hope of a better <HI>Reformation</HI> than that in <HI>Josiah's</HI> time, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 11. And it may be, the Case may come at last to that pass spoken of in old time. <HI>But they mocked the Messengers of God, and despised his words, and mis∣used his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his People, and there was no remedy,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36. 16. And if it does, God is most just &amp; righ∣teous: As He truly is in all that is brought upon us.</P>
<P><HI>USE II. EXHORTATION.</HI> And 'tis twofold.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us be Exhorted to lament and amend our own Sins, Unrigh∣teousness and Injustice before and towards God. God is truly and su∣perlatively just and righteous, without any manner of unrighteousness; and this upon the utmost trial and experiment that can be made of him. We must say, <HI>There's no unrighteousness in him, Psal.</HI> 92. 15. But there is unrighteousness and injustice in us; we have done <HI>wickedly.</HI> Righteousness in God 'tis his Nature and Essence; in man, Unrighte∣ousness is his nature. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 7. And Righteousness 'tis of Grace, and 'tis the Image of God in him, and his acceptableness unto God: Un∣righteousness 'tis the Image of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and displeasing and contrary unto God; and for this God is displeased with us. The Servants and Messengers of God in this place, upon like Occasions, have with one mouth faithfully born witness against our Sins and Unrighteousnesses; and if men should be silent, these <HI>Walls</HI> and these <HI>Pillars</HI> would testify a∣gainst us, that we have been Convicted for offending against the Rules, both of Commutative and Distributive Justice: <HI>We have not given unto God the Glory due to his Name,</HI> to his Nature, to our own Bonds and Ob∣ligations to him; nor have we rendred unto him according to the be∣nefits, means, priviledges and Blessings bestowed upon us. <HI>Hezekiah'</HI>s Sin has been too common among us. We han't Glorifyed God as God, nor been thankful: this is to be lamented and amended; and we should labour to deal truly herein, and not flatter and lye as they did,<HI><PB N="15" REF="001193_0017_0FB0FEC7AF4F2138"/>
Psal.</HI> 78. 36, 37. And if we do so, <HI>God will be merciful to our Unrighteous∣ness, and he will remember our Sins no more,</HI> Heb. 8. 12. If otherwise, the Case is determined, the Written doom will come;—<HI>The Lord knows to reserve the Unjust unto the day of Judgment to be punished,</HI> 2 Pet. 2. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us be Exhorted, to dread and avoid the further provoking the Justice of the Just and Righteous God against us. For God is a <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> God still; and he is in the way of his Judgments: <HI>His Hand is stretched out still;</HI> and may be provoked unto still greater degrees of Just displeasure against us. <HI>He is an Holy and Jealous God,</HI> Josh. 24. 19, 20. <HI>A terrible God:</HI>—Neh. 1. 5. None can be so foolish and Atheistical as to think, that God has sent all his Judgments, and spent all his Arrows upon us. The Anger of God yet to come, is as heavy and dreadful as we can fear it to be: <HI>According to thy fear so is thy wrath,</HI> Psal. 90. 11. Taking the fear of God objectively, it refers unto that Article of the History of <HI>Israels</HI> travels in the Wilderness, which we have in <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. Where when the People had Committed that great and critical Sin of refusing to enter into the Land; and <HI>Moses</HI> told them how ill God re∣sented their evil carriage, they had awful and dreadful apprehensions of the Anger of God; and he tells them <HI>it was every way as great as they could conceive of.</HI> Therefore let us all in general take heed of irritating and exasperating this Just Anger, or this injured and provoked Justice of God against us; Why should we provoke him, <HI>Are we stronger than He?</HI> And therefore in General,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us look to our <HI>Religion.</HI> This is mans glorifying of God and enjoying of him, <HI>and as it is the chief end of man;</HI> so this was the main &amp; principal end of our Fore-fathers, those men of <HI>Renown,</HI> who first stret∣ched forth these Heavens, &amp; laid the foundations of this Earth; Setled a Christian Religious State and Churches in this Country. And they have Committed their work and enterprize to us, and left us to parsue and prosecute the same to effect: and whatever we do without this we do but trifle and <HI>Serio nihil Agere;</HI> and deserve to be reproved for our neglect of Jesus Christ, as <HI>Luk.</HI> 10. 41. If our <HI>Religion</HI> be neglected or perverted, Gods offended Justice will be further provoked and incen∣sed, and we shall be more exposed. <HI>The Name of the Lord is a strong tower whereunto the Righteous flee and are safe,</HI> as <HI>Prov.</HI> 18. 10. Our <HI>Religion</HI> is our greatest and best <HI>bulwark:</HI> If this be neglected our defence departs from us, and we shall be as bread to our enemies, as they said, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 9. If we lose our <HI>Religion</HI> we lose <HI>All;</HI> and if we are cheated of our <HI>Reli∣gion</HI> we are cheated of <HI>All:</HI> for, according to the word of our Lord CHRIST, <HI>All came with our Religion: Seek first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, and all these things shall be added.</HI> And according to the
<PB N="16" REF="001193_0018_0FB0FECA5B8AF2F8"/>
Word of God, all will go with our <HI>Religion. Nos.</HI> 2. 9. <HI>Therefore will I return and take my Corn in the time thereof.</HI> Look well to Religion and we look well to All; Look well to the Soundness and Purity of Religion, in Heart, and Life, in Doctrine, and Practice, in Worship and Discipline; or Christ will say as to <HI>Sardis,</HI>—<HI>I have not found thy ways perfect before God, Rev.</HI> 3. 2. Look well to the Love of our Religion, that so we be not given up to strong delusions, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. 10, 11.—<HI>Because they receiv∣ed not the Love of the truth, that they might be Saved: for this cause God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a Lye:</HI> Even the great An∣tichristian Lye. Look well to the Life and Power of Religion; or Je∣sus Christ will nauseate and spue us out of his mouth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 16. <HI>So then because thou art Luke-warm and neither hot not cold, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</HI> Look at those as the worst Sins, that Hurt our Religion most; as impenitence, unbelief, error, heresy, superstition, hypocrisy, forma∣lity, and all manner of Apostacy. And look at those as our poorest friends, that are not friends to our Religion; and those as our worst Enemies who are Enemies to our Religion, who strike at and hurt our Religion; the case between such and us is much as it was sometimes between the <HI>Syrian King,</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 22. 31. Our Religion it is our Life,—And as he said, so may we, <HI>Set your hearts to all the words which I testify to you this day,</HI>—<HI>for it is not a vain thing for you, for it is your life, Deut.</HI> 32. 46. They that would take away our Religion would take a∣way our Lives: they would commit the worst Murder upon us. What that great Reformer <HI>Luther</HI> said of the Doctrine of Justification; it is <HI>Articulus stantis et Cadentis Ecclesiae;</HI> may we much more say of our Reli∣gion, it is, <HI>Articulus stantis et Cadentis Populi.</HI> If you dont look well to your Religion, Jesus Christ will say as to them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13. 34, 35. <HI>Your House is left unto you desolate.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us Labour to acquit our selves well with respect unto <HI>Civil Government.</HI> Government it is Gods Ordinance: therefore as we should <HI>Fear God,</HI> so should we <HI>Honour the King,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 17. <HI>And the Powers that are among us, they are of God,</HI> Rom. 13. 1. It is a great mercy of God to us, all our difficulties &amp; uneasinesses which we labour under notwithstand∣ing: our Government is a great Mercy of God to us, and that which we ought to be truly thankful to him for. If it should degenerate into <HI>Tyranny, Anarchy,</HI> or such hardships as we hear some others groan under, we should soon find the difference. Therefore let us labour to acquit our selves well, and approve our selves as good Christians: as <HI>Paul</HI> did, <HI>Exercise our selves herein to have a Conscience void of offence towards God and towards man,</HI> Act. 16. 24. Real, true Christians are the best Subjects in the Civil State, for they are Subject out of Conscience; they will, and we should honour Civil Government, as we are required in the <HI>Fifth
<PB N="17" REF="001193_0019_0FB0FECC20402638"/>
Command.</HI> We should pray for <HI>Civil Authority,</HI> 1 Tim. 2. 1. <HI>For God turneth the hearts of Kings as the Rivers of waters are turned,</HI> and they can't withstand him. We should submit and be in subjection to Civil Au∣thority. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 13, 14. And we should uphold and support Civil Go∣vernment; that it may not decay, languish and sink; it's true, 'tis not a time for us <HI>to seek great things to our selves,</HI> God faith, <HI>seek them not,</HI> Jer. 45. 5. But we must endeavour that our Government be not mean, sor∣did and contemptible. Thus in general.</P>
<P>More particularly.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Let this Exhortation be Presented and Recommended unto those among us who are betrusted with the <HI>Civil Government.</HI> The betrust∣ment of the Government, whether it be the <HI>Legislative</HI> or the <HI>Executive</HI> part of it, or both, is great; God and his people have committed much unto You, and reposed great Assurances in You: Therefore to You the Exhortation is, that You would consider and dread, and avoid any other further provoking the offended Justice of God against us. And SIR, Let this Counsel be acceptable to Your EXCELLENCY, to the Honourable COUNCIL, and to the worthy Gentlemen the REPRE∣SENTATIVES of the Province, to labour that the offended Justice of God, may neither by <HI>Omission of Duty,</HI> nor by <HI>Commission of Evil,</HI> nor by any means be any farther exasperated and incensed against us. Be Ex∣horted in Your respective Stations to do Your part faithfully in this mat∣ter; accordingly approve your selves in the work of this day, in Re-e∣stablishing of us: this day is to us an omen and index of the ensuing Year. And if God be with You this day, we shall take it for a token for good to us for this Year also, and it is a great thing for the Barren Fig-tree to be spared one year. Therefore labour that the <HI>Election</HI> of this day may be so made and managed as may not further incense the already provoked Justice of God against us: Remember that Apostolical Precept. <HI>Let nothing be done thro' strife or vain glory,</HI>—<HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 3. Let all conten∣tion, animosity, faction, private, base, sinister private ends &amp; interests be ba∣nished from the Publick management. Remember it has been wont to be said; next to the Glory of God, <HI>Salus Populi suprema Lex,</HI> the Publick Good is the main thing. And so in all after and smaller Elections be faithful Stewards for God and his People; you are betrusted by and for Jesus Christ: who saith, <HI>By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Justice, Prov.</HI> 8. 15. Take heed of betraying Jesus Christ in his interest and work; Chuse such into the Government as you Judge to be true <HI>Lovers</HI> of, and <HI>Loyal</HI> unto Jesus Christ; such as will stand by and for his inter∣est in a day of tryal, at a pinch; this will be pleasing to him.

The God of Israel said, the Rock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Israel spake to me.</HI> A Solemn Preface unto this Position, <HI>He that Ruleth over men must be Just, Ruling in the Fear or God.</HI> And if all Elections be such, it shall be as the light of the Morning, when the Sun riseth▪ e∣ven a Morning without Clouds; <HI>As the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 2.—4. Moreover give me leave to propound unto, and leave under your serious Consideration these particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider whether there ought not to be some stronger and stricter guard set upon God's <HI>Holy Sabbath,</HI> to prevent the Prophanation of it. Gods Holy Sabbath▪ the Lords Day is very dear unto God, and our Lord Jesus Christ; it is His Day and therefore is greater than any man's day whatsoever. We ought not to set it at a low rate. It has been an old and true Observation, that it fares with all instituted Worship, and the whole interest of Religion among a People, as it does with the Sabbath: therefore it is worthy of your serious Consideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider what is to be done for the promoting of <HI>Liberal Education</HI> among us. That we may have not onely the Name of Learning, but the Thing; that we may have Polished Stones for the Publick Buildings in Church and State; if we so serve the Providence of God as to obtain the common gifts and graces of his Spirit, we may depend upon and hope in him, for his special and sanctifyed Grace also, and then we shall have that promise fulfilled; <HI>I will give you Pastors after my own heart, which shall fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d you with knowledge and understanding,</HI> Jer. 3. 15. Let the <HI>Colledge</HI> be effectually cared for; if that precious fountain, be either dryed up, or perverted it will be of dreadful consequence. And let not inferiour <HI>Schools</HI> escape your Consideration, that if it be possible they may be Set∣led upon an easy and lasting Basis.</P>
<P N="3">3. Consider if there might not some mark of favour and encourage∣ment be put upon the <HI>Sober, Industrious, Laborious, Profitable</HI> part of the People; and some discountenance upon the contrary, even such as mostly serve their own and others Lusts.</P>
<P N="4">4. Consider how the <HI>Publick Faith</HI> may be kept Sacred and Inviolate; the Credit, honour and honesty, and so the comfort and safety of the Publick does very much depend hereupon. Let <HI>Publick Promises</HI> be as good security as private bonds. That none may be forced; or may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustly make complaint that they are, <HI>by the Publick denyed or delayed their
<PB N="19" REF="001193_0021_0FB0FECE6A8EB6E0"/>
own.</HI> Many can bear the burden, though heavy, better than one or a few.</P>
<P N="5">5. Consider how you may be, not onely <HI>Just</HI> but also <HI>Good,</HI> to those that faithfully <HI>Serve the Publick;</HI> such as spend their time and themselves in the Publick Service, should not be forgotten; there should be a pro∣portion between their burden and their benefit. There are some Serve the Publick in the Magistracy, and there is a tribute in Prudence and Conscience due unto them. <HI>For this Cause pay you tribust also; for they are Gods Ministers attending continually upon this very thing.</HI> Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 6. There are some Serve the Publick in the Ministry; and God has ordained that <HI>those who Preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel,</HI> 1 Cor. 9. 14. And there are some that Serve the Publick in our Warfare; <HI>And who go∣eth a warfare at his own Charges?</HI> 1 Cor. 9. 7. They that venture their Lives for us in the High Places of the Field should not be shortened in, and pinched out of their just and righteous encouragments, which have been proposed and offered unto them; let none say, <HI>they serve hard and penurious Masters.</HI> I know our low Estate, Poverty and great burdens are great Temptations; but it was a sound and sure maxim laid down by a Master of Politicks under the direction of the Spirit of God: <HI>There is that scattereth and yet increaseth: there is that witholdeth more than is meet and it tendeth unto Poverty,</HI> Prov. 11. 24. Remember and practise that great Rule, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7. 12. <HI>What things ye would that others should do unto you, do the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me things.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. And if I may at this time of day propound it: Consider to put the <HI>Eastern Parts</HI> under some better Regulations, both for <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ility</HI> &amp; <HI>Religion,</HI> if God shall ever betrust us again with that Talent: The anger of God against that neglect has been written in dreadful Characters of blood and fire.</P>
<P N="7">7. Consider what you may do for <HI>Unity</HI> and <HI>Unanimity;</HI> and Sacrifice all but a good Conscience thereunto: and then may we hope that no foot of Pride will come against us, nor wicked hand move us; if you shall aright Consider of and attend unto these things.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Let this Exhortation be presented and recommended to the Re∣verend Ministers of the Gospel; That they would dread and avoid further provoking and incensing of the Anger of God, of this just and righteous God. You know the terrour of the Lord: it greatly con∣cerns Ministers to step into the breach, and stand in the gap, between the Living and the Dead; so did <HI>Aaron, Phineas, Samuel,</HI> and the <HI>Levites</HI> in <HI>Nehemiah's</HI> and <HI>Ezra's</HI> time. Therefore be <HI>Exhorted</HI> for this end▪</P>
<P N="1">1. To labour to walk close with God in your places. Those that are Leaders, guides and ensamples unto others, should labour to walk <HI>Wisely,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="001193_0022_0FB0FED21AB02F10"/>
1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 3. For the People, will and should follow them, only with that Caution, <HI>as they follow Christ,</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 1, 2. Not with a blind devotion and foolish Credulity: its a Noble thing to do as the well bred <HI>Bereans</HI> did, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 11. Ministers are to be Copies not only in Doctrine but in Conversation: and what can be hoped for if they are Vain, Loose, Lux∣urious, Extravagant or Unsavory; they are the Salt of the Earth, <HI>and if the Salt have lost its Savour,</HI> and is become foolish, <HI>wherewith shall it be Salted,</HI> Mat. 5. 13. <HI>Take heed to your selves</HI>—<HI>that you may save your selves, and them that hear you,</HI> 1 Tim. 4. 16.</P>
<P N="2">2. Use utmost endeavour to bring back your People unto the Lord God of our Fathers; this is the way to prevent any further provoking of the offended Justice of God against our Land. It is true there has been much striving of the Ministry herein; many have spent them∣selves in this labour and expired, and breathed forth their Souls into the bosom of Jesus Christ in their Agonies of this undertaking. And what can those do that are left, whose strength is so much weakened in the way? And yet we must labour, and strive <HI>and be faithful unto the death, Rev.</HI> 2. 10. the <HI>Levites</HI> did so in <HI>Jehosophat'</HI>s time, and there came good of it; as in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19. 4. &amp; 8. And there is the late Declaration of the Authority among us, which is a good testimony for them, that their hands shall be with us; And if they are not, will be a most pungent te∣stimony against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; for 'tis laid up in the Records of Heaven, <HI>in per∣petu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>memori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> Let it be like the sound of going in the tops of the <HI>Mulberry Trees</HI> to encourage us to bestir our selves; as 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5. 24. for it may properly be said unto us, as was said unto him, <HI>Arise, for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> belongeth unto thee, Ezra</HI> 10. 4. Thus the Gospel was at first intro∣duced, and this is the way to propagate and perpetuate it: <HI>And He shall go before him in the Spirit and power of</HI> Elias, <HI>to turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and of the disobedient, to the wisdom of the Just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</HI> This is the way to keep off the Curse from our I and.—<HI>And He shall turn the heart of the Children to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a Curse,</HI> Mal. 4. 6. And this will Restore to us prosperity, <HI>Jer.</HI> 22. 15, 16. So it did to <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> and to his People, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 17. 3. <HI>And the Lord was with Jehosaphat because He walked in the first ways of David his father. Davids</HI> first ways were his best ways. And so doubtless, <HI>New-England'</HI>s first were their best ways: It is true they were but men at first, and had their imperfections and infirmities: But they were <HI>Excellent men,</HI> men of Renown, a chosen and pickt Genera∣tion, the very flower of the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation,</HI> sifted out by God's own hand, and out-stretched Arm: They were a generation of great wisdom, of great Learning, of great grace and experience and acquaintance with God; of great tryals, afflictions &amp; persecutions, how little soever some
<PB N="21" REF="001193_0023_0FB0FED2F7A963C0"/>
account of them, and their work and way now, and do industriously, forsake and reproach it, and condemn them for transgressors; they that destroy the things that are built up, make those builders transgressors, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 18. But they were truly their best ways, their ways of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> their ways of <HI>Piety, Sincerity</HI> and <HI>Purity;</HI> their ways of <HI>Love</HI> to, <HI>zeal</HI> for, <HI>delight</HI> in God and Christ, and Gospel, and Gospel Ministers and Ordinances; their ways of pure and holy Churches, and Worship, and Saints which they were built of; for they that build up their Churches of mud Walls, and think to keep them clean with the besom of Discipline, are like to have an hard task of it, and but little blessing upon it. All the Sons of <HI>Sion</HI> should be like the fine Gold, and this is like our first golden Can∣dlesticks; thus should our people be brought back.</P>
<P>In particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us labour to bring them back in regard of <HI>Principles,</HI> unto the first <HI>Principles of our Fathers</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> after that they were setled, and had cleared up things; so that they did clearly, distinctly and pro∣fessedly declare their principles &amp; publish them; these principles owned and avowed by them, and skreened from those misinterpretations which some would reproach them with, should we return unto: It's a sad con∣sideration, that there has been so great, sinful and very grievous bandy∣ing and beating about principles, That the Enemy, who loves to fish in troubled waters, has almost fished away all, or at least all our good and first principles from us: And left us a drift in an unsettled fluctuant posture, to our shame and humiliation.</P>
<P>With respect to principles, let me propound three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let our Principles be <HI>Scriptural.</HI> The Holy Scripture is that <HI>Gol∣den Rule which we should measure the Sanctuary with, Rev.</HI> 11. 1. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 40. 3. This is the true and only Standard of the Sanctuary; if this be not attended unto, all in the Sanctuary will be marred &amp; corrupted; <HI>Churches</HI> will be corrupted, <HI>Ordinances</HI> will be corrupted; and visible Saints will be corrupted: <HI>Ministers</HI> they will not be as Gods mouth, as they ought to be, <HI>Jer.</HI> 15. 19. They will not be able to keep the charge of the holy things of God, and then he will be displeased with them as He was, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44. 8, 9.—11. <HI>v.</HI> however they may be continued to be Ministers still. There are no other measures of men or Angels will quadrate with Gods Sanctuary, but only this Golden Rule. Ministers must teach only what Jesus Christ has commanded them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 20. <HI>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I command you.</HI>—And the Com∣mands
<PB N="22" REF="001193_0024_0FB0FED4B6068548"/>
of Jesus Christ are in the Holy Scriptures, there∣fore unto Scriptural Principles should we labour to bring them back.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Election Ser∣mon.</HI></NOTE> A very able comprehensive head and holy heart, near thirty years ago, did in this Place lay down this Rule, and it is a good one. <Q>Let Truth be Truth how contrary soever it be to any, to their apprehensions, interests and inclinati∣ons.</Q> Scripture Truth is Truth indeed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let our principles be <HI>Rational,</HI> those that are not Rational, are not Scriptural: here it holds true, <HI>Si collidimur frangimur.</HI> Principles should not be like Ropes of Sand, meer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they should carry a certain de∣monstrativeness of Reason with them, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 9. as the word there imports.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let Principles be as much as is possible according to the <HI>Good Old way.</HI> It's true, we should not take principles on trust, or the Authori∣ty of men; because that these or those men were so opinionated: And it is as true, we should not reject them upon trust; not reject them, because these and those men dislike of, and are prejudiced a∣gainst them. To leave old Principles proved and approved by the most Eminent Servants of God, and Societies of God's People, and by God himself, and take up with new ones in their stead, is no better than setting up of new Gods; <HI>Gods newly brought up, Deut.</HI> 32. 17. This was their sin; and if we do so, it will be our sin and shame: There∣fore let us adhere, and bring back all to the good old Principles, which have been thus proved and approved; and walk in the way of good men, as the advice of Wisdom, even of Jesus Christ is, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2. 20. And it was Christ's way to reduce things to what they were at the beginning, and so to regulate them, so in the case of Mar∣riage; and so he directs them: <HI>Do the first works, Rev.</HI> 2. 5. And those that do indeed know the good of the first, will adhere unto them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 5. 39. <HI>No man having drunk old wine, straightway desireth new; for he saith the old is better.</HI> And thus we should endeavour to bring back all to the first Principles of our Fathers, and so to their first Ways.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us endeavour not only to engage the <HI>Hearts</HI> of our People to us, but their <HI>Prayers</HI> for us It's a good thing for Ministers to have the hearts of their People; the Word of the Gospel is more like to have its free course, and run from the heart to the heart. But they should also endeavour to have their Prayers, and this will engage and dispose them to profit by them; this therefore is a most desirable, pleasant and precious thing: <HI>As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold; so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear, Prov.</HI> 25. 12.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="001193_0025_0FB0FED5EAE5BC38"/>
The third branch of the <HI>EXHORTATION</HI> follows,</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> The Exhortation speaks to the People of <HI>All Sorts, Old</HI> and <HI>Young, High,</HI> and <HI>Low, Rich</HI> and <HI>Poor,</HI> in their several Stations; that they would very earnestly endeavour and do their utmost, <HI>That the Justice of God may not be further provoked against us.</HI> God is angry with us; his Justice is offended; or else we must say as the Enemy of God and his People saith, <HI>That the Lord's Hand hath not done all this,</HI> Deut. 32. 27. For all that has come upon us is either from the Lord or it is some Chance that has happened unto us: Therefore let us not halt between two opinions. And if we do indeed acknowledge God; we have cause to say as <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 120. <HI>My flesh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> Therefore dont put more <HI>fuel</HI> into this devouring fire, nor oyl into this consuming flame.</P>
<P>Here are three things to be attended.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of and avoid <HI>Gospel</HI> Sins. Where the Gospel comes there are the greatest Sins in the World; such Sins are more hainous than the Sins of <HI>Sodom, Matt.</HI> 11. 20—24. Gospel neglecting, Gospel re∣fusing, and Gospel despising; Impenitence, Unbelief, hardness of Heart; Ignorance of, unthankfulness for, and barrenness under Jesus Christ in his Gospel; loathing the Heavenly Manna; Lukewarmness, Hypocrisy, and taking up with a shew and appearance instead of substance, <HI>Luk.</HI> 8. 18. And falling off from and forsaking Jesus Christ for this present evil World: These are Sins to be avoided, if we would not have God pro∣voked yet more.</P>
<P N="2">2. Walk before God in your <HI>Houses</HI> in a perfect way. God has raised us up Families like Flocks, and filled our Land with People; Families are Societies which nature institutes; and the <HI>Heads</HI> of them by a natu∣ral right govern them; and <HI>Religious Heads</HI> should govern them for God. We say, that We and our Families are <HI>Abrahams</HI> Children, <HI>Abrahams</HI> Children are of the <HI>Faith of Abraham, Gal.</HI> 3. 6, 7, 9. And should do the works of <HI>Abraham, Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 8. 39, 40. Now <HI>Abraham commanded his House to Serve the Lord,</HI> Gen. 18. 19. If we would shine as lights in an evil Gene∣ration: if we would be of another Spirit, than the World are of, we must do as <HI>Joshua</HI> did: Resolve every one, <HI>As for me and mine House, We will Serve the Lord,</HI> Josh. 24. 15. Mend Families and mend all, ruin Families and ruin all. It is a sad Omen to Consider how many of the most no∣ted Families in this Country are utterly extinct or worse: <HI>Fond Indul∣gence</HI> and <HI>Remisness</HI> in Family Government destroys Families: it brings <HI>Belialism</HI> into our Land, which does diffuse it self abroad, and passeth like oyl into our bones. And if <HI>Eli's</HI> Sins be found among us, we must
<PB N="24" REF="001193_0026_0FB0FED8C4248FE8"/>
expect <HI>Eli's</HI> Judgments, and have had a severe taste of them already: our Children have been brought forth for the Murderer; they have been numbred from year to year these many years to the Sword, to Fa∣mine, to Captivity, to Sickness, to Shipwrack and to Death, by Scor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and by hundreds of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be much in <HI>Prayer.</HI> Prayer is the very breath and vital Air of a Child of God, 'tis their guise to be much in Prayer, they are Spirited for it. There's the Spirit of Adoption, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ in them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 6. And this Spirit helps them to Pray, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 26. And gives them boldness with God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 16. Pray therefore for the <HI>Effusi∣ons of this Spirit:</HI> Pray for the Kingdom and Glory of the Lord Jesus Christ: Pray for the <HI>Churches</HI> that they may be kept <HI>Pure</HI> and <HI>Entire:</HI> Pray for the <HI>Children</HI> of the Lords People, that He would Circumcise their Hearts to fear him, and that He would help his Servants aright, clearly to discern, and faithfully and successfully to do their Duty to them; that they may not become a Generation of his Wrath: And this Prayer of Faith is the best way to prevent the encrease, and extin∣guish the flames which are kindled upon us round about, by which we have been set on Fire, and are still burning: for this will engage the intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is the most precious and acceptable incense of Atonement, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8. 3, 4.</P>
<P>To enforce this whole <HI>APPLICATION,</HI> there are these four Con∣siderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a most <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> thing that we should do so. That we should Seek <HI>Atonement</HI> through Jesus Christ; and that we should <HI>Justify</HI> God, in all the Evils and Judgments of God against us; and that we should <HI>Lament</HI> and <HI>Amend</HI> our own Sins and Unrighteousness before the Lord, and endeavour all to do our utmost that this <HI>Offended Justice</HI> of God may not be more provoked against us: These are Just and Right things, such as we owe to our own Souls, to one another, and also to the Lord our God.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is the truest accepting of the punishment of our Sins; when God punishes Sin, <HI>i. e.</HI> does inflict evil upon his People or Chastise them for their Sins: He expects they should be humble under his hand; <HI>Ex∣alt him, kiss the Rod, and lye in the dust, if there be hope, Lam.</HI> 3. 29.—31. And this is one of his great ends which God aims at, and 'tis acceptable to him to see it attained; therefore when he saw it in <HI>Ephraim, his bow∣els were moved for him, Jer.</HI> 31. 18. And if this end be attained upon us, his bowels will yet be moved for <HI>New-England,</HI> and his repentings will be enkindled together. Of old time God has encouraged his People, that in this way they should hope for his gracious and effectual remem∣bring
<PB N="25" REF="001193_0027_0FB0FED9C8861D18"/>
of them. <HI>If they confess their iniquity;</HI>—<HI>if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity: Then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and also my Covenant with Isaac, and also my Covenant with Abraham, will I remember, and I will remember the Land, Lev.</HI> 26. 40, 41, 42. God has been in <HI>Covenant</HI> with three Gene∣rations in this Land; and if we now accept the punishment of our sins, surely he will remember his people, his Covenant and his Land.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is the most proper and only course to <HI>Cure</HI> all our Maladies. Our Maladies are great; the symptoms grievous, inveterate if not desperate; <HI>the whole head is sick, the whole heart is faint, Isa.</HI> 1. 5. And we have our healers, blessed be God for it; <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 7. But there's no method, there is no application will be so effectual and so successful as this; it would cure our Moral and our Political, our Ecclesiastical and our Civil, our Personal and Publick Maladies; it would heal our guilt of Sin which makes sick. <HI>The Inhabitants shall not say I am sick, for the people that dwell therein, shall be forgiven their iniquity, Isa.</HI> 33. 24. It would heal our devi∣ations and declensions, our murmurings, evil jealousies, our perverse Spirits, distractions and all our breaches; and confirm our hopes and our faith.</P>
<P N="4">4. This will be the only way to extract <HI>Good</HI> out of all our <HI>Evils,</HI> ei∣ther come or coming. Extracts are excellent noble Remedies; when the malignity of the evil is corrected, then it is reconciled, and the vir∣tue of it may be enjoyed; our worst evils will be <HI>Salubrious,</HI> as far as 'tis possible they should be. And all those that will try the experiment, shall at least be sure to save their own Souls.—<HI>They should deliver but their own Souls by their Righteousness, saith the Lord, Ezek.</HI> 14. 14. And there is as much hope for the whole in this way as any: That yet there may come good out of evil to us; light out of darkness, and life out of death, at least in the utmost issue and event of them: That God will acknow∣ledge us as he did the good figs; And <HI>though a basket of them should be carried into Babylon, it shall be for their good;</HI>—<HI>because he will set his eyes up∣on them for good.</HI>—<HI>And will give them an heart to know him, that he is the Lord, and they shall be his people, and he will be their God, as Jer.</HI> 24. 5, 6, 7. Then he will arise for us, and render <HI>a reward to our neighbours, seven fold into their bosom, their reproach wherewith they have reproached,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Psal.</HI> 79. 12. And we may justly make the same conclusion which the man after Gods own heart did, <HI>Psal.</HI> 41. 12, 13. As for us he will uphold us in our integrity, and set us before his face for ever. <HI>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from Everlasting to Everlasting.</HI> Amen, <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
