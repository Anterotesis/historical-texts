<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE are the Words (you are sensible) of blessed <HI>Paul,</HI> the great Doctor of the Gentiles, &amp; as one calls him, the great Pat∣tern of the Clergy. They breathe the true Spirit of a Mi∣nister of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>; and are very agreeable, I hope, to the Dispositions &amp; Resolutions of our dear <HI>Brother,</HI> who is this day to be solemnly separa∣ted to the Ministry of the Gospel. As they are very fit to be his Ordination-Vow; so I'm perswaded, they
<PB N="2" REF="002744_0003_0FE61FD40101C060"/>
enter into his Soul, and tell us the secret Language of his Heart: and truly glad shou'd I have been, if (pursuant to the Custom, which hath so long obtain'd among us) he cou'd have been prevail'd on to take up the Book at this time, &amp; preach to us his own de∣vout Thoughts &amp; Purposes. Or otherwise, if he might justly be excus'd upon the Plea's usually advanc'd in this case, against the common Custom,— Why cou'd not some venerable Father or elder Brother in this Neighbourhood, have taken the desk? Which, as it must needs have been acceptable to the Audience, so I'm sure exceedingly more pleasing to <HI>me,</HI> who am the unfittest among the Multitude of my Brethren, to speak on so great an Occasion, and to such an Assem∣bly. But since this part of the Day's work has been devolv'd upon me, I wou'd ask your ready &amp; grave Attention, while I endeavour, with all plainness of Speech and in the most familiar &amp; useful manner I can, to represent &amp; urge some of the Things which concern both Ministers &amp; People. Men &amp; Brethren, I pretend not to any new Doctrine, neither stand here to inform or dictate: but bear with me, while I stir up your Minds by way of Remembrance. For so it becomes us to exhort &amp; admonish one another, espe∣cially on these Solemnities; and not be negligent to put each other always in mind of these Things, al∣tho' we know them, and are establish'd in the pre∣sent Truth.</P>
<P>The words I've read to you, contain a rich Fund of useful &amp; seasonable Meditations. But shou'd I at∣tempt a just Discourse on the several parts of the Text, I must needs transgress the usual Limits, and take up abundantly too much of the Time, which on such a day particularly is very precious. If therefore
<PB N="3" REF="002744_0004_0FE61FDB7158EF40"/>
I wave the formality of dividing my Text, as well as pass over the Connection of the words, and but hint at some of the Reflections they afford, (that I may not be over tedious &amp; burdensome) you'l easily forgive me this wrong.</P>
<P>The Argument I have chiefly in view, and which seems a genuine &amp; obvious Inference from the inspi∣red passage before us, is this,—</P>
<Q>That <HI>Ministers are to be held a kind of</HI> FATHERS, <HI>in the Church of GOD.</HI> They stand as in the Relation of <HI>Parents</HI> to the Ecclesiastical Families of God's People, and shou'd study to ex∣press a Fatherly Spirit in the whole of their sacred Ministry.</Q>
<P>The Apostle hints the Relation, &amp; breathes the Spirit, in the words of our Text: and his constant Practice was full of bright &amp; instructive Comments upon it.</P>
<P>The Parental Relation is the <HI>second</HI> in human Na∣ture; next to the Conjugal. 'Tis a superiour Rela∣tion, and carries Authority with it: a near Relation, and bespeaks the tenderest Love, the greatest Care, and Complacence. It carries a peculiar Affection &amp; Endearment, to sweeten &amp; regulate the Authority and Power of it. And this may be the Reason why it is made a <HI>Pattern,</HI> &amp; every other Relation, in which there's Superiority, is in Scripture set forth under the Parental Character. Hence the Supreme Lord of all is stiled the <HI>Everlasting Father</HI>; and when he would set out his own boundless Love &amp; Pity to his People, He compares it to the Bowels of a <HI>Mother,</HI> and the Compassion of a <HI>Father,</HI> as the most lively and <HI>sensible</HI> Representations. — Hence also <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> are called Fathers. In several Nations, the
<PB N="4" REF="002744_0005_0FE6203CB7CCF150"/>
Princes &amp; Governours have affected this Title, as the most splendid Badge of Honour. Among the Phi∣listines, their Princes assum'd the appellative Name, <HI>Abimelech,</HI> i. e. My Father the King. The Roman Senators of old tho't it their brightest Character to be <HI>Patriae Patres,</HI> Fathers of their Country; and the Oratour constantly salutes them with the Stile of <HI>Patres conscripti. — Job,</HI> that godly Arabian Prince, glories in it, that he was a <HI>Father</HI> to his People. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> cry'd after <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Chariot, <HI>Abreck,</HI> i. e. (as many carry it) <HI>Tender Father</HI>! And in the Prophet, it is promised the Church, that Kings should be <HI>Nursing Fathers,</HI> and Queens <HI>Nursing Mothers</HI> to her.—But then this is the style of <HI>Ministers,</HI> as well as Magistrates. There are Fathers in the Church, as well as the State. And indeed this Title of <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> was in old time a very common Name for the Ministers of Religion. Hence <HI>Elisha</HI> cry'd after the ascending Prophet, <HI>My Father, my Father!</HI> — And He had this Respect repaid him by the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> who wept over the dying Prophet, saying, <HI>O my Father, my Father!</HI> — And some good In∣terpreters judge, that <HI>Solomon</HI> personates the <HI>Preacher,</HI> where he says, <HI>Hear, ye Children, the Instruction of a</HI> Father, <HI>and attend to know Understanding.</HI> A manner of Address much like that so often us'd by the Apostle <HI>John, — My little Children,</HI> these things write I un∣to you, that you sin not: <HI>Little Children,</HI> let no man deceive you. He used this Compellation, as being a Father to them by <HI>Office,</HI> as well as in Years. And to add no more, <HI>Micah</HI> invited the wandring young <HI>Levite</HI> to his House, in those Terms, — <HI>Dwell with me, and be unto me a Father, and a Priest.</HI> And in the same Language was he afterwards invited away by
<PB N="5" REF="002744_0006_0FE61FDB78AAE988"/>
the Children of <HI>Dan,—Go with us, and be to us a Fa∣ther, and a Priest.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to my Design, which mainly is to take a View of the Gospel Minister under this notion of a Spiritual <HI>Father</HI>: A Character, which though it be very naturally applicable to him, and is a Scripture-Title, and must needs be equally pleasant and pro∣fitable to meditate upon, yet perhaps but seldom has been allow'd its due Consideration. 'Tis not an emp∣ty Title; but is full of Duty, full of Dignity, Sweet∣ness and Charm. This external Character, when found in conjunction with those intrinsick Excellen∣cies, Accomplishments, &amp; Virtues, which correspond to it, gives us the most Divine Idea of the Gospel-Minister, &amp; makes him appear in his truest Glory.</P>
<P>This Character, apply'd to Ministers, may import the following things more especially</P>
<P N="1">1. It carries in it an Idea of <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Dignity,</HI> and speaks the Eminence of their <HI>Station</HI> in the House of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. It hints to us the noble <HI>End</HI> of their Institution; with the <HI>Importance</HI> and <HI>Usefulness</HI> of such an Order of Men.</P>
<P N="3">3. It points out the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Business</HI> of their Office.</P>
<P N="4">4. It suggests to us what their <HI>Qualifications</HI> and Accomplishments should be.</P>
<P N="5">5 It tells us what <HI>Tempers</HI> and <HI>Deportments</HI> do become them.</P>
<P>Finally, It teaches us the <HI>Duty</HI> and Respect, which <HI>People</HI> owe to their Ministers.</P>
<P>Nothing short of these Things can be intended in this Character of <HI>Parents</HI> or <HI>Fathers</HI>; and all of them I think, are fairly included. They are comprehen∣sive
<PB N="6" REF="002744_0007_0FE61FDC85D35D10"/>
Heads of Discourse: but I shall endeavour to sum up what is to be said upon them, in as few words as is consistent with my double Design, respect∣ing Parents as well Natural, as Ecclesiastical.</P>
<P N="1">I. Then, <HI>Ministers may be call'd Parents or Fa∣thers, in regard of their</HI> Station <HI>and</HI> Authority <HI>in the Church.</HI></P>
<P>The Pastor stands as 'twere in the Father's place; a Post of Dignity and Power.</P>
<P>Every Father ordinarily has a Family and House∣hold of his own: and all that belong to it are Sub∣ordinate to Him, in their Domestic Capacity. He is the Head of the House, by the Law of Nature and Reason of Things. As the Head is the highest and most conspicuous Part of the Body; is placed at the Top, has a governing Power ever all the rest of the Members, &amp; is the Glory of the Man: So the Parents are the principal and most eminent Members of the Family; but in special, the Father. The Husband is the Head of the Wife: and besure then the Father is Head over the Children.</P>
<P>Man is by the Capacity and Propensity of his Na∣ture, a sociable Creature: well styl'd by the Philoso∣pher, <HI>A political Animal.</HI> We are form'd for mutual Fellowship and Commerce; without which many va∣luable purposes of Life can't be serv'd. 'Tis neces∣sary to the political Well-being of Mankind, that they combine together in distinct Societies: and e∣qually necessary it is, that in every Society there be Government and Order. Now a Family is the first Society in Nature; a kind of little Kingdom, where the Distinctions of Superior and Inferior, Governor and Governed take place, by an inevitable Necessi∣ty,
<PB N="7" REF="002744_0008_0FE61FDC8CD7CBC8"/>
and the force of natural Light. Had Mankind continu'd in their original State of Innocence and Happiness, it is highly probable there would have been a Distinction of Orders and Degrees among them. Doubtless at least there had been distinct Fa∣milies: and Nature has in these founded an immuta∣ble Difference of Order, a Superiority &amp; Inferiority between the Parents and the Children. Levilism here besure is contrary to the unalterable Reason of Things, and bids Defiance to the God of Nature. The Superiority and Power of Parents in their own Houses, is establish'd upon the justest and most in∣violable Claims: and the careful preservation of it makes much for the Harmony, Beauty and Strength of these little Bodies politick.</P>
<P>Now, when Ministers are call'd Parents or Fathers, it may intimate that their Station and Figure in the Church, carries a Shadow of this Paternal Eminence. JESUS CHRIST is Supreme Head of the Church: but He has deputed Ministers to preside over parti∣cular Flocks or Families of his People, as his Substitutes and Agents. We read, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.27, 28. Ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in particular: And GOD hath set some in the Church, <HI>Teachers, — Helps, Governments.</HI> So <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11. He gave— some <HI>Pastors and Teachers,</HI> — for the work of the Ministry, till we all come, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — The Church is compared to a <HI>Household,</HI> (which is an orderly Society, implying a Variety of Members, in a State of Inequality and Subordination) and Ministers are placed therein as Fathers, to guide the House.</P>
<P>The many other exalted Titles and Names of Au∣thority given them in the Scriptures, make this appear with a glaring Evidence. Thus they are
<PB N="8" REF="002744_0009_0FE61FE2A01A4AD0"/>
called <HI>Angels</HI>; partly no doubt with an eye to the distinguishing Elevation and Authority of those Heavenly Powers, as well as to their eminent Purity and Zeal. So, the <HI>Lights</HI> of the World; in allusion to the glorious Luminaries over our Heads; the Sun which was made to rule by Day, and the Moon and Stars, which were made to rule by Night. They are called <HI>Stars</HI>; because they move in a Superiour Orb, as well as to "signify their diffusive Light and beneficial Influences" — They are called <HI>Overseers</HI> of the Church, and are said to be <HI>over them</HI> in the Lord; to have the <HI>Rule over them.</HI> — Not for that they have <HI>Dominion</HI> over their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Conscience,</HI> but are helpers of their Joy: Neither as being <HI>Lords,</HI> to tyrannise over GODs Heritage; but as <HI>Parents,</HI> whose Yoke is naturally of all others the most easy, and their Burden light. Yet neither do We pretend to stretch the power of Ministers to the height of Parental Authority, or make it altogether of the same kind; but only ascribe to them some faint Resem∣blance and lower Degrees. We mean not to assume to our selves a Civil or Temporal Superiority and Dominion: but only assert our Station <HI>in the Church,</HI> and Right of Precedence and Rule in Ecclesiastical Affairs, according to the Word of GOD, that unerr∣ing Directory. We would make <HI>This</HI> our grand Rule, in the exercise of our Pastoral Authority. And (I will add) so far as we appprehend that celebrated Summary of Church-Discipline, commonly call'd the <HI>Platform,</HI> is grounded on the Scriptures, we hearti∣ly concur with it, and desire to guide our selves by it in our Pastoral Care. Agreeable to this <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f.</HI> Chap. X. Sect. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> we
<PB N="9" REF="002744_0010_0FE61FE2A71DC370"/>
claim a kind of Parental Power in the Church. — Yet we confess, our Authority is not Legislative, but Executive; not of a carnal, but spiritual Nature: not coercive, but suasory and rational; not solitary, but social, to be exercised (ordinarily at least) in the presence and with the Consent of the Church.</P>
<P>Neither do we pretend to exercise Pastoral Govern∣ment in any other than the <HI>particular Churches,</HI> which we are called to the oversight of; even as the Heads of Families extend not their parental Power beyond the Limits of their particular Charges. — Nor do we submit to any <HI>Foreign Jurisdiction,</HI> in Affairs Spiritual and Ecclesiastical. We are for Com∣munion of Pastors, &amp; Communion of Churches in all the Offices of Brotherly Love &amp; Neighborly Care and Assistance, <Q>for their mutual Good and Edification, according to Capacity &amp; Opportunity.</Q> Our venera∣ble <HI>Synods</HI> have very much inculcated the careful preserving of Church-Communion. Nevertheless They hold that <Q>Every Church or particular Congregati∣on of visible Saints, in Gospel-Order, hath full Power Ecclesiastical within it self, and is not un∣der any other Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction whatso∣ever. From whence they think it follows, that Consociation of Churches is not to <HI>hinder</HI> the ex∣ercise of this Power, but by Counsel from the Word of GOD to direct and strengthen the same upon all just Occasions.</Q> Thus the Synod in 62. — So the Platform observes, <Q>Churches [which im∣plies the Pastors] are distinct, and therefore may not be confounded one with another: and <HI>Equal,</HI> and therefore have not Dominion one over an∣other.</Q> — Indeed they look upon particular Churches to be as distinct, equal and independent, as
<PB N="10" REF="002744_0011_0FE61FE463B07980"/>
particular Families: and think <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Fathers</HI> agree in this, that as these in their Domestick Ca∣pacity, so those in their Ecclesiastical Character, have no Preheminence or Authority one over another. The Title of <HI>Father in God,</HI> they look upon as the com∣mon and undistinguish'd Character of every Bishop and Pastor; and the Divine Commission they act upon, as forever one and the same: which necessarily sets them all on a Level, supersedes all pretences of an unequal Authority, and forbids any <HI>Strife among them which of them should be Chief.</HI> — Now, let the Sense of the Dignity and Authority of our Office, only serve to inspire us with a just Solicitude, to se∣cure the Reverence due to our high Calling, by a sutable Conduct in it, and not expose it to the con∣tempt of the Profane, by doing things unworthy of it. And let the only Contention among <HI>us</HI> of this Order be, <HI>who</HI> shall make the fullest proof of his Mi∣nistry, and in the most real &amp; noble Effects of Love, approve himself a Spiritual Father to his People. We should be more Studious to deserve than to assert the Honour due to our Sacred Calling; and should take Pleasure (with the Apostle) even in Reproches and Necessities for Christ's sake. — I am become a Fool in glorying: Ye have compelled me. Where∣fore, tho' I should boast somewhat more of our Au∣thority (which the Lord hath given us for Edifica∣tion, and not for Destruction) I should not at all be asham'd.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>When Ministers are called Parents, it points us to the excellent</HI> End <HI>of their Institution, and pro∣claims the</HI> Importance <HI>and</HI> Usefulness <HI>of this Order of Men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002744_0012_0FE61FE46C3CD828"/>This Character leads us to the noble Design of their being set in the Church, which is, that they may seek the Good of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> all their Days, and be singular Blessings to their Generation. For such is the wise Parent in his Family, and to the World. Vast are the Benefits, unknown the happy Fruits of Parental Care and Love, under a due Regulation, and accompany'd with the Divine Benediction. A Parent has peculiar Opportunities to serve his Gene∣ration, by training up his Children in Wisdom and Virtue. Parents (as such) generally move in a Sphere very narrow; but yet of peculiar Importance to the Publick: and they often become diffusive Bles∣sings, by the good Education of their Children, and discreet Government of their private Charges. And both the Nature of their Relation, and the Intention of the GOD of Nature, render it necessary, that Pa∣rents study in this way to do signal Service to the World.</P>
<P>Hence this Title of Parents, given to Ministers, carries us back to the Original Design of their Office, <HI>viz.</HI> the Good of Mankind, and more especially of the People under their Charge. The Ministry surely was never instituted, merely that some Men might have the advantage to get a Living by it, or obtain a little Distinction and Power above others: But the primary Intention of it was, to be a Ministry under Christ, to the good of Souls; that such as are of this Order, might approve themselves <HI>Fathers</HI> to a Peo∣ple, in all Offices of Love to their Souls; and by pro∣moting Peace, Order, Virtue and Religion among them, become great Benefactors to the Publick. — This Style of Parents tells us what should be our main Inducement, in taking up this holy Calling;
<PB N="12" REF="002744_0013_0FE61FE6F6E26658"/>
and what the governing Aim of our Ministry ought to be, in all the Acts and Exercises of it, whether re∣ferring to Doctrine, Worship, or Discipline. It tells us what Blessings Ministers should Study to be, and what Blessings all faithful and wise Ministers in fact are, to a People: as Lights, to guide them; as Pillars and Foundations, to support them; as Fountains, to refresh them; as Shields, to defend them. Those two Characters were very agreeably united in the Lamentation of <HI>Joash,</HI> over the Prophet on his Death bed, <HI>O my Father, my Father, the Chariots of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof.</HI>!— As to particular Families, much of their Beauty &amp; Safety is bound up in the wise &amp; good Fathers at the Head of them. Even so learned and faithful Ministers are very much the Strength and Glory of a People. Hence the Apostle observes, that the Office of a Bishop is a <HI>good Work,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.1.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>This Title of Parents, give to Ministers, very much points out the</HI> Nature <HI>and</HI> Business <HI>of their Office.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not an airy Title of Honour, this of Parents; but is big with solid Duty, and implies abundant Business, Care, and Labour. You that are Parents, and have Families, are doubtless so sensible of the daily Returns of Duty, Toil, &amp; Fatigue, in the Paren∣tal Station, that you need not any Amplifications on this head, to illustrate the matter to you.</P>
<P>Agreeably the work of the Ministry is a great Work, and in some Places almost an immense La∣bour. Whatever many may think of it, 'tis no Idle or Easy Profession; but full of Services, laborious, painful, &amp; continually revolving. To which add the Consideration of their own Infirmities, natural as
<PB N="13" REF="002744_0014_0FE61FE7048E8100"/>
well as moral, being Men of like Passions with others; together with the perverse Humours of many proud and obstinate Sinners they have to deal with; &amp; the various Temptations that attend this Employment, from Satan, the Flesh, and World—. These Reflecti∣ons conspire (agreeably to this Character of Parents given Ministers) to proclaim the Difficulty of their Calling. And this Character may serve to inform us very much in the Nature &amp; Business of their Office. Here let me say distinctly,</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis the Business of Ministers to endeavour the <HI>Regeneration</HI> and <HI>Conversion</HI> of Sinners.</P>
<P>They may be called Fathers, as they are instru∣mental to propagate the Divine Nature, &amp; promote the New Birth of Souls. 'Tis on this Account that the <HI>Apostle</HI> stiles himself a <HI>Father</HI> to the Christians at <HI>Corinth,</HI> &amp; calls them his beloved <HI>Sons</HI>; for (says he) <HI>in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4 14, 15.</NOTE>. So he says to <HI>Philemon,</HI> I beseech thee for my <HI>SON Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds.</HI> — Hence the Gospel-Administration is call'd <HI>the Regeneration</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 19.23.</NOTE>. We are all by Nature Children of Wrath, Children of the Devil, a Seed of evil Doers. But GOD in the Riches of his Grace, seeking to him∣self a godly Seed, sent his only begotten Son into the World, that he should taste Death for every Man, and thereby recover us unto Life, Liberty &amp; Hap∣piness. For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect thro Sufferings. And now it pleaseth GOD by the Foolishness of Preaching to save them that
<PB N="14" REF="002744_0015_0FE61FEDC4E65948"/>
believe. We preach Christ crucify'd; and are not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the Power of GOD unto Salvation. 'Tis the grand means of begetting Souls to a spiritual Life. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.18. Of his own Will <HI>begat</HI> He us, with the <HI>Word</HI> of Truth. So 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.23. Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the <HI>word of God.</HI> There is a kind of propagatory Virtue in the Gospel of Christ, which is apply'd by the Spirit of GOD for the production of a spiritual offspring. The Word doth not produce the new Creature merely by its own natural Efficacy; but by the concurring Opera∣tion of Divine Grace on the Heart. 'Tis therefore called the Ministry of the Spirit: &amp; we are said to be born of the Spirit; yet also to be born again by the Word, and Ministers are said to beget us through the Gospel. — Hence then (in a remote and low and improper sense) the Character of Parents may be apply'd to Ministers, as they are Instruments in the Conversion of Sinners: and the Converts of Sion may in a subordinate sense be call'd their Sons &amp; Daugh∣ters. <HI>"Aaron</HI>'s Sons (as one observes) are call'd the Generations of <HI>Moses,</HI> as well as <HI>Aaron</HI> (Numb. 3.1.) tho none of his natural Sons are there men∣tioned — <HI>Aaron</HI>'s they were by natural Generation; <HI>Moses</HI>'s perhaps by a spiritual Regeneration and In∣struction"</P>
<P>The Work of Ministers is to turn Sinners to GOD thro' the Gospel; and thereby to raise up a spiritual Seed to Christ, their Elder Brother. — Not indeed that they can do this by any Principle or Power in them∣selves; nor may they attempt it in their own solitary strength, but must have their absolute Dependence on Christ, who said even to his Apostles (those emi∣nent
<PB N="15" REF="002744_0016_0FE61FEDCBE1E690"/>
Fathers of the Church) <HI>Without Me,</HI> Ye can do nothing. — In this matter of the New-Birth, verily a <HI>Paul</HI> is nothing; an <HI>Apollo</HI> is nothing; but all our Sufficiency is of GOD. 'Tis His sole Prerogative to give the Increase. — Thus even as to natural Birth, this is not in the power of Mortals: but its GOD that frameth our Bodies in secret, and formeth the Spirit of Man within him. Hear what good <HI>Jacob</HI> said to his discontented Wife, <HI>Gen.</HI> 30.2. <HI>Jacob's</HI> anger was kindled against <HI>Rachel,</HI> and he said, <Q>Am I in <HI>God's stead,</HI> who hath with-held from thee the fruit of the Womb!</Q> — So afterwards when his Brother <HI>Esau</HI> met him and his Flocks, and said, Who are those with thee? He answered, <Q>The Children which <HI>GOD</HI> hath graciously given thy Servant.</Q> Parents are only the Instruments (in some sense) of their Children's being: their Formation is of GOD the prime Efficient. — So as to the Renovation of Souls, this likewise is from GOD. The Saints are his Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus. Ministers are at best but mere Instruments in the hand of GOD. Yet <HI>being such,</HI> they may be called Parents, in regard of Those who thro' their Ministry are begotten and born to GOD. And to be Parents in this sense, is what they should continually aspire after. 'Tis one eminent part of their sacred Employment to labour the Conversion of Sinners, that they may become the Children of GOD by Faith in Christ Jesus! and so the Family of Christ be inlarged, by their being added to the Church.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their business is to <HI>provide for, nourish</HI> and <HI>feed</HI> the Children of GOD</P>

Livelihood. Thus, while in their helpless Infan∣cy, the Parents must carefully nurse &amp; cherish their tender bodies, and endeavour to supply all their wants. And during their whole minority, they should take care that they be well provided for, suitably to their age, quality, &amp; the like; should see 'em train'd up in some good and profitable Business, by which they may afterwards be able (if need be) to provide for themselves; and should study to lay up Something to leave as an agreeable Portion to them Hence the Apostle tells us in our Text, "The Parents ought to lay up for the Children This in∣deed is one of the fundamental dictates of Nature, as well as Religion. So that (as he observes elsewhere) If any Man provide not for his own, especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the Faith and is worse than an Infidel: — yea is lost to all natural Affection, &amp; become more vile than the very Brutes that have no understanding; who from an Instinct of Nature are very provident Caterers for their Young. Thus the <HI>Hen</HI> lovingly gathereth her Chick∣ens under her Wings, and with greatest Care and Industry feeds and cherishes her tender Brood, till able to provide for themselves. (Even the Sea-Monsters draw out the breast, and give suck to their Whelps.) Only the <HI>Ostrich</HI> of the Wilderness is cruel, who leaveth her eggs in the dust, forgetting that the foot may crush them, and is hardned against her young ones as tho' they were not hers. Unto which cruel Bird may <HI>he</HI> be liken'd, who provides not for his own. Surely such an one is more brutish than any Man, and has forfeited the name of Father. 'Tis one essential Property of a Parent to provide as well as he can for the comfortable Subsistence of his
<PB N="17" REF="002744_0018_0FE61FF44F213EC8"/>
Children. In this respect <HI>Job</HI> calls himself a Father to the Poor, and <HI>Joseph</HI> was made a Father to <HI>Pha∣raoh</HI> and his People. And this is alluded to, where the GOD of Israel saith, <HI>I have nourished and brought up children,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now in this respect Ministers are to act the part of Fathers toward their People, by providing &amp; dispen∣sing spiritual Food to them, for the strengthning and improving the Divine Life in their Souls. Their Duty is suggested in that precious Promise, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.15. I will give you Pastors according to mine heart, which shall <HI>feed you</HI> with Knowledge and Understanding. It was prophesied of Christ, <HI>Mic.</HI> 5.4. He shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord. — Even so Mi∣nisters are charged to do: See <HI>Act.</HI> 20.28. &amp; 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.2.</P>
<P>They must be nursing Fathers to the new-born Babes (Young and feeble Christians) and feed them with the sincere Milk of the Word (with easy plain Truths, first Principles of the Oracles of GOD) that they may grow thereby: for such have need of Milk, and not of strong Meat. In which we have the Apostle for an Example, who says, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.1, 2. <Q>And I Brethren, could not speak unto you, as unto spi∣ritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto Babes in Christ. I have <HI>fed</HI> you with <HI>Milk,</HI> and not with Meat, for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</Q> But then there are Christians stronger in the Faith, and more improv'd in Knowlege &amp; Grace, who should have a different Portion dealt out to them; as the same Apostle ob∣serves, <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.14. <Q>Strong <HI>Meat</HI> belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their Senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002744_0019_0FE61FF557748C10"/>Ministers are Stewards of the Mysteries of GOD, and should feed the Household with Food convenient; rightly dividing the <HI>Word,</HI> and giving to every one his proper portion, whether of Instruction, Reproof, Advice, or Comfort. And they should endeavour that all who (in a Judgment of rational Charity) have a right to the Children's bread, may be parta∣kers of <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI>: and by the dispensation of these Ordinances, as well as of the Word, they are to feed the Flock of GOD, &amp; confirm the Souls of the Disciples.</P>
<P>They should continually be either distributing the Bread of Life to Souls, or preparing the sacred Food. They must by daily Study and Prayer be <HI>laying up</HI> in Head and Heart a Treasure of Knowledge, that they may be able with the good Householder to bring forth things both new and old. They must look well to their <HI>Preparations</HI> for the Pulpit; that they don't starve the Souls of their People, with de∣ceitful meat, and unprofitable Trash; but nourish them up with substantial and agreeable Food (with sound Doctrine, with wholesome words) even as a Father cherisheth his Children — Moreover, as Pa∣rents know how to give good Gifts to their Children, and usually leave to them some special Tokens of their Love, for a Memorial of 'em, when they are gone: so should Ministers be ready to impart spiri∣tual Gifts unto their People (to the end that they may be established) by Spreading Books of Piety among them, as they are able, and therein make provision for coming Generations, as well as for the present. Agreeably thus saith the Apostle, 2 Pet. 1.15. <HI>I will endeavour that you may be able after my Decease, to have these things always in remembrance.</HI>

Nature, as well as Religion, teaches us to consult the Benefit of Posterity, and lay up in Store for these that shall come after us. <HI>A good Man</HI> (its said) <HI>leaves an Inheritance to his Children.</HI> The best En∣tail is <HI>Religion,</HI> which relates to the Soul, the better Part. The Soul is the Man: and Provision for that is the most excellent Provision, most worthy the Care of natural Parents, and in a peculiar manner of Ec∣clesiastical Fathers, whose special Employment is to promote the Welfair of Souls.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis their business to <HI>instruct, inspect,</HI> &amp; <HI>govern</HI> the Family committed to their Charge.</P>
<P>'Tis the Duty of Parents to <HI>instruct</HI> their House∣hold, both in the Things which concern the Life that now is, and in those which relate to the Life that is to come. They must see that their Children be taught some useful Art, Trade, or Employment, and impart to 'em as much as is proper of the Know∣ledge of this World. But above all, it's of indispen∣sable obligation on Parents to teach their Children the Fear of the Lord, &amp; instruct them in the Know∣lege of Christ, whom to know is Life eternal. They must walk in their Houses <HI>according to Knowlege</HI>; being themselves well acquainted with theit Bibles, and ready to communicate their Knowlege to their Children, that every one of them may (with <HI>Timo∣thy</HI>) from a Child know the Scriptures, which are able to make them wise unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Christ Jesus. They should in a solemn manner daily read the sacred Writings to their Fa∣milies, as valuing the Word of GOD more than their necessary Food. They should also frequently Ca∣techise their Children (instilling into them the Ele∣ments of Religion) so long as they are such as have
<PB N="20" REF="002744_0021_0FE61FFF040966C8"/>
need of Milk. They should also by Familiar Dis∣course from time to time (as they are able) open to them the Scriptures, while they walk by the way, or sit in the House, when they lie down, and when they rise up, giving them Line upon Line, here a little &amp; there a little. — And as they come to riper Age, must proportion and adapt their Instructions to their growing capacity.</P>
<P>Even so <HI>Ministers</HI> are set in the Church to be <HI>Teachers.</HI> And they must teach their larger Fami∣lies, in all the forementioned ways; giving attend∣ence (with <HI>Timothy</HI> to Reading, to Exhortation, and Doctrine. The Priests Lips should preserve Know∣lege, and dispense it. But this having been glanc'd at under a former Head, I shall only observe here, that on this account Ministers may be called Fathers, and their People their Children. We are apt to vene∣rate them as our Fathers, that have the Tuition and Instruction of us. The Term seems to be apply'd in this sense, to the Young Levite, <HI>Be thou a Father</HI> (i. e. a Teacher) <HI>and a Priest unto us.</HI> For 'twas the business of the Levites, to teach the good Know∣lege of the Lord. In <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.21.22. <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>In∣structour</HI> are us'd as equivalent Term. So Mat. 23.9. <HI>Call no man your Father upon Earth</HI>; Yield not an implicit Faith to the most learned <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur</HI> in the World; submit to no man as an infallible Guide. Father seems there to be put for Master or Instructor. Hence that phrase, <HI>The Sons of the Prophets,</HI> i. e. their Disciples or Scholars.</P>
<P>But further, Parents have also an <HI>Inspection</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> over their Children, to keep peace and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to restrain, reprove, correct, advise &amp; charge: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must not only keep up Family Instruction▪ but
<PB N="21" REF="002744_0022_0FE61FD2082C1A20"/>
likewise Family-Government &amp; Discipline must be duly maintained. It was utterly a Fault in <HI>Eli,</HI> that when his Sons made themselves vile, he restrained them not. And alike negligent was <HI>David,</HI> of his Son <HI>Ado∣nijah,</HI> concerning whom we read, His Father had not displeased him at any time, in saying, Why hast thou done so? — No wonder then that he exalted himself in the manner he did, to supersede &amp; dethrone his in∣dulgent Father. Most of the Confusions &amp; Miscar∣riages in Families are owing to the Parents faulty Negligence, &amp; Imprudence, &amp; Unfaithfulness. No Society can well subsist without Government &amp; Or∣der; and as the best way to maintain Authority in Families, is to advance &amp; keep up Religion in it: so Parents should apply their Authority to promote Re∣ligion in their Houses by all possible methods of Wis∣dom. The Light of Nature teaches us, that every Man should bear Rule in his own House: and Reli∣gion teaches us, that <HI>there is no power but of God.</HI> They therefore who are Heads of Families, should employ their Authority <HI>according to the will of God,</HI> and be a Terror not to good works, but to evil. They shou'd countenance Virtue, and discourage Vice, as much as possible, in their Families; resolving every one with <HI>Joshua,</HI> As for me and my House, we will serve the Lord. They should (with <HI>Abraham</HI>) com∣mand their Household to keep the way of the Lord: and when Correction may be needful, they must re∣solutely apply this wholsome Remedy, and not <HI>spare the Rod</HI> Behold, this is to bring up their Children in the Nurture &amp; Admonition of the Lord. 'Tis but agreeable to the Conduct of God towards his Chil∣dren. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.14. I will be his <HI>Father,</HI> and he shall be my Son: if he commit iniquity, I will <HI>chasten</HI> him
<PB N="22" REF="002744_0023_0FE62042CA0936C0"/>
with the rod of Men, and with the stripes of the Chil∣dren of Men.</P>
<P>And even so Ministers, who are said to be Rulers over the Household, should study to approve them∣selves Fathers to their People, by a due exercise of their Pastoral Authority, in all proper acts of Govern∣ment &amp; Discipline, agreeable to their Divine Com∣mission.</P>
<P>Thus they must <HI>invite</HI> &amp; <HI>admit</HI> into the visible Fa∣mily of Christ, by Baptism, and unto the Table of the Lord, such as are meet &amp; proper Subjects of these holy Ordinances, and only such; careful to keep out of his House ill Servants, left the Children shou'd learn their ways, and get a snare to their Souls.</P>
<P>They must <HI>watch</HI> over them that are committed to their Charge; take heed unto themselves, and to all the Flock; watching for their Souls, as those that must give an Account.</P>
<P>They must exercise their power and shew all good fidelity in <HI>reproving</HI> Sin; rebuking (where there is occasion for it) with <HI>all Authority,</HI> as a Father doth his Children, when he sees them do amiss.</P>
<P>They are also to <HI>warn</HI> and admonish. I Cor. 4.14. <HI>As my beloved sons, I warn you.</HI> Private Christians may, yea, shou'd (and I wish they did more faith∣fully) reprove &amp; warn one another: But then They do it merely in a war of Charity &amp; Brotherly Kind∣ness. Whereas Ministers act herein as publick Offi∣cers, and their Reproofs &amp; Admonitions carry some∣thing of a Paternal Authority with them. Thes. 5.12. <HI>Which are</HI> over <HI>you in the Lord, and admonish you.</HI></P>
<P>They are also to <HI>command</HI> &amp; charge. So their In∣structions run,— <HI>These Things command &amp; teach; — Charge them that are rich in this world</HI>;— Put them
<PB N="23" REF="002744_0024_0FE62042D24F9388" MS="y"/>
in remembrance, <HI>charging them before the Lord.</HI> Indeed when they command or charge, it must be only in the Name &amp; Cause of CHRIST, our common Head and Master. They are to be obey'd only (as Chil∣dren are requir'd to obey their Parents) <HI>in the Lord</HI>: and therefore they must keep close to the Word, as their Directory, &amp; take all their Charges &amp; Injuncti∣ons out of that, &amp; give them forth as the Commands of Christ.</P>
<P>Moreover, They are to <HI>excommunicate</HI> impenitent scandalous Offenders. Them that so sin, they are to <HI>rebuke before all,</HI> that others also may fear; &amp; after the first &amp; second Admonition, <HI>reject.</HI> The Apostle directs the Church at <HI>Corinth</HI> to <HI>put away from among themselves</HI> a wicked Person that had defiled their Communion. They were to do it by their <HI>Elders</HI>; unto whom it belongs by Office to exercise that Pow∣er, with the Concurrence of the Brethren. By their hand the Keys are to be turn'd, both in opening and shutting the Doors of GOD's House.</P>
<P>Again, They are to <HI>restore</HI> him that is lapsed, up∣on his Repentance; take off the Sentence &amp; Punish∣ment which was inflicted of many, &amp; forgive and comfort him, as tender Parents welcome home a re∣turning Prodigal.</P>
<P>In a word, They are both to exhort and convince <HI>Gainsayers,</HI> and stop the Mouths of unruly and vain Talkers &amp; Deceivers, who resist the Truth, &amp; sub∣vert Souls. Some they must rebuke sharply, that they may be sound in the Faith, or at least may pro∣ceed no further: while on others they must have Compassion, in Meekness instructing them. They must endeavour by sound doctrine to recover such as are fallen into Error, to establish the wavering, to
<PB N="24" REF="002744_0025_0FE6204B5CC1EC58"/>
support the feebleminded, &amp; build them up on their most holy Faith. — But I conclude this head with that of the Apostle, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.11. <HI>You know how we exhoried and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his Children.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Ministers are to <HI>bless</HI> their People, and to <HI>pray with and for them</HI>: and in this perform the part of Parents toward them.</P>
<P>Parents, and in special the Fathers, are to go be∣fore their houses in Divine Worship, &amp; be their mouth to GOD in Family-Prayer, as well as his Mouth to them in Family-Instruction. These are Duties taught us by the Light of natural Reason, &amp; enforced by the Laws of reveal'd Religion. And in the order of Nature it belongs to the Parents to lead in religi∣ous Exercises. They whose province it is to guide the House, &amp; preside in the secular Affairs of it, shou'd also go before the Family in the things of GOD. Every Master is as well a Priest to his house, as a little King &amp; Prophet. The Father in old time, be∣fore the Institution of distinct Orders among Men, sustain'd this threefold character, &amp; offer'd Sacrifices, as well as bare Rule, &amp; taught within his own walls. And in Acts of natural Religion (such as Prayer) he so far still remains a Priest unto GOD, that he must lead his family in the spiritual Sacrifices of Prayer &amp; Praise; which should, as the continual burnt offering, be presented daily morning &amp; evening. We find the Patriarch <HI>Abraham,</HI> wherever he pitch'd his Tent, building an <HI>Altar</HI> (a Family-Altar) &amp; serving at it, in his own person. We read also of <HI>Job</HI>'s sancti∣fying his Children, by burnt-offerings according to the number of them all. Thus (its said) did <HI>Job</HI> continually. — It is spoken of <HI>David,</HI> as what was
<PB N="25" REF="002744_0026_0FE6204B63CA3370"/>
his Custom, after the Translation of the Ark, that he returned to <HI>bless his Household.</HI> — And it is required of Masters, as they would give to their Servants that which is just &amp; equal, that (knowing they themselves also have a Master in heaven) they <HI>continue in Pray∣er, praying TOGETHER</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Col. 4.3. i. e. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> — Compare 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4 17. &amp; <HI>chap.</HI> 5.10. where the same word is translated <HI>Together.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In like manner, Churches being a kind of larger Households, in which Ministers are spiritual Fathers, they are to bless these their Ecclesiastical Families in the Name of the Lord; to pray for them in their Closets, and to pray with them in private on special occasions as they are called (see <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.14.) but more espe∣cially in the publick Congregation. Of old the Lord separated the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> to stand before him &amp; to <HI>bless in his Name.</HI> And this makes a part of the Office of Gospel-Ministers also. Tho' we don't (that I at present remember) expressly read any where of the Apostles or first Ministers of the Gospel lead∣ing in the prayers of any publick Assembly: yet doubtless it was their Practice, &amp; seems to be inti∣mated in several places. — The Apostles do insert <HI>Benedictions,</HI> in their Letters to the Churches: and undoubtedly wherever they preach'd a Sermon, they pray'd with the Assembly, &amp; pronounced a Blessing on the Worthy. Even so should every Minister. They must lead in the Devotions of GOD's House; solemnly bless their People upon all proper Occasi∣ons, whether in publick or private, as well as make mention of them always in all their secret Prayers. They are oblig'd by their Office to give themselves to <HI>Prayer,</HI> equally as to the Ministry of the Word.
<PB N="26" REF="002744_0027_0FE61FFF0B6CA308"/>
And this is but what becomes the Character of <HI>Fathers,</HI> which they sustain. Thus the young <HI>Levite</HI> was a <HI>Father</HI> &amp; a <HI>Priest</HI> to the Tribe of <HI>Dan.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Ministers are oblig'd to be</HI> Examples <HI>of Religion before their People.</HI></P>
<P>Parents partake of the same Nature, which they propagate unto their Children: So Ministers should see to it that they themselves be real Instances of that viral Sanctity, which 'tis the grand business of their Office to promote &amp; spread in the World.</P>
<P>The Example of Parents carries a peculiar Force and Impression with it; which Reflection should make them ever solicitous to be exemplary in all their language &amp; demeanour before their Househould. And of the like Influence is the Example of Ministers. They therefore should study to teach Religion by their Practice as well as Doctrine; that the former adding Weight &amp; Efficacy to the latter, such as have not been wrought on by their Word, may be won by their good Conversation in Christ.</P>
<P>It is not only a moral duty of common obligation on Ministers with other Christian Professors; but seems given them in charge even as a part of their sacred Office, and an instituted Medium for the car∣rying on their Work to better advantage, That they be careful to set a good Example; which is the most Divine &amp; excellent, the most familiar, compendious and engaging method of Instruction — Hence if Ministers set a <HI>bad</HI> Example they are <HI>doubly</HI> guilty before GOD.</P>
<P>Ministers are (as Parents in the Family) in a somewhat <HI>elevated</HI> and <HI>conspicuous</HI> Station; they are as a City set on a Hill, which can't be hid. They
<PB N="27" REF="002744_0028_0FE6204C6D630C90"/>
lie very open to Observation, &amp; many Eyes are up∣on them. It is of no small Consequence therefore, that they walk circumspectly, &amp; be holy in all man∣ner of Conversation; So, they will shine as Lights in the World, &amp; diffuse benign Beams &amp; Influences; will adorn their Doctrine, &amp; make Religion appear with an attractive beauty &amp; lustre. Whereas, on the contrary, if they are vicious &amp; dissolute, their ill Example has a direct Tendency to stain the honour of the Gospel, to give a Reputation to Vice; to harden the Wicked, &amp; wound the Righteous Souls among their People. <Q>The wicked Lives of such will read loud Lectures of Atheism &amp; Irreligion, &amp; spread a deadly Infection, which wasteth at noon-day: while yet in their publick Discourses they may talk like Angels of light.</Q> If the Priests make themselves vile, the People will soon come to abhor the Offerings of the Lord.</P>
<P>I shall only add here; Persons are sometimes de∣nominated the <HI>Children</HI> of others, from their <HI>Resem∣blance</HI> &amp; <HI>Imitation</HI> of them. For this reason in part are Believers called the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> because they walk in his steps: &amp; he is call'd the <HI>Father</HI> of us all, as being an eminent Example of Faith to all Generations.</P>
<P>Hence then, Ministers are oblig'd by this character of Fathers, to shew themselves <HI>Patterns</HI> of good works. It is therefore expressly required of them, in the Scriptures, — That they be <HI>blameless, and of good behaviour</HI>; Lovers of hospitality; Lovers of good men; sober, just, holy, temperate; not given to Wine; not greedy of filthy Lucre; no Brawlers, no Strikers, not soon angry, not self-willed, neither carrying it as Lords, but being Ensamples to the
<PB N="28" REF="002744_0029_0FE62003A7FB7558"/>
Flock: Ensamples in Word, in Conversation, in Cha∣rity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity: fleeing all youth∣full Lusts; from which if a Man purge himself, he shall be a Vessel unto honour, sanctify'd, &amp; meet for the Master's use, &amp; prepared unto every good work. In particular no small stress is laid upon Ministers being Patterns for <HI>Family-Government</HI> &amp; Discipline: that they rule well their own Houses, having their Children in subjection with all gravity; for (saith <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI>) if a Man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the Church of GOD?</P>
<P>These are Apostolick Canons, of a Divine Original, unquestionably authentick; and do loudly bespeak entertainment with all that would approve them∣selves genuine Ministers of Christ, &amp; truly Fathers to their People.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> For all these ends, they must <HI>personally reside</HI> among their People, as Parents dwell with their Children &amp; Family. The Apostle would have Mothers to love their Children, to be discreet, keepers at home, guiding the House. And Fathers are oblig'd to reside as constantly with their Families as possible. In allusion to this the names of Father &amp; Mother are sometimes made use of to signify intimate Commu∣nion &amp; Familiarity; as in <HI>Job</HI> 17.14 &amp; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.16. — 18. Even so Ministers should live among their People, that they may get acquainted with them, and know the state of their Flocks, in some measure as Parents know the state of their Families, &amp; have an intimate acquaintance with their Children. In populous places indeed, &amp; large Congregations, it is difficult to attain a personal knowlege of every In∣dividual. Yet the ends of the Ministry require that
<PB N="29" REF="002744_0030_0FE62003B087B0D8"/>
a Pastor be at least acquainted with the general state of his People▪ and he should seek after a parti∣cular Acquaintance, as far as he can, by careful in∣quiries, by pastoral Visits, by asking &amp; receiving Visits from them, &amp;c. that he may know their Soul-wants, &amp; be able to suit his spiritual Provisions to their various Appetites &amp; Capacities. Ministers must reside with their particular Charges; to the end they may watch for Souls; may inspect the Con∣versations of their People; may shine before them by the light of an holy Example, &amp;c. For these ends (I say) personal Residence is their duty; &amp; seems necessary, as they wou'd approve themselves worthy the Title of Fathers. It looks unnatural, &amp; a foul Incongruity in them, to be long or often needlessly absent from their Charges; much more to dwell stately at a remote distance; or finally leave them but upon the most justifiable &amp; important Reasons. The Reprimand may be apply'd in such Cases, that was given the Prophet, when he was out of his place, <HI>What doest thou here,</HI> Elijah?</P>
<P>But thus much for the third thing, The nature and business of their Office. I come now to another general head.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>This title of Parents or Fathers, suggests to us some of the</HI> Qualifications, Gifts <HI>and</HI> Accomplish∣ments, <HI>that are requisite for the work of the Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>Men have sometimes this Title apply'd to them, in regard to their Age, their Knowlege, their Wisdom, Experience, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Seniority</HI> gives this Denomination. Hence the Apostle begins his Apology (Act. 22.1.) with those distinct Compellations, <HI>Men, Brethren, and Fathers.</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="002744_0031_0FE6200C98FA60F0"/>
Now, in this application of the word, Some in the Ministry are emphatically <HI>Fathers,</HI> &amp; have a distin∣guishing right to the Name, by reason of their ven∣erable Hoary Head. And tho' these are not the on∣ly Persons intitled to that Character, &amp; tho' advan∣ced Age is not requisite to the Ministry; yet let me take occasion to say here, It seems the highest Pro∣priety, that Persons be able to write <HI>Man,</HI> and be arriv'd to years of Maturity &amp; Solidity, before they assume this Office &amp; Character.</P>
<P>Under the <HI>Levitical</HI> Dispensation, only <HI>middle-ag'd</HI> Men of the Tribe of Levi were employ'd in the Ser∣vice of the Tabernacle. The Limits were from 30 years old to 50. — I shall offer an Account of this matter, in the words of Mr <HI>Henry,</HI> (in his Exposi∣tion upon <HI>Numb.</HI> 4.) <Q>Of the other Tribes, those that were number'd to go forth to <HI>War,</HI> were from 20 years old &amp; upward, but of the <HI>Levites</HI> only from 30 to 50: for the Service of GOD requires the best of our Strength, &amp; the Prime of our Time, which cannot be better spent than to the Honour of Him, who is the First &amp; Best. And a Man may make a good Soldier much sooner than a good Minister. They were not to be employ'd till they were 30 years old, because till then they were in danger of retaining something childish &amp; youth∣ful, &amp; had not Gravity enough to do the Service, and wear the Honour of a <HI>Levite.</HI> At 25 years old they were enter'd as Probationers, <HI>Num.</HI> 8.24. and in <HI>David's</HI> time (when there was more work to be done) at 20. But they must be 5 years learning, &amp; waiting, &amp; so sitting themselves for Service: nay in <HI>David</HI>'s time, they were 10 years <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> preparation, from 20 to 30. <HI>John Baptist</HI> be∣gan
<PB N="31" REF="002744_0032_0FE6200CA03F89F8"/>
his publick Ministry, &amp; <HI>Christ</HI> his, at 30 years old. — It is not in the Letter of it obliging to Gospel-Ministere now, as if they must not begin their Work till 30 years old: but it gives us two good-Rules. (1) That Ministers must not be <HI>Novices.</HI> 'Tis a work that requires Ripeness of Judg∣ment, &amp; great Stayedness; &amp; therefore those are very unfit for it, who are yet but Babes in Know∣lege, &amp; have not put away childish things. (2) That they must <HI>learn</HI> before they <HI>teach, serve</HI> be∣fore they <HI>rule,</HI> &amp; must first be <HI>prov'd</HI>; then let them use the Office, being found blameless.</Q></P>
<P>The Ministry is an Office of Authority: &amp; natural Decency requires, that such as execute it, be Men both in years, &amp; parts. Besides otherwise there will be danger of two things: (1) of their being bloated with <HI>Self-Conceit,</HI> with young <HI>Nadab</HI> &amp; <HI>Abihu,</HI> to their Ruin. Hence the Apostle inserts it in his Cha∣racter of a Bishop. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Not a Novice</HI>; lest being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condem∣nation of the Devil. And then (2) there will be danger of their falling into <HI>Contempt,</HI> as being but of Yesterday, &amp; knowing nothing.</P>
<P>The Ministry is a hard &amp; critical Work, &amp; of a superiour nature; &amp; such a work had need have a wise Head &amp; dextrous Hand to manage it. Verily it requires the best Furniture of Science, Prudence, Fortitude, &amp; Resolution, to supply all its occasions, and wade thro' its Difficulties. They hadn't need be very young, &amp; tender, &amp; unexperienc'd, that under∣take such a Work; which will many times exercise all the Strength, Skill, &amp; Courage of a <HI>Paul,</HI> a <HI>Cephas</HI> and an <HI>Apollos</HI> united. Sure I am, the whole time of Youth is little enough to be spent in preparatory
<PB N="32" REF="002744_0033_0FE6200DA8E7AA18"/>
Study, Prayer, &amp; Observation. — Let me pause here a little, and having first laid my hand on my own breast, permit me to say, — Many of us have rea∣son to reflect with Shame upon our Rushing into the Pulpit so young, so undisciplin'd, &amp; unfurnish'd: and all of us have too sad occasion to lament our Igno∣rance, Inexpertness, &amp; manifold Deficiencies.</P>
<P>I go on, —</P>
<P>Ministers had need be Men of good natural Powers; and these well cultivated by a liberal Education. It is requisite they be acquainted with the Tongues, Arts &amp; Sciences; &amp; have those measures of acquir'd Literature, which may advance them above the com∣mon Level, &amp; distinguish them from the Generality of their People, as much as Parents usually excell their Children in Knowlege. They had need be Men in Understanding; and especially should they be mighty in the Scriptures; that they may be apt to teach, &amp; able both to exhort &amp; convince. Else they little deserve the name of Fathers. For saith the Apostle, Every one that is unskilful in the Word, is a <HI>Babe.</HI> — They should be ready Scribes, well instruct∣ed to the Kingdom of GOD. They are call'd the Lights of the World. A Star without light, is not a greater solecism than a Minister without some good portion of Theological Learning.</P>
<P>Further, Another very important Requisite is Wisdom. — <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.42. <HI>Who then is that faithful and wise Steward</HI> —! These Ecclesiastical Fathers had need be persons of Wisdom as well as Fidelity: come to a virile Consistence &amp; Perfection in their Reason and Judgment; having a just Government of their Thoughts, Appetites, &amp; Passions; &amp; well verst in the Art of Business; knowing in Things as well
<PB N="33" REF="002744_0034_0FE6200DB09CAFD8"/>
as Words, &amp; having read Men as well as Books; e∣qually skill'd in Manners &amp; Principles; acquainted with the variety of critical &amp; perplext Cases that occur in the Ministry; &amp; understanding in the Times: that they may be able to manage their Affairs with Discretion; may know how to behave themselves in the house of GOD &amp; among his People; to apply properly to Persons of all Characters, of all Tempers and Conditions, &amp; to speak a word in Season upon all occasions. In these things wisdom is profitable to direct.</P>
<P>Moreover, (it deserves a special Remark) the Mi∣nistry is a <HI>holy</HI> &amp; <HI>spiritual</HI> Work, &amp; therefore calls for <HI>gracious</HI> Qualifications; requires no little Strength in Grace, &amp; Experience in vital Christianity. [An unexperienc'd Pilot is not a greater Absurdity than an unexperienc'd Minister.] Surely Ministers ought to be such as deserve the Name of <HI>Fathers,</HI> (in the Sense wherein 'tis us'd by the Apostle, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2.13.) in distinction from <HI>Young Men</HI> &amp; <HI>little Children,</HI> or more imperfect Beginners in Religion. — The Mi∣nister ought to be a Father, in regard of his manly Attainments in Grace; at least of <HI>full age,</HI> &amp; among those who by reason of <HI>Use</HI> have their Senses exercis∣ed to discern both Good &amp; Evil: — Not a <HI>Novice,</HI> a Weakling or Babe in Christ, of short Standing and little Proficiency in the School of Heaven; much less a Child of this World, an unsanctify'd Sinner, ini∣tiated only in the form of Godliness Sure I am, such an one must often necessarily be very aukward in his managements, &amp; scarce know how to deal with Souls in many cases; must needs be frequently put to a Stand▪ &amp; sometimes to the Blush, from a con∣sciousness of his own Ignorance &amp; Inexperience in
<PB N="34" REF="002744_0035_0FE620146A7F4D90"/>
Divine Things. — If the Minister be not an experi∣enc'd Christian, certainly he must make but a <HI>poor Casuist</HI>; an unsafe Guide, very uncapable to lead the Blind; an unsafe Physician, uncapable to apply to the Wounded in Spirit, with that skill, &amp; tender∣ness &amp; fidelity, which their condition requires. — The Minister had need be strong in Faith; rooted in Love; fill'd with spiritual Wisdom; under the governing power of Divine Principles, &amp; improv'd in all the Graces of the active &amp; pasive Life. — <HI>Otherwise</HI> he will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Compassion, a natural Care for Souls. <HI>Otherwise</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never have a due Jealousy for the Name of Christ, or a just Vigour in his Cause: <HI>Otherwise</HI> all his Zeal will be a false fire, at least a weak blaze, of short duration &amp; little service; and many times will prove a smoaky &amp; impure flame, full of noxious vapours, poison &amp; malignity: <HI>Otherwise</HI> he'l be soon shaken in mind, apt to sink under diffi∣culties, &amp; faint in his Work; or else be tempted to Unfaithfulness, &amp; securely sit down idle, doing the work of the Lord negligently, &amp; handling the Word of GOD deceitfully▪ — <HI>Otherwise</HI> (in fine) he will know nothing as he ought to know it; will think no∣thing, will speak nothing, will do nothing, in his Mi∣nistry, as he ought. There will not be that Spiritu∣ality, that Humility, that Life &amp; Affection, in his Prayers, his Sermons, &amp; other Performances, which becomes a spiritual Father.</P>
<P>It is a Reflection, pertinent to our purpose, which we have from one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Paschal.</HI></NOTE> of the greatest Masters of Thought in the last age, — That the <HI>Heart</HI> has its Arguments &amp; Motives, with which <HI>the Reason</HI> is not
<PB N="35" REF="002744_0036_0FE6201471615798"/>
acquainted. We feel this (says he) in a thousand in∣stances. It is the Heart, &amp; not the Reason, which has properly the Perception of <HI>GOD</HI> —. The Judgment &amp; Understanding have their proper Me∣thod: which is by Principles and Demonstrations. The Heart &amp; Affections have a Method altogether different. A Man wou'd expose himself very re∣markably, who should go about to engage our <HI>Love,</HI> by laying down, in a Philosophical Order, the Springs and Causes of that Passion." (Thus he) And agreeable is that Remark, from another Masterly Hand <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Bates.</HI></NOTE> "It is not composing a Sermon with ex∣quisite Art, &amp; the delivering of it like an Orator, that makes a Minister accepted with GOD: and usually such Sermons are without Profit to the Hearers. The sound of words only reaches the Ear: 'tis the Mind convinces the Mind, &amp; the Heart persuades the Heart. He that is burning in his own breast, will inflame others: but if there be no Celestial Fire in the Mi∣nister's breast, he speaks of Divine Truths without a deep Concernment; and a Cold Preacher makes a cold Hearer: So the Sermon is lost in the Air between the lips of the one &amp; the ears of the other. — Indeed (as we have the Remark from a like excellent Hand<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Bp. <HI>Hopkins.</HI></NOTE>) "GOD may feed his People, as He did <HI>Elijah,</HI> by a Raven; and make a cold Breath kindle the sparks of Grace in the Hearts of others. But yet such an one as speaks <HI>from</HI> the Heart, is most like to speak <HI>unto</HI> it. And it is commonly observ'd, That they are the Labours of such, that GOD most usually owns &amp; crowns with Success."</P>
<P>Thus you see that Ministers had need be truly
<PB N="36" REF="002744_0037_0FE620157A064750"/>
<HI>Men of God,</HI> endow'd with superior measures both of Gifts &amp; Graces, &amp; have that Wisdom, Weight, and Experience▪ which may justly intitle them <HI>Spiritual</HI> Fathers.</P>
<P>I pass now to another general Head.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>This title of Parents tells us what the</HI> Tem∣pers <HI>and</HI> Deportments <HI>are which do become Ministers</HI>; that they should express a <HI>Fatherly Spirit</HI> in their Ministry, and imitate the Conduct of wise, tender, and religious Parents.</P>
<P>The <HI>Name</HI> inscrib'd upon them must give Law to all their Powers, &amp; direct their Tempers &amp; Manage∣ments; that as they are Parents by Office &amp; Title, they may be such by Analogy &amp; in Fact. Now a wide Prospect opens before me here; and might I be permitted to expatiate, a great deal cou'd be said to profitable purpose. But I shall study to bring my Thoughts into a narrow Compass; &amp; the rather be∣cause I have somewhat prevented my self, by many incidental Hints I've mingled in the foregoing part of this Discourse. Yet I should hardly be just to my Text, if I did not allow the head we are now upon, a distinct Consideration. Suffer me then to say here.</P>
<P>(1) Ministers should <HI>bear</HI> all sutable <HI>Parental Affections</HI> toward their People.</P>
<P>They should be Fathers to their People in Affecti∣on. Love is the first &amp; most essential passion in a Parent. Our Children being so many parts of our selves (without a figure) we love 'em by a natural and almost invincible Instinct. And as it seems a property of Love to descend with the greatest force; so the Love of Parents is perhaps of all others the strongest, &amp; usually flows down in a resistless Tor∣rent
<PB N="37" REF="002744_0038_0FE6204C74974990"/>
of Benevolence, Zeal &amp; Solicitude. Hence if Ministers would shew themselves in truth Fathers to their People, their Breasts must be fill'd with Love, and flame with paternal Passions.</P>
<P>They must see to it that their Love be <HI>real</HI> &amp; un∣feigned, as that of Parents; not a painted blaze, but a living Reality. For it's possible there may be glittering Dissemblers (like <HI>Judas</HI>) who have not the least spark of sacred fire in their bosoms; but their hearts cold &amp; dead as a Stone, while yet some∣times all without may be flame &amp; heat.</P>
<P>Again, Their Love must be <HI>pure,</HI> &amp; without the the mixture of corrupt Aims; a free &amp; generous Pas∣sion, like that in Parents,; &amp; a spiritual Affection, kindled by motives of a heavenly extract, &amp; regulat∣ed by Divine Principles &amp; Designs. Not a general Philanthropy only, nor a Party-Friendship; not a mercenary &amp; sensitive Affection; a mere human Love, terminating in carnal Considerations; such as theirs, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.17. <HI>They zealously affect you, but not well</HI>; that is, not sincerely, or upon true &amp; genuine Views. All worldly Considerations are heterogenous Springs. Where <HI>Self</HI> only or mainly is concerned &amp; intended, the Love is of a false Original. We must be animated by the same Spirit with the holy Apostle, who says in our Text, <HI>I seek not yours but you: &amp; I will gladly spend &amp; be spent for your</HI> Souls <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">So it is in the Original.</NOTE> <HI>tho' more abun∣dantly I love you, the less I be loved.</HI> — It must be a Love to Souls, a Love to Christ in his People, &amp; a Love to them for Christ's sake. This is to love the Brethren with a pure heart.</P>
<P>Again, Their Love must be <HI>impartial▪</HI> as the love of parents generally is or should be. It must extend
<PB N="38" REF="002744_0039_0FE6201585C81A40"/>
to all their People, without exception, &amp; without re∣spect of Persons. Indeed it can't be exercised toward all exactly in the same manner &amp; degree without any distinction: this is neither possible, nor a duty. Yet it must be universal in its goodwill at least, &amp; not limited by any sinister Considerations. Suppose we have receiv'd Affronts &amp; Abuses; or suppose personal Defects in this &amp; the other; Deformity of Body, or (which is worse) a Crookedness of Temper; or Pover∣ty, Meanness of Condition; or a prevailing Unpro∣fitableness under our Ministry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet in none of these Cases is Love to be dispens'd with. It is a dan∣gerous thing for Ministers or Parents to want a hearty Affection to their Children or People, or to any of them. Corrupt Partiality has been the Bane &amp; Ruin of many Families &amp; Churches Unity &amp; Peace.</P>
<P>Again, Their Love must he <HI>fervent,</HI> like that of tender Parents. We are to love our Neighbors as our selves; &amp; yet are allow'd to love our Children in an uncommon degree. So Ministers should love all Men; but the People of their Charge, in a peculiar manner. Not contenting themselves with some little faint spark of Affection, they should endeavour to get their Hearts inspir'd with a burning Zeal, with Parental Ardours.</P>
<P>Moreover, It should be <HI>constant</HI> &amp; persevering. The Love of Parents is a natural Affection: &amp; what's natural, is fix'd &amp; durable. So Ministers should have a kind of natural Affection for their People; an ha∣bitual Love, an unperishing flame, which many wa∣ters can't quench.</P>
<P>In fine, It must be a very <HI>active</HI> Principle; reign∣ing over all the Powers of their Souls▪ &amp; producing all agreeable inward Motions, Desires &amp; Resentments.
<PB N="39" REF="002744_0040_0FE62019D82DB280"/>
What is it that a loving &amp; gracious Parent feels within? O the tender Sympathy &amp; Concern that fills his breast! The ardency of Desire! The vigour of active Pity! The painful Sensations, upon his Childrens Afflictions or Miscarriages! His Heart akes, his Soul melts &amp; bleeds out in Tears of Grief for them. — But O! the Joy &amp; Ravishment, upon their Prosperity &amp; good Conduct! <HI>A wise Son maketh a glad Father: but a foolish Son is the Heaviness of his Mother.</HI></P>
<P>Even thus should Ministers be affected towards their People. They should mourn over carnal Sin∣ners with parental bowels; anxious for them, as <HI>Kish</HI> for his son <HI>Saul,</HI> when he left the Care of the Asses, &amp; sorrowed for him, saying, What shall I do for my Son? — Where any appear obstinate &amp; dead in Trespasses &amp; Sins; they should be grieved for the hardness of their Heart, &amp; mourn for them as <HI>David</HI> for his <HI>Absolom.</HI> Their Souls should weep in secret places for them. — And where any are under Awaknings &amp; preparatory spiritual Dolours; these spiritual Parents should groan earnestly for their De∣liverance, &amp; as 'twere <HI>travel in birth,</HI> until Christ be formed in them. They should be inflamed with an holy impatient Thirst for the Convirsion of Souls; longing after them all in the bowels of Jesus Christ; that of <HI>Zion</HI> it may be said, <HI>This and that Man was born in her,</HI> under their Ministry. — And they should rejoyce in the Conversion of Sinners. The News of this should be to them, as Tidings to a Father, of the birth of a Child, filling his Heart with gladness. — Moreover, they should maintain a peculiar Esteem for the pretious Sons of Zion, &amp; Daughters of Jeru∣salem, accounting them the Excellent in the Earth,
<PB N="40" REF="002744_0041_0FE62019DFDD2678"/>
and calling them their <HI>own Bowels,</HI> as Paul speaks of his Son Onesimus. They should be full of peculiar Benevolence to such. So the Apostle, to the Corin∣thians, <Q>Our Mouth (says he) is open onto you; our Heart is enlarged. I speak as to my <HI>Children.</HI> You are in our Heart, to die &amp; live with you.</Q> It is one stroke in the Character of <HI>Titus</HI>'s Bishop, That he be <HI>a Lover of good Men.</HI> He should love their Persons, value their Society, take a pleasure in their Gifts &amp; Graces, &amp; Prosperity whether in Temporals or Spirituals. He should rejoyce with them that re∣joyce, &amp; weep with them that weep; "adopting their Joys &amp; Griefs." <HI>As a Father pitieth his Child∣ren</HI>; so should the Minister put on bowels of Com∣passion towards his People, be grieved for all their Trials, but especially mourn their spiritual Distem∣pers, Distresses, Fears &amp; Temptations; bearing a heavy pa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with them under their various Burdens. He should have a sharp sense of the Injuries done them; as a Parent resents the Abuses his Children receive. — He should be jealous over them with god∣ly Jealousy; as as pious Parent for his dear Child∣ren: afraid left by any means their Minds should be corrupted. So <HI>Lemuel's</HI> Mother; <Q>What my Son! And what the Son of my womb! And what the Son of my Vows.</Q> — Yet he should not nourish in himself a spirit of evil surmising, &amp; an unguarded Credulity, which are oft in the unhappy fountains of mischievous Prejudices &amp; Alienations: but in every ease be dispos'd to hope the best, as Parents of their Children, &amp; turn away his eyes from the dark side, as much as is consistent with rational Charity.</P>
<P>In a word, He should be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssess'd with a Parental Care for his People. Can a Woman forget her suck∣ing
<PB N="41" REF="002744_0042_0FE6201CA62A8DB8"/>
Child! Or can the Tenderness &amp; Vigilance of an affectionate Father be equal'd! He has his lov'd Chil∣dren ever on his Mind, &amp; all his Powers upon the wing, to seek their Good. And when natural Affect∣ion is sanctify'd by the grace of GOD, all the Springs of pious Concern are open'd, &amp; he is solicitous for their Souls, Day &amp; Night. Even thus should the Spiritual Parent bear his People upon his Heart, and grave them upon the palms of his Hands. Verily a <HI>careless Minister</HI> is a prodigious Solecism. The Apostle tells Timothy, A Bishop must be <HI>vigilant, &amp; take care</HI> of the Church of GOD. And he gives that Charge to the Bishops of Ephesus, <HI>Take heed</HI> unto your selves, and to all the <HI>Flock.</HI> — Watch &amp; remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night &amp; day with Tears. — The Bishop or spi∣ritual Father must watch in all things, as one that really has <HI>the Care of Souls,</HI> at heart. There must be a Care to know the State of his Flock; a Care to find out proper Methods for the promoting their spiritual Safety &amp; Prosperity; &amp; a Care to make a wise &amp; successful Application of the Means: An earnest Care (such as GOD put into the heart of <HI>Titus</HI> for the Church at Corinth) a Care to serve Christ and save Souls; this, this is the true Pastoral Care: &amp; must be found in all that would approve themselves in∣deed spiritual Fathers to their People.</P>
<P>Thus we have been looking into the hidden Man of the Heart, &amp; viewing the inward Frames of Spi∣rit, which agree to that sweet &amp; instructive Title of <HI>Parents,</HI> which Ministers are characterized by.</P>
<P>I go on now to say, —</P>
<P N="2">(2) They must study to illustrate the Beauty and Propriety of their Name, by all suitable Paren∣tal
<PB N="42" REF="002744_0043_0FE6201CADE8CAD8"/>
<HI>Conduct,</HI> &amp; outward Management, in their Office, and towards the People of their Charge.</P>
<P>Thus, they must assert their Character, by a <HI>dili∣gent</HI> Discharge of their Trust, in all the parts of it. Parental Love is a buisy restless Passion. What is it that the affectionate Parent will not do for his Chil∣dren! O the ardent Zeal that flows in his breast! The Vigour of Endeavour! The unweary'd Offices of Benignity! He'l gladly sit up late, &amp; rise early, to serve them, &amp; think nothing in his power too much to do for 'em. — Now, even thus should Ministers be active &amp; diligent in their Work, to shew before the Churches the proof of their Love, &amp; that their Care for 'em in the sight of GOD may appear to them. They must labour to do their whole work, the duty of the day in its day, according as every day requires. So far as the Ministerial Trust is neglected, they put off the Character of Fathers. — True Parental Love will (in proportion to the degree of its strength) put Life &amp; Activity into all their executive Powers, and make them ready to every good work; hating Sloth; impatient of Delays &amp; Hindrances, &amp; careful to redeem the Time. — And indeed their Work is such as calls for all their Vigour, Weight &amp; Applica∣tion. They had need to study hard, to read much, and think more, &amp; stick close to Business, the proper Business of their Post; attending continually on this very thing; giving themselves <HI>wholly</HI> to it, as was requir'd of <HI>Timothy.</HI> And suffer me to say here, For this end, they should endeavour the greatest <HI>Abstraction from the World,</HI> &amp; sit as loose to its con∣cerns as may be. Indeed the <HI>Apostles</HI> (we know) some∣times wrought with their <HI>own hands</HI>: but then it was only to supply their present Wants, in a time of pres∣sing
<PB N="43" REF="002744_0044_0FE62022A1C602E8"/>
necessity; which perhaps is almost the only case, wherein 'tis lawful for Ministers to employ them∣selves in worldly business; especially to that degree as to take them off much from their divide Employ∣ment. This is elegantly &amp; very justly compar'd to a <HI>Warfare</HI>: And the Apostle remarks to his Son <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI>; No Man that warreth, <HI>entangles himself with the Affairs of this Life,</HI> that he may please his Cap∣tain, that is, may be at leasure to attend, &amp; have skill &amp; will to execute his Orders, upon whatsoever Service he pleases to call him out. Now, to this end, it much more behoves the Minister, to banish all en∣snaring Earthly Cares and Anxieties out of his Mind, as much as possible. Hence the Apostles renounced the <HI>Deacons</HI> Office (a Ministration about Temporals) That they might give themselves <HI>continually</HI> to Pray∣er, and the Ministry of the Word: as finding by ex∣perience they must necessarily in too great &amp; unrea∣sonable a measure <HI>leave the Word,</HI> if they continu'd to serve Tables. (See, <HI>Act.</HI> 6.) — Few in the World are Men of that Capacity, Application, and Strength of Genius, as to be able to carry on a variety of Cal∣lings together. The Ministry before is ordinarily <HI>enough</HI> for any Man, to take up his whole Time, and exercise all his Powers. And then it being a <HI>spiritu∣al</HI> Work, that calls for the most heavenly &amp; divine Tempers, it seems (in its nature) to be not a little inconsistent with the tumultuous Cares of a <HI>Secular</HI> or <HI>Civil</HI> Employment. There is danger of our drink∣ing in a <HI>Demas-like</HI> Spirit, the Spirit of the World; if we needlessly immerse our selves in the Affairs of this present life. Ministers being Men subject to like Passions had need as well as others to beware of Covetousness; left the love of money, which is the
<PB N="44" REF="002744_0045_0FE62022A9BC0560"/>
root of all Evil, once insinuating it self into their breasts, this should gradually extinguish every Spark of Love to Souls; &amp; so the temporary Suspensions of their Ministry (in pursuit of the World) unhappily lead to a final Desertion of it; in Heart, if not in Practice. — But enough upon this particular.</P>
<P>Further, Ministers should endeavour to shew them∣selves Fathers, — by the exercise of all fatherly and manly <HI>Gifts</HI> &amp; <HI>Powers</HI> in the performing of their Office. They should study to shew themselves ap∣proved unto GOD, <HI>Workmen,</HI> that need not to be a∣shamed. — I have said before, <HI>what</HI> their Gifts shou'd be: I am now saying, they should sutably <HI>exercise</HI> them. <HI>Let no man despise thee: Neglect not the Gift that is in thee</HI>; was part of the Charge given <HI>Timothy.</HI> Thus, they should study to exhibit their <HI>Knowlege</HI> (sacred Knowlege) unto Edification, in all their Ministerial Performances; shewing themselves Men, &amp; Men of GOD, thôrôly furnish'd: or at least managing so, that their Profiting may appear to all. Again, They should study to exercise &amp; manifest <HI>Prudence,</HI> Skill, &amp; spiritual Wisdom: shewing them∣selves not only Men of Zeal, but Men of Thought, directed by rational Views, &amp; govern'd by wise Prin∣ciples; not indeed by the maxims of carnal policy, the wisdom of this world, but of the wisdom which is from above. This must sit Chief, &amp; chuse out their way for them; otherwise "Good Passions may sometimes carry them into bad Actions, or the best Actions be spoil'd by an irregular Management." Indiscreet luxuriant Fervour generally begins in mistake, proceeds in confusion▪ &amp; ends in mischief; or at best in disappointment. They had need exer∣cise all their Sagacity, Caution, Penetration, &amp; Judge∣ment;
<PB N="45" REF="002744_0046_0FE620248E68FED0"/>
to distinguish aright concerning Persons, Things, &amp; Times; to methodize their Affairs well; to improve the fittest Seasons; to chuse out the best Means, &amp; apply them with dexterity. — Thus, in their PRAYERS, they should use their best prudence; that these may be adapted to the common Edificati∣on; carry light, &amp; heat, &amp; order in them; be clothed with humble easy language; be accommodated to the occasion, &amp; the state of things, whether in pub∣lick or private; not in a doctrinal or historical Strain, but devotional; &amp; the Utterance duely proportion'd and adjusted to the place, matter of the prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So, in their SERMONS, they should study for sea∣sonable Subjects; most frequently inculcate the first and great Truths of the Gospel; not read Lectures of mere Ethicks, or deal in Politicks, or lay out their Labours on jejune Speculations, in barren Controver∣sy, or Arguments more nice &amp; subtle, than wise, or profitable, especially to popular Audiences. It's a just Remark of a celebrated Writer; "'Tis but a mean Character of a Man, that he says a great many fine Things." If a <HI>Son</HI> should ask Food of any of you that is a Father, will you feed him with Wind? If he ask Bread, will you give him a Stone? or if he ask a Fish, will you give him a Serpent? — If Mi∣nisters would not deal as unkindly &amp; unjustly with their People, they must preach <HI>the Word,</HI> the Truth as it is in Jesus; &amp; this in a <HI>manner</HI> adapted to the general capacity &amp; relish of their Audience, as much as may be. That's the best Preaching, which has in it most of the genius &amp; spirit of the Christian Re∣ligion; exhibiting it in its glorious principles, pre∣cepts, promises, &amp;c. Here's the bread of Life, to nourish Souls. <HI>Lord, evermore give us this Bread!</HI>—
<PB N="46" REF="002744_0047_0FE6202496511AB0"/>
But further, Ministers must use the greatest prudence in managing the affairs of <HI>Discipline</HI> &amp; Church-Go∣vernment; that all be done <Q>with gravity, without affectation; with zeal &amp; courage, without temeri∣ty; with authority, without usurpation:</Q> with fidelity, without rigour; with renderness, without indulgence; with a just distinction in differing cases, without a criminal partiality. — Finally, In <HI>Conver∣sation,</HI> they should be prudent; to set an unexcepti∣onable Example, &amp; avoid offence; should study for an agreable address, use all innocent arts to win and engage, to please &amp; profit together: endeavouring at once to act both the Christian &amp; the Gentleman, which will in many cases try all their Skill, &amp; put them to no little pains.</P>
<P>But I must not prevent my self from saying in the next place, —</P>
<P>They must shew themselves Fathers, by the con∣spicuous exercise of all those <HI>Graces</HI> &amp; <HI>Virtues,</HI> which may adorn their Character &amp; Relation. These must shine out, &amp; display themselves, in their whole Mi∣nistry &amp; Converse.</P>
<P><HI>Thus,</HI> They must express a Spirit of Seriousness &amp; Solidity. All kind of <HI>Levity</HI> is childish; very un∣seemly in Parents (who should study to make their presence venerable to their Children) but more so in Ministers. The Apostle rejects the thought of it with abhorrence, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.17. <HI>Did I use Lightness</HI>! They must be grave in the Pulpit, &amp; out of it; in their Garb, Mein, &amp; Language; in Doctrine shewing uncorruptness, Gravity, Sincerity; in Conversation using sound Speech, which can't be condemn'd; not indulging <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on Allusions, or frothy tri∣fling Witticisms &amp; foolish Jestings, which are not con∣venient:
<PB N="47" REF="002744_0048_0FE6202BF98F9880"/>
&amp; "in Manners, above the trivial puerile Customs &amp; loose Practices of a vain World"; not only keeping at the widest distance from grosser Immora∣lities &amp; Impurities, but also in some cases abridging themselves even of lawful Freedoms, that the Mi∣nistry be not blamed, &amp; that they may set the bright∣est Example of a shining Gravity. — I use this Epi∣thet, because true Gravity is a very distinct thing from cloudy sullen Reservedness, &amp; morose Dejection.</P>
<P>Again, There must be a spirit of Meekness, Pati∣ence, Humility &amp; Self-denial, appearing in their Conduct. 'Tis a Law upon Parents, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.21. <HI>Pro∣voke not your Children, lest they be discourages.</HI> Ex∣travagant Rigours towards Children are generally of pernicious Consequence; on the one band, break∣ing the hearts of the meek &amp; tender spirited &amp; mak∣ing them lie down in sullen despair &amp; neglect of duty: on the other hand, inflaming the more rough and passionate, &amp; tempting them to run into greater Outrages. Hence then Parents should see to it that they temper their Government with the meekness of Wisdom. And indeed it is the general Disposition of Parents to be indulgent, rather than severe. Hence it is drawn into comparison, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.17. <HI>I will spare them, as a Father spareth his own Son</HI> that serveth him. So in those words of <HI>Moses,</HI> Numb. 11.12. Have I conceived all this People? Have I begotten them? that Thou shouldest say unto, me, Carry them in thy bosom, <HI>as a nursing Father bereath the sucking Child!</HI> We that are Parents know what this means. Now Ministers should learn of tender Parents, to maintain &amp; express a Spirit of Candour &amp; Forbear∣ance towards their People. Thus the Apostle, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.7. We were gentle among you, <HI>even as a Nurse
<PB N="48" REF="002744_0049_0FE6202C04CDCC20"/>
cherisheth her Children.</HI> They should endeavour to shew all Patience under the Difficulties they meet with, from the Humors of Men, from the Infirmities of the Weak, the troublesome Follies of the Froward, and the base Requitals of the unthankful; puting the best Construction's, &amp; making all possible Allowances. They must be ready to deny themselves, &amp; comply with mean &amp; hard things sometimes, like Parents for their Children sake: as the Hebrew Servant, <HI>Exod.</HI> 21.5. <HI>I love my Children; I will not go out free.</HI> They must labour to exercise the true Spirit of <HI>Peace∣makers,</HI> studying to prevent &amp; compose all Diffe∣rences among their People; as Parents among their Children. They must endeavour to be cloathed with Humility; easy of access, affable, courteous, willing to condescend to men of low degree, &amp; stoop to the meanest Offices, proper for their Station; as Parents for their Children. They should smile on and countenance good Beginnings, &amp; not despise the day of small things, or disdain to speak to <HI>Babes.</HI> Nor affect to command, where Intreaties will suffice. Thus the Apostle to <HI>Philemon,</HI> says, Thô I might be much bold in Christ, to <HI>enjoyn</HI> thee that which is convenient: yet for Love's sake I rather <HI>beseech</HI> thee. And in dispensing Rebukes, they should endeavour that their Zeal may be regulated by Prudence, &amp; be such as consists with the Spirit of Meckness, consider∣ing themselves, lest they also be tempted. They should be willing to see &amp; own all that's good and commendable in every one; sometimes discreetly mixing deserved Praises, with their Reproofs and Warning [See an Instance of this in 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 1.4,—11.] I shall conclude this Head with a short Extract out of the Character given of a late <HI>eminently good and
<PB N="49" REF="002744_0050_0FE6202D0D17D268"/>
useful Minister</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Aged Mr. <HI>James Noyes,</HI> of Stonington in <HI>Connecticut.</HI> See his Funeral Sermon by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> of New-London.</NOTE> from whence we may form several wise Rules to our selves in the Conduct of our Mi∣nistry. Of him its said; <Q>He had a happy way of <HI>engaging</HI> People to be good, by <HI>supposing</HI> them to be so, &amp; treating them as such: for then they would be very much ashamed to disappoint his Expectations. — And He would sometimes try to disengage Men from a vicious Course, by laying himself under voluntary bonds of Self-denial for a time in things indifferent; that they might be encouraged the more to try to recover the govern∣ment of their unruly Appetites, while he bare them Company in their Abstemiousness, &amp; traced out the way for them to a more regular Life.</Q></P>
<P>Again, They should labour for a fervent Spi∣rit, &amp; discover all the lively passions of tender Fa∣thers, in Prayer &amp; Preaching, &amp; private dealing with Souls. Parental Love often puts all the Springs &amp; Powers of Nature in motion, and makes us even agonize sometimes in our Addresses to the Throne of Grace for our dear Children: we don't always content our selves with a transient cold Petition or two; we cannot rest in one perpetual lifeless Round of words; but, Nature helping Grace, our hearts sometimes grow hot within us, &amp; we pour out many &amp; very importunate Requests to GOD. Now in this, Ministers should strive to imitate natural Parents. Like <HI>Elias</HI> they should Pray earnestly: Like <HI>Epaphras,</HI> they should always labour fervent∣ly in <HI>Prayer,</HI> with a deep Solemnity, Warmth &amp; Vigour of Spirit — So in Preaching, a Zeal for Souls
<PB N="50" REF="002744_0051_0FE6202D1478B130"/>
should carry them out in pathetic Strains, animate their Utterance, &amp; inflame their Language. Both in the Study &amp; Pulpit, they should even strive for something of <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s <HI>Heat of Spirit,</HI> when the hand of the Lord was strong upon him. They shou'd speak as those that feel in themselves the heart of a Father, &amp; the bowels of a Mother; which often give most affecting Accents to parental Coun∣sels &amp; Instructions. <Q>It is requisite (as one <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> (my worthy Brother &amp; Class mate) in his Sermon at Mr. <HI>Green</HI>'s Ordination. <HI>pag.</HI> 13.</NOTE> gives us the excellent Remark) that their Hearts should be <HI>warm,</HI> &amp; that they should speak as those whose Lips are touched with a Coal from the Altar; because in Preaching there is intended a <HI>Com∣munion of Souls</HI></Q>. Hence the Apostle tells the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> He was willing to have <HI>imparted</HI> to them, not the Gospel of GOD only, but also <HI>his own Soul</HI>; — was desirous to inspire into them the same devout Passions that flam'd in his own breast; to communicate to them of the heavenly Spirit that rested on himself; that the same Mind &amp; Heart might be in them, that was in him. Ministers should in Preaching as 'twere breathe out their <HI>Souls</HI> to their People in the most sincere &amp; holy Fervours; in order to set <HI>their</HI> Hearts on fire, by the grace of GOD, &amp; bring them to be <HI>like-minded</HI>; not only almost, but altogether <HI>such as they are,</HI> in regard of the Christian Faith &amp; Life.</P>
<P>Moreover, They should be of good Courage, faith∣ful, resolute &amp; indefatigable in their Work. They must be faithful in personal Applications to Souls, and in publick Dispensations of the Word, deliver the whole Counsel of GOD, and keep back nothing
<PB N="51" REF="002744_0052_0FE62031D10262A8"/>
that is profitable. The Apostle observes to the Corinthians, — <HI>Great is my boldness of Speech to∣ward you—; I speak as to my Children.</HI> Parents don't use to mince the matter, &amp; balk duty, for fear of their Children; but deal plainly, &amp; speak home, &amp; do what they apprehend is best &amp; most ex∣pedient, however their Children resent it: Tho' in∣deed to maintain their Government, and restrain them from Disorders, they are sometimes oblig'd to put on all their Resolution, &amp; use the utmost Pru∣dence. Knowing that the Rod &amp; Reproof give Wisdom, pious Parents will not easily suffer them∣selves to be brib'd by their own Affections, to for∣bear administring them upon just occasions. Nor will they be soon weary of well doing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now even thus should Ministers, being animated &amp; go∣vernd by an unbias'd A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m at the Good of Souls, preach the Word, reprove, &amp; exhort with all Long∣suffering &amp; Doctrine; warning every Man with all fidelity, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. Tho' they dwell with Scorpions, im∣pudent Children &amp; rebellious; yet must not be afraid of their Words, nor dismay'd at their Looks. <HI>(Ezek.</HI> 2.4, 6.) Whatever Opposition they meet with in their Work; whatever Difficulties lie in their way, they must still go on, with an unchill'd Zeal, mas∣culine Vigour, &amp; incorruptible Integrity; above the Influence of worldly Fears or Hopes. Frowns or Charms; stedfast &amp; immoveable, &amp; always aboun∣ding in the work of the Lord. True Zeal is of a sanguine Complexion, bold in the pursuit of duty, and firm to it's point. It mocks at Fear, &amp; smiles in the face of Terror, as well as despises Flattery, and scorns all Discouragements. The Apostle speaks
<PB N="52" REF="002744_0053_0FE62031D807B008"/>
in the Language of Heroic Zeal, Acts 20.24. <HI>None of these things move me,</HI> neither count I my <HI>Life</HI> dear to my self, so that I may finish my Course with Joy — <Q>He cou'd embrace Chains, endure Hard∣ness, &amp; enjoy Miseries <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Steel</HI>'s Christian Hero.</NOTE> in prosecution of his Ministry.</Q> <Q>Opposition did not dispirit, but strength∣en his Resolution; and his great Heart, instead of fainting &amp; subsiding, rose &amp; biggen'd, in propor∣tion to any growing Danger which threaten'd him.</Q> Being strong in Faith; this carry'd him thro' Seas of Difficulties, &amp; kept him from sinking: this nourish'd in him the Flame of Love to Souls, so that the Floods could not quench it.— And now, If Ministers would approve themselves spiritual Fa∣thers, they must set themselves to copy after this great Pattern, in all faithful Zeal, unwearied La∣bours, &amp; inflexible Resolution. To this end, They must be concern'd to obtain <HI>like precious Faith,</HI> and live by the Faith of the Son of GOD, upon whom they intirely depend for Assistance, Acceptance and Success. They must lay out Faith &amp; Prayer for themselves &amp; their People, as godly Parents for Themselves &amp; Children. The Parents ought to lay up for the Children: and what better than a good <HI>Stock of Prayers,</HI> Prayers of Faith! The Parent's Breast should be a living Temple, wherein are dai∣ly offer'd up to GOD (on the Altar of CHRIST's Merits) spiritual Sacrifices for his Children, accor∣ding to the number of them all The Minister should go &amp; <HI>do likewise</HI>; being often on his Knees, and carrying his People to GOD in the Arms of an impor∣tunate Faith; casting them upon Him who careth for them.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="002744_0054_0FE62051C8F4F800"/>Thus we have seen something of the Duty of Mi∣nisters towards their People, resulting from the Character of <HI>Fathers</HI> apply'd to them. I have been much longer here than I design'd. I shall hasten now to the last general Head of Discourse; after I shall have added this one Hint, That these spiritual Fathers should study to maintain <HI>Brotherly Love</HI> &amp; Corre∣spondence among themselves, by mutually exchang∣ing all the Offices of good Neighborhood.</P>
<P>It remains now to observe in the last place.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Apostle in our Text compares the <HI>People</HI> to <HI>Children</HI>; which is a very natural Consideration of them, if Ministers bear the Character of Parents. And from hence they may learn much of the Duty they owe to their Ministers.</P>
<P>But here I shall do little more than hint at things: for I perceive the Time runs out faster than my Subject.</P>
<P>This tells People that they should <HI>honour</HI> their spi∣ritual Fathers. <HI>A Son honoureth his Father.</HI> And agreably it is requir'd, that faithful Elders be <HI>count∣ed worthy of double honour</HI> (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17.) treated with a kind of filial Respect, especially by the People of their Charge, who are commanded to obey them in the Lord, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17.) in as express words as the <HI>fifth</HI> Commandment. It's an Apostolick Canon (at least applicable) in this Case — <HI>Rebuke not,</HI> that is (accord∣ing to the notation of the original word) don't satyri∣cally lash <HI>an Elder, but intreat him as a Father.</HI> — However mean their Persons &amp; outward Condition, yet 'tis a venerable Character &amp; Commission they bear; &amp; this surely should screen them from all Insult, Contempt, — Outrage. It was a mournful Complaint, of old, The Son dishonoureth the Father, &amp; a Man's
<PB N="54" REF="002744_0055_0FE620339EC49258"/>
Enemies are the Men of his own House. — But let it not be so in the House of GOD. We have had Fathers of our Flesh, &amp; we gave them Reverence: shall we not also be in Subjection to those who under GOD are our spiritual Fathers! They should be respected <HI>as such,</HI> whether they be younger or older. Let no Man despise their <HI>Youth,</HI> especially if adorn'd with Wisdom and Gravity: Much less throw Contempt on the <HI>Hoary</HI> Head, thô grown weak &amp; infirm. Thou shalt honour the face of the old Man, &amp; not despise thy Father, when he is old. — During the whole Time of their Continuance in the Pastoral Relation, their People ought to honour them particularly by a just Requi∣tal of their Labours, in a sutable <HI>Maintenance.</HI> It is requir'd of Children (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.4.) that they learn to shew Piety at home, &amp; to <HI>requite their Parents</HI>: for this is good &amp; acceptable before GOD; &amp; is due by all the Laws of Gratitude &amp; Equity. Even so hath the Lord ordained, (<HI>Gal.</HI> 6.6.) that <HI>they who are taught in the word should communicate unto Him that teacheth in all good things.</HI> Who planteth a Vineyard (saith the inspired Apostle 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7,—11.) &amp; eateth not of the Fruit thereof? And <HI>if we have sown unto you spiritual Things, is it a great matter if we shall reap of your carnal things</HI>? Besure if we reap but sparingly (as 'twere the young <HI>Levite's</HI> Portion, which he had of <HI>Micah</HI> (<HI>Judg.</HI> 17.10.) who seems to have intended to make up in honorary Titles, what he fell short in Wages) it ought not to be grudg'd to us. They that reap bountifully, receive but a just Reward. And after all, give me leave to say, the best Salary is no proportional &amp; adequate Recompence for the Be∣nefit receiv'd by a faithful Ministry. Yet the Boun∣ties &amp; Kindnesses of our People to us, we would ac∣cept
<PB N="55" REF="002744_0056_0FE62033A5C962B8"/>
always, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with all Thankfulness: <HI>Albeit we do not say how they owe unto us even their</HI> OWN SELVES <HI>besides.</HI> (<HI>Philem.</HI> 19.) But these are very tender Points; therefore I pass to say, —</P>
<P>That People should bear a filial <HI>Benevolence,</HI> and express a sutable <HI>Affection</HI> to their spiritual Fathers. And indeed we value a real Interest in your Hearts, above all the external Honours you can do us We are ready to bespeak you, in the words of the Apostle (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11, 12, 13.) <Q>O ye People, our <HI>Mouth</HI> is open unto you, our <HI>Heart</HI> is enlarged. Ye are not strait∣ned in us, but ye are straitned in your own Bowels. Now for a Recompence in the same (I speak as to my Children) <HI>Be ye also enlarged,</HI></Q> and repay us the like Affection, it being but reasonable for Chil∣dren to recompence their Parents Love, with all pos∣sible Returns of Love &amp; Duty. He that is without natural Affection to his Parents, has put off the Man, and is become more vile than the very Brutes that have no Understanding. Alas! It is a most guilty Thing for Children to indulge Disaffection &amp; Preju∣dice against their Parents. So is it in People against their spiritual Fathers: concerning whom it is requir'd that you <HI>esteem them very highly in Love</HI> for their Work's sake, 1 Thes. 5.12. And indeed as Love to Parents is a first Principle deeply rooted in the Na∣ture of Man; so where any are truly begotten to GOD thrô the Gospel, they will by a kind of natural Instinct value &amp; love their spiritual Fathers. Their Love to Christ, to his House &amp; Sabbath &amp; pretious Instituti∣ons, yea, &amp; to their own Souls, will powerfully con∣strain them. And a principle of Gratitude will have no little Influence upon every considering Christian. It is reported of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, that he was wont
<PB N="56" REF="002744_0057_0FE6203CB017A540"/>
to say, He was more beholden to his Master <HI>Aristotle,</HI> than to his Father <HI>Philip,</HI> because he had his Being only from the latter; but his Well-being from the former. And truly if Love be a Debt to our natural Parents as under GOD the Authors &amp; Preservers of our bodily &amp; temporal Life; we can owe no less to our spiritual Parents, who have begotten us by the Gospel, to a better being, to a spiritual &amp; eternal Life.</P>
<P>Now, if Christians wou'd shew their Love; Then,</P>
<P>In the first place, Let 'em prize the Society of their Ministers. Love is a Social Passion. Be not shy of your spiritual Fathers. Receive them in the Lord. So will they thank GOD, &amp; take Courage.</P>
<P>Again, Let People learn to value &amp; ask the Prayers and Blessings of their spiritual Fathers. So <HI>Elisha</HI> beg'd <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Blessing: &amp; the same afterwards did King <HI>Joash</HI> of him. Even a profane <HI>Esau</HI> sought his Father's Blessing with Tears. People should be ready upon all Occasions to ask the Prayers of their Mini∣sters. In particular it is directed, Jam. 5.14. <HI>Is any sick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him.</HI> Truly Brethren, we look upon it as a Slight &amp; Coldness towards us, if you will not send for us in such a Case.</P>
<P>Further, Shew your Love by a due Care not to grieve them by Contentions or other Scandals. Thus says the Apostle to his Galatians, <HI>My little Children,— let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one ano∣ther, envying one another.</HI> Let them have this Joy, to behold your stedfastness &amp; Order; to see you walk∣in the Truth, &amp; dwelling together in Unity.</P>
<P>Further, Shew your Love in faithfully asserting &amp; defending their good Names It is an express Com∣mand; Phil. 2.29. <HI>Hold such in Reputation.</HI> If they
<PB N="57" REF="002744_0058_0FE6203BA0A719B0"/>
be slander'd, you must vindicate them with a prudent Zeal. If they be evil spoken of, you must not receive the Accusation, but <HI>before two or three witnesses.</HI> So the Rule is express, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.19. —If you know them to be overtaken with a Fault, think of the Duty you expect from your Children in such a Case: and this will be a sufficient Directory. Or think of <HI>Shem</HI> &amp; <HI>Japhet</HI>; and take care you don't play an un∣godly <HI>Ham</HI>'s part, in exposing &amp; laughing at involun∣tary Stumbles, or accidental Falls. Love will teach you to cover such Things in Silence: and where any ap∣pear to indulge grosser Follies, Love will also teach you to observe it to them, with a respectful Sorrow, still intreating them as Fathers. (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.1.)</P>
<P>Moreover, Filial Love will teach you to follow their good Example. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.15, 16. In Christ Jesus I have <HI>begotten</HI> you thro' the Gospel: <HI>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye Followers of me.</HI></P>
<P>Again, True Love will teach People a due Confi∣dence in their spiritual Fathers faithful Care &amp; Con∣duct: and a Contentment with the wholesome Food with which they entertain them in the House of GOD; altho' perhaps it be not dress'd up in all the forms &amp; splendors that some others are treated with. True Love will teach People to adhere to their Ministry, and not desert it, upon every little Temptation.</P>
<P>Moreover, It will teach them to be constant &amp; af∣fectionate in Prayer for them; generous in Requi∣tals of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, love will teach People to mourn their Death, when GOD takes them from their head. These spiritual Fathers are mortal as well as other Parents. <HI>Your Fathers,</HI> where are they? and the Prophets do they live for ever? Christians shou'd often think of
<PB N="58" REF="002744_0059_0FE6203BA7BA1AE0"/>
this, while they are living; get all the Benefit they can by them, while they enjoy their Presence &amp; Help; &amp; get prepar'd for the parting time: Honour 'em at their Death, by suitable Lamentations; &amp; (may I not say?) also by a decent Burial. Even a mocking <HI>Ishmael</HI> cou'd join with his Brother <HI>Isaac</HI> in burying their Father <HI>Abraham.</HI> We read of <HI>Jehoiada</HI> the Priest, 2 Chro. 24.16. <HI>They buried him in the City of</HI> David, <HI>among the Kings, because he had done Good in</HI> Israel, <HI>both towards God, &amp; towards his House</HI> —.In a word, True Love will teach them to pay all becoming Re∣spects to their Memory. It is expresly requir'd, Heb. 13.7. <HI>Remember them which have spoken unto you the word of God.</HI> "It is ungrateful &amp; unkind (as one<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The late Rev. Mr. <HI>Stevens,</HI> in his Funeral Sermon for the Rev. Mr. <HI>Brattle</HI>; annex'd to his last Sermons.</NOTE> observes) <Q>to forget <HI>any</HI> Friend or Benefactor: and much more so, to forget our <HI>Fathers</HI> in the Church of GOD: —Their Names ought to be remember'd, — often spoke of, with Gratitude, Love &amp; Honour, for their Works sake. The <HI>Children</HI> (at least) of such spiritual Fathers shou'd <HI>rise up &amp; call them Blessed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But I draw now to a Close:</P>
<P>Let us reflect on the whole, — and then taking a View of our own Conduct, let us compare Things: see whether we have been acting up to our respec∣tive Characters; the People, as Children, &amp; Mini∣sters as Parents. And may we be humble before GOD for all our Failings &amp; Miscarriages towards each other! And let us all be concern'd to study the exactest Conformity to our several Characters, in our Deportment towards each other, both Mini∣sters
<PB N="59" REF="002744_0060_0FE62051D2DE6DD8"/>
&amp; People, as Remembring that we must give an Account unto GOD.</P>
<P>What has been said might be apply'd, by way of Caution &amp; Direction to the Candidates for the Mi∣nistry — And also to the Churches, to regulate them in the great Affair of chusing a Minister. Covet earnestly the best Gifts: And yet I shew unto you a <HI>more excellent way.</HI> Tho' one speak with the Tongues of Men &amp; Angels, &amp; have not the Love of GOD in him, &amp; a Love to Souls (the Heart of a true spiritual Father) verily he is as a sounding Brass, or a tink∣ling Cymbal.</P>
<P>But now to conclude in a short Hint to You, Brethren, who are the Occasion of our Convening here at this Time. I need not apply my self parti∣cularly to my <HI>Brother,</HI> who is this Day consecrating himself to the Ministry. The Things which are pre∣sently to be given him in Charge by another &amp; the proper Hand, will be sufficient. As he will give a hum∣ble Entertainment to the Honours &amp; Respects, which I have been claiming for him in the name of Christ and from his holy Oracles; So I hope, a kind Recep∣tion to the Words of Counsil &amp; Admonition, that have been delivered. May He ever bear in mind this Character of a <HI>Spiritual Father!</HI> May he study to be indeed such an one in the Church of GOD! And may he have a numerous spiritual Offspring for his Crown and Joy in the day of the Lord!</P>
<P>And I hope you, <HI>my Friends,</HI> who having built this House to the Name of GOD, have lately been incor∣porated into a distinct Family (as 'twere) &amp; chosen this Servant of GOD to be a Father unto you, will always remember the Character of <HI>Children,</HI> which the Apostle in our Text puts upon you, &amp; study to
<PB N="60" REF="002744_0061_0FE620546DED2420"/>
adorn it by a becoming Reverence &amp; Love to Him. Receive him (as we trust you do this day) with all Gladness. See that he may be with you without Fear: for he worketh the Work of the Lord. Intreat him always as a Father: let no Man despise his Youth. The Pastoral Power (accompany'd with a good Degree of Knowlege, Prudence, Seriousness, and Zeal for Souls) gives Age &amp; Seniority, to such as are but young in Years. Submit to him therefore as it is fit in the Lord. Do all you can to encourage his Heart, &amp; strengthen his Hands in his Work. Be at Peace among your selves. Strive together with him in Prayers to GOD for him. And let your Profiting by his Ministry appear.</P>
<P>So will you make him a glad Father: and in the the great day he will give up his Account with Joy; will have Confidence before the Son of Man at his Appearing, &amp; shall present you to GOD, in such Language as that, <HI>Lo! Here am I, and the Children which Thou hast given me!</HI></P>
