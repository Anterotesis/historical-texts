<HEAD>A DISCOURSE &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Heb. iii. 4.</BIBL>
<Q>—<HI>He that built all things is God.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Greek word <HI>(Kataskeuásas)</HI> translated <HI>built</HI> in our Bible, includes in its meaning the notion of <HI>order∣ing and governing,</HI> and is here used by the apostle to assert the divinity of Christ, the Son of God. For if he <HI>built</HI> all things, and orders and governs them as the scriptures af∣firm, he must be our Creator—God emphatically—the object of our adoration and obedience.</P>
<P>IT is not however my design to consider the text pre∣cisely in this view, but to draw your attention to the great Architect of universal nature, to the order, and beauty, and blessings of creation, and from thence to the obliga∣tions of adoration and obedience which we owe, and ought ever to pay to our Creator, Governor, and preserver. For if we turn our mind to the contemplation of the world which we inhabit, and consider it with due atten∣tion, it is impossible not to suppose it to have been formed by some infinitely great, and intelligent being. The na∣ture of the structure shews his power, the contrivance of its parts, his wisdom. The diversity that appears on its surface, champaign country and hills, affords fields for tillage, gives rise to rivers and brooks, and by promoting the circulation and free course of the air, adds greatly to the salubrity of that grand supporter of animal life. The ve∣getables with which its surface is covered give pleasure to
<PB N="6" REF="029480_0005_0FE13BD68BFB90E0"/>
the eye by their pleasing variety, and by their artless, yet perfect disposition; and relieve it from fatigue by their refreshing verdure. To the support too of life they daily administer by the natural and healthful supply of food for man and for beast which they afford. Materials for building, and for cloathing, for fuel we also derive from the vegetable world, by which the human body is secured from storms, and heat, and cold—from all the inclemen∣cies of the weather.—All these things are for the use, and and conveniency of man.</P>
<P>AND so are the innumerable animals supported on the earth, and in the sea. They all conduce to his emolu∣ment or pleasure. They serve him for food, for cloathing for tillage, for bearing burdens, for transporting him from place to place—in a variety of ways making his life more easy and delightful to him.</P>
<P>BUT while we contemplate the earth, and find ourselves blessed in its rich productions, can we avoid casting our eyes on the Sun, the great instrument of light and heat, and of all their pleasing and happy effects, the causer of night and day, the diversifier of climes and seasons, the measurer of time, the grand operator in all the productions of nature? The nightly regent of the sky, the splended moon, with the glittering stars, and rolling planets, add to the grandeur of the celestial dome, and not only minis∣ter to the use and conveniency of man, but to the state and magnific<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce of the great whole, and render fully effec∣tual the united influence of all its varied parts.—<Q>These are thy works, parent of good—Almighty—thine this uni∣versal frame.</Q></P>
<P>BUT to inanimate matter, and to animals, the power and goodness of God was not confined. To have built the world, and left it void of an intelligent being to behold, contemplate; and admire its beauties, to enjoy its blessings, and to adore its Almighty author, the source of being and of all good, would have shewn a deficiency of power or of wis∣dom. So did not the Supreme Architect. Man created in his own image, he placed as the inhabitant and regent
<PB N="7" REF="029480_0006_0FE13BDE3105BE60"/>
of his material creation. He gave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> faculties to enjoy its blessings; he endued him with reason, to admire and contemplate its beauty, and order; and to lead his mind and affections up to Him; that he might adore, and praise, and obey, the Almighty author of ALL, the source of happiness to every being,</P>
<P>BUT not only in this world does the creative power of God shew itself, nor is man his only intelligent creature, Worlds on worlds appear to hang in the immensity of space, and probably are inhabited by beings intelligent as well as we, and possibly in a far greater degree: And an∣gels we know are the creatures of his hand, the minister∣ing spirits that fulfil his will by executing his commands. Their nature we know not; their office divine truth hath revealed to us.</P>
<P>LOOK now at the grandeur, order, use of the various parts of the creation, especially of this world which is most open to our observation, and say, Could it be the work of blind chance? Could it have been from e∣ternity and necessarily existed? Could it have made itself? Blind chance could never have produced regularity, the ef∣fect of design. The constant mutability of the parts and scenes of the world shew that it could not have been from eternity, for what is perpetually changing cannot be eter∣nal. It could not have made itself, for that supposes it to have acted before it had a being; its mutability also con∣futes the notion of its being necessarily existent.</P>
<P>IT remains then that the world is the production of an infinite, Almighty Being, intelligent, good, wise, and, in every point of view, amiable beyond conception. He made all things that exist, whether animate or inanimate, brute or rational, visible or invisible, material or spiritual. He built them all; be they thrones, dominions, principalities, powers, men, angels; his hand formed them; his will produced them; his word spoke them into being, <HI>He</HI> therefore <HI>who built all things is God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS God is a being infinite, eternal, unchangeable, without body, parts or passions; the centre and fountain
<PB N="8" REF="029480_0007_0FE13BE2D4868FF8"/>
of all perfections; the great Architect of all nature, the Creator, the Builder, the Framer of every thing that ex∣ists; whose word is power absolute; whose will is wis∣dom, and justice, and goodness, and mercy, and truth infinite, and incomprehensible.</P>
<P>THAT God who built all things—called every thing that exists from non-entity into being—should preserve and go∣vern the creatures of his hand, is the first dictate of nature. For what power less than that which created, can pre∣serve the Universe? What power less than that which built, can direct the vast machine? Who preserves the sun, and moon, and stars steady and unwearied in their course? Who commands the certain return of the various seasons of the year, or the sweet vicissitudes of day and night? Who dispences cold and heat, clouds and sunshine rain and dew as the various exigencies of the world re∣quire, but that God who built all things, and every thing that is; and who preserves and governs them all so as best to promote the benefit and happiness of the whole.</P>
<P>WITH respect to man principally was the text written. We see what ample provision the divine munificence hath made for the support and pleasure of man's body, and may we be ever thankful for it, ever praise the name of God most high for his goodness, ever use with temperance the good things he hath provided for our subsistance, to his glory and our own benefit.</P>
<P>BUT remember, God who hath done all this for you, hath given you a rational, an immortal part, a soul as well as a body. He breathed into the nostrils of the first crea∣ted man, the <HI>breath of life,</HI> and man became a <HI>living soul.</HI> By the operation of this rational, intelligent soul, you can be made sensible of the being of your Creator, of his wisdom, power, goodness, justice, truth, and of all his infinite perfections; and tho' you cannot comprehend them, you know that they must be in him—that he cannot be without them.</P>
<P>THAT he loves you, appears from the bountiful provi∣sion he hath made for the happiness of your body. And can
<PB N="9" REF="029480_0008_0FE13BEA1BA2CC70"/>
you immagine he would neglect your soul? that immor∣tal part which must live forever? Would he take more care of a perishing body, that <HI>that</HI> might be delighted for a time, than of the immortal soul, that <HI>that</HI> might be hap∣py forever? That love which brought you into being, which built the frame of your body, which covered your bones with flesh and skin, which braced it with nerves and sinews, which made the blood to circulate thro' the vessels provided for it—that love framed also your soul accor∣ding to the model of his own image—consequently for hap∣piness divine with himself.</P>
<P>AND that the love which brought man into being still continues, appears from God's giving his only begotten Son to be his Redeemer, when he had fallen into a state of infirmity and death thro' sin; from the revelation of his will which He made thro' his Son by his prophets, and by his Son himself; from the laws and directions, and promises which that revelation contains, for the conduct of the life of man, both what he ought to believe and do to obtain the full favour of God; and from the blessed gift of his own most Holy Spirit, to do that in and for man which man cannot do for himself—to regenerate and renew his nature, and build it up in faith and holiness, that he may become capable of that happiness with his all gracious Creator for which he was originally designed.</P>
<P>HE that hath done so much will assuredly do all things for the salvation of all men, that can comport with his own infinite justice and goodness.</P>
<P>BUT let it be remembered that man has a will of his own, and that every man is what his will makes him to be. Since the departure of human nature from God in the de∣fection of Adam, this will hath become perverse, obsti∣nate, ungovernable, impetuous, indisposed to submit to the will of God, in which every possible happiness of a rational creature must forever consist. And how far the power and justice of God can controul this will, unless by influences, motives, persuations consistently with its free∣dom, i. e. without destroying the nature of man, and ta∣king
<PB N="10" REF="029480_0009_0FE13BEF193E3FF0"/>
from him the freedom of choice, is hard to conceive. And if the freedom of choice be taken from him, he cea∣ses to be a man and becomes a machine, and neither vir∣tue nor vice, good nor evil can be attributed to him more than to an irrational animal; nor can he be the object of reward or punishment.</P>
<P>TO direct this will to its true end, submission to God and dependence on him, is the design of all the laws and directions which God hath given to man, either by the light of reason, or the more explicit declarations of reve∣lation; of all the threats and promises which God hath made to man; of all the dispensations of his providence; of all the motions and inspirations of his Spirit.</P>
<P>IN this sense also is God the builder of all things; not only of the material world for the subsistance, comfort, and pleasure of man, but of that state of righteousness, and peace, and holiness, in which man's happiness must consist; on which only it can be built.</P>
<P>IT becomes therefore necessary that he submit to the will of God in all things, that he obey every thing which God commands, and refrain from every thing which God forbids. For God being the fountain of all goodness and happiness, can command or forbid his creatures nothing but what is for their advantage—especially nothing that is un∣just in itself, or unnecessary to the good of the whole cre∣ation.</P>
<P>ON this ground the right of private judgment is left o∣pen and free to every one; for every one must determine for himself what the will of God is—what he hath com∣manded—what he hath forbidden. Only he must take care that he judge <HI>right;</HI> for if he judge <HI>wrong,</HI> he does so at his own peril—God expects he will judge according to rea∣son and truth; and hath given him ability and direction sufficient to form a true judgment.</P>
<P>HOW far ignorance, and weakness, and prejudice will operate in favour of a man who errs in his judgment con∣cerning
<PB N="11" REF="029480_0010_0FE13BF74BAC0D68"/>
the will of God, must be left to him who knows the heart, and can discern the thoughts and intentions. He is merciful and just, and will judge righteous judgment. On his goodness we depend, that he will not impute the errors of the head, to the heart, nor condemn any one for those mistakes into which he was unavoidably led, thro' ignorance, weakness, or any other unsurmountable ob∣struction.</P>
<P>A SINCERE disposition however to obey the will of God, will make us very careful, that we let no vicious affection of mind, no evil propensity of heart, no undue attachment to party, no love of wealth or pleasure, no sinister purpose or disposition of any kind, weaken, or blind, or pervert our judgment where the will of God is concerned. For these things nothing can be said. He who judgeth righ∣teous judgment will condemn them; and we must endure the penalty of our own perverseness.</P>
<P>SINCE then God, the builder of all things, built the world—the universe—things visible and invisible—all or∣ders and ranks of beings—that his glory might shine forth in the happiness of his creatures—Since submission to his will, the being entirely and absolutely what he wills us to be, is the only sure foundation for perfect happiness, let us remember that God who built all things hath built them in perfect order and just proportion, and be induced from that consideration ever to conduct ourselves according to the due order of our own nature, and in just proportion to the state of our being.</P>
<P>BEHOLD the order of the material creation, and thence take a lesson of instruction. He who built all things in just order and proportion, to preserve that order which he had established, appointed the great law of gravitation, and by his Almighty <HI>siat</HI> it effectually answers his purpose to this very day. The word of the Supreme Architect, the grand master builder of the universe, is the word of power. Va∣rious, and to the human eye contradictory are the motions of the heavenly bodies, and of the different parts of this globe which we inhabit. We see not how every thing a∣mid
<PB N="12" REF="029480_0011_0FE13BFBE24B8E68"/>
such progressive and retrograde-motions, preserves its order and place, nor where the the apparently wild confu∣sion ends. By the law of gravitation, every motion is performed, every movement made without error, and with∣out injury, from the revolutions of the heavenly bodies of enormous size, down to the nourishment of the meanest vegetable, and probably of the highest animal.</P>
<P>WHAT attraction or gravitation is in the natural, that <HI>love</HI> is in the moral world. Both are appointed by the great author of nature; by him who built all things, an∣imate and inanimate; and both would surely answer the end for which they were appointed, was it not for the per∣versity of the human will.</P>
<P>THE material creation hath no will of its own, and therefore it obeys the will of its great builder, and answers the purpose for which it was intended. But God gave man an own will, and reason to direct it. <Q>He made him upright, but they have sought out many inventions;</Q> and among their other experiments, the effort to secure happiness to themselves, by pursuing the dictates of their own will, independant on the will of their maker who built all things, hath assailed and beguiled them. Hence the same or similar disorders have arisen among them, as would arise in the material world, should the whole cre∣ation break the bounds and proportions set them by their creator, and run counter to his design in their formation.</P>
<P>HAPPILY, he who built them superintends them, go∣verns their motions, and gives them ability to perform his will; and still they obediently fulfil his pleasure.</P>
<P>BUT man hath forgotten the great law of his moral na∣ture, the law of <HI>love;</HI> and by departing from the will of his maker in persuit of his own inventions, hath filled the world with evils destructive of his happiness, and almost of his present being—with war; and bloodshed, and murder, and treachery, and backbiting, and slander, and defamation, and every evil work.</P>
<P>TO be convinced that these things do destroy the peace
<PB N="13" REF="029480_0012_0FE13C023A81E7C0"/>
and happiness of man in the world, look at their effects—behold the mischiefs they produce. Who can be secure where the tongue or pen of the slanderer prevails? where the best actions are converted into the foulest crimes, and ascribed to the vilest motives? who can rest in peace where house breaking and robbery prevail? and would you know the horrible effects of war and civil dissentions, look at the present distracted condition of Europe—look, and tremble at the horrible view—look, and rejoice, and bless God that your own country is at present exempt from those dire∣ful calamities—look, and pray earnestly to him that he would graciously preserve you in security, and dispose the nations of the world to be at peace with you—look, and ask yourselves this one question, from whence proceed the evils of ill neighbour-hood? the destructions wrought by deceitful and villainous men? the devastations of tyranny and war?—From the want of that <HI>love</HI> which God hath instituted to be the grand cement of the brother-hood of men.—the operating principle by which the whole human race were to have been kept in unity and concord, even as the law of gravitation pervades and keeps in order the whole material creation. And no other way can infatuated man return to the enjoyment of happiness but by returning o∣bediently to submission to the will of the great Architect of all things, and living in love with his brethren. Peace is the happy fruit of love, &amp; quietness and security of peace.</P>
<P>"FROM whence come wars and fightings"? asks St. James, <Q>Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</Q> Men lust after, and covet what does not belong to them; what is the property of others; and others will not quietly part with what is, or what they think is their own. War therefore is general∣ly, I wish I was warranted to say, not always founded in injustice.</P>
<P>AGAINST injustice of every kind, the utmost art of man can contrive no security equal to that which our holy reli∣gion hath instituted—<Q>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</Q></P>
<P>LOVE being the grand principle ordained by the author
<PB N="14" REF="029480_0013_0FE13C078BDDEB08"/>
of nature to preserve peace and order among men; being too the principle which pervades Christ's religion, and on which all its morality is founded, shews strongly that Christ's religion came from the same source, from which sorung the nature of man—from him who built all things.</P>
<P>HUMAN laws reach only the outward actions of men. They can command only the hands and the feet, and god make them obey. But they take no hold of the con∣science. The laws of God can alone reach that inward principle of right and wrong; for as he only knows the thoughts and designs, he only can command them. He gave to man the principle of benevolence and love, and that principle alone can regulate the conduct of man so as to make him a mild and placid being. Divest him of it, and he becomes ferocious in the extreme. Compared to him wolves and tygers are harmeless animals. The reason which his maker endued him to direct his conduct, and make his benevolent propensities of the highest use, being perverted from its true object and pressed into the service of pride and malice, enables him to pursue their dictates with the cruelty and ferocity of demons—with the destructive violence of accursed spirits.—Nothing which this world affords can illustrate its nature, or exemplify the horrid operations of its maleyolence. Single victims of the hu∣man race are too small to satiate its vengeance. It de∣mands multitudes, whole nations to glut its fury: and then laments the weakness of nature that could carry it no further in the horrid road of destruction and revenge than to kill the body.</P>
<P>FROM this hateful object—the human heart filled with pride, inflamed by malice, and directed by reason and cunning—turn your attention to the same human heart blessed and softened by the divine spirit of love and good will; directed by the same reason, only illuminated and refined by the gracious inspirations of the Almighty, the blessed influence of the Holy Spirit who is love—infinite, unbounded love.</P>
<P>IN the same proportion as any man is actuated by love,
<PB N="15" REF="029480_0014_0FE13C0F1D52D600"/>
he is rendered incapable of injuring his neighbour: For whoever willingly injured those whom he loved? <Q>If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, thou shall love thy neighbour as thy self,</Q> said St. James <Q>ye do well.</Q> <HI>That</HI> law forbids every thing by which our neighbour can be injured, and commands every thing by which he can be benefited. It says, <Q>Do not commit a∣dultry;</Q> It says also "Do not kill." It says also, <Q>Do not steal, do not covet, do not bear false witness,</Q> do not slander, do not injure thy neighbour in any matter.</P>
<P>IN similar terms St. Paul saith, <Q>He that hath loved a∣nother, hath fulfilled the law.</Q> For this law, <Q>Thou shall not commit adultry;</Q> and this law, <Q>Thou shalt not kill;</Q> and this law, "Thou shalt not steal" and this law, "Thou shalt not bear false witness;" and this law, <Q>Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this say∣ing, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfiling of the law.</Q></P>
<P>LET men be actuated by this love, which is an emana∣tion from the all-glorious Architect of all nature—from him that built all things, and tell me where are wars, and tumults, and murder, and bloodshed, and rapine, and steal∣ing, and violence, and slander—where is any evil work? They are fled; they are become as smoak; like cloud after rain they are passed, and gone, and vanished away—no more to curse the earth; no more to set neighbour a∣gainst neighbour, nation against nation, and people against people.</P>
<P>THIS happy state, my friends, God intended for man even in this world, and therefore commanded every man to love his neighbour as himself.</P>
<P>YOUR professed design, Venerable brethren of the Masonic Fraternity, to whom I have now the pleasure of addressing myself, is to co-operate with the Almighty and infinitely gracious Architect of nature, according as your various
<PB N="16" REF="029480_0015_0FE13C13B5F64908"/>
stations shall permit, to spread this divine principle of be∣nevolence and love thro' the world, and make it effectual to the grand purpose of human happiness.</P>
<P>THAT this principle proceeds from the author of nature, the author of order and peace, appears from the nature of the world which he made in just order &amp; exact proportion; from the nature of man whom he formed to live in the world when he had made it; from the nature of that holy religion by which man is redeemed from death and made partaker of the hope of a blessed resurrection to eternal life. This religion, I trust in God's goodness you all profess. By the principles of your holy religion; by the priciples of the order of Masons, I conjure you to keep ever in mind the grand object you ought ever to have in view, the cultivation of love, and unity, and concord; and of course, of order and peace and good will among men. Endeavour therefore to banish all strife, and dis∣cord, and ill will from among men. Discountenance eve∣ry temper, every disposition which tends to disturb the peace and quiet of civil society, or to make men less ob∣servant of the laws and regulations by which the peace and happiness of our country is now secured, and remem∣ber, that by cultivating order, and peace, and benevolent dispositions among men; by checking every tendency to rapine, and war, and confusion among them, you co-op∣erate with the designs of the infinitely wise and good Cre∣ator who built all things; who made man, not to worry but to be mutually beneficial to each other; and that then we most resemble him, when we most cultivate those tem∣pers and dispositions which peculiarly flow from him, the author and fountain of all that is good—To whom be glory forever.</P>
<P>MATTERS which relate to war ought to be left to the Go∣vernors and rulers of our country—To them they per∣ticularly belong, to them the constitution of our Govern∣ment hath committed them: Their abilities are equal to the decision, and we have no reason to doubt their integrity.</P>
<P>LET us then confine ourselves to our own proper duty
<PB N="17" REF="029480_0016_0FE13C1AB8FD2450"/>
every one in his station; remembering that as God hath built all things in due order, in just weight, and exact proportion, our duty requires that we have a regard to order, to the reason, nature, and proportions of things in all our conduct.—That love and good-will is the only principle that can support this order, that comports with this reason, that reaches the nature or proportion of things among which we live:—That love is in the moral, what gravitation is in the natural world, the law of the creator and that it would as invariably produce its full effect in the moral, as gravitation does in the natural world, was it not counteracted by the corrupt and pervese wills of inconside∣rate and obstinate men.</P>
<P>OUR duty requires that we counteract this perversity of the human will; and as nothing can do this more effectu∣ally than the silent persuasion of a good example, let it be the earnest care of every Mason, to set that good example to others. "Let brotherly love continue", is the motto of their order, let it be also the governing principle of their conduct. Let them do nothing thro' strife or ill will, but every thing in love and affection. So shall the God of love bless them. Peace and quietness will be the probable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. At least amidst the contentions and commotions of this vain world, they will have nothing of which to ac∣cuse themselves. Conscious that they have done their du∣ty, have, as far as they were able, extended and support∣ed order, peace, affection and love, they will look to the Almighty builder and maker of all things, and notwith∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="8 letters" DISP="〈8 letters〉"/> the various infirmities of their mortal nature, shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, receive his approbation, and ready <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> eternal kingdom of peace and love.</P>
