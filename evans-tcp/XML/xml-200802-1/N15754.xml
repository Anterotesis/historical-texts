<P>A SYNOPSIS OF A COURSE OF LECTURES, ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE STUDENTS OF NATURE, IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF one of the most celebrated Professors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CULLEN in his preface.</NOTE> of the age had reason to say, that to deliver a system of the doctrines and rules proper for directing the practice of Physic, was an undertaking attended with such great difficulty, that after an experience of <HI>forty years,</HI> as well as much reading and re∣flection, it was with great diffidence he entered upon such a work.—With how much more dif∣fidence ought one to appear who cannot boast of either?</P>
<P>I always intended to present my hearers with a <HI>Synopsis</HI> of my <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>Lectures,</HI> when years and more experience should give me sufficient confi∣dence; but several circumstances concurring at this time, induce me to offer you the FIRST PART of my design, crude and imperfect as it is.</P>
<P>Prejudices have operated against our Medical Institution in general; and although the preli∣minary
<PB N="iv" REF="020123_0003_0FADED6E2F70BEB0"/>
or auxilliary branches, <HI>Anatomy, Botany, Chymistry</HI> and <HI>Natural Philosophy,</HI> are allowed to be not altogether useless or void of entertain∣ment, yet the THEORY AND PRACTICE OF PHY∣SIC, which comprehends and connects them all, is represented as neither useful nor entertaining, and if necessary, easier collected from books than lectures. Although every thing in nature hath a reference to the <HI>human person,</HI> yet the Physician may observe that some things here treated of, or rather the view in which they are exhibited, can hardly be called medical.—This will be sufficiently explained when it is known that hitherto far the greatest part of my hearers mean not to pursue physic as a profession; but, in imitation of se∣veral illustrious characters, wish only to fill up their liberal leisure in that most useful of all studies, the knowledge of themselves. It hath been la∣mented that those who have studied the philoso∣phy of the human mind, have been little ac∣quainted with the structure of the human body and the laws of the animal oeconomy; notwith∣standing the mind and the body are so intimately connected, and have such a mutual influence on one another, that the constitution of either, exa∣mined <HI>a part,</HI> can never be thoroughly under∣stood.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Gregory.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="020123_0004_0FADED6E9C72C2B8"/>In consideration of your various pursuits, we have gone one step further, and encouraged you to study man in relation to other animals and things; and glancing at the wondrous <HI>chain</HI> of universal existence, have called your attention to some of its links; and this in order that you might view this "goodly frame" in the light of a large and well regulated family, all subservient to each other in proper <HI>subordination,</HI>—all contri∣buting in their proper places to the perfection and happiness of the whole. In contemplating the <HI>principle of animation</HI> through the innumera∣ble species of beasts, birds, fishes and insects, 'till we reached the vegetable, we have been led on to enquire, whether these two tribes of orga∣nized beings do not form (instead of two distinct kingdoms) one <HI>immense family</HI>?</P>
<P>Thus, without neglecting the doctrine of dis∣eases, and their remedies, have we endeavoured to give you a more pleasing picture of man and his relations, than what mere medical lectures afford; and I was glad of such an opportu∣nity to combat certain prejudices: for when I reflected how all the sciences commonly taught in Universities were linked together, I felt a repugnance to the idea of physic being <HI>insulated,</HI> and wished to suggest to you that
<PB N="vi" REF="020123_0005_0FADED6F58DF2830"/>
the art of medicine, when properly pursued, ac∣tually comprehended more of the sciences than any other branch of knowledge you could name,—that man, placed at the head of the visible series, was an <HI>Epitome</HI> or compendium of the great world, and included within himself all the powers and properties of nature, <HI>vegetable, mineral, animal</HI> and <HI>intellectual,</HI>—that such a know∣ledge of him was so essential to the human race, that without it the great <HI>Linnaeus</HI> seems to doubt whether any other characters be sufficient to en∣title one to be ranked among mankind; for says he, "<HI>Haec si noveris</HI> HOMO <HI>es, et a reliquis anima∣libus distinctissimum genus.</HI>"</P>
<P>Natural History is not introduced here barely to amuse, but with a hope that by cultivating a taste for the works of nature some solid advantages may arise. The American may possibly be re∣minded, in his researches, that while factitious wealth is dug up from the bowels of the earth, <HI>our</HI> only true and solid riches must be drawn from its <HI>upper stratum,</HI> from thence man receives a re∣ward of his honest industry by a kind of perpe∣tual miracle wrought in his favour.</P>
<P>Should we not, moreover, encourage the na∣tural curiosity of our countrymen to read that <HI>sacred scripture</HI> written by the finger of the DEITY
<PB N="vii" REF="020123_0006_0FADED701EC65F48"/>
himself, upon every <HI>animal,</HI> every <HI>plant,</HI> and every <HI>mineral</HI>? An uncorrupted scripture this! A kind of second revelation! The GREAT BOOK OF NATURE, which comprehends the objects of every science, is peculiarly inviting in this coun∣try; its ample pages strike all who have eyes to see and hearts to feel!</P>
<P>SOME have said, these subjects, though curious, are foreign to the medical profession—but they are mistaken. Where did HIPPOCRATES, and other Princes of the art, study? Wherever there were men, and the concomitants of humanity, disease and death,—AIR, EARTH and WATER,— all that surrounded them were the pages they studied.</P>
<P>The utility of a SYNOPSIS need not be dwelt on. Method is the soul of science; by it a con∣fused heap of facts may be so ranged and disposed, that the judgment may act with freedom, and perform its office with advantage.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See preface to <HI>Novum Organ,</HI></NOTE> After the subject of an enquiry is fixed on, and well de∣fined, it should be divided into particular heads of enquiry: then the order of the things them∣selves are to be ranged and digested into the form of regular tables, so that the mind may act upon them in just order and with regularity; <HI>the whole to be so constructed as to admit of being transposed, added to, or corrected.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See preface to <HI>Novum Organ,</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="020123_0007_0FADED711E138238"/>The SYNOPSIS is divided into <HI>four parts.</HI> The FIRST PART is in your hands.</P>
<P>Although most of the subjects here mentioned have been treated of by men of eminence, the Physician will however see that we have taken a different view of the same subject from what is found in authors, and as far as I know among lecturers. Whole aphorisms are inserted upon some subjects, where we knew of no book that could serve as a guide to the pupil. The apho∣risms on the <HI>Vis vitalis</HI> may serve as an example. The obscurity in which the process of <HI>digestion</HI> was involved till very lately, will serve to explain the length of that section; the same may be said of the <HI>Lymphatic system,</HI> while the well established doctrine of the <HI>circulation</HI> will explain the brevity of that subject. Under this head, some entire sentences are taken from <HI>Fordyce</HI> and <HI>Haller</HI> to comment on, and wherever we have taken the same liberty with any author, it is mentioned in the margin in general, and in the lectures in par∣ticular.</P>
<P>The SECOND PART treats of the more obvious causes of diseases,—the atmosphere—the situa∣tion—the diet—and then of particular ACUTE DISEASES; which will be treated of according to the plan first suggested by SYDENHAM, namely, arranged like the subjects of natural history into
<PB N="ix" REF="020123_0008_0FADED724FA3AD68"/>
<HI>classes, orders, genera</HI> and <HI>species.</HI> By such an assist∣ance the student of nature is led as it were by an <HI>Ariadne's clue,</HI> through the turnings and laby∣rinths of the <HI>three kingdoms</HI> of nature, and with∣out a similar one, the student of medicine could scarcely retain the description of diseases, or re∣member how they are treated.</P>
<P>The THIRD PART treats of CHRONIC DISEASES, beginning with the most simple, and ending with the most complicated.</P>
<P>The FOURTH PART considers the OPERATION OF MEDICINES, and treats of the METHODUS CON∣CINNANDI FORMULAS MEDICAMENTORUM.</P>
<P>In the execution of our plan, we wish not to hold up what we have to offer to you as our own self-created knowledge, but rather what we have collected from the writings of approved authors, from lectures, and from the communications of eminent men. Neither shall we endeavour to stamp a dignity on any of our inventions by the triumphs of confutation, the citation of antiquity, or the mask of obscurity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Novum Organ.</HI></NOTE> but try to lead you on to things and their relations; and avoiding as much as possible all technical terms, we shall en∣deavour
<PB N="x" REF="020123_0009_0FADED725E35EEB8"/>
to express ourselves in so plain and sim∣ple a style, as to require no other preparation than common sense, and an unprejudiced mind.</P>

<HEAD>SYNOPSIS OF A COURSE OF LECTURES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. <HI>History of</HI> SCIENCE <HI>in general, and</HI> MEDICINE <HI>in particular.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE intentions of our forefathers in found∣ing this College. The idea the Romans had of <HI>education</HI> evident from the origin of that word. The difference in the minds of men, not so much the effect of organization as education. The aptitude to understanding is a dead power in man, when not vivified by passions. The pas∣sion of <HI>glory,</HI> the commonly exciting cause. All men are susceptible of it in countries where glory conducts to power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Helvetius.</NOTE> Reflections on the progress of civilization from the naked savage to polished humanity. Times and countries have their wastes and desarts. What form of government, and at what period most favourable to learning.
<PB N="2" REF="020123_0011_0FADED74E6E398D0"/>
Computation of the numbers of the human spe∣cies destroyed in building up tyranny, by <HI>Sesostris,</HI> by <HI>Semiramis,</HI> by <HI>Xerxes,</HI> by <HI>Alexander,</HI> the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> the <HI>Sicilians,</HI> by <HI>Mithridates,</HI> the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> the <HI>Crusadors,</HI> and by the <HI>Europeans</HI> on this continent.</P>
<P>The arts and sciences commonly flourish im∣mediately after civil wars and commotions. Some of the most distinguished benefactors of mankind, when and where they lived—of those few who have aggrandized the human mind by cultivating their own.</P>
<P>Distribution of knowledge into particular sciences. PHILOSOPHY divided into the doctrine of the <HI>Deity</HI>—of <HI>Nature</HI>—and of <HI>Man.</HI> The doctrine of MAN divided into the doctrine of the <HI>body,</HI> and of the <HI>mind</HI>—and the doctrine of the <HI>union.</HI></P>
<P>Of the intimate connection of all the sciences— the propriety of making the <HI>Muses</HI> all sisters.</P>
<P>The universe affords nothing so deserving our consideration and wonder as <HI>ourselves.</HI>—The hu∣man body, of all created things, most capable of relief; yet this relief most liable to err.</P>
<P>A classical investigation of the origin of the <HI>Healing Art.</HI> The fables of the antients pregnant with wisdom.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="020123_0012_0FADED7627358190"/>The antient poetry divided into (1) The <HI>Nar∣rative</HI>—(2) The <HI>Dramatic</HI>—(3) <HI>Allegorical.</HI> From the <HI>allegorical</HI> the origin of medicine must be drawn. How the sciences were first taught by <HI>signs</HI> and <HI>symbols.</HI> As hieroglyphics preceded letters, so allegories preceded arguments,—va∣rious examples. This mode of teaching still among the <HI>Chinese,</HI> and in some degree among our <HI>Indians.</HI> The importance of a <HI>clue</HI> to these allegories, they having <HI>nature</HI> for their basis. How the symbols of ideas came to be taken for ideas themselves, truth came mixed with false∣hood, human things with divine. Among all the ruder nations, the <HI>Priest,</HI> the <HI>Conjuror</HI> and <HI>Physician,</HI> were united in one man—other sources of superstition and nonsense—some traces dis∣cernable still in the <HI>Materia Medica.</HI></P>
<P>Explanation of the allegory of <HI>Apollo</HI> or <HI>Phoebus</HI>: —Why called the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Physic.</HI> The sagacity of the poets in making <HI>AEsculapius</HI> and <HI>Circe,</HI> brother and sister, and both children of <HI>Apollo.</HI></P>
<P>An account of some of the Grecian Philoso∣phers and Physicians who flourished during the period of Grecian liberty. <HI>Marcus Cato's</HI> opinion of them in his day.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="020123_0013_0FADED776C72EFD0"/>Of HIPPOCRATES, why called the father of the Medical art—a specimen of his doctrine—a cri∣terion by which his genuine works may be known —imitated by several, equalled by none—reflec∣tions on the age of the polished world, from the rich treasure of knowledge found in his writings —who first differed from <HI>Hippocrates</HI>—when and how Physicians were divided into sects—of the <HI>Dogmatic, Emperic</HI> and <HI>Methodic</HI> sects—account of <HI>Asclepiades,</HI> and his innovations in practice—his arts to acquire popularity and fortune.</P>
<P>An account of GALEN, wherein he did more harm than good to medicine, and acquired more fame than he deserved.</P>
<P>A short history of the various sects that flou∣rished from this period to the time the <HI>Western Empire</HI> was overran by the Goths, and the <HI>Eastern</HI> by the Arabs.</P>
<P>How a northern swarm of barbarians extin∣guished the small light of learning that then re∣mained, burning the libraries, universities and cities. Concerning <HI>Mahomet's</HI> conquests. From the 9th century to the 12th, the Arabians en∣grossed the province of physic, how far they en∣larged its boundaries. In the 15th century Con∣stantinople was sacked, the Greeks driven out, and forced to take refuge in Europe. The
<PB N="5" REF="020123_0014_0FADED77A0F52628"/>
writers from this time called <HI>Moderns.</HI> Hence there appears three periods or revolutions of learning; <HI>one</HI> among the GREEKS, <HI>another</HI> among the ROMANS, and a <HI>third</HI> among the WESTERN nations of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>MEDICINE, long cultivated on the coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> derives its origin according to them, from the supreme God, and handed down for myriads of ages through the successive orders of inferior Deities;—reflections thereon,—a speci∣men of their theory. Of the state of physic in <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI>: their method of acquiring a knowledge of the healing-art more wise than any unlettered people yet known.</P>
<P>The <HI>revival or resurrection of letters.</HI> The nobles of all nations flocking to the holy war, ad∣mired the art and cultivation of the Greeks and Romans, shrunk back at their own barbarity—the consequences thence arising. How for several centuries the admiration of the knowledge of former ages retarded the advancement of science.</P>
<P>Elogium on ROGER BACON.</P>
<P>The discovery of the ARS ARTIUM OMNIUM CONSERVATRIX, the <HI>Art of Printing,</HI> and its im∣mediate consequences.</P>
<P>The <HI>two systems</HI> of PHILOSOPHY prevalent at this period, viz.—The Philosophy of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and the Philosophy of <HI>Plato</HI>: the first occupied
<PB N="6" REF="020123_0015_0FADED78538D2C38"/>
the <HI>universities</HI> and <HI>cloisters.</HI> The poets, sentimen∣tal philosophers, and some others, were disciples of <HI>Plato.</HI> These two systems more or less dis∣cernable in all the writings of this period.</P>
<P>A great revolution in the theory and practice of Physic, by the introduction of <HI>Chymistry.</HI> An account of <HI>Paracelsus</HI> and his followers.</P>
<P>A short history of <HI>Medical Chymistry,</HI> in con∣tradistinction to that very ancient art of smelt∣ing, refining and tempering of metals.</P>
<P><HI>New</HI> diseases and <HI>new</HI> remedies, in consequence of a great part of the earth being discovered un∣known to the ancients, viz. <HI>America,</HI>—the <HI>southern parts</HI> of <HI>Africa,—China</HI> and <HI>Siberia,</HI>—together with a vast <HI>number</HI> of <HI>islands.</HI></P>
<P>In the 17th century HARVEY demonstrated the <HI>Circulation of the blood,</HI> which, together with the discovery of the <HI>Receptacle of the Chyle</HI> and of the <HI>Thoracic-Duct,</HI> overturned the whole system of Galen and the theory of the Chymists. GALILEO now introduced mathematical reason∣ing, and BACON his new mode of induction. This the aera of experiment in which several great men flourished.—Societies established for pro∣moting and diffusing experimental philosophy in several parts of Europe with princes for their pa∣trons.—Posts or conveyances by letter established. —<HI>Anatomy</HI> now prosecuted with juster views than
<PB N="7" REF="020123_0016_0FADED792ADFCCB0"/>
before the discovery of the circulation.—<HI>Injections</HI> of coloured liquors first introduced.—The <HI>Mi∣croscope</HI> applied to investigate the more subtile parts of the body.</P>
<P>A catalogue of the most important <HI>anatomical discoveries</HI> from that time to the present.</P>
<P>General account of Theories from HARVEY to the time of HOFFMAN.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Mathematical</HI> or <HI>Mechanical Theory,</HI> in which the blood was considered as the <HI>primum mobile</HI> of the whole body. How the consequences of this doctrine destroyed the principles on which it was founded.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Theory of STAHL, who maintained that the rational and immaterial soul itself was the source of all the motions of the body.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Theory of BOERHAAVE.</P>
<P N="4">4. HOFFMAN's Theory, who maintained that so far was the body from depending on a state of the fluids as <HI>Boerhaave</HI> imagined, that the crasis of the fluids themselves entirely depended on the nervous power, and that the greatest part of dis∣eases were affections of the <HI>nervous system.</HI></P>
<P>General reflections on the foregoing history,— why it appears the history of <HI>opinions</HI> rather than of a progressive art.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="020123_0017_0FADED79E7925348"/>An account of the few eminent authors in physic, in comparison of whom the rest are mere compilers.—Fewer books written on physic than any other branch of science of its extent.</P>
<P>On the <HI>simplicity</HI> of the medical art at present, compared with a century ago. By injections and microscopes, obscure things now rendered con∣spicuous, minute things magnified, and from confusion reduced to order and simplicity.</P>
<P>The more we know of any science, the greater number of <HI>particulars</HI> are we able to resolve into <HI>general ones,</HI> and consequently we shall be able to reduce its principles within narrower bounds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Priestley.</NOTE> This opinion verified by the present state of me∣dicine.</P>
<P>The almost endless catalogue of diseases that af∣flict mankind a principal discouragement to stu∣dents—how remedied.</P>
<P>SYDENHAM was the first who suggested the idea of reducing diseases to a certain determinate species, in imitation of botanic writers. <HI>Sauvages</HI> the first who attempted it.—<HI>Linnaeus—Vogel—Sagar</HI> and <HI>Cullen,</HI> the greatest improvers.</P>
<P>All scholastic teaching is <HI>classification,</HI>—exempli∣fied in the division of the works of creation, first
<PB N="9" REF="020123_0018_0FADED7A98F5E098"/>
into the <HI>four elements,</HI> then into the <HI>three kingdoms.</HI> The animal kingdom divided into <HI>six classes,</HI> com∣prehending all animated nature; these classes di∣vided into <HI>orders,</HI> each order into <HI>genera,</HI> each genus into <HI>species.</HI></P>
<P>The CLASSES are marked by certain symptoms and circumstances which are common to each; the <HI>orders</HI> all agree in having the same marks with the <HI>class</HI> to which they belong, together with some additional ones peculiar to the <HI>order</HI>; the <HI>genera</HI> have all the marks and circumstances of the <HI>class</HI> and <HI>order,</HI> and besides have some which distinguish the <HI>genus</HI>; and the species have all the marks and tokens of <HI>class, order</HI> and <HI>genus,</HI> with the still further addition of symptoms or circum∣stances which give the <HI>specific character.</HI> See <HI>Encyclop. Brit.</HI>—also <HI>Lock on Human Understanding, vol.</HI> 1, <HI>p.</HI> 357, 8 <HI>vo. and vol.</HI> 2, <HI>chap.</HI> 3, <HI>on general terms.</HI></P>
<P>All the known diseases that afflict mankind re∣duced to <HI>four</HI> classes, and these to 150 genera.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See part the second.</NOTE></P>
<P>The MATERIA MEDICA less advanced than any other branch of the art; the <HI>instinctive principle</HI> more exercised in what we take into the stomach
<PB N="10" REF="020123_0019_0FADED7B532B0350"/>
than the <HI>rational,</HI> one cause. <HI>False Criteria</HI> ano∣ther,—these reduced to eight heads.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See part the fourth</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Mercury—Antimony—Opium—Peruvian-Bark,</HI> a few other <HI>Vegetables—Fire, Exercise</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> include near all the physicians instruments.</P>
<P>Enumeration of the principal <HI>Desiderata</HI> in <HI>Anatomy</HI>—in the doctrine of the <HI>Animal oeconomy</HI>— in <HI>Surgery</HI>—and in the <HI>Therapeutica.</HI></P>
<P>A view of the <HI>Data</HI> and <HI>Quoesita</HI> in the art of physic.</P>
<P>The general problem which comprehends the whole art is,—</P>
<P><HI>Having the symptoms given to find the remedy</HI>; or thus divided,</P>
<P><HI>(a.) Having the symptoms given to find the devia∣tions of the body from its natural state.</HI></P>
<P><HI>(b.) Having</HI> this <HI>deviation given to find the remedy.</HI></P>
<P>It is useful to invert these problems, and enquire,</P>
<P><HI>(a.) Having the deviations given, what the symp∣toms must be.</HI></P>
<P><HI>(b.) Having the manner of operation of a successful remedy given, what the deviation must be.</HI> (See Hartley, vol. 1st.)</P>
<P>BOERHAAVE's method of studying physic—his idea of a consummate physician.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="020123_0020_0FADED7E36B7BC78"/>HOFFMAN's method, considered under <HI>four heads.</HI></P>
<P>A rehearsal of Dr. CULLEN's objections to the <HI>Boerhaavian system.</HI>—How far he has supplied its deficiencies.</P>
<P>The out-lines of <HI>Cullen's Physiology,</HI> wherein he differs from all other medical teachers.</P>
<P>Elogium on BOERHAAVE.</P>
<P>General reflections on the various methods re∣commended in studying physic. Of the remark∣able simplicity observable in the writings of the most successful enquiries after truth—several in∣stances adduced.</P>
<P>Where did HIPPOCRATES, and other PRINCES in the art, study?—Wherever there were men and the concomitants of humanity, diseases and death, <HI>air, earth</HI> and <HI>water,</HI> all that surrounded them were the pages they studied!</P>

<P>VEINS,—their general structure.</P>
<P>In all the veins perpendicular to the horizon, excepting the Uterus and Porta, there are small valves, but none in the deep running vessels of the Viscera—none in the Lungs, Brain, Liver, or the whole system of the Vaena Portarum—nor in any blood-vessels, less than the twelfth of an inch, diameter.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Haller's Physiology.</NOTE></P>
<P>How do the veins begin? There is a structure between the veins and arteries little understood.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Malpigh and Ruysch.</NOTE></P>
<P>The blood-vessels in a live animal are always full.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="020123_0029_0FADED8B214113A8"/>When an animal dies, the Arteries and Veins loose their cylindrical form and are flattened, and the capillaries contain less blood, so that the blood sufficient to fill the vessels when the animal was alive, is not capable of filling them after he is dead; therefore the arteries, veins and capillaries of the living animal, are commonly contracted to a greater degree than they can be by their elasti∣city.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE></P>

<P><LABEL>APHORISM I.</LABEL> ALL the living parts of the body have, besides those attributes common to all bodies, as solidity, extension and gravity, a peculiar <HI>something</HI> which distinguishes the living from a dead body.</P>
<P>A muscular fibre will contract, and that not by the power of gravitation, cohesion, chrystallization, <HI>(electricity?)</HI> magnetism, or chymical attraction.</P>

<P><LABEL>APH. III.</LABEL> Whatever by its contact with an animal fibre, excites in it a contraction or oscillation, we call a <HI>Stimulus.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>APH. IV.</LABEL> That state of an animal fibre in which a con∣traction or oscillation is produced by the contact of a stimulus, we call <HI>Irritability.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>APH. V.</LABEL> That principle in animals, on which sensation, motion, and all the animal powers depend, we call the VIS VITALIS.</P>
<P><LABEL>APH. VI.</LABEL> If by the application of a stimulus to the solids, a perception is excited in the mind, this effect we call <HI>sensation</HI> or <HI>facultas sentiendi.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>APH. VII.</LABEL> By the action of stimuli on the solids, the <HI>Vis Vitalis</HI> is excited and preserved; when diminished, it may be encreased, and when totally suspended, it may be restored.</P>

<P>Description of the Conglobate or Lymphatic Glands. The Thoracic Duct, is a lymphatic of the largest order: it begins near the Diaphragm, and commonly terminates in the left subclavian vein; to it, as the common receptacle, the whole lymphatic system tends.</P>

As the arteries are evidently connected in structure and office with the Lac∣teals or Lymphatics of the intestines, may they not in like manner with all the rest in the system?

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Nervous System.</HEAD>
<P>THE BRAIN is that soft whitish mass which sills the cavity of the skull, and is imme∣diately surrounded by two membranes, called <HI>Meninges</HI> by the Greeks, and <HI>Matres</HI> by other ancients: one is very strong, and lies contiguous to the skull; the other is very thin, and imme∣diately touches the brain. The first is called <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> the last <HI>Pia Mater.</HI></P>
<P>The brain is furnished with blood-vessels in the same manner as the other parts, excepting that larger arteries anastomose, and the smaller veins enter more suddenly into a larger trunk, whose sides are of a firmer texture<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the more perfect or complicated animals, it is contained in the cavity of the skull:—in the less perfect, it is diffused all over the body.</P>
<P>In man, the brain is in a larger proportion to the whole body than any other quadruped, or any bird, or fish hitherto known<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the white part, masses of fibres arise, which go to every part of the body. These are called <HI>Nerves</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="020123_0048_0FADED9EE2D4E690"/>But so ignorant are we of the <HI>origin</HI> of the nerves, that the lowest in the spinal marrow may, for ought we know, come from the top of the brain.</P>
<P>One large mass passes down through the cavity of the spine, and is called the spinal-marrow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The brain, spinal-marrow and nerves, are co∣vered with membranes of a very firm texture. The nerves sent to the organs of the senses, there lose their firm coats, and terminate in a pulpy substance.</P>
<P>Of the connexion and dependence of the nerves on the <HI>Hydraulic</HI> part of the machine.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A general view of the Nervous System<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">From Cullen's Physiology.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>The nervous system, as the organ of sense and motion, is connected with so many functions of the animal oeconomy, that the study of it must be of the utmost importance, and a fundamental part of the study of the whole oeconomy.</P>
<P>The nervous system consists of the medullary substances of the brain, cerebellum, medulla ob∣longata and spinalis, and of the same substance continued into the nerves, by which it is distri∣buted to many different parts of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="020123_0049_0FADED9FDD457C08"/>The whole of this system may be distinguised into four parts—</P>
<P N="1">I. The medullary substance contained in the cranium and vertebral cavity; the whole of which seems to consist of distinct fibres, but without the several fibres being seperated from each other by any evident enveloping membranes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When we speak of functions, which are, or may be in common to every part of this portion of the nervous system, we shall speak of the whole under the title of the <HI>Brain</HI>: but when it is necessary to distinguish particular parts, we shall take care to avoid ambiguity. <HI>Cullen.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">II. Connected with one part or other of (§ I.) are the <HI>nerves,</HI> in which the medullary substance is contained; but here more evidently divided into fibres, each of which are seperated from the others by an enveloping membrane derived from the Pia Mater.</P>
<P N="3">III. Parts of the extremities of certain nerves (§ II.) in which the medullary substance is di∣vested of the enveloping membranes from the Pia Mater, and so situated as to be exposed to the action of certain external bodies, and perhaps so framed as to be affected by the action of certain bodies only: these we call the <HI>sentient extremities of the nerves.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="41" REF="020123_0050_0FADEDA017E2C6D0"/>IV. Certain extremities of the nerves (§ II.) so framed as to be capable of a peculiar contractility; and in consequence of their situation and attach∣ments, to be by their contraction capable of mov∣ing most of the solid and fluid parts of the body. These are named <HI>moving</HI> or <HI>muscular fibres.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That muscular fibres are a continuation of the medul∣lary substance of the brain and nerves, has not been shewn by Anatomists, nor universally admitted by Phy∣siologists; but we now suppose it, and hope afterwards to render it sufficiently probable.</HI></P>
<P>Are the <HI>Ganglions</HI> of the nerves to be considered as a part of the nervous system distinguished by a peculiar function?</P>
<P>These several parts of the nervous system, are every where the same continous medullary sub∣stance, which we suppose to be the vital solids, so constituted in living animals, and in living sys∣tems only, as to admit of motions being readily propagated from one part to every other part of the nervous system, so long as the continuity and living state of the medullary substance remains.</P>
<P>In the living man there is an immaterial think∣ing substance or MIND; and every phoenomenon of thinking is to be considered as an affection or faculty of the mind alone. But this immaterial
<PB N="42" REF="020123_0051_0FADEDA11292CE78"/>
and thinking part of man, is so connected with the material and corporeal part of him, and particu∣larly with the nervous system, that motions ex∣cited in this, give occasion to thought; and thought, however occasioned, gives rise to new motions in the nervous system.</P>
<P>It is probable that the motions excited by the application of stimuli to a moving and irritable part, or to the nerve going to a moving part, <HI>do not arise in the brain,</HI> but immediately in the nerves, or in the part; the brain, in this case, only keeping up the life of the part, and render∣ing it capable of motion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A substance may act on one part as a stimulant or sedative, and have a less effect, or none at all, when applied to another, although otherwise equally irritable. Such stimuli are called <HI>spe∣cific</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See part fourth, <HI>on the action of Medicine.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>(See the aphorisms on the Vis Vitalis.)</HI></P>
<P>It has been conjectured by some, that motion was communicated to parts by a fluid flowing through the nerves as tubes; by others, that it was communicated by vibrations<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Hartley, on Man.</NOTE>, and by others, that it arises from <HI>electricity.</HI></P>
<P>Is a nerve a better conductor of electricity than any other part in the same state of moisture?

By a moderate pressure the nervous influence is intercepted.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Instinct</HI> compared.</HEAD>
<P>REASON is a self-improving power or faculty of the mind.</P>
<P>INSTINCT is that <HI>discretion</HI> which in different degrees is diffused through every animal, direct∣ing them to choose what is good, and to avoid what would be destructive to them. It attains its perfection at once, and is most apparent where reason is weakest.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>On <HI>Custom</HI> and <HI>Habit.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Custom is the frequent repetition of any appli∣cation to the body, capable of affecting the sensi∣ble or irritable parts; or it is the repetition of any action or motion of the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Habit</HI> is the effect of such repetition.</P>
