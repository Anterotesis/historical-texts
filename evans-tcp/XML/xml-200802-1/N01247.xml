<BIBL>PSALM LXXXII. 6, 7.</BIBL>
<Q>I have said, Ye are <HI>Gods:</HI> and all of you are Children of the most High: But ye shall <HI>Die</HI> like <HI>Men,</HI>—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a divine as well as wise &amp; just Remark, made by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monsieur Paschal.</NOTE> One of the greatest <HI>Masters</HI> of <HI>Thought</HI> in the Last Age, that Persons of <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> ought to have two <HI>Sets</HI> of thoughts, by which to regulate their Conduct: by the <HI>One</HI> they are to view themselves in their State of distin∣guishing <HI>Elevation,</HI> which is not from <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> but Arbitrary <HI>Establishment;</HI> by the <HI>Other</HI> they are to take a prospect of them∣selves
<PB N="2" REF="001484_0004_0FB3545B332185F8"/>
in their Natural Condition of <HI>Infir∣mity,</HI> and <HI>Equality</HI> with the rest of Man∣kind. The bright Idea of their Dignity &amp; Power must be temper'd with the more cloudy Idea of their Frailty: A Seperation of these will lead into gross Illusions, and betray into Errors fatal to themselves, and their Dependents: But an happy Union of these will afford light to direct them in the bright tracts of Substantial Glory; and forcible arguments to engage them to such a management, as shall be glorious to themselves, and happy to the World. The former prospect will take them off from the false scent of honour, and inspire them with inflaming Incentives to the most noble Actions, which will adorn their <HI>Cha∣racter;</HI> without the latter view they will be in the nearest danger of being dazled with the Glare of Grandeur, and growing giddy by looking down from their State of Eminence upon those beneath them: If the <HI>Great</HI> forget their <HI>Dignity</HI> they will under-act the vertues becoming their Fi∣gure; if they reflect not steadily on their <HI>Infirmity,</HI> they will over-act the powers of their <HI>Elevation.—Know thy self</HI> is the
<PB N="3" REF="001484_0005_0FB3546650E19FF0"/>
first Lesson in the School of Wisdom, which becomes the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Honourable,</HI> as well as others, to learn: and these just Reflecti∣ons both on their <HI>Excellency,</HI> and <HI>Frailty,</HI> will be found the <HI>first Elements</HI> of this Prudence. These will prompt them so to act the part assigned them on the Stage of Life, that their External Condition may be found in Conjunction with the more valuable inherent Dignity of a vertuous Mind; that when Death shall shut up the present scene, a brighter scene of Glory may open upon them; and they appear with Superiour Characters on the Stage of true Glory and Immortality.</P>
<P>And <HI>these thoughts</HI> are not only proper for <HI>Men of Name &amp; Power</HI> themselves; but are instructive to such as are under their Government: These must view their Su∣periors in the Excellency of their Station, that they may pay them those Regards due to the Impressions of <HI>Divine Majesty,</HI> which they bear; yet they must behold them but as <HI>Gods,</HI> whose <HI>Dwelling is in flesh,</HI> whose breath is in their Nostrils, and may be soon Stopt; which will give check to a Spirit of flattery, regulate their Expecta∣tions
<PB N="4" REF="001484_0006_0FB3546B81DF2FE0"/>
from them, and make them disclaim all undue confidences in the most dignify'd Wisdom and Power on Earth.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>these two Set of Thoughts</HI> are in the most lively colours represented in the Words of our Text. <HI>I have said ye are</HI> Gods, <HI>&amp;c. but ye shall dy like men.</HI> Which, if I mistake not, will afford us Reflections proper to the work of this Day; and in which every part of this Audience may have their Portion.</P>
<P>I hope there are none so vain as to ima∣gine, that I appear this Day in this <HI>Awful Desk,</HI> only to beat the Air, &amp; play the <HI>Orator</HI> in an Artful Address to our <HI>Rulers,</HI> either by way of Unmannerly Satyr, or fulsome Panegyrick; This would not well become the <HI>Solemnity</HI> of this Place, nor the <HI>Gravi∣ty</HI> of my Audience; and much less would it Suit my <HI>own Character;</HI> Nor may it be supposed that I am called forth to read a Lecture in Politicks before our <HI>Venerable Senators;</HI> for thus I should go beyond my <HI>own Line,</HI> and <HI>boast of a false Gift.</HI> I de∣sire to keep in Mind what <HI>Place</HI> I stand in, In whose <HI>Name</HI> I Speak, what <HI>Critical In∣spection</HI> I am under, and what an <HI>Awful
<PB N="5" REF="001484_0007_0FB3546D5854BAB0"/>
Account</HI> I must give in of my present Per∣formance to our COMMON LORD and JUDGE; and under the commanding <HI>Awe</HI> of these thoughts, I shall endeavour to Speak; and must intreat my AU∣DIENCE, under the same <HI>Awe,</HI> to hear.</P>
<P>This <HI>Psalm,</HI> of which our Text is part, is stiled a <HI>Psalm</HI> of <HI>Asaph:</HI> Not because it was directed to Asaph the <HI>Levite</HI> and <HI>Singer,</HI> which lived in the dayes of David, but as I apprehend because it was penn'd by <HI>Asaph,</HI> the <HI>Seer,</HI> who lived about the dayes of Hezekiah: The Rulers of which Day are Stigmatized by the Prophet Isai∣ah,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah 1, 10.</NOTE> as <HI>Rulers of Sodom.</HI> And this Con∣jecture is strengthen'd by the judgment of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ick.</HI></NOTE> a <HI>Great Master</HI> of Jewish Learning. The Psalm is a warm Address to those that filled the Seats of Judgment; and is a loud Cry for Publick Justice; that truth and unbribed Judgment might Establish their Tribunals: Here are administred the most pungent Rebukes for their Corrup∣tion, Male-Administrations, and Criminal Disorders, whereby the foundations of the State were put out of course; and the
<PB N="6" REF="001484_0008_0FB3546ECD677138"/>
main Pillars of Government sapt; and Rulers are faithfully admonished of the Duties of their Post, which God &amp; Men expect of them. To render this address the more forcible it is introduced with the Solemn thoughts of the <HI>Presence, Pre∣sidency,</HI> and Inspection of the Great God over such, as are Exalted to Place of Rule over men. <HI>v.</HI> 1. <HI>God standeth in the Congre∣gation of the Mighty; He Judgeth among the Gods:</HI> And that the Impression of their Duty might be deep and durable, the blessed God who is the <HI>Only,</HI> and <HI>Supream Potentate</HI> of Heaven and Earth, is brought in as representing to them, the beauty, lustre and glory of their Character; so, giving them a dark Prospect of the <HI>Land of Darkness</HI> to which they are hastning, in a <HI>Solemn Memento</HI> of their Mortality, and that State Consequent hereon, which cer∣tainly Expects them. <HI>I said ye are Gods,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>but ye shall dye like Men.</HI> In which we have a <HI>Concession,</HI> and a serious <HI>Cor∣rection,</HI> or just Qualification of this Con∣cession.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> we have a <HI>Concession</HI> concerning such as are Exalted to Place of <HI>Rule</HI> and
<PB N="7" REF="001484_0009_0FB35473607EA638"/>
<HI>Power. I have said ye are Gods; and all of you are Children of the Most High.</HI> In which we have two things observable.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Institution,</HI> or <HI>Divine Ordination</HI> of <HI>Civil Government: I said ye are Gods:</HI>] <HI>I said,</HI> i. e. God, who is the FOUNTAIN of all Honour and Power; I, who am KING of KINGS, the Supream LORD &amp; MASTER of the World; whose Word is a Law not to be disputed: <HI>I have said,</HI> i. e. have ordained, constituted and ap∣pointed by my Sovereign Authority, and in my Supream Wisdom. Tho' all men have the same Original, are of the same Make, and in many Articles stand upon the same level; yet I have appointed that there shall be some of a Superiour Cha∣racter, advanced to Place, Power, and Dig∣nity above others; I have made them <HI>Gods,</HI> and by my <HI>Institution</HI> they must be treated <HI>as such.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We have in this <HI>Concession</HI> the Glori∣ous <HI>Character</HI> that God Himself has put upon <HI>Civil Rulers:</HI> and their Character carries in it the most Sublime Ideas of State and Magnificence, Power and Dig∣nity: They are Gods] Not by <HI>Nature</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001484_0010_0FB35474AACCE4D8"/>
or <HI>Essence,</HI> but by <HI>Office;</HI> Gods by <HI>Depu∣tation, Analogy</HI> and Proportion. <HI>Elohim,</HI> which is a Name, given not only to the Supream Governour of the World, <HI>GOD o∣ver all Blessed for Ever,</HI> but also to <HI>Angels,</HI> those Ministers that do his Pleasure, that attend the Throne of Majesty above.—<HI>And all of them Sons of the Highest:</HI>] i.e. As Children bear the <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Image</HI> of their Father; so these wear the Title and <HI>Name,</HI> bear the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> of the Great GOD; and so are Sons of the most High, who has put something of his Majesty up∣on them, and by his Constitution raised them to a Condition of Exaltation like to the Angels of Heaven, those <HI>Sons of God,</HI> who are the Supream Ministers of his Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have a <HI>Correction,</HI> or qua∣lification of this Concession. <HI>But ye shall die like Men.</HI>] In which we may observe two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Correction</HI> it self. Ye must <HI>Dy</HI> like <HI>Men.</HI>] In Power and Order they are raised above others; they are Petty Dei∣ties, but they are Mortal Ones; In a little time they will be dismantled of all
<PB N="9" REF="001484_0011_0FB3547763C66AB0"/>
the visible Ensigns of distinguishing Great∣ness, and retire off the the Stage of this World in a state of Equality with the meanest. They dy <HI>like Men,</HI> i. e. like <HI>Other men,</HI> who are not thus Exalted: They dy like <HI>Men,</HI> i. e. as Creatures who are Endowed with Immortal, reasonable Souls, accountable to the GOD that made them; they Dy as <HI>Men,</HI> and not Perish like the <HI>Beasts,</HI> whose <HI>spirit</HI> as well as body goes <HI>downwards;</HI> but as <HI>Men,</HI> whose Spirits at Death return to GOD that gave them; as Men, i. e. as Beings whose Bo∣dies shall not always ly in the Dust, but shall be redeem'd from Corruption; whose Flesh and Spirit shall be again united in order to an assignment to an Eternal State, either of Bliss or Misery, by the Deter∣mination of the Judge of the World. So it points us not only to their <HI>Morta∣lity,</HI> but also to that <HI>Judgment</HI> that fol∣lows upon Death, and the important <HI>Con∣sequents</HI> thereof.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may observe the design of this <HI>Correction.</HI> Which is to <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Qua∣lify</HI> the thoughts of the foregoing Con∣cession. The foregoing Character given
<PB N="10" REF="001484_0012_0FB3547A7B15B798"/>
of Rulers, might be well suspected as drawn with Colours too bright, Strokes too bold, and in a Form too Divine; Now a Prospect of their Mortality and consequent Darkness is represented, as dark Shades, without which their Picture would not be full, Just and Natural; nor they represented in their compleat Figure, and native Complexion. This Darkness is as necessary, as the former Light to take a just View of them.</P>
<P>The very nature and design of this Correction, do's intimate the great Ad∣vantage and Propriety of having the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of the Dignity of Rulers tem∣per'd and qualify'd with wise Reflecti∣ons on their Mortality, and it's important Consequents.</P>
<P>Now agreeably to what has been ob∣served in both parts of our Text, there are four <HI>Significant Articles</HI> which demand our Consideration, and shall be the <HI>Heads</HI> of my present Discourse. As,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> That the <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> a∣mong men is <HI>Divine,</HI> or from Heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> That GOD has Dignifyed Rulers among men with the <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Style</HI> of <HI>Gods.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="11" REF="001484_0013_0FB3547C0A2E5A90"/>
<HI>III.</HI> Tho' they are <HI>Gods,</HI> yet they are subject to <HI>Mortality,</HI> and the Conse∣quents of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>IV.</HI> That it will be of Great <HI>Advan∣tage</HI> to temper the thoughts of their <HI>Dig∣nity,</HI> with just Reflections on their Ex∣pected <HI>Mortality</HI> and it's Consequents.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Of these in their Order.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> is <HI>Di∣vine.</HI> It is from GOD, by his Soveraign Constitution and Appointment. <HI>I said, Ye are Gods.</HI> It is not barely a <HI>Permissi∣on</HI> of Divine Providence, but a <HI>Divine Institution</HI> that there be Government in the World. It is no difficulty to distin∣guish between particular <HI>Forms</HI> of Go∣vernment, and Government it self; be∣tween the <HI>Persons</HI> Exalted to Govern∣ment, and the several Orders and De∣grees of such in a State, and that Power which is devolved on them: The former are of <HI>Humane Determination,</HI> and Ap∣poinment; the latter of <HI>Divine Ordina∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Species</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> of Civil Go∣vernment in the World is Various: There is a Democracy, Aristocracy, Monarchy,
<PB N="12" REF="001484_0014_0FB3547F2D4D8CA8"/>
and there is a mixture of these; where the Powers of Each are Limited, and brought to an happy Poise; where <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Privilege</HI> are so twisted together, and inlay'd in the Foundation of the Constitution, as not to bear a seperation without a mutual Destruction; Power cant be Exercised, but the Privileges of the Ruled must be Maintained; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Privilege be Enjoyed, unless the Power of Rulers be Asserted and Supported. Now it cannot be say'd that This or the Other particular Species of Government is Instituted by GOD for this or that People. Nor is it supposeable that there is, or ever was, any State or Nation, that did inviolably, without some <HI>Alteration Essential,</HI> maintain the same Form of Go∣vernment. To be sure <HI>Israel,</HI> GOD's Favourite People, had not always the same Model of Government; nor did GOD, who was, in a distinguishing Style <HI>their King,</HI> Ever prescribe them such a <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Rule,</HI> which they might on no terms Vary from. <HI>Athens, Sparta,</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> which in their Day appeared fixed in the full Centre of Light and Glory, suffer'd
<PB N="13" REF="001484_0015_0FB3548157C16BC0"/>
several Revolutions and Changes in the main Frame of their Administrations: Nor has the Form of Government in our Nation, been just the same from the be∣ginning; which all must own that are not Strangers to our <HI>English</HI> Story. The Determination of what Particular Form should take place in this or that Nation, has been left to the Wisdom of the Na∣tions; as long as the General design of Rule is provided for, and not Subverted. That Form which is most adapted for one People, may not be for another; Considering the various Customs, Tem∣pers, Policies, Interests of Nations of Differing Climates.</P>
<P>But this notwithstanding, that there must be <HI>Government</HI> is not from the bare Will of men, but from the Most High, who <HI>Ruleth</HI> in the <HI>Kingdoms of Men,</HI> and giveth it to whom so ever he will: He has put his Soveraign Sanction upon it; and made it a fixed Ordinance of Heaven, that there be a Rule over Men; The <HI>God of Israel</HI> has say'd it, and the <HI>Rock of Israel</HI> has spoken it.</P>
<P>There are Various <HI>Degrees</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001484_0016_0FB354892793B6C0"/>
of men Engaged in the Administrations of Rule; who have differing Styles and Powers under Various Limitations, and Each Degree have their proper Sphere to move and act in: And the wayes of Ex∣alting men to the Seat of Government, whether <HI>Supream</HI> or <HI>Subordinate,</HI> have been differing: and none of these have a special immediate <HI>Stamp of Divinity</HI> upon them. However it is the Soveraign Plea∣sure of Heaven that there should be Or∣der, Superiority and Rule in Civil So∣ciety's; and all Rulers of what Degree soever are <HI>Ordain'd of God.</HI></P>
<P>This truth stands in the strongest Point of Light in the Word of GOD; and will be Legible after all the attempts of any to Obscure it. The unerring Oracles of Heaven has lay'd the Foundation of Civil Government firm in <HI>Divine Insti∣tution.</HI> What short of this can be inten∣ded in many places? <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 6. The <HI>Powers that be,</HI> are <HI>Ordain'd of God. And there is no Power but of God.</HI> Has not God say'd, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 15. By me Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Justice? Why are Rulers called <HI>God▪s Ministers? Rom.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="001484_0017_0FB3549076B68010"/>
13. 4. Is it not a Command of Heaven? <HI>Deut.</HI> 16. 18. <HI>Judges and Officers shalt thou make thee in all thy Gates?</HI> Nothing surely short of Divine Ordination could justify those Apostolick Enforcements of Sub∣mission to Rulers, not only <HI>for Wrath,</HI> but <HI>for Conscience sake;</HI> not barely for <HI>Man'</HI>s, but for <HI>the Lord's sake, Rom.</HI> 13. 5. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 13. Were not the Original of Power from GOD, it could never be say'd, that he that resisteth the <HI>Power,</HI> resisteth the <HI>Or∣dinance</HI> of GOD, as, <HI>Rom</HI> 13. 2.</P>
<P>And this <HI>Institution</HI> of Government, is founded on Reason; and GOD has done it in Infinite Wisdom, and in Kindness to men. There would doubtless have been Order and Civil Subordination among men, had they still walked in the blissful Shades of Paradise in their Native Light, Purity, and Glory. Sure we may be since the Apostasy, there is Absolute Ne∣cessity of Superiority, and Power in some, and Inferiority and Submission as to o∣thers. He well understood the Nature of men, and of Humane Societies, that say'd, <HI>Nihil AEqualitate ipsa inequalius.</HI> That nothing is more unequal than E∣quality.
<PB N="16" REF="001484_0018_0FB3549C588A8820"/>
Were there no Government, all Mankind would be Engaged in an Un∣natural State of <HI>War.</HI> There could be nothing of Beauty, Proportion, Strength, Unity, Order in Societies: <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> would be Exposed to fatal Inva∣sions. The Flood-gates of Lusts would be open, and a Deluge of Sin and Woe would Sweep away all that is pleasant &amp; desireable in the World. Men would be like <HI>Fishes</HI> in the Sea, and as <HI>Beasts</HI> in the Wilderness, the greater devour the less. Was it not a Terrible Day with Israel, when that Complaint was moaned out? <HI>There was no King in Israel, but every one did that which was right in his own Eyes.</HI> GOD by appointing Government has con∣sulted the good of the World. <HI>Levelism,</HI> is therefore an open Defiance to GOD, his Wisdom and Will, as well as the Reason of Mankind. Thus we have seen the <HI>Di∣vine Original</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> asserted: and this is no undue Complement to Govern∣ment for <HI>GOD Himself</HI> has said it: <HI>I said ye are Gods.</HI> And so we come to the Se∣cond Article to be consider'd, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001484_0019_0FB354A0F901EEE0"/>
<HI>II.</HI> We are to consider the <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Title</HI> put upon Rulers. They are <HI>Gods</HI> &amp; <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Most High:</HI> And it is not an Empty Name, but full both of <HI>Dignity</HI> &amp; <HI>Duty.</HI> This Character assert∣ed, and adorned by the vertues it leads to, will give us the most beautiful view of the Glory of Rulers; which they may pursue with the greatest Stretch of all their Powers.</P>
<P>And if we would take a <HI>view</HI> of what of Glory and Duty is included in this Divine Character and Name, that GOD has put upon them; Let us Consider three things, which seem Evidently intended, and poin∣ted at in this Title, and under which the Glory of their Character is comprehended.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Character intends that Rulers are Gods, as they are <HI>Gods Vice-gerents,</HI> and <HI>Deputies,</HI> and as they bear his visible <HI>Image.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It Suggests that the <HI>Design</HI> of the Institution of Civil Government is, That <HI>Rulers</HI> may be <HI>Gods</HI> to a People, <HI>i. e. Pub∣lick</HI> and great <HI>Blessings.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It Suggests that Rulers can only <HI>Assert</HI> the <HI>Dignity</HI> of their Character;
<PB N="18" REF="001484_0020_0FB354A6557DC138"/>
and answer the <HI>End</HI> of their Institution by Imitating the Blessed GOD, and making his Government, their <HI>Pattern,</HI> and <HI>Stan∣dard.</HI> Nothing less I think can be in∣tended in this Title; and hardly any thing beyond, but what may be reduced under one or other of these Heads. Which we are now to Consider.</P>
<P>I. <HI>Rulers are Gods,</HI> as they are GOD's <HI>Vicegerents,</HI> and bear his <HI>Visible Image.</HI> These stand in GOD's Place, represent his Person, and act by his Authority, and Commission. The Power of the greatest Potentate on Earth is not <HI>Inherent</HI> in him, but is a <HI>Derivative;</HI> and but a faint Beam of that Power which is in GOD in it's <HI>full force</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> Essentially and Inde∣pendently: For GOD is the Source and <HI>Original</HI> of all Power; there is no Power but what is derived from him, depends on him, is limited by him, and is subor∣dinate to him, and accountable. GOD is the Supream Governour among the Nations; It is his Prerogative to Rule in the Kingdoms of Men; and has Right, as well as Might, to give them to whom he Pleases, to Set up, and Spurn down
<PB N="19" REF="001484_0021_0FB354A9B9E57CC8"/>
Rulers at Pleasure; and when he pours Contempt upon Princes, cuts asunder their Spirits, and is terrible to the Kings of the Earth, none can say to him what dost thou? He has both <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Ability</HI> to Govern All by himself, with∣out the Mediation of any Second Being; but he has chosen in wise Condescention to set up Men of the same Make and Infirmities with our selves, whose Terrors might not over-power us, to Act in his Name and Stead: All Government be∣longs Originally to GOD himself, but he has deputed &amp; delegated Magistrates to act for him, and in Subordination to him; and to these his Substitutes he has Com∣municated Power and Judgment: By GOD<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8 16.</NOTE> <HI>Princes Rule, Nobles,</HI> and <HI>all the Judges</HI> of the Earth. The Throne they are Seated on is GOD's. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29. 23. <HI>Solomon Sat upon the Throne of the</HI> LORD, <HI>as King.</HI> It is his Sword of Justice that they are Arm'd with, and must be Weilded for him, and in his Service. <HI>The Judgment is the</HI> LORD's. <HI>Deut.</HI> 1. 17.</P>
<P>It is vain indeed to pretend that this
<PB N="20" REF="001484_0022_0FB354AE4CED6708"/>
Power is derived immediately from GOD; but mediately in various ways according to the diverse Constitutions of Kingdoms, and States: It may not be asserted that the particular Persons on whom the Bur∣den of Government is devolved, are of GOD's special <HI>Designation</HI> and <HI>Nomina∣tion:</HI> yet they hold under GOD, they are Gods subordinate to him whose Name is JEHOVAH; His Authority they are vested with, and his Power they Exert in the discharge of the Duties of their Station. These are the <HI>Shields</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and as such belong to GOD. <HI>Psal.</HI> 47 <HI>ult.</HI> Their Power and Work is GOD's. Hence <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> from this Considera∣tion made his Charge to his Judges the more Solemn. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19. 6. <HI>He say'd to the Judges; take heed what ye do: for ye Judge not for Man, but for the</HI> LORD, <HI>who is with you in the Judgment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Rulers as they are delegated by GOD, so they bear his <HI>Image,</HI> and the visible Impress of his Glory and Great∣ness. There is not only an Invisible and Spiritual Image of GOD, which consists in Righteousness and all the Graces of
<PB N="21" REF="001484_0023_0FB354B24C03A348"/>
Holiness: But there is an External and Visible Image of GOD, which consists in the External Characters of Glory, Power and Majesty; which are impressed on such, as are Exalted to <HI>Rule</HI> over men. Agreeably, Rulers are <HI>Living Images</HI> of the Great LORD of the World, whose Substitutes they are. A visible Divine Glory is shed upon them; the bright Rays of Divine Greatness, and Power do in∣circle them: which Challenge Awe and Reverence from all about them; and the due apprehension hereof is enough to in∣spire Rulers with the most Noble Re∣solves to act in a becoming subordinati∣on to, and as may make an agreeable Representation of GOD, with whom is Dominion and Fear.</P>
<P>By their <HI>Office, Authority</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> they Participate in a Degree of that Power, which all the Armies of Heaven stoop before; and hereby make distin∣guishing approaches to GOD, and bear some faint Resemblance of him, who sits on the Throne of Majesty; tho' after all <HI>Infinite</HI> and <HI>Awful</HI> is <HI>the Distance.</HI> In this respect Rulers are Gods. And when
<PB N="22" REF="001484_0024_0FB354B3BA6D2F10"/>
these External Characters of Power and Greatness are found in Conjunction with the more Noble Characters of Inward Greatness, their Title will appear with a Diviner Lustre, and their Authority more Awful and Influential. This is the first thing included in the Title given them.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Title Suggests, the great. <HI>De∣sign</HI> of the Institution of Government a∣mong men, is that Rulers may be <HI>Gods</HI> to a People, <HI>i. e.</HI> Diffusive Blessings to the Publick: When the Great LORD of the World is pleased to style himself the GOD of a Person or People, it certainly intends that He will Bless them, and Promote their Happiness; Employ his Wisdom, Power, Justice and Goodness with his other Perfections, for their Peace and Prosperity, Security, Protection and Glo∣ry. In conformity to this, Rulers are <HI>Gods,</HI> when they Employ their Authority, and Influence, act the Vertues and Powers of Government they are Endow'd with, for the Good and Happiness of the People under their Conduct. To be great <HI>Blessings</HI> to Men is to be <HI>Gods</HI> to them. And such have most of <HI>Divinity,</HI> true Majesty and
<PB N="23" REF="001484_0025_0FB354B506A6F508"/>
Glory, as dispense the most benign and cherishing Influences upon all about them; and are most useful and serviceable to the true Interest of the State they stand related to. Power and Knowledge will not alone constitute a Divine Greatness; These are found to a great degree in the most <HI>Malig∣nant Beings,</HI> who are nothing but Opposi∣tion to the Nature, and Government of GOD. It is not a true <HI>Divine Greatness</HI> and Superiority to have more Power, Riches and Knowledge than others; but to Em∣ploy all these Advantages to do more <HI>Good</HI> to the World; and be greater blessings to those under their Inspection. Now Great∣ness appears with Advantage; such are like the Great Light of Heaven which dispen∣ses its Influences far and wide; they are as a Publick Fountain, whose waters flow down to all; and the whole People drink of them, and are refreshed thereby; and every one will be ready to own the Cha∣racter they bear, stile them <HI>Gods, and Chil∣dren of the Highest.</HI></P>
<P>And thus <HI>this Splended Title,</HI> given to Rulers, leads us to the <HI>Original design</HI> of their <HI>Institution,</HI> which is the <HI>Publick Good.</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="001484_0026_0FB354B6821A6BF0"/>
It tells us what the Governing design of Government ought to be in all acts of Power whether <HI>Legislative</HI> or <HI>Executive:</HI> What Blessings all Rulers ought to be, and <HI>Good Ones</HI> will be to a People. Their Power is designed but as<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13. 4.</NOTE> a <HI>Ministry</HI> under GOD, for the good of Men: That under their shadow they may have sweet Repose, Lead Quiet and Peaceable Lives in all Godliness and Honesty: They are to be the <HI>Guardians</HI> of their Religion and Property, their Liberties, Civil &amp; Sacred: That in their Watchfulness, Care, and ma∣ny Fatigues, their People may securely sit under their own Vines and Figtrees, take their Rest, and enjoy their Lives, Estates, Friends, and innocent Pleasures without Annoyance. That Rulers are to be the <HI>Guardian Angels</HI> of the State to Watch o∣ver, and Minister to it: As the <HI>Lights</HI> of the World to direct, warm and cherish all under their Influence; to be as the <HI>Foun∣dations,</HI> and <HI>Pillars</HI> of a building; who are to preserve the State from a <HI>Dissolution.</HI></P>
<P>The very Nature of things, and the Primary Intention of GOD in the Ordina∣tion
<PB N="25" REF="001484_0027_0FB354B9DDB51A40"/>
of Civil Government, certainly points us to the general Happiness &amp; Prosperity, which Rulers ought to have <HI>in view.</HI> The true measure of Government we have a∣greeably laid down by the Spirit of GOD, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 3. As <HI>a Rule over Men,</HI> which is thus descanted on by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Barnet.</NOTE> a <HI>Masterly hand.</HI> <Q>It is a <HI>Rule,</HI> and not an <HI>Absolute Domini∣on,</HI> or an Arbitrary Power, without Lawes and Measures; It is a <HI>Rule</HI> over <HI>Men,</HI> and not a Power like that, which we have over <HI>Beasts,</HI> Rule suited to the Principles of Reason, to the Nature of Man, and the Ends of Civil Society; it is a Conduct over free and reasonable Beings, who need indeed to be <HI>Governed,</HI> but ought not to be <HI>Broken</HI> by the force, and weight of Power.</Q></P>
<P>It was never designed either by GOD or Men; that some should be advanced to Power and Dignity, to raise their parti∣cular Glory, either in Opposition to, or Se∣peration from the happiness of the Pub∣lick. Rulers have Power, but it is a li∣mited Authority; limited by the Will of GOD, and Right Reason, by the General
<PB N="26" REF="001484_0028_0FB354BAF419FB70"/>
Rules of Government, and the particular Lawes Stated in a Land. Government was never ordained that Some men might have Advantage to be <HI>Beasts of Prey,</HI> to the feebler part of Mankind; nor that Others should be under a necessity of becoming <HI>Beasts of Burden;</HI> for this would be sub∣versive of the very End of all Rule. Men enjoy the Name and Power of GOD, not to make themselves Great and Terrible; to make any tremble but the <HI>Evil doer;</HI> not that they may have the Opportunity to sa∣tisfy the Ravenous Lusts of Dominion, Pride and Covetousness: for thus they would bear the Character and Image, not of GOD, but of the <HI>Grand Enemy</HI> and De∣stroyer of Mankind. But the design of all the Power, Greatness, and Superiority communicated to them from GOD, is that they may approve themselves <HI>Gods</HI> to the World, <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Greatest Benefactors.</HI> When Rulers answer therefore this Character, they will have no greater joy than to see their People flourish in Wealth, Strength and Peace; famous for all those Vertues of Righteousness, that Exalt a Nation: They will make the true Glory and Pros∣perity
<PB N="27" REF="001484_0029_0FB354BEB252E770"/>
of their People their <HI>Last view</HI> in all their Administrations; and Esteem it as their <HI>Own Glory;</HI> and with the most sen∣sible refreshment, in the most Noble and Divine sense, partal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Publick hap∣piness, and of every part, as if the whole were their <HI>own Propriety.</HI> Such are <HI>Gods,</HI> and the <HI>Most High</HI> will own them his <HI>Chil∣dren.</HI> This is the End of Government, &amp; is the Second thing comprehended in the Divine Character put on them. We now come to the Third &amp; Last thing included in this Title.</P>
<P N="3">3. It suggests that Rulers can only <HI>Assert</HI> the <HI>Dignity</HI> of their Character, and <HI>Answer</HI> the <HI>End</HI> of their Institution, by <HI>Imitating</HI> the blessed GOD, and making his <HI>Government</HI> their <HI>Pattern</HI> and <HI>Standard.</HI> They must be <HI>God-like,</HI> in their Personal Endowments and Publick Managements. They must be <HI>Gods</HI> by resembling the bles∣sed GOD in the Personal Excellencies of their Minds, in those Vertues &amp; Graces, which are the Image of GOD on the Soul. <HI>External Dignity</HI> challenges <HI>Inherent Ex∣cellency:</HI> The greatest Glory, Perfection, Beauty and Nobility, must consist in a con∣formity
<PB N="28" REF="001484_0030_0FB354C14417ED88"/>
to the Communicable Perfections, and Beauties of the Divine Nature; and the Participations of these Vertues, and Divine Characters, which are Propounded for the Reasonable Creatures Imitation in his <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Measure.</HI> Without this Resemblance they will foully slurr their Character, reproach Government, and render it Ridiculous: <HI>Folly</HI> set in great <HI>Dignity</HI> will make but an odd Figure; and afford a spectacle which will be rather hooted at, than reverenced and obey'd.</P>
<P>And <HI>as</HI> they are to <HI>Imitate GOD</HI> in the Sublime qualities of the <HI>Mind;</HI> so in their <HI>Administrations.</HI> Rulers must set GODS Government before them, and endeavour to Form themselves in their whole Ma∣nagement by this perfect Model. Their <HI>Rule</HI> must be a <HI>Lively Emblem</HI> of the Beauty and Excellency, Perfection and Advantage of <HI>GODS Government.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is necessary to observe, that GOD, tho' He be <HI>Lord Paramount</HI> of Hea∣ven and Earth; and his Sovereignty un∣accountable, being Infinite, Absolute and Independent; yet He alwayes Exercises his Supream Authority according to the
<PB N="29" REF="001484_0031_0FB354C61D8E3538"/>
<HI>Rules</HI> of the most Consummate Wisdom, Spotless Righteousness, Unblemish'd In∣tegrity, and Diffusive Goodness. He governs not by unaccountable Will, or in∣constant humour, which are imperfections his Nature can't suffer, but by <HI>Stable Mea∣sures,</HI> as may best suit the Nature and Cir∣cumstances of his Subjects, and the Noble End of his Government.</P>
<P>Hence Rulers, of all Orders, ought to conform to and regulate themselves in all their Administrations, by this Divine Standard. Their Government should be a <HI>Transcript,</HI> and <HI>Visible Image</HI> of the <HI>Di∣vine Rule.</HI> And the more Exactly they conform to this Measure; the nearer they approach in their Rule over Men to the Divine Pattern; the brighter will be the Characters of Divine Glory reflected on them; This Imitation of GOD is necessary to Maintain the just honours of their Station, to answer the End of their Elevation, and the design of Government it self. And here I shall mention a few Capital Articles, in which Rulers <HI>as Gods,</HI> are to <HI>Imitate</HI> the <HI>Glorious GOD:</HI> All which will be found Essential to the Cha∣racter of <HI>Gods,</HI> imprinted on them. As,</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="001484_0032_0FB354CA5F2BF718"/>
I. As <HI>Gods</HI> they must be <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Skil∣full.</HI> The Supream Governour of the World is the <HI>Only Wise GOD:</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. 17. He is Wisdom in the Abstract: <HI>Prov</HI> 8. 14. <HI>Counsel is Mine, and Sound Wisdom: I am Understanding.</HI> This Attribute appears with Surprizing brightness in the Govern∣ment of the World. When the Methods of Providence are most Unsearchable, there is then Reason to cry out; <HI>Oh the depth! both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of GOD!</HI> He fully understands the Nature, and Powers of all Creatures; all things in their several Relations and Dependencies, the fitness of Means to propounded Ends; and hence acts all things according to the Rules of the most Consummate Wisdom; and has in all Ages so turned the Wheels of Providence, as might suit the End of Government: &amp; as became the infallible Conduct of Him, who is <HI>Great in Counsel,</HI> That is placed <HI>above</HI> on the THRONE.</P>
<P><HI>In proprotion,</HI> Rulers on Earth are <HI>Gods,</HI> because they are herein to resemble the Eternal KING, the only Wise GOD; and must partake of his Wisdom. This qua∣lification <HI>Moses</HI> gives of Rulers: <HI>Deut.</HI> 1. 13.
<PB N="31" REF="001484_0033_0FB354CD09BED7B0"/>
<HI>Take ye Wise</HI> and <HI>Understanding Men.</HI> The want of Skill &amp; Prudence in Rulers, will bring Government into Contempt: The <HI>End</HI> of Rule can't be attained, nor the <HI>Dignity</HI> of their Station supported. Blind Guides, unskilful Pilots are a Solecism in terms; &amp; threaten no common mischief to those that are under their Conduct. It is condemned by the wife <HI>Socrates,</HI> as an Error too common in the World, yet most fatal to the good of it; that while several years are thought little enough to be spent in acquiring the skill of any Trade, how Mean and Mechanical so ever it may be; yet, in case of Publick Administrations of Government, which of all Professions has most of Difficulty and Intricacy, every one is ready to think himself abundantly qua∣lifyed; and such, as are of very Indifferent improvements in Knowledge, are too of∣ten Exalted, and set in Places of Dignity. It is a judgment, bigg with many Woes, when<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah 3 3. 4.</NOTE> God takes away the <HI>Prudent</HI> from a People, and gives them <HI>Children</HI> to be their Princes, and <HI>Babes</HI> to Rule over them. The wise Man Pronounces a Woe upon
<PB N="32" REF="001484_0034_0FB354CF3788A8D8"/>
such a People: <HI>Eccl.</HI> 10. 16. <HI>Woe unto thee, O Land, when thy King is a Child.</HI></P>
<P>On the contrary, it is an happy Omen upon a Land, when Rulers are like the Heads of Issachar:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 12. 32</NOTE> Men that had <HI>Un∣derstanding of the Times,</HI> to <HI>Know what Isra∣el ought to do.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ubi Praeses fuerit Philosophus, ibi Civitas Erit faelix▪</NOTE> That City, says a Wise Heathen, is happy, whose Governour is a Philosopher, <HI>i. e.</HI> a Man of Wisdom. And a greater Philosopher has assured us, that by a <HI>Man of Understanding the State of a Land is prolonged,</HI> Prov. 28. 2. Such Ru∣lers are singular blessings, which GOD, in love to a People, sometimes blesses them with. Thus the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> pro∣nounces Israel happy in the Wisdom of <HI>so∣lomon:</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 9. 7. <HI>Happy are these thy Men, happy are these thy Servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy Wisdom.</HI> This will render the Persons of Rulers Venerable in the Esteem of their People; and their Authority more forcible and awful.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 King. 3. 28.</NOTE> Thus all Israel feared <HI>Solo∣mon,</HI> for they saw the <HI>Wisdom of GOD</HI> was in him. All other Endowments, requisite
<PB N="33" REF="001484_0035_0FB354D26C8F8050"/>
for Government, will be but of little, and uncertain use without Prudence. <HI>Zeal</HI> &amp; <HI>Courage</HI> without skill to direct their influ∣ences, and temper their heat, will many times do more harm than good; they will either mistake their object, or exceed in degree; which too often causes no small confusions. <HI>Integrity,</HI> and good <HI>Intention</HI> are not sufficient to secure Government from contempt, nor the State from Ruine, without a Spirit of Judgment to direct the choice of proper Means for the Publick safety: This Skill and Prudence gives a lustre to other Excellences that qualify Men for Government, and render them influential to the happiness of a Common Wealth. It was <HI>Davids</HI> Glory, and <HI>Israels</HI> safety; that he was <HI>Wise as an Angel of GOD;</HI> and guided them by the <HI>Skilfulness</HI> of his hands, as well as according to the <HI>Integrity</HI> of his heart, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78. 72.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged, that the same degree of Wisdom, nay the same kind of Knowledge, is not equally necessary to every Ruler: As there are different De∣grees and Stations in Government; so Wisdom has its several gradations; and is,
<PB N="34" REF="001484_0036_0FB354D3CE4EEB08"/>
as to <HI>Sort,</HI> and <HI>Degree,</HI> to be proportioned to the several Characters, and Offices that are sustained: That Knowledge that may qualify for the <HI>Counsel Board,</HI> may not for the <HI>Tribunal of Justice:</HI> Superior Wisdom is requisite for a Superior Station in Go∣vernment: Yet every Order of Rulers must have a due proportion of it.</P>
<P>Again, The State and Circumstance of a People may be more perplexed, difficult, and intricate at one Day than an other; either by reason of the darkness and intri∣cacy of Divine Providence, or the preva∣lency of evil humours among a People themselves: and such a day requires great∣er force and light of Understanding in Ru∣lers: A Storm requires greater skill than a calm.</P>
<P>Thus the stile of <HI>Gods</HI> requires that Ru∣lers resemble GOD in this Divine Excel∣lency, that they may maintain their Glory, and answer the End of their Creation. There must be Wisdom to judge what Laws are proper to be made, and what Sanctions are proper to enforce them; there must be Wisdom to understand the Publick Powers, and Private Rights and
<PB N="35" REF="001484_0037_0FB354D607197D58"/>
Privileges to be preserved, and the Laws which are to be Executed: There is an happy <HI>Dexterity</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI> in governing, and administring the affairs of the Publick to the best advantage; which is a rare Talent, which Rulers are allow'd to Covet. This comprehends in it a suitable Know∣lege of the complexion and humours of the People committed to their trust; what Distempers they are most lyable to, and what Remedies most proper for them, and what the right Seasons to make the Ap∣plications whether for Prevention, or af∣ter Remedy: There must be skill in the general Maxims of Government, and Pru∣dence in a pertinent Application of these to Emergent cases, that by an orderly con∣duct the great affairs &amp; designs of a State, be carry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d on to an happy Conclusion: There is to this requisite a Penetrating <HI>Sa∣gacity</HI> to foresee Publick dangers, &amp; a sea∣sonable <HI>Precaution</HI> to guard against them: And for this End Rulers should be men of deep Thought, good Experience, and of great Presence of Mind; that they may not be shoved beyond their reason by a∣ny unexpected Emergencies; but that
<PB N="36" REF="001484_0038_0FB354D7729F6960"/>
they may maintain their temper unshockt, and well lay'd designs unbroken, what ever may assault them.</P>
<P>Thus, they that are <HI>Gods</HI> among Men must labour to partake of Divine Wisdom, and resemble GOD, who is wonderful in Counsel, and excellent in Working. Thus God-like was <HI>Joseph,</HI> and <HI>Daniel;</HI> an Ex∣cellent Spirit, the Spirit of Wisdom, like to GOD, was found in them; On the ac∣count of which they were raised to the first Seat of Government; <HI>Joseph</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Court of <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Persia.</HI> And when Rulers are destitute of this Ex∣cellency, their Dignity will be degraded, their Duty neglected, and will too well de∣serve the Character given of <HI>Coniah, not Gods,</HI> but despised broken <HI>Idols; Vessels,</HI> wherein is <HI>no pleasure,</HI> Jer. 22. 28.</P>
<P N="2">2. Rulers, <HI>as Gods,</HI> must be <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Just</HI> in all their Administrations.</P>
<P>The Sceptre of GODS Throne is a <HI>Scepter of Righteousness:</HI> Clouds &amp; Dark∣ness many times incircle the Throne of Heaven, yet RIGHTEOUSNESS and <HI>Judgment</HI> are always the <HI>Habitation there∣of:</HI> For he is the <HI>Just GOD,</HI> and can do no
<PB N="37" REF="001484_0039_0FB354D982484250"/>
wrong. And nothing can be more oppo∣site to the Divine Government, than when Iniquity sitteth in the Seat of Justice; and Oppression is found in the Place of Judg∣ment. <HI>Jehosophat</HI> enforces his charge up∣on his Judges with the Consideration of the Divine Righteousness, &amp; Impartiality. 2 Chron. 19. 6, 7. <HI>Take heed what you do, for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment: Wherefore let the fear of the Lord be upon you: for there is no iniquity with the Lord God, nor Respect of Persons, nor taking of Gifts.</HI></P>
<P>Herein Rulers are to approve them∣selves <HI>Gods.</HI> It is a Statute of the Great Law-giver of the World, that they which Rule over Men <HI>be Just,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 3. Righ∣teousness is the Glory of GOD; and an Imitation of Him herein will be the ho∣nour of Rulers, and the happiness of the Ruled. Knowledge without Justice will degenerate into Craft &amp; Subtility, which can never be safe for the Publick: where Righteousness is wanting, the <HI>deeper the Management,</HI> the more <HI>Pernicious the Power.</HI></P>
<P>The Title of Gods, requires, that Ru∣lers be like <HI>Job▪</HI> that Great Man of the
<PB N="38" REF="001484_0040_0FB354DA7AC4FBA0"/>
East, Job 29. 14. <HI>I put on Righteousness, &amp; it cloathed me: My judgment was a Robe &amp; Diadem.</HI> This quality has consecrated the Name of <HI>Aristides;</HI> and he is justly celebrated by the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch in vita Aristid.</NOTE> Historian, that when other great Men of the World, had assum∣ed Names that carryed in them Power &amp; Violence; as Thunderers, Conquerors, Destroyers of Cities, Hawks and Eagles, He assumed the more Kingly and Divine Appellation of <HI>Just.</HI> And the Historian, tho' an Heathen, well descants upon the Divine Excellency of Justice; and says, Justice makes such as are in Power &amp; Au∣thority to lead the Life of a God; but the contrary that of a Beast. Herein there∣fore the <HI>Rule</HI> GOD has appointed over Men, should be a fair Transcript of the Righteousness &amp; Equity of the Divine Ad∣ministrations. Agreeably the Wisdom of Heaven has taught us, that the Throne is Established by Righteousness, <HI>Prov.</HI> 16. 12. And GOD by the Prophet calls upon Ru∣lers: Amos 5. 24. <HI>Let Judgment run down as waters, and Righteousness as a mighty stream. Judgment run down as waters,</HI> Q D.
<PB N="39" REF="001484_0041_0FB354DE4E232FB8"/>
That Rulers are to be Living Fountains of Justice among men, and Righteousness must flow from them in their Administra∣tions as naturally, fully, and freely as Streams from a <HI>Living Fountain,</HI> with Ease and Plenty, and for Universal use; where all may come and drink, and be re∣freshed; <HI>Streams</HI> that will Water and Cherish all; guard and secure what ever is good among a People, and make it with their moisture to thrive and flourish; and <HI>Righteousness as a mighty Stream: as an un∣passible River.</HI> So the <HI>Seventy</HI> read it, <HI>i. e.</HI> Let the Streams of Justice be so deep and wide that the biggest, boldest and most subtle Transgressors may despair to leap over, or ford them: But be stopt in their Career, and brought to a stand by them. As a <HI>Land flood,</HI> as some others Read it, which rolls down with irresistible Rapidi∣ty, Strength and Violence, and bears away all Opposition before it: thus the Admi∣nistrations of Justice must proceed with that Zeal, Resolution and Force as to over∣come all Impediments, Discouragements and Temptations, that Oppose. This would give a State the Reputation of a <HI>City</HI> of
<PB N="40" REF="001484_0042_0FB354DFE8D75280"/>
<HI>Righteousness,</HI> and a <HI>Faithful City.</HI> Hence, this Character of Rulers requires that <HI>Righteousness be the Girdle of their Loins:</HI> That they take care that Righteous Laws be Enacted, none but such, and all such, as are necessary for the Safety of the Religion &amp; Liberties of a People: Justice must be Exercised in guarding the Laws with Righteous Penalties, from the Out∣rages and Insults of the Sons of <HI>Belial:</HI> There must be Righteousness in the Ex∣ecution of the Laws, both in matters of Civil Justice, and Criminal: Rulers must be Just to GOD in maintaining His Right; to their own Characters, and to their Peo∣ple; Just to the Laws, and the Established Constitution they are under; and Subor∣dinate Rulers must be Just to their Prince, as well as to the whole Community, and every Member of it: They must take care that they do not Pervert Justice them∣selves, nor suffer others under them to Pervert it, and turn Judgment into Worm∣wood; that GOD may not complain that <HI>He looked for Judgment,</HI> but behold <HI>Op∣pression;</HI> for <HI>Righteousness,</HI> but behold <HI>a Cry.</HI></P>
<P>Hence their Administrations of justice
<PB N="41" REF="001484_0043_0FB354E1F23E3E60"/>
must be with <HI>Impartiality;</HI> for this is Di∣vine. This Charge <HI>Moses</HI> gave to Rulers, <HI>Deut.</HI> 1. 17. Ye shall not <HI>respect Persons in Judgment;</HI> but you shall hear the <HI>Small</HI> as <HI>well as the Great;</HI> You shall not be <HI>a∣fraid of the face of Man,</HI> for the Judgment is GOD's. A Criminal Partiality in Ru∣lers portends Ruine to a State. It be∣comes Rulers as <HI>Gods</HI> not to be swayed by Personal Favour or Prejudice, by Pri∣vate Advantages, and Views. Friendship must not byass Rulers; but they must be like <HI>Levi</HI> know neither Father nor Mo∣ther, Brother nor Sister in the cause of Justice. There is good Instruction in the Carriage of that Heathen, who upon his Advancement into Government, took a solemn Farewel of his Friends and Rela∣tions; intimating thereby that they must not expect from him any Regards in the Discharge of his Office, but what others should have an equal Claim to. And it was a just Rebuke, that <HI>Rutilius</HI> a Noble <HI>Roman,</HI> gave to a particular Friend, who Reproach'd him for Breach of Friendship, in denying his Unjust Petition; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that he could with Ease bear the loss of such
<PB N="42" REF="001484_0044_0FB354E2B6CF76B0"/>
a Friend, whose Friendship was to be pre∣served on such hard Terms, as breaking through the Rules of Justice and Honour. To accept Persons in Judgment is not good, <HI>Prov</HI> 24. 25. Rulers must not be lead out of the way of Just and Right, either by undue Favour to Friends, or unjust Prejudice against Enemies. There is also a Criminal Tenderness &amp; Compassion to the Poor, as well as a Faulty Respect to the Rich, which is equally an Enemy to Justice, and must be avoided: The Small as well as Great are to be heard; yet the Small no more than Great to be Respected in their Cause.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Rulers are not to be moved by Fear; they must not fear the Faces of men. Courage is a necessary Qualification in a Ruler. The Ballances of Justice should be held steadily; but this can't be where Fear makes the Heart and Hand to trem∣ble. They that are like <HI>Ephraim, Silly Doves, without an Heart,</HI> are a Reproach to Government; and can never maintain the Honour, nor discharge the Duties of their Character. The Sword of Justice in a Cowards Hand will never be, either a
<PB N="43" REF="001484_0045_0FB354E6ADD640C0"/>
Protection to the Innocent, or Terror to the Guilty.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> As <HI>Gods</HI> they must not be in∣fluenced by Private Advantage: It is un∣godlike for Rulers to Cry, <HI>Give, Give.</HI> It is inconsistent with the End of Rule, and will be a deep stain upon Government; when Justice is Bought and Sold: and Ex∣poses Rulers to the Rebukes of a Righ∣teous GOD; for the Tabernacles of Bri∣bery peculiarly ly open to the Devouring Flames of Heaven. And how unbecoming it will be such, who bear the <HI>Name of GOD</HI> upon them thus to Prostitute Justice! Thus Impartial ought Rulers to be in their Administrations. And it is but what the <HI>Reason</HI> of mankind approves of. And the Admonitions hereof were given by the <HI>Thebans,</HI> who were wont to pour∣tray their Rulers <HI>Blind</HI> and <HI>without Hands; Blind</HI> that they might not respect Persons, and without <HI>Hands,</HI> that they might receive no Gifts; which the Wise man tells us will Blind the Eyes of the Wise.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> As Rulers must Administer Justice with <HI>Impartiality,</HI> so they must <HI>Temper</HI> Justice with <HI>Lenity;</HI> for this is
<PB N="44" REF="001484_0046_0FB354EC571057B8"/>
to be like GOD: <HI>Lenity</HI> to Particular Persons, sometimes may be a Publick In∣jury: yet sometimes <HI>Mercy</HI> is Justice; and not to show it would be an Injury. Extream Right is often Extream Wrong. Rulers may be <HI>overmuch Righteous;</HI> when Laws are interpreted in their utmost Ri∣gour, and accordingly Executed, when there is a Latitude in the Law, and the End might be obtained by taking it in the most Favourable sence; <HI>Mercy preserveth the King,</HI> and <HI>upholds his Throne, Prov.</HI> 20. 28. All Laws must not, like <HI>Draco'</HI>s be writ in Blood. Punishments must be pro∣portioned to the Nature, and degree of Crimes. There are the <HI>Rods</HI> as well as <HI>Axes</HI> of Rulers. Thus it is <HI>Divine</HI> in Rulers to temper the severity of Justice with Clemency: It is an Imitation of GOD; for <HI>Judgment</HI> is GOD's <HI>strange Work;</HI> but <HI>Mercy</HI> is his <HI>Delight.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>As Gods</HI> a <HI>Fatherly Affection, Tender∣ness</HI> and <HI>Compassion</HI> to their People must breathe forth in all their Administrations. This is the Character of GOD's Govern∣ment over his People. In <HI>all their Affliction he is Afflicted for them:</HI> And when he is
<PB N="45" REF="001484_0047_0FB354EF22D92C50"/>
constrain'd to chastize them, it is with a Fathers hand and bowels.</P>
<P>And this will be the Glory of <HI>Gods</HI> on Earth, to bear such a Paternal affection to a People as their Children. Of old the Rulers, among several Nations, gloryed in the Name of <HI>Fathers,</HI> as the most honou∣rable Title that could be given them. Thus every King among the Philistines, upon their advancement assumed the appellati∣on of <HI>Abimelech;</HI> the English of which is, the King my Father. Among the Romans, their Consuls, Generals, and afterward their Emperors, were most ambitious of the Name of Fathers, as the brightest Ti∣tle of Honour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Le Compte's Memoirs.</NOTE> And the best as well latest accounts of <HI>China</HI> tell us, that it is a standing Maxim of that Government, that Kings are properly the <HI>Fathers</HI> of their People, and not <HI>Masters</HI> placed in the Throne to be Served by Slaves: And this Idea of their Prince is so deeply imprinted in the Minds of all; that when any Pane∣gyrick is made in praise of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> it is upon this head of his affection to his People; and form his Character not from
<PB N="46" REF="001484_0048_0FB354F04C4B3780"/>
his skill in War, and Politicks, but as he has approved himself a <HI>Father</HI> to them. And this well becomes the Character of all Rulers, if they would conform themselves to the Divine. Their conduct must be gentle, suited to the Infirmities of the State. They must Sympathize with their People in all their difficulties, sorrows; &amp; sensibly resent all the Evil they groan un∣der; even when they suffer thro' their own default, and can't be perswaded by Rulers from those Measures that prove fa∣tal to them: They must be tender of them when infected with evil humours, and the distempers of a perverse Spirit. Their bowels of Compassion must peculiarly move towards them, when they are under deep Apostacies from God, and under ter∣rible impressions of his Wrath, both in Temporal Judgments, &amp; Spiritual Plagues. As the <HI>Head</HI> in the Natural body feels the uneasy State of the whole and each Mem∣ber; so these are to have a most sensible Share, in all the losses, reproaches, burdens &amp; dangers, that annoy their People; &amp; their tenderness must be Exprest in taking the best measures for their Relief &amp; Comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="001484_0049_0FB354F1F4B59378"/>
This Paternal Affection appeared in <HI>Moses,</HI> when GOD's Wrath was breaking in upon the Camp of Israel. So in <HI>David</HI> when the destroying Angel had made such desolations among the Tribes of his People. As <HI>Fathers</HI> Rulers must be like the <HI>Chari∣table Samaritan</HI> pour Wine and Oyl into the Wounds of their People, and bind them up: If once a <HI>Breach</HI> be made they must thrust into the <HI>Gap;</HI> If the <HI>Plague</HI> be begun, they must hasten an <HI>Atonement:</HI> Thus like <HI>Job</HI> they must <HI>Comfort the Mour∣ners.</HI> Thus they will resemble GOD, who is full of Fatherly compassion; who <HI>Delivers the needy, the poor also, and him, that has no helper.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>As Gods,</HI> they must render themselves <HI>Worthy the Trust and Confidence</HI> of their People. It is the Prerogative of the E∣VERLASTING ROCK, GOD AL∣SUFFICIENT, to deserve the Absolute dependence, and Intire confidence of the Rational Creature: And it is his Glory to be Stiled the <HI>GOD of hope,</HI> the <HI>Confidence</HI> of the <HI>Ends of the Earth;</HI> under the Shadow of whose wings men may with Security trust; on whom they may devolve all their cares.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="001484_0050_0FB354F332F9ED40"/>
And both the <HI>Glory</HI> of Rulers, and the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Government,</HI> require that those that are appointed <HI>Gods</HI> on Earth resemble GOD herein. The <HI>Roman Orator</HI> has Stated it as the Height of Glory to Merit that Esteem and Reverence of Men, as to be trusted by them. That a People may with Satisfaction, in Subordination to GOD, commit their Lives, Liberties, Re∣ligion, and Estate to their Guardian-ship, and Patronage. Now besides the En∣dowments already mentioned, there are more peculiarly three Qualifications in Rulers necessary to create, and conciliate this Esteem and Confidence; in which they are to assert the Glory of their Character, and Imitate GOD: <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Integ∣rity, Diligence</HI> and <HI>Activity in their Post;</HI> and a <HI>Steady Conduct.</HI></P>
<P>There is requisite <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Integrity.</HI> It is one Essential Character of the Su∣pream Being that He is a <HI>GOD of Truth, Deut.</HI> 32. 4. And <HI>Jethro</HI> makes it a neces∣sary qualification for Magistrates, <HI>Exod.</HI> 18. 21. That they be <HI>Men of Truth.</HI> It was <HI>Davids</HI> commendation, that he led GOD's People according to the <HI>Integrity of his
<PB N="49" REF="001484_0051_0FB354F594C323C8"/>
heart, Psal.</HI> 78. <HI>ult.</HI> Without this, Know∣ledge, Policy and Power are not Vertues sufficient to demand this Trust and Con∣fidence. Knowledge without this Integ∣rity will render men suspected; and power will render them only formidable; But <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> will put a Divine lustre upon both. It is a crocked Maxim in Politicks,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qui nescit dissimulate, nescit regnare.</NOTE> That the Art of Dissimulation is Essential to the skill of Governing. On the contrary Rulers must have a Sacred regard to the Rules of Truth: There must be Truth in their Words, Promises, and Oaths; their Deportment without Dis∣guise; without the little Arts of <HI>Simulation</HI> or <HI>Dissimulation;</HI> neither pretending what is not, nor concealing or disguising what is. Men of falsehood bear the Image of the <HI>Father of Lies.</HI> But nothing ought to be more firm than the Truth and Word of Government. Such only are fit to Exe∣cute the <HI>Judgment of Truth in the Gates.</HI> This is to be like the <HI>Most High,</HI> the <HI>True GOD;</HI> Such only can Expect the confi∣dence of a People: For falsehood, Hypo∣crisy
<PB N="50" REF="001484_0052_0FB354F926E513B8"/>
and Deceit remove the foundations of Confidence.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> To gain this Trust there is re∣quisite in Rulers <HI>Vigilance, Activity,</HI> and an Awaken'd Application to the duties of their Post. The GOD, and Governour of Israel does never slumber, nor is He ever weary or faint, but watches over his Peo∣ple night and day. A Pattern for such, as Rule over Men. A <HI>Sluggard,</HI> who keeps his Arms folded, is unfit for Govern∣ment. It is the Command of Heaven that Rulers rule with <HI>Diligence:</HI> and <HI>At∣tend Continually</HI> on this very thing: <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 8 &amp; 13. 6. To Rule is the Work of GOD, and his Work must not be done <HI>Negligently.</HI> It is the saying of the First of the Grecian Poets,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homer▪ Iliad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> That a Publick Counsellour may not Sleep a whole night. While others Sleep Magistrates must Watch; while others are secure in their Cabin, these must be at the Helm all Wea∣thers. They must be <HI>Vigilant</HI> to fore see Publick dangers, and <HI>Industrious</HI> to pre∣vent them; to observe Advantages, and to improve them for the good of the Com∣mon-Wealth.
<PB N="51" REF="001484_0053_0FB354FACBFE53E8"/>
They may not be slothful in business if worthy of the <HI>Confidence</HI> of a People. Sloth, Ease and Negligence in Rulers will as infallibly ruine a State, as evil designs. Slothful Rulers will give a loose to the Reins of Government; the Sword of Justice will rust in the Scabbard, and be neither a <HI>Terror</HI> to Evil-doers, not an <HI>Encouragement</HI> to them that do well. Hence a drousy and languishing Age not the fittest for Publick business: But that Age that is best for address and dispatch in Execution, and vigour as well as Se∣dateness in Counsel.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> A <HI>Steady Conduct</HI> in all their Ad∣ministrations is necessary to create a <HI>Con∣fidence.</HI> They must govern themselves by unalterable principles, and fixed Rules, and not by unaccountable humours, or ar∣bitrary will, which is lyable to the great∣est levity and inconstancy. Rulers must not be Trimmers, or Time-servers; and vary according to the humours of the Giddy Populace, which are as variable as the Weather Glass. They are <HI>Foundations</HI> of a State, and therefore must be fixed, and not totter and shake: They are <HI>Pillars,</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="001484_0054_0FB354FFEA84B078"/>
and Pillars must not bend like the Osyer, but stand unshaken like the aged Oak; They are <HI>Lights</HI> that are set on High, and must approve themselves fixed in their Orb, &amp; move like the Sun, who as a Gyant runs his race, &amp; nothing can turn him aside. These must suffer nothing to disconcert them, or break their well digested mea∣sures: Neither fraud nor violence, nei∣ther flattery nor calumny must be able to warp them. That a People may know what to trust to, and expect; and this is Divine; for GOD governs by fixed Rule.</P>
<P>Thus Rulers are by their Zeal for Truth, their Activity, Vigilance, and Steadiness to create a Confidence in them; and their People will find their Persons, and Interests safe under their Administra∣tion, and can securely repose themselves <HI>under their Shadow.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>As Gods,</HI> they must have the same <HI>Noble Designs</HI> and <HI>Purposes in View,</HI> that GOD has. They are by <HI>Office</HI> GOD's Ministers, and it becomes the Eyes of Ser∣vants to be on the hand of their Masters. And ought to carry on the same designs that GOD does in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Government; and
<PB N="53" REF="001484_0055_0FB35504A0721378"/>
study to form their Administrations here∣to. GOD's Government tends to the good of the World; and is especially <HI>de∣sign'd</HI> for the good of his Children, and therein the Exaltation of His Own Name. He has lay'd this Government on the Shoulders of His <HI>ONLY SON,</HI> who is the <HI>MAN</HI> upon the Throne above the Firmament, according to whose direction the <HI>Wheels</HI> and <HI>Living Creatures</HI> move below: Now GOD has made him <HI>Head</HI> over all things for the Church, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 22. He Rules Devils, that they may be re∣strained from Effecting their Malicious designs against the Church; He Sways the Empire over Good Angels, that they may Minister to his chosen Inheritance. Civil Rulers are to act under Christ, and Ultimately to aim at the same design, for which He has received All Power in Hea∣ven and Earth: Their Government must be subordinated, and subservient to his. It is the Wisdom of Kings to fear, serve, and submit to the Son: To carry on Cross designs will incur the guilt of setting themselves, and taking counsel against the LORD, and H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> CHRIST. [<HI>Psal.</HI> 2.]
<PB N="54" REF="001484_0056_0FB355062D3833D0"/>
Hence Rulers must have an Inviolable regard to the Laws of GOD; and Employ all their Power to advance His Kingdom; to guard Religion from the assaults, and open Defiances of the Immoral, and Pro∣phane. They should maintain the just Honours GOD has put upon His Day, His Institutions, and the Stewards of His House. To neglect these designs is to betray them; and to betray them will be resented as Treason and Rebellion against the Majesty of Heaven. And hence the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> is a necessary qualification for those that are called to Rule over Men, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.3. This Fear of GOD is not to be only a Swaying <HI>Motive</HI> to their duty, but this Fear must be made the <HI>Rule</HI> of their Government, as well as Principle that acts them. And when they are pos∣sest of these Divine Principles, and Designs, and accordingly regulate the Exercise of their Power, they are <HI>God-like,</HI> and act as those that Rule for GOD.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>As Gods,</HI> they must set their People <HI>Good Examples.</HI> The Blessed GOD is the Pattern and Standard of all Perfection, in Conformity to whom the Perfection and
<PB N="55" REF="001484_0057_0FB35508336E2340"/>
Glory of Man his Subject does consist: Hence we have these Precepts, <HI>To be Holy</HI> as <HI>He</HI> is <HI>Holy;</HI> to be <HI>Merciful</HI> as GOD is <HI>Merciful;</HI> and to be <HI>Followers,</HI> or Imitators of GOD as dear Children. Herein Rulers must maintain their Cha∣racter, &amp; approve themselves <HI>Gods</HI> among men. They must be Conspicuous Exam∣ples of Piety, Justice, Sobriety; of Zeal for the Glory of GOD, His Day, House and Ordinances. Good Manners must not only be legible in their Laws, but also in their Lives. A Ruler is sometimes cal∣led by GOD a <HI>Seal</HI> or <HI>Signet,</HI> and possibly one reason may be, because what ever is ingraven on them will leave its impression on their People: and therefore Rulers had need take care that they bear the Sig∣nature of undissembled Holiness, that the Impression on those under them may be holy. Superiors by their Example give Lawes to men; Their vertuous Actions may do more to Reform a vicious Age, than all other Methods. The good Lives of such carry Soverignty and Authority in them; they give Life, Light &amp; Heat to Precept; they afford Motive and Incen∣tive
<PB N="56" REF="001484_0058_0FB35510D91829F0"/>
to the Vertuous; but reproach and upbraid the Vicious. Vertue in the Lives of men of Figure and Power appears with peculiar charms, and beauty: There is a lovely, attractive representation of Reli∣gion when it shines in the Conversation of the Great. It now appears with beams of Greatness; and becomes more Visible &amp; Conspicuous, and has a direct tendency to make lasting impressions on others. This will strengthen the Authority of Ru∣lers, and render their Administrations in∣fluential to all good designs. And the Ho∣nour of Government, the design of its In∣stitution can never be secure, unless they thus resemble GOD.</P>
<P>On the other side, the <HI>Evil Examples</HI> of Rulers weaken the hands of Govern∣ment, and spread a deadly Infection, which <HI>wasteth at noon day.</HI> These make Vice reputable, and charming; give au∣thority to it, take off the restraint of fear and shame, and render all Endeavours to suppress it feeble; and so harden the vile in their Evil wayes. The Evil Lives of men of Name and Figure are a Publick In∣vitation to others to follow them; and
<PB N="57" REF="001484_0059_0FB355131749EA00"/>
are as Authentick Pasports to all manner of Iniquity; and a professed Patronage of Vice and Immorality. For as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Obsequij quoddam Genus Regis vitia imitari. La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tan.</NOTE> One of the Fathers observes, Subjects ac∣count it a proper part of their Submission and Deference to Rulers to imitate their Vices: Hence we shall always find among the Israelites that Religion flourished, or languish't according to the Disposition &amp; Practice of their Kings. And it is not to be wondered, if Magistrates are <HI>Rulers of Sodom,</HI> that those under their Conduct be the <HI>People of Gomorrah.</HI> If a Ruler hear∣ken to lies, all his Servants are wicked, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29. 12. Thus if Rulers be vertuous, they are as the Lights of the World, they will direct their People into the paths of Vertue and Glory; but if Vicious, they are like Baleful Comets, that spread Plague and Desolations thro' a Land by their Malignant Influences. <HI>Upon the whole,</HI> we must conclude that such as have the stile of <HI>Gods,</HI> ought, as GOD does, to set their People good Examples: Otherwise they will corrupt the beauty, stain the
<PB N="58" REF="001484_0060_0FB3551622FCD920"/>
Honour, which GOD has put on them; and render themselves unworthy of the Name of <HI>Gods.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have taken a view of what is included and pointed at in the Divine Title, that GOD has Characterized Civil Rulers by; which was the Second thing observed in the Text. We may proceed to the Third.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> That tho' Rulers are <HI>Gods,</HI> yet they are lyable to <HI>Mortality,</HI> and the necessary <HI>Consequents thereof, as Men.</HI> This truth is no Secret, but lyes open to the Observation of all; that to Essay an Ela∣borate Confirmation of it is needless: However, it can't be improper by a few hints to Endeavour to awaken a lively sense hereof, that may affect the heart and life.</P>
<P>The Greatest Men are but <HI>Spirits in Flesh:</HI> They are of the same Make and Constitution with others; That Decree of Heaven, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 27. has the same aspect upon them, as upon the meanest, and may not be disanulled. They are born under the guilt of Sin, and the sentence of Death; and they bring into the World with them
<PB N="59" REF="001484_0061_0FB35517F2006270"/>
the Seeds of Mortality; which will in a little time burst a sunder the bands by which the Soul and Body are held in Vi∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Union. They are obnoxious to the same Diseases, Violences, and Casualties, as Inferiors are; and the least of these are sufficient to stop their breath, and turn them to dust. What Prerogatives they may lay claim to on other accounts; yet here they stand upon a Level. No Exter∣nal Quality, nor Personal Endowment can be any Security from the Arrests of the King of Terrors.</P>
<P>Their Power can't over-awe, nor their Riches bribe Death. Where are all those <HI>Sons of Fame,</HI> the Mighty, Rich and Ho∣nourable, we read of in Story! The Kings, and Princes that filled their houses with Gold and Silver, and the Counsellours of the Earth! Are they not gone to Sleep in those <HI>desolate Places</HI> they built for them∣selves! Are not all the Bright Stars of the Morning cover'd with the dark Cloud of Corruption! Where are those Children of Pride &amp; Oppression, who made the Earth to tremble, shook Kingdoms, made the World as a Wilderness, and destroyed
<PB N="60" REF="001484_0062_0FB3551C593D3268"/>
the Cities thereof! How are they fallen, their pomp brought down to the Grave, and become as weak as the meanest of their Vassals! The Worm is spread under them, and the Worm covers them. Again, Wisdom and Policy cannot protect them from Mortality; for the Wise dy as well as the Fool. Courage will not; for Death cannot be Conquered but by that <HI>Prince of Life,</HI> who has triumphed over Death, and is the <HI>Life</HI> &amp; the <HI>Resurrection:</HI> So that after all their breath must go forth, and they return to Corruption.</P>
<P>As they are lyable to Death, so <HI>as Men</HI> they are lyable to the Consequents of Mortality. Their Bodies will undergo the same Mortifying Changes and Cor∣ruption in the <HI>Land of Darkness,</HI> which the Bodies of others undergo. <HI>As Men,</HI> their Spirits when seperated from their Bodies, will not drop into a State of in∣activity, insensibility; nor shall be arrested with a Mortal Lethargy; but their Seperate Souls, will pass into the Unseen World of Unbodyed Spirits, and be subject to the Laws &amp; Government, to the Work and Rewards of <HI>that World:</HI> They will during
<PB N="61" REF="001484_0063_0FB3551D447F4E60"/>
that State of Separation be either United to the Society of <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>happy Souls,</HI> or be herded with the <HI>degraded Angels,</HI> and <HI>unhappy Spirits</HI> of dead men: they will, during this State of Death, either tremble at the fore-sight of their re-union to their Ancient Bodies; or wait and long in this State of Expectancy for the Re∣demption of their Bodies. <HI>As Men,</HI> they are <HI>Accountable,</HI> as well as <HI>Mortal;</HI> and must appear before the Tribunal of GOD, who <HI>Respecteth not the Persons of Princes:</HI> A State either of Immortal bless, or mise∣ry Expects them after Death: So that <HI>as Men</HI> they are to dye, and have something to fear, or hope for, beyond the Grave.</P>
<P>Thus Death and the inevitable Conse∣quents of it, have an equal Aspect upon Rulers and Ruled. And what a terrible Rebuke is this to the present Pride and Grandeur of <HI>Gods</HI> on Earth? And what happy Influence might the just Contem∣plation hereof have to implant &amp; nourish those Seeds of Vertue, which may give them a blessed Prospect of more Substan∣tial, Weighty &amp; Enduring Glories in that State, where there shall be no more Death!
<PB N="62" REF="001484_0064_0FB3551ED8355788"/>
And this naturally leads us to the Fourth and last thing observed in our Text.</P>
<P><HI>IV.</HI> That it will be of great Advan∣tage to <HI>Temper &amp; Qualify</HI> the thoughts of their <HI>Dignity,</HI> with just <HI>Reflections</HI> on their Expected <HI>Mortality,</HI> and its Conse∣quents.</P>
<P>Now the Advantage of these Reflecti∣ons may be Considered both as to <HI>Rulers</HI> and <HI>Ruled.</HI></P>
<P>I. It may be of great <HI>Advantage</HI> to <HI>Ru∣lers;</HI> To <HI>Temper</HI> the thoughts of their <HI>Dignity</HI> with just Reflections on their <HI>Mortality,</HI> and its Consequents. I shall mention here three Important Points.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>These Reflections</HI> will teach Rulers not to <HI>over-rate and value</HI> their present Advantages of Honour, and Power over Men. It is of the last Consequence to them that they do not Place too great a Price upon their present Circumstances of Superiority: Now these thoughts will read them wise Lessons of the Vanity of these things; and bring them under a full Conviction of the truth of the Psal∣mists Conclusion: <HI>Psal.</HI> 39 5. <HI>Surely every
<PB N="63" REF="001484_0065_0FB3552240FA0000"/>
Man at his best Estate is altogether Vanity.</HI> That can't be very valuable to Immortal Beings, which is not <HI>durable;</HI> but in a lit∣tle time will be lost. And this is the case of the present Advantages which men En∣joy above others. <HI>Death</HI> causes all titles of Honour to burst into Air and nothing as Empty bubbles. It disarms the Great of all their Power, and they go naked in∣to the other World. After all their Pomp and Parade on the stage of Life, they drop into their Graves, and nothing of all their <HI>Glory descends after them. Death</HI> wrests the Sceptre out of the Monarchs hand, plucks the Crown from off his head, and turns his Glory into noisome Putrefaction: and the very fore-thought of it will stain the Pride of all their Glory. Hence <HI>Right Reflections</HI> on their <HI>Mortality</HI> will suggest to such as Sit at the upper End of the World, wiser thoughts of their present State of Exaltation; and will teach them that there can be no <HI>true Greatness,</HI> but what is found in Conjunction with <HI>Immortaliz∣ing Goodness;</HI> and that without this inhe∣rent Greatness of Soul, their external ad∣vantages of Honour, Power, and Superio∣rity
<PB N="64" REF="001484_0066_0FB355235FB8E538"/>
will signify nothing; unless when a∣bused, &amp; prided in, to make their Account more terrible; and their Infamy and Shame more deep and insufferable, when they shall be fixed in the Congregation of GOD's conquered Enemies.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>These Thoughts</HI> will be a Powerful <HI>Antidote</HI> against the <HI>Infection</HI> of those <HI>Temptations,</HI> that threaten them in their Exalted Stations. Rulers have the same Lusts within them, as other men; and are beset with much stronger Temptations to provoke and inflame these Lusts. Sa∣tan will be most busy with such to corrupt and pervert them; and their falls will give the Wrath and Malice of Hell a distin∣guishing Triumph. The World with its highest charms, and greatest advantage to bewitch them: And as they have greater advantages than <HI>Others</HI> to pursue the most guilty gratifications; so they have fewer restraints, and less of obstruction in their way. They have enough to shock and try the most Established vertue. How ma∣ny wayes are they tempted! And in dan∣ger of sullying their Divine Character, by being lead to Pride and Vanity, Sloth and

Luxury, Covetousness and Oppression. They need to keep the strictest guard, and lay the severest restraints upon themselves, to secure them from their Spiritual dan∣gers.</P>
<P>Now just <HI>Reflections</HI> on <HI>Death</HI> and its <HI>Consequents</HI> will awaken in them such thoughts, as will tend to check, and rein in those lusts, that the charms of Great∣ness do excite. If they remember they must dye, how can they grow giddy, or be unreasonably transported with the glit∣tering Images of their present honours? Will not this thought damp the force of Temptations to Luxury and Sensuality; and cool them in the hot pursuit of forbid∣den pleasures? What Appetite had <HI>Bel∣shazzar,</HI> when he saw and understood <HI>the hand writing on the Wall,</HI> to carry on the Revel, and compleat the debauch? This prospect will pall the unhallowed Appe∣tite of Dominion, and Gain; and will make them think what agonies and cor∣vulsions the remembrance of gain gotten by Injustice and Oppression, will cause in a dying hour; and what inflaming Items, the charge of Power, Riches, and Honour
<PB N="66" REF="001484_0068_0FB355263336A438"/>
abused, and perverted, will be at that Impartial Tribunal they must stand before. Thus these <HI>Reflections</HI> will be of mighty force to abate the Edge of Temptation; and they will give them a juster view of things, as they stand in the <HI>Light</HI> of the other World: Instructing them, that if they must dye, and be judg∣ed like men, then they may not live like <HI>Creatures,</HI> either of <HI>Prey</HI> or <HI>Pleasure.</HI> And were these thoughts more frequently En∣tertained and Realized by the Superior part of the World, what a mighty pro∣tection would they be from those threat∣ning Evils, which if indulged, will debase their Character, cloud their Serenity of Conscience, and lay their Souls <HI>waste</HI> and <HI>desolate.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) These <HI>Thoughts</HI> of <HI>Mortality</HI> and its Consequents will be most forcible <HI>Ar∣guments</HI> and <HI>Motives</HI> to engage Rulers so to improve the Advantages of Honour and Power, as may give them the best prospect of a State of Immortality. Au∣thority, Riches and Power are great Ad∣vantages for Service, &amp; infer the strongest Obligations hereto, to honour GOD, and
<PB N="67" REF="001484_0069_0FB3552B6B2C0C38"/>
do good to the World. Those of the highest Order in Government are but GOD's Stewards; their Power, Honour and Influence are Talents committed to them to <HI>Occupy,</HI> for their <HI>Great LORD,</HI> till HE come, when they must account for their improvement: They have not the <HI>Domi∣nion</HI> but only the <HI>Dispensation</HI> of these, as their <HI>Masters Goods.</HI> And these well im∣proved will give them a joyous prospect into the Eternal World; and will secure to them an <HI>Euge</HI> from their Lord and Judge. Now these Reflections on Death and its Consequents tend to engage them to a <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> improvement of these Talents committed to them: They will incite them to study such a Management in their Places, as shall in the Review not Torment but Comfort them, when the Shadows of Death stretch over them. This Prospect will make them value their state of Distinction and Superiority, not by its present glittering Appearance, but by their greater Capacity for Service for GOD, his Kingdom and People. This will constrain them to think, what good they have Opportunity to do, that they
<PB N="68" REF="001484_0070_0FB3552E75C57120"/>
may not neglect it; but get it done before Death periods their Seasons of Improve∣ment: It will inspire them with the most noble purposes; that they may fill up their Places, and be <HI>Gods</HI> to the World while they live. In this way their Death∣beds will be Places of Inconceiveable re∣freshment; and have confidence in their Appearance before the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>Man:</HI> Their fidelity will fill all their Powers with the warmest Transports of joy in that Terrible day of the Lord: while at the same time the Kings of the Earth, the Great Men, the Rich, and Mighty Men, that have a∣bused and not improved their Talents, shall stand <HI>Trembling</HI> before the Supream bar of CHRIST, over-powred with the Terrors of the LORD, from whose Wrath <HI>Rocks</HI> &amp; <HI>Mountains</HI> can give no Protection. Oh! that they were thus Wise, that they understood this, that they would now consider their latter End!</P>
<P N="2">2. These <HI>Reflections</HI> may be of Service and Advantage to <HI>Such</HI> as are <HI>under Go∣vernment.</HI> And there are Two <HI>Lessons</HI> of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> which the Prospect of Rulers Mortality will teach a People, more espe∣cially. As,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="69" REF="001484_0071_0FB3553002918050"/>
(1.) These <HI>Reflections</HI> on their <HI>Morta∣lity</HI> will teach a People to make all <HI>favou∣rable Allowances</HI> for the <HI>Infirmities,</HI> and <HI>Defects</HI> of their <HI>Rulers.</HI> And were this lesson well learnt by a People it would be of no common advantage to them.</P>
<P>And are they <HI>Gods</HI> that must <HI>dye,</HI> surely then we are not to Expect from them that perfection of Wisdom and Vertue in their Conduct, as if they were <HI>Immortal</HI> GOD's; Nor that freedom from Error and Misma∣nagement as if they were <HI>Angels</HI> whose <HI>dwellings are not in flesh,</HI> those Sons of GOD, who are the Excellency of Divine Dignity, and the Excellency of Power, who always stand in the Presence of GOD, and in his <HI>Light</HI> see <HI>Light:</HI> nor yet as if they were <HI>Unbody'd Spirits,</HI> who have left their Moral Infirmities with their Mortal Bodies here below. A State of Mortality bespeaks a State of Sin, and Moral Infir∣mity: for Death is the punishment of Sin; and were all the Seeds of Sin purged out, Death would have no power over them. If then they must dy as other men; they have the same principles of <HI>Moral</HI> as well as <HI>Natural Corruption</HI> in them, as other
<PB N="70" REF="001484_0072_0FB35531C708F2F8"/>
men, no wonder then we many times see these sprout forth in their present State of Mortality, and obscure the Glory of their Conduct. It is not to be Expected that they should move in their Sphere with that vigour, activity and regularity, as if they had put on Immortality, and their Bodies were Endow'd with that Purity, Power and Spirituality, which is to be Ex∣pected in the <HI>Resurrection State.</HI> It is no wonder they are no more vigilant, steady and diligent in their work, since they are not <HI>Pure Spirits,</HI> nor <HI>Raised Saints,</HI> but are clogged with Bodies, endowed with Animal Appetites, Inclinations, &amp; Wants, which are essential to their State of Mor∣tality.</P>
<P><HI>These Thoughts</HI> should dispose us to cover the Infirmities of Rulers with a veil of <HI>Charity,</HI> and not like <HI>Cham</HI> discover their Nakedness: they will suggest that we must not rudely comment and criticise upon their Errors; but make all the favour∣able Allowances for the Imperfections, &amp; the force of Temptations, that they are lyable to in their present state; and not blaspheme their Character, should they not
<PB N="71" REF="001484_0073_0FB35532F6725EA8"/>
in every Article be proof against them: For then they must be <HI>more</HI> than <HI>Men,</HI> that must <HI>dye.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>These Thoughts</HI> will teach those under Government, not to place undue <HI>Confidences</HI> in the best Rulers. We must not have that dependence on them, or ex∣pectations from them, which are due on∣ly to the Eternal, and Immutable GOD. What is man, whose breath is in his Nostrils! Man who must dye, to be ac∣counted of! Men of highest degree are not to be trusted to, for their Mortality tells us they are but a <HI>Lye.</HI> GOD Himself has given us that Admonition, <HI>Psal.</HI> 146. 3, 4. <HI>Put not your trust in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help; his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth, in that very day his thoughts perish.</HI> Let them be never so excelling in Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, never so full of good and great designs, yet Death comes, and puts an End to all; and then they can afford no help: when Death comes they can no longer cover us with their Shadow; no longer be Eyes to the blind, Feet to the lame, or Fathers to the Widow and Fatherless; for
<PB N="72" REF="001484_0074_0FB3553475402038"/>
they are become <HI>weak as other men.</HI> This Consideration should make us renounce all undue Confidences in those Rulers, that best deserve the Character of <HI>Gods;</HI> lest we place them in the Place of that GOD, who can never Change or Dye: And happy only are such, as have the Im∣moveable <HI>Munition of Rocks</HI> for the place of their Defence; and have the <HI>Eternal GOD</HI> for their Refuge.</P>
<P>APPLICATION.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> This teaches us the vast <HI>Diffi∣culty</HI> of the Rulers Province. The most only fix their Eyes on their outward Splendors and Honours, and dream of no∣thing but Ease and Pleasure, Grandeur in all its gay shews; but never think of that Duty, Work and Business of Government, which is attended with Difficulties as <HI>Great</HI> as their Dignity. Their Station is high, and no common supplies of Grace are necessary for the discharge of the Duties that belong to their Sphere. They are to act for GOD, in his <HI>Name,</HI> and so to <HI>Represent</HI> him as all that observe them may have more
<PB N="73" REF="001484_0075_0FB3553818CEFB90"/>
Worthy &amp; Honourable thoughts of GOD, and his Government; and <HI>who is sufficient for this!</HI> Especially if it be considered how many things there are to weaken their hands, and render the burden of Go∣vernment more insupportable. There are their own Infirmities, and the ill Humours of their People; Murmurings, Jealousies, Reproaches, and Discontents: These made <HI>Moses</HI> openly Protest before <HI>Israel</HI> that he was not not able to bear their <HI>Cum∣brance,</HI> their <HI>Burden,</HI> and <HI>Strife. Deut.</HI> 1. 12. Sometimes a People are so out of frame that nothing, which is right can please them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and how difficult is the Rulers Province, when there is reason to say, as one among the Heathen of old, when he refused the place of a Magistrate, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That if he <HI>Ruled ill</HI> he should offend the <HI>Gods;</HI> but if <HI>well</HI> the <HI>People.</HI> Under the best Circumstances their Station is attend∣ed with uncommon Temptations from within, and without; that Faithfully to dis∣charge the Duties thereof requires great degrees of Self-denyal, Patience, Humili∣ty; that they may act above the Corrupt influences of present Hopes and Fears;
<PB N="74" REF="001484_0076_0FB3553E2EA3CDD8"/>
and under all act like GOD; as those that bear his Image, &amp; approve themselves to be <HI>Gods</HI> to the world; and go on steady in that way maugre all Opposition. <HI>Hic Labor, hoc Opus est</HI> Under a just view of the Importance, Weight and Dif∣ficulty of this work of Government, it may not be wondred at, if <HI>the Olive-tree</HI> refuses to leave her <HI>Fatness;</HI> and the <HI>Fig-tree</HI> her <HI>Sweetness,</HI> to Rule over the Trees of the Wood. Who would choose to quit their own sweet Tranquility, and Ease for the restless Cares, and uneasy Fatigues of Government? Rulers may well be tempted to say, as <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 7. I will not be an <HI>Healer</HI> to this People; or as <HI>Moses,</HI> Send, O Lord, <HI>I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send, Exod.</HI> 4. 13. Their Station is so full of Duties and Difficulties, that Rulers are the proper Objects of our Prayers and Pity, and not our Envy.</P>
<P><HI>USE II.</HI> Are Rulers <HI>Gods,</HI> then they must take care not to live below the <HI>Dig∣nity of Men.</HI> It will be an indelible Reproach on those that wear the Character of <HI>Gods,</HI> to degrade themselves to the state of
<PB N="75" REF="001484_0077_0FB3553F6EC41778"/>
Beasts. And yet how patiently is this degradation undergone by many! Gods must not give a loose to their Lusts; gra∣tify their Criminal Appetites, and Incli∣nations; Luxury, Drunkenness and Wan∣tonness must not be indulged, for these are Brutish, and transform them into Beasts. And hence they must be avoided by Ru∣lers; Gods by <HI>Office</HI> may not be less than Men. And when Luxury and Drunken∣ness are growing among a People; it would be well if Rulers would avoid, all approaches to it, and the least appearances of it. It was a wholesome Admonition that <HI>Lemuels</HI> Mother gave him, <HI>Prov.</HI> 31.4,5. It is not for Kings, O <HI>Lemuel,</HI> to drink Wine; nor for Princes Strong Drink; lest they drink and forget the Law, and pervert Judgment. When Rulers are made Sick with Bottles of Wine; they will stretch out the hands with Scorners;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hos. 7.5.</NOTE> and it bodes ill to a Land.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 10. 16, 17.</NOTE> But <HI>Happy</HI> is that LAND, whose Rulers Eat and Drink in <HI>Season,</HI> for <HI>Strength,</HI> and not for <HI>Drunkenness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE III.</HI> This tells us it is an aw∣ful Judgment upon a People, when they
<PB N="76" REF="001484_0078_0FB355407352C370"/>
want such, as are fit to Support the <HI>Cha∣racter and Dignity of Gods;</HI> or when those that are best Qualify'd are thro' Prejudice lay'd aside. This is too often the melan∣choly State of a People. Sometimes tho' strict search be made for men to make up the <HI>Hedge</HI> round a People, and to stand in the <HI>Gap,</HI> none can be found: They have no <HI>strong Rods for a Sceptre to Rule them,</HI> Sometimes those that are best qualify'd by inward Ability's, and outward Circum∣stances, are thro' a <HI>spirit of Prejudice</HI> and <HI>Partiality</HI> overlookt; and Voted unfit to Serve a People. The Rule of Elections many times is not, <HI>Merit,</HI> Capacity, and Integrity, but some other Considerations, that rather argue Persons unfit than qua∣lify'd for Service. Such, as have too much the Command of the Publick Voice, will have <HI>this Man</HI> prefer'd because he is of the <HI>Right Party,</HI> as they call it, will Es∣pouse this or the other Interest, and op∣pose <HI>some others in Place,</HI> who right or wrong must be Opposed: such an one is Voted of the <HI>right stamp;</HI> and is wonder∣fully accomplished for Rule, tho' wholly destitute of Wisdom, Probity, and a true
<PB N="77" REF="001484_0079_0FB3554885ACF8F0"/>
Genius for Government. On the other side, <HI>This</HI> &amp; <HI>That</HI> Man must be lay'd aside as Unqualify'd, only because either his Brains were not cast in the same Mould, and has not just the same set of Thoughts with some others, who would fain set up for the first <HI>Ministers of State,</HI> and <HI>Masters of Policy:</HI> these despair to carry on their own Private, Dark Designs by them; they can't make them their <HI>Tools,</HI> speak thro' them, and act by them. And by this means it comes to pass the most Worthy are rejected, and not improved; while the Un∣worthy, the Weak, the Halt and Blind are exalted; who are more fit to resemble the <HI>Dumb, Deaf, and Blind Idols</HI> of the Hea∣then, which are Empty within, and are fit only to fill up an Empty space; tho' Adored by the People, yet are uncapable of be∣ing <HI>Gods</HI> to them; than to resemble the <HI>Li∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing JEHOVAH.</HI> These can never assert the <HI>Honour</HI> of their Place, answer the <HI>End</HI> of the Ordination of <HI>Rule</HI> over men: and a People under the Management of such, must without a miracle, be mean and des∣picable; the very <HI>Tail</HI> among the Nati∣ons round about. When therefore this
<PB N="78" REF="001484_0080_0FB3554B97443CE0"/>
is the case of a Land, it calls for the deepest Lamentation. The Disease of such a Peo∣ple is next to Incurable.</P>
<P><HI>USE IV.</HI> Hence, It it is a great <HI>Bles∣sing</HI> to Enjoy Rulers that in a good mea∣sure do maintain the Dignity, &amp; discharge the Duties, which become their Character; and a People thus Priviledged ought to be Thankful to GOD. Good Rulers are the most <HI>lively Emblems</HI> of GOD on Earth: They are the BREATH <HI>of a Peoples Nostrils;</HI> the whole Common Wealth is as it were Breathing in them; and they as necessary to the <HI>Life</HI> and Well-being of the State; as Breath for the Continuance of Natural Life. These are as <HI>David</HI> the <HI>Light of Is∣rael,</HI> which cannot be quenched without bringing Darkness upon a whole Land: Such are the <HI>Glory of a Land;</HI> It is because GOD loves a People, that he sets such in Authority over them. The Spirit of GOD has given us the most Lively Representa∣tion of such Rulers, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 4. <HI>He shall be as the Light of the Morning, when the Sun riseth; even a Morning without Clouds; as the tender Grass springing out of the
<PB N="79" REF="001484_0081_0FB3554E1F71FCE0"/>
Earth, by clear Shining after Rain.</HI> These are the Glory of Humane Race: and the Ear that hears them, shall bless them; and the Eye that sees them, shall bear a Testi∣mony to them. <HI>When the Righteous are Exalted the City Rejoyceth, Prov.</HI> 11.10.</P>
<P>What Reason then have the <HI>British Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Dominions</HI> to Triumph in the Divine Favour! That GOD has Ex∣alted to the <HI>Throne</HI> a QUEEN, who is the Refuge of the Distressed both at <HI>HOME</HI> and <HI>Abroad;</HI> the Powerful <HI>Assertor</HI> not only of the Liberties Civil and Sacred of Her own People, but also of the Common <HI>Rights</HI> of Mankind in generous Compassi∣on to Oppressed Neighbours; under whose <HI>Shadow</HI> our Nations at <HI>Home</HI> securely Sit, and Enjoy their most Valuable Blessings; and we in these <HI>Distant Provinces</HI> most sensibly Feel, and are Cherish'd with the Benign Influences of Her Light, Favour and Conduct. The Glory of Her Reign has been indeed Shaded by the Dark Lines of a Bloody War, Engaged in not from <HI>Choice,</HI> but <HI>Necessity</HI> both of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> yet has been to a Miracle Brighten'd with the Smiles of Heaven, in a Series of
<PB N="80" REF="001484_0082_0FB3554F9FDA8698"/>
Victories, and Triumphs, as will be scarce Credible to Posterity. Let Her Greatness, and Glory Encrease; Let the <HI>Secrecy</HI> of the <HI>Divine Presence</HI> be always Her Pavi∣lion; Let Her Person, and Government be Preserved by Tutelar Angels from <HI>Dark Practices,</HI> and <HI>Open Violences;</HI> Let the Crown long Flourish on Her Sacred Head, to the Terror of Her Enemies; and to the Security, Joy, and Triumph of all the Friends of <HI>Zion;</HI> And be late Translated to that Throne above that will not Totter, and that Crown that shall never Fade away.</P>
<P>May I not add without suspicion of Flat∣tery? that the <HI>present Government</HI> which is immediately over us in this <HI>Province,</HI> ought to be esteem'd as a Favour of Hea∣ven, which challenges a Tribute of Grati∣tude, and Praise? Is it not a great Favour to a People to have such in <HI>Rule</HI> over them, as they have reason to believe, notwith∣standing all their Infirmities, mainly to de∣sire, aim at, and endeavour the Publick Good; and to approve themselves God's to them? Is it not a Rich Blessing that we do not see men of infamous Lusts, whose Lives are the last Defiance to all that
<PB N="81" REF="001484_0083_0FB35553601A98F0"/>
is Sacred, and Divine, to Religion, Com∣mon Honesty and Sobriety, openly wallowing in the grossest Pollutions of Sensuality: Is it not a Valuable Blessing, that we do not see such Madness and Folly set in great Dignity over us, which would make Vice Reputable? Is it not a Privi∣ledge, that our <HI>Zion</HI> has some of her <HI>own Sons</HI> to take her by the Hand, who cannot but have a peculiar Tenderness for her? And of such we see this Day the first <HI>Chair</HI> of <HI>Government,</HI> the <HI>Council Table,</HI> and the <HI>Seats</HI> of <HI>Judgment</HI> filled: May GOD long continue the Blessing. And if any, either thro' Stupidity, or Malignity, will not see, or not acknowledge the Smiles of Divine Providence on these accounts; I wish they be never made to feel by doleful Experi∣ence, the vast Difference of being Protected and Refresh'd under the <HI>Shadow</HI> of the spreading <HI>Vine,</HI> and being Scratcht and Torn by the <HI>Bramble.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE V.</HI> This teaches us the <HI>Duty of a People</HI> to their <HI>Rulers;</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> To treat them according to the <HI>Dignity</HI> of that Character and Title, that GOD has dignify'd them with.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="001484_0084_0FB35554DF2B1488"/>
A Tribute of Honour, Reverence, and Dutiful Regards is their undoubted due from their People. Regard them as GOD's <HI>Deligates,</HI> and <HI>Viceroys;</HI> as Arm'd with his Power, and Engag'd in his Service for your Good; as <HI>Living Images</HI> of the Immortal KING of Glory. Honour them for GOD Himself has put Honour upon them. Do all you can properly to Support their Dig∣nity, and Maintain their Character: For it can never go well with a People, when Government is brought into Contempt. <HI>Government</HI> has something too <HI>Divine</HI> in it to be insulted, and rudely treated. You can't despise their Authority, but you must despise GOD himself; and spit on his I∣mage; which He will certainly resent. And it becomes a <HI>People</HI> to remember that they are <HI>Mortal,</HI> and <HI>Accountable</HI> as well as their Rulers. Let your regards therefore to Ru∣lers be answerable to that Condition GOD has placed them in; and as may a∣gree with those Beams of Divinity, with which they shine. Do all that you may to Encourage them in their Work which is Difficult &amp; most Important. Own GOD's <HI>Name, Image,</HI> and <HI>Superscription,</HI> that they
<PB N="83" REF="001484_0085_0FB35557DB836D30"/>
bear, and do nothing to Deface them.</P>
<P><HI>Hence,</HI> All Murmurings, Discontents, Evil Surmisings and Jealousies, all Seeds of Faction &amp; Sedition must be suppressed with the greatest care among a People. If Rulers are <HI>Gods,</HI> they are not to be Reviled, Blasphemed, Arraigned and Condemned by every Haughty, Insolent, and Discontented Spirit. To be <HI>Murmurers,</HI> and to <HI>speak E∣vil of Dignities,</HI> are Evils of a black Cha∣racter in the Word of GOD; and may not be Play'd with. And yet how common are these Evils! And how many Corrupt Principles are too frequently found among a People, which lead to these! Some are prompted to foment Jealousies of Rulers, that they may be <HI>Popular,</HI> or that they may be thought Persons of a <HI>deeper Reach,</HI> and <HI>quicker Sight</HI> than others; and therefore pretend to see evil Designs at the bottom of Publick Administrations, that their <HI>Blind</HI> Neighbours are not aware of. Sometimes they deny Government it's just Honours, because, they imagine, they are not regard∣ed, as their Merit calls for: Some are so <HI>full</HI> of themselves, and so giddy with the Contemplation of their own supposed Ex∣cellencies,
<PB N="84" REF="001484_0086_0FB355594A65C228"/>
that they think they have a <HI>Right</HI> to impose their <HI>Schemes</HI> as Perfect <HI>Models of Prudence,</HI> and that their Phansy's ought to be Entertain'd as infallible Ora∣cles, and that it will never be well with <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Church</HI> till it be so. Their acti∣ons declare their sense that they are the <HI>Men,</HI> and that <HI>Wisdom</HI> will <HI>Dye</HI> with them; and that with their <HI>Bolt too soon shot,</HI> they can out-shoot all about them. Hence if their Thoughts are not Enter∣tained with a deep Silence, profound Re∣verence, and be not made the <HI>Publick Rule;</HI> they Vote themselves Despised, and Af∣fronted, &amp; the Publick Betray'd &amp; Ruined. And hence arise Discontents, Jealousies, &amp; hard Censuring of Rulers: Hence the Er∣rors of Government are needlesly Exposed, and unkindly Descanted on, and often∣times Errors only supposed are Bruited a∣bout as real and certain: Nay their Lau∣dable actions insideously represented to their disadvantage. Thus the <HI>Gods</HI> are too often Reviled, and evilly Entreated. <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> these things ought not to be so: Our Religion will not allow it. GOD was angry with <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Miriam,</HI> tho'
<PB N="85" REF="001484_0087_0FB3555C348D04A8"/>
Persons of <HI>Character</HI> themselves, for speak∣ing against his <HI>Servant Moses.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> If Rulers are <HI>Gods,</HI> then their Character demands <HI>Submission</HI> and <HI>Obedi∣ence</HI> from a People. The Dignity and Authority of their Station calls for it; and both Law and Gospel require it as their due. Rebellion and Disobedience against GOD's Vice-gerents in the Lawful Execu∣tion of their Office is Rebellion against GOD himself in the last result. And a∣greeably we are to be Obedient to Civil Government, not only for <HI>Wrath</HI> but for <HI>Conscience</HI> sake.</P>
<P>I am not Ignorant to what an extrava∣gant heighth the <HI>Doctrine of Submission to Rulers</HI> has been carry'd by some; and I wish I could see no danger of the Con∣trary <HI>Extream</HI> of depressing it to a meer Nullity. Extreams on both hands are to be avoided; for both are dangerous to a <HI>State.</HI> The <HI>One</HI> may Expose a People to the <HI>Op∣pressions</HI> of Sullen <HI>Tyranny;</HI> the <HI>Other</HI> to the <HI>Confusions</HI> of Lawless <HI>Anarchy:</HI> The <HI>One</HI> Sub∣jects a State to the rigorous <HI>Impositions</HI> of a <HI>Despotick Power,</HI> Paramount to all Law, Rea∣son and Conscience, the <HI>Other</HI> lays it open
<PB N="86" REF="001484_0088_0FB3555E1B4310A0"/>
to the <HI>Wild Humors</HI> of an <HI>Ungovern'd Mul∣titude;</HI> to the Fury, Madness and Noise of the People.</P>
<P>Doubtless GOD has not left a State without a <HI>Regular Remedy</HI> to Save it self, when the Fundamental Constitu∣tion of a People is Overturned; their Laws and Liberties, Religion and Properties are openly Invaded, and ready to be made a Publick Sacrifice. But on the other side, it is beyond me to imagine that the <HI>GOD of Or∣der</HI> has ever invested any men of a Private Station, who can with a Nodd inflame and raise the Multitude, with a Lawful Power, on pretence of Publick Mismanage∣ments, to Embroyl the State, and Over∣turn the Foundations of Government.</P>
<P>I am neither <HI>Afraid,</HI> nor <HI>Asham'd</HI> to say, I should be glad to see the <HI>Doctrine of Submission</HI> to Rulers, in it's <HI>Just</HI> and Un∣doubted <HI>Measures,</HI> better Stated and Qua∣lify'd on all sides, than ever yet I have seen it: and when ever that shall be done, sure I am, that these following Admonitions, and Precepts will not be found Apocry∣phal, but Apostolical and Divine; <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 1, 2. <HI>Let every Soul be subject to the Higher

<HI>USE VI.</HI> Our Text gives <HI>Divine Coun∣sel</HI> to such as have the <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Nominating</HI> &amp; <HI>Electing</HI> Persons to Place of <HI>Rule</HI> over men. And the Advice is that there be a due regard had to such as are best Qualify'd to <HI>Support</HI> the Character of <HI>Gods,</HI> and to <HI>Resemble</HI> the Blessed GOD in their Administrations. This Rule is to be observed in Communicating Power of any kind or degree, and in what ever way it is derived to others. Commissions of <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>War</HI> are not to be given of Course, or made matters of pure Complement; but an Eye is to be had to the Qualifications of men to be Authorized; that they be such as will improve aright the Power commit∣ted to them; and be <HI>as Gods</HI> in their Stati∣on.</P>
<P>But I shall only Consider this Rule as it may be Serviceable to direct the <HI>Elections</HI> of <HI>this Day.</HI> The Liberty and Priviledge of the present <HI>Election</HI> is very great, if right∣ly used; and I Pray GOD we may never be Taught the Value of it, by its Loss.</P>
<P>Let those that are immediately concern'd in the Electing Persons <HI>this Day</HI> to be of

Her MAJESTY'S <HI>Council</HI> in this <HI>Province</HI> to consider the Character that has been o∣pen'd before them. You are, Honourable Gentlemen, highly Intrusted by GOD with a great Opportunity to Serve <HI>HIM,</HI> your <HI>QUEEN</HI> and <HI>Countrey;</HI> You are un∣der the accurate Observation of GOD, and this People, how you use your present Power; and it is well worthy your tho't, that it is a Talent you must account for, when you become Instances of Mortality. Here is a safe Rule before you, by which you may proceed with Honour &amp; Safety. And the Rule is, that your <HI>Voices</HI> be given to such, as shall be most fit to Assert their Dignity, Support their Character, &amp; Pro∣mote the End of Government, the Good of the People: To such, as are of the best Port, Influence, Life and Activity, Cou∣rage and Resolution, Knowledge and Justice, and of known Piety to GOD, and approved Loyalty to the QUEEN. For these will be most fit to act the part assign'd them to the Honour of Government, and the Publick Good. <HI>Elections</HI> must not be made by Personal Favour. None must be Chosen, nor Overlook<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, barely be∣cause

cause they are Friends to <HI>these,</HI> or Enemies to <HI>those.</HI> Be not led in your Choice by se∣cret suggestions in a Corner, where one man may be <HI>Canonized,</HI> and a better <HI>Reprobated:</HI> But be governed by the <HI>Known Characters</HI> of men, that are generally approved of. This was the ancient Rule,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Take men known a∣mong your Tribes.</HI> Take men, not of Li∣cence, but of indisputable Vertue; who seem to Live in all their Relations under a realizing View of Death and the Eternal Judgment: Men who best understand the Religious and Civil Interests of their Peo∣ple; who are Governed not by Narrow &amp; Selfish Principles, but by a Publick Gene∣rous Spirit; who know how to deserve the Publick Applause, and how to despise it, and can be content to bear the ill Will of a People, if they may but do them Good. In a word, they must be men sensible of the Sufferings, Mourning over the Degenera∣cies of this People, and their Flesh &amp; Heart trembling at the Tokens of Divine Wrath upon them. These will be best Qualify'd for the <HI>Dignity,</HI> and Faithful to the <HI>Duty</HI> of Government: Most likely to be Images
<PB N="91" REF="001484_0093_0FB3556B978AB008"/>
of GOD, whose Name is imprinted on them. These GOD will approve of; will be an Honour to their Place, and a Glory to the Land. It this Rule be observed, we shall this Day have an happy Presage that GOD has not withdrawn his Presence nor Glory from us.</P>
<P><HI>USE VII.</HI> The Consideration of our Text will suggest <HI>Divine Counsel</HI> to all Or∣ders and Degrees of Men in Government, by which to <HI>Regulate their Conduct in their Publick Capacity.</HI> Since the <HI>Great</HI> LORD of the World has Honoured you with his Stile, Name and some Rayes of his Power, by all the Rules of Equity, Decency &amp; Honour, you are obliged to Act up to the Dignity of your Character, Form your selves in your Administrations after the Example of the Divine <HI>Rule,</HI> and so approve your selves <HI>Gods.</HI> Your Countrey has a just Claim to all that Care, Tenderness Protection, and Comfort, which may render them Safe under your Wings, and you truly Venera∣ble in their Eyes. Your Title calls for a Superiority in all that is Good and Ver∣tuous, in proportion to your Superiority
<PB N="92" REF="001484_0094_0FB3556CD7828A18"/>
in Name and Power; and it is vain for any to expect to Maintain the Honour of their State of Exaltation, without that Real Ma∣jesty, and Excellency displayed in their Managements, which will command the Reverence, Love and Esteem of all about them. GOD, who has to an observable degree Cloathed you with his own Honour, expects that on no terms you Betray it, but Assert it, by a GOD-like Discharge of that great Trust committed to you. The admonition given to <HI>Titus,</HI> a Ruler in the Church of GOD; is with equal Force ap∣plicable to Rulers in the State, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2. 15. <HI>Let no man Despise thee.</HI> Thus if you will answer your Character, you must let no man Despise you: <HI>i. e.</HI> Do nothing that shall deserve Contempt, that shall slur your Names, and prostitute your Honour; no∣thing that shall weaken your Authority, destroy that Reverence that is due to the Dignity of your Place, or that may make others Entertain Mean and Despicable thoughts of you. For otherwise you will invite Floods of Contempt, and Open In∣dignities, which will be to GOD's Disho∣nour as well as yours. But on the Con∣trary,
<PB N="93" REF="001484_0095_0FB3556FC60C85E0"/>
let those Divine Vertues shine in your Conduct, that shall render your Persons Venerable and Amiable, Command Reve∣rence and Awe, and make the Glory of your Name appear with untarnished Lu∣stre. <HI>This is the Counsel of Heaven.</HI> And to render it more influential, it may be more Particularly directed,</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> In <HI>the first Place,</HI> Let this Counsel of Heaven be Addressed with all <HI>Dutiful Submission</HI> to YOUR EXCELLENCY, whom GOD, and our Gracious QUEEN, has Seated at the <HI>Head</HI> of our <HI>Gods,</HI> in the first Chair of Dignity and Power over this <HI>Province.</HI> Your <HI>Excellency</HI>'s Commands together with the Desires of your <HI>Honourable Council,</HI> have Order'd me into this awful Desk at this time. And will you suffer me, SIR, In the <HI>Name</HI> of that GOD, whose Character you bear, as to <HI>Assert</HI> the Dignity of your Station, and demand your Right to the Honour and Duty of this People, and the Tribute of their Prayers and Thanksgivings; so with all <HI>Humility</HI> to <HI>Suggest,</HI> that GOD's Honour is greatly concerned,
<PB N="94" REF="001484_0096_0FB35571BB2C5C78"/>
and bound up with yours, and by Maintaining your Real Excellency and Dignity as the <HI>Chief</HI> among our <HI>Gods,</HI> you will do great Honour and Service to that GOD whose Representative you are; that by your Wise, Just, Impartial, and Compas∣sionate Administrations, you will give us a Lively <HI>Picture</HI> of the Divine Government: That in your Example, we may see what a Beautiful Figure the Powers of Govern∣ment, when found in Conjunction with the Vertues of a distinguishing Prudence and Integrity, will make; and may be forced to acknowledge that the Glory of such a Rule over Men may be view'd not barely in a <HI>Lifeless Picture</HI> and <HI>Abstracted Idea,</HI> but in <HI>Reality</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> being Exem∣plify'd in your Conduct. Thus you will ap∣prove your Self, in a qualify'd sense, a <HI>God, i. e.</HI> a Diffusive Blessing to your People; and your Name will be as a <HI>Precious Oynt∣ment,</HI> the <HI>Perfume</HI> whereof will reach far and wide; and will be transmitted with bright Characters of Honour to Late Po∣sterity. What are <HI>Statues</HI> &amp; <HI>Triumphal Ar∣ches,</HI> when compared with these Superior Marks of Honour but <HI>Despicable Baubles?</HI></P>

GOD has called you, <HI>SIR,</HI> to the <HI>Heim</HI> in the most Stormy and Dark Day that e∣ver past over this Province: When we never more needed a Person of uncommon Sagacity, Address, Application and Dis∣patch, to Steer us safe through the many Perplexities and Involvements of a Long and Bloody War. And we trust it was in Love to our <HI>Zion,</HI> that GOD has appoin∣ted One of <HI>her own Sons</HI> at such a time to <HI>take her by the Hand,</HI> and <HI>Comfort her.</HI> The State of this Afflicted and Sinful People you are Placed over must needs render your Difficulties Many and Great, and your Burden Heavy: We sympathize with you, and out Prayers are Night and Day besieging the <HI>Throne of Grace</HI> on your ac∣count. It is the Work of GOD you are Engaged in; be Encouraged in it, and let not your Heart Faint what ever Hardships you may Encounter; GOD will observe all the Patience, Self-denyal that shall be Exercised for his Service and his Peoples Good; He will be with you in your Faith∣ful Administrations, and your Labours will not be found in Vain.</P>
<P>And may you always be under Heaven's

Propitious Conduct, to Direct and Succeed your Administrations: May the Blessings of the <HI>Celebrated Joseph</HI> descend upon you; Your <HI>Bow abide in Strength, the Arms of your Hands be strengthned</HI> by the <HI>Hands of the Mighty GOD of</HI> Jacob; <HI>Even</HI> by the <HI>GOD of thy Father who shall Help thee, and</HI> by <HI>the Almighty, who shall Bless thee:</HI> May you be Honoured with more Enlarged Mea∣sures of His SPIRIT, that you may Shine in your <HI>Exalted Orb</HI> with Brighter and Brighter Beams of <HI>Divine</HI> Grace, Ex∣cellency and Glory; that when <HI>Morta∣lity</HI> shall overtake you, which you have dayly Admonitions of in your Bodily In∣firmities, you may have an <HI>Euge</HI> from the <HI>SON of GOD,</HI> Your Master and Judge; and may joyn the Bright Throng of <HI>Elo∣him,</HI> Angels and the Spirits of Just Men, that incircle the <HI>Throne of GOD</HI> and the <HI>LAMB</HI> with <HI>Prostration</HI> and <HI>Praise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Let this word of <HI>Counsel</HI> from GOD be Addrest to the whole GENERAL ASSEMBLY: The Blessed GOD, who is a GREAT KING, and whose Name is <HI>Dreadful,</HI> does Expect and Require that
<PB N="97" REF="001484_0099_0FB3557762A4D9C8"/>
you Study to shew your selves <HI>Worthy</HI> of that Name, with which you are dignify'd. As you are <HI>Gods</HI> by <HI>Office,</HI> labour to be <HI>Gods</HI> by <HI>Analogy,</HI> reaching after the near∣est conformity to GOD, and the exactest imitation of Him, in your Publick Capa∣cities; by which alone you will be able to secure and illustrate the Glory of your Title, and approve your selves not only in <HI>Name,</HI> but in <HI>Truth Gods</HI> on Earth. GOD Himself has called you <HI>Gods;</HI> but those that are not skilful, thoughtful, vigilant and active to promote the Publick Safety and Happiness, are not <HI>Gods,</HI> but <HI>dead Idols.</HI> The <HI>Name</HI> inscribed on you is to give Rules and Measures, Life and Force to your Consultations for the Publick Weal. And there never was a day, that called for a more full Exercise of your Wisdom, Righ∣teousness, Vigilancy and Courage in their highest improvements, than this, in which you are called to be the Saviours of this People. The bleeding State of this Land, languishing under <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> can∣not but stir up your Paternal bowels, and <HI>quicken</HI> your Counsels and Endeavours for its Safety. Be then humbly intreated by
<PB N="98" REF="001484_0100_0FB3534AB20C64A8"/>
your just regards for your own Honour, and GOD's Glory; by your Love and Tenderness for your People, to approve your selves <HI>Ministers of GOD for our Good.</HI></P>
<P>And there are two comprehensive Ar∣ticles, in which you may approve your selves Worthy of the Character of our <HI>Gods.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) You will <HI>Assert</HI> your <HI>Dignity</HI> by Exerting your Powers to free the Land from those <HI>Sins,</HI> which are the <HI>Reproach of a People.</HI> It is beyond question that there are many gross Sins found among us, by which Heaven is Defy'd and the Land Polluted. Not only Spiritual Iniquities, as Pride, Hatred, Malice, Envyings, Un∣belief, and the Spirit of the World; but also open Abominations, and gross Im∣moralities, which do by a natural Causa∣lity, as well as moral Influence, cause the Crown to fall from our heads. Christ's <HI>Ambassadors</HI> can do little to restrain many of these bold Transgressors. They may cry aloud and not spare, but these stop their Ears like the deaf Adder. They are too much of an Adamantine temper and make to be <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wen</HI> by the <HI>Prophets.</HI> They
<PB N="99" REF="001484_0101_0FB3534F1E63E070"/>
are like the <HI>Leviathan,</HI> proof against all the Arrows taken out of the quiver of GOD's Word; the <HI>Sword</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> cannot pierce thro' their Scales. We may <HI>warn</HI> them from GOD, and Set the Ter∣rors of the Eternal Judgment before them, but these are at present invisible and dist∣ant things, which their <HI>Infidel Senses</HI> have no resentment of. There is but little hope to reform such, unless you can make the <HI>Sword of Justice</HI> to reach them. And pos∣sibly tho' they fear not the Wrath of the <HI>In∣visible GOD,</HI> yet they may be made to fear the <HI>Wrath</HI> of our <HI>Visible Gods,</HI> when like a <HI>Roaring Lyon</HI> it threatens to devour them. This therefore calls for your Care, and Courage.</P>
<P>Is not our Land deluged with <HI>Intempe∣rance</HI> and <HI>Drunkness?</HI> And is not the Con∣tagion of this Sin spread far and wide in Spite of all Remedies hitherto applyed, and as the <HI>Destruction,</HI> not only walketh in darkness, but wasteth at Noon day? Is there not too just a Complaint thro' our <HI>Towns,</HI> That the <HI>Assemblings</HI> of the People whether for Civil Transactions, Military Exercises, nay for Religion on
<PB N="100" REF="001484_0102_0FB35350B76CF318"/>
Lecture days, End in Intemperate Drink∣ing and Debauchery? <HI>And what will be the End of these things?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> Are not the Cryes of <HI>Injustice,</HI> and <HI>Dishonesty</HI> in our dealings, Evils most Scandalous to our Profession, yet loud in the Ears of GOD, and of all that tremble at his Anger? <HI>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no Physitian there? Why then is not the health of this People recovered?</HI> Have there not been proper <HI>Bills,</HI> brought for∣ward once and again, by the <HI>Motion</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> of his <HI>Excellency</HI> our <HI>Governour,</HI> which have hitherto been strangled in the birth? And can any good Account be given of them? May there not be many things done by this Honou∣rable Court to Save us from these destroy∣ing Evils? May not Laws be brought forward which are further necessary; and care taken for their Execution, that their Edge may on no pretence be rebated, that Iniquity may be forced to sneak and hide its guilty head, if not fully reformed? This <HI>Work</HI> belongs to you, <HI>Our Fathers;</HI> be wise and resolute herein, and <HI>GOD will be with you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="001484_0103_0FB353532BB1E5D8"/>
Suffer me here to add, That it is Ob∣vious that the <HI>Province</HI> is in great Dan∣ger by those <HI>Frauds</HI> and <HI>Forgeries</HI> com∣mitted upon out <HI>Bills of Publick Credit:</HI> And may it not be worthy your Conside∣ration, whether some more terrible Pu∣nishment, than our Laws have yet provi∣ded, may not be Establisht to Restrain such insolent <HI>Sons of Fraud and Violence?</HI> What <HI>Policy</HI> will allow of I may not determine; but I am well satisfy'd that the Crime is of so deep a Malignity, that <HI>Conscience</HI> and Religion will not forbid the <HI>Last</HI> and <HI>Hea∣viest</HI> Punishment.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) You will <HI>Assert</HI> your <HI>Dignity,</HI> by doing what you can to maintain the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>CHRIST</HI>'s <HI>Kingdom</HI> among us. You are appointed by GOD as <HI>Guar∣dians</HI> of the <HI>Religion,</HI> as well as Civil Li∣berties of his People. Your <HI>Character</HI> ob∣liges you to Exert your Power for the Protection, Preservation, and Glory of his Kingdom.</P>
<P>Allow me Liberty to hint at a few things necessary to this End.</P>
<P>It is requisite to the Glory of CHRIST's Kingdom, that <HI>Schools</HI> for Liberal Educa∣tion
<PB N="102" REF="001484_0104_0FB3535472CA78D0"/>
be Supported and Cherish'd. With∣out this we may Expect the <HI>Revolution</HI> of the <HI>Barbarous Age.</HI> We have good Laws in Force for this Design; but are they not Openly Eluded and Play'd with!</P>
<P>The <HI>Honour</HI> of CHRIST's Kingdom requires that the <HI>Ministry</HI> be honourably Supported: But by a criminal neglect hereof how are they brought into con∣tempt? their gifts dampt, and under little growth and improvement, being forced to sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> too much of that time in the Field to get their bread, which is due to their Studies? Are not their Allowances ge∣nerally Insufficient; and these too often unjustly with-held? <HI>And may you not find a Remedy for this Grievance?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> if CHRIST's Kingdom be kept up in its <HI>Glory,</HI> our <HI>Pulpits</HI> must be guard∣ed from the <HI>Ignorant,</HI> and <HI>Dissolute;</HI> the <HI>confident Boaster,</HI> and the <HI>heady Impostor.</HI> And this is to be despaired of unless a due <HI>Tryal</HI> of the Candidates of the Ministry be <HI>Establisht</HI> by your <HI>Authority.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="001484_0105_0FB35358EEF0EC08"/>
The Last hint shall be, that our <HI>Church Government</HI> must be Strengthen'd, if the Kingdom of CHRIST be preserved in it's Visible Glory. This Government is much Enfeebled; and one cause is because there is not a more Publick Regular &amp; Close U∣nion between Particular Churches. Some∣thing to remedy this has been by a <HI>Vene∣rable Synod</HI> Propounded under the Head of the <HI>Consociation of Churches in a Vici∣nity:</HI> And some <HI>Proposals</HI> have Lately been made, to bring that Synodical Determina∣tion into Practice, by the Body of our Ministers; but nothing has been Effected through Weakness of our Church State: the <HI>Proposals</HI> themselves have been mis∣represented, and <HI>Prophanely</HI> descanted on, and the Body of our Ministers insulted, and Blasphemed by some of the <HI>Sons of Corah.</HI></P>
<P>Let me here take Liberty to Offer to the Consideration of our <HI>Fathers in Go∣vernment,</HI> whether the Convening a <HI>Synod</HI> by your Authority at this Day to Consi∣der what <HI>Remedy's</HI> may be Apply'd to these
<PB N="104" REF="001484_0106_0FB3535C160CF178"/>
and other <HI>Distempers</HI> which our Church State is Enfeebled by, may not be more than a <HI>Prudential,</HI> a <HI>Present Duty.</HI> The <HI>Use</HI> &amp; <HI>Necessity</HI> of SYNODS for Reformation, has been Asserted through all Ages of the Church. Can there be a more Favoura∣ble Opportunity for Calling a <HI>Synod</HI> Ex∣pected, than under the <HI>Present Admini∣stration,</HI> and before some of our most <HI>An∣cient Worthy's</HI> in the Ministry are Tran∣slated to a <HI>Better World?</HI> If a <HI>Synod</HI> be not a sufficient <HI>Remedy</HI> for the Evils our Churches Labour of; or the Remedy be thought as <HI>Dangerous</HI> as the Disease; what Darkness, Confusion, and Disorder may we not Fear will soon overtake us?</P>
<P>If you are resolved to appears as <HI>Gods</HI> for us, you have Power to do much for this People on these accounts: You have now an <HI>Opportunity</HI> in your Hands. And if GOD spirit you for your Work, and make you Instrumental to Lengthen out our Tranquility; Uncommon <HI>Honours</HI> will be decreed you in <HI>Both Worlds.</HI> Tho' you must <HI>Dy like Men,</HI> yet you shall <HI>Rise</HI> and
<PB N="105" REF="001484_0107_0FB3535D96198050"/>
Live like the <HI>Angels of GOD.</HI> You are now styled <HI>Gods,</HI> and if you Maintain the Glory of your Character, and Resemble GOD, you shall not be Degraded in the Next Life; You shall be found <HI>Worthy</HI> to stand before the <HI>SON OF MAN</HI> at his <HI>Appearance</HI> and <HI>Kingdom; Worthy</HI> of that <HI>World</HI> and the <HI>Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To Conclude,</HI> Let the <HI>Whole Body of this People</HI> be perswaded to approve themselves Worthy of such Rulers, by aspiring after an holy Conformity to, and Imitation of GOD. What remains! But that we lift up our hearts to GOD in Heaven, that He would give us such Rulers to go in and out before us. And if GOD will Answer us, and make our Rulers, and this People to be GOD like, we shall be a happy People. The <HI>Mountains will</HI> bring forth <HI>Peace,</HI> and the little <HI>Hills Righteousness: Our Land</HI> shall not be called <HI>Desolate, nor Forsaken;</HI> for the <HI>Glory</HI> of the LORD shall arise upon it. GOD Himself will arise and Save us: And we shall have Reason to send our
